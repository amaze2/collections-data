Th0 Col)cordieytsis VoL. XXI. UNl'ON COLLEGE, JUNE 4, 1898. No. 30. Tlfe Utie<a rneet. Flushed with the splendid success in last year's meet, the Union track team· W·ent to Utica last Saturday and put up a plucky struggle £or theN. Y. S. I. A. U. pennant. The Hamilton team also came resolved to do or die a.nd, after a hard contest, succeeded in their detennination. Colgate and. Hobart were represented but failed to get ,more than six and two points respectively. The meet was lost not through any fau1t of our athletes but through the fact that we had met a better team. Everv .man did his best and re- came down the stretch in each race with a yard lead on the other competitors. Botb races were sprints from start to finish and both were run in · unusually fast time, the forrner in z. : oo 4-5 and ., ceived most hearty iupport fro1n the Union dele- gation of rooters. It was a \ never give up\ fight all through and even when defeat was cer- tain our representatives endeavored successfully to narrow the margin. · The meet was held under the auspices of Colgate at the Utica driving park. 'The tracks, as a result of recent rains, was in but fair con- dition and not conducive to good ti,me. Not- withstanding this the league records in both hurdle races, the running high jump and the mile and half-mile runs were broken, and those in the hundred yard dash and two-mile bicycle race equalled. The events were run off in a very dilatory fashion by the officials and as a result it was after seven o'clock when the last race took place. Especially good work was done for Union by ex-Captain O'Neil, ex-Cap- tain Sylvester, Captain Price, and Weed. Both hurdle races were easily ca pturerl by our athletes. The high hurdles were won in splendid style by Weed with Sylvester a close second in I 7 3-5. seconds breaking both the college and league records, while the low hurdles were carried off by Sylvester, Weed three yards be- hind in 27~ seconds, lowering the league record of last year of 28 seconds. The half-mile and mile runs were also sensa- tional events. Ostrander, the Hamil ton crack, the latter in 4:35 3-5. In the hundred yard dash Price tied Hender- son of Hamilton, equalling the record of last year. He got off very prettily in the two hun- dred and twenty yard dash and gradually draw- ing away from the bunch finished son1e five yards to the goal, in 23 4-5 seconds. Last year's captain, O'Neil, now at the Medi- cal college, ran a splendid race in the 440 yat·d daih. There was a good-sized entry list in this event and he had a hard time shaking off tl1e other competitors. It was nip and tuck to the seventy-five yard tnark when the Union man made a plucky effort and finished with three yards to space. Medbery, '99, who was spiked badly by a Hamilton man in this race, was dis- qualified for fouling but at a later titne the dicision was revoked. The bicycle race was of the usual slow natut·e, the sprint beginning in the last half rnile. Med- bery, 'oi, set the pace until the quarter pole when Stowell, of Hamilton, took the lead and finished a wheel's length ahead of the other t-nen. In the mile walk, Union secured second and third places easily, Hegeman and Paige both coming in with room to spare. Union did well in the field events, considering her number of entries. The running broad jump was easily captured by Davis with a jump of twenty feet. The pole vault was won by Cunninghatn of Hmnilton at 9 feet 6 inches, · with Weed, Sylvester and Baker of Ha1nilton each clearing the bar at 9 feet 3 inches. In the high jutup DeY ae took thinl place, and Vrooman secured one point in both of the heavy events. .·.:· I .:·', '·' ·, ;.

,, THE CONCORDIENSIS. After the meet the Union team m,et and re- elected Morton M. Price captain for next year. In the evening the Colgate Glee club gave a very creditable concert in. the Century club audi- torium, at which titne the prizes were dis- tributed. The team of twenty-six rnen was accotnpanied to Utica by as many students, who saw that there was no lack of rooting. At the hotel, on the way to and from the grounds,, and at the concert Union spirit, Union yells, and Union songs w,ere 1nuch in evidence and these features made up in part for the loss of the much coveted pennant, vvhich, however, must come to Union next year.

.. THE CONOORDIE'NStS. '7 stole second, and Thatcher's two-bagger to ieft field hrought hitn hotn'e. Union went out in one, two, three order in t11eh· haif of the eighth while the Vennonters sent two tnen ac;oss the plate on an error, two singles, and a two- bagger. In the ninth, French rnad:e first on Halpin's en~or and catne in on Parshall's hit to centre field. That ended the scoring, for McCuen went out at first, Skeels on a fly to Thatcher, The largest crowd ofthe season assernbled on the campus Monday afternoon to witness the last inter-collegiate baseball game of '98. It was Decoration Day and the contest had been well advertised. These two t·easons, together with the fact that the people of Schenectady realize that the \ boys on the hill\ have an exception- ally strong baseball teain, were responsible for ' and Staftord on a fly to S·tewart. the large attendance. Union's opponent was Middlebury and though the score shows that the Garnet was again victorious, not until the last man was out in the ninth inning was there any certainty as to the result. The Vermont boys showed thetn!:lel ves to be a clever lot of baseball 1nen and they gave Union the hardest kind of a struggle to win. The game was well played throughout and was one of the prettiest seen on the catnpus this year. Individual mention is unnecessary for the team played uniformly well. Thatcher and Wells were the oppos~ing pitchers and were both effective, although each were touched up for nine hits. It was shortly after three when tbe gatne was called, Middlebury in the field and Union, as usual, at bat. In the first half no one could score although French reached third. The run making was begun by Middlebury who sent one man across the plate on two singles and a passed ball. Union awoke to the situation in the second and four runs can1e in before the necessary three vvere out. But Middlebury by bunching their hits tied the score in their half. In the third and fourth no runs were tnade and Middlebury did not score again until the eighth. The fifth inning saw one more tally for Union and the sixth still another. In this inning with one tnan on bases Grout rapped out a high one over into the pasture and had encircled the bases before the ball was fielded. Middle bury claimed the ball a foul and though the umpire declared it fair, Captain Stnith. gave the visitors the benefit of the doubt, and Grout batted over again. In the seventh, Carver reached first, stole second, went to third on French's sacrifice and scored on Stewart's single. Stewart then The score in detail: UNION. 1LB. R. lB. F. 0. A. E.

Burrows, .Printer, 412 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. THE result 0f the Utica meet once more exempli- fies the error of being over-confident from too great a reliance upon past success. While Union was drearning of an easy victory, Hamilton 'vas putting on tb.e finishing touches. Union lost from the want of proper training. The1·e was none of that enthusiasm and determination that character- ized the preparations a year ago. That is what won the pe.nna,nt for us then, and would have done so ·again, fo1' the reco1·ds which gave the victory to Hamilton were about the san1e as those made by Union last year. We recognize the fact that there have been soiD.e obstacles in the way, but that ought to have increased our deterinination and not retarded it. 'l'ben there was an idea afloat that victory would be easy, beca,use it came so easy last yeai'. It ca.me easy then because we were not so sure of winning, and were in a condition to put forth all our energy if necessary. It is not well to be too .Sl!lre of anything. The unexpected always happens. ,,, Experience is a good teacher', saith the sage. We are in the position of the man who, when his dog was worsted in a fight, said \we ,would have won if it ba..d not been for the other dog.\ .ALi'HOUGR our track athletic team did not win , the Utica, meet, we have a baseball team which · has ih:e very agreeable habit of winning nearly aH its gaines. Our victories over Hamilton and MiddlE~bury were both won by able playing and . ha.:cd workagainstteamstbat havetbetnselvesls>een :, playin.g good ball, and while each Ine:mber of the team has done wen, the greates,t credit belongs to Capta.ia :Smith. H:e has had unusual obstacles to · contend with, but has nevertheless made a record of w :bieh he and we may well be proud . PBESIDENT JONES of Hobart complains that students graduate from college too late; the aver~ age age of graduation being twenty-:three. This may be very true, but is not the fault rather in the Ia-wer and preparatory schools than in the col- lege ?' The Ininimutn number of years in primary and grammar schools is eight, then come four years in the preparatory school, and then the coUege course. The college course could be take:n in three year~, but not by those who have studied twelve years before coming. The fact is, in the lower schools several yea,rs are practically wasted. It is absurd to require eight or nine years ~tudy before: entering the preparatory school anrl four years more in that school. The average German boy at the. age of nine is a,ble to read, write and do a little arithmetic. Then be spends nine years in the gyn1nasiu1n, where he en1erges at the average age of eighteen knowing more than we do when we have :finished college at 23. This last statement is not made rashly. We knew a man who left the gyrunasium at the age of eighteen and never studied Latin again during his entire life. Forty- seven years after he talked Latin that Cicero might have spoken, not only mere quotations from classieal authors but general conversation and dis- course. How many of our Latin professors could do th::lit ? The fault is not with thein, not al- together in our college course, but in the system of edu.cation. You cannot make an American be- lieve that he is physically or mentally less capable than ·a German. The fact is, as Professor Norton says, -the Americans are mere triflers, unable to understand the serious and graver duties of life. Until -we, as a na.tion, come to a more serious view of thin;gs it is impossible to expect college students to look at life from anything but a boyish stand point.

He said in part : Yon rnay be interested to hear of an associa- tion of young tnen formed ·1nore than two thousand years befot~e the Y. M. C. A. was_.: thought of. You m,ay ·call it a Y. M. ·c. A., for it was cotnposed of followers of Buddha and had as its object the dissemination of his doctrines. Buddha had spent much tirne in meditation as to the cause of the wor 1d's wretchedness and decided, finally, that it was desire for what they had not, that made men miserable. Therefore, eliminate desire and yo1:1. eliminate wretchedness, he argued. So l,e forn1ed the Buddhistic association. The Budd- hists had their ten cotnmandments, tnany of which corresponded to the ten we know. In addition for the more devout there were twelve sire, .and go hack to the principle that existence in this world is the greatest evil. In .ma1·ked contrast is the teaching of Christ. '' I am cotne that H1~ey .might have life,. and that they n.1ight have it ·more abundantly.\ In one case the aim is self-annihilation and in the other it is perfec- tion. The two systems r.est upon diffevent con- cepHons of God. The Buddhistic concepti0n is that God is the sutn total of all that is, .and that he is without personality. The Christian con- ceives that God is love, that He ·is a Being actively interested in man's welfare. This is a great .contrast, and shows our present pri vi:lege.

Sickles, fatuous for hi! exploits in war down their arms, but all the prornises were and diplomacy in statecraft; a man peculiarly broken and Cuba was brought back into the adapted to speak with force and authority upon state she was in in 1825. It was in this year the motnentous issue now attracting the atten- that 1nartial law was first proclaitned on the tion of the world. island, and, with the exception of a space of \ General S-ickles was introduced by General four months, Cuba has been under martial law Daniel Butterfield, the founder of the course, who gave a brief account of his career in his relations with the state, and paid a glowing trib- ute to the distinguished service which he had given for his country. In opening his remarks the lecturer said that he felt the greatest sympathy for Spain. \ Her attitude in the present war is only partly her fault; it is largely her misfortune. I have great regard for the queen, nor can I but feel pity for her ministers when I survey the tnagnitude of their task, the difficulties to be encountered, and the sadness which will come to the whole nation through Spain's inevitable defeat. \The present conflict is not one of our.seek- ing. Our unpreparedness is the best proof that we did not seek or expect war. The history of the Cuban question is the history of a century. Jefferson was the first to point out the great i1nportance of Cuba to the United States, and every president since has had this in mind. In 1869 I was sent by Grant to Spain for the sole purpose of showing the Spanish government the extreme danger that existed in her relations with Cuba, and that unless there was reform in the government of the island the United States would interfer~, but with the exception of the prime minister I found no listeners. We have . ever s~1nce. \ Cuba and Porto Rico are the only territo- ries in America that do not enjoy to any degree substantial self-governtnent. We have done all in our power to persuade Spain to rightly adtninister law in her provinces, and still she has not. The issue now is: Which shalll·ule- Spanish ideas of colonial administration or American self-government? '' It is on these grounds that I affinn this war is just, necessary and inevitable. At present Europe does not accept these conclusions, but it is only a matter of titne before it will. Men say this war could and should have been avoided. This retnark has been made of every war that has taken place.\ He then showed how war could have been avoided in the case of the American Revolution, the war of r8r 2 and the civil war, by support- ing the principles fought for. He said that so great power and influence had not been given to us for the accun1ulation of rnere material strength. \ Our present duty is to assist the · Cubans in their struggle for freedom. The geographical, com111ercial and strategic situation is most imperative, and \ve cannot deny the relations that spring therefrom. \ President Madison, as well as President

6 THE OONCORDIENSlS. Monroe, looked favorably upon the struggle for fteedotn of the South Atnel\ican states, while Russia, Prussia and Austria fonn ed the holy alliance in suppo1:t of Spain. The11, as now, England joined with :the United States, settling the balance of power in the old world, and stood between Eu1~ope and the United 'States.\ Speaking of destiny of nations he said: \Who would have thought a century ago tl'lat England would send Anglo-Saxon civilizatio11: over the whole world? Who would have foreseen a month ago that our :flag would filoaL Io,ooo miles away? Who would have thougl1t that by the defeat of a Spanish fleet at Manila the destruction of the Maine would be avenged?\ He thought that Divine Providence was with us in this war, fro1n the re1narkable victory that Dewey was pennitted to win withcn1t the loss of ships or tnen. ''Whatever we n-:tay do with the Philippines as a whole,\ said he, ''we n1ust keep Manila. Dewey has tnade Manila for us consecrated ground.'!' There was an expression of feat· on his part for the future of Spain, because of her heavy indebtedness, corrupt colonial systetn, and inter- nal dissensions. He said that she vvould tneet with inevitable defeat in the present conflict, for the United States could not see with indifference the maintenance or extension of Spain's brutal policy. The General stated that he merely wished to 1nake his contribution toward the elucidation of the question, and his clear treattnent of the sub- ject in its historical, com n1ercial, political and tnoral aspects indicated a keen insight and a broad knowledge. At the close of the lecture an opportunity was given to ask questions concerning special phases of the subject. The first was in regard to Hawaii, which he believed should becotne an American possession. Dr. Raytnond then asked whetl1er it had been rightly said that war could have been averted if we had waited for Spain's protnised concessions. '' Unfortunately, Mr. President,\ l'eplied the speaker, \the concessions of Spain always cotne too late,\ illustrating in detail frotn her past history. The question was asked, '' What kind of a. . man is Sagasta?\' which elicited the terse reply, ''An excellent chief of police.\ Dr. Ashtn·ore asked if it was Spain's peculi~r sense of honor that is really l1er reason for fight- ing. General Sickles replied: \Spain ·has ceded, yi,elded, granted and sold more land thart any other nation on the face of the earth, and yet her pecuHar sense of honor forbids her part-- . . tl 1 .. :j,tl· \ 1ng w1 :1 a ' h e rnore. To the question why the English know how to govern their co~onies and the Spanish do not, th€ speaker :replied : '' Because the English. have common sense. But let 1ne add right here that we taught England that cotntnon sen.se.'' Although General Sickles spoke for almost two hours, he held the attention of his audience throughout, and b.is remarks were frequently interrupted by applause. Tl].e \ Ll \ (11 e Q.

THE OONOOnbtENSIS. 7 <51]~ fUp~a Deilta DaQ:ee. Last Friday night the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity opened their new chapter house with a rec,epb1on an.d dance. The ho,ase was very prett:i[y decorated with bo~s of apple. blossoms and cut flow,ers, andthe statrcase With the colors green and white. The four larg,e ~ooms on the first floor w·el~e given up to danc1Hg and were adtnirably suited for this purpose, a:s one in1- men se room, was made by opening the wide folding, doors which separate thetn. As it was a pleasant evening, the wide piazza which ex- tends around three s.ides of the house, was much used, being .a very cool refuge between the dances. The music which lasted until about five was furnished by Gioscia and. three of his tnen, and the refreshments by Dohern1an. The patronesses were: Mrs. A. V. V. Ray- tnoncl, Nrs. J. K. Paige, Mrs.J.

The ;baseball team rnet defeat last Saturday at the hands of the '' Gillams,\ a team made up of professionals and setni-professionals, and probably the Rtrongest inN ew York.. The tea1n is located at Canajoharie where Saturday's ga,m~e was played. Captai~n Smith's n1en were no match for such an aggrega·tion and the gan1e ought never to have been arranged. Besides this, Union's team was crippled and hence the 1nagnitude of the score. It is to be hoped that no tnore such games will be scheduled. The score by inn,ings : R. H. E. U . 0 0 0 1 0 0- 1 3 7 lllOU . ................ . Gillams ................ 3 6 5 2 3 5-24 20 6 Batteries, Thatcher, Parshall and Stewart; Bern- hardt and Roberts. The ga1ne scheduled to have been played on Wednesday between Union and Syracuse, at Syracuse, was cancelled by the latter teatn, and consequently Captain S~mith and his n1en had an opportunity to take a rest. }'lob art WiQS. As the Concordiensis goes to press, word is received that Thursday's gatne at Geneva was won by Hobart, 17 to 1 I. This means that Union tnust play Colgate again.

SICKLES' lecture last Friday was doub- ly interesting by reason of \lis deep acquaintance with. the subject, and his unique personality. ' During his long and useful ca1·eer,. ·General Sickles has had adventures as many and as varied as those of the celebrated Bampbylde Moore Carew. He has been state senator, congress- PERLEY PoORE SHEEHAN, '98, - Editor-in-Chief CHARLES J.

This office is one which has been filled by a long succession of Tammany plunderers; General Sickles was a notable excep- tion and the duties of the office were never so well administered as during his occupancy. He has seen. the snows of five and seventy wiinters but the fire of his heart burns as brightly as it did an half century ago and we predict for him many a year of honorable service to the country he has lov·ed so well.

Burrows, Printer, -4.12 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. IT behooves every student to patronize the final concert to be given by the Musical association in the Van Curler during Commencement week. There will be several new features introduced which will help make this the most delightful entertainment of the season. IT is not generally known that Union is the only college that has been able to secure the presence of so many famous men to address her students. Her success in this direction has been due to the generous efforts of General Daniel Butterfield, '49, who founded and promoted the Butterfield lecture course which basgtven the college the oppo:rtunity of l~stening to such men as Hon. Thomas F. Bayard, Gen. Horace Porter, Hon. Seth J.JOW, Charles. A. Da.na, Edward Everett Hale, D. D., Hon. Chauncey M. Depew and Gen. Daniel E. Sickles. Gen. Butterfield has proved himself a worthy alumnus of Old Union, and we deeply regret that the course has been concluded. On Sunday, June 5th, Dr. Truax brought to a close the year's work with a student class which has been engaged since last September in studying the Bible as literature. The text book used was one of the series of\ The Modern Reader's Bible\ edited by Prof. Moulton of the Uni-versity of Chicago. The ground covered included stories, such as that of Joseph, Balaam, Sa,mson, Elisha, Belshazzar ; orations, such as that of Moses at the rehear!al of the blessing and the curse, Isaiah's \ The Covenant with Death,\ Ezekiel's'' The Wreck of the Good Ship Tyre\; wisdom brevities, essays and sonnets; lyrics, such as the elegy from which the drama of Job starts, ''David's Lament,\ and '' David's Song of Victory\ and antiphonies such as the '' Song ofMoses and Miriam\ and ''Deborah's Song.\ These works have been studied with reference chiefly to the literary skill displayed in putting into beautiful and impressive form sentiments manifestly true of human nature and experience, interest of character and plot, ski 11 in reaching feeling and motive, power in portraying the tenderness and the sublin1ity of nature, and in n'laking intensely vivid the effect produced in man's soul by the recognition of his relation to the infinite, as well as minor melodies of phrase, crisp terseness of sage maxims, and clever sur- prises of epigram have been considered as re- vealing the fluent harmony of the treatment with the rich diversity of the matter. The next course will probably deal with a few short rhapsodies and the story of Isaiah as a wh<>le.

THE ·dONOORDIENSIS·. Victory Over ~ocQat~. .... \ On Tuesday morning the baseball team started off on its western trip to decide the winner of the '98 pennant of the New York State Inter- coUegiate Athletic union. They departed with a clean J?ecord of threegam'es won and none lost and it took them about an hour and a half to mount one round higher in the struggle for the championship, by adtninistering defeat to Col- gate.

This season has been highly profitable not only financially, but also for the good reputation the clubs ha,,.e given to Union by their fine vocal and instrumental music.
