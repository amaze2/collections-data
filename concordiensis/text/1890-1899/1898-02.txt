Th~ Co11cordi~Ilsis VoL. XXI. UNION COLLEGE, FEBRUARY 5, 1898. No. 16. The Alumni association of North-eastern New York,. held its annual banquet at the Ken- more, Albany, last Friday night, and the affair was enjoyable to a l1igh degree. The speakers were at their best and the spirit of \ O~d Union\ was in every heart. Plans for various i~mprove:tnents in the college huadings were inaugurated and heartily received. Of decided interest to under-classm,en is the proposition to £t ttp the dormitories with modern improve- n'lents in the near future. A business meeting preceded the banquet and matters concerning the general w·elfare of the .college were brought up for discussion. The following officers were then elected : President, William P. Rudd, '73 ; vice-president, Seymour Van Santvoord, '78; secretary and treasurer, !Charles F. Bridge, '87. President Rudd, as toastmaster, maintained his reputation for '\vit and eloquence, officiating in happiest fashion. The toast list was well chosen and the responses were of more than ordinary excellence. They were as follows: \ The Modern College and Its Students,\ man, Warner R. Borst, J. Newton Fiero, M. W. Vosburgh, Prof. Hoffman, Joseph D. ·Craig, John E. Sherwood, Prof. Hale, Albert M. Bankey, Philip S. Dorlon, G. M. Ingalsbe, Charles H. Mills, C. E. Patterson, Henry J. Martin, Chas. H. Peck, Prof. C. E. Franklin, C. C. Van Kirk, Ed. M. Cameron, F. R. Cam- eron, Prof. Jones, Amasa J. Parker, E. D. Ronan, J. A. Lawson, A. J. Ray, Charles F. Bridge, Wm. P. Rudd, L. H. Rockwell, W. M.

Robinson and Dr. Albert Vander Veer. A highly enjoyable feature of the occasion was the music furnished by a quartet compris- ing, John Gutmann, '98, and R. M. Eatnes, Harold J. Hinman and Fred.

Gailey, formerly of Princeton, and now traveling secretary of the Students' V olun- teer Movement, was the guest of the college Y. M. C. A. Mr. Gailey is well known as a member of the victorious Princeton teatn of '96, and has become even better known in the last year as a worker among students in the interests of missions. On Tuesdny evening, after the regular service, there was an informal discussion about Y. M. C. A. work in general. On Wednesday after- noon Mr. Gailey addressed a large audience of students in the chapel, taking the Volunteer Movetnent as his theme ; and the fact that he expected to start for China ih three week's time gave an added interest to all he said.

4 THE OO·NCORDIEN'SIS. Of his interesting and stirring appeal we can give but few extracts. He compared the begin- nings of the nation as symbolized by the Wash- ington ehn at Cambridge, to the beginning of foreign missions in America as symbolized in the noted '' Haystack Monum-ent\ at WiHiams- town, on the spot where five men gathered in I 8o6 and consecrated themselves to work in foreign lands. Missions were then unpopular, but the spirit of those students, '' We can do it if we will,\ was the spirit that has always char- acterized the overcoming of difficulty, the accornplishment of resolution. These n1en faced heathendotn in a blackness that was awful; their work was the beginning. With others at Andover they formed a society ; such was its unpopularity that they were forced to tnake it secret. For years the work among students went slowly. In r876 occurred the famons revival at Princeton. This was the beginning of the student Y. M. C. A. The Volunteer movement originated in Mr. Moody's request for a college conference. At this conference a hundred 1nen consecrated themselves to foreign mission work. This was in r886, and since then the work has progressed steadily until the World's Federation of Student Y. M. C. A.'s was formed in Sweden and Mr. John R. Nott made his tour of the world. These events are of recent date. The spirit of Christ is becoming the spirit of college men, and is raising up more of them who are deter- mined to have a direct part in the \ evangeliza- tion of the world within the present generation,\ which is the motto of student volunteers. 51]e 81]a~espear~ ~ll.Jb. At the first regular meeting of the Shakes- peare club held last week, the following officers were elected; President, Walter M. Swann, 'g8 ; vice-president, Harrison K. Wright, '99 ; secretary, Chris. A. Ha rtnagel, '98 ; treasurer, John H. Gutmann, '98; executive committee, Willis E. Jvlerriman, '98, Peter Nelson, '98, John C. Merchant, '98, Harrison K. Wright, '99· The executive comtnitte was given full power to arrange the program for the term. pt]·i Delta 51]eta DaQe:e. The men1bers of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity gave a very ,enjoyable reception at their hottse on Union street on Friday exenin.g, Ja·n. 28. Music was furnished by Revitt,. andi dancing continued until an early hour Saturday morning. The guests frotn out of town were : Mrs. Beebe, Miss Beebe, Miss Sutton, Albany ; Mrs. Falls, Mrs. Wheeler, and the Misses Liddle, Amsterdam. Besides the active cba pter of the fraternity were present fron1 this ci1ty Prof, and Mrs. Marvin, Prof. and Mrs. Kay., Mrs. Fitz- gerald, Miss Swits, Nliss Clute\ M i:ss Fagan, Miss Putnatn and Rev. W. H. Waygood, ]L F. Bain, A. D. Ingram, Walter Lawton and William Fagan. }lfter t~~ Bolters. Since the adoption of the rule in rega.rd to college meetings, there have been a number of n1en in college who have been maki11g a practice of bolting chapel Monday mornings aRd staying away from regular college meetings, giving the hour instead to slet-p or study. The :tnatter has been broached editorially in the Cot1cordiet1sis several times but the first active steps to\va.rd t·ectifying it were taken at the college meeting on Monday morning, when it was decided by an unam inous vote that the president of the senior class appoint a committee to confer with the faculty and inform them of the sentirnent of the meeting and that the faculty be ask·ed to pass a resolution n1aking one bolt from· chapel on Monday 1norning equivalent to three ordinary bolts. President Bradford appointed as ~uch committee Messrs. Crichton, Cox and Swann. l{il Cases to TiQcler. The second and last race, for a stake of $250, between Charles Kilpatrick and George Tincler of Ireland, took place Saturday, Jan. 29, at Blackburn, Lancashire. The distance was three-quarters of a mile. Tincler won the toss. He got away first and led throughout, winning by five yards in 3 minutes 13 2-5 seconds. 1 wit: W01 inst me1 ced cla~ .

THE C'ONCORDIENSIS. New Bool{s for tt}e £.ib:rary. The ·example of the senior class, in accord with the suggestion of Dr. Jones,. in purchasing works af reference on sociology for the library, instead of text books, is receiv.i!lg high coln- mendation. It has been suggested that the pre- cedent he follo-vved not only by all succeeding classes in sociology but by an succeeding classes in aU departn1ents V\·herever the method is feasible. Standard -vvorks on psychology and n1ora'l science are sadly needed and tn1ght he placed .nn the shelves in this way.

Y.,.., in r8o5 ; \\\·as educated in Union college and in Auburn setninary, cotn- tnencing his labors as a minister of the gospel at the Presbvterian church at Petersborouo h .J :-. ' Madison county, when he was 30 years old. J\ir. Schofield was an advanced thinker ,. especially on the subject of slaYery and becatne so pronounced in l1is views on the subject of abolition that he was cotnpelled, a fe\v years later, by the Presbytery, to sever his con- nection with the Presbyterian church. l-Ie im- mediately accepted a call to preach in the Con- gregational church at Hamilton, N. Y. George Calhoun Westcott, a former member of the class of '95, died from consutnption at Sumtnerville, S. C., where he had been re- siding for his health. He was a tnember of the Delta Upsilon fraternity, but left college on account of sickness before he cotnpleted bis course. William A.

Chas. \Burrows Printer, 4x2 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. THERE hasn't been much said about it, pP.-r- haps, but the man who thinks that the open paths about the college grounds are not appreciated, deserves an n. s. The campus, just now, seetns n1ore than ever a place of tnagnificent distances; the wind is keenerJ the snow d riftier, the Inercary more dejected, than anywhere else in the county. And yet, those paths have been kept as wide open as a-as a Raines-law hott=>l. The labor entailed suggests a dustless Klondike. STUDENTS of Union ·will be interested to hear of the 1·ecent running of Charles H. Kilpatrick against George B. Tincler, the well-known Eng- Hsh profe8sional in the u1ile. K.ilpatrick defeated Tincler in the half -ruile in 1 In in. 57 2-5 sec., and was defeated by the same runner in a three-q uar- ters mile in 3 In in. 13 2-5 sec. As the American is hardly at ho1ne in the latter distance, his defeat is easily explainable, especially in view of the Englishman's unusually good figures. .. 'VE believe it to be of far reaching importance that the faculty concur with the active portion of the student body in suppressing as far as possible the growing habit of bolting colleg-e meetings. Though student interests and faculty interests have not always appeared to be in absolute harn1ony, this has been owing so[ely to diverse opinions as to the best route to the cornmon goal, old Union's weal. If the undergraduate has at tirnes appeared a trifle jubilant when the class- room proved too cold for 1~eeitation purposes, l1e has expressed be:tiu1es no doubt, the covert joy of an overworked professor. Nor do the students for- get that the professorial pocket on ruore than one occasion bas been ravished of book-n1oney to 1neet that irrepressible athletic deficit. lt is with ,this very thing in nlind that the student comrnHtee now appear before the faculty in behalf of a n1easure for the conunon good. The regular Monday ltlorning procession of dorrnice, that a1ubles languidly up the hill any old tilue after nine o'clock, to use a colloquialisu1, augurs no good for college spirit or college finances, either now or hereafter. MucH has been said in this and other colleges concerning the decadence and reYival of the college debating societies. In the January Par- thenon Profe~:sor Opdyke's interesting and sug- gestive article discovers fully the high 1noti ves that should actuate their continuance; and the writer calls attention to the fact that the debating society js on the verge of a new era of in1portance and prosperity. At present however, the local literary societies display but little of their pristine vigor and in- fluence. The class-roorr1, the fraternity, the gyrn ... nasiun1, and the multiple de1nands of other alrnost countless u11dergraduate organizations, l1ave well- njgb absorbed the time and energy that forrnerly went to enhance the Philon1atheanor the A.delphic. That tl1is tiine and energy, or at least a good share of it, could be used to no better ad vantage than in the study and debate of live subjects, the article above referred to leaves uo ground for doubt.

THE OONCORDIENSI:S. ·Concentration of the n0-w widely scattered interests .:seems equally patent . . But to deflect the attention of the students from less profitable :channels of recreation and pastime,. to the real and superior advantages of a good debating society, other attractions than. the ' weekly debate must at fi,rst be offered. In former days members of the faculty frequently lec,tured . on popular StibJects before the societies in joint session. We are coni§ dent they would as wiHingly render similar service today. Particular pains were taken to make tbe literary programs elegant .and instructive. Often. an alumnus of eminence ·would deliver a lecture under the auspices of the societies. .T oint debates were held oftener than once a year. All these things, while incidental to the real purpose offfuesocieties, 'vere instrumental in making them, what they should and ca.n be Inade today, a n1eans of culture and intellectual breadth, open to any and every man in college. Se\OIJ:d JUQior ]'fop. The Juniors gave another successful hop at Yates' boat house last Friday evening. The attendance was not as large as at the first hop, but this served to tnake the affair none the less enjoyable.

'To ,the Editor of The Concordiensis: For the last three weeks the reportorial staff of i 'The ·Concordiensis have been making my life so : n1iserable that at last I decided to give the1n a. : gan1e :£or Saturday.. Feb. 12th, with the regular · guarantee, and one-half in case of rain. Whether ouran1bitiousreporters wishsiinply to get material for the college paper. or whether they really desire My proposition is that at the first sign of spring weather the students shovel the snow off the earnpus., thereby ,giving the sun a chance to dry the ground. This plan has been found to be practicable in oth.ereoHeges, and there is no reason why Union n1en should not be glad to do this work for their own college team. to know what has been :done by the base ball n1anager I can not say. Granting that the latter is the case, I wiU submit, so far as I am able, a report of the work that bas thus far been done, togetber with what seen1s to me the prospect for the coining season. Tl1e manager has been at work on the schedule since early last fall. This work has not been carried on so rapidly as might have been done had the 1nanagement been in possession of more facts and figures. The m·anagers of previous years kept no copy of their correspondence, and bad no report to make to the secretary of the athletic board at the end of their respective season. Con· sequently I have had to figure out the amonut. necessary to guarantee the expenses of the team , for nearly every trip, and to arrange a schedule i: I• wit.hout having had past experience, so to speak, , to guide me. Not that 1 desire to cast any reflec· tions on the 1nanager of last year's team. 0 n the contrary, :Manager WilHarns did most e:xeellent woTk in reviving interest. in base ball after it had suffered the severe set-back of the one and tw@ years previous. Although there was a meeting of the Athletie: board on Wednesday night of last week,. tbe s<lhedule was not ratified. It is, to a certain. exte11t, provision.al; some games now scheduled. will probably be cancelled, while others will be added. After taking into consideration the resulit of the last spring vacation trip, I decided that i~t would be best not to play any garnes this year until after the opening of the spring term. I ain in hopes of playing the opening game of the season on the ca1npus, April 9, tbe first Saturday in the Spring term. The scheduling of a game for this date wiU depend principally on the students. We need a-t least two weeks of out-door practice before this Our alumni of New York and vicinity, to say nothing of the stl!ldents, w.ere so displeased with the result of our trip toN ew York last spring that I thought it best not to run any chances of repeat- ing our performance. The tean1 will not, there- fore, play in New York this season, and a trip to Canton, (St. Lawrence University) will probably take the place of a southern trip. The re1nainder of the schedule wiH explain itself. GAMES ON THE CAMPUS. 9 April, 20 April, 29 April, 4. May, 7 May, 18 May, 30 May, ? Ne·w York University. Ve1·rnont University. Colgate. Han1ilton.

! I \ 4 THE CONCORDIENSIS. The following men are candidates for the team: Pitcher-Parsons, '98, Edwards, 1900, Mallery, 1901, Nev\ins 1901, Hudson,. Med.; catcher-Hege- man, '99, Delehanty, Med., Pursell, :rvied.; 1st base -Wiley, '99, Nevins, 1901: 2nd base-Vron1an, '98, Ripley, 1900, Leavenworth, 1901; 3;rd base- French, 1900, Davis, 1900, Carver, 1901; short-stop -· Purchase, '.99, G:t·out, 1901 ; fiield-Whipple, '98, Merchant, '98, S.1nith. '99, Stewert, 1901, Reynolds, 1901, Robison, 1'901, Loing; 1'961., Cooke, 1901. This year the management proposes to insist on systema:tic training. Hereto~ore men have sacri- ficed the interest of the team. for their pipes, the theatre, the dance. Unless .a man is willing to train faithfully he ·will not be considered a candi- date for the team. It :is true ,that we have but few men to choose frorn ; consequently men fe~ 1 that the manager iso bliged to accept their services whether they observe the rules of training or not. But if we can not get along without these men this year, then the gam.~s will be cancelled whether they inelnde a trip or not. I do not wish to be obstinate, but I am convinced that a success- ful ball player must pay attention to his physical being. If the students as a body, do not wish these rules enforced, they ba ve but to ask for IllY resignation, which will be duly presented. Thus far we have a schedule and a number of players. What shall we do to obtain spectators? I a.m thoroughly eonvinced that our Inethod of ad vert ising is a poor one ; I doubt if our little 12x 14 in. posters pay for themselves. It is a notice- able fact that af,ter every game, people in the city make inquiries as to who played, and express total ignorance that any such game was to be played. To obviate this, the n1anagement proposes to advertise in such a way that people will know of our games, whether they want to or not. I have consulted with Mayor Duryee and Chief Catnpbell, and these gentle~:nen have very kindly consented to give me all the latitude for advertising that the law allows, and they have also added what I think will prove to be a valuable suggestion. People can not help but s~e a sandwiched boy dressed in a poorly fitting base ball suit; neither can they help hearing an· announcement of the games through a megaphone. And now comes that delightful subject of sub- scriptions. At the last meeting of the Athletic Board this matter was fully discussed, and a com- mittee, consisting of Prof. Opdyke, Treasurer Dillingham and 1nyself, was appointed to draw up resolutions pertaining to the payment of sub- scriptions. I beg to submit the committee's report. '' It is resolved by the Athletic Board of Union College, that the minimum sum of $600.00 be raised for the pu1·poses of the board for base ball, track athletics, etc., to finish the college year of 1897-98. ''When said suru of $600. 00 has been fuUy sub- scribed and paid to the treasurer, then the treas- urer of this board shaH issue tickets to the fully paid subscribers to such fund, 'Stating tbe amount of such su bscdption, and each ticket so issued shall entitle the bolder thereof to adrnission to all games ·Of the different associations held in tne ,city of Schenectady during the ren1ainder of the year. \All students not holding these tickets will be char;ged the regular admission fee to an of such games. \It is further resolved, that no schedule shaH . be ratified,. or gan1es piayed, until said Ini:nhnum sutn of $600.00 has been fully subscribed and paid to the treasurer of this board ... , This report has not been accepted by the board, but in .all probability it will be at its next rn.eeting, the 16th inst., ~nasrnuch as it incorporates the ideas most prevalent at the iast rnt\)eting. It is needless to tell the students how the board has been hampered in its action, by the non-pay- ment of subscriptions. In fact, the students have been so dilatory in this n1atter that the board felt it necessary to take decisive action in order to insure itself against possibJe if not probable loss. It was estimated by the board that it would be necessary to raise $900 in order to ca:n·y the base ball and track teams through this season, and therefore placed $600 as a minimum sum to be 1·aised. This subscription has nothing to do with the foot ball subscription. There is enough money still due the board from last fall's subscription to pay every cent of indebtedness, and unless this money is forthcoming decisive action by the board in regard to it may be looked for by those students still owing such subscriptions. To form an idea of the number of students whose subscriptions are not paid, one has but to note the absent ones at college meetings. It is the opinion of the board that those men who subscribe with no intention of paying act the lie and should be severely dealt with. A word more in explanation of the fore- going resolution n1ay not be out of place. Until said n1inimum sum. of $600 is~ fully raised by the students and received by the treasurer no games will be ratified or played, and this decision of the board will be adhered to. It is easily seen how necessary it is to raise this ·sum during the present month. The base baH schedule should have been ratified ere this, but it will not be ratified until the full amount of $600 has been received by the treasu1·er. When the treas- urer is in receipt of this sum he will issue su bscrip- tion tickets to each man who has paid his sub- scription in full; ~nd those students whose sub-

Every man -who pays his subscription -will ibe given a receipt by the base balltnanager · IJea1· Coneo1·di ensis: -which will entitle him to a subscription ticket after, and not before, the full a1uount of $600 bas been raised by the students and received by the treasurer. If, at the opening of the base ball season, it is :found that the students are not disposed to raise this sum then those students whose subscription at that time have been paid, will have their n1oney refunded by the tr~asurer, and athletics, with the possible exception of tennis, golf and cross country Funs, will cease for the remainder of the college year. Ft>How students, a successful season depends on your subscription and the suppor~t yon give to the team and its 1uanagement. Respectfully subinitted, GEO. A.

A sentence in one of your editorials last week puzzled n:te at first, but on thinking it over I dis- covered in it so1ne suggestions which are so significant that attention ought to be called to thenL Here is the sentence: '• Though student interests and faculty interests have not always appeared to be in absolute harrnony, this has been owing solely to diverse opinions as to the best route to the con11non goal, old Union's weal.'' Now, what are the \faculty interests?'' A.. little reflection shows us at once.; and is it not· truly an inspiring spectacl~, these scores of young men so ungrudgingly sacrificing hours of their valuable time week after week in the interests of the pro- fessOI$? No w'onde:r the students occasionally feel that tbey are doing too 1nuch for the few men who compose the faculty, good fellows though these latter be, and no wonder bolts a1·e asked for; but we all know· how strenuously the faculty insists on its rigbts, and too often refuses to give up the delight and the benefit it derives from holding recitations. Yes, it even 111eets fortnightly to devise new schemes for advancing its own interests. One doubts whether this ean go OJ+ indefinitely. 'Vill not a tin1e come when young men cannot afford to do so much for purely altruistic pur- poses, and when faculties will have to seek other means of increasing their own know ledge ? And as for old Union's weal, surely there is no difference of ophlion; the only question is how to induce the faculty to bring the nun1ber of recitations as Io·w as possible, and be contented with smallest possible amount of knowledge. They can extract infornation from so many classes in succession, -why should they expect to learn everything fron1 one? As to the students' interests, I confess I an1 not quite so clear. Perhaps you can enlighten me. I know that this was not the main point of the editorial quoted from, but that one sentence struck 1ne as being pregnant with thought. CONSTANT READKR. Prof. S. B.

We hereby apol0gize to the many bright little things that failed -to see tbe light this week. THE manner in-which the 1nen are taking hold of their gymnasiun1 work is highly refreshin.g in this somewhat 'veary age. But there is not enough doing yet. Every man who possesses so ruucl1 as ,a split shadow of athletic a.bility should be out in th.e gymnasium every af:ternoon training for dear life. Poets may be born, b?-t athletes are rnade.

The triennial convention of the Student Volunteer movetn:ent, alluded to in our last issue, pro1nises to be not only the largest tnissionary gathering ever held in North America or the vvorld, but also the largest university gathering ever brought together. Already more than 18oo students and professors have signified their intention to be present. Frotn Nova Scotia and Mexico, frotn Oregon . and Florida, these delegations will ga.ther in Cleveland, 0., the 23rd of this n1onth. The general sessions vvill be held in the .armory of the '' Cleveland Greys'' and vvill be opened by Rev. F. B. Meyer of England. Here will be heard the strongest missionary :speakers of North An1erica and of the world. To the· college student, the fatniliar narnes of Speer, Mott, VVilder, Gailey, Brockman, Beaver, Servis and tnany othe-r leadet:s in the 1novement appeal. The list of participants also includes Sayford., Schauffler, Pierson, Ewing of India, and 120 other nan1es known throughout the world in connection vvith China, Korea, Japan, Micronesia, Austn1.lasia, South and West Africa, Turkey and North and South America. The aim of the convention is to bring- together carefully selected delegations of students and professors from all itnportant institutions of higher learning in North America and leaders of the missionary enterprise, both at bome and abroad, to consider the great problen1 of the evangelization of the world. These addresses will set forth the ·condition and needs of the world today, and the principles and Hnes of its conquest .for Christ. There will be the most cotnprehensive and carefully selected edu- cational exhibit on .tnissions ·ever n1ade, and a coUection o:f materials illustrative of t<n~issionary problems~ life, and work. It is believed that the educational feature will prove to be one of t:he most vaiuable of the convention. Union is entitled to three delegates and an earnest effort is being ~made to send tbem. Dr. Ray-tnond has promised to send one if the students will send another, and another mem- ber of the faculty has given five doUars toward sending the third. Y. ([\. ~. fL of tt;e {1\ed. TheY. M. C.

There hflve been few more ·~nthusiastic alumni banquets in recent years thart that of the New · England association held oo Wednesday even- ing of last week in llotel 'l\ui:leries Boston. . It . was the fourth annual nteetin;g of the assoc1a- · . tribution to the cause of good scl1oiarship at tion. At the business meeting~, which preceded the banquet, these officers were :el·ected : President, T. C. Hurd.,·~ 5 .. 6; vice-presidents, A. W. Archibald, '72, C ... A. Phelps, '41 ; sec- retary, D. D. Addison, '~g.; treasurer, F. T · Rogers, '8o; executive colllm.ittee, F. G. Noyes, '53, A. L. Bennett\ '87, G .. A. P. Codwise, '82. Daniel D. Addison, '~3, made a splendid toastmaster and the respons-es were excellent. The chief speakers of tl~e evening were the Rev. E. Winchester Donall'<l and Professor Ash- more. \Though I cannot hop.e 1<> be able to fill the place of our excellent p\liesident Dr. Ray- mond,\ said Professor A.:s.bmore, \yet as a member of the faculty of Union university, I tnay hope to be able to te 1 1 t you a few things · about the college at Schen~Cctady, which will prove of interest. In tbe fkst place there is no manner of doubt but that tlte college has gone forward under the admi11i strati on of Dr. Ray- n1ond.\ f D R d ' .d \ ''Speaking o · r. ay.tnon s prest ency, says the Boston Herald of F'eb. 10,\ Prof. Ash- more said that the preside11t had made a signal contribution to the cause ()f the higher edu- cation by introducing at Scllenectady the arrange- ment of the so-called Sallbaiical year, with the difference merely that t:!Ie interval of service between two years spent ·a oroad, is 10 years at Union instead of seven as at other colleges.\ \If Dr. Raymond l1ad. lain down like Rip Van Winkle and slept .()ut the remaining period * H . . •t • Union. * * * 1s achv1 y 1s very great and !1is lo-ve for the college unbounded. His recent decision to decline the pastorate of the Broadway T·abernacle is ~evidence of this, for whatever the critics tnay hint to the con- trary, I know tl01at the dec,ision has cost hitn dear, and ~can be justly regarded only in the light of self sacrifice in the cause of duty.\ Dr. Ash.tnore revi;ewed at ~considerable length the present co:ndi tion of the college and spoke of its needs. \The true indications of developn1ent a~e to be sought in an en- larged equiprnent and not, as many people imagine, in th.'e number of students in at- tendance. * * * * Gentlemen, I have heard alun1ni of Union say that the higher edu- cation needed oRly a log of wood with Dr. Nott at one end of it and a student at the other. The early Greeks used to say that all education, out- side of tl1e gymnasitun, consisted in reading Homer. But there arose among the Greeks later on, wl1en Athens was at the zenith of her power, a man who declared that virtue was not to be sought for in Homer alone. Gentlemen, we need son1etb:ing more at Union than a log of wood and a Dr. Nott. vVe need rnore teachers, more lecture a..Rd recitation rootns., more dor- mitories, more apparatus of evet·y .kind, and we look to you to 11elp us to obtain them.\ Dr. Donald then spoke briefly on the ad- vantages of the small college. . . Among those present were : J. Ba~sett, Provi- dence, D. W. C. Dergen, Greenvtlle,. R. I., George H. Sutton, Spring£eld, Plul~ W. Sprague, Charlestown, Andrew W. Archtbald, Brockton, John W.

4 THE CONCORDIENSIS. The annual tnid-winter meet will be held on the evening of February 2 5, in the Centre street Opera house. If the present interest be any criterion this will be one of the n1ost successful meets here. Manager Cox and Captain Syl- vester are doing their utmost and the fellows are responding splendidly. Arrangetnents have been made with Mr. Pollard so that all those who wish to cotnpete\ for places on the team may take up general training in the \gym.'' in addition to the speciHc training required for any particular event. 'rhe entries up to date are as follows : xoo-yd. dash : Price, Lieut.-Price, French, C., French, S. ; 22o-yd. dash: Price, French, C., French, S., Gutmann, Hanan, Weed; 440-yd. dash: Hinn1an, Price, French, C., French, S., Hanan.

A n1eet has been an·anged for, by the manage- ment, with the Cooperstown Athletic club to be held at Cooperstown. The date of this meet has not yet been decided upon. Our own regular mid-winter meet will serve as a pre- liminary for the joint meet and only those will be taken to Cooperstown who are successful in tnaking a place in the wid-winter m:eet. It is very probable that class cross-col}ntry \ clubs will be fonned early next term. 'Fhe inter-class ra·ce last year was a -great success. To tnake th:ese clubs a greatet· success however, the inter-class race should not be held until after the inter-collegiate athletic n1eet. Preparation for this race is intended to serve as training for the inter-collegiate meet. If the race is held before the meet takes place, as soon as the race is over the men seem to loose interest in the meet and lea\'e off training. This difficulty would be overcotne if the race were held during Comn1encement week. If this could be so arranged it would be very likely to prove a very interesting diversion fron1 the usual Commence- n1ent week programme. f'leeroloQy. GENERAL JoHN CocHRANE, Ex-'31. General John Cochrane, who died in Ne\<v York last week, was a member of the class of '31, but was graduated fro:m Hamilton. He stud.ied law and practiced in Oswego, Schenec- tady and New York. Fron1 1853-7 he was Surveyor of the port of N eV't York, and was in Congress fro1n 1857 to 1861. In r86r he became colonel of the First United States Chas- seurs, and in I 863 w:as made brigadier general., but resigned on account of ill health. The same year he was elected attorney-general of New York, and in 1864 was nominated for vice- President on the ticket with General Fremont, but withdrew in order not to imperil Lincoln's re-election. Later he was alderman and acting mayor of New York, was largely instrutnental in procuring Horace Greeley's nomination in 1872, became a sachem of Tamtnany Hall, and was appointed police justice in New York. He was a member of the society of the Cincinnati. At Dartmouth there is under consideration a plan of increasing the bill of each student $ ro a year, that sum to be devoted to athletics. tl·

tl· I ( THE OONCORDIENSIS. 5 D((atlj of UliHiam pard<(~ 8mit't}. Last Tuesday morning, Williatn Pardee Smith, only son of Daniel P. Stnith of Newark,. a rnen1her of the class of 1901, died of tuber- cular menengitis in the Ellis hospital. The disease had made such a rapid progress wahin the few days preceding hi~ death that the end was not unexpected. The sad news however produced such profound sorrow that at noon all college business w.as closed for the day. But a little over two weeks ago the young tnan cotnplained of violent headaches. The attack was sitnilar to one from which he had suffered a year ago, and it was hoped that no serious results would ensue. His condition 1·apidly became so much worse however, that • his removal to the Ellis hospital was advised. Here he was given a private roon1 and every- thing within the power of physicians and friends to alleviate his suffering, \Nas immediately ren- dered. A Rochester physician had diagnosed the case as one of typhoid, but Dr. Pearson, the college physician, pronounced it tubercular m .. enengitis. The specialists sutnn1oned con- finned the latter diagnosis and it was known that death was but a few days off. The young rnan's fathet· had been sum1noned and he was in constant attendance. .i\.t last death can1e and it brought release from tnuch suffering. The deceased was only a few months over nineteen years of age. He had been graduated with high honors from the Newark acaden1y but last June, having entered college in the fall. He 'vas a tnernber of the Delta Phi fraternity and held high standing '\Vith faculty and students. He was the sole surviving child of his bereaved father. At twelve o'clock on Tuesday, the class of 1901 held a rneeting in the chapel to take ap- propriate action. A con1n1ittee cotnposed of Messrs. Heern1ance, Hodgson, Wagoner. and McNab were appointed to prepare resolutions of sytnpathy and respect. And it was decided to send two representatives of the class to attend the final services in Newark. Ten men were appointed to further repre~ent the class at the afternoon services in the hospital. At a college meeting held for the purpose at 12 :30, ten men were also appointed from each of the upper classes to attend the services. At 2 :30 the brief and itnpressive services at the hospital were led by President Raymond. The remains, accotnpanied by the students in attendance, were then borne to the Central station £rorn whence they were shipped to the home of the deceased in Newark. The bearers of the pall in Newark and in Schenectady were Messrs. Hackett, r 901 , Pur- chase, '99, Crothers, '98, and Haggart, '98, all of the Delta Phi fraternity, and Hartnagel, '98, a life-long friend of the deceased. A chair of An1erican history has been founded at Hamilton. President Eliot of Harvard proposes to confer degrees twice a year. A new fraternity, called Alpha Alpha Omega, has been established at Dartmouth. A \College of Commerce\ has been estab- . lished at the University of California. \ The Senior Dratnatic association of Amherst will take an Easter trip, playing ''All the Cotn- forts of Home.\ The Rev. Williatn Cassady Cattell, D. D., L. L. D., who was president of Lafayette frorn 1863 to r883, died last Friday, aged 70 years. A memorial tablet to the first graduating class at Pennsylvania, that of 1757, vvas presented last Friday morning by the trustees to the college. The n1agazine list of the Syracuse university library has been reduced by the cutting off of twenty magazines, including the Arena, Popular Science Monthly, Atlantic Monthly, and JYI c- Clure's. The National Council of Phi Beta Kappa has sent to all the chapters two resolutions. They are, that it is inexpedient to grant a chapter to any institution which does not confer the degree of A. B. in course, and that men1bership in every chapter shall be litnited to graduates taking that degree. ' ' ! ' ~ ! ;. ,, I t .. I ; I I l ! I '

Burrows, Printer, 41:2 State Street, Schenectady. N.Y. IN the death of vVillian1 Pardee Srnith the class of 1901 and the college at large has lost a valued mernber. The end, corning as it did altnost at the beginning of his college course, at the veJ·y awakening of new povrers anu new n,rubitions, seern~s especially sad. To his father, in n1utual sorrow, tl1e students of Union college exteud their l1eartfelt sy1upatby. EVERY dog has his day. Next week the bolter can fairly revel in bolts. To have 1uade the oc- casion really enjoyable though, t.he faculty should have ~practiced the plensant little ruse of pretend- ing that J~ecitations would be held as usual on the holidays, and then excusing the men each hour from recitation on pretence of sickness or the death of .a. relative. By a trifle Inore attention on the part .()f the faculty to such little things, the students could be made to have a much pleasanter time. WE'VE· hearQ. it said and we believe it to be true that .several of Schenectady's charnling daughters have a bone to pick with the students in general who ll1ake a habit of stagging it to the two or three big dances of the college year. ''Those boys.\ say the fair plaintiffs, \just call and call and eat onr fudges and then when something big con1es along they leave us at l1orne. They're just to n1ean 'and stingy for anything.'' 'This is serious . Who are these fudge-eating rascals that go stag? Are they the ungallant knights who refuse to enter a florist's bill as ''coal\ in the n1onthly report to headquarters? Or are they the undeserving breed that delight rnore in paying athletic subscriptions than cal'riage fare? The party of the first part has a strong case. Let the stagge:cs be known. Out upon theru! '!'HERE is still but little improYement in the financial outlook for the corning athletic season, or perhaps it would l>e just as well to say, the con1ing season for athletics. The prospects for collecting the requisite surn fron1 the students can scarcely be called bright. But while the u1anagers, the athletic boaTd, and the various speakers in the college Ineetings, ar(~ storrning nt the non- ~ubscribers and the u1oderate subscribers, tht>y should not forget the story of a certain widow and her n1ite. \Ve believe that there is not a Juan in college \vho ca,nnot subscribe so1uething. There are not a few who haye subscribed r.nore than they can afford. But there are a great Inany students who, while abundantly able to pay far u1ore than the average undergraduate, pay but the average an1ount per man necessary to furnish the required sum. These men are just as selfish, just as devoid of the saving grace of self-abnegation, as the man 'vho doesn't give a cent; and son1e among this latter class are indeed gems. At times it. seen1s that the \pocket nerve\ is never so hard to touch as when protected by a cushion of long green. Until \ from every man according to his ability\ becomes the actuating principle of undergraduate affairs we need not expect much success in any- thing. We still maintain that there is less discredit in a cancelled gatne than there is in a.n uncancelled

THE CONCORDIEN:SIS. ·debt. And if the· su1n fixed upon by the athietic board is not forthcon1ing within a reasonable period, so far a.s is necessary games with other ··colleges should be canceHed, so that those colleges n1ay have sufficient time to arrange ne\V garnes for the vacated dates. It is .suggested tbat at the coming undergraduate banquet, after the meUowing influence of college ~:Songs and coffee, say, have gotten in their work, that this matter of baseball be brought up, not for consideration but for successful and ilntnedrate settlement. 'V'e believe that the reason those new alumni dormitories do not n1aterialize as rapidly as they should, is that the alurnni asso- ·Ciations hold their business meetings before and not after the banquet. If the child be father of the man,. the undergraduate is father of the alun1nus. And there's nothing like getting started right. The New York State Intercollegiate Ora- torical league, con1posed of Union, Rochester and Syracuse universities, will hold the fourth annual contest in Schenectady, Thursday, Mar. 3· The prelin1inary contest for Union's repre- -sentative was held in the chapel Friday evening. The contestants were Francis Eugene Cullen, '98 and vVillian1 Devvey Loucks, 19oo. The judges were Professors HoHinan, Opdyke and Bennett. Each contestant gave an oration on the satne subject, Napoleon Bonaparte. Mr. Loucks was chosen to represent Union last year .and will do so again this year. \J:'he contest will be held in some one of the city churches. The tnu~ical clubs gave another successful -concert last Friday evening at Amsterdam. The .concert had been well advertised and the many friends of Old Union in Arnsterdam turned out in goodly numbers to welcotne the boys. Their many courtesies were thoroughly appreciated. The concert was a success from both an artistic and financial standpoint. At the close -of the concert the clubs were delightfully enter- tained by W. J. Kline. Charles Stanley Daley, '97, of New York is Yisiting Alpha Delta Phi friends. W. Scott Hunter, '68, is a member of a com- mission to assess the value of lots in the rear of the Albany street school, Schenectady. WiUiatn Howes S.mith, '69, Dr. Herman V. Mynderse, '84, and Ro hert J. Landon, 'So, have been appointed mem:bers of the board of education of Schenectady. At the banquet of the Manufacturer's associa- tion, held recently in New York, Charles En1.ory Sn1ith., '6r, responded to the toast, \Reciprocity and Co1nmercial Expansion.\ ltJ •• In the last nutnber of \'College Life,\ which happy title the undergraduates of the College of En1poria, Kansas, have chosen for their weekly publication, is .contained a list of the ''setni- weekly thetnes\ of the fresh n1an English course as outlined by Prof. John. varl. Schaick. Prof. van Schaick graduated here in the class of '94, and is now Assistant Professor of History and English in the above-natned institution. Beautiful 8l)OUJ. The freshmen took ad\rantage of the partial thavv last vveek: and precipitated the annual snowball fight with the sopbon1ores. No one seetns to know just why so many of the theo- retically and historically bloody failed to put in an appearance. Perhaps it was just a sudden. and corn pelling desire to make recitations. ~'Quien sabe !\as the Spaniard says. At any rate, dropping for a n1on1ent into lingo the com- batants will appreciate, \wot'ell de frosh do but do 'etn ?\ Yes, Russian baths and gelid chatnpoos were scatte1·ed about in lavisl1 profusion. Even the bystanders drew an occasional prize. Some of the specialties were very fine. The entertain- ment closed with a side-splitting parody on setting-up in w h1ch the whole cotnpany took part. The dosing scene was a pathetic little skit representing the fallen heroes being helped over the terrace. . '. )': I ! I' I'

N. J., cashier .of the Hanover National bank of New York city. 'The property is best known as the II unter's Point property and by the sale the coUege parts with its main source of revenue of recent years. The consideration has not yet been ·tnade public, hut is gener.ally reported to be over the miUi:on mark. Dr. Nott became connected with the p·roperty in r 835. His idea was that the governn1ent should build a ship canal between Long Island sound and East river, and use this property as a si:te for a great navy yard and shipping station, and build its shops near by, as there was room and to spare for every use it need be put to. The Governrnent however, failed to comprehend the schen1e and it fell through. The trustees of the college became permanently identified with tl1e p.roperty in 1 86o, when by the }:egislature they were authorized to act as trustee in manag- · ing tl'le whole tract in which. others besides the college were part owners . Over $2,ooo,ooo have been .spent in redeem- ing swamp lands, building docks, bulkheads, streets and highways and improving the. property in many ways. Dividends were made to the various owners. This trust was closed up in 1884, and the property now sold is what the college received as its share of what remained of the original trust. The wise administration of the trustees has borne fruit in the growth of . Long Island city. The most valuable part of which is where the tide ebbed and flowed when Dr. Nott first saw the spot. The hill at the mouth of the creek was moved into tl1e swamps by the Doctor. The building of a school in Sixth street, and the presentation at various times of a number .of lots to the Long Island Ferry company and to Long Island city, were characteristic of his progressive ideas. Even these improvements, it is found, are far from bringing the proper~ty to its proper status of efficiency. The recent purchase will benefit the city inasmuch as the present owner has com- mand of all the funds needed. Tne property originally included the Hunter, Van Alst and DeBevoise fanns, which covered what is now known as the First, Second and Third wards of Long Island city, and the Provost farm, now the Seventeenth ward of Brooklyn. After all the sales and gifts, the college still retained the land where Newton creek empties into East river and 1,100 lots in the wards named. Pre- vious to the consolidation of Long Island city with ·Greater New York, its government was by real estate men said to be such as to discour- age improvement. Nevertheless, though the property will now be more useful than ever be- fore, there is no doubt whatever in the tninds of the trustees that it is a wise move to get rid of it. That it has been sold so advantageously is due most of all to Gilbert K. Harroun, Treasurer of Union College. Mr. Harroun has served in this capacity for five years, and his devotion to tqe interests of the college coupled with his keen business sense and never-failing patience, have several times given a promise of the present splendid business stroke. In 1895, very largely through his efforts, the legislature relieved the college of a large accumulation of unjust assess- ments and taxation. It is not easy to estimate the difficulty both in the administration of the estate and the consutnmation of its sale. When it was known that he had successfully cotnpleted this latest transaction telegrams of congratulation poured in upon him. Long Island city itself has a large unpaid debt of gratitude to him and may regret as much that he is no longer to

All in aB, the present prospects are bright, for the friends of the col- lege, .if the transaction is fully carried out, as seems undoubted, will soon be able to learn the financial .condition of the college in exact te-rms instead of estimated values, and so will know what, if anything, it is necessary for them to do to continue the already long and honorable care~r of their alma mater. UJ'as~iQqtol)'S Birtl]day ·~elebrated. Washington's Birthday was appropriately observed by exercises in the chapel Tuesday morning at ten o'clock. The chapel was well filled and the addresses of the morning were listened to with interest. Judge Landon of the Supreme Court was the first speaker of the morning. He said in opening that the idea was a wrong one that by the war of the Revolution the American colonies threw off the yoke ef Great Britain. They were never under the yoke of Great Britain, but it was their allegiance to the mother country which they gave up. In the colonies planted on American soil the charters were 1i beral, and therein was the germ of personal liberty which rings throughout the Declaration of Independence. The reason for this lies in the fact that the charters were practically drawn up on this side of the sea. England was engaged in civil wars and had no time to give to the matter of the charters of her colonies, and the result was that they were construed just as the colonists wisht\!d. Other settlements followed those of Vir- ginia and Massachusetts and by the end of the seventeenth century the principles of the colonies were fixed. The speaker called attention to the important part that training has played in the development of this continent. In Canada and Louisiana are still evident the enfeebling influence of French colonization, and no better example of Spanish rule can be cited than Cuba of today. This state of a:ffai rs is due to the fact that Spain and France have been slow to learn while the English have been marked by a spirit of progress. \France is still a constitutional monarchy with her president a magnificent figurehead. In Spain, too, is the same characteristic in a different form. There are a few intellectual men in Spain who want to con- vert it into a republic but the people are not yet ready for any such change. '' ·The speaker said that when England triun1:phed over France in 1762, the mother country turned to her colonies in Amer,ica to do her bidding. The colonies. replied that they were willing to do so but only upon their own terms, and thus arose the great war of the Revolution. .Judge Landon said Washington was not .a soldier in the sense that Napoleon was, for he had not the heart to hurl masses of men against each other in bloody conflict as the great Frenchman was prone to do. Washington, however was a great com- mander-in-chief. His great work was to keep his army on foot, and if it were possible he never was the one to begin a battle. The great giory of Washington is in that he did net despair when Congress could not aid him. '' Thne and 1George Washington tired England out.\ ''.He was brave, true, wise, unherolike, not a monster, not a myth, a good mau, one who in his coun.try's war made the cries of his country's fate luminous with better times.'' 'The Hon. Austin A. Yates, '54, had been expected to deliver an oration on \ Our Me1nories of Washington,\ but he was unable to be present. Mr. Edward P. White, '78, kindly consented to take his place. He made a very acceptable substitute. He said that this college and George Washington both stand for union, the union of the physical and moral, of the material and spiritual. There has been too much idealism of Washing.ton. One receives the greatest impression of his greatness in visiting his tomb, yet but a few steps a way the fine estate of Mount Vernon shows him to have been an eminently practical man. Lord Erskine said of him : '' I have had a large .acquaintance with the most exalted class of men, but I never regarded any other man with awed reverence.\ Gladstone said that the character of Washington is the purest in history. The element of character in a single individual leads to union in the state. There are three ele- ments of character-truth, loyalty,~ love. Truth is what each one can grasp of the reality around him, loyalty is truth applied to action, love is the consummation of loyalty. Be always Union men and some of you may yet be ''first in war, first in peace, first in the hearts of his countrymen.'' The Southern Society of New York held a meeting at Hotel Savoy on the evening of Feb- ruary 22, at which Dr. Raymond was the princi- pal speaker. -1,

-1, TfiE CONCO·RDIENSit;. Few lectures in the college chapel have evet been Hstened to with greater interest than that ·. de[ivered by Mr~ W. R. George,. last Friday , aft.ernoon on the· institution founded by hitn and : which is known throughout the United States ; as \The 'George Junior Republic.\ The · chapel was fi.Hecl with students, tn·e·tnhers ·of the · faculty, alutnni, and rnany ladies. That they appreciated the lecture vvas shovvn by the re- peated outbursts of laughter and applause. P1~esident Raymond introduced the speaker in his usual happy style. 1v1r. George possesses an unusually attractive · personality and apart frotn the great interest attaching to the then1e \i\Tas added that of hearing the man himself. He told in very n1odest fashion how the institution was founded, and what vvere its aitns and prospects. The Republic, said the speaker, was founded pritnarily for four classes of young people. First, for the young tough ·who aspires to lead a g~ng, who has a natural leaning to crime, the class that eventually fills the penitentiaries rather than the alms houses. Second, the child whose parents are trying to live without work at the expense of the public, the pauper element. Third, the children of in1provident parents, the habitually thriftless. The fourth class are the little foreignet;,s who know nothing of America , nor her institutions. The Junior Republic is simply the great re- public of the United States in miniature. Every citizen is given an equal chance; and if he fails to 1nake his own way he stays at the bottotn. The doctrine of \he who doesn't work, shall not eat\ is strictly enforced. In other words, t11e bitter experiences of the \rorld at large and the lessons derived therefrom a1·e anticipated. The boys and girls a I most, unknown to them- selves, are educated in all the virtues that tnake for good citizenship. Mr. George is a master o:f east-side dialect and his anecdotes of the citizens of the Republic • were invariably funny and to the p.oint. The 1 ecture was also of considerable sociological value. At the subsequent reception given by Mrs. Ray111{)nd many students and friends of the college availed themselves .of the opportunity to meet Mr. 'George personally. The fourth annual contest of the New Yotk State Inter-collegiate Oratorical league will be held in theM. E. church of this city, Thursday evening,. March 3· Rochester will be represented here by Ira S. WHe, '98, Syracuse will be represented by A. J. Ne.ff, '98, and Union by Williatn D·ewey Loucks, 1900. T'he expenses of this contest are very considerable. To insure financial success the admittance fee has been reduced to the ·merely nominal price of ten cents. The conunittee having the matter in charge have worked faith\ tully and the bright prospects are especially gratifying. prof. Stoller DoiQQ Well. Professor Stoller, under date of January 24, writes a n1ember of the faculty that he is \vell pleased with the opportunities of Leipzig, that he is working in the laboratory adjoining that in which Pollock, '95, now of the Albany High school earned his doctor's degree, and that he is putting in his time in advanced and growingly interesting research work, just as if he had graduated from Union in '97 instead of '84. His family are well, pleasantly located, near the Universitrets Bibliothek, and all are enjoying the rare n1usical advantages offered, especially the celebrated Gewandhaus concerts conducted by Herr Nikisch. Still the American home and institutions have not lost their attraction, and wiU be appreciated all the more on their return. P.

''THE highest aim of American education is the development of intellig-ent citizenship,'' said Presi- dent Raymond at the chapel services last Tuesday; and not one of the many quotable things said that day, is worthier a place in the mind and heart of every man in Union college. It should have a front seat in the theatre of his daily life. From such a spectator, horse-play, in both its special .and general significance, would receive but little approbation. IT was a fine lecture we heard in the chapel last Friday afternoon. It was such a lecture as one could listen to every da:y in the week with pleasure and profit. But apart from those qualities that generally go to the making of a highly entertain- ing and educating lecture, Mr. George's discourse has still another claim upon our grateful remem- brance; for it can be considered in the light of a personal message to every undergraduate. This world would be a dreary place \were there no chHdren in it,'' but th~re is a crying need for men aiso. And there are just ~quite a few of us, who, if purposing to meet the 1atter demand, had better take up training with.0ut further delay. All this means-that when a. lot tQf uneducated children may with impunity be treated as tnen, and some of us keep on. :showing tbat we cannot be-well you may ~draw your owR conclusions. But the question has another side-another deduction may be drawn fPom Mr. George's lecture,. to wit: whe,re chHdren even are treated as men, they act Uke men. ONE virtue that S<tands head and shoulders over the surrounding many in the characters of the students of this college, of some of those at least who live within a radius of twenty miles or so, is an all-conquering and all-else-exclusive love for home. Their home tiies are stout rubber, one might say, stretchable hut non-breakable. When here, these men see1n to be under a constant strain to keep fr01n :flipping back. On the slightest pro- vocation, pop !-.they'regone. And then, oh what a dreary task to make the stretch another time. Some may say this is such a sweet trait, but we call it scarcely heroic. These elastic home-ties have been known to feich young 1nen back to the paternal roof when battles were waiting to be fought in the fore. They have been known to argue against the cotnmend able old custom of shifting for oneself bt proper time. To those who contemp1ate commencing life in earn~st at their cotnmencement, be it in '99, 1900 or 1901, our earnest advice is to cut the rubber now. fHuJnryi rfotes.

·• THE CONCORDIENSIS. 1 o~e Sopt}omore Soiree. 'The fourth annual Allison-Foote prize debate between the Philomatheans and Adelphic societies took place Thursday evening in the :State street lvf. E. church. The two societies had for weeks been preparing for the fray and a lively interest had been aroused among the The last dance that will be held in the Van- ·Curler for many years to come, took place last Friday evening under the auspices of the sopho- .more ~class. They proved themselves delightful ·entertainers and the soiree was one of th.e most brilliant ever given by .a sophomore class. A pleasant and altogether encouraging feature was the large student attendance, over fifty under- :graduates being present. The General Electric people were scarcely represented, and through an unfortunate misunderstanding but few of the Albany 'Social set were present. M()st of the young ladies who are in the habit of attending student dances kept up the pleasant custom and there were many , new faces besides. The floor was a little better than last year and Gioscia's music was a veritable dream. Although Cotburn of Albany, who was the caterer,. failed to .come up to expectations, (his own fault and not the committee's,) it failed to mar the enjoyment ·of the evening. · .. students and the friends of the college. The attendance, however, was small, the church being but half filled. Among those present were the following: Mrs. Webber, Miss Edith vYebber, Albany; Miss Mary Murdock, Pittsburg, Pa.; the Misses Helen Kline, Daisy Phillips, :ivlay Tolley and Anna Stover, Amsterdam; Anna Cady, Anna Husted, Margaret Gould, Margaret Hildreth and Miss Bothwell, Albany; the Misses Lewis, Miss McLeod, Mrs. Barry and the Misses Graves, Syracuse; Miss Mary Shirtliff, Bennington; Miss Gertrude Wilson, Buffalo; J~'Iiss Katharine Pierson, Hudson; Miss Elizabeth Lipe, Palatine Bridge; Chas. Daley, Stapleton; \Ventworth Tucker, Albany; Abe Mor- ris and Davis Shuler, Amsterdam; Mr. and Mrs. J. W. Hogan, Syracuse. From the city were present: The n1isses l{eziah Lewis, Isabelle Beattie, Rachel Yates, Susan Yates, Elizabeth Strain, Eleanor Miller, Elizabeth Curtis, Gertrnde Brown, Grace Walker, Nettie Veeder, Mabel Horstman, Grace Horsttnan, Rosalie Calvert, Madge Campbell, Jennie Palmer, Laura \Villiams, Anna Beattie, Alice Vedder, Hortense Cooney, Bertha Steers, Gertrude Clute, Minni~ Barker, Lena Barker, Henrietta Yates, Mabel Ostrmn, Dr. and Mrs. Carmichael, Mrs. C.

Carey, .Abel Smith, Frank Jackson, Benjamin Burtiss, Ralph Brandow, Will Shaible, Edward Walker, John Vedder, Harry Sommerhayes, F. Paige, Wm. McDonald. Fron1 the college were present: Professors Ash- more, McKenzie, Opdyke and Kay; J. Stewart, C. Stewart, VanDerveer, Nevins, Bender, Miles, Kline, E. Strong, Turner, W.

'The subject of the debate, which had been .announced sornetin1e before, was: ,., Resolved, Th.at Municipalities should be Governed through Municipal Parties.\ The affirmative side was taken by Messrs. George A. Holcotnbe, '98, Perley P. Sheehan, '98, and Willian1 D. Reed, '98, representing the Philotnatbean society, while the negative \vas upheld by Messrs. Walter M. Swann, '98, Peter Nehon, '98, and Williatn L. H. Breeze, '99, of the Adelphic. 1.'he exercises were con1n1enced with n1usic by the Mandolin Club. President Rayrnond then explained the purpose of the debate and st~ted that the judges would be detennined in a warding prizes according to the following con- siderations: Argu1nentative strength of argu- rnents in first speeches, argutnentative effect of the refutation, effect of the delive1·y. The general argument of the speakers of the affirmative was that a city is a municipal cor- poration, and should be governed as would any corporation, for the benefit of the community, not of a g1·eat national party. Because a tnan has opinions on national subjects, does it follow that he is fitted to perform executive functions? The present system implies patronage, and that is invariably conducive to corruption. If men are elected on national issues, the responsibility for maladministration falls not upon the official but upon the party, which means no responsi· bility whatever. In answer to these arguments, the negative admitted that our city government is not what it ought to be, but the method of reforn1 should be of another kind. The city is a business corpora- tion, but not wholly, having state functions. The state and municipality are inextricably interwoven and the state must have the central control, for the local issues are but secondary. There can be no permanent division on local i ' '! i i:l ·' I .I !· i ,. • I I l .I
