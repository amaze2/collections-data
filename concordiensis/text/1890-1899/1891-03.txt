A fine conse rvato:ry and two spa- cious hot-houses were built, rare plants and shrubs, both native and exotic, were culti- vated, and a belt of forest trees planted around the lin1its. As the doctor probably anticipated, the botanical garden soon be- came a feature of public interest and profes- sional utility, and in I8Io the New York Medical Society, the Common Council, the New York Hospital, the State Medical Soci- ety and tnany individuals united in a petition to the Legislature to purchase the garden for the State of New York. As a result, there was passed March I 2, I 8ro, \An Act for the Promotion of Medical Science in the State of New York.\ The Act directed the Commissioners of the Land Office to pur- chase the botanical garden at a fair value of the land, without estin1ating the worth of the plants and trees, and, according to the usual custotn of that day-a custom which, under the present dispensation, would have lodged our godly grandfathers in the lock- up- .. provided raising the necessary funds by ''It was wheN the p1·e:;ent century was hardly mo,re than a score of years old that one Dr. Hosack marked out a garden 01,1 the land now confined between 46th and 56th streets, Sixth Avenue and the East River. When at length he departed to that paradise where botany and blotanists have their apotheosis, he be- queathed his g-arden to Co1umbia College on certain conditions. 1'.he v were to be allowed to erect their new projected college building in a corner of the gar- den, and in re:hJrn for the grant were to see to it that the plantations were kept in good order and augmented as opportunity offered. I blush to say that the college, after taking tile doctor's laud, neglected to carry out his stipulation; they suffered the gat·den to fall to rack and ruin, u ntH ~it became nothing but an unsightly wilderness; and then the rea.l estate cormorants came and we see the result.'' Not being a lawyer Mr. Hawthorne may be excused for attempting to \beq neath'' real estate,. instead of\ devising ' it, but the historical in accuracy of the passage is much more serious. The real facts attending the acquisition by Columbia College bf Dr. Hosack's Eotanical Garden form an interest- ing narrative. In r8or Dr. David Hosack was Professor of Botany and Materia Medica in Columbia College. He \vas an enthusiast in hi~ devo- tion to the former branch of his instruction, and made uns11ccessful efforts to secure from the State aid in establishing a botanical gar- den on Manhattan Island. Finally he unde~­ took the task at his own. expense. He pur- chased from the city for an insignificant sun1, a lottery. The land was afterward appraised at $2, sao an acre, or $5o,ooo. The building and fixtnres were estimated to be worth $2~,300 more, while the $r2,6oo worth of trees, plants, .tools, &c., were not paid for. Thus, for a consideration of $74,300 the title • passed from the thrifty botanist to the State

II2 THE CONCORDIEN:SIS. -- ----- - ~- -~------ -- ----------- - of New York, and Dr. Hosack lived ~con1- fortahly for a quarter of a century thereafter· on the profiJs of the transc:ction. He died in 1835, at the age of 67 years. The prop-- erty was placed by the State under the care of the Regents, to be maintained without further public expense, for the benefit of the medical schooils and societies of the State. In the leg:isl~tive session of 1814 there were a half dozen or more educational or charitable institutions which were vigorously urging their clai~ms for State bounty. The three collegeso.£ the State-C.olumbia, Union· and Hamilton-the latter then just organ- ized, were all in financial straits. The Col- lege of Physicians and Surgeons, the New York Historical Society and other institu- tions had each before one house or the other its separate bill for financial relief. Union College, which nine years before had been granted a lottery of $8o,ooo, was now asking for another one of $2oo,ooo. Columbia Col- lege asked n() lottery, but simply. asked the grant by the State of the Hosack Botanical Garden in New York. Among the rnaster minds of that genera- tion there was n ()t a more skillful, adroit or effective political n1anager than the Rev. Dr. Eliphalet N ott~ President of Union College. He understood men and the motives of human action. i-I e was a character reader and a character molder. His influence upon not only his pupils, but every person with whom he came in contact, was universally acknowledged. No more skillful lobbyist ever frequented the capitol, and no more eloquent advocate ever Gt nfronted a legisla- tive committee than President N ott. He never sought l;egislation in vain. He knew just what he wanted aud just how to get it. Recognizing the value of Dr. N ott's ex peri- ,. enced leadership, Hamilton College, the Col- lege of Physicians and Surgeons, the As bu_ry Church of New York, and the Historical Societyt pooled their issues, withdrew their several private hills, and urged Dr. N ott to incorporate their claims in the Union lottery bill. To this the president assented, and broadened his lottery schetne so as to give Hamilton $4o,ooo. the College of Physicians $3o,ooo, the Historical Society $I 2,000, and the Asbury Church $4,000. This huge gambling device the reverend lobbyist pushed forward so zealously that it was soon advanced to the third reading on the Assem- bly calendar, and was certain to go through. All this titne the Columbia College bill slumbered peacefuHy in con1mittee. It was treated with scant courtesy by the me1nbers of the Legislature, especially those from· the country districts. They were willing to authorize the drawing of lotteries, which conferred benefits upon literary institutions without any draft on the State treasury, and at the san1e ti·me gave their constituents the pleasurable excitement of buying chances in the gambling enterprise, but to grant out and out a valuable property, worth at least $Ioo,ooo, was quite a different matter. The session was drawing near its close. In their extremity the Colun1bia managers swallowed their pride, sought out President N ott and besought him to take up their desperate cause. He hesitated not a mon1ent, but de- clared that whatever was for the good of higher education would receive his hearty co-operation. Although realizing that it would imperil the success of his own n1eas- ure, he consented tv attach the absolute grant of the Botanical Garden to Col urn bia, as a \rider'' to his bill to establish a lot- tery. The bill bad to go back to the com- mittee for amendment, and there, with all the generosity of his nature and all the elo- quence for which he was so famed, the eulo- gist of Hamilton pleaded for Han1ilton's altna n1ater in the same breath with the col- lege to which his own life had been devoted. And he carried his point. The amended bill was piloted safely through both Houses,

Cer- tain books are taken out by students in direct opposition to the rules of the library, and what is more to be regretted, in some cases the books are never returned. We adn1it that at times it is a great ten1ptation to take a book from the library to one's own room, where it may be read at leisure, but the stu- dents should remember that this is a refer- ence library and not a circulating ljbrary, and when the former begins to -change into the latter, it :loses all of its usefulness as a place where books of reference n1ay be found and consulted. Lately there have I I It would not b_e very agreeable to have the rules changed so that, whenever any hook . was \Vanted, the librarian would have to be asked to unlock one of the cases and hand you the hook, and then take :it fron1 you after you had :finished using it and lock it up again. Still this -very thing .may happen un- less the present privileges of the library are appreciated, and the books used as they should he by the students. Jf the studt}nts have any complaints to make concerning the library, for instance, as to the hours during which it is left open, or as to certain periodi- cals which they believe ought to be taken, we feel sure, if a proper request were n1ade by the students to the proper authorities, • that it would at least receive their respectful attention, if it wer·e not granted. * * * \ PATl{ONIZE our advertisers '' is a request which the students of all colleges have often heard expressed in the columns of their col- lege papers, nevertheless we wish to make the request once again. It is true that most of the students do make it a point to make their purchases of men who advertise in their college papers, yet there are a nun1ber of men who do not tetke any particular pains about the matter, ·and it is to them \Ve address our remarks. The merchants who advertise in this paper are just as rel ia- ble, and in many cases .more so, than those who do not, and by thus advertising they show that they have some interest in Union College, and, indeed, it is this very interes.t which goes a great ways toward making it possible to publisll the CoNCORDIENSIS.

Shortly after the riDe of sun The work of d:estruction is alrnost done. On everv side, about and around, v Shattered wrecks crawl o'er the ground Giving out moans of doleful sound. Each man looks (upon my soul) As though he'd been pulled through a small' knot- hole. And the war chiefs gather on every side And count their scalps with an honest pride. The pink chiet thinks it is through too soon And desires to scalp the man in the moon; The lilac chief wears an unruffled air As though 'twere an every day affair; The white chief is willing to take ·::t rest And regards the whole thing as a pleasing jest; The black chief, too, is willing to stop Being tired of seeing the vktirns drop. And so with pleased and triumphant air Back to their wigwams they all repair, To repeat and repe.at the tale of their glory Embellished with many and many a story, Until, after all has been ten times said, They take up their lamps and repair to bed, Ready to get up. the self same day And begin it all over, right away.

EDWARD EVERETT HALE, JR. Harvard, 83. HER PROGRAMl\fE OF DANCE. This little blue card I found on the floor, A record of promenade dances, A mute reminiscence ofd<tys that are o'~r, A witness of dancing romances! This little blue card, all covered with names That breathe forth a gentle reminder Of one among all that fair concourse of dames, Who has left a heart aching behind her; So I picked up the card and put it away With a ribbon, a verse, and a letter, All four of them tokens that speak of the day, That first fatal day when I met her. -rate Record. ALONG THE HUDSO.N. AVERSTRAW BAY is the widest part '·-~· f of the Hudson river. It spreads out at this p-lace to the width of five miles. Sail- ing down through .the centre of this hay, one can. hardly realize that he is two and one-half n1iles from either slioreJ which ap- pears to be but a stone\; throw. On the west bank is the village of Hav.er- straw, noted for its brick-1naking establish- tnents. The upper end of the bay ·suddenly narrows tu half a mile, and on its right bank is a point well known to .every An1erican school hoy. It is-Ston\· Point, where, on the - .I I 5th of July, if 779, General Wayne, with a sn1all number of patriot~, succeeded in cap- turing the fort, taking more than five hun- dred prisoners and securing tb e ordnance and stores- valued at a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Two ·miles farther north on the east bank is the village of Peekskill. Should it happen to be in the month of July or August one would think the place garrisoned, for it is here that the National Guard of New York meets for drill and instruction. There is a tradition concerning .. Peekskill that in revolutionary tin1es there was a si 1- v e r mine in that vi ~in it y called G:a 1l ow:-; If i 11 ; that an Englishman natned B--·nson loaded his ship with the precious metal, and on his voyage to England was lost at sea. In r88 5 · parties claimed to have discovered the en- trance to this n1ine, in the tunnel of which they found mining tools of an old fashioned pattern, from which the handles had rotted away. A little north of this is Kidcl's Point where, according to tradition, Captain l(idd and his crew buried their untold quanti ties of gold and precious stones. To the lover of mountain scenery we have now reached the prettiest point on the Hud- son, the fan1ous \Southern Gate of the ~igh­ lands,'' the right post of which is Anthony's

They read from eight to ten, and Sen1-ester, but only for meeting and settling then have their \gemntliche theH\ fron1 on the winter's proceedings. When I went · in I saw a long tab}e with about fifteen fel- lows ~itting- around it smoking cigars and drinking beer. The German students very seldom sn1oke cigarettes, or pipes as far as I know, except, perhaps, in private. I never saw one. So I sat down by a n1an I knew, and was introduced to one or two others, and drank my beer too. Then can1e up various · n1en who introduced themselves. It's rather funny the way they do this. If there is any one in the roon1 you don't know, and want to, you go up to him and rnake a stiff little . bow and say, \Mcin name ist ;'' and . then go away again. Several men did this to me, and I forgot their names at once, and they couldn't pronounce mine. After a little while passed in this way, Prof. Sievers came in; he's professor of German. Everybody stood up as he c ati.i e in , and then sat down again. This they did also when Prof. Bre- n1er, p·rivat-docent in German, came. 1 hen pretty soon it was time for a song, 1'here . was a man named N ebert, who was a Thali- ten to twelve. * * * * * If ever I am found dead here in Hal1e, I . think it will be on account of the things to · eat. I don't .mean that I disappr(}ve of them or that they are not good, for I enjoy them heartily, but some of them are so strange. I've got well over considering sausage and cabbage in all forms a3 anything out of the way. When I come into the restaurant they bring me the bill of fare and a mug of beer. Now, of course, the bill of fare bas common things on it (like steaks, etc.), but these don't interest me, and I always look at a pJ:ace they call the \Stamus.\ What that means I don't know, but it is a place on the card where they wt ite the things with a pen and ink in- stead of having them printed like the rest. Being written in German, I never have much idea as to what they are, and so generally order something as an experin1ent. So I have had the strangest things-it never en- tered tny mind before that people could eat such things, or rather that they could im·-
