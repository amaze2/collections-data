Burrows, Printer and Bookbinder, Schenectady, N.Y. ~~AST year THE CoNCORDIENSIS offered a ~ prize of $25 for the best college song written by an undergraduate. Although some good production were pres·ented, there were not enough to fulfill the condition ofthe offer, which required at least ten productions by as many authors. On its becotning apparent that there could be no award, the prize was not withdrawn, but the nature of the competition was so changed that an award was certain, that is, it was offered to that member of the college base ball team who should make the gre~test number of base hits in the charnpionship series. This offer stirred up a lively competition, and was no doubt one of the causes which brought the championship of r 8go to Old Union's cam pus. The prize, as is remen1bered, was awarded to M. H. Begley, and was well deserved. THE CoNCORDIENSIS now for a second tin1e offers a prize of$25, for the best college song • I. At least tem productions must be oftered in the con1petitio n. 2. Each production shal:l be not less than I 2 or .more than 24 lines in length, exclusive of the chorus, if one. 3· The songs must breathe the spirit of Old Union, that is,, they must be so far unique or local in sentiment as to render them inappropriate for any other college. 4· Both words and music may be original, or the words alone be original, and be adopted to some fatniliar air. 5. Each song shall be signed by a fictitious name, and be accompanied by a sealed envelope containing the true name of the writer. 6. All songs submitted shall becorne the property of TI-IE Co~cORDIENSIS, or of the person the editors shaH 1nte1:est with the publication of a new song book. On February I, I 8gi, ifthe requisite n~l,;n­ ber of productions shall have been su b1nitted, the editors will examine them, and award the prize by a majority vote of the editors. The envelope accompanying the successful song will then be opened and the prize paid the writer, and the song itself, with the 'true name of the author attached, will be printed il) the following issue ofTHE CONCORDIENSIS. In making the award, consideration will be taken of poetic .merit, rhythm, ar~d adapt- ability to the music accompanying the song, or air selected, and also of the character of the sentiment expressed in the verses. We earnestly hope that there will be a competi- tion sufficient to justify an award. We rnay not have in college a John Howard Payne or a Fitzhugh Ludlow, but we do believe there are more than ten men in college who can write a creditable song. We cannot afford to allow college s'inging to fall into disuse, or neglect to make frequent addition to our col- lection of Union songs.

Monday afternoon, Oct. 27, at Syracuse the Union and Syracuse U ni v~rsity foot ball elevens lined up against each other prepara- tory for the second game of the league. The Union n1en looked somewhat smaller than their burly opponents, who, it had been reported, would \walk right through that Union rush line:'' but they didn't walk right through and \Victory perched on our brows.\ Union started with the ball and gained ten. . yards on the wedge, before Clute was downed. The Syracuse men, in the scrimmage that followed, began . to do some slugging, but finding that the Union men were all pretty good at tha~ sort of thtng, they soon gave it-_ up as a bad job.· .By degrees the ball was · worked down within fi~e yards of the Syra- cuse goal and then P~~kham was sent through -the centre and Union had scored the first touch·down.

The Syracuse men now worked hard to prevent Union from scoring again in this half, and nearly succeeded in their attempt, for Union made a bad mistake which helped the Syracuse men n1aterially The signal had evidently been misunderstood, and Clute passed the ball to the wrong man, who, not being prepared for it, failed to catch it and it was pounced upon by Whitfield who ran fifteen or twenty yards before he was downed by Peckham. On the next play the ball was given to Miller who started to run with it, but was tackled and thrown very heavily by Coons. So heavily, in fact, that the ball slipped from. his hands, and Coons, picking it up, rushed it across the line and the score was zo to o, in Union's favor. Time was called soon after and the first half was over. In the second half the Syracuse men delayed the ga.n1e as much as possible in order to prevent Union from running up a large score and the latter succeeded in making only six points on a touch-down by Briggs, and a goal, kicked by Peckham this time.

Whitfield in the last part of the game, was hurt quite badly and had to retire. Miller, a brother of Miller, Union, '94, took his place. On the whole, Union did not play nearly so good a game as she did two days . before at Clinton.

The Syracuse men who watched the game acted more like a crowd of rowdies and loafers than like a lot of college students. All through the game when Union had the ball, they would yell and hoot and blow tin horns so as prevent Clute's signals from being heard, and most of the time they crowded on to the field, getting in the way of the players and making all sorts of uncomplimentary remarks about Union men in g;eneral, and the foot-ball team in particular.

Burrows, Printer and Bookbitl:cle r, Schenectady, N. Y. ~ VERY commendable cbange has been -=- introduced this year, by the English de- department, in replacing one of the two · essays usually due this t~errn fron1 each of the upper classes, with ~n. extemporane- ous debate on some leading :topic of the day. The first trials of this new idea were suc- cessful in every respect. T'be de bates were carried on with a great deal of spirit, and much latent ability was discovered. Practice in speaking is superior to practice in essay writing, in that it gives one such a command of one's self as is_ needed in the active life of every America11~ citizen. M:any of Union's sons have d,jstiin guished them- selves in the halls of legi s1 ature and in the courts of justice, and a Uv.ely interest dis- played by the undergraduates now in these debates will tend to produ~e rnany more Just such distinguished men. A study of the prominent social questions of the day is of .mach intrinsic value, and the practice of standing up before an audience and expres- sing one's self in clear and forcible:English furnishes just such training as is nluch needed in our colleges. The number of:men in college that have sufficient confidence in themselves to get up and discuss any sub- ject in the presence of a crowd of people, is shown to be very small, by the number of contestants that enter the Veeder Prize Con- test each year. The Veeder Prize i:s the largest in peouni.ary value offered by the college,and the contest is the most interesting to the public, and it is to be hoped that, at Union's next ·~o·mmencement as a result of this new and excellent system of the English departn1ent,a much better and larger compe·~ tetion for the Veeder prize will take plaoe. * * * THE game of foot-ball that took place on the campus on election day, demonstrates the need that exists of having some disin- terested men act as refen~es or umpires in our college games. Although in all probability there will never be ju~t such another case as the one spoken of, where the referee showed such favoritism toward the team representing his O\Vn college, still there will always be some fault found where a man referees or umpires a gan1e between his own ~oHege team and the team of another college. It is only human nature to desire the success of one's college team, and therefore one,in giv- ing decisions in a game will, with the best intentions, perhaps, favor and assist his own team. Union, and doubtless each of the other colleges in our base-ball and foot-ball leagues has suffered defeat tnore than once solely on account of the partiality of the man ~cting as referee or umpire in certain games, and this shows that some change should be made. One remedy presents itself at once, viz: Let each college in the base-ball league, for example, select one of their students to act

FOOT BALL. UNION 0. CORNELL 32. The first foot ball game on the campus this year was played on Thursday, October 30, when Union lined up against Cornell. Union started with the ball but lost it after a few downs, and Cornell then steadily and surely worked it down towards Union's goal and soon succeeded in making a touch-down from which a goal was kicked. The ball was tak- en to the centre of the field and almost im- mediately by son1e splendid running of Cor- nelrs half-backs, a second touch down was made and a second goal was kicked. The Union men now seemed to \brace up'' and played a much harder game. The Cornell team, however, succeeded in making six more points before time was called, on a touch -do\vn and goal. •for which they eould be afterwards ashamed. c.ontrary to the statements of some of the Rochester players, the spectators did not . crowd on to the players' territory until the darkness made it absolutely in1possible for the game to be seen from the edg·e of the grounds, and then they did so without the remotest idea of interfering with the play- ing of either side. It was the referee's busi- ness to call the game before it grew so dark, but he didn't, and hence the result. When the game was over and the outrageous after- ruling of the referee had been given to Roch- ester, some of the spectators, not students, got the insane idea into their heads of doing some personal injury to the referee, and it was the Union men themselves, the very ·men whom the referee had so wronged, w1io argued these people out of this idea. Some people will say that the Union men did only their duty when they thus behaved like gen- tlenlen, but still under the circumstances this was a good deal to do, and the men deserve no little credit for perforn1ing this duty. The second half was much more exciting, and the Cornell n1en had to work hard for every point they made. In this half Union had the ball down very near to Cornell's goal but were prevented from scoring by the fine tackling and blocking of the Cornell men . . CorneJI scored r 4 points in this half on three touch-downs and one goa], making the total score 3 2 to o. * Now that the authorities of the college

Although the above is the score which the referee decided upon as the proper one, of the game on election day between Rochester and Union, there is no one, apparently, who saw the game, who agrees with him. Some of the scores given in the papers tbe next day, as scores that would h~ve been, had Union received the least sort of fair treat- ment at the hands of the referee, were, I 6 to o, r8 too, 18 to 4, and 8 to 6, all in Union's favor. 'fhe daily papers of Schenectady said enough about Mr. Perrine, as a referee, to make it unnecessary for THE CoNCORDIENSIS to enter into a detailed description of his refereeing. Mr. Perrine was simply and openly unjust to the Union foot ball team, to would have been ten or fifteen m,ore minutes to play in this ha'lf. Rochester- started with the ball in the sec- ond h~tlf, but lost ten yards on their first play. Union now had a good chance to add some more points to their score, and they took the chance and made a touch-down, but although squarely and fairly n1ade it was not allowed by the referee. It had now grown so dark that it was exceedingly difficult to distin- guish the players, but the referee would not call the game and so it went OIL It has been said that \darkness covers a multitude of sins,\ and it· certainly did on this occasion. Time and again would a Union man down the ball only to hear the calm, cool voice of the referee cry \ Rocherter's baH, first down.\ Finally Bostwick claimed that he made a touch-down. Daley just as decidedly claimed that he had downed the bail thereby n1aking a touch-back. The referee acknowl- edged at the tin1e that he did not see Bost-
