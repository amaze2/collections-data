No.4· Lite:ttCli!Y· I ·------------- I -------- ---· ... -- - I THE THREE PARTI.ES. ----- A Republican vi·ew. The issues of the present campaign are clear and distinct. The Republican party advocates protection ; the Democratic party I I • denounces it ; the Republican party advo- cates a bill insuring integrity of the ballot . and purity of elections in every State; the Dernocr?ttic party denounces it ; The Repu b- lican party advocates the present tax on State banks; the Democratic party denounces it. And according as the people favor or dis- favor its position with respect to these issues the present adrninistration \vill stand or fall. - When the Republican party, fulfilling its prornis;e, passed in the fifty-first Congress the McKinley bill, the \calamity cry\ was heard throughout the land ; but the \calatnity criers \ have been kept pretty busy inventing ne\V objections to it as one after another of their predictions were proven groundless. has been rernoved and the cost to the con- sunlcr correspondingly lessened. And in return for this the ports of those countries producing the above nan1ed necessaries of life have been opened to our exports. Cereals, meats, tnachinery and other products of this country now find a ready rnarket, free of duty, in the Central and South i\merican countries where less favored nations find corn- petition \Vith us difficult. Through the en- acttnent of this \cu ln1inating atrocity of class legislation\ and \shan1 reciprocity\ hun- dreds of n1illions of gold, that formerly \vas sent to Brazil, Cuba, etc., is now kept at home, and our o\vn products sent in its stead. ls this ''shatn reciprocity?\ The Demo- cratic doctrine of free trade if carried into effect would break do\vn the barrier that pre- vents our factories from being swept out of existence by a Hood of European importa- tions ; it would close our factories (Derno: crats adtnit it), and compel the operative to seek as a l1st resort, agricultural pursuits, there to raise cereals and stock for England in return for clothing made frotn our ovvn ·wool and cotton. The Republican principle of protection and reciprocity bas for its object the fostering of industries of all kinds for which nature has given us tnaterials, and at the same time building up a market for all our surplus products, or in \Vords of Senator Aldrich, \an intelligent application of pro- tection principles leads to greater diversifica- tion of industries, and to a n1ore effective organization of labor, and these to a n1ore rapi~-.l and certain social and n1ental develop- ment, and to the itnprovement and expansion of the productive forces of the country.\ The Republican principle of protection as embodied in the McKinley bill, has proven wonderfully beneficial to this country. Foreign competition in goods that could not be produced as cheaply in this country as in England and other European countries has bee·n shut out. Factories producing these goods have been built in our own country; employment is given to a greater number of men ; trade has been stimula!ed ; wages in many industries have been raised ; cost of the necessaries has been lowered and the pur- chasing power of tnoney increasqd. Is this not a showing that any party n1ight well be proud of? But this is not all. The reciproc- ity provision of that \vorld renowned bill has accon1plished fully as much for the country. l'he duty on sugar, coffee, teas, spices, etc., Some of the Detnocratic papers, seeing the \Veakness of their free trade plank, have tried to make the Lodge bill the chief issue of the

But on this issue, just as on the tariff, the Republican party has taken an . invulnerable position ; it is clearly defined in the follo\ving: '' \Ve dernand that every citizen of the U nitcd States shall be allowed to cast one free and unrestricted ballot in all public elections, and that such ballot shall be counted and returned as cast; that such laws shall be enacted and enforced as \Vill secure to every citizen .... this sovereign right guar- anteed by the Constitution, .... and the party \vill never r elJ.x its efforts until the integrity of the ballot and the p~trity of elections shall be fully guaranteed and protected in every State.\ There is no pyrotecnical cam- paign oratory here. And evidence that the Republican party fulfills its promises is not \Vanting, nor is evidence wanting that the Democratic party does not fulfill its pledges, for, pledged to econon1ize, the present Demo- cratic H ousc appropriated sums exceeding those of the billion ... dollar Congress\ for the corresponding session by fifty millions of dol- lars ; pledged to refonn the tariff it did noth- ing tha~ could be called an honest attempt. The Democratic party especially appeals to broad-n1inded, intelligent tnen. College professors, prominent educators and careful, independent thinking men, of which the late George WiUiatn Curtis \Vas a typical example, are with the Democracy because they have learned to distinguish between logical, well- proven, argun1ents and a mere enunciation of flo\very generalities. Judge G:resham, Judge ·Cooley, ex-Attorney-·General MacVeagh and other Republicans of their ·calibre are sup- porting the Democratic nominees because of their hatred of trusts and .rnonopolies, and . their desire to secure eq ~al rights for all tnankind. Although Republican orators and editors are wildly clan1oring over rnany minor ques- tions, trying to blind voters and hide their weakness upon the tariff and force bill issues, yet these latter are the only important ques- tions at present before the country. A flerfecf system of taxation should be one of the highest aims of every government. To a free people there can come no more im- portant question than this. The Democratic party con tend that the system of tariff taxa- tion laws of the United States are wrong in Does not the Republican party assure us continued prosperity, good w·ages to our \Vorkman, a market for our products, sound currency, an honest ballot, a wise foreign policy and an American marine ? The.n \vhy not let the good \vork go on ? WARREN B. LIPPINCOTT. A Democratic View. In n1a.rked contra-distinction to the evasive, dodging, language of the Republican platforn1 and the quibbling, temporizing, discussion of the issues of the campaign in President l-Iard- son's letter of acceptance, is the plain and ex- plicit enunciation of Den1ocratic principles in . their platform, and the bold, straight forward utterances of ex-President Cleveland, accept- ing for the third time, at the hands of the united Detnocracy, the notnination to the highest office in the gift of the American people. . principle and unjust and unfair to the labor- ing classes in their operation. The question for voters to decide, is vvhether tariff taxes shall be imposed to an oppressive extent for the purpose of fostering private industries and building up vast monopolies which crush the life from the laboring classes, or whether they shall only dra\v sufficient revenue fron1 the pockets of the people to conduct the govern- ment econon1ically and honestly in the good old Democratic way. The Republican policy of collecting mil- lions of dollars of revenue nore than is needed . . , is certainly not in accord with sound princi- ples of govenunent. Such: a policy encourages extravagance and dishonesty an1ong public officials, creates \ billion dollar , congresses and n1akes possible vast grants by the party

Such a measure \Vould so in trench the posi- tion of the party in power, as to n1ake their dislodgn1ent impossible but by n1eans of a bloody revolution. Our people are too jeal- ous of their liberties to entrust po\ver to a party pledged to a n1easure that will take con- trol of affairs frotn their hands, disfranchise a large portion of them, perpetuate the control of a party of n1onopolists and their allies, and in the language of the Democratic platform, \ practically establish a monarchy on the ruins of the Republic.\ With the record of its past achievernents standing out as bright and shining pages in th~ political history of the nation, \Vith a plat- form contending for principles that n1ake for the welfare of \the tnasses, not the classes,\ and \Vith candidates of kno\vn honesty, in- tegrity and ability, the Democratic party A Prohibition V~l.ew. The advocate of a third party in An1ericart politics, labors under great disadvantage. He must not only force his issue, but must first prove his right to exist. Political prejudice is so strong and unreasoning, that the great rnajority of citizens cannot conceive the right of separate political action, and need to re- learn the truth of the absolute political free- dotn of the individual. I say this, apologizing for using indirect argu tncn t ; for 'vhile the Prohibition party needs no apology, I would reach if possible the prejudiced masses. If then a reason be necessary for leaving the old parties, I hold that they are un\vorthy of support by the thinking citizen. Jugg-ling with the tariff, they refuse to face the inl- portant questions of the day, seetningly striv- il1g for party success or personal aggrandize- nlent, until the vvords of President Harrison receive added significance : \The only \vay to get satisfaction out of a public office is to please yottrself \vhile you are in it.\ Th.e size of the liquor question is uncon- troverted. Its po\ver lies in politics, defended by law. I-I ere its enen1ies tnust meet it to do battle. The practicability of prohibition, \Vhile questioned, cannot be successfully denied ; its victories are too great, its results too plain, though we have only tried local and state pro- hibition- very unsatisfactory forn1s. Given thcs~ as facts, the existence of the National Prohibition party is a logical ne- cess:~y; not an ''inexcusable organization.\ The liquor po\ver, not the Prohibitionists, made the issue \vhen in 1868 the Brewer's Congress voted to enter politics.

Dear shade! 'tis not that thou wert orator, And oft V{ert eloquent Ll dissuade ftotn \vrong, Or give a statesman fame more during, nor That at God's Altar thou didst serve so long A faithful priest, that most we praise thee here, But, that to Youth you showed his way so clear. -A ndrrzv J-featl ey Green, '49· '.I i>• l ~ .,. i· ,.

The life of Mr. Erastus Wiman, of N e\v York, is proof of what a poor boy can do by industry, honesty and perseverance. He was born in a village near Toronto. In the summer he 'vorked in the fields for fifty cents a week; in the winter he picked up a· scanty school education. His best education was in a print- ing office in Toronto, where he obtained employment at the age -of fifteen. In due tip1e Mr. Wiman became a member of the staff of the Toronto Globe, one of the best newspapers in Canada, and was n1ade market reporter, in which he achieved signal success. On one occasion his figures on the wheat shipments of Toronto were disputed by the custom-house people, as he made the business of the city in this direction much larger than the custom-house would admit, but he proved he was right, and gain.ed such a marked victory that the Toronto Board of Trade presented him with a watch in token of their appreciation. The genius of young Wiman for figures and accounts led to his selection as a clerk in R. G. Dun & Co.'s Mercantile Agency in Toronto, and so well did he conduct himself that in r86r he was put in charge of the entire Canadian business, with headquarters at Montreal. He was so successful that in r865 he was called to the New York office, where his rare business qualities brought him rapidly to the front. He had a salary of $5,.ooo a year at that time-to-day his in- come is not less than $roo,ooo per annutn. The Agency had then sixteen offices, while now it has one hundred and thirty v;ell established and thoroughly equipped branches all over the land and in Europe. Mr. Wiman has become virtually the working head of the entire Agency, whose revenues have increased to $z,5oo,ooo annually. Mr. Wiman has a gift for business, for amicable '77· Rev. George Fairlee, of Lansingburgh, delivered an interesting lecture on Alaska, at the Memorial Presbyterian church of Troy recently. Mr. Fairlee made a trip through that wonderland last sumn1er and \\as an adjustment of difficulties, and for consolidating hostile interests. For instance, he found two tele- graph lines in Canada. There was a need of con- solidating th€m, and he ttndertook the task. The affair turned out to be a tremendous success, and Mr. Wiman tnade reputation and money by his connection with the enterprise. He is a director of the Western Union Telegraph Company, and controls the entire Canadian system of which he continues to be presi- observing tourist. '65. A short account of the life of Rev. Dr. S. B. Rossiter rnay be found in the October nun1ber of the University Maga~<Ji1le. Among other things it says : \ En1inently successful, dent. In recent years Mr. Wiman has given much atten~ tion to the development of Staten Island, which he

20 TBE CONCORDIENS1S. terms \the grea:est st.b:1rb, of the greatest city, of t~e greatest country in the world,\ and has amassed a fortune of several million dollars. He is president of the Staten Island Railway, and controls the ferry which acts in conjunction w1th it. He won consider- able fame by ousting the Vanderbilts fron1 their long· continued control of this their native place, and vigor- ou~ly set about to improve it and raise its value. He proposes to afford facilities along the \vestern shore of the harbor and the Kill von Ku11 shore for wharves and warehouses to meet N cw York's great need of storage and warehouse facilities, and also n1ake the island a trunk line railway terminus. He has just completed the Arthur Kill Bridge at a cost of half a million, the authorization of which he got from Con- gress in the teeth of the combined opposition from the State of New Jersey, the Pennsylvania Railroad, and other great forces difficult to combat. Mr. Wiman has inaugurated large amusement enterprises · on the island, which are daily and nightly patronized by thousands from the metropolis. This he has done for the purpose of giving his lines of transportation a traffic when not otherwise employed. He is very fertile in resources, and is continually developing new schemes, one of which is an insurance arrangement by which houses are put up for $r,soo a piece, rented to workingmen for three hundred dollars a year, and surrendered to the widows on the death of the lessees. or deeded to the lessees after a certain number of years. Mr. Wiman is also one of the managers o± the scales and other mechanical devices operated by the dropping in of a five cent piece, and is interested in other enterprises. He is about fifty years old, and his family number two daughters and four sons. He Regular Junior Folding Daylight Ordinary · has a fine ho1ne at N e\v Brighton, Staten Island. Like most men of large enterprises, Mr. \Viman is careful in his personal habits. He neither drinks nor s1nokes. He is fond of horses, and. has several good roadsters. He \\Yorks early and late. In n1anners he is genial and unpretending, and in c01nmercial skill · and financial acumen is unquestionably one of the notable men of the times. AFFAIR De COEUR.

In temperament he unites the good nature of the Dutchman with the shrewdness of the Connecticut Yankee, and the energy of a flash of lightning. In his business career he represents the largeness of the opportunity_ which comes to the An1er'ican youth. The circun1stances of his early life indicated that destiny had in store for hirn no higher position than that of a thriving druggist in the srnall village of Fultonvilie, near which he 'vas born about the beginning of the second quarter of the present century.

The second league gatne \Vas played No- vember 7, on Union's campus, and frc:>m a Union standpoint \i\'as completely satisfactory.

It rained slightly at first tnaking the ball vvet and causing n1any fumbles, but the r:.tin ceased soon after the gatne had been called. Brown tnade the first touch-down through the centre after long runs by Braman and Lavery, '95. Smith failed in his trial for goal. Score, 4 to o. Rochester started vvith ball but losing it on four do\\.rns, Braman carried it around the end and ran half the length of the field for a second touch-dovvn. Again Stnith failed for goal and the score was 8 to o. The rest of the first half is a repetition. No more touch-downs were made by Bran1an and Lavery,95,and one goal was kicked by Srnith, making the score r 8 to o at the end of the first half. Our men had no trouble in getting around Rochester's ends, Braman especially making fine gains. Once or t\vice Rochester tried to gain on the ·wedge, but could not budge the Union centre. tucked it safely under his arrn, and journeying over 70 yards, dodging the entire Rochester eleven made a touch-down. Srnith kicked three goals in this haU, mak- ing \Vith the four touch-downs a total of 40 points to Rochester's zero. Union outplayed her opponents at every point, but especially in the matter ·of inter- ference. Brarnan's tnagnificent sprinting \vas the feature of the day.

The third lecturer of the Butterfield course, Erastus Wiman, was introduced by Dr. Ray· n1ond, Friday afternoon, Nove1nber 4, in the college chapel. In the course of his intro- ductory ren1arks the genial president of our alumni association said : \There is a certain an1ount of anoyance in the way vve residents of the United States have in calling ourselves Atnericans to the exclusion of all others. I doubt not that Gener~l Butterfield thought we needed a lesson in geography and, there- fore, vve are to hear this afternoon of son1e people vvho will vote for neither I1arrison nor Cleveland next Tuesday. We are to learn respect for the great country north of us, re- spect for its citizens and for a tnan who, as editor, financeer and, best of all, a n1an pos- sessing genuine Arnerican enterprise, is highly deserving of our respect. I take great pleas- ure in introducing Hon. Erastus Win1an.\ Then can1e the lecture on \Canada and the Great North Land,\ and is, by no means, underestin1ating the value and interest of the preceding lectures, \vhen it is said that that of Erastus Wiman surpassed then1. The hour and a half that follo\ved was literally a \feast of reason\ and not a dull sentence. Mr. Wiman went over in detail the geography resources, citizens and political relations of our neighbor in a superlatively interesting style. · Wit and information, con1pounded and con- densed made Erastus Win1an' s lecture one to be remembered, and one by vvhich to profit by all those fortunate enough to possess the necessary qualifications to gain admittance to a Butterfield lecture. Our next lecturer is a Union alutnnus, class of '49, Hon. Frederick W. Sevvard, and his subject will be\ The Diplon1atic and Consular Service.\ One of the greatest favors you can do your college paper is to patronize its advertisers. QUOTATIONS. Union College men did not appreciate our little burlesque on their college ycl1.-Troy PolytcL\hJlz{:. Union was the only college represented by a special boat in the Colun1bian nayal paracle at Ne·w York.- Oca{len t (University of California). The fourth issue of TIIE Co:\coRumxsrs appeared yesterday. The paper contains m.any '' ne\vsy\ arti- cles written np in a very attractive style. The editors are to be con1n1encled for their industry and for keep· ing THE CoNcoRDIENsrs ·where Union College is at the present ti1ne- at the front.-Schenectady Star, No- vember 4· For the first tin1e in the history of foot ball at the University of Rochester, Union and Rochester have met \vithout disgracing thetn~elves. Two years ago the referees in both ga1nes \vith Union can1e very near being n1.obbed, and it was but little better last year. This year, ho\vever, Rochester can surely have no complaint to make of the treatment she received at Union. Union outplayed her opponents at almost every point, and Rochester should learn a lesson from Union's beautiful interference and blocking.-Roches· ter Htrald, November 8. \ Annexation is unnecessary, undesirable, and, under present conditions, impossible,'' said Erastus Wiman yesterday in his admirable address before the students of Union College. \Vith no pretensions to oratory, :Mr. \Vin1an has a wonderfully entertaining and forcible faculty of imparting to his hearers all his enthusiasn1 in behalf of his native Canada, and yester· day he gave the young men at Union a picture of the n1arvelous resources and latent energies of the great Northland, which needs only the enterpise and the capital of the Yankees and the pulling down of the fence between the countries to 1nake Canada bloss01n as the rose. \Con1n1crcial unity, not political unity, is the present policy for both countries,\ said Mr. Wiman, ''and the question of annexation may be left for the future. \-Jf ail and ~\press, J.Y07.Je;nber 5· Though we did not win the game against U nio11, yet we put up the best game \Ve have thus far this season. Our n1en did well and they showed that vdth the right training they wonlcl accomplish \:vonders. It is practice that tnakes the LTnion men strong. The rnanager of that eleven remarked that as a rule his men lined up in their practice game against twenty· five or thirty opponents. This gives them sharp con1- petition and makes thmn good players. Syracuse needs more men on the field to combat. Our tean1 this year did better than the one of last year in the Union gatne. Then \ve \vere beaten 72 to o. This year the score is 52 to o, a gain of t\venty points in our favor. We should not be discouraged since in all probability Union has the strongest team in the leagne.- [lnh'cr sz'ty .i'Verzus (Syracuse).

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 1 1 =====================================================:---=:':.:=-=--::: __ ---- -- -------- =======::::::::::::===-= The foot baH season is over. One thing I rnore remains to be done. PAY your sub- scription. Union has the largest alun1ni association in New York city-larger even than those of Yale and 1-I arvard. The opportunity to listen to such lecturers as Erastus \Virnan is not given to everyone. It is a great advantage to be a Union College student. A good glee club can do as n1uch for acol- lege as a chan1pion foot ball eleven. Why should Union's club not take a trip as those Union has \von the pennant and Cleveland of other colleges do? has been elected president. It is a month of great ,events. Some anin1als pass the long winter in sleep. Not so vvith 1\'HE CONCOROIENSIS ; we shall be a wake all the time. There are over 300 Union alumni in the city of Schenectady and ten of them take THE CONCORDIENSIS. It is rumored that the sophon1orcs will pro- test against the n1ovetncnt to put lights in the sections. Wonder, 'vhy ? We want every alumnus subscriber to con- sider himself a comn1ittee of one to send us all the ahanni personals he can gather. In the happy future, when \Vork on the Union college paper counts as regnlar college vvork-vvell, it's a long \vay off, that's all. Colgate is like J an1es G. Blaine. They can both say : \If \Ve had been in it, the result would have been different.\ Perhaps so. A colun1n of quotations is our latest feature. The1~e n1ay be read whatever the other college papers and the daily press have to say about us. Congratulations all around are due on the Rochester gan1e. Captain Knight of the Flour city says they were never beaten tnore fairly. Will the office of editor-in-chief of THE CONCORDIENSI~, in the class of '96, go a-beg- ging ? It no\v looks as if it might be had for the asking. Where are the ;Freshmen jour- nalists ? The Albany Argus publishes coliege ne\vs in its Sunday edition. Three colleges vvere represented in the issue of N oven1ber 6 : Yale with three and three-quarter inches; Harvard ·with six inches, and Union 'vith fourteen inches. vVhat's the matter ,vith the press club? At the last college meeting Glen, '93, and Cooke, '94, were appointed a con1mittee to endeavor to procure better library facilities. We print in this issue their recotnmendations, and add that we heartily approve of the same and hope the faculty ·will regard the matter favorably. --------------------- BRYN MAWR COLLEGE, DEPARTMENT OF POLITICAL SCIENCE. BRYN MA\VR, PA., Nov. ro, r8gz. EDITORS OF THE CONCORDIENSIS : Permit n1e to send \vith n1y check tny hearty congratulations on the excellent work you are putting into THE CONCORDIENSIS. Recent numbers have been by great odds the best college papers ever issued from Old Union.

' I . i '· ,, ' l 12 THE CONCORDlENS!S. --- ---------·- - . ---- ·----- ---- PROPOSED AMEND:MENTS TO THE RULES A.N-0 • REGULATIONS OF THE LIBRARY. I.

There should be a sin1ple arrangement of the books and a reliable catalogue. 6. Students should be permitted to dra\v books from the library. \An~ong the first of the privileges to be granted to students is that of carrying books to their rooms, to be used there. The objection that books are not in the library when wanted for reference can apply with force only to a very limited nutnber, \\vhich it is customary to reserve from the circulation. \Vhat is -vvanted is the greatest possible benefit frotn a library, b:.1t a large percentage of its n1ost useful books will be of very little account to young men, if their use is to be confined to a public reading room. \-Professor Robinson, Librarian of Rochester lhziversity. By such an arrangement, books are seldon1 lost. \The number of books lost during the year was 85, or about r to every 9,ooo of circulation. \-R tport of Boston Public Library for I875· 7· Dictionaries, Cyclopedias and other works of reference should not be ren1oved from the library under any consideration. 8.

The plan of each Junior is to pretend [Read at the class banquet, October 3.] We are gathered here on this memorable night, After 1nany a caution, ancltnany a fight; Having kept our tnouths closed all day long, For fear the Sophs \vould get on to our so:1g ; But notwithstanding every fear, That he is the Freshman's warmest friend, And when a Freshman comes into college, He first ilnparts to him some knowledge. He says: \You must be 1neek and humble, And never against a Soph01nore stutn ble; Don't wear patent leathers or carry a cane, For if you do, Dennis is your name.\ As is the custom, fr01n year to year, We, the officers, of the Freshman class Have cotne to touch glass to glass And drink good luck to every member, Who entered our class on last September; And since our president has not been taken Far out of the city and left forsaken, And our little toastmaster is here, as a whole, Not having been tied to a telegraph pole, We can laugh and sing and have a good time, Since at the Edison vve dine. We excel '95 not only in size, But also are first in ways otherwise ; vVe have foot balltnen of wonderful fame, Who are adding great honor to our nam,e ; We can place a ball nine on the field, vVhich to the Sophs will never yield ; And in ways too nutnerous to tell, The poor old Sophs we do excel. But if we look back five score of years, And to words of wisdom turn our ears, We should gain some wonderful knowleclge- vVe are the one hundredth class of this college; So why should we not feel quite elated, Since such a remarkable fact has been stated. Of '96 we will say no tnore. But turn our attention to '9-1-: Regular Junior Folding Daylight Ordinary But then he says: ''Don't you think 'twould be right To bring some grapes to my ~om to\'night ?'' Then after telling him numerous things, He says good-bye and takes to himself wings; The freshman then with nary a fear, Says I'll bet he is the nicest man here. But notwithstanding this little story, The Junior is worthy of all his glory, And we welcon1e him here to eat and drink, Expecting to hear him speak I think. Now knowing that speeches will follow to-night, Which will knock this attetnpt way out of sight. With a Rickety, Rickety, Rickety, Hix, I close the ode of 'g6. R. B.

As noticed in the last issue of THE Co~­ CORDIENSIS, a strong effort is being made on the part of son1e enthusiastic students to re- estabEsh one of the old litcr::try societies of the college. That their action met the ap- proval of n1any was shown by the large at- tendance at the n1eeting held S:::tturday even- ing, N ovembcr 19. The revised constitution \Ve are glad to see the Adclphic re--organ- was presented and adopted; after which many ize. Let the Philomath ean do the same .. · students enrolled themselves as members. There is room for both and the Butterfield , Dr. \Vebster and Professors Ripton, A. society also. \V right and Mosher, were present and spoke a.t some length, urging the advisability of Union professors arc in den1::tnd everywhere .. When the National Board of I-Iealth \Vantcd · a chen1ist to send to the C·ity of IVl:exico they chose Maurice Perkins. We have an excecding1y ef-ficient gytnna- sium instructor and a \v-eU-equipped gymna- sium. Every man in college should avail hin1self of these privileges. vVork on the recognized college papers of the University of Penns)'l vania excuses the editors fron1 a certain an1ount of college \Vork. The Cornell Sun says that this is\ as it should be.\ We \von't say \Vh1t rz.ve think about it. So1nethi ng depends on class-roon1 vvork. Foot ball elevens and base ball nines, glee clubs and literary societies, not even ne\vspa- . pers, can n1ake a college. These things are all valuable as adjuncts,· but something more is needed. It is a good titne of year to think ab::>ut this. reconstructing the society. rfhe next I11eeting \Vill be held Decetnber 3, \vhen the\ Force Bill,., \vill be discussed. NoVE1iBER 22d, 1892.

The first tneeting of the Shakespeare club will be held Friday evening, Decen1ber 2, in Professor Hoffman's roon1. Officers for the year will be chosen.. rfhe \Tetnpest\ is the play to be discussed. The following is the progratnrne : E. Burke, '93 : N arne several prominent ideas of the play. What seems to you t1le leading idea? N an1e as many parallels as possible between the government of Prospero and the providence of God. How does Shakespeare at the outset indicate the character of the issue and \vhy? By what n1eans does he make the enchantment secn1 real ? Morey, '93 : Are the supernatural conrses of action at all dif- ferent fr01n the natural ones? What do the internal evidences show as to the stage of Shakespeare '.s genius ? Show the respects wherein this drama adheres to the classic model. \Vhat is represented by Ariel? By Caliban? \Vhat problem of civilization is presented in there- lations of Caliban and Prospero? IIow is it treated? Lynes, '94: \Vhat sort of use does Prospero n1ake of his po\ver? Is the conclusion strictly accordant with justice? \Vhat does it snggest as to the government of the world? \Vhy arc obstacles placed in the path of Miranda's affection for Ferdinand? \Vhat is the effect of the drama as a whole on onr me:1tal state ? Is there any characte1·-development?

THE CONCORDIENSIS. I 5 Perkins, '94: \¥hat is the lesson involved in Caliban's worship of ' Stephano? In the mocking of Antonio with vanish- ing banquets? Vlhat does this drama reveal as to Shakespeare's qualities .of heart? Quote so1ne of the finest passages. What very effective employment of narratiol1 oc- . curs?
