l = ll • • The CoJlcordicJlsis VoL. XXII. UNION COLLEGE~ FEBRUARY 4, 18:99. No. 15 .. Mr. A. A. Anderson of New York city .de- livered a lecture in tl1e chape~ Friday afternoon, January 27, on the subject of, \Art.'' Mr. Anderson has travelled a great deal during his lifetime, having visited every pa1t of this country and spent a nutnber of years abroad in the stu<ily of his profession and in recreation. He is tl1:e:11e- fore well fitted to deal with his subiect which he discussed in so delightful a manner as to finnly impress upon his hearers his intense love for the beautiful things of this world. The lecture opened with a striking illust\l~a­ tion of the origin of art. ''Many thousands of years ago a prehistoric man set out frorn l1is cave to hunt. Cotning to a bit of water, :11e suddenly stopped and looked anxiously ahead. In a moment there appeared frotn the forest iu front of him an enormous tiger. The tnan vva.s afraid, for he knew that a few tnoments would decide the question of his future existence. Th.e tiger stopped, glanced ahead, bowed his head to the water, raised it, hesitated and passed <>n. The savage, tre1nbling, sought his cave. Thel'e, with a rough piece of rock, he traced laborious- ly on a smooth one a drawing of the tiger.\ '~I was not present at this meeting,\ said NI. Anderson, \but nevertheless it really did happen. The sketch is very poor in fact, bat, as a specimen of art exhibiting the drea~ed powers of the tiger, it is fine. It is not an exact representation of the beast but is rather a copy of the impression which the animal left upon the mind of the frightened savage. It is to day preserved in a Paris museun1 and is the oldest specimen of art in the world.\ Man first supplies the necessities of Hfe ; later, its luxuries. One of our early ancestor~, in searching about for sotnething more pract,ical than his hand wherewith to drink, found a gourd and cut it, using it for his purpose. When time became somewhat heavy on his hands, be decorated the gourd, cutting its ex- terior into pleasing fo1·1ns. 'This action was art ; the other was handicraft. Thus came the evolu- tion of the modern cup and saucer. Likewise the savage's tent of skins has developed into the millionaire's palace of today. That noted example of beauty, the Boston public library, is but the highest point yet attained in that art originating in the simple carving of his treasured musket by the Puritan father. \Art pursued for art's sake is debasing in its influence.\ The Japanese art of today is a striking instance of this statement. Ancient Japanese art consisted of the highest decorative art the world has ever known. The artist drew his impressions directly from nature. He went out into the woods and there made his sketching. At hotne he cast these impressions into bronze and returning to the fot·est clothed his work in the colors of nature. When this was finished, he hollowed the object out and presented it to his chief. After a time the foreign demand for oriental goods became so great as to cause each product to becotne 1nerely a copy of another which preceded it. \Japanese art declined be- cause in descended into mere craftmanship. As soon as art ceases to go to nature it ceases to exist.\ ''Art is an illusion within one, not a delusion. An artist wishes to n1ake the same impression upon the looker-on as does nature itself.\ Art had its real beginning in Egypt. Thence, crossing the Mediterranean and settling in Greece, Rome and Italy, we see its rapid develop- ment marked in the ruins of the Parthenon and the cities buried under the ashes of Vesuvius. It had its use and decline, but during the period of the Renaissance it burst forth in all its splendor throughout all Europe. Today it is sweeping on in a wonderfultnanner. A little boy when questioned as to the differ- ence between electricity and lightning said ;

6 THE. OONC'ORDIENSlS'. ''One you pay for-the oth,er you don't.'' We tnay never have the opportun~ty of seeing great specitnens of art in foreign lands but we can see what i:s better still-nature itseif. '''A botanist is :·not necessarily a lover of flowers. It is not necessary for us to :have a knowledge of botany or other kjndred sciences to appreciate nature. A savage is unmindful to his surroundings how- ever beautiful. Knowledge cornes not from the nutnber of books we read but £ron1 what we get out of them. The san1e thing is true r.egarding nature.\ It is on the young tnen and wom:en of the present that the future of our native land de- pends. If advances in culture and civilization are to be made, they tnust be preceeded and ac- con1panied by research of our youth into those studies whose influences are so broadening- literature, poetry and art. Said Mr. Anderson in closing: '''Nature is the source of all true art. To this nature I co-m- tnend you. Go to her. Look at her, not only with your eyes but with your soul and some day you can truthfully say-' It's a very pretty world.'\ <St)e Day of pr aye:r. On Thursday, Jan. z6, the regular college work was suspended, in order to observe the day of p1·ayer for coBeges; accordingly, devotional exercises were held in the college chapel at half · past ten. The service was conducted by Dr. Raymond assisted by Rev. Dr. Pendleton of this city. The speaker was Rev. William Force Whitaker, pastor of the First Presbyterian church of · Albany. The chapel was well filled with students, members of the faculty and invited guests from the city who listened to a fine and highly in- tellectual discourse appropriate to the occasion. Music was furnished by a quartet composed of Greene, '99, Wiley, '99, Eatnes, '99, and Barrett, 'or. Dr. Rayn1ond in introducing the speaker re- ferred to Dr. Whitaker's church as having special interest and connection with Union as it was ft·om this ch.urch that Dr. Nott was icalled to the presidency of Union college. Dr. Wb[taker took his text froni the sixty- fifth Psalm,, second verse, \'0 thou that hearest prayer unto thee shall all flesh come .. \ He first showed the effect of the two uses of mu·scles, one for the external effect and the other for internaL So p1~ayer may have two effects ; on the inner life of man and on his external power. Old scientists said that prayer was good spiritual gymnastics, but belief in its utitity was absurd. Later it was thought that prayer and natut·e were incons.i·stant, for when prayer asks for any- thing contt;ary to the laws of nature it goes be- yond the realm of possibility, but the scriptures affirm that natural law is God's law. People are apt to overlook sotne phenomana for we find every day a vast amount of facts with which physical laws have little or nothing to .do. The will of m.an is free and is constantlv utiliz- \' ing and controling the laws of nature. Man's free will is the starting place of all events, and it has been that will vvhich has set in motion the machinery which has brought about aU the can1- paigns, battles, defeats and victories in the world's history. On the decision of one man's choice has depended the outcome of great under- takings. A whole chain of events may have its beginning in one rnan's will. It was owing to the decision of one man that Fort Sumter was fired on and the great civil war begun. God's v.v-ill is the Teal source not only in 1natter and space, but also in the lives of all 1nen. If there is a God and if his will is able to alter nature's law we need only add that eletnent of benevolence in God to substantiate the fact that the will of God mu~t adapt human things to the best interests for the good of his children. Know God. Or what will be our destiny if we do not follow out the teachings of the Old and New Testatnents and make use of prayer? If we do not use prayer how much better .are we than the other living beings? Man is a small speck compared with the great laws of the universe, but his soul like the carrier pigeon finds itself in the midst of the greatest elements of the universe, but as when it has the instir:ct of ~rayer it easily surpasses all elements, so w1thout 1t the elements will surely triumph. \0 thou that hearest prayer unto thee shall all flesh come.\ \)\ havt wiU reco who T hav( it is on' posl por1 in il .A that of t!l that .

THE O·ONO.O·RDIENSI8. When the nex.t issue of the Concordie.nsis wiU have .tnade its appearance the SophotnoJje Soiree , wiU be a thing ofthe past,.exceptforthepleasant ! recoUection of it left in the memory of those who ·were fortunate enough to attend. There is no doubt in the tni:nds of those who have .attended this dance in previous years that · it is the crowning event of the social season and on this accotant every fellow in coUege who possibly can, ought to t:nake every effort to sup- port this function and get his friends interested in it. Although some, pessimisticallyinclin;ed, affirm that Metnorial Hall can not be heated, several of H1,e older and tnore experienced professors say that it has beeu done before now and H1at there is no reason why it can not be tnade warn'l enough for this occasion. The n1embers of the committee have worked faithfully and a1·e giving their whole titne and energy to mal\e the affair a success, and the students ought to appreciate their efforts by sup- porting the dance in every way possible. T'he class of 1801, in holding its soir:ee in the Round Building, is following the example of neat·ly every college in this section in holding the college dances on the college grounds. This plan ts an in novation at Union and ought not keep anyone away. On the contrary, it ought to bring out a great n1any more fellows than usuaL Gioscia will furnish the 1nusic and this fact alone speaks fo1· the success of the dance. Owen of Utica will furnish the re£reslunents, and frotn the satisfaction he gave at last year's Senior ball we know that he will be appreciated. The patronesses of the dance will be =~ Mrs. A. V. V. Raymond, Mrs. 0. H. Landreth, Mrs. J. H. Stoller, Mrs. J. R. Truax, Mrs. T. W. Wright, Mrs. A. J. Dillingham, Mrs. Benj. H. Ripton, Mrs. J. W. H. Pollard, Mrs. Chas. S. Prosser, Mrs. S. G.

Wells. The endn1siasm and earnestness in the forma- tion of the troupe knows no lagging. For the past w·eek,. ~the committee ·chosen for this pur- pose have rnade strenuous .efforts to induce aU students with any degree of entertaining power, t · ·· · h k r· · 1 · ·· h . o JOin 1n t e wo1· • t 1s t 1e tntentlon to · ave a chorus of a bout forty, and fuBy that nun1ber have respoNded.

Prof. Pollard has taken a great deal of interest in the enterprise and everyone should lend a helping hand. Any one who can do an act of any kind, or has any talent in any line that would work into an affair of this kind, should not hesitate to speak of it at once; the more novelties that can be brought out the better. Inasmuch as this is a college organiza- tion and the proceeds are to be devoted to athletics, every fellow ought to be willing to push the thing along. EVERY day or so we read that a large bequest has been made te this or that college or university, and we naturally wonder why such a piece of g·ood fortune has seldom fallen to the lot of dear '~Old Union.\ Union, in the early part of the century, one of the most famous of the American colleges, and as well equipped as the best of them, has not been able to }{eep pace with the others, which have grown into large and prosperous in- it back again with double meaning. That definition of a college, which, years ago, Mark Hopkins said consisted of a log with himself at one end and a student at the other, is now obso- lete. A college must have more than fine sur- roundings. Camping out, with all its inconven- iences, is all right for recreation, but business cannot be well conducted without proper facilities. Some time ago, President Raymond delivered an able address at the alumni banquet in New York, and during his remarks presented his ideal of what a college ought to be. There is not an alumnus of Union College who would not like to see that ideal realized. And there is no reason why it should not be realized. The trustees are about to dispose of some of the college property iu order to 1nake improvements. And now that they have manifested a desire to do something, every alumnus who can afford to do so, should be willing to do his share toward swelling the fund. There are many successful alumni who owe their colleo-e 0 course to the generosity of the college, and they especially ought to contribute something. Suppose fifty alumni contributed five thousand each. That two hundred and fifty thousand would make the dormitories habitable, or erect some new build- ings. We hope that the action of the trustees will be the means of putting in tnotion forces that have long been latent, and which will be directed to some definite end. .

The l:ast number of Bibliotheca Zoologica published at Stuttgart, Gennany, hears, the title \On the O:rgans of Respiration of the Oniscidae, by Jam·es H. Stoller.\ It presents the results of research work done by Professor StoUer last year at the University of Leipsic, for which he was given the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. At the request of Professor Chun, head of the Depa,rtment of Zoology of Leipsic University, Professor Stoller's thesis was printed in the publication above mentioned. The following was found sandwiched among the inte1·collegiate items of one of our exchanges. How this slice of information ever got into print is a mystery: ''Union has fonned a new debating society. The fonner one was discontinued five years ago when the regulation compelling each student to becotne a m,ember of sotne literary society was removed.\ On Tuesday evening will occur Union's pre- litninary to select a representative in the New York State Inter-collegiate Oratorical contest. The league is con1prised of Rochester, Syracuse and Union; and the speaking this year is to be under the auspices of Rochester. The pre- liminary will take place in the chapel and is open to the students. The total n u1nber of officers of instruction, including university preachers, curators and library offi,cers, proctors and others at Har- vard this year is 466.

C., Jan. 31, 1899. Editor of ~Concordiensis: DEAR SIR: Through the kindness of Capt. White, a Union college man, a recent copy of The Concordiensis came into my possession. In it I noticed an article concerning my recent misfortune. It is hardly necessary for me to say that the article is a very distorted account of the occur- rence. I have not been given over to the civil authorities at all but have been in charge of my regiment. If the matter is of any interest to the students et Union, I will write brie:fiy how the shooting occurred without going very much into detail. When my regiment vvas ordered on provost guard duty in Greenville, I was among those chosen to go. I was stationed near the W. Va. camp and ordered to stop the shooting in the woods south of the camp and arrest the offenders. We were given ten rounds of ball ammunition. These men, Mudridge and Hart, in defiance of a division order, had a revolver in their possession and began to :fire it in the woods. According to my instructions I went to arrest them. They had already fired two shots before I came in sight. I called upon them to halt as soon as I saw then1. Instead of ~obeying, one of them raised the revolver · · and fir.ed two sb.ots at me, and then tried to escape by running. I calied '' halt'' tw'ice more and then :fired. Mug,ridge was killed and Hart · wounded. I leave it to the calm consideration of any man. Am I guHtyof a erin1eor was I simply obeying n1y instructions? After a deliberate attempt upon tny life, was I not justified in shooting? My trial is over and I have not the slightest idea but that I was acquitted. It is a sad thing to have in one's memory the fact that in the discharge of yoar duty as a so[dier, it was necessary to shoot and kill one of your countrymen. Still it should not cause retnorse, only deep regret. With best wishes :for Old Union, I am Sincerely yours, JOHN B. MATTICE, Co. K, 203rd N.Y. V.I. f4 rJeuJ TriaQ~Ular Cea~ue.

THE ~ooNCORDIENSlS. The Rev. J. vVilbur 'Chapman, D. D., pas ... tor of the Bethany Presbyterian church ofPhila- delpbia:, began a s.eries of evangelistic meetings in this city on Thursday evening. 'These services are being held at the First Presbyterian church, at 3: 30 each afternoon, and at 7 :45 every evening, and they are to continue for two weeks. himself and his constituents of the o~ld thirteenth ' New York district in r859· He was chosen a presidential elector and he was registrar in bankt-uptcy fm.~ Columbia county under the old law d1u·ing :r 868. He was successively senior partner in :the law firms ,of Beale & Barton, Beale & Duntz, the junior tnember of this firm being the present Republican district attorney of Cotumbia county, and Beale & Beale, the junior n1retnber of the firm being his son, Captain Charies F. T. Beale. Mr. Beale is survived by one son, Captain C. F. T. Beale of Washing- ton, and two daughters, Miss Eloise Beale of HudsQn, and Mrs. Hugh Bond of Baltimore, Md. This series of meetings is the result ·of the comllined efforts of the churches of the city to get Dr. Chaptnan to Schenectady, a11d the crowds that have attended the opening meet- ing bear witness to the success of the ,effort. - These revivals are not confined to one or two deBotn,inations, but represent a widespread movement throughout the entire city.. Dr. Chapman is a most interesting speaker .and it is hoped that tnany of the students wilt take advantage of this opportunity to hear him .. (I1a9.azi I]~ (1·~\/i,~w. In ~the February number of the American Monthly Review of Reviews the ·editor seeks to apply the lessons of our national failures in the South during the reconstruction period following the Civil War to the present problems of a shnilar nature in Cuba, Porto Rico and the Phillippines.. His deductions are interesting and instructive. He says : \The true way to restore tbe South to the lJ nion after the war was to restore the South to its own people.\ The same principle applies today in the new terri- tories just coming under our control. The editor warns us against a new type of ·' carpet- bagger \ who is threatening to invade Cuba- namely, the franchise-grabber. A large propor- tion of space in this number of the Review is given up to editorial and contributed articles on the managetnent of foreign dependencies. Sylvester Baxter contributes an intet·esting study of the Dutch rule in Java, and Dr. Daniel Dorchester makes a statistical exhibit of the recent drift toward colonial and protectorate governments. tl~aroloQy. CHARLES LOUIS BEALE, '44· • Hon. Charles Louis Beale, one of the oldest and 1-nost highly respected members <>f the Columbia county bar, died at his residence at Hudson, N.Y., Jan. 30, 1899· For :several years past Mr. Beale had led a retired life and has been in failing health, but his death came suddenly. Mr. Beale was born in Canaan on March 5, 1824. He prepa 1~ed for college at the Kinderhook Academy and was graduated from Union with the class of '44· While at college, he was a member of the Kappa Alpha fraternity. He studied law at Kinder- hook and in New York city, and practiced his profession in Kinderhook and New Yorl\: from 185r to r866, in which latter year he opefled an office in Hudson. He was a man endowed with rare ability anfl shone not only .as a brilliant lawyer, but was known as the silver- tongued orator of Colu1nbia county. His ~xperi­ ence in his profession as his ability as a speaker recommended him for the position of member of Congress, which office he filled with credit to Outing for February contains a delightful assorbnent oftales of sport., adventure and travel.

Burrows, Printer, 414 State Street, Schenectady, N. Y. IT IS most important that all those who intend to and at the finish of each 1neet. It is far easierand more pleasant to record a victory than a d~feat,. and ,every 1nan in college knows what the enthusi- asm of the hour would be in the event of victory. We aU, individuaHy and collectively, have a duty to perf€>rm iH: order that victory may be reaH~ed .. Let each one put his shoulder to the wheel ana keep it there until victory is ours. THE A.TTENTION of the students is caHed to the action with regard to unpaid subscriptions w.hicilil was taken at Monday's college meeting. There is $62 still outsta11;ding on last fall's subscripHotils, and the Advisory Board desires to have all of these old debts paid in so as to be able to start the year with a elean record. On Monday morning it -wa:s decided that unless all of this tnoney is paid in by Monday, Feb. 13, the names of the delinquents will be posted on the bulletin board, and published in the next issue of The Concordiensis. It -will certainly be a n1atter of regret if the plan bas to be carried out, but such neglect as this must be dealt with summarily and the time has now come for action. enter the intercollegiate athletic :meets in the IN ANO'THER column will be found the baseball spring, should begin training as soon as possible. schedule which was ratified at the last meetin_g of The contestants in both meets will be detennined the athletic board. Manager Gambee is to be <lon- from the winners of the annual mid-winter and spring meets, and it is desired that every one who has ability in any event, should participate iu both college meets, in order that the best material in college can be developed and brought out. It is necessary, at the beginning,. that Union go into the work thoroughly infused with a determination to win. Only hard persistent training can put the men into good condition, and there is no reason why Union should not be successful in both inter- collegiate meets if every man will do his part. E.ach man must be made to feel the importance of his individual effort, and each man should encourage his neighbor to do his best. After a successful football season, Union should not allow her energy to lag. It would give the .college paper the greatest pleasure to record a series of victories throughout the baseball season, gratulated for being able to arrange such a good series of gatnes. He has done his part towards providing for a successful season, but the schedule cauno-t be carried through without money. If enough money cannot be raised to guarantee the present schedule the ntunber of games will have to be curtailed. It will be noticed that six gan1.es out of the fourteen are to be played on the camJlns, giving the students an opportunity to see so1:ne of the best games of the season. It seetns as if every man ought to be willing to support the man.age- ment, and we hope that every one will contribute liberally. President Raytuond will be one of the speal\ers at the session of the State Y. M. C. A. conven- tion, to be held in Rome, N. Y., on Feb. 18. I ( ( . 1 ~ t l s s v . 1

Bamber, ex-1900, has taken a position with the General Electric Company in this city. St. Elmo Goetz, ex-1900, at present studying dentistry in New York is seriously in with diptheri.a. James W. Veeder, '94, and Homer Strong, '98, both of this city, have passed the State Bar exan1ination. The trustees of Columbia University have adopted a resolution limiting admission to the Law School to college graduates. The change will take effect in the fall of 1903. The property now owned by fraternities at Cornell is valued at $475,ooo; at Williams, $35o,ooo ; Yale, $3oo,ooo; Amherst, $2oo,ooo; Wesleyan, $rzs,ooo; Harvard, $r 25 ,,ooo. University of Pennsylvania presents to each member of the 'varsity football team this year a gold watch charm in the shape of a football as a souvenir. The subs receive silver ones. Out of the 45r colleges in the United States, forty-one are closed to wotnen. However there are 143 schools of high learning open to wotnen only, which have 3o,ooo students. Thus 143 institutions are closed to men and forty-one to won1en. Base Ball. Although tnuch of the thne and attention of the college athletes is being given to basket ball and the track team, n1uch interest is being shown in the p1·eparations for the base ball season. Union's prospects for a successful season are very good. Of course Thatcher will be missed in the box, but at all other points the team will be fully as strong as last year. With the ():Xcep- tion of Thatcher all of last y;ear's playeTs are still in college and ready to cornpete with aH comers for their old positions. It is 1oped that the f~eshtnan class contains some m:en who wiil make con1petition worthy ofthe old players. Captain Wiley expects to have the team com- ,mence practice next week, and at that tirn.e more candidates will undoubtedly appea1·., So far the following ,m:en have expressed ti~eil· intentions of trying for positions on the team: ; Pitchers.-Mallery, 1901 ; Edwards, 1900 ; Enoch, 1902; Yawger, 1902.

Such is testilnony of the sixty couples or tnore Wiho attended the Sophomore Soiree. The soiree committee, in spite of disheartening predictions of failure, in spite of all the obstacles that tl':lre coldest night of the winter could put in the way, has given a successful dance in the ''Round Building.\ The patronesses w·ere : Mrs. A ..

Warner, Mrs. D. W. Watkins. The members of the l1eating con1n1ittee deserve commendation fo1· their hard and faithful work. Fires were kept burning continuously for four days with uncertain success and it was fea11ed up to the last n1oment that the building w·oul d ' have to be given up. In view of this possihiJ,j;ty the use of the Alpha Delta Phi house had been kindly offered to the connnittee a.ttd would have been accepted had the ''Round Building'' been too cold. Those present were: Mrs. J. H. Stoller, Mrs. 0. H. Landreth, Mrs. S. G. Ashmore, Mrs. J. W. H. PoHard, Mrs. Vl, G-. Carey, Mrs. A. J. Dillingham,, Mrs. Radliffe, Mrs. J. W. Strain, Mrs. G. W.

Watertown; Miss Stover, Miss Kellogg, began to arrive, they beheld a pretty sight. Tb.e beauty of the building itself was greatly enhanced by the decorations. Streamers stretched clear across the hall and sho\-ved to good advanta!ge against the canopy which had been lowered to the floor of the first gallery. The chairs, sofas and rugs which were arranged around the edge of the room gave it a cozy appearance. 'The ladies' dressing room and also the caterer's stand had been arranged down stairs. Great anxiety was caused by the tardinessof Gioscia and his musicians. But at last they came and they were right royally welcomed hy th-e impatient dancers. Dancing began about eleven o'clock and th.e many handsome and costly gowns, set off hJ the black suits of the men, made a pretty effect. The dance continued till nearly six in the morning, when the tired but still tnerry young peeple reluctantly left for home.

Now that the feasibility of holding a winter dance in Memorial Hall has been proven, why cannot all of the college dances be held there? The only thing which prevents the building from making a.n elegant ball room is the lack of a good floor. Crash, at best, is but a poor sub- stitute for a polished wood floor. This defect was the greatest, and one may ahnost say the only drawback to the success of the soiree. For although the crash had been thoroughly swept and sponged, enough dnst was raised by the dancing to make the air decidedly unpleasant to breathe. G1•eat rents were torn in the crash during the dance so that it is now useless for its former purpose. Now is the time to put in a good dancing floor. It is to be hoped that a strong effort will be made to do so. One thing which made the soiree seem more than ever a college affair was, that even the lights were supplied by tbe college. Under the direction of Prof. Eddy, wires were strung and connections ,made with the dynatno attached to the new gas engine which was recently donated to the college by the manufacturers. This was the first attempt to make use of the engine and it proved a complete success, the lights being equal in e-very respect to those furnished by the city electric light Co. A party of twenty-five Columbia students accompanied by one of their professors visited the General Eiectric works the latter part of last week. After their stay here they left for Mechanicsville where they inspected the power station. i i Bas~et Ball. UNION VS. AMSTERDAM: • The newly organized coUege basket ball team went up to Amsterdam February 3, and played a :remarkable good ga.rne against the Y. M. C. A. team of that city. [t was their first game and although they did not win it, tbeir playing showed that much may be expected from them in :the futu1.·e. The game was played in the Y. M. C. A. building, before a large audience. It was hotly contested d1roughout. In the first half Union scored four po~nts on two field ,.goals and two from fouls, w:hile A.msterdam tnade eight points on four :fietd goals. In the second half, by two field goals and a foul, Union ran up five points, her opponents socoring six on two field goals and two fouls.- Union blocked well throughout. but was too slow in passing.

The basket bal1 game last Friday evening at Fort Edward, between the team of the Saterlee Hose corn pan y of that place and the 'varsity, resulted in a victory for the :formet by a score uf 35 to 5· Union put up a hard struggle through- out, but was outclassed by the splendid team work of her opponents. Fort Edward's game was unusually good, showing a considerable amount()[ practice, which was evidently lacking in the coUegians. StiH, our team played well and not discouraged in the least by their defeat. A large crowd was present, and it is hut justice to say that the v.is>iting team was remark- ably wen treated. At the conclusion of the game, a banquet was tendered them by the members of the hose company at their house. L. E. Montgomery, an old Union ,man, presided

The members of the faculty who acted as judges were Dr. Hoffman, Dr. Truax and Dr. Jones. l'he first speaker was Hinman, '99 and his subject was, \The Use and Abuse of Power.\ His principal thought was that the fittest survive, but right and might must go together, else there will be failure. He showed many incidents in history where this was the case and in his last exan1ple cotntnented upon the policy which Spain has followed and the results brought about by it. The next speaker was Rogers, r 9oo, whose subject was, \What are We Here For?\ The line of thought he followed out was that though life is full of sorrow our souls can look forward to a glorious future a.nd for this we should strive. Labor is life's blessing and our destiny here is to work and tnake the tnost of opportunities, for repose will cotne hereafter. He was followed by Bahney, 1902, who spoke upon ''Municipal Reform.\ He thought that the great need of the tilnes was a Municipal Party which would obtain '' horpe rule\ for the cities, since then the responsibilities of the government would rest upon the citizens and all the people tnust work in unison or else suffer individually. Dr. Truax speaking for the committee, said that they had some difficulty in making a decision but that they had finally chosen Harold J. Hintnan as Union's representative. ..

Burrows, Prin-ter.,. -4-14- St~e- Street., S~henectady, N. Y. A THING which, certainly does not reflect cnedit on the sophomore class is the fact that only three men outside of the, cemmittee· supported the soiree. Comment is um.necessary. WE WOULD like to impress upon all contributors to the Concordiensis the necessity of getting all their material in by Wednesday noon. Assignments done on Friday should be ready to hand in by Tuesday morning at the very latest. In making appointments on, the paper promptness will be con- sidered one of the essentials to qualify a candidate for a position. We urge the freshmen to hand in something every week, even if it is very little. There are quite a l.arge number seek,ing an. appointtl).ent and those men will be. appointed who are faithful a:nd. show that they take some interest in the paper. A SHORT time ago a committee of students was appointed to ·confer w.ith the faculty eonce]jning the advisability. o:£ changing the· hour for college meeting:&. from Moaday to. some ather day when' a. 1 arger attendance. ctbn be seca•red:. under discussion, the meetings were prolonged until the hour had almost expired, thus. causing recitations of that hour to be abandoned. Th.i&r difficulty has been obviated by the present plan, but the students have not turned out to colleg_e meetings in as large numbers as they did formerly. Almost every man in college used to be in chapel on Monday morning but under the present system there are seldom el?-ough men present to make a quorum for doing bu.siness. But the reason for this rests with the men, not with the system. A large number of students live within a radius of twenty-five miles of the college and have been in the habit of going home every Friday. Since there have been no recitaHons until nine o'clock on. Monday, they have not returned until Mond.ay morning in time to make recitations. Under the circumstances it has been easy for these students to obtain excuses for chapel absenses, or make use of their bolts on that morning, and the purpose for which the hour from eight until nine was originally set aside has been almost entirely lost sight of. Of course, if a student wishes to go home every week, that is his privilege, but if we are not mis- taken, every student is supposed to be in his place at chapel on Monday morning. If there were reci- tations immediately after chapei the students would be there, but they do not feel the importance . oti being present at the college meetings. The meetings cannot be made a success unless alJ. th.e· students attend. The college meeting is. the only place where all the students. can come togeth~r, and express themselves on matters of college in.ter- est. It is the place where Gollege spiri(t should.b.e br~wed. AU college feeling and opinion sboul'd emanate from there·. The meetings can be ma-de enthusiastic if all the stud~nts are pres.ent, but there can be very little· enthusiasm w~hen over: hall the. number are absemt. The col1ege meeting should! be something to l0ok forwa.rd to ea~b week.;. a a t 1

a place where all can gather at an appointed time a:nd transact college business and r-ehearse the ~college songs, and the college and class yells. The meetings· ought to be made so interesting th. at · they can be recaHed in after years as the most pleasant recollections of college liife. If any plan can be suggested that will bring out a larg-er attendance we would like to see it adopted. It seems as if any other morning is to be preferred to Monday. In addition to the regular chapel ·exercises on Wednesday morning the student body had the pleasure of hearing Dr. J. Wilbur Chapman, who is holding evangelistic services in this city. Dr. Chapman took his text from Romans 2:22. \'There is no difference.\ He said there is a difference between the degrees of sin from a worldly point of view, but from a spiritual standpoint all sins are equal. The greatest sin is that of unbelief. Our secret sins are seen by God and counted against us, hut He can blot out all if we show a desire to be cleansed. 'The only way to come up to God's standard of man is to be led to Christ and through his help do all in ou1· power to attain this standard. '' God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that 'U.Jhosoever believeth on hitn might not perish but have everlasting life.\ \ Whosoever,\ means each one of us and if we accept him our sins will be pardoned and we shall inherit everlasting life. In conclusion Dr. Chapman 5aid, ''May God bless you and give you a happy life. He certainly will give it, if you accept Him.\ · His remarks were followed by a few in the same vein by Dr. Raytnond. Dr. Chaptnan spoke with his usual earnestness and his words impressed deeply all who listened to him. Of the series of meetings which he has been con• ducting nothing more can be said, for the amount of good that has been done must be evi- dent to everyone who has had the g.ood foxtune to be present at any of the services. We .sent you o'er the sea, Men of the West, To carry peace and industry To war '.s unrest. No grateful homage bound ye there, Nor honor due; A sullen laud with threatn'ing air Admitted you. Ye faltered. not at burning sun, Nor fever's :mJght; Nor when ye found the task begun A bitter fi-ght. Ye toiled amid a people rude, With patient zeal; Nor lifted a:t ingratitude Th' avenging steel. A blighted land that could not see The pro:ffered light; Nor comprehend that liberty Of truth and right. They struck the hand that was their hope A cruel blow- The hand that had not stooped ,to cope With sucb. a foe. Ah! bravely then ye bore the blast, So long- foreseen; Or sighed an exile's death at last, With heart serene. We cannot weep at such a dea..th; Nor toll the bell While with a deep exultant breath Our bosoms swell. We trusted, and were not deceived, Men of the West : Ye fought and and died as ye had lived- Your nati<:>n 's best. And ye, who live to toil anew, We trust as well As those who, faithful, toiled with you And, faitbful, fell. CHARLES C. BALLARD, '99.

io 'THE ·CONOORDtENSIS. ~ possib.ility. In reply to a letter of Dr. Raytnond to Hon. vV arner Miller, retninding the latter of his post- poned engagetnent of last year to speak to the students at the ·Charter Day exercises, the follow- ing answer has been received : NEw York, February 9th, 1899. Dr. A. V. V. Ray1nond, President Union College, Schenectady, New York. My Dear Dr.: I am in receipt of yours of the 8th, regarding my speaking at the College on February 23d. I do not dare to n1ake a pledge at the present time to be with you on that date, for the probabilities are that I shall find it necessary to be in Washington. As you know, I am looking after the Nicaragua Canal legislation, and as Congress is now consider- ing it I must hold myself in readiness to go to Washington whenever called. As you are to have other speakers present upon the occasion, you will have to take my promise conditionally, that is, that if I find it possible to be there I will do so. Yours truly, WARNER MILLER. It will be retn embered that business of an itnportant character prevented Mr. Miller from fulfilling a like engagement Iast year. It is hoped that he may be :able to address the students next week Thursday,. as his lecture wiH be of tnore than ordinary interest, both · because the question is now before congress and because it win be the subject of the Allison- , Foote debate, that evening. :GrosciA & GARTLAND's ORCHESTRA.

The chapel was well fiBed with students and friends Wednesday ,morning to join in tlre obser- vance of Washington's Birthday. Aftelt the spirit of the students had manifested itself in various yells, the exercises were opened with a hytnn, after which President Raymond delivered a pleasing address on \Washington.\ In part, he said: \While we recall other tnemories and know other names, our first duty is to hitn who called the nation into being. The memory of his ex- alted character has been the mightiest construc- tive force in our national life, since it has quick- ened reverence for those virtues lying at the basis of national power and greatness. Since inspiration comes from above, the life of the people can only worthily be nourished by reverence. A man is 1nore than his deeds. The only vital forces in hutnan afrairs are spiritual. It takes tnore than the spirit of an accurate historian to discover the greatness of a great man. \In Washington we see the greatness that con1es with birth. A gentleman born, he in- herited the instincts and capacities of a chivalrous nature, a self respect that meant inherent dignity, a reverence for purity that meant essential nobility. His life began on a high plane. I-I is youth was prophetic of his n1anhood. The Washington of hnmortal fame was the Wash- ington of clean hands and a pure heart, frotn childhood to age. '' And yet character is not all an inheritance. Much of virtue must be acquired. Right principles, noble impulses are not the whole of life. As a general, he was essentially greater than as a youth, because of the discipline of intervening years. Between the home of his childhood and the ~cambridge ehn, iay the wilderness experience of the surveyor and the young colonel of militia, and the impression for it is that the itnpetuous spirit of the youth learned the lesson of unweari:ng toil and patient endurance. In nothing is the greatness of Washington more apparent than in the mastery of himself, not the victory of a day, but the resu[t of years of struggle. The America of to- day and of all the :Cuttne, needs the inspiring exatnple of the heroic Washington, needs the lesson of that struggle with himself. \If ever the fortunes of war hung upon one n1an, that was the war o[ American independ- ence. The real crises ca1ne when the people were dispirited, the anny disheartened, con- gress wrangling, cri6cistn incessant and vicious. The greatest batt1es for independence were fought against the silent forces of apathy and discouragement. The greatest vicitories were those of the camp. Pract,ically deserted by con- gress, attacked by intrigue, he stood alone, and his sublime faith, patience and magnamity saved the cause of liberty in its darkest hour. \ The Washington that America honors is not a mythical Washington, but the true George Washington whose great spirit was the reality which falsehood and tyranny could not destroy, and vvhHe that spirit lives the nation lives. SENATOR BRACKETT'S ADDRESS. The Senator opened his remarks by saying that he had not come with a caretully prepared speech nor did he intend to produce a piece of oratory. He came as a neighbor to talk over the events in our n.ation's history which are sug- gested by Washington's birthday. He said it was a fit day for national retro- spection, a titne when we should look back to see what the nation had accomplished and how f.ar we have advanced. Our history tnay be divided into three periods : That of the Revo ..

THE CONC'ORDIENSIS. lution, that of the ,Civil War, and that of the Spanish War. During the first period the motive was a materia[ one. It found expression in the cry, \ No Taxation without Representation.\ What- ever tnay have been the aitns and the patriotistn of the statesmen of that day, it is true that the underlying issue which determined the nation's course was a material and so1newhat selfish one. The people W'ere being treated unjustly and they rose up against it for their own sakes. In r86o we had reached a tnuch higher level. The question was not whether we should right a wrong cotn,mitted against us but whether we should do justice to an oppressed and down- trodden race. vVe righted a wrong. In r898 we caine to the third period and to a still higher 1notive of action. The Spanish goven11nent in Cuba was an outrage to the century. In the late vvar we again saw that iustice vvas done to an oppressed people but there was this difference between the tnotives of . the two periods. In r 86o we righted a wrong for which we ourselves were responsible; in r898 we took it upon ourselves to right a wrong for which we were in no n1anner responsible. In the last case we took a position as far above the second as that was above the first. We have proven ourselves to be worthy descendants of Washington and Lincoln. After the war an unparalleled state of things existed. After the vanquished had ratified the treaty of peace, the victors debated the question for weeks whether or not ·vve had obtained too much. This is a ti1ne when great care should be exercised by our legislators. It is our duty to sow good seed for the harvest will be as the . SOWing. Last week was a busy one for Doctor Ray- tnond. On Friday evening he addressed a literary society at Fort Plain, an,d on ~at~1rday morning spoke before a teachers association at St. Johnsville. Arriving at this city at half-p~st one on Saturday afternoon he was on the lull for a couple of hours and then took an afternoon train for New York, preaching at Englewood, N.J., on Sunday tnorning~ and in the evening in New York before the People's Institute at Cooper Union. UNION VS. R. P. I. The basket ball game played at Troy last Friday between the team fro.m Rensselaer Poly- technical Institute and our 'varsity, resulted in. a victory for the fonner with a score of 40 to I 2. The R. P. I. men played a ,clean, gent]ernanly game throughout and were especiaU y strong in their team work. The waxed flood proved a great hindrance to the best efforts of our team, and since the baskets were on posts and not fastened against walls there was no chance for caro1n shots. Then the out-of-bounds line was behind the goals, not before them, as in the \gym so that our tean1 which was playing only its third garne, had a nurnber of disadvant- ages to contend against. Union's playing in the first half was slow and lack of teatn work vvas evident. In the second half Elliot was substi- tuted for Srnith and the score for the half was almost tied; the result being I 2 to 9· The team was entertained by one of the fraternities before the gatne, and afterwards was given an infortnal banquet, at which the Trojans showed themselves to be excellent hosts. A return gatne 111ay be played the first part of next term. . The line-up was as follows : Thebo, Capt. } F . ·d' A d • • • • • otwat s ..... n erson. f Creager. (Jude.

Mc- Clure, reader and itnpersonator, gave a concert in the First Methodist church at Lansingburgh last Wednesday evening.

The struggle lasted fo:r over .an hour and a The black clouds of strife were apparent at the college rneeting on last Monday morning,. 'The snow was just in the right condition for a s~tna1l scrap betw~een the freshmen and sopho- mores. After the usual business had been dis- posed of and enthusias1n aroused by the singing of college songs and the exchange of class ye:rls, some upper classmen proposed to adjourn for the fight and at once hostilities began. half before it was declared off by the upper chlssm·en. Most of those who took an activ~e part were clothed for such an occasion, but sotne were caught unawares and· received rather rough handling. Enough darnage was done to keep the tailors of Schenectady busy for the remainder of the week. No one was serious- ly injured, although there we·re ma~y cuts, bruises and bleeding noses. So far the honors have been quite evenly Son1e of the freshmen near the door gain:ed possession of it and in trying to check the rush of some of the sophornores tl1ey completely blocked the exit for a titne, but tl1e crowd finaHy escaped to the can1pus where they found a stnD:U delegation ftotn each class, which had cotne out by the other door, industriously engaged in pelting each other with such snow as they couid find to pack. This continued for some tin1.e., while the scene vvas occasionally enlivened by flashes of spirit im the shape of individual struggles in which two or three fresh1nen and sophon1ores becatne hope- lessly covered with snow and water which covered the greater part of the ca~mpus. At the instigation of the upper classtnen, a rush for the terrace soon began. No one knows just bow it happened, but in some way or other both parties soon found themselves in close proxirni ty to the \ Grand Old Seat of Stone,\ and in a very short time fonns were flying through space and alighting in the snow bank below tl1e terrace in every conceivable posture. Sorne struck on their feet and others on their heads, sotne went a lone and sorne crarried others over with them, but all were on their feet a.nd scrambling back in an instant. No one stopped to count the nurnber of those whp were thrown over, but it is generally conceded that the sophotnores who thus drowned their sorrows, or themselves, in the snow bank beneath, were far more nutnerous than the fresh tnen. divided between the two lower classes. 'l'he Sophs were declared victori in the cane rush in spite of protest, but the freslnnen can certainly claim the victory in Monday's struggle. George W. vVaite, '92, was in town Friday. Alexander T. Blessing, '96, is in New Y<>rk. Canfield, '97, and KeHogg, ex-'99, were in town last week. E. V. Deuel, ex-'98, has been visiting friends. in town the past week. Jatnes W. Veeder, '94, has entered the setn:ester at the Law School. Rogers, 1goo, has been chosen Union's alternate at the inter-collegiate Oratorical con- test. Rev. Edward T.

Barney, '84, secretary of the New York City Ahunni Association and a trustee of the college was in town last week Thursday. The college quartette will sing at the banquet of the Union College Alutnni Association of New England to be held in Boston on the evening of March I st.

Burrows, Printer, 414 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. ''QUEER animals aren't they?''remarked a mem- ber of the faculty, a.s he watched the sophomore- freshman snow ball :fight. We agree with him in. some particulars. 'I\his time honered custom is all right so long as it maintains its equilibrium, but just as soon as it degenerates into a hair-pulling contest or a slugging tnatch, all enthusiasm and college spirit is extracted from it. The so-called snow ball \scrap\ that lately occured is a mis- nomer, for the snow balls played a very small part in the contest. College customs should not be twisted all out of shape. A snow ball fight should be all that its name implies. It oug-ht not to be re- garded a college custom when it becomes a rough and tumble scrap. ABOUT two years ago efforts were n1ade to start a fund for a new athletic field. Everything seemed to be progressing, and it was thought that within a short time enough money would be pledged to cover the expense. For anum ber of reasons activities soon. ce;a;sed,, the principle one being a lack ·Of co- qperaH<Gn in the work. This is unfortunate, for quite a. lat;ge sum had aiready been subscribed. It is h:oped that something will be done in 'the near future, .so that activities can again he resumed. Union m.eeds an athletic :field very ba:dly. The college has two important meets comh~g oiff in the spring!' whkh might be held on the college grounds, and be a source of revenue if we had alil :inclosed field a::nd a grand stand. There would be a larger atten<!lance at the .games on the camp1:1s if there were &etter accommodations for seating the peopie. Other ~colleges count on the gate receipts to pay running expenses, and there is no reason why, in a city the size of Schenectady, the patronage that would he given by the city people, should not more than J.>ay the expenses of every contest. 'SomeHmes it has been impossible to schedule games with first class college teams for our own catnpus, because we couid not afford to bring them here. We could a fiord to bring the best teams to Union if we had proper facilities. The people will turn ()Ut to see a good game if they know they can sit down and watch the contest.

The subject ofthe debate was' 'Resolved that the United States should construct and ~ operate the Nicaraugan Canal.,., The Adelphic ! debaters were W. Dewey Loucks, 1900; Etnil L. Winterberg,, 1900; and Irving W. Ketchum, '99· The Pbi1omathean speaket~s wer.e Dix W. Noel, '99; Harrison 1(. Wright,'99·; and Stephen S. Read, 1900 . The Philomatheans argued that the construc- tion of the canal was necessary for the interests of cotnmerce, for the unification of the country, and the military deve1opm,ent 1 of the nation. The United States is the only nation that ean successfully ·construct this canal and no foreign power can do it with advantage to all concerned. If we carry out the project it wiU be in perfect harmony with the Monroe Doctrine and the Cl:ayton-Btdwer treaty. The United States can construct the canal better than a private cotn- pany on account of the cost. Also it would ad- vance the interests of the nation more than a private company could. On the other side the Addphics argued that the canal1night better be buHt at Panama as the continent is narrower at that point, and a canal built there would be just as p1·actical. The river would not aid the Nicaraugan canal be- cause the rapids would hinder navigation. It would be a great expense in war since it would have to be fortified. We are too busy at present with foreign problems to have such a gigantic enterprise on our hands. Taxes are also heavy, and the additional expense wouJ.d greatly burden the people. Transportation by this means would not be cheaper than by railroad and the distance fron\l New York to the P·hilippines is much less by way of the Suez canal than by this projected canal. The judges were Hon. Atnasa J. Parker of , Albany, Hon. Judson S. Landon of Schenectady and Mr. W. R. Emmett of Schenectady. They awarded the society prize of $5o to the Adelphic society and the :$5o individual prize to Irving W. Ketchum, '99· 'The ro4th anniversary of the granting of the 'charter to Union by the Regents of New York, was observed on Thursday with appropriate exercises in the chapel. Regular chapel service was conducted by Dr. Raymond, assisted by the Rev. A. G. Sewall. The fi:rst address was by President Raytnond, whose theme was the duty of the educated young rnan to the state. The full text of the president's address will be found in the January number of the Parthenon. The other speaker was the Hon. Charles F. Wheelock, member of the State Board of Regents. The secretary of the Regents, Mr. Melvil Dewey, \vho had been expected to de- liver the address, was detained on business matters. Mr. Wheelock's 1nain thetne was the great advance in educational work of recent years. As an interesting exa1nple he cited the first annual report of the board of trustees of Union coHege. ''The college property at that tin1e was valued at thirty thousand dollars. The faculty consisted of four men-a president, a professor of natural philosophy and astronotny, a professor of mathematics and a tutor. Forty students had been enrolled. Even at that titne some pretty good men were turned out. It is not altogether in the nutnber of the faculty or men that results may be obtained frorn a college. The two great qualifications essential for educa- tional work are scholarship and 'the right sort of feeling.' The social and athletic sides of college life should necessarily receive considerable at- tention. Education was formerly defined as the harmonious developtnent of all the facultieb. There is but one trouble in this difinition-there is no truth in it. There have been n1any cases of young men weak in certain branches of study who have become most proficient later in thetn in life. A young tnan cannot tell what his tastes will be. He should have ample opportunity to develop what tastes he 1nay have at the present. \The number of students in colleges and pro- fessional schools in New York state during the last ten years has increased frotn twelve to thirty thousand. The latter number represents forty- five per cent. of the nun1ber of students at present in secondary schools. These figures mean that the college graduate of the future will not have so n1uch of a n1onopoly as the graduate of the past has had.\

The re:r>ort of the Harvard football association shows $43 ,ooo receipts and expenses of $Io,75o.
