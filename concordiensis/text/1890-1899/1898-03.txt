The start was .made from the gym. at 10:53, and the run was over a three 111He cross-country course. The hares \vere given z,Vz tnin. start., and covered the: distance in 25 ~ n1in. Although the hounds lost the '' scent\ twice during the run, they covered the course in 31 ~min. The tirne made by both the hares and hounds was very creditable, s1 nee the fields and roads were in bad condition due to the recent thaws. 'l\'hronghout the run the hounds were well bunched. As they came across the can1pus on the finish, however, Vrootnan, '98, Shelley, 190r, and Broughton, 1900, gradually drew ahead of the others, and finished in the order nam~ed. '1\'1he remainder of the pack retnained bunched till the run ended. Gutn1an, '98, and Hartnage1, '98, were the hares. The following m,en represented the hounds : Price, '99, leader; Closs, '98, whipper-in ; Andrews, '98, Hover, '98, Noel, '98, Vrooman, '98, Strong, '99, Broughton, 1900, Dunham, 1900, Burton, 1901, Shelley, 19or, Slack, 19or, Wight, 1901.

No ONE, of sound· Il!l.in.d, could have heard the oratorical contest of last week and then truth- fully have stated that in it is belief oratory in our American colleges is on_ the decline. For when three small colleges, popularly designated \ruin0r .can turn out such able e:xponents of eloquence, it can be tak€n as nothing less than a bang-up, bona fide sign ·of the tintes. )Ve congratulate Union's representative, for ~uecess over such competitors .as our fdends f1·orn Rochester and Syracuse proved thelll.selves to be, i~ uo small achievement. THE bas-eball aspirant.s -who fail to show up for practic:e wh.~n requerte-<1 to do so by Captain Srnith sho-uld feel asb:am~d of themselves. The ,reputation of their altua...IDa.ter is at stake, and yet they do Ilot seern to possess enough love for her to overcome a trifle of inertia. They'll be sor~y :sorne day. Just as we are ,sorry.,. those of us who are grown up, that we did not run our mother's errands with a better grace when we were little:. Boys will be boys. That is why the worhi grants a special meed of appreciation to boys that are 1nen. This ability to :overcon1e inertia is o.ue of the things that differentiate a Inan from .a. lump of -clay. We aU know what these lumps of -clay are. We see them every day. ·They're not so attrac- tive. 'VHILE the representative of St. Lawr-ence uni- versity, who did us the honor of a visit last Tues- day, presented several good reasons from a St. Lawrence standpoint why the institution Tepre- sented by him should be admitted to the league, we feel constrained to say that those reasons V\rere scarcely weighty fro1n any other standpoint.. Tt may be held by some that altruistic n1otives should induce Union to vote for the adrnission of St. Lawrence. But the altruisn1 that would pos- sibly benefit one institu,tion to the pro ba. 1>le injury of the league is 1·atber far-fetched. St. Lawrence frankly confesses she does not conteiHplate hold- ing up her end in football and baseball if ad111itt~d to the league. Anyway, since she is seeking fast eompany among colleg-e men, she rnight accept t:he in vit~L­ tion to join hands with Syracuse and Buffalo. IF an individual of rather low standards, were suddenly to discover that his welfare should de- mand a decided elevation of those standards and should J'esolve on. said elevation, and then should further resolve, say, to publish said resolutions in the pubUc prints,-in all probability he would be looked upon as 1nore or less of an ass. EspeciaJly would be be so coasidered, and rightfully so. if his balling of standards, so to speak, was but a very little share in a gen.eral and well-defined tendency-. For the past three or four years there has been scarcely a college of any pro1uinence in the United States that has not 1uade a decisive forwa.rd stride in the n1atter of requiren1ents both for admission ,. i '' 1 l j J, !

'There are some that have been a trifle dilatory perhaps, but then there are always laggards ; and these have been inconsider- . able when compared to the grea.t number tha·t have made real pro,gress. Eut lo, behold the ardor ·with which several col- leges that have finaily concluded to join the move- ment r11sh into type and declare their goodness. ·Of course, their renaissance does rnake good'!.. '' news\-s happenings of whatever nature -always do. But do not the methods of these in· veterate seU -ad vecrtisers resemble those emp~oyed by peddlers. of quack panaceas ? Are they in nice keeping with coUegiate dignity? Are they not 1·ather Gothic ! Prof. John Van Schaicke, '94, of the College -.of En1poria, Kansas, recently n1ade bold to ·write to ex-President Cleveland asking him for .a likeness. The good Grover acquiesced and in an autograph letter accompanying the photo- graph said among other things, \I rnust con- fess that a Kansas c~llege is a queer place for n1y picture, since I am such a heretic, 1ni1dly stated, to Kansas ideas on political questions.\ Western newspapers co1nmented freely on the incident. The Hutchinson News said, H Grover ·Cleveland said recently to the 'College of Em- poria that he did not l<now what ip the world they wanted to do w,ith one of his pictures. This is the first titne in 79 years that vve have been able to agree with Grover.\ The Kansas City Star 1nade the tnatter a subject for a big \leader. According to the Lawrence Journal, ·\ Grover Cleveland sent his picture the other day to the College of Emporia and with it a letter saying that he did not know what on earth they wanted of it. This opinion of Grover's will be echoed by nine out of eve1-y ten Kansas men.\ The Ottawa (Kan.) Herald suggested ·that '' the tnost appropriate place that they knevv of for the picture \vas in Prof. Dycke's tuuseum of antiquities in the State university.\ ,.Such is fame. Among the many good things perpetrated at the centennial celebration, was the ~stablish­ ment of a Library Alcove by the class of '82. The chief ,mover in th irs praiseworthy effort was Prof. A. S. Wright, the head of the Modern Lan.guage departn1ent of the Case School of Applied Science in Cleveland, Ohio. A goodly number of his class-mates assisted him in making the movement and the alcove was soon started by a very valuable gift of Ger- man works., including the leading classics and lexicographers. A very valuable addition has 1·ecently been tuade, and already graces the alcove. As we glance over them we perceive a large collection of the best_ classics in a con1pact fonn, known as \ Meyer's Universutn,\ also seve1·al of the best histories of the enti1·e Gennan literature, and some of the most noted lexicographers. The popular epics and heroic poetry, the songs of the people and the heroes, and indeed the whole interesting story of the development of the German nation. The poets, the preachers and the teachers of the Fatherland are not forgotten, while the thrilling story of the struggles of Germany with contending nations is given in poetry and prose. Scarcely a single epoch of.Gennan developn1ent passes unnoticed. The alcove thus supplies a great want on the part of scholars of history and poetry, and is a credit to the class that is supplying it. The exatnple is an excellent one, and it would be well if other classes would wheel into line in the matter or class alcoves in the library. fHumi]i ~oteg.

Fisher, represent~ng St. Lawrence University, requestsd that S:t. Lawrence ·might becom·e a metnber of the ath- leti·c union now existing between Hamihon, Hobart and Union. Mr. Fi:sher made the satne request at the comtnittee m~eehng held last week _in Bagg's hotel at Utica. None of the instirtu- \tions returned a positive answer although it is understood that Hamilton and Hobart favor the ad mission. Mr. Fisher said that they were not so anxious to form a union which included baseball and football as track athletics, since they did not feel as confident to cope with the members of tl1e present union anywhere but on the track. However, they would not refuse to form a union, if it should be deRirable, on this account. Should such a union be :for.med St. Lawrence 1 co~ld notguara·ntee return games· this season. No action will be taken on the tnatter until Monday tnorning at college tneeting. In the meantitne the pros and cons are being thor- oughly discussed by the students. Organized 1858.

It was just twelve o'clock when the toast-Dlaster .arose and after a short address of welcome, an- nounced the first speaker <>f the ·evening, President A. V. V. Raymond, who responded to the toast. \' Alma Mater.\ A hearty cheer was .giV'ien for Dr. Raymond as he arose, and it was some moments before qu.iet was restored. The speaker said that· he had at- tended a great many col~ege dinners, but never before had he attended <>ne in which he was so ·Conscious of the atmos1ph.ere of under-graduate It was a n1erry assembly ·Of Union under-.grad- ! udat.es and n1embers of the university faculty that gathered in the dining haU of the Hotel Edison, Friday evening, March 11. and joined hands in 1naking the first university banquet one of the most successful events of the year. At ten o'clock grace was said by Dr. Wells, and the guests immediately began to discuss the ex- cellent 1nenu prepared by mine host Brown. The college quartette, co1nposed of Gutrnann, '98, Ea1nes, '~9, Greene, '99, and Wiley, '99, enlivened the occasion with numerous songs, while the students found titne between the courses to sing the college songs and cheer then1selves hoarse. The coUege , yells were given for \Prexy for faculty rnen1bers and for the speakers of the evening, and the walls re-echoed with a loud '' George Washington.\ College spirit was at its height and all hear.ts were stirred with enthusiasm and patriotism by the vigorous .singing of \America\ and \Colun1bia the Gent of the Ocean.\ A cheer for Spain was · ntet with hisses, while cheers for McKinley and Free Cuba received hearty applause. :. life, and that the spirit~hown was quite distinctive of Union university. Our feBowship ,is sometlting broader and deeper than that of the class-room he said. Mutual respect and confidence have 1uade it possible for the university to corne together, and occasions like this give promise of benefit to all departments~ Whatever tends to bring the uni- About 130 banqueters occupied the four long tables arranged in the form of the letter E, ex- tending the full length of the dining hall. At the head sat the toast-Inaster, Frederic Waldorf Hild, '98, the speakers of the evening and mernbers of the faculty. The room was prettily decorated with American and coUege flags. From the ceil- ing were suspended pennants won by the college teams, and small garnet flags were tastily arranged about the chandeliers. Large delegations were present from the Medical college, the Law school and the School of Phar- Inacy, who entered into the spirit of the evening and contributed their full share of Union en- thusiasm. Among the n1embers of the faculty present were Professors Wells and Ash1nore and Instructors Bennett ano Opdyke. A few alumni cafi?.e also to receive a new infusion of college spirit. Among them were Dr. Pearson, W. G. Brown, '95; Lee Case, Wm. F. Cromer and Frank Cooper. versity together \'ill broaden all departments, so ,that the name of Union will have a fuller and a bolder ring. College spirit is nourished by the story of the past, not by the enthusiasm that bursts out in cheers today and is gone tomorrow;. it is a spirit of devotion, resistless and unconqn<>r- able, that will hold a man to his work whatever it is. He said that he had come to appreciate tha.t enthusiasm that does not tire out easily, and does not become so hoarse tba t it cannot rio a little shouting. Union college is now passing through a transitional period. A forward movement is now under way, and every,thing depends upon the devotion of Union men. If the spirit that ha.s been manifested during the past few years will bll. t continue, the brightest day that U niou college ha.s ever seen will soon dawn. Nothing can have 1nore weight with the alumni than the life exhibited on the bill. Every evidence of colleg~ ideals pave-s the way for practical support to the institution.. The college of the present is charged with a speeia.l responsibility in the work immediately before us, the result of which will be made to the students on the hill who have stood nobly by Old Union. After the applause had subsided, toast-n1aster Hild arose and said tha.t the evening would be very incomplete without the presence of Dr. vVells, who had watched life on the hill for 35 years, and announced that he would respond to the toast ''Reminiscences.\ Dr. Wells said that he never sympathized with Rip Van Winkle as he did that night. He had

THE' ()ONCORDIENSIS. never been of a 1·etiring dispos~iti()n; it had always been a pleasure to m.eet with the boys, so be thought that tonight he would i<>Bow the example of old Rip and take one more drop. There is no more inspiring spot, said the· spea.ker, that is filled with so many reminiscences. Wben he first came to Schenectady it bad the reputa-tion of being the deadest town on ·earth, and t:he Gibbons House was its center of gravity. It was said that the old bridge was built of beams that came out of the arlt, which had really come ·to a rest on the Helde- bergs and not on Mount Ararat a.s commonly sup- posed. And since Dr. Wa rr~n of Boston, has taken the position. that paradise was situated at the north pole, and another author has discovered that Dutch was ·the language of the Garden of Eden, those who had suggested that the ark grounded on the Heldehergs did not go far astray. Dr. Wells was once asked wlla..t order of architec- ture was in the college buildings, and he replied that they were of a con1posite 011~ler. 'The barracks were of the English order; tl~e .eoUonades, Italian; Nott Memorial Hall, Oriental; a.nd the Red Build- ing, Gothic. He said that ]Jr. N ott would allow no trees to be planted in front of th.e buildings, so · that passengers passing throu gb the city would be awed bythe structure of the buildings. He wanted nothingtoshutoffthe viewoftbe grounds frotn the valley, but the grand old ehns placed in long rows elsewhere a boat the gTounds al\'e each one a monu- nlent to Dr. N ott. When we sing the \ Song to Old Union,\ ·we slow down at U1e line where \Her WBlls grow gray\ with a spil'itof reverence as if to let them grow fl. little grayer, but, said the pro- fessor, the walls have not g..-(~rwn gray, they were born gray. The walls were first covered with gray hair, but that has all \orn away and now she has to wear a wig. Dr. Wells closed his re- nlarks by giving a detailed aceount of the genesis of the \Song to Old Union,.\ which. was written by Fitzhugh Ludlow at the request of Dr. Nott. The next speaker was Willia.H:l Hailes, M.D., of the Medical departtnent, wh•} was introduced as a silver-tongued orator. Dr. Hailes responded to the toast, ''The Medical Coll-€ge, '' in a very charac- teristic n1anner. He said t1lat the college boys were not a circumstance tO\ the Medics, that the boys on the hill were far n1o-.re gentle. He did not feel strange or out of place, as might be expected, for he saw '' Prexy \ on .all oflicial occasions at Albany, and his presence he:ve made him feel com· fortable. He declared that .tbe Medical was get- ting along swirningly. They had found demon- stration to be the best n1eth0d of instruction, and he described theiradvautag-esinthe way of X-Ray and electric projecting appa-ratus, which had lately been added to their equipment. Dr. Ha.Ues was frequently interrupted by laughter .and appl:;tuse . .. Joseph A. Lawson. of Albany. 'vas introduced as the ne:xt speaker, after the quartette had rendered a. pleasing selection. He responded .to \'The Law 8chool,\ and prefaced his remarks by saying that the request of the toas.t-master, to tell aH he knew about law was typi-cal of the average under-graduate. He said that although. be had not had the benefits of a college education, yet Union coHege occupied a high place in his regard. Speaking of the Law ~school, he declared that the bt·ancb o] the unive:rsUy that he represented was not child's play. It i:s not the province of the Law school to hnpart a historical knowledge of the law. Its ahn during the past fe\\V years has been to pre- pare Inen for adnJission to the bar. l-Ie said that the professors were not overerowd~d and urged all the under graduates to take up a cotn~se in the Albany Law :schooL During his reu1arks he praised the abilities of ''Father\ :Browlil :and paid a glowing tribute to Dr. Raytnond. Dr. WiUis G. Tucker, of Albany, who was to have spoken on ''The School of Phartna.cy\ was unfortunately called away earlier in the eveniug and his toast was passed over. W. G. Brown, '95, well known on tl1e hill as '' Fathe:r\ Brown, captain of the foot-ball tea1n during his senior year and one of the n1os.t popular men on the hill during his college days, was the next speaker. He responded in an able 1nanner to the toast \The University.\ l-Ie said that his presence was but a feeble indication of the pleasure he took in being there. It was with 1nide that he saw the teams of Union college bring back laurels fron1 other fields, as he used to help the1n do when be was in college. The history of Union college, said the speaker. is the biography of Dr. N ott. The history of nations is the biographi~s of a few great men. The future history of Union college will be the hh;tory of Dr. Ray1nond and a few men, who are bending their energies to the institution they represent, and not to the inrlividaal. Union college, he said, may she ever be right, but right or -wrong. Union college! Greater fa~ilities for the study of political and social seience have recently been added to the curriculurn. It is the mission of Union college to develop men for grave responsibilites. Our hope for the future is not based solely on a glorious past. A so1u1d financial basis is in store for the college. We have a young and vigorous faculty, and a president with the learning and culture of all the presidents begin- ning with N ott and ending with We hster. We are the most vigorous body of n1en that have ever given tone to life on the hill. We owe everything i 1 ' ,','>:

Union college is meeting her Trafalgar • Dr. Ra.ytnond is t-he A.d1niral Nelson, and he hotds · nJoft the garnet flag,, and expects every man to do his duty. In the absence of A. J. Dillingltaln, Instruetor Bennett responded to an improwptu toa:~t on \ Athletic~.\ He thought that the chief clesicl:eira- t-ion. of a speaker is to have soinething to say, ancl second, having son1ething to ~a,y, ,to say ir, and last1y, having so1nething to say, to say it. and say it as quickly as possible.

'98, of the La·w sch()ol, toasted '' l\Ian.\ He said that he could see two reasons why a law student should be assigned tbjs subject: First, because he is supposed to uRder- stand better than anything else, and secnn.d, be- cause a lawyer is utterly incapable of understand- ing wornan. He made an ingenious classification of man uude;~_· the heads of the n un1erals. So rn e, he said, are like the figure 1, a variation :at the base for a firm footing,. and the san1e size aJl. the way up. Sorue are li.ke the figures 7 and 9, all top. Some are like the nun1eral 8, evenly baJa.:ncect. Occasionally one is found like the cipher.

It was this principle that prompted the erection of a nwnument in hoEor of the sailors who went dov,·n with the Maine. (A.p- plause.) It is the principle that binds the students and university together ..

J\llore than ever before has the man of one idea been the successful ; and the best treatise on this earnestness is the Epistle to the Rotnans. In one of the verses of the twelfth chapter, the three eletnents of the earnestness of a successful purpose are noted.

Men who have seen much of John R.

Tb is \vas for years his purpose before he accotnp- lished it, and it is just that earnestness that is adding new national unions to the world's federation. In my short life, I have seen men rise frotn obscurity to exalted positions in the land and then go entirely to pieces. It doesn't pay.

' \\\'--A:DVERT1SEMENTS.---\\- On account of th.e good results of last Satur- day's chase, the freshm;an class be[d two hare and hound runs this week, in place of the regu- lar gym. work. The weather was favorable for runnin.g, but the fields and roads thick with n1ud, created sotne difficulty. This, however, did not lessen the interest of the students, and about 40 men turned out for each run.. 1\\he first w.as held, stu·ting fron1 the gym. at 3:30 Monday afternoon. A start of two tninutes was given to the hares V'li- ho succeeded in finish- ing the two mile run in I .2 min. The hounds followed close bebind, and fi~isbed the course in I I% min. The hares were represented by Ffartnagle, '98, Sotnerisiey, Hodgson, R. H. Robinson, Merri- man and Bennett, 1901; the hounds by the remainder of the freshman class, accompanied by Mr. Pollard and Gutman, '98. For the hares, Merrin1an and Bennett rnade the best titne ; for the hounds, SheUy and Slack. The second chase was heid on Wednesbay, at 3 :30, which proved as successful as the first. Who is .•. C.

The rnost interesting indoor athletic meet held under Union College auspices in years took place a:t the :Centre Street Opera house, Friday., ' Feb. 2$. It was an inter-cbss affair, but the sophor:aore ~t.hletes remained dormant and none were entered. The senior class won the m\leet by a s:rnaU margin fron1 the freshmen, the junior class finishing a good third. Several innovations introduced by Manaaer ; b I Cox and Physical Director Pollard, added much . to the entertainment of the crowd of spectators. The shot-put was dispensed with and tumbling and parallel bar work by a class instructed iby Mr. P<)llard lent flavor to the more common- place events.. The opportunity to laugh was presented when the obstacle race was run. Mr. Pollard deserves great credit for the hard work and life he has put into athletics at Union as shown by the success of the meet Friday night. Two Union college records were broken the past W'eek, one of vvhich, the pole vault, was broken at the 1-neet, the other, the fence vau:lt, was broken in the college gyn1nasium in the preliminaries. The fence vault record was raised by Deyoe, '98, frotn 6ft. 8 in. to 6ft. 9 in. The p()le vault indoor record of 9 ft. I in. made in 1895 by W. A. Campbell, 'g6, was raised by Capt. Sylvester, '99, to 9 ft. 9U in., beating the outdoor record of 9 ft. 6 in. mad~ in r886 by W. P. Landon, '87. A feature of the evening's events was the mile exhibition run by John Cregan, Prince- ton, '99· He was paced by Hartnage1, '98, Merriman, 'or, and Price, '99, and covered the distance in excellent form in 4 min. 48 sec. Cregan spent his freshman year at Union. The events began with the short dashes and followed each other in quick succession until the last was over when everJbody went away pleased at having been there and with a better impression .of college athletics. The many representatives present of the fairer element of the Dorpians serv,ed to make the occasion even more of a success.

Les Etats-Unis et l'esclavage. Geneve, le 4 fevrier. Jrionsieur le Redacteur: M. Dufour, dans son interessante conference de lundi dernier, a prononce quelques paroles au::x- quelles i1 m'est impossible de ne pas repondre. Moi, qui suis Americain et dont le pere s'est battu pour la iiberte des negres, je 1ie puis accepter que 1 'on ne considere pas la suppression de l'es- clavage comme un bienfait. Je suis persuade que l'esclavage, quoique regrette par les anciens pro- prietaires, est deteste par la jeunesse et par tous les amis de la 1i berte. 11 m'a paru SUrprenant que 1 'on puisse, a 1' Aula de l'Universite de la libre Geneve, vanter 1 'es- clavage. Depuis la guerre on a fonde beaucoup d'ecoles pour les negres, et j 'ai pl usieurs preuves que les enfants des esclaves font de grands progres; ainsi, nous avons deja des employes du gouvernement, des avocats, des pasteurs, des professeurs qui sont noirs; cependant, trente-trois annees seulement se sont ecoulees depuis la guerre; i1 est done evident que, maintenant deja, la couleur de la peau n'em- p@che pas de distinguer 1 'intelligence et le merite. M. le conferencier a vecu dans une contree ou la population etait favorable a l'esclavage et i1 a subi sans doute la triste influence des anciens proprie- taires.

In all, 458 institutions of higher learning were represented by I ,717 student delegates, and this number was swelled by m,e·mbers of facul- ties, returned n1issionaries, secretaries of boards, unattached volunteers, etc., to 2,214 regular delegates. The large meetings were held in the armory of the Cleveland Grays, which had been specially fitted up and decorated for the occasion. The plan of meetings was, consider- ation of general topics in morning and evening, and sectional conferences during the afternoon. Subdivisions were discussed under such general heads as \ The money question in n1issions,\ \ The duty of the church,\ ' 4 The need of the volunteer movement,\ etc. The sectional conferences were on evangelical, medical and educational work, the various fields, the work of the various denominations, aud kindred topics. Rev. F. B. Meyer, of England opened the sessions, his subject being '' The Quiet Hour.\ John R. Mott, chairman of the executive co111mittee of the tnovetnent was chainnan of the convention and made one of the ablest addresses. An1ong the noted speakers vvere Rev. Francis E. Clark; President Erving of Lahore College, India; Rev. C. C. Hall, Donald G. Thotnton, fraternal delegate from 5 Great Britain, Z. R. Zwemer, F. R. G. S., . Bishop Ninde, Dr. A. F. Schauffier, Harlan P. Bea:ch, educational secretary of the move- ment, and others. By far the best address was delivered by Robert ~0. Speer, in defense of the 1notto of the n1ovement, which is \ The evangelization of the world in this generation.\ Sl]a.~.~sp~ar~ <eJLJb. Professor Webster gave an infonnal but highly entertaining lecture before the Shakespeare club 'Tuesday evening. He chose as the topic of his retnarl\s Falstafr. Falstaff is a tnaste·r-piece of whose character ' no one can say too n1uch. It was written at a tirne when Shakespeare was esteemed for comedy. Every crHic has a different way of getting over Falstaff's audacious weaknesses. Then £ollov.red a brief description of his youth and tnode of life, especiaHy touching upon his bodily defoi·mities which n1ade him the butt of the company. Had he been a real character we would never have known when he was in a serious mood and when gleeful. One very pleasing attribute of Shakespeare is tl1e development of the ·,cl1aracter before our eyes such as that of King Henry from a bad character to England's best king. His ability is shown in the grouping and placing of his characters. On account of Falstaff's ridiculous figure l1e usually en1ployed his wit in self defence. Other comic characters vanish it1to thin air on close inspection. It is not so with Falstafr. The keynote of his character is his utter irresponsi- bility. H~is profusion of morals is so lacking that we scarcely think of lo<>king for any. F~l~taff was fatnlliar with scripture and often quoted it. His view of a future life was de- cidedly pessimistic and he frequently referred to such things in his conversation. He was really more deserving of sytnpathy than the young king. His early environ1nents ruined hi tn.. He drifted through the joys of life apparently the victitn of circumstances and without moral stamina.

The ·men will start fron1 the gyrnnasiln.n at 10:30 o'clock. The run will not be a hard one and promises to be full of interest. Let everyone who can, take part. :OuR gifted colleague, North College, Esq., ~whose communication appears else-where, broaches a sub. j ect well worthy the consideration of the pre per authorities. The con1munication is timely. It is likewise suggestive. It is timely, because at the tiine of writing the mud is deep. lt is suggestive, because it conjures up a vision of future co m.mencements when a dip. from our our alma mater will postulate web-feet and other things not down in the catalogue. Altogether the communication is deserving the valuable space it occupies. We heartily concur in the opinion that these colun1ns could stand many such. A DECIDEDLY welcome innovation at the mid- winter meet of last Friday night was the introduc- tion of several heavy gymnasium events. This is exactly what has been needed heretofore to make the public take an interest in our annual in-door meet. The ponderous, long drawn-out events are all right in their place, but their place isn't at ~a, public entertaintnent. TJ1,e gymnasium features:J pyramid work, tumbling, etc., invariably receive a greedy reception wherever done with even moderate skill. Under the capable tutelage of our present physical instructor, tbe undergradu- ates have a chance to n1ake some rapid strides in this direction. It is safe to say they wiH not be slow in taking ad vantage of the opportunity. THE action of the sopho1nore class in refusing to take pa;rt in the mid-winter 111eet was downright little and childish. We eannot believe that such a puerile expression of petty distemper declares the sentiments of the class as a whole. The brayer portion of the class put up a plucky fight against overwhelnling nurnbers of fresh111en in the recent snow-ball scriinmage. And smue who are rarer, but braver still, have been attending college meet- ings. These men are manly. And yet t.hey have been so short-sighted, or so careless, as to let the nurslings proclain1 as class song, that touching little ballad, ''I don't want to play in your yard .. , What is it this latter elen1ent really needs ? Is it the gentler atinosphere of a \co-ed.\ institution, or a big dose of George Junior Republic? NEXT Friday night all the undergraduates and all the alumni of Union university within traveling distance, and all the 1ne1nbers of the faculty in- cluded in neither of the above divisions, will be presented an opportunity to eat, talk, and hear good speeches. This opportunity is nothing .less than the undergraduate banquet,-and now is the time to subscribe. Everyone should go. Even those who are too poor to pay their athletic sub- scriptions should go; because, who knows, at the banquet they 1nay discover they're not so poor after all. The committee in charge has labored

There has been during the year a growing ,college sentitnent that upper classm,en and sophomores should give up the idea of separate banquets, and that the whole university banquet together. With this end in view a coUege ·Com- mittee was appointed to attend to the matter. The committee consists of Hild, '98, chairn1an .and toastmaster, Griffith, '98, Vander Veer, '99 and Francis, 1900. They have been at work fnr a number of weeks and the definite results of . their vvork are nearly ready to appear. March 1 I has been decided on as the date. Presi- ·dent Raymond has been invited to speak on the subject '' Alma Mater; \ Dr. Perkins on the subject '' Retniniscences;\ Joseph A. Law- son on the Law deparhnent; Wtn. Hailes, Jr., .-on the Medical departr:nent; W. G. Tucker, on the Pharmaceutical department ; a law under- graduate on \ Men;\ a medical student on \ The Ladies;\ a college u.ndergraduate on \ Our Banquet;\ A. J. Dillingham on Ath- letics; V\t.,.illian1 Grant Brown (Father Et·own), who is a graduate of both college and law . -school, on \The University.\ The banquet is to be held at the hostelry of -our friend Charles Brown, and the price ha.s been fixed at $r .50 per plate, on the estimate that a hundred men will be present. This n utnber must attend in order that expenses may be .. cleared. It is hoped too that a precedent may be established, and the whole college should be present at what it is hoped will prove to be the inception of a new university institution. tniQor Topie&;. Edward H. Rodgers, '98, has passed the State civil service exatnination for clerkships in the State departments. The voluble general agents of book concerns .are beginning their annual tours and making .life miserable for the students. Editor Gonco(rdiensis: I read some time ago that the engineers of the senior class, were engaged in designing a system of .sewers for the town of JYliddleburgh. While this opportunity is doubtless soul-inspiring for them, there is another which appeals much 1nore strongly to the college at large. The season of spring freshets is now with us, and we know only too well that at the slightest provocation the walks on the terrace get into a .state which is simply a disgrace to any institution which pre tends to teach engineering. To the uninitiated the situation seems to offer every facility for draining off the water, and I for one believe that if the me1nbers of the engineering department shottld devote their minds to the problem, they could solve it. They would thereby earn the gratitude of many pc,rsons who are not an1phibi ous by conviction, though they may become so by necessity, and who object to s\riunning beyond their depth. The Philistines of the outside world occasionally declare that college education is not practical. Can we blame them, when we send our engineers off into the woods, and ourselves waHow in the slush? If, however, the time of the en- gineers is too valuable to be devoted to son1ething which is really useful, perhaps our genial superin- tendent of grounds can be induced to grapple with the problem; and .at the rate with which cer.tain long-promised improven1ents come, those of us who are freshmen may possibly live to see old Union's carnpus in such a condition that we shall not be ashamed to ask our friends to walk on it, even in a cloud-burst .

His name is Abraham Marks. He says that Mrs. Stowe wished to localize \Uncle Tom's Cabin,\ and. some one told her he was the only attorney in the vicinity. Judge Marks-he was made a Probate Judge by Sam Houston-has had a checkered career. Graduating from Union College in 1832, he studied law, was admitted to the bar, and went to New Orleans. From there he went to Monroe, La., where be established The Standard. His con duet of that paper drew him into several duels, and he

The Co11cordiellsis VoL. XXI. UN~ON COLLJD-GE, MARCH 12, 1898. No. 21. ~oQt~st of Orators. The fifth annual contest of the New York State Inter-collegiate Oratorical League com- prising Rochester, Syracuse and Union univer- sities was held at the State street Methodist church last Thursday ,evening, before an appre- ciative audience. Syracuse has held the chan1- pionship for the last two years, whi 1 le Rochester and Union have been the victors one each. R. Har,mon Potter, '95, won the prize for Union in I 895· Tjhe exercises were opened by a banjo solo by Heern1ance, 1901, accompanied by M. Greene. Peter Nelson, '98, the president of the league, in a brief address outlined its aim and object and introduced the first speaker of the evening, Mr. Ira S. Wile, Rochester, '98, whose subject was \Liberty and Oratory.\ The speaker maintained that the growth of freedom is seen in the development of oratory. He traced the progress of oratory from the time when Demosthenes aroused the Athenians by his ,eloquence, to Rome with Cicero as the ex- ponent of liberty, to England with her Burke and Pitt, and lastly to America. He claimed that progress can be measured by oratory and instanced the Protestant Reformation under Luther, and the independence of the United States, influenced by the eloquence of the colo- nial orators. In reviewing the place of oratory in the world at the present time, he contrasted Russia and Turkey where liberty and eloquence are dead, to England and Arnerica, where the bar, the pulpit and the press ask for recognition in tl1e promotion of freedom. He said that oratory cannot perish so long as a liberty-loving n1ortal shall live, that the decadence of oratory will tnark the death of liberty. Mr. Wile had a cleat 4 , full voice, spoke with ease and marked distinctness, but his gestures were unnatural. Mr. A. J. Neff, Syracuse, 'g8, was the next speaker. His subject was \'The Rock of Our Nation, George Washington.\ The speaker said that the attributes of Washington had influenced thousands and millions of lives, that before him the world had waited six thousand years to produce such a n1an, that a hundred years has hardly passed and history has yet to find a genius who is his equal. It might be said of him that he had no youth, but was born a man. His career as a warrior, a statesman and a man of noble character was enthusiastically treated. His courage and skill at the evacua- tion of Boston, at the crossing of the Delaware, and at Yorktown .. ~nd his great part in the guidance and development of the colonies was clearly and logically set forth. He contrasted the methods of Napoleon and Washington, and compared the proud bearing of the former in the titne of victory, to the deep reverence of the latter, who stood as before the presence of his God and celebrated every victory with a prayer of thanksgiving. His oration was excellent and showed much thought and study. His style of delivery was in marked contrast to the previous speaker. His sentences were hurried at times and his enunciation lacked perfect distinctness. He had an easy stage presence and his gestures were very effective. The third speaker was Williatn Dewey Louclu;, Union, Igoo, who had selected for his oration, \Napoleon Bonaparte.\ In the intro- duction the speaker described in an effective manner the death scene of the great Napoleon on the lonely isle of St. Helena, contrasting the scene within, to a great storm that was raging on the sea without. He then rapidly reviewed the career of the man through all the tides of fortune to his final exile. Power was his aim, his dream, his destiny. Entire Europe was baffled by his genius. His divorce from Joseph- ine, the speaker said, could not be justified.

THE OONCORDIENSIS. The one blot on his escutcheon was inordinate ambition ; he sacrificed everything to this aim. He was the father of France ; the soldiers wor- shipped him, the peasants adored hin1. Napo- leon was selfish and unscrupulous, but his love of patriotis,m~ places him among the world's great men. Mr. Loucks had a graceful pres- ence, a clear, strong voice and an effective delivery. His gesture were animated and . expresstve. The judges, Rev. E. G. Seldon, D. D., of Albany, Rev. vV. H. Waygood and Mr. H. C. Levins of this city, were out nearly fifteen min- utes before they arrived at a decision. On their return, Rev. Mr. Seldon, in behalf of the com- mittee, awarded the prize, a gold key, to Mr. Loucks. The decision ·\vas not unanimous. The exercises were brought to a close by the singing of the '' Union Victory Song,\ by the students in the audience. The officers of the league under whose charge the contest was held were : President, Peter Nelson, Union, '98; vice-president, Ira S. Wile, Rochester, '98; secretary and treasurer, Mal- colm G. Thomas, Union, '98; executive com- mittee, Wm. L. Fisher, '98; J. C. Jessup, Rochester, '99; W. I-f. Michell, Syracuse, '99· The committee of arrangements consisted of Peter Nelson, M.G. Thomas and W. L. Fisher. A meeting of the executive committee was held Thursday afternoon, and the following officers were elected for the ensuing year: Preii- dent, Burt Meet, Rochester ; vice-president, H. A. O'Day, Syracuse ; secretary and treasurer, J. L. Broughton, Rochester ; executive com- mittee, W. G. Parkes, Rochester; C. L. Palmer, Syracuse, and one representative from Union to be selected. The sixth annual contest will be held at Rochester in March, 1899· Sage Chapel at Cornell is to he torn down and rebuilt on an enlarged plan. The Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Oratorical Union held its sixth annual contest last night at Easton. Seven colleges were represented, Lehigh, Lafayette, Swarthmore, Franklin and Marshall, Ursinus, Muhlenbarg and Gettysburg. . .Editor Concordiensis: In no department of' e&-Uege life are students quicker to recognize tbe p!Pesence of a new and active element than intlrHdepartrnent of athletics. .And when that element t11.ites on a human form and shows itself capable of' Jna.king sacrifices to a ca1:1se-· when in short,. tbe na.1ae of that ele1nent is John W. H. Pollard, ~t js· '<>lilly sightless ingrati- tude that fails to respolild. Sightless ingratitude is not a characteristic .(;)f U\ nion college students ; and now we have a faulUess. :pair of premises and · the conclusion is that al!l! nJen of Union college will respond to his call. It is a strange thing indeed to hear the appeal for money in a tnoderate. a.Jllilount as though men did not recognize that Hvery dollar put into the athletic treasury quick.e:ns nuch 1nore than a dollar's worth the whot.e 1H:~aJthful activity of the college. Such a penn.y-wise and pound-foolish doctrine goes a vast way iu k!eeping from men the , fruits of education; yet. vv.e can understand the motive. But the Inotive is uot so plain that keeps men in their rooms on a. clea.r bright day, when the athletic instructor .has ,tnade preparations for a. good run across couatry, or when twenty or thirty men are out on a. h._are and hounds chase. In the past few years as nTauy as forty men have come out for a single rl!ln and the number wa.s thought extraordinary. J3ut eonsidering that run- ning is the most beneficia!~ form of exercise, and is the beginning of most of the training for the track team, it seems straEge that out of over two hundred men only a te:r:rtb. find it possible to get out at any one tirne, .and tllat a fifth is considered an extraordinary nulllb>er. It would be more .sane to think that a ha.U :should take part ia the sport at a given tirne.. 'Tb.is sounds big, but it certa.inly is reasonable. After deducting those whose engagements confUct with the hour of the run, and those who a..re :physically unable, it is harcl to believe that tlLer-e are less than a hundred men left.
