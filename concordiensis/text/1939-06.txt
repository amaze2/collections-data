Walter S. Giffm·d, President of American Telepltone and Telegraph Company and prominent plhil.anthr()pist, wiU make the principal address at the 144th annual Commencement exercises to be held l\londay morning im :the Memorial Chapel. In his capacity as Honorary Chancellor, Mr. Giff:ord will speak on \Business--Today's Fm·emos.t. Pmfession\. The Rev. Mr. W. N. P. Dailey of Schenectady, who has been secre- tary of the class since 1883, reports that from a recent survey of Amer- Ican colleges it was learned that Union's class of '84 is the on.ly col- lege class in the country which has met annually in formal class re- union during the past 55 years. It was discove1•ed that the Amherst class of 1884 was the runner-up, meeting informally each year, but only once every rtve years at the college commencements. The class of '84 is unique in an- other respect, In the fall of 188ll it elected Pickens Neagle of Wash- ington, D. C., president and Dailey secretary. These men are still serv- ing the class in the same positions after 56 yeat·s of service as class officers and this in itself may con- stitute a national record. One Quarter of Class Remain Time has thinned the ranks of the cla,;s until today only 17 of the original 71 members remain, al- though the fact that George R Lunn, former mayor of Schenectady and present New York State Public Se1vice Commissione1·, is an hon- or·ary member of the class, makes the total eighteen.

Carroll, who for the past \ten years has been director .of the Mountebanks Theatre and m- structor in English, will leave the college at the conclusion of the academic year to enter the profes- sional theatre. As one of the organize!'s of the Schenectady Civi<: Players more than ten years ago and as the director of the Mountebanks dur- ing the most fruitful years in that organization's history, Mr. Carroll entered fully into the civic and cul- tural life of Schenectady and Union College. Now he intends to leave the academic world and devote his en- tire time to the professional thea- tie. He will retain his position this summer as chairman of the Mo- hawk Drama Festival Institute, and in addition will direct the prnfes- sional company of the Festival m Moliere's \School for Husbands.\ While an undergraduate at Union from 1923 to 1927 Mr. Carroll was the outstanding actor jn the .li'Ioun- tebanks, And In 1928, when he re- turned as Instructor in English Serves Union Ten Year:s EDWARD L, CAR.ROLL retary of the Council during ·the after a year's graduate «ludy at Co- past year, succeeds David L.

We feel, ho\'l:evel', that commencements are mot·ose euuugh without our joining in the wailing chorus and pointing out the good times that these men enjoyed as undergTad- uates, the friendships that have been made, and the many other concommitants of col- leg·e life which now become thing-s of the past. Our message to the class of 1939 hm' rather to do with the future. With their undergraduate career now closed, these meli will soon be accepted into the ranks of Union alumni, and it is in thi~ capacity that each member can be of untold assistance to his \grand old alma mater.'' We can think of few titles which com- mand the respect and admiration associated with that of \loyal alumnus,\ and it is our hope that the class of 1939 will g-reatly swell the forces of our man;v loyal gTaduates. Proba:bly but few of them will be in a posi- tion to make large financial contl·ibutions to the college, but this does not preclude their becoming- true alumni-it is the spirit which is important. We, therefore, ask the members of the class of 1939 to keep in touch with Union hy correspondence, by reading the Alumni J.\Ionthly and The Concordiensis. Alumni have proved invaluable in acquainting pros- pective students with the college, and we hope that the graduating class will aid in this respect. Attend your class reunions, cheer the Dutchmen at athletic contests, and visit the campus whenevel' the opportunity affords itself. Au i·evoir, farewell, and Godspeed. ltllt JJt, :--t· \\Ill• h.Wt'.\ :tJ•Plt·- l'l;ttt·d lht· f:wt t!J;d ,J.d\t' '.'.:\.., 111 Tllt·I'•· t h•,IJ ill C. tilt' \\ •·) \-\-l•ldc- tail 11'- lliJ)\''s l•tll- llatll rt·t II( I] : .. !i\'t•:O: ·~Ut't't•t•d · 111·..: ~t\ttt·tath•lt:-- ;111 <.tlllto'-1 illlj!l .~ .. 1i1it ~~ .11 .1.1 \\ itH )I t\ ~htl•-1 ~ lt'Till )]1111 t'-IJP ('}it\\ II Jll illt't:' uf l\niull.

The third annual Ft·eshman Camp was the first collegiate ac- tiv-ity ,of the year, being held at Lake George from September 9 to 13. The academ,ic procession and the opening day exercises on Sep- ter.nber 19 and the address deli-ver- ed ,by Henry Seidle Canby marked the beginning of classes as rushing -wee'k drew to a close with the total of 171 out of 287 freshmen pledged to the fraternities. September was marked by the award,ing of the Berg Cup to the Kappa Nu fra- ternity which achieved a new high sch0'lastic rating of 4.8. The ,f!,rst football game with Colby College was \stormed\ out, but on the 31st the season opened as, we dro,pped a dose one to Trinity, 19-13. pus. The basketball team shel- iacked R.P.I., 53-25 on the lOth, but the Engineers gai,ned revenge 1nd upset us. the next week, 34-32. Dr. Samuel E. Monison ;;poke at the Founder's Day ex:ercises on ·February 22 and thr•ee days latu the freshmen ended, their week of hell as 128 of them were fm·mally initiated into the frateznities. On the ,last day of the month Dr. ,Charles N. Waldron r<esig;ned his ,post as editor of the Alumni Monthly, ending twenty-live years of service in that capacity. The Mountebank's production, 'Rosmersholm,\ ushered ·in March, as Dr. Paul Zahl returned fro)Il British Guiana with a few hundred ants. Hequembourg retiled from the ed-itorship of the Coneordy and was replaced by Lal'l'Y Pellettier; twelve meN were elected to Sigma Xi on the 8th. 'The social event of the month featured the Skidmore- Union Glee Club Concez<t and dance on our campus, The long awaited exchange student appointment went to Johnny Lewis who will represent us at St. Andrews next year. The first annual Block \U\ Day pro- ;ram was held in Memorial Chapel featuring an address by Leo Bolley and the presentation of awards to 252 athletes. dict's dream, this lurid tale sprout- ed on thP nation's front pages last week. Its amazed discoverer was Representative Martin Dies, cha,ir- man of the House committee on un- Amel·ican activities. Back in 1937, as Dies pieced to- gether the fantastic story, Dudley Pierpont Gilbert, a well-to-de Man- hattan clubman, heard stories of subversive plotting from a man calli,ng himself Geot·ge Rice, a waiter. Rice d'eclared a group of prominent men, mostly Jewish, was conspiring to foment a revolution and had a secret army of 150,000 men ready to seize power at any moment. Though he made no effort to check the story, Gilbert became greatly alarmed. He began to send Rice's \in in the form of reports signed \Uncle Dud1ey\ to James E. Campbell, an Army re- serve captain of Owensboro, Ky. Campbell forwarded the reports which were heavily laced with anti- Semitic propaganda and slurs on President and Mrs. Roosevelt, to a picked group of 40, including many American Legionnaires. On the mailing list were one George Death- erage of St. Albans, W. Va., and Major-Genet·al George Van Horn M0seley Deatherage is chief of a frankly anti-Semitic organization called the Knights of the White Camellia. Moseley, who retired last year as commander of the Army's Fifth Corps Area <with headquar- ters at Atlanta Ga.), has since made public speeches flaying the New Deal and openly attacking Jews. <i> ··-~~-·-------- By ANDREW FRJ:rCH 'indicates tha. t i~e. ~.ditot.'S ma~: not I ~he articl~ seems to be ~n.deav.orin~ THE IDOL for May is, in gen- be too ac(ive)y s~eking Ol.!\ wnters. m some roundabout fash10n ~o ex era!, both literate and dignified, It The caption edi,tor who put the cuse his existence. ~he tone lS, un- may lack that appeal fOI' the en- phrase, \Count 1 ·y-wide Biologists\ necessarily ~polog~ttc.

Furthermore, the author of The authm· of WILL AND TEST- AMENT is, understandably enough,, anonymous. Anyone who would perpetuate such sentences as \It is because of the indecisiveness of these Germans to fear one side less than the other definitely that is keeping the democracies awake at night,\ ought to be anonymous.

On the 8th Swa,rthmore squeezed eut a victory in football in the closing minutes. 1'8--15, as the class of '42 celebrated the first \Freshman Day.\ Seven :men were elected to Phi Beta Rappa, on the 15th, the football team battled Vermont to a 7-7 draw, and on 'the following Saturday our traditional rivals, R.P.I., succumbed to a powerful Garnet attack, 27-13. Mayor Fiorello LaGuazdia of New 'York City spoke in the Memodal Chapel, and Williams won 13-6 as the month ended. .A victory over Rochester's foot- ball team ushered in November. :Hamilton Weekend was the high- lig:ht of the month and brought Ma:l Hallett's band and a victory ov<'!r Hamilton, 21-0, not to mention 1\!:~·s. Franklin D. Roosevelt and Rexford Tugwell. November also went out in a blaze of glory as a fir-e ravaged Washburn Hall. The Glee Club Concert and Dance at the Mohawk Club was tops on the social calendar for April followed by the .first Fresh- man Dance in the gym on the 21st. Chris Fahy was elected editor of the Freshman Handbook and Dave Light to the corresponding posi- tion on the Idol. Caryl Haskins spoke at the Prize Day exercises as 31 awards for service and scholar- ship were made. The athletic events were topped by West Point's appearance against the Garnet track team and the Graduate Coun- cil's pledge of $2,100 for the im- provement of Alexander Field. May brought Junior Pr·om and Charlie Barnet's orchestra, and Prom brought ... well most any- thing. Walter Sherman Gifford, president of the American Tele- phone and Telegraph Co., was ap- pointed as Honorary Chancellor •nd Bobenstab, Turchick and An- derson were elected class presi- dents. The baseball tea:rn downed R.P.I. at Cooperstown and the 24th started exam week In Gilbert's reports, correspond- ence spread before the Dies com- mittee proved, CampbeH, Deather- age and Moseley found a common bond. To Deatherage, Moseley wrote: \The most serious problem confronting America today is just this problem of the Jew and how to get rid of his influence.\ And to . Campbell: \If the Jews 'bump me ' off, see that they get credit for it -It will help our cause.\ ])ecember with its snow a,lso brought the \Insidious Insider\ to th<'! front with his debate with Paffrath before an audience of twelve people.

LEWIS, '41 As Bill Ketz's time-worn phrase puts it, Union varsity teams built :ots of character this spring, while their yearling confreres were busy turning in the wins. And yet things could have been worse: the re- :!apitulation at this point finds the varsity squads with a record of 11 victmies, 21 defeats, and ene to go, and the frosh at the end af their campaign with 14 wins. 5 losses, and a tie. Among the upperclass outfits, the 13 1 1:.-112 1 1! (West Point). Hawever, as Coach Ketz had planned, this egged the Garnet on \o hard work during the next week and a decisive win from Rochester. Despite a prom the night before, Union took the measure of Hamilton, and, on the foliowing Saturday, of Vermont. Prospects loomed for a very suc- cessful season, but on May 27 R.P.I. stood in the way with a spirited and capable outfit which managed a twelve-point victory. Letters, Nume·rals One hundred and ten Union Col- lege undergraduates won letters or nume1'als in recognition of their serv-ices with four varsity and Jive freshman spring sports team, ac- cording to the list releacsed by Pro- fessor J.

For Auld Lang Syne UNION MEN OF NOW AND THEN WILL MEET AT THE UNION INN 517 UNION STREET 8 good drinks and food e the true college atmosphere e we'll see you there Because of the 10 to 2 de- feat at the hands of Sy1·acuse at the start of the season, Union will be the underdog today, but the team is much in~proved since its first con- test and should give the Orange its share of troubles. Poor fielding was the main factor in Syracuse's victory and since the team has smoothed out considerably, an even battle is expected. AI Mould will be throwing them in to Harry Palmer for the Dutchmen. The batting order for the Garnet is as follows: Alex Turchick, third base; Captain Frank Myers, second base; \Moe\ Wein- traub, right field; Charlie Brockner, first base; l\lickey Rathlev, leading the team in batting with a .400 mark, shortstop; Bob Feldman, cen- ter field; Billy Thomas, left field; Palmer, and Mould. Charlie Brockner is the team's slugger, having hit two homers, several triples and doubles this season. He is second in the batting pa- rade with an average of .393. Palmer is third with .313, Turchick fourth with .308, and from there on down the players are below the exclu- sive \.300 class.\ \Swede\ Hanson is leading the pitching staff with two wins and no losses. In five games he has struck out eight, walked 14. Mould has lost two games against no wins, and has also walked 14, striking out 10. \Chet\ Rob~ inson has lost three games, striking out six and walking 11. Wildness on the part of the pitchers has been a dis- tinct disadvantage to the team, and several times it has been the sole cause for the losses.

Now Is The Time For Every Good Union Alumnus to the fact that a rainfall within three days of a fo()tball garne spoils the contest from a spectator poi1~t of view, a.s it usually resolves itself into litt]e more or less than a g-lorified mud fig-ht. Five of the six home baseball games sched11led for this spring have been cancelled beca.use of wet grounds, and \Bill\ Ketz, trad coach, has pointed out that the soggy track h.a.s been a s.evere handicap to his runners and jumpers. coaches have stressed the additional fact that chances of injuries to athletes are greatly increased by the insecure footing af- forded by the soggy turf. \Nels\ Nitchman, football mentor, wrote that the condition of the field \has aff.ected the feet of several of our players to the extent that corrective measures have been necessary,\ and \Bill\ Ketz reminds us of the y.ear in which one of our crack runners was incapacitated for an entire season after stumbling in one of the drainage ditches which had been dug to drain the track. to come to the aid of his alma mater and do his bit in the repairing of Alexander Field. To those graduates not familiar with the condition of the field, may we point to the adjoining pictures, which depict its condition more vividly than could several thousand words. For years the administration has realized that this field was in need of repair, but it was felt that the money needed to put in condition was needed more elsewhere, so President Fox has indicated that he hopes that Union's alumni will adopt the rehabili~ tation of the field as their own proj.ect. The amount necessary for this work has been set at $15,000, and since the Graduate Council has pledged approximately $2,000, but $13,000 will be required to provide Union with a credita;ble athletic field. All undergraduates will bear testimony In ]etters to The Concordiensis, the All coaches point to the fact that Alexan- der Field, in its present condition is a cam- pus \eye so.re\ instead of the beautiful spot which, by virtue of its picturesque location, it should be. As spokesman for the undergraduate body of Union, The Concordiensis expresses the earnest hope that the alumni now assembled on the campus will see fit to aid in the cam- paign to repair the field. Coach Art Law- rence expressed our sentiments when he wrote \The contributors to this worthy cause and those who will contribute for its completion are to be congratulated and thanked no end.\
