Last to survive of three Simtlar sections which once drew delegates from colleges throughout the coun- try, the Middle Atlantic Sec~ion meets this year for the first trme not as a League of Nations but aE; a conference of the United Nations.

Each college or university par- ticipating will be asked to re.present one of the United Nations and to assign a student delegate to ea~h of five commissions. The commts· sions will concern themselves with wartime cO:llaboration of the United Nations in non-mliitary fields, struc- ture and powers of a new. world order, international protectiOn . of human rights, economic integratiOn of the world, and maintenance of world order after the war.

Stevens '17: \Your article in the Alumni Re- view with refer·ence to the Idol brought ,back many memories of warm friendships as a result of spending a night around the Idol protecting it against the attacks of the s>ophomore class and then ag-ain of endeavoring to take it away from the freshmen the following year. \It seems to me that it would be a shame to give up this fine old tradition as it certainly develops friendships among your own class- mate~ and those of the clatis ahead and hPhinrl you that outlast many of the other fl'iendships that you make during the four undergradu- ate years. \I have often noted, when having an opportunity to visit the campus, that so many times, the reunion groups reminisce amout the nights spent in defending or fighting for the Idol. \Personally I think it is a fine tradition and one which should be kept. A few more good old fash- ioned scraps and a little lese of this modern thinking would ma:ke a lot better boys when it comes to taking life's knocks in everyday walks of industry and competition.\ ----01---- : UCRS Names Platzer · l?usiness Manager I Drtvid Platzer '45 was elected .

Of A General Nature Fortv-three members of the Class of Hll:1 complete their college courses one \reek !'rom Sunday morning. As one campHs editol'ialist put it recently, it is \a group of ~·oung· men who emolled last summer for the accelerated program in order that they miv:l1t face po::-;- .sible death ::;ix months sooner tlwn their classmates.\ However harshly tho::-;e \\'lll'lb may strike the eye of the casual reader, Wl' have an idea the group the least impres:;eci uy this Lit of melodramatic composition \\'<l.S -that same group which will walk out of :\lemorial Chapel fol' the last time on Decem- ber 20. If we may speak for that group, we'd like to say that our motives fo1· acceleration have been rather Ladly misinterpreted, re- gardless of how much such a dmmatically morbid phrase as the one quoted may help to liven up a pl'inted page. We're finishing six months ahead of schedule Lecause. in so do- ing, we wanted to be sure that we graduated. If there's one salient characteristic to be found in this college generation, it's probably the tendency to be realistic. There hasn't been the wave of hurried enlistments into active service that marked the Fi1·st \\' ol'ld \Var, but we don't think that's due to any drop in the patriotic zeal of American youth. :;\lore than likely it's due to om belief that there will be more need for college-trained men after this thing is over than ever before. And \ve've taken adnmtage of the govel·n- ment's policy of allowing us to finish school by enlisting in one or the other of the reserve gmups. nl'Cessitate. 1 i\iaturday \Examinations End.

The fact that a certain percentage of the 45 men may not again enjoy the peace-time existence we've alwars known is likewise recognized.

Of A Personal Nature We consider it most fortunate that the end of our period of duty as edito1· of this paper coincides with our departure from Cnion. This is due to the vei'Y simple fact that, in the space of three and a half years, \college\ has come to mean more and more \The Con- cordiensis.\ As a matte1· of fact, this activit~· of our choice has proua:bly been ovei·-empha- sized, if anything. We've given up a lot of things we could have enjoyed if it had not been foi' OUl' ties with the paper, we shudder to think of the class hours we've missed in putting it out (at the same time giving thanks to and for those professors who have \understood\), and the span of our life has ficult task of keeping The Concordy before William Raymond Coates, October 1 5, 1942 ' the eyes of the campus in the next few Emlen Tracy Hutchins, October 21,: months.

It is particularly appropriate that Mr. Williams' book should come up for discussion on December 11, so near the anniversat·y of the Nippon- ese attacl{ on Pearl Harbor, as the climax of the work, almost the final sentence, is the radio flash that the Japs had opened hostilities. The book is essentially the story of the relationship between a father and his adolescent son during the period of mounting tension, which saw this country swing from isola- tionism to war-psychology and sup- port of the administration. The reviewers December 11 will be Granville Hicks, Edith Walton, book reviewer on the New York Herald Tribune and Charles Lee, of the Philadelphia Record.

L. \\'nod worth ( l'. of Idaho, '24) in the G-E Carrier Current I.aborator). Designed to operate on carrier current systems, the new gadget makes it possible to contact civilian-deiense workers without increasing the load on telephone lines. When the air-raid signal is sent from the transmitter at the power station, the home warning device (which resembles an ordinary house meter) hegins to buzz. After it has called attention to itseli, the device lights up, and on its dial appears a colored signal-yellow ior prelim- inary caution, blue for advance caution, red for air raid, or white for all clear that quarters.

La•bs prevent many of the players from r.eporting early, if at a·ll, but n0w that hygiene classes f0r freshmen have been completed, freshmen will be able to turn out on Mondays. ScrimmagP Test Men Last Friday eveniBg the cagers had a two-hour scrimmage with the G-E Test Five, in which the whole squad had an opp0rtunity to d~s­ play its abi1ity. Semerad was satis- fied with the o:howing of his first five, .but the remainder of the squad demonstrated a number of individ- ual weaknesses Which are being worked on at the present time. On the first five were Bob Bartlett, Bill O'Neill, Hal Enstice, Reggie Car- roll and Mike Martuscello. Johnny Clowe, who will probably be one of the six or seven men fighting for starting· bE>rths. was not at the scrimmage. For the two weeks Semerad has been experimenting with eeveral types of offensive and defensive play. and now that he has seen his squad in action, he has been plan- ning a definite offense and defense which he will give to the squad the end of this week prior to examina- tions. 23-Man SQuad Although a 23-man basketball squad seems a bit unwieldy, it would be almost impossible for Semerad to hold a scrimmage on any par- ticular day if he did not have a large squad. Some days only 14 men show up for practice. A num- ber of players get to the sessions about 4:30, too Ia te to get some of the instructions which Semerad has given the squad earlier in the af- tez noon drill. Besides this, it is practically impossible to get the squad together so that various com- binations can be tried. However, Semerad expects that when he gives the squad its set offense and de- fense the players will sohow up bet- ter than they have so far. ----0---~ Wheeler Enlists !

It was the fourth quarter, with two minutes to go. The Giants led their interborough rivals the Brook- lyn Dodgers, by 10-0. A Giant fum- ble gave the Dodgers the baH on the New York 5 ya1d line. Three line smashes b1·ouhgt the ball to the one yard line.

Many Articles on Hein Last week sportswriters had a field day. Many articles appeared on Mel Hein <one appeared in last week's Concordy) praising him for his achievements as a player, as a team man, as a great captain. and for his clean play and demean0r. John Kieran, New Yo1k Times col- umnist, suggested Mel as the Chev- alier Bayard of football \sans peur et sans reproche\ in his tribute last Sunday. Hein's teammates gave him a boisterous farewell last Saturday following the final practice session Hardly had Steve Owen blown his whistle to end the sessions when the entire squad pounced on Mel and ripped off his practice uniform.
