Any hope that Union's projected field house wili be on a p!U' with . that of RPI must nQIW' be - aban- : dqned. Municipal projects such as . concerts and noted · speakers will have to bow to the lack ofadequate · finances. Dr. Davidson said, \The Union field house will be built pri- marily for our own athletic, intra- mural, and ROTC programs.\ Dela'y Necessary The necessary negotiations may take several weeks, but the admin- istration has high hopes that agree- ment can be reached. While these discussions are in progress it is · impossible to make public the names of the bidding firms or the approximate level of the proposed bids. At present, the committee . bas at its disposal $311,000 ra..i:sed in the alumni drive s e veral years ago. At that tizr.e it ·wa::; expected that this sum would aln . ost suificc to build the field house as planned. Due to the freeze on building ma- terials at the start of the Korean War, however, it was impossible to build at that time. When the ·ban was lifted other delays ensued, and therefore at present we find our- selves with a field house that must be built and a desperate lack of sufficient funds to · built it. Un- fortunately, the government can no longer help finance the project, since Congress has alloted no more . funds that can be used ae grants for ROTC buildings. Therefore, the deficit must be made up by special appropriation of the Board of Trustees.

The Straight and Narrow Cono-ratulations to the students of Union, who last weel\- e'lld. dranic th ir first college-sanctioned liquor with matureness allct 1·esponsi bility. 'I'he newly proposed liquor rules, having gone \nto effect ove-r the past prom weekend, caused many men to guess at tlte- .probable student reaction. The Concordiensis firmly be- lieved that the men of Union College would earn their new J:>rivilege, and we are no\Y sure that our view was justified. Well versed ih ·the history of many obscu1'e British rhetoricians of a bygone era, Lord Dunsany, standard-bearer of the old-school poets, bitterly a.ssailed modern poets and modern verse in general at one of the best attended pro- grams .of the college lecture series. Failing to exploit to the fullest advantage of his o-bviously quite sym.pathetic audience, his personal friendships with the authors of whom he spoke, Lord Dunsany chose instead to read poorly sev- eral selections from the -works of the poets he bas known. 'l'he eld- erly Irish lord devoted a great deal of time to \A. E.\ who he felt was the greatest of all Irish poets. \A. El.\ a littie research disclosed, was an early twentieth century roma.ntic and mystic whose exotic tales of the orient were popular in his day, but have since been forgotten by all but a very few students of English literature. Stephen Phillips, a poetic dramat- ist, also \Vas favored with a great deal of Lord Dunsany's time, and, in fact, sounded more interesting to me than \A. E.\ despite the lat- ter's undue prai&e in the couxse of the evening. Following the mention of a few more dead meter-ists, Lord Dun· sany talked of William Butle1 Yeats, the wTiter of some of the most beautiful poetry ever written in the English language. Dunsany conceded that Yeats was indeed a fine poet, and e.ven struggled through a poem of his to prove this admiration; but, alas, poor Yeats, though he had a great talent, even greater than \A. E.\ his worli rwas not an it could have been, had he been more meticulous in his meter. At this point in the program, the aged aristocrat delighted his audi- ence with some remarks on mod- ern verse ·which he apparently thought were 'funny. The mature audience laughed, sn I suppose that there was humor in. unsup- ported criticism of a poet of the stature of T. S. Eliot. Dunsany was magnanimous enough to cloak the author of a supposedly typical piece of modern verse in anony- mity, as he stumbled through it wcith little semblance of grace. A consultation with a mem.ber of the Union College English department revealed the poet to be the much- maligned Eliot. Dylan Thomas and Dr. Edith Sitwell, as rwell as the more radical poets of today, were completely ignored, probably for the best, .as Dunsany's remarks indicated that no fair . and objec- tive comment could possibly be ex- pected.- On the subject of the drama, Lord Dunsany, best known as a playwright - his most successful efforts being \If\ and \A Night at an Inn,\ had his only lucid com- ment of the entire evening. He iterated his often expressed opinion that drama should be visual as well as verbal, and that \the dramatic incident\ is all too seldom seen in modern plays. He didn't com- zr.ent on any modern plays. During the period following the lecture, in which the audience :was free to ask questions, no one ques- tioned Dunsany's contention that all poetry should be easily under- standable to a boy of fourteen (his age when he first read Tennyson) and so I could only conclude that this idea had pretty general ac- ceptance. It seems to me that this point is, open to debate. It has been stated, however, by many members ,of the f~c11lty and several students that they saw an abnormally hi['h amount of alcohol present on campus over the weekend. The amount was quite deceiving und~r the circumstances with -which liquor made-its appearance at Union. Letter to the Editor First it must be remembered that this was a prom weekend,' meaning- that bottles appea~·ed on two evenings, rat he I' than on the cm•tomnry one evenmg of the usual party weekend. A. ched: with some of the liquor stores neDr cam- pus showed that the quantity of liquor purchased did not ex- cee,d b· murh that ordinarily bought fm a prom weekend. Second, we must realize that this ·was the first public appearanC'e of hard liquor on the ~ampus .. T.his •. alone, ;vould ma \ke am· amount >'Pen appear qmte magmf1ed m relatiOn to tlle anotint actunllr used hy each student. This is a point in- caJ>able of Leing overemphasized in comideration of the past weelcenct. Perhpas t hr mMt impor1:ant point before us is that this ~·asanentirelv ne\Y inno\·ation at l:nion. Vnlike children who had i ust been' g-iven new toys and played with them until all but ~xhau!'tf'rl, thr ~tuclent~ found themselves in possession of something- ne\\' but phLyed with it wisely. We expected the first respon::;e to the new liquor rules to be more than the usual amount of drinking hy the studer>ts. Fortunately, we Y\'e:re proven wronp:, for the first \wet\ weekend produced no unusual displays of new ownership,~the students did not abuse thei1; recentl.v acquired prb.;ilege. Furthermore, we be- lieve that the amount of liquor drunk on campus will drop even lower once the noveltY of freedom has worn off. In speaking with the men assigned to lceep order around the campus, we disrovered that this was an ordinary prom vve.ekend. There \-..·as no more than the usual amount of minor disturbances. There were no indications of violation of the liquor rules. There was, in other words, no reason to believe that the men of 'L'nion had assumed their new responsibilities without the proper attitude. · . We must conclude that the Tl'Ustees were rewarded for t.l1e faith they placed in the student body. The students, con- comitantly, were re\\·arded with recognition as mature indi- vici uaJs capable of depo1ting themselves properly in adult cir- e1!mstances. -G. R. K. February 22, 1954 Editor Concordiensis Dear Sir: When the Concordiensis began its \O!'ange Squeeze,\ the purpose of the campaign W8..5 twofold: first, to get the price o.-f orange juice r~­ duced, and second, to get the facts known about the college dining hall situation. The President then appointf'd a conurittee to study the mnttf'r. A;;. on<' of the student;;. a..c:k- ed to RervP on the C'ommittee. I nc- rPpted my tmk heenusP I thought thE' studr might lead to better un- derstanding of a much mil<undf'!'- stood situation by- students, faculty, and administration alike. In its eage1 ness to congratulate itself on bringing the committee into being. the Concordiensis has apparently overlooked the fact that the ··orange Squec•ze\ can;.]Jaign s prime goal has not yet been achieved. The faculty, student body, and many administration peo- ple do not yet know the facts of the college dining hall situation, either before the :re-alignment of managements or- even now. In fact, .the only poeple who I am sure do know of the facts of the past are the study cornmittee members, the President, Mr. Swanker and a few secretaries who assisted the committee. .And all of these peo- ple are bound, as a matter of honer, to reveal nothing of what they learned ex:cept that which the President decides to release. I arp. not ihter-ested in reviving the issues, for it is not my concern w-hether others want all the facts or not. However. In f~rness to all concerned-the Souths, the mem- bers of the study committee, the administration, the new dining hall inariagement-I want to emphasize that there is at present only one • person who has the full story and can release it-President Davidson. Thus, when either the Concordien- sis or interested individuals choose to. comment on the past problems of the college dining services. their opinions rnust;;tand as insufficient- ly doc-umented unless their infor- mation carne directly from the President. Mr. Woodberry's recent letter to the editor prompts .zr.e to make these remarks, for though his facts cor\cC'rning the rapid \vrite-ofl' of equipment ·bought for West College are correct as far as they go, they are only half of the depreciation story, and therefore Mr. Wood- herry•s implied conclusion is quite incorrect. And the Concordiensis should hear in mind, as Mr. Wood- berry f<Ugg-es!R. thrtt th~ colleg{' has not Y\t announced if lhe students' complnints were \legitimate.'' Only the President can release the full story. Unlf'ss and untll one learn& it from him. onP is in danger •of leaping to some very erroneous conclusions. Sincerely yours, Richard A.

Union Hoopsters LQse Heartbreaker To State !(Swimmers Victorious ~over MIT, Rochester The Union college swimming team swept another week~ end twin bill last Friday and Saturday by defeating MIT a:nd Rochester. The victories brought the team's record to f.ive wins and two losses, the wins coming consecutively after early season losses to stroJilg Williams and NYU squads. l!I!HT made its first appearance in Foote Pool since 1940 with a ea.ch meet, broke his own record of 70.4 with the amazing total of 80.7, powerful squad. However, coach Mullane had the Garnet in top shape, as was proven by the record-shattering performance of diver, John· Sh~.rwood. Sherwood, who has been showing great improvement with an<J ()'Neil'_s 24.0 in the 50 yard freestyle is indicative of the fact that he ·is crowding his own record in that event. This, plus the shrewd manipulating· of the lineup on Ray Mullane's part, produced a 51-33 victory for the mermen. Beat ·Rochester At Rochester, the natator.s repeated the exact sco~e of the previous ·evening. The Yellow Jackets were surrrisingly strong in the distance events. Great improvement was showll by Land and Fabricant, both men turning in their best times of the season. It is interesting to note that the Mullanerren have taken the 300 ya.rd medley relay, which is the first event on the program, in each of their ·five consecutive wins and lost this event only in the two meetg they lost this year. . This coming Saturday afternoon, both the varsity and freshmen squads meet R.P.I. in the Troy pool. This will be the last dual meet for otlr ··~ea horses.'' The \cherry and white\ have a vastly improved team, and contrary to rumor will be a tough hurdle to clear. Ray Mullane's undet·manned novices will attempt to. even up their season's recol'd, 'having lost to Albany Academy. Martm Cohen and BLir Havard are expected to pace the freshman squad.

As yet, the publicity committee has not re- leased their decision, but they have promi.sed an integrated theme and prom. Heading the six subordinate prom committees are John Pavkovich, Harold Vink, Edward Robedee, Gerald Frank, Fl-ank Cafarelli, and James Spero. Chosen to represent as many campus interests as pos- sible, they form a steering commit- tee responsible for the success of the entire weekend. Contracts are under consideration for a nationally known band. Har- old Vink, band cha.irman, expects to be able to announce a final de- cision at the committee's next meet- ing. To date, over thirty bands have been screened for the week- end. Tickets for the prom will be available at a much lower cost than in recent years.

A Job Well Done \Cong-ratulations\ is a word that often is an empty thanks. In the case of om· past Editor-in-Chief, Herb Spira, howeve1·, it bears its full meaning and cannot be overworked. During his six month tenure as Editor, Herb WAS the Concordy. Coming back from a year abroad at St. Andrews, he was nevertheless up to date on all the events at Union dur- ing his absence, and proceeded from the outset to fill the 'Cordy office with cries of \crusade\ and \reform\ from the moment he first set foot in it. His achievements, to note but a few, included bringing to light the situation at the West College dining hall and giving the Little Ivy League its fil'st big push. Of lesser fame, but of great importance, were his many reforms within the Concordiensis itself. Only the members of the staff can fully app1•eciate their value, for they brought organization from near-chaos and decision from hesitancy. If, in the years to come, Union has the privilege of num- bering another Herb Spira among its students, it can justly be proud, for his type is extremely rare. From us, sincere appreciation of a job extremely well done, and from the student body, thanks for the example you have set. You will be missed, Herb. -The Staff Carelessness and Tragedy One cannot help thinking of the dramatic waste of life which befalls us each year as a result of automobile acci- de~ts. It is particularly tragic when this catastrophe strikes, as It recently has, a college student, a young man developing his educational foundations and enlarging himself intellect- ually so that he may become a productive member of om· society. How painful it is to see these budding plans wiped out and a possible brilliant future erased. This is the great- est of all wastes and the most painful of all experiences. It is perfectly clear that these accidents are a result of carelessness. It is also ob\'ious that they need not continue. The solution to the problem seems beyond reach, but is yet, however, known to each of us. We have all stated it many times and have yet to heed it. This is perhaps the saddest comment which we can make on human nature. It all re- flects, we believe, the eroneous attitude that \It can't happen to me.\ It can't and yet it does happen to us. The facts are plain, stating that one out of every five American families will have an automobile accident next year. We have previously alluded to the simple, well known solution, which in view of present events, needs to be re- emphasized. This solution might best be expressed in quot- ing a resolution which came out of a recent National Con~ vention of the Phi Sigma Delta Fraternity. \Resolve that with the knowledge of the tremendous toll of autom~bile accidents each of us should, for his part in reducing this menace, endeavor to drive more ca1·efully and with regard to all the rules of the 1·~ad.\ . Statistics can be proven wrong, but It does reqmre that each of us do our share. -G. R. K. We Stand Enlightened In last week's issue we printed an editorial concerning Division I which was in e1·ror in its presentation of the fa.cts. We apologize both to the College fm: our misrepresentation of the actual condition of Division I, and to the student body for our failure to live up to the task of presenting well-in- formed, factual, and representative reporting. If, however, our error further stimulates student in- terest in the courses Division I offers, it may prove of posi- tive value. .. -I. G.

Faculty mem- bers w·elcome thoughtful and well- informed student comment on edu- cational and curricular matters from the Concordiensis editorial column. Let me add that we are always ready to give members of your staff-and any other inter- ested student-the facts and fig- ures about Union's curriculum and to explain our program and dis- cuss our ideas about education.

Tbe term \House of Magic\ was coined by Mr. Gibbons while pass- ing through General Electric's re- search laboratories. It was first used in describing these labs, and only later as the name for G, E. demonstrations at the Chicago World's Fair. There were four original \House of Magic\ units be- fore the war, but the number was reduced to two during it and is now back to four. ' During the show, Mr. Gluesing performed several demonstrations illustrating how to have fun with science. These demonstrations were in the fields of chemistry, electri- city, and light. In his first demonstration, Mr. Gluesing· mixed together two types of \chocolate syrup\ and some \maple syrup\ to produce \straw- berry soda\.

As a result of the actions of special interests, the Stu- dent Council this past week overrode a House Pl'esidents Council ruling to hold rushing during the first two weeks of next semester. This action clearly indicated that these same interests seized upon an advantageous situation to l'everse a decision which had already been decided upon by a group in which they had their proportionate representation. The Student Council action which called for a student referendum must be seen as a direct blow at the House Pres- idents Council, which had previously voted for early rushing· by the one-sided vote of 12-3. (Note the correction in the previously reported vote as it apptars on page one.) There can be little argument that the decision was one which affected primarily the campus fraternities. It might well be argued, as it was in the Student Council, that. this matter directly concerns freshmen, who have no vote in the fraternities, a point well taken. It is equally true that it is a measure which will affect the independents on this campus; but it also directly concerns and most strongly affects the fl'atemities on campus. The facts definitely point to a deci- sion on the matter Ly that group which is representative of these bodies, the House Presidents Council. In view of this, one small group still took the first op- portunity presented. and with the aid of the well-meaning and properly-acting above-mentioned freshmen and inde- pendents, completely disregarded the II.P.C. ruling which had gone against their wishes. The possible faults of the present Student Council-House Presidents Council set-up are clearly evident from these re- cent developments. We cannot let the decisions concerning such important student matters rest in the hands of an un- representative few; and fortunately there are means by which an occurrence like we have just witnessed may be pre- vented. · We should li~e to see the final right of approval upon such measures d1rectly concerning the fraternities reside within the H.P.C. Further, on such measures as this where the independents and freshmen are involved, we feel that the President of the Independent Council and the President of the Freshman Class should have equal votes. They should be on a par with the fraternity presidents. We should like to see this measure incorporated as such, or in spil'it, within the new House Presidents Council constitution which will shortly be up for approval. The Student Tax Committee retains final approval as to the allocation of the student ta:x funds and this idea should be carried over into the H.P.C. Certainty the H.P.C. deserves a little more than an advisory capacity on measures which directly concern the fraternities. It is also particularly disheartening when we witness the appearance and the action of vested interests within the Studen tCouncil, a g1·oup supposedly repl'esentative of the st?d~nts '!f Union College. We object to such local strength w1thm t~Is body. It can and will, as we have seen, lead to such ~chon as we have recently witnessed in the Student Council. We feel that a representative group on the council would not have acted in such a manner, but would also have seen to the proper hearing of the freshman and the inde- pen?ent g~ie~ances. Certainly these groups achieved their desl.l'ed vmce m the rushing question • but we must recognize that they did ~o. without the prope~ repl'esentation of the campus fratermt1es. . I~ connection with this unequal balance on the Student qouncil, we _would ?rge all students in the next council elec- tion to cons1de~ this question: Will this group I am electing be representative of the students of Union College? This question cannot be over-stressed in its importance. The rushin~ pr.obl~m, which has been treated as the second~l'Y ques.tiOn, IS s1tl_l open for decision. We should like to see, m the fmal analysis, a record vote on the part. of the students. What can be more representative? -G. R. K.

It ·was a brilliant continuation of the \History of the Theatre\ series which Donald Jones opened so auspiciously a year ago. Of the two plays this reviewer preferred the &lighter \Second Shepherd's Play,'' so thoroughly human v. ith its comic by-play of Mak the sheep-stealer and his lusty 'VI ife in sharp yet believable con- trast to the profound wonder of the Nativity. From the rroors of England to the Bethlehem of an- cient Judea is a jump the imagin- ation can really take; it may be absurd, but by the logic of the heart it is not. It may be that the three shep- herds-all of them played with forceful humor by Saul Babbin, Richard Woodley, and Michael Pincus-spoke their lines with such vehemence that the sense was not easy for everyone to follow. Per- haps a more deliberate tempo would help. But they were amus- ing, and so were Richard Meyer as Mak and Patricia Miller ag hi'l earthy wife. Incidentally, Meryl Clary made a lovely angel - no wonder she was \Beauty\ in the \Everyman\ which foloiwed. As for \Everyman it is not the familiar allegory first printed about 1529, but a modernized ver- sion with a chanting chorus and musical background developed by Albert Johnson, head of the drama department of Redlands Univer- sity. .Some of it Is undeniably ex- cellent theatre-especially the be- ginning with its sonorous .and ominou.s crying to \Everyman.\ FrGm the Rensselaer Polyteclmic: I Two Enhances: Here again the playing was ad- roit and effective-especially the btirly materialism of .Saul Babbln as \Worldly Goods,\ the vivacity of Webster Caye as \Good Fellow,\ the modest pleading of Patricia MH!er as \Good Deeds,\ the quiet pel'slstence of Richard Meyer as \Death.\ But as for the text, the language, this reviewer much pre- fers the sturdy masculine version of the original. Something in the present script has the California touch; perhaps it needs \Knowl- edge,\ that stout companion in the original text but missing from this one. \N evet· underestin: ate a woman unless she asks you to guess her age.\ From the Missouri Miner: A young pair were in: the throPs of silence as the car rolled smooth- JAMES Restaurant • GOOD FOOD at prices you can afford Booth and Fountain Service 426 State Street Both plays opened with a lec- ture,-with Don Jones intoning l from a zr.onolithic pulpit, accom- panied by slides on a screen.

While granting that Mr. Jones' comment that \student activities should be the practical aspect of classroom work\ contains much merit and is certainly worthy of consideration, I feel that there is another aspect of the activities situation which should also be con- sidered. Activities at Union pro- vide excellent opportunity for stu- dents to gain .experience in fields completely apart from their class- room .work, and I think this is a highly desirable situation. Thus we have pre-meds gaining valuable ex- perience as newspaper editors or radio station managers, engineers learning the intricacies of business management. Unquestionably we would like to see more liberal arts ment in the creative activities such as publications, theatre, and radio but I seriously wonder If academi~ emphasis on participation in such activities for L.A.'s might not dis- courage the science or engineering student who wanted to be in the activity for the fun of it, and for <What the activity itself offered. One of the great advantages of the present system is that the stu- den who is interested can climb to the top in the activity of his choice, regardless of his academic back- ground. As for Mr. Jones' remarks con- cerning acivity financing, he has apparently hot yet learned the facts after five years. at Union, or he refuses to recognize them. Let me point out that the budget which the Tax Committee approves for each activity is originally drawn up .by the activity itself; conse- quenUy any insufficient \investl- gatlon into the needs of the club or cost of essential materials\ is the responsibility of the activity. After the budget is submitted, the Tax Committee meets with the president and business manager of the activity, and discusses each budget item in detail; again, if the activity neglects to present facts bearing on the case, it is hardly the fault of the Tax Committee. Of twenty-three budgets so prepared and so discussed for the present academic year, eighteen were ap- proved exactly as the activities submitted . them. Two of the re- maining five contained items for which student tax fm:ids cannot be used legally, but were otherwise approved as submitted. In addi- tion, any activity which seeks a readjustment in its budget ie wel- come to request it at any regular r.r.eeting of the Tax Committee This hardly seems like undu~ rigidity, All of us in the activities game welcome, I am sure, constructive suggestions from faculty members as to what may be done to improve student activities; especially do we welcome ideas on how to encour· age more participation. And many activities owe a great deal to help• ful faculty advisers. But activities at the present time are strictly stu• ~ent business. When faculty ad~ visers abuse resoponsibllitles en- trusted to them by the Student Council in order to circumvent the spirit of Council decisions, the only· result can be that both faculty and students 'Will lose respect for the individuals involved, and lose faith in the whole activities program. Let us hope our faith will be re- newed In the future by seel1;1g fac- ulty and students working co-oper- atively for the betterment of the student activities program. Sincerely ydurs, Blcha.rd A.

Refused and Rectified Early rushing was the majority opinion as 61.7 percent of the campus expressed their wishes in our recent student referendum. It is particularly interesting when one seeks to find a reason for such overwhelming support of a system that appears to be on the way out. We see this vote as a reaction to the experimental year of deferred rushing \Vhich we had here last year. It is a desperate clinging to past tradition. We must admit that all innovations do not represent improvements, but deferred rushing which has been instituted and has worked out very well has never been given its fair chance at Union. There were, and necessarily so, in its first year, many faults with the new system. Problems arose which could not be foreseen and added many grievances to defened rushing. It was cer- tainly not fair to abandon such a program before the neaes- sary modification could be introduced. Secondly, although we firmly believe that delayed rush- ing should be given a fair chance at Union, we see the stu- dent vote as an indication of support to the H. P. C. ruling. That the H. P. C. most truly represented the student body in this rushing question was well evidenced in this student vote. This representation, we will once more stress, could and should be included to cover the freshmen as we indi- cated our editorial of last week. Certainly those who do not yet believe rushing to be a H. P. C. question would do well to once more examine the referendum in the light of H. P. G. approval. Summarizing by the recent decision we find ourselves in a paradoxical position. We firmly believe that deferred rushing can and should be allowed to work ~dvantageously here at Union. We also feel that the question should and might very well have been decided by the H. P. C. Our sym- pathies with a modified H. P. C. approval of the problem and our antipathy toward their decision could only come to conflict in any decision. > We rejoice at the students' recognition of the H. P. C. ruling. We find fault with their actual decision. · -G. R. K. The Missing Element There were twelve students interviewed recently for the purpose of selecting from that group one student to repre- sent Union College in our St. Andrews exchange for next year. According to Dr. Davidson, each of these twelve men, when interviewed, expressed a keen desire to travel and see Europe as well as Scotland this coming year. However, not one of these men displayed, amazingly enough, a keen inter- est and a passable knowledge of European affairs. The exchange with St. Andrews is aimed at this specific purpose-to furthe1· an understanding between the students of that country and ours. It is a sad commentary on the stu- dents of this college, who are aware of and in accord with this purpose and then are seemingly uninterested, that they will not even attempt to gain a second-hand knowledge of Eumpean news and conditions. It is a sad comentary on the students of this college who are aware of and in accord with this purpose and then are seemingly disinterested, when they will not even attempt to gain a second-hand knowledge of European news and condi- tions. Programs such as the St. Andrews exchange and the Union College Reconstruction Fund, which helps Union Col:.. lege students to attend summer work camps in Europe and in this hemisphere, are certainly worthy of the praise they get. These programs, however, are only as effective as the men who participate in them. Certainly a student who has a previous knowledge of the conditions which he will''meet abroad will be better equipped to gain the maximum advan~ tage that such experiences can offer. We can only point out the appal'imt discrepancy between the students' desire to strive for international understanding and their actual' work towards this end. It is up to them to do something about lt. We feel it is worthwhile enough for the small trouble that it will entail. -G. R. K. My Sword Is Dulled . '::_ ,_ ~ Thy Children's Chorus By Hans Groot \What is the Idol and where did it come from?\ Visitors to our campus probably ask this question mote often than any other. Years .of harsh usage have ob- scured the lines of the ancient stone figure w·hich squats behind Alumni Gymnasium until it is nothing more than a cold blob on the 'landscape. Yet, old photo- graphs and sculptured miniatures reveal that the Idol was once a ·happily -smHing lioness clasping a tiny cub to her bosom. The cub's right hind foot rested on a ball, while its forepaw and that •of the mother were joined on a stump which seemed to hold the pair in equilibrium. Our Idol was dug up on tl:)e south side of Shanghai late in 1860 by ·workmen constructing earth- works for defense of the city against the ''Longhaired Rebels\ in the Tai Ping Rebellion. In the crowd which watched the excava- tion was a Union alumnu.s, Dr. J. M. W. Farnham, '56. As the Idol was hauled from the ground, he stepped to the officer in charge and aslted if he might have the monstrosity. The officer assented, and Dr. ·Farnham had the heavy object hauled away and set up at the gate of hie school. Several years later it occurred to Dr. Farn- ham that such a curious old piece of sculpture would ·be valued at Union. A wealthy Chinese family almost blocked his plans to ship the Idol back to Schenectady. The family laid claim to the huge chunk of stone as it stood beside a Shanghai canal awaiting shipment. Dr. Farn- ham, raced to the scene and settled the claim for $20. Without further miehap, the Idol was hoisted aboard a clipper ship, lowered into the depths of the hold to serve as ballast, and sailed off for America under a cargo of tea. It finally ar.- rived in Schenectady aboard an Erie Canal boat in 1872. The Idol spent its first four years on the Union campus in Dr. Nott's barn behind South College. Then came +w'Ord that the donor, Dr. Farnham, planned to visit the campus. The Idol was hastily hauled from the barn, dusted thor- oughly, and set upon a pedestal in the little dirt lane before the pre- sent site of Alpha Delta Phi. Work- men left the scene at dusk and the college community gathered 'rounli to inspect. Dusk deepened to darkness and a cold -wind blew do-wn the valley and across the campus· hilltop. Pre- sently the Idol was deserted. Pangs of lonelines may have sw·ept over the lioness and her cub as they began the first of many, many solitary evenings-'neath this alien sky. But suddenly, the stone pair were not alone. Down the lane, stealthily, from the direction of the big, domed building, came four students. They carried heavy buckets. Upon reaching the Idol, the quartet set down their pails and opened a package containing several large brushes. They dipped these into the buckets and then sn:eared' the thick 'b•lack contents over the little cub. Then the inky coat was applied to the ;body of the lioness herself. Finally other brushes daubed a ·layer of white on the pedestal and head o'f the lioness and a splotch of crimson was slapped across ·her grinning j'IJOUth. College authorities 'Were horri- fied when the damage was discov- ered the next day. A note was found on ·the bulletin board,, pro- claiming \Prexy's little god has changed color;\ and it !Was discov- ered that .the paint had been stolen from \IJ.'he. Memorial Building\ (our present library where a con- tractor was busy coating ironwork on the unfinished dome. The offenders were never caught, a:nd the Chemistry Department tried in vain to remove the paint with various fluid combinations. Since the donor's visit was impend- ing, Mr~ Mcilwaine decided that it would be owisest to give the poor Idol a complete coat of brilliant white. This was done and history records no .complaint on the part of Dr. Farnham. He did, however, suggest that the huge monument be moved' to a site between the round building and Hanna Hall. Authorities ruled the Idol too gro- tesque for such a site, and had it moved to a new pedestal behind Washburn Hall, near the present steam plant. It was transported to its present location when the gymnasium was opened in the spring of 1914. Experts of the Sherwin William Paint Company peeled 102 layers of multi-colored pigment from the body of the Idol in 1934. A ma- jority were green, testifying to the fact tha.t the .freshman class usual- ly had been more energetic than the sophomores in keeping the beast adorned with its colors. Lay- ers of ow•hite attested the truce periods, traditionally declared after one class or the other had tri- umphed 'in the historic cane rush, tug of Vlar, and to~r.ato fights. A fampus writer visiting the cam- pus years ago dubbed the Idol \Nightmare Prot e c t i n g Her Young.\ Yet, the protection eventu- ally failed, for vandals broke the cub from its mother's grasp in 1893 and carried it away, never to return. A. blob of cement wae su.b- stituted, but keen observers state that the lioness has never smiled since. Probably the Idol has several hunCI,red ye~;~,l'l! of life expectancy on our campus. Several RPI at- tempts at theft have failed, and the dou.ghty old lady has withstood not only the ravages of the ele- ments, but of occasional raging fires ignited after she has been bathed in· gasoline. This latter ac- tivity caused alumni so much con- cern six years ago that they asked for removal of the Idol to the safer lobby of the Carnegie Engineering Building. In this move they were thwarted by the president of the student council. He argued that the Idol would lose all reason for existence and become a true mon- strosity if moved jndoors. He threatened to open a campaign for funds to ship her back to China unles she was left out-of-doors. And she was.

In the segm·ent I refer to, Mr. Hoffman appears to be refer- ring to the present ticket policy of the Mountebanks and how it came into being.

Mr. Hoffman stated, and I quote, \ ..• activiti'es at the present time are strictly student business.

., 4 FRIDAY, MARCH 26; 1954 Letter to the Editor For Your Information L tt ered action of the Mountebanklil . . e . . er executives- seeking to· emphasize (Continue(! from Page 2) two facts: To the Editor of the Concordiensis: ~·>--------------­ FRIDAY, MAR 26-AD-INTERIM~•'-' --~--------­ We of the Mountebanks believe, 1. The prese11,:t injustice to the Sir: On Tuesday, March 9, the Stu- dent Council, in strained debate, upheld a motion to take a referen- dum of the entire student body- on the controversial fraternity rushing proalem. The motion 'Was intro- duced by John McMahon, '56 in a sincere effort to decide the ques- tion once and for all. The roll call vote >V\.ill show that I voted in favor of the referendum, as did a number of other councilmen. You made the council's decision the lead story in your is:me of 1\iarch 12. · You presented the facts. · It is with your editorial of 1\iarch 19 that i take issue,-~that editorial which is distorted and not in keep- ing with the policy of the Con- cordiensis to present two &ides to every story. Allow me. You say, sir, that the councH's move was introduced \as a result of the actions of special interests.\ Why do you feel so? Where did you get your information? These \vested interests\ you did not identify in print, but you. freely identified them to me and to rnany others. How could the \vested in- terests\ defend themselves? You v.rite so that any statement must be in the form of a defcnsc,~-a de- fense which should not be t·equired at a;Jl. Was it because of lack of proof that you failed to identify the \vested interests?\ The ques- tion is important enough to bring everything into the open. But that owould be bad, because the truth might get out. I defend myself herew-ith be- cause I have been accused of being an unintelligent voter simply be- cause I voted the same way that a certain fraternity voted. I shall not name the fraternity because I now consider the matter closed. The rr.embers of that fraternity all coincidentally voted yes, and not because they were of the sam<' fraternity. I vot<'d in favor of the r<'feren- dum. I believed the Student Coun- cil right in submitting the reft>ren- dum to the student body because \The purpose of the SC shall be ... to promote and further the welfare and. interests of the student body.\ (SC constitution). The referendum would do (and did) just that. The House Presidents Council does not represent the freshmen or the in- dependents; and the question con- cerns them just as rruch as it does any other group. Unfortunately, these two gr-oups do not have a voice in the House PrN:;idents Council. I I was clectf'd to thl' SO by the I Clas of '56, and it is their wish j that I &hall represent. and I have reprE.'sented-but I have not repre-, sen ted fraternit~· interf'st \· My votP vo.as influenced by the sarnpl- • ing of class opinion; yet you ac- cuse me and several others who votf'd \aye\ of being \vested inter- ests.\ Only through you did I find that I was a \member\ of a lobby.
