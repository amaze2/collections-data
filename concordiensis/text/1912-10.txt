I The Concordiensis VOL. 36. OCTOBER 8, 1912 No.1 AMHERST AGGIES 0, UNION 0 Opening game closely contested and results in scoreless tie. There has been a decidedly optomistic foot- ball spirit hovering over the campus this year and the game of Saturday was a fine corro- boration of what had been expected. The Union eleven showed form and determination that were highly con1mendable. All through the game there was an earnest, conscientious effort apparent in every man to do his best. In no more convincing way was this demon- strated than in the stone wall defense in the last quarter. With but a yard to go, the Union men summoned all their strength and he1d Amherst for four do\vns. This fine exhibition has set Union football s11irits in high glee over the coming season. SIGNS OF SPLENDID COACHING. Coach Dawson's work stands out pro1n- inently in the performance of the tean1 Saturday. The rigorous training system which he has demanded this year is one of the best things that ever happened on the hill. Now that it is considered bad spirit to even countenance the breaking of training- by members of the tea1n, the men \Vill be able to respond with reserve strength in such a critical moment as that of Saturday. While the Union plays are not very elaborate as yet, the addition of trick plays from time to time, will doubtless show still better the skill of Mr. Dawson in drilling his men. CHANGE IN GAME. The four down rule of this year allow$ great leniency in making distance and there is a slight temptation for captains to waste a down occasionally in experimenting a par- ticular play. Union's best ground gainers seemed to be end runs. The team appears to have a good knack of the forward pass which may develop into a reliable ground gainer. The tackling was somewhat ragged hut with the fine interference of the Aggies team, the best tackler would have been troubled. Possibly the chief merit shown by ... the Union team was its steadiness. There was but one fumble and not one play seemed to get confused. The game itself was happily devoid of star plays, every man playing for the team. Pos- sibly the interference could be built up for the end runs, and the punts sent off quicker. GAME IN DETAIL. The g~mc was started at 3 o'clock, Dewey kickinp: off. Gore, the Aggies quarter, took the ball to the 40 yard line. On the first down, the Ag,~·ics netted three yards by an end run. \Vood blocked a run aro11nd the other end and the Aggies were penalized for not having seven 1nen on the line. On the third down, Gore called for a fake punt, trying to make a quarterback run. This play was used repeatedly. It ho-vvever, failed to ma1ze good. Sampson then punted and Dewey 'vas downed at the 40 yard n1ark. Sarvey was se11t around rig-ht end on the first making three yards. Wood then tried a second end run

THE CONCORDIENSIS but was held. Dewey resorted to the punt, wh.1ch. ·Gore took to the 15 yard line. The q-uarter back: run was tried on the first down b11t Union held the Aggies for no gain. S1nith then took the baU for a 15 yard gain, naving good interference. Brewer was bJocJred on the next down and the Aggies also suffered penalization for off side. The 11ext two downs showed poor results for the A..ggies an.d the punt was resorted to. On the first down, Sampson picked off the end run and held Union to no gain. Woods went aTottnd left end for three yards . The Aggies were penalized again. With a line shift, Woods made a buck and gaim_ed five yards. '['be quarter then ended. Tbe second period was started by a line- b-ack, Huthsteiner carrying the ball for 3 yards. Woods went through tackle for a y-ard. Melican broke up the end run which followed. Dewey made six yards on a quarter- back run. A fake end run failed to disturb the Aggies' tacklers who held Union on the £<Jurth down. Amherst started Brewer around end but Anderson stopped him. A center plunge f<Jllowed with no sttccess. By a heavy line smash the Aggies were able to make a slight ga.in. On the last down the Aggies punted and Union was downed on the 50 yard line. u:nion was unable to make much progress and returned the punt. The Aggies plunged f.or 2 yards through the line. On the second play Union tripped up and the Aggies made ten yards. This was repeated and the ball was carried 8 yards further. Union held the Aggies to a forced punt. Dewey took the punt and was downed on the 15 yard line. Dewey sent the punt into mid field and Gore was downed on the 40 yard l-ine. The half ended with a slight advantage for Amherst. In the third quarter Sampson kicked to Davis who reached the 40 yard line. For four downs Union made little progress and punted. Gore fun1bled and Starbuck was on tle spot to recover the ball. Union was then on the Aggies 8 yard line. Sarvey made a 4 yard gain by a b11.ck. The third down was an incomplete forward pass. Dewey tried to kick a field goal but the line leaked and the play was blocked. The Aggies then took good care to keep the ball in midfield. In the last quarter the Aggies showed strengthening, and by repeated gains brought the ball to Union's danger line. Then with the ba.11 on the one yard line, Union held Amherst for four downs. It was magnificent form and showed the excellent condition of the men. The play kept the Aggies out of the da11ge:r zone from then on and no chance came for either s1de to score. --:0:--· -- GAR1NET ELEVEN TAKES FAST GAME FROM HOBART Union Starts with a Rush and Tallies in First Quarter. Final Score 7-6 A second time the power of the Union footba11 team was demonstrated when, on Satur-day, October 5th, Union defeated Hobart by a score of 7 to 6. The game is a convincing proof that Union is coming back and coming back strong. Hobart met her defeat in practically the first four minutes of play. The Union rushes were so determined that in a short time tbe Garnet team had lined up four yards from Hobart's goal line. \iVith excellent genexalship, Beaver called for a forward pass and caught the secondary defense of Hobart napp-ing. Starbuck was there to take the throw and netted the first touchdo-vvn for Union this year. Dewey kicked the goal in excellent form. The rest of the half was clearly all Union's way. I-Iobart tried to play back strong, but her rn en lacked resistance. Hobart's brace in the second period was a fine display of team work. Hobart seemed to undo Union's defense by means of several trick pia ys and to be able to creep down to the g-oal line, and finally cross it. Union appea1·ed to weaken at the critical point and ... lac~ efl< . yJ!e thi S01 pr: ca: be •,:( ac t: \ ., 0[ st ()'\· ~· B a t• .. .· ,' a .. a .. 1· t 1 1 l ~ - ,.,. . . ,,,, .... ~ i . j· ' i·

THE FRESHMAN CLASS. Evidently Old Union appeared exception- ally attractive this year to preparat()ry men. Th_e entering class enrol1n1.ent wbich is the second largest in the history of the coHege, has soared considerably above the century n1.ark and its g-radual increase makes it 11ncertain w bether the zenith has yet been reached. 'Tis indeed a pleasure to witness the regis- tration of such a large freshman class-a c1ass which now is a fair rival to son1e of the largest that ever came through the time hon- ored Blue Gate. The whole colleg-e bids these new comers a cordial welcome, and wishes them tb.e very best success that Fortune rna y deign to bestow upon them. Right here we would beg permission to offer a word of exhortation and critid sm to some of the members of the c1as s of 1916. Your class is an usually large one, strive to keep it a large one throughout your college course! Experience has taught that the en- rollment of a class rapidly din1.inishes as the different mile stones on the road to gradua- tion are passed. Make an e£fort to have your class prove ap exception to this rule. This demands persistency above all things but we can do no better than refer you to the 1notto set forth is your '' Freshman Bible ''. ''Start right, stay right, endings will take care of thernselvcs.'' A gain your class has proved itself well supplied with vigor and fighting spirit and has just cause to be proud of the outcome of the cane rush. Almost everything in the com- bative line has resulted in a victory for you. Well and good,-·but do not let this success g-ain the better of your reason and cause you to feel too n1.uch elated. A proud heart and an enlarged craniun1 are not valuable assets to a freshman. Your poster may indicate splendid class or rebellious spirit to your niinds but it tends to conflict with true Union spirit. The Fresh1nan Rules, while consid- erably exaggerated by the sophon1ores, are in proper form the lin1itations set upon first year men by the vvhole college. They are not only rules but customs here and co1npliance \vith then1 is the first step a fresh1nan can take to develope in himself real Union spirit. Just try to u11derstand that no one is unduly imposing upon you and that· 'tis son1.eti1nes best to cultivate a submiss1-.re spirit. It is not our purpose to be hypercritical at the very start but 1nerely to cause you to assu1ne the proper attitude in1mediately in order that the rest of the year n1.ay be spent in har.- moneous relationship. ~ AN APOLOGY. Our issue is slightly tardy but this fault is due to the change made in the printing es- tab1ishn1ent, our former printi11g co1npany having retired fron1 business. 'Tis our de- sire to prevent a repetition of this tardiness in subsequent issues. \ ' l ,•. I: I . :··.' ·:· .- .o·•· ,,' ,, ,-, .. ·.·; :. . '.·· i ! '

The misse1es were sent \vith good in ten:tions but poor a.im so Htt1e damage was done. After three ndn- utes, a whistle blew and hosta1ities ceased for a moment, while an account was made for m]uries. As it happened, no one was killed. Then the two classes were lined up, close together this time, and Captain Dewey tossed the baseball bat into the air betvYeen t1l€ffi. Instantly the bat -vvas covered by a squi rn1.- ing, fighting, kicking n1ass of hu1nanity.

'['he annual cane rush between the under class men, was \von by the freshmen. 1'1lis was quite an unusual thing, not having ocenrred before in several years. The'' scrap- -ping- '' that day was too one-sided to be of rouch interest, the freshmen out-numbered the seconcl-ycar men two to one. The entire day was filled \vitb various combats bet\Yeen tl1:e men of the t\YO c1asses and freqnentJy bn.11ds of them crossed the campus looking t()r trouble in the shape of pngnacions indi- viduals ·who \vere afftli::~.ted with the opposing class. And tl1cy found plenty of n1cn and troub1c. The fiercest scrap occurred at the gyn1nasiu1n Fric1ajr 1norning. Son1e do?.:cn sophon1ores had captured several freshn1en -whose 8id they hac1 en11sted in packing t11c salt for tl1e rush.

,,. I 12 THE CONCORDIENSIS \1916 1916 \. It is understood this scheme worked and two weakly ' ' frosh '' answered the deceiving call and of course the reader knows the rest. With defeat on their minds the victims plucked up good courage for the day of the cane rush and early in the morning opera- tions ·were begun to keep the opponents busy tying up salt. But from the beginning their plans were foiled. The big hose connected with the city water pipes and shot into the gymnasiutn through the sky lights, decided that no salt in that building, and possibly in adjoining apartments, could be retained in paper bags. As soon as this defeat was re- alized they turned their attempts to other· climates, hoping it might be cooler for them there. At first it seemed that the plan of captur- ing a few stray '' frosh ' ' on the cam pus and carrying them in bonds to a distant part of the city, there making them tie up a salt; would work. And it might be called a par- tial success in that a little salt put up by the captives was securly hidden before '' frosh '' troop of scouts came around to investigate the whereabouts of their missing mates. They were further harrassed by defeat when the real scraps began, for they had been foiled in their attempt to put fifteen of their opponents into seclusion by tying- thetn up in a cellar on Uuion street. As it was, the captives we~e successfully carried to the cellar and even bound to posts and other stationary parts of the prison but this was as far as the game could be called a success by the \sophs ''. For one of the prisoners managed to escape in time to notify the scout troop of the conditions that existed in Union street.

Garnet again strong at start and scores victory of 7-6 before opponents get warmed up. By the same score that Hobart lost to Union last week, the eleven from Worcester Tech. met their defeat on Saturday. The Garnet team, having mended many of the vveak spots shown up in the last two games, started after Worcester at top speed, and kept everything it's own way during the first two periods. Twice Union ahnost reached the goal during the first period and \vas un- fortunate in miss1ng both attempts at a field goal. Union Scores During the second period Union tore through the \Vorcester line continuously. After Dewey had spoi:ed a fo\vard pass for his opponents, the Garnet boys carried the ball right dov;rn to the goal line and Mallen forced it across. Captain Dewey kicked a neat goal from the c~nter of the field m.1king the score 7-0. Worcester Takes Brace At the the beginning of the second period the \Vorcester team rallied and rushed the ball steadily toward the goal line. After a number of gains the pigski11 rested on the five yard line. The outlook vvas discouraging for Union, yet, for the third time this season the team recovered itself at the critical mo- ment and held it's opponents for four downs. When the ball was only a few inches from the line the whistle ended the half. Union Weakens The third period was one of close playing at the start but Worcester ltad sho,ved an in- crease of speed and after Dew.ey and Star buck had quite the game, worked gradually up to the twenty-fiive yard line. At this moment Worcester fortunately g-ave the ball to Barnes, left halfback, and he cleverly warded off every Garnet man and placed the ball be- hind the goal line after a sensational run of twenty-five yards. Captain Howard tried his best to send the ball over the bar and tie the score but his kick was slightly misdirect- ed and the pigskin bounded back from the goal post leaving the score 7-6 in Union's favor. Fast Playing Both teams took a fresh hold in the last period and played a fast g-ame, but the elev- ens were too evenly mate lled to allow any further score and the -vvhistle finally decided the contest in Union's favor. Sumn1a1·izing then we may say that the eleven on Saturday aga.in showed highly

8 THE CONCORDIEN'SIS comendable from and detertnination. Places where greater strength was needed in the line up were improved upon from the ex- perience gained through close study of the previous games by coach Dawson. The coach has already obtained the confidence of the student body. This confidence was very evident Saturday in the increased spirit which backed the team from the moment they came on the field until they were carried back to the gymnasi u1n as victors. A decidedly encouraging feature of the team this year is found in the fact, as demonstrated in both the Hobart and Worcester Tech. games, that the Union eleven has developed the power to get started quickly and to get the jun1p on their opponents. Both games have been won 1)ractica ll y in the first few minutes of play. The steady determination, which every Union team embodies, then did the rest. The excellent form in which captain Dewey kicked the goal was the feature of the game which stood out clearly. Mallen cleverly found the hole and carried the ball through for a touch down at a most critical moment in the ga1ne. The weak- nesses which were evident in some inci- dents will \vithout doubt be corrected before the Rochester game. The Summary: Union (7) Starbuck ].

T~1e sophn1ores have 110 games scheduled a.~; yet, but expect to play Ballston high school and the Willian1s col1ege sophmores. The freshmen have games scheduled with the Williams freshmen and Amsterdam for same time early in November. The annual sophmore-freshman football match will be played on Election day. Both teams seem to be con:fident of success. As yet, no 1nen have reported for the other con- tests to be held that day. The prize offered 1ast year for extempor- aneous speaking at co1nn1.encement and whicl1 was made up of a first prize of $30, given by J atnes A. Goodrich of Schenectady and a men1 ber of the class of '7 9, and a second prize of $20, given by Dr. Alexander Duane, '78, of New York, has been made permanent.

tba11 The the As con- by a . prtze '78, the THE CONCORDIENSIS 9 CROSS COUNTRY SITUATION As Viewed by Captain La Barron The Cross Country sitution at Union for tbe pr·esen t year has opened in good style and it is hoped that the ·condition of things will gain steadily as the season progresses. There is ample room for improvement and the re- sponsibility for this improvement rests on c\cry stuclent \vno js interested in the athletic \n;Jfare of the co11eg-e. \Vith regard to the season this fall, a word or t\VO n1.ay be spol~en. Barring accidents, the team \vhich 1vn1 represent the college this f:t:l \viJl be the fastest that \Ve have produced since the introduction of the sport, some six ye1.rs ng'). During this tin1e. the team has won eight victories, sustaineJ three defeats, all on the opp')nen' s courses, and in one case, has broken even. In the history of the teatn, it has never b2::;n be:tten on it's O\Vn courses, anc.1 never in it's 1dstory, has Hamilton been able to do better than get one tic score. This happened four years ago this fall, on Hatnil- ton 's course at Clinton. This fa11, last year's team is back to man, and every member is in good condition. The team \vill be an experienced one, and one \vhicl1 knows hovv to act in a pinch. So far, however, in one very great sense, the season has been a disappointment. The arnount of material in the freshman class has been smaller than usual, and the outlook for next year, is not v.ery promising. Of the old n1en1bers of the team, four are 1913 men. This leaves as a nucleus to work on for next year, Eln1ore and I-Iowell and some others \Vbo are yet in the n1.aldng. Inasmuch as the success of any team, is largely dependent on the number of men, vvho are trying out in the under classes, it would seetn that that fu- ture is not a shining light, to say the least. In vie\v of th~ record laid do·wn so far by the team (a record 'vhich has not been ex-· celled by any other tean1 at Union) it is up to get into the running game. The college needs a good cvoss country team, and is hound to have one, if the right sort of spirit is shown by an, but n1ore especially by the underclassmen, in the college. The men who are out this fall and who have been work- ing faithfully, deserve a lot of credit for their efforts for the coBege, because the sport re- quires careful training and does not offer anything spectacular in return. It falls to the lot of every man, to help his college in some way or other. Son1e men do this on the football field some in baseball and son1e in track:; while others do their share in other 1vays. If there are any vvhp desire to sho\v their love for Alma 1V1ater on track, they \vill be g1ad1y \velcomed to the squad, and -vvill be not only servin~· the team, but also pro- moting the college and helping to spread ht r prestige in the world of athletics. The first and only duel run of the season \Vill be in Schenectady, Nov. 2, with Colgate. The full four mile course \vill be used. The men remember their defeat last year on the Colgate course, due to a dispute over the 1ength of course, and are determined to a- -venge themselves this year. ---:0:-- AN ANNOUNCEMENT The CoNCORDIENSIS \vishes to announce the institution of a ne\v feature of general in- terest. It has been decided that the printing- of short articles of interest b~r various rnem- bers of the faculty \vould b~ an asset of value to Union's \veekly. To this end, beginning next week, there \vi11 be a ser les of such ar- ticles running throughout the year, once every three or four \veeks. It is believed that such an institution \VOtt1d make The CoNCORDIENSIS a weekly of n1 uch n1ore in- terest to it's readers at large. Therefore The CoNCORDIENSIS takes pleasure in an- 11ouncing an artide by pre.-ddc~nt Riehn1onc1, to every n1an \vho eRn, to get out and begin 1o appear in next \Yce :Z 's issue. .I .! ..

STRAW VOTE AT UNION In the next issue of CoNCORDIENs:s 'Yi11 appear a stra\v vote of the st11dent body. 'J'J1e editors are going to n1ake a special effort to see every man in coJlcge 1 n order that an exaet vote n1ay be obtainecl. \Ve must ask your hearty co-operation in this task and \vould urge that each student give his honest opinion vvben called upon. There may be a tendency on the part of a fe\v men t0 treat this schen1~ as a joke and so hanc1 in tl1e name of a canc11c1ate \\Tho is not their true choice. This attitude, it is hoped, \vill not be in ATTENDANCE AT GAMES At 1n·acticaHy aU the footban ga1nes held on the ca1npus this season there -vvas a notice- able weakness in tbe cheering. When the c~1eer leader n1ade his de1nands, 11nt1sual1y foreeful a creditable volume of sound was sent 011t from the blea:2hers, but at other mo::n.~nts it was evi lent that stren~1o .1s coac~l­ ing \va.s necessary to put the student body in such cheering form as to do justice to the u~1ion ye11s. It m'J.y be that the cause lS t J be found in the failure of the students to ho:d n sufficient 111.11nber of cheer rehearsals, but more probably the fault is the absence of the students from the vv·est bleachers. These scats are reserved for the student body and c,)lleg-e n1en are not doing their duty if they are \vandering aronnc1 the C8111pus while a gan1e ts 111 progress. The freshn:e~1, espcc- i 11ly, have been guilty of appearing on the wrong· side of the field and so lending no aid to the organized cheering. 'fhcre is son1c exc11se for absence \vhen a student has friends at the gan1e, but except in suc11 a case his proper place is a seat in the student section \V here he can give t.l!e tean1. the right kind of support\- the kinc.1 t 1 1at rnay justly be den1anded of hirn. ~ ~ REVISION OF CCURSES Such a radical change has· been n1ade in the college curricul un1 that \Ye fee) the stud- e:r: ts v·vould be in teres ted in ]{novving more of it' details.

These were: To provide for thorougb drill during the freshman and sophomore years in subjects fundamental in the different departments of knowledge; to effect greater concentration in stuGly by reducing the nurnber of studies pur- sued at any given titne and increasing the · amount of tin1e devoted to each; to prescribe such work for t11e freshman and sophomore years as might 1ead to intelligent election in any one of a nu1nber of lines of study; so to g-oyern election as to ensure son1e continuity of study in eycry student's course; so to gov- ern candidacy for honors as to invite the best efforts of our more ambitious students and to direct those efforts toward an estimable achievement. Thesepurp<Jses, if accomplish- ed, \vill add much to the scholary distinction of Union College and the education con1mittec is· of opinion that the plan outlined offers good and sure guidance t<J,vard the accom- plishnlent of the1n.\ --:0::-- UNION MEN TAKE RHODES SCHOL. ARSHIP EXAMINATIONS The examinations of the candidates for tEe Rhodes Scholarsbip were held in Albany on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of t11is week. The following- Union men took them: Tremper '13, Duane '15, and Loomis '15. The examinations are those Tequired for en- trance to Oxford University, nan1ely: .arith- n1etic, geometry and greek and latin gran1- mar, composition and translation. Owing to the fact that comparatively fe-vv American students take Greek, a man mav be condition- ed in this subject and take it ag-ain at a later date. The examinations are held t\vice in every three years. The scholarships \verc f<n1ndecl by Cecil Rhodes, for the promotion of unity among the English speaking nations. Any man un- der the age of twenty-five may apply. The _final selection is made by a committee con- sisting of a permanent secretary, generally conne~ted with the State Education Depart- ment, and the presidents of a nu1nber of col- leges. The committee of each state and ter- rhory chooses two tnen on the basis of schol- a~-ship, leadership, ability in athletics and de- bating and personal qualities. Men are also taken from each of the provinces of Canada, from Austrialia and South Africa and fron1 G,ennany. The men selected receive an al- Io,vance of thr~e hundred pounds a year dur- ing their course. A student at Oxford may take the B. A. or the more different B. Lit. degree. Especial ad vantages are offered in the study of the classics, philosophy and jurisprudence. There are long vacations at different times clu ring- the year which make it possible for stndents to attend lectures at the Continent- al Universities. Though at first severely criticized the plans of Cecil Rhodes have proved in large meas- ure successful. The Amercian students have gatnecl1nuch by their contact \Yith the Eng- lish and in many cases, contrary to pr~dica­ tian, hayc been nb1c to con1pete \Yith then1 in th<:ir O\\~n field, that of the classics. --:0:-- THE BAND The college band shows a decided hnprove- ment over Jast season and is daily becoming proficient in playing popular pieces foT \Vl1ich parodies vvi11 soon be written.

OCTOBER 23., 1912 No.3· ROCHESTER 0 UNION 0 Garnet Plays Second Scorless Tie of the Season Which is all But a Victory For the first time in ten years, the Union football team practically stole a victory from Rochester on October 19th at Rochester. Though the score was 0 to 0, there was plen.;.. ty of evidence that Union held the advantage throughout the game and should have scored. The fact however that Union has not lost a game thus far in the season is enough praise of the football men and their coach. The two teams were evenly matched. The line and backs seemed about on par and the game settled on tea1n play. Rochester kicked to Union. After three ineffectual atte1npts to advance the ball, Union had.to punt. Rochester assumed the aggressive with possession of the ball, and made first downs three times by sturdy pounding. Union then held and began a fine bit of team play. Five times the Garnet made distance, and began to chill considerably the Rochester rooters' ardor.. However, a fum- ble gave the ball to Rochester, who at once punted. Union tried line. pounding but Rochester budged slowly. Two downs were made befoTe Rochester was able to break up the advance. Dewey then tried a field goal but missed and the halt ended shortly after- \vard. YELLO\V HELD FOR DOV!NS Rochester started off the second half with a vengeance. The team forced itself up to twenty yard line and then were held for two downs. However a forward pass netted them fifteen more. Here with five yards to go, the Union team showed the material-that Union teams are made of. They held Roch- ester for four downs to a ten yard loss in magnificent form. Union punted. Neary the Rochester quarter tried a field ·· goal, but two Union men were through the line and Jenkins touched the ball as it left the kick- er's shoe just enough to spoil its momentum The goal was missed and Rochester failed to score. In the last period, Rochester· again was able to bring the ball into striking distance of the Unicn goal but again Union's stubborn- ness prevented a score. Union then took the ball and started highly aggressive tactics ancl had gone well do\vn the field vv hen the vvhist1e b1e\v . Some Union ' ' grads ' ' -vvere there to see the game. They 'vere ''rather '' pleased, so report has it, with the vvork of the Garnet eleven. While Rochester is too far for a student trip to back up the teatn, many a man who heard of the game vvished he could have seen those inspiring moments near the Union

INDIVIDUAL PLAYING IndividuaHy,. the men worked so weU that all we1~e lost in the Union team. Dewey and Beaver deserve great credit for their ·ground gaining propensities, Sarvey and Huthsteiner earned the laurels 'in defensive work, while Story and Starbuck played end men to per- fection. Davis made havoc of the Rochester line and won mention in the '' dispatches.' ' THE OUTLOOK Just now we face the Rutgers ga1ne on the campus, and it will be a hard game. What is now needed is a big second team, so big that coach Dawson will be able to send in second team subs every other minute. Un1on has started well and is keeping up a fine record this year. Let no disappointed candidates al- low personal prejudice to stand before eol1ege spirit in helping out the varsity. The training table has been g1 ven u. p for two weeks. The varsity men will now live at the fraternity and boarding houses. Union students can show tangible college spirit by doing all in their power to make fhe train- ing as really effective as it should be.

FRESHMAN 56 AMSTERDAM 0 The freshmen football eleven journeyed to Amsterdam Saturday and made the eleven representing Amsterdam high school their first victims of the season. The freshman line was impenetrable dur- ing the entire game, Amsterdam being una- ble to gain ground except around end, and there very little. The most effective ground gainer for the freshmen was VanDeusen, left halfback, who often found a hole for ten or twenty yards at a time. Hanson, at left end showed excel- lent form in tackling, as did also Pierson and Darrow. Two touchdowns ·were scored each quarter, except in the second, when two touchdowns and a field g-oal were made. --:··0:-- A course in Photography, to be known as the Science and Art of Photography, is to be established in the College of Fine Arts, Syr- acuse University, by a prominent alumnus of the University.

The plan is to g·ive this souvenir card to every -person purchasi11g a ticket. This card will contain cuts of. the tean1, of the coach and. perhaps of some members of the team. It will also cover the team's rec- ord and the schedule of games. To meet the expenses of such a score card it 1s neces- sary to print advertisements in it. The club, ho\\vever has received a setback in being compelled to wait for the action of the Sche- nectady Board of Trade before advertise- 1nents may be solicted from the city mer- chants. Since the Board of Trade has laid the matter on the table for consideration, the printing of the cards must necessarily· be de- layed or they m·ust be issued without adver- tisen1.en ts. The Press Club has adopted the 1atter scheme and on the day of the Hamilton- Union g-an1e these souvenir cards will be J.:d ven out at a financial loss to the organiza- tion. --:0:-- WORK ON NEW GYMNASIUM WILL START NEXT SPRING The Union College new gymnasilnn has for son1.e time past seemed, though sure, somewhat in the distance. The dream of the stude11ts who first started the gymnasium f11nd in 1908, and the dream of all tbe stu- dents si11ce that time as \vell as many of the alumni a11d friends has at last taken on a de- finite shape, and will before many months become a reality. The last step vvhich has been talcen \vas in the meeting of the college trustees ]ast Saturday afternoon when a reso- lution \vas passed to the effect that in the opinion of the board work on the new gym- nasinm should be started in the early spring, and that the committee on grounds and buildings take up the matter and secure bids and re])Ort to the board at the ] anuary meeting· with the view of starting vvork at that time. The amount necessary to erect the build- ing 1)1ieviously planned is $100,000 and be- tweell $60,000 and $70,000 of this amount has already been pledged. The beginning of work on the \ gym \ will undoubtedly bring in more money toward the necessary $100,000. The students in 1908, realizing the need of a new gyn1nasiun1 and believing that Union \Vas to have a ne\v gymnasitun in spite of the fact that the 1noncy necessary for the erection of such a building \vas not in sight, led to the beginning of the gyn1nasiurn fund. The students bought bricks, as the manner of pledging certain amounts was ca11ed, and since then other classes have con- tributed as ·well as many alurnni and friends, so that a sufficient amount to assure the erection of the '' gym '' and the beginning of work. on it has already been pledged. The pres~nt tvvo underclasses l1ave not as yet been g-iven an opportunity to add their pledges to the fund; ho\vever, they \vi11 re- ceive this opportunity in the near future. The gymnasium, a cut of vvhich appeared in last week's Concordiensis, vvill be situated on the lane at the east encl of the campus joining north and south lanes, and vvi11 face Lenox rJad. The baseball diamond \Vhich \Vil1 be ready by spring ·will be directly in front of the building, the outfield of the dia- mond is to extend to-vvard Lenox road. The ne·w football field, -vvhich \Vi11 come some time later, vvi11 be to the north of the base- ball uiatnond, and around this ne\V field the oval \\:vill be built. The ground novv occupied for the track \Vill be converted into 1nore and better tennis courts. It is also probable that very soon the fence \vhich no\v runs from the city library to the Payne Memorial Gate vvi11 be extended around the entire east encl. of the campus and thus \vill enclose the track and the baseball and footba11 fields.

Publication Office: THE NEWLAND-VON RITTER Co., 149 Clinton Street, Schenectady, N. Y. THE BULLETIN B()ARD About once a year in the course of college events it becomes necessary to invite the students' attention to the proper use of the bulletin board. In the morning the first in- clination of every student, and it has become a habit \Vith the majority, is to glance at the bulletin board, the duration of this glance depending upon the amount of tin1e which still re1nains before the chapel bell ceases to ring or the door is closed. Another fav- ored time of consulting the board is be- tween classes. So, for the most part, the students desire the ne-vvs and the announce- n1ents in a hurry and do not care to be burd- ened -with an a bun dance of useless reading tnatter which so often finds its way to this morons students. \\Vords [u-c added or at tinu:;s ·erased, c..nd so many cor-rections n1ac.~e t:1at the uninforn1ed passerby t.lilight n1istake the bulletin board for an attelilJ:pt at a joke book. The need of reform 1n this db·ection was macle cTear by one announcement on the board this week which read at the b()tto1n \ Do not mark this notice, save your ,c1eap -vvit for the classroom.'' Perhaps this was good advice and \Ve may hope, while e:xpressing our sympathy to the faculty, that [t will be fol- lowed. It might also be o£ advantage to these humorists if \IVe advised ihetn, as others have been advised before, tD refrain from adorning the bulletin board a.:n_cl submit these bits of wit and hun1or to \ Life \ a magazine which would be glad to \velcorne such expres- sions of talent or perhaps of g-e11ius.

The first of these articles was to have been written by Dr. R.ichrnond and was pron1ised for this issue but owing to President Richmond's busy wee1{ he was unable to submit the much de- sired article on time. We expect, however, to have this atticle in our possession shortly. --:0:-- REGARDING COMMUNICATIONS It is evident that our publication lacks in most of its issues, a feature which is decid- edly prominent in the majority of college papers. This is a co1nmunication column. \V c feel that there is no better tin1e than the present for urging our friends to vvrite us a line now and again voicing their vei\vs up- on any matters of interest to the students or the 1)aper. These con1nunications may be in the forn1 of criticisn1s, suggestions, or in fact in any form most pleasing- to you that will permit printing. Occasionally we overhear remarks on the hill and from our subscribers that would be excellent material for a co1n- munication column, but they are addressed to one or two people and the good \vhich might result from the1n is well nigh lost. So :fina11y may we not hope in the neaT fu- ture to receive an occasional letter fron1 o1n· friends \V ho \vi11 by this act give evidence of their interest in the college, and at the same ti1nc lend their influence for the bettennent of o1.1r publication?

CANON HENSON, AT CHAPEL Canon Henson of Westminster Abbey, vvho delivered a most thorough and interest- ing lecture on Friday evening upon · \ The Labor question in England,'' favored the students with a few remarks at chapel service Monday. His talk was based upon · the idea that a man doesn't merely obtain a certain amount of knowledge at college, but vvhile at the institution is building up char- acter and forming associations to which it wi11 be his greatest delight in after years to look back, especially if the associations formed are of the noble kind. He also ad- vised the students to remember that no man but a righteous one can have any real influ- ence in the world. HAND BALL The regular fall tern1. handball tourna- ment will start November first.

These members held a meeting on Wednes- day the sixteenth but made no definite ar- rangelnents. At a later meeting a tax for the student body was decided upon. The fresh- men \Vill be assessed sixty cents a man and the rest of the students fifteen cents. This tax is to cover the expenses of obtaining cos- tumes and other essentials. NEW BASEBALL FIELD Men have been at work for a ·week no\v, grading, rolling and seeding the new base- ball field vvhich is situated near the Phi Gan1ma Delta fraternity house at the en- trance to South College Lane. This is the first step toward the realization of our new gymnasiun1 and athletic field. By this ar- rangement, the campus between North and South College will not have to be torn up every spring as heretofore. It is thought a1so that this will afford a little earlier spring practice as the ground is high and open ancl vvi11 not have to be laid out each year.

. 0 lS . 111 de- ap- ar- and This base- Phi en- the new ar- and up b ancl THE CONCORDIENSIS 15 PRESS CLUB The Press :Club \vill hereafter aitn to sup- ply a different kind of news in addition to fhe ,Tarious fields it is now covering. Special ar- ticles about the college will be -vvritten and n1ade as features to the different publications. The ai1n of these articles will be to give tne 1nen in the club as n1.uch literary training as they can get outside of the classrooms on S1tb- jccts \Vhich Will interest them. The first of these special articles is no\v in preparation for one of the n1agazines. It's title ·\ivill be: 4( The Statesn1en of Uni<Jn College '' and will aim to give as many inci- dents from tbe lives of Union's noted states- n1en as can be found in the various sources. Some fifteen men w1l1 be covered in this first article, and \vhile the an1bition of the men at work on the article is rather pretentious, it is hoped that tbey will turn out a readable arti- cle \vhich will be of more universal appeal to the national magazines than is the 1nere c<3l- lege ne~rs at present. As data bearing on the lives of these nten is none too abundant, the club \vould greatly appreciate hearing from any of the alumni as to rare volumes of autobiography, anecdotes} or history ·which they think \vould not be ac- cessable to the club. The material for the first article is due on N ovcn1 ber first and anyonf' able to send such inforn1ation 1vi1l greatly help in its preparation by sending such matter as early as possible. The work is being undeTtaken by the general ne·ws committee. The Press Club at present has but eight freshmen trying out as reporters. This is the lowest number to anS\Ner as candidates since the club has been founded. Those \vho are in teres ted in the preparation of news or general literary work, should appear next Wednesday night at the Press Club room at 7:30 P. M. To those vvho are unacquainted with the aims of the Press Club it might be said that the club sends out news of all the colleg-e activities, events, and plans. In the past, it has done 1nuch in the interests of the col- lege and to be a rn.en1ber of this organization will bring profit both from original writing ··and from hearing practical writers speak on the subject of journalism. Anyone from the other three classes \vis bing to con1e out for the ciub 1vil1 be gladly \ve1comec1. A very important meeting of the Club will be he1d this Wednesday night to consider general pilans, and to announce a schedule of speakers. ·O· -- .. -- NEW EQUIPMENT FOR E:NGINEER- ING BUlLDING The trustees decided, at their meeting on Saturday, to render the ne\v engineering building n1ore efficient by appropriating $5,000 for further equipment.

16 THE CONCORDIENSIS A REALISTIC D~RAMA As a suggestion to any of our readers who may be in Ne\v York after November 11 and.,, \v ho vvould care to vvi tnes s one of the best melo dran1as playing, \Ve would invite atten- tion to \The Whip,\ vvhich will be present- ed at the Manhattan ,Opera House. The at- tention of the Concordiensis has been called to this play, for which the entire stage of the Manhattan Opera I-Iouse is to be torn out and rebuilt to meet its requiren1ents. That these requirements will be of an unusual and exacting character is apparent from the fact that 13 complete stage settings are employed for as n1any scenes, a dozen huge tread mills and five electric driven panoran1as are neces- sary for the race scene, while real tracks, lo- comotives and rolling stock are essential for the sensational collision. The latter promises to be the most remarkable stage picture ever presented in America and is described as the climax of sensational rea1ism. Tvvo trains are sho\vn running at full speed in plain sight of the audience. The rear car is detached from the first train and comes to a standstill at the entrance to a tunnel, directly in the path of the follovving express. The latter crashes in- to the car and is shattered into a mighty \:vreck, lit up by lurid fian1es and shrouded in a pall of steam fro1n tbe bursted boiler of the overturned locomotive. The purpose of the \¥reeker-to \:Vork injury to the crack race horse, ''The Whip'' and pre- vent her fron1 entering the 2, 000 guinea stakes at Newmarket-is defeated through the ap- pearance of a rescue party vvho remove ''The vVhip\ fron1 the stalled car just before the crash. This stirring incident is merely one of many that 1nake '' The Whip '' stand out as melo dran1a's most monumental effort. The massiveness of tbe production and cast, numerically, is such that it is out of the q11estion to atten1pt to transport '' The Whip '' about the country.

OCTOBER 30, 1912 No.4 UNlON 3 RUTGERS 0 Although greatly outweighed the Varsity repeatedly breaks through Rutgers line and clinches victory by spectacu- lar field goal. Despite tbe continued rains of the past fevv days, the gridiron was in fair shape for the game with Rutgers on Saturday, October the t\venty-sixth. The muddy spots, however, caused occasional slips for me1nters o: both tctnns at exciting moments of the contest. La.st vear Union lost on the Rutgers' campus in a veritable slough of mud by a score of 6 to 0. The present victory of 3 to 0 helps to compensate for that defeat and the one pre- ceeding it of 12 to 5. These were the only t\VO games played with Rutgers since Union defeated that co11ege in 1905. GAME IN DETAIL The whistle blew shortly after three o'clock, and Dewey kicked to the visitors. Union in1111ediate ly had to begin vvorking hard on the defensive, for the Rutgers eleven started ahead with the san1e kind of vigor that en- abled then1 to score against the Princeton tean1. They ran around the end, dashed through son1e holes they found in the line, plunged with all their weight against the Garnet; each effort -vvas worth a substantial gain. The spectators began to realize the strength of the scarlet-clad warriors. Union, however, soon got its bearings and held to- gether more steadily. A penalty for an off-side play lost some of their hard earned ground for the visitors. But a surprise was in store which brought the men on the blea- chers to their feet with a gasp. Also, the Garnet players themselves were not a little surprised when what seemed to be a foward pass turned out to be a brilliant run around end, The Rutgers captain held the .pigskin back in his hand as if to hurl it foward, when another player snatched it from him and dashed madly around end and dovvn thE- field till two men dovvned hitn. But Union's turn -vvas to come soon. Rutgers tried a for,.. ward pass, but failed to complete it. The ball was imn1ediately in Union's possession} and the Garnet -vvent dovvn the field to tht- 25 yard line. There the line held while Dewey kicked a field goal. The ba11 went dangerously close to the left end of the bar; the rooters vvere singing Ahna 1\1ater, and the music obviously vvabblccl while it vvas being decided vvhethcr the try had been suc- cessfull or not; but vvhen it was decicled that the score stood 3 to 0 in our favor, the song· ended in a triun1phant cheer for the tearn. Shortly after, the quarter ended. There \vas no 1nore scorinp· throug·hout the o·an1c (...._, <C. h •

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS UNION STRONG AT GOAL The playing in the second quarter was snappy, but nothing of great importance hap- pened till Rutgers cleverly brought the ball within striking distance of the :Garnet goal line. But Union is famous this year for hold- ing opponents on the proper side of the line at the critical moment, and Saturday'_s game was no exception. So the Garnet got the ball and made a rather poor punt. But Beaver soon cleverly restored the ball to Uni_9n, and Dewey again punted. Beaver was right after the man with ba11 and downed him. The half ended. THIRD PERIOD ·• In the third quarter when the play was 1n the center of the field, it was impossible to tell to which team the ball belonged, it changed hands so quickly. Rutgers dropped it; Dewey, instead of falling on it, snatched it, tried to run, but lost the ball to an opponent. During the period Rutgers worked hard. After being penalized, they tried the trick of the first quarter, and it worked. Soon came an exciting moment when a scarlet runner passed the line and the ball was snapped to him. But the pass was incomplete. . TEAMS PLAY IN HARD LUCK In the last quarter Rutgers had a little hard luck. A forward pass went out of bounds, and a beautiful punt went off side. But they worked their trick successfully for third time. Union was penalized three times. Two penalties in quick succession brought the ball back near the Garnet goal, but a punt kept it out of the danger zone till the whistle blew. '' CLEAN VICTORY '' SAYS DR. RICHMOND Every Union man deserves mention. Dewey played his usual game. Beaver's name was continully on the lips of the rooters. SarvPy, now recovered from his injury, filled the injured Mallen's place to perfection. Huthsteiner surpassed himself. Jenkins played and talked much. President Richmond expressed himself as highly pleased over the result of the game. He characterized the outcome as a ''perfectly clean victory'' over an excellent team. Union indeed has a reason to be thankful that Daw- son is coach here now. More than half the season is over, and the Garnet has not been defeated once. Furthermore, every victory has been a ''perfectly clean'' one. But our splendid record should not deter the fellows from coming out and helping to win the hard game on the Wesleyan campus next Saturday. The line up and summary is as follows: Rutgers 0 H.

To the editor: There was at tJme college meeting of Oct. 21, some complaint-Concerning the lack. of col- lege spirit shown by the co1lege band and football team. r t seems to me that that defi- ciency does not pertain solely to the band and football team but to the student body as well. This lack of sp~rit 1nay be due to several reasons, and, in my estimation, it i9 up to the student body and its governing board to find out the trottbJe and remedy it. We can- not impress the conditions by talking about them. We must act. The fraternities have a great deal to do ·with the present conditions, for they teach their men to work for the interests of thefra- ternity rather th.a.n for the interests of their class and the eo1lege. The trouble here is that the various fraternities are jeaious of each other and S(), any spontaneous move- n1ent, upon the 1)art of one fraternity or the neutral body, is immediately condemned by those, \vho did n.ot happen to originate it. The neutral body a!lso on the other hand, is afraid of anything that is started by the fra- ternities, and, as a resu1t, vle are in. a con- tinued state of subtle warfare. This results in students becoming disgusted and losing their interests in. college affairs. A few years ago, it was the custom here to hold a campus meeting every Friday night, on the the eve of a football game. There were also the song \services~' on the Terrace. These customs promoted a spirit of fellowship and solidarity among the students. The customs of students speaki1ilg \vhen they meet is slowly becoming a tradition. It is getting so, fh.at not only freshmen, but also the upperclassmen fail to speak, of if per- chance they do, they speak as if it hurt them. In former years at the football games, it was the custom to parade fhe football field between the halves and after forming a block ''' U '' to sing and cheer for tb.e members of thie team ending up by singing ' ' Alma Mater ' ' . Now we do not leave the bleachers, because we are too, lazy, and as for singing, that s.eems to be a forgotten art. Of course we sing \Alma Mater\ (one verse of it) at the games. I suppose by doing that we manage to keep some of our self respect. After a victory, students -in most colleges celebrate by parading down town and letting the people know there is a college in town and that it has a victorious team. Here we ca1mly light a cigarette and go to supper as if victories were an every day occurrence. For instance, for the last two years Hobart ·College defeated ·us in football, this year we sent them home with a defeat. After scor- ing like that, why did we not celebrate in- stead of accepting it as a matter of course? 'The cause, of this conditon, is, that the men who form the ruling power here, such as cheer leaders and members of the Terrace Council seem to lack interest. It certainly is their duty to take the initiative, for if an ordi- 11ary student trys to initiate a movement of that sort he gets laughed at. In most colleges it is the custom at a game for the students to sit together, class by class, with the exception, of course, of the '' fus- sers.'' This promotes class spirit and class rivalry as to which class can cheer and sing the loudest. Why not do that here? An- other thing, Union is one of the few colleges where freshmen are allo\ved to \fuss \ at college games, and there was a time \vhen it was forbidden bere. The place of a fresh- 111en at a college gan1e is on the bleachers with his classmates, for if the fresh1nen '' fus- ses \ at the games in his :fiTst year, \Vhich is the formation period he never gets into the spirit of the colleg-e. It seems to me that it is the duty of every loyal Union n1.an to help Jevive the campus 1neetings and the Terrace singing, a1so to sit ·with his class at the games and after a vlc- ( Continued on page 11)

NO TREAT SYSTEM It is becoming more and more evident every day that the student body has forgotten that it ever decided to adopt a No Treat Sys- that certain men W<Jtt1d not live up to this agreement, althongb they n1ade no objection to the scheme when hwas proposed. Antag;- onism was later apJ~arent though in a latent manner. If the student body now feels tha.t the No Treat Agreen-:1ent is not a success it should abolish the system at once, and not remain in the 1)11esent chaotic condition in which some men Uve up to their pledge and others disregard iL It seems better to take a stand one way or the other. STUDENrS. SHOULD VOTE It is now the excep-tion to take uv any col-· ten1. But although memory does fail us at lege proper and read very far into it without this moment and gives fair promise of grow- ing dimn1er as time speeds on, the fact still faces us that last year at a college meeting in the spring, the student body declared itself unanimously in favor of accepting the No Treat Agreement. For the benefit of the freshmen vve may repeat that, by such action, the students pledged not to pay for the drinks, hard or soft, of a fellow student and not pay another's carfare. The system was also to hold in other less important points, generally left to disgression of the student, with the ex- pectation that he \vould not go to extretnes. discovering an artic1e or editorial in whiclt complaint is voiced ~g-:-a.inst the t.J ew York State law that prevents a student from voting in his college town.

DR. RICHMOND'S ARTICLE \V'e would commend to every reader of the Coacordiensis, especially undergraduate, Dr. Ricnrnond' s article in this issue on ''A N e- g1ected College Activity.'' It is a kindly yet forcibie arraigntnent of the deplorable lack of literary interest in Union College. For a college whose literary traditions are as rich as those of Union it is a state of affairs that is be 11nfortunate but, it is to hoped remediable. 'l'o this end Dr. Richmond is offering a prize to the value of $35. @0 for the best series of articles to be published in the Concordiensis during the year. Conditions of this contest and a tentative program of campaign by the Co11cordiensis for some heightening of literary W\()rk and literary standards will appear in ne::xt week's paper -Theodore Roosevelt led Wilson by 31 votes 011. a straw ballot election held by the students o£ So1:1th\vestern College, located at 'Vinfield, Ransas.

The committee in charge vvill, for tl1.e most part, follovv out the usual plan, but they have arranged many n€W fea- tures. 'J'1le members of the faculity 1vill be portrayed as usual, also the leading politicians and other men in the pub1ic eye. The stage celebrities of the day will be represented as well as the leading characters in the Sunday comic see·tions of the ne,vspapers. Di smem- bered members of tbe Hamilton football tean1 will be on hand to give Hamilton an idea of how they wi11 appear after the gam~. The '' Peerade '' will have its usual nurn.ber of extras and vvithout a doubt, will be one of the · best ever given . Wi11iams Co11ege has adopted the No Deal System for the coming year.

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS FACU·LTY FAVORS WILSON Professors state opinions on ,the pol:itica'l situation and their intentions in regard to voHng. Dr. Richmond: \I belivein Governor Wil- son and in the principles he represents. A friendship of many years has inspired me with confidence in his honesty, his courage, and his extraordinary capability. I expect to see him elected and I believe he will :have strength enough to dominate his party and to carry out his pledges.'' Dean Ripton: \I have a good deal of re- spect for President Taft, particularly for his attitude toward international arbitration; but I shall not vote for him, because in the present election he stands only for leaving things as they are, including the tariff. I shall not vote for Mr. Roosevelt, because I am opposed to personal government. I in- tend to vote for Woodrow Wilson, because he understands and believes in our A1neri- can representative government, and because, as governor of New Jersey, he has shown that he can do what Mr, Gladstone called the statesman' s task: to make the institutions of his ccun1.ry work.\ Dr. Hoffman said that he believes in the principles of the Progressive Party and ex- pects to vote for its candidates. Dr. Landreth stated that he expects to vote for Wilson. Dr. Stoller: ' ' I believe in a revision of the tariff and distrust the Republican Party to make a revision in the interests of the peo- ple. I also admire Wilson for his attain- ment~ and ability as a scholar and a student of governmental policies.'' Dr. Hale when interviewed stated that his vie-vvs were those expressed in the Progres- sive platform. Dr. Steinmetz was out of town when vote was taken so had no opportunity to express an op1n1on. Dr. Bennett: ''Being a Republican and not in :sympathy either with the secessiD:m from that party or with the so-called 'pro- gressive prancip1es' of the secessionists, ill vvill vote for Taft. ' ' Prof. Opdyke: '' I believe that the :Pro- gressive Far:ty' s platform and leaders stand for the g()vernment of the people, by the p2ople, :6or tbe p2ople, through more work- able and eHective measures than those either expressed or advocated by the platforms or the leaders of the other parties. I will -vote for all the Progressive Party's candidates..'' Dr. EUexy: '' Shall vote for Wilson be- cause I wa11t to see a decided downward re- vision of the tariff. The Republican Party has had numerous opportunities to carry ou:t such a tariff revision but has not accepted tbem. Believe now it is better to give the D€mocratic Party an opportunity to show what it is willing to do. \ Dr. Barnes: ''I will vote for either Roose- velt, Taft or Wilson. I do not care to say which.'' Prof. McKean: \By the process of elim- ination I sHall vote for Wilson and Straus.'' Dr. M:a.rch: ''Am not strongly in favor of any of tbe candidates. Expect the election of Wilson._ but shall vote for Taft, as the 11e· presentaHve of the Republican Party. Do not believe a third party desirable or use· ful.'' Dr. McComber: \I shall vote for Roose- velt. A vote for either Democrat or Repub- lican in this state will help keep Barnes and Murphy in power. I consider them the worst in :f!luences in our political life. '' Prof. ;Garis: '' I will vote for Wilson. 'That's aU' I care to say.\ Prof. R€nnedy: ''The present political situation- state and national- is one of the most interesting, as well as the most impor- tant, in t11€ history of our nation. In the state Mr .. Straus represents those things that appeal to me in that he is not dominated by boss l'Ule, and 1 beleive will be free to car- ry out the will of the people.

Prof. Upson: \I should v0te for Wilson if I were quaJifred by residence in the state, to do so. Nevertheless I have always been a republican., and feel that Taft is worthy o£ support, and that there is no need of a third party.'' Prof. 'Garrison: '' I shall vote for Wilson because he bas given evidence that he will be able, if elected to carry out constructive legislation, and because the principles of the Democratic party in the present campaign appear to me to offer a more profitable sol- ution of the present political problems.'' Prof. Lyon: \Wilson and Straus will re- . t '' cetve my vo e. Prof. Stewart: \I am a Progressive. Do not approve of the Republican idea of tariff and fear the Democrats have gone too far.\ Mr. Cunningham: \I favor a downward revision of the tarrif£ and shall vote for W il- son. '' Mr. King: \ Shall vote for -Wilson and Straus.'' Mr. Sa1athe: \I shall vote for Wilson al- though I do not like his Free Trade propen- sities.'' Mr. Callan: \Shall vote for Mr. Wilson be- cause of bis attitude toward the tariff.'' Mr. Hastings: '' I am in favor of Wilson and Sulzer. '' Mr. Anthony's politics have always been Democratic. l-Ie will vote for Wilson be- cause of his attitude toward tariff legislation and for Straus instead of Sulzer because of Straus' ability as a man. Mr. Ctinton: \Through my mental spec- tacles I see the Elephant of Prosperity al- ways; tbe Ass of Obstruction usually; the Bull of Destruction not yet. Prof. :Creighton: ''I like Wilson as a man and Roosevelt as a politician: haven't decid- ed which one shall receive my vote. ' ' Mr. Dawson: ''I am a Wilson-Progressive Republican. Shall vote for Wilson be~ause of personal friendship but am a progressive though I do not approve of Roosevelt. Mr. Maxon: '' Expect to vote a Rep11. blican ticket for the most part but shall make an exception in the case of Mr. Wilson.\ · Note: We must apologize for the omission of the names of one or two professors from the Hst. This was due to the absence of the professor when the representative of the Concordiensis called, or because the professor did not wish to express an opinion. --:0:-- DR. THORNDIKE TO LECTURE Edward Lee Thorndike Ph. D., Professor of Educational Psychology at Teacher's Col- lege, Columbia University, and President of the American Psychological Association will deliver a number of lectures during the latter part of February and about the middle of March in the college chapel. The sub- jects and dates of the these lectures will be announced later. --:0:-- COSMO PO LIT AN CLUB At the meeting of the Cosmopolitan Club held in the North Colonnade on Friday eve- ning the 25th, instant, Mr. Gokhale read an interesting paper on vv hat he chose to call '' The History of the Rise and Fall of Ration- alism in India.'' Thanks to the explanatory remarks in his introduction, the technical terms and the re- ferences to strange sounding religion works were no hinderances, in following the history of the national element in Indian religion from very early times down to the time of Buddba. At the close of the paper, Dr. Ke11ogg ex- plained some of the results that had been ar- rived at by comparative study of religions and pointed out the place of rationalism in their evoluton.

14 TI-lE CONCORDIENSlS A NEGLECTED UNDERGRAD,UATE ACTIVITY The last generation has seeu an astonishing development in our coBeges of so-called un- dergra:duate activities. It could hardly be called a form of demoniacal posse~sion altho the spirits might well answer in the words of the demoniac of the tombs. ' 'Our name is legion, for we are many.'' in our own com- paratively smaU college community of say 350 we have an approach at least to the 57 varieties beginning with football and ending with the youngest and n1ost vociferous of our children, the band-which may be said to be, ex-officio, a necessary adjunct and encourager of every college function. Most of these activities are good and whole- some-none are really bad, the only point of danger is in their absorbing interest. The Catnel' s nose once in the tent, his body was bound to follow his nose and scant room is left for the original owner of the tent, now the tolerated tenant-namely the curriculum. But this is not our point-the curriculun1 is still maintaining its right to exist and waxes stronger in these later years. We are here to praise college activities, not to blatne them. Whatever faults may be 1aid at their door they have rendered a notacle service in developing manhood and raising the tone in college life. The activities of earlier days were not very highly organized and were mostly nocturnal, such as raiding Captain Jack's strawberry patch: or stealing Dr. Per- kin's pears, or throwing stoves out of third story vv-indows, or trying· to burn down the sections after a visit to Weinke' s. When the gray haired dominies and law- yers and solemn judges gather at their class reunions these are recalled as the notable ac- hievements of their exuberant youth. When the undergraduate of today £()regathers with diminished numbers for his 50th reunion he will have things to talk about, less picturesque perhaps, but certainly more worth while. The glory of Weinke' sis departed and college n1en have developed to the point where they can find legitimate and adequate outlet for their superfluous energy in athletic sports, the exer- cise of which brings health to the body ancl discipline of spirit. On the other hand, in undergraduate activities of an intellectual kind we shall have to yield to the ancients. Doubtless more work is done on the average in the regular college course than ever before, but in all that class of work which might be styled literary we are disgracefully lacking. ·Our one undergraduate publication does not pretend to be any other than a college ne-vvs- paper. Occasional eruptions occur, cast in the out\vava form of verse, rarely an effort of even creditable quality in any form known to literature. A friend sent me the other day an orig-inal letter of John Hov,rard Payne written when he was a student at Union Col- lege in 1808. It ·was a request for a literary contribution to the ''Pastime,'' a e:o1lege paper devoted to literature, which he carried on for some time. It seemed strange to me that with all our advances in this century and over of our life, we should have failed even to keep alive the fine literary taste and interest of those old days. We have literary traditions of a high order. The names of John Howard Payne, Sears, William H. Sevvard, John Bigelow and Fitzhugh Ludlow are among the jewels of your Alma Mater. Is it not time tore Jive interest and devel- ope enthusiasim in this neg]ected field? There axe some so-ca11ec1 practical men who decry such interest as ornamental but the thoughtful man in every department of human activity knows that the ability to speak and write one's own language with force and g-race and clearness is one of the essential elements of success. I propose, therefore, as a possible stimulus to this neglected undergraduate activity to offer a prize of the value of $35 to the writer of the best series of literary articles contri- buted to the Concordiensis during the year. The conditions of this prize to be deter- mined by the Publication Board. : j j

He called the attention of both faculty and student body· to the lesson, which could be drawn from this display and said in part, that it was just such spirit, which all must show in every de- partment o£ college life, if we are to hope for the greatest results. Dr. Richmond added that this year more than any other, had this same spirit begun to penetrate deeply into a11 our departments and that great things were in store for Union as a result. It is expected that delegates from Union will attend the convention of the Student Volunteer League of Central New York which is to be held at Cornell ,, University, Ithaca, N. Y., on December 6, 7 and 8. This League is a part of the Student Volunteer Captain LaBarron announced that the try- out for the cross-country team to run against Colgate on Saturday would occur on Monday afternoon, and requested all cross-country men to appear for it. The run is to be four 1niles long and the team is to consist of five men. Further announcements \vill be made in the local papers and on the bulletin board regarding all the things which the students -vvish to know concerning the run. A motion that the facualty should be allowed to attend all athletic games free was presented before the student body and defeated. Shepard announced that a meeting would be held on Wednesday at one o'clock in Silli- man Hall for the purpose of organizing all those who were in any way working their way through college, He also announced that bi- ble study would commence next week. The study being taken up as last year in different fraternity houses and in a neutral class. rrhe leaders of the different groups are to meet in a normal class. A call \vas made for volun- teer students to teach classes of city Y. M. C. A. boys in bible-study at the city Y. l\II. C. A., on one evening a \veek. Movement. The unusally small attendance at Vesper Services last Sunday was probably due to the fine fall weather. Mr. 'Orrin G. Cocks '98, Secretary of the Laity League of New York City, made· an excellent address. The fall term subsc·riptions to the Y. M. C.A. are due on Friday. November 1st .. The subscription list has not been as large as us- ual this year and those who have not already subscribed are requested to co11-sider the tpat- ter and give something if possible. The Bible classes for the year start this week, and there will be a meeting on Tues- day evening, at 7:15, of all those who have not an opportunity to join one of the groups. The Normal class will meet as usual this year \· at 5:00 on Tuesdays. , At \resper Service next Sunday, D. J. V. Moldenhower, Pastor of the Second Pres by- terian Church of Albany, vd11 aclclres£ the students. There VJill be a meeting at 12:00 on vVed- nesday, October 30, of all those who are in- terested in self-help. The Y. M. C. A. finds it rather difficult to carry on this vv-ork satis- factorily and it is hoped that by org-anization and the interchange of information, more stu- dents n1ay be assistecl in obtaining positions. --:0:--- ............

Beginning this week, the freshman and sophomore football teams will line up against the varsity daily. The change from individ- ual practice should result in decided benefit for the varsity, and the coaching the two underclass teams win get under coach Daw- son will be much better than they would receive otherwise. The freshman team will play the Pa-wling- school a \veek from Saturday. While facing- a strong prep school, the freshmen ought to be able to bring the honors home with them. No games have been announced on the sophomore schedule as yet but Manager McLoughlin expects to give the sophs several battles before the team faces the frcshn1en. --:0:-- DEBATING SOCIETIES The Philomatheans and Adelphic debating societies have been busy every week with de- bates in the irrespective societies preparatory to the Allison Foote debate. Material for the varsity seems abundant this year and 1nuch interest is being shown by the students in debating. The Adelphis met Monday to debate ''For and against the 1912 act of Congress regulat- ing the Panama Canal to11s. The affirmative was upheld by Passage '14; Tremper '13 and Dick '15. The neg-ative by Somers '13; Fin- ley '13 and Arany '16. The Philomathean met on Tuesday and debated the same question.

This Store is the Home of GOOD CLOTHES There isn't a fellow on the hill that vve need to tell that Hart, Schaffner & Marx tnake the kind of clothes that college fello-ws like to wear. A store that sells Hart, Schaffner & Marx Suits and Overcoats sells everything else that college fellows like best to wear. We are a little below the bridge, it's a little farther to w-alk, but it pays a college fellow- to find us when he needs to buy anything to wear. • 240-244 STATEtST.
