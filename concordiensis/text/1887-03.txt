As no one was observing me I attempted and, as was not always the case, succeeded in making a \hub mount,\ and turned swiftly down the South road. There were several reasons why I took that direction on this particular afternoon, I shall not attempt to give them in the order of their importance. .. The South road for about a mile out of the village was smooth and level, a perfect paradise for bicyclists, and I very often took my usual afternoon ride in that direction. The road for a con- siderable distance was bordered by rows of maple and elm trees whose changing foliage during those early October days was a con- stant source of rare enjoyment. But my thoughts as I sped along that afternoon over the rustling leaves were not of the level road free from all obstructions to bicycle travel, nor of the delicately tinted and ever changing foliage above me, but of a being that according to Irving has caused man more perplexity than \ghosts goblins and the whole race of ·w-itches put together'' namely:-a woman. For th:1t morning there had passed my office, in a village cart, a young woman, or perhaps I should say, a girl o£ singular beauty. An elderly gentle- man whose venerable appearance was patriar- chal, and who I had since learned was her £ather, accompanied her.
