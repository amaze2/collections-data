Representatives of All Depart- ments Meet About the Festive Board. rapped for order, and welcomed the alumni and members of the faculty in the name of the under- graduates. He stated as the object of the gather- ing, the fostering of a true university feUowship and the renewal of allegiance to Old Union. '' Through such a means, con1mon victories are · won for the university. The same spirit thrills the Freshtnan and quickens the pulse of the old alutnnus. The realization of over one hundred years ofyictory is our ground of union. A steady wave of influence has flowed ever onward from the revered institution. The alliance of nobility., power and love should be the aim of every Jollity anu fellow feeling pervaded the ban- quet hall of Hotel Vendome Friday evening, and served to make the occasion one of absorb- ing interest to everyone having at heart true Union University sphit. The desire for a firn1er alliance of the pt·ofessional schools and the scientific and acaden1ic departments of the university in a social as well as in educational and athletic lines, was the inspiration of the banquet. Every branch was represented. Pro- fessor and student, alumnus and undergraduate, the student of anatotny, the chemist, the young disciple of Blackstone, and the youthful explorer in the reahns of psychological and scientific thought, were present, t·ubbed elbows, partook of the same board, and listened to the flow of practical thought interspet·sed with keen spark- ling hutnor. Joviality and conviviality filled every man's breast and tnade him proud of his connection with Union. Songs and rousing cheers filled the hall and enlivened the gather- ing. The freslunan string quartet, composed of Carleton G. Garretson, Ft·ederick J. Balz, Donald 0. Boudetnan and Harry N. Bowler, played selections of n1uch merit throughout the evening, while sections of the Glee club served to start the airs of the many melodies so dear to the hearts of Union rnen. The hall was hand- sonlely decorated with banners and pennants won by Union on track and field, on the dia~ond and on the football gridiron. After an excellent rnenu had been enjoyed, Clinton Jones, toastmaster of the senior class, undergraduate.\ President Raymond, speaking on the then1e \Alma Mater\ emphasized the need of fellow- ship throughout the university. He said that the departments were drawing togetl1er in the li.llutnni associations and instanced the alumni society in vVashington, D. C., where distin- guished graduates of the college like Charles Etnory Smith, were establishing fraternal rela- tions with such men as Justice Brewer, William McKinley and other graduates of the law school. The president suggested the adoption of a badge or button to be worn by students in every department of the university. He proposed that the next banquet be held in Albany in order to emphasize more fully the Union idea. ''A tnore determined effort is essential for the culmi- nation of the object in view. Evetyone must understand that Union means co-operation, the joining of liberal culture with technical train- ing.\ Dr. Arthur G. Root, of the Medical College faculty, was the next speaker. He enlarged on the university idea, and proposed an exchange of cout·tesies atnong the various departtnents. Dr. Root referred with pride to the present high standing of the medical departtnent among sitnilar institutions of its kind. \It possesses sotne of the finest laboratories in the countrv, '!

6 THE OONOORDIENSIS .. and the best hospital in New York or even in the United States. Th.e buildings, equipped with every n1odern appliance, aftord splendid opportunities to the searcher after bun1an physi- cal welfare.\ He clahned that the advantage of a small n1edical college lies in the opportunity offered the student of receiving sotne part of the personality of his instructor. In closing, the speaker expressed his hope for a closer connec- tion between the institutions, saying, ''If we are one in heart and united in purpose, seven- teen tniles cannot separate us.\ J. Ralph Hilton, Yale '97, law 1900, who toasted \A Spirit of Unity,\ said in part: \In behalf of the Law School, I would like to thank the students of Union for your very kind invita- tion to be with you tonight. We especially appreciate the spirit which has inspired this invitation. Your very cordial welcotne has won our heatts. A good dinner usually does win a young man. We have cotne, we have seen, and we are conquered. The speaker, as well as other tnetnbers of the Law School, find it somevvhat difficult to claitn allegiance to Union. As you may knovv, 1nany members of the school are enrolled among the alutnni of sister colleges. The drift of these retnarks is toward a closer union between the professional schools in Albany and the student body here in Schenectady. We of the Law School would appeal to you to do everything in your power to join closer these parts of the University. We would have you consider carefully the good athletic material in the Law School. We have 1nen there, who would consider it an honor to win a place on the ball nine or the football team. Such a unity of interest is what creates the spirit of an university. \1'he watchword of the country today is ' Organize ! ' It is the key note of the busi ... ness methods of today. The nation is today organized and unified as never before. Grad- uates frotn colleges and professional schools do not realize the important part they n1ust take in advancing the interests of their country, both politically and industl\ially. The proportion of well educated tnen in this country is very stnall when cotnpared to those who have not had the advantages of a more liberal education, and the opportunity was never greater in this country for the advance of the hard-working, ambitious· man in his profession. The profession of law today demands men of ~bility, honesty and industry more than ever before. Let a spirit of tnutual advancetnent and unity prevail in Union University and we shall accomplish son1.ething which we shall look back to with satisfaction and pride in future years. DeBau11 VanAken, Ph. G., responded for \The College of Pharruacy .\ \ The 1·elations of this departtnent to the university,\ l1e said, ''are unique. This bt·anch originated and has lived its whole life under the jurisdiction of the university. The other professional schools and the Schenectady bran.cl1es were all in existence before the fonnation of the university. The departn1ent of pharmacy is now enjoying the largest classes in its history. ....t\.s the youngest 1nember of the confederation, it takes a keen interest in the university, and looks ttp with veneration to the older depa1·hnents. It believes Union has a grand and glorious future and hopes to partake in gQod tneasure of the assured prosperity.\ Prof. vVillian1 Wells entertained the ban- queters with an interesting account of his first visit to Union when called frotn his chair at Genesee, now Syracuse University. He related several atnusing anecdotes of his early days at the college. Dr. \Veils said that the university idea is b1·oadening at Union as elsewhere. Affection and loyalty a1·e constantly tnanifesting itself in her alun1ni. The second toast on '~Retniniscence\ was delightfully responded to by John Keyes Paige, college '65, who was introduced not only as an alumnus hut as a tnetn ber of one of the old Dorpian f~nnilies. M1·. Paige's class was in college at a n1e1norable titne in the history of the country. Fort Sumter vvas fired upon at the beginning of their course. The many Southern students departed in a body at n1idnigh.t. The next morning, on a down town flag-staff, the halyards were found to be cut and the Stars and Stripes were discovered at the top upside down. Not a single professo1· that was on the faculty in '65 is here no\v. Mr. Paige told of several lallghable stories of the eccentricities of 1'ay lor I I I ; I t '

I I I ! •, THE OONCORDIENSIS. 7 Lewis and other tnembers of the faculty. '65 was the last class to have its diplomas signed by Dr. Eliphalet Nott. The class gra,duated sixty men, of whom twenty-four were stage men. The exercises lasted from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon.\ \Union College,\ said Mr. Paige, \has a known past. It has exerted tnore influence on the ,country in pro- portion to its size than any other institute of learning in the land. We know the college has encountered difficulties and triumphed. She has a glorious future. I predict that she will yet be the leading university of the land.\ The speech most enjoyed by the undergradu- ates \vas that of Fred. W. Hild, '98, who was toastm~ster at the university banquet two years ago. He said that undergraduate exhubernnce finds its true expression in athletics. The col- legian's duties do not cease with the paytnent of his athletic subscriptions. Those of the faculty, the alun1ni, and 4 ~Jim, the Copper,\ only do. Loyal encouragement should be given to all of the teams in every way. The speaker con1- tnended the present purity of athletics at Union which he declared above reproach. Consider- ing football as the typical and foremost college sport, he gave a short sketch of the 'varsity elevens since '93. Frotn his remarks he drew three logical conclusions. Most Union men learn the game on the can1pus with little coach- ing. Their knowledge is therefore necessarily a mixture of ideas on the subject, and concentra- tion of energy is impossible. A thorough sys- tematic grounding in the art of football is neces- sary for the turning out of a capable 'varsity eleven and the de\reloptnent of a distinctive style of playing. The best way to secure this end is by a course of systetnatic coaching for seven1l years. For this purpose a self appointed con1tnittee, co1nposed of E. E. Draper, '97; P. B. Yates, S. G. H. 1'urner and F. ,,\ 7 • f-Iild, '98, ~tnd I-I. J. Hinn1an, '99, have started a rnovetnent. According to this plan, one hund- red of the younger alumni are each to contribute five dollars a year for three successive seasons. Allen J. Dillingham, '88, is to be treasurer of the fund. The comtnittee is to be self-perpetuat- ing, as each graduating class is to elect a repre- sentative on a committee of three. The details of the plan are nearly finished, and more than twenty pledges have been already received. Coaches are to be secured frotn the best univer- sities, and later alumni coaches are to be obtained. Should a surplus arise in the fund, it will be used to secure coaches for baseball and track athletics. We all believe that Union's athletics should be p1·o1noted by every legitimate means. Gentlemen., let us drink to Union, her athletics and her athletic heroes.\ George Lenz, n\leclical 1900, responded to the toast\ Medical College Life.\ He sketched in a htnnorous way life at the medical and described the characteristics of student life at the professional school at Albany. The last speaker was William Dewey Loucks, 1900, who represented the college undergradu- ates in a toast on \Social Life at Union.\ He said in part: \The ulthnate goal of a college education is not tnerely to convert the brain into a depository of learning and a library of reference, but tnuch rather to so develop the intellect of the student that he tnay leave his ahna ntater with such a fixed character as to appear a cultured man atnong the citizens of any cotntnunity. Of the greatest importance to student character making is the social influence that surrounds the young man during his college course. The social life and influences surround- ing us undergraduates of Old Union are of such a character as to give aid and strength to the individual and to produce manly rnen, tnentally and physically. This influence is to be found, first, in our faculty. They all possess young hearts and s_nnpathy and affection for young men. 1.'he s1noker and the college dance always have ~8 welcon1e guests n1en1bers of the faculty, vv ho enter henrtily into the enjoy1nents of the hour. This social connection of professor and scholar leads to no favoritistn but rather allovvs the influence of the older n1ind to touch the younger. Another great power in student cl~aracter tnak- ing tod::ty is the existence of the fraternity system. The fraternity, partly for its ovvn and partly for the sake of the individual, rubs off the rough places, polishes the uneven surfaces, fills up the cracks and leaves him a man able to appear like a tnan among his felows. The puny

8 THE OONOORDIENSIS. minded lad of tnatriculatioa becomes the more developed man of the world at :graduation. Athletics form another influence :for the better. They put within a tna n a clear sph·it. A tn·an in training can only partake of those social inter~ ests which will lift him up and make a tnan .of him. Besides, there is tl1einfluence of Dorpian society. The fact of being a student at Union is the only credential needed to insure a hearty welcotne to the best holill.es in the city. Society occupies the leisure lTlO ments and helps make character. vVhen we bee orne old in body and palsied in spirit, then oHly shall we lay aside social pleasures.'' The bulk of the cred,it for the great success of the banquet is due to the committee, A. B. Lawrence, 1900; E. C. Rogers, 1900; C. D. Stewart, lgoo; Mr. HerTick from the Law, and Mr. Merritnan from the Medical. BE' EN I QITE?

Jones gave the Latin Scientific division of the sophomore class a very interest- ing lecture on college customs at Oxford Uni .. versity, last ThtnAsday. R. C. A. The shock of Robert Alexander·s death was to tne benumbing, as if some comtnanding feature of .a familiar landscape, conspicuous for the strength and beauty with which it broke the sky-line, and associated with a n.1ultitude of delightful experiences had suddenly disappeared, and left the well-known scene transformed into something unrecognizable and devoid of charn1. One of the inspirations of my work \vas the expectation of Bob's hearty appreciation of every success, and one of the surest preventives against discouragetnent was his ready and intelligent sympathy and unfailing cheerfulness. To those of us whose affections were largely invested in the prosperity of the old college at Schenectady he was the very genius of hope. He had an infinite faculty of devising ways and tneans for the accomplishment of every needfitl enterprise. He anticipated exigencies and asked to be permitted to do difficult and costly things with the courtesy of one seeking a favor, or he informed us before we had quite realized our own need that he had already divined it and provided relief. If we were ever confronted by a difficulty unforeseen by him, and sought his aid, his response was it11mediate. He was an ideal alumnus and trustee. He was overwhelmed with other affairs, but he attended to ours as if he were a tnan of leisure created on purpose to help us, and he never made us sensible of any obligation. There could not be a more ardent nor a 1nore unselfish zeal fo1· the college. I said that he had disappeared. He is re- appearing in rnemot·ies strong as life, stronger than death. He is ''an ever-fixed n1ark,\ incap- able of change. On blu~ gate, and seat of stone, on pillared ·walls, and swelling dotne, on medallioned arch, on library book-plate, even in the patterns wrought by the wild flowers in the college woodland, I shall see the symbolic R. C. A. as clearly as in France I have seen chiseled in stone the massive laureled N, that is the vestige of the vanished Napoleon. He had no vulgar love for notoriety. He prepared no grand climaxes at the pinnacle of

THE OONOORDIENSIS. which he should appear to catch the eye of the tnultitude and to drink in the rapture of applause. He sought prominence for ideas and institutions and enterprises that he deemed worthy, but not for hin1self. He .loved and helped those who reverenced the sa111e ideas, and he cherished their fatn·e more dearly than his own. They were worshippers with l1im in the same temple, and at the satne shrine, and with him they , shared its sanctity. In the exceeding tnodesty of his nature he ~aw the golden. light which. fell ' about them but he did not see the greater glory that enveloped hirnself. He had in a singularly large measure the grace of self-effacement, so beautiful in a tnan, so rare in this age of fierce striving and political advertising. History records it as the chann of Sidney, the jewel of Elizabeth's court; n1en who knew George vVilliatn Curtis found its win- son1eness there ; I could n1ention a third still living in whom it is the flower of an exquisite tnanhood, but to name him would be too much like sacrilege. Meeting Alexander after a long interval in which we had both grown to rnanhood, I was atnazed to hear him say, \Do you recall your speech on that occasion? It was that which led tlle to take that step.\ My boylsh speech ! It was as if Browning's Pippa had suddenly been confronted with a declaration of the tremendous influence wrought by ht=r little snatches of childish song on her one-day holiday. ''I breathed a song into the air It fell to earth, I knew 11ot where. * * * * * * And the song from beginning to end I found again in the heart of a friend.'' As I look 1nournfully ovet· a hatch of letters signed R. C. A., tireless activity, generosity, cheeriness, self-fo1·getfulness, frankness, sincere devotion stand revealed under that sytn bol. Because these significant initials can no tnore be appended to fresh proofs of ht\s affectionate regard, I transfer them to the beginning of my tribute and send the communication to the college papet· of which he was once editor and in which he always maintained so lively an interest; while my work goes on, cheered by the n1emory of his valued fdend~hip, in the institu- tion that owes a large m,easu~e of its vitality to his labors, and that must contin~Je to feel the impress of his spirit as one of tl1e great forces in the shaping of its j,deals and its history. jAMES R. TRUAX. IN MEMORIAM: ROBT. C. ALEXANDER. At the meeting of the Board of Trustees of the coHege, at Albany, January z3, 1900, the following, in memory of the late Trustee Robert C. Alexander, offered byDenisWorhnan, D.D., was unanimously adopted: \ The Board of Trustees of Union College desire to place on record their deep sense of personal and official loss in the death of their late associate, Robert C. Alexander, and their profound appreciation of his varie'tl ability and \\IYorth. I-lis election to the hoard in r8go was only the realiz~ttion of a long-foregone conclusion founded on his ardent devotion to his alma mater, his universal and deserved popularity an1ong her ahnnni, their desh·e that the college might have advantage of bis zeal and wisdom in this official position, and our own assurance that no man could better serve he1· tllan he. At the same time that we so hig'bly valued him as a counselor, this feeling vvas ahnost lost in admira- tion of him as a friend and brother--so pure, so utterly unselfish, so generous, at·dent, wise. '' We are at a loss to find proper expression of our gt·ief that one so etninently capable, and filling so many departments of usefulness, should so early in life be called a\-\Vay. To his bereaved wife, to his brother, who shares with us the responsibility of trustee ; to his father, who mav well be proud to have reat-ed a son so noble and lamented, we beg to tende1· 011r most sympa- thetic condolence. Nor do we forget the large influence he exerted as the able and conscientious editor of a paper that is such a credit to Ameri- can jou.r~alistn; nor a1·e we blind to the great probab1hty that, spared on-ly a few years longer, his character and his executive gifts would have been deemed necessary to add new grace and dignity to our public service, of which, indeed, his 1nodesty only had already prohibited his acceptance. But his life shall prove a perpetual testimony and inspiration., and the impression of his Christian character shall continue not down but up the years ! \

Y., as second- class matter. Chas. :Burrows, P1·inter, 414 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. THERE rs A deep significance in the two tributes to Robert C. Alexander which appear in this issue of The Concordiensis. Though it is three months since the earth claitned what was mortal of him, today's heartfelt tributes to his memory prove its immortality. Both bear evidence of the strong personality that was his, for us a high incentiYe to noble manhood. THE SENTIMENT displayed at the university banquet looking toward closer bonds between the various branches of the university, is certainly most encouraging. It is naturally a source of great pleasure to us of the college who have long hoped for union in fact as well as in name; and if we may judge from remarks of the representatives from the Law, Medical and Pharmacy, the pro- fessional schools are not only proud of their connec- tion with Union University but they, too, favor a closer relatiou between the parts. So much for ,the sentiment; but don't let us stop there. The speaker from the Law school struck the key note of the evening when he declared that in that department is an abundance of athletic tnaterial ready to, cooperate with us in the various branches of athletics' arid turn out winning teams to bring renown to Union University. If, then, this is the case, there should be no delay in our coming to an understanding with the Law n1en, for only a short way ahead is the season of baseball and track athletics. Next week the columns of The Concordiensi s will be open to suggestions of procedure to bring about such a system of athletic cooperation. To be sure, union in athletics is only one phase of the ideal union, but it is perhaps wise to atten1pt one thing at a tin1e. VESPE~ SEQVICE. Dr. :Riggs, th~e Eminent Preacher, the Speaker. The n1eeting in chapel Sunday afternoon was quite largely attended in spite of the inclement \'\reather. The Rev. Dr. J. A. Riggs of the Auburn Theological Seminary, who filled the pulpit of the First Reformed church in the absence of Dr. Raymond, made the address, which was sin1ple and at the satne time especi- ally eloquent and forceful. It held the closest attention of the audience and greatly impressed thetn. Dr. Riggs read passages fron1 the book of St. John illustrating the three kinds of Christtan doubters: Nicodemus, who doubted frorr1 force of his reason; rfhotnas, who doubte.<:l becau&e he saw no evidence, and the Pharisee, vvho cared not to believe. He said that there was no question but that Christ respected the doubt or him whose rea:5on prevented his acceptance of all the Christian doctrines but who wished to be tnade to perceive ; and that Christ respected hiln who, until he should have a finn founda- tion for his belief, must doubt. But the doubters whom He could not approve, were those who doubted from their will. =

As one enters the city, the first thing that attracts ·his attention is the sound of the chi n1es, pealing- foTth frotn the great steeple of the cathedral. I 11 the n1orniug- vve started to see the cathedral, the chitnes of. which had been ringing in our ears during n1ost of the night. Before visiting the interior of the structure, \vhich is the largest and n1ost bcc.u tifu 1 gothic church in Belgilu11, we ascended the long stai rvvay, until at last we reached the cl1i tnes above the clock. 'The view t l1at r11et our gaze w·as one of sur- pas~ing beauty. ltnrnediately at our feet, four hundred feet below us, lay the city, through the streets of which the Belgians vvere slovvly wend- ing their way. A little farther distant was the river Scheldt., winding far away in the distance, carrying on its bosotn the cotntnerce of the nation. As we stood watching the river, we saw that it was d()tted with sails as far as the eye could see. The boats moving along, dis- turbed the cahJl of the river, and sent the water rippling towar<l the shore. Far in the distance we could catcl1 the sight of beautiful hills and n1ountains. The whole city, and the surround- ing country for miles and miles was laid out before our eyes, and the beauty of the scene was magnified by the .early tnorning sun. In places the land was seen jutting out into the river, and then in other places little strearns ran inland, fonning pect.tlia1·l.:y shaped lakes. Above us were great fleecy clouds, piled high like heaps of snow white wool. Just above our heads pealed forth the music of that fatuous chonts of sixty bells, which seemed almost like the 1nusic of another world, sending a thrill through our whole being-no ordinary music, but harmony of the sweetest character, and ever varying in its melody. But a scene of a little different nature was awaiting us below in the interior of the cathe- dral, and so we reluctantly descended, and left behind this panorama of nature,--but not its n1.etnory. On entering we found that everything attractive in the line of art, whether of architec- ture, of painting, or of music, was to be found here. It is said that Rome herself can scarcely boast of more costly pictures or of treasures more vast, than are possessed by this famous cathedral. Before us, adorning the walls of this old and beautiful structure, were the tnasterpieces of Rubens and Van Dyke. The ''Descent fron1 the Cross\ is the finest painting in Europe. It would bear study for weeks and months. Not far from this great painting is another by the sarne masterhand, - \rl'he Elevation of the Cross.\ These two paintings are p1·otected by folding doors, and are only exposed to public view a few hours on Thursday and Sunday rnornings. These are but two of the three hundred paintings in the cathedral. Antwerp is a city, the very atmosphere of which breathes of art. Here Rubens was born and died. Here his great pupil and successor, Van Dyke, produced his finest works. rrhere is son1ething about the whole place, that chatms and sooths one's whole nature. Wherever you go, you £nd something attractive and beautiful. The old houses, the little shops, the dogs draw- ing their carts, the men and women with their wooden shoes-all have their interest. We cannot but desire to retnain longer by the river's bank, in the shade of the trees, to watch the passing scenes, and listen to the quiet murmer of the river at our feet and the ringing of the chitnes from yonder towering spire.

The college has purchased, for the engineering department a battery oft wenty-five storage cells which will soon be put in service by the senior engineers under the direction of Professor Eddy. The storage cells are designed to light the engineering rooms in north colonnade. Previ- ously, electricity for this purpose has either been furnished by the gas engine presented the college last year by the Westinghouse company or through the local company's meter in the Physics room. The new. cells will be charged by the gas engine and are expected to have suffi- cient capacity for one or two weeks' service. Memorial Hall will probably be lighted by this tneans on the occ.asion of the sophomore soiree. It will be remembered that a similar attetnpt last year proved entirely successful. A THLETlCS AND SCHOLARSHIP. The Boston \Traveller\ recently published ' statements from Harvard, Princeton and Cornell in reply to the charge that college athletics are detrimental to scholarship. Professor Huffcut of Cornell stated that he had just completed a careful statistical exarnination of the question of the scholarship of football men and that \ there is no indication that their work in the fall terms is below their work in the tern1s \Vhen they do not play football.\ Professor Huffcut says; \My own obser- vations tend to convince tne that playing or not playing football has but little to do with a stu- dent's standing. Men will take leisure for son1ething and energetic rnen like to take it for outdoor sports; others take the same an1ount of leisure for other things, such as tnusical clubs, dramatic clubs, chess clubs, college periodicals and the like or perhaps in tnere social pleasures or plain 'loafing.' A student's standing is therefore but very little influenced by the par- ticular fonn of leisure amusetnent in \vhich he indulges.\ The staternents from Harvard and Princeton fully corroborate the statements of Professor Huffcut.-Cornell Daily Sun. THE VESPE~ SE~VICE. The Rev. J. D. Dingwell of Park Place chapel spoke before the Y. M. C. A. vesper service Sunday afternoon. He referred to the great work done for students by Henry Drum- mond, and noted the great inspiration which this great preacher gives to students of his life. The speaker then tnentioned different views on theology and the need for unity of belief in religion. Incidents in the life of Dwight L. Moody were cited to prove this necessity. Mr. Dingwell spoke of the need of meri for the n1in- istry, not only to attend the theological setni- naries but to be ministers in everyday life. The physician and the lawyer should be as true ministers as the man who preaches in the pulpit. In closing, the speaker emphasized the large opportunities for young men to lead Christian lives and help their fellows by a Christian example.

EVERYONE who attended the university banquet will recall the response to the toast, ''Social Life at Union.-\ It is significant that such was the subject of the address g-iven by the representative of the student body of the college, for the import- ance of our social life cannot be overestimated. The speaker's words on the occasion referred to were full of meaning, and it is unnecessary for us to repeat here the sentiment then expressed. But just a word of applicati()n. The Sophomore soiree is only ten days a way. It is distinctly a college affair. It is the only large dance of the term. The committee are sparing no pains to make it a success. They desire the cooperation of every man in college, and they certainly should have it. First of all, the sophomore class should support the dance: at last year's soiree there was present from the class but one man outside of the com- mittee. That was disgraceful, and 1902 should not repeat it. But after the sophomore, it is the duly of every undergraduate to attend. A legi ti- mate college interest, the soiree claims, and should be given the support of all. THE TIME is now ripe for the establishment at BE SURE to be present at Monday's college meet- Union of a student government committee. The ing. A full attendance is necessary, as matters of propriety of such an organization must be recog- importance are to come up for consideration. nized by all. There is hardly an institution in the country that has not an undergraduate council CoMPLAINT is made that the bells which are rung to mark the recitation periods cannot be heard of late, in all the rooms on the campus. And it is also reported that the bell which is supposed to ring at three-thirty in the afternoon, has for several weeks past, been very irregular, varying sometimes from five to ten minutes after the half hour, and more often not ringing at all. Both evils are easily remedied. For the first we suggest a little more force at the end of the rope, and for the of some kind, and in every case such a council has, we believe, been found of great value in the con- duct of student affairs. It furnishes a recognized head for the undergraduate body, a want long- felt at Union. Just at this time, when we are working for a closer university spirit, an under- graduate council offers itself as a means to that end. By placing on the committee representatives from the professional schools at Albany, we may have in truth a university council, the close orga- nization of which will offer an opportunity of second an accurate timepiece combined with an · systematically considering- this question of a closer equal amount of the said force. \That confounded union between the several branches of the univer- old clapper,\ famous in Union song and story, has sity.

In it there have been made a few minor cpanges, mainly only such as are necessary to adapt it to local conditions. The details, however, are not important: changes may be suggested worthy of incorporation. If so, adopt them. If not, drop them. At all events, let us have an undergraduate council. Be prepared to vote on this question at the next college meeting. A COLUMBIA SU~PQISE PARTY. About nine o'clock last Wednesday evening, the occupants of South College were serenaded. Angry \\polers\ appeared at the windows, but their wrath was quickly appeased when they heard the staccato tones of the Columbia Univer- sity yell. The serenaders proved to be about twenty members of the senior electrical engineer- ing division of that institution who had spent the day at the General Electric works. Both dormitories were vis item bv the Col urn bia men \' and in a short thne all the students in the sec- tions were out upon the campus. The out of town tnen '~yelled up\ Union, and the repre- sentatives of the Garnet were hearty in their response. All invaded the chapel, while a trio of enterprising Freshtnen rang the South Col- lege bell. Addresses of welcome were made by Messrs. Tuggey, Loucks and Van Vlack, to which the New Yorkers responded. Songs of Columbia were enjoyed, each college striving to outdo the other in its display ot good will. At midnight the visitors departed amid the cheers of the Union men. PRIZES FO:Q LITERARY WORK. The Literary Rev·ievv of Boston offers three prizes of twenty-five dollars each for litet·ary work submitted by college undergraduates. The prizes will be awarded for the best short story, the best e~say on any literary subject, and for the best poem of not more than fifty lines. The contest closes July r. ALBANY ALUMNI BAN·QUET. Reunion to be Held at the Ten Eyck Friday Evening. The North-eastern New Y od( Alumni asso- ciation banquet to be held at the Ten Eyck in Albany, Friday evening, pron1ises to be an event of unusual brilliancy. Strenuous efforts have been made by the committee to make the affair a success, and a tempting menu has been prepared by the \Ten Eyck\ steward. The feast will be served in the large banquet hall, the best of its kind in the state outside of New York city. Wives and sweethearts of the diners will be accommodated in the Mezzanine gallery and will be supplied with ample refreshment. The toast list includes the names of William H. McElroy, '6o ; Dr. Henry Alanson Powell, '73, a prominent New York lawyer; Homer Greene, '76, the author of several cherished Union songs; Charles E. Patterson, '6o, of Troy, a distinguished lawyer and at one tin1e Speaker of the Assembly, and Edward J. Maxwell, '64, a leading attorney of Amsterdam. Prof. Maurice Perkins and President Ray- mond will also address the gathering of alum·ni. Governor Roosevelt will probably be present, as will the Lieutenant-Governor. William P. Rudd, '73· president of the association, will act as toastn1aster. A quartette frotn the college will lead in the singing of \Old Union'' songs, and John H. Cook, 'ox, will render several recitations during the evening. A R.ECESS OF TWO DAYS.

As there have been sotne cases of misunderstanding in regard to these subscriptions, an opportunity is given to all for righting the matter with Manager MacCulloch before the names are printed.

Vander Veer, '99, chair- man of the South College dormitory improve- ment committee, secretary and treasurer. The most important act of the meeting was the passage of a resolution approving the class of '99's plan for n1odernizing South College. Another resolution unanimously carried was one comtnending the college faculty for their efforts toward the betterment of the scholastic standing at Union. The first t·esolution is printed in full. \Whereas We learn that the class of '99 of Union College is making an earnest effort to raise $15,ooo from the alumni and friends of the college for the purpose of repairing and modern- izing the present South college dormitory ; therefore be it \Resolved That vve, the tnembers .of the Northeastern N evv York Alun1ni Association of Union College, do hereby congratulate the class for its interest :in our altna mater; and further, we do hereby agree to aid and co-operate with it in its effort, to the best of our ability, toward the early accomplishment of the plan.\ Following the business tneeting, a sumptuous dinner was served in the banquet hall. At its conclusion President Rudd, acting as toast- tnaster, rose and rapped for attention. He said in part: ''The days of Union's strength are not num- bered. They bring constantly and ever increas- ing evidences of renewed power, and in the present we can be as assured of the future as we are of the past. To our college we can wish for nothing better, than that in the circle of the colleges our fair mother tnay in the future shine as resplendent as she has in the past. 'By their fruits ye shall know them.' One President of the United States, two Secretaries of State, two Justices of the United States Supreme Court, ten United States Senators, within the last ten years three Members of the Presidential Cabinet, two Speakers of the House of Representatives, one hundred and fol'tv Members of the House of .... Representatives, thirty-six College Presidents, and one-fifth of the whole nutnber of Judges elected to the bench of the Court of Appeals by the Supretne Court, in our state. These are on our roll.\ Mr. Rudd paid a. graceful compliment to Dr. Raytnond in con1paring hirr1 with Dr. Nott in regard to his youth, his call to the presidency of Union from an Albany Presbyterian pulpit and his hopefuL, energetic struggle for the college's interests,

THE CONC'ORDIENSIS. Dr. Raymond told of his hopes for Union's , future while at the same time he skillfully , directed the association's attention to U niot:t's i need of money. He humorously described his present failure in hunting for this much desired article but expressed encouraging hopes for the future. ''Most colleges,\ said he, \'are local institutions. Less than one-half the students of tl-:1e country travel more than one hundred miles on their way to college. The college is an institution of the local constituency. If this part of the alumni does not help it, what can be expected of the other part? Gentlemen, give us your words, your influence, your sons.\ Homer Greene, '74, of Honesdale, Pa., author of the \Union Marching Song,\ talked about ''' The Average Alumnus.\ This individual, he claimed, is a type of ninety-five per cent. of college graduates. The average alumnus is the one who does the world's work manfully and whose name is rarely heard outside of the community. The college's real ain1 is not so much to turn out the distinguished graduate as to fit this average alumnus for the walks of life. The address of the Hon. Charles E. Patter- son, '6o, on ''Students as Educators,\ created much thoughtful amusement. While not dis- crediting the value of the intellectual student life, Mt-. Patterson sought to emphasize the value of that other part of it-the rubbing together of rnan with ma.n. Edward J. Maxwell, '64, entertained the banqueters with several pleasing reminiscences of old college days. Dr. Perkins' address was entitled \-? ?-\ but proved otherwise. Dr. Perkins, in part, speaking as a non-fraternity man, laid stress upon the leading part which the secret society plays in college life. The addresses of Henry A. Powell, '73, on \The College Man as a Citizen,\ and Danforth E. Ainsworth, Deputy Superintendent of Public Instruction, on '' Governmental Suicide by Edu- cation,\ were cut short by those gentlemen by reason of the lateness of the hour. During the evening letters of regret were read from Hon. Daniel S. Lamont, '72, and Postmaster-General Charles Emory Smith, '6r. John H. Cook, 190r, rendered an impersonation during the . eventng. .

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 7 CONCERNING SOCIOLOGY. A list of the books presented to the college library by the class of 1900 for use in tl1e course in sociology may b~ found in another column. A mere glance at the list is sufficient to show the value of the acquisition and the importance of such literature to the work in sociology. In presenting the books, the class has followed the comtnenda ble precedents established by the two preceding graduating classes. Through their generosity, nearly a $100 worth of the very best books upon the subject has been added to the library in two years. This sutn represents net library prices and is exclusive of costs for car- riage. ll1e books have been selected with care and with a view to their especial adaptability to the needs of the class, and the subjects and methods of the course. These gifts were suggested by the insurmount- able difficulties experienced in following the course in sociology properly without the '' authorities\ fot· the purposes of collateral reading. There were practically no books in the library on the subject from which assign- lnents could be made to supplement the lectures. The nature and scope of the subject make the lecture and l ibral'y tnethods the only methods that can be followed advantageously. This neces- sitates a large, well-chosen and well-balanced collection of books upon normal and patholog- ical sociology. This want the senior classes have generously attetnpted to supply, until now we have built up .a fairly good working library. The scope of the subject is so vast and its treatment up to the present time so unscientific that no satisfactory text-book has been evolved. The \doctors\ are still disputing over every essential element connected with its treatment. The very fundamentals of the science are con- sequently in the air and it will take time for them to be shaken down sufficiently to admit of that orderly, scientific treatlnent that will make pos-sible a satisfactory text-book. It is alto- gether intelligible that such should be the case ; for, while none will deny the vital importance of the study, yet all will recognize that its very nature makes the establishment of bounds and li mita'tions difficult. This is true in the early development of all sciences and one would naturally expect to find it even more obvious in the evolution of sociology. It may not he the all-inclusive science that some of its overzealous disciples would have it, but it is all-permeating. It treats of tnan in his relations to other men and these relations are innumerable in their variety, and boundless in their scope. For this reason, some German and French writers have gone so far as to call it the \ science of sciences.\ Other scholarly writers have committed the opposite error of subordinating it in their classi- fication of the sciences to the position of a mere branch of their own special subjects. Of these foreign thinkers, some fossilized theologians still make sociology subsidiary to natural theology ; some biologists presume to identify it as one of the parts of their scientific leviathan ; and there are not wanting those doctrinaire philosophers who spend their precious motnents in vain attetnpts to ra111 it up into the narrow bore of their own departmental flintlocks. Against such minimizing of such an important science, we earnestly protest. Sociology depends upon these other sciences for many of its most itnport- ant data just as they depend upon it, but to subordinate it to them is a clear case of extreme narrowness. All that is asked for sociology is a normal independence-that its individuality be pre- served. There are two sciences that everyone knows all about-economics and sociology- there may be a feV\r things concerning chemistry and biology one does not \wot of,\ but the elements of the other two sciencies just come to us intuitively-like. There is nothing in the realm of economic thought but that is pet-fectly clear to Jean at £rst blush ; and Jacques, on the other hand, knows as much about the care of dependents, defectives and delinquents as we would suppose him to know about the rotation of crops. Yet this attitude on the part of the laity is not without its advantage to the science, and its dis- advantag~s are due chiefly to the want of a proper nomenclature. It is a most hopeful sign of the titnes for it is evidence of the great inter-

THE OONCORDlENStS. est people in general are taking in the snbject. They have made it their own science and their interest is a proof of its itnportance and .a guar• antee of its continued vitality. The study of sociology has been forced upon the coJleges frotn without. The development of the s-cience has been retarded from within. Its academic friends have fought over its metes and bounds until the world doubts it has any dimensions at all. Every text-book published upon the sub- ject is nothing more than a lawyer's brief argu- ing certain views; or, a polemic characte,rized by special pleadings in favor of some pet tl1eory. Every year sees the publication of new b<>oks purporting to be text-books in sociology.. But they are not-they are better than text·hool<s. They are scholarly contributions to the literature of the science. From the point of view of scholarship, a text-book is a very ordinary pro- duction. Except as to form and machinery, it should show a n1initnum atnount of originality and a maxin1um atnount of assimilation. The best text-book is the least original. It .may lack ~n originality but it must show a high or<ler of mechanical genius. We do not attack the text-book bt1t the poverty-stricken substitute for one. Where a good book can be had it is advantageou~ to use it, for it gives the treatment of the subject proper balance and prevents unbridled digression. When used in connection with the library method it is productive of th~ best results. No reputable college today follows the '~one-book\ method in sociology. The want of a satisfactory text-book is not without its advantages. The lecture takes its place as a guide and expositor. At the same time with a well stocked library in no-:rrnal and pathological sociology, such the senior classes are contributing, we are able to :f(}llow strictly hbrary methods. In this way the stttdent is familiarized with the greatest thinkers the science has produced, and is himself tattght to think. F. R. JoNES. President Raymond gave an informal address at theY. M. C. A. meeting Sunday afternoon. THE HISTOQY OF ALGEBQA. Mr. Duncan gave his algebra classes a talk on the development of that branch of mathematics last Thursday morning. He said that the Greeks evolved the first algebraic principles, Archimedes propounding the problem of the cattle, which is still unsolved, though the esti- mated result would make a string of figures over two miles long. Another Greek, Diophantus, 'vrote a treatise on mathematics, the ''Arithnte- ticos,\ and is called the \Father .of Algebra.\ The Romans did not contribute anything original to the science, merely collecting the Greek writings. In Europe, during the middle ages, no advancement was made, but the Hin- doos so far improved upon ·Grecian systetn, as to use the quantity zero, and negative quantities, expressed by a dot over the nun1ber. They also tnade use of indeterminate equations. The Arabs took their turn, translating the learning of the Hindoos into their own tongue. Very much of the nomenclature of modern algebra is derived from the Arabic, the name itself coming from \Al-jebr the title of an Arabian work on the subject. During the Renaissance the Italians were the foremost algebraists, solving equations as high as the fourth degree. Abel, a Swede, showed that it was impossible to solve equations of any higher degree by algebraic methods. During the seventeenth century, the Gennan and English mathematicians were the most active, inventing many symbols, and giving us the tables of logarithms, perfected by Briggs. Algebra as it is today, Mr. Duncan said, is principally based on the exhaustive studies of Euler, ·who was born in Switze1·Iand, but after- wat·d went to Russia as court mathematician, and of Newton, who invented the binomial theoretn. A religious mass meeting of the Young People's Societies of Christian Endeavor and kindred societies of the city, was held in the State Street Methodist Church Thursday even- ing. Among the speakers were Dean Ripton and the Rev. J. C. Russum, '77·

.._,.,' THE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 THE KIDNAPPING OF THE FRESHMEN OFFICERS. Two as remarkable pieces of daring as the college has ever known were perpetrated prior to the 1903 banquet by a s-tnall band of sopho- mores upon the persons of two members of the former class,-Archibald A. Lee of Albany, and George C. Macfarlane of Towanda, Pa. 'These individuals were unfortunate enough to be officers of the banquet, the former expecting to act as toastmaster, while the latter is v·ice- president of the class. Lee was abducted Satur- day evening from a place near his hotne in Albany, while Macfarlane was seized just above the blue gate on Union street early Sunday morning. Attempts Friday to seize the freshman officers frightened W. J. Dicl\:enson, the president, and A. A. Lee, the toastmaster, out of town. Accordingly Saturday afternoon two sets of sophomores left for Albany in search of the missing n1en. The first three men Shaw ' . ' Clevel~nd and Dunning, joined by Wilson, ascertained Lee's whereabouts, devised a schetne for his capture, and waited with a hack upon the second party ,--Stiles, Thebo and Finnegan -at the Union depot on the arrival of the six- thirty train. The six: were driven quickly up Clinton avenue and into a dark place near it on Knox street. A plan had been devised to decoy the freshman from his home on Clinton avenue but this soon proved unnecessary, for scarcely a few mon1ents elapsed when Lee walked into their hands from an errand at a nearby grocery store. \ Hello fellows,\ said he with open astonish- ment and then started to run. Not far, how- ever, for he was quickly seized and .hustled into the waiting carriage. Three men entered at the same time and the four were quickly driven over the viaduct. His situation and that of his captors from that time until Monday night was unknown except by a chosen few. Macfarlane's capture took place early Sunday morning in a similar manner. Accompanied by nnother freshman on the way from the post- office he was surprised by six men in another hack, and hustled off. THE FQESHMAN BANQUET. A Successful Affair Held on Monday Evening. The banquet of the Class of 1903 was finally celebtated at the Edison hotel on Monday even- ing, and despite the absence of the toastmaster, elsewhere explained, the affair passed off to the entire satisfaction of all present and to the credit of the committee of arrangements. An excel- lent menu was provided and was excellently served, so that by eleven o'clock the toasts began. An unwary soph who ventured into the hotel corridor early in the evening was present at the banquet, but he did not partake of the viands. Seated upon a high chair to which he formed an attachment, he viewed the progress of the feast, and was finally released after half of the toast8 were over. The following were the speakers and their subjects : Donald 0. Boudeman, toastmaster; \Old Union,\ William Dewey Loucks, 1900; \Out· I-Iistory ,\ Clinton Benjamin Hawn; \The Future,\ Sebas Y. Meneses; ''Class Spirit,\ Prof. J. H. Pollard; ''The Ladies,\ George William Donnan ; \1902 Chat·les Falconer; \The Faculty,\ Glowacki Parker. The crowd dispersed at a late hour, the last sensation of the evening being the arrival of the relief expedition, who reported that they found the missing toastmaster and chairman barricaded in a country hotel, but that all attempts at rescue had proved in vain.

IN ACCORDANCE with the sentiment of the student body, the list of unpaid football subscriptions is printed in another column. It is to be hoped that the new method of having the subscriptions made written obligations will cause a more thorough understanding between all parties. But the best method to raise money for athletics is to have sub- scriptions made at the opening of the season paid within a month. This will give the athletic board and the manager a safe estimate from which to work. THE MEMBERS of the 1901 Garnet board are daily confronted by the query, When is the Garnet coming out ? The majority of these questioners are ignorant of what such a \corning out \ involves, and content themselves with simply posing as critics on the book, and critics in the hardest sense of the word. What the board desires is to render all criticism on the VQl ume favorable. To do this requires, not a seeming interest in its publication ·- . --· -~- ~ ... ·- -.-. -· -- and appearance, but a visible zeal in furnishing material for its literary side. This is the depart- ment in which all the students can work, and the only department wherein such work reveals itself. The board compliments these men who have done their share, and hopes that the whole student body will awaken to their sense of duty, and pro- mote the Garnet's ee1:rly appearance. A few more_ weeks are left. For the sake of convenience, all literary material suitably sig11ed may be left at the college office to be collected by the editor. IT IS A pleasure to record the fact that the pres\ ent senior class. has followed the excellent -ex- ample set by its two predecessors, in presenting to the library a substantial addition to the socio- logical alcove. The system inaugurated three years ago at the suggestion and under the direc- tion of Dr. Jones, is certainly one of great merit, and the result has been the building up of t:his department of the library, until now the sociologi- cal library in this college is t~e equal of that in any institution of our size in the country, and, it may safely be added, of many institutions that boast of larger numbers. This splendid equip- ment has been brought about almost entirely by the students in three classes, aided by the instruc- tor at the head of the department, who has selec- ted the books with careful judg-ement so as to put to the best possible use the funds subscribed by ., the classes. The results of the system are most satisfactory and succeeding classes will do well to perpetuate the custom.

A recent editorial in the Kennebec Journal made glad the heart of the college fraternities by i.ts treattnent of the following clipping: Just what part the Greek--letter societies take in the education of the college student is some- thing that has never yet been explained.---Phila- delphia Ledger. In fact, it was so good that we feel justified in quoting it in substance: ''It is certain that this vicious little squib vvas written by an editor who was never fortunate enough to belong to a college fraternity. He simply doesn't know what he is talking about. · To those who know anything about colleges and college fraternities, no explanation of the important part they play in education is neces ... sary ~ Other persons need hardly be considered in this connection. Some few colleges, years ago, with a conservatism verging on bigotry, refused to allow the introduction of Greek-letter fraternities. · Such a regulation could never be passed today, and we have no hesitatjon in declaring that every educator of note in the country recognizes the worth and importance of college fraternities. No figures can measure the important part they play in the development and training of the college man. Their literary, social and fraternal sides sttpplernent the work of the class-room and laboratory with a helpful influence that is extretnely potent. Their ideals are the highest, and the lessons they teach are remembered much longer than Latin verbs or chemical formulre. Their secret features are as necessary as to the Masonic and other great orders, and are no more used to cover abuses or questionable practices. \ To the small college they mean more than to the large universities, but at no institution except Harvard have they been a failure. In no secret organizations that exist are the bondf:l of brother- hood so close and so lasting as in these frater- nities, and the loyalty of their alumni is the. best proof of the good that they do for their mem- bers. The fraternities help and strengthen the colleges. The h1tercollegiate feature of the fraternities does much to give the ttndergradu- ates a broader view of the educational world., and to soften the rivalries that inevitable exist between neighboring colleges that compete in athletic contests. \Many thousand college graduates will assure you that above all els~ in their undergraduate life they cherish the metnory of the associations and influence and training of their fraternity.

As&emblyman Larzelere has introduced a bill into the legislature with the purpose in view of · doing away in its entirety of the practice of hazing. Mr. Larzelere claims that hazing has recently been carried on in New York state colleges to an alarming extent. The bill pro- vides that if death ensues as a result of hazing, the person or persons found guilty shall be held for manslaughter in the second degree and on conviction shall be punished accordingly. In any other case the penalty will be a fine of not less than $5o nor more than $)oo, or by i tnprisonment in a county jail or penitentiary for not less than three months nor more than one year, ot· by both such fine and imprisonment. The total registration in the ten leading Ameri- can Universities has been calculated by the Har- vard Graduates Magazine to be 25,394 students, the registr~tion of the individual universities being as follows: Harvard, 5,250; Michigan, 3•346; Columbia, 3,083 ; Yale, 2,688; Pennsyl- vania, 2,651 ; Cornell, z,645 ; Wisconsin, 2,025 ; Chicago, 1 ,68o; Princeton, I, 194 and Johns Hopkins, 63 2. Two of these universities, Yale and Pennsylvania, have a smaller registration this year than last-Yale having 20 students less and Pennsylvania 78. The increase at Columbia over last year's enrollment is 246; at Michigan, 242; at Cornell, 203; at Harvard, 199; at Wis- consin, 199; at Princeton, 95 ; at Chicago, 32, and at Johns Hopkins, 5.-The Princetonian.

Prof. Ashmore gave an interesting illustrated lecture on the Roman Forum to the metnbers of the two lower classes last Thursday evening. A number of upper c1assmen and n1embers of the faculty also attended, and the address was thoroughly enjoyed by all. At a recent meeting of the Garnet board, it was decided to strengthen its editorial staff by the addition of another member, the representa· tive of the new Medical fraternity N u Sigma Nu. This action will undoubtedly be a decided step toward stre-ngt~ening the bond of union between the departtnents of the university. Nu Sigma Nu has a record that embraces zeal, as is evidenced by the manner in which their repre- sentative, Leland 0. White, has entered upon his work.

i'HE CONC.ORDtENSlS. 13 ·~-. ~- ·- ..... - ·-·- .. ·-~ - ---- - CONCERNING DEBATING. A tnarked im.provetnent in the skill of college debaters has followed the revival of interest in the subject of student debating. This has been due in a large measure to the inauguration of intercollegiate debates. The outside competi- tion has intensified that between the different organizations within the college. An effective stimulant is the eclat which victory gives to the institution and the societies [both debating and Greek Letter] to which the victors belong. This eclat is shared by the visitors personally, and, in some degree, by their friends and acquaint- ances at home. The increasing desire for opportunity to prac- tice, in addition to that furnished by the library facilities has led to debates both within and between the respective organizations and classes. Thus a general debating proficiency has developed and the opportunity has increased for the selection of a teatn of special protnise to represent the institution. When such a teatn has been selected and has received the special training which has been provided for it, the entire college body feels that it has substantial ground for hopes of victory in any intercollegiate tourney to which it may be committed. As an illustration of the trainet·'.s work, it has been said of one who holds a very prominent place that \ he is a clever strategist. He urges a team to pick out some position and maintain that one line of argument, letting other points take care of themselves. Under l1is training men are taught to ignore any point of their opponents which they cannot effectively refute. His two great points are the importance of sticking to facts, and the use of as few words as possible in stating what one has to say.\ Of the strategic feature of this coach's train- ing, it n1ay be said that his aim seems to be not so much to discover and exhibit the right and wrong of a given question as to show that his n1en are more skillful debaters than their oppo- nents. The training of an advocate is in1portant, though he rnay often think it to be his duty to make \the worse appear the better reason.\ But of higher importance is the training of a statesman or jurist who seeks to lay open and illuminate a subject without bias, leading the thought of his hearers to detennine .in which of two directions before them the finger of wisdom is pointing. C'an a debate be conducted from this stand- point? Certainly ; if the question be properly selected and the debaters choose sides according to their convictions; which, however, should be held subject to change or modification, according as new light may be brought to bear.

PRAISE FOR '99's SOUTH COLLEGE PROJECT. The following is a clipping taken frotn a com- munication which appeared in a recent nutnber of \The Varsity\ a weekly publication at the University of Toronto, Canada. 1.\'he comn1uni- cation deals with a proposed i tnp1·ovement in the donnitory system of the institution, and it is intere~ting for its appropriate reference to con ... ditions as they exist at Union. \Failing government aid, we must turn to the alumni; amongthetn are tnany distinguished men, who, if they were given a definite state- ment as to where the money is to go, would surely help us out. It is interesting to note in this connection that the class of '99 at Union College, a small American college, about which I can speak from personal know ledge, expects to raise $15,ooo in one year to t·e£t their dormi- tories. Something is wrong with the graduates of Toronto if they cannot do as well.\

'·. THB VoL. XXIII. · UNION COLLEGE, FEBRUARY 28, 1900. No. 18. UNION IN THE FI'ORTIES. Reminiscences of Dr. N o1t ~elated by W. J. Stillman, -'48. In his autobiography, vvbi<;b is now being published in the Atlantic Monthly, vVilliaLn James Stillman, '48, emphasizes the influence Union College exerted upon l1is life and the in1portant place it has held in tl1e country. He tells many incidents of the college life of that time, and his description of the surroundings is valuable historically. There \\\rere three build- ings: one, West College, in tbe town for the freshmen and sophomores; and two on the hill above the town, North and S<>uth Colleges, for the juniors and seniors. Both of the upper buildings were divided into £ve sections, each under the custody of one of tile professors or tutors, who was responsible for its order. At half past five the bell rang to wake the students, and again, half an hour later, for prayers. From prayers they scattered to recita- tions, and then to breakfast, mostly in town. There were two boarding hottses, one at each end of the college walk, and at these board was provided at sot11ewhat lower terms and of much inferior quality to that at the private boarding l1ouses in town. The price of board on the campus was a dollar and twenty-five cents a week, and that in town ranged from a dollar and fifty cents to a dollar and seventy-five. As a large proportion of the students '\\rere young men to w ho1n the expenses of education were a s€rious matter, many prepare~ them- selves at hotne to enter the jut1ior year, so that a class which only nun1bered a score as fresh- men, often graduated a hundred. Others, again, used to spend the winter tenn and vacations in teaching in the \district\ schools to pay the expenses of the other terms. The wages for such schools were twelve dollars a month and ''board around;\ that is, staying at the houses of the parents a week for each pupil in turn, and beginning with those in best estate. As the schools had never less than twenty or thirty pupils, the poorer famiHes were never called on. The freshn1en and sophomores, delegated to the care of the junior professers and tutors, indulged in tnany of the escapades for which college life in most countries is distinguished, and were continually brought under the inflic- tions of discipline, and now and then someone was expelled. The favorite tricks were getting a horse or cow into a recitation room, fastening the tutors in their roon1s just before the class hours, and tying up or stealing the bell which used to wake the students an(l call them to prayers and recitations ; and we find remnants of these early escapades in the breaches of dis- cipline of the present day. Excitement was somethnes aroused by setting fire to the out- houses and bringing out the city fire depart- tnent. Occasionally a demonstt·ation against an unpopular professor-a ''bolt,\ that is absten- tion en masse from a recitation-or a rarer invasion of the town broke the monotony of life on the hill; but Dr. Nott had so well policed the college, and so completely brought the town under his tnoral influence, that no serious row between the two factions ever took place. An interesting description is given of how President Nott managed one of the worst early conflicts, in which the students on one side of the college road, and the town boys on the other, were arrayed in order, determined to fight out the question as to who were the better men. The doctor had early notice of the impending row through his police, and making a circuit behind the ''town,\ encouraged the boys on that side with assurance of his itnparti- ality, and even his content with a little punish- ment of the students if they were aggressive.

i , I I I I ) ' ' : 6 THE O'ONCORDIENSIS. \ But,\ said he, \don't begin the fight, and put yourselves in the wrong. If my boys come , over, thrash thetn well, but let them strike the first blow.\ Having put the town boys in. the strongest defensive attitude, since they believed that they had the doctor with them, he went round to the students and applied the ~~tme inducements to the defensive, leaving tb.ern under the persuasion that he entirely approved of their fighting, and then he went home and left them to their conclusions. As titne p.assed and neither took the offensive, their ardor cooled off, and they retired. The tact with which Dr. Nott dealt witb the occasional outbreaks in the college was very interesting. If it was a case of wanton defia nee of the habitual order, there was a very sl!ight probability of its being overlooked. If, bow- ever, it had been j~stified by an arbitrat-y or unwise act of discipline by any of the professors, he used to ignore it altogether. The favorite prank of the stealing of the college bell was invariably punished ; first, by having a hand bell rung a little earlier than regulation bou rs all through the sections; and when his secret police had found out the offenders, they were punished according to custom, never very severely, yet sufficiently to make them feel humiliated. The mystery of his police 'Was never explained, and the students were at a loss to conjecture how he discovered the tn.<>st elaborately concealed schemes, so that sudde11Iy, even weeks after, when the culprits thought they had finally escaped detection, he rnigl1t announce at prayers that they were to come to his study to explain. Union College, at this epoch, held a high place in public esteen1 and in the number ()fits students. It owed its character and reputation to a great degree to the strong and singular personality of Dr. Nott. He had attained his high position by the force of his chat·acter assi_sted by his extraordinary tact and eloqttellce. In the days of his activity no institution in tl1e country furnished so large an element t() the practical statesmanship of the United States as did Union. Seward was one of his .favorite pupils, ~nd it i~ well known. thfl~ ~P t<> tl1e period of the ,civil war, he seldom took a step in politics without the advice of the doctor. Chester A. Arthur, afterwards President of the United States, was also under his instructi<>n and profited by his teaching. The doctor's reading of character and detective powers were barely short of the marvelous and his manage- ment of refractory students became so weU known that many who had been expelled from other universities were sent to Union, and graduated with credit ; so that the college acquired the nickname of\ Botany Bay.\ Exp~lsions were very rare, and the sect·et police of the university was so competent that almost certainty of detection generally deterred the tnen frorn serious infractions of the rules. The government seemed to be based on the policy of giving an earnest man all the advan- tages. possible, and getting the indifferent through the course with the least discredit. What the doctor tried to do, was to make a ruan, when he found the material for one, and to ignore futile intellects. This was the schen1e of the ,education at Union at this period, an(t it rarely failed to find the best tnen in the cl~.ss and bring them forward. Outing, the apostle of fresh air and sunshine, of healthful exercise and exhilirating sports, defies, in its March issue, the conventi o11al aspects of winter and dispels its influence. Whilst other publications are rending the feel- ings with human slaughter in South Africa, it presents the peaceful landscape and the ways of \Big Game in Matabeleland,\ its forests, its flora and its fauna, with illustrations that ~ne a revelation. It follows the \Leaping Tuna\ in our Pacific Waters ; describes \ The Irish Wolf Hound,\ destined to play a notable part in ridding the Northwest of a scourge. Takes its golfing readers round \The Links of the Far West,\ its aquatic devotees rowing over \ The Pleasant Courses of San Francisco Bay,\ and its cyclists on an \ Easter Trip through France.\ Tells of the doughty deeds on track and field in \ Wonderful Athletic Perfonnances,\ gives a birdseye view of ''Match Day on the St. Andrew's Links of Old Scotia,\ and takes its heroine in fiction through a Siding adventure worthy of the title, \A Modern Cinderella.:''

TBE C0NCORD1EWH1S. THE ALLISON-FOOTE DEBATE. Philomatheans and Read, 1900, come off Triumphant. The Allison-Foote prize debate was held in the First Presbyterian Church the evening of • Washington's Birthday, and much interest was exhibited in the subject, \Resolved That an inheritance tax would raise a revenue more equitably than a tariff.\ The Philomatheans, who had the negative side of the question, carried off the honors of the evening, and the individual prize went to StephenS. Read, 1900. Edward P. White, '79, the new president of the Northeastern New York Alumni Association, William H. Hollister, Jr., of Troy, and Lang- don Gibson of Schenectady, were the judges. The real question of the debate seemed. to hinge on the proper interpretation of the term ''equitable.\ The Adelph.ic n1en ~ttempted to show that a proper use of the word in dispute would hnply a disregard of all sentiment con- nected with the two systetlls of taxation. Their opponents successfully refuted this argument, and won the debate on its merits. rrhe first debater on the Adelphic side was Andrew C. Fenton, 1900, who claimed that the tax of every man should rest on his own real ability to pay it. In this lies the real secret of the merit of the inheritance tax. The tariff, on the contrary, is based upon what the tax-payet· consumes. The poor man must pay as much for the articles he uses as does the rich man. Leopold Minkin, 1901, started the debate from the negative stand point. He admitted that the tariff has some objectionable features, but clain1ed that the inheritance tax is not and cannot be better in a single one of these respects. The inheritance tax violates the ~xioms of certain and arbitrary payment, while it at the satne time involves the confiscation of private property by the state. Clayton J. Potter, I 900, the second speaker on the affirn1ative, argued that the mechanism of any tax should be sitnple, and that a large cost of collection is unjust to the payee of the tax. The tariff involves a large outlay of money to collect it. He refuted the statement that the inheritance tax assails personal property by claiming- fhat as the state gives the individual the right to accumulate property, it has the unquesti()ned right to tax the transference of that property a..t his death. The inheritance tax, at the sarne titne, is free from all political entangle- ments, wibJle the tariff invites party ·difference and is con~tantly subject to change. Step hen. S. Read, 1 9oo, arguing on the neg~­ tive, said that the ,inheritance tax 1neans that 1t is a critn:e to get rich, and that the method is a decided injustice to wealth. He argued that wealth ,must be invested, and that a very small proportion of a 1nan's personal resources is not in constant circulation. In answer to the asser- tion that ~personal property constantly evades its tax, he claimed that the enforcen1ent of existing laws would remedy the defect. The inheritance tax takes away the desire to accutnulate wealth --the en<l of domestic economy. W. Dewey Loucks, 1900, the last speaker on the affin'1:1:ative, stated that the tariff is a relic of barbarist11., is indirect and an unknown quantity, while the inheritance tax is direct and its effect is well ]{nown. There is a strong tendency today toward the limitation of inheritances, and that tax is but an expression of it. It cannot be evaded ()f shifted, while the tariff is frequently evaded and always shifted. Willard Dayton Brown, 1900, the third speaker of the negative, said that the inheritance tax falls :heaviest on those who cannot bear it- charitable institutions. It could and would be easily evaded in two different ways-emigration to another state or country, or by the distribution of propet·ty through probate prior to the death of the person in question. The sutnrning up by the representatives of the two societies was mainly a repetition of argu- tnents already introduced. Arrangements have been made between the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Califor11ia for a dual athletic 1neet to take place just before the Mott Haven games. This year theTe will not be any dual meet between Penn and Cornell.

8 THE OONCORDIENSIS. THE ,S;OPHOMORE SOIREE. A Brilliant A.ffair Held in Memorial Hall. 1\he festivities of a memorable \veek at Union were brought to a close on Friday with the sophomo1·e Soiree, which passed off very suc- cessfully. Metnorial Hall, which had been a scene of preparation for a week previous, received · the merry c0rnpany, as they arrived. The decor- ations, wl~ich were on a large scale, consisted of . flags, an.d garnet and purple streamers, the colors of 1902., while a number of college trophies adorned the wall. The electric light- ing was ful'nished by the plant belonging to the college. The dressing-rooms, which were an itnmense i m provetnent over last year, were on the first bal~cony. Much anxiety had been experienced by the cotnmittee in charge as tow hat the weather con- ditions would be, and owing to this uncertatnty thorough. preparations were made for all possible conditions, and no difficulty was experienced in heating the building. The new floor, which had been dedicated at the Senior ball last cotn- mencement, was in excellent shape and a tnost welcome change frotn the crash of last year. The catering of A. L. Owens, of Utica, was entirely satifactory. Gioscia, of Albany, who was on ha11d with his orchestra., was in the best of spirits, and his rendition of all the popular waltzes and two-steps was fully enjoyed by all. There were twenty-four regular dances, with extras fi-equently interspersed. Owing to an unfortunate delay, dancing was not begun until nearly eleven o'clock, but from that time until a quarter past four it continued with only short intermissi()ns.

'THE CONCORDIENS1S. THOMAS L. JAMES' ADDQESS. Eloquent Eulogy b·y the Former Post- master General. . . \Abraham Lincoln\ was the subject of the address on Washington's birthday by the Hon. Thomas L. James, postmaster general under President Garfield. New striking ideas punctu- ated with bright, incisive remarks, combined to make it one of tnuch interest to the college audi- ence. Several years ago the faculty having in n1ind the stt·iking coincidence of the occurrence in February of the anniversary of not only the granting of the college charter but also those of the birth of America's two foremost heroes, decided to combine the three into a two days' recess during the latter part of the· tnonth-one day to be devoted to the discussion of some educational theme and the other to some topic of national hnportance. Dr. Raymond's explan- ation of this fact in his introduction of the speaker of the afternoon served to remove the first impression of the incongruity of the day and the subject. · A few people today consider that the discus- sion of Lincoln has been run into the ground. Mr. James, at the beginning of his address, ably refuted this statement. Lincoln has been the subject of an untold amount of study which is constantly revealing new facts, new thoughts, and new ides in regard to the Nation's Martyr. The la&t word can never be said of hin1, for his history is ever of fresh and absorbing interest. Lincoln was in very nature a poet,-not the san1e kind of an one as was Shakespeare, it is true-but yet one in the higher conception of the word today. He was a poet of the people. The homely anecdotes of his own creation which he used are only today becoming properly appreciated. His other great powers are only now being fully perceived and appreciated. The developed tnan of the backwoods pos- sessed to a remarkable degree the power of dis- cerning public sentiment. Months before Seward spoke of the '' irrepressible conflict,\ Lincoln declared in Chicago that \A house divided against itself cannot stand.\ When not certain of it, he waited for its developn1ent before action. The .Emancipation Proclatna- tion was delayed over a year until the time arrived when the ,president was sure of support. Lincoln always said that he followed public op1n1on. He did, to a degree, yet he intensified that opinion and always was a leader of it. The president's command of his cabinet, though finn was never ove1·bearing. Cabinet officers were treated with tact and a proper con- sideration. His courage was admirable when carrying out what he considered to be a right action. He viewed Edwin M. Stanton as the best man in the country for the secretaryship of war and though that man was of opposite poiitical faith, and in spite of the fact that Stanton had out- rageously snubbed hitn sometime before, the president appointed him to the office. Other men, opponents of l1is for the presidential notni- nation, were urged to join his cabinet. Magna- nimity, absolute lack of personal bitterness, were eminent characteristics of his nature. Praise that did not fully belong to him was always shifted to some other person. Lincoln was never obstinate, He always was ready to accept arguments of greater weight than his own. Emphasizing the Emancipation Proclamation as perhaps Lincoln's greatest work, Mr. James drew a valuable present day lesson from it. In ante~bullum titnes on most Southern plantations the industrial education of the negro was much superior to what he receives today. There is too much criticism of the white people of the South as the cause of existing conditions. Massachusetts is to blame as much for this as is Virginia or the Carolinas. The tendency in the South at present toward the abrogation of the political rights of the negro is not alarming. Doubtless they will be restored when he n~aches the status of true political comprehension. One great assurance of the restoration of the negro's political rights is the present inviolability of both his civil and property rights. The Ameri- can citizen's duty now is to aid the negro's education-industrial as well as intellectual-in every possible 111anner,

After the excitement of the freshman banquet had subsided, there ensued two days of recess, during which the students had the privilege of listening to two representative Americans, and the advantage has been appreciated, for the chapel was filled on each occasion. Charter Day and Washington's Birth- day, with the Allison-Foote joint debate in the evening, when the result of last year was conl- pletely reversed, were duly observed by all. A fit ending to this week of pleasure took place in the \Round Building,\ Friday evening, when the sophomores entertained their friends with one of the best soirees in the history of social events at \Old Union.'' THE LETTER printed in our last issue from au alumnus of over fifty year's standing, displays a spirit worthy of emulation. Many a graduate could well afford to bring more fully to the atten- tion of prospective college men in his preparatory school the adva.ntages which his alma mater offers them. But net alone in this is the letter sugges- tive. The sh.ort article on debati11g comes just at this time witb special force. We are always glad to receive unsolicited communications of any kind whatever. 'i'he question of debating as suggested by Mr. McClean's letter and the Allison-Foote debate, is one that should clain1 the attention of every student. The preservation of the literary societies, the oldest organizations in college, who have vied with each other in debate for more than a hundred yea .. rs, is of vital importance to the life of Old Union. It is earnestly hoped that the tneet- ings of these societies may be kept up with una- bated interest during the remainder of the year. Another inter-society debate would stitnulate interest. COMMENDATION FOR THE FACULTY. The Alumni Association of Northern New York adopted the following resolution : Whereas, The Alumni Association of North- eastern New York, at its annual meeting, l1aving in 1nind the best interests of Union College, and learning that the standard of scholarship main- tained in the institution today i& high, and is constant! y strengthened, and Whereas, We believe that such standard of scholarship is the result of the earnest, intelligent and constant devotion of the preside11t and metn- bers of the faculty, therefore, Resolved, That as an association we desire to place upon record our hearty cornmendation of the class-roon\'l work required frotn tbe students, and at the sarne titne express our hearty a ppre- ciation of the results of the work of the active faculty, and in this connection desire to com- mend to tbe consideration of the board of trustees of Union College the men1 bers of the faculty, becau.se of their intelligent devotion to the interests of the students under their care, and to advise that every consideration possible be shown t() the members of the faculty as to the compensation to be paid thetn for their services, having in tnind the financial possibili- ties of the college.

TllE · CONC·ORl>IENSIS. 11 CHAQTEI~ DAY EXERCISES. Instructive Addre.ss by Danforth E. Ainsworth. The one hundred and fifth anniversary of the granting of the charter to Union College by the State Board of Regents, was celebt·ated in the chapel, Wednesday morning by appropriate exercises. After the singing of college songs, President Raytnond introduced Hon. Danforth E. Ainsworth, deputy superintendent of the state board of instruction, 'vho gave an instruc- tive address on the educational system of the state. The speaker said in part : \The one phase of educational work which every one should understand is the great underlying founda- tion of the pJ.·imary institutions in the common schools. In r 795 the legislature made the -first appropriation of $r9o,ooo for common schools. At that time the rate of taxation per capita was one and one-half times that of the present day.\ Showing the tnoral advancement made during the course of time, the speaker said, that at that tin1e the secondary institutions were fostered by the lottery system, while the common schools were largely supported by the proceeds of the saloon. In 1869 the state legislature enacted laws, making the cotntnon schools free and open to all. During the past year the appropriations from the state amounted to $4,5oo,ooo, or one- quarter of the whole atnount expended for the maintenance of governtnent. The only state that approaches this amount of appropriation is Australia, vvhich is an interesting and remark- able fact. \Although the Australian's social standing is gauged by the record of crime, the intellectuality of that country is not generally understood to be of alarming irnport. She is the originator of the tna nual training system in public schools ; of the legal certificate of real estate, and of the ballot systern, which has been found to be the tnost successful system of ballot- ing ever instituted.\ Much has been said of tl1e proposed plan of unification. The proposition is, to bring all the school systems of the state under one depart- · ment, to adjust educational systems, and bring about order in the work. The voluntary school work should be separated from the state work. The common school systetn ought to be a function of the state, linking itself with the political functions of the governtnent. In de.aling with the question of politics, the speaker said : '' The man who deserves critic- ism is the educated n1an who finds fault with the politician. It is the duty of every citizen to take hold of the political n1achine and n1ake it what it ought to be. The ideal government is of the people, by the people, and for the people. Politics do not bring ruin on tl1e country, nor is the political boss the greatest evil to the state. What ever evil may test in them can be removed provided every one takes up his burden of citizenship, no matter in what department of work he may be. The n1en who are drawn by popular suffrage from all voca- tions make the best legisiators.'· LITERARY NOTES. Senator Albert J. Beveridge in his famous speech in the United States Senate, told one side of his experiences in the Philippines. The other and more personal side-wl1at he saw and heard of The American Soldier in the Field- he will tell exclusively in an early number of The Saturday Evening Post of Philadelphia. The American Monthly Review of Reviews for March discusses the war in South Africa in its various phases, the Hay-Pauncefote treaty, the Puerto Rican tariff, our situation in the Philippines, the steamship subsidy bill, the Ken= tucky disorders, Governor Roosevelt's adminis- tration in New York, the approaching Presi- dential campaign, and many other timely topics. \John Ruskin: Poet, Painter, and Prophet\ is the subject of an elaborate character sketch; and President William Goodell Ft-ost, of Berea College, Kentucky, contributes a study of those interesting people, the mountait1eers of our Southern States. These are some of the features of an exceptionalty strong number.

THE CO~CORDiENStS. '~MAN STARTS AROUND TH.E: W .. · O~LD· . \j FOR A NEW YORK DAILY. Perley Poore Sheehan, '98, was on the hill Sunday on a flying trip from the Metropolis. After his graduation he assutned a position on the New York Mail and Express until last sum- ' n1er, when he changed to the New Yorlt Evening World, and although with the latter periodical for such a short time he has now been sent on a trip around the world in the interest ofb..is paper. He ]eaves for Cuba today, where he will meet his fatnily and practice his Spanish, which he has kept up since his college days. From Cuba he will go to Paris where he will be one of the exposition reporters until October. He then goes through Spain, especially the Southern portion, and from there to St. Petersburg, where he will attend the exposition. After a tour through Russia, he will strike eastward to China and Corea, where he expects to do his n1ost particular work. l-Ie thinks the Eastern question is centering there, and hopes to be able to report the international difficulties of this interesting section of the globe. His plans are only embryonic at present, but he expects to be gone five years. His primary object in travel- ing is to consider the peoples from a sociological stand point, as he has kept up his interest in this study while in New York. While in college Mr. ~heehan wrote tnany short stories and poems and carried ofl' a number of literary prizes, and his writings have been widely copied. He has always been interested in journalism, having worked for a local paper while at hotne, and winning his way to the position of editor-in-chief of The Concordiensis during his college course. A musicale was held at the residence of Gerardus Srnith, '79, Wednesday evening under the auspices of St. Mary's Guild of St. George's church. A quartette consisting of Shelley, 'or ; Barrett, 'oi ; Robinson, 1900; and Slack, 'o1 ; and the Freshmen Musical QJ.tartette consisting of Boudetnan, Finch, Bowler and Garretson, rendered selections. DQ. T~UAX AT VESPER SE~VICE. Dr. Truax gave an interesting talk Sunday afternoon on the judgment of Pilate, according to Matthew 27: I I. He depicted the two types of character; Pilate, surrounded by all the insignia ofgreatest power on earth, and Christ in lowliness,. unattended. Pilate was a weak- minded man, just the reverse of Christ so far as all goodness and morality were concerned. Pilate alone, because of his high position, could have saved Christ, but he yielded to his own selfish interests and has his own reward. He was a flatterer and a wheedler, and in every respect a weakling and a coward. He was troubled by a guilty past, and did not feel free to have a character examination. Christ, on the other hand, was innocent of crime, innocent as regards Cresar and Pilate. He it was who calmed the mob against Pilate, a short time before. Dr. 1~ruax then spoke of the duty of Christ- ians, of Christ's forgiveness of Pilate, and the humiliation of such forgiveness. He drew still further the contrast between the two men. Pilate was a worldly man, but Christ the oppo- site. It is one of the evils connected with the political principle of \ success at any price\ that conscience is debauched thereby, and com- mercial values given such prominence as to seetn to outrank moral ones. The upright politician needs to guard the more carefully against the danger of making compron1ises that involve serious injury to character, and that, by traversing eternal laws of social well-being, involve, ultimately, the ruin of his party too. While the itnpulses of youth are in nature gener- ous, and easily kept right, the price of lasting success is eternal vigilance in maintaining the supremacy of the unselfish over our selfish interests. The address closed with an appeal to the students not to sacrifice character ~ith a view to attaining honors in college. There is an inclin- ation for the intellectual and physical natures to become so developed as to shut out the spiritual and moral. \Remember the best in the world today is fed frotn Christ's life.\ Christ is in the midst of our sufferings and shares ~ur hardships. \ . l
