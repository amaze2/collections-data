Eghiyan, a graduate of Union Cluett & Sons makes a man throw himself into any mov~ment, any activities that tend to widen the sphere of influence of his Alma Mater, or that may redound to her credit. A great d-eal has been spoken and written about college spirit, hecause it has been recognized that without this student-college feeling, an institution cannot long endure or prosper. And that is why we are again brining this subject to the light, not with any alarmist motives, but from a reluctant conviction of its ap- plicability to Uniori. There has been for several months, in fact, almost a year, a decided and dangerous slump in the old traditional Union spirit, in that feeling of loyalty and enthusiasm for everything con- nected with the college that is an es- sential to its well-being. This lax- ness of sentiment has manifested itself in all the various branches of extra- <mrriculum activities, in athletics 1 as weH as journalistic and literary circles.

Af- though this communication does not directly apply to Union, inasmuch as we already have an R. 0. T.

ENGINEERS PRESENT P~TITION TO McDANIEL Resignation of Engineering Head Calls Forth Strong Protest from C. E.'s. The reported resignation of Pro- fessor A. B. McDaniel as head of the Civil Engineering Department has called forth a: protest from underclass engineers and from the Junior C. E. men. At a meeting in chapel yester- day of engineers, a petition requesting Dr. McDaniel to remain at Union was formulated and wilt be presented to President Richmond, Dr. Silas Brown- ell,. chairman of the Board of Trus- tees, and to Dr. Alexander Duane, class of '78, asking them to use their influence in persuading Dr. Me Daniel to remain. About eighty-five engi- neers from the general and civil courses have signed the petition, a copy of which was sent to Dr. Mc- Daniel today. The petition is as follows: Dr. A. B. McDaniel, · Professor of Civil Engineering, Great thinkers of the past have at- tempted to explain the universe in terms of a few or even of a single etc: ment. Always have men been im- pressed with the idea of unity of all things. But it is also true that the diverslty of things has appealed to others more strongly than has unity. Such men-let us calf them pluralists -assert that the others, or monists, can in no satisfactory manner account for the existence of evil. \Monists endeavor to ascribe a completeness to the universe. They do not attempt to describe its won- ders but they seek to appreciate and understand it by a higher experience. namely, by religion. Now, it is the tenet of all higher forms of religion that God, the creator of the universe. is perfect. Hence the universe itself must be perfect. This is the point where the pluralists, especially ameli- orists, direct their attack. \To them the existence of evil is :1 denial of the perfection of thing:;. They maintain that man and Goo are part- ners in the annihilation of evil. anrl that infinite time is req uirerl fm the completion of this work. In other words, life is a progress toward per- fection. \They consider not only the mora 1 D Uni~~ College. . . evils, of vice or crime, hut also all ear tr.-:-We, as engmeenng stu-! manner of pain, poverty and rlisease. d~nts of Unwn College, have learned 1 .
