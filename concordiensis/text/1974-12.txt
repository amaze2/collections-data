The FCC found W AMCs complaint to be unfounded. SUNY at Albany wanted the 90.9 slot, but American Studies by JUDY DEIN The .main problem of the American Studies p.rogram at Union, it seems, is that it lacks cohesiveness and a true sense of direction. This complaint was voiced by several American Studies majors a.t a discussion with two well-known teachers and scholars irt the field of American Studies, Richard Slotkin from • Wesleyan University and Susan Conrad from Dickinson College. These outside faculty members, guests of David Stine back, Acting Director of American Studies at Union, were brought here to help determine what changes are nece&sary to make the present American Studies program more interesting and worthwhile. On Saturday, November 23, Mr. Slotkin and Ms. Conrad led a series of workshops, one including both students and faculty involved in the American Studies program, one with just students, and one open only to faculty members, to discuss the .pros and cons of Union's program. Slatkin is an Associate Professor of English at Wesleyan University with a Ph.D. in American Civilization from Brown University, who ·has taught .courses a·s varied as \Afro· Ame1'ican .Literature,\ \American Mythologies and Popular Culture,\ \The Frontier,\ and ••American National Epics.\ He is the author of Regeneration Through Violence: The Mythology of the American Frontier, 1600..1860, which was nominated for a National Book Award in History this past year. Susan Conrad is an Assistant Professor of American Studies at Dickinson College with a Ph.D. in American Civilization from the University of Texas. Her thesis is entitled ''Intellectual Women in 19th Century America\; she has taught courses in American fiction, creative writing and the role of women in American Culture; and her publications include articles on American Studies as a discipline. A major attempt to redo the existing program at Union is presently underway. With the coming of David Nye, Assistant Professor of American Studies and Union's first faculty member hired as an American Studies instructor, it is hoped that many more courses dealing specifically with American Studies will be offered. An \Intellectual Survey\ course, running for two terms freshman year, was suggested by the two visiting professors and got a great deal of support from Continued on Page 3 their application was returned because of technical errors.

Communications should improve on campus as the station becomes an even more important source of information. Once the initial station is built, there will be a good chance that the coming years will bring an even more powerful station to the college. If the money was forthcoming, Union could have a station like WRPI that would cover the capital district. Currently, the programming at WRUC is more complete than at the majority of college stations. With its long hours of broadcasting and variety of music, the station could become· widely listened to if the power were increased. For the present, though, the hope is for FM broadcasts· to start during early spring term. · Some signal tests will have .to be run before rock takes over, but at last the signal will be worthy of the station as a whole.

Unfortunately, this is not the case. This fact is evidenced by the supposed need to show the trustees of the college that Union students do, in fact, desire such a facility. This mistaken notion has been advanced by the student trustees who are now sponsoring a student fund-raising drive. The goal of the drive is not, ostensibly, to raise money, but rather j:o show the Trust~es that \students really want the facility and would use it.\ The funds raised by this ' I' drive would amount to no more than one-twentieth of the proposed cost. This initiative presupposes- that the trustees are not only unaware of student needs, but also that they are not cognizant of what could make Union a more attraclive place for prospective students or applicants. We are confident that this assumption is false, and are therefore compelled not to support a measure which is sponsored by students who believe that the only way to convince the Trustees that students desire a college ce~ter is through monetary support. If the benefits of such a project are as self evident as the sponsors of this fund-raising drive believe, a check for $ 10,000 placed in the hands of the chairman. of the Trustees will-be, indeed, quite worthless. JMS buckley's law Colleges all over the nation are feeling the effects of the so- called \Buckley Law,\ and Union is no exception. This law, sponsored by New York State Senator James Buckley, allows students access to any and all files that the colleges possess regarding them (providing the student is over 18; parents may see files of minors). · Many colleges feel that the retroactive nature of the law is unfair to high school counselors and others who wrote recommendations under the assumption of confidentiality. To open these parts of student files, and expose these people to legal action would be unfair, it is reasoned. Meanwhile, many faculty members at schools around \the country feel that this access and legal responsibility would dilute the recommendation process to meaningless proportions. Union has not been forced to implement a policy yet, for the college has 45 days to respond to student requests. One student has 'requested to see his file, and the college has until January 3 to respond. The college has refused to allow him access, and will only do so after legal action. Concordiensis hopes that the college will adopt a policy similar to that of Williams, where all material dated after November 19, the effective date of the law, will be available to students. Concordiensis feels that to release material entered in the files under an understm\~ding of confidentiality would be unfair. However, the students' right to protection from libel must be upheld, and aU material entered after that date ought to be entered with the understanding that it will be available to students. No one need fear the threat of libel: if a non-libelous recommendation cannot be written, then none ought to be written at all. my million --b,uc·ks . ' BY PETE SOBOL after ·W.H.

To the Editor: One thing that bothers me and l feel may also bother a large percentage or the campus, is smoking in the classroom. Being a non-smoker, l. do not enjoy having to inlule air filled with smoke. It is very annoying and distracting to be sitting next to someone and have them light a cigarette. Often. my eyes water and I get an overall sick feeling .in addition t6 hating the smell. I feel that smokers to an extent infringe on others rigltts when they light up. I realize, though I never smoked, that it may be almost necessary for some to have a cigarette at some point during the hour or two of class; I am not · advocating outJawing smoking in the classroom_ I feel, however, that non-smokers rights might be observed some-what ·more by the professor settii1g aside an area near an open window where those desiring to smoke would have to s·it. This is dotu! on airplanes and very effectively all<JWs smokers to partake of their habits without forcing them upon others. Sincerely, Woody Lauer wruc sports Editors, Conec:.rdiensis: It has come to our attention that a serious problem exists in the Union College community. As everyone knows; the win-ter term would be incomplete without the excitement that is generated through the exploits of our basketball team. Monday night's. stellar performance against a tough Middlebury team showed the superb quality of ball our 'team is capable of playing. This Friday night Union takes on Hartwick College, which in this year's preseason coaches poll has emerged as the top-ranked team. Of course, it would be nice if the same student support that is generated in our fieldhouse could . be seen against this top opponent as well as aginst all other teams we face on the road. This, however, due to ·the academic pressures and problems which emerge from travel to such distant schools as Tufts, C.W. Post, and Harpur, make this support unrealistic. We of the WRUC Sports Department would like to make the excitement of these away contests a reality for all of the Union College community. Broadcasting away games however, is a novel and costly endeavor. Due to this uniqueness proper funds have not been allocated to allow this to become feasible. The game Friday night; because of its importance, will be heard on WR UC, 640 on your AM dial, starting witJi the pre- game show at 8:00p.m. With the funds now available, this game could be our .. first and only broadcast of this season. However, we would like to inform the students of Union that we will do everything possible to try to bring you the remain(Ier of the away schedule next. term. l'hank you. Alan Mann Arnie Hiller Mitch Singer · St;eeri,ng by ·TED LEISENBERG On Monday evening November 25, 1 sat in on a meeting of the Union · College Steering - · . ~cbmmittee _ ·ill- ~Strauss Lounge. <My~ intention_ was· to voice an · opinion oiL the· :controversial Pli~.G. The meeting was scheduled to convene at 7:00 and at 7:10 fhere were approx,imately six members 'of the committee present. Since it takes at least nine votes to pass a resolution things were sta.rting off on a bad foot. · The first topic was a constitution presented by a non- affiliated student, d~aling with a s;tudent exchange program. His main goal w:as to .get a ratified constitution so he· could have concrete groupd to Work on. The committee proceeded to ask questions· that were already answered and treat the student as though. he w:as looking for large funds to back vague expenditures. Since there wasn't a majority the ·constitution couldn't be voted on and I assume the, whole proceedure will have to be repeated later. After this business was over the next topic· dealt with electing a chairman to · the \Conduct Committee\. This was followed_ by an investigation as to what this committee was that the Steering Committee itself had created. I attribute this lack of knowledge to absenteeism. The question of whether or not a certain freshman is qualified to chair the \Conduct Committee\ was discussed and the meeting degenerated into a battle of personal viewpoints. This is when l left. From what I saw Monday, November 25, we not only lack a · governing body that cares about attending meetings, but even if they did, they probably wouldn't achieve much. I guess the 'members of the Steering Committee have forgotten all those promises they made about hard work and · ·soun'd representattion. churchill Journalist, painter, historian, world leader - each role was ~ut one aspect of Winston Churchill's life. · The man who led and inspired England during the dark days of World War II was also the- man who wrote a book entitled \Painting as a Pastime.\ To commemorate the one hun- dredth anniversary of Churchill's birth, Schaffer Library at Union College has mounted a special exhibit that focuses oh the diversity of his accomplishments. For the most part, the display represents a . sampling of Churchill's extensive literary output. On exhibition are first edition volumes of books he authored, grouped to reflect the various stages. t;>f his career ... Also displayed are collections of speeches Churchill made as prime minister, exhibition catalogues of his paintings, and some of his historical writings, . such as \Marlborough- His Life and Times,\ and \A History of the English-speaking Peoples.\ A little black book in one display case shows Churchill's handwritten comments on the Desert Army's campaign in Egypt during World War II. The book, entitled \Ten Chapters- 1942 to l945t was put together by Field Marshal B. L Montgomery, , In 1967, Harold Blodgett, a Union alumnus, donated his collection of fil'st edition books by Churchill to Schaffer Ubrary. M.ost of the items in the present exhibit are from this collection. !'he exhibit, which was arranged by library bibliographer Ann Seemann, will be on display through December.

' smokin' lo the Editor: One thing that bothers me and I feel may also bother a large percentage of the campus, is smoking in the classroom. Being a non-smoker, I do not enjoy having to inhale air filled with smoke. It is very annoying and distracting to be sitting next to someone and have them light a cigarette. Often my eyes water and I get an overall sick feeling in addition to hating the smell. I feel that smokers to an extent infringe on others rights when they light up. I realize, though I never smoked, that it may be almost necessary for some to have a cigarette at some point during the hour or two of class; I am not advocating outlawing smoking in the classroom. I fee I, however, that non-smokers rights might be observed somewhat more by the professor setting aside an area near an open window where those desiring to smoke would have to sit. This is done on airplanes and very effectively allows smokers to partake of their habits without forcing them upon others. Sincerely. \\.. oody l.a uer wruc sports I· d it or~.

My intention was to voice an opinion on the controversial PI RG. The meeting was scheduled to convene at 7:00 and at 7:10 there were approximately six members of the committee present. Since it takes at least nine votes to pass a resolution things were starting off on a bad foot. · I he first topic was a constitution presented by a non- affiliated student, dealing with a s.tudent exchange program. His main goal was to get a ratified constitution so he could have concFete ground to work on. The committee proceeded to ask questions that were already answered and treat the student as though he was looking for large funds to back vague expenditures. Since there wasn't a majority the constitution couldn't be voted on and 1 assume the whole proceedure will have to be repeated later. After this business was over the next topic dealt with electing a chairman to the \Conduct Committee\. This was followed by an investigation as to what this committee was that the Steering Committee itself had created. I attribute this lack of knowledge to absenteeism. The question of whether or not a certain freshman is qualified to chair the \Conduct Committee\ was discus~ed and the meeting degenerated into a battle of personal viewpoints. l'his is when I left. F wm what 1 saw Monday, !'-iovember 2.5, we not only lack a governing body that cares about dttending meetings, btlt even if they did, they probably wouldn't achieve much. I guess the members of the Steering Committee have forgotten all those promises they made about hard work and sound representa ttion. churchill Journalist, painter, historian, world leader - each role was but one aspect of Wins ton Churchill's life. l'he man who led and inspired England during the dark days of World War II was also the man who wrote a book entitled \Painting as a Pastime.\ ro commemorate the one hun- dredth anniversary of Churchill's birth, Schaffer Library at Union College has mounted a special exhibit that focuses on the diversity of his accomplishments. For the most part, the display represents a sampling of Churchill's extensive literary output. On exhibition are first edition volumes of books he authored, grouped to reflect the various stages 0 f his career,· Also displayed are collections of speeches Churchill made as prime mmrster, exhibition catalogues of his paintings, and some of his historical writings, ~uch as .. Marlborough · His Life and rimes,\ and \A History of the English-Speaking Peoples.\ A little black book in one display case shows Churchill's handwritten comments on the Desert Army's campaign in Egypt during '1\.orld War II.

This course would familiariz;e students with basic concepts and people who have been important in determining American va:lues and culture. Additional in-depth studies of the individuals and ideas would take place in the appropriate History, English, Political science, or Philosophy classes, What is American Studies? American Studies is a cross- d.isciplinary approach to studying American history and society. 1 t is the jdea of those involved ifi the field that one cannot gain a complete understanding of the nature of any historical period or culture without studying the philosophy, economics, literature and politics as well as the .events of the time. New Courses Offered Until this year, the only American Studies courses at Union were the required Sophomore and Junior seminars. rhe rest of the requirements had to be filled by courses ifl the English, His tory, Economics; Political Science, Philosophy and Sociology departments. However, now that the American Studies dep11rtment has a full time faculty member, additional courses are being offered. 1'hey are A.S. 10 ~ \Individualism in America,\ and 1,\.S. 2() ~ \The Emersonian Tradition,\ both these courses are being taught by Professor Nye. · Several students complained tha.~ they could fill the present requ!rements without t::Ven studying ~ll aspects of one time period. Consequently, they felt ~that they were learning a little bit If everything with nothing 'to tie the ~courses together. Most ·studentS··' suggested stricter programming, such as offering the history and literature of the same period in the same term, and having the history courses offered in sequence.

The topic for the Junior Seminar next Fall has not as yet been selected. committee formed A committee is now b·eing set up to re-evaluate the American S.tudies program. It consists of two professors, David Nye (American Studies), and Terry Weiner (Sociology) and two students, Judy Dein and Cindy Sheppard. Hope fully, through further discussion with American Studies majors and faculty, a more cohesive and rewarding program will be created. lJ nder the new )y enacted hrnily Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, exer.pts from the first section of which are printed above, Union College, an institution receiving. federal funds, must by law make all files containing personal information available for inspection by students over 18, and by parents of minors. The college has forty- five days from the date of request to assemble and present the files to inquiring students. Failure to do so will jeopardize .the college's chances of receiving future federal financial support. This law is quickly becoming a most controversial issue. \The number of parents and students seeking access to student records has been smaller than anticipated,\ according to Dennis Kaufman, .staff attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group, Inc. (NYPIRG). To this date only one Union student has requested to see his file, (the request was placed the day the act became l:aw, November 19, anQ.. the college has until January 3 to supply the relevant information). 1 \The American Council on Education, along with other groups, is attempting to delay the implementation of the act. J.A.D. Shupe. Director of Admissions. has stated that he has met several times with President Bonner to discuss college policy concerning the act. The college policy thus far is that the admissions office will not g-he Pu/J/~estau(ant? ·Dear lJniolfStudent, . .

The college appears to be challenging inquiring students to .take them to court. Shupe did not rule out destroying all files as a possible solution to the problem. Shupe perceives the retroactive nature of the act to be a major problem. He objects to students seeing guidance counselor recommendations written before the enactment of the law on the grounds that such an action would sever the agreement of confidentiality between the high .school counsellors and the Union College admissions office. In clarifying this statement, he said that the admissions staff reads all high school counsellor' recommendations before each student is evaluated and all unsubstantiated charges made by a counsellor (i.e. ••this student is suspected of dealing drugs in school\) are either stricken from the report or are followed up by communication with the counsellor requesting that he either substantiate the charge or withdraw it. Shup.e further .stated that confidential guidance counsellor reports are instrumental in determining the qualifications of less than 200 applicants a year. Sex Continued from Page I preceded the trustees' most recent action. · • rhe committee, compnsmg Union administrators, faculty and trustees, took a look at coeducation an<i male-female admissions ratios from several different perspectives. Recent educational studies and data from other newly-coeducational colleges were analyzed. A major point made by the committee in its final report was that maintaining sex-based quotas could have an adverse effect on future enrollment at the college and on the quality of the student body. Faced with fewer potential applicants, a college has two alterrtatives decrease enrollment in order to preserve selectivity, or lower admissions standards to keep enrollment levels the same. Neither .action has been taken by Union, the report says, largely because of the school's shift to coeducation. In fact, enrollment has increased from about 1700 in 1970 to almost 2000 this year. : E.CFM\· :::·s;oerd~;;;~i~~ • • . . a cl!h•er •• i NAT'LMEDDS !

·~·. . Union Hoop Beats On Middlebury 78-63 by HANK BERNSTEIN and BRIAN TUCKER The Dutchmen H oopets opened the '74-'75 campaign in their usual winning ways with a relatively easy 78\63 victory over Middlebury Monday night. It was a sloppy game at times - plagued by many fouls and turnovers. Yet, this is expected this early in the season, especially with all the new faces on the squad. team high 8.6 caroms per contest. Great things are again eX'pected of Goog. Backing up Charlie are Sophomores Al Walker and Larry Hughes, both starters on last year's · Freshmen squad. Walker, a forward last year, is used mostly in a reserve center role. A good she>oter and offensive player, Al is much qUicker than most centers and is strong for his 6'4\ frame. Larry Hughes; only 6\ shorter than Kareem Abdul Jabbar who stands T 1\ has a good turn-around jumper and can supply board strength. - ' . ' As pre-season opened this year, Coach Scanlon, District II Coach of the Year last season, found himself having to fill the starting forward slot vacated by Chuck Abba as well as the valuable reserve roles left vacant by guard luke Dillion and swingman Tom Combs. \We lnok good, at least on paper ... The Fish is back. I hope his knees hold up ... he's worked so hard,\ remarked Scanlon early in October. The Fish, of course, refers to Junior forward Joel Fisher, sidelined all of last season with a knee injury. Fisher has dedicated himself to playing again and has earned Abba's starting assignment. An excellent shooter and strong rebounder, Joel is playing- with the confidence he had before the injury.. Right behind Fisher is Sophomore Pete Meola. ''I wouldn't hestitate to play Pete early in a ballgame,\ commented Scanlon. The 6' 3\ 190 pound Schenectady native is strong and moves well on offense. Balancing out the front court is \Bad Bad Leroy KeUy,\ who seems to get better with each game. A starter on last year's club, Steve was the second leading scorer with an 11 point clip per game, coupled with 7.5 rebounds. Rounding out the forwards are Junior Bones Viniar, also coming off a recent knee operation, and Sophomore Clete McLaughlin. When 100% physically, these two should add much strength coming off the bench. The Garnet suffered a setback of sorts with the loss of guard John Denio for the first handful of games due to injury. As everyone knows, including his 17 brothers and sisters. \YEO serves as the Garnet's Secretary of Defense. Thus, with()ut Denio, much more responsibility falls on quarterback Bill Carmody. As good as Mody was last year, he appears even strongerthis season. . The crowd gives the Union defense a #anding ovation. photo .by L.N. Radllak At center, mainstay Charlie Gugliotta again anchors the team. Last year Charlie led the Dutchmen with a very impressive 17.6 scoring average (shooting 54.5% from the field) as well as a He always displays an innate first tour shots for six of the court sense and can often times Garnet's. first eight points.

Kevin, in this He was replaced by AI Walker, third year of varsity hoop at Continued on Page 7 Union, is a steady team player, who makes few mistakes and who generates much enthusiasm in his reserve role. Gorman, too, is a steady player who has the potential to be a team leader, although he lacks varsity experience. Kearny, who may be the quickest guard on the team, can sparkle on defense and is also a fine ballhandler. In the home opener, Carmody again set the tempo early in the game connecting 011 tllree of his Everling Ousted From Helm Gerry Everling will not be reappointed to his post as head coach of football at Union College. Union had completed a second successive 2-6 campaign this fall. , Everling, 31, had an overall record of II wins and 23 losses in four seasons at Union. His best year was 1972, when his team won four and lost five. U ilion President Thomas N. Bonner said the search would begin immediately for a new head coach to boost the Union football program. The Dutchmen have had only two winning teams in the last 18 seasons. \We are grateful to Gerry Everling for his dedicated work under difficult circumstances,\ Dr. Bonner said, ''but we have to make an effort to bring football up to the quality level we expect in all Union programs. , \The recent records of the soccer and basketball teams prove it can be done. \I plan to take an active part in the search for a new coach,\ Dr. Bonner added. \We'll be looking for ·an experienced coach with a record of success in a program built around scholar-athletes of the kind Union wants to attract. Recruiting is the key to success in this context, and we will be especially interested in the r.ecruiting experience of candidates for the job. LeRoy skies \Very frankly, we are looking for a man who can turn this situation around and give us a successful program within the NESCAC guidelines.\ NESCAC is ,,he ll•team New England S m a U C o II e g e A th I e·t i c Continued on Page 7 I Pl-a.y.ing The Fleld Once again this Holiday Season, Union's basketball team wiU participate with R.P.l., Siena, and Albany State in the annual Capital District Christmas Tournament. Unfortunately, in scheduliQ:g the event, no concern has been shown for the plight of the players competing. The only ~riterra seems to be; \Ho·w can we draw the biggest cro'-Vds.\ As a result, players have been forced to practice over Christmas in order to be prepared (for what is unquestionably; a big tournament) for the opening night game, 2 days after Christmas. Christmas·is a sacred day for most people. It is . .. the one day of the year when families are able to overcome time, distance and obligations ancl get together to share the joys of a holiday, in many cases a holiday, and in all cases t.be joy of being together again. Union is an institution of higher learning. We supposedly can recognize the need for the .setting of priorities· in our lives. We are members of NESCAC, a confere.~ce dedicated to insuring that academics remain uppermost in the varied goings on of the college community. We · feel i~ . hypercritical that priorities are not recognized in · one instance, i.e., forcing a team and coaches to sacrifice Christmas at home in order to represent the school to the best of their al>Hities; '-Vhile they .are in ~another, i.e., c::urtailing post · season participation of sports teams in the name nf academia. We urge the athletic directions of the . schools involved,to remedy this situation. Surely a Christmas tourney! would be just as successful as a Holiday tourney held the weekend before Christmas or the first weekend in January. * * * * Another Union hoop season began on Monday night with a victory over Middle;bury. From all_ appearances it should be another exciting and successful campaign. Two factors lead us to such a · conclusion. The first was the performance of the· . basketbail team. The second was the traditionally · enthusiastic support of the U-CoH student body. The fans, led by the ever present psych section~ are not just there watching a game; they are there supporting theit: team. We hope this support will continue throughout· . the year with the .additional backing of both faculty · and staff. .S w V'l
