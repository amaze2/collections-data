Some of the boys wete · afraid that if they should b0lt they would lose their money's • worth. It wa.s a rather small way t@ feel especially when the •. faculty had ~o g~nerou.sly provided an •extra week of scholastic · entertainme11t this year.

There was but one thing left which might help things out, and that was the fact that sorne dastard had ventured to offer for sale, tickets to this Roman holiday.

A careful study of the ballots cast reveals a predominance of double-dealing by many of the groups engaged. In the past it has been the policy of the powers that be to ignore complaisantly even the possibility of fraternity politics here.

Rut, class committees might be appointed by the faculty in conjunction with members, of the senior class, the method abolished only a few years ago. Such a procedure would, l10wever; imply the student incapable of 1·esponsible judgment. A :new code, em- bodying clean shaight-forward dealing and demanding publicly announced tickets, would do much to promote good feeling. s. v. s. FEL<I!OWS!

That has been definitely · decided at the Athletic board meeting Wednesday night. But· whether a hockey rink win be built on the cain pus is still urtdeter~ · · . mined. Manager Van Boesen and Coach Larrabee lmve sub-: rnitted a report on the probahle cost of erecting .a rink on the ' field now used by the freshman football team for practice. The •. cost, as made out in the re:p.ort, is not exorbitant. The question • · . now before the Athletic boar,d is where the money is to come from fm· such .a project. The Athletic budget has not set aside , tnoney for a rink Clearly an .added tax on the Student ·Body would not he app1·oved by the college officials who claim it is abeady high enough. . · Aho:pe for a rink on the campus is not without some material·· support, however, for it is rumored that an alumnus, unsolicited, · has offered to help out fhrancia,lly. This report if true cei·tainly wi1:1 dear matte~·s considerably for the sextet. One other que·stion to be decided. is where a rink can best be • placed on the campus. The proposed freshman football field is : considered by the baseball interests as detrimental to their sport; · it would spoil their outfield. We suggest that the N ott Street field be considered. FACULTY RULJN,G PREVE.NTS TIICKET SCALPING ~ The decision of' the faculty to take away the stick of candy it has been giving th undergradua tcs the past few years, in the· fonn of a half holiday during the football season, has stopped a miniature ticket scaiping \racket.\ With the announcement that 200 choice seats f01· the Columbia game were to be on sale at the gymnasium, forward-looking undergraduates hurried to • buy as many as 70 at a time. But Director Bruce has returned the tickets to New York in order to prevent &ny seeming encour- agement on his part to break the faculty ruling. The would-be ticket scalpers may he used .as indicators of the many who intended to see Union play the Lions. Pe1·haps · the faculty will take a new stand on games played away in the future to this extent: that just as teams are allowed a definite number .of away games, undergraduates be permitted to attend a definite number of away games a year. The undergraduates purchasing tickets for an away game from the Union managers would be excused, all n(:)t going would attend classes. One ex- cused absence a season is not excessive. A NEW LEADER FOR LA.CROSSE U nian will miss the services of Coach Clifford when the . lacrosse season comes ai!Ound. The announcement that Clifford's : services cannot be secured because he has removed to New York is sincer~ly regreted by many on the campus. . Director Bruce announced at ·the· Athletic board meeting that a successor to Cliiford will be named at the fall meeting of the lacrosse candidates next Monday. The intention to have regular fall practice for the Indian game is laudable as Union .. has made a fine rec01·d for itself in this. sport in the Inter-. collegiate Lacrosse association. Early practice will give the t! new lacrosse mento1· an opportunity to s:ize up his available material and plan a successful campaign :for spring. TOUCH-FOOTBAI.,L The addition of touch-football to the intramural program is indicative of the prompt response of the .Athletic department to. the wishes of the undergraduates who wish to participate in intramural sports. The schedule released by the undergraduate manager of intramural activities is comprehensive and will bring all the: groups on the campus together in friendly rivalry, while affording an excellent opportunity to play in some form athletics. Clock golf sets have been ordred .and the tournament will begin .as soon: as they are received. The billiard tournament is on. Thus we have two semi-passive sports counterbalancing the · more strenuous sport of touch-football to permit every one to play something. UNION. COLLEGE SCHENECTADY, N. Y •.

But back or it all must be the ability to organize men, money, material and machines. The telephone executive must coor· dinate his .machine before he can run it.

It has diluted the curriculum in a way that is detrimenta:l to the best interests of education, and it has burdened the col- leges with too many teachers of nonessential subjects. Fewer courses, given by more competent and better-paid inshuctors, would be of advantage to all concerned, and not least to the makers of the college budget.\ From a strictly financial point of view, this diagnosis, sweep- ing though it be, is convincing. Education is a costly prablem. The more divergent it becomes, the greater will be the priCe which it can demand. The incompetent instructor IS a human failing wl1ich can never be entirely eliminated.

Every fraternity ·wishes to keep its pledges from losing thei1· scalps and fraternity spirit demands that one do everything possible to keep members of the organization out of danger, but the way to do this is· to make sure that every pledge knows his Alma Mater wh~p it is required. The pulling- of freshmen out of line creates an exempt, privileged class among the first year men and defeats the primary aim of hazing, the instillation of a lasting respect for the college's customs and traditions, a respect necessary to the maintenance of true college spirit. Each year the upperclassmen and sophomores bemoan the .fact that the newest class IS too impertinent, that its members do not speak up when they meet Union men, and that the tra- ditions of the old days are becoming meaningless, and yet the practice of helping frosh to evade the rules continues. The yearlings cannot he blamed for their lack of respect for tradition, for the upperclassmen, by deliberately violating it, set an ex- ample that the new men, unused to the ways of college life, unconsciously follow. Those of us who have been here long enough to realize the respect and love due to ald Union are the ones responsible for· keeping the spirit of the college alive and it can be done only by strict .enforcement of the campus ru1es, by impartially subjecting all freshmen to the same danger, and by making the fear o:f punishment so strong that none will dare to disregard the regulations.

The trend of the modern era 1s, however, one of specializa- tion. To narrow a curriculum to any one type of art or science would rob the college of its personality as a college and reduce it to a kind of technical school. To limit the number of courses which a curriculum may sopport, on the otl1er hand, IS to fence m definitely the field of education for the college. \Vithout some means of expansiOn to keep abreast the times, the average college would soon lose its function as an institution of advanced learning. Inasmuch as :new or more detailed subject matter marks advancement of civilization, the addition of courses to a curriculum is an indication of the college's progress. s. v. s. -~q;:dNSON'S GIFT S~OP J\ One Six Seven Jn7 Street --------------------~~-------- ~l~ (Next to Mohican Market) r.==~~=====~=~~~~' \;::::::==========::=::; H.

Among them were Kingston, Hyland, and · J, Finegan of last year's .sterling e1even, and the Uni.on bench was crowded with others who came up to talk :with the team and the coaches between periods. Although the entire Columbia team played .good ball, to those in the stands the Lion eleven seemed composed primarily -of twa men, · Kumpf and Li:flander. When these two were taken out of the game the. Blue and White's' ground-gaining dropped to almost nothing and Union came witihin a minute or .so of pushing the ball across for a touchdown. AI! seen from the stands, the game .pi:'esen.ted more drama than any other in years. Fifteen thousand spectators, about evenly divided in their loyalty, watched a lighter eleven, do.omed to defeat, put up a wonderful fight in a vain effort to stem the Blue and White tide. It could not be done and at last Union shifted to an aerial attack irt an effort to score and with a might born of des-peratien tool.;: the ball down the field.

The women for the most part wore something in either' garnet or red and this made a striking picture.

SOLVING THE MAN POWER SITUATION In oi:.det td co~pete on e;ven terms with it~ bigger rivals, Union·.:rfi~st ha\\;\~ m~:n:e ·m~n power for its .athletic teams. This can be brought 'ab~nt ·ill. two ways, either 'by increasing the enrollment or by cutti~g. down the number of varsity sports. The increase in enrollment would take away that which makes Union the desired educational center that it is. Therefore cut- ting off some of the varsity sports is necessary. ·The sports cut could continue 3iS intramural activities. A committee is to be appointed to study the situation. It is a commendable fact that the undergraduates will be permitted to have a committee of their own to sit in with the facultv committee while the' investigation is made. A conclusion favo;- able to both the S~udent body and the fasulty should result.

Leader in the oackfield, could stop the open attack of Dartmouth which rolled tip a 44 to 0 score. Roadwork has not agreed very well with Vermont. The Green eleven traveled to the Metropolitan area two successive Saturdays and lost to Columbia, ~0 to 0, two weeks ago and then were routed Saturday by three Princeton teams 50 to 0. The reserve power of the Vermont team slowly gave. out against the Tiger whiGh scored increasingly heavier with second and third string men. Failing to make the points after touchdowns cost R. P.

Rochester ope:ned the season against Alfred rather poorly althoi;J.gh winning 7 to 0. Straub prevented a scoreless tie in the last part of the fourth period by breaking through for a touchdown. 'l'he passing machine of Williams, consisting of Howe as sender and of Williams, Ashby and Langmaid, receivers, worked well against Middlebury and, gave the Purple a 20 to 0 victory.

If the proposal that Union College build a hockey . rink could be agitated three o!l:' foul\ years. there. is small doubt that at the end of that time every undergraduate and Athletic Board mexn ber would be so well informed of the facts that n0t one who is at all open ta reason would hesitate to ap- prove it. \But it has been said that mistinderstan'aing travels miles. while truth is putting on its shoes. In the present case the im-. pression has gone ahout amon,g a few that the hockey rink proposition will somehow cost the college heavily. With more time to spread the facts and figures this misapprehension could be dispelled. But as the matter stands now there will be some to shake their heads ~doubtfully at such a proposition. A com.., mittee has been appointed to consider the case and at the same. time to consider the abolition of this or some other sport. With these. men the opinion seems to p1·evail that the students are overburdened with :atlil.etic taxes. A dollar apiece from each stu.dent would more than pay for the erection of such a rink and what undergraduate ~ould not remain hom'e from Proctor's on~e or twice to· help rnJI.intaiu th~ sport which hll<s produc~ some. of Union's best known athletes. ''A m.an who wishes to do the ._·ight thing c~tn not follow mis- · info;J;~med opinion. Tl1e far sighted man will trust to time to uphold him in the .cou,rse his own judgment approves. 'Better· that than to incur lub11;e r~proach for 3j failure to do the right thing now. But no .one will have to wait for posterity to give him credi.t. A vote for the hoc:k{)y rink will mean in~tant ap- plause frmn thinking students in the college. The lack of sup- . port the sport has received id the past is due not to i-tself hut . from the conditions under which it has existed. \It the :Sof,trd decides to abolish hockey or not to erect a rink, even at the ·cost of the student body, it can not justify·· itself in th.e light o·f co;mmon sense. Future classes will look · hack oil the action with sorrow and a·stonishment. R. W.

Perhaps some of our educators are wTong when they frown ujlon the offering of athletic scholarships hy TUESDAY, OCTOBER 16, 1928 · coUege adminisbations, and alumni groups. It may be that such a scholarship :is the material expression of an appreciation for that excellent 'eombination. To call it dishonesty would be INTERESTED? The average Union College student during the four years of his educational isolation shows little interest in national poli- tics or foreign affairs. Except for those events which directly affect some one or more of his studies, he is content to confine his grasp of the activity of present-day civilization to a cur- sory I'eading of newspaper headlines. This procedure he finds doubly advantageous. First, it enables him to assume a know- ing look when he is drawn into conversation with his elders. And second, it entails no appreciable expenditure of time or effort. A study of the formation of the Smith-For-President and Hoover clubs on the campus sho,vs specificaliy how indifferent the Student Body is to the majo1· national issue of the day. Similar clubs were organized in other small colleges two or three weeks before these made their appearance here. We read with interest the names of the few who claim membership to one or the other of the clubs here and wonde1· · iiust what per cent of the Student Body they constitute. The mighty few have. proclaimed an extensive program. But such a program will materialize only if there is a sufficient number interested to keep alive the political feud.

To those who claim that the crowd is forgotten. by the play-· ers in any sport, ,we waRt to mention something that happened Saturday. Colgate had three harriers up in front all the way of the six :tnile race and was making the strongest bid in their history to break the four year winniug streak of the Garnet. The Union captain was leading the star Maroon l1arriet, Cum- mings,. by a scant•margin and Rathmann of Union was twenty yards behind the latter. 1 But in sight of hm:rte and the cheering hundreds in the stands, both Rothmann and Heath pulled away and headed the three Colgate runners to the tape. The MarooD. runnet·s could easily have been in front had they beeR given such support as was given the Union harriers, for they finished fresh. INDOMITABLE GR~T K,EEPS UNION IN FRONT Not one of ;the passengers in the long caravan that foHowed. the Garnet harriers Saturday was disappointed with the contin-· nous fight that took place over the whole distance of the six mile course. The .. two vet.et·ans, Captain Heath and RothmanD, had the indemitable grit to keep in front and fiDish in front: in a race as thrilling as any of the Dick MerriweH novels. To come frem behind a:i:ld win is always dramatic and Coach Bruce's runner's did that very thiDg trying to win. Colgate has an- other year to wait before trying to gain a cross country scalp from Union. The most grueling ~f all sports, cross country makes up for its monotony in producing the most gritty of athletes. It is hard enough. N. Y. U. will be the guest of Union next Saturday. The Violet harriers showed their heels to Lehigh in a manner that indicates that the green Ul).ion team will have a slim chance to win. N. Y. U. with a veteran team nearly outran the Garnet championship aggregation last year. Union's ouly ch~nce to defeat the Violet harriers Saturday is the well known Bruce strategy that has killed off some of the best harriers in dual meet competition.· It is a question, however, if the present material can be whipped into the excellent shape necessary to run according to Coach Bruce's system. Segal and Aussicker are both ailing in their legs and there are none to take their places. SCRAPPING UNION SPORTS The more we watch Union sports in action the more we are. convinced we have too many of them. Union just ha:s not the· man power necessary to keep up such .a big list of varsity sports. Its intramural program could easily take care of those sports that ought to be scrapped and allow more men to go out for the more successful teams. Student opinion will soon be can- vassed to determine which sport or sports the undergraduates want to strike off the varsity calendar. Serious consideration should precede any action on the pat·t of the voters. Things to reflect upon while making up one's mind to vote should include, availability of material, good coaching, success. of teams in the past, publicity drawing factor of the s:port, and cost of maintenance. Messrs. Rogers ~eet Company announce that they have discontin• ued the practice of sending a rep- resentative to visit Union. It is felt that the students at UnioR can be more completely served through the larger stocks ot merchandise in our New York and Boston stores, and to that end the services of our Shopping Service Department are proffered.

It was decided to buy the canes early this year so that they could be ·carried at football gtan1es and on other suitable occa- sions during the college year. In the past they have been bought late in the second term, when they could be U~;Jed only for a few weeks. At the meeting Saturday it was suggested that the members of the class also buy blazers, but the mo- . tion was defeated. Mohawk National Bank 216 State Street ••A.

If then the supply of man power falls short of meeting the demands of all the various athletic activities, either one·of two factors prevails : ( 1} the trend of American youth is in a strictly scholastic direction; or ( 2) the college is iosing ground in its competition with other institutions of learn·ing. The first is obviously untrue in an age which gives lVorld Series prece- dence over all else during one week or more of the year. And Union's progress during the last decade has excited favorable comments from all parts of the collegiate world. Several reasons for the change might be ventured, but their proof is beyond our Baseball ~--------------- Sw1mmmg --------------- IJ'or a TAXI Call ~lt:ela legitimate scope. Union College has always prided herself that her athletics were free from commercialism. Sports for the sake of sport alone naturally infers that a. sport should depend fo1' its exist- ence upon student popularity. It is the student wlJO keeps alive the spirit for which the sport was founded. Man power has never been scarce at Union in sports which have retained their natal code. Therefore, the student's opinion should metit seri- ous consideration when necessity decrees the abolition of one or mo-re sports. '·· One might argue that the success which a sport has met in competition should govern its continuance. Of equal value is. the contention that success in competition is entiTely a matter. of ca1'iher of competition. A skillfully selected schedule in- variably insures a successful season. · On thts page, The Concordiensis is printing a h~llot whereby the students may indicate which sports they favor abolishing.

THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1928 ;::::!:::::::::::::::::::::::::!::::::::5:::!:::::::::::::::::::u:::;:::;::::::::::::::::::::::::u5::::u::::::::::~:::::;:::::n:::::~=:~ ~ !~ The Campus Sportlight m ·sEa:::==============~====::;:::::!:::::;:::::::::::::::::;=~================::;:;::=================:::;:::::::::::::::::::::::=========~========!i~ ·GRJDMEN STARTI.NQ· ALL OVI;R AGAIN TOMORROW What has happened tl:lus far during th~ football season has • been for.gotten hy the Union football team. The worko1:1ts we · have witnessed, des:pite Coach Leary's han on all onlo0kers at. practice, indicate tha.t for the first time this season the Garnet: win have a uni6.ed fighting machine ot eleven parts that will • send Vermont home loaded down by their-fourth straight loss: ..oJ the year. · '\iVhen a team loses, the coach is tl1e first oRe to bear the' bru.nt ·of the attack made by the rgoters.. Coach Leary has not· escaped and it is interesting to hea;:r some of the comments. vVe are contemplating an a,rticle on these criticisms we have heard so we must tefrain from mentioning any of them here · at this time, jast to save our thunder. But ·we do want to remark here, whether it is Coach Leary's fault O:l' not, the . Union team wiH play tomorrow with mot'e pep and vim tha-11 at any time this fall and the only thJ.ng that might alter' this, will he the poor backing of the undergraduates in the stands. · It is heartless to play to an empty theatre, say the actors, • and football teams play in a listless fashion to an empty stadium. As the actor is inspired by an appreciative audience so the . footbalt player senses the tenseness he has produced in the crowd ·and does his utmost to come through favorably. Crowd your friends into Alexander field tomorrow and prac~ tice up those rusty yells that you will want in fine shape for the annual holiday with R. P. I. a week following. CAN THE HARRIERS DO IT TO N. Y. U. AGAIN? For the twentieth time a team coached 9y Harold Anson· Bruce will race one tutored by Coach Van Elling in ~ross country. Nineteen consecutive times Bruce's men have won from the Violet. Von Elling has long waited for the oppo~·tunity he thinks is afforded him thjs season. He not. only has a tried veteran team but also has for opponents a compar.ativ.ely .green group of harriers to contend with. In addition, he has a thun- derbolt, in the form of the Olympic star, Phil Edwards, that he will use but once this season to jnsure victory. · ·. One doesn't have to be a close student of Union athletics to see that Coach Eruce doesn't admit defeat pl,'ior to any race and trai:i'ts his men t<> win. · Captain Heath and Rothmann are the only two veterans and they !).re competent to meet the high class of competition 'that N. Y.· U. affords. But it i; the third and fourth and fifth man that will decide whether Union or the Violet will win tomorrow. Defeating N. Y. U., tomorrow will boost Union's stock for retaining the championship of the Middle Atlantic States Col- legiate Athletic Association in November. CUT THE SPORTS AND INCREASE THE SCHEDULES The enthusiasm of the undergr~duate body has not been unified for any sport in late years. Perhaps 'the large number of sports on the calendar has divided ·the interest of the Student Body to such an extent that each sport suffered. With the committee already appointed to consider the curtailing of the number o! minor sports, thought should be directed to making the major sports and minor sports remaining, arouse more in- tez:.est. One good wa.y is increasing the number of contests for baseball, basketball, track, and for the remaining sports. An- other way is to make the schedules more dramatic by climaxing the season with the R .. P. I., Williams, or Hamilton games instead of putting thes.e games in the middle of season. • Messrs. Rogers Peet Company announce that they have discontin- ued the practice ·Of sending a rep- resehta:tive to visit Union. It is felt that the students at Union can be nrore completely ser\v;ed through the larger .. stocks of merchandise in eur New York and .Boston stores, and te that end the services of our Shopping Service Depa.rtlnent are proffered. Sa111ples of our su.its and over• coats will be sent on request, or we wjll be glad to write ~n detail about our furnishings, hats and shoes-or even send the merchan- dise themselves on approval.

Which reminds us that one is not enthusiastic abou~ one's coll~ge unless the college is in the p~hlic eye~ The R. P. I., Williams, and Hamilton game if played in Chadwick Park, Albany, would draw the fans of the whole Capitol District, receive attention everywhere, and arouse enthusiasm as few other things will. It would become a social event and an athletic event. Do we hear a. whisper of \commercialism\? Are we not collecting admission for the games, have we not :increased the seating capacity far in excess of the amount needed for the undergraduates? Playing at Chadwick Park the two or three important home games of the season would do !the job a bit better, that's all. We Jearn that Hobart was played in Albany i'!IIIIIQt six. yea,rs ago.

Maloney TGESDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1928 Pl:BLICITY 'Vith the reorganization of the Press Club, Union College has the opportunity of overcoming one of the grc'ittest hanili- caps it has had for the past few years-that of insufficient pub- licity. A step has at last been made in the right direction and credit is due the officials and students of the college who have made it possible. There are few institutions of tecognized intercollegiate standing which have not sensed the importance of the power of the press long ago. It is now deemed an essential of the college program, both educational and athletic, to have a. live and alert publicity bureau sending o1:1t every available bit of information concerning the college. 'l'he Union Co1lege Press Club has been functioning well in considei·ation of the fact that the members sacrificed time and effort in thrs service without an office or headquarters and without remuneration. '\Ve are all familiar >vith the criticism o.f alumni, especially ' . . . ENU . ::···s .. :copytn . . . .

Although there has been no noticeable sign of it among the students, the secret has finally leaked out that Union is scheduled 'to p:la,v R. P. I, in this game (football) i1ext Saturday. If there are any .students interested in witnessing this contest they are asked to report to Dean Garis and file · .. with him a statement o:f their intentions. Haste is not imperative .as there will be accommodations for as many as twenty men. Guides will be present to explain all the technicalities and to point out which group of eleven men Is the lJnion team. The studeNt body is requested, meanwhile, to continue its policy of silence and disinterest~dness . Very sincerely yours, A weak attentpt at humor, if you like, but nevertheless a fairly accurate picture of the lethargic state into which Union's spirit ha:s fallen. The energy of the undergraduates is poured into the childish, prep-schoolish chaos of the Monda.y morning student body meetings and there it remains. The yokelry of.· the college have discarded conscientious loyalty and in its place has substituted shouts of \Graft \c1ucks\ for the freshmen, and imbecilic guffaws of laughter. It would be more logical £or the freshman to ridicule the \jellyfish\ asscmbeled beneath them, to tJ.Ssail the spineless ones who have failed to create a· real football spirit on the campus. There are, on the other hand, many undergraduates who really love Union College. {The yokelry ~re now grinning at the \softness\ of that statement.) And they art' the men who are, with their deep sense of loyalty for every Union team that goes on the field, carrying the others along. It remains with· the unburdened to assmne their rightful duties, and to help put· Union on a competitive level with i1er opponents. A sincere, spontaneons spirit is needed to defeat R. P. I., Williams, Rochester, and Hamiltot1. It will also have a better moral effect on ·the members of the various athletic teams which travel to distant cities for American.

We agree with the editor in his ballot, for we are con- vinced that there are too many sports on the calendar. In the winter we have three sports, of which one is outdoors, hockey,· and two are indoors, basketball and swimming. Swimming :Qas a haTd. go of it and basketball cannot get enough materiaL Swimming ought to ,go. During the spring we hav:e five sports. Over 155, or a little less than one-fifth of the college, are necessary to keep up these sports with. sufficient material. · Track and base hall are the majors. :Baseball has suffered from lack of material. Lacl'osse has the Tequirments of a ma.j or also and therefore drains on· strength of both baseball and track. Golf· and tennis require little and get on famously with that little. They ought to stay. This leaves eithet one of the majors or lacrosse to be curtailed. Track and baseball are spotts played in all the ptepatato:ry schools and men come trained in them to college. Lacrosse is a new college sport and needs expert coaching and more material than baseball. With material already low for other sports and the mattei· of a coach a. difficult situation, lacrosse ought to tal\e its place among the intramural sports. A MATTER OF VIEWPOINTS We have no room for Brann's letter reprint it elsewhere on the sports page. harp on undergraduate support whenever tently. m this column and He asks us why we a team loses consis- ·w11en an undergraduate judges the result of his college team he feels that the team played for him and that his duty and others not playing had been to back the team with moral support. Rarely d0es he qt1estion the sincerity of the players on the field and he therefore turns to himself and to his fellow spiritual sup- porters for the cause of defeat. An average tearri should 'vin at least every othet game. He usually foi~gets the coa:eh's responsibility.

The names printed theron, we later find, are identical with those of the .. 11c1dy-cl<:cted officers .of the first-year class. From which w~; ~onclude that organized pQltiics l; an effective agency m t~i; pi'J,l•suit of honoi·s and therefore an inevitable campus insti- in.ttioil. Deals ha YC been the vogue of the campus smce the inaug~ uratiou of lib<:raJ student government. They have of necessity been somewha, t hidden from the public eye to conform with cer- tain ideals of sbtdent goYcrnment which haYe been preserved for many decades. \Vhen circumstances beyond the control of those engine.crrng deals determine only partial success, a polite feeling of dis trust invariably crops up between students who formetly had been more than chance acquaintances. 'l'hen, too, there 1s no method of detection of the candidate so un- scrupulous as to enlist his support in several competing deals to insure 11crscmal success. One of the greatest evils of the present campus political system is an outgrowth of the multi- . plicity of supposedly secret deals. lfhe l!'tte innovation, we beiieve, is a step in the right direc- tion. The n~a.1mer in which it was presented (it caught the stu- dents unawares at the \polls\), although insuring success, did not create an aboYe-board impression. The result 1s, however, ah indication of the efficiency which such a system can effect. Logical dcvd()pment of the idea along the lines of more public- ity and inc1~eased universality will greatly 1·elieve the existing chaos of campus politics. s.v.s. PROMINENCE OR NOTORIETY? The quickest way of bringing an educational institution to the attentioli of the public is through the success of its ath- letic teams. Freshwater colleges, sprung f1~om nowhe1·e within the last twenty-five years or so, have attained national promin- ence ahnost ovei·night through the fact ·that theiF football teams have beaten those of bigger and older institutions.

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1928 90 PER CEN'r DISINTERESTED The sports abolition ballot which was printed m a recent issue of The Concordiensis was accorded a typical undergraduate Y'<'('f'ption. Y otes were received from less than ten per cent of !he student body. Despite the specific wording of the ballot to the contrarv, a number of voters, apparently convinced that the present state of affairs was unchangeable, indica ted no prcf- erc>nC'C' as to which sport could mo,.;t easil:v nnd most effectively be abolished. The votes l?ast indicate no unity of opinion regat·ding which activity C'an best be dispensed with. A number of students saw fit to divide a sport into its component parts.

WHAT A DIFFERENCE A FEW BANDSMEN MAKE It took the whole Union section by surprise to see a uni- :fol'Illed (at least by their Turkish headgear) Garnet band march in perfect formation around the R. P. I. gridiron while playing stirring music. :We have been missing such a band at om pre~ vious contests. A feeling of pride possessed us as we saw the attention it was 1·eceiving from the 5,000 spectators that ci·owded the stands. But despitethe fiue music, wE! were a bit jarred to see that Ted Mauger had to use a plain wooden stick to lead the bandsmen. That stick 1·esembled no baton we have ever 1>een before. Dh·ector Bruce, who was responsible for the pres- ence of the band at the game, also did not like the stick and has promised to remedy the situation. We hope he gets Mauger something better before the vVilliams game Saturday. SOMETHING TO GLOAT ABOUT Alumni gloated; undergraduates were alive with enthusiasm~ for once most of the student body were in an event at one time united by a common spirit and emotion. vVho will soon forget who saw the howling parade of Union men downtown singing lustily that song about R.
