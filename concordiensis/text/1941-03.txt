Meyer, the editor of the journal \Metal Fin- ishing,\ before the Ea>tern New York Sectian of the American Chemical Society in Butterfield Hall at 8:15 this evening. \This subject will be very in- teresting,\ ~aid Dr. E. K. Bacon, A.esistant Professor of Chemi::try, \because Dr. Meyer will speak of chemistry in. terms of engineering. It is particularly timely because of the part it play in national de- fense.\ Dr. Meyer graduated from Yale in 1928 and then accepted the po- sition as chief chemist at Sargent Miss Ruth Weber asserted that she liked the dance; how- ever, she thought \How do you i·ike Union men?\ too dangerous a question to answer. Miss :\1artha :\-iacElhose descri·bed the dance, Union and Union men as \Fine beautiful, and 'Okay'\ In that order, Miss Ann Eldridge and Miss \Vedlake :;aid they might ·be quoted as liking the dance and Union men, while :Miss Dorothy Pat·ci liked the decorations.

H is.lop Responds To Walt Whitman Loss of Individuality Lamented in Poem Given in Chapel Today A 180-line poem in blank verse entitled, \Letter to Walt Whitman.\ was resd in Dai·ly Assembly this morning as one of the series of fa~ulty American Faith Jectm es The poem was an answer to Whit- man's \Ballad of America\ express- mg the effect of modern civiliza- tion on the possibilities of the real- ization of Whitman's prophecy. :Mr. Hislop addressing ·him.self to Whitman, promised that he would relate a song of present-day Amer- ica. \I hear it in my corner· of the land compounCed out of men and fr.ctot ies, names from maps, from billboards, from barnsides and radio, fl om newspapers, from thea- tres, from the crowd,\ Mr. Hislop said of the song. \It's a new song, Walt: I hear its downbeat every- whet·e, one dubious tune we sing het·e, in this valley, in a11 America\ Lamenting the fact that the \var- ied carols\ of Whitman's day are being beaten into a single mold by the pressure of modern society, Mr. Hislop said that \two sprawling symbols\ of Whitman's .prophecy were left, the Mohawk river and the valley. The valley towns, however, are losing individuality as they echo raddo truths, molded by \a thousand sponsors\ Mr. Hislop went on. The radio's voice sings the song of com- fort and the song of wealth, he said, and, like Alladin's genie, will serve equally the fool, the wit, the saint or the thief. \I wonder if we build America in seri!e unity, may not Jose each other,\ Mr. Hislop concluded. At the end of the speech, a lo.ud- speaker in the rear of the chapel could be heard blaring orders to the students in the voice of the \Level- ler\ symbolizing the forces wt:lch destroy our individuality. ----0---- Cowley Acknowledges Recent Compliments and Company, New Haven, Conn.

They were John Ruskowski '41, William Edwards, '41, Roger D. :Marshall, '41, and Edgar Fisher, '42. Winston Saunders, '41, accompanied the group on the trip at the sug- gestion of Dr. Ligon. The conference was highlighted by addresses by Dr. Henry Pratt Fairchild of New York University and Mrs. Katherine Hepburn, moth- er of the stage and screen star, who spoke \In Defense of Birth Con- trol.\ Dr. Fait·child addressed the conference on \The Challenge of Mat l'iage,'' in which he declared that the fundamentals of marriage have remained the same although the factors in marriage have changed and assumed \multitudin- ous\ forms. Hear Noted Cartoonist The parley was also addressed ·by Aram Scheinfield, cartoonist, auth- or and student of genetics. who gave a tslk on \You and Heredity.\ :Mary Beard, noted historian, spoke on \The New Folk Lore of Mar- riage\ and Dr. Harry Elmer Barnes sociologist and newspaper columnist, spoke on \Marriage in a Changing World.\ Four roundta·ble discussions were held on various topics, including the place of the Church in mar- riage and mental adjustments in marital life. These discussions were led by prominent leaders in the vat ious fields relating to the dis- cussion topics. As an added touch, a debate was held between merr.bers of the Wes- leyan team and representatives from Mount Holyoke College on ··Resolved: That Woman's Place If in the Home.\ Most of the delegates felt that the Wesleyan team up- holding the affirmative had tt:e bet- ter of the argument.

Dr. Ellery, who is at present the National Pt·esident of the S;Jciety of the Sigma Xi, has long held the view that science should turn its attention to what the efforts of i science mean to society. Most 1 meetings of \Scientific ~ocieties con- ; fine their discul:lsions to advances : made within specific fields. This I conference will be almost unique, in its attempt to obtain a \broad • view\ of science in its relation to man. Long Considered by Ellery I A conference such as this, which 1 will attempt to bring the discmsion of science back to a unified charac-' ter similar to that which it held · before the days of specialization, I has long been considered by Dr. I Ellery. The presentation of the' symposium will represent the cul- I mination of much effort on the part of Union's beloved ex-Chairman of the Division of Science and Pro- fessor Smith, the secretary of the Symposium. Dr. Fox has been named Hon- orary Chairman of the Sympo::ium and, with Mr::. Fox, will be host at a tea served for the members of 1 the Symposium on Saturday aft-1 ernoon. 1 Outstanding men in the field of · science from several of the nearby i colleges have agreed to serve on ' the committee which is planning the Symposium.

Albany Champs P·rove N·o Match For Ka.ppa Sigs Phi Gams, Runners-up Here, Nose Out No. 2 State Five at Capital Union proved superior to Albany State Teachers' Col'lege in intra- mural basketball Saturday as a new athletic series was inaugurated with games here and at Albany. State's champion and runner-up teams both took it on the chin from Garnet fives. Kappa .Sigma. undefeated Union champion, took the lead at the· Etart and more than doubled the score of CoUege House, State cham- pion, winning, 32-15. This game was . played in Alumni Gymnasium. Sim- ultaneously Phi Gamma Delta, run- ner-up Union team, was nosing out Bruhlaker-Avilon-Robbin dormitory, State's second-place combination, by a 29-25 tally. The Kappa Sigs had beaten the Phi Gams, 12-9, .for the Union title in the final Friday. College House scored seven of its 15 points against Kappa Sigma in a third quarter spurt. The Kappa Sigs limited the Albany quintet to four points in the first quarter and two in the second and fourth pe- riods. The Kappa Sigs held a 9-4 lead at the close of the first q uar- ter and were ahead, 18-6 at the half. State's representatives ehifted to a man-for-man defense in the third quat'ter and held Kappa Sig- ma to two points for the period, while tallying seven themselves. They trailed by only 20-13, as the final session started. The Dutch- men turned on the heat and tallied 12 points in the last quarter to win with ease and remain. unbeaten. Walt Breed of Kappa Sig took scoring honors with nine points. Graves had five to lead the losers. l'hi Gams Have Trouble Though they led most of the way, the Phi Gams got a real argument from Brubaker-Avilon-Robbln over at State. The boys with the long name fought all the way. They were behind, 15-11, at the half and the Union cagers nursed this mar- gin to the end in an exciting tilt.

Psychology T opi' Of Scien(e Series March, Ligon, Chillrud Give Views on Subject In Fourth Roundtable Three members of the Psychology Depa-rtment were participants last Saturday afternoon in the fourth :'lri<>nrf' Roundta-ble of radio presen- tation over Station WGY. Dr. John L. )!at C'h, rhaii man of the depart- mPnt. and Professors Franklin C. Chillrud and Ernest )!. Ligon were heard in last SatUl'day's broadcast. Dr. :March acted as informal ~hainnan of the ·similatly informal discu~,;ion in which the three pro- tessorti discussed their respective fields of Psychology. Dr. Ligon, whose work with regard to Child P::;ychology and .Character Develop- ment has gained considerable 1 ec- ugnition, and Dt. Chillrud, whose principal work has to do with the factors in the Psychology of Edu- ~ation. each spoke at some length on problems in their fields, with special emphasis on the modern psyC'hological ~ituation as contrast- ed with psychology from its earliest beginnings down through the intet- vening years. Dr. :1-!atch traced the effects of ihe p,;y~hological school of Behav- iourism on the psyc-hology of today, oiS W<'Il 3$ the important £>ffect Of 1 h<> transition whieh took place when psychology changed from a smt of \philosophy\ into a full- fiPdgt>d ~cienct>. Both of these im- pm·tant changes took place during thP beginnings of the ··modern\ pet iod of psychology, a:t the turn uf the century. Concerning the !at- tel of the two, Dr. )iar-ch said, in part, \The present day psychologist ts a scientist, not a philosopher. Science discusses only subjects a·bout which W<' can really discover something by experiment Ol' other- wise. I think the giadual disap- pearance of the philosopher-psy- chologist was an event of fir::;t-rate 1m pot tance.\ ModPrn MPthods Professor Chillrud, in his brief discussion on modern educational psychological methods, indicated the one great new principle which has r<'volutionized the educational field duting the ·past decade. This has been the emphasis upon organ- ization, that is, the insistence that the whole is more than the sum of its parts, as applied to this partic- ulai field. \The project-method of study is an activity of some reason- able extension,\ said Professor Chill- rud, \including a variety of part- activities relating to some cential pU!·pose is typical of the organiza- tional point of view. Present day · Pmphasis on larger units of instruc- tion in many fields of study also appear to ·be definitely in line with this shift in Psy-chological study.\ Of hs work in the laboratory with child psychology, Professor Ligon said, \The popular 'I. Q,' notion of chal'acter analysis is not altogether as important as is usually consid- et ed. Actually, in our own work we tabulate 59 traits, only two of which relate to I. Q. The variety of the tt·a:its they are designed· to measm·e will give some indication of the rapid growth of the field of these personality tests.\ DAIRY PRODUCTS WM. GREEN JR.

He said that only on occasions was he able to ·obtain American newspapers altlwugh ·he could J.isten to any Amet kan broad- casts. \The way in which we obtain most of the current news is by listening to Ame1 ican broadcasts, for ·our nE'ws is stereotyped.

We hope not! We want to see many of those whose social year consists of but two dances, the Interfraternity and the Junior Prom, at the class of '43 dance Friday night. The freshman dance had every thing but the attendance in its favor. The orchestra was exceiient, the .floor well waxed, the com- pany pleasing. People ~uppo~edly in the know tell us that the sophG- more dance promises even better things than the freshmen offered last Saturday night. To y0u who do not plan to come we say \don't let the numerals '43 scare you. This is to be an aH- · college dance i·n the truest sense of the word. You will find members of your own class there and of the other three classes in college. Won't you be there?\ * * Letter to Judd Grey Dear Judd: This year's Concordiensis staJf has striven for accuracy, complete coverage, and full availability of the paper's columns for all campus functions. We feel obliged, there- fore, to take exception to state- ments claiming that we have fail- ed in these functions when such statements have no factual basis We feel that two statements in your well delivered and otherwise very enjoyable chapel talk on Wed- nesday were of this latter nature. Instead, as you stated, of two sto- ries on the Freshman Dance ap- pearing in The Concordiensis, four stories were pt·inted: namely, in the is~ues of January 31, February 18, February 25, and February 28. All were front page stories. As may be seen, three of these stories appeared in three of the four issues preceding the dance. The Ol;lly reason that there was no 3tory in the fourth issue was that our reporters were told that none was available. We withheld edi- torial comment on the dance until the issue directly before it, not only because that was the proper time to editorialize, but also be- cause experience of former staffs had shown that large items in the last issue would aid final ticket sales and door sales which usually \put over\ these small dances. Sincerely, The Concordiensis Staff * * Parking Problem Parking behind North College has become an extremely difficult job this year due to the unprec- edented number of cars owned by residents. We have seen automo- biles, left in the driveway when the parldng lot was full, blocking the exit. At other times we have noted cars parked on the walk and in the grass yard. Several suggestions have been made which might alleviate this condition. Some have suggested that the cold frames and lighting standard on the north side of the road be moved so that the road might be widened to include a three car parking space. Others have suggested that the grass yard be paved for use as a parl1ing space, as is the case behind South Col- lege. Of the two ideas, the mov- ing of the cold frames and light- ing standard seems most logical to us because it involves less ex- pense and would not spoil what little beauty there is in the yard. * * * Bridge Tournament We have chronicled the cham- pion bridge playing of the team of Mr. Dog and Norm Diedrich in other columns. Their skill in beat- ing different combinations repre- senting certain fraternity and neu- tral groups as well as the winners of the Skidmore round-robin have suggested an intrafraternity - neu- tral-faculty round-robin tournament for this campus. Teams represent- ing interested parties might meet for an evening of bridge once a week with different fraternities or neutral groups playing host. An entrance fee, which would provide a cup for the winner, could be charged. Then there is the possibility of bridge lessons. We have heard many students express Interest in learning how to play bridge. Les- sons, costing approximately six for $1, with Skidmore partners, might well be the answer.

PROFESSORS STANLEY ANU THATCHER IN PLANE chosen. · Reporter Inspects CAA A·eroplane And Has Torn Troosers To Prove It 80 Voices To Be Heard Approximately 80 voices will be heard. Skidmore expects to send about 40 and the personnel of the Glee Club numbers about the same. The Skidmore Chorus has already made one appearance on the cam- pus. Last Sunday they sang in chapel while the Glee Club was in There is no complaint about·~·------------­ having aeroplanes in the basement of the General Engineering build- ing, especially if the aeroplanes don't fly. It seems to us, however, that if there are going to be flying machines for ambitious students to climb around, the rough edges on the pilot's seat should be filed down before they are encouraged to climb in and pull the wires and other gadgets that abound the cockpit of any aeroplane. The aeroplane we have reference to is one that now reposes in the basement of the General Engineer- ing Building, free and open to in- spection. According to Mr. Robert Stanley, Instructor in Civil Engi- neering, the plane was loaned by the Haven Flying School, situ- ated at the Schenectady Airport. The plane has seen actual flying during the summer session of the C.A.A. It has been loaned for the edification of Union students and the use of the ground school of the present session of the C.A.A. Destructive Instrument The instrument of destruction is called a Piper Trainer and to pro- pel it is attached a 50 horsepower Franklin engine. At first we were a little skeptical as to whether the whole thing was actually a flying machine or the skeleton of a whale. Of one thing we are sure: the edges are too sharp- and our pants were torn. The .jdea of the skeleton, we were told, is to show the Students just exactly how an aeroplane is con- structed. The framework, the fab- ric, the dope, aluminum paint and the regular paint are shown in succession. Tlie othe1\ purpo~e of the honey affair is to show how the wires work. For the aeroplane we are grateful, for the defense program, which the machine is aid- ing, we are also grateful; but for the ripe; in the respective trousers of one reporter and one photog- Tapher, we feel a genuine sorrow. We feel, further, that at least the sharp points should be filed down, or a sign hung on them. 0 Class of 1944 Loses $44.40 on Annual Dance Seventy-seven couples danced to Larry Audette's music at the an- nual Freshman Dance, last Sa:tur- day night, according to the statis- tics released by the Free;hman Dance Committee. However, the double seven did not prove to be a lucky number for the dance, as it was revealed by the final tabulation that the Fresh- man Class took a loss of $44.40 on the affair. Cornelius Dande:-aau, Ticket Committee head, announced that the total sum of $84.40 had been taken in by the ticket sale, to which was added the receipts of the Cocoa-Cola sale; totaling some $13.70. From this, in turn, was sub- stracted the cost total of $142.50. Three New Members Fill Student Council Posts Three students were elected this week to the Student Coun- cil to reulace those members who had· resigned from their posts as junior and sophomore claEs representatives. Paul San- tee, Phi Delta Theta, of the class of 1943, was elected yes- terday by the sophomore class to take the place of Robert Horton. 1 Binghamton. Sunday's program consisted of religious music, and none of the numbers sung then will be repeated by the chorus at the joint concert. Joyce Warner, '41, will represent Skidmore on the committee. Two members from the class of 1942 were elected Wednes- day morning, Bernard Haake and Robert Newton, both neu- trals. Haake is replacing A. Drennan Kay and Newton re- places Benjamin Jakobowski, both of whom had resigned their positions. NEWS IN BRIEF Greek Benefit Tonight Dr. George D. Kellogg, Profes- sor of Ancient Classics, and chair- man of the Schenectady Greek War Relief Committee, has announced that through the courtesy of Dr. and Mrs. Burges Johnson, an etch- ing of \Kilgarn Castle\ by Seymour Haden, noted English artist, will be raffled off at the dance being held tonight at the Van Curler Ho- tel to raise funds. Mrs. Harrison C. Coffin is head of the committee for the raffle. Academic Freedom Discussed A newly-formed Committee for Academic Freedom met Wednesday for the purpose of analyzing and fully evaluating Eome of the prob- lems with which it will presently deal. The Committee plans to make an extensive survey of present threats to academic freedom. For the present this work is being un- dertaken by Edgar Fisher, '42, Delphis Goldberg, '42, and John A. Ruskowski, '41. William Birdsall also expects to assist. Fox Speaks at Brown President Fox delivered the Phi Beta Kappa address at Brown Uni- versity in Providence, R. I., last night. Yesterday afternoon he spoke at Bard College, in Anandale- on-Hudson, N. Y. Special Placement Talk The Placement Bureau announc- ed today that on Tuesday, March 11, Captain F. R. Lackey of the United States Naval Reserve will lead a placement discus.sion in Old Chapel. Ellery to Preach Dr. Edward J. Ellery will deliver the sermon at the Sunday Chapel Service. Dr. Ellery is Professor Emeritus of Chemistry, former chairman of the faculty, and pres- ent Ptesident of Sigma Xi, Na- tional Honor Society. Members of the chorus will be provided with dates by Kelly. Stu- dents taking members of the chO- rus will be charged a half price rate of 55 cents. Dates will be as- signed by height as in former years. The girls will dine in vari- ous fraternity houses and at Hale House with their dates. Dress for the dance will be op- tional. Both the chorus and Glee Club will be in fuU dress, Kelly said, and it is expected that many of the students will also be dressea formally. The last joint Skidmore-Union concert was held on March 18, 1939. ---0----- SCD to Sponsor Debate During Town Meeting The Student Committee for De- mocracy will sponsor the town meeting discussion on March 16. The topic to be debated is \Shall the United States Send· Food to the Captive Democracies.\ There will be one speaker from the Committee on Food for the Small Democracies; it is, however, undecided which of three people will tepresent them. The committee is trying to get Dr. Henry Mac- Cracken, president of Vassar; George Sokolsky, noted columnist; ot' Sonia Tamara, former New York Times correspondent from Italy. The opposition will be provided by the Committee for Defending America by Aid to the Small De- mocracies. No speaker has, as yet, been decided upon. ----10-- Mavor Calls Health Vital To Citizens of Democracies \The salvation of any democracy lies in the fitness and vigor of its citizens,\ Dr. James W. Mavor, pro- fessor of biology, said in his Thurs- day morning speech in Daily As- sembly. This is true whether they are inhabitants of Greece and Rome before the Caesars or of our own country, where \more has been done and more is being done than in any other part of the world to guard and improve the health of the average man.\ This improvement has been re- flected in the community in gen- eral in many ways,\ Dr. Mavor said, \not the least of which has been the interest in athletics and the way in which the democratic countries and especially the United States have excelled in sports.\ Meeting Will Attract 250 Notable Guests; Students Admitted A highlight of the Science Sym- posium to be held here March 21 and 22 will be a Panel Discussion on the subject \Science in the News,\ Professor E. S. C. Smith secretary of the arrangements com· mittee, said today. The discussion. which is scheduled for 11 a. m., March 22, will .be lead by such emi- nent science writers as Waldemar Kaempffert, science editor of the New York Times; Watson Davis, editor of \Science Service\; David Dietz, science editor of the Scripps- Howard Newspapers; Gobind Be- hari La!, science editor of the In- ternational News Service; Gustav W. Stamm, managing editor of \Science Digest\; and probably Howard W. Bla!{eslee, science edi- tor of the Associated Press. In his invitation to the scientists Dr. Fox said, \Since the audience of scientists will be invited to offer questions or testimonies, the sci- ence editors will have the value of criticisms or suggestions from the floor and have opportunity to make clearer to the scientists the ways in which their influence upon t•he public may be made more extensive and helpful through the right use of journalistic cooperation.\ Radio Colloquia The Symposium will be preceded by six radio colloquia ·by various science staffs of Union College. About 250 scientists are expected to register for the conference. Stu- dents of Union will be allowed to attend the lectures and discussions, \It is a rare opportunity to hear a discussion by such a great num- ber of important men and one of which Union students should avail themselves,\ said Milton Enzer, of the Union College News Bureau. The committee for the Sympos- ium expect that these \experience meetings\ will have high value for the participants themselves in their professional capacities. 0----- Sharpe Predicts Success For Class of 1943 Dance Kenneth Sharpe, president of the Sophomore Class, said today that he expected at least three hundred couples at the Sophomore dance to be held in the gymnasium on March 16. To this statement Sharpe added that in order to· make a success of the affair he must have the full co- operation of all members of the class of 1943. Posters announcing the arrival of Bill Dehey's band are being plac- ed in conspicuous part!; of the cam- pus. Bill Dehey has one of the most popular bands in New England; he has recently appeared a. the Wil- liams Winter Carnival and is re- appearing at Williams in a few The Concordiensis will publish a list of the guests of students at- tending the Sophomore Dance in the issue of March 14. Forms have been distributed to ticket sellers. Students are urged to make sure their guests' and thir own names are listed. On the provision to ban an A. E. F., 36 students would not send American soldiers anywhere while 351 voted to confine their activity to the Western Hemisphere only. 34 would place no ban whatsoever. A marked inconsistency was shown in answer to the fifth question when 152 voted to lPnd part of our navy to the British and 275 would not. This morning's Daily Assembly poll, talten :by the Union College Republican Club, for Senator Wheeler, does not place the club on the isolationist side of the question, Raymond Aldrich, '42, President of the club said. He pointed out that the \Lend-Lease Bill, H. R. 1776\ cut across party lines. Nor does the fact that the poll is being taken through the regular Republican organization mean that the Republican party is against the measm e, Aldrich said. This is a question in which the men involved rather than party lines will ·be the deciding fa·ctor, he thought. The campus group was led to or- ganize their poll when they received a telegram from Robert Grover. chairman of the college division of the Republican party which said: \Senator Wheeler has asked for a poll of all colleges to ascertain stu- dent opinion of the lend-lease bill. Take immediately. Wire results to 41 East 42nd St., N. Y. C. This poll :nay decide the future course of the United States.\ 41 East 42nd Street is the headquar.ters of the New York Office of the National Repub- lican Organization. Aldrich Frames Questions Aldrich framed the questions with the help of Professor Vernon A. O'Rourlte. They sought to get away from the generalities of the IRC poll on the question .of aid to Brit- ain, covering instead the various provisions of the measure up before congress now. The result was the sheet, distributed this morning, which questioned students only on the direct provisions of the bill. The Union Colle.ge Republican Club has just aided in the forma- tion of a new youth political organ- ization, within the framework of the regular Republican party, known as the College Republican Council of New York State. Stu- dents at fifteen other ·colleges, in- cluding the ~ucleus of various col- lege Republican clubs formed Sep- tembre and October, have also join- ed them in the New York State Council. It is expected that this organization will soon become na- tional in scope with students at col- leges throughout the United States participating. Purposes of the council, as ex- plained by Aldrich are: first, to en- courage students to think along po- litical lines so that they may have a better grasp of the total national and international scene; second,. to p!o.vide ai't outlet for students with ideas on municipal, state and na- tional legislation; third, to preserve the two-party system here in Amer- ica through progressive, democratic and· political education of all young people and lastly to insure a demo- cratic government both during and after the present inter national war by such education of young people.

But if he'd had anything to do with naming telephone exchanges, he'd have learned a lot! Names must be easy to pronounce and transmit-must not look or sound like other exchange names- must not use the same dial finger spaces. Take 1\fUIR and OTIS, for example. Fine! -except they dial alike! For the first two letters of each appear in the same finger spaces on the dial. Often hundreds of names are listed, studied, discanlt·d before one is found that meets all requirements. Such care in every phase of Bell System work helps to make your telephone service the world's finest. Why not telephone home often? long Dis- tance rates to most points are lowest any night after 7 P. M. and all day Sunday.

This ambitious plan was ultimately blocked .by the reluctance of Williams, Wesleyan and Amherst to give up their Lit- tle Three circuit. Why the prime- movers aJ.Jowed this to stop them, we don't know. They should have gone ahead and brought in Hvbart, Rochester and others to replace the Little Three. In fact, we herf'by ad- vocate the formation of ~uch an association. * * There's no denying that a league stimulates increased in- terest in athletics at member institutions. For proof we have the Big and Little ThreE's, the Big 'l'en, the Pacific Coast Con- ference and the mythical Ivy league. Year after year Union plays virtually thP same teams in each sport. R. P. 1., Hamil- ton, Williams, Hobart, Ver- mont, Middlebury, T r in i t y, Rochester and PvPn Haverford, and Swarthmorp meet fairly rt>gularly in all fields of ath- letics. Why not make a confer- ence of it? * * League competition eliminate.> that \just another game\ attitude with which many contests are re- garded. When league leaderfhip or even last place is at stake, interest in a contest is increased. Attend- ance of games can't help but in- crease. It mustn't be forgotten that the proposed conference of colleges could exercise a far better control of athletic policies and would get far more publicity and national attention than they do now acting individually. * * * Our boys of the bridge table, Norm Diedrich and Mr. B.

THiE PROM SITUATION LETTER FROM McCANDLESS Believing that some sort of a statement concerning the · present status of the Junior Prom is appropriate at this time, I hereby write this epitaph in the form of a letter to the stu- dent body. Last Thursday I called a meeting of the Executive Com- mittee of the Prom for the purpose of announcing to them that we had a band signed and that our worries were over. I saw no reason why I \Vas not in a position to do this. At home in a drawer in my desk I had a contract which had been signed by Jimmy Dorsey himself; a contract which pro- vided fo1· his o1·chestm to play in the Union College Gym- nasium on the night of ::\lay 9 from 10 P. l\L to 3 A. l\L What could be more of a certainty than that? So, I was all ready to give the glad news to my committee when the fateful long-distance call came through. Yes, the worst had happened. They were going to break the cont1·act-the same contract that I thought was so safe and sound. There was to be no Jimmy Dorsey after alL How can they do this to us? Well, those contracts which we sign with bands are one way affairs-all their way. They can break them and there is not very much we can do about it except howl, and I did plenty of that. However, that was all the good it did. The Strand Theater had booked Jimmy for a three-weeks engagement with an option on the three weeks following. It was that option part of the Strand contract that I didn't know about. The bookers allowed him four weeks in the theatre, believing they would exercise the option for the first week, but certainly no longer. Of course, the way it '\vorked out, the Strand took all six weeks which includes our date. So, out went our little contract. The contract, having been signed in conjunction with R. P. L, and as they '\Vere losing him for their night, the lOth, their chairman and myself made tmcks for New York City the next day. We tried everything in our power to get a good band to take Jimmy's place. What could they do for us? Damned little. We tried to get Tommy by a deal through Jimmy's bookers, but it was no go. He had been signed at V. P. I. for $4,000! Not much room for us to bargain in that league. How about Miller? He would be on the Coast until the first of June. Shaw? The same story. There is no use going through the list. It is the same story. Everyone was booked up. Well that's it. What are v·:e going to do? All that I can say is that I am doing all I can to pull something out of the fire. Just what it will be I can't say yet, because I really don't know. All that I ask is that you bear with me a while, and we will see what we can do. It is ironical to have to print this in the very Concord;r that was to carry the signing of Jimmy Dorsey, but you might as \Vel! know the truth and what we are up against. We got one hell of a raw deal and just have to take the rap. Keith C. McCandless Junior Prom Chairman Smith Keeps Promise Jf'ith '(;eiger-Counter' Students of Professor E. S. C. Smith's Geology 1 course were promised a surprise for their Thursday lecture. They got just that, upon entering the lec- ture-room. Standing on a table ·before the class was a strange instru- ment that looked like a frus- trated amplifier. It was. in reality a Geiger-Counter, a ma.- chine used to trap and record the electron prevalent in radio- active rocks. Professor Smith described the working of the instrument thus: \The Geiger-Counter con- sists of a chamber of trap elec- trons. The electrons charge the air with elect! icily within the chamber. Their activity is 1 e- corded by a audio-fr·equency amplifiH and the resulting sounds give a pleasant illusion of activity. The electrons come popping out of the machine at a rapid rate, sounding some- thing like radio static.\ Alumni Former to Honor President Graduates and Faculty Will Dine in Memory Of Dr. C. A. Richmond Union College alumni and mem- bers of the faculty who were on the staff before 1929 will take part in a ·special program Wednescay night in honor of the late Dr. Charles Alexander Richmond who was pres- ident of the college from 1909 to 1929. Following an infm·mal dinner· in Hale House, there will be shown in the Old Chapel a talking motion picture in which President Rich- mond prophecied (in 19281 what he thought talking motion pictures would do for our civi'lization. Picture Recently Disco,·ered This sound-pictur·e was recently discovered by a group of Union alumni at the General Electric Company and a special copy on 16 milimeter film was made for pres- entation to the college Wednesda~ night when the Schenectady County Alumni Association will hold its March dinner-meeting. The picture will be shown by Pro- fessor Edward S. C. Smith, and then presented to the college by Neil B. Reynolds, '24, on behalf of a group of alumni at the General Electric Company. This group in- cludes Edward F. Hennelly, chair- man of the program committee, who discovered the Richmond film. Plans for the annual dance and concert by the Union College Glee 1 Club, sponsored by the SchenE'ctady County Alumni Association at the Mohawk Golf Club, and scheduled for Friday, April 18, will also be announced.

Explaining that all the bool{s and article< already published fail to give a cl•·ar pictur·e of the reasons for the fall of France. Dr·. Langsam stated that many of the items list- ed as reasons were probably more in the nature of symptoms. Prominent among the real rea- sons for the demise, he said, was the division of the cauntry, ever since the great revolution, into two France<. These were \authoritarian France. founded on the ideological trinity of monarchy, army, and church; and democratic Franc,., founded on the ideological trinity of liberty, l'quality, and frater- nity.\ This bitter L1V1sion was fm·the: c~ mplicated by the fa< t that the basis cf the F1ench government, the constitutional laws of 1875, was originally intended as a m1·asure to r·ule France only for the few years necessary to decide the ques- tion 0f l{ingship, so important in the last century. If this were not cause enough continued Dr. Langsam, the French par:iament was compa<ed, not of two partie; as in the Unit,.d States and England, but of anywhere from ten t!J fifteen poorly organized \group>.\ A condition of this sort made the go\·ernment dependent on coalition support and often sub- ject to fall at the whim of a very minor portion of th•· people's rep- resentatives.

The technicians in charge of the hos- pital's radium supply had lost a radium \need!e\-on!y .1·.1 milligrams to be sure, but enough to burn a person seriously if the needle were caught for long in his shoe or clothing. An appeal for help was sent to the Gen- eral Electric Research Laboratory in Sche- nectady for a\ Geiger Counter\-an electric \ear\ which detects and amplifies the otherwise inaudible \explosion\ of the radium as it breaks down. When Dr. C. W. Hewlett (N. C. State, 'o6) oi the G-E Research Laboratory entered the suspected operating room, th~ counter immediatdy began to \cluck\ its warning of radioactiYity nearby. After a false start, the counter took to the trail like the Hawkshaw it is, and eventually. as Dr. HevHett lowered it to the floor in iront of a radiator, the clucks became bark>.. And there, snuggled against the wall under the radiator, was the missing radium. GENERAL fj ELECTR!.~

s • tS Prom Z-511 Campus opinion as reported to' --~-~-~~~~=~~~=------ - The concordiensis in the last two Vol. LXIV., No. 40 UNION COLLEGE, SCHENECTADY, N. Y., FRIDAY, l\:IARGH 14, 1941 days is aga.inst ir.nnediatf' legal a,c. tion by the Junior Prom Committee against the General Amusement Corporation, booking agency for, Jimmy Dorsey's orchestra. Students have agreed with the Prom com- mittee that in pressing t'he agency to supply a banq \equally as good\. the committee might well come out on the short end. PRICE FIVE CENTS To most observers, it is deskable that the committee be free to act in any way that H sees fit. A leg a;!, battle now would tie the commit- tee's hands. Chairman MacCandless has pointed out. Signing of a suit· able m·chestra for the dance would either be ,held up pending outcome of the suit, or made impossible be·· cause of reprisals by booking agen- cies. Pressures on the College Indicative of the growing ,pres- sures upon the colle>ges of the na- tion is the enginee1·ing undergrad- uate \speed-up\ plan to which President Fox expressed his oppo- sition today. As the president pointed out, to have the engineer- ing students of the class of 1942 graduate in the middle of their sen- ior year would entail far more ex- pense and trouble to all concerned than practical results of the action would justify. While little can be certain in the present state of nation and world. it seems doubtful that the national government would press this point against the will of any col'lege Union should have this pressure, at least, removed. We must, however, be re,ady to expect more and more of these de- mands upon the college as time goes on and national defense is geared higher and higher. Some of these demands will be accepted, others will not. The need for fac- tors to help in the speeding up of the defense program is great, and requests for these factors-both men an\d materials-may be expect- ed by all institutions possessing them. Union is rich in these ,factors, at least in respect to men. We all must realize that fact, and also that the pressures of nation and world will be upon us for the duration of the present world emergency because of it. Congratulations We offer our heartiest congratu- lations to Cecil Angell, George Hemstead, Henry Crosby, John Danser, RichaTd Griffin, George Becker, Louis Semenoff, and David Tiedeman upon their election to Sigma Xi. The ,highest honor that can be given an undergraduate pursuing a science course has gone to them. What kind of individuals are these men? Are they \grinds\, or shy, retiring fellows who hide un- der text-books and glasses? We find that the reverse is true. All of these men have excelled in some activity not connected with their college course. Angell is president of t-he senior class, Crosby Is chairman of the Student Tax Committee and former editor of the \Garnet\, Semenoff is a college boxing champion, Becker holds a job with the General Elec- tric Company, Tiedman is presi- dent of the Phi Gamma Delta fra- ternity and so the list runs. There is truth in what most of the campus has always believed. It is possible to be a good student pursuing one of the most difficult of undergraduate courses, and, at the same time, be active and lead in both campus and extra-campus affairs. Meals-Graded Democracy has reached Hale House! Diners' opinions regarding ,both individual items and the menu of- fered at noon and night are being sought by the Hale House Commit- tee for use in pointing to specific instances of student dissatisfaction Only student rule is the commit- tee's request that comments on menus be signed as an evidence of good faith. Menus are to be handed to committee members after the meal. We think this arrangement one of the \best breaks\ both the chronic fault ,finder and the diner who fears to oriticize have gotten. First hand information as to stu- dent Ill:es and dislikes, walters and service, should be gleaned from the comments. Fairly administered, it should end many of the com- plaints about Hale House. The plan portends success. ~--·---~---\'--'~=~--;--~~_ -~~~---------~--....,---- P:redict Success O·f Class Dance Night Tomo:rrow W·ilkin and Sharpe, '43 Tl1ank Student Body For Support Given William Wilkin, president of the Sophomore class, and Kenneth Sha1·pe, chairman of the Sopho- , more Hop, joined in statements to- day dealing with the Class ,of '43 dance. Wilkin said that he was glad to see \the strong support given to the dance, not only by the sophomores, but by the other classes as well.\ Sharpe expressed the hope that the dance will be a .success. \The Sophomore Class is finaolly giving Union what it has clamored for,' he ,-aid, \an informal d'ance open to the entire student body.\ Thanking the Sophomore Ho.p Committee for the splendid co- operation it had extended and for the fine work it has done, he joined with Wilkin in noting the re-estab- lishment of an informal aU-college dance. No Ticket Report No r-eport on the number of tick- ets already sold has been made as yet. Ticket chairman Emile Brunet :::aid that ticket sales were pro- gressing at an extremely favorable sp,eed. Last Wednesday Brunet an- nounced that an average of ten or twelve tickets will be sold to each fraternity. He also predicted that the attendance at the Sophomore 1 Iop will exceed that of any of the previous class dances. Decorations will center upon Union's frate.r·nities, decorations chairman James Purdy announced. Each fraternity owning a flag has cooperated with the class of '43 in lending it for decorations, he said. A large drape bearing the numerals \ '43\ will be placed behind the bandstand. Seating arrangements will b<> composed of the gymnasium chairs arranged in semi-circular fashion. A special faculty booth will be made up of furniture from Silliman Hall. Sophomores employed by the N.Y.A. will take charge of tickets at the door and refreshments. The problem of non-paying dance-goers will be met by two members of the local police who have been hired for the evening. Starts at NinP Bill Dehey will start the Sopho- more Hop at nine o'clock \sharp\ tomorrow night when he waves his baton for the initial medley of tunes. Dehey will have his com- plete band with him, composed of eleven pieces and vocalist Lorraine I .ee. He brings an orchestra to the bandstand which is eq,ually pro- ficient in either swing tunes or sweet melodies. Considered one of the most outstanding musical or- ganizations in New England, Dehey has appeared at Williams, Amherst, Wesleyan, and Smith, proof of his popularity. Apparently Union is making this a small informal week-end, built around the Sophomore Hop. Chi Psi, Delta Phi and Kappa Sigma are :Planning tea dances and a dinner to entertain their guests. Patrons and patronesses of the dance \vill be: Dr. and Mrs. Dixon Ryan Fox, Dean and Mrs. Charles F. F. Garis, Mr. and Mrs. Fred- eric A. Wyatt, Professor and Mrs. VVilfovd H. Ketz, Professor and Mrs. Benjamin Whitaker, Dr. and Mrs. C. Eugene Sunderlin, and Dr. and Mrs. Gordon R. Silber. Executive Committee members of the Sophomore Hop are: Frank England, orchestra; Lyall Dean, in- vitations; James Purdy, decora- tions; Emile Brunet, tickets; and Robert Nemeroff, publicity. ----Q---- Mak~-up Tests Announced Registration for make-up tests to be given on Monday, March 24, must be completed at the office of the Dean before five o'clock, Wed- nesday, March 19. Students must obtain at the Dean's office a slip to be signed by the instructor !>tving the course, return the slip to the office, and a pay a registration fee of one dollar. C. F. GARIS.

Fox Disapproves Early Graduation Defense Unit Proposes New Summer Schedule For Junior Engineers A plan to speed up the gr·aduation of engineers so that they may fin- ish college in January has met with the disapproval of President Fox. The maintenance of college throug-hout the regular summer va- cation would be a distinct disad- vantage to both the college and many of the students, he said. The ,Committee on Engineering Defense of the United States Office of Education has proposed the plan to a number of engineering colleges throughout the country. It would necessitate an uninterrupted sched- ule continuing through the summer for present juniors enrolled in the engineering division. It is reported that the speed-up would affect only the class of 1942. the present fresh- man and sophomore classes not ·be- ing included, Increases College Load Dr. Fox agreed with many col- legiate leaders who do not feel that the saving of a few months is wmth the large monetary expentli- ture and increased load which would be placed upon students. In many cases the additional six months would increase a student's maturity and consequently his worth to National Defense, he said Disruption of the machinery of Union's engineering department would be inevitable as parallel courses would have to be taught during the first half of the next school year, while after January the faculty will have little to do. It is estimated that the additional expenses which would be imposed upon the schools affected plus the would cost the nation $5,000 000. Among the institutions which have already taken steps toward the adoption of the accelerated schedule arc Lehigh University, the University of Delawat e and Leland Stanford University. ----0---- American Scene Topic Of VanOrden Prize Essay American morals, taste and man- ners reflected in the Pulitzer prize novels and plays during the past ten years will be the general sub- ject of the Van Orden Prize Essay Conte&!: for freshmen this year, Pr:ofessor Burges Johnson an- nounced yesterday.

Snow On Campus Brings Beauty and Destruction Snow was the cause of three small stories reported by stu- dents to \The Concord.iensis.\ Sliding snow from the roof of North College caused the pro- tective wooden roof over the stoop of South Section to crash to the stone steps of the build- ing. The roof was broken in several places and the supports reduced to kindling. Lights in the trees of the President's Garden, usually lit only at prom time and at Com- mencement, were turned on Tuesday evening, illuminating the bushes and trees heavily laden with snow. The scene was \Christmas card-like\ the student report said. Neither of the two debaters from the University of Flo1·ida had ever seen snow before their visit to Union Tuesday. Interested in ti7ing the ea.st- ern collegiate wintersport of skiing, they borrowed two pairs of skiis and ventured forth on the Chi Psi hill with little suc- cess. Said William Grimes, one of the debaters, \when you all get snow here in the East, you all go the whole hog.\ SCD Schedules Meeting With Allied Aid Leaders Held under the sponsorship of the Student Committee for Democ- racy, two Empire State Town Meet- ing guest speakers will debate the topic of feeding the small European democracies this Sunday afternoon at 3 in the Old Chapel. The formal topic of the discus- sion \Shall the United States Send Food to the Captive Democracies?\ will be upheld by Claire N. Torrey assistant director of Belgian relief during American participation in the last European World War. He represents Herbert Hoover's organ- ization which favors sending food to the small democratic states of Europe which have been ovetrun by Germany. The other speaker. Dr. William Agar, of the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies, will oppose the shipment of food. He will be accompanied by Gilmore Stott, collegiate director of the or- ganization. Following the meeting, Mr. Stott and the two speakers will attend the Executive Committee meeting of the Student Committee for De- mocracy to consider further plans for the S. C. D. conference to be held on the Union cam,pus April 25, 26 and 27 during the joint Union- Skidmore Glee Club week-end. Representatives of the committee will confer with leaders of the na- tional organization in New York City this weelt-end to arrange for speakers. Can't Beat Draft By Naval Reserve Navy Captain Outlines Workings of Plan V7 In Discussion Tuesday Enlisting in the Naval Reserve is no way to .beat the draft, Captain F. R. Lackey, U.S.N.R., told a hand- ful of students Tuesday evening in the Old Chapel. Obligations to the United States would have to be met, whether in. the draft o~· Navy, for the duration of the present crisis, the captain, who hc.s been on active duty, said. The Navy will shortly reach ite present maximum of 252,000 en- listed men ,because of new con- struction, and the present world condition necessitating the training of at least 25,000 officers, the speak- er said. To meet the need of officers the Navy has 'begun to train men to command who have not attended the United States Naval Academy but who have had at least two years of co!:lege work. Na.val Reserve Conducts Program The program is being conducted through the Naval Reserve so that an adequate number of officers will be available tho\lgh they may not chose to serve during time of peace or settled conditions. The Navy en- lists young men for four years' active ~ervice while the four yea1 requirement is reached in four months by the Naval Reserve. In both cases the rank is the same though the Navy officer may not re- tire to civil life as would the re- serve officer. Last year plan V7, U.S.N.R., wa;s put in to operation for the first time. Applicants were given preliminary training for 30 days at sea and if their work was judged satisfactory they were allowed to continue train- ing three months more in a naval school. Applicants Tested If he s,hould pass tests for en- sign, which cone.spondens to second lieutenant in the U. S. Army, the applicant would be given his rank and in time of peace allowed to re- tire. In time of emergency, such a;s now exists, the ensign would be re- quired to serve. Captain Lackey pointed out that men drafted were reqUired to serve for a year or more of an emergency exists. He urged students considering the Navy to watch the newspapers for announcements. Students who have yet to finish college may take the cruise one summer and then re- turn to college, taking their naval school worlt the following year. A very great opening existe for engineers of all sorts in Naval Service the captain said. Civil En- gineers, Electric Engineers and Mechanical Engineers are specially need for land work. Legal Action Dropped Because of Hinderance To Future Contracts What O.o juniors say about Jimmy Dorsey's booldng agency breaking tht>b· contract with the prom committe!'? Read '·The In- quiring Reporter,\ Page 4. Six bands. available and worth considering, were listed by Keith C. McCandless, chairman of the Junior Prom Committee, as pos- sible replacements for Jimmy Dor- sey. Dorsey's booking agency, the General Amusement Corporation, broke the band leader's contract when the Strand Theatre exercised a prior option. McCandless said that Charlie Spivak, now playing at Glen Island, Alvino Rey, Vaughn Monroe, John- nie Messner, Henry Busse and Ray Noble were under consideration by the committee. \Although these are the bands with whom we appear to have the most chance of booking, I am still working with the Gen- eral Amusement Corporation for a better band,\ he said. Committee Continues Fight The committee has expressed it- self ruo not wanting to give up the fight for an orchestra equal to Jimmy Dorsey. Once having had him, they do not intend to take a band with less standing without having made a determined effort. Pressure on the General Amuse- ment Corporation for an adequate substitute is planned until there absolutely appears no chance of getting one. \We feel that we would rather continue negotiations with the 'G.A' than to sign a third rater and lose all chance of getting a decent band,\ McCandless said. Time is not an important factor when deal- ing with the small orchestras. In order to say that they have played at a college prom, the bands who have not yet reached the top are willing to \play ball for quite a while\ the chairman said. Legal Action Scotc.hed Possibilities of legal action were ended when McCandless said that it would \strap me as far as ob- taining another band is concerned.\ He pointed to the fair play on the part of the Junior Prom Commit- tee in not signing another band in order to protect itself against such an incident as occurred. Legal action would end all ne- gotiations with the General Amuse- ment Corporation and might pre- vent another band being obtained. If the committee was to hold them to its contract, they would lose freedom of choice for it would be left to the booking agency to decide what band was \just as good.\ A vague phrase, \just as good,\ would not stand in court. McCandless Justifies Conduct In a formal statement McCan- dless justified the committee's handling of contract, saying: \I sincerely believe that the course of action which we are following is the only one that we can take and hope to produce any sort of a Prom band. Although the bands which I have listed are certainly not 'tops,' they are probably much better than we could ever hope to get out of the General Amusement Corporation should be hold them to their contract. There is the ethical side of the matter that they must consider, although of com·se they do not seem to have bee'n very ethical. However, they do have their busines,s to think of. If they can pacify us with a fairly satis- factory band, they will certainly do so.\ Spivak, Monroe and Noble are favored by the committee. Monroe and Busse are booked through an- other agency. \The Concordiensis\ sent out let- ter to editors of college newspapers in the east Mking them for their opinion of th~e business practices used by agencies such as the Gen- eral Amusement Corporation and for instances of brolten contracts on their campus. Tuesday's paper will carry a story listing their opin- ions.

Senior Board As~istants William Hart Albl'rt Kronick Seymour Thickman Friday, March 14, 1941 WHAT THE SOPHOMORE HOP CAN MEAN There are several significant effects that g'l'eat success for tomorrow evening's Sophomore Hop can have O)l the develop- ment of Union. The first and most obvious effect of a successful Sopho- mol'e Hop would be that of rebuilding the foundation of the class dance plan, which was seriously threatened by the lack of support accorded the recent Freshman Dance. The second effect would be that of bringing about clo~er internal ties within the class of '43 itself. There are fe\v fac- tors that contribute more to class unity than a very success- ful affair sponsored under the aegis of that class. This be- comes all the more true when the affair has been conceived, planned, and executed by a large pot·tion of the class, work- ing together under the pre~Foure of campu~ dema.nd~ for \success or else.\ There are more results than these obvious ones that the sophomore class' dance can have. Widespread support of this, the first informal dance in several years that is open to the student bodv as a whole, would constitute an undeniable mandate fl'O.m the student body fo1· more of these affairs. As has been previously pointed out in these columns, thor- ough support for the Sophomore Hop should be a cue for one of the campus groups that might logically sponsot· such af- fairs to begin plans for holding seveml informal college dances next year. 1\Iost important effect of all, however, is that ·which re- sults from the fact that there will be representation at the event from all campus groups. Union is by no means a thoroughly centralized school. Fraternity, net1tml, and \town-man\ bonds, distinctions in terms of course of study ptws:ued, and the wide distribution of interests on our campus have all contt·ibuted to keep the student body as a whole from being as closely knit as it might be. Bringing members of all these groups together in an infor- mal and inexpensive social function that will enable them to know each other under circumstances that could never take place at any other time is of the greatest value to the college. There can be no better opportunity than the Sophomore Hop for strengthening the bonds of comradeship on the campus. In its decision to sponsor an informal, open dance, the class of 1943 took unto itself responsibility for setting an impol'- tant precedent-either for o1· against these affairs. If plan- ning well and managing efficiently be any critel'ia, the Sopho- mol'e Hop will set that precedent-for the affairs. We wish to extend to the cl~ss of 1943 the best wishes of The Concordiensis for a swell dance. OUR COLLEGIATE CONTEMPORARIES The annual Junior class banquet at Lehigh University, held th'!s year at the Hotel Bethlehem, will be addressed by F.

His topic will be \Now What Is Love?\ He will discuss the selection of a !He partner, mutually lasting attraction and happy marriage require- ments. THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, MARCH 14, 1941 SCENE Sub-Freshman Incident No. One The first of those stories that one hears every yea•r about this time has ·come u.pon us r8:ther early. Robert Stanley TerwiUiger, a sub- fl'eshman, has made his mark on Union. \BB'' Ball, rushing cha:irman of the Delta Phis, passed his letter on to us. It read: Wednesday, P. M. \Dear Mt·. Ball, \An acquaintance of my fath- er's has notHied .me that you are the rushing chairman fer Delta Pi fratel·mty. Union appeals to me as a college so I am coming up to look it over on what I be- heve you caH pie-freshman weel.;;- end, ·rhey tell me that it is the .custom for the frats to entertain the freshmen so I will be arriving at the Delta Pi ·lodge Friday eve- ning, the twenty-first. I have my own car, a Mercury convertible, and if one of you fellows would arrange a ·date for me f0r Satur- day night, I could take him and his date and make it a double date. Sunday I would lHte to go to chapel and then to the dance at the Edgewood -with Skidmore date if .possible. I believe it ad- vantageou::l to get acquainted with college girls as soon as pos- sible, \I have not written to the en- trance comm.fttee ~·et for an ap- plication but have no fears as to being ad.mitted since my record at Aamiral Dewey and after at Al- bany Academy have been exceed- ingly good. I plan to take a three year cour·se in electrical engineer- ing and then transfer to M. I. T. I shaH play freshman football, basketball, and lacrosse; I have never been much of a track man, and it is said that the Union Swimming team isn't what it used to be anyway. \Sincerely ;yours-till Monday, Robert Stanley Terwilliger.\ A Note> to Frt>d Wyatt Dear Mr. Wyatt: The Delta Phis, in 1 e'leasing a let- ter f1om one of their sub-freshmen, have given us an excellent chance to prepare a series of ar·ticles on the average sub-freshman, his fra- ternity, and his chances with the admissions committee. Won't you please let us have Mr. Terwllliger's letter of application as well as first hand information on the disposition of his case? * Sincerely, SCENE Our guardians of the ·law, the Schenectady Pclice Department, claim themselves able to cope with any convention since their bout with the American Legion .Jast sum- mer. The Chi Psb informed them of thei1· coming convention during May and the police department t·e- joined, \We have handled the American Legion, and we can han- dle the Chi Psis.\ * Domestic Scene We witnessed a touching little scene in Professor O'Rom·ke's of- fice Saturday morning, The good doctor was there along with Mrs. O'Rourke and Thomas \O'Toole\ O'Rourke. Little \O'Toole\ was having the time of his life trying to dr·ink from the a.sh trays in the office while his fond parents sought to restrain him. But that wasn•t the scene. \This is 'O'Toole' O'Rourke,\ Doc- tor O'Rom·ke said by way of intro- duction. \Thought that your second son was named 'O'Toole',\ we remarked, remembering how he bmke the news to his classes.

Getting underway at 7:30 o'clock, the festivi·ties shoulct be the greatest yet for laughs. Billed as the battle of the behemoths, the affair between 240- pol:lnd George Clark, Phi Delta · fheta, and LtU!e Bob Molloy, 210, Delta Phi, lhould produce Jots of action. In a statement to the .press yesterda·y, Molloy declared that he was \frightened.\ Going to the other extreme, the little men will also have their in- nings. Ski Captain Jim Peel, who at 113 is the lightest man in the tourney, will take on Big \Bud\ Trabold, 125, Psi Upsilon, in a promising engagement. Peel is a Neutral.

Page Four THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, MARCH 14, 1941 Chronicle of Sophomore Long History of '43 on Eve Achievements Details of Annual Class Dance A little over a year and a half • ago, 241 freshmen representing 13 states and Cuba reported· for aca- demic duty amidst the rumblings of Nazi GcrmRny':o guns abroad, the Pre:oident's reassuring speech at home and Robert Moses' plea for the weU ba·lanced student \to live at once in the past, the pl esent, the future.\ 'l'<>mnrrnw night 197 of thp nri~­ inal 241 members of the class of '·13, will celebrate M the annual Sophnmor£> C'l:1~s dance. Within the short space of time that they have been on the campus they have .served with distinction in every college activity and on eve1y athletic team. By t·hE' end of thE'ir f.1·st week on the campus a total of 131 had been pledged and the numbei• shortly rose to ove1· 150. Herb Houghton had been mistaken for a freshman ·any number of times and Lou Carr, pr·esic1ent of the student body, announced that freshman haircuts were legal. The first class meeting heard Dr, Wald1·on address the freshmen on class spirit and he was answered by a volunteer committee to han- dle freshmen businefs until class elections. Rout 8ophomorPs The following Saturday they routed the Sophomores in a cane rush but were pulled int0 the mud and water of Hans Groot Kill when their rivals proved too strong for them in the tug-of-war. Late~· they were pelted by \dum-d·um\ tomatoes which squashed as they struc·k. Other events and other people took first precedence in \Concor- diensis\ sto1·ies and the f1·eshmen gradually sank to their accustomed place in the life of the college. Freshmen turned to sports and their football eleven lost every game while thei1· cross country team did little better. W. Bruce May was elected president of the class after an active campaign on his behalf. Kenneth Sharpe was chosen vice-pz·esident, William L. Wilkin, secretary, and Robert Hor- ton, treasurer, in an election call- ed \dose\ by Lou Carr. First act of President May was to schedule a special freshmen practice in cheering and to obtain special freshmen :oeats at the foot- ball games for a cheer·ing section. Later it was admitted that the plan was a failure and seats were no longer set aside. Walter \Jack\ Schulz won the annual freshmen spelling match when Harold Friedman missed the word \condign.\ The class trailed all others on the fil·st Dean's. List when only 43 made it. Fifty made the second and 59 t·he third and the class placed 58 on the final Dean's List. Protests against the forced hair cuts given two freshmen broke out and Lou Ca!'I· attempted to stifle it with an explanation of fre,;hmen rules and an investigation of the rights of the Sophomore Discipline Committee. Later Carr said that it was too late in the year to take any action and the matter was dropped. Talking Santa Claus Feature of the Union-Skidmore class of 1943 dances was a talking Santa Claus sent Mrs. Fox b~· Joe Madden, Manhattan restauranteur, and used .to introduce Skidmore girls to their Union dates. The year closed for \freshmen in the news\ with the second an- nual dance on March 9. AI Schu- macker and his orchestra supplied the music in a gym decorated with class numerals in a red. and white theme. Unlike this year's freshmen dance, t•he class of '43 affair was a \huge financial success.\ This fall the class reassembled under the leadHship of William Wilkin, new President; Robert Horton, vice president; Kenneth Sharpe, secretary and Henry Wy- socki, treasurer, Their first act was to name a discipline commit- tee headed by Emile Brunet. The discipline committee at once warned \caper - cutting freshmen that they will have their cape1·s cut when sophomores clip their curly locks.\ Monday, October 7, the commit- tee staged its surprise attack in the annual freshmen - sophomore war timing the zero hoUl· for 45 Ininutes before midnight. Fresh- men were rounded up and foreed to paint the Idol, scrub the chapel steps and lockstep around the campus singing \By the Light of the Moon.\ There was no moon that night, rather the heavens opened and wept because of the cruelties inflicted. by the discipline committee. Freshmen avenged themselves on Novembe!' 9 when they completely routed the sophomore class in a cane rush and tug of war. Sopho- more efforts to launch a counter- attack of ripe tomatoes came to naught when it was discovered that the ft·eshmen were well .sup- plied. From then on the histor)r of the Tomorrow Night's Picture .I I i I This scene of a past infornutl dance will be r•epeated tomorrow night at the first aU-college Sophomore Dance.

Frederic A. Wyatt assistant to the Secretary, said yesterday that more than a hundred invitations had already been accepted by stu- dents from all over the country, and that he expected even more would be received as the week progresses. Of the number accept- ed, 77 were invitations sent by the various fraternities, while 29 were those sent by the Secretary's office. The program thus far outlined has been planned to include within it a sufficiently wide scope to pro- vide entertainment and instruction for each guest of the· college, no matter in what direction his inter- est may lie. Symposium Invitation Topping the list for those scien- tifically inclined will be the invita- tion to attend sessions of the two- day symposium on \Science Views Man,\ which will be led by some of the country's leading scientists whose papers will be \concerned with the ways, in which science e·specially in its recent develop- ments has influenced Man's under- . standlng of himself.\ All portions of the symposium program, are open free of charge to Union Col- lege students, and will also be available for the sub-freshmen. F.or the prospective college stu- dents interested in drama and the arts, the Mountebanks Theatre will present \The Inspector Gen- eral\ classic comedy by Nikolai Gogo!. The play will be, presented on both Friday and Saturday eve- nings. In addition, the Radio Workshop will mark the weekend with a special \audience participa- tion\ broadcast from the steps of Memorial Chapel on Saturday af- ternoon at 1:30. Sub-freshmen will be among those, to be interviewed over the air. Intramural Finals For those guests interested in the athletic side of college life, will be the- semi-finals and finals of the Intramural Boxing and Wrestling tournament in the gymnasium. The semi-finals will be run off on Fri- da)' evening, and the finals on Sat- urday. A regular feature of other years again appearing on this year's pro- gram will be the opportunity to visit the General Electric Company and especially to see its \House of Magic\ display in the Research Laboratory. On both Friday and Saturday, the visiting Sub-freshmen will have the chance to visit classes in social studies and literature, and to ob- serve the science laboratory, so that they may obtain a true pic- ture of typical adademic life at Union. Also, on. Sunday, they will attend the morning services in Memorial Cl:apel, when the Rev. Lynn H.

Under discus- : sian was the Hoover plan for send- : ing food to the small Democra- ' cie~. The meeting, sponsored by the Student Committee for Democracy, was attended by members of the committees from Russell Sage, R.P.I., Slddmore, and Union. Upholds Plan 'Skidmore News' Editor Thinks Jimmy Dorsey Takes Unfair Adrantage In an effort to find out the experiences of other colleges who might have gone through a like contract breaking episode as Union has, \The Concordiensis\ sent out ten letters to representa- tive college publications. Only reply received up to late last night was a letter from Muriel Williams, '41, Editor of \The Skidmore News.\ She wrote: \Within our time here at Skid- more, we have not experienced such a situation. Possibly that ha: been due, in large part, to the fact that our Social Committee or special dance committees have never had enough money to work with to even consider getting a name orchestra. At least it has been that way the past two years, except for last Spring's Junior Prom, and before that the orche<- tras engaged always arrived. \It seems i.o me that your seek- ing legal advice and seeing it through to legal action is the only constructive thing and the best thing you could possibly have done. No doubt it hasn't been fair play, and I should also teoel against it, if only for the fact that it is talting unfair ad- vantage of students.\ Mr. Torrey, speaking for the Na- tional Committee on Food for the Small Democracies, indicated that 37,000,000 persons in Belgium, Hol- land, central Poland, Norway, and Finland are \imprisoned there.\ He stated that this plan proposes to send food there on the basis that , it will be used exclusively for the I inhabitants of those countries. and that if any of it were seized, Amer- ---------------- ican aid would immediately stop. Torrey then pointed out the advan- tage of the plan for Germany; it would prevent the spread of disease in Europe, and especially in those countries where there is a short- age of food. For the allies it would mean that this t•elief would give the captive democracies \heart to carry through with their heroic deter- mination to remain democracies.\ Agal' Raises Moral Issue Dr. Agar, asi{ed, on the other hand, \What right has any man or any group to put moral pressure on the British in the attempt to force them to break their blockade, an action harmful to her interests and ours, under the threat that humani- tarian America will approve?\ He further stated that the blockade forces the controlling powers to decide whether the people will pro- duce food or be kept under arms or manufacturing munitions. In addi- tion he stated that these food sup- plie~ are potential war supplies since 'they may be converted into fuels and other materials. Following the meeting, the mem- bers of the SCD, together with the two principal speakers, attended a tea in Hale House Lounge, during which further discussion took place, and additional plans for the De- mocracy conference to be held here next month were discussed. Dr. Smith to Appear On WGY Science Forum Professor Edward S. C. Smith, chairman of t-he department of ge- ology and secretary of the sym- posium on \Science Views Man,\ which will take place on the cam- pus this weekend, has been ,in- vited to take part in the General Electric Science Forum which will be broadcast today over Stations WGY, WGEA and WGEO. Profes:::or Smith will answer questions on geology during the forum in which the following will take part: Dr. William H. Barton, Jr., executive director of the Hay- den Planetarium in New York City; John H. Payne of the General Elee-- tric Research Laboratory, and Emerson Markham, director of the G. E. Science Forum. The Science Forum will be broad- cast this afternoon from 4 to 4:30, over the shortwave Stations WGEA and WGEO. This evening, WGY will broadc~t the program at 7:30 to 8. The discussion is extemporan- eous, and the afternoon program therefore serves as a sort of \tune-up\ rehearsal for the more popular evening broadcast. tageous to have a make-up expert come up from New York. -----------------!> The cast has improved to such a, degree that there is great dispute' a.s to who will do the best job in the show, honors being evenly di-: vided between at least ten mem- bers of the cast. Because of the dif- ficulty of training a new actor, Miss Staneska will be forced to play two of the fema,le roles. Miss Jones, who was playing the part of the wife of a merchant, was forced to drop from the cast because of ill- ness. This role, in addition to the part of the Mayor's daughter win be played by Miss Staneska. Because of the large cast and the difficulties of production, re- hearsals have been long and tiring. Miss Staneska's job has been a hard one; .she has been called upon to whip the play into shape in le\\s than a week, and there is no doubt but that she has succeded. Council A(ts On Initiation Dates Fraternity Delegates In Favor of Changes; Will Avoid Conflicts The Interft·aternity Council went on record last night as favoring a change in the date of fraternity initiations. A resolution to this effect was passed by the Council at its first meeting since last fall. The action was made necessary by the constant complaints which have been evidenced on .the cam- pus over the early date at which initiations have been held for the past two years.

First FM Show Pass Resolution The Council last night voted to go on record as being in favor of changing the date back to approx- imately the old one. Further, a three-man committee was appoint- ed to take the matter before the administration on behalf of the Council. The men delegated for this duty were A. A. Davis, '41, Kenneth McKenzie, '41, and Paul V. Mara, '41. The Student Council will hold its regular monthly meeting tomorrow. evening at 7:30 in Old Chapel. There are three matters listed for consideration by the Council at this time.

Harvey Fishbone, '43, was named manager of inter- collegiate debating, H. Melville Messenger, '43, Student Council rep- re~entative, and Marshall C. Yovits, '44, keeper of the records. Professor Douglas W. Campbell, faculty adviser, reviewed the prog- ress of the club during the past year and also sketched the history of the round table debate, its ori- gin, purpose and method. Union first introduced round table debat- ing two years ago. This coming year will see a new departm·e from standard Philoma- thean practices. Members will be delegated to do research work on specific problems which will be dis- cussed by the debaters in inter- collegiate meetings and at the reg- ular weekly meetings of the or- ganization. The research will be divided so that all members will have part of the work. Material for any particular subject under indi- vidual investigation will be avail- able to all. The plan was developed by the executive committee of the organization. Fisher's Statement In a statement to \The Concord- iensi~,\ Fisher said; \I thank the members of the Philomathean So- ciety for their expression of trust. Fisher, a member of the Pyramid Club, has long been known on the campus as a \leading liberal.\ He has just founded the Student Com- mittee for Academic Freedom which plans to make a study of textbooks now in use in high schools.

This will be the first \FM\ PJ;\Ogram which has been broadcast by the local sta- tion, W2XOY, which has not origi- nated in the studios. Both students and visiting sub-freshmen will be interviewed by a trio of Workshop announcers. Bernard Krause, '39, professional member of the Work- shop who is connected with W2XOY, will direct the program, which is expected to run about fif- teen minutes. Granger Tripp, '43, and Myron Mills, '42, will assist him in the actual broadcast. The Workshop also announced that it plans to take up again the work in television, which was' dis- continued some time ago when the Genet·al Electric Company discon- tinued television programs originat- ing locally. With the completion of the new studios on lower State Street, programs originating here will be commenced once more. In charge of the Workshop's partici- pation in these new progt·ams will be John T.

Dorsey Expresses 'Sincere' Regrets On His Inability to Appear At Prom In a friendly letter to Keith C.<-•0---~-~-----------· McCandless and his Junior Prom Committee, Jimmy Dorsey assured the group of his sincere regret that he and his orchestra will be un- able to play in the Gym on May 9. Dorsey, writing through Bill Bur- ton, his \Personal Manager,\ asked McCandless to extend to everybody at Union College the deepest re- grets that he will be unable to ap- pear. He called the exercising of the Strand Theatre's option \some- thing almost unbelievable\ for never \in the history of band busi- ness has a band been held over in a Broadway theatre for six weeks.\ Burton indicated that he had gambled on the theatre's option when he signed the contract, when he wrote \Therefore I felt very confident that we would :be able to appear before you. Just the other day, the manager of the Strand Theatre notified me that they were picking up the option for two addi~ tiona! weeks. Considering the fact that their contract was previous to yours, my hands were tied. \Believe me sincerely - Jimmy Dor~:ey's thought will be with you on May 10th with deep regret. I ask all those at Union College to please understand this situation. \I hope in the near future we can have the pleasure of perform- ing at Union College.\ , Students, who have seen the let- ter, have called it an attempted white wash on the part of Jimmy Dorsey's manager. He was guilty of bad business practice, they have said, when he failed to tell Mc- Candless of the prior option on Dor- sey's services. The contract, signed on February 17, said that Dorsey would receive a $1,350 guarantee with the privi- lege of 70 per cent of the gross re- ceipts. McCandless called the \gross receipts\ the money collected at the door. R.P.I. would have paid Dorsey $1,500 flat. Union had to agree that the minimum charge for admission would be $6.00 per couple. After signing the contract, Mc- Candle<s abided by the terms in it, making a deposit of $675 while R.P.I. deposited $750. The balance was to be paid in United States cur- rency to the General Amusement corporation or its representative on demand before 10 p.m. on the date of the engagement. In return Dorsey agreed to bring 15 musicians and two vocalists and to play from 10 till 3. The \just as good band'' which the General Amusement Corpora- tion offered was \Woody'' Herman, McCandless said. Later the Cor- poration informed him that Her- man was not available. j i ' '' I I ' \' 1\ ,,

Robert Hayner Assist,ants Seymour Thickman Harvey Fishbone Albert Kronick Tuesday, March 18, 1941 WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE The scmmbled jig-saw that the \Dorsey contract breaking business\ has presented the student body is finally taking definite form. First item of note is the friendly letter sent to Prom Chair- man :McCandless b~· \Bill\ Burton, personal managet· of Jimmy Dorsey. ~Ir. Burton's letter days, in effect: \Although I knew that a prior option on Dorsey's services existed, I made a contract with the Union Prom Committee. I did this because I never expected the option would be taken up. I did not bother to tell you about this arrangement because I full~' expected to have Dorsey play at \Cnion. It's my mistake, and I'm sorry.\ Anothet· document of great interest in unsct·ambling the Dorsey puzzle is the contt·act signed by the band-leader and his agents. It states: \The Attraction shall not be held re- sponsible for failure to comply with the terms of this agree- ment because of illness, accident, transportation dela~', act or regulation ()f public authority, strike, epidemic, act of God, or any condition beyond the control of such attraction or the representative herein; and, if due to any such cause, the Attraction does not petform, it shall not be liable to the employer. \In event the employer (Prom Committee) fails to meet all of its obligations with any orchestras, artists, musicians, act or attraction prior to the date of engagement, or fails proper!~· to furni-sh the place of engagement o1· properly to advertise and exploit the engagement or to make payments hereunder when due or other,.,·ise defaults in the performance of its obligations hereunder, Attraction or General Amuse- ment Corporation shall have the right to cancel the appear- ance of the Attraction without notice and without prejudice to the right to recover fmm the employer hereunder.\ In other words, the contracts tell us, \All right, fellows, we have an attraction that you want, and want badly. We know that yom· dance depends upon om· \name-band.\ There- fore, if we can't appear and ~·our Prom is ruined, it isn't our fault. You don't have a case against us. \But if you make a mistake and our orchestra loses several hundred dollars because you fail to advertise properly or some other such oversight, we can and will take you to court and recover ·what you caused us to lose. Aftet· all, our orches- tra might well have been at some theatre or another college Prom whe1·e it is also wanted and where mistakes aren't made. We can't afford to allow you to slip up.\ Assembled together, the jig-saw .shows the student body that contracts provided college Prom committees are com- pletely unfair. Logical action to be taken by the Union Prom Committee in clearing up this long time \Sore thumb\ after its imme- diate objective of signing a band has been gained, is sponsor a group meeting on this problem. At the meeting, which would have full college representation, a contract should be drawn up that would provide fait· and equal tt·eatment for both college and agency. If necessary, such a contract could be submitted to the agencies, and the differences between these groups and the college ironed out by arbitration. THE CONCORDIENSIS, TUESDAY, MARCH 18, 1941 'Round-table' ·Deba tiny, In Intercollegiate Meets, Philom.atheans First Subject Innovation of 'Union's Now Successful Organizations' If you should chance to walk into !---------- Silliman Hall on a Monday evening. I you might be startled and your I · curiosity might be aroused by the i sharp, lively discussion that was taking place in one of the wings of , ,. the building; that is, unless you knew that the week'ly meeting of the Philomathean Society was in I progress. This club, the oldest organization I 1 on the campus. was founded in 1793, three years before the college was II · opened. In all that period of time, I the Philomatheans have used two different styles of debating, and I they have to their credit the devel• opment of a new type of debating, namely, the round table style which was created by Marvin Lazarus, '40, ex-manager of debate. ---------! can be used in order to defend I points from examina:ton by other debaters. It has also occurred, and not infrequently, that members of the same team will disagree. The purpose of this type of debating, then, is not to seek victory or glory, but to discuss intelligently the sub- ject at hand from all angles. Agree- ment as to the solution of the prob- lem is not a prerequisite, nor is the outcome of such a debate settled in the old fashioned manner, \Since our case is better, we are r.ight.\ Conceding a point is prevalent be- cause weak argument~ do not and cannot stan·d up under fire. Until several years ago the Phil- omatheans used the formal style in intercollegiate contests in which each college upheld one side of a question and each speaker delivet·- ed a direct speech and a rebuttal speech. In -addition to this type of deba- ting which has been in existence for many years, the members took sides on various questions and they prepared briefs and addresses which were printed in regular book- let form. Several copies of these printed pamphlets which included the addresses on both sides of the question may be found in the li- Second and third from left, above, are Philomatheans Ha.rvey Fishbone and Edgar Fisber during a recent intercoRegiate debate. This particular style of debating has since grown in popularity. The Philomatheans use this style exclu- sively, and they have won over sev- eral colleges to this style. Many col- leges have requested debates with the Philomatheans in order to see this type of debating in operation, and la,;t year ·a letter was received from ali Australian College men- tioning an article in The New York Times which described round-table debating at Union. brary. Even the formal style of debating has undergone change in the long period of time in which it has been used. Formerly, in a regular ,inter- collegiate debate, no statement was accepted by the opposition unless the declaration could be backed up with written proof. It was not un- common to see a stack of books piled up on the desks of the speak- ers in order that they might verify SCIENTIFICALLY SPEAKING By ANDREW L. COMREY The atmosphere in the chemistry laboratory is probably the most un- pleasant on the campus, but it does not disturb Edward N. Case, Senior B.S. in Chemistry student. In col- laboration with Dr. Freder·ic C. Schmidt, Ed has been experiment- ing with a group of organic com- pounds known as the \nitro- methanes.\ It is the custom at Union College for senior chemists to choose a field in which they con- dust original research, with the co- operation and guidance of the chemistry teaching staff. \The procedure in attacldng a re- search problem, such as this,\ said Ed, \is first to obtain as much data as possible. Then, we try to formu- late a theory from which we make deductions io preO.ict what will hap- pen under a given set of condi- tions. If the predictions on the basis of the theory prove to be correct, we accept the theory. \Organic compound::< containing nitro groups have been known for many years, but the simple ones with which we are working have received little attention. \A system is followed in collect- ing data on these compounds whereby we determine the follow- ing properties: freezing point, boil- ing point. solubility in other or- ganic liquids, density, index of re- fraction, and others.\ Studies Chemical Reactions The problem is not just the de- termination of these physical prop- ertie;;o, however. For example. an important part of the work is a study of the chemical reactions of these compounds in liquid am- monia. \Although the nitro-methanes are insoluble in water,\ he said. \they will react readily with liquid ammonia. which 1S obtained by cooling ammonia gas to -33 de- grees centigrade. The mechanism of this reaction with liquid am- monia is not well understood, but the products have been determined. For instance, if tetm-niti\O-methane is dissolved in liquid ammonia, a salt known as ammonium nitro- formate is formed which is soluble in water. When dissolved in wa- ter and treated with chlorine, ammonium nitroformate reacts to form tri-nitro-chloro-methane. It is also possible to convert one nitro- methane into another. If dibromo- dinitro-methane is dissolved in liq- uid ammonia and treated with chlorine, chloro - bromo - dinitro - methane is is produced. One prob- lem which we are trying to solve is that of obtaining this compound from tri-nitro-chlot·o-methane.\ Caution is always a good rule to follow in the laboratory, but in ex- p e r i m en t I n g w i t h the nitro- methanes, it is imperative. Said he, \At high temperatures, the nitro methanes form compounds which are similar to T.N.T., whose explo- sive properties are well known.\ The data which Dr. Schmidt and Ed Case are collecting will be useful to othet· chemists who meet in print any contention which they I debating it was possible to evade might make during the course of questions posed by the opposition, the debate. That practice has since and in some cases to distort facts The Philomatheans are also ac- tive in forums in this area. They have cooperated with the Schenec- tady Forum Service in supplying speakers to various church, C. C. C. camp, and other forums. gone the way o.f many other odd practices in intercollegiate deba- ting. In the spring of 1939 Marvin Laz- arus approached the facu'lty ad- viser to the Philomatheans with a plan for a new style of debating. Si·nce its iNception in the fall of that year, the Philomatheans have developed a set of techniques for \round table debating\ which has eliminated the abuses and weak points of the -formal style and which also makes debating more interesting and valuble to the par- ticipants and the audience.

A chemist will be able to identify a particular nitro - methane more easily with this new information. Although, two of these compounds may be similar in some respect, enough properties are being deter- mined that little difficulty will be experienced by chemists in picking the correct one. The work which these men are doing is pure research, which means that it has no immediate practical application in industry. Their object is to explore new fields in chemi~try. \It is a mistake to suppose that pure research is of no value,\ said Ed, \for some of the greatest dis- coveries in science have come as a result of research which, at the time it was performed, seemed use- less.\ In his sophomore year, Ed be- came interested in organic chemc istry which prompted him to choose that field for his research problem. A resident of Buffalo, N. Y. he attended East Aurora Hig.h School. Ed plans to make re- search chemistry his profession. and color arguments of the oppo- nents in a final rebuttal speech. This type of debating a-lso led to oratory to convey a point and to win over the judges of the debate. The use of the round-table style of debating has rendered iNeffective and inoperative those techniques. It also has eliminated decision de- bates. Each participant is free to hold any view he wishes, but he has to be .prepared to back up any statement he may make with re- gard to that opinion. Since cross- questioning is constant, the partici- pants must be well prepared. There is no method of chicanery which This year the Philomatheans are participating in approximately 20 debates with colleges as far west as Ohio and as far south as Florida. In addition to these debates they are attending several conferences including those at Wesleyan, N. Y. State Teachers College, Williams, and Rochester. Being the oldest organization and activity at Union, there is a certain sentiment attached to receiving a key from this group SCENE Ah, the Perfidity of Man! Two Smith College women re- cently applied the acid test to their men, imported for a dance, and winced because of it. For a long time ther had been plagued with the thought that their men said unattractive things about them in bull sessions. Determined to find out the worst, the two Smith girls rigged a dictaphone up in the hotel room they had taken for their dates, arranging it so that the ma- chine automatically began to re- cord when the room light was snapped on. A. Durston Dodge, who was stay- ing at the hotel, reports that a Colgate man got wind of the plot, when his date talked too much, and made the rounds of the hotel warning student guests to search their rooms for a hidden dicta- phone. The warning went unheeded and the \tell tale\ bull sessions babbled on. Their dates safely on the train, the two girls made a bee line for the record. Putting it on one of the campus dictaphones they were treated to some of the saltiest con- versation in years. Questioned by other Smith girls about what they had heard, they answered between blushes that man was \more catty than woman could ever be.\ * * Twice Told Tales - Fisher and Birdsalls' stories. * Sophomore Dance Notes Said one junior as he cut in on another: \I don't wolf my frater- nity brothers. only my friends.\ * we had to go through to ask her to dance, she calmed our fears with a soothing reply. \Don't be afraid,\ she said. \When a student asks us to dance we love it.

While at Baltimore, the team will stay at the homes of several of the play- ers, at homes of alumni, and at Johns Hopkins fraternity houses. Union'~ lacrosse manpower this year, according to Wyatt, exists in greater quantities than he has seen here in a long time. That takes in most of the past decade and may indicate that Union is in for its best season in many a moon. Coach Wyatt isn't exactly trumpeting optimism. for he will admit that his team is inexperienced and in for a tough season. On the other hand, he takes on a very satisfied look when he tells you that there are more than 60 upperclassmen in school with lacrosse backgrounds, most of whom will be candidates this spring. \We accomplished a lot last fall and will be bolstered this spring by several football men and new- comers to the game:· says Wyatt.

P. I. Fate caught up with the vanity fencers in their final match Satur- day. The swordsmen, who gained distinction early in February for becoming the first Union team to beat R.P.I. this college year, IJ~t a 9-8 decision to the Engineers at Troy. It was their fourth loss against one victory. Bob Herman, appearing for the last time in intercollegiate fencing, stood out for the Union team. He won three of his five contests. Art DeLorenze, Bill Moore and Jerry Berton won one and lost one con-~ test each, while Captain Warren Kimmey lost three of four and Bili, Birdsall dropped one. Union held li R.P.I. even in the epee and sabre events, but lost five of eight foil I matches. Mecause the R.P I. gym . was closed before the meet was · over, the Engineers forfeited the last match, giving Union a point it didn't actually earn.

President Fox President Fox Greets Jlisiting Sub-Freshmen To Young Men Visiting Union College for fhe First Time Gentlemen: It is our business at Union Col- lege to place opportunity before young men. That is our only rea- son for being. This week-end we are showing you what this means. Much that you will see hap- pens every day. You will attend a regular College Assembly, visit a college cla.ss or two, look in on the laboratories, witness some scheduled intramural sports. Some event!', like the Mountebanks play, are part of the customary year's calendar. We have many public lectures; we have brought several of them together today and tomorr-ow as a Science Sym- posium; the more ambitious among you will want to sample this sort of offering, You will be intel'ested in the college life that centers in Hale House and in the fraternity hou~es. Union, as everyone knows, is the \Mother of Frater- nities.\ You will have to use your imagination to picture what these hundred acres look like when the lawns and arching elms, and Jackson's Garden, are in full spring beauty. There will not be much time for reverie, but if your fancy follows such direction, you may feel the venerable distinc- tion that marks these ancient buildings, You will form your most trw:t- worthy impressions of Union by sizing up the students you meet. On the whole you will find them of the kind that make safe and valuable friends. They work harder than they may be willing to confess. They know how to have a good time without great expense and without sacrificing the fine tradition of gentlemen. We hope that many of you will want to jein in carrying on these traditions here. Cordially yours, Dixon Ryan Fox Three Union Men Solo First in C. A. A. Program Three Union College students, Howard C. Smith '41, Jean Under- the only members of the recent Civil Aeronautics Training program to have started soloing. Pr·ofesso!' Everett W. Thatcher, Co-ordinator of the C. A. A, announced yester- day that he has received authoriza- tion from Washington for the re- wood '41, and Donald Wells '42, are maining participants in the gr·oup to begin flight training. \It is very encou!'aging to see three of our college -boys leading a class of forty, of which only eight go to Union,\ Professor Thatcher said, Howard Smith, who has just completed Stage B in soloing is leading the trio of .prospective avia- tors but he is ha.ving a hard time holding on to that lead. \It's a fight to the finish,\ explained Professor Thatcher. 160 Sub-freshmen Flock to Campus This weekend Union plays host to roughly 160 guests coming from a radius of five hundred miles to be entertained -by the different frater- nities and by a varied program ex- pressly prepared for them. One of the visi.tors to the campus has ar- rived from a.s far west as Iowa, but for the most part the guests are from. neighboring states. This is the fifth annual sub-fresh- man weekend as it is now organ- IZed; the first was in 1937, and, ac- cord·ing to Frederic Wyatt, assist- ant to the secretary of the college, the affairs have been made a suc- l.!ess as a 1 esult of the cooperation of the students, singly and· as a group, in the fraternities. Mr. Wy- att went on to say that he thought this coming weekend would be the most successful of all, considering the number of sub-freshmen who have accepted invitations to be the guests of the -college. Diversified Program The program of entertainment is wide so that every type of visitor will have the thing he is the most interested in to attend. The Science Symposium, The Mountebanks' per- formance of \The Inspector Gen- eral,\ the finals of the intramural boxing and wrestling champion- ships, and a Lacrosse game to be played on the floor of the gymnas- ium in order to give those who do not know the sport an idea how it is played, are some of the wealth of attractions offei ed. In addition to these, the Radio Workshop will present a special \audience partici- pation\ broadca.st from the steps of Memorial Chapel at 1:30 Saturday, when several sub-freshmen will be interviewed. Still another attraction will be the regular visit to the General Electric \House of Magic\ display in the research laboratory. The semi-finals of the intramural boxing and wrestling tournament are scheduled for tonight and the finals for tomonow night. Tomorrow it is expected that some of the visitors will sit in on the classes of the litei'atur e and so- cial studies divisions and also to ob- serve the science laboratories so as to obtain an idea of the academic !if e of the college. Those guests and students interested in science will attend the two-day Science Symposium on \Science Views Man.\ All events on the program are open to visitors and students free of charge, The Sub-Freshmen Guests Paul Agrew, Plattsburg; John Baker, Union, N.

CHICAGO • BOSTOM • LOS ANGEL!S ' SAR FRANCISCO Issue Editor .................................... Thomas O'Connor Ass.istants Granger Tripp Jack Schulz William Hart Friday, March 21, 1941 WHAT UNION REALLY IS To the majority of its sub-freshman guests, Union has been. up to now, merely a name-whether seen in a news- paper, in a letterhead, or on an alumnus' key. This \Sub- Freshman Week-End\ has been planned so that these one hundred sixty men will be able to see just what is behind that name, to see the real Cnion-from campus to Tom the Cop, from classroom to Johnny ;.\larch, from fratemity to the mail- man who is replacing Uncle Billy. It is with great pleasure that we re-echo in these columns the hearty welcome that the campus extends to all of its sub- freshman guests as they come ont the campus to discover for themselves what the living organism that the name \Union College\ rep1·esents really is. \Ve have said re-echo because we are sure that all uf the one hundred sixty men, through the medium of fratemities, Admissions ·Office, or individual meml>ers uf the college tlu uugh whom they received their week-end invitations, have come to know the cordial spirit with which Cnion greets its guests-particularly a group, many of whose members will become parts of the very college community which is now their host. THE SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM Gathered on the l!nion College campus in this corner of America today and for the next two days are some of the ablest men in the United States and the world. For the most part, these men are leading scientists. They will spend the week-end discussing, from the depths of their experience in science. both how men can fit best into the pattern of life, and how the lot of .;\Ian-kind and parts of the world on which .Man-kind lives can be improved. Gathered in different parts of the globe are others of the best minds of the >vorld. These men, too, are leading scien- tists. But ther will spend this week-end as they have spent every week-end-discussing both how men can be eased out of the pattem of life, and how l\lan-kind and parts of the world on whic:1 it lives can be destroyed. With the gro,ving terrors arising from the ever deadlier instruments that this latter group of men are continually de- vising, in many parts of the world science is being regarded no longer as an instrument of good, but as a tool of evil; it is being regarded as an instrument that destroys rather than builds. This belief in the evil of science and the men who are versed in it is spreading as fast as the war that engen- dered it. It is both comforting and inspiring to be able to view here this week-end an example of the direct antithesis to this spirit among and toward men of science. The Science Symposium that Dr. Edward Ellery conceived, and D1·. E. S. C. Smith gathered together for the benefit of Union and its guests. has many different values. But we feel that none of these values surpasses that of furnishing a pic- ture of that which could today occur only in the democratic process-men of science gathering together to turn their col- lective minds, rather than to means of destruction, toward constructive suggestions as to just how the welfare of Man- kind can best be served now and in the future. THE CONCORDIENSLS, FRIDAY, MARCH 21, 1941 'r-----------------------------------------~1 Haverf_o,rd is Free-~ The Corn Is Green Of· Band Trouble·.___ --------------· Haverford College has never ex- perienced such a contract breaking episode as the Union Junior Prom Committee has passed through, Courts Oulahan, ed-itor of the \Hav- $ erford News\ wrote \The Con- cordiensis, yesterday. 'Dress Optional' \Ne thin•k that the Glee Club did a wise thing when it made \Dress Optional\ the order of the evening for its coming concert and dance with Skidmore. Here is a fine opportunity for either a formal weekend for those Union students who do not have the capital to attend the Junior Prom, or for an \informal brush-up\ for the Prom itself. Those who wish to make the af- fair the center of a week-end will find available a variety of func- tions. On Saturday afternoon there is an abundance of athletic con- test::; during the afte):'noon, with dinner in either Hale HouEe or in the respective fraternities follow- ing the matches a satisfactory pre- lude to the concert-dance. Sunday's program could include chapel and dinner. An inexpensive week-end would thus be very possible. Those going to Prom who want another all-college informal dance similar to the sophomore dance will find that the concert, in conjunc- tion with the dance, will make of their evening more than an aver- age informal social event. All in all, the Glee Club \has something here.\ A Good Job Congratluations for a good job are in order for the class of 1943, upon the announcement by its class dance committee of a profit of over twenty-five dollars. We feel that the efficient management and effective class support accorded the dance bodes well for the class dances of the future. The class of 1943 has, too, started a precedent of informal, inexpen- :dve dances open to the entire stu- dent body that will be a great serv- ice to the college. We oelieve that the success of thi:; affair i,; the only incentive that Union will need to plan a series of these informal functions for next year. Union's Lawns Gazing east from Memorial chapel, one can see what is prob- ably the most unsightly portion of the campus today. Along the strip which is kept iree from snow all winter by the underground steam lines. is a muddy, quagmire of a path which is used by tired Alpha Delts and Sigma Phis, who right· eously refuse to go the long way ·round past the front of the chapel to get to Bailey Hall from their houses. Each year this has grown worse until now there is a five-foot strip nearly devoid of grass. In fairness to the two out-of-the-way fr aternlties. an amesite path might be .built. Deficit President John Clowe !:as caHed for a small contribution to make up the Freshman Dance deficit. The response should be unanimous. Mr. 0ula·han said, \Fortunately for Haverford we have never ex- . pelienced any difficulties about breac-hes of contract. Obtaining Junim· Prom name bands is usua!Iy only done a month .before the prom itself, since I understand no name band will sign up much before the dance. The band, of course, has been selected much earlier. So far, every one of our contracts has been filled.\ William B. Meldrum, Jr., chair· man of the Haverford Junior Prom echoed his editor's words but told of an incident that started much as Union's did. \Last year,\ he wrote, \the Jun- ior Prom Committee signed a con- tract with Woody Herman and his booking house which contained a breaking clause. This breaking clause provided that Herman could break contract within ten days a.f- ter the signing of the contract, if he should deem it advisable, with- out incurring any legal liability. It so happened that he signed to ap- pear at the Meadowbrook at a time which would include our dance, but could not 'break contract with them because the breaking clause had expired. They arranged that their night off that week would be the night of the Prom here, so every- t bing turned out all right.\ \l know of no other colleges around here that have experienced any difficulty of exactly that sort. The University of Pennsylvania last year was forced to sign a con- tract with the Musician's Union. L0cal 77, A. F. L. providing for every •band that played at any Penn function.\ ---0--- PRE-MED STUDENT NOTICE The Association of American Medical Colleges Aptitude Test will be given on May 1 at 3:30 P. M. in the Civil Engineering Building, Room 106. This ·is the only time the test Vl'ill be given this year. The test should be taken by all ;.tudents who expect to apply fot entrance to a medical school by fall of 1942. The test is one of the nor- mal requilements for entrance to medical school. ---0,--- Ciowe's Letter To tile Freshmen: As you lmow the recent Fresh- man dane!' went undPr to thP tune of thirty dollars. Many methods for raising the money to cover this df'ficit havf' hef'n sug- gested, but thP>y have been found impractical. A\:' a consequence we arl.'> a.'!king eaeh mPmber of the class to contributf' fifteen cE>nts. This is asking a lot from the fellows ~ho Wf>nt to the danco but for those who didn't go it is -little eiWugh. No names will be taken as to wi'o does and wbo does not pay. It is all up to you as individuaLs. The lll(}ney can be given to Jaek Barton, Phi Gam- ma Delta, Neal Dandareau. neu- tral. or myself at the Delta Upsi- lon House. JOHN L.

The Yellowjackets will entertain the Dutchmen in a dou- bleheader on May 16 and 17 and look dangerous already, though they only started practice last week. Coach Lou Alexander, whose teams have been about the tou-ghest on the Union diamond s'ate for the past four or five spl\ings had the plea.sme of seeing 24 men a.t his first workout. Included in this con· tingent were nine lettermen fr~rn last year beside;; seven fre;hman numeral winnc:s and seve~al othet hopefuls. Mass. State Strong Fran Riel, coach of the Mass State nine which entertains Union is its first game of the regular sea- son on April 22, held his first pra.c· tice last Friday with the nucleus of last year's fine team bark. His long suit seems to be pitchers.

Over at Williams a squad of 27 is preparing for a three-game vaca- tion tour which will include games with Pennsylvania, Princeton and N. Y. U. A good team seems likely. R. P.

These \neophytes to be\ don't know much about our col- lege on the hill. That is why they are here. In the line of athletics, they've probably heard ab0ut the undefeated football team of 1939,. Sam Hammerstrom ·and maybe one or two other things. Tomorr0w night they will get a -look a:t a branch of the sports game which. flits across the Union panorama for two or three short weeks of each year, enjoying tremendous popu- larity and then giving way to a heavy progra,m of spring s.ports. * * It is too bad that Union~s guests cannot be introduced to other lines of athletics than the boxing, wrestling, fencing and lacrosse which they will see tomorrow night. Space does not permit us to narrate very much. We might point to the string of 13 football games without defe.at which was begun in 1938 and which contin- ued until the University of Ver- mont spoiled it last fall. But if we did that, it would be only right that we mention Union's 11ecent reversals in basketball, cross- country, swimming and maybe la- crosse. Stopping here, we'd sim- ply suggest that the sub-freshmen pay a visit to the trophy room in the gy:mnaslum if they want just a taste of Union's sports heritage. .. * Hal Wittner announced yesterday that another home track meet had been scheduled. All it amounts to is a shift of the R. P. I. meet to the Alexander oval~ The Engineers a.re adding another section of concrete stands to their football stadium this spring and the running track will be blocked. Union was the scene of last year's R. P. I. meet and will be again next spring, making it three in a row at ·Schenetcady, something unprecedented in the ancient series. * * Speaking of R. P. I., Satuday's victory for the Engineers over the Union fencing team was their first of the season. They had previously taken it on the chin from the Dutch swordsmen. . . • Something for the fencers to shoot at is Seton Hall's record. The JE-rsey school boasted a rec- ord of 52 consecutive victories in the sword sport when last heard from. Tllis is bE-tter than the Se- tonians' mark of 43 straight court triumphs. .. . . Too bad Bob MollO•}' had to fall by the wayside m Wednesday night's heavyweight wrestling semi- finals. It was the demise of a color- ful grappler, for Molloy's good-na- tured performances have been among the tournament highlights All credit to Lee Sherman. He did a fine job in finally getting the right hold on the elusive Delta Phi. . . .. If Stew Goldblatt wins tile heavyweight boxing champion- ship in his bout with Bruce Burns tomorrow night, he l'ill be tile first man, to Jacl•pot's lrnowledge, who has held both the wrestling and boxing heavyweight crowns. Goldblatt defeated Sherman, his fraternity brother, to win t1·e mat title two years ago. • * • It won't be the sa-me to·morrow night without Jim Bothwell in one of the corners for the heavyweight ring battle. Too bad Jim couldn't make it th:is year to defend the title he held in his sophomore and jun- ior seasons. His scraps with Mc- Carthy and Sherman stand out ae the most thrilling the tourney ha~ produced, in our memory. * • .. Just for the sake of the record •.. Scotia High, our alma mater, is the new Class B champion of the Eastern New York Public High School Athletic League. Mont Pleasant also squeezed through to another Class A title, but that's not news. Also for the record ..• R. P. I.'s scribes better correct their spelling of Evashev- sld before they tangle with the ne:w Hamilton mentor on the gridiron next fall. • * Bill Dobbin, captain of the Ho- bart lacrosse team last Y\ar will referee several of Union's matches this spring. He is enrolled at Al- bany Law School now. Another new official is George Chandler, former Yale star now at Cooperstown Aca:delll(Y'. ,stuart Townsend of Springfield will again officiate at several matches.

Two very evenly matched tea·ms have ·been ch0sen from the promising varsity squad, and ac- cording to Coach Fred Wyatt, they should turn in a close, high\scoring game. It wHl ·be the lacrosse team's first public appearance •of the sea- son. Wi·th the season's qpener only nine days away, Coaches Wyatt and Paul are seizing every opportunity they can get to round their charges into top condition. Th~y played a box lacrosse game the other day and were body checking and shoot- ing \ruthlessly\ according to Wy- att. Yesterday :between 20 and 30 stickmen practiced out(loors on the dry slopes between Alexander field and the Phi Delta Theta house. Army will be the team's fizst op- ponent. The Cadets wUI entertain the Dutchmen in the West Point field house next Sunday. It will in- augurate a three-game southern training tour for the Garnet la- crossers. Nine Lettermen Back Nine lettermen are ·back from last year's team which won two of eight matches. Though Wyatt and Paul <have announced that \letters won't be too much of an asset this spring\ this contingent of letter- men will .probably form the back- bone of the squad this spring. After three ·poor seasons. Urtion is un- deniably on the road b!J.ck. Since lacrosse first became a varsity spmt here in 1924, Union has had some fine teams. In 1937 the team won six and lost one, led by all-Ameli- can Jack Smith. That year the Garnet team scored 101 goals against only 32 for its opponents, drubbing Lafayette, 24-4 and Wil- liams, 22-10. Its only Joss was to Dartmouth by a 7-6 score. Participating in tonight's game will be virtually every candidate for this year's varsity team. They will be divided into white and garnet- ;;hirted teams. Box lacrosse calls for two four man tea;ms, so several reserves will be furnished each team. Tonight's Lineups Forming the W·hite team will be Co-Ca\ptain Dud Holmes, goalie, and Fred Wikoff, Ed Ward, Paul San- tee, Bob Panoff, Paul Mara, Bob Corby and George Weed. The Gar- nets will have Bob Marshall in the nets, Co-Captain Jack Guibez t e men.ber of last :,\ear's Northern All- Star team, at center, and Ronnie Ostrander, Gordon Pazlter, Ray Al- drich, Bobby Nothacker, Geor~;e 3ec'ell, and Paul <Scoop) Dwyer. These teams can be ex.pected to tum in a good game. :Most of the boys are rounding into shape prett) well. A winter of individual drill- ing and a few workouts in the gyzr. and on the high grotJnd betweer theh Delta rhi and Phi Delta Theta houses have kept the lads in trim. Only the scarcity of sticks has hampered the squad. Wyatt and Paul have a string of nearly JO candidates, but have been able to furnish on-ly about half of them with equipment. However a new shipment recently arzived, includ- ing some giant-sized racquets for defensemen. Snow, ·cold and high winds have held back the drills in the las weel,, just as it seemed the team would get outside for some heav:r workouts ·before going south.

Tennis Turned Team Should Better Record in last Spring~ Says Dwore \Sure I guess we'll do better than last : year,\ opined Marve Dwore, the new tennis mentor, at yesterday's practice. \We couldn't do much woree,\ he hru:tened to ex- plain. Last year's netmen lost all five of the maches they played. Five contests were rained out or cancelled because of wet grounds. Dwore points out that, Dr. Joseph Doty, his predecessor in the tennis coaching job, had to worlt with a predominantly inexperienced squad last year, but that most of the same men are now back. His five returning lettermen have more poise than last year at this time and should turn in a good account of themEelves in their nine matches. I ~c---------------------------- Two season ago Dwore himse'lf was No. 1 man on the Union tennis squad, so he !mows the situation. Before c.oming to Union he had been state boys' champion and had won numerous tout naments. Four men have already been cut from the net squad. Dwore is now working daily with a unit of 12 men. I:oth singles and doubles com- binations have been tried and Dwore now has a pretty good line on the men he'll use this spring. The team now includes Captain Doug Schattan, Ken Sharpe, Phil Potter, Leland Beik, Ted Vinick. Charley Keeler, Lee Sherman, Ed Bartlett, Bob Hayner, Em Hutch- ins and Walt Swart. ts ,Uh a message ' non-wilt collar never uses it stays fresh all day!\ Arrow Trump says: \My soft collar, in addition to being smart, breaks long-wear records!\ Arrow Gordon says: \I'm about the best-wear- ing, best-liked oxford-cloth shirt hereabouts!\ Add these three remarkable shirts to your wardrobe today.

The Septet, replacing lhe former Quin- tet, features the \growl\ trumpet of Cootie Williams, the electric guitar of Charlie Chl'i~tian, and the inimitable clarinet of Goodman. Concert Musician Today thirry-one-year-old Benny Goodman is the only man in popu- lar music who has also been ac- cepted on the concert stage. Be- sides gaining popularity by playing in such places as the Waldorf- Astoria and Hotel Pennsylvania in New Yorlr, the Ritz-Carlton in Boston, and many other famous ho- tels and theaters, Goodman has risen to equal fame by playing in the world-famous Budapest String Quartet. Last year Benny appeared with them in New York's Town Hall. More recently he has appear- ed with violinist Joseph Szigeti at Carnegie Hall. This concert and the one in which he played with the New York Philharmonic Sym- phony Orchestra earned a great ovation . On May 9, instead of playJr.g with a symphony orchestra, Good- man will be accompanied by a band that required a summer's thought- ful planning, selecting, and reheal·s- ing. Although the size of the band remains the same, the personnel is completely altered. The most im- portant change made in the make- up of the outfit, is. the additioa of a bal'itone sax, increasing tne woodwind section to five m~n. and Goodman himself. When G.:>odma.n arrives on the Union camous. fif- teen musicians plus Helen ·Forrest will accompany him. ----•0•--- Record Enjoys By GRANGER TRIPP i>----------------------0 Sub -freshman Week- ends, it Characteristic of that period and I would seem, are periods in whlcn in keeping with the rigid college rushing flaternity men learn not regulations of the time, the Philo- to wince before that verbal mo 11 - mathean Society had very stringent 1 stron~ity, the word \frat.\ \Holy rules as to the meetings and the NEWS IN BRIEF Fox, Ellery Comment On Science Symposium Minerva's ar<ient fraternity men are· relaxing and attempting to re- cuperate this week after the most arribitious Sub - Freshman Week- end in Union's history.

Mountebanks There is something satisfying in the unexpected incidents that occur at every Mountebanl,s' perform- ance. It brings nome with a start i the fact that after all the Mounte- banks is, fox tunately, not a profes- sional theatt·e group . Fr·iday night, the curtains went the wrong way at the end of the first scene of the second act ex- posing lights. flats and crew. In the third act, every time Don Houghton fell against the well, the scenery threatened to topple. Saturday night, one leg of the couch gave way under Green and Van Aernam, sending them back- wards sprawling. Later, with the leg propped into place, it gave way again, dropping Don Houghton onto the floor'. Harold Hend.rickson, on the stage at the time, sought to get the play going again with his next line, which brought gales of laughter.

To show that man is stiH only at the fir~t t·hrN<hold of knowl- edge, however, Dr. 'Shapley re- named his address, \The Seven Pil.Jars of lgnot:ance.\ The cosmic rays he defined as the penetrating radiations th!:t come either from the super novae stars that explode in distan;t, gal- axies, or fro:n unknown souro~s. in- side our own galaxy. Dr. Shapley stated that evict·ence available on the time scale of t-he universe indicates an ol'lglll of about two to ten billion years ago, but the concepUon is far ft om cl(:ll' and in:vo~ves. the problem of the ex- panding un.iverse and t!1e nctm·e .of space-time. Briefly stated, Dt. Shapley's vie H of man.'s place in t-he un-iverse pic- tures him as a \biological structure on the surface of one planet that is stluggling with more or less success towards a rational comprehension of the whole mate·rial universe---a struggle that is cr:tically hindNed by the dominance in his own make- up of musc:e and f.orce ove1 mind and idEals\ . , , Given time enough --\say another million years oz· f'O --the bt·ate within him may be sub- jugated,\ Dr. Shapley added.

C. ------ --·!· The International Relations Club, Jf'eather it-fan Smiles On rreek-end Visitors It is enoneous to believe that the warmth shown the sub-fresh- man during his illustrious stay on campus was totally s.pontan- eous. The weather man, who had a rather chilly attitude toward us for the wee:• of March 16, sympathized with the difficul- ties we were encountering and assisted us. According to figures of Anthony Hoadley, Comptrol- ler our college received a 38 to 40 'degree weekend after shiver- ing through a five day spell of cold weather and stinging blasts. The average temperature of the five days 'before the sub-fresh- men came was 12 degrees. An- other interesting bit of informa- tion which Mr. Hoadley released was the total weight of coal con- sumed by the college during the .past week. It was the rather high figure of 208,000 pounds of coal. That's hospitality. NEWS IN BRIEF Duel for News Post Milton Enzer and Kelly, the dog, will duel in Mrs. Perkins' garden at dawn on April 7 to determine the headship of the news bureau. Seconds will be Jane Szatkowski for Mr. Enzer and Herb Houghton .for Kelly. Wea:pons have yet to be determined, Acquire New Machines which, up until this time, has been concerning itself largely with such matters as International Relations, will turn, in the immediate future, to relations of a more interesting nature. Roger D. Marshall, '41, of Roslyn Heights, L. I., will lecture on the new subject. What with the impossible prob- lems which have risen over the sit- 1 uation abroad, the club has for- saken this mortal coil for more ex- tensive studies concerning the ac- tivities of diplomat Buck Rogers during his inter-planetary travel!\ among tho heavenly bodies. His latest book, \Iglnthrip <continent on Mars) Since 1,000,000,000 B. P. (before prohibition)'' will be dili- gently studied by the members of the club. Marshall will deliver ap- propriate remarks. An important function of the group during the spring will be the annual IRC picnic at Porters Cor- ners, N. Y., at which time the guest of honor will be none other than the Honorable Black Barney, for- eign minister to Venus. Introduc- tory remarks will be made by Mr. R. D. Marshall. The topic of his (Barney's) talk will be, \Why In- dustrial Venus Went Bust.\ A round-table, informal, non-de- cision, intercollegiate, two-sided de- bate will be held next week in con- junction with the International Re- lations group at Missouri Female Seminary, which at present is on a 28-mile debating tour.

Injuries were confined to dignity and a loss of wind, which he has since recovered. The Psi Upsiclone, declaring he was in no way injured, tried vainly to restore his balance and was assisted in the effot·t by the party before mentioned.

Planti have already been made to fete the group in every town on their tour. The Albany Alumni Association, which sponsored the Glee Club earlier this year, is sponsoring the pt·esentation of the play tomonow night. Cards telling of Miss Camille Staneska's successful winter season in Florida, but without any men- tion of thE' Mountebanks' players or of the play except that it \was a smash hit in Schenectady and a \g.ay sparkling comedy,\ have been mailed as advertising.

During the rest of their road trip the Mountebanks will be entertained at buffet suppers, beer parties, formal dinners and an old fashioned box social in Malone. The Mountebanks will be under the leadership of an experienced trouper. Gordon A. Rust, faculty director, said yesterday that he had played a split week in vaudeville in Poughlteepsie, off the campus. Mr. Rust also informed the \Con- cordiensis\ that he planned to end the tom· with a command perform- ance before Mrs. Simpson and the Duke of Windsor in Nassau. Rust did not reveal the wording of the former King Edward VIII's com- mand. Conservative Demands Cause Undergraduates To Leave Classwork The entire faculty, student body, and administrative staff of Union College plan a dramatic walk-0ut for tomonow noon, it was lean1.eu today from usually reliable sources. Dissatisfaction over the beaul'ful spring weather which has vi::;ited the campus was given as the pril'- cipal reason for this unprecedent- ed strike. President Fox. who was confEl'- ing with N.L.R.B. officials ali day yesterday in. an attem.pt to expla•r thr situation to government offi- cials, said that he expected the whole ghastly mess to be cleare,I up by Monday morning, April '7. Students were quoted as having other ideas on the matter. Griffith Involved One student leader, balancing himself p1 ecariously on the now famous limb, went so far as to predict that t!:ere would be a cer- tain unwillingness on the part of the student body to end negotia- tions. Student demands, he went on, included shorter hours, high- er pay, and free cigarettes in all cla~ses. In a late bulletin, received as this edition was going to press, Dickinson E. Griffith, Jr., '41, President of the Student Body, ,;aid that a compromise had been effected with the members of the Mountebanlts, the lacrosse squad and the baseball team, who had shown a certain unwillingness to join the rest of the students in their walk-out. The terms of the compromise state that these recalcitrant men will not become strike-breakers in the true sense of the word. Instead, they will confine their college ac- tivities to off-campus participation in events. Faculty Sigh President Fox, in a telephonll message to this newspaper, said that Tom, the campml cop, had been instructed to see that no dis- orderliness accompanies the con- templated strike. Faculty members, -reached for comment, heaved a unanimous sigh of relief and remarked sagely, \Whew!\ The members of the Garnet Key society, in ltecping with their cus- tom of welcoming campus guests, have offered to serve as pickets. The Terrace Council, :senior honor- ary group, were quoted as saying that they feel .honored. ---01---- 'Think Things Through', Advises Grover Loud There is noth- Mountebanlts Try Out Undergraduates were advised to ing quite like wa- .

Frank C .. and all the gang. Friday, :\larch 28, 1941 IT MUST BE DONE! We have always bittel\ly deplored the lack of opportunity for educational relaxation furnished on the Union campus. Since the ideal towards which a liberal mts colleg·e strives is use of leisure time that will benefit the individual student later in life we feel that this lack of opportunity on the cam- pus is a serious problem. It is with pleasure that \The Concordiensis,\ the twice-a- week, evening, educational fare of Dutchmen, sets out to per~ form a public service. LTnion College men waste far too much time, doing little of use during fleeting hours spent between classes. We, thei\efore have developed a way in which they may gain much sldll, del'ive much pleasure, and leam a great deal, \vhile \\'asting as much time as they please. Here is the program: We will install pin-ball machines throughout the campus-in dormitories, fratemity houses and in Bailey Hall. A \gamble awhile\ nook will be installed in Bailey Hall, managed by \The Concordiensis\ and paid for by a charity campaign conducted by this newspape1·. Idle students will use an amazing amount of time and gain extra- ordinary skill and precision through the medium of the pin- ball machines. In order to make the \gamble awhile\ nook legal, lawyers have recommended that Ih'. Fox shoot the first pin-ball at an opening complete with as much fan-fare as the World Series. Wonderful possibilities are called to mind by the plan. With pin-ball machines g·oing in all the fratemities, dorm- itories and buildings, not to mention the Book Store and the gymnasium, the campus would rapidly develop the most pro- ficient gang of pin~ball addicts the world has ever seen. If every student wasted at least an hour a day at the \gam- ble awhile\ nooks, the whole campus would soon become the strongest campm; body in the world. Pinball tournamehts would replace intramural sports. Varsity pin-bailers, pro- ficient in all phases of the game and trained on an all-year basis would have no trouble beating Williams, Amherst, Ham- ilton, R. P. I. and even such strong- pin-bailers as N. Y. U. College spirit would experience a tremendous uplift with everybody putting nickles in slots at the same time. Scholar~ ship funds and economic prosperity would be the immediate outcome of the nickle outgo. Thus many campus needs can be fulfilled b;; pin-ball machines. .More educational than note typing, listening to Glenn .i.\Iiller on old phonograph records, sleeping on fraternity furniture or bulling over beer, pin-ball relaxation is an ideal integ1·ated combination of brains, brawn and sheer skill.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR The Corn Is Green CALENDAR Fry-Day (That\s Now) To the Editor of the Concordiensis: To the Editor: Benny's Coming Sir: In view of the unceasing labor::; of the faculty of Union College, which have thus tar this year been pitifully unrecognized, I think it nigh trme someone took these mis- t! eated laborer·s under his wing and sheltered them with the praise they deset·ve. These distinguished gentlemen are not only learned men and ex- cellent scholars, they also grace the college with one of the tmest looking academic processions in the country, when the occasion warrants. :Picture an important function of state in the life of the college. The atmosphere is tense. Suddenly from the rear of the chapel comes the rythmic beat of tramping feet. .lfield Marshal Harold A. Larrabee leads the corps of brilliant minds as they maneuver their way toward the distant chancel. Let your eye travel down the line. With military precision the natty t·egiment marches through the herd of admiring students. At the end of the procession, carefully shepherding the guest of honor, is Dr. Fox, resplendent in his full- dress uniform. As the line nears the chancel, the doctors, masters, and bache- lors do a simultaneous column right and left, leaving them in the coveted positions near the scene of action. Surely this sight is not enough appreciated by college students. If these students are not sufficiently appreciative of the rigors through which their faculty go in order to present this fine spectacle, let them try doing the same thing themselves some day. As (>ne who has long viewed col- lege festivities as a guest of the college, I feel it is my duty to im- press upon the student body the need for added respect and ad- miration for the mighty pedar gogues who instruct them.

Re- freshments will not be served. On Friday of sub-freshman week· end the Concordiensis carried a \full report\ on academic freedom allegedly written by Messrs. Fisher, Goldberg, Birdsall and Ruskowski. We do not believe that all the criticism heaped upon the Concord- iensis of late has been justified, but occasionally some specific ex- ample occurs which illustrates be- yond dispute the Concordy's ability to garble, rewrite, and discolor news or stories which cannot be so disfigured if any self-respecting student is to assume responsibility for• them. Under impressive headlines about academic freedom appeared an abortive report mangled beyond recognition. The important findings referred to in the headlines were omitted entirely, probably because of lack of space. Nevertheless, omission of the most significant portion made the story pt·actically pointless and senseless. Mr. Ruskowski emphatically de- nies that he told anyone that the report was timed to come to the attention of sub-freshmen and guests at the symposium. He was not approached for· such 2. state- ment and did not make iL As a matter of fact the week-end guests were not even thought of when the articlo was inserted. We would expect a few mistakes occasionally in a college newspaper, but we cannot be indifferent to de- liberate distm·tion and creation of \news\. We suggest in all sincerity that the Concordlensis adopt a pol- icy of greater accuracy, more jour- nalistic honesty, and better proof- reading which would detect a senseless article before it is allowed to appear and discredit a group of unwary students.

Coach Glenn: Kil:ingc1·, co.J.dl of the State team 1 writes Art Lawrence that he has one of the best cl·iamonds in inter- collegiate baseball all t·eady for Union to play on. Killinge1·, foJmer- ly head coach of football at R. P. I. was an All-American quarterback on Penn State's marvel team of 1921. He played baseball with the New York Yankees and several minor league clubs. Moran Will Hurl Roger Moran is Coach Lawr- ence's choice to start the opener against West Chester. The senior right-hander has been showi-ng up better and bett-er in practices and Lawrence has a lot of confidence in him. Backing up Moran on the mound corps will be Mike Fiester, George Coley and ·Co-Captain \Mickey\ Rathlev, who may be called in from his post at shortstop if the going gets tough. All are untried in varsity competition. F10m vVest Chester, the Garnet nine wends its way to Bethlehem for a two-day stand. Thursday Le- high will do the entertaining, fol- lowed on Friday by Moravian. Paul Calvert, Lehigh coach, will be send- ing his team out for its first game Thursday and will bank on a vet- eran squad to down the Dutchmen. The starting Union pitcher is still in the back of Lawrence's mind. It is possible that Moran will pitch all four games. Bouncing off Lehigh, the Dutch will tackle Moravian at Bethlehem on Friday. Little is known about the Greyhounds. They are usually strong and this year are out to re- capture their confe1 ence title, which they last held in 1938. Finis will be written to Union's first baseball training trip in his- tmy when the nine moves to Hem- stead, L. I., Saturday Every.man on the 14-man Un~on squad is slated for plenty ~f ac~on on the trip. Probable sta1tmg !me- up fm the first game will h<:ve eitller Frank Jones or AI Turch1ck behind the plate with M01an hurl- ing. Don Quigley, stylish sop~o­ more, will take the fi·rst sack w1th his fraternity brother, squatty Ned Neilly on second. Co-Captain Rath- lev will be at his usual shortstop post with Turchick on third if he 1sn't catl'hing. Otherwise either Stan Steingut or \Whitey\ earn- wright will be on the hot corner. Outfielders will ·be Co-Captain Moe 1 Tiny) Weintraub, AI ~asso an.d Hank Wysocki. Earl Ra1fstanger 1s also slated .to crash the gardening lineup. ----a---- Submit Pin-Ball Bids Without being asked, the Mills Vending Machine Company, makers of pin-ball machines de luxe, has submitted a bid of $23.23 per ma-l chine to the college. ··.:.:: ..

Three Dutchmen Flash On Van Curler Tables Three Union students gained the third round and one went as far as the semi-finals in the Schenectady County ping pong tournament be- ing held at the Van ·Curler School. Marv Weltman, Ted Vinick and Clifford Tepper went as far as the third rung of the ladder with Welt- man winning and going on to the semi-finals before bowing out. Fr·ed Siegel and Jeson Tepper, also of Union, were eliminated in the .:ec- and and first rounds, respectively, while Justin Perl> tein forfeited his first-round match. ---~o---· Fijis Quit Loop; Resent Pro Charge Charged w1th profcssioniJ.tism. Phi Gamma Delta fraternity threw a bombshell into the Intramural Athletic League last night by an- nouncing, after its chapter meeting, that it is re~igning from the league. For some time murmers have been growing on the campus against the manner in which the Phi Gams are monopolizing the athletic pi:ture. Currently leading the league by a comfortable mar- gin, the Fijis are the scourge of <\Very line of sports. Bowdish '• ;u·ows Mud Cliff Bowdish, newl>·-elected pres- ident of Phi Gamma Delta was vehement in a statement to the \Concordy\ last night.

Page Four Famous Hostess~ Modernized Bar For Hale House Teetotallers to Serve As Bartenders; Seven Have Yet To Be Found Liquor laws preventing the sel'V- ing of a·lcohol in any school or col- lege were waived by the ABC Board of Liquor Control last night, paving the way for a bar in Hale House. Plans werP set in .motion imme- diately so that the bar will be set up, fully ·equipped and operating when students l'etm·n from their vacation. Mr. Cease, manager oJ Hale House, will also manage the bar. He announced that seven non- drinkers will ·be employed as bar tenders and wiH be sent t0 Daddy O'Neale's bartender school in New York City dunng the vacation at his own expense. The Hall' House Committee has submitted the names of seven non- drinkcts, chos.en from frate1·nitit>-< and neutrals, who will be abiP to tend bar. The names uf the stu- dents havP not yet been announced but it is said that they are made up of husky men who can bouncP customers should they becomP ob- streperous. A typical college bat·- tcnder will ha\·e pla} ed basketball and lacrosse, be an ('nginee1· and a >:ophomore. PrPsent plans do not call for thP employnu•nt of seniors. The bat·, itself, will be of knotty pine in keeping with the trim of thP Hale House Lounge. It will be placed in front of the open front bookcases at the east end of the room. Books, now in the ca,;es, will be replaced with a liquor display. PricP SchPdUI!' Both beer and stronger beverages will bo sold. Special cooling equip- mnt will be placed in tho base- ment of the lounge during vacation for the storage of beer and ale. Price schPdules, ah·ead~· drawn up. list beer as costing ten cents, straight whiskey at thirty cents and mixed dl'inks at forty. A new college custom, that of a cocktail hour at five o'clock, will be inauguratPd. It is hoped that the students and faculty will make the Halo House Lounge Bar a com- mon meeting place. Only one cocktail or one glass of beet· will be allowed each customer in the dining hall. Cash will be re- quired for all liquor. Meal tickets will not be accepted fur the pay- ment of bar bills. Mr. Cease announced that he had already received several 1·eserva- tions for Glee Club dance cock- tail partiPs. The Skidmore Chorus will be honored with one before the concert and several student parties are also planned.

The to- tal sum will be expended upon gen- eral scholarships which will be awarded to all who a.pply for them. Certain reservations, governing the Ufe of money, have been estab- lished. Chief among them is the provisions that the first twenty dol- lars of every scholarship must be used by the recipient to provide him;,elf with beer and skittles. Bt>Pr and SkittlPs Praispd Beer and skittles are essential to success at Union, a report of the Alumni Association says. \When we look back on our college years, we feel that we did not attain the measure of success that should have been ours. Some element was lacking, and we feel that it was beer and skittles,\ the fifty page, handsome, Fortune-style brochure claims. Science students will be required to expend at least 35'-* of the rest of the scholarship in original re- search on a problem to be sub- mitted to the students by the alumni association. Tho problem for this year will be to invent an automatic slide rule which will do all the figuring by itself. Power to work the mechanism of tho rule will be supplied by brain power now held captive in the grey mat- ter. The main problem for the sci- entific students will be to release the captive energy.
