Do{fing Our Derby We'd like to follow an old Idol custom and, in this shert space, doff our derby to various people and activiti~s around campus. · Robert Abrams g-ets the first nod for his new WR UC panel show, \Union Fomm of the Air.\ If l!.andled right, this show could easily become a weekly campus highlight. It's certainly a big step along the line of more interesting chapel programs, although one cl'edit for one and a half hours seems out of proportion. While on the topic of chapel.,. the Student Council de- serves a word of congratulations for the positive action it has taken. No mutter what anyone's opinion of a particular chapel program, we feel that each member of the audience owes a certain a.mount of courtes~· to the person on the plat- form. If this courtesy can be commanded only by threats, then threats are necessary, and the council has made the rig-ht move. E.S.L.

I can remembet• things that hap- pened in grammar school that seem unbelievable; things as re- rr.ote from us as a l-ea-shooter from an H-bomb. Just listen to one of the recollPctions from way\back- when and ask yourselves whether anything so childish and insipid could be perpetrated against such mundane collegians as yourselves: My gramrr.ar school had a w·eek- ly instit-ution called as.serrbly, but that title v.as an ol;wious misnorroer. \Shapeup'• would h~ve been in- finitely better. - <d No one \Wanted to attend assem- bly.

Yet every Friday morning at nine o'clock a knell would sound and a tMo-by-twoo line of revolted, sized- placed, white-shirted, neck tied mourners were herded. in to v.it- ness the fiasco. A boy held the hand of a girl for the duration of the march, but it wasn't quite the primeval story of rrale and female. Most of them didn't· know there was ~ difference, and thel'e \'<3.S usually a small group which didn't have any such problem at all. The tallest and the dumbest young men trudged along at the rear of the line, and w•ere expected to hold hands with each other. After the interminable period of the preliminary exeN?ises ended, and everyone was uncomfortably seated, the program 'l't'as begun. From time to time someone would raise his hand and whine: \Please Miss 'So-and-so, if I can't leave the room there'll be an acc-ident.\ There were many accidents, and no matter how casual the victim tried to appear, there w<as S(}nte- thing about him that g-ave him away. >Hre pla:;s, enacted by . children who v, ere selected for thP ir vic- tories in relay races.

There w-as even a music director, a srr:all, elderly w•oman -who was rwnored to have a fantastic sex drive. No one among the c·hiidl'en knew what that meant, though, so it V\ as quite all right. A few of them even accepted her invitation to .stay after school to share a candy bar ·V.ith her. S·he 'l'<as such a kindly old woman. Alrr.ost every Friday, the prin- cipal spoke to his charges a bout \~Nhat '\'\as happ~ming or :what \~>as Pxpected of them; and no one· listened. They giggled at his paunch or wondered at the percep- tible thickening of the air. Tnere were always more accidents than usual when the principal stooil .be• fote the audience. Everyone hated assembly-every- one ex:cf'pt the pedantic little men who tried to enlighten the group on insignificant topics of e:xtreme unimp-ortan<>e and the paunchy principal who aLways caused an epidemic of mishaps. Yet every Friday a bell announced the tem- porary reign of Misery, and class- rooms full of reluctant subjects marched under guard. They didn't !'ea!ly ~lave to go. If they chose they could wash blackboards· every day for the rest of their natural lives· (using the preferred method, of course).

Fraternities a11d Activities There were mnn~· things about Union and those who in- habit its grounds with which we were unfamiliar when we assumed this editorship some two nwnths ag-o. In the ensu- ing time we have learned much, and most of that, the hard way. The pmblems faced in editing the Concordiensis are peculiar to that organization only in their journalistic as- pects. On a personal plane, and that must be our most im- portant considemtion. they reflect the Union that we have come to know. In the past h\·o and one half years, there have been five occupants of this editorship, representing three fraternities. As publications go at l 1 nion. that is a good record; even more impressive v1:hen you· consif!e1· that in these five transfers, never once did the editorship renwin in the same fraternity in sequence. Unfortunately, many activities on this campus have come to be associated with a particular fratemity. To print a list elabomting this point would l.Je wol'thless. We do not seek to expose these connections, but rathe1· to discuss the nature of their cause. The issue im·olved is not simply that of pass- ing on the top echelons of an acti\'ity to a fraternity brother, but even more so, the reliance on fmtemity brothers for the operation of your job, once in office. Yet what else is to be clone on assuming office? Many of those most relied upon in the past regime are quick to vanish from the scene. A notice announcing a meeting of your group and requesting the presence of new members is g·enerally ig'llored. You have no choice, but to turn to your fraternity, genel'ally those clcsest to you, for help. In time, an aura of clique surrounds the activity, and those outsiders who mig-ht be most interested in joining are hesitant. Thus, a vicious cycle has been perpetrated. It is not something that occurs at Union alone. Rather, the fraternity school that does not see such happenings is rare indeed. In writing a letter to the Concordiensis found in other columns on this page, Professor Baker stressed the function of chapel as a means of b1·eaking across various lines of association. among which he included fraternities and activities. Certainly the connection of these two phases of student life wns not unwarranted. Ho\\·ever, we would be stl·etching· our imag-ination to considerable lengths in term- ing a bi-weekly chapel program. any sort of an answer to a problem that certainly has existed as long as the fraternity. \Ve could be idealistic and suggest that each activity malce a 'more conscious effort to diversify its membership with the ultimate aim being a representative group, but the Student Council's action in setting up a series of chapel re- strictions with a \spy\ system would seem to indicate the present futilit~· of placing rnion men on their honor. This premise assumes that the Student Council, as an elected body, is trulr representative of the Union man's opinion. There are many questions that must be answered in this fratemity-activity tie-up. We find it hm·d to draw the line between honest necessity and a favor to a brother, but such a line must exist somewhere, and it should be found if the activities situation is not to resemble a succession of petty monopolies. It is not often that this newspaper throws open a problem to the sturlents of Union, but here you have one! We have outlined what \Ve consider to be a major campus dilemma and we are asking for your ideas or solutions. We will have accomplished something if this editol'ial serves only to indicate our feelings on the matter, and to encouraO'e other.s intere~ted i~ a ~ollege ne\vspapet· to come and parti~i­ pate m what ts decidedly an \vpen\ activity.

The third of these (Continued on Page 4) Chapel Recital Applau.ded By Robert L. Ohesanow This past Tuesday evening, Claude Frank played a program of pia.no music at Memorial Chapel. Mr. Frank, a young, dark-haired fellow, \\a!ked on stage and inunedi- ately established a close working relationship with his instrument. He did not over\\ helm the piano, mind you:; he co-operated with it, directed it, and at Urres dominated it, al..,ays with ease and control and al..,ays to best advantage. The program opened with Schu- 'bsrt's Fantasie, Opus 15, subtitled \The Wanderer.\ This v.or~. 'A.hile difficult, is not a show piece; the interpreter is able to (and should) play it with taste. Mr. Frank did just that. His control of the wide dynamic range of the rr:usic was striking. He ran off the last six tumultuous minutes of the Fa.ntasieo with a confident brilliance that left one breathless.

The Nature of Existence By Simon Stertzer J. I. H. Letters to the Editor As I PXert an effor-t to mom<'nt- arily withdraw myself from involve- ment with society. and to objC'C· tively consider the nature of peo- plrs' existences. I find--as others have previously Sf'('n~ that suGccss in modPrn Arr:erican life seen'\ on- ly possible ·when people yield them selves. This modern \loss of self\ is causing a eorrelated loss of in- di\·idua lly and suffocation of cre- ative thought. And the yielding of creative thought in any age is a grave symptom of stagnation or retrogression. Everyone is reacting similarly in all situations these days, because his only goal seems to .be recogni- tion and approbation by contem- poraries. Ind·eed, \keeping up with the Jonrses'' has been extended from the material level to the gen- eral levels of .social and intellectual life in America too. ·Everywhere, people are living constantly in at- tempts to vie for a group stand- ard. They strive rr: erely for ap- proval from friends, associates and other group members.

The ethics of this situation are, for my considerations, neglig-ible. But, the p-ractical results of this trend are dangerous. What is the future of medicine to be, if phy- sicians are more interested in their finances, and their places in so- ciety, than in their patients?

Indeed Vlhat is the future of all the pro~ fessions, ·businesses, and institu- tions in America to be, if the people Involved become primarily inter- ested in social approval rather than intruistic advancement? The answers to these problems do not necessarily require extreme realignment of our lives. It is not necessary to become solitary in- ~dividualists. It is not mandatory for. college students to throw a:way whtte shoes, stop drinking, and hreak up fraternities. However, a vast reappraisal of values and mo- tivations is necessary to combat group emulation, and over con- formity.

Peter-son, wife of Sv!'n Peterson who has two offices, are a very re\\arding experience; one .particu- larly, the one of the male and female figures in an apparently domestic state of life is, I think, one of the three best in the shoVI·. This one v. auld certainly live up to \rraster\ Budin's definition of \evocative.\ And this is good. The othet· two are e-ight. One is the powerfully simple figure by Mrs/ Clark, v. hose husband has only one office but white hair. This, like M-rs. Peterson's, is a water color. Another by Mrs. Clark is a city- s2ape sort of thing which suggests a more acute sensitivity than any of her others. The third of these \best\ is the seven sketch series of CHARTER BUSES CALL Welcome Lines 4 .. 9444 figure studies by Mrs. Coffin. She is one of the established artists at Union and evidently was profound- ly influenced by Burlin. There is not space for me to presPnt my theories of the significance of the figures v. hich Mrs. Coffin has drawn but they are fascinating. Several others on the faculty side deserve corr. Tent v. hich just \on't fit. One in particular, an earnest if dated abstraction, is my idea of a d·ream Freud himself might have had (i.f he dreamed). The students seem to me entirely insulated from the influence of anyone stiH living. Probably in a few years these worthy painters wil'l be reached hy Burlin; this coJ,umn hopes so. Several of the st uden.ts' works ·w er<l inaccessible to me for some reason or other so I was unable to .really form an opinion-! did' develop a subtle headache though, and this may be the intended effect. Bruce McKay displays a fine profe.sional talent with real commercial .potential, as well as an extremely irr pressive signature which holds spellbound all who see it. With a. little prac- t.ice and a somewhat .wider range of subject matter Mr. McKay could well do New Yorker covers.

AUTOMATION at work A new design becomes a production reality One of Western Electric's automatic produc- tion lines used in making the revol~tionary new wire spring relay. So great was the departure in design of the new Bell System wire spring relay as com- pared with conventional relays that it posed a major undertaking for development en- gineers at Western Electric, the manufac- turing and supply unit of the Bell System. Indeed, it was an undertaking that called for new machines and new methods be- caus'e none was available to do the job. 1. SUPPLY MAGAZINE 2. CLIP WIRE ENDS 3. CONTACT TAPE SUPPLY 4. WELD CONTACTS 5.
