If words are such precious· things, surely they ought to be used aright; .and surely ·the persons who should know, and who should make, the proper use of words, are the stu- dents of our higher educational Institutions. But the students of our college, and th·e case is undoubtedly the same with other c.olleges, oftentimes make the greatest misuse· of words. In the first place attention is ~ailed to the gram,mar, or rather the lack of gram- mar, .. that is aln1ost universally prevalent among the undergraduates of the college. Such phrases as \it's me,\ \who did you go might go on and almost fill pages with ex- amples. It may appear almost incredible to outsiders that such mistakes are made con- tinually by college men, but to one who is at all familiar with the students, and who is at all noticeable of such things, it is only a too well known fact. It is not that the men do not know better, for they would not think of making such errors in writing, nor would they fail to recognize at once such gram rna t- ical wistakes were they to see them in print. It is 'only a careless and loose way of speak- ing that seems, for some inexplicable reason, to be in use among young men who can and who do, when they think the occasion requires, speak the English language fluently and correctly. A little care exer- cised by the delinquents is all that is needed to reform this abuse which is now so preva- lent. These are soine of the misuses of words which, merely fron1 an intelligent standpoint, ought to be corrected ; but there are other misuses of words, the correction of which should appeal very strongly to our moral and religious instincts. How many of us each day break the third command- ment? It is not, perhaps, a pleasant ques-

Tz'me-~Midnight. Sceue-rh e College Grounds. A small heap of we>()d piled in the background. In the foreground a son of Altna Mater and Amicus, his friend, in conversation. Anticus-'' D'you think they'll come ?'' S. of A.M. (confidently)-\ I'm sure. I've seen each singly. '' They aU expressed most violent indignation. 'Tis true of each, the spite was much divided; Some bl'atned the ·class, aiid some the men elected To bring l>efore the world the College Garnet; And some ()ne man alone, and some another, But aH ag!ree to say that blame's deserving Somewhet1e, or1 something, for the fact's disgraceful. Hush! Here .they come. I see them on the terrace.\ (Enter a crowd of undergraduates in masks and long eloaks. Each .carries a kerosene can in his band and a log of wood over his shoulder. As each approaches he throws his billet on the pile of wood in the background and deluges it with the contents of the kero- sene can.}

TH:E CONCORDlENSlS. S. of A. M '' Ha! Friends! Well met! I'm truly glad to see you. We com·e to-night to ex:pess our disapproval Of violation of unwritten custom, (They all go away one after another until there is no one left but Sophomores and Seniors.) Son of A. M. (looks after them regretfuil y ). Which calls each class the third year of its stay here To bring before the wodd a publication, A ·Catalogue of college men and matters, Named from our col'lege, color, red,-· the Garnet. This year-how, by what m·eans, we'll mention later; The chain is snapt, the custom gross neglected, Are: we the stuff to bear such scandal tamely? Undergraduates in deafening chorus- ,, We're not.\ S. of A. M.-Of course not. ''Here (pointing to the pile of wood) we heap our bonfire, And drench it with the fury of our anger Poured'' (indicating the empty kerosene can) ''from the vials of our indignation, And light it with the torch of burning vengeance. Here, on this pile thus by our scorn constructed, We'll ~ay in effigy the class, whose members Have so disgraced the college by their actions- The Junior Class-. -.\ (Signs of disapprobation in some of the listeners, becoming more and more violent as the orator continues. Certain of the un- dergaduates little by little separate them- selves from the rest of the crowd. At the last words of the S. of A. M. one of this little group comes forward and speaks excitedly in a shrill voice:) \Hold hard! We go no further!\ S. of A. M.-\ Who's this who speaks so loud ?'' First ofthe Freshmen.-\ The Freshtnen !'' (With increasing earnestness.) ''Shall we desert the men who fought our battles? Who guarded us from Sophomore grinds and buffets? Who put us up to trick;:; for our cremation? Who shouted for us at our base ball 1natches? Who ever were our friends from the beginning? . Neve1·.\ (Prepare to depart in a body.) S. of A. M.-\ But I heard you nave each say singly, You thought the Juniors chumps.\ Fz'rsl of J?reslzmen.-'' That is no matter. As Freshn1en \Ve won't stay to see them flouted.\ \ Well, that's too bad ! But now at once , to business.\ (Sophomores and Seniors join to light the bonfire.) · \ Here in a glowing heap we'll burn the image . Of each one of that craven crew whose duty It was to edit on that board the Garnet.\ Signs of great agitation on the part of some of the rem~ining crowd. Chief of the first Greek Letter socfety eomes to the front. He speaks in much excitement. ''Burn did you say? Burn up the speaking likeness Of every member of the board of Garnet? Burn up the image of our own sworn brother?\ S. of A. M ''Is he not on the board? One of that board dishonored By party strife,(jland laziness and hatred? That board on which you each decided singly To pour to-night your righteous indigation ?'' Chief of First Greek Letter Fratern-ity. \'Tis true the board is rotten. We have said so, But not our brother. Oh, to burn our brother! We cannot burn our b-b-b-b-hrother,\ (Exit in floods of tears.. Exeunt all the members of the fraternities to which the assistant editors of the Garnet belong.) .S. of A. M-\ They've gone. But sure our cause is.still··ajust one.'' (Turning to the crowd, now much dimin- ished in numbers). You must agree that where wrong is committed, It is not right even fo shield our brothers, But offer them a sacrifice to honor And Alma Mater whose fair fa. me they've sullied. 'Tis well l<nown in this world of compensations That blame falls heaviest whet·e the heads are highest. The pine tree's crest invite~S the blasting lightning. High rank 'mongst men calls notice to the possessor, The chiefs must suffer where the low go scathe},ess; Thus if your friends are highest on the Garnet, Bitterest, and first of all, we'll make them suffer: Unite, and now united, burn their likeness. Chief of the remaining Greek Letter so- cieties (pon1pously ). We have decided 1n full convocation That all the board are all alike most guilty.

THE CONCORDIENSlS. 179 ========================::r========================-~--------- The sin rests not on one or two together, But on them all, and thus we are decided. S. of A.M.-~ c' Well, burn them all .. '' (A pause.) Voice fr\m cr,r?wtlof Fraternity men.-~\ Oh, what's the good of it?'' S. of A. Jrf.-\' Such smoke clears best air · once by tireason tainted, Treason to Alma Mater thus dishonored. Voice from crowd.--\' The other fellows would not do it. Why should we.\ (They an go off one after another, and leave none but neutrals behind.) S. of A,. M.-(Still undiscouraged). ''~ow, neutrals, fue,re's a glorious work before you, You whom no party chains can ever shackle, For not bound fast :by brothedy requirements, And not yet bitten by the love of oftke, You, you alone ate free to your own convictions, You alone dare w~th me to pour dishonor Upon the shame tnen cast on Alma Mater By duty long negTected and avoided, You dare to raise your voice to the confusion Of coward shirks -who hide behind' their brothers, And thus escape the scorn they richly merit, Come, neutrals, -we wi 11 do the work together.'' (Treble chorus from two neutrals, all the others having gone off with the freshmen and the fraternity men). \We will, sire.\ S. if A.M. '' Where's the torch? The board of Garnet Shall smoke upon the blaze. Is the pile ready?'' .F~irst .of the Neutrals, (after fruitless en- deavors to start the conflagration). ''It is sire, but we fear us 'twill not kindle, The vials, I'm afraid, were filled with water, And the wood ·is green.'' So ends the :bonfire Which rightous indigation justly kindled.

IJOLLOWING is a list of those persons, lJ with the amount of their subscriptions, who have so kindly and materially assisted in defraying the expenses of the Commence- ment ball. 'fhe extra expense of holding the ball in the Round Building is very great and will hardly be covered by even this gen- erous amount that 'has been contributed by : the friends and alumni of the college, and it would be absolutely impossible for the ball to be given had not this help been received, and therefore all the students, and especiaHy the mem hers of the Senior class. express their greatest appreciation to the following men: Dr. George Alexander ........•.....•........
