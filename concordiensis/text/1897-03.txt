4 THE CONCORDIENSIS. Obituary. Lemon Thomson, '5o, one of Union's rnost honored alumni, died at his home in Schuyler- ville on Wednesday, Feb. 24. }Jr. Thotnson was born at Athol, Warren county, and in r855 1·em-oved to Albany and since that titne has been ~engaged in the lumber business. .A. bout fifteen years ago he was elected alumni .trustee .of Union College and held that positron until 1894, when he resigned on account of iH health. He founded the u An1ericana '' alcove ·in the college library and was a frequent con- . tributor of books on An1erican history. Mr. Tho-mson had been iH for so1ne titne and his death was not unexpected. He was in the . seventieth year of his age. William J. Averell, '4 I, died at his residence in Ogdensburg Sunday, February 28. The Ogdensburg 7ournal of March I, con- tains.an extended account of ~1r. Averell's life, from which we take the following extracts. '' In early life Mt·. Averell was educated under the tutorage of Prof. Taylor Lewis, a prominent teacher of his titne, and was gradu- .ated froJn Union College in 1841. He engaged in business in Troy for two years and while there sent out samples of his goods upon a canal boat along the line of the state canals. This was in a way the beginning of the commercial tt~av·eler system that has since beco1ne such a prominent feature of trade. From Troy Mr. :Averell removed to New York. * * * Returning to this town in 1855, Ogdensburg has since been his home. In 1861 he entered the banking business and has been c:oRsecuti-vely a metnber of the banking firn1s of ·Averells & C.hapman, Averells, Chaptnan & Bca.n, ;and of the Ogdensburg bank. * * * To enumerate the various offices which Mr. Averell has filled would be to name 111any of the positions of honor, trust and responsibility within the gift of his fellovv citi- zens. He has been mayor of the city, super- visor of the town, superintendent of the poor, etc. He was first treasurer of the St. Lawrence State Hospital and took a deep interest in its .welfare. He was also a trustee of the City Hospital and a liberal contributor toward its -construction and maintenance. Indeed, most public enterprises, especially those of a chari- table nature, rec€ived his cord·ial sytnpathy and support. He was a generous contributor toward the Public Library, and was one of four to build ~·nd donate the beautiful chapel at the Odgens- burg cemetery.\ ~ross \Ot~Q-try ~UIJS. A feature of college athletics that has always proved popular is the cross country runs that are taken each year by the track men. It has been shown each year that the best form of preparatory training for the running events is regular cross country runs. These develope strength and endurance. . The advantages of this system of training are fully appreciated by :all the athletes of to-day. In order to foster its developtnent class cross country clubs have been fonned, and othet·s ate .soon to be formed. '97 and '99 have organized clubs. D. L. Wood, '97, l1as been chosen captain of the Senior club and he will lead fully twenty men on the cross country runs of the cotning spring. M. M. Price, '99, will captain a club of twenty-five cross country runners from the Sophon1ore class. Regulation running suits bearing the class nun1erals have been ordered by both clubs. The existence of these clubs will strengthen the athletic prospects not only of the respective classes that form them, but also, of the college itself. Our present track team is not especially sh·ong, and nothing is n1ore desirable for the success of our track athletics next spring than the proper encouragement and developn1ent of all the available material now in college. fHumQi ~otes. '49-Edward L. Bet·thoud recently prepared an article on \ Tbe Boundaries of Louisiana in I 803.\ The paper ·was evident} y prepared in the interest of the National Geographical Society of which Mt. Berthoud is a n1ember. The paper is an exhaustive exposition of the subject and quite successfully disproves son1e statements made by a Col. Broadhead relating to the same question.

The sermon is an able discus~ion of the ,prin- ciples and facts of evolution.

A college tneeting was held Tuesday morn- ing to ratify the constitution of the new New York State Intercollegiate Athletic Union. Each article was read and ratified separately ex- cept article X. relating to the qualifications of athletes and article XI. relating to the litnit of eligibility. It was decided that Union's repre- sentatives should endeavor to have the nutnber of required hours of study per week increased from 12 to 15 and that they use their own dis- cretion about the limit of eligibility.

IT IS absolutely necessary, that the manage- me.nt of the college publications receive some of the outstanding subscriptions, so that they can cancel their indebtedness with the printer. THE P A.RTHENON for February, appeared Saturday last. The many readers of the maga- zine will undoubtedly be pleased to note the g1·eater diversity of matter which appears in this number. The editors are disposed to feel encour- aged. If the students note carefully the charac- ter of the articles which appear in this issue, they cannot fail to appreciate the willingness of the editors to publish everything of merit which comes to their desks. MANY years have passed since Union has had as creditable a rnusical organization as she has this year. Five concerts have been given, all of which have been successful. On the 19th of this month the clubs give a concert at Amsterdam. If they then have as good a house as they expect, they will realize enough to clear themselves of all out- standing indebtedness. Mr. H. C. Todd, who has proved an able man- agel', is contemplating a trip to New York, whichp if carried out, should net considerablepro:fittothe clubs, as several concerts would be given at val'i- ous places between here and that city. He wishes to call the attention of the alun1ni of the college, to the ·work of these clubs, and re- quests their co-operation at such places as the clubs may chance to strH{e in their trips about the country, and if there is any locality within a. reasonable distance of Schenectady, where such entertainm·ent, as is offered by the musical clubs, would receive popular support, he would willingly consider a proposition to schedule some future date, to appear there and give the regular con- cert. TUESDA.Y morning, at a special college meeting, the constitution drafted by the New York State Atl1Ietic Union was bl·ought up for discussion. With one or two exceptions, the various articles of the constitution were ratified. The action of the student body on this occasion clearly shows the dominating influence which directed their movements. There was a comrnendable determination on their part to maintain athletics at Union in accordance with. the most approved ideas regarding amateur athletics. On the whole, the action of the student body was commendable. It shows that the students, as well as the faculty, are heartily in favor of pure athletics. A few days ago, the students of Col- gate ratified the proposed constitution and there is every indication that Hamilton will do the same. Syracuse, Rochester and Hobart evidently find the new regulations too stringent for their present methods. The University Herald of this week states, editoria.lly, that there ·will probably be two triple leagues; Syracuse, Rochester and Hobart forming one, and TJ nion, Colgate and Hamilton, the other. Syracuse and Casper Whitney seem to have become reconciled. N otwitbstanding Chancellor Day's recently expressed opinion, they think Mr. Whitney knows something about athletics after all A little cheap advertising is not a bad thing either. We quote from the University Herald the fol- lowing: \We believe Mr. Whitney is not so poor a judge of athletic matters as he certainly appeared to be from his first article. We cannot feel too thank- ful for his lack of knowledge in the first place, for, fortunately, he is a man who believes in cor- recting himself, and after looking up Syracuse's record gives the results of his investigation to the public in another article in Ha1pe 6 r's, which will prove a great advertisement for Syracuse.\

Prouty, of Spencer, Mass., cleared 5 ft. 9~ inches in the running high jump. H. W. Fifer, of Bloomington, Ill., vaulted 10 ft. 3 inches, being pt~evented fro1n making a still better record by the shortness of the bar sup- ports. Yale has at last consented to· row Cornell. With Harvard, Yale, Cornell, Colutnbia and Pennsylvania all hard at work developing a crew to compete in the regetta next June, it is reasonable to expect an exciting time on the day of the race.

Yale has fonnally challenged Princeton to a foot ball game to be played on the Saturday before Thanksgiving, at a place to be decided on later, preferably neutral grounds. YALE AND HARVARD RECONCILED. A formal agreement for the resumption of athletic relations between Harvard and Yale was drawn up and signed last Sunday by Mr. W. A. Brooks, Jr., Harvard '87, and Mr. Walter Camp, Yale '8o, being the fully em- powered representatives of Harvard and Yale, respectively. The main features of the agree- ment are the renewal of athletic relations for a period of five years, the requirement that all events except rowing E>hould take place upon college grounds, and the appointment of a graduate committee of arbitration for the settle- ment of all disputes.- Yale Alumni Weekly.

Cornell will feel the eflects of the bill,. if pas-sed, more than any other university or college in the state, as ·she has by far the greatest Yale and Harvard reached an agreern:ent on Saturday for their foot ball game this year.

This, however, would compel Harvard to play three games in as many weeks, as the Pennsylvania-Harvard game has been arranged for the same date as the Yale-Prince- ton game. :BlLL EXEMPTING FRATERNITY PROPERTY FROM TAXATION.

The Concordiensis VoL~ XX. UNION COLLEGE, MARCH 13, 189'7. No. 22. flew Yor~ State IQter-~olle~iate fltl]letie · tll)iOI). At the meeting of the representatives of the several New York State Colleges held .at Bagg's Hotel in Utica, Saturday, March 6, the organi- zation of the proposed New York State Inter- collegiate Athletic Union was perfected. The delegates \Vere: Hatnilton College, Prof. W. H. Squires, George E. Dunham of Utica, and J. M. Glass; Colgate, Prof. W. H. Craw- shaw, W. E. Weed of Utica, and L. J. Cald- well; Union, Dr. J. P. Patterson, E. C. Angle and Paul Canfield; Hobart, Prof. Dermand, J. H. Johnston of Geneva, and \V. S. Watson; Rochester, F. L. Cub ley. Syracuse was not represented. Reports on the action of the institutions on the constitution, submitted to them, were called for. Hamilton, Colgate, Union aQd Hobart accepted the constitution, each, however, offer- ing certain suggestions regarding the same. Mr. Cub ley of Rochester presented a report stating that his university had decided not to join the Union. The conference then constituted itself an advisory board of the New York State Inter- collegiate Union, under the constitution, subject to whatever amendn1ents 1night be made in accordance -vvith the recon11nendations · of the colleges. The constitution was then taken up section by section, and the recomn1endations t acted upon. Union, Hamilton and Colgate desired that the clause providing that students must take 12 hou1~s of recitations a week in order to qualify for inter-collegiate games, be changed to read 15 hours instead of I 2, but the point was not pressed and the I 2 hours pro- vision stood. The eligibility clause as finally adopted reads as follows : ELIGIBILITY.-' 'No person shall be allowed to play on any teatn who is not an amateur athlete and who is not a bonafide student of a college or university represented on the advisory board. A .bona fide student is defined as one pursuing a regular course leading to a degree or any regularly entered student taking at least I 2 hours per week. Also, no student shall play on any team who has more than two term conditions.'' The question of aHowing students to receive pay for playing on sutnmer base ball nines was discussed at length~ under a motion that the con- stitution be changed so as to permit the same. Summer base ball playing was finally ruled out. The following officers of the union were ,elected: Pre5ident, William E. Weed, Col- gate; vice-president, Prof. Albert Dermand, Hobart; secretary, Paul Canfield, Union; treas- urer, George E. Dunham, Hamilton ; assistant treasurer, J atnes M. Glass, Han1ilton. The following cotnmittees were appointed by · the president : Judicial- J. H. Johnston of Hobart. On Athletics-]. M. Glass, chairman, and Prof. W. H. Squires, Hamilton; L. J. Cald- well. Colgate; Dr. Patterson and Paul Canfield, Union ; and W. S. Watson of Hobart. Financial-Prof. Dermand, Hobart, chair- man; Prof. Squires, Hamilton; Prof. Craw- shaw, Colgate; and Paul Canfield, Union. A resolution was adopted declaring it to be the sense of the board that a field day sl1ould be held in Utica sorne time in May. The resolu- tion was referred to the committee on athletics. Hegeman, \99 and Hornsby, '99, spent Saturday, March 6, at Albany. During the past week, the Sophomores have been rehearsing their term orations to Prof. Hale. Clarence Johnson, '9o, with the Haines Piano cotnpany, of New York City, was in town • Saturday, March 6.

TfiE CONOORDIENSIS. Ceature Of} (le<;:trieity. The twenty-eighth lecture in the Butterfield practical course ~ras delivered in the chapei Friday afternoon, March 5, by 1\IIr. C. J. Field, the well-known consulting and constructing engineer of New York, who took for his subject '' Electricity.\ About t\velve years ago, the public demanded a faster and more cqnvenient mode of passenger service in our cities th:tn the ordinary horse or cable cars, and to satisfy these demands electri- city was introduced as a traction power. The old fashion horse cars had an average speed of . four tniles an hour and fron1 sixty to seventy miles per day-requiring from eight to twelve horses per day to operate each car; thus the cost of traction power amounted 50 per cent. of the, operating expenses. The first electric car line established had two trolleys---.one wire for the out current and the other for the return-which proved difficult to insulate. In 1887 the Sprague Electric com- pany of New York, constructed a road at Rich- nlond,. Va., where for the first tilne a single overhead wire was used successfully, the return current passing through the rails. An old horse car track i~ useless for electric cars owing to the distance between ties and the uneven condition of the rails. Conduits are now constructed under ground and are of two kinds-open and closed. The former resemble a cable gutter and the power is transmitted to the car by means of a shoe running in the gutter. The closed conduits are much 1nore advantageous as they need less excavation. The first electric car~ had from five hundred to seven hundred volt motors attached to each axle; but thi& povver has been increased until now the average electric car carries from forty to fifty horse power motors. The power was at first supplied by numerous stations, but by means of careful study, experts have invented larger generating apparatus and concentration of power so that now traction power for large cities is furnished by a single plant~ The power is applied to the car axle in two ways-either by alterilating current with alter- nating motor or by direct motor on the car. The former has proved unsuccessful except in shop experin1ents ; it is. too complicated for the ordinary operative. In the construction of a trolley road four fac-:- tors must be taken into careful consideration : the track, the overhead work, the rolling stock and the power station. The first electric roads had what is known as Trails, similar to steam railroad rails. They proved unsatisfactory because wagons could not be driven on the track, and then the present teatn or girder rails were introduced so that a wagon can be used on the track. Fifty pound rails were first used, but the increase in weight of the cars has den1anded heavier rails, until now they weight So- 100 lhs, the same weight used by steam railroads. The ground was supposed to be· a good con- ductor of electricity, so the return current was allowed to pass into the ground, but the effect on underground pipes soon caused the ·com- panies to confine the return current to the rails. There are various modes of overhead con- struction. The poles may be of steel, iron or wood and the wire n1ay be suspended between two poles or from brackets. Those in most common use are the single line of poles with wire suspended from brackets ; the wire being insulated to the brackets. The old horse cars were too small and light for electric roads. The cars now measure from 29 to 33 feet over all, being from 10 to I 5 feet longer than horse cars. The cars were con- structed on a single truck which could turn a curve whose radius was from 40 to 45 feet. The wheel base was so short that the cars had a rocking motion and to obviate this difficulty the cars now are constructed on two trucks sitnilar to steam cars. The power stations were at £rst unable to supply the power without an immense expendi- ture of fuel, but n1odern machinery can produce one horse power by the use of three pounds of coal, with an average cost of less than two cents per car mile for power. The cost of construction and equipment of a road in cities is as follows: Track, $ro,ooo per mile; overhead construction, $7,000; cars, $z,ooo each, and cost of plants vary very much according to extent of line and nature of the road. 1\'he cost of operating each car amounts to $12 per day, while the amount that a car will take in amounts to $r 8 to $25. The average profit on investments in electric car ~lines amounts to about 7 per cent.

EVERY student of Union College has reason to rejoice and every alumnus may feel a just pride in his college. On Saturday last. for the first time in many years the athletic organizations of this col- lege were freed from debt. Bad managentent and ill luck had involved the athletic interests of the college in such a tangle of indebtedness that not only athletics were e:ffected, but other departments as well. At last we are free. The CoNCORDIENSIS in behalf of the student body most heartily and thankfully acknowledges the aid received from generous alumni and friends. The students have I'epeatedly responded to the urgent plea for more funds, and as individuals many have generously denied themselves personal pleasures that in so doing they could contribute toward the general fund which was raised for the purpose of liquida- ting past indebtedness. The result has been accomplished only through the untiring efforts of a few who were deeply interested in the athletics of the college. Our fellow student, 1\fr. Birch, is recognized as having been most active in bringing about the desired result. · WE NOTE a revival of college spirit which has latel,y become manifest. The1·e is every indication that with the coming of spring the old tirne spirit · which has always characterized the Union College student. will again assert itself. We note a few straws that show which way the. wind blows. They aU seem to be pointing in the sa1ne direction. The large number of men pi·ac.tlcing base ball in the gyn1na;sium ; the lreener interest which is being taken in the preparations for the indoor track rneet that is to take place ne:xt Thursday; the college meeting of three weeks ago at which a lai·ge f,UID of money was raised; also the r.neeting of two weel~:s ago -when the student body ratified the constitution drafted by the New York State .Athletic Union, all indicate the revival of tbat most potent force which directs the affairs of tl1e hea1thy, hearty and ambitious college student, na1nely college spirit. · INTER-COLLEGIATE debates are becon1ing very popular. 'rhe revival of interest in this line of work which has taken place durh1g the past year is I'emarkable. Nearly every college in the coan- try has become interested, and has either already entered a debating or oratorical contest with some other institution or their representatives are actively engaged in preparing themselves for such an event. Yale and Harvard, Cornell and Pennsylvania, University of Michigan and University of Io·wa, Lehigh. and Lafayette, Union. Rochester and Syracuse, and many other institutions are parties to this revival of interest in discussions from the rostrum, Rivalry ·along such lines will undoubtedly be accompanied by good results. Public speaking by the students of colleges should be encouraged as the benefits to the individual are of no slight mornent. A discussion of this subject brings us to the con- sicleration of the work of the two literary societies of this college. The Adelphic and Philomathean Societies have existed nearly as long as the institu- tion itself. In times past they have been the strongest forces in the college. The literary efforts of these societies from 1860 to 1875 found expression in the Union College JJfagazine which most creditably represented this institution in the field of collegiate journalism. Of late years these societies have failed to support the college publica- tions with anything like the spirit of thirty years ago . The character and history of these societies are such as should n1ost closely bind them in inter- est to the literary publications which represent this college. The converse of the foregoing Inay be as stl·ongly asserted. Those who are interested in the college publications would certainly profit by the training offered by these two debating societies.

THE .O:ONO'ORDIENSIS. THE following is the report of the librarian of Amherst College for the month of February. During the month of February the library was .open 23 days. The total evening attendance in the reading rootn was 673, .making the average attendance 29. There were, 1,191 volumes. d1·awn during the n1onth, classified under the following heads: Fiction 245, philosophy 19, religion 45, .sociology 70, philology 49, natural science 96, use- ful arts 31, literature 402, history 167. The largPst number drawn, 127, was on February 27. and the smallest nu.mber, 29, on February 12. The aver- age number of books drawn per day was' 51. We reprint the above not because we think any .of our readers are interested in the library of Amherst College, but to call attention by way of .contrast to the absolute inefficiency of our own system. Such an accurate account of the conduct ,of the Union College library has not been m.ade ih many years, and we doubt if any such a record -ever was made. Early last_ fall THE CONCORDIENSIS called tlle ..attention of the authorities of the college to the .absolute lack of proper library control and sug- gested that a few modern ideas be substituted for some .of those that have so long held sway. Seven months have passed and the library committee have placed screens upon some of the book stacks. But few, if any of the screens are locked and if they were it is not probable that the usefulness of the library would thereby be enpanced. We would like to ask what has been do.ne to rectify the evils which still exist. Books are still being taken froin the library and no record made of them. It is nearly as difficult to find books which are supposed to be in the libral'Y as it would be if there was no attempt made to classify them what- ever. There is about as much noise in tke various alcoves as there is in the gymnasium. \\Vhere is the remedy? It seems absurd to say that it is impossible to change the present condi- tion of things. The faculty apparently are un- able to make the change. The board of trustees of the college however could rectify the evil in one week, if it was their disposition to do so. It seems as if the old saying ''penny wise and pound foolish\ exactly characterized the present policy ·of the trustees. R. M.

Dr. George Alexander, '66, have been elected members of the cotntnittee of management of the Presby- terian Uniform Service Society. Dr. (1aymoQd's (.t}apel SermoQ. Dr. Raymond spoke in the chapel last Sunday afternoon. His subject was chosen from 1 Thes. 5-20. ''Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.\ In the course ,of his remarks he said, we should test prophesying. Pr.ophecy in the bible is a form of preaching and looks to the future. What we need above all else is truth. Con- fidence is begotten of present tests. Truth is · from present tests. 'rhe gospel is not affected by popular prejudice. We need that thought now because ofpopular prej-udice. We ought not to be secretly against the truth. If christianity is true we want it though all the world be against it. The need of men is not so much willingr..ess to accept truth as to test it • It is not necessary for the mind to comprehend divine love. There are tnany forces of nature we do not understand. We do not understand heat perfectly yet '\-Ve do not refuse to be warmed. We experin1ent and then act. Christianity offers no belief but what can be established by experience. It bases its clain1s on its working powers. Seetning sound reason is put to flight by practical experiment. Reason falls before experience. This gives force to our text. Experience is the only satisfactory proof. Instead of discussing the possibility we should try it. We want to, '' Prove all things.\ After we have found something to be helpful we should cling to it with all our souls. [O\al aQd persol)al. W. J. Swart, Med.

He was a native of Charlton, Sara- toga County, N. Y., and was a direct descendant of the French Hugenot, Count of Conde. He was one of the company of thirty-six mission- aries who sailed from Boston in 1836 for the Sandwich Islands. Accon1panied by his wife he landed at Mani Island, made friends with the natives and remained twenty years teaching and preaching. His wife died there in 1856, and soon after he returned to America. The degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred upon him by his Alma Mater in r869. . Alex8nder Seward, '36, died at his hom·e in Utica, Sunday Morning, March 14, in the 82nd year of his age. Mr. Seward entered the class of 1835 at Hamilton College when he was fifteen years old. He remained there two years and then entered Union in the class of 1836. He was a 1nember of the Sigma Phi fraternity and was also one of the Phi Beta Kappa men of his class. After leaving college he studied law and was admitted to the bar at Utica 1n 1839· He was . given the degree of Master of Arts by flamilton College in 1840. In the early forties, Mr. Seward engaged in journalism and became editor and proprietor of the Utica Gazette, the first daily paper of that city, which was later merged with the Utica Daily Herold. From March, I85o, to June, 1851, Mr. Seward was proprietor and editor of the State Reglster of Albany, where he lived during that period. He then returned to Utica and journalism, but soon retired from the profession and resumed the practice of law, which he continued until r887, when his partner of nearly thirty years, l-Ion. E. S. Brayton, died. He then disposed of his law business and retired from active life. Alexander Seward was one of the most honored~ esteemed and respected citizens of Utica. Rev. J. V. Wemple, '92, of Ballston C.entre, was on the hill Monday, March 15.

THE OONOORDIENSIS. . . . 5 51]e ~ollegt( Year-Boo~. The College Year-Book published by Stone and Kitnball has recently made its appearance. As a hook of reference it is invaluable. Beside containing an accurate account of every col- legiate institution in the country, it has I 50 pages devoted to miscellaneous information. The following headings which are found under \ miscellany \ show the extent of the infonna- tion contained in the little volun1n: Degrees, college fraternities, college colors, college cheers and yells, college publications, old uni- versities, college politics, matriculation, univer- sity extension, statistics of education, statistics of illiteracy, intercollegiate debates, athletic record. The alumni banquet of the Albany School of . Phannacy was held at the Delevan, Albany, Tuesday evening, M-arch 16. Pres. A. V. V. Raymond was present and responded to the toast, \ Old Union.\ He spoke of the advantages of a university training and urged a closer union between the graduate departments at Albany and the college. The Sophomore Quartette, composed of Green, Wiley\ Mac Mahon and Eames added to the pleasure of the evening by singing many of the songs of Old Union. The pharmacists were very enthusiastic and compelled the quartette to respond to many encores. · At the close of the banquet the president of the association moved that a rising vote of thanks be extended to the quartette, and the ban- quet broke up in the midst of great enthusiasm for the welfare of the School of Phannacy and Old Union.

Princeton's elegant new library is fast nearing completion, and it is the intention to have the whole building ready for use by the opening of the next college year. The building when con1pleted will represent an outlay of about $6oo,ooo, and Princeton will then have a library equalled in this country by none, unless it be the Boston Public Library, and the Congressional Library at Washington. The building, which will include stack, work, delivery and seminary rooms, is to be in the shape of a hollow rectangle, r66x155 feet, the sides being about 40 feet through, with a neck 50x25 feet~ to connect the new building with the Chancellor Green Library. The total dimensions, then, are 216xr55 feet. The stack will be five stories· in height, one below the level of the delivery rootn and one on the same level. A feature of this library will be the seminary rooms, eighteen in num- ber, situated near three corners of the quadrangle. Some of the features of the ne'\v building will be the systems of electric elevators, book-lifts, pneumatic tubes and interior telephones. An underground trolley system running north and south will convey the books from one side of the court to the other. Some idea of the enormous capacity of the building may be gathered from the fact that there will be thirty-two miles of shelving. The style of architecture is somewha·t like that of the English universities, and will har~ monize well with that of the other buildings.- Cornell .Dally Sun.

THE manager is again compelled to announce that the treasury is empty and bills are fast acm1mulating. All whose subscriptions are due are requested to pay up immediately. THE indoor meet, v;hich was held last evening, in the armory, was interesting front start to finish. The interest which was manifested by the under class men is indeed commendable. O'Neil, '97, lowered the college Indoor record in the 44:0 yard dash. Wright, '99, run his mile in excellent form and had a lap to spare in the finish over his sharpest competitor. Many other contestants showed the result of long and systematic training. WITHIN a few weeks, the weather will have moderated sufficiently to allow the golf players, .again, to invade the pasture. If the same interest is taken in the game this spring, as ·was last fall, there is every reason to expect the development of a golf team, which would be capable of com~ peting successfully against simila.r clubs from other college.s. A few inter-collegiate golf games, during the spring term, would prov,e a most inter-. esting diversion. Prof. G. 13. Edwa1·ds, who is secretary of the club, 1na.y already have con- sidered the advisability of such a programme, if not, it is offered as a suggestion by THE CoNCOR- DIENSIS. ON TUESPAY evening of this wee·k, a large audience assembled in the Methodist church of this city, to hear the concert, which was rendered by the musical clubs of the college. We under- stand that the entertainrnent was a. financial suc- cess, and that the ainount of n1oney realized ex- ceeded the expectations of the most sanguine. We do not begrudge the adherents of this church any pecuniary advantage which n1~y l1ave re· sulted from this concert. In fact, their success is our success. We are· cognizant of the methods e1nployed by chut·ch societies for raising· funds, and realize that such methods only work in con- nection 'vith churches in general. The point we wish to raise, however, is this: Why was there not a similar interest manifested by at least a few of these worthy church people, when the musical clubs gave their concert in January'? The fact, t that the musical clubs rec~ived a nominal sun1. for ,their services on Tuesday last, does not, in any way, ,effect the point under discussion. If the people of Schenectady, irrespective of their church affiliations, expect the hearty co-operation of the students on occasions, such as the one in question, they must show an active iuterest in entertainn1ents, which are given under the aus- pices of the college organizations. THE '98 (}a1·net was completed yesterday. To- day they will be distributed to those who were fortunate enough to have sent in their orders early. Every number has already been sold and one hundred more copies could have been dis- posed of without difficulty. 'Ve are pleased to note the dedication of the volume to Professor Sidney G. Ashmore whose keen interest in the affairs of tbe college as well as his universal good will towards the students make him the logical recipient of every honor within the power of the student body to award. l'Yir. Charles D. Gl'iffith, as editor-in-chief, has labored unceasingly in the work of compilation and deserves to be congratulated upon the result. A hasty glance at the literary department shows the master hand of our co-worker, Mr. Perley Poo1·e Sheehan who needs no introduction to those who have interested themselves in the literary efforts of the students of this college.

Manager Willia~s has perfected all the necessary arrangements for the trip of the base ball team to New York City and vicinity. During the past few weeks a large number of men have been practicing continually in the gymnasium. On Thursday afternoon for the first time they were enabled, by the clemency of , the weather, to practice a little on the campus. The practice on Friday, Saturday and Monday showed the tean1 to be in as good condition as could be expected. The instructions given by coach White in the early part of the season tended to greatly improve the 1nen in their manner of receiving and delivering the ball. On Tuesday evening the tea1n will leave for New York. They will take the Albany night boat down and it is expected that a number of students not on the team will acco1npany them. While in New Yorl{ they will stop at the Ash- land Hotel which is on the corner of 4th Avenue and 24th Street. On Wednesday the team will play the New York Un.iversi ty nine at University Heights. On Thursday they play Fordham at Fordhan1. On Friday they play Manhattan College on the Manhattan College grounds. On Saturday they will play the Princeton teatn at Princeton. The team will pt·obably return Sunday night by the night boat. Fron1 New York to Princeton the team will ~ be accompanied by the following men : Gatnbee, Hegetnan, Hornsby and Scofield. The make-up of the team has not as yet been definitely decided upon. Captain Parsons says that he intends to try the men in as many different places as possible so as to be able to judge which position a man is best qualified to fill . .. Captain Parsons will probably pitch in Wednesday's gatne with New York University. He will play in the field on other occasions. Catnpbelltnay pitch part of one or two gatnes. He will also be given an opportunity to show what he can do on ist base. Wiley will be tried at 1st base and in the fi,eld. It is hoped that he will prove a strong and sure batter during the trip. Purchase will probably play at short-stop in most of the games. Stewart will catch in the New York University and Fordha1n games. French, 1900, will he tried both at 2nd and 3rd base. Edwards will play in the field. W. L. Smith will also play in the field. F. M. Davis will show what he can do on 3rd base and also in the field. Thatcher will pitch in the Fordham and Princeton gatnes. Quinlan, who leaves Albany Thursday, being detained by examinations . at the Medical, will catch in the Manhattan and Princeton games. Though the tean1 may not have the support of one or two star players as it has had in the past, yet, as a whole, the team this year bids fair to be fully as strong as any team developed at Union for several years. flmllsemeiJtS at tl]e Vaf} ~urler.

4 THE OONOORDIENSIS. Obituary. A cable dispatch was received March 24, an- nouncing the sudden death from, heart disease of Howard Potter, '46, at No .. 18 Grosvenor Garden, S. W ., London England. JVIr. Potter was a brother ·of Bishop Henry C. Potter, of ... this city, a son of the late Bishop Alonzo Potter; of Pennsylvania, and a nephew of the late Right Rev. Dr. Hot·atio Potter, who was Bishop of New York. He was born in r8z6 in Schenec- tady, at Union College, of which his grand- father,. the Rev. Dr. Eliphalet Nott was presi- dent, and h.is father, afterwards Bishop of Penn- sylvania, was vice-president. About forty-five years ago he was wedded to Mary Louisa Brown, a daughter of the late James Brown, who was formerly the head of the well-known banking firm of Brown Brothers & Co. Mr. Potter had been an active partner of. Brown Brothers & Co. and Bt·own, Shipley & Co. for many years, and for the last ten years had lived with his wife in London, and acted as the managing partner. He was preparing to return to this country at the time of his death on a customary annual visit. He was for many years a trustee of the Chil- dren's Aid Society in this city; was president of the Orthopedic Dispensary ; president of the Niagara Park Association; treasurer of the Sanitary Commission in the Rebellion ; a trus- tee of Union College ; a director of the London and Westminster Bank ; a director of the Lon- don Assurance Company, and of many other financial in2titutions, both at home and abroad. His brothers were the late Congressman Clark- son N. Potter, the late Genetal Robert B. Potter, ofthe 9th Army Corps, the first man to cross the bridge at Antietam; Edward Tucker- man Pott~r, the architect; Bishop Henry C. Potter and the Rev. Dr. Eliphalet N. Potter, fonnerly president of Union and Hobart col- leges. His sister is Mrs. Launt Thompson, wife of the noted sculptor, who lives in Florence, Italy. He also had three half-brothers, who survive him. They are Colonel J. Nelson Potter, who lives abroad; William Applegate Potter, an architect and Frank Hunter Potter. The surviving children of Mr. and Mrs. Pot- ter are Jatnes Brown Pottet, of No. 52 Park avenue ; Mrs. J. Kennedy Tod, Mrs. Clarence Cary, Miss Grace Potter, Miss Bertha Potter and Ashton Potter. J. B. Potter will sail for London to-day to join his mother and make ar- rangenlents for the funeral.- New 10r k Tr-i- bune. ~remat:iol] by 1900. Throughout Friday afternoon various groups of Freshmen were noticed congregating at different places. Sometimes three or four were seen together in front of the colleges or on the can1pus, again they were noticed on the street corners. A spirit of mystery pervaded their actions and no amount of catechising could in- duce then1 to tell what they contemplated doing. About three o'clock Saturday morning three or four we1·e noticed busily engaged in pasting bills upon all the available electric light poles and fences in the vicinity of the college. The bill ofienders were evidently afraid of the Sche- nectady police force as they quickly disappeared when any one came in sight. When morning came the object of their misdeeds was found to be a flaming red poster which read as follows : ,, ' In Com1nen1oration of Y e Cremation of Y e accursed Algebra on Friday, March z6,, by Y e Class of r goo. \ Between three and four o'clocl{ in the morning the members of the faculty and the few re- lnaining students in college we1·e awakened by the~· blowing of tin horns and the discordant singing of college songs. The members of the class \vho had ren1ained to carry out the cere- monies of cremation, which has not occurred since '91, bore a coffin containing AI. G. Bra to the mound in front of the 1·ound building. ·'.rhen, after fitting ceremonies such as the sing- ing of the class song, reciting the poem, praying and orating, the coffin was burned. The class of I 900 had their cren1ation to be sure, but they omitted an important feature of the old ceremony, namely, the fight with the Sophomores.

·THE C·ONCORDIENSIS. At a recent tneeting of the student body at Williams, it was decided to put the manage .. ment of athletics in the hands of a comn1ittee of nine, con1posed of three faculty,. three alumni . 2nd three undergraduate members. While the Cornell scientific party was in Greenland last summer, a collection of botani- specitnens was n1ade which on classification, proves to contain several hundred rare and val- uable species. Duplicate speci.tnens will he . furnished to several tnuseums. 'rhe collection includes specimens of full-grown forest trees which are less than three inches in height. ' Students of the Sheffield Scientific school . have petitioned the Yale faculty for an exten- sion of the three years to a :tour years course, claiming, among other things, that insufficient pt·eparation is given, especially in the engineer- ing courses, for an entrance upon life work, and that they are ~ompelled to compete with those who have spent four years in the same profes- sion in other schools. Much dissatisfaction is being shown among the larger institutions and colleges, which as a unit, are opposed to the clause in the proposed new tariff bill, which places an hnport duty on all books and scientific apparatus brought frotn foreign countries. It is claimed by the defend- ants that if such books and appat·atus intended for college use be taxed, the injury done to the cause of education would greatly outweigh all the possible revenue con~iderations. TIJe Sei]ior <elass Boo~. The Senior class book, which is in process of construction, will differ materially from those which have been published within the last few years. Heretofore it has been the custo1n to have the pictures printed from half-tone cuts. This year all the pictures in the book will be photographs. Photographer Wheaton has the contract for furnishing the pictures. Already the book bids fair to be a great success as Mr. Wheaton has succeeded in getting excellent pho- tographs from nearly every man in the class. These, together with the· other pictures which have been taken of the ,college buildings and surroundings, will constitute the book which in after years will be a rnost valued memento of the class of '97 . Tl]e .flmsterdam ~oQeert. 'I'he IY.Iusical Clubs made an enjoyable and successful trip to Atnsterclam last Friday Even- ing. A large portion of the cluhs was enter- tained by Hoit, '99· The concert was given in the Y. M. C. A. I-I all and almost every seat was occupied. The audience was very select, and the way in which they manifested their appreciation shows that the concert was by no means.an inferior one. In fact, the clubs made as great an impression on Amsterdam as they have already made on Albany, Canajoharie and wherevet· they have been. We are already promised a cordial reception for next year, and our hitherto unenviable reputation at that place has been changed materially. A dance which had been arranged with a great deal of care, \vas given up at the last moment through a lnis- take. A great deal of disappointment was felt on both sides, but as a result we a1·e assured of one next year which will 1nake up for both years. The concert was, in detail, very much the same as those given elsewhere. The Glee club was especially well received. The Banjo club was quite a favorite, owing to the presence on it of four Amsterdarn n1en. Mr. Cook's recita- tions were again an enjoyable feature and were heartily encored. Both the Amsterdam papers praised the con- cert in glowing terms, and the Sentt\nel usually a very severe critic, was unstinted in its praise. Anthony W. Atwood, '63, a lawyer and well known writer of PhiJadel phia, is the editor of a new publication called, Water and Fz·re Servlce 'Journal. The subject matter is both interesting and instructive and treats of hydraulic engineer- ing, fire protection and municipal engineering.

ON THURSDAY afternoon, a petition was sent to the faculty by the members of the Senior class requesting clemency in regat·d to a certain action of discipline, which emanated from that body a short time ago. THE CoNCORDIENSIS, represent- ing the majority of the undergraduates, hopes that the petition presented to it by the Senior class, will be granted. In thus expressing our- selves, we do not wish to be understood as in any way championing the cause of the student who has been thus disciplined. VVe wish only that to all men just treatment may be the result of their misdeeds, and that no one. because of lack of in- fluence will be dealt with more severely than another. THE recent action, or rather lack of action, of the Sophomore class in reference to their so called honor system, furnishes a topic for editorial com- ment. There are certain features of the question in hand which tend to make a just criticism of \ ' it a soinewbat difficult undertaking. In discussing the action of the class, we ask a few . questions which appear in proper sequence and \<Which are pertinent. \\Viii an honor system ever prove suceessful, which is instituted as a result of outside pressure and which is at variance with the sentiment of those who ·would co1ne under its requirements'? Our ansvver to the above question is most ,e1n- phatically, No. The success of all undertakings which are of a revolutionary character, is dependent upon the unanimity of those interested. The undertaking was on thi,s ground alone a predestined failure. Will an honor systen1 ever prove successful which is instituted by but one class in an institution where it, has been an established system of the faculty to exercise a sort of police oversight, and where the students have long regarded such a system as a cheat-if-you-can challenge ? We again answer most e;rnphatically No. And it is right here that the operation of the honor systen1 in the Sophomore class first :£aiied. On various occasions, some members of the other classes in college took son1e of their examinations with the Sophomore class. To their discredit they, not considering themselves bound by the rule of the Sophomore class, chose to clasS' them- selves vdth the cheat-if-you-can faction. 1Veak- kneed Sophon1ores fell under their influence, and the first break in the honor rule of the class ·was n1ade. In regaid to the propriety of the recent action of the class, there is a diversity of opinion.. The question to be answered is as follows: Were the minority of the class justified in sending their notification t0 the faculty to the e:ffect that they were no longer under the honor system. ? We think they were and furthermore, even though we regret the failure ·of the undertaking, we think the class as a whole, was justified in declaring against an honor systen1 which was not the uua,ni- mous sentiment of the class. The efforts of the Sophomore class, however have not been entirely futile. This action in. es- tablishing an honor system as a class, created a healthy sentiment in the college as a whole, whieh has been steadily increasing, and we feel that the student body are about ready to take the IDatter in hand and settle it for good. CLOS11~LY follo-wing the action of the Sophomore class coroes that of the Seniors. A coiumittee baR been appointed to investigate the sentiment of the student body as a whole, in regard to the es- tablishtnent of an honor system, to govern all branches of college work, and also to inqui:re into the metbods and workings of such systems as have been adopted in other institutions . The question will receive the n1ost carefu.l con-

THE OONOORDIE'NSIS . .sideration before any definite action will he taken. If they deem the sentiment in college to be suffi- ciently strong to suppoTt an honor system and to properly execute it, a draft will be 1nade of such rules and provisions as they may consider most appropriate to the case in hand. The committee will then place their proposition before the faculty, and if that body deem it wise to grant ·the concessions desired, the matter will probably be concluded to the satisfaction of every one. THE class of 1900 is certajnly tile most unique .aggregation in college. 'They are determined to maintain all of the time-honored customs of the institution, even though they have to spend a portion of their vacations in Schenectady. La,st fall they decided to have a banq u.et. How they were to thwart the Sophomores, was a difficult probiemn to solve. They put their heads to- gether and finally conceived a n1ost ingenious -scheme. They would hold their banquet during the election recess. It was a capital idea. By it they did away with all the figbttng with the Sophomores wl1ich for years has been a feature of the annual Fresbrnan banquet. Each timid Freshman was thus enabled to proceed unmo- lested to the Edison a,nd enjoy the repast without the distracting anticipation of running the gaunt- let on the way borne. He could listen to the .speeches, wherein the class of 1900 was glorified, and could laugh and shout with joy ~hen the elass was extolled for the way in which they had out witted the Sophon1ores. 'Vhen the time came .around to celebrate the completion of the algebra by the ancient custom of cremation, they remem- bered ho'v they had outwitted the Sophomores in the fall before. They therfore determined to have the cremation at any cost. They waited until the Sophomores bad left college on their Easter vaca- tion, and then between three and four in the morning, when the ca1npus was in possession of a few stray cats, they stole silently forth a,nd held the ceremonies attending the c1·ernation of the algebra. Again they had outwitted the Sopho- mores. They. probably will be able to apply, successfully, this ingenious scheme throughout tl1eir entire course. We expect that they vvill petition the faculty in their Senior year to allow them to hold their commencement exercises during the summer vacation, so that they will be in no way disturbed by the under classes. Dean Ripton has resumed his duties as dean and will take up his class room duties next term. ·yale defeated Pennsylvania last Saturday in basket ball. Lehigh is to have a new laboratory which will cost .$2oo,ooo. The baseball debt at Cornell has been an- nounced as $1 ,3oo, the naval deficit, $6oo, and the football surplus, $2,6oo. An additional chair of professor of law has. been established in the law department of the Uni~versity of Pennsylvania. The richest college in the country is Girard in Philadelphia. Its endowrnent atnounts to over eleven and a quarter millions. Princeton's athletic tnanager has issued the· foUowing staternent: Receipts $33,746.70; ex- penditures $32,274·07; balance $r ,472.63. Coach Lehtnann arrived at Cambridge last week, frotn England, and will ren1ain with the Harvard crew until after t-he great triangular race in June. Efforts are being 1nade to start a college 'paper in Johns Hopkins, at present the only large institution in the country which has no student publication . Among the cotumendable features of theY ale- Harvard five-year agreement in athletics is that all the events, except rowing, are to take place on college grounds. Work will be begun itntnediately on a new Cheri1ical Laboratory for the Medical College at Adelbett. It will be directly south of the present building and will be three stories high. The new dormitory to be erected at Columbia will be named for Alexander Hamilton, who graduated fro1n King's College, the institution fron1 which Columbia University has grown. 'The s1nallest as well as the largeBt university in the world is in Africa. The smallest has five students and fifteen instructors; the largest, which is situated at Cairo, Egypt, has ten thousand students.
