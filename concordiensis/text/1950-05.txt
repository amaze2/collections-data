Simons was elected president of the class of .1951 in the elections held . Monday and Tuesday, which were sparked by a large fiU'!P-- ber of write-in votes. Leslie F. {.Jouch was elected presi- dent of the class of 1952, and J' ohn S. Moses was elected president of the class of 1953. RICHARD 0 .. DAVIS, Wolfgang .r. Riemer and Robert H. Horn were chosen to fill the positions of vice-president, searetary, and treas- urer, respectively, of the class of 1951. Spencer K. Warnick, Ken- neth Schneelock, and Stanley G. Pesahel were elected to the offices of vice-president, secretary, and treasurer, respectively, of neKt year~s junior class. David S. Lent, William .R. Holzapfel, and Michael L. Wolfe were elected vice-presi- dent, secretary, and treasurer, re- spectively, of the class of 1953. Peschel, candidate for the office of the treasurer of the class of '52, and Holzapfel, candidates for the office of secretary were both un- opposed, but write-in votes, in both cases, kept the elections from be- ing unanimous. Most important of the write-in V·O•t.es were those con- cerning Caryle J. Sherwin, who re- ceived a total of 38 votes for the, office of president of the class of 1951. It might be interesting to note that Sherwin also received one vote for the office of treasurer of the class of '51. Student Council Candidates Class of 1951 James H. Carmichael Frederiak S.

Mr. Webb, in a recent statement, said \A few students want a quiet place to study and we are going to try to give it to them. We haven't decided just what solution we are going to make. It would help if the students who really want space, private and quiet, would sign up in the library as to what hours t}ley want a reserved space from now until June.

We Children THE SACRED COW SOCIAL CUSTOM ..... - Cartoon by Somdal, court~sy \The Clipsheot The Mundt Bill By Monroe ·Silverman FRIDAY, MAY$. 1950 Letter To Whon;l It May Concern: We, the undersigned,. clapped· our ·chubby little hands in hearty approval of the· steps taken ·by the library staff toward protecting the ,valUable .periodicals located in the balcony. This will protect for '~poster.ity the Proceedings of the Royal Academy (1914) and the Program of the Scbenect!idy Civic Players (1933} from the vi'cious attacks of a certain element of the st1,1dent body which is undoubtedly Cornmuilist- 'backed. WE, FEELING the action of removing the tables and chairs from the balcony to. b~· only a partial ·solution to the problem, offer the following ·suggestions :dedicated to the betterment and improvement of the library: 1, Since we tried cutting pi'ct1,1.res o-qt of periodicals with taqles and chairs and were unsucc~ssf'ul, we have decided that other jngenious means must have been UE;ed. Therefore, we recommend that two guards · .be stationed ait each staircase leading to the balcony equipped with radar to detect con~ea:Ied scissQr.s and razors. Since the students ·Can- not be made to check their fingers at the desk, we suggest that a · ,guard circl'e the balcony at a:U times. 2: AS TO THE PROGRAM of punishing the whole student body · for the acts QE a few, we recommend that the library in .the future · does not lend books out. .Some 'books in the past and present have been ·:known to disappear. By not allowing the students to carry books in and out of the library,, we could stop this ·ev.il practice. 3: We also recommer1d raising the shelves in the catacombs tinder the library two feet higher. Since 75% .of them have already been raised to a height which makes it ~mpossible to sit and write, the · .students will not feel this to be an affront to them. But the shelves have been placed at a dangerous height; .students c::~,n still rest books . or magazines· on them and see which pages they are tearing out. If . they were higher it would give less inQ.ucement to destructive acts. 4'. THIS NEXT PROPOSAL may seem foolish at first, but it has '.great possibilities. Let's close the library entirely. If' none but the Hbrar:V staff c0uld touch the objects in the Iil:irary, we would have the neatest library in the country. We would·. be famous for perfect books and periodicals upon which there wouldn't be a finger mark. Each book would be in its place, and even the magazines wouldn't pe out of their respective places. We :would have the only library in the · world where everything was in it:> proper place and so arranged to , ad(j. beauty to the soon-to-be-historic spot. If someone wanted a book · it would .surely be there and intact, but to keep the library at .this · high level it would be ·impossible to let anyone touch any of the books. . l'he cost of .running the library could be met by charging admission, as people would flock from the fat•flung corners of the world to . see our perfect library. We can hear them saying how lucky we should feel .to have a library with such flawless books and periodicals. 5. Since we will soon be famous for our library, maybe a new building can ·be financed some day and the new problem arise of ·what to d:o with the present site. We suggest an aquarium. This has :unlimited possibilities, and the conversion would be simple as few alterations would be necessary. This would also keep the .books neat American civil liberties are being threatened tod~y ·from and clean, and many of them. would make excellent homes for many sources; one of these sources is the Mundt- Ferguson- .fishes anyway. We still feel that l\1r. Webb our librarian was shooting Johnston bill, known as the Subversive Activities Control Act • first and asking questions later when he took out the alcove of 1950.

Here is hoping, however, that this prom theme is not taken too seriously. Union does not want a repetition of the midwest.college shooting or near death of a Manhattan chug-a-lugg-er at a neighboring college on the Finger Lakes. Nothing could be a more effective stopper to campus social life than such an \incident\. A full schedule has been prov.ided by the committee and they should he commended for a job well done. It should also be noted that Sunday morning Chapel service has .ah\·ays been a traditional part of any Union weekend. We feel that it provides a fitting close to the activities which in a sense give those who are our guests on campus a better idea of the well rounded life at Union.

Stratton. Mr. Stratton has been featured quite often in those same newspapers in recent months. It has' brought the name of Union into the news. We feel, however, that his activities as councilman of the city of Schenectady have in a sense brought much of the thinking on the campus down out of the cloud of aloofness of political inaction. We · feel that l\Ir. Stratton has made some very definite con- tributions to campus. It is unfortunate that there is no further opening for him here as the papers quote the ad-. · ministration as saying~ but we are sure he will put his time to good use in the local political arena.

About Letters We were pleasantly surprised to see the large number of letters reaching this office within the last few days. To us it is not only an \indication that pople are aware of campus activities but also that they feel students read our columns. Union A Howard Two letters we think deserve special notice and comment. Herman Nickel's idea of a Union-Howard exchange is a good one which deserves careful attention by the administration as well as by students. We would recommend this matter to the ene1·getic competency of the chaplain. Quota As to the mattee of the alleged \quota system\ we would refer the careful reader to a story on the front page. It would appear from the information secured that the attempt to gain a wide geographical distribution of Union students should not be viewed as a \quota system\ with all its con- notations of racial and religious discrimination. We think looking under beds for bogeymen is far from constructive work. This case of the geographical distribution is not a definite policy of religious exclusion. Letter To The Editor Dear Editor: . I ~m .surprised that the Concordiensis which is always looking for P<ltlort:!( l\~ll\\ h'ls had no comment to Ill<.tkt.: vn the quutu. ::;ystem which was proposed two weeks ago. In the absence of editorial dili- gence, I find it necessary to point out that the geographical quota system is a neat and often-used device for restricting the number of Jewish students. It would be nice to suppose that the administration does not realize what it is doing, but I cannot allow them that much naivete. All I. can say is that a college like Union is expected to have a quota system-the fact that it has not over the past few years is surprising. The question is why must the administration insult our intelligence by attempts to hoodwink us? No one is fooled. Glowing phrases in the catalog like \Union College was the child of. a new national d.e~ocracy, and its organizational structure is today bmlt upon the conviCtiOn that only by living together in a democratic college environment can students Jearn to become citizens of a democratic America\ belie the truth about the college. And then the biting irony of this: \Only as these various branches (i.e. stud~nts,, faculty, administration, trustees) work together in mutual under- standing and with free access one to another can individual freedom be preserved and a democratic society fun<'tion effectively'• is too much to stomach. Dear Sir: Sincerely, Jim Murray Aided and abbetted by: Hugh MontgomPry, Riehard BodP, Ronald Tu<'lter I.n~t Y<>~r Y~lc· T .. 'nivcrs!ty entered into a·n exchange program with Ho\:n rd TTnlvrr~ity in ~Vn~hington D. C., America's largest Negro uni- versity. The plan provides for a number of students from Yale to go to Ho'l\·ard for an extended w.eekend. while an equal number of Howard students come to Yale. The r eccption of this program at ·both Yale and Howard was excellent. IT SEEMS to me> that here is an idea for those who complain about the complacency and the lack of social consciousness at Union. Here is something tangible which would only involve a relatively small fin- ancial committment: the train or busfare to and from Washington. Our visitors could be put up in fraternity houses and dorms. Here at Union we have proved the value of international exchange. But there is at least equal need in the field of interracial relations. In this field more than in any other democracy has a lot of unfinished business. We, as students, have a special obligation to do something about ~- · THIS IDEA needs student support. Let's think it over, and then let's do something about it-student council, Concordy, fraternities and each one of us. Sincerely yours, To the Editor of the Concordiensis: HerllllUl Nickel P.S.

A step toward inaugurating and instruction at Union has been taken by the local Christian association. which for two semesters has been sponsoring a series of extracu r- ricular, non-credit courses in ccurt- ship and marriage.

The rathskeiler also noted that it had paid off the loan from the studel)t tax c-ommittee. Considerable discussion concern. iilg the feasibility of joining the : National Student association was held. Various plans· for raising the nece$sary funds to join were dis· ' cussed. The matter was tabtec · until the next meeting. A DECREASE in revenue would mean one less issue of the >Idol would be published a year. There wpuld be no more six page issues .of the Concordiensis, prom or other special feature issues. 'The ,l;iand would be aple to accompany the football team on only two away games, games at which the bandmen are prac .tically Union's whole cheering section, WRUC would· have to curtail purchase of popular records. The major- share of student tax funds goes towards campus publications. This amount is supplemented by a! almost equal amount from advertising, an alil·ount which it would be very difficult· to increase: there are at least eight sources of com- petition for local ads among campus organizations at p~esent. TO }\fAKE THE publications situation even more difficult, pr.intlng costs will be substantially increased next year over present rates. 'rhe Concordiensis faces an increase in printing costs of $650. The Idol, Garnet and other publications will have the same problem of trying to balance. ·budgets with a 17% per- cent decrease in revenue and a 15.4 .percent increase in costs. If the activities tax is increased to $20 a year as recom- mended, some $4000 will be added to the student tax fund, ap· proximately compensating for the decreased number of students. Without the increase in the student tax rate, activities woul4 be worlting with operating budgets which would not allow for .building up ,of a sur.plus. Surpluses in the :past have been used for long range, large projects, .as the remodeling of WRUC and the Mountebanks theater.

WHALEN To 'Wolfgang Riemer, Editor of Concmdiensis and Don Cregier. Gentlemen: I was very much interested by your article on page four of last week's Concordy, entitled \Sex Instruction Gains In College Curricula.\ Because I am interested in teaching Marriage and Family Relations on a college level, I read the article with great interest. THE FIELD OF inst.Puction~no, helpful guidance-towards malting IT IS PROBABLY totally unnecessary to point out that gripeitus is ''far more common in children than in mature adults. That this vicious :diease is so common at Union College js indeed unfortunate.

The new student council at its last meeting considet•ed the recommendation of the previous council and in a similar manner asked the board of trustees to increase the student activities tax by two dollars each term.

Theeouncil acted, it seems to us, in a fair and considered manner ag responsible representative body concerned with the faie of student activities here at Union. We would refer the reader to the fwnt page where there -can be found a sum- mary of the reasons and facts that motivated the action. We cannot over emphasize the role of activities in a small college. Lnion 1 has been very fortunate in being able to provide, for its students, the benefits of such a varied and excellent activities program as it has. Every reasonable effort should be made to keep that program at its present level at least. The increase does little more than this. Plaudits for Mountebanks B~· Carl A.

Books that were written and published before 1935, some dating back to 1895, are entirely inadequate today. They take an out-moded view towards marriage in many respects, and do little or nothing to help the reader to form a constructive opinion towards marriage. How about .putting the newer, more reliable and informative books on the marriage shelf, instead of \How to be Happy Though Married?\ They'll do a lot more good. · Yours sincerely , JIM WICKMAN Dear Editor. Before this academic year comes to an end, we would li)J:e to tell you aoout a small organization which has met everywhere on campus. It has no constitution apart from one vague phrase about the general good of the members <both of us) and we are allotted no monies by the tax committee, but we have a suitable handshake, which is not quite secret, and we aJso have a prohibitive initiation fee (which, even when paid, we find insufficient for our financiaL needs). We had a third member until recently, but he had to be expelled. ~ We are worried that this little group will be halved at the end of this term, and alas, the Scottish Nationalist Party on Campus <S.N.P.O.C.) will be unable to continu~t shaking hands with each other. We appeal to any Scots or _potential Scots at Union to join wifh Kilty H. McSimons next year in his activities, which will be, as is traditional, to discuss the sartorial challenge \You cannot kick a ,Scotsman in the pants, for obvious reasons.\ Yours in sarcasm saeculorum IULTY H.

Another college year is coming to a ra:pid end. Only final exams remain before those glorious three months of recess begin, and the next year of school appears only in the dim future to most of us. But for some 363 seniors-the largest graduating class , in Union history-the routine of college life will be ended. And for neatly 300 high school .seniors, September will mean the beginning of a new experience in their lives. The college year just ended was, in some ways, an ordin- ary year, but in others it was a year that will not soon be forgotten. In an attempt to refresh the memories of Uniem men to the happenings-great and small-that took place during this 1949-50 year, and for the benefit of alumni, faculty and sub-freshmen who might be interested in a re- . view of the \triviata\ . that makes up college life, the Co:n- cordiensis has prepared this annual review issue. We have probably left out many points you might con- .sider important. Our hope is that we have at least begun to stir up some memories which will fill in the details and give you a few moments of pleasant reminiscing. Letters to the Editor • • •. \near Wolf: There ·has come to my attention in recent days the common sentiment around the campus that the Student Activities Keys awarded each year by the board of managers are given automatically to each man of terms six, seven, or eight who has been connected with an · activity for two years. :M;ay :r take this space in your Letters column to correct this misc·onception. · THE STUDENT Activity Keys are to be awarded to men who have those qualifications as a bare minimUJll> These qualifications do not in any way guarantee that men fulfilling them will receive keys. There are several reasons for this: In the first place the 'Student . Activities Budget simply will not allow the ~oard of Manag~rs to award keys to all of those who have served nominally for two years, . or even three or four years; in the second place, the more awards tQat are given-no matter what the awards may be-the less the award means to the recipient and to others who might aspire to the award; in the third place, it is my personal desire to 15ee that the awards are given for. honest hard work, leadership, goo/l.will, devo- . tion to duty, and for distinguished service above and beyond the average to the activity and to the college community as a whole. . These qualifications have been less and less observed of late and L----------------------------~ 1 the Key has fallen into disrepute from the lax way in which it has UNCONSTITUTIONAL '• been presented.

It increased its membership to about twenty-five, and this group maintained a radio program every two weeks, carried on parliamen- tary debates to develop open forums, and participated in many tournaments. The debaters met such colleges as Middlebury, Bow- doin, Hamilton, Wells, Williams. and Keuka in verbal duels. They were also host to the Albany Mock Assembly, and, incidentally, copped one of the awards.

A REPORT drawn up ·by the American Library Association states that \modern library philo- sophy does not believe in the 'safe- keeping' function of a library as being a primary activity, maintain- ing instead that 'the quicker the physical book wears out in legiti- mate service, the better.' In ac- cordance with this philosophy, the reader's comfort and convenience play an im:po.rtimt part in library administration.'' According to the Union College catalog, \the admin- i~:~tration of the Library is based on the thesis that the contact of stu- dents with books is one of the major fields of education.\

Brud Shaffer, Walt Causey.. Art Hagar, Dick Davis, Abe Lakshin, and Herb Hufnagel were probably the top individual athletes of the year, but none of them shone as Ken Whalen or Hal Enstice did the two previous years: JOHN McLAUGHRY said that this was a football team without a star. Some of them won in- dividual awards such as Sherwin and Speidel as third team and hon- orable mention respectively on the WilliamBon Little All America, Shaffer was third team AU East and Best was honorable mention A.P.

And that t('am included the same line plus Whalen, Pete Ten Eyck and Tony Coppola. who~e bnlliant diteclion of the of- fer-se and whu~e fine passing were vttal to the learn's ::;uccess. Gec•rge Best was the top runner and AI Wade and Bob Fletcher played ex- cellent defensive ba:ll.

Hobart was a 39-0 brPeze to set up Williams, the best team met all year. Union won 14-6 in the best played game of the season. Mid-. dlebury's spirit of revenge com- bined with absurd weather to tem- porarily halt Union, 14-14. The 66-24 swamping of Hamilton put the frostin~; on the undefeated cake.

Sam Hammer- strom one of the greatest backs Union ever boasted, was appointed to succeed McLaughry and the former Jamestown high coach con- ct_ucted a three weeks spring prac- tice. THE DUTCHMEN extended their stre<tk to thirteen games without a defeat as they raced through the third undefeated sea- son in Union annals and the first since 1939. They culminated Mc- Laughry's tenure as coach here by winning 16 of their last 19 games since they switched to the winged \T\ in mid-1947. Bob . Flech~r and Chuck Abba, defensive stars last year, were elected as co-captains of this year's team at the conclusion of the '49 season.

The Garnet scored 225 points to 70 for' their opponents. :Oave Strauss was leading ground gainer while GeD>rge Best was top scorer and also led in rushing. Best's feat was somwhat remarkable as he played the first half of the season on defense! McLAUGHBY had enough ma- terial to employ a two platoon sys- tem and only injuries added com- plications. Defensive end John DeBello was hurt early in the seE- son and he was unable to finish the year. Brud Shaffer, Scott Jackson, Oc•okie Sherwin, and Dick Speidel were out for a while but this year's club was loaded 'with outstanding talent.

THE LAST class containing a majority of veterans will be grad- uated in a few weeks. If we gen-. eralize, what is it about these men that has made this last four years unique? What are to be the effects\ of their absell,lle in the future? The outward signs of the vet-\ eran's years at college are common. enough. We have seen the 24-year- old freshman, heard of the stu- dent telling the professor that he has strayed from the ,fmbject, sympathized with the student who is cutting an exam because his wife has just had a baby, and marveled at the lasting power of G.I. lowcuts and O.D.'s. These things, and the myriads of others, form the details of the picture; taken altogether, they form a way of life. BUT MAINLY we are interested in trends, and more important, their casual background. The vet- eran, and again we must general- ize, came to college straight from a society where his every move had been plotted for him before him, and often by persons whom he considered much his inferior. No matter what his age, he was a man, and as a man responsible to authority right up to the limits of life and dPath. The years, during which he would normaJiy hav\e donned his grey flannels and played the college game, had been taken from him. He had met many strange people, and seen many strange things. These then, are some of the causes common to all of the veterans; what were the results? The vet at college was a more critical student than had ever been seen before. On unpleasantly fa- miliar terms with submission to blind authority, he was prone to question the dictums handed down from above. The old student-pro- fessor relationship was changed from a situation of the man talking to children, to that of the man talk- ing to men, and holding sway over these men simply by virtue of his own knowledge of the subject which he taught. Many of these men were married, and they were vitally interested in their place in the world. They came to college primarily . to prepare a way for themselves, and thus there was a great emphasis placed on facts and principles that were salted away for future reference. SCHOOL was a serious business to him, and it was attacked in the same spirit as any other job would have been. Of course all this was tempered in some degree by the traditional mores of college life, but all in all, the whole attitude toward the more serious, with a general lack of importance attached to the frills of collegiate existence S .
