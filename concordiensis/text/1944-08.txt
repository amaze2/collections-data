Cowles, Officer in Charge, will be detached Thurs- day of this week and has orders to report to the Naval Air Primary Training Base at Dallas, Texas. On July 17 he completed a full year at Union. Lt. M. H. Taube, physical training Officer and Executive, has orders to report to the Navy Avia- tion Pre-Flight School at the State University of Iowa in Iowa City. Lt. Jackman, resident Naval Avia- tor, is still awaiting orders. In December, 1939, a civilian pilot training course was started at Union College as an extra-curricu- lar activity. .About 100 men took this course. M·any entered the fly- ing services as combat pilots, some became instructors, and others eventually became Feny Command and Air Transport Corps .pilots. In July, 1942, the program was changed to include only full time participation in two courses each eight weeks long. After three or four groups of mixed A1·my and Navy trainees completed this train- ing Union began training only pilots in the Navy V-5 program. The first of these trainees arived in April, 1943, from Flight Pre- paratory School. Since then a total of more than 500 men have been assigned to Union College. The com·se consisted of 240 hours of ground school instruction in Nav- igation, Aerology, Radio Code, Civil Air Regulations, and Aircraft Familiarization and Engines. Each day the trainees spent an hour and a half in physical training. This The War Training 'Schools pro- gram which provided civilian flight training for Naval Aviation Cadets throughout the country has been cancelled and is being replaced by flight training at regular Navy bases. The gt·ound school is to be taught during additional time at Flight Preparatory and Pre-Flight Schools. In a final statement Lt. Cowles said, \At the close of this pro- gram there were 19 schools in this Eastern Region. Over a period of eight months Union has stood high- est among the 19 in the average performance of the Cadets on ex- aminations. In some of the sessions the Cadets averaged as high as 90 per cent when the average through- out the region was only 70 per cent. Other proof which has caused the Regional Office to consider the Union units one of the best can be found in our inspection ratings both at the airport and on the campus. Most of the credit for this excellent reco1 d goes to Professor August Fox, Coordinator. His inti- mate knowledge of all the courses, his excellent teaching, and his care- ful attention to instructional and administrative detail have contrib- uted to the efficiency of our work.\ Professor Augustus Fox express- ed app1·eciation for Lt. Cowles' abil- ity to quickly gain the confidence of his men and inspire In them an understanding of their part in Naval activities. He said that the smooth cooperation between Navy and College athorities had been most gratifying. Lou Sebring, '23 Empire State Town , South Pacific War Meeting on Sunday Reporter Speaks Lou Sebring, a graduate of Union's class of 1923, was guest speaker at Wednesday's Chapel program. Before graduating with his Bachelor of Science degree, Lou worked for three years with the Gazette here in Schenectady. Leav- ing Scnenectady he went to Albany as Legislative correspondent where he spent four years. Migrating to New York he joined the staff of the New Yot·k Herald Tripune. For several years he contributed to many publications throughout the nation In 1935 he was made night city editor on the Herald Trib- une. In 1938 Lou. returned to Union to be awarded an honorary degree of Master of Letters. For the past few years he has been one of the top war corr'espondents in the Southwest Pacific theater. In his address to the students he stressed the fact that one of a war correspondent's main tasks is to send back news to the .families of men serving overseas. He encour- aged the future officers of V-12 to be friendly with the war corres- pondents which they may meet in their work to come. Lou made the statement, backed up by several high officials of the War Department, that the war in the Pacific, in all probability would not be over until well into 1947. To Feature Dr. J. S. Allen And W. A. Gillc:hrist for a Dsicussion on G.l. Rights Dr. John S. Allen, Director of Higher Education, State Education Department, and W. A. Gillchrist, Chief Vocational Rehabilitation Of- ·ficei· of the Veterans Administra- tion, will participate in the Em- pire State Town Meeting over radio station WGY on Sunday afternoon at 1:30 o'clock. The subject they will discuss is the G. I. Bill of Rights in general and opportuni- ties offered veterans in the field of education in particular. Mr. Gillchrist, who served over- seas in World War I and later at- tended the University of London, will report on the progress being Iuad·e by hundreds of veterans of the pr€sent war who have already taken advantage of the new Iaw.

Activities Sponsors §tudeml1t Actt:Iivntice§ First Autum.n Term Dan·ce ASCE Lecture Mr. Fred W. Fisch '18, engineer for· the Schenectady Bureau of Traffic and Civic Planning, gave an informal talk at the A.S.C.E. meeting last Wednesday night. The r·efreshmcnts and meeting place were furnished by Professor and Mr:;. Taylor. Du, ing the discussion, :Mr. Fisch explained various things connected with Schenectady. For one thing, he told the history of the \WALK\ signs you 'bump into downtown; and how it took two very Irish, Irish cops to get people to stop long enough to look at them. Mr. Fisch also gave a few hints as to some of the ideas for future development in this city. Could you imagine walking down by all the large stores on State Street, under .big rows of shade tt·ees; a much narrower State Street, with hardly any auto traffic on it? Could the people of this town ima- gine themselves parking their cars a block behind the main street. on ·big public parking lots when they wish to do some shopping? Mr. Fisch seems to be able to see these things as a possibility-even the last part that would make ev- eryone do a little more wa !king. In last week's Concordy, there was an announcement that the Civi.Js would be holding a dance on July 29, at the Sigma Chi House. For a bunch of engineers, It was a rather nice dance. Professor· and ............ \\¥\\'\\\\\ 1 Mrs. Hoadley, and Dr. lin big let- tel'S) and Mrs. Tom Male, found their way down. They wet·e sup- posed to chaperone. News from USO This weekend will prove a full one for all fellows who visit the USO. An informal recmd dance is planned fot· this Saturday night. This will start at 2030 and at 2330 the lights go out. Sunday, Aug. 6, through the Federation of Jewish Women, a buffet suppet· will be set·ved from 1700 to 2100.

Dr. Reiche replaces Mr. Jo·hnson who has re- turned to his work as head of the science department at the Sara- toga High school. The new physics lecturer comes from CCNY where he was instructor in physics since September 1942. Previous to his teaching at City College, he had lectured on classical and modern physics at the New York School for Social Research in New York City. Came to U. S. in 1941 '~~- 1 first published in German, but have now also appeared in English translations. At the present time he is working on a new book in collaboration with another physicist from Columbia University. that mike will do for Frankie's ~--o-~-- Educated in Germany D1·. Reiche was born in Berlin and attended the Franzoesisches Gymnasium-a 300-year-old high school founded by French refugees where most subjects are taught in French. After his graduation he went to the University of Munich where he studied physics, chem- istry, and mathematics under Roentgen, the discoverer of the X- ray, Bayer, and Lindemann. Afte1 two semesters at Munich he at- tended the University of Berlin where he studied under the well- known physicist Max Planck. He received his Ph.D. degree there in 1907. Following that he continued his studies at the University of Breslau from 1908 to 1911 under Professor Lummer. In 1913 he be- came instructor at the Berlin Uni- versity. Ft·om 1915 to 1918 he was assistant to Professor Planck. He served as advisot· to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for physics and voice!

The two rlesk lamps and the fom small top lamps seem inadequate to fumish sufficient light in the evening when n1uch of the work in the office on sturlent publications is done. As a result of these conditions, work on the pub- lications is handicapped. Staff members fre- quently suffer from e~·e strain. Although a suggestion has been made to the College authorities that improved light- ing facilities be installed, as ~·et no action has been taken. We are of the opinion that flourescent lights would be desiJ·able, but the installation of any additional lighting facilities would greatly improve the situation. We are fully aware of the great difficulties which the College authorities face today in the maintenance of the campus. We express the hope, however, that in H shCJrt time ade- quate lighting· facilities will be provided for the Activities Office. In recent years, more and more measm·es have been taken for the protection of one l of man's mosts precious possessions, his I eyes. The educational institutions of America have been in the vanguard of this movement. ~urely, there is no place for inadequate light- ing at Union. In Schenectady lfs for Shirts ATTENTION!

Lieutenant Kelly t·eported here May 28 to replace Lt. William Ebel'lein who is now doing Navy research work. Educator-Naval Offieer Hailing from Rhode Island, the Lieutenant, who has served as prin- cipal for many schools, has a fine educational background. He grat;l- uated f1 om La Salle Academy and then attended Providence College wnet e he received a Ph.D. From there ht went to Rhode Island Col- lege where his B.E. and M Ed. de- grees were awarded him. In cohet ence with Iils educational work, he was director of Visual Education for the state of Rhode Island for six years. He also served as state critic teacher and is now a member of the Barnard Club and the Principals Organization. When he enlisted in the Navy, he was first sent to Harvard for a period of three month~. after which he was sent to the Navy Yard in ViTashington, D. C., from which place he reported here. Organized NAC All the Navy men here at Union owe Lieutenant Kelly a vote of thanks for the work he did in or- ganizing the Naval Activities Com- mittee. It is due to this commit- tee's planning that dances and other activities have been and are being organized for the men of the V-12 Unit. We all hate to see the Lieutenant go, but since this new position is one of more importance and re- sponsibility, we wish him all the luck in the world. ----0>---- Big Plans for Fall Gridiron Formal To Be Discussed Now The possibility of a Gridon Dance on Oct. 7-the date of the last foot- ball game of the season-was dis- cussed at a meeting of the Student Council in the Old Chapel Thm·s- day evening. Members of the body were asked to find out if the stu- dents in their houses would be in- terested in the dance if the admis- sion fee was $3.60. Student Council representatives will make the sur- ''ey in the dorms and ships early next week. Members of the Council also dis- cussed a proposal for the establish- ment of a Student Activities Com- mittee. Chairman John Mann re- ported to the group a suggestion of Prof. Ketz that a cane rush be- tween the sophomores and fresh- men be held in .September. Robel t Opie, fr·eshman class pre~ident, brought to the attention of the Council that one member of the :wreshman Committee repre- sented 60 boys while another rep- sented 15 boys. He stated that the members of the Committee felt that in voting on important mat- ters that the larger ships should have more representatives. It was decided that a balance should be maintained between the civilian and navy students and that there- fore the present BYBtem should not be changed. A member of the Committee which drew up the plan for freshman class organization stated that the committee felt that the1·e should be more civilians on the Freshman Committee than navy men because the civilian freshmen were more interested in the college than the Navy fresh- men .• President John Mann announced that there would be a .meeting of the Council early next week.

CONGRATS GREEKS With the advent of the wartime accele- l\ated program at Union College, the l\lother of Fraternities, in July, 1943, the whole fratemity system stood to be revamped wi,th the result that is evideHt. Gone are the days of the gay house parties, rushing and the aged iustitution that we know of as HeH Week. Through- out it ail, however, the fratemity men among us have held m~ optimistic view- point. This is obvious when we view the func- tions of the remaining active fl•atemities at Union. Despite the greatest handicaps pos- sible to any fraternal organizations, of which all fraternity men are aware, many of the fraternities have successfully attempted to retain some semblance of organization thr·oughout this wartime period in the hope of retuming to a normal college life as the vig·orous and vital organizations that have existed for over 100 ;~-·ears. As the Concordy neted two weeks ago in this column, active social intercourse between freshmen and the \old timers\ is virtually impossible and seve- rely hampers the pledging process as it was originally established. However, the active fraternities have apparently ovet·come this disadvantage to the effect that many have kept a continual membership of about 10 or more brothers. V\Te fear however, that the normal frater:n- ity life as we knew it before the war wHI be non- existent for some time after the cmllege returns to its peace-time schedule. If the many houses could be restored withi-n the next year there would be great cause for despair. Regardless of the numbe1· of men in each chapter, we have not taken into con- sideration the fact that many of these me:n are members of the V-12 unit and conse- quently would not be at the school or would not be permitted to live in their respective houses unless the unit was so reorganized in order to allow subsistance living, which is high!~· improbable. Thus the houses would be returned in many cases to an organiza- tion of 3 or 4 civilians, the majority of whom have entered under accelerated conditions and who, unless phenomenally capable, would be far from 1·eady to take over the tremen- dous responsibility of running a house. This is a problem that must be overcome at the time it actually arises. In the meantime let us congmtulate those active fraternities that have attempted to continue the great fraternity legend Rnd tra- dition that began at Union and that must continue at Union to make this institution the great one it is today. l\Iay this policy be continued until we are again surrounded by the fnlternal life of old. THANKS TO NAC The entire student body, V-12s and civi- lians alike, are indebted to the Naval Ac- tivities Committee for the music, refresh- ments, and liberties enjoyed Saturday night, Invitations were extended to both civilians and service men. Civilians who did attend owe the N.A.C. a vote of thanks for this special favor. The Navy is also indebted to the Committee, for restricted men were allowed the privilege of liberty till 0100. We would like to thank personally the fol- lowing officers and men whose inititive and coope1·ation made the dance the success it was. Lt. Kelly, A/S H. H. Levy, A/S Bill Pahl, S. K. 1/c J. Klein, A/S Bob Tempton, and A/S AI Helm. I am sure we all appreciate the effort put forth by these men in pro- moting such a splendid dance. Those who attended the dance will tes- tify to the enjoyable time had by all. We hope the Committee will accept this opinion as representative of the interest the student body has in such social affairs and that it will continue to sponsor such delightful en- tertainment. MRS. PERKINS' GARDEN While the Chapel is being reconditioned, the lawns being mowed and repairs are being made all over the campus, there is one beauty spot that has not been touched. Mrs. Per- kins' Garden, though small, has always been a popular place to wile away a few peaceful hours. Now, the grass has grown over the paths, the shrubbery rs not trimmed and the lawn is not raked. With Jackson's Gar- dens getting all the attention, it seems that this small alcove of serenity is being left out. Cleaning the Garden would not require much time or energy; one man could do it in an afternoon. Visitors to Union are nu- merous and they should be shown the cam- pus at its best. With an unkempt spot m its very center, Union is not at its best. Something should be done about Mrs. Per- kins' Garden; in the hustle and hustle of an accelerated college the beauty should not be forgotten. LIGHTS IN LIBRARY A few months ago an editorial appeared criticising the deplorable lighting system m the Library. As seems to be the custom whenever a constructive criticism appears, it is ignored and nothing Is ever heard of it again. Well, just so that it won't be for- gotten we are repeating our previous cry for better lighting in the library. Particu- larly now, when the days are again becom- ing shorter, adequate lighting becomes hn- portant. So lets' see whether we can't im- prove the situation. A few lights in strategic places plus the removal of burned-out bulbs and the substitution of new ones will be enoug-h to satisfy everyone.

And the houses of the chosen people, and of the Pharisees, and I of those who did strive for learning did all take themselves unto this feast. i Now the people did gather about I and pa1-take of enjoyment through · games and j-ollity. The learned i keepers of knowledge pitted them- 1 selves against the chieftains of the 1 mere warlike tribes in a contest of! :;kiH. And there was a man present named Male ac-cording to the laws of his people and he was a worthy zr.an. And he did hearken unto the Babel that was all about him and he made his way unto a group of musicians and there was joy in his face as he did make merry. And he> bid these musicians to play and: they made joyful noises on harp 1 and psalter. Yea, some of them did 1 fall upon the ground and smite j their heads. j ThP Food Was Devoured I Now there was a broad table be- 1 side the fleld which had been builded in length twenty cubits and I in height two cubits. And this ta hie was groaning under the weight of many foodstuffs that had been gathered in from the fields and made ready for the hungry· throngs. And they did partake of this food which was furnished by a certain publican of the tribe of South. And there was more re- joicing and thanksgiving among the warriors when five score of women of the .neighboring village of Schenectady did arrive on the site of the feast. And the air was rent by \Hosa·nna\ as the lyres hegan to play. When the crumbs were gathered up from under the table and thanks had been given the musicians did r~ turn to their chores and musia did blare forth from the· cymbals and tr·umpets. And 1'hey M:adP Music Now there was a strange device over which learned youths did sweat until sounds were obtained from it. The youths did interrupt the musicians that were led by the ma·n named Male and there was joy in the brethren's faces as the music becameth wild arrd savage. The youthful sages of the village of Minerva did take unto them- selves partners that were of the women of Dorp and made merry through mad behavors that did ex- haust many and causeth them to become tired·. As the feast grew wilder the time .for the departure of the warriors grew nigh and many betook themselves to the house of Anthony where there are flasks of· many colors and -of many shapes and sizes filled with the juice of the hop plant which had been reaped but recently. And there was fiery handwriting on the wall that did say in magic letters \Beverwyck\ and \Pabst\. And it was here that many of the feasting group did flnisheth the night in peace. And He Was Wroth When the fateful -hour did come and the feasting was ended the publican of the tribe of South, did look over the scene of the orgy and arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down on the ground and worshipped the great gods to save him from such demons again. Visitors at :l,nspection Display l:ndi.fference For the past few months there have been many visitors to the campus on Saturday a.fternoons to witness Captain's Inspection and Review of the V-12 Unit. · Many of the same ones return week after week but still don't seem to realize that it is their national anthem that is being played when the College band str-ikes up \The Star Spangled Banner\. It is amazing that people can be so lax that they do not know the proper respect due to the Flag of the United States, espe- cially now when we have been at war fer almost three years. The attitude of most of the civ- ilians present is disgusting and degrading. When the band strikes the first chord, every service man in ranks snaps to attention: those not in ranks immediately salute, Despite the sprinkling of uniformed men in the crowd and the lines of rigid sailors, people still can not seem to take a hint as to the .proper behavior. Men stand casually smoking or talking; women remain seated, gazing placidly around while discussing the latest \news\. In most cases, hats are not even removed. In case some do not know- the proper position Is attention. The left hand should be at the side, the right hand holding the hat over the heart. If no hat is worn, both hands should be at the sides. Captain Raymond Gets Bronze Star Union Graduate Honored For Oubtanding Services Recently a brief announcement was made concerning the award- ing of the Bronze Star Medal to Captain William C. Raymond, 314 West State Street, Johnstown, fiz·st physician of that city to enter the service,._ Captain Raymond entez·ed the se1·vice Dec. 1. 1941, and after »pending abo\lt one and one-half months at Fort Leavitt, Maine, he left this country for the Pacific theatre of war. Once in the Pacific theatre he went directly to New Caledonia and was on Quadalcanal when the Marine:o went in during the sum- mer of 1942. When last heard from, Captain Raymond was on Bou- gainville. An Army Dispatch stated for for exceptionally meritorious and gallant service as an operating ur- geon during the height of Jap bombing and shelling at Bougain- ville, Captain Raymond has been awarded the Bronze Star. Disregarding his own safety, Captain Raymond at times operat- ed on bady wounded soldiers be-· fore provision was made for un- derground medical facilities. On .one occasion, he saved the lives of six patients-two of them criitically hurt by bomb frag- ments-by working at top speed during a two-hour period. An old Union College man. Cap- tain Raymond is in his 30th month overseas with this veteran division .. He served through the Guadalcanal campaign and, after a rest in the Fijis, diE-tinguished himself in the vicious fighting at Bougainville, where lhe Ja.ps succeeded in bring- ing heavy artillery to bear on the American CP and the hospital area where Captain Raymond and the otlier American medical offi- cers treated wounded men day aft- er day. ,....., ............... .. .... - ~ .......... ... WiUiam Dando Saves Man from Drowning UCRS Station UCRS has received from the Navy V-12 Headquarters a set of recordings entitled \Shipboard Commands\. The recordings, issued by the Navy Bureau of Personnel, Training Division, will be broadcast approxi·mately once a month at the request of the Navy Administration, in order to acquaint the trainees with these commands, and the way in which they are given on ship- board and at larger shore stations. The topic to be discussed is 1·· \Shall the Peace Treaties Be Acted . t:pon by the Senate or by Both Houses of Congresso?\ I William \All Business\ Dando, a V-12er inmate of Phi Delta, added to the laurels of the Unit on Sunday afternoon, when he jumped into Mariaville Lake, fully clothed, to rescue Conroy Beebie of 809 Cutler Street. Dan- do was sitting on the dock at the edge of the lake after dinner when his attention was d-rawn to a woman screaming in a small boat some distance off shore. The woman, Mrs. Conroy, was incoherent, and almost hys- terical, so Dando had difficulty in understanding her until he saw a head appearing and dis- appearing a short distance from the boat. ~Tickets for Swim Show Almost Sold Out in Early Rush Show to Start at 8:45 in State Spa Recreation Pool -Proceeds io Go to N.A.F.

V-12 Trainees Contribute To Red Cross Blood Bank Perhaps some of you more liter-<i;•>----------------- ate trainees have noticed the C. O.'s recent or·der on Red Cross Blood Donations. We were passing it over when our eyes struck para- graph five which says to effect: Trainees donating blood will be pxcused from calisthenics and gym on the day following their dona- tion. Need I say, we made a Bee line for the Schenectady Blood Bank. It required no heavy brain- work on our part to realize that the P. T. instructors on this base take theil· own little pint every time we don a gym outfit, and because none of them look as though they need it, we decided to contribute to a more needy cause. Pretty Nurses On reaching the desk right in- side the Armory do.or, we were asked what we wanted. One of our party politely told the atten- dant, while another guarded our rea1· from any Shylock who might be running a flesh-bank in compe- tition. We went through the usual pt,e!iminaries, and after presenting a certificate procured at Sick Bay attesting that we were physically approved for blood donations by the Navy Medical Department, they slapped us down on a for- midable operating table. We were surprised at their haste because we had noticed a long line when we had first come in. This, how- ever, turned out to be a group of pretty Red Cross nurses, waiting to •go to work. Their inactivity tes- tified as to \the crying need\ for blood donors in Schenectady. With ten nurses to a patient, we're all in favor of fewer donors, but the time it took to draw a pint of blood from our undernourished veins was insufficient to learn more than a fuw first names. Unavailable Tho' We tt·ied to look faint, but some dastard had beaten us to it, so they were quite wise to the trick. We recovered quite quickly when they called some nurses-aid (all of her) to help us to the door. (Continued on Page 3) Although possessing little knowledge of life-saving meth- ods, Dando plunged in, and struck out for the man. Upon reaching him, he held the vic- tim's head above water, and called to Mrs. Conroy to bring the boat closer. This was more difficult than was apparent, for Mrs. Conroy was lacldng in skill in handling the boat. When the craft was close enough, Dando released his hold on the drown- ing man long enough to grasp the boat, and aid Mrs. Conroy in bringing it nearer. He then caught the victim again, and pulled him into the boat. At PT class on Monday morn- ing, Champ pt·esented Dando with a laurel of his own making, in a ceremony comparable to that of the Grecian gods. Niew Intramural Tournaments Open Swimming and Football to ' ·Be :Am~ng Season's Sports This is it!

Tickets are almost gone, so get yours at the Bookstore as soon as possible. They're only $1.00 each, and what with the eagle having just flown by, that's not at all ex- pensive. DirectPd by Brooks The show is directed by Bob Brooks, who has built himself quite a name along this line. As a civil- ian, he toured lower New York and New Jersoey with a similar troupe under his direction. He will be fea- tured with Honey Queern in a duet swim, and again in the \Aqt.:abats\. This latter provides the laughs, with their Clown-Diving and Com- edy Swim Strokes. Talent from towns and cities throughout Central New York has been gathered together for the show, and it promises to be one of the finest of its type. The Sara toga Civic Orchestra, led by Charles E. Morris, will provide the music nu- cleus, and will be supported by the Mohawk Glee Club: Union's \Sing- ing Gobs'' and Marilyn King, the twelve-year old songbird of Mech- anicville.

August lOth. \The Schenectad~· Cnion Star\ in the column \Seen and Heard\ bitterly assailed the edito1·ial, accused it of being the opinion of a single individual and not a group, and generally attempted to discredit it. This a1·ticlc represents a direct challenge to the editoria.l policy of oHr l'nion College newspape1·. \Saturda Nights'!\ was written with the intent of reminding the adminis- tmtion and of letting the people of Schenec- tady know about the inactivity and lack of effort in the social life of the new students. For those who have as yet been unable to get fully acquainted in their new environ- ment, some means should Le provided to help them in obtaining soc~al contacts. Such a means i::> notable because of its absence. The editorial went on to point out that because of the tempol'al'Y suspension of the fratemity system, the one big social contact provider is lost. It is t1·ue that seven fra- ternities have pledges; however, the number of Freshmen pledged is negligible. Incoming Freshmen are simp!,\· lost in a labyrinth of banenness. The pmpose of the editorial was to let the people who are in a position to help, know about the situation. The \Union Star\ article, wl'itten by someone who passes under the psuedonym \The Specta- tor\ began with an anecdote about a \col- lege boy\ who, upon looking into the world, became so discoun1ged that he shot himself. The writer derives the moral that the stu- dent had been so filled up with the idealism of college leaders at gradHation, that when he went to face the wodd and found it not as expected, he dicl not use his self-suf- ficiency but simply sm1·endered his entire existence. · This is hardly a comparison. The \Con- cordy\ merely askecl help for the newcomers to the College-particularly fol' the civilian Fn:!shmen, since the Navy students have the support of the USO-in acquainting them with theil· environment and in helping them to bridge the gap between high school life and hie on a college campus. The editorial never suggested that thei1· whole life be supported. The \Spectator\ repeatedly refers to the anonymity of the editorial. All editorials of the \Concordiensis\ are written by the edi- tors and as such direct!,\· represent the edi- torial polic~· of the paper. Occasionally an editorial \Hitten by another member of the staff is printed. Howevet·, in all such cases the editorial is in stl'ict acco1·dance with the views of the editors. As is common practice among newspapers, editorials are not signed and the indication is that such editol'ials m·e written by the editors. In its enth·e tone, the \Seen and Heard\ article attempted to ridicule Union's student body. Perhaps the \Spectator\ felt like laughing upon reading \Saturday Nights?\. Obviously he is not entirely acquainted with the facts. The situation is no joke. Neithel' is the cl'iticism of the condition so unw~w­ ranted or unfair to the people of Schenectady that the \Spectator\ has the right \to get burned Hp\ about it. The editorial did not say that Schenec- tady is one of the coldest and most banen towns in existence. It merely said that en- tel·ing· F1·eshmen had found it to be such. Perhaps Schenectady is warm and cong-enial -but where is the evidence for this'! Cer- tainly no one expects anything exceptional. No Freshman who just entered college could be so unworldly as to have such illusions as the \college boy\ in the \Uni0n Star\ article's anecdote. Every Freshman is eager to make contacts, hut what chance has he if no opportunities are offered? Perhaps the students can get along with- out social contacts; perhaps they can speHd their week-ends loafing through streets or going to a movie-but the fact is that some- thing can be done so easily to improve this. How easy it would be to have a few parties where Freshmen could meet decent Schenec- tad~· girls! The articles mentions that there are hundreds of girls left unescorted by the le~wing of over U,OOO of Schenectady's men for the armed services. Well, how shall a Freshman meet a girl'! Surely the writer does not recommend street-corner girls? It is true that no parties or formal introductions are necessary to acquaint one with these. Of course, there are a few Freshmen who have lJeen so fortunate as to make acquaint- ances in this college town. But what are a few in group of almost one hundred? .At the N AC dance two weeks ago the ab- sence of Freshmen was particularly notable. Questioning Freshmen upon the reason for the lack of Freshman representation result- ed always in the answer that they were unable to obtain dates. That in itself is enough to prove the entire case. As a direct answer to the \The Schenec- tady Union Star\ we wish to point out that perhaps the editorial was slightly misundel·- stood. lt was not meant to besmear the City of Schenectady. Its sole purpose was to call attention to an unfortunate situation. It was a plea for remedy. Its publication has al- read~· brought some fruits. A tea to be given by the wives of faculty members for the Freshmen has been announced. At last Tues- day's picnic on the Campus numerous Fresh- men had dates, invited by the sponsors of the picnic. Some similar, as yet indefinite, plans are in the making. Truly, Schenectady is not a barren city-it need only be reminded of the lack in social contact for the Fresh- men to do something about it. That was the purpose of the editorial, and the response to it seems to testify for its success. The \Concordiensis's\ editorial policy con- sists mainly of suggesting improvements concerning the College. The common good for all is the main objective. This aim, which it has maintained since its founding in 1877, will always be the guiding light of its edi- torial policy.

CIVILIAN INFIRMARY Everyone has upon one time or another been afflicted with a sickness of some kind. Union's students me no exception. They tocl have their ills and they too should be treated for them in the correct and proper way. The Navy students have the benefit of sickbay, an infirmary with a complete staff. However, for the civilians the1·e 1s no such institution. A civilian when sick simply has to stay in his room. Food for him must be brought Ul~ by a roommate Ol' some other good samari- tan. If his disease IS more serious, he wiH have to go to the hospital about a lllocl\ and a half from the corner of the campus. other students. How easy it Is for a student with a light attack of gl'ippe to infect his whole ctormitor~·. The problem of transport- Ing wmm food to the indisposed student ts another argument for the immediate estab- lishment of an infirmary. This situation should be remedied. The best remedy, of course, would be the establish- ment of a sepamte infirmary. Hov,:ever, the> stuclent body realizes that this would be pmc- iicall.\· impossible at this time. With such a s.ma·ll number of civilian students, the cost would be too high. However, there is smne- thing else that the administmtion could do. That IS the establishment of one room m each house into which students who are in- disposed could :be movecl. The room should contain a becl so that the student could sleep there.

M., WE KNOW YOU WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER THE After last year's sad fate for the football team, this year's squad should rate some support behind it. This is not entirely the fault of the students. They have been given no chance to show their spirit. Now that a cheedeading squad is being organized \Ye should soon see some pep rallies and cheer- ing practices. That is one sure way to rouse lagg·ing morale. One reason why there is not more singing of Union songs and shouting of Cnion cheers is the fact that many of the ne\v students have had no opportunity to leam them. Why, for instance, cannot the Wednesday singing period for the Nav~· men be utilized for learning and smgmg llnion's songs instead of \Semper Paratus\ and the \:\Iarine Hymn\. Then, maybe, marching platoons would be sing-ing \If You \i\'ant to Go to ------~---·-· hawk Yale\. It ·would be a pleasant change.
