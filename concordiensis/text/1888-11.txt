This 111ay rightly be called an age of realisn1~ or if you please, of ex:cessi ve realistn, for real is 111 is of two kinds, which, for want of better tenns, we will designate as p:.>sitive anJ ne.::;ative. NegatiYe Realisn1 is optin1istic, it is the ideal- isn1 of literature; it deals \\rith the veriest villian, th~ ll:)blest hero, unJ th~ n1ost devout saint. It believes in virtu~, and has its Desdenl:)na, in friendship and has it Horatio. Truth, honour, bravery, patriotis1n and love are not to it nlin words, sy1nbols of abstract ideas, which exist nowhere but in the itnaginntion. IVfan, created in the i n1age of his Maker, has not yet descended so low as to assu n1e the character of his Destroyer. This is the realisn1 of Shakespeare, who by the side of cruel, tyrannical and tnur- derous N1acbeth, portrays the noble-hearted MacduJf; of Shakespeare who atones for the faithless and unnatural daughters, Goneril and Regan, by the true, filial love ofCordelia. It is the realisn1 of Shakespeare who surveys with incon1parable genius the whole htunan race ; who penetrates as never n1an has done before~ the innern1ost secrets of the hun1an soul, and who then in a par.oxysn1 of achniration and \YOn- der, is C0111pelled to exclaitn, \vVhat a piece of work is 1nan! How noble in reason ! How infinite in faculty ! In fonn and rnoving how express and achnirable ! In action how like an angel ! In apprehension hovv like a God ! The beauty of the world, the paragon of anitnals !'' This too is the realisn1 of Scott, Eliot, Dickens, Thackeray, the realisn1. of poetry, the realisn1 of all fiction that tends to 1 ift a n1an above hin1se lf, the fiction that portrays to a tnan's n1ind, virtue purer than his own, yea, and guilt deeper thatt his cnvn. It sees the true as well as the false, and above it all, aboYe ancl bcvond the vvcak- nessesand then1istakes of our frail hunHtnity, it beholds the Author of ail, otnnipotent perfection. This I have defined as negative rea:lisrn, because it does not so nu1ch picture ,tnan as he is, as what he 1night and can be. I believe it to be the trtJe idealisrn ofliterature, as cotnpnrecl \vith the abnonnal and unnatural character painting of the so-called light novel of the clay, ancl the dregs of filthiness and vice served us by the n1odern French school. It is especially this latter class of fiction vv hich I have i ncl ucled under the head of positive or excessive realisJJz, the evil influence of \vhich can scarcely be estitnatecl. It searches th~ dens of i 1nn1oralitv ~ and vice, it throngs divorce courts and brothel~, it revels in anarchy and critne, in short vvhat- ever is base, degrading, and ani tnal it paints, and holds the product before the eyes of the rising generation,_ exclainung, Behold hzt7nanity! The world in which you are living is treacher- o~ts, in1n1oral, steeped in crin1e ancl sin. )..,.. on tnust adopt its Inethods, and assun1e its garb if you would be happy, if you would exist. l:.~ es, this is the realistn that would tnakc tnisanthropes and pessitnists of us all, the realisn1 that \Vould deny to tnan the possibility of spiritual develop- tnent, that vvould keep us forever upon the level of the brutes, nay, it vvould go still farther than this, it would deny the providence of God and the personality of n1an. Bet\veen these tvvo great schools there are a thousand and one tninor ones, prolific of ephetneral productions, vvhich deal with abno1·1nal growth, son1e of then1 gooll in thetnselves, but which do no hann as they only receive their just re~rard, the attention of a passing n1on1ent. \ ... ct after all, is it not true. that this world is, for the n1ost part, one of ideals?

Besides it contains two real treasures, \ Ruben's Elevation of the Cross,\ and the '~Descent frorn the Cross.\ It is perhaps un- fortunate for one who desires to understand the great painter to begin with these 1nastcrpieces. A hi:storical study of his productions would be n1uch n1ore interesting. To pass fron1 this beautiful expTession of a benutiful thought, '~The Descent frotn the CFoss,\ to the colossal, contorted, sensual nudities with which the artist has seen fit to cover his canvasses now scattered through European galleries, can but be disap- pointing. We would not depreciate the genius of Rubens; it was of the first order. But we do n1aintain that he tnade a great n1istake in placing fat Mrs. Rubens in a thousand of his paintings, as a type of fetninine beauty. Antwerp is unique. Houses are out of the perpendicular, horses pass on the wrong side. We say wrong side. The question is, which is the right side. In n1any European countries, carriages pass to the left. Is John Bull or Uncle San1 right? John ought to know ; he's been driving longer. But then right here, the prin- ciple of personal liberty asserts itself.

The great Salle des Pas Perdus is so syrntnetrica1~ so in1posing, that one instinctively exclaitns, ''What a place to study architecture!''

A group of 1nasqueraders swings into a restaurant, turns things upside down and swings out again. Two groups of twenty 1neet in thE: street. Neither yields and a skinnish is the result. Each person clings tightly to his neighbor\s arn1 and the groups finally separate and pass to new collisions ancl pranks. Bacchus rules supretne. In such scenes painters like Frank Hals and Jan Steen h£lve found their character, .and they have exaggerated in no degree. Indeed the characteristic of the Nether- land school of art is fidelity in depicting things as they are. To test this, exatnine one of Ruys- dael's paintings and then clin1b a steeple and study the landscape. There are no wide vistas, no sharp outlines-the atmosphere is too hun1id- but there is a soft, subdued, yet rich light which n1akes the scene very pleasing. There are red tile roofs, green n1eadows, thousands oi I-Iolstein cattle, giant windtnills and great water highways fringed with long lines of willows. We seetn to have seen it all before, foi· the dikes and wind- tnills were in our school geographies and we have often read of thetn, but it is different now. The wind tnills are alive and their anns are long~r than we thought and the light and shadow on the scene are quite other than any we have known. Altogether Holland is delightful anJ unique and as such the pa:intei· has grasped it. Frotn Brussels tvvo routes are open to tourists, one northward through Holland, the other direct to Rhineland. No one who can spare a fe\\\' days should fail to choose the forn1er. A ride ~ fron1 the Hague to Scheveningen on the imperiHl of the horse cars. a s-vvitn in the surf and a con- , cert in the I<:ursaal will alone atnply repay one's trouble. One can see n1ore in less time and for less 1noney in Holland than in any other country. In square 1niles it is not great. \T ou could place the entire kingdon1 in Ne-vv \-ork state north of, the ~foha\Yk river and not tresspass on British territory. But in n1oral ·worth it is great. The principle that through struggle con1es develop- l11ent is no\vhere better illustrated than here. The thought \ God n1ade the sea, we n1ade the shore,\ has giYcn the Dutclunan a back-bone. IIe\'s fought for fatherland and loves it, loves it's dikes, it's -vvindn1ills, it's institutions. This long continued battle -vvith wind and wave ha$ tnade hin1 strong and energetic.

'' Perhaps I hadn't better, after all ; it will loose so 1nuch titue ,\Dick retorted slovvly. \It's all 1ny blessed care1essn.ess,\ he n1uttered. We began our tran1p in single fHe, Dick first, with his pack on his back and repeater over his shoulder; then the ffinth Hsiast, also heavily laden, carrying his shot gun, and I brought up the rear entirely unarn1ed and defenseless, loaded with our tnuch abused ln.~ea.d. For the first 1nile we pushed right through1 the woods, cli1nbing fallen logs and pressing ~srde the underbrush; then we took an open woo<l l'oad for several n1.iles and finally turned to follow a blazed trail. The afternoon was deligl1ttful. Thanks to our bath on the lake, it tnatfi:e reel nothing how wet the bushes were. and-we a.dtnired without drawback ' the raindrops glist.eni ng on every leaf. The sq uin·els and birds. \..V.ere reveling in the warn1 sun after the rain, a:tUl every tree seerried alive with the it happy c h~t:tter. Through the dark green of the foliage we could catch glitnpses of the deep blue of t'lile sky, intensified here and there by the pure w;lhite of a passing cloud. Once we skirted, for llalf a tnile, the shores of a wild little lake, over \-Vl1ose shores a black hawk was hovering in sc::w-c]~, ·Of food. Beneath our feet the darn p tnoss was a soft carpet, and its elastic spring see1ned trying to aid us to the next step. Around and through all was the soughing of the vvind atnong the tree tops. My tnind was full of it all. But alas, tl1is work-a-day world ·r Dick had led us around a sharp turn, and I vvas sprawling over the first log of a corduroy road. Ugh l I n1oaned. \What are yo1,1 doing down there?\ laughed the Enthusiast over his shoulder. \ Do you suppose I tried to get down here? \ I shouted angrii'y; but he was already disap- peating atnong the trees. I straightened n1y pack and hastened on. We had scratnbled over wet logs an interrnin- able time, when Dick stopped, threw dovvn his pack basket, and began to fill his pipe. \Want a drink of vv .. ater?\ said he, briefly, \vhen we l1ad followed his exatnple. ''Augustus Coosar!\ screa1ned I. \'What have you stopped in this nest of 1nosquitoes for? They're eating us alive.\ \They are rather thick, ain't they?\ he agreed, handing tne a cup of deliciously cool water. '' Wall, the road is a trifle swatnpy the next two mile, and I thought we'd rest a tninute before we tried it.\ The Enthusiast and I sat on a log and fought tnosquitoes for the next ten tninutes. Dick see1ned perfectly oblivious to thern. We both agreed afterward there was no greater wonder than a native tnountaineer's indifference to Inos- quitoes. For an hour V\re waded knee deep in water through swanip grass and alders. But no one co1nplained. Dick was indifferent to every thing; the Enthusiast was buoyed up by his own innate ardor ; and I was trying to school tnyself into the proper fratne of tnind to call this pleas- ure. At last we renched firn1 ground again, and the walking becarne once tnore tolerable. At half-past six we reached Jessup's river. We were to spend the night here, and cotnplete our journey to Moose lake in the tnorning. Our ca1np was a s1nall log hut about fifteen feet square and five feet high, built for winter deer hunting. One side of the structure was fanned by a huge boulder, against whose base the catnp fire was built; a hole in the roof being the only

The house hatl a vety stable appear· ance, but the withered tnoss stuffed between the titnbers, and the dry hetnlock brush on the floor suggested innutnerable unwelcorne insects. \Dick suppose you and I go and catch son1e trout for supper. You would rather stay here and rest, wouldn't you, 'Q}till?\ \ By al11nean~; twelve 111iles are quite suffi- cient for n1e in one afternoon.\ So Dick built a fire in our shanty to drive the gnats out, and he and the Enthusiast left tne to 1ny thoughts. Aft~t I had rested son1•e tin1-e a brilliant idea seized tn·e. I would cut sotne wood for the night's fud. I found a nurnber of . large stutnps about three feet high, where the trees had been. cut for the shanty, and had just succeeded, after great exertion, in chopping do\vn three of thetn when the fishertnen re- turned. '' Won't those old feHows give us a capital blaze to-night?\ were tny first words after I had inspected their basket of fish. \ Splendid! \ exclai1ned the Enthusi~st. But there was no sign of approval frotn Dick, and I repeated tny question. \ I guess we can use' e1n if we split 'em up,'' and he looked doubtfully up fro1n the fish he was cleaning ; '' Balsatn's so fu 11 of water it won't burn rnuch.\ Dick was incapable of satire, or I tnight have felt hurt. Just then tbe Enthusiast catne out of the shanty waving aloft a very rusty frying pan, son1e pre- vious can1per hacl left behind hi1n. \Luck favors the righteous,\ he shouted, and went down to scour it with sand frorn the river bottotn. Only one thing interfered with the enjoyn1ent of our wild supper that night. The coffee vvas splendid ; the trout were delicious ; but our bread frotn its soaking in the botto1n of the boat was strongly flavored with sot11e fishennan's waste ·bait! \By the way, Q_uill, how did you like Miss Sullivan? You were intToduced to her last eve- ning, weren't you?\ For over an hour we had been stretched be- fore Dick's blazing fire, lazily talking over our day's experience, the condition. of the trout strean1s and our hopes of capturing a deer to- n1orrow. '' Why, I thought she was pleasant enough,\ I said, quietly rolling a fresh cigarette. '' She is a n1ighty fine girl ; you know I tnet her at Cotnlnencetnent ball. She is a. splendid dancer, now, I can teU you,\ the Enthusiast broke out, sitting up in his excitetnent. \ Oh, I have no doubt of it. But isn't she a good deal of an .i\.nglotnaniac?\ '' Pshaw! She's nornore an Anglotnaniac than I atn! I do vdsh you would learn to appreciate a nice girl when you n.1eet one, ~ill!\ '' Be good enough to hand rne a light frotn the fire since you are up, will you?'' I yawned. \1. ou'll die of ennui sorne day if you don't look out.\ He handed n1e a burning twig, then turned to Dick in desperation : ''You have seen her, haven't you, Dick? Don't you think she is a pretty handsotne young lady?\ Dick gave a deep tneditative puff on his pipe. ,,, What, tha_t slitn girl I seen walkin.' down the road in front of the hotel this tnorning? 'They'd better throw a blanket onto her, or she won't cast a shadder !\ •' I'tn going out to chop sotne tnore fire· wood,'' the Enthusiast exclaitned, leaping up in1patiently fron1 the ground. \ Look out, don't -vvake up the neighbors,\ chuckled Dick, over the vexation l1e had caused. After we had heard hitn chopping so1ne titne, the Enthusiast catne to the door and called : \ Co1ne out, Q!;1ill, .and see what a beautiful night it is.\ It was i11.deed beautiful. The wind had gone down with the sun, and not a sound could be heard except the soft rippling of the river in the distance. The stars shon~ caln1ly in the sky; a silvery tnoon was j:ust breaking over the black \vall of forest which seetned to encircle us like an in1penetrable barriex, and itnpressed upon us the lonely thought thnt fifteen tniles of its dark glootniness separated us frotn every htnnan being. We stood silent for sotne minutes, our hands on each others shoulders ; then the En- thusiast slowly repeated: ''It is a beauteous evening, cairn and free, The holy place is quiet as a nun, Breathless with adoration.\

25 1'HE CONCORDIENSIS. I did not thoroughly enjoJ n1y fi.rst night's catnping. Dick rolled hitnself up \vith his arn1 for a pillow, and vvas soon fast asleep. The Enthusiast, vvith his head on a fish basket, fol- lo\vecl suit. But for a long ti tne I lay awake. The spiders, vva.n11ecl up by the fire, crept up n1y sleeves and bit n1e, ancl a colony of 111ice catne out of son1e crevice to inYestigate the intruders. Once I savv one of these little rascals sitting on Dick's coat collar, and heard that individual n1urn1er\'persuasi\Tely '' Set stiH, darn ye, or I'll killye.\ lVloose lake is a vvild, rockv little basin of the ., glacial fonnation.

A lean-to is a n1ost pritnitive hahibl.tion. Across the tops of two forked posts, fouT or five feet high, a pole is laid.

It vvas nearl v dark before vve can1e back to have our trout -cooked for dinner. Just as we finished and wc1~c enjoying our fitst stnoke, a cracking of the n nderbrush startled us, and Frank appeared \i\·ith t\vo n1ore tourists. He threw off his pac1< with the terse~ 'flow are _ye ?\ so characteristic of the North vvoods guide; but the professor was n1orc detnonstrativc. \ ):.,. e gods ; 1'hat last half 111 ile \Vas the \Vorst .. ----------- -~---- vvalking it has ever been tny i:ll fortune to find !

'' Frank, do, 'for pi·ty's sake, get us sotnething to eat! I'rn halt starved ! '' And it was not till after F'ntnk had fed then1 that conversation thrived at alL Then we be- can1e 1nore social, and found the professor a de- delightful story teller. vV e palled out the cards and played seven-up by the fireiight, vvith a pack basket for a card table, and the evening passed p:Ieasantly till nearly ten o'clock, when the En- thusiast and Dick prepared to float for deer. Floating for deer is the n1ost fascinating forn1 of hunting-~t least, so the Enthusiast n1aintains. Fron1 the trunk of a birch tree, Dick cut a ring of bark about a foot wide. This he nailed to the edge of a setni-circular board he heweJ out with the axe, and then put within the appa- ratus, vvhich looked tnuch like a large flour scoop, two or three candles, and fastened it to a pole in the prow of his row-boat, so that the rays of light vvere cast ahead on the \Vater. Behind this rude lantern the Enthusiast took his seat, his loaded shot-gun on his knees, while Dick sat in the stern and paddl~d noiselessly out into the darkness. The n1ysterious light on the \Vater dazzles the deer, \vho has con1e to feed on the lily pads, ancl he stands perfectly still, a splen- did shot, if the hunter does not catch the \buck fever.\ The rest of us crept into the lean-to and vvent to sleep. At nearly n1idnight the hunters re- turned disnppointed; they had not even seen a deer. lTnfortunately, the shanty vvas only built for three tnen, and they were forced to follow Frank's exan1ple and sleep under the open sky. It w:1s well enough till early rnorning; then it began raining and they sought protection where they could. An odd spectacle n1et 1ne when I a\Yoke about six o'clock. The Enthusiast was sitting against one of the posts of the can1p fast asleep, his head fallen over on his breast. Dick had pulled his hat over his face ~1nd vvas shn11- ·• ; .·. , ....

Frank was sleeping soundly, his head and shoulders covered with a huge piece of hark, and on one of his great boots, reached out toward the s,tnoul- dering.fire, sat a little squirrel chippering gaily. The rain lasted with persistent cletennination all day long. It drenched our provisions ; it drenched our clothing ; and finally penetrated so deeply as seriously to da1npen our spirits. There was son1e attetnpt at fi~bing, but it was too rainy for that. The trout wouldn't bite. We tried to pia y cards, but the soaked pasteboard put an end to that. Our bark 1·oof proved litHe better than no .covering at all. We passed a dreary day enough, betnoaning our hard luck and wishing ourselves back at the hotel and civilization. A rainy night followed and was ' 1nore than I could endure. While we were eat- ing breakfast, I burst out : '' What do you fellows think of going back to-day? I,. for one, an1 tired of staying here in the rain.\ \ Oh, we don't vvant to do that, do vve?\ ob- jected the professor. \ It will clear up to-day, won't it, Dick? \ Dick looked at the sky reflectively. \ It 'pears as if it m1ight to'ards noon. We could go on to Beaver pond. lVIay be our chance of getting a deer would be better there. Son1ething has got to be done, our grub is getting so low.\ '' How far off is that?\ I enquired anxiously, for we were all stifr fi·otn the clatnp by this ti111e. \ About five n1ile,'' Frank explained; \hut the trouble is, the lean-to there only holds two.\ \ That's of no consequence ; what do we care for a roof no-vv? \V e're beyond all such trifles,\ laughed the artist. So a little before noon vve started for Beaver pond. A 1nore dis1nal journey is not easily i n1- agined. The actual rain had for the rnotnent stopped, but the clouds vvere still heavy and threatening. The ground was slippery and difficult. lVIore than half our vvay was through swan1p and alders. 1\'he others, -vvho ~rcre rnore or Tess veteran carnpers, took it all as a tnatter of course; but I trudged along in silence. I dared not speak for fear of in1parting son1c of n1y despondency to then1. Inwardly T was yovving that should it please an all n1erciful '\'l Providence to return n1e to civilized life before I was entirely dissolved, I would never venture fron1 it again. Once the Enthusiast turned upon rne with a curious sn1ile : '' Well, ~Jill, are you enjoying yourself? That expression of yours is vvorthy of a funeral.\ \ vVe rnnst take the bitter \Vith the sweet, I suppose,\ was the .retot~t. gi vcn \vith greatest nonchalance. A sadly bedraggled party we were -vvhen at last, after three hours plodding, we came upon Beaver pond. .l\..s its natne declares, years ago sotne industrious beaver had da111n1ed up the sn1all strean1 which now flovvs in sluggish cur- rent, winding and twisting through what -vvas once the bottorn of a lake. In the idle water grow innu1nerable lillies, tetnpting food for the deer. Our sportstnen in1n1ecliately essayed to fish, but with poor success. The strean1 was too high. Before long \VC had all gathereu around the fire watching- Dick and Frank n1ake ready our supper. '' Tell you what, boys, only t\vo lo,lvcs left ; it'll go hard -vvith us if \Ve don't get a deer to- night,\ retnarked Dick, as he opened our bag of wet bread. As soon as it was dark, the Enthusjast and guide once rnore departed to float for deer.· The artist retired into the lean-to to clean his gun, and the professor and I stretched oursehres be- fore the fire, and with stoical indifference for all tnaterial circun1stances, plunged into an nni- n1ated discussion of' Robert Elstnere.' The hours passed .and we heard no gun-shot. Finally the Professor crept into the shanty and rolled hin1self in his blanket for the night. I looked a n1o1nent at the two n1en crovvded close together under their forlorn roof, gave an envious sigh at Frank snoring under the shelter of a decayed log, then chew n1y rubber coat a little tighter around 1ne, and vvent to sleep \vhere I lay. The first great drops of a heavy sho-vver dis- turbed n1e., nnd I had barely succeeded in squeez- ing n1yself into the shanty behveen the legs of the two sleepers, when the Enthusiast and Dick ca1ne up fron1 the water carrying their canoe. \Well old rnan,\ I inquired, anxiou~ly, \you haven't shot a deer?\ \ No, confound it !

We should have had one in an hour, but this rain n1ust cotne up and drive 'etn all away. 1'hat's what I call beastly hard luck-don't you, Dick?\ \ 'Tis rather hard, that's so,\ assented Dick, bending over the ren111ants of the fire in search of a light for his pipe. '' T'n1ust be the harvest stonn they said was co1nin'.\ Nothing ever disturbed Dick's equilibriutn. He accepted ,succe'is or failure with the satne degree of insensibility. Perhaps-· heaven for- bid! he had seen so tnany pleasure hunters in our tnisery, he had beco1ne hardened to it. He and Frank tipped the boat over, propped it on some sticks, and with the Enthusiast crowded under it for shelter. We had not slept 1nore than two hours when another tre1nendous shower catne do\rn upon us. Sleep was out of · the question. I sat up, tny hands clasped around my knees. The others were already up and out in the rain, except the professor. One great piece of bark in the roof protected hitn conl- pletely fro1n the down-pour, and he was sleep- ing in happy oblivion. It was tnore than hutnan nature could endure. \ Let's roast hin1 out! \ cried the Enthusiast. \We can't allow such cotnfort as that,\ and he began to rekindle the sn1othered fire. ing our last cup of coffee, he announced with his nsual brevity : \ I guess you fellows '11 be pretty hungry be- fore yon get any thing tnore to eat.\ Then after a n1otnent',s consideration, '' We'd better start as soon as we can get our traps packed.\ But it was nearly ten o'clock before we could gather courage enough to set out. What a tratn;p that \Vas ! The rain ,continued steadily without intennission. All day long we tore on over the soaked, slippery ground, through swarnps and strean1s, tnaking only the briefest halts to rest. We thought it \vonld never end. The last n1ile seetned ten. We could scarcely drag one foot after the other. .i\ n1ore tnisera- ble day I never passed. We reached the lake shore a little before six in the even1ng. As Dick beg-an to rovv us across, I broke out: \Next tin1e you get the can1ping fever, tny friend, we'U lock you up till you get over it; yon n1ay depend on th:~ t.\ Fot· sot.ne n1o1nents he was silent; then his face lighted up. \ I don't know; I have had a n1ighty fine titne. I have enjoyed it all iJn- tnensely; I'n1 going again next year. You tnay depend on that.\ Enthusiastn that could endure such a wetting as this vvithout flinching aroused n1e. \ There is a kind of excitetnent about H that anin1ates l b . . \ you anCt 1 aces ) ou up. The last agony catne when Dick tried to get us out of the boat. A cold wind was blowing over the water and had stiffened us all, heated with walking, as rigid as logs. * * * * Soon a huge blaze was glowing and crackling before the lean-to, and we stood watching its effect on the innocent sleeper. Slowly he began to draw away his legs and 111ove uneasily in his shunber. Then can1e a n1ost unprofessio:1al howl, and he leaped out into the wet. \ Good heavens ! What are you doing any way? My feet are nearly burned of[\ A savage shout oftriutnph was the only reply we gave hitn. The shower gradually becatne :t steady rain, and we slept as best we could till n1orning. An on1jnous silence pervaded our break£1st. We all knew we were eating the last of our provis- ions, and twenty-five 1niles of hard, heavy tnHnp- ing lay between us and our next n1eal. Dick Vilas the first to tnention it. As vvc \Vere drink- When I can1e down stairs next 1norning, I found Miss Black on the piazza.

In the first conventima of the New England Inter- collegiate Press Association, held February 22, r887, the feasibility of 1 an established magazine, to be re,:og- nized as the official organ of the body, was extensively dh;cussed. The idea as a project was finall.,v abandoned. After the lapse of a year or more the principle has come to activity again, but in a modified aspect. The ground work is now under way, upon wh icb a periodi- cal will take its place to be known as the '' Collegian''; not the mere representative of N. E. I. P. A., but of the American undergraduate. The ''Collegian\ will resemble ''Lippincott's,' in. size and general ''makeup,'' and its contents will be much as follows: 0 ne Specin.l Paper ............. 10 or Two Prize Stories, each .•......

Fron1 an itnpartial vie-vv of the Cc~se, we think that these cotnplaints are entirely reasonable. The baths are anti- quated, and even then are by no n1eans in good condition. The roo1ns are cold~ the water is not regulated ; there is no alternative between a bath in \Vater at boiling point, or a fe\v degrees above freezing. Yet these difficulties are slight when con1parecl to the £let that frequently one can scarcely oteathe because of the coal gas in the roon1s.

Foot-Ball. The foot-ball season thus far \vith Union hns been barren of victories, although at the san1e titne reflecting credit on the tean1. The first gatne was played vvith Ridgefields, on tJ1eir grounds. An Eleven con1posed of unpracticed~ ill-conditioned n1en vvent down to Albanv and \' were defeated 28-6. This caused a realization of the poor condition of the tean1, :tncl brought about earnest and syste1natic practice ; the efrect of ·which was seen in the return gmne with Ridgefield on our own grounds. In this gan1e, l{idgefield was successful by a score of but rS-6, and vvere outplayed vvholly by Union's rush-line, winni.1.1g the gatne only by the brilliant playing of HodgP-, the present quarterb..1ck on Princeton. The touch-down in each of the gatnes ·with Ridgefield was n1ade by Culver~ -vvho als~) kicked the goal frotn both touch-downs. The foot-b:lll interest \vas no\v concentrated in the approaching gatne -vvith Cornell, which was played at Ithaca on Novetnber 3nl. Before this, Cornell had been defeated by \Vi Ilia n1s by only zo-o~ and when it was rerne1nbered that Willian1s had scored against Harvard~ very little hope was entertained by Union of defeating Cornell. THE GAME. .. l\ccording to a very i tnpa rtial report in the Cor1ze!i Sun, it wns ~' a pretty one to \vatch, being characterized by hard rushing-, detenninecl tackling, vvith lots of passing and running.\ It -vvas utnpirell by vVaite, and refereed by a Cor- nell 111 an. The only point in which TJ nion claims an error is in the refereeing. The Cor- nell Sun acknowledges that the referee per- tnitted an illegal ''dribble\ by Cornell~ vvhicl1 i ncreasecl their score by six points. T'he Cor- nell temn \vas hearty in its praise of Union's Eleven, adtnitting that e\·cry point \vas gained by the hardest of \York. In scientific tca1n work, Union undouhtecll y outplayed Cornell ; hn t the gre~tt \Veight of Cornell's teatn \vas altuost i rre- sistable to our lighter n1en. 1~he difference :]n passing \vas noticeable; Con1€ll not daring to pass 1nore than seven feet; Yl'hile Union's quar- ter., Clute, often passed the bal~ a distance of thirty- five feet. According to the referee's score, Cornell scored 16 in the first half and lTnion 4 ; \vhile in the second half, Cornell scored IO and Union nothing. 'l'his tnakcs the official score 26-4, although it has been \Nidcly puhlishe(l as 30-4. The touch-dovvn for lTnion \vas nLHle l)y Clute, by_ a double pass fron1 Culver to Clute. After this, Cornell's referee did his College a ~ood turn in takin(J tJ1c hall fron1 lJnion several '~ 0 times before they had n1ade four do\vns,. or after having gained five yards. vVere it not for this. Union could probably have increased its score~ and kept down that of Corn~ll.

l r .. ! .. · . . THE CONCORDIENSIS. 32 ENGlNEERING DEPARTMENiT. Friction. Tbe irnportauce of a correct knowledge of the laws of friction can hardly be exaggerated, yet, notwithstanding the fact that the rnethocJ:s and results of engineers 1nay be worthless on account of th.eir ignorance of the true laws, we fin-<l on this essential 1natter the greatest diversity of opinion. No two series of experitnents, r1o two authors agree. To bring order out of this chaos would be a herculean task. The tnajority tnust be 'vvtung, or at least only in part correct, while probably no on~ tnan is right in all his conclusions .. Tl1e object of this paper wi 11 be to gi-ve the laws as found by son1e of the tnost reliable series of e:xperin1ents. To criticise and check tbe re- sults of one n1an by those of others, and to try and find son1e laws which we n1ay hold .cLS true, at least approxitnately and between certain litnits. P1·obably the first experin1ents wel'e by Atnontons in rG99. He concluded that fliction was not affected by any increase of surface, but varied with the pressure, and also with the velocitJ. · Larnbert doubted these_ resu]ts, and Enter, the great •nathetnatician, using an in- clined plane, found that the co-efficient of fric- tion equalled tan. L and did not vary v-vitl1 the velocity, Brosset distinguished rolling frotil slid- ing friction, but probably erred in respect to the ratio bttween friction and titne, pressure, etc. In r .779' Coulotnb tnade his expet~i tnents, which were very ext~nsive an(l ~unong t:he first of real hnportancc. He agreed whh Anurntons in his law of pressure, 'but, tho':Jght that under extretnely heavy loads he found sotne de-viation fi-ou.1 it. The following are Coulotnb's laws: 1. That friction is proportional to the pres- sure and varies with the kind of tnat~riaL 2. That friction ditninishes as the surfaces in contact are worn sn1ooth, until :t 1ninin.1utn is reached. 3. That between vvoods, the friction. :is less when the grains cross each other tha11 when th ev run in the smne direction. '\' Friction is greater between surfaces of the satne kind, than between those of different kinds. This law was undoubtedly refuted by l\:1orin's experiinents. S· Friction ditninishes as the stnoothness of surface is increased. Vince, in r875, experitnenting in a stnall Lut apparently accurate way, found that friction \Vas aot proportional to the pressure alone, hut also varied with the extent of surfitce in contact. Rennie, in I 829, agreed for the 1nost part with Coulotnh, finding the law of pressure in respect to hard surfaces, to be the sarnc ; but that with fibrous tnaterials, friction vvas increased by surface and thne, and ditninished by pressure and velocitv. After Rennie con1es Morin. His .. experir~ents in tnost respects had a \vide range. Probably on this account his laws have obtained their ahnost universal credence. 1\'hcy arc the following: I. Friction between two surfaces vanes di- rectly as the pressure, no n1atter \vhat the inten- sity of such pressure n1ay be. 2. Friction is wholly independent ot the ex- tent of the surfaces in contact. 3· Where lubricants are used, a distinction rnust be rnade between surfaces sitnply lubri- cated, and surfaces when a strattnn of lubricant is interposed between the suri~tces, although the law of the independence of extent of surf~tce holds good in each. 4· Friction is always independent of the velocity with which a body tnoves. l\Iorin did not find that if the s_urface vvere perfectly clean and free frotn lubricants, they becan1e tnorc sn1ooth, and that friction becatne less after a period of attrition-. thus differing fron1 Coulo1nh. ~Morin also does not agree vdth Coulotnb that friction is greater between dissitnilar than be- tween like substances. Let us now turn for a n1on1ent to the consid- eration of rolling friction, after which in con- nection with a sutnn1ary of the results of recent investigations, we will try to find in \Vhat poinb. if any, Morin's lavvs are open to criticisn1. The rnotion of a roller or wheel on a surface is always attended by resistance. Coulotnb rna de some ex peri n1ents with vvooden rollers on a wooden plane, fron1 vvhich he deduced t\vo laws. First, that the resistance is proportional to the weight of the roller. Second, that the

33 THE CONCORDIENSIS. t\esistance is in\rersely proportional to the dian1- eter. Son1 e titne aft:ervvard, Prof. Reynolds found that .a, roHer, in passing over a plane, caused a ten~ _porary indentation and lateral ex- ])C.tnsion, so :tllnt the roller in reality passed over <t greater exterd of snrface than would con~es­ })ond to the distance between any two points. ]$J experitnent:s,. he found that a roller I 8 inches in. circun1fererJ:ce, in tnaking tvvo revolutions, Ia eked three-6nu~ths of an inch of passing over a distance of a _,vat-d -the surface L1pon which the roller revolve.<J: being n1ade of india rubber ; if . iron or sutne J1ard surface had been used as a plane, the d iiscrepancy would, of course, not have been as great. Reynolds explained this in the following: 1nanne1 ~ natnely: That the ex- te11sion of the sl<r.:face c:r surfaces at the point of contact, caused ithe one surface to slide over the other, and tl~.at this sliding was accornplished ag-~tinst fricti!(')n. Fron1 further experitnents,, this was found to he trne. He also found that fi·,iction not on.ly opposes the sliding of one sur- face over anotih.er, but also prevents it to a con- siderable extent, thus tn::>difying the defonnation t1tat would otherwise take place. The friction a ccotnpanyin:g- this defonnation is called rolling friction, and sl:tonld be distinguished frotn slid- ing friction. R.olling friction follows laws of its -·----- -- --· ---- ... ~--·-- rectly as the nonnal pressure between thel!n:, 2. The nonna1: pressure ren1::1in.ing unchangecl, the friction is independent of th,e extent .of sur- face in ~contact. 3· Friction is always ;greater on the reversa~l' of the direction of slicli ng. 4· Friction. sensibly din1:inishes \vith a rise b~. tetnperatnre, W1itb. well lubricated surfaces. 5. The co-efficient of friction, with the sur·· faces efficiently lubricated, is fJon1 one-sixth :to one-tenth of that for dry or scantily lubricated surfaces. 6. The co-efficient of friction for tnoderate pressures and speeds vades approxin1ately,. it:l:- versely as the norn1al pressur.e. The frictional resistance varies inversely as the area in contact~ the norn1al pressure ren1aining constant. 7. At very low journal speeds, the co-efficient of friction is abnonnally high ; but as the speed of sliding increases fron1 about 10 to roo feet per n1inute, the friction din1inishes, and agai.R rises when tha.t speed is exceeded, varying ap- proxitnately as the square root of the speed. 8. I'he co-efficient of £riction varies a pproxi- n1ately, inversely ns the tetnperature within cer- tain litnits, natnely, just before abrasion takes place. As to these four rules concerning friction be- tween \Veil lubricated surfaces, we have no weH established data \Vith which to cotnpare then1 .. They 1nay be, and probably are correct for the circtunstances under which the experin1ents were tnade. 0 Wil, diflering ft~otn SOBle, though not all of the laws which ge>v ern sliding friction. As its dis- cussion would prolong this paper to unreasona- ble length, suffi·ce it to say that in tnany cases, \Vhere the press:ure is not too great~ rolling is hei ng substit~1te~l for sliding friction, as oHering 1nuch lesss resistance to the turning of axles, &c. ~Of late, the laws of Morin having failed, at lt:ast, apparently, the .subject of the la\vs of fric- tion has agaio. heen taken up, and con1pete1~t engineers have perfc rn1ed several series of ex- perin1ents in o1~der to find whether the laws of McHin would ho-ld good ·when subjected to the test of tnodenu science. Atnong the ~nost itn- portant of these are the experin1ents of Mr. G<lodtnan of E1ngland. With the 1nost n1odern a,ppliances, a.n d every facility for range and acctJracy, he obt.ai ned the following results with clt-y surf,tces: But let us con1pare the results obtained by the different tnen ·whotn we have had under consid- eration. We will first take up the laws of fric- tion vYith dry surf~tces, as found by Goodtnan. In respect to his first law, we find that Euler and Morin agree that the friction varies directly with the pressure. Goodtnan and Coulotnb qualify this so as to exclude heavy pressures. Vince found that it was also proportional to the extent of surfa.ce in contact. And Atnontons and Hirn, that it was propcrtional to the veloc- ity. While Bochet clain1s that the co-efficient of friction decreases as the velocity increases. r. 1'he frictio-n between dry surfaces under 111ocl~rate loads and low veloc:ties, vades di- As to the second law, Goodn1an~ Morin, and Coulon1b obtained the satne results, while Vince is altnost the only one opposed to it.

The subject of velocity has been treated along w.ith pressure under. the head of the first :l:aw. Now the q nesti on naturally arises as to \vhat authority we are going to accept. The di,.flerent results of Mo1:in, ·Coulotnh, A'tnontons and others \vere probably eorrect for the p:uticu:lar cases under consideration. First., let us see if · the friction would be constant at all velocities with constant pt~essure. This will be true if the extra force required at high velocities in break- ing off the little projection$ between the surf~1ces be exactly equal to the gain due to the loss of resistance cause-d by the projections of the sur- faces not having titne to slip into one another, because at a low 1·ate of speed the surfaces would con1e close together, and considerable £orce would be required to puH the one surface out of the innutnerable little ruts ot crevices into which it has fallen. 1\'he loss and gain above tnen- tioned tnay be equal, but if so, it would be a co-incidence tl1at is not likely to take place. The second law, with all its weight of au- :thority, is open to criticistn. Vince alone disa- grees, but there are rnany practical exarnples which help to n.1aintain hitn in his position. R. A. Wilder, who was chief engineer of the· Mine Hill and SchuylkiU Haven R. R., a heavy coal road, stated that upon his road, a grade of 92 feet per n1ile laid with narrow rails, was inune- diatel y succeeded by a 130 ft. slope, with rails of full width ; and that it was found that an engine could draw tnot~e up the s~ope of 130ft. than up that of 90 ft. 'This is further n1agnified by the fa~t tl1at friction. disregarded, the steeper an inclined plane is, the n1ore work is done in drawing a load up it. Again, it is p1~etty gen- erally conceded that new brakes do not have as great an eflect of retardation as those worn to fit the wheels. Such practical ex~nnp1es con- tradict the lavv, but seetn to tne to be worth all the fine tests that can be tnade. And even tak- ing into consideration the nun1ber of experts who have decided for the second law, we are obliged to say that on account of the lack of tests for hea\TY pressures, they have failed to becotne rules that can be applied universally. But these are not supposed to be rules. T'hey are laws, and i( they fail at any point, or in their application to any particular case, they ~cease to beco1n:e such. ·So, perhaps, 've niay say of Mr. Good~nan's laws, that they are rules with exceptions, no doubt, yet true for tnobt cases., and sufficiently reliable to be followed for want of better ones.

Oxon., Sept. 1888. Dear Sir:-In April, r885, while thinking of taking .ordet\s in September, I suddenly received notice that my ordination examinatio-n would be held in a fort- night. I had only tell (IO) days in which to prepare for the Exam. I should recommend a. y1 ar's prepara- tion in the case of anyone so utterly unprepared as I was; but your Syste'm has so streugtheJzed 1ny -JZafural JJiemory, that I was able to re1nember and give the gist of any book ajter reading z't once. I therefore read Lightfoot, Proctor, Harold Browne, M.osheim, &c., &c., ottce, and was sur.r:essful in every oue of the n iJZc papers. The present Bishop of Edinburg kBows the facts. Faithfully yours, [Rev.] JAMES MIDDLETON MACDOXALD, [M. A.J To Prof. A. Loisette, 237 Fifth Ave., N. Y. Perfectly bught by correspondence. Send for pros- pectus. MACHINERY.
