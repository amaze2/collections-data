The general topic for this year is \The United States and the War Effort.\ A different phase of this general topic will be chosen each week. The sub-topic for the first week is \Congress and Its Role in the War.\ Each fraternity and dormitory group will participate in the first two nights of debates, held during the first two weeks. Those who lose on the second night will be elimi- nated from further debating. The winners will continue on a knock- out basis. Thus, after the first night, all those who lose once will be eliminated. The winning group will receive a cup, given .by the Philomatheans, which is to be held for a year and then put up again for competition. RolUldtable System This year the debates will again be of the round-table type which is so popular among present day debaters. As last year two men will represent each fraternity in the verbal battles. A member of the Philomathean Society will act as chairman of ·each debate, and members of the faculty will act as judges. The schedule for the first week is as follows: At 7:30-Beta Theta Pi at Sigma Phi; Alpha Phi Delt at Kappa Sig- ma; Phi .Sigma Kappa at Delta Phi; South College at Alpha Delta Phi. At 8:30~Phi Gamma Delta at Sigma Chi; North College at Kappa Nu; Delta Upsilon at Phi Delta Theta; Kappa Alpha at Chi Psi.

Taylor, has been an· nounced by President Fox. Students in the new fqll-year course will learn how to construct and use not only ordinary flat maps, but also topographic ·maps, which describe land surfaces in minute detail for the guidance of military ground forces; hydrogra- phic charts, which aid the opera- tions of sea forces, espeCially in coastal waters; navigation maps and charts, invaiuable for aerial piloting and navigation; and photo- grammetric maps, made from aerial reconnaisance photographs, partic- ularly over enemy territory. Is Elective Course The new course :s open to regu- lar students in the college as an elective part of their normal pro- gram. The only requirement is a knowledge of elementary algebra and plane geometry, which enables most non-technical students to qual- ify. One hour of theory and two hours of field or laboratory work will be .given weekly throughout the year. The cartography course is still open to any non-engineering stu- dent who wishes to enter. The class is now surveying the campus. Later the members· will make topographical maps, maps from photographs and others, \The class work has begun with the making of maps,'·' Professor Taylor said this week, \simply be- cause in order to know how to read them, a man must know how to make them.\ Phi Delta Theta 8, Sigma Phi 6 Delta.

Taylor, who is conducting the college's new course in cartography, said that the directors of the survey would probably allow two college students at a time to climb the tower and observe the work. He added that the establishment of this point would prove valuable to the engi- neering surveying classes. Professor Mortimer F. Sayre ex- plained yesterday that the basis for the triangulation process which will eventually establish the points and distances essential to the new mapping is a several-mile-long straight stretch on Route 20, which runs south of Schenectady. Tri- angulation points have been set up Fraternities Asked To Pay For Booklet Ketz Appeals to Houses to Defray Printing Expenses Of Subfreshman Pamphlet During its meeting on Monday evening, the Interfraternity Coun- cil listened to a request by Wilfred H. Ketz, Director of Admissions, that the member chapters of the Council help to defray the expenses incurred by the printing of the booklet, \Fraternities at Union College,\ which was distributed to members of the entering freshman class this fall. The booklet, which contains pic- tures of the various chapter houses, a description of the history of fra- ternities at Union, and an objective discussion of fraternity life here, was compiled last spring under the direction of Frederic A. Wyatt, then Admissions Director. He was assisted in this by Benjamin Le- land '42, Mr. George Roberts, Di- First of Skidmore Freshman Parties Is This Week-end 100 Eager Freshmen to Leave North Gate by Bus For Saratoga Saturday Union and Skidmore freshmen will meet in the first of three inter- college parties this Saturday at Skidmore. At 5:50 that evening, approximately 100 en thus i a stic Union freshmen will leave by bus from the north gate for Saratoga where they will be met by an equal number of Skidmore students who will provide the entertainment for the evening. Two more parties will follow Saturday's, one at Skidmore on the tenth of October, and an- other here on Saturday, the seven- teenth of October. These Union - Skidmore parties have been held over a .period of several years. They were initiated mainly through the efforts of Mrs. Dixon Ryan Fox and Mrs. .Henry Thomas· Moore, the wiftJ of Skid- more's president, and have proved to be so successful that they are now being regularly held each year. That these parties are extremely popular among students here on the campus is evidenced by the fact that the quotas for each of the par- ties are more than filled every year. Consequently, every freshman who desires to attend Saturday's party must have submitted his name and fee of one dollar to the admissions office not later than today. ---01--- Nearly 700 People In Defense Classes rector of the College News Bureau, Approximately 700 people have and Fred Wikoff, '43, president of enrolled in the evening defense the council. courses, which commenced Men- According to Ketz's statement of day, Sept. 28 at 7:30 p.m. The 23 last Monday evening, there is no courses offered are sponsored by sum in the Admissions Office bud-· the U.

That is the ultimatum delivered by the administra- tion's Committee on Student Activities, of which Dean Garis is Chainmm, to the Interfraternity Council yesterday, ac- col·ding to Fred Wikoff, '43, president of the council. -~----~---~-----0 The exact nature of the co-oper- ation exacted by the administration committee has been explained to the officers of the council and will ·be set forth to the fraternity heads when they are asked to sign. How- ever, since it is felt that the house presidents may not wish to make this information public, it is being withheld for the present. Under a new elective system in- augurated by the Class of 1946, offi- cers elected today will hold office for about a month, when a promi- nent slate of officers will be elected. The nominees were: Daniel Bask- ous, Clifford Benfield, John Di Sar- ro, Robert Disney, John Douglas, Gerald Dudley, Harold Enstice, John Frelick, Bennett Grocock, Charles Guare, David Killian, Ed- ward McGrath, John Newton, Wil- liam O'Neil, Ivan Scheier, Wood- ard Shaw, Leroy Seigel, Charles Weissner. Ger8ild Dudley '46 proposed in Freshman meeting Monday that the freshman nominate and elect temporary officers. His motion was carried by a large majority. The purpose of this plan is that the freshmen should know each other better before electing perma- nent class officers. The same plan for electing permanent officers will be used. ----0·-~- Plan J~oint Canoe Trip This Month Outing Club Selects Executive Committee During First Meeting Plant Protection School Here On October 7 and 8 OCD Sponsored Classes to Train Industrial· Execu'i'ives To Prevent Sabotage, Fire The New York State War Coun- cil will inaugurate the first of a series of three schools of War Coun- cil Plant Protection here on Wed- nesday and Thursday, October 7 and 8. These schools will be spon- sored by the Office of Civilian De- fense. Their purpose is to train industrial executives for organiz- ing and training employees to pre- vent and fight fire and sabotage. The first meeting of the school will make use of the Old Chapel, the Chemistry Building, which will be used for some demonstrations, and Hale House, where the attend- ing executives and speakers will eat. Outstanding authorities on vari- ous phases of plant protection, rep- resenting the United States Army, the Office of Civilian Defense, the State Education Department, and organized labor, both the Ameri- can Federation of Labor and the Committee for Industrial Organiz- ation, will attend the school in the capacity of instructors.

The faculty committee made clear that any house which violates the agreement, once signed, would lose social ·privileges for the rest of the year and, would be denied the serv- ices of the Admissions Office for rushing next year's class members. Wikoff added that any such house would undoubtedly be expelled from the Interfraternity Council as well. Before Union men begin to make plans for the week-end, however, they will have to see to it that every fraternity accepts the condi- tions set forth by the committee. According to the terms of the pro- visional permission, granted yester- day, no dance will be allowed unless every fraternity cooperates as re- quested. Thus, as Wikoff pointed out in his statement to The Con- cordiensis, the failure of any one house to sign the committee's agree- ment will mean that none of the houses may enoy the week-end. Unanimous Sentiment Since the fraternities have ex- pressed such unanimous endorse- ment of the plans for the week-end thus far, however, it is not antici- pated that there will be any hesi- tancy on the part of the houses to accept the conditions set forth. If, as is expected, the plans for the week-end are completed suc- cessfully, the Interfraternity Ball, or Gridiron Ball, as it is sometimes called, will be held the night be- fore the last home football game, that being the Hamilton game. House dances will be held on the following night. The game is schedQ uled for the week-end of November 14th. Since the announcement of the Committee on Student Activities' action came only yesterday, no bud- get f()r the dance has yet been drawn up, and no chairman has been named. Wikoff, who was chairman of the dance last year, made it plain yesterday that as president of the council, he would not appoint himself chairman of the affair. ·Less Elaborate Pla111s According to tentative plans dis- cussed before the committee's an- nouncement, a somewhat less gran- diose dance than that ordinarily held in planned. The announcement by the ad- ministration committee climaxed a bitter struggle waged intermittently since last spring to retain this week-end, one of the only two ma- jor social events on the campus.

The entire affail· stands as an excellent example of the much-publicized faculty-student rela- tionship as it exis-ts at Union.

Art Lawrence has been putting the Dutchmen through l:ome stiff eli ills this week in order to correct tre mistakes made in the thrillin~ opener last week against Trinity I which ended in a 19-19 tie. The I Dutchmen came out of this contest ! 1 iddled with injuries. Bert Muhly, I stell'1r freshman guard, hurt his • right ankle early in the game and ! ,•;as replaced by Johnny Ford who ,-·as also hurt. Muhly, when ex- : amined, was found to have a ; chipped bone in his ankle and wir be out of uniform for u t least r ; r~onth and may net return to ac· tion for the remainder of the sea- ~ son. ' Car!'oll Injured in Practiee The squad tooi{ a terrific beatin· in the gruelling contest with the , Blue and Gold of Trinity, who also 1 suffered a large number of in- juries. On Monday, Lawrence had the squad limber up aching muscleo by running through dummy scrim- mage. Tuesday the squad got dow11 1 to business as Lawrence and Ralpr Semerad put the backs and line- men through a long, stiff session The ends were personally drilled bv Lawrence. The guards and tackles went through a long ses- sion of blocking and line tactics. The backs were sent up and down I ibrary Field, running through plays. The weekly scrimmage was helc' yesterday afternoon with rather harrowing results for the Dutch- men. Kennie Sharpe suffered a ncse hemorrhage during the scrim- mae;e, and Reggie Carroll's knee which was injured in the Trinity game was aggravated. Whether or not he will be able to play against Hobart is not yet known. The lineup for Saturday's game will probably be about the same as the one which started the Trinity game. Platt is set at left end and either Johnny Newton or Greg Mc- Kennis will start at the other end. Bill Hill and Hal Fox will start at the tackles, while Harvey Kayne. who played a bang-up game against Trinity will start at left guard and Dick Hoffman will be at right guard. Ken Sharpe will be at the center position. In the backfield, Reggie Carroll will start at quarterback if his knee responds to treatment. If not, then Karl Klarman will start at this post. Bob Bartlett will be at left half back and Chet Marvin at ' right halfback, while Hal Enstice • will be stationed at the fullback spot. Little is known about the Hobart eleven.

Dutcher Named Gridiron Ball Head; Hell Week Banned by Fraternities To Present Anderson's 'Eve of St. Mark' in Thanksgiving Production ~---------------.- \The Eve of Saint Mark.\ by I Maxwell Anderson, has been chosen by the Mountebanks as their first 1 production of the season, and will oe presented Than:ksgivi.ng week- end. Philip Stanley, who has been i associated with the Schenectady 1 Civic Players and who directed the 1 Mountebanks' production of \Can- j dida\ this past summer, has been 1 named faculty advisor and direc- i tor far the organization. All stu- i dents and members of the college · camrnunity who are interested iu [ any phase of production are invit- ~ ed to attend the two gene1·al meet- 1 ings on Tuesday and Wednesday : night, October 13 and 14, at 7:30 in [ Banna Hall. Plans for the •produc- : tion will be discussed, and tryouts· : will also be held at that time. I I Tht> Play The play, which opened on 1 Br~adway last night, is the first ' sertous piay written about the : United States in the present world i conflict. The story is that of a boy ' who is drafted before our entrance , into the war, and we see him sub- :' ject to extra-curricular pleasHres · and also the rigors of the training camp. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he is forced to leave his sweetheart on short notice, and is sent to the Philippines where he is reported missing. The play ranges from the bawdy comedy of the bar- racks to the tender love scenes be- tween the soldier and his sweet- heart. Some of the characters have been drawn from the men Marion Har- grove wrote about in his book, \See Here, Private Hargrove.\ The play is also not unlike Mr. Anderson's \What Price Glory\ in its robust treatment of American soldiers un- der arms. The title of the play is taken from the poem of the same name by John Keats. Its meaning is found in the old legend that on the eve of Saint Mark all those who are in peril of death are able to communicate with thuse they Jove. ---01--- Wardens Taut;ht At Campus School Air Raid Warden Instructors from Schenectady and five other nearby counties will receive train- ing in an intensive two-day course which begins on the campus tomor- t·ow under the sponsorship of the New York 'State War Council.

Dance To Be Fonnal In response to a rumor that this year's dance might be informal, Dutcher said that this had no basis in fact. \Dress will be formal,\ he said, \as we have always inter- perted is here-that is, tuxedos or tails will be acceptable.\ \We'll be expected to modify the big dance in some respects,\ the new chairman said, \but we will be able to maintain the fine tra- dition of good times and good fel- lowship which has marked Inter- fraternity Balls for so many years. As part of Union's biggest football week-end, and as one of the few remammg social week-ends for most of the men now in college, this dance should prove a worth- while affair.\ Dutcher, who until recently was president of Sigma Chi fraternity, is a resident of Harrisville, N. Y. He was director of this year's Freshman Camp and was a coun- selor for the two preceding years. He is an officer of the Outing Club and the band and has been on the Dean's List throughout his college career. He is an electrical engi- neer. Oommittt>emen's Records Wikoff, vice-president of the Chi Psi fraternity, is now set·ving his second year as chairman of the Interfraternity Council. He is a resident of Baltimore, Md., and an engineer. He was chairman of last year's Interfraternity Ball, rs a. membet· of the lacro:>se team, and a member of the Student Council Executive Committee. Lowe, who is president of Sigma Phi fraternity, is a civil engineer- ing student from Schenectady. He received his class numerals for freshman lacrosse, and was a can- didate for chairmanship of the In- terfraternity Council. Goodrich, who is treasurer of Beta Theta Pi fraternity, is a Di- vision II student from Albany, re- ceived his freshman numerals for hockey. He was a member of last year's Junior Prom Committee and a member of the Advisory Commit- tee of the college Democratic Club in 1940. Tripp, who is president of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, is a stu- dent in Division I from Mount Kisco, N. Y. He is managing edi- tor of The Concordiensis and chair- man of the Student Tax Commit- tee. ----a--- fire Prevention To Be Town Meeting Topic The prgoram follow's: taught by many of the company's be \New Peace Settlement.\ I. scientists as well as by members of Rotarians Hear Thatcher Symphony in C Minor.

THAT CRAZY BUNCH vVe cton't know how many other of the Sons of :llinerva wiU find it possible to join us, but we intend to go to :l\liddlel..Jtu·.v on Saturda~·. \\' e haven't experienced so much de;;ire to follow a football team to the ends of the earth since the days of Sam Hammer- steam. And we're not alone. We didn't expect to see anyone we knev; at Geneva last \Veek, and were pleasantly surprised when we ran into a goodly number of Dutchmen \Vho had also been \bitten l..Jy the !..Jug·.\ ~ ot the least prominent among those was President Fox \'ho for the benefit of those who might otherwise have disapproved of his maki11g the 200-mile trek, let it be known that he just happened to be at Geneva for the inaugm·ation of Hobart's sixth president. \\' e may seem unjust to accuse the president of rationalization, but we think you'd look for quite a while before finding a more ardent supporter of this year's squad than he. And who are we to criticize the president'? It doesn't matter to us what kind of record the team makes from here on in. We've seen enough of them to know that this 1942 team possesses more spirit than the last two teams put together. Which means that win, lose 01 draw, they're going to be in the game every minute. They proved that two weeks ago and, if we may venture a prediction, they'll prove it again. \They're the craziest bunch I've ever seen,\ said Art Lawrence, and we second the motion. Just crazy enough not to know when they're beaten. There seem to be crazy people aU over the wodd these days. There were \crazy kids\ at Bataan and Wake Island, and 1.\Iidway. And the game they were in has just l..Jegun. We think we're going that way, too. At least we hope so. Because we're just crazJ enough to believe that, without gas, tires, 01 money fo1· train fare, we're going to l\Iiddle- bmy. See you there.

Perhaps she's not interested in our get- ting drafted, but if she is, why we'll just whip right off to \contact Sue Cohen in Skid- more Hall\. -G. T. PROTEST In the field of publications, there must be a line of distinction dt·awn between material printed for public reading that \will get by most people without objection,\ and that which maintains those elusive standards which, down through the yeat·s, have come to be catalogued under the general heading, \in good taste.\ These two are not always syn- onomous. We do question, howeve1·, the ethical l..Jasis for using the name of Union's first war hero as an eye-catching advertisement, no matter how worthy the cause on behalf of which the advertisement is printed. An excelleilt example of what we mean is in evidence as part of the College Blotter, which, despite the steady stream of criticism it receives, can and should stand on its own feet and take its place with other student- activated ventures. We do not question its right to exist. We do not propose to make an issue of any- thing involving the memory of a man whom Union College came to respect, admire and love. We simply wish to raise our voice, 1 whatever weight it may or may not carry, in protest against such blatant disregard f01 that certain intangible feeling we call \good taste.\ UCR§ Monday 4:00~Club Matinee 5:00 :<.1usic as You Like It 5:30-Sign Off. 7:00- Fred Waring 7:15--Campus ~ews 7:25--Campus Sports 7:30-For Your Enjoyment 7:45--H.

We see ·him in Napoleon's battles along the Rhine; at Worms and Franl:fort; at Stuttgard and Zurich. Again, he is ~linbter to Switzerland, and shortly afterward a Mar- shal of France. With courage Ney combined coolness and sound judgment. In the heat ofb>ttle he stood in mar:ble calmness, observing every movement and never err:ing in his commands. T.hese qualities won his soldiers' hearts. He led men where no other general could. Time and again did Napoleon place in Ney's hands the fate of the Empire. Of the numerous titles conferred upon this hero, the worthiest was that of u Brav- est of the Rrave ··; to win.this name from Mu- rat, Macdonald and Lannes was great ~lory. A page froin the Marshars life will illuWate his character: Moscow was taken. The burning towers were flaring on the night ; houses were falling 1 walls were crashing down. With forty thou- 5and men Ney was detailed to cover the retreat. The soldiers suffered terribly. At every step some one succumbed to the weary march and pinching cold.

With the nation and the college again imperiled by the pres- ence of war, the college news- paper again takes on increas- ing importance. It can act as the most important single force in holding a war-time college together through the maintaining of morale as well as through the channels of un- dergraduate activity. Perhaps the present Con- cordiensis will be forced to suspend publication before this war is brought to a close. The future holds that possi- bility.

Chet Marvin, on a reverse, went 18 yards to the Hobart 43. Enstice threw a shod pass to Cliff Platt for 13 yards; pitched to Reggie Carroll for another ine yards and then plunged to the Hobart 19. At that point he rammed his way thr·ough the whole Hobart defense for a touchdown. Bob Bartlett's kick for the extra point was wide. Shortly after the kickoff, the Dutchmen got the ball again, but their drive stalled on the Hobart 29. Hobat·t immediately punted to its own 49 and this poor boot set up Union's second touchdown, as the Garnet offense went into high gear and hit pay dirt in nine plays. LeRoy Siegel and Bob Bartlett moved the ball to the Hobart 20 on several reverses and then Enstice tossed a touchdown pass to Johnny Newton. Bartlett's run was good fm· the extra point and the Dutch- men led 13-0. Coach Art Lawrence substituted his second team at this point. Siegel intercepted a Hobart pass several minutPs later on the States- men's 47-yard line. Don Quigley made seven yards. Ed Green plung- ed for two and Quigley made a first down on the Hobart 29. Siegel made five yards on a reverse and then Hobart was penalized five yards. On the next play, Quigley took the ball and ran the remaining 19 yards for the third touchdown. Bartlett's kick was blocked as the half Pnded with Union leading 19-0. SiPgel Seol'es TwiPe The Dutchmen kicked off to start the third quarter.

Bill Hill and Bill Howard are slated to be at the tackle posts, while Harvey Kayne and Dick Hoffman will flank center Kenny Sharpe at the guards. In the backfield, Reggie Carroll, ·whose knee injury has healed, will return to the quarter- back spot, while Leroy Siegel will start his first game at the right halfback post: Bob Bartlett and Hal Enstice were again named. to the left halfback and fullbaclt po- sitions.

These include Ed Bates, Hal Fox, Don Carstens, Treanor, Ed Smith, Bruce May, Max Slee, Tiger Alberts, Karl Klarman, Ed Green, Don Quigley, Hank Ho- chuli. Chet Marvin, Ford, LaPann, and Raymond. Middlebury will field a veteran eleven against the Dutchmen on Saturday. Five members of their squad are lettermen, and although they boast of only a few sen·iors, they are not to be sold short. They lost their first game to Williams by the score of 41-0 and last Sat- urday they were turned back by Tufts by 12-0. Williams is very strong this year, and further evi- dence of this is noted by their 19-6 win over Princeton last Sat- urday, for th£>ir first victory over SPORTS the Tigers si.nce the inauguration of this series. Starting for the Panthel'S in the line will be George Hal'I is and Art Pepin at ends, Tom Cruess and Bob Reuman at tackles, Co-captain Bob Adsit and Dan Colyer at guard, and Charles Puksta at cen- ter. In the backfield Ed Cooke is slated to call signals, from the quarterback spot, with Walter Swift and John Urban at the half- back post. while Bob Sheehan will be at fullback. \Football News,'' the AmN:can Collegiate football weekly, rates the Dutchmen at ·· 431 upon the basis of last year's per~ermance.

In order to Jll'l•Vent a let-down, Ketz sent the sc1uad on a six mile run on Tuesday and has schPduled a time-trial for Friday over the reg- ular 4.7-mile course. Next SatUt·day the hiH-and-dal- er::s meet the Middlebury runners over the home course and are ex- pected to win the meet, if last week's pE.'t'fot·mance by the squad is any criterion for the future. Ketz has been highly pleased with his squad's performance. His freshmen runnE'rs had been over the regu- .lar varsity course ·only a few times before thP mrPt and their time for the distance was creditable. The veterans from last year's squad turned in times that were exceNent for so early in the season. In ad- dition the showing of Wally Mac- Millan, who never ran cross-coun- tt·y until this fall, mal1es prospects for the future bright. In the meantime, Ketz is await- ing Friday's time-trials, for they should give him a good line on what he can expect next week.

The drive, which began yester- day and is continuing today and to- morrow, was described yesterday in a Daily Assembly talk by Demetrius Calogirou '44, chairman of the drive for this year. War Chest Funds from this year's Campus Chest drive will go for the most part to the \iVar Chest, which is organized on a national basis and includes organizations such as the ' Red Cross, the United Service Or- ganizations, the American Pris- oners' Relief, and the various coun- try reliefs. This latter group in- cludes the Chinese, Dutch, Rus- sia·n, Belg-ian, British, Greek, and other country relief societies. The decision to allocate a major portion of this year's contributions to the War Chest was based not only on the fact that the nation is at war, but also on the prefer- ence of the overwhelming major- ity of students, as shown in previ- ous campaigns, for contributions to the Rer Cross. The remaining money will again be allotted in proportion to their needs, to the local charities, most of which are already engulfed in the City Chest. Most of the or- ganizations which receive contribu- tions from the Campus Chest are already unified under either na- tion or local supervision. Thus stu- dent are relieved of the necessity of searching for truly needy. Freshmen Will Elect Officers Again Oct. 26 At a special meeting of the fresh- man class held in Old Chapel Mon- day, October 12, it was decided that the election of permanent class of- ficers would be held next Monday, October 26.

'The meeting was opened by New- ton and a p10posal to set the date of elections as October 26 was of- fered to the group. After brief dis- ct:ssion, a majority of the fresh- man signified thei·r approval of the measure. It was also decided that the nominations would be made at once.

Since According to Calogirou's talk yesterday morning, the Campus Chest is set up to secure a sa tis\· factory, but speedy and simple col- lection of money to be allotted to welfare organizations and charities in proportion to their respective needs or importance at the present time. Thus, this mt>thod eliminates the continuous annoyance to the individual student of petitions and begging lettet·s as it occurred on the campus in the years before the Campus Chest was set up. Budget Payments he expects to be in college until August, 1943, the Board considered him the logical successor to Rosen- blum. The Board meeting was attended by all but one of its 1942-43 mem- bership. Faculty members are Chairman Dean C. F. F. Garis, Dr. Burges Johnson, Prof. Harold Blod- gett and Dr. Gordon R. Silber. Rob- ert H. Hayner and Rosenblum rep- resent The Concordiensis, Clair Smith and Cyrus Wilson, The Idol, Thomas Hanigan and Harding Brown, The Garnet, Lawrence Howe. The Freshman Record, and Granger Tripp is ex-officio mem- ber as chairman of the Student Tax Committee. Wilson was absent from yesterday's meeting, while Cramer will take Rosenblum's place in the future.

The sales staff includes one mem- ber of each fraternity and several neutrals. Lowe said last night that one mor neutral salesman ·remain- ed to be appointed before the list is complete. The ticket staff will not be able to go into action until after the tick- ets have been printed and the price established. This action will be de- layed until the dance orchestra is signed.

However, he pointed out that he did not in- tend to sign any band until he had received price quotations from all available orchestrs. \We may be able to announce the name of our orchestra by next week,\ he said.

Fraternity Group Revises Charter Power Created to Expell Fraternities Upon 2-lrds Vote of Council Power to enforce its own regula. tions upon its members was created by the Interfraternity Council this week when it a·mended its constitu- tion to provide expulsion for delin- quent members. The amendment provides that any fraternity may be expelled for infractions of C.ouncil rulings upon a two-thirds vote of the member·s of the Council present at the meet- ing.

A pro- posal to change the time and place of meetings of the student body was rejected before it left the Executive Committee. It was sug- gested that the meeting be held during the regular chapel periods in the Memoria-l Chapel instead of in the Old Chapel on Mondays. Another proposal which was agreed upon in yesterday's meet- ing was that if any member of the Council should have an unexcused absence, that person would lose his membership and it would also mean a permanent loss of repre- sentation for the group that he represents. Social Committep George Anderson '43, president of the Student Council, announced the names of the Social Committee. The appointees are Robert Nemer- off '43, Robert La Pann '44, and Edward Stefic '45. At the Executive meeting which was held September 30 it was de- cided to have the nominations for new members of the Council on March 17. The other meetings will be held on October 14, Novembet· 18, January 13, February 23, anc. April 7. As was previously announced, America Abbruzzuse and Herbert Bredemeier were named members of the Council. ---o---· 1946 to Entertain Skidmore Frosh Last of Three Parties To Be Held Here Saturday; Dance Slated for Evening The class of '46 will play host to a group of Skidmore freshmen this Saturday afternoon and evening. It will be the last of the three Union-Skidmore parties, the first two of which wet·e held at Sara- toga. The program of the day will start at 1:30; when the freshmen of both schools will meet and be paired off. The couples will then attend the Union-Vermont football game. Next on the program will be dinner at Hale House. af.ter which there will be a dance. The festivities will end at 10 or 10:30. All this will be at a cost of fif- teen cents to the Union freshman. 0•---- Go On Sale This Week Fom· concerts to be held in Me- morial Chapel between January 15 and April 9 for the benefit of the scholarship fund, have been an- nounced as the third college con- cert series by President Fox. The concerts are offered under Tecom- mendations· of the Citizen Morale section of the .Schenectady County War Council. The system under which student tickets are sold for the concerts has been revised since the previous two series. Students may receive one ticket each at half the priced charged regular patrons. They may have their choice of any of the three price ranges being offered, with student prices established at $2.75, $1.93, and $1.38 for the series of four concerts. No Student Bloc No bloc or seats will be reserved for students. They will be avail- able to student and other patrons at the same time, so that students who wish seats should buy their tickets immediately. Tickets will be on sale at the College News Bu- reau. Full price must be paid at the time of purchase of the tick- ets. Although only one ticket wiJ.I be sold each student at the reduced rate, full-price tickets for adjoining seats will be available for guests. Concerts scheduled include The Nine o'Clock Opera Company, in a modern version of Mozart's \Mar- riage of Figaro,\ on January 15; Miss Dorothy Maynor, soprano, February 12; Anatol Kaminsky, vio- linist, March 26; and Richard Crooks, tenor, April 9. President Fox said in his an- nouncement that because the con- certs arranged by Union College last year and during the past sum- mer were over-subscribed and so enthusiastically received, \the· col- lege feels almost .obligated to offer the community a series during the coming winter and spring. This se- ries is not put forward in competi- tion with any other; it will stand on its own merits.\ Opera Company Here The Nine o'Clock Opera Com- pany, which will open the series, in- cludes eight singing actors. Pre- senting \The Marriage of Figa1·o\ in a coast-to-coast tour of 75 ap- pearances last year, this group was acclaimed by critics and the public alike for their streamlined produc- tion of Mozart's comedy in Eng- lish and in modern dress. Dorothy Maynor, who has risen to musical fame in a remarkably short time, will be the second Ne- gro artist to appear in the Union College concerts in a few days more than one year.

Thus w.hen thP The council has wisely realized that prac- tically the only vulnerable spot in the frater- nity's armor of autonomy is to be found in the realm of rushing. This, the reason for the second l~CHtion of the amendment, which, if i-mposed upon a delinquent chapter, would be almost a fatal blow at that chapter's l'e- Cl'Uiting system. To point to Hensselaer Polytechnic I nsti- tute as a model of anything may perhaps of rules and regulatim1s ha\·ing to do with rushing is in exi~tence there, a11d thL'Sl' rull·~ are enforced with the co-opemtion of the col- lege administration, which, incidentall~·, plays its part to the hilt, \Vith the knowledge of the importance of fratemities in the life of the college. In addition, the R. P. I. counci:l gains added pewer through its control of a sizeable budget made possible thmugh anmwl chapter dues and the receipt of fines collected throughout the year. Needless to say, the fines are of sufficient severity to make abid- ing by the laws of the Council most desirable. There is no need for worry over sufficient funds to sponsor such an event as an Inter- fraternity Dance, for each house Troy is as- sessed an amount equal to the membership of that particular house, and each member thereof is required to support the event_ Such a set-up is a far cry from that which we have known he1·e for so long. There are as many problems which should fall under the l 1 nion College Interfratemity Council as there are at the Troy institution. THE CAMPUS CHEST To dwell at length upon a cause as worthy as the current Campus Chest campaign seems to us out of place in these columns. No one nPerl be told of what the Chest is or what the funds collected lJy it are used for. No one need be told that it deserves just a little more than the usual support accorded to \mn of the mill\ student activities. It is conducted by ~• student chairman and a com- mittee of students who put in a good deal of hard \Vork and effort with the success of the campaign as their only reward. It is regarded with astounding indifference by the great majority of Union men each year, who, in this respect show themselves to be anything but typical of college men and women throughout the rest of the country. \Ye do not expect any Lette1· re::;punse to this year's campaign than has been e\'idenced in the past. A change of that nature cannot be accomplished by changing the personnel of lhe Chest committee. Such a change can only be accomplished when Union men are willing to sacrifice even a small part of the luxuries of the life to which they have become accuc- tomed. We can only hope that we al'e ovel'ly pessimistic on the subject and that that change has actually taken place. Whatever the results of the Chest this year, they can- not detract from the admiration \Vhich is due the chairman and the committee of the Cam- pus Chest this year, for their perseve1·ance and loyalty to their job, a job not sought- aftet· by the typical Union man. THE THIRD KNOCK benefit which can be derived therefrom Every indication is that the series of Col- lege Concerts announced this week will have every bit as much to offer its patrons as have the previous two. The artists who have been assembled represent a real opportunity for those who wish to take advantage of it. Disregard, if you will, the great amount of good accornplished by the use of the funds which will be realized. Beyond this lies the fact that the College is once again bringing to J.\Iemorial Chapel artists of a calibre rarely seen in towns like Schenectady. The cultural might well be considered more important than the financial benefit which the Scholar- ship Fund receives from the programs.

SCHAEFER, of the G-E Research T .a horn tory, used to collect snowflakes, and because of his hobhy metallurgists now have a simple method of observing details of metal structures far too :fine to be seen with an ordinary micro- scope. The young scientist's method of\ casting\ snowflakes in a film of F0rmvar has solved the problem of how to get a metal specimen thin enough to be examined in the electron microscope. (This device uses electrons instead of light to form the magnified images, and the electmns must pass through the specimen.) A thin film of resin, stripped from the specimen and retaining all the details oi the metal surface, ca;n be placed in the micro- scope and be magnified as much as IOo,ooo diameters. Thus metallurgists can learn more about the structure of metals vital to the war effort. CALAMITY JOE E VERYTHII\'G happens to Joe. And anything is likely to happen when he picks up the welder's electrode because Joe MaGee, an animated cartoon character, doesn't know the first thing about welding. Throughout the new G-E instruc- tional movie, \The Inside of Arc Welding,\ he always seems to du the wrong thing. But Joe does a good job of teaching you how not to strike the arc and how not to control the metal in the molten pool. His bungles, _plus close-ups of the arc in action, make this full-color film \one of the most helpful training aids ever made available to the _welding industry.\ The movie is in six parts. Each part (16 mm.) is complete in itself-a IO-minute sound production covering one particular phase of arc welding in full detail. Organized groups may borrow the :films with no charge other than transportation costs; schools and industry may buy single reels at cost-$52 each-for use in training welders.

Alexander Field in its stiffest test this fall. The Dutchmen, who complete the 11rst half of their eight-game sched- ule on Sa:turday, have gone unde- feated so far, while Vermont has lost two of its three games. Despite all appear·anccs on pape1·, Art Law- rence's squad will have a tough fight with the Catamounts, who have been vastly under-rated. Ralph Semerad sceuted the Green and Gold last Saturday in tht>ir game with Massachusetts .State, which they won 13-6. They have a powel'- ful running and passing attack that will bear a great deal of watching. 1n addition they have the highest scoring back in the East, Ralph LaPointe, a halfback, who has made seven touchdowns in three games. Above is the Garnet eleven which goes after its thit•d victory of thP spason Saturday against Vermont. Fr•um ll.\ft to right, in the line, are Jacl> Newton, Bill Howard, Dick Hoffman, Ken Sharp!.\ Harvey KaynP, Bill Hill and Cliff Platt. In the ba ckfkld, in tiH.\ same ordei', are Leroy Siegel, RE>ggil.\ Carroll, Bob Bartlett and Hal Enstice. Vermont was slaughtered in its opening game against Rhode Is- land State by 70-13. They improved the following week in losing to Rut- gers 27-20, and they finally hit the right side of the ledger last week in downing Mfl.ssachusetts State. They have apparently hit their stride and are well-prepared for the Dutchmen. starting elevens which will put on on aerial circus for the spectators, mixed with speed and deception on running plays. Off the R~ecord .Single-wing Shift The Catamounts operate from a single wingback shift, and their right guard and co-captain, Bill Benoit, calls signals. They possess a very shifty backfield which has shown up well despite its lack of i n ex p e r i e n c e . Pete Kadzis, a heralded freshman from Boston, is slated to handle the fullback duties, and he will undoubtedly keep the center of the Garnet forward wall occupied for a good part of the afternoon. Ncrm Beaulieu, at left halfback, is a hard runner and he does the passing as well. Monk Martin, a veteran, will be at the 1 quarterback post, and he will prob- ably do .the punting. LaPointe, wl:lo 1 is an excellent pass receiver, will start a right halfback. In additio'n, there are Johnny Refd, a ha!fbac:R, Bob Bloomer, and Ed. O'Connell who will see action in the backfield. Sherry Fogg, line coach for tpe Catamounts, has knit a strong line around Co-captain Benoit and Pbil Chesarone, center. At the ends will be Bart Barry and Harry Parker, a converted back. At the tackles will be Paul Walgren and Roger Prior, while Dwight Eddys rounds out the forward wall at left guard. There are a number of capable re- serves, including Art Kehoe, New- tie Goldman, Bud Lippman, and Don Murphy. So far this year the Dutchmen have blown both hot and cold. While they were favored to turn back Middlebury without much dif- gculty, they played a poor brand of ball last Saturday. No predic- tions on this week's game were ad- vanced by the inner circle, and the coaching staff is deeply con<:erned over Vermont's strength. In an effort to correct the num- erous mistakes made last week, Lawrence and Semerad have put the Dutchmen through several stiff sessions. A lot of time was spent on line tactics Tuesday afternoon, and the backs polished up plays. ·in signal practice. There is a possibility that Law- rence may make one or two last minute changes in his starting line- up, but the starters are fairly cer- tain. In the backfield Reggie Car- roll wHl be at quarterback, Leroy Siegel and Bob Bartlett at the half back posts, and Hal Enstice at full- back. There is a possibility that Chet Marvin may get the nod from Lawrence and will be at right half back. In the line, Cliff Platt is a defi- nite fixture at left end. Either Johnny Newton or Greg McKennis will be at the other wing. Bill Hill and Bill Howard will be at the tackles, Harvey Kayne and Dick Hoffman at the guard .posts, and Ken Sharpe at center. Lawrence has been using his re- serves sparingly so far, ·but he will use several of them a good deal. Don Quigley, Karl Klarman and Bud Green are slated for action in the backfield, and there are several other backs who may get into the game. Ed Bates will be kept out of the game at left end because of a leg injury. Ed Smith, Johnny Ford, Max Slee, Bob Mendelson, Hal Fox, Bob LaPann, and At Leroy will see action in the line.

In their two games away from home they have shown a Jot of fight and have demonstrated some Inspiring .play, mixed, of course, with some sloppy play last week. While they were on the road, they were followed by a number of fel- lows who found it possible to make the trip, gasoline, tires, and class cuts notwithstanding. On the team's retul\n from Hobart some 15 PSK's in ·good shape were on hand to greet them at 4:20a.m. When the squad trots out onto Alexander Field on SatuTday, it would bt> only right that they should get the sup- port of the entire student body, not just half of the enrollment. While the tenant of this corner is on the subject of football, it seems that there are two sore points, at least, which deserve mention be- cause of their widespread discus- sion. The first is with regard to the number of passes which mem- bers of the football team received during the season. For several years now the players have unofficially complained about getting only two pass£'~ during the season. Is it not possible for some adjustment to ·be made? The second point relates to the suggestion that students be allowed to take girls to the games ()Ill: their student ticl>ets, a practice which has worked out successfully in a number o-f other colleges. It would be an interesting e\'periment and no doubt very satisfactory to a lot of persons. The suggestiun has merits, a.nd a statement from the Athletic Department on this matter seems to •be in order. We take this opportunity to in- clude in our column an editorial from the Skidmore News, and since it has become the fashion to make some kind of statement about Skid- more at odd times, we happily take the liberty to do so. It is up to the individual reader to interpret this piece de resistance Interested in Yesterday afternoon the second stringers scrimmage against the third team for a while and then the first stringers were put in against them. The firsl team looked fairly well, but some of the squad's short- comings seem ever present, and the coaches are having a number of difficulties. The right side of the line looked better than it has in the past on defense ·but it still leaves much to be desired. Some of the plays have been revised, and several new plays will be given a try on Saturday.

We have often won- dered if they, tao, have joined the ranks of those who now exercise three times per week. The editorial: Vigor for Victory Physical vigor, on the part of millions of America's young men, will win this war, if it is to be won. Possibly soon, a new type of vigor will join the march, that of young women. For it will pro·bably not ·be long before we, too, will be drafted, as girls are already in England. We want to be ready for this, for the hard life of army camps, for any dangers we will have to face as a part of the armed forces. This will entail a little more than a leisurely game of tennis, a few strokes around a pool. We have to make ourselves hard, not only to combat cold winters with lessened fuel, but to be ready for whafever comes. The women of Russia and China have taken a large and important part in their country's war effort because they have been schooled from an early age in physical fit- ness. We at Skidmore can help our- selves, and in the long run our country, by sleeping sufficiently, eating regularly, and taking advan- tage of the facilities offered to us to talte care of and strengthen our bodies. All of this sounds hard and grim, but we can interject into our sports, into our exercise the joy of competition, ~q the knowledge that we are developing sound, strong bodies, as well as healthy minds.

Hallett wlil come to the Union dance during a road tour sched- uled to start after his present rec- ord-breaking engagement at the Tic-Toe Ballroom near Boston, The orchestra is described as being the sensation of the Hub area with its rendition& of \If I Were You\ \Loonie Little 'funey\ and many others. Many of its most popular selections are on recent Decca rec- ord releases. According to a number of popu- lar music lovers familiar with the Hallett style, its most outstanding characteristic is the fact that it is always danceable. Hallett's band plays with a heavily emphasized beat, without slow dragging num- bers and with few \jam\ arrange- ments. Among the several other orches- tras which have based their style upon that of Mal Hallett is Bob Chester. Hallett himself plays no instru- ment as he leads his band. He is described as a \master showman and distinctive leader\. He is .six feet, six inches tall. Featured performers for the In- terfraternity Ball 'band include Jerry Perkins, sensational 18-year- old songster, and Buddy Welcome, novelty singer, entertainer and clarinetist. HaiJett's band has toured the outstanding dance spots of the country, including the Steel Pier at Atlantic City, the Waldorf As- toria Hotel in New Yot•k City, the Coconut Grove in Hollywood, and the Edison Hotel in New York. One considerable portion of his career has been the making of mu- sical short subjects with Warner Brothers' Studios in Hollywood. Perhaps the most interesting as- pect of Hallett's appearance at this year's Interfraternity Ball is the fact that he provided the music for the first dance in this series, held in 1938. Since the 1942 dance is being hailed by many students as \prob- ably the last Interfraternity Ball for the duration\ Hallett may en- joy the distinction of having led the .band at the first and last Inter- fraternity Council-sponsored dance. The Hallett band came to the 1938 Ball shortly after his engage- ment at the Steel Pier in Atlantic City and one in Dallas, Texas. At that time, the Dallas \Morning New~\ had this to say for Hallett's band: \Hallett's band pursues both the cooler and the warmer matters, doing excellently with each. His rhythm and brass ~ections are about as good as you'll ever hear. Maestro Ha,llett. a tall New Englander, is a first rate musician and a very in- teresting personality.\ ---01--- Tidmarsh to Present Halloween Program Sunday Dr. Elmer A.

The following Satm·day aftemoon's action seemed to vindicate our judgment. Last Saturday, Union men had a chance to see the boys in action again after a two-week absence. This time, however, they were never behind, and had a chance to look the best they have all year. \It is schedule unfortunate that the Engineers' is such that the team had to meet its two toughest opponents in the first two games.\ In other words, Union is not to be considet·ed in the same class with Hamilton Daily Assembly-Speaker, Theodore Vinick, '43, Memorial Chapel, 10:00 a. m.

It may be a bit more difficult to arrange fat· transportation this year, but re- member, we saw Union faces at Hobart and at Geneva, and Troy is a good deal closer than either. Which brings us to the point of this piece: against R. P. L again Saturday, for the fol'ty- fil·st time! Ever since befol'e the turn of the century, almost every fall has seen an R. P. I.- Union football game, and this year (and we're thankful for it) is no exception. The last two occasions on which the two tearns met haven't been very pleasm1t for us, we'll admit, but we think the Engineers may be in for a surprise this year. In spite of the fine record compiled by the Dutchmen thus far, it appears that the Slide Rule Boys are still under-rating us.

We can see no reason why at least half the student body of this college shouldn't be on hand, not only to lend a little voc«l support to a grand ball club, but, incidentally, to see a fine ball game.

The Trojans are c0ached this year by Paul \P0p\ Graham, who was. a>-sista nt to Duke Nelson before he. left to join the Navy.

Lemke Dangerous Warren Lemke, a speedster· and hard runner, who scored four touch- downs against the Dutchmen last year, will start at the tailback spot for the Trojans. At the fullback post wiU 'be Don MacFarland who is also a veteran. He does most of the passing and is a good ball-car- rier. Ed Haller, also a veteran, will be at the wingback spot, while Bill Baker will call the signals. In the line, the Trojans lost their captain, left end Ward Cunningham, who left college, but they will be able to field a starting forward wall in- cluding five lettermen. Gus Brin- nier and Bob Curran will be at the wings, and they are the only two newcomers to the RPI starting line. Foster Bentley and George Frank are slated to be at the tackles, Low Nielwocki and Al Krug- at the guards with Jack Richards at center. Graham has a number of capable reset·ves including Ben Browne and Chuck Horsefall in the backfield and Banett Sands, Dave Lurie and Dick Bacon in the line. Art Lawrence has ·been drilling the Dutchmen hard for this con- test fot· the Trojans are stronger than earlier game results indicate. They have a strong passing attack to go with a powerful running game. The same eleven which started the Vermont game will be in at the opening kickoff. In the line, Cliff Piatt and Johnnie Newton will be at the ends, Bill Hill and Bill How- ard at the tackles, Harvey Kayne and Dick Hoffman at the guards and Ken Sharpe at center.

It was a p;ame marked by strong offensive football and from the opening play, When Platt ran back the kick-off 22 yards the Dutchmen were on the move. The Garnet marched 88 yards in thirteen plays to score the opening touchdown and gain a 6-0 lead. Along with the e~e and rapidity of the Garnet scoring the game was marked by the fine play of the line. For the first time this year the ends played good defensive ball and the middle of the line played its usual steady game . Platt took the opening kick-off and sprinted 22 yards before being downed on the Garnet 34. In a series of plays which was marked by two passes from the arm of Hal \Bull\ Ens:tice, the second of which was good for the touchdown by Bob Bartlett, the Garnet scored for the first time. Enstice Scores In the mid<ile of the second quar- ter Enstice went through center as the Dutchmen scored again, after a sustained march of 55 yards. Bart- lett then kicked off to LaPointe, who took the ball on his own 15 and ran through and over the whole Garnet team for 85 yards and a touchdown. The shock of this sen- sational run did not faze the Dutch- men for they then proceeded to score again in eight plays. Thie drive was marked ·by an off-tackle run by Ed Green who took the ball on his own 37 and ran 44 yards ·be- fore being caught on the Vermont 19. He would have gone the whole length of the field except for a block which was missed. The half ended with the Garnet leading 19-6. Klarman Sets Up Score At the beginning of the third quarter Karl Klarman intercepted a Vermont pass on the Catamounts' 49. \Bull\ Enstice then smashed through the Vermont line, eluding about five would-be tacklers for 37 yards, placing the ball on the Ver- mont 12. The Dutchmen lost .pos- session of the ball on downs but regained it immediately afterward when Karl Klarman intercepted a Vermont pass on the one-yard line. The \Bull\ crashed over for the last Garnet score. After Bartlett kicked the point the second and third teams were sent in. The Catamounts then took ovel' and marched 81 yards for their sec- ond and final score of the game. This drive featured the running and passing of Beaulieu and LaPointe, the latter who is the highest scorer in the East.

Defense Stamps, Roses To Be Combined to Make Patriotic Corsage Theme <»------- Plans for the 1942 Interfraternity I BaH progressed rapidly this week as members of the dance commit-~ tee anno1mced that arrangements had been completed for the pro-~ gram-favors to be distributed at the. dance, for the novelty defenee-stamp I cot sages, for the booths, for the decorations and for ticket sales. The defense-stamp corsages, which will be sold at the dance, wiH be ~:~nique in that they will contain fiowet'S as well as the usual 25-cent defen~·e stamps. Dance Chairman John L. Dutcher announced that by purchasing the corsages in ,bulk from a local florist, he had been able to combine the patriotic theme with the traditional flowers in a corsage that will be sold for $1.50. The corsages will be made on a green background, with two roses fastened above a semi-circle of four 25-cent defense stamps. The cor- sage will be held together by a bright silver ribbon. All four ·had previously been elect- ed to the same positions on a tem- porary basis ,.,·ith the exception of O'Neill allld Siegel, who changed places after this moming's ballot- ing. --~o~--- Freshmen Compete In Spelling Bee Annual Contest Planned For Monday in Old Chapel; 24 Men Will Take Part Freshmen will get their chance to prove their ability as spellers on Monday as 24 members of the class of '46, two from each section of English I, meet In the annual fresh- man spelling bee in Old Chapel. The contest this year will be con- ducted by Dr. Frederick W. Grover. Professor Burges Johnson will in- troduce Dr. Grover and award the prizes. The winning contestant will receive ten dollars, the man placing second five dollars, and the student taking third place two dollars. The prizes are donated annually by Mr. H. L. Baggerly, an alumnus who publishes a newspaper in Cali- fornia. Two attractive young ladies wear- ing civilian defen~e-worker uni- forms will ·be present at the dance to sell the corsages. Dutcher em- phasized that since the corsages were forming a definite part of the dance itself, everyone was expected not to purchase the usual flower corsages before the dance. He made it plain that there would be enough corsages available so that every couple would surely be able to pur- chaee one. The roses will be in a variety of colors, with colors match- ing any type of evening gown available. Drawings for fraternity booths will take place Monday at 1 :00 p.m. in the Trophy Room of the Gymna- sium. according to Earl Goodrich '43, who is in charge of decorations and the arrangement of the gym- nasium. Goodrich said that all the booths must be paid for before the drawing takes place. Only those houses which have paid for booths will be allowed to take part in the drawing. Others will have to take Madeline Greye, who will handle sO'me of the vocals with Mal Hal- lett rund hls orchestra during their appearance at the aillllual Inter- fraternity Ball on Friday, November 13 in Alumni Gymnasium.

Student and faculty opinion alike seemed wholeheartedly af;ainst the proposed move, which was insti- gat!'d by the Class of 1894 and ap- pz·ovcd ·by the Graduate Council at its meeting two weeks ago next Saturday. A E'tudcnt-circulated peti- tion of protest had been signed by more than a quarter of the student body by yesterday afternoon.

The second and third payments for the drive are due on November 18 and December 15 respectively, so that the students would have enough time for the budgeting of their expenses to meet the pledges. If the present trend continues, the drive, the funds of which ate to be allocated to the National War Chest for the most part, would be termed successful. ---·0·--- Hale Club Names four Additional Members Two seniors and two accelerated juniors were elected to membership in Hale .cJub at a meeting held on Tuesday of this week at the Delta Upsilon house. The new members are Everett McCarty '43, Fred Wi- koff '43, Wallace Morgan '44, and John Clowe '44 • The evening's discussion centered around Ferdinand Helm '37, now a second lieutenant in the Tank Corps. It was decided to hold the next meeting on November 17. Schubert, Sibelius Featured in Recital koff, '43, announced that the senti- ment of the Council would be car- ried, by him, to the President. The Idol's History The actual age of the stone image is unknown. The center of interclass wars since 1876, it was presented to the college in 1860 by the Rev. Dr. J. M. W. Farnham, who graduated with the Class of 1856. While Mr. Farnham was a missionary in China in 1860, workmen engaged in dig- ging a canal unearthed the figure and presented it to Dr. Farnham. Evidently the missionary was a grateful individuai and felt that it would make a wonderful gift for his Alma Mater. Overcoming diffi- culties entailed in the transporta- tion of the stone monster here from China, he obtained reasanable trans-, portation rates on an American- bound clipper which welcomed the cargo a.s good 'ballast. Upon its ar- rival here, it was stowed away in an old shed and not dusted off for some 16 years until it was brought once more into the light of day on the occasion of the commencement exercises of the Class of 1876 at which its donor was to be pre;ent. The traditional \painting of the Idol\ started almost immediately. The first of such artistic jobs was done by a group of four students who applied the paint brush to the figure out of protest over the un- sightliness of the statue. As the image lengthened its stay on the campUs, the painting tradition grew in strength. During the early years, it was customary for sopho- ~ores to kidnap a freshman, relieve hzm of the price of a can of green paint and then force him to paint Dr. Elmer A. Tidmarsh will pre- the idol \in honor of the freshmen''. sent his 531st Sunday afternoon The yearlings usually retaliated in organ recital this week at 4:00 p.m. kind, and the interclass rivalry Sunday in Memorial Chapel.

The world of sport offers many parallels to situations in life in the world at large. One of the most salient facts about humanity that can be found in the annals of athletics is the eternal uncertainty of events involving- liYing; personalities. One example was most ably demonstrated by a baseball team from St. Louis last Octobet· when it did what .every- one considered impossible. Another may \Yell be seen on Saturday afternoon on our own Alexander Field. Williams comes to Schenec- tady three deep in every position. They beat Princeton handily and they over whelmed all their other opponents. The~; are the best football team to come out of the Berkshire hills in the history of Williams College. All this is granted. But remember this. They can only play eleven men at a time. And all of those men put their shoes just the way the Dutchmen do-one at a time. So forget all you've read about odds and supermen and undefeated records. \Ve'H admit that's a J!lretty toug-h assig·nment, but remember it's t\\'ice as tough for the boys who are going to play for Cnion Saturday. Yet \Ve have a hunch that very little of the pre-game ba.lly- hoo will mean very much to them once the opening· whistle has sounded. They know their capabilities and they know they're go- ing to be playing against H1en just like them- selves who can make mistakes and, therefore, are devoid of all the attributes of supermen and above all-invincibility.

ORCHIDS TO THE GREEKS l.Jnion's fratel'!lities, which are now more rapidly beginning to realize their responsi- bilities on this campus are, beginning tomor- row evening, embarking· upon a com·se of co- operation in an effort which deserves as much praise as any they have ever under- taken. Cpon the sugg-estion and promotion of two men, the various chapters will, in the weeks to come, be doing· their share in ex- tending the hospitality of the colleg-e to the men of the Civilian Pilot Training Program quartered on the campus. These men, most, if not all of them, college men themselves are living on a campus much like that which they knew previous to their enlistment in the service. Yet. the training p1·ogram of which they are a part does not allow them to live a::; they see us living about them and this fact certainly does not make their task any easier. Out of this situation came the idea which was sug-gested and presented to the fraterni- ties by Robert Breiling and Junius Stephen- son. They have, with the cooperation of Lieutenant Johnson, commanding officer of the unit stationed here, arranged a schedule \vhereby the men will be invited to dinner at at least one of the various chapters here. This is not an act of condescension on the part of the fraternities, it is a most admir- able gesture of hospitality and friendliness to those who are living among us and it is a fine effort to help these men to get to know what kind of a colleg-e Union really is. 'TO HIM WHO WAITS' The old trial-and-error method of doing things is still being used here, as at many Jther places. The Dean's announcement re- gal·ding the change in morning- class sched- ules is certainly no more than ten years over- due. or at least four, because ever since \Ve've been here, we've heard irate professors give vent to their emotions on the .subject of lengthy Daily Assemblies and the ensuing. \demont!ization\ of their classes at 10:20. during the summer, and then unaccountably dropped, was a thing we have been hoping for ever since the first week of school. The advice to \don't come to class at all if you're late\ has, \Ve suspect, caused a good many unnecessary absences in the physical training program, and yet no effort has been made until now to meet the students half way on the problem.

Since then they have crushed four other opponents to ring up a total of 178 points as against only 13 p0ints scored against them. They hammered Clarkson 52-0, Middlebury 41-0, Bowdoin 19-0, and Tufts 47-6. On the basis of the only comparative game, that ag-ainst Middlebury, they should be distinct favorites since the Dutchmen were able to gain a 14-13 win only in the last few min- utes of play. Ba:eing its attack on a fast, shifty set of backs, the Purple has been able to wear down its oppone'1ts with a strong running game. In for this all-important contest.
