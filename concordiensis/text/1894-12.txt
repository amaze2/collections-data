OwiNG to the enlargt:d size of the pres- · .. ent edition, THE CoNCORDIENSIS was un- · avoidably delayed this week. \iVE wish to call the atten-tion of n1any of our subscribers to the fact that sub- . scriptions have been due for some time. · As the paper cannot be conducted without money, they would confer a great favor upon the management by remitting as soon os possible. THE foot ball season is over·, and Union bas a remarkably fine record; a record of which we are justly proud. Out of eleven games played, the garnet was victorious in seven; a·ornell, Willia1ns and West Point being the only tearns at whose hands · Union bas suffered defeat. The total score of the eleven games played is: Union 275 points against her opponents 107, leaving the garnet victors t>Y 168 points. For the third consecutive year, Union is champion of the New York State Inter- Collegiate League; the league score stand- ing l18 to 10 in ·union's favor. TV\'\O years a.go the garnet won the pennant by a score of 109 to 0; .and last year Union was again victorious by a soore of 156 points to 0. The game on 'Thanksgiving day closed the third of our remarkably suc- cessful seasons. Upon this occasion Union defeated Wesleyan by the handson1e score of 32 to 6, in the presence of 2,500 specta- tors. A careful estimate puts the total attendance at gaines in which Union has taken_ part during the past season, at 10,500. Now that foot ball is over, and it is necessary to confine all athletics to in- doors, the base ball and track athletic teanxs will begin their preliminary train- ing.. The track team will begin easy work at once, and gradually lead up to s:ome- thing more vigorous; and by the tiine the mid-winter meet comes in March, some excellent material ought to be developed. This will only be acco1nplished through steady work; and if a man wants to make the team next spring, he rr1ust begin im- mediately. It is very likely Willian1s will meet us again in the spring, and there has been correspondence with Cornell and Colum- bia concerning dual games; and if Union is to keep up the record set by her foot baU team, every man in college who can do anything in athletics must get out and do his best. A. strong team will be sent to the inter~collegiate gan1es in New York, and Union ought to get a very good place. In ihe State inter-collegiate games we want to do even better than last year, and add another pennant to our list. The out- look for track athletics was never brighter at Union than it is now, and you may look for grand results before the season ends. ..
