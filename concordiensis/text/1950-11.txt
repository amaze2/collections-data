BASED on the results of a re- cent student poJI held In Memorial Chapel the committee report noted that 45.7 per cent of the students contacted wanted a prom while 49.1 per cent favored the Winter Weekend idea. A small 5.1 per cent wanted neither. Parker also noted that of the 204 students who wanted the pl'om 134 cannot guarantee their attendance. The council turned the matter of holding and planning a Winter Weekend, including the setting of a date, over to the social committee. 1. Favor of Winter Prom. . . . . . . 240 2.

Spirit vs. Brutality Last Saturday afternoon, Union played what may be its last home football game against Middlebury College. In 1952 another team has been scheduled to replace the Panthers, and after the exhibition put on by the New Englanders last week, we are pleased. The game helped to prove a point we have held for quite some time-that small college sports events no longer have the integrity they are supposed to. In our way of thinking, schools of the size and athletic caliber of Union, where ath- letes are neither babied nor subsidized, should treat sports matches as just that, and not as modes of revenge. Never should small college elevens be out to \get\ rival players or pile-on unnecessarily in hol)'es of inflicting injuries on the opposition. Nevertheless, it appears that this was precisely what Middlebury's intentions were last Saturday, If we are wrong in the Middlebury case, and we may be, the principle still stands. This was not an isolated occurrence. The story is told of the Williams soccer coach who, in a pep talk before the Union game, said \These guys HATE you here! Do whatever you can to beat them. They HATE you 1\ This is the kind of rivalry which breaks down the high stand- ards of small college athletics, and it is occurring more and more with each passing year. Small college sports, supposedly completely unprofessional, is fast following in the footsteps of the big universities, which long ago ·became \profession- alized'.' and took on the aspects of big business·. Never let us do away with the spirit of college football. The old \Do or die for dear old Sciwash\ routine is still the greatest incentive in collegiate sports, but let us wasli away forever the stains of such talk as \Beat these guys anyway you can. They hate you and you hate them.\ Let us re- turn athletics to the high plane it should rightfully occupy- a rivalry abounding with spirit but not malice, a display of physical prowess and ability not brutality, a contest where opposing teams start out friends and end the same way.

Play Praised By Prof. Carl A. Niemeyer No production demands more of a group of players than a comedy, where there is no \message\ to impress an audience with real or imagined profundity. All the audi- ence must do is laugh. At the per- formance Tuesday night, the one seen by the Concordy's critic, the audience did, thereby amiably co- operating with the actors. A cer- tain amount of co-operation was needed, especially in the opening scenes of the play, which moved slowly. Then all at once the pro- duction, which-to change the fig- ure of speech-had been smoulder- ing, burst into a blaze which crackled cheerfully for the rest of the evening. If one had, at gun's point, to find the exact moment when the fire started, it would probably be Richard Heimann's entrance. As long as he and Gretch-en Witbeck were on the stage there was no danger of the fire's going out. ! ALL DRAMATIC productions, as the story of \Light up the Sky\ is Intended to show, are born in agony. With this play the Mountebanks had unusual diffi- culties, which need not be listed here.

GOOD SHOES FOR STUDENTS and FACULTY Patton & Hall X-RAY FITTING 246 State St.-Since 1896 THIS MARKED the close of a successful season for the harriers who lost only to powerful aggre- gations from Vermont and R.P.I. Five to Scrimmage Against Hartwick Although Union College doesn't open its regularly scheduled bas- ketbal season until December 5, coach Pete Uistad has had his var- sity aspirants practicing for over two weeks. Injuries and studies have sadly depleted what looked like a top notch quintet on paper. IN AN attempt to improve the team's basketball savvy, Nistad has arranged for a;, benefit scrimmage contest with Hartwick's classy cagers at Morrisville next Tuesday. The Union mentor has hopes that this meeting with a top notch early season foe will give his charges a chance to work the kinks out of their new 3 in, 2 out offense. The Garnet hoopsters have lost several veterans, as well as some g.ood freshmen since last season. One big los is Dick Speidel, who was captain-elect of this year's squad. But he isn't the only one. Also missing will be Tom Mica- relli, a reserve from last year, Stretch Butkiewicz, tap-in star of last year':;; undefeated frosh five and Marv Zepf, also from last sea- son's neophytes. Ray Pomeroy may come out for the squad, if his ankle, injured in football, im· proves. THIS YEAR'S squad will be built around three veterans of last year's varsity, Spen Warnick, Jim Carmichael and Dick Davis. Other returnees, who saw considerable action on the 1949 varsity, include Bill Kaznowski, Cookie Sherwin, Bob Faubel and Frank Chillrud. three cagers who starred for frosh last season. They are Bob Tighe and Gene Schwartzman, a pair of cool guards, and Bob Murray, a good rebound man, who will see plenty of action at forward. Tighe has been hampered by a knee in- jury which prevents his running at full speed, and as a result he may not reach full effectiveness until later in the season. v----------·-----------·· l I We Sell K&E DRAFTING INSTRUMENTS HAYDEN PHOTOCOPY 133 SO.

During the second and third periods, Union had almost exclu- sive control of the ball, but their efforts to tie the score were in vain. It toolr some time for the hooters to get used to playing on Hamilton's smal field. The boys also had to become accu~tomed to the slope of the field. \Most dis- tressing was the inability of the · players to reverse field effectively because of the heavy mud. THE DUTCHMEN will close the season's schedule when ,they encounter Colgate, away, tomorrow Don, Bunce, the exchange student, will also be playing his last game. He has proved a tower of strength for the team and played one of his best games &f the year against Hamilton. The game with Colgate should prove to be a very close match, but Coach Franz Gleich is confident that his team will make a good showing. The Red Raider lost to Hamilton 5-1 and went into a double overtime before losing' to RPI 2-1. The Engineers ripped Union 4-0. Colgate's team is made up largely of sophomores and features only three seniors, Cap- tain Bergmann, Herrick, and Mar- shall.
