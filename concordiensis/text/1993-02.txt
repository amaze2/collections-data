The system, which is used in many schools throughout the nation, will be put into use next fall. This decision is a result of President Hull's determination to avoid a· budget crisis for the 1993-1994 school year. The outdated system The current system, according to Janet Grey, director of Dining Services, does not provide Union students with the flexibility that students at other institutions enjoy. With the Vali-dine system, the Director believes, \The features are endless and the application for the future are phenomenal.\ Ms. Grey stated that \The College wants to make a better, more equitable situation for all. Union is doing something that all other schools have been doing for many years, but -we are doing it in a scaled down way. giving you everything under the sun.\ New aDd expanded facilities Next year, Upper Class Dining Hall will be open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., greatly expanding its hours of operation. The college plans to add an expanded salad bar, and a soft-serve yogurt machine in the dining ball. Changes in the hours of operation and what continued on pg. 2 by Christoph R:iDgwaJd. Concordiensis Staff As a result of a series of faculty workshops last September, Union CoUege faculty and administrators are attempting to raise the academic standards o£ Union with the intention of improving the school's reputation. \I want to raise academic expectations and standards that should probably translate into more work for the students,\ Dean of the Faculty· James Underwood stated. The faculty's main concern is the \commitment\ of the student body. Many faculty members feel that students are not spending enough time doing homework. A report revealed that Union College students are spending roughly eighteen hours a week on work outside of the classroom. In contrast, faculty members report assigning slightly more than nine hours of homewqrk a week. This translates to be approximately twenty -eight hours a week for a student that has three courses. \[ feel that if students aren't working outside of class, thirty hours a week, they are wasting the opportunity that they have,\ Underwood stated \What we would like to .see is students. doing a higher percentage of their homework,\ Chemistry Chair Charles Scaife added Faculty and administrators hope to raise the number of hours that students spend on homework by giving them more work. Alumni Letter Sparks Controversy by Caroline Paine Associate New Editor It is halfway tllrough winter term and students are eagerly awaiting spring term and graduation. Alumni are also anticipating this season as they prepare for ReUnion weekend. In November of 1992, each member of past Union -classes received a letter of invitation to return to their alma mater. This. usually welcome correspondence was greeted with disgust by Dr. Andrew Levitas, a member of the class of 1968. He felt that the letter implied that the entire class focused their Union experience on promiscuous activities. This was so disturbing to Levitas, that felt compelled to write a letter to Concordiensis calling attention to til·· wording of the invitation. The letter Dr. Levitas received~ inviting him to his twenty-fifth ReUnion by classmate Tad Knight, contained themes that question the quantity and q11ality of education received at Union. Additionally, it was degrading toward women. The letter addressed to the \Old Union Boys,\ asked its readers to consider how campus life has changed. It stated, \Think how. times have changed. For us, it was legal to drink and to have a girl in continued on pg. 3 However., not all professors claim that they have increased · the amount ()f work. In an exclusive Concordiensis survey, one in four professors confirmed that they are assigning more work this term than in the last. In addition, the same figwe holds true for the number of professors who are assigning more work this academic yem. Of the faculty that have raised the amount of work, most of them noted that it was in response .to faculty workshops. ••1 feel that if any extra work is to be given to the students, 1 it should :be of educational . value, and .not busy work,\ a · faculty member pointed out. Wheth.er or not it is a result of the facalty workshops, reports show that students have noticed a considerable increase in the amou:nt of work. The· survey also showed that nearly half of the students polled daim that they have noticed an increase in the amount of wak since the last term. In addition, slightly less tha11 seventy percent said that they have ·noticed an increase in the worl since the last academic year. The departments where most students noticed an increase in the amount of work were in Chemistry and English. One student pointed out a possibility of why some of the student bcdy has noticed an increase in the workload. \First I think that professors are expecting a lot more from students these days. Second, I feel that a lot of people are do:ing more b.omework because they choose to go out a lot less during tile week.\ \ the end. it is the faculty's judgment of bow much work to assign.\' Underwood said. Reports alS<> showed that the majority of the students surveyed felt that the workload should neither be increased nor decreased.

He has inspirationally led MIT'S attempts to bring together a mastery of technology with an understanding of the impact of technology and human affairs. Gray has also been influential in shaping engineering in America outside of the MIT community. He served as a meJllber of the White House Science Council a decade ago and was a member of its Panel on the Health of Universities. The Panel issued an impressive report wllich brought attention to the relationship between the role of universities in the nation's international standing in trade and U.S. living standards. Gray h:3S also served as Vice- chairman of the Council on Competitiveness, a Washington organization which reJ>resents the interests of busi aess. labor, and academia institutions. President of MIT from 1980- 1990, Gray founded the commiss.ion on Industrial Productivity which investigates the causes of inefficiency in the n a t i o .n ' s i n d u s t r i a 1 accomplishments. This organization has researched methods in which universities can address the nations problems. During his tenure, Gray champio11ed MIT's relations with industry, as well as the progress tOf major research and educational programs in microel.ectronics, health sciences, technology, communications, and brain and cognitive sciences. He has been comsistently associated with MIT since 19 50 and continues to teach and advise undergraduates today.

Dedication on Friday Fero House. which has been renovated to house offices for student groups that do volunteer community servke, will be dedicated Friday, Feb. 5, at a 4 p.m. ceremony with Union College President Roger Hull, Schenectady Mayor Frank Du ci and other city officials. Also expected are a number ofrepresentatives from the community service organizations with which Union students work.

Fer() Rouse history Fero Honse, one of the oldest buildings on the Union campus, llas served a number of pui'J)oses over the years ranging from a faculty home to housing for ROTC candidates and a fraternity. It was part of the original 1813 campus plan by French architect Joseph Jacques Ramee to balance the symmetrical design of the campus. Its location on Nott Street mak:es it one of the College's most accessible buildings for off-campus volunteer \VOik. The building was made possible b:y a bequest from the late Franklin L. Fero, a member of Union's Class of 1917. Fero. who died in 1989 at age 94, was for many years director and treasurer of Beechnut Packing <;o., later Lifesavers Beechnut fnc., in Canajol!arie, N.Y. He was president of Arkell Hall Foundati()n, major donors for the Schaffer Library, many scholarsllips, and renovations that als'O include the Arts Building,. Dance Studio and Lamont House at the College. Validine System Begins Next Fall continued from pg. l foods will oo available will be based upon student needs. Upper Class will chan~e from policy and may include an· expanded deli. The Rath:;keller, a popular dining fa~ility _for upper dassmen, will remain uncl1anged. The Skeller is already using the new Vali- dine cash register so that by fall term. tltere should be no delays in implementing the system. Terms and benefits There have been discussions about expanding the use of the Vali-dine card to include the bookstore, and a newly planned convenience store. Also, a sug,gestion from the Student Forum was that excess money on the card should carry over from term to term. President Hull subsequently decided that this idea would be incorporated into the plan. However, excess funds will not be carried over from year to year. President Hull. a supporter of the Vali-dine system, has reported tltat the initial investment ill tile new system will cost the College $70,000. However, he stated that \In the long run it will result in more students using college facilities, and will result in financial gains rather than losses.\ The new system has great possibilities. The new card will take tlle place of a meal card and a college identific.ation card.· The student's piJoto will be placed directly 011 the card. Dining Services relieves that this will help curl> tile number of lost cards aad will solve the problem of misuse of the meal card. Another benefit to the college is that the new card will decrease the amount of theft at dining facilities, currently a major problem that Dining Services is finding hard to controL 1t will also create a cash free system. When purchasing food, students will need only tlleir card. Other schools have been successfully using this system for many years. Dining Services is working hard to make sure that the new system provides tbe convenience and flexibility that Union students deserve. With the new system in place, Food Services at Union can improve food quality and provide the college with state of the art facilities. Arts Dean Sotight Courtesy of Public Relations The College is seeking applications from faculty members for the new position of dean of Arts and Sciences, it was announced recently by James Underwood, dean of faculty. The dean of Arts and Sciences will have operational responsibility for all undergraduate liberal arts programs (Divisions 1,2 and 3) Gradqate Management Institute. the Educational Studies program and evening programs in arts and sciences. Also, a research is under way for a new dean of Engineering who will have operational responsibility for all programs in engineering and computer science, day and evening, as well as the Engiueering Machine Lab. Both the dean of Engineering and dean of Arts and Sciences wiU report directly to the dean of Faculty/Vice President for Academic Mfairs. Directors of Athletics, the Library. Office of Computer Services, the Academic Opportunity Program and Terms Abroad Office will report directly to the dean of Faculty as will a new position that will likely be created, director of Graduate and Continuing Studies, ! Underwood said The associate dean of Undergraduate Programs and director of Academic Services/Registrar also will continue to report to the dean of Faculty. Lawrence Hollander, dean of engineering.- and Arnold Gussin, dean of graduate and continuing studies have announced their plans to retire this year. \The new dean of Engineering will have the same authority over all aspects of our engineering program, including day and evening offerings • that makes a lot of sense from the perspective of those programs,\ Underwood said. Underwood said that in addition to providing for improved coordination of undergraduate and graduate programs and better integration of day and evening offerings, the reorganization in academic affairs will provide for a more effective allocation of responsibilities among the deans. Underwood said the changes would take effect after June 30. : ·:;: '&Httrbt~fi.thtis Student Forum Spotlight by Julie Jamieson . The.

Levitas finds this apparent disregard for women's company contradictory to his classmate's semtiments.

He said he was sorry if he offended anyone. Knight also stated that Levitas most likely wrote his letter of response to Concordiesis because his wife must nave seen the invitations and was upset by it. When asked what his own wife's response to the letter had been, Knight replied he knew she was aware he was writing it but he could not recall if she had read the content.

Mrs. Tappa from Administration, and Prof. Nichols of the Political Courtesy of National Student News Service Many educators experience pressure to publish or perish, yet nearly all feel some responsibility to the students for whom the university is created. Or do they? Perhaps the oldest debate in academia pits the intrinsic value of classroom teaching against laboratory and field research. Both are necessary; the problem comes i11 achieving a balance between the two. The question is one of duty: should the allegiance of professors go to the students who pay their salaries indirectly through tuition, or to the administrators who provide them directly with paychecks? One side contends that much modern reseaTch is IJilnecessary and even wasteful because educators are pressed to \make findings\ at all costs. Another . argues that higher education should be dedicated to the propagation of new lmowledge and. hence, research is the central purpose of universities. Donald N. Dedmon. president of Radford University. is critical of current research, called a lot of it \tri' 'al II VI • \The reality is tbat much published research is not significant,\ Dedmon said. \We see an ever-in~reasing proliferation of journals dedicating themselves to smaller and smaller sub-fields within our disciplines.\ In an article entitled \Why Research Matters\ (Harvard Law Bulletin, June 1992), Louis Kaplow disagreed with Dedmon. Kaplow. a Harvard law professor, argued that \faculty who are heavily e11gaged in producing cutting-edge research are able to offer both a deeoer · understanding of past and existing laws and to challenge students to confront issues of the future.\ In some ways. teaching nourishes research. according to Kaplow. \We on the faculty feel great pleasure to identify previously unseen problems and to develop useful solutions,\ he wrote. \Teaching what is known is a fmitful way to discover where furtller research is necessary.\ Universities kno.wn for research face enormous demands from funding shortages due to budget cuts or, even worse, due to research failures such as the Hubble Space Telescope - which was extremely expensive yet designed improperly. Dedmon, meanwhile, advocates more research that impacts the classroom rather than the prevailing publish-or- perish ethic. \Teaching which is so little understood, is so commonly criticized, while research ~ irrespective of what is researched - enjoys exalted status in so many universities,\ he said. to Increase Work Load Science Department, two people who are involved with the Minerva Commit tee, welcome any suggestions that students have for future Faculty Who Admit Increase in Assignments speakers.

Also many investors do not like tobacco companies for the simple moral reason that cigarettes are bad and they do not want to encourage their use. However, if RJR Nabisco does decide to issue a separate class .of stock for their tobacco portion, there still remains the question of who would buy it. Sales are constantly falling. so there would not be a big dividend to enjoy, and its riskiness would be high due to the· constant fear that a law firm will ruin their profitability. As studies are continuing on the effect of smoking, the profitability of tobacco companies continues to decrease.

Who are the uninsured? Currently 36.6 million Americans -don't have health insurance. A look at who they are: THE COMMON COLD: Work status of uninsured by head of family: A Definition and Remedies The confusion and misconceptions about .. indigestion\ prompted Dr. Henry D.

Dr. Janowitz is one of Anlerica's prestigious authorities indiseases of the entire gastrointestiital tra.ct and now is the Profess0r Emeritus of the Mt. Sinai School ofMedicine.i\ll New York City. There are few books that I, as a physician, have read and reviewed that have clarified so concisely and so accurately the indig(!s.tion problems that beset so many thousands of people. The new book rightfully is called \Indigestio11\ and is published by the Oxf<lrd Univer- sity Press in New York By virtue of years of de_dication, not a single significant disease that is associated with some fonn of in- digestion is omitted from this bril- liant and concise treasllre trove of information. Besides his diagnostic acumen, Dr. Janowitz· has a keen in- sight into the psychological causes for GI problems and ps.ychol()gical overtones associated wit:h them. The greatest value of tilis excellent book will be to the laymen 'Who are caught in the quagmire of the \in- digestion\ confusion. Thousands of people, by neglecting the syrniJtoms of indigestion, convert a simple problem into a complex one by not having a thorough evaluation(}{ the underlying cause of this uni'Versal complaint.

In the U.S. and Canada alone 250 million colds per year account fo.r $5 billion in lost revenue and medical expenses. This is also reflected by the size of the pharmaceutical market for cold and coughs remedies. Over lOOO different products accounting for $1.5 billion. Despite it's name. the common cold is anything but common. It is not a simple disease but it is caused by a compilation of 200 different viruses subdivided into 8 classes. The largest of these class are the rhinoviruses, with over l 00 species. The symptoms usually manifest themselves as congestion, nasal drip; swelling, coughing, etc. The symptoms are caused by the irritation of the lining membranes of the upper respiratory tract. The average duration of a cold is 7 to 10 days. Some people refer to having a cold as \having the flu\. if indeed they are suffering from the flu, they are infected by one particular virus named the influenza virus. As any other virus, influenza is composed from a set of different strains, each of them more or less virulent. In the beginning of the century a particular strain of influenza showed tremendous virulence There must be some way to avoid doing the same thing for the next forty years.

It also contains an amphetamine. phenylpropanolamine. that although very rarely, can cause severe adverse reactions. This chemical is also an appetite suppressant found in the same dosage as a diet pill, Dietac. Exposure to cold weather does not lead to colds automatically. Colds are transmitted mostly by touch (very few vins units in a sneeze) and it is important to know that only about half the people exposed to the virus will develop an infection. Susceptibility factors Val)', it is greater for women· durin!! their menstrual cycle and for people who are generally debilitated because of stress and othe1 factors. It is important to know that as much as medical .science has progressed we are still unable to cure any kind of viral infection, (this is exemplified by the AIDS epidemic) all we are able to do is to alleviate some symptoms in the hope that the defense mechanism of your body will carry out it's function. COLD REMEDIES: Most mixtures of so called cold medicines contain the following: 1) An antihistamine (chlor- plleniramine, pllenindamine, etc .. ) 2) A decongestant (pheny- lephredine, phenylpropano~a­ mine, etc .. ) 3) A pain reliever ( A.S .A.. acetaminophen ibuprofen) It should be noted that the amount of decongestant in non-prescription medicines are too small to be effective. If you want to maximize your drug usage use nose drops or a spray. Here is a list of the common drugs consumed and their real effectiveness: DRISTAN: It contains a weak antihistamine in too small of a quantity to be effective orally. The only symptomatic remedy in Dristan is aspirin. CONTAC C: It is a time release preparation that NYQUIL: It contains a very str on g a n t i h i s tam i ne , Dox.ylamine, that in combination with the alcohol in the solution is equivalent to a 50 proof drink. It has then very strong sedative effects. NEOCITRAN: Even if one believes that the amount of Vitamin C present is effective, it has a very high content of sugar and should not then be consumed by diabetics. SINUTAB: Advertising im- plies that sinus products are formulated especially for sinus cavities in fact there are no differences between this and any other cold remedies. Many people today and especially the elderly, recei vc annua11y a shot of flu vaccine. W c must understand that this shot is not foolproof, it is conceived every year by aiJ.alyzing .a sample of air in the region and detennining which strain of virus is predominant at that time, they then proceed to inject attenuated or dead . virus particles into the patient and to let him or her develop an immunity against that particular strain. We must be aware that these viruses mutate continually so that a vaccine this year is ineffective the next until we develop better ways t; fight viral infections we are at the mercy of these micro- organisms and of our own natural defenses. In the case where the virus attacks those specific defenses. as in HIV well, needless to say ,thai .nowadays we are in trouble!!

Academy Award Winner Shirley Maclaine is Pearl Berman, a Jewish housewife who is greeted by a charming Italian stranger on the day of her husband's funeral. Joe spares no expense in wooing the embittered Pearl, who feels that life has dealt her a bum deal, and that she's far too old, and far too numb to care about another man. Melidandri thinks differently, and the wonderful escapade which ensues is a tribute to the youthful spirit of love as played by it's aging main characters.

The mcst important part of Used People is the way ittakes deep rooted ethnici~y and pokes fun at it without ridiculing it.

The star....:studded presidential balls could not hide the prevailing negative attitudes. ln fact, President Clinton entered office with the lowest voter approval ratings in the history of the Gallup Organization's .survey. Customarily there is a \honeymoon\ for incGming p:Fesidents which is accompanied by a sense of great expectations. Where is this nationwide feeling of support for Mr. Bill Clinton? First of all, not many people voted for Clinton. They voted to get rid of George Bush. Evidence of this is seen in R()ss Perot's springtime surge in popularity. His' initial strength lay in the fact that he was neither Clinton nor Bush. Brnt in .the end, Perot blew it, mainly due to the fact that he pulled out of the race halfway through, which left Clinton in the lead. However, the \people's movement\ that put Clinton into office does not have as much power as the title implies. Clinton took the presidency with 43% of the popular vote, only 5% more than Bush's 38%. In comparison to the 1988 election where Micheal Dukakis scored 46% of the popular vote. Clinton's win is even less spectacular. Buf most intriguingly. the number of campaign promises already broken by Mr. Clinton clearly states that his presidency will be Iac.kl11ster at best. The substance of Clinton's campaign was appallingly transparent. Gennifer who? But considering his recent actions, this alleged love affair pales in comparison. The choice of Texan Lloyd Bentsen to be Treasury Secretary may prove to be a good appointment. However, after Bentsen's departilre from the powerful Finance Committee, New York Senator Pat Moynihan filled the vacancy. In a recent TIME magazine interview, Moynihan sadly admitted that the committee has not heard a peep from Clinton or any of his top people. Finance's domain, Moynihan rightly states, \covers just about everything the President cares most about-economic recovery, trade issues, health care, welfare, Social Security, just about everything he got elected on. He's right when he says nothing he's proposed matters unless it passes Congress. So he either talks to us sooner or he tal.ks to us later.\ Obviously, this is not a good sign from a President whose plans entail taking massive steps of action during his first 100 days.

OPINIONS Let's See Football in Context by Amy Cypres Concordiensis Staff Considering my last few articles have been eaten by some computer force from the great beyond, I am warily attempting to get this one to press. But then again what I've got to say. cannot be silenced by some malfunctioning disc. (Why is it I feel like Doogie Howser when I ·write this column? I guess that's another story.) With the Superbowl behind me for another year (I pause to give thanks to the higher power and the NFL), I stop to ponder the state of relations between men and women, let alone how they ever get together in the first place. It simply makes no sense. We don't even speak the same language. It's as if every convers:ation leads me to look around. for some interpreter to ease the communication gap. (Yes another tangential thought, heaven forbid Mirriam and I start an article without going off on some tangent) But back to tile reflections on the Superbowl. It may be seen as the metaphor for the whole confusing attempt at gender relations. It has be~n calculated that the actual pl).tying time (not counting time outs, huddles etc.) of the 00?'-. 0\\, ~l;LL .. (lQ'r; ENOU~ . Superbowl is about 16 minutes. Unfortunately, it's what occurs during the other 3+ hours that brought out \this age old discussion. It's as if some tribal force propels even the most enlightened and sensiHve men to the nearest television set on game day. (As one enlightened' woman said recently, \There are lots of games, every weekend of a whole season, why do they have see this one?) These men flock to a rooin filled with other men and proceed to grunt, drink, and eat their way through the four quarters and lovely halftime show. (This year's spectacular show ... ooh MichaelJackson) The women in their lives suddenly fail to exist. And the same mystifying force that draws men towards the television, draws women (I'm sure there are some women out there who do honestly enjoy the ~a1ne and bey, more power to them) to some place filled with other women attempting to under stand this phenomenon. Putting our brains together, we came up with a few interesting issues that I decided I'd like to share. One, that men like this game precisely because it is an arena in which touching and affection are acceptable, Men can tackle each other, pile on top of another, and then pat each other on the butt; this action, as we all well know. is acceptable only in a sports context. Two, that the tension created between men and women is brought to a vicious head on game day which often leads to ... Three, the disturbing statistic about the increased rate of domestic violence, inflicted upon women dwing the Superbowl. This should scare us more than a little. No matter how flippant I can be, this statisti.c illuminates something darker and deeper than anyone would like to admit. I'm glad we're becoming aware. I'm glad the media bas decided to devote coverage to this issue. But, I'm skeptical about the results. Think about this, it is more than a number. It's a statement about men and women. It's a statement about the Superbowl. It's a statement about the correlation between a sporting event and domestic violence. We cannot shrug this revelation off. Because being ignored for the day is bad enough, violence is simply unacceptable. Let's hope things are going to start to change. and believe me, it's more than just a game. \1-\E g;\R.m oF f\ ~OR()I;~ 'N~~

<lloJtrvrbirnsis Genest Denial Under Fire To the Editor: The decision by the. Administration not to renew the position in Ancient Philosophy calls into questio11 both the College's commi>tment to its General Education curriculum and its: claim to be a liberal arts: college. It should go without saying (though, in the light of the decision, one apparently must .say it at this College) that Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle are the origina_tors and the foundation of the western philosophic tradition, and that any liberal arts institution worth.· its salt would want to have on its premises a person specially trained in the discipline. The rationale, no doubt, is that someone else in the Philosophy or Classics deprutment could easily teach a course on Plato or Aristotle. No doubt someone could. The study of ancient philosophy, however, demands both a knowledge of the ancient languages--would we be content with a Shakespeare instructor who could not read English'? --and an understanding of tile vast philosophical tradition that follows on Plato and Aristotle. As far as I know, no one of the current faculty in either Philosophy or Classics (except Prof. Genest) fits both demands. More alarming is the mentality at work here. Our operating principle ought not to be \how little can we get by on?'; we ought rather to provide our students with scholars who are fitted by training to teach in those areas that we think valuable or important. It is simply inconceivable that ancient philosophy would not be one of these, especially as we have a curriculum that offers classical antiquity as one of three areas deserving of extended study. When one adds to this that most philosophy students will need a course (if not more than one) in Platonic or Aristotelian or Stoic ph_ilosophy, it becomes even more mystifying why such a fundamental position is being denied. It apparently is not money, since, as reported in the Concordiensis of January 21, Roger Hull has pledged that 'this institution will not lay off anyone for financial reasons' (p.l}. It would be in the finest tradition of philosophical debate established by the Greeks if those responsible for the decision would present their arguments in public before an audience that could then discuss them and subject them to critical scrutiny. Sincerely, J. M. Mari·ncola Asst. ·Prof. Dept. of Classics Generation Language ... Gap To the Editor: I am responding to Scott Brown's letter to the editor you entitled \Like Ya' Know.\ Let me begin by directly addressing the author of said article. Scott, I feel qualified to respond to your article since I am your peer. Yes, I, too, was a high school student during those early \trickle down\ years, and I, too, made fun of the \valley girl\ syndrome, which I still do when I want to portray mental vacancy. However, I feel that your prejudiced, elitist comments could not go unanswered. You have set yourself on a pedestal of maturity, intelligence, high motivation, and hard work. Let's see just how steady that base is. The foundation of your pedestal is that simply because you do not use the word \like\ as often as you younger counterparts, you are somehow better than they, and qualified to instruct them as to proper vocabulary usage. I contend that you are intolerant, and prejudiced against these people. Commonly. as you have illustrated, those who harborprejudices never expend the effort to look beyond their own \superior\ noses to find LETTERS the source of their differences. You have condemned these ,peop!le before you've taken time to understand them. Where have you encountered these people of the \like\? Admittedly. you've not taken any time to get io know your fellow students. You see these people only in a classroom setting. Perhaps in this setting, laid against the back drop of the '1-don't-want-to- look-like-an-academic-geek-but- r-want-a-good-grade\ pressure, the average student becomes a bit nervous about speaking up in class. surely, in an evening class, here the average student is not in the 18 to 22 age range, you can understand the anxiety of a younger student not wanting to sound like a teenager. Maybe these students are~ unconsciously, using \lik!e\ as a chance to ·collect their thoughts, while holding the :floor of conversation. My own father, a graduate professor at SUNY A, typically employs tbis verbal hesitation, in the form of \urn.\ He is the most mature, intelligent, motivated, hard working individual that I've ever known. Another reason, for the \like\ syndrome, you've discov:ered by yourself, in your own article. Habit. You fell victim to it (the jarhead verbal pattern), and yet you fail to extend this foible to your fellow human beings. Two years ago, I studied with a professor, here at Union, who punctuated nearly every sentence with \you know.\ This habitual speech pattern at first was distracting, but once I got accustomed to it (see \tolerant\), it virtually disappeared to my ear. I had no problem comprehending him. Many people on this planet have annoying, or simply incomprehensible, speech patterns. Deaf people, people who stutter, or have cerebral palsy, all speak in a different manner than you do, Scott. W auld you feel \utter revulsion\ when encountering these indi victuals, and condemn then on the basis of their different speech patterns? I think you would not. I think tlut your maturity. intelligence, motivational power, and hard work exists al{lng side with a degree of morality. ....................................... ·<a \' ..

You, like me, arc not that much older than the other students here at Union. . I'm sure that the professors can•t tell the difference between you and everyone else, maybe umil you open your mouth. Think of yourself, five to eight years younger, and try to remember what you sounded like. I don't remember what I sounded like but I'm sure it probably wasn't far from what we hear here. A different time period, a different word, it's all relative, Scott. Take my advise, look at the bigger picture and mellow out in your old age, don't get nasty, crochety, and elitist. People tend to be lonely when they grow old badly. Sincerely, Anne Dantz '93 And the Debate Continues )o the Editor: No, Mirriam, a little introspection never hurt anyone. You will excuse me for not referring to you as Ms. Seddiq but I simply do not respect you that much. In your defense, I must say that your writing style is very good. Indeed, I don't know many people who Cal! evade an issue and twist words as you did in your rebuttal to my letter. Bravo! I'm sure your parents are very proud. I must also thank you for pointing out to me the huge numbers of people that know who I am on this campus. You would be astounded by how many people, greek ani:t non-greek, came up to me and insisted that I write a response. In regard to your statement on the timing of your original letter, I would like to point out to }'ou that I never suggested you attempt to make your point after rush was over. Inde~d that would not serve your· purpose or, more imnortantly, the people you w.~~ti JfYing to reach. I will qot,:·~t?wever, retract my claim that tlie' timing was devious as it could have been published in issueS' previous to the one in which it appeared. Your claim, however, that what you were doing was reporting is ridiculous. A good reporter reports. They do not attack. Aside from the fact that your letter appeared under the Opinions section of the paper, it was .completely biased and irresponsible jollffialism. You claim that Ms. Schlang alld I missed the point of your article by saying that what you were doing \was opening others' minds to the possibility of being an independent person on this campus\. Unfortunately, your snide and apparently bitter attack on the Greek system would suggest otherwise. If it was your intention to point oLJt the pros of being independent, then why didn't you talk about· the pros of being independent. Instead you chose to point out the cons of an admittedly imperfect process. Instead of opening minds to independence, you attempted to close minds to affi Iiation. I must also thank you for your suggestion th~t I take the class in Logic. I may do that. Now here is a suggesiion for you. Heed it or don't. I don't particularly care. Take a class in the meaning of words. You may have to go back to grade school for this but. believe me. it will help you in the long run. Brotherhood and/or Sisterhood does not au tomaticaiJy translate to dependence. The fact that during \hell week\ one may not speak to anyone who is not a member of their particular house promotes togetherness, not dependence. Indeed it is the very goal of the Greek system to promote both individualism and a sense of community at the same time. I can safely say, based on the amount of diversity in my particular llouse, that we have achieved both of these goals. Finally, I am glad to see that you made no comment on the impressive and admirable historical and social history that my house possesses other than to say that you would beg to differ. Very clever. The problem, Mirriam, is that you do not know. You do not care to know and I don't care to tell you. I sleep beautifully at night knowing that my house is, and will continue to be, safe in the hands of people who do know and who do care. Sincerely. Steve Bass '94 Do you approve of lifting the ban, thereby allowing Gays into the military? No Yes 34% 58% Unsure 8% survey taken from a ~andom sampling of 150 U11ion students ,.t •

The star-studded presidential balls could not hide the prevailing negative attitudes. In fact, President Clinton entered office with the lowest voter approval ratings in the history of the Gallup Organization's survey. Customarily there is a \honeymoon\ for incoming presidents which is accompanied by a sense of great expectations. Where is this nationwide feeling of support for Mr. Bill Clinton? First of all, not many people voted for Clinton. They voted to get rid of George Bush. Evidence of this is seen in Ross Perot's springtime surge in popularity. His initial strength lay in the fact that he was neither Clinton nor Bush. But in the end, Perot blew it. mainly due to the fact that he pulled out of the race halfway through. which left Clinton in the lead. However. the \people's movement\ that put Clinton into office does not have as much power as the title implies. Clinton took the presidency witll 43% of the popular vote, only 5% more than Bush's 38%. In comparison to the 1988 election where Micheal Dukakis scored 46% of the popular vote, Clinton's win is even less spectacular. But most intriguingly. the number of campaign promises already broken by Mr. Clinton clearly states that his presidency will be lackluster at best. The substance of Clinton's campaign was appallingly transparent. Gennifer who? But considering his recent actions, this alleged love affair pales in comparison. The choice of Texan Lloyd Bentsen to be Treasury Secretary may prove to be a good appointment. However, after Bentsen's departure from the powerful Finance Committee, New York Senator Pat Moynihan filled the vacancy. In a recent TIME magazine interview. Moynihan sadly admitted that the committee has not heard a peep from Clinton or any of his top people. Finance's domain, Moynihan rightly states. \covers just about everything the President cares most about-economic recovery, trade issues, health care, welfare, Social Security, just about everything he got elected on. He's right when he says nothing he's proposed matters unless it passes Congress. So he either talks to us sooner or he talks to us later.\ Obviously, this is not a good sign from a President whose plans entail taking massive steps of action during his first 100 days.

OPINIONS Let's See Football in Context by Amy Cypres Concordiensis Staff Considering my last few articles have been eaten by some computer force from the great beyond, I am warily attempting to get this one to press. Eut then again what I've got to say cannot be silenced by some malfunctioning disc. (Why is it I feel like Doogie Howser when I write this column? I guess that's another story.) With the Superbowl behind me for another year (I pause to give thanks to the higher power and the NFL), I stop to ponder the state of relations between men and women. let alone how they ever get together in the first place. It simply makes no sense. We don't even speak the same language. It's as if every conversation leads me to look around. for some interpreter to ease the communication gap. (Yes another tangential thought~ heaven forbid Mirriam and I start an article without going off on some tangent) But back to the reflections on the Superbowl. It may be seen as the metaphor for the whole confusing attempt at gender relations. It has be~n calculated that the actual playing time (not counting time outs. huddles etc.) of the OOP~. 0\\, 'N~LL .. ClQ~~~ou~. Superbowl is about 16 minutes. Unfortunately, it's what occurs during the other 3+ hours that brought out \this age old discussion. It's as if some tribal force propels even the most enlightened and sensitive men to the nearest television set on game day. (As one enlightened woman said recently, \There are lots of games, every weekend of a whole season, why do they have see this one?) These men flock to a room filled with other men and proceed to grunt, drink, and eat their way through the four quarters and lovely halftime show. (This year's spectacular show ... ooll Michael Jackson) The women in their lives suddenly fail to exist. And the same mystifying force that draws men towards the television, draws women (I'm sure there are some women out there who do honestly enjoy the game and hey, more power to them) to some place filled with other women attempting to understand this phenomenon. Putting our brains together, we came up with a few interesting issues that I decided I'd like to share. One, that men like this game precisely because it is an arena in which touching and affection are acceptable. Men can tackle each other, pile on top of another, and then pat each other on the butt; this action, as we all well know, is acceptable only in a sports context. Two, that the tension created between men and women is brought to a vicious head on game day which often ·leads to ... Three, the disturbing statistic about the increased rate of domestic violence, inflicted upon women during the Superbowl. This should scare us more than a little. No matter how flippant I can be, this statistic illuminates something darker and deeper than anyone would like to admit. I'm glad we're becoming aware. I'm glad the media \has decided to devote coverage to this issue. But, I'm skeptical about the results. Think about this, it is more than a number. It's a statement about men and women. It's a statement about the Superbowl. It's a statement about the correlation between a sporting event and domestic violence. We cannot shrug this revelation off. Because being ignored for the day is bad enot~gh. violence is simply unacceptable. Let's hope things are going to start to change, and believe me, it's more than just a game. \1.\E tGlRT\-\ op f\ ~ORt/~~ \N~F( ~v.._-1/Af f!.-N6\UlR 0 Nb ~1114 ~ ~tv\o\E COI't\~L ~NO fl..\\\\(;}\ ~S\G.R.!

February 4, 1993, page 10 · Long Distance Relatio11sl1i ps Alexis Leist Features Writer Since my first term, I've discovered that many people here. share something in com men with me: long- distance relationships. What's even more amazing is that these relationships really wor~! I've thought a lot about this and I've come to the conclusion that this is the hardest type of relationship to maintain. . 1 started dating my boyfnend my junior year of high school. As of now, we have been together for almost two years. While we did encounter some problems in high scho?l; nothing can compare to gomg off to college. At first, it was really hard for me to accept the fact that 1 wouldn't be able to see him, talk to him, or hu~ him everyday. What made It eve.n worse is that he 1 lefl for school before I did. So, when I cal.Jed him and he was out partying I got angry· . O.f comse, back then I d1dn t understand how collegeworked. I was very homesick; yet the friends I had made here understood this and ·were always thv.re to support me. Even now, I still cry when I get off the phone with him, but 1 know he feels the same way 1 do. For a while 1 saw only the negative side of my situation until. I really started to .experience college life. Jn high school, my boyfriend had always been very overprotective. Don't .get me wrong, it was flatte~mg (~t times) but someumes ll s~med as if I couldn't have any male friends without him doubting my loyalty· I th<>ugh t he ':_VOuld ·react the same way in college, but stuprisingly enough ~e did~'t. I could tell him stupid stones about my guy friends and he would totally accept it! I was amazed, but then I realized that he had changed. Not only that, but we had both changed in the same way. I understood that he could have good friends who were girls (did I mention th~t I was pretty overprotective myself?) and he understood that I could have good friends who were guys. Not having him here also meant that I could get closer to my girlfriends and not have to worry about splitting my free time between them. Get your hands CotJcordiensis and get a Grasp on tllo Campus Everything seemed to be W()trking out great. So, I'm starting to feel better about my situation until our first fight comes along. An:yone who has a boyfriend or gidfriend will agree that figllting over the phone has to be the worst thing ever! Well, it is even ten times harder when the fight ends and I can't say \Come over\ or, \I'll see you tomorrow.\ Luckily, I:d say our fights have been cut m hatf since I've been at school. It was hard to fight over something stupid when I knew I couldn't hug him the next day. Besides, the overprotective factor had been eliminated and that is what had caused most of our arguments. in the past. About three weeks after this fight, my boyfriend came to visit me at Union for the first time. I was really nervous Friday afternoon for his arrival. I kflow this sounds kind of dumb bUll I really felt like things . 1 w~uld be awkward. My hunch proved correct; things w~re kind of awkward. For the fnst fi'Ve minutes that is. Then everything became how it always was and I had a great weekend. I took him out to parties; and introduced him to · my friends. Sunday came way. t()O quickly and before I kn~w It I was m my room listening· t<J Air Supply and crying my eyes out. · Since then, I've gone to see him twice and he's visited me twice. I think the most important factor in .keep~ng .a lDilg-distance relauonshtp ts trust. I would never do amything to jeopardize my relationship. He is my b_est friend; and knows everythmg· aJ)out me. Although I wish I· c()u\d see him everyday, the few times that I get to see him mean that much more to me. Absence truly makes the heart grow fonder. People always 52 y college changes a person. I a_gree, but I think two people c.an change in the same way · Many people may not agree with my opinion of long- distance relationships; but as lcng as two people love each · ()ther and never hold back amything; I believe it c~n wor~. And if it doesn't, then tt wasn t meant to be in the first place. As if no one can tell from reading my article, I am an optimist/romantic/i~eali.st. Quite a lethal combmation. The Monster tn: the . Dining Ha11 Michelle Rosenbaum Contributing Writer Young children usually have a fear that a monster is. in their doset, preventing them from going to sleep. They fear this monster wiH come out and attack them while they are :sleeping. A strange, yet true .c.omparison is the. fear of food tbat many college women have. They fear that a '''monster\ is in the kitchen or diniag hall, . wh·ich will '\attack\ them after they eat. I mean attack in the sense that t:bey ''Will get fat. This fear builds up forcing them to constantly think about food, eating, weight and image. Where does this fear come f:110m? Why would people actually stress over a necessity foOr life? It seems so silly that people would stress over something that many of us enjoy. However, one out of ev fY twenty college women have an eating disorder. The number unfortunately changes every day. Many are not included in the facts since they do not even realize they have a disorder. Our society is based on thinness. Look around .you. Every where you go there is always a low-fat choice on the menu. From salad dressing to pudding, you can always find a Low-fat or even no-fat choice. As the advertisements say, they taste just as good or better than tLhe regular item. So why not stick witii the diet kind? It !tastes just as good and it has less fat. The problem is many lileople mainly women, believe they n~ed to eat lower calorie foods when they really do not need to. These people may fall in the category of 'being anorexic or bulimic. We have all heard these terms before, but many people do not fully understand what Write Pot Features Send to Box 83 u.s. and Somalia time difference AI any moment, it is eig~t hours later in Mogadishu ~han 1n t~e eastern u.s. The difference. - -- ----·-- --, · Eastern Time J Somalia time I 6 L a .. m~ ~Noon ~I SOURCE: World Almanac - -6 p.m. Somalia are two different disorders, however they have many similarities. Most people with bulimia . are near normal weight. They, however, do not see their bodies as looking good. These people usually are perfectionists, and emotionally insecure. As a result <they may binge eat and secretly vomit after eating. Anorexics, contrasting to bulimics, do not bi11ge eat. They simply lower their food intake or may literally starve themselves. They are usually the weB-behaved, 1rHeUigent,. happy people on the outside,. yet on the inside they are very insecure and self-critical. They- see themselves as constantly being \fat\ even tihough t() everyone else they look vezy thin. Eating disorders can cause all sorts of problems. B-esides the obvious change/ ill weight, victims may be extremely sensitive to cold, they may have hair, nail and skim problems, an absen~e of menstruation and gum disease. Th.ey also may be emotionally affected. They may result in de))ression, anxiety, and very low self-esteem. People who don't have eating disorders can't seem to understand why anyone would be obsessed with food. Sometimes the person with the eating disorder doesn't eve11 understand. It is a difficult condition to get out of. Some can simply stop thenr disorders by th~mselves, 11o·Wev'er th.e majority need nutritional an·d psychological he~p. You or your clo:sest frierud may have a problem and not even know it or may simply deny it, but you or your friellld are not alone. There is help out there, yet many are afrat<t to go. It is a scary term, eating disorder, just like that monster in the closet is: for children. Yet, when you were a ehild · the only way to ,get rid .of the monst-er was to adrn it _ to )'()Urself that it was make- believe.

FEATURES The Perils of A.K.A. Fluffhead Erin M. O'Neil Associate Features Editor Fluffuead and Wang Chung- the never-ending saga. Perhaps I sho11ld explain. Fluffhead and Wang Chung are aliases. That means those aren't th!eir real names. The reason I do not disclose the identities ()f these individuals is because F111ffhead is a regular patient of the pseudo-mental ward my room has become to a few select freshwomen; and the good doctor never betrays her patients 1 confidences. I d()n't know what it is, what attracts these unfortunate females t.o my humble abode. I certainly don't. I just kind of sit in the comer, listen to them pour their little hearts out to my roommates, and then. make some sarcastic remark. So call me heartless if you want, I think it's fun. My roommates are rn<Jre sympathetic, and are more than happy to d<>le out their sbare of sophomoric (pun intended) wisdom. Of all of the sessions I have listened in on however, Fluffuead's are definitely the most interesting, or railier, the most amusing. You see, Fluf:fhead is· infatuated with this senior named Wang Chung. They're friends, and I'm not quite sure if he's actually aware of the t()rch she carries for him. God knows we are. Every day there\s a new story. I know what's coming when I hear the so11nd of Fluffhead bounding up the stairs at light speed. \Fiuffhead! \ we cry as she flops down on our coucb.. \Guys I need your help. Wang Chung walked by me today and waved. But he didn't smile aad wave, he just kind of half-waved. He usually smiles and waves. What do you think that means? Do you think he hates me? Maybe he was just having a bad day. Maybe I said something stupid to him the other night. I don't kno~ what to do. What should I do?\ ''Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat????? ??????!J!H!!!!!!!,\ I think to myself. \And did I tell you he hugged me last Thursday? He did, he hugged me. And then, he yel:led to me from across the College Center. I think maybe it's love. Do you think it's love?\ \Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat????? - ??????!!!!! !!!!!!\ \It's time, I think. I think I'm going to ask him to my sorority formal tomorrow.. I think it's time. I mean, I know it's not until May, but I want to make sure I get to him before anyone else does. Do you thinlc that's too pushy? What if he says no? Do you think he'll say no?\ I'm not sure if I can hold it in much longer. \I think if we do go together, do you think we'll hook-up. That's what people keep telling me. If we do kiss, or something, I mean, I don't think I'll be able to stop myself, you know? It's been building up inside me for so long!\ That's it. I've lost it. \SHUT UP!!!!!!,\ I yell. Fluffhead looks over, looking slightly wounded. \Erin she asks, looking painfully pathetic, \do you think my stories are stupid?\ l.E.F. DEADLINE No ccmment, Fluftltead. Krusty (not her reaft name), is another one of our l'egulars. Krusty, unlike Fluffhead, tends to change her objects of lust, and I do mean lust , about every' couple of . weeks. Conveniently, she nev.er has to . change fraternity houses. Every night she goes out, like clockwork, Krusty arrives at our door to tell her tales of woe. , 'Guys, (sigh), he didn't talk to me again. He didn't talk to me all night. I know he saw me, ami he just walked right by. (sigll) I don't understand. He said he really liked me the night he found me sprawled naked on his bed. But now he won't give me 'llle time of day. I just don't unl{!erstand (big sigh).\ Are you kidding me? \But I think he'll come around. I mean, I know he's a really great guy. He sood I was . the only one he'd hook up with that night. He said the:re could never be another. M!tybe if I try the naked thing; again. Maybe then he'd se~ how special we are togetruer. Do you think?\ I d()n't even attempt to restrain myself this ti.m:e. \GET OUT!,\ I :scream. \Come back when yo11 find a real man!\ My roommates like to watch \Days of Our Lives\. Me? I just wait for Fluftbead and Krusty's nightly visits. Perhaps it's wrong fol' me to draw pleasure from other's emotional torment, btut hey, I'm a sick girl. Anyone else's problems are more intoeresting than mine. Esptecially freshwomens.

Julie knocked nearly three seconds off her old school record of 2:12.25, and also set a new pool record, shattering the old time of 2: 11.24 by an impressive margin in qualifying. The women's team is now 6-1 (prior to their meet with Albany on 2/3) and 31-5 in dual meets since Julie's freshman year, when Julie helped the team win the New York State title. Last year at the NCAA meet, Julie finished third in the 100 meter backstroke to capture All- American honors. To go along with her new record in the 200 meter backstroke, Julie also holds Union recmds in the 50 meter backstroke with a time of 27.25 seconds, and the 100 meter backstroke with a time of 58.82.

February 4, 1993, page 15 chach alk by John Srhachno\'sky Conmrdiensi.r Staff One of the major topics of the presidential campaign of · 1992 was the idea of international safety. How the world was shaping after the end of the cold war was of utmost ----------------~-----------~----~~importance. As the first as the Middle East If this is not a prime time place for our friends of Persian Gulf fame to make an appearance I don't know what is. Granted the United States does not have a game in the bustling metropolis, but the fact that an International sporting event would choose Beirut over other more appealing sites shows a hint of .stupidity in the mind of the soccer higher-ups. DALLAS COWBOYS TAKE THE month of president Clinton's term is in high gear, we realize the international scene is still a hotbed of discussion. CAKE ... AND THEN SOME The reason I bring up my \good friend\ Bill Clinton and the topic of foreign policy is because of a piece of news released on Tuesday afternoon. Before· I delve into my views, which are correct anyway, I want to leave a disclairner ... The news 1 heard was breaking news, so at the time of the article all that I knew of the story that international soccer hierarchy, better known as F.I.F.A. had ruled that a preliminary World Cup soccer game was to played in Beirut. That's right the Beirut in the hot bed we know by Rich Morgan Co-Sports Editor Back when I was a freshman in 1989, I remember sitting in the lounge on 3rd floor West (back when there were lounges in West). watching a meaningless football game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Washington Redskins. Dallas won the game, 13-3. in RFK. Stadium. The reason why I remember the game so clearly is because it was their only win of that season. Yes. the lowly Cowboys had beaten one of the top teams in the NFL, and a win never felt so-J good ... up until. 4 days ago. Who ·would have thought that only three seasons after that horrendous 1-15 season, the Cowboys would have · beaten the Buffalo Bills by 35 poilits in the Super Bowl? Not I...Well, O.K., just a little. At any rate, the win marked the biggest tum!lfound ·in Super Bowl history-and; boy this was definitely a Super Bowl of \firsts\- 1) Dallas forced a record nine turnovers, converting 5 of them into touchdowns (that's 35 points, which was· the exact margin of victory) 2) Emmitt Smith became the first player to win an _NFL Rushing Title and a Su(ler Bowl in the same year 3) Dallas head coach Jimmy Johnson became the fiJst person to win both a Su(ler Bowl and a Natiorml Championship (with the Miami Hurricanes) 4) Dallas becomes the only team to have been in 6 Super Bowls, surpassing the Miami Dolphins, who had 5 (Last appearance: SB XIX, when they lost to ~e 49ers) 5) The Cowboys twice sco1ed a pair of touchdowns in the quickest span of time in Superbowl history. The first two came at the end of the first half within 15 seconds of each other, .and the other two came in the second half, only 18 seconds apart. To top it off, the game was played flawlessly by the Magnificent Three of Big D- S uper Bowl MVP Tl'oy. Aikman went 22 of 30 for 273 yatds, throwing four touchdown passes in the process. Emmitt Smith rus.hed 22 times for 108 yards and 1wo touchdowns-the first rusher to reach the centennial mark in rushing yards. Finally. the \Playmaker\ Michael Irvin caught 6 times for 114 yards and 2 touchdowns. Both Alvin harper and Jay Novacek both caught TO passes from Aikman, as well. And what about the defense? Besides forcing a SB record nine turnovers. the Cowboys Defense scored two touchdowns off of one interception and one fumble that looked like an interception (I wonder if Aikman remembers the last play in the last Redsk:ins game). In fact, their defense nearly scored as many points as the Bills' offense (17-14). and would While security will undoubtedly be top-notch, the chance that is being taken takes away from the soccer playing. Am I blowing the whole thing out of proportion? Maybe. Am I just looking for something to write about? Possibly. The fact still remains that if Lebanon wants to raise their public image, like the story suggest, I can think of 50 other ways than holding a World Cup soccer game. How about giving a spring break vacation package. have outscored them· if it r----------------------- wasn 't for a backwards swipe of the ball as a· Cowboys defenseman was about to cross ' the end zone after recovering a fumble towards the last minutes of the game. Incidentally, that score that never was would have given the Cowboys the most points scored by a single team in Super Bowl history- but they still remain second to the 49ers · in that department . With a SB ring so soon, along with the fact that the Cowboys are the youngest team in the NFL, fans have to wonder if the \Boys are Back in Town\ to stay. Oh-and by the way, Emmitt Smith is up for free agency. My advice to Jerry Jones: Pay him whatever he wants.

<!rDnrorbirnsis February 4, 1993, page 16 Hockey Bows to Strong RPI Team by Dagan La C()rte associate Sports Editor This past Friday the Skating Dutchmen of Union faced off against division ri vats RPI. Entering the game, the Engineers bad sole possession of third place in the E.C.A.C., while Union was in dead last. The Dutchmen were h<>ping for some luck against RPI, but the Engineers, were adamant about preventing an upset. Just four minutes into the first period RPI took a quick two goal lead. Union pulled within one of the Engineers eight minutes later, when Ryan 'A.laspa scored his fourth goal of the season. The comeback attempt was short lived. Nine seconds after Alaspa scored RPI regained the two goal lead when Craig Hamelin put the puck past Dutchman goalie Mike Gallan~. Five minutes into the second period, Chris Sears tapped in a Shane Holunga slapshot on the power play again cutting RPI's lead to one goal. Unfortunately that was as close as the Dutchmen were able to get, as :R.PI exploded for five goals in the latter half of the game. Union's lone highlight of the final period came on a beautiful goal by rookie defensemen Reid Simonton. Simonton put on an excellent individual effort, skating through the opposition's defense, and tapping the puck past a· bewildered RPI goalie. The game ended in a 8-3 RPI win, their second of the season against Union. The Dutchmen are hoping· to end a five game losing streak against the Bears of Brown University. Brown has an overall record of 6-8-2, with a 5-5-2 mark in division games. The Bears are presently in fifth place of the E.C.A.C. Earlier in the season the Dutchmen lost to Brown in Rhode Island, by the score of 5-2. Browns leading scorer's are Co-Captains Scott Hanley and Derek Chauvet, both of whom have twenty points. Brown's last game was a 4-2 loss at home to the Catamounts of U.V.M., two weeks ago. Union is hoping to take advantage of Brown's two week layoff at Achilles Rink. Wo111e11's 1_,racl<: Rtti1s St1 1 011g at Capital District Meet By Liza Morse Concordiensis Staff The women's track team made an impressive showing at the Capital District Championships held at SUNY Albany last Sunday. The meet hosted eight local women '.s teams. The Union women ended up placing seventh scoring 30 points, revealing the extraordinary effort and talents of our four athletes who took on some sizable competition. Sophomore co-captain Nadine Filosi placed third in the 55M hurdles with a personal best time of 9.57 seconds. She also took fourth in the 500M dash with a time of 1:32 and third in the 800M dash in 2:48. Also competing for the women was senior Christina Monfasani. who placed third in the 800M with a time of 2:52. Freshman Nancy Mooar, after a week of strenuous training, took fifth place in the shot put. Sophomore co- captain Liza Morse ran the 1500M run in 5:36, and also took second place in the 1000M run with a time of 3:34. Right now, the team is looking ahead to the upcoming competitions at Williams and Colgate. With the great amount of work and dedication each athlete on the team contributes, our performances will continue to better once we face some tougher competition. We hope our other freshman teammate Jenn Evans gets over her injury soon so she'll be able to join us later in post- season competition. SWIM TEAMS HEADING TOWARD·S STATES by Lee Schachter Concordiensis Staff This week was a bi~ week for the Union swimmmg and diving team. With two tough meets, against Middlebury and long-time rival Hamilton, the team knew going in that it would take many fantastic performances to win both meets for the men and the women. The first task was to get by Middlebury. Both the men and the· women swam very well against Middlebury last Wednesday. The men started the meet by winning the frrst three events- the 400 yard medley relay. the 1000 free was won by Cliff Shaw, and Scott Bowden won the 200 free. But Middlebury won six out of the next seven events io keep tllings tight. ·If it hadn't been for Union's exceptionally strong depth, Middlebury could have put the meet away. Even though they were not winning those races. the men stayed right in there by consistantly outswimming Middlebury to get more points for second, third, fourth, and fifth place. Dave Robison and Matt Baumgartlleragain made a big impact 011 the meet by 1 taking first and second in the three meter diving, and first and third in the one meter event. Union sealed the meet when Sven Zabka, Chris Yousey, and Dave Lunianski took first, third, and fourth in the 100 yard backstroke, followed later by Union taking first and second in the 400 freestyle relay. The final score was 135- 108, Union on top. The women\s meet was not as close. Uni()n's women won twelve out ()f the thirteen events and won by the score of 154-89. Kelly Be'Van had three individual first places in the 200 individual medley, the 200 fly, and the 200 breast. Natasha Zabka took first in both diving events, and Kristy Holbrook and Amy Lamphere scored well in both diving events as welL Jonatha Meade won the 50 free aiJd the 100 free. Jen Allaire won the 200 free and Uz McLaughlin took first in ihe 500 free. In the swim of the meet, Julie Benker swam the ~00 yard backstroke in a time of 2:.09.35- good enough for the school record and to quailfy her for the A cut for the national meet- guaranteeing her of a spot at that meet. Bevan's swim in the 200 breaststroke qualified her for the B cut for nationals, which is ·IIOt a guarantee of making it to that meet,. but gives her a very good chance and is still a fantastic feat nonetheles;. '11he women also won both relays. All in all, it was a great meet for the women, as ihe depth did a fine job to ba.ck up the event winners. Harodlton was a much tougher moot for both the men and the women. Last year, Hamilton came in · second at states for both the women, and Union camf(! in third for both teams. ln this meet for the men, Hamilton's upfront strength wms too strong as they took first ill ~.1 of the thirteen events. But .!)ave Robison won both diving events, and; Union woll the 400 freestyle relay. In 'ltl1e ten events that Hamilton won. Union took second place every time. and took either second, third, and fourth or second, fourth, and fifth in mo~t of those events. That shows tremendous depth. Even though Hamilton won the meet b~ the score of 136- 105, Unloru came out with a positive atti:tude because many of the men. swam very well. Another imjpOrtant point to be made is that in a dual meet such as tiJ.is one, scoring heavily faw.ors getting first place, as ()pposed to having good depth. Taking first place outscores coming in second, third, and fourth. In the state championship meet, however, the opposite is true. A team getting first place is heavily . outscored by a team taking second, third, and fourth. Some highli:ghts from the meet for Union were some great swims by Chris Riley in the 200 free, Tsuyoshi K0bayashi, John Fitz:gerald, and Adam Horst in the distance events, Scott Bowden in the 100 free, and Dave Lunianski in the 200 backstroke. The W()men knew they had a tough meet ahead of them as well. It w~ a close meet most of the way through, and the Union girls won seven out of thirteen events, but 0nly one out of the first four. Going into the first round of diving, Hamilton was up 47-46. But Zabka, Holbrook, and Lamphere took first, second, and fourth in both diving events to help push the score up to 76-53, Union. The women took first in two of the nexf three events to extend their lead, and they never looked back, as they beat Hamilton by a final score of 131-110. It was a great victory, especially since Hamilton won the dual meet last year and finished ahead of ·Union at states too. This says a lot for this year's women's team. Eve11 though the whole team clearly swam well, there were some exceptional swims '-1hat need to be pointed out. First,. Union got three of Hamilton's pool records on Saturday: Julie Benker in the 200 backstroke, Kelly Bevan in the 200 breaststroke, and Jonatha Meade in the 100 freestyle. On top of that, two Union records were broken- the first by Jonatha Meade in the 200 freestyle and the second by Jen Allaire in tile 200 individual medley, which also qualified ,her for the B cut for nationals.' It was .a very successful meet, and it left the women with an impressive 6-1 for the seas.on. The Dutchmen are now looking forward to states and are getting psyched up for it. The women's states are at Hamilton the weekend of February 18th, and the men's states are one week later at Rochester. Congratulations to both teams on successful dual . meet seasons, and good luck at states! Remember; support the Swimming Dutchmen .and make a road trip! Come Support Union Hockey! Friday, February 5th: Brown at Union.

. , .. · arvnrorbirnsis February 4, 1993, page 16 i:t=:,·~~~~~~~~~~ Hockey Bows to Strong RPI Team by Dagan La Corte associate Sports Editor This past Friday the Skatin.g Dutchmen of Union faced off against division rivals RPI. Entering the game. the Engineers had sole possession of third place in the E.C .A.C., while Union was in dead last. The Dutchmen were hoping for some liUck against RP'I. l>ut the Engineers~ were adamant about preventing an upset. Just four minutes into the first period RPI took a quick two goal lead. Union pulled within one ()f the Engineers eight minutes later. when Ryan Alaspa sc()red his fourth goal of the season. The comeback attempt was short lived. Nine seconds after Alaspa scored RPI regained the two goal lead when Craig Hamelin put the puck past Dutch man goalie Mike Gallan~. Five minutes into the second period, Chris Sears tapped in a Shane Holunga slapshot ()n the power play again cutting RPI's lead. to one goal. Unfortunately that was as close as the Dutchmen were 2ble to get, as RPI exploded for five goals in the latter half of the game. Union's lone highlight of the final period came on a beautiful goal by rookie defensemen Reid Simonton. Simonton put on an excellent individual effort, skating through the opposition's defense. and tapping the puck past a bewildered RPI goalie. The game ended in a 8G3 RPI win. their second of the season against Union. The Dutchmen are hoping· to end a five game losing streak against the Bears of Brown University. Brown has an overall record of 6-8-2, with a 5-5-2 mark in division games. The Bears are presently in fifth place of the E.C.A.C. Earlier in the season the Dutchmen lost to Brown in Rhode Island, by the score of 5-2. Browns leading scorer's are Co-Captains Scott Hanley and Derek Chauvet. both of whom have twenty points. Brown·s last game was a 4-2 loss at home to the Catamounts of U. V.M.. two weeks ago. Union is hoping to take advantage of Brown's two week layoff at Achilles Rink. Woi11e11's rl.,racl<~ l~lll1S Stro11g at Capital District Meet By Liza Morse Concordiensis Strtjf The women· s track team made am impressive showing at the Capital District Championships held at SUNY Albany last Sunday. The meet hosted eight local women's teams. The Union women ended up placing seventh scoring 30 points. revealing the extraordinary effort and talents of our four athletes who took on some sizable competition. Sophomore co-captain Nadine Filosi placed third in the 55M hurdles with a personal best time of 9.57 seconds. She also took fourth in the 500M dash with a time of 1:32 and third in the BOOM da-;h in 2:48. Also competing for tllc women was senior Christiha Monfasani. who placed third in the 800M with a time of 2:52. Freshman Nancy Mooar. after a week of strenuous training. took fifth place in the shot put. Sophomore co- captain Liza Morse ran the l500M run in 5:36, and also took second place in the 1 OOOM run with a time of 3:34. Right now, the team is looking ahead t() the upcoming competitions at Williams and Colgate. With the great amount of work and dedication each athlete on the team contributes, our performances will continue to better once we face some tougller competition. We hope our other freshman teammate Jenn Evans gets over her injury soon so she'll be able to join us later in post- seawn competition. SWIM TEAMS HEADING TOWARDS STATES by Lee Schachter Concordiensis Staff This week was a b.i~ week for the Union swimming and diving team. With two tough meets, against Middlebury and long-time rival Hamilton. the team knew going in that it would take many fantastic performances to win both meets for the men and the women. The first task was to get by Middlebury. Both the men and the women swam very well against Middlebury last Wednesday. The men started the meet by winning the first tluee events- the 400 yard medley relay. the 1000 free was won by Cliff Shaw, and Scott Bowden won the 200 free. But Middlebury won six out of the next seven events \to keep things tight. If it hadn't been for Union's exceptionally strong depth. Middlebury could have put the meet away. Even though they were not winning those races, the men stayed right in there by consistantly outswimming Middlebury to get more points for second. third, fourth, and fifth place. Dave Robison and Matt Baumgartner again made a big impact on the meet by taking first and second in the three meter diving, and first and third in the one meter event. Union sealed the meet when Sven Zabka. Chris Yousey, and Dave Lunianski took first, third, and fourth in the 100 yard backstroke, followed later by Union taking first and second in the 400 freestyle relay. The final score was 135- 108. Union on top. The women's meet was not as close. Union's women won twelve out of the thirteen events and won by the score of 154-89. Kelly Bevan bad three individual first places in the 200 individual medley, the 200 fly. and the 200 breast. Natasha Zabka took first in both diving events. and Kristy Holbrook and Amy Lamphere scored well in both diving events as well. Jonatlla Meade won the 50 free and the 100 free. Jen Allaire won the 200 free and Liz McLaughlin took first in the 500 free. In the swim of the meet, Julie Benker swam the 200 yard backstroke in a time of 2:09.35- good enough for the school record and to qualify her for the A cut for the national meet- guaranteeing her of a spot at that meet. Bevan's swim in the 200 breaststroke qualified her for the B cut for nationals. which is not a guarantee of making it to that meet, hut gives her a very good chance and is still a fantastic feat nonetheless. The women also won both relays. All in all, it was a great meet for the women, as the depth did a fine job to back up the event winners. Hamilton was a much tougher meet for both the men and the women. Last year. Hamilton came in second at states for both the women, and Union carne in third for both teams. In this meet for the men, Hamilton's up front strength was too strong as they took first in ~~a of the thirteen events. But Dave Robison won both diving events. and Union won the 400 freestyle relay. In the ten events that Hamilton won, Union took second place every time. and took either second, third, and fourth or second, fourth, and fifth in most of those events. That shows tremendous depth. Even though Hamilton won the meet by the score of 136- 105, Union came out with a positive attitude because many of the men swam very well. Another important point to be made is that in a dual meet such as this one, scoring heavily favors getting first place, as opposed to having good depth. Taking first place outscores coming in second, third. and fourth. In the state championship meet, however, the opposite is true. A team getting first place is heavily . outscored by a team taking second, third, and fourth. Some highlights from the meet for Union were some great swims by Chris Riley in the 200 free, Tsuyoshi Kobayashi, John Fitzgerald, and Adam Horst in the distance events, Scott Bowden in the 100 free, and Dave Lunianski in the 200 backstroke. The women knew they had a tough meet ahead of them as well. It was a clos:e meet most of the way through, and the Union girls won ~even out of thirteen events. lmt only one out of the first four. Going into the first round of diving, Hamilton was up 47-46. But Zabka. Holbrook, and Lamphere took first, second, and fourth in both diving events to help push the score up to 76-53, Union. The women took flrst in two of the next' three events: to extend their lead, and they never looked back, as they beat Hamilton by a final score of 131-110. It was a great victory, especia1ly since Hamilton won the dual meet last year and finished ahead of Union at states too. This says a lot for this year's women's team. Even thougll the whole team clearly swam well, there were some excepti<:mal swims that need to be p()inted out. First, Union got three of Hamilton's pool records on Saturday: Julie Benker in the 200 backstroke, Kelly Bevan in the 200 breaststroke, and J onatha Meade in the I 00 freestyle. On top of that, two Union records were broken- the first by Jonatila Meade in the 200 freestyle and the second by J e11 Allaire in the 200 individual medley, which also qualified her for the B cut for nationals.· It was a very successful meet. and it left the women with an impressive 6-l for the season. The Dutchmen are now looldng forward t<l' states and are getting psyched up for it. The women's states are at Hamilton the weekend of Feilruary 18th. and the men's states are one week later at Rochester. Congratulations to both teams on successful dual meet seasons. and good luck at states! Remember; support the Swimming Dutchmen and make a road trip! Conte Support Union Hockey!

. -t. February 11, 1993 page 2 NEWS Professor Gmelch Writes New Book: Double Passage ae The Lives of Caribbean Migrants Abroad and Back Home by Matt Karlyn Concordiensis Staff .. Professor George Gmelch,. Chairman of the Anthropology I Sociology Department at Union, has recently published a ·new book: Double Passage: The Lives nf Caribbean Migrants Abroad and Back Home. In addition to D o u b·l e Passage, Professor Gmelch has also written three other books including. The Irish Tinkers: The Urbanization of an Itinerant People, Urban Life: i11terest in the Caribbean, but because of the frequency of migration there.\ He ruled dbt Trinidad not only because of its size, but also because \its ethnic diversity would have complicated the study.\ Jamaica is also ethnically diverse. However, safety may have been a problem for the stlldents he wanted to bring to the field with him. Double Passage. a .project that began in 1985. is one of tile results of Professor Gmelch's research in Barbados. The book \presents the lives and experiences of thirteen men and women from the island of Barbados who emigrated to North America and Britain and then years later retllffied home.\ could have broad appeal. \the topic isn't of great interest to many people.\ Professor Gmelcb has also been very involved with the Union term abroad in Barbados. Students who participate live in villages and conduct fulldtime research. They also meet once a week for classes and attend various fieldtrips. Their research includes two research papers. One focuses on the ethnography of the community in which they live,. while the other concentrates ofla topic of the students choice. The students must submit two research papers at the end of the term that are tY}Jically 50 pages in length. This- is a very unique tenn abroad and has a strong future. Last year ten students, of the thirty who applied, were selected to take part on the Barbados ter{Il. Union is planning to send more students to Barbados next year. Looking ahead, Professor Gmelch is CWTently conducting rest:arch on vario11s topics. including baseball. Currently, he has been working with two Union students who have helped him with this project. J.J. Weiner, who was an intern for the B urmingham Barrons and studied people who worked in baseball, and Biju Salgunan have been working with Professor Gmelch. An avid fan of organization, Professor Gmelch does not like to waste time looting for things. He enjoys publishing both books and articles, but admits that he is ••more inclined to read books years later.\ Double Passage is his latest publication and is · currently being sold nation- wide. illnttcllr bitnllin Student Forum Spotlight Student Forum Spotlight by Mike Quinn and Alex Sklavos Highlights: New clubs receive funding. The Winter Affair is a sell-out. What can we do ro help Bosnia? Many clubs have come to the Student Forum in the past weeks to ask for initial funding or additional funding. Among the .·different clubs that have asked for funding werelnnerview and Peer Facilitators. lnnerview , the campus film club, has been re- established after approldmately twQ years of dormancy. This club has one of the highest participation rates of the dubs on campus. It has already produced one movie earlier this term and currently has another in the works. They had been renting a video camera, . and have now received the money to purchase their own equipment Peer Facilitators are putting on a diversity week. This week will be filled with \Workshops that will hopefully appeal to · everyone. The P.F. would also like to bring in three speakers to · address the issue of ,diversity, and how it affects us. The P.F. were granted the money tbat they were seeking for the workers. The Student Forutn has been discussing what we can do to help the situation in Bosnia. We have decided to try to raise some money in order to start to raise consciousness on campus. We have also talked about having a candlelight vigil in honor of those that have died. If you are interested in helping please c<Jntact Lisa Levinger, or Seth Brown. The Winter Affair, Union's first all campus formal, is sold out. Just as a reminder, it is on Feb. 20 at the Ramada. There will be transportation back and forth. Buses will be leaving at approximately 20 minute intervals from in front of the Rathskellar and behind the Fieldhouse. Readings in Urban Anthropology, and To Shorten the Road: Folktales from lrelands Travelling Peoples. Urban Life is currently the best st:lling book in the field of Urban Anthropology. While in Ireland, where he lived for over a year. Professor Gmelch met with various people who had returned there from such big cities as Boston and N~w York. He soon became interested in how these people made the transition from living in a big city in the United States to living in isolated and remote places in Ireland. Professor Gmelch has published numerous articles and four books. His new book includes over l 00 hours of recorded interviews and more than 1200 pages of field notes and transcripts. He believes that if you are going to start on a Jlroject like this you want to be sure that \you have a really deep interest,. in the topic you are researching.

However, safety may have been a problem for the students he wanted t() bring to the field with him. Double Passage, a project that began in 1985. is one of the results of Professor Gmelch 's research in Barbados. The book \'presents the lives and experiences of thirteen men and women from the island of Barbados who emigrated to North America and Britain and then years later returned home.\ could have broad appeal, ••the topic isn't of great interest to many people.\ Professor Grnelch has also been very involved with the Union term abroad in Barbados. Students who participate live in villages and conduct full-time research. They also meet once a week for classes and attend various fieldtrips. Their research incl1:1des two research papers. One focuses on the ethnography of the community in which they live, while the other concentrates on a topic of the students choice. The students must submit two research papers at the end of the term that are typically 50 pages in length. This· is a very unique term abroad and has a strong future. Last year ten students, of the thirty who applied, were selected to take part on the Barbados term. Union is planning to send more students to Barbados next year. Looking ahead, Professor Gmelch is currently conducting res~arch on various topics, including baseball. Currently, he has been working with two Union students who have helped him with this project. JJ. Weiner, who was an intern for the Burmingham Barrons and studied people who worked in baseball, and Biju Salgunan have been working with Professor Gmelch. An avid fan of organization, Professor Gmelch does not like to waste time looking for things. He enjoys publishing both books and articles, but admits that he is \more inclined to read books years later.\ Double Passage is his latest publication and is· currently being sold nation- wide.

What can we do to ~help Bosnia? Many clubs have come to the Student Forum in the past weeks to ask for initial funding or additional funding. Among the different clubs that have asked for funding were lnnerview and Peer Facilitators. lnnerview , the campus fiiim club, has been re- estabfisned after approximately two years of dormancy. This club has one of the highest participation rates of the clubs on campus. It has already produced one movie earlier this term and currently has another in the works. They had been renting a video camera, and have now received the money to purchase their own equipment. Peer Facilitators are putting on a diversity week. This week will be fiHed with workshops that will hopefully appeal to everyone. The P.F. would also like to bring in three speakers to address the issue of diversity, and how it affects us. The P.F. were granted the money that they were seeking for the workers. The Student Forum has been discussing what we can do to help the situation in Bosnia. We have decided to try to raise some money in order to start to raise consciousness on campus. We have also talked about having a candlelight vigil in honor of those tb.at have died.

Many schools consider housing departments to be auxiliary operations and not part ()f fiscal budgets. Consequently, dormitories must depend on rmt I() survive. If too many rooms are vacant, universities are f()rc.cd to cut ~taff members and dose halls to balance the budget. The result is that housing directors now try to make residence halls look more attractive to potential residents. Housing directors say that many students arc used to having their own rooms with private telephones. cahle TV and other amenities. Students do not want to live with a roommate, share tile bathroom or eat in the cafeteria. Oklahoma State University now offers several incentives to persuade students iato choosing dorm life. School officials now extend discou11ts on single rooms for upperclassmen. Microwave ovens are available in dorm lounges, atlld more flexible meal plans are offered. FCC Fines SUNY Radio Station The Federal Communica- tions Commission has fined a State University <Jf New York student radio station: a record $23,750 for playing indecent music during afternoon hours. In January, FCC officials 11otified station ma11agers at WSUC (SUNY -CortBand) that tbey were being fined for illegally broadcasting a song by rap artist Kid Rock entitled \Yodelling in the Jungle,\ a euphemism for ornl sex. FCC attorney Marcia Diamond said that ra1is is the first case in whicfn a non- commercial radio station had been fined for indecency. Diamond explains that the song was deemed indecent because it describe:s sexual activities and organs in patently offensive terms, which is not allowed during daytime hours. WSUC Station Manager Daniel Lee said that the fine will be appealed hec.aus.e the broadcast cannot be verified by station logs. \If this (song) was broadcast, it was done by a renegade.\ Lee said. \It was d011e without management knowledge or management consent.\ The typical maxim tJm fine for such an offense is :S 12,500, but FCC officials stated that the song's indecency is of such an egregious nature that it warranted the high~Cr fine. Diamond said that the highest commercial fine for indecency was brought again:st Disc Jockey Howard Stoern for $600,000 in 1992. Many radio i11dustry observers are following the precedent-setting case of WSUC very closely. \This shocks everyQIIle,\ Lee said. \All the stations around here are just gaspin~. NPR is watching, and other college stations are looking on.\ Some critics have suggested that the severity of lhe fine could have been po li ticall y motivated by a Bush administration on tlle way out of power. Both the Governor of New York and the SUNY administration strongly supported Bill Clinton during the Presidential electiom.

February 11, 1993 page 4 BUSINESS AND FINANCE MINIMUM WAGE TO INCREASE BYlO% HULL KNOWS HIS BUSINESS by Adam Perlow Business Staff Since President Hull joined : :Union College, he has spent , much of his time dealing with ' ·campus wide cntlctsm. Never Feceiving next year. Sillce the President suggested that the money would have to be spent at an on campus food establishment and left over credit would not transfer to the next t~nn. I rebuttled by statillg that it is unfair to dictate where students are to spend their money particularly when the food establishments on this campus are not all that great. I even went as far as to ask tile President how he would feel if I arrived at his house that evening and told him he would now be eating his meals in Dutch Hollow. member of this community I could continue for pages listin9; in detail complaints I have about .things here at Union. However, the point of this article is to· promote the positive actions which President Hull is responsible for~ by Shields Day Business Editor This past week Bill Clinton has revealed that his economic advisors and he are going to raise the minimum wage. During his campaign, Clinton stressed tbat there needed to be both an increase in skills as well as an increase in the minimum wage if the lower income workers of America were to remain financially independent. In stating that he wants to go ahead with raising the minimum wage, Clinton does not want to wait for an increase in skills before advancing the minimum wage. The current plan is to raise the minimum wage by 10% from its current rate of $4.25 an hour to $4.68 an hour. Currently about 5.7 million Americans work for mm1mum wage, which calculates to roughly 12% of the work force. The main reason Clinton cites for increasing the minimum wag~ so quickly is that many families are unable to reach the poverty line because the current wage rate so low. The main concern goes out to families \'he work full time hours and are still unable to afford the necessities of life because they simply are no't bringing home a large enough paycheck. In addition to helping out these low income families. Clinton is also plans to enact an earned income ta:x credit, which will additionally aid families by allowing them to pay less in taxes and bring home more money for their families. The proposal is meeting a large amount of opposition frona many economists who feel that increasing the minimum wage will only prove to be a detriment to those families who need financial help \the most. Many economists feel that by increasing the minimum wage rate. Clinton will end up hurting many families by forcing companies to cut back on employment due to an increase in variable costs. In addition to a loss in jobs, \%rnern6er vour \\ 'llale•a.tinc tili.c open 'Door a LU\Ujuc btwlutore IZJ·IJb Jay .)L ::)ch.m«tad_v, ·.\:.\' 518·J46·27 19 there is also the prospect that thisincrease in mjnimum wage wilf not help farnilies due to inflation. Once the minimum wage rate is increased, pmducers must 11ow charge a higher rate for their products bec11use they are more e::tepensive to pmrluce, and stoJes can increa;e prices because they know consumers are bringing home a larger wage. Inflation Jllays a major factor in the decisiion of raising the minimum wage, but Cli11ton and his economic ad visors feel that tiJese costs do not <Jutweigh the btenefits. The rnos.t surprLsi11g fact of this proposal is that i1 has been advallced despite tlhe strong econ()mic recovery.

The most surprising fact of this proposal is that it has been advanced despite the strong economic recovery. For the first time in aoout five years all indicators are pointing to a strong economic recovery.

Job growth increased substantially in January, but this increase came mostly in the ~erv1ce industries.

n I ~ at.oJirDrb irnnin ANALYSIS February ll, 1993 page 5 A Tremendous L·OSS by Jim Polites News Analysis Editor Saturday, February 6, 1993 will forever be remembered as the day the world- and not just the sporting world~ lost a truly remarkable jndividuaL Arthur Ashe succumbed over the weekend to AIDS- related pneumonia, tragically ending a battle with the disease that is still today undefeated. His list of achievements and accomplishments on the tennis court are unmatched: an NCAA title ·at UCLA. U.S. Open and Wimbledon champion, representative and captain of the U.S. Davis Cup team, International Tennis Hall of Fame inductee- the list can go on forever. What was so endearing about watching Arthur Ashe perfonn was his tremendous grace and dignity in the face of pressure- it was a trait .that he carried far beyond the ~~ealm of competition. Today .. our most vivid image of the professional athlete is llis or her desire to maintain >- privacy. Of course, when stones are printed about these celebrities outside th~ realm .of sports, we are all too often subject to fights, drug usage and 'Other criminal behavior. Arthur Ashe was different. He thrived on the challenge of overcoming what he perceived as a social wrong. From his tackling of apartheid in South Africa to racism in sports to his final crusade against AIDS, Ashe was willing to take the lead on issues before it became popular to do so. His background is one that suggests this gifted individual was going to make noise in whatever discipline he chose. Growing up in Richmond, Virginia, Ashe ,learned his craft . on segregated tennis courts, this no doubt .served as the foundation for his passionate message denouncing racism in America. Throughout a glorious career, he progressively erased the stereotype that read tennis was a game for upper middle class whites to play- Arthur Ashe proved that such thinking wa:: ridiculous. A heart..,attack and quadrupl< bypass surgery in 1979 f()rced him into a hasty retirement, more surgery in 1983- this lime one that involved a tainted blood transfusion- would begin a 10-year struggle with the HIV-virus and AIDS, undol}btedly his most ferocious challenger yet. Despite this terrible disease, you saw Ashe out there in Washington, D.C. participating in anti-apartheid (1985) and Haitian refugee (1992) protests. In both cases Arthur Ashe was arrested f()r deviant behavior, but steel bars and fines were little more tllan distractions to such eloquence and passion. On April s;· 1992- feeling immense pressure and scrutilly from the media- Ashe reluctantly disclosed he llad tested IDV -positive over 3 1{2 years a~o. Immediately, he was thrust into the natiollal spotlight along with Magic Johnson as leaders in the battle against AIDS. The difference was this time, Arthur Ashe was a reluctant warrior. He had a terrible time deciding whether or not he should come public with his condition- he finally realized that the line of privacy protecting he and his family could be maintained no longer. As tragic as that news was ten months ago, those organized to fight AIDS had a new spokesperson, few could argue for amyone better. While Mag-ic J()hnson' s mere presence attracted attention from the world over, Arthur Ashe commanded an audience for his attitude, insight, and once again, dignity. Not once did we .hear him say ·why me\? That would have been far too simple. Instead, he started the Arthur AsiJe Foundation for the Defeat ()f AIDS based in. New Y()rk City, all organizatiom that has raised awareness and touched many throughout the nation. Short of finding a cure, Ashe's efforts have beell a rousing success. It should come as no surprise, for a mall such as Arthur Ashe didn't simply accept hardship. he rose and was galvanized by difficult undertakings. The only thing that could have robbed such a great man of llis zeal was his own health- 49 years of age seems !TlJ.lCh too short a time for someone who still had much to give. Earlier this week, Arthur Ashe was laid to rest in his hometown of Richmond and for days to come there will be accolades tossed from every imaginable public figure whose life was affect\d by Arthur Ashe. I think New York City Mayor David Dinkins summed it up best by saying: \Words cannot suffice to capture a career as glorious, a life so fully lived, or a commitment to justice as firm and as fair as was his.\ While we all mourn the tragic death of Arthur Ashe, we should at tile same time celebrate his character, goodwill, and athletic and social accomplishment. It's a record- and memory- that should live on forever. . .. nnrvr ttnsts Hull Knows His Business HAS MANY POSITIONS THAT ARE OPEN TO THE ENTIRE COLLEGE COMMUNITY.

Arthur Ashti! succumbed over the weelend to AIDS- related pnernrnonia, tragically ending a battlee with the disease that is slill rto.day undefeated. privacy. Of course, when stories are printed about these celebrities outside the realm of sports, we are all too often subject to fights, drug usage and other criminal behavior. Arthur Ashe was different. He thrived on the challenge of overcoming what he perceived as a social wrong. From his tackling of apartheid in South Africa to racism in sports to his final crusade against AIDS, Ashe was willing to take the lead on issues before it became popular to do so. ridiculous. A heart-attack and quadrupk bypass surgery in 1979 forced him into a hasty retirement. more surgery in 1983- this time one that involved a tainled blood transfusion- would begin a 10-y.ear struggle with the HIV-virus and AIDS, undoubtedly his most ferocious challenger yet. Despite this terrible disease, you saw Ashe out there in Washington, D.C. participating in anti-apartheid ( 1985) and Haitian refugee ( 1992) protests. In both cases Arthur Ashe was arrested for deviant behavior, but steel bars and fines were lillie more than distractions to such eloquence and passion. a reluciant warrior. He had a terrible time deciding whether or not he should come public with his condition- he finally realized. that the line of privacy protecting he and his family could be maintained no longer. simply accept hardship. he rose and was galvanized hy difficult undertakings.

What was so ende~rring about watching Arthur Ashe perfonn was his tremendous grace and dignity in the face of pressure- it was a trait that he carried far beyond the ~ealm of competition. Toda,,.. our most vivid image of the j}rofessional athlete is his or her desire to maintain His background is one that suggests this gifted individual was going to make noise in whatever discipline he chose. Growing up in Richmond, Virginia, Ashe learned his craft on segregated tennis courts, this no doubt served as the foundation for his passionate message denouncing racism in America. Throughout a glorious career, he progressively erased the stereotype that read tennis was a game for upper middle class whites to play- Arthur Ashe proved that such thinking war On April 8,- 1992- feeling immense pressure and scrutiny from the media- Ashe reluctantly disclosed he had tested HIV -positive over 3 l/2 years ago. Immediately, he was thrust into the national spotlight along with Magic Johnson as leaders in the battle against AIDS.

As tr<tgic as thar news was ten months ago, those organized to fight AIDS had a new spokesperson. few could argue for anyone betrer. While Magic Johnson's mere presence attracted attention from the world over. Arrhur Ashe commanded an audience for his attitude, insight, and once again, dignity. Not once did we hear him say 'why me'? That would have heen far too simple. Instead. he started the Arthur Ashe Foundation for the Defeat of AIDS based in New York City, an organization that has raised awareness and touched many throughout the nation. Short of finding a cure, Ashe's efforts have been a rousing success.

Last year, as seniors in high school we an thought that we were the coolest. Yeah, we were the big cheeses, the leader,s, the best-dressed, everyone wished they could be like us. Yeah, little did everyone know that all rny friends were dying for LOVE. When we were freshmen9 sophomores. and juniors we had always been friends and more than friends with upperclassmen. Then, in September of 0ur senior year we realized that our group bad moved on. On the first day of school that year, we realized that we couldn't walk upstairs to the senior hallway anymore to flirt during lunch or in- between classes anymore. We were the senior hallway. The thought crossed my best friend's mind fust: \Oil my God, we might have to be friends with guys in our grade! ! ! ! ! ! ! \ Oh, the horror of it. I came mshing to the defense of high school seniors everywhere: \Come on _guys, bow bad can it be anyway?\ My friends were not amused. \You have to be joking me!\ 1eplied my best friend. \Well why not, I can introduce you to Joe's (my b<>yfriend who happened to be a senior) friends?\ Another cringe from my best friend. \Someone with a mental capacity somewhat near mine might be nice!\ OK, so no body's perfect. We decided for now we would just see how things went. My best friend suggested we start taking out personals to find our prom dates. It was September a11d she was thinking aboutJunel Anyway, October rolled around and my friends .found themselves dateless for Homecoming. Now I thought I l!ad made a lot of effort to get my friends to hang out with my boyfriend's friends. They were harmless, just typical g11ys who are into .sports and more sports. My efforts were futile. I decided to leave my friends alone. Then one day, my best friend calls me up. \Guess who asked me to H()mecoming?\ · \No clue,\ !replied. \Can I die now Alexis?\ \Come on, just tell me!\ \OK she said \he's one of Joe's friends.\ She paused as if she expected me to be surprised. Of course, I wasn't because I had known tllis three weeks ago. \Fine 1~11 just tell you,.CHRIS!@#@\ Now, my best friend would not give this ·kid the time of day she made fun of him all the time. Words I had never heard before suddenly came out of her mouth: \He's really not such a bad guy, and he does play baseball, and he is pretty big, a11d be wears nice clothes, so I told him that I would go.\ UNBELIEVABLE. I was shocked, two seconds later my boyfriend called and told me the same news in the sam.e disbelief. I told my other friends. The whole school was equally as shocked as I had been. Homecoming came and went, no big deal. I never th()ught I would hear the word Cfuis out of my friend's moutil again. Then Friday roll-ed awund. \Oh by the way Alexis I can't go out tonight because I'm seeing Chris.\ What the hell was going on? I put Joe through the Spanish Inquisition yet he knew no1b.ing. Guys have very good willpower when it comes to keeping their mouth shut. Fri.day night I got a phone call at 2 A.M. \We're now officially together!\ Oh God, I th()ng_ht. If they ever got in a fight Joe and I would be stuck right in the middle of it. A horrible winter of double dates very Saturday suddenly crossed my mind. I decided I'd give ·them until No-vember. In· November I decided I would give them until December. In May I decided that I would give them until June. In August I decided I wouldgjve them until September (I called it that time). It was a very interesting relationship. Y em see, my best friend was considered untouchable. She had gone out with other guys before but it had never lasted .. Nobody had ever been good enough, Sut, as I watched them, I realized there was sornetl!ing really special there. My boyfriend took all the credit of course. But I was really happy for my best friend. She was in love for the first tirne. Chris felt the same way aooat her. They were inseparable. She had confided to me tltat nobody had ever sent her anything on Valentine's day (with the exception of me, because I sent all my friends carnations). She was really excited for it Why is Valentine's Day the only day a guy can be tr.uly romantic? Anyway. Valentine's day came and the school day was almost over. We were both sitting in last period Englisb when the fire alarm went off. As we walked outside I tumed around to look back at tile building and that is whe11 I saw it. A huge banner that said \WINTERGREEN.\ That's all it said, that's all it had to say. Wintergreen was their word for everything. It summed up the!£ entire relationship. My best friend was so excited I thought she was going to hug the wbole school. Chris got suspended for a month because il.e had pulled the fire alarm. It was a moment that they will never forget. When I think about it now, how stupid were we to judge people we did not even know. Besides, .if guys put up banners everyday it wouldn't be exciting and romantic. And so ended Valentine's day. 20)Why is it that when we play our favorite song to a friend. they never seem to react the way we had hoped? 45)Why don't the doctors in \General Hospital\ ever see patien~? ·1=====----------------,r----------------------------------------~ 21 )Why is Brenda, on Beverly Hills 90210, such a bitch 22)Why did Batman hang out with Robin~ he didn't do anything 23)Why did the Howells have all that money and Ginger had all those clothes, if they were only going on a three hour tour.

O'Neil Associate Features Edit~r There are some people wh!o botlter me- then there are thos:e who really bother me. I rnell!ll ~. These people bother me to the extent that I want to jllst throw something heavy at them- say a brick. No, better make it a cinder block. Thes:e indi.viduals possess su.cib annoying qualities it makes 111e wonder if God was playin~ some cruel joke on the rest on the world by placing them on it. I look at them and think tc myself \Why?! Why?!\ Let me 1ry to make you understand by naming a few of ti:Jese individuals, and the qualitie5 they possess which bother me so. 1) Bob Sagett- Possibly the most annoying human bei11g on the planet. On the most utterly bored and brain de;ad occasions that I have watch!Cd his show, \Full House,\ I fi11d myself becoming mo:te annoyed at his children: tile fifteen year-old who lools thirty, Goldilocks, and troll- baby, than I do with him. Then I watch \America's Funniest Home Videos,\ wh~1e he plays himself- annoyin~ man. Doesn't he understaml that he's just not funnY''r Loser, loser, loser. He makes: me want to spit at the television. 2) Alex Trebek- While I love \Jeopardy I detest Alex. WhOt does this guy think he is? The: Encyclopedia Brittanica? Come on Alex, you do11't know the answers any more than the contestants do- y()u just nave the card in front of you! You are not smart! I also hate the way he corrects the contestant's pronunciati()n of words in foreign languages. Alex. you are a game show host, not a translator at tile United Nations1 Yotu colleagues are Wink Martendale, Bob Barker, Bob Ubanks, and Pat Sajak. Look at yourself Alex- then try to tell me how smart you are. 3) Vanna White- While we're on the topic of game shows, who could resist taking a jab at V~na White? What good is she? What purpose does she serve? What right does she have to write a book about her life? Who cares about your life Vanna? You are a letter turner in ugly dresses. All you can say is \Hiiiiiieeeee! ,\ and \Byiiiieee! \. I hate you! 4) The rabbit in the Ken Goewy Dodge commercials- Once again, all I can say is \Why?! l\. I realize that the subject of Ken Goewy's annoying commercials has already been touched upon, but the rabbit has n.ever been mentioned. What, may I ask, does a full grown person in a rabbit suit have to do with the buying and selling of cars? Did some costume warehouse have a clearance sale on rabbit suits? Did Ken say to himself, \Hey I bet more people will want to buy cars from me if I have my buddy Sid dress up like a rabbit and run around during. my commercials!\. Ken, I want you to know that you and your rabbit are the last animals I would ever buy a car from. You are idiots! 5) Damon Keller- You may have noticed that Damon has not been mentioned in any of my articles this term. This is because I haven't thought him worthy of being mentioned until now. I couldn't help but notice that mere days after Dylan McKay was spotted wearing· an AMOCO gas station shirt on \Beverly Hills 90210,\ Damon was wearing an AMOCO jacket around campus. I never pegged Damon as a Bev Hills wanna- .be, but people change I guess. Damon, be a leader- not a follower. 6) Andrea Zuckerman- I see I'm falling into some sort of pattern here. We're always hearing about what bitches Brenda and Kelly are, well what about Andrea? She's definitely not a bitch, in fact, she's just the opposite. Andrea is a tool. First of all her name- she hates the pretentiousness of Bever! y HiHs, but yet she insists her name must be pronounced \Ahhndrea not just Andrea. Come on! Why is it that when something absolutely moronic has to happen to one of the characters on 90210, it always happens to Andrea? Andrea drools over Brandon, Andrea gets hit by a car and breaks both legs, Andrea is the dorky camp counselor, Andrea is thirty-five and plays the part of a seventeen year old. I know she's the most intelligent character on the show, but that doesn't mean she isn't a tool. There's no reason why Donna should always be the victim of harsh criticism. 7) The lady who wouldn't use Dawn because it wasn't lemon-scented- Listen lady, get your priorities straight. Everyone knows Dawn cuts grease like no other dish washing detergent Should you compromise clean dishes just because you're \a lemon nut\? I know that I wouldn't eat over at your house. You're going to have to realize that the real world is not lemon-scented, and get tough. I think you get my point. I hope you don't feel that I'm too violent, bot it's not like I'd really throw heavy objects at these people. I just fantasize about it.

Some think it's the beSt day of thl(l year ;because they receive sen much love and affectio11. Others love it because they can give so much love and affection. However, behind all this love and happiness there are a few people who simply wish this holiday never existed. Have you ever sat down and actually thought what tbis holiday i$ all about? Believe it or not it isn't simply abo11t giving flowers, cards and chocolate to one's love! There are a couple of beliefs about this holiday. One of them is that February 14th signifies the date on which the feasts of two martyrs were celebrated. Both marty1·s, according to myth were named Valentine. ·combined, the two were called Saint Valentine. One was from Rome and the other was the Bishop of Terni. They were both beheaded (how romantic!). Another belief is that there was only one Christian martyr named Saint Valentine. He was executed on February 14th. Before his death, he sent a farewell letter to his blind daughter and signed it, \from your Valentine.\ So. here's a connection with why we send \Valentines.\ Before the mailman; maidens put \messages of love\ in a large urn. Every single man picked a message. Each man would then court the lady whose message he picked. Imagine that occurring now? I'm sure you are wondering as I did when I read about the history, what the connection was between these deaths and the tradition of showing people love and compassion. One theory is that birds began to mate on tllat date! Sounds very strange doesn't it? After reading the small chunk of history about the holiday, I realized that there really isn't anything to be depressed about if you do not have a \Valentine.\ So maybe your roommate received a dozen roses from her boyfriend, or your best friend needs advice on what to get his girlfriend for Valentine's Day. Don't feel bummed! The whole idea of the day, who knows why, is to show your love to someone. Saint Valentine simply showed his love to his daughter so why not show your love to your parents, your brother, your sister, or even your best friend? I'll admit it, I strongly dread the holiday every year. Two years ago I bad a boyfriend on Valentine's Day and I thought that itwas the best thing. It ended up, believe it or not, not being as great as it seemed. Maybe it was because I did not like him too mud1 at the time, but why should o11e day make someone show U1eir love to you anymore thall they usually do? Instead of deciding to get depressed on Valentines day. Be Happy! 'It is n()t as bad as it seems. It's a great excuse to get someone a cud. You can find a card for anyone! Some of them are really- funny. It is also a good way to show someone that y()tJ care about them, and you don't have to feel embarrassed because everyone else is d()ing it! You can make pretty cards and put them in yo11r friends mailboxes. (get creative!). There is so mud1 candy and chocolate in the stores. even • CVS, so go out a11d buy some for you and yotu friends! It's . the perfect reason to call your · family to tell them how much you miss them (even if you really don't!). Last , but not late at nigh~ ~y a constant banging S()LJ.fld.

Running for the head position are sophomores David Levine and Doug Bartell. But the real future of the paper does n()t rest on their shoulders. Rather, it is the responsibility ()f the student body as a whole. This is the students' newspaper and without their support it would not exist. However, the situation at Concordiensis is a bit disturbing. Out of 54 legitimate staff members, 26 are seniors. After this term, almost one half of the newspaper's staff will be gone. This figure does not help our already struggling publication. There· have been many complaints thrust at the staff of this paper by certain members of the Union College community. However, instead of complaining, the paper and the school would be served better by active participation. Our doors at tile Concordy are always open to those who wish to join our staff. The Concordiensis has becorne a large commitment for those ir. volved. People seem to think that the paper magically appears in their hands every Thursday at 12:00. They do not seem to realize that for every page that is printed there are hours of work by writers, layout staffers, and editors. The Concordy is more than something the Union Community slwuld receive, it is a privilege for all that read it. However, this publication will noi get any better unless students come in to fill the soon to be vacated positions. For more information please contact our office. It wo11ld be encouraging to know that there are some people who would like to add to the paper that they read each week. Without each of us who contribute our time and effort, there would not be a paper. If you think that you can add something to the institution that helps to keep this campus informed, then come and prove it.

OPlf\TIONS SILENCE EQUALS DEATH by Amy Cypres Opinions Columnist Last Friday something happened. It was disturbing. scary and dark. It is my hope tllat by bringing it once again into the light, we can address tllis issue and confront the shadows. It's not an easy thing. I realize that some would say to let it go, but those who believe that, only propogate tile silence. ·I, for one, cannot. Silence equals death. I went to. class last Friday i11tending to discuss a provocative reading we had been assigned. It raised a bunch of difficult questions about ·film, about women. about the passive female voice. The piece itself was difficult to 11nderstand, it was wordy and at times overwhelming. So we digressed a bit from the essay and focused instead on the 110derlying and deeper issues. We spoke of patriarchy, we spoke of childhood and innocence, we spoke louder and louder. The discussion soon degenerated into a confrontation between myself and a male. student. Both of us were adamant and passionate about our views. The debate (and yes, it was a debate) grew fierce. Voices were raised. From there, the lynch mob mentality set in. The essential debate got lost in a chorus of cheerleaders and dissenters (to be candid, mostly silent). He interrupted me. I interrupted him. And then it happened. A female student raised her hand and said \I think you should let--- (the male student) finish his point, stop interrupting him.\ (or something to this effect). I was stunned. Here it was in living color, the perfect example of the passive female voice; deferential. (If it wasn't so disturbing, I would've laughed, the irony was overwhelming.) What she was saying is that I wasn't playing fair, I wasn't following the rules. She wanted me to stop. It's OK for him to be challenging, aggressive and opinionated. It makes him manly. It makes me a feminist radical bitch. I should be angry. Women should be angry. It is our right to speak loudly and forcefully. She scares me maybe more than I scare her. The fact tl1at IC\JER 'N<>NP&R \f\l\.\0 ~\R~\ coN\f\l'\C.{;.\) 1\\t::\R K\P~ \~~\ RE6'JRD\\f>..\\ON \b .t--.. \.\ON\£:. CCO\<.l:\) N\t:.f!...L '( women d<Jil 't support one another (see tlle myriad of articles in whiclt Mirriam and I address t:his issue)~ is inexcusable , to betray one another is unforgiveable. To have a woman ~nforce the patriarchal hienrcby of society is devasting;;. To essentially c<Jnqone this offensive framework by employing a silent majority. is horrifying. To have a woman perpetuate the myth is absurd. To deny a.n existi)).g ideology is ignorant. She tol<i :me ·I wasn't following the rules. Rules designed fol' atd by men. I won't, I cail:t. My voice will not be dro'Wned out by the cacophony of the crowd. It's funlly. For a few moments 1 thought of just giving up. I tllought of hiding in the bac.k,. biiTying my head in the sand. But that's exactly how wome11 become silenced. Fear and sl!ame .are the weapons of oeooice. Because if you are rnade to feel these emotions, then you will be quiet. Using your voice can be a scary thimg. It can also be empowerin:g. 1 will not go quietly.

<!Lonrllr » irnnin In Pain there is Knowledge To the Editor: Only four years ago I gingerly stepped onto to Old Union's grounds. My mind was yearning and searching, waiting to be filled. I was here :to learn, to gain knowledge and :to become an intellectual. Recently the administration reminded me tbat they were not here to fulfill this sort of inquiry. Theiractions strike to the core of knowledge, they slam the doors of leaming and they make no qualms about it. Recently one of the deep wells of knowledge. was drained, Prof. Genest was not re-hired. The school did not extend an offer to him to continue teaching Ancient a.nd Hellenistic philosophy. This pains me. But in pain their is always some knowledge to be gained. I have learned that we should not take it for granted that academic institutions want to teach. Rather our administration wants tough grades, football fields, new buildings, and less professors. Dean Underwood has recently made it his mission to espouse the importance of tougher grades and homework time. He is trapped within his own quantitative paradigm. Grades do not equal knowledge. Homework hours simply do not equate with the amount we learn. I have gained a vast amount of knowledge by engaging in intellectual discourse with my ph.ilosophy Professors outside of class. Should I count these intellectually fulfilling hours as homework time? How should I grade myself on this work? When students and faculty members asked President Hull how he could justify not creating a tenure track line in Ancient philosophy he replied by saying that another professor could teach Ancient philosophy. But President Hull, would someone needing brain surgery hire the services of a proctologist? The proctologist is just as skilled as the brain surgeon but he simply doesn't know the brain surgery. I believe the analogy extends to professors as well. As a scholar I want to be taught Anci~nt philosophy by a philosopher who reads Greek and is expert in tbe field. I don't want a historian. an ethicist or a poet to teach me the details of something they know relatively little about Prof. Genesfs subject matter is vital to the curriculum of Union college. His lectures are stimulating Wid necessary as a base from whence to begin the study of philosophy and tJ1e western world. By removing him from our school you remove another source of knowledge. You weaken the Gen Ed. program the school is so proud of and you weaken the philosophy program I am so proud of. Next year you may want to think abo\lt where knowledge comes from. It is not entirely tangible. It doesn't come from buildings and doesn't come from grades. It certainly doesn't come from a speech at opening ceremonies about diseipline and alcohol policies. H comes from our Professors and it comes from our desires. Luckily you will never stamp out my desire, no matter how hard you try. I was lucky enough to have Professor Genest and so my desire for knowledge has only grown stronger. Although I know his departure will close off a path of learning, I hope it doesn't take with it the motivation and desire of the students he has inspired. I can offer you no guarantee. Sincerely, Dan Milsky '93 Sorority Theft Highlights Security Problems To the Editor: It is with great disappointment that I am writing about the recent vandalism and theft that occurred at Hiclcock House late Friday evening. Many windows were tampered with in attempt to gain entrance into our house as well as personal property damaged once inside. Aside from apparent damage of throwing the lounge television to the ground, all of the items broken and stolen had \Gamma Phi Beta\ written or engraved on them. Among the items stolen are a Scholarship A ward silver bowl, Newsletter Award plaque, two composite pictures, two engraved sister paddles, and a crest flag which are all irreplaceable, not to mention numerous trophies smashed to pieces in the lounge. It is disturbing to have lost items related to the history of the sorority and to feel threatened living in the dorm at night. I would appreciate any information pertaining to the retrieval of these objects, and your confidentiality will be respected. Sincerely. Bethan H. Evans Gamma Phi Beta Presidellt Why Not A Term Abroad · ch· ? ID IDa. To the Editor: To students considering a tenn abroad; Wby not China? I hope this qu~ti.on is one that many of you are considering, as the time approaches to choose a term abroad for 1993/94. As the faculty advisor for the Union group that went to Nanjing Normal University last fall, I saw what an incredible experience this term was for 11 Union students. China is currently undergoing dramatic economic change, and the chance to see this from the i!lsicle is a rare and e.xciting opportunity. Moreover, the Chinese are welcoming westerners with enthusiasm, especially Americans. · Nanjing' Normal University LETTERS deeply values its contacts with Union. The administration and faculty at the university provided us with first-rate educational and cultural opportunities, including three days in China's beautiful Yellow Mountains and a week in Beijing. As many af you know. we did have a serious incident in China this fall, involving three of our students who were attacked in a restaurant. None of our students were badly hurt, although at :least two of the attackers were injured enough to require hospitalization. The incident was a freak occurrence, and we have made suggestions to the Terms Abroad office that should significantly lessen the already small probability of something tHe it ever happening again. From our perspective, your chances of being assaulted are probably smaller in Cllina than in any other place y<lu are likely to be next fall (including Schenectady). The faculty advisor for next fall is Prof. Marty Benjamin of the Arts Department, and that's another good reason to go. Marty is a renowned photographer, who is looking forward to helping students get some great pictures. So, you'll return· from Cllina after a life- altering experience with some outasight photographs to back it up! Go for it! Prof. T.C. Werner Chemistry Department Chet's: Your .Key to Emotional Freedom To the Editor: Last term I helped to co- write a scathittg letter to this newspaper about the deteriorating standards that seem to prevail at the Concordy. I received lots of negative attention because those persons who dedicated time to the paJ)er felt that I had no basis for complaint if I was not writing for it. It has become time to earn my critical license, albeit post facto. I promise to the audience that there will be no silly poems, esoteric mindless conversations, or mention of vibrators in this column (Sorry, I menti<Jned the word. It's the last time. I swear.). What I do want to deal with is the topic of developmental growth and how it can be achieved at Chet's. Perhaps you've seen a poster that adorns the hallowed residence halls at Union that has those trendy black and white photos of academic buildings at other, better architect schools around the nation that begins with a definition of a donn? 'I.hat part of the poster. is harmless, but what lies under it is powerful stuff. Within the innocuous title of \Developmental Growth Durin~ the College Years\ lies a f<lurteen point list of how to get a life. Everyone knows that a list is useless without a contex.t; I'm giving this list a visit to our beautiful and centrally l<Jcated campus February 11, 1993 page 9 bar, Chet's. Item number one: Choosing a life's work. When one arrives at Chet's the ultimate job is immediately revealed to him or her: Union College's bouncer. Think of the power and job satisfaction of being able to establish the real-age of any Union student at the flip of a ,page! This is the only bar in the world with this kind of fail safe device, something that other drinkeries can only dream of. Number two: Fomuition of a personal value system. Chet's makes this very simple. If you get by the guard, you are faced with one option: unbridled selfishness. This is because Chet'-s sets a new :precedent for bars; the customer can only buy one drink at a time. Goal three: Developing autonomy. This is easy at Chet's because you can be certain that you will be entirely alone in the bar. Your friends went to Rupsis's. They don't want to achieve developmental growth. This circumstances gives you a chance to grapple with the nest topic, Managing emotions. Here is your opportunity to really sift through feelings of inadequacy and reclusiveness in your splendid solitude at Chet's. Now it is time to come face to face with developing Freeing interpersonal relationships. Let's be optimistic for a moment. By some miracle the girl or guy you've wanted to meet all year wanders into Chet's. You meet, talk a little, and decide to leave and go to Rupsis's (where everyone else is). You have Freed yourself, you are ·on the way to establishing an \interpersonal relationship\. By the way, does this have to do with interoffice mail? How did intercourse get into this? No matter, because it's time to Establish an identity. Back to reality, and you're still alone in the pub. If nothing else. you have become identified with those who drink at Chet's. I'm not sure if this is really the indentity you want, but hey, it's better than nothing. Since nobody is at Chet's it is essential that you bring a book. This is where you can Achieve academic competence. Some may wisely say that studying with a beer isn't really studying, but let's face it: Academic competence is a D. By this point things are probably looking bleak. and it's time to work on Establishing interdependent relationships. Since nobody is in [be bar, your faced with a challenge, but as a Union student you can overcome! This is the moment to develop an interdependent relationship with any alcohol of your choice. If you do this long enough at Chet's and get obnoxious, than it becomes time to Resolve your parent- child relationship. a phone call ·from jail can really bring this to force, particularly for bail money on a drunk and disorderly charge. While in jail,· there is a strong likelihood that you may be forced to Solidify a sexual preference, Depending on your decision, item eleven, developing a caJ>acity for true intimacy, can become an interesting decision. additionally, number twelve, Planning a future lifesty,!.e, can also be decided here ·in jail. By now your night iin a Schenectady jail is over and you have joined the r3llks of those known as ex-convicts. This is where the tllifteen th piece of the list comes in: Achieving social competence. Did you really pay your debt to society? Are you sure? Oprah may have an opening ... Finally the last topic' lies before you: DeveJ()ping integrity. Chet's cm:·ding stipu1ations enforce a ty:pe of honesty, but lets face it, you're at Union College. IntegFity is impossible. That's the list. I guess I lied about applying these ideas at Chet's because I did bring in the .penal system too. Please, if there is anyone out there who can actually say they have accomplished the Developmental Growth Dn.~ring the College Years. write to me. If I die having done three of these things it w iJ:~ be miraculous. I hope I'm noil a1one. Janies Rawstron Delta Phi Sponsors Blood Drive To the Editor: On January 28th, tile Delta Phi fraternity, in association with the American Red Ctoss, sponsored its first blood drive. In the week preceding the 28th, brothers spent their free time recruiting students and faculty in the college center. Spread out over a few days~ the process of signing people up became an art, not a challenge. Greg Leidner claimed that '\not only did [we] help a good cause, but some of us also met some pretty ladies as a result.\ Finally the day of the drive had arrived. Begin11ing at noon, blood donors filed into the Old Chapel and proceeded to donate a total of fifty-five quarts of blood, no small achievement by any means. The best part was that there was not one unhappy face in the room; those who were a little nervous or apprehensive were made to feel at home by suave escorts such as Mr. Ty Velde and Mr. Pete Elkan. By closing time, a grand total of sixty-one donors had passed through the doors of the Old Chapel and had donated a part of. themselves that could quite possibly save anotf:!er's life. Everyone was pleased. In an event like this, there w-ere no losers - donors felt great about themselves (at least after some cookies and juice they did), Delta Phi and the Red Cross had done their job whole-heartedly, and most importantly, many needy recipients would soon have another chance to get on with their lives. Commenting on the overall success of tl1e Delta Phi Blood Drive, O'Brien said, \Hopefully this can become an annual tradition at our house. I never thought helping otl1ers could be such an enjoyable and satisfying experience.\ Contributed by, Nish Nadaraja t l ' I

If, then, you could comprehend how said idiot would annoy said Gunny so much that they'd start yelling at each other in the middle of the jungle with hostile forces searching for them in the immediate vicinity- you'd be all set Tom Berenger (Platoon) and Billy Zane (Dead Calm) star in Sniper. As the title suggests, there was a serious division of talent in this movie. Berenger is in classic form as the cold- hearted Gunny Sergeant, the top Marine sniper- with 74 kills under his belt. Billy Zane is the civilian shooter sent by the National Security Agency to assist Berenger on his most dangerous mission y.et. \eliminating\ a security tlueat in the form of a General Alvarez, a Colombian puppet set to win the Panamanian elections. Surprisingly, though, this movie does have its strong points. There is a particularly appalling scene where a former CIA operative who now works for the cocaine cartels tortures one of our boys in green. Ooooh. I was highly ticked. Traitor scenes really hit the spot with ·most red-blooded Americans. and this one is no exception. First of all, on a strictly theoretical level, if you can get past the ridiculous story that the NSA would send someone \out of the link\ on a mission which circumvents Congress and every other notable jurisdictional body in our government, if that person would be a civilian, and if that civilian was a blatant idiot, than this plot would work for you. If you could further understand how the afore- mentioned idiot would also be an arrogant jerk, and provoke a fire-breathing Gunny for no reason whatsoever, you'd be Berenger rules the day. His responses are well timed and deep. He carries the fdm .. You can only make so many excuses for Zane. I kept saying \he's supposed to be playing an idiot\ so you!d think he'd be able to pull it off. Unfortunately, this is a guy who can play a psycho and that's about it. I was embarrassed for the guy. There is a definite juxtaposition in the works here: Berenger is the pillar, Zane is the pea. Three cheers for Tom Berenger. Three strikes for Billy Zane.

Last Sunday. two of our new friends asked my roommate and I to join them for brunch at West Memories immediately came to mind. Those meals at West that lasted for etemHy, those confessions of 'the night before', and all those embarrassing encounters with the people you had hoped you would never see again, after the incident you pulled the night before. Meal cards came to mind, and ail those times that I stood on my knees. begging to be allowed to come in without my meal card, whipping my birth certificate in attempts to convince Marge of my freshman status. That red punch that all to well reminded me of the punch I had drunken the night before, and the Top 40, always being played on the stereo. (By the way, those long distance dedications, I will never understand. These people dedicate songs to family members and loved one's who have been, for example. lost in the wilderness for ten years. Now, dear, why would that person be listening to the.Top 40, anyway. They're lost in the wilderness!) \Whatever\ (Cheerily) So, there I was, preparing myself. for a brunch at West. Preparing for the pandemonium, the long lines, and the tbree million choices of what to eat (by the way. they get Breugger's Bagels, \so that's where cur increase in tuition has gone!\). I took a deep hreath, messed up my hair, made sure I was wearing what I had worn the night before, sprayed a little \Keg Beer\ perfume, and I was off. I didn~t just barge in. not like I had my Freshman year, in need of some serious substance to absorb the toxins in my blood; I was a mature Senior now (rightt) So, I slowly (ladylike) opened the door, and guess w:ho I saw ..• TISH! \Jennifer Unterber.g, where have you been?\ I ran over and gave her a huge hug.! When I let go, I realized that Tish is probably the most underrated person at Union College. Althougb her job seems to consist of merely punching holes in Freshman's meal card, and reguLating who comes in to eat, it goes much deeper than that. Tish is not only the \eyes and ears\ of Union College, she is the .memory book (a scrapbook full of pictures and moments from all of our Freshman year), and she is the heart. It is Tish who we first see every morning, and on weekends. She knows everyone's name and everything about them. She asks us how we feel and knows our Birthdays. She bad wanted to fix my hair for my formal and always told me when she would grab my hand. \Your hands are cold,. you need someone to warm them up.\ She is a· match mak:er and an advisor. She'll telL you the truth before anyone ;else will, and she'll slap yo11 int<> shape if you are staggerin~. The love for her is seen by each person who walks into West. Although they would deny it, I am convinced that the Heckey players kee:p their meal plan in order to keep that table beside her reserved. Throughout brunch, She re)irimanded people, while evet so slyly, winking at me in j~st, and said \Hi\ to every person who entered \I have had more fun with this Freshman Class, I tell you, they keep me laughing,\ Tish exclaimed. If you ever need oome advice, some honesty, some humor, and. some food, West Dining Hall is the place to go. It is filled with memories and classic moments. It should never go unnoticed, how wonderful, Tish is .. Sure, she won't .let you in wilhout a meal card, but she'll ruways let you into her heart. Thank you, Tish, I'll see you next Sunday.

Daniel Kaffee, a lazy military 'lawyer who is assigned to defend two young Marines up on charges for murder of another Marine in a huing incident at Guan- tanamo Naval 'Base in Cuba. Kaffee isn't really i11to this tight, and the audience is led to believe that he is this way because he feels he can never really live up to his illustrious dead father's reputaticn. However, his immediate s11perior~ Lt. Cmdr. Galloway (Demi Moore), won't let him wiggle of:f the hookthat easily, and the two are soon )lOring over their legal strategy in an effort to have the two Marines found innocent of the charges. Jack Nicholson is Col. Nathan Jessep, the commander of the base, who is so nasty and such a .. good ole ooy,\ you have to hate him. A superb actor, he doesn't dis- appoint. Should you take thls movie in? Absolutely! It shou1d shape up interestingly come Oscar time. SCENT OF A WOMAN - Al Pacino is LL Col. Frank Slade, a self-indulge11t blind man who is detennined to squander tli.e last of his money on a VJild weekend in New York. With this in mind, he hires a young student, Charlie Simms (Chris O'D<lollell), to sflepherd him around. In the process, he treats Charlie like dirt. Charlie, in turn, has more than just Slade to deal with. He faces some tough d.ecisions at school, the result of whicil could cost him either his scholarship or his friends. Despite a weak script, Pacino shines. In fact, be recently won the Golden Globe award for Best Actor for this movie. Since the Golden Globes are a precursor to the il- lustrious Oscars, you can be sure Pacino will be an odds-oa favorite to win the coveted golden statuette.

Ryan Alaspa has also performed well this ·season. Ryan leads all rookies in poi.Jlts with 11 ( 4 goals, 7 assists). Many of the other rookies have shown promise for the future, particularly Brad Kukko, whose aggressive hard-nosed play has gotten h:im 8 .points this season. Several Union skaters seem to have made big improvements since last season and hope to keep improving. Corey Holbrough has been excellemt, especially on a line with Brad Kukko. While last year, Corey's hustle and agressiveness were landing him in the penalty box, this year he is getting the puck in the net.

When the score reached 159-43, Union swam the rest of the ~eet unofficially. Their final seven points came from. the . diving of Dave Rob~son and Matt Baumgartner. l'here were some definite notableS .. though. Union started .the meet by ' getting first. second, and third in~ medley relay, using three strong relays. Union took ·first, second. and third in the freestyle relay as well. On top of that, the men took first place in every event except one. Every single person who swam scored points for the team. So here's the list of those who scored: Matt Baumgartner, Scott Bowden, · James Ernst, John Fitzgerald, Adam Horst, Bill Humphreys .. Robbie Johnson, Tsuyoshi \Kobi\ Kobayashi, Martin Logan. David Lunianski, Luke Payne, Drew Pirie h.· Ckip Quarrier, Chris Riley, Dave Robison, Dave Saad, Joe Saltzbart, Lee Schachter, ·Bri{.Ul Scholl, Seth Sealfon, Cliff Shaw, Geoff Wolfe~ Matt Woodrow, Chris Yousey, and against Brown this weekend is worthy of noting. Battiston's perseverance led to two important Union goals against Brown, and Steve picked up 2 assists to give him 3 points for the season. Looking ahead to next season, we must hope that Coach Delventhal can bri11g in the scorers to go with the solid defensive mold Union has shaped. The Dutchmen ,can count on Alaspa,Albert and Simonton to put the puck in the net, but a few more pure scorers would solidify this team into a serious playoff contender. Another hope for the team is that there will be more fan participation in the action next season. I can only imagine how it must feel for the Union players to hear only a quiet murmur from the crowd. which balf the time is drowned out by the Cornell visiting fans, or the RPI and Brown bands. For those who have not yet realized it, Union is now involved in the level of hockey one step below the NHL. Two years ago JO<? Juneau played. for RPI. This season he bas 2J goals and 44 Sven Zabka. In the swim of the meet, Scott Bowden got the school record for the 100 yard individual medley in a time of 56.28 seconds. It was an exceptional performance by all. The women won their meet against Albany by the score of 168-72, and they swam a few events exhibition as well. At one point t)ley. were up by ·the score of 153-3S. Just as in the men''s meet. everyone who swam scored points. The list includes: Jenn Allaire, Jen Baldwin, Julie Benker, Kelly Bevan, Kristy Campbell, Jen Davidson, Julie Davis, Eri Hayashi, Kristy Holbrook, Julie Ivanyi, Liz Kussy, Amy Lamphere, Liz McLaughlin, Jonatha Meade, Karen Peppiatt, Anne Rozwadowski, Erica Saltz, Jenn Terrell, and Natasha Zabka. The women took first in every event of the meet. The highlights of the women's meet were the medley and freestyle relays swum by Julie Benker, Kelly_ Bevan, Jenn Allaire, and Jonatha Meade. Both relays qualified for thf; B cut of the NCAA championship meet. This means· that they will be considered for the NCAA meet, and have a very good chance at going. It was a great meet for the Union women. · · With the re~ular sea5on behind them, the!Dutchmen are now looking forward to their respective state championship meets with great anticipation. Everyone's getting psyched up: the women's state meet is the weekend of February 18th at Hamilton, and the men's meet is the following weekend at Rochester. So if you see a swimmer around campus (you can usually tell by the jacket), wish them luck at states. assists for the Boston Bruins,' making him their second leading scorer. Harvard's Ted Drury was a star on the 1992 US Olympic team. And soon, Union fans will be watching that caliber of player. Last year, a scout from the San Jose Sharks came to Union to look at Luigi Villa. This season, a scout from the expansion Ottowa Senators was at Achilles Rink to take a peak at some RPI players, but also Reid Simonton. It would not be a major suprise if Simonton is drafted by an NHL team 'before his ·career at Union is over. Though tbe team's record is disappointing and there are many offensive holes to fill, by the time the current freshman are seniors, Union will begin to be a power in the ECAC and we will start to be able to recruit the players with potential to play in the NEll... Good luck to the team the rest of the way. and hopefully the Union community will all come out to Achilles Rink for the final home games on February 26th and 27th against Colgate aDd Cornell. ~ l I :1 ''·

Men's Track Competes at Williams By Marc Sheridan Co11tributing Writer This past weekend the men's track and field team travelled to Williams College for its annual invitatiornal. The meet brought athletes primarily from the Massachusetts area, with Union being one of the few out of state teams competing. Although a seemingly yo11ng men's team, the Union runners performed remarkably, placing fifth out nine teams with an overall total of thirty-two points. The day began with the 880 yd relay consisting of freshmen, Jon Simon, Mike Leding, Russ Stram. and sophomore Marc Sheridan. Union ·placed second out of four teams with a time of 1:40.2. Only thirty minutes after tile relay. Simon ran 6.90 seconds in the 55m dash, yet did not make it to the fin3lls. The men's 1500m run featured three of our freshmen distance runners putting out some impressive times: John Metz (4:32), Mitch Weisenberg (4:36}, and Adam Russell (4:46). The next event was the 400m open, with sprinters Jon Simon (53.8 sec.) pla.:i.ng third and Mike Leding (54.09 sec.) coming in fifth. In the field events, juniiQr, Rich Pulver launched the shot 14.09rn to place fo11rth overall, while freshman J. A. Minehardt placed fifth in the triple jump, with 38.1 ft. Back on the track, the mem's lOOOm featw-ed Marc Shericlan (2:59.0) and Jon Metz (3:003) placing sixth and sevemth respectively. Next came the 200m resulting in Sirn.on (24.24 sec.) in sixth place a.nd Leding (24.8 sec.) capturing seventh. Freshmen Seth Rudin (9:47) and Adam Russell (10:25) ran the 3000m run, an challenging task for any competitor. The 160Bm relay brought out the Union 880 yd relay team, who plat:ed fourth with a time of 3:50.~. The ·meet ended with the Distance Medley Rela::Y. featuring Rudin, Russdl, Weisenberg, and Met:z. running an overall total of 12:12.8 against a host of veteran mllllers. Next week, the Un.i<Jn track and field team races at the Colgate Invitational again:st some of the top teams in Ne'W York State. SPORTS Union 3-some Strong At Williams By Nadine Filosi Concordiensis Staff This past weekend at Williams College the women's threesome ran very well against fierce competition. Competing against eleven teams, the three women placed ninth overall, with 100'% scoring rate. Sophomore co- captain Liza Morse had by f!lr, the best performance of the day of Union's women. She improved her time in the 1000 meters by si.x seconds with a time of 3:28.99 to captui\e fourth place for the women. Senior Christina Monfasani ran the 55 meter dash in a tirne of 8.6 seconds.

WRITE FOR SPORTS CALL HAL (X4319) OR RICH (X4314) HOCKEY continued from page 20 has not only been scoring but bas also played a much more physical game, as we witnessed against Brown where he punished several Brown skaters wi!Ih tremendous checks. Ryan Alaspa has also performed well this season. Ryan leads all rookies in p<>ints with 11 (4 goals, 7 assists). Many of the other rookies have shown promise for the future, particularly Brad Kukko, whose aggressive hard-nosed play has gotten him 8 poi11ts this season. Several Union skaters seem to have made big improvements since last c.;eason and hope to keep improving. Corey Holbrough has been excellent, especially on a line with Brad Kukk:o. While last year. Corey's hustle and agressiveness were landing him in the penalty box, this year he is getting tile puck in the net. Corey has 2 goals and 6 assists. including a perfect strike to set . .JJP Bta:d Kukko•s second ~al in Union's victory over Princeton. Finally, Steve Battiston • s gritty performance Swimming and Diving Have Eyes On Championships by Lee Scbacbter Concordiensis Staff Tbis past week, Union's swimming and diving team finished a very successful dual meet season with both the men's and women's teams getting decisive victories against Albany. The · women finished 7-1 and the· men fini~hed 5-3, and both teams are looking to do very well at their respective state championship meets. The final score of the men's meet against Albany was 166-95. That score does not reflect the full severity of the blowout, however.

:1 ·' I . I !· '! .I l I I ! illDJtrsrbirusis SPORTS High Player Benefits are Fans' Misfortunes By Greg Kalish Concordiensis SttJfj .._, i like to consider myseH a true N(~w York sports fan. I only root for teams who play in New York, or once played in New York (i.e. the Giants). In my estimation, there is no more exciting place to watch a game than Madison Square Garden, no better place to watch a baseball game on a beautiful summer day than Shea Stadium, and no better football atmasphere in the entire world than the one that exists in Giants Stadium. Recently, however, access to these world-c'lass establishments has been limited to the commom folk as a result of tremendous ticket prices as well as other ludicrous expenditures. So you want to see a Knick or Ranger game at Madison Square Garden. You don't need the best seats in the house but you want to see the game. So you<figure you U go for the medium price range. Well, don't plan on spending any less than $25 per ticket if you want to see the action. If you order your tickets by phone, you can throw in another five dollar service charge per ticket as well as a one dollar shipping and handling fee. Of course, you could always buy the cheap 1 s~at at the GaTden and move down to tbe better seats, but then you lla.ve to slleU out the dough to tile usher who is in charge of tln:owing vagrants like you out of seats you don't belong in. Either w~y, you're looking at anyw.hete between $55 .and $60 dollars for tickets alone. So. how are yo11 going to get there. Let's say you want to drive. Well after you pay the five do-llars to g:et you in and out of the city (applies to Long bland only), you're looking at anywhere from $15 to $25 dollars for parking. Too much.? You can always take the train for $8 to $10 dollars, but that means a much. 'longer trip~ So you figure :tflat since you're going aU out for the nigb.t anyway, you'll drive. Okay, so yotl\:r.e now inside the cozy comforts of ••rhe Oarden,. and you're feeling rather hungry. So you go to the concession stand to pick up a light dinaer. You figure two hot dogs, a pretzel, and a soda will be a satisfying meal. That will set reu back another $11.50. And souvenirs? Forget it! No Shirt is sold for less th~n $18 dollars, eve11 the yearbook is up to $7 doUars. So if you're a parent taking your son or daughter to see a game, you're not going to spend less than $100 for tickets, transportation and food. What a rip off! As unfail: as it may seem, this is the trend de'Veloping throughout professional· sports. It has come about as a result of seven. and eight digit contracts. When the owners have to pay more, so do you. How many other Met fans are paying for Bobby Bonilla's lucrative contract. An you Red Sox fans, thanks for picking up the tab on Roger's contract. And as for the Yankees, forget it!- With free agents signees such as Jimmy Key, Wade Boggs, and last year's acqyisition Danny Tartabull, ticket prices have risen again. Where will it end? ' The only solution is to rid pro sports of the grotesque contracts ~hat owners seem to be handing out like candy. A sport like baseball is no longer a game but a business. I want to see a Met game with0ut having to pay $14 for a seat with an .obstructed view, or $3 for a .hot dog that after being purchased will exist in this world for , less than two minutes. I don't want to pay $5.50 to park my car four and a half miles away from the stadium entrance! The world of sports has become \'the art of cheating the consumer\ and the only way it will end is if the fan stops going to the games. Is t~s realistic? Probably not. But for now, my favorite seat in the house is the one on that lovely sofa with the remote control in one hand and lunch in the other. SUMO WRESTLINGcontinuoofromp~ge2o the season. In sumo, the high . officials of the Japan Sumo Association must approve every promotion in ranlc. They could hide behind such criteria as \mental attitude\' or \the Japanese way of thinking\ to deny .promotion. However, Ak.ebono's genuine performances and his sincere nature have enabled him to become the frrst non-Japanese ever to receive this coveted rank. Fellow American Konishiki holds the sec()nd highest rank, Ozeki. Some may have seen the article on Konishiki in Sports Illustrated which appeared just over a year ago. Yhis Hawaiian is the heaviest wrestler on the circuit by over 100 pounds. He weighs in at 261 kilograms or an unbelievable 574 pounds. He was quoted as saying, \it's a deceptive 575 because 50 pounds are always jiggling at one time\. He simply relies on the fac~ that no one can move him. His moves are limited and this may be one of the reasons wily this succe~ful 29 year old h.as not been promoted to Yokozuna. . Musashimaru is the third member of the American/Hawaiian triumvirate. He holds the third highest rank, Sekiwake, at tlle young age of 21. While he has enjoyed a successful start. his raw talent still needs seasoning. The Americans bave spiced up the sport with an international flavor, but it is the presence of several young Japanese upstarts which have been the major catalyst in Sumo's recent surge in popularity. This movement is led by a brother tandem named Takahanada and Wakahanada. Taka, as he is more affectionately known, has become the youngest wrestler · in history to achieve tile rank of Ozeki. At the age of 20, his boyish looks and mature manner have turned him into a national idol, People ill Japan revere him in the same way that everyone is a Michael Jordan fan or a Lawrence Taylor fan. If people could wear Takahanada jerseys they would own both the horne and away versions. The 21 year old W akahanada enjoys his own following, but he's not in the same lea~ue as Taka. While some sumo wrestlers still bear the raw ton11age of the •• American image\ they simply represent the old guard more than Reg Dunlop. The young guns prefer a slim, quick and muscular huild which caJls for actual ••moves .. rather· than sheer weight. There is one wrestler named Terao who is legitimately cut. Don't get me wrong, they still put on the pounds, but not so much in excess. Tony Man<hirich drew the oohs and aahs when SI printed his . weekly shopping list. I assure you that these wrestlers ~re put on an inc~;<ldible weight gaining diet, but one would probably see a paddy's equivalent of rice on their plate over a dish of pasta Primavera. Now I know you are saying \why doesn't some fat, out of work NFL Lineman seek work in Japan like so many other lost souls?\. Well. the world of Sumo is so set in tradition that it takes a lot more than a half-hearted effort to be accepted into the sport. First, one has to convert to Shintoism as the world of Sumo revolves around religious discipline. In addition, a year-round training schedule dominates every aspect of one's life. It is truly a sizable commitment that these atheletes are required to make. Maybe your views on Sumo have changed, maybe your interest has been sparked, or maybe you're just wondering whether or not its worth it to go up campus this weekend. In any event, I just wanted to give you a· taste of sporting life in the land of the rising sun. Many Japanese are slowly realizing that their national sport is being dominated by foreigners, namel our fellow Americans. Perhaps there is hope after all for the ••tazy\ (and fat) American.

You have all seen the commercials and 'you have all heard the hype. But how good is he really? Is he just good because he is on the Orlando Magic? Where does he stand in perspective? Well ... funny you should ask. I now present Shaq 101 with your professor ... Schach.(Did I happen to mention I had the nickname before he did? It's true ...

Robinson, Malone, Mutombo, and Coleman. -Shaq is even second in the league in field-goal percentage ... ahead of everybody except Brad Daugherty. -Last year Orlando had 21 total wins ... they have 21 already this year. All of this improvement with only one draft pick in the first two rounds ·Of last year .. .I wonder who that pick was!?!? -He is the first rookie to be named a starter in the All-Star game since Jordan. AU ,of this has been accomplished by a player hyped with the extremeness felt by hockey phenom Eric Lindros, who is yet to show signs of greatness. Basketball is a sport of supeiStars. More than any other sport hype makes the man. The more hyped one is, the harder the fall into mediocrity. So far Shaquille O'Neal has not felt this fall, and looking at his recent statistics things are only going to get better as Shaq continues his quest for NBA greatness.

Now I know you are saying .. why doesn't some fat, out of work NFL Lineman seek work in Japan like so many other lost souls?\. Well, the world of Sumo is so set in tradition that it takes a lot more than a half-hearted effort to be accepted into the sport. First, one has to convert to Shintoism as the world of Sumo revolves around religious discipline. In addition, a year-round training schedule dominates every aspect of one· s I if e. It is truly a sizable commitment that these atheletes are required to make. Maybe your views on Sumo have changed. maybe your interest has been sparked. or maybe you're just wondering whether or not its worth it to go up campus this weekend. In any event. I just wanted to give you a taste of sporting life in the land of the rising sun. Many Japanese are slowly realizing that their national sport is being dominated by foreigners, namel our fellow Americans. Perhaps there is hope after all for the \lazy\ (and fat) American.

He went right up to tile rim, slammed tile ball, held on to the rim for a split-second too long, and he brought down tl '! entire basket apparatus. He. of course, is Shaquille O'Nea.. He also is the biggest newcomer into the sports world since· Magic Johnson and Larry Bird stepped iBto the limelight in the early 1980's. Of course all of you know who Sha.q is. You have all seen the commercials and ·you have all heard the hype. But how good is he really? Is he just good because he is on the Orlando Magic? Where does he stand in perspective? Well ... funny you should ask. I now present Shaq 101 with your professor ... Schach.(Did I happen to mention I had the nickname before he did? It's true •. .I'm older than he is.) -On Sunday's NBA on NBC telecast Shaq helped the network to a 46% jump in the ratings. -Shaq leads the Magic in points per game, games played, field goals, field goal percentage, free throws, offensive rebounds, total rebounds, blocked shots, and points. -He is seventh in the NBA in scoring ... ahead of such notables as David Robinson. Pat Ewing, and Larry Johnson. -He is second in the NBA in rebounds ahead of Olajuwon, Barkley, Ewing, Robinson, Malone, Mutombo. and Coleman. -Shaq is even second in the league in field-goal percentage ... ahead of everybOOy except Brad Daugherty. -Last year Orlando had 21 total wins ... they have 21 already this year. All of this improvement with only one draft pick in the first two rounds of last year .. .I wonder who that pick was!?!? -He is the first rookie to be named a starter in the All-Star game since Jordan. All of this has been accomplished by a player hyped with the extremeness felt by hockey phenom Eric Lindros. who is yet to show signs of greatness. Basketball is a sp<>rt of superstars. More than any other sport hype makes the man. The more hyped one is, the harder the fall into mediocrity. So far Shaquille O'Neal has not felt this fall, and looking at his recent statistics things are only going to get better as Shaq continues his quest for NBA greatness.

Athletes featured in this secti~n are members of a Union College varsity sport who have pe~ormed well in the previous weeks competitions. This week's winner does not play for a Union tearn, b:Jt is a student who is an athlete on a world class level. Nikki Stone is a Freestyle Aeriafist who is now competing on the World Cup circuit. Nikki is presently ranked first in the United States in Freestyle Aerial Skiing, and is also rated fourth in the world. Nikki, is a junior from Westboro Massachusetts majoring in psychology. In only her second year of World Cup skiing. Nikki is considered one of the best Freestyle Aerialists in the World. During her rookie season she won first place at a World Cup competition in Japan. She also added a second place finish. which ~ontributed to her selection as Freestyle Rookie of the Year. This honor recognized Nikki as the premiere newcomer in all Freestyle categories. Entering the 1992-93 season Nikki was ranked ninth in the world, but after early season success has moved up to fourth. She has performed well at World Cup events in Lake Placid, Whistler, and most recently in Quebec, where she placed fifth. By Hal Poret Co Sport~ Editor After Union's disappointing 7-4 loss to Brown on Friday. the Skating Dutchmen now stand at 2-12, in last place in the ECAC. Though there is little to no remaining hope for a spot in the EC_AC playoffs, there are some bright . spots of the season to look back on, and some excellent promise for the future of Union Hockey in Division 1. So they aten•t scoring the goals, and they aren't getting the wins. This is only Union's second season in Division 1, and for those of you who are not too familiar with college hockey. this is a huge jump from the ECAC Division 3. Ask Coach Bruce Delventhal ·if we should be worried yet, and he'll tell you that building a successful hockey program is not something that will happen this quickly. It takes great patience. We did not get a # 1 draft pick for finishing in last place last year, and we aren't going to get one this year. But Delventhal has plans for the progral')l and they explain some of Union .. s performance this season. Delventhal is ' building this team \from the net out... This means that he is concentrating on solid defense and goaltending before emphasizing scoring. Two year's ago, Delventhal recruited top notcbgoaltenders Luigi Villa and Mike Gallant to secure the net. Both have exc.elled at times and faltered badly at others. but both are only sophomores and will definitely improve. Gallant bas stopped 86.8 percent of shets he ha:s faced but the offense has .fl()t performed for him. Gallant stopped 24 of 26 .shots against Colgate in a 2-1 loss, and stopped an incredible 38 of 41 shcts (a .927 save percentage) in a tough 3-2loss to Harvard. Villa has also shown signs ()f brilliance. stopping 87.5 percent of shots be has faced so far :this seasen. Luigi was phenomenal iri Union's 3-2 win over Vermont, putting aside 43 of 45 shots. Villa's best game was Union • s 3 -l victory over Princeton in whicb he stopped 35 of 36 shot:! (97 .2 %). Villa has stopped 90% or more shots in an impressive five games this season_ So despite their records .. the goaltending will be solid when the rest of the team improves. Probably the biggest highlight for the season has Americans Dominate Japanese Sumo BJ I' ..iu Strum Cor· .. ?uting Writer ---- What is the average American's image of Sumo wrestling? He probably tbinks of some extremely fat guys rolling around while pretending to be athletes. The obese freaks of Japan entertaining the minuscule masses. Fat guys running around- in G-strings. Freaks who get filthy rich, buy up some golf course in Florida, and then sit on a beach eating a hell of a lot of sushi. Well I'm sorry to ruin your images because Sumo involves none of the above (except for the G- strings and money). While sumo is rooted in tradition, there hav~ been several changes in its style as Japan moves into today's new .age. The emergence of some bright. young Japanese superstars and the presence of three skillful and dominant Americans has forced Sumo into the public eye causing each generation in Japan to become avid fans. Everyone debates on their favorite wrestler just as everyone debates on the best color M&M pr the best character on L.A. Law. The one man who has the entire country talking is Akebono. This Hawaiian native, Chad Rowan to his mother, has turned the nation upside- down by winning the last two bashos (tournaments) in formidable fashion. At the young age of 23, Akebono is by far the fastest rising foreign star. His large frame along with his wide range of moves enables him to attack in a variety of styles. Sumo requires intense concentration and Akebono has the essence of the ••game 'face\. He combines quickness and Akebono throwing Konishild .power and his string of Japanese baseball's legendary performances have earned him Sataharu Oh for the. most the highest rank in sumo.. homeruns in ()ne season. The Yokozuna. Japanese S()Ciety protected In the world of sumo, the their hero blatantly by rank of Yokozuna is regarded impending Hornet's progress. as a sacred honor awarded to a Opposing pitchers would precious few. Needless to say, intentionally walk him in any this honor- has never before situation while his own gone to a foreigner. Some manager went so far as to sit may remember American Bob him for the Jast two games of Horner•s bid to surpass · t · 19 coa. on page been the performance of rookie defenseman Reid Simonton. Simonton leads the Skating Ducthmen with 6 goals and is 3rd on· the team with 9 points. Reid has certainly made an excellent transition from the Alberta Junior League where he played for the Calgary Canucks, to Division 1. Simonton is a scoring threat and has shown explosive offensive ability as he did ill scoring Union's third goal against RPI on· an impressive rush in which he blew by two defenseman on the right, cut to the center and flipped the puck past RPI goalie Neil Little. Reid has also become an intimidating defensive presence, putting thunderous hits on oppposing skaters. Those wb·o watched the Union-arown game were treated with a display of crushing hits by Simonton and Chris Albert. Unfortunately,. 'Reid•s agressive play has landed him in the penalty box 25 times, but this number will decrease next year as be cuts down on mistakes which all rookies make. Simonton has anchored a solid cast of blueline defenders which Delvanthal recruited this season. Shane Holunga and Scott Boyd have played very well for Union, along with sophomore Dean Goulet. These three have combined for 3 goals and 10 assists. The defense has .played quite well together, though you'd never know it from the team's record. But keep in mind factors like this; through the first seven games of 1993, the Union defense allowed only 19 goals, under 3 goals a game. However. after scoring only 2 goals against Cornell and 1 against Dartmouth and Colgate. the Dutchmen lost 6 out of seven of these games. But this fits into the scheme of Delventhal' s plans. The goaltenders are playing well. The defense is playing well. Simonton and Holunga are powerful threats from the point on the power play. The next phase for Union is to bring in more players to score. Though the offense was fairly anemic this season. Union has some definite talent to work with. Chris Albert is having another impressive year, leading the team in scoring with 4 goals and 11 assists in 17 games. Albert cont. on page 18

Refleetions from National Engineer's Week The ancient Greek doctrine of synergism held there is a cooperation between divine grace and human activity. Modern engineers use synergism to recognize that the total effect of cooperation can be greater than the sum of the effects .independently. This type of synergism is inhere.!lt in essentially all things we use or do. The effect of combining a road and wheeled vehicle is far more desirable than either the road or vehicle alone.

The decision to release Genest has been controversial because the school apparently has been forced to make a decision about how important it is for them to be providing such a diverse liberal education at the expense of departmental quality~ In this case, the school has been forced to decide how important Genest is to the Classics department. Interviews were conducted with several people who haye become involved with · Genest's release. Dean Weiner stated during the interview that Classics is a very impor~t department at Union and it shouldn't be Cont. on pg. A2 A similar synergism results from cooperation between individuals. educational institutions, companies, and communities. Thomas Edison and Union College In 1878 Union College awarded an Honorary Doctor of 1 Philosophy degree upon the 31 year old Thomas Alva Edison. This was the first academic recognition for the primarily · self educated Edison. At this time, Edison had spent ten years improving and extending the use of the telegraph., and then had improved the telephone, but be had only recently achieved public fame with his own invention of the phonograph earlier in 1878. Immediately after this · recognition from Union College, Edison began his development of the electric incandescent light. which would be followed with electric power systems, generators~ motors. radio, electric railways. movies and studios, mining methods, constructions techniques and batteries. By the time of his death in 1931. Edison with 1093 patents was generally recognized as the greatest and most important inventor of all time. Edison and Schenectady The 1879light bulb required an electric power system, which needed generators and other components and tfius the manufacturing of electric equipment. In 1886, Thomas Edison chose Schenectady for his major factory. and this resulted in a new phase of prosperity for both Edison and Schenectady. Cont. on pg.

Applications will be made available next week, according to Professor Patrick Allen, the director of the Educational Studies program, and they will be due on April 19 at the Terms Abroad Office. The students will be living in Bridgetown (not on the island of Barbados) with teachers' families. They will commute every day to a secondary school in Barbados. Students will be expected to make structured observations of the teaching and learning methods employ~d at the schools, in addition to teaching English. social studies, science, and other cowses. The school system. that the students will be observing is a derivative of the British school system. There is an exam given to all students when they are eleven years old. A student's performance on that exam detennines their academic future. Students who do well enough are sent to secondary school for six years. Union students will be accotn.panied by students from Saint Lawrence University and Queens College. In return for allowing American students to patticipate in their cultural programs, some Barbadian teachers will receive formal teacher training in the United States. Many teachers in Barbados have never received training. The program was initiated by the Barbadian Teacher's Uniori., whose Vice-President is Union College alumnus Jeff Broomes. On the even-numbered years, students will live in Barbados and conduct research. On the odd-numbered years, Barbadian teachers will receive training in the United States. in institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In order to be eligible to go abroad. students must have taken either Educational Psychology (offered this spring), ot Issues in Human Education (offered next fall). During the term abroad, students will , take an anthropology course and a Caribbean culture course with students from the other American colleges. At the end of the term, students will turn in a research paper which. will be a compilation of their daily observations. .

However, he insisted that administrators can not create positions in departments annually because of the enormous costs involved. He stated that departments other than Classics are also in need of new positions. He then proceeded to list the Spanish, English, and Sociology departments as other areas in need of professors In relation to Genest's release, Dean Weiner stated that their was no possibility to renew Genest's two year terminal contract. Genest is a replacement for a faculty member who is on sabbatical this year and will be returning next year. In 1994 their will be another sabbatical replacement position open, but it is most likely that . Professor Genest will not return. Therefore, Union will lose someone who has expertise in ancient pllilosophy. Professor Genest was willing to discuss the situation with Concordiensis. Genest feels very flattered by the many voices that are speaki11g on his bebalf. Genest discussed his reasons for coming to Union and what he will plan to do in the future. Genest reli11quished IJis tenure so that he could come to Union because he· was excited about the Classics Department and found the ideals of the Gen-Ed Program appealing. He was thriiied about working at such a small institution where he wollld be able to develop personal relations with the students that he teaches. Genest does not know where be will be next year at this time and is still looking for new positions. Genest believes that ancient philosophy should be a priority at a liberal arts institution. and in the future the administration should pursue this core area of education. Genest stated that students are often disappointed with the lack of continuity in some departments. Students are unable to develop relations with adjunct professors or sabbatical .replacements, and this most clearly hurts students who plan to do their thesis in ancient philosophy. In speaking informalJy with several students around campus, it is evident that many are disappointed in the administration's actions surrounding Genest's release. Faculty members are also expressing their disapproval of the recent decision. It is difficult to .address this situation, because although faculty and administration agree .that the budget needs to be balanced, some faculty and students insist that different means can be used to obtain this goal .

The students from 14 of CUNY's 21 college campuses, responded to a proposed yearly tuition hike of $500 by Gov. Cuomo, to offset $40 million of a $92 million budget cut to the CUNY system. \We're holding a strike to stop the proposed budget cuts and tuition increases that Gov. Cuomo wants to inflict on us.\ says April Vassell, a student protester at Hunter College. \We're determined. We're not going to relinquish the building until we get what we want.\ Darren Dopp, spokesperson f-or Gov. Cuomo, states that cuts are inevitable- because of New York's budget deficit. Dopp says~ \Even after increasing tuition. [CUNY] will remain the best educational bargain in the nation.\ \We have the community and the will of the people behind us.\ says Vassell. \It's just a matter of sticking it out until we get what we want.\ Students Occupy Administration Hall In Protest Of Staff Hiring Practices Students at the Claremont Colleges took over an administration building this week to protest alleged racism in faculty in faculty hiring practices at the five affiliated colleges located about 45 miles east of Los Angeles. Students calling themselves Liberation Trough Education blocked off Alexander Hall at Pomona College on Monday, calling for increased minority hiring at the schools, which in addition to Pomona include the Harvey Mudd, Pitzer, Scripps and Claremont colleges. The protest has included a series of teach-ins and marches. Andrew Antwin, a negotiator for the students. said that progress was being made to achieve some resolution with administrators in the coming clays.

February 18,1993, page A4 N·EWS Engineering Week to Reflect on W·ork of Edison, Steinmetz, Nott Collt~ from pg. Al In .1892, the General Electric Company wa.s formed by merging Edis.on's company with other electric companies. Edison, who considered money more as a means for new invention,. rather than invention a means for making money, sold his interest in the new General Electric Company to develoiJ the magnetic separation Of iron ore and other mining technologies. Steinmet2 and General Electric As Edison terminated his active manufactwing interests in Schenectady, the new General Ele{!tric Company brought the 28 year old Charles Proteus Steinmetz to Schenectady ill 1893 and a new era began. Engineere<l products are frrst conceived an-d demonstrated, and then are improved by a process defining the related theory, developing methods for mathematical analysis, and then modifyi11g and improving the design. Whereas Edison had no equal in the creativity of electric apparatus. tile applied mathematician.. scientist and engineer Stei11metz excelled in improving electric power systems with theory and analysis, wllile also receiving more than 3()0 patents and induction into the United Stat~s Patent Office Inventor's Hall of Fame.

The Civil Engineering Department was started under President Eliphalet Nott in 1845 making Union the first liberal arts college to offer engineering. In 1903, Union awarded Steinmetz an honorary Doctor of Philosophy, and an Electrical Engineering Department was established. Dr. Steinmetz continued his work at General Electric, and continued to develop and publish pioneering techniques for analyzing electric systems while serving for ten years as a Professor of Electrical Engineering at Union while accepting no pay, and his friend EFnst Berg became the long term Chairman. · Steinmetz and Schenectady Dr. Steinmetz involved himself in the Schenectady community with the same dedication he demonstrated at General Electric and Union College. He held strong convictions on the importance of public education, parks and recreation opportunities. As a civic leader he was appointed Chairman of the Schenectady Board of Education and was elected President of the Schenectady Public Council. Union College and General Electric in 1993 General Electric Company has provided excellent career opportunities for generatio11s of Union College graduates, who in turn have contributed much to the company's success.

CHICAGO ~ \What do you remember most about Thurgood Marshall?\ I am asked repeatedly as I tour the nation promoting \DREAM MAKERS\' (Little Brown pub.), my story of his life. I think first of his withering wit in the courtroom. When a Virginia lawyer argued that black and white children couldn't attend the same schools, Marshall snapped: \It is in- teresting to me that the very people who object to sending their white children to school with Negroes are eating food that has been prepared, served and almost put in theirmouths by the mothers of those children.\ I think next of the depth of Marshall's dedication to fighting radsm. After he graduated from the Howard University Law School (the University of Maryland had refused to admit him), Marshall got a young black man, Donald Murray, to apply to the Maryland law school. The regents held a special meeting and rejected Murray. Young Marshall strode into the office of Maryland's president and demanded that he be allowed to read the minutes of the regents' meeting. He found in those minutes dear admissions that Mur- ray was rejected for reasons of race only. He won an easy court victory and thus launched a campaign to wipe out Jim Crow in Southern l universities. I remember his incredible bravery. On some visits to Mississippi he had to ride around ill a hearse with three bodyguards and 30 rifles in the back. If he had fear, he masked it with humor. On one trip to Louisiana the press met him at the airport to warn him that a rabi<l racist had put a $10,000 contract on the life of \the burr-headed nigger.\ ~Why should I fear? I ain't burr-headed!\ snapped Marshall. I recall his eai:ly vision - his view that state-imposed racial separation stigmatized black children and damaged thei( ll.earts and minds ir· reparably. He pllt ~stigmatic injury\ in the lexicon of the American judiciary. While some blacks advo· cated sepamtisrn, Marshall never wavered in his belief that any version of wseparate but equal\ would destroy black hopes for justice. Finally, I remember Marshall for his undying devotion to the rule of :aw. He knew the value of marches and protests, bur it irritated him that so many Americans were unaware that the Mont~torncry boycott did not get blacks off tile backs of buses - that only a Supreme Court de..:ision ended Jim Crow in traveL Marshall uset.l the Constitution as a fragile balterin,g rod to pry open schools and colleges, to make the ballot box a welcome place for all. He never stopped believing that respect for that Constitution and the law would someday make America whole. <C 1993 by King Features Synd.

However, the true issues encompassing this system, such as actual cost and practicality, have been glossed over in order to create a picture-perfect image. It is important for the students of this institution to understand the implications that pertain to issues at the College. The V ali-dine system has been used in many schools in the nation for years although it is slated to hit the Union campus in the fall. Hull stresses that this system will be utilized to help avoid a budget crisis for the 1993-1994 academic year. In other words, this system is going to be implemented in order to help the bean-counters make the numbers work. But will it help the Union community at large? Many say the the current dining system is inflexible. It does not provide enough options for the student on-the-g<l who does not have time to wait in the long dining hall lines. It seems to make more sense to make changes to the system that would more directly affect the students than spending $70,000 on this new system. To create more feasible student dining options, an expanded express lunch service, the use of the meal card at all meals during Dutch Hollow hours, and the possible creation of a convenience store would be better uses for this money. The Vali-dine system dictates that all student put $200 into an account each term. Although this money will carry over from term to term, it will not carry over from year to year. So, in practical terms, the Union students could potentially eat a huge loss each year while the College would make an additional sum of money. This institution is a not- for-profit business, yet this sounds like a venture aimed at creating extra monies to cover a faltering budget.

Not that I offend ()n purpose, you understand. It just sort of happens. Perhaps people take offense when they are faced with that thing that horrifies them most - truth. It's often funny to watch people grapple with the reality of human emotion. Jsn't that what the greatest comedians have always done? Since I am the queen of beating til:e dead dog and kicking a lying horse (or whatever) I choose to offend those people who were, sadly enough, offended by an article in last week's Concordiensis. 1 choose to do this because I think that if people are going to start speaking, start writing, they shouldn't stop until they feel that (a) nothing is EVER going to change; or (b) somethin~ has started to change. Well, guess what'l Neither of those things has happened yet. So, here goes •. I C<lntemplate the image of a perpetual motion machine. Stick with me and you'll see what I mean. (Or, maybe you won't.) Last Thursday, I heard people show extreme interest in that particular issue of tbe Concordiensis. It seems that people were upset, annoyed, offeDded, at an article written by Amy Cypres. I am sure they thougllt they had all tbe facts abo11t the situation. Perhaps cettain people felt that what she !tad written was a personal attack on one of their loved ones. But still~ it saddened me to hear how quickly they were willing to judge what they had not yet ~ Perpetual Motion. It seems that we cry so much about the Patriarchy. Why? We know that we love the patriarchy. We would die without its rules and regulations. I was told the other day that women give men responsibility. Do you know what they give us in return? They give us the power to take their ideas and believe that they are, in fact, ours. But. they are not. You, who judged Ms. Cypres's article last week; did you think you were making a. judgment based on your own thinking and reflection? How was that possible when you had not yet read that the issue was so much larger than a. single isolated occurrence. You had, perhaps, heard a. biased account? You are not the maker of the perpetual motion machine. You are the perpetual motion machine. Let me clarify. Since childhood. you have been indoctrinated. No, you haven't? Well, okay. . . Let•s say. for sake of argument, that you have. Who does the indoctrination? Your parents. Probably -- most likely -- you learned how to be a womam from your mother. Now, where did she get her ideas from? Well, the answer seems clear -- her mother. We can continue this ad infinitum. But, what you must understand is that ALL of our ideas come to us from patriarchal society. Which means~ if you are a woman, NONE of these idea~ are yours. Nor were tb.ey yoW' mother's, or your ro-andmother' s. So, great-great-great-great· great grandpa instilled the ideas of domesticity, docility, passivity, and obedience into great-great-great-great grandma. . . and the rest is history. She took over · from there. The cycle of oppression is one that we, as women. perpetuate. Perpetual Motion. Wouldn't it be nice if you came to me and said that you were upset by my article against rush? We could have a conversation; you would express your opinions, and perhaps offer facts that would contradict my statements. We would communicate with one another; and, maybe, as women, start to understand one another. Instead, I hear you (because you don't know what I look like, and, are therefore not inclined to lower your voice) in the College Center. I hear what you say about what I say and about what Amy says. You know what? It's funny. It's funny because we all have to deal with these issues, these very real issues. It's funny because mama never told us there'd be days like these. Sometimes -- forgive me for the following clich~ -- it makes me laugh so hard I want to cry. I want to cry because I don't know you. You know why? Because you don 1 t know you. You never were you and the more you choose to 'attack' us~ the more you lose yourself to the rule -- makers. Let's get it together. Put on the brakes~ and just say NOt Don't fight me because I am honest. Don't fight Amy because she tells the truth. I don't think it feels very nice being a machine. Especially one that can never stop. What do vou think? / .... .::- .r ... ~-­ .;.4' _ _r; _ ... ·,..;: _ ... - ~-·

It 'is Too Cold, Please Help!!!! To the Editor: It is unbelievable how cold it gets in Steinmetz Computer Center on weekends. During this past weekend, when the temperature went down to -20 degrees, the Computer Center was so cold that people were forced to wear their coats while doing tlleir work. I am sure, the school can do better than this. Union College should be able to provide us, the students, with at least a suitable environment for our educational purposes, since in terms of social alternatives, it is unable to do so. However, the lack of heat at the Computer Room, not only during this this past weekend, but for the past two terms, has been unacceptable. In the past, every time I attempted to go to the computer room and type a paper or write a letter, I had to cancel my plans, because it was too damn .cold in there. I know for a fact that there are always people at the Computer Room on weekends, I usually select Steinmetz as the place to study on weekends, but I have been forced to emigrate from that place. I think, no human being in his/her right mind is able to survive these conditions. IT IS TOO COLD !!! I would appreciate it if the school's administration or someone else for that matter do something about this ridiculous temperature inside the Steinmetz building, so that more students would be able to take advantage of the facilities at the Computer Center, especially on weekends. Daniel Aguirre Union College Choir Gets A \Second Wind\ To the Editor: When Professor Hugh Wilson in the Arts Department announced his plans to take a sabbatical for the Winter and Spring terms of this year, quite a few voices rose up in protest and anguish. Most of these voices were sonorous, as the Union College Choir envisipned and experienced feelings of abandonment. Fortunately, Professor Wilson promised he would never be completely out of touch for the remainder of the year, and he provided the Choir with a temporary director in his absence. Thomas Booth has graciously agreed to fill in for Professor Wilson during his leave. While the Choir is composed of thirty to thirty-five musically dedicated, and eager members they ar~ often in need of direction. Lucidly, Mr. Booth has quite an impressive list of. accomplishments,. as well as current projects. Thomas Booth made his New york conducting debut witll the City Center of Music '!nd Drama in a production of Amah! and the Night Visit.{)rs. He has appeared as guest conductor with the Baltilllare, San Francisco, San Antonio and Fort Worth Symphonies and was, for several y~ars, music director of the Eastem Opera Theater and the New York Lyric Opera. For tlrree years, Mr. Booth was rn11sic director for the Western ()pera Theater, part of ~he San Francisco Opera. He has also conducted for the New Y'ork City Opera, Michigan Opera Theater, Opera/Omaha, Ce11tral City Opera, Cararn(}Or Festival, and St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble. Mr. Booth is present};y. conduct<>r of the Mastersingers, and, 11ntil rt?cently, director of music at Christ Church United Methodist in Glen Falls. We cannot stop ourselves from hoping that Mr. Booth is also somewhat of a magician. He might be able to pull several desperately needed Tenors .and Basses out of his hat. Despite the physical Shortage of male singers, the pres~nt singers are able to balance tile rest of the Choir. Don't talce my word for it, though, jud~e for yourself. Since the Choir traditionally performs vel'y lengthy religious works, they do not often receive opportunities to perform on campus. With our \change ()f the guard\ we have decided to change our concert sched~rle too. The Choir will be performing several mini- concerts this term so that the Union community may get a chance to appreciate at hom e. what they must normany travel to Boston or New York City to hear. We hope that yo11 enjoyed our recent set .of \Residence Hall Tours\ alld will take the opportunity Mr. Booth! Elaine Furnari If We Are not Part of the Solution, We are . Part of the Problem .•. To the Editor: Winter depression bas probably affected all of 11s, however our situation cann()t compare to the innoce11t victims who live in Bosnia. Of course we have all heard the term \etllnic cleansing,\ b11t when we apply this term ta human lives we realize th~t there is a world trage<lr occurring while we stress about our school careers. In Bosnia thousands of people have already died and rape camps have been set up to victimize women who are <Jur age. We cannot sit back a11y longer because our silence equals death. Next week the Student Forum. along with The JSU, SPAA, ,and The Women•s LETTERS Union will be setting up a table in the College Center. At our table we will be asking every student and faculty member to sign a petition protesting these acts. We will also be distributing black annbands to Show our support and empathy for the victims. In addition we are asking every student to donate at least one dollar to be given to American Jewish World Service to amend the situation in Bosnia. Every penny of every dollar will go directly to Bosnia. On Thursday, February 25th, demonstrations will be held on college campuses across the country. Here at Union we will be holding our own vigil on this evening to protest the brutal acts in Bosnia. The time and place will be announced early next week. If we are not part of the solution we are part of the problem, so please help out. Sincerely, Lisa Levinger &SethBrown U Can Make a Difference To the Editor: In Latin-America there are millions of children suffering of starvation and many contagious diseases. The reason why this is happening appears to be the lack of financial means. to maintain a healthy diet. Parents, in many cases abandon their young children because they are unable to provide for them or themselves. As a result, many innocent children die every year. To assist in the prevention of starvation and diseases affecting children, the brothers of Phi Iota Alpha are raising money through the raffling of a VCR starting Tuesday, February 9, 1993, from 11:00 am to 3:00PM. The raffle will take place during our party, this coming Saturday, February 27 at the Old Chapel. Corne and at the same time help us celebrate the Dominican Republic independence day. We have looked into this project for over a year now, and we have finally put it together. We have information about our child. Her name is Cintia Viviana Martinez Cortes. She is 3 years old. She was born in Colombia. We will be sending the money made from this raffle to this child the following week. If you would like more information about the Phi Iota Alpha child, please contact me, Daniel· Aguirre at extension X4266 or by school mail to any one of us, at box 1056. We would like you, the Union College community, to help us provide this child with an opportunity at life. An innocent child like Cintia. deserves a healthy .life. So, please, do not take this request lightly. Cindy and the brothers of Phi Iota Alpha will be eternally grateful. Daniel Aguirre February 18, 1993, page A7 A Case of Human Rights, not Women's Rights To the Editor, This letter is in response to the article written by Amy Cypres, in the February 11 issue of Concordiensis, entitled \Silence Equals Death\. I am the woman to whom she is referring ill the article. I am having a difficult time writing my response because I am so infuriated by her warped and twisted account of what occurred in our class on that \disturbing. scary and dark\ Friday afternoon. I find it ironic that I am writing to publicly defend my pride in womanhood to another woman who does not even know me, or what I stand for. I would first like to clarify the details of the confrontation between Amy and the infamous male student. Their \argument\ consisted of the male student attempting to speak and make his point, while being rudely interrupted and badgered by Amy. The tension in the class rose as the male student begged, \Please let me finish my sentence\. The rest of the class (men a.rut women), seemed upset by her lack of consideration for a fellow student, but did not speak up. I am proud of the fact that I raised my band. and asserted myself in d~fense of another human being's right to speak. Freedom of speech is not a gender issue. Amy seems to feel that this is a man's rule so she should not abide by it. It appears she has taken her beliefs to such an extreme that QJ!.U women have the right to speak. Amy has had her writing featured in the school paper, but does she need to be briefed on the fundamentals of the First Amendment in our country, ill this case the classroom? I am extremely insulted by Amy's suggestion that I am a passive· betrayer of women. She does n<Jt know me well enough. from this one sentence I spo1ce in class to make that judgement. She does not have that right! I was not denying Amy's right .to speak, I was simply stating that she should vent her hostility when it was her turn to speak. 1 don't care if she disagreed with her opponent. I don't care if the whole class disagreed with him- evezyone should have the chance to voice their opinion! Maybe Amy should review her argument techniques and realize that an argument is not effective when the arguer simply spouts rhetoric without any understanding of the olher side's point of view. I would like to make it clear that if a male student had been interrupting another student I would have raised my hand and said the exact same thing, for I feel passionate about a..!:U human being's right to speak. This does not make me a \perfect example of the passive female voice: deferential\! Amy should have gotten her facts straight regarding the events in the classroom before relaying them to the public, and using me as a pawn in her melodramatic discourse. She shouild quit manipulating situations to suit her own personal crusades. And final I y, if Amy wants to be educated, without having to listen to any opinion but her own, she should hire a private tutor. · Sincerely, Anne Bartlett '94 Multiple Sclerosis Campaign a Success To the Editor: We at the Multiple Sclerosis Society would like to thank Brett Rubin and his generous. fraternity.

February 18, 1993, page AS FEATURE:S I Was Erin M. O'Neil Featur.es 'Editor A Loser when Date Number Two carne up with an equally original <hte idea- dinner on Wednesday. When our call was over, I ~at on my couch, phone still in hand, and smiled dreamily- thinking of the romance tltat was surely in store for me. My first date was tomorf()W night. My reign as Studette Number Three was off to an incredible start! Studette Just \goodbye.\ So much for my love connection. The next night, when Date Number Two showed up at my door, the first thing he asked was, \How are you feeling?\. Had a litlle chat with Date Number One, did we? Things were off to a great start. We went to a restaurant we bad both heard of, however, we llad not heard that the average price of a meal is about fifteen dollars. \Studs\, only gave us twenty for the whole date. Oops. Like a tme stud, he paid the difference. I appredatedit. Our dinner conversation revolved around the topic of my health, and Date N urn ber Two's home remedies f could use to improve it. Really romantic. Afterwards we got ice cream- I paid, by choice. We licked, and left. Once again, I received nothing but \goodnight\. At this point I realized that the two studs probably saw me as nothing more than a life-sized genn that could talk, and you knoVi what? I didn't care. I wasn ~t picking either of them. Hal lUJJll~le JEcdtn<n I couldn't relieve it. At the last minute f,. Erin M. O'Neil, was ·chosen to lJe one of the three selec1t women affectionate.( y known as \Studettes\ ()n the Union College vers:i()n of \Studs\. I was elated, thrilled- trembling! Gosh, it was a dream come true. Since I first saw the show. I had nothing but the utmost respect and admiration for the women of \Studs\. Nobody else c:an describe their sexual escapades with a complete stranger in such explicit, and tactful, detail quite like a studette. Nobody else has the style, intelligence. wit charm, natural beauty, and- most importantly, the great tan of a studette. Now I was one of them- ME! An overwhelming feeling of acceptance wa:;hed over me. I think I was glowing. Maybe it was all tile excitement, but the next morning I woke feeling slightly under the weather. That's putting it lightly. Actually, everything I saw- partic,..l;llarly food, made me want to throw up. But wlut did that matter- I was a studette. A studette who had to have gone on all her dates by Thursday. So in the spirit .of the show I swallowed my Pepto, and set out for an evening with Date Number One. Uncle Edna is a Union Conege student who answers 11eal questions from real Jeople. H:orny? Lethargic? Coid? Don't write Anne or Abby. ask. your own Uncle Edna, box 83. This week, on the heals of Valentines Day I think it would be appropriate to list off some of the love poems that I submitted to Hallmark this year that were flat-out rejected. If you lik~ any of them, feel free to use them on a loved one. 1) Roses are red, Until they die. 2) Roses are red, Violets are blue, I'm really sorry about that Infection. 3) Roses are red, Violets are blue, Lime jello is green, Cows have spots, Flamingos don't. 4} Roses are red, But at $30.00 for a dozen, They should be platinum. 5) Roses are red, Violets are blue, Sugar is sweet, Valentines day sucks. 6) Roses are red, Violets are blue, Sugar is sweet, But not as sweet as Cindy Crawford. 7) Roses are red, Unless they are yellow, Wherin they'd be the .state flower of Texas. 8) Roses are red, So are tomatoes, And Cardinals. My grandmothers legs, However, are blue. 9) Roses ~e red, And sure make the grade, When you're really horny, And trying to get laid. 10} Roses are red; Violets are blue, I love you my dear, Just kidding. Shortly after being informed of my most coveted title of \~tudette Number Three\ my frrst date called. To protect his identity, I'll call him Date Number One. My excitement was contagiolls. We chatted away for a good five minutes, and by the time \'-e hung up. I knew everything about him. We talked of ()W dreams, our l10pes, our fe:ars. our future childre9- I was certain I'd made aloveconnection-oops.wrong· show! Anyway, he asked if I'd like to get clinner, and go bowling on Tuesday night. I marveled at his imaginative suggestion. Could it get any better than this'? Unfortunately for poor 1 Date Number One, he decided we should get Japanese food. Normally this would be a treat, but in my weakened condition ... let's just say most of the three bites I ate came liP in the bathroom. Date Number One, poor guy, was completely unaware of this until right now. Then it was on to Boulevard Bowl for some championship bowling. Bowling. Just what I wanted to be doing at that moment Not only did we have to g<> bowling, but it was \big ball\ bowling. I'm from Massachusetts, and call LIS weak if you will, but the only places where I've ever bowie<! has candlepin bowling (small balls). I was completely ?auseous, and completely mcompetent. Suffice it to say, I bowled a 27, and we were otJt of there. By this time Date Number One had gotten the hint that I was ill, and welL. there was no goodnight kiss, hug, handshake~ anything. The night before the l:lig show, my roommate and I cruised MohaVik Mall to bl!y some appropriate \studette\ clothes. I purchased a Lovely, and colorful, outfit at \Rave••. home of studette fashion, for only nine dollars. I complete<! my look with accessories frorn \All For a Dollar\ and some orange heels from \Payless\, The overall effect was stunning. Indescribable. I was, in every sense of the word, a true studette whe11 I stepped on stage Saturday night. The crowd was wild, the studs were looking studly, as was the host.

This is what bappened to senior, Joe Morracco. In the fall of 1991. Morracc·o has been diagnosed with Hodgkin's Disease, or cancer of the lymph nodes. It began in the . fall. of 1991 with chest pains, weight loss and a stubborn cold. When his symptoms persisted Morracco's doctor began to explore options other :than a bad head cold. After rnany blood tests and biopsies, there was a large malignant tumor discovered in Morracco's· throat in January of1992. After a bone marrow biopsy, it was determined that the cancer was localized in Mortacco's throat. In order to .prevent the cancer's spread, Morracco did not return to ~chool for spring term and 11nderwent chemotherapy. His treatment lasted twenty-four weeks. Returning to school in tile fall, he continued radiation very tberapy. • When Morracco began · attending classes again he V P 1 r.:i1 [;i\' remembered, \It took a lot of e ry 0 p u ar IBJ a!J . courage to come on ·campus ._ _________ __,;::._ ___ ...,! __ _:. __ _:=:._...:=--_J bald.\ The chemotherapy and radiation treatments had destroyed his hair. He recalls feeling alone, like there was no one that knew what he was going through. \I felt alienated, there was no one on this campus who really understood. They would say 'too bad' but no one really knew.\ Morracco survived his ordeal. The cancer is now in remission and he is taking regular classes again. Yet, Morracco wants to make sure that no other student, either . having cancer or watching a family member battle it, has to do it alone. In order to help others he is now starting a cancer support group on campus. \I know there are support groups at Ellis Hospital and around the area, but they are for older people. I want to reach people our own \M age. orracco stated. If there is a large enough student response Morracco plans to 1 sponsor speakers to create a source of information for group members. These speakers would visit regular meetings, to give cancer patients, and family and friends of cancer patients, a chance to :be informed and vent their feelings in a group that truly understands. All those affected by cancer either personally or through a friend or family ·member are encouraged to contact Joe Morracco to help create support for themselves and others. i I ·! I I

A Singular Disease Michelle Rosenbaum Features Writer. Two years ago, I remember when my mother and I were standing in silence in the doctor's office. She kept saying, ''I kllew this would happen, great timing, the day before SAT's, this same tiling happened· to Laura (my sister).\ It was one of the few times my mom took me to the doctor for being sick since I was always a healthy child. This time, my sore throat, fatigues. and fever, got her very worried. I was worried too when the doctor told me what I might have .... He did not tllink I had AIDS, or any life threatening disease tllat we are constantly warned about. I had symptoms for mononucleosis! Does that ring a bell? My test turned out to be negative, luckily. but many people are not as lucky. My sister had it for two weeks. I'll never forget how sick she looked. She, a usually energetic person, was tired all the time, when she had it. The majority of people who get mono. are college students, yet we are rarely warned about it. Okay, mono may not be life- threatening, but it's effects are bad enough. The infection produces a fever and swelling of lymph glands. People with it are usually very lethargic, have trouble talking, and have a small appetite. They may have to lay in bed from one week, for an unsevere case, to one month, for a more severe case. Once a person is recovered enough to go back to the normal routine, he or sbe still 1ias the infectiorf instilled in his or her body. As a reslllt one should not drink alcohol, should not kiss any one, or shoold not take part in any extraneous exercise for a couple of months. Last week one of my close friends had to go home because Studette cont. from page SA did some serious bonding with a fellow studette upon the realization that .she too, had picked neither. Then came tbe moment of truth, when the two studs revealed who they chose for their eternal studette. Date Number One picked the otller studette who picked neitller stud. Diss. Date Number Two picked the studette who picked him too. Oo<Joooooh! How sweet. That left me. Nobody picked. me. Devastation. I broke down in tears, and fled the CoUege Center in disgrace. I am writing this from tbe psychiatric ward at Ellis Hospital, where I am recovering . from a bout of severe depression. They say the cuts from the razor blade: should heal without tQo much scarring. What I thought would be the most rewarding experience of my life has left me a broken woman. Boycott Studs! of the disease. Therefore it 1s around Union college. Out ~f anything I could get, one of my biggest fears is mono. I could never imagine having to lay in bed for such a long .period of time. That's just as much life-threatening than anything. If the disease is not highly contagious and death is rare, why are we worried? Lets begin with. what doctors think as not highly contagious. 'ft> obtain the disease, there must be oral' contact, such as kissin~ or sharing a cup with a \victim.\ Think about when you are in the dining hall or at Dutch Hollow and you ask your 'best friend for a sip of his drink. I've done it and I'm sure more that half this school has. There goes the infection frorn one cup to another. Also, what about those \seldom\ times Union students go to a party and drink beer. When you're a little buzzed you may pick up the wrong cup! There goes tile infection, again! Lets turn to the kissing part:. Think about all the one nigllt . stands that occur here. The infection has fun jumping from : one to the other! Even if you have a boyfriend or girlfriend, how do you know he or she hasn't drank from someone else's cup? _ it's harder to find out if someone drank from someone else's cup than if someone slept with someone else! There obviously isn't any sure way to prevent yourself from obtaining mononucleosis, but if you're worried about getting this \chronic fatigue syndrome,\ watch out what you dol Maybe next time you're thirsty, buy yourself a drink, don't take that sip from your friend, it may prevent you from not only getting mono, but also from getting a cold~ the flu, or any other illness! Also, it's good to be careful not to run yourself down. Be good to your body! WRITE FOR EATURES CALL E.RIN X4156 OR DOUG X4040 FEATURES February 18, 1993, page A9 Nothing To Do? Alexis Leist Features Writer A few weeks ago, somebody asked me what I was doing over the weekend. I told them probably the same old thing I always do and then added \There is nothing to do here.\ ' But, now that I think about it there is plenty to do on our campus, it is just a matter of finding out what it is, when it is, and who would be interested in going. Let's start out with the basics. The weekend movies at the College Center are always popular { I thought School Ties and Singles were awesome, but who went to see The Mighty Ducks anyway and was I the only one who came out of Single White Female fearing my roommate?) But. tllat's a different story. OK, so that's not a bad way to start out a Friday night. Then, there is Chet's where students who are \of age\ can get a drink and bang out. During the week. Chet's has a lot of different activities going on (see Chefs Corner). This weekend, the Minstrels and Dutch Pipers performed Friday night, and Union's frrst STUDS (not half as cheesy as the real one) was held Saturday night. Dutch Hollow. on the weekends, serves as a pit stop for students to find out what is going on, and all the latest gossip (we've all heard the famous \Oh my God, ~ have to talk to you about what happened last China Tobias Jackson Contributing Writer I always thought that New York city was the melting pot of the world. I was wrong. Yes, it's true that the Big Apple has been home to people uf all nations for over four centuries. But there is something that disqualifies New York as the worlds most diversified city. I can't quite put my finger on the reason for this. but I know that I have never seen ten people of ten different nationalities eating lunch together in any random pizzeria. Many times have I sat down with four or fiv.e guys, all of different races, but we were really all Americans. We did most of our growing up in New York City. We all had American values. This may be hard to believe, but a city in China called Qanjing is the melting pot ol the world. Nanjing, meaning 'Southern Capitol,' is a cit} about 250 miles west ol Shanghai. It lies to the soutll of the Yangtze River and wesl of the Purple mountains. Nanjing is home to eighl universities, all of which have a foriegn student population. Over the past four decades, China has developed a formidable friendship with ,. night) Oh yeah, people go· there to eat also. That sums up the College Center so let's move on. This weekend, SHOCKRA played at the Memorial Chapel {or is it the Old Chapel, I can never remember). I lieard they were pretty good, but when I stopped by around eleven I was disappointed to find they had stopped playing because there weren't enough people. Hopefully, more bancls will be playing soon and more people will take advantage. Fero house, the new coffeellouse also looks promising. Like Chet's, it will have different guests and activities and it is nice to get out of the noisiness of the College Center every once in a while. I find that a lot of people like to go out to eat on the weekends, and then just hang out in the dorm with friends before they head out to parties. Also, it is so cold here tbat some of us don't eve11 have the desire to leave our rooms. Yet, we give in to the pressure anyway. When the hockey team plays at home, that also draws a large crowd. Finally, around ten or eleven, fraternity parties come alive. It is virtually impossible to visit every one in a single night, and who would want to? Everyone has their favorites, and these are determined by the people. the music, the cleanliness of the house, the odor, how many people can fit in one room, etc. (l was once at Sigma Chi and I was moving, although my feet were not touching the floor!) Whether you prefer hanging out with a small group of close friends, or a party packed wall to wall, that's your choice. But, the great thing is that no matter what you will always find that one fraternity where you love everyone, and even if you don't know anyone it is a great time. Theme parties (and tlleme drinks) are always a big success also (Black and White parties, World War 3, Taco and Tequila, Suitcase party, to name a few.) Next week is Union's first all-school formal, \A Winter Affair\. It is sold out already a11d a waiting list is available. [t is being held at the Ramada Saturday night. This is a great idea because it gives girls an opportunity to buy a new dress, guys a chance to grumble, and something different to do this weekend. Not too shabby. Looking back, I'd say there is plenty to do on the weekends without leaving campus. Yet, r don't think enough students Wee advantage of the activities which are offered here. Get a group of friends together and go! There is no reason why anyone should be bored. A few suggestions: don't assume that \nobody will be there\ or that an activity is \lame\. If there is something you are interested in. just go. Chances are you'll make new friends who have the same interests as you! Like the ad says \JUST DO IT.\ Term Abroad many third world nattons. Students from Africa. Southeast Asia, South America, and Eastern Europe are easilky found in Nanjing. Then there are the Western Europeans. Americans. Canadians and Japanese studying Chinese culture. None of these stude11ts have lived in China for more than three or four years. They all have been raised in different cultures having different1 values. From what I can tell.' there is only one real similarity between these forei ghnors: almost all of them can speak the English language. I present to you an average evening spent in Nanjing. My Chinese friend stops by my hotel for a visit at six o'clock. We sit down at a table with students from Zambia, GIJana, Madagascar, Germany and France. They offer us some of their beer and we accept. Within the next hour. a group of Chinese students and a dozen others show up. The Chinese waitress allows us to go behind the bar to play to our music. By nine o-clock there arc people from at least twenty countries, including Cllina. W c relax for another hour or two then everybody makes their way to the University wbich will be host to this weeks party. By the end of the night, I have conversations with people from every corner of the earth. It's awesome. All Union college students who went on the China term abroad have made life-long friendships with various Chinese. africans, North ans S<>uth Americans, and Europeans. The hospitality of the Chinese is overwhelming. What lleamed about the world during my fifteen weeks in China far outweighs whatever I had known beforehand. I traveled for three weeks to S<>uthern China after the school term. I remember very well one particular incident in a small town called Y angshuo. I was sitting down with four students enjoying dinner. After a half hom: it struck me that I was sitting with two Israelis and a Palestinian. They were laughing with each other. ..; .

. : ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT February 18, 1993, page B3 Take a Lqok· (It's Really a Book) By Dass Seamen Concorqensis Staff Have you been to the library ~ tu see the books yet? Well, of course not those books-- the heavy dark ones creating aisles and aisles of books blending into books. I mean the ·~other\ books that visually delight your \ eyes with their imaginative uniqueness. What is your conception of a book anyway? Is it what fills the library from head to foot or can it be \the book\ as a visual object in itself? Spring term, sophomore year, I took a class with Profes~or Charles Steckler called \Intermedia Workshop\ (remember that name when you are pre registering for spring term--INTERMEDIA WORKSHOP). I began to call the class simply and endearingly, \my book making class\. Before this class, my conception of a book was a bunch of pages with words and pictures. bound together. This is still true, but there can be much more. Suspend your conventional ideas of a book and imagine the possibilities. A book made out of beer cups A book in a bottle A ;photo flip book A folding book A book whose pages are made out of paper that you made! A book with no meaning A book that you can't open A book bilked into cookies A book made out of a cereal box that yo11 use as a journal Asking people before they took the cla.ss was like asking certain peo})le to go to a horror movie. They shrink back and scream,\Ob no (Mr. Bill)! I'm not creative.\ After taking Intermedia Workshop, I asked the class for their reviews. \Two thumbs Up\ \The best class I've ever taken\ \I laughed, I cried, It became a part of me.\ \It was better than ET\ (who was mighty good, I'd say) You may not think you are creative, but ·you are an individual and have your own great ideas. Just wait until you are seated. clown in a mom with markers. paints, fabrics, patterns, crayons, magazines, and a photocopy machine! The things you can do! You would be surprised at your own genius as you sing colors, textures, smells, and tastes into a score of spilling, splashing, crumbling, cut and pasting (savor the melodrama!) And you, yourself will create a new conception of what a book can Na-tasha's Stars ARlES (March 21-Apri119) Foll.ow your intuition this week, and you'll like the end results. You come into your prime midweek, so make the most of the different cycles. You feel more connected than you have in a long time. Do watch your need to spend money. TAURUS (April 20-May 20) You're on the roller coaster ride of your life. The good news is that you end the week on a high note. Just take a moment to think before you launch into action, because whatever you go for, you shall receive. You sizzle this weekend. GEMINI (May 21-June 20) Gra- ciously accept the responsibilities dumped on you, and you come out smelling sweet as a rose. Celebration hits midweek. You see more of a friend than you ever thought possible. You have many reasons to vanish this weekend. CANCER (June 21-July 22) Your imagination leads you in new direcc tions and gives you the vision you need. Take the ball and run with it at work. If you manage your work well, you will be able to partake in all sides of your life. You are the party this weekend. LEO (July 23-August 22) One-to- one relating dominates, and you get down to the basics in a partnership. Examine how far you are going with a risk. Be willing to examine different options. You knock around town all weekend long. VIRGO (August 23-September 22) Others seek you out for advice, and also for agreement. You nee~ to use a measure of decorum deahng with those needy folk. You are negotiating different arrangements whh others. Plan on taking off this weekend for a mini -vacation. LIBRA (September 23-0ctober 22' Get work done early in the week. B< more tuned into those around you as others knoclc on your door and want your company. Make plenty of time fo1 a special person in your life thi::. weekend. SCORPIO (October 23-November 21) Your IIlore playful side emerges early on in the week. Let this high energy and spunk charmel itself intc your work. Dynamic interactions occur naturally throughout the week. Be ready to be enticed and drawn into some wildness this weekend. SAGITI ARIUS (November 22 · December 21) Consider a domesti~ change. Emphasis is on your executive · abilities and efficiency all week long Be more energetic in your day-to-da: life. You may need to rest and relax al weekend long in order to recharge you: batteries. _ CAPRICORN (December 22- January 19) Be lighter in your ap· proach and be available to others for conversations and inquiries. Examine alternatives. You carmot give a family member ei:Jough attention right now, especially if' you want to feel clear enough to be a bit wild this weekend. AQUARIUS (January 20-February 18) Watch spending ap.d overindulging this week. Get into ·a more disciplined pattern in your day-to-day life. Ash questions and demo11strate your ef ficiency.

February 18, 1993, page B6 .S.PORTS Women's Ski Team Achieves Undefeated Sta:tus ------------------------ by Liz Landa Concordiensis Staff This past weekend, the Union College ski team competed in its last regular s-eason carnival of the season. This race was hosted by Albany State at nearby West Mountain. Due to .the weather on Saturday, the slalom race was cancelled. They did llowever hold the giant slalom race on'Sunday. On the women's side, Cindy Mayne led the way once again with a strong finish in second. Otiler Union finishers included Liz Landa in third, Nicole Za mansky in tenth, Betsy Mitchell in eleventh, Sasha Mason in fourteenth, and Briana Patnode in fifteenth. The women's team finished yet again in an impressive first place in the team competitio11 to keep their undefeated status intact for the season. This is the first time in Union Col!leglil history that the women's te:am has established such a11 impressive mark. I'h;e women's team also clinched .a bid to the Eastern Championships in WaterviU( Valey, New Hampshire, this coming Friday and Saturday~ On the men's side, th;e regular team got a little bare. Brooks Glahn led the wa:y finishing third. Other finisihers included Mike Singer i11 fifteenth, and newcomers Ale:x Johnson in twenty-third ;and Will Rig.gs in the DNF position. Even without the normal men's team members present, they managed to finish an impressive fourth place. The men just missed qualifying for the Eastern Championships, so their season has now ended. This season was somewhat of a :liebuilding year for the men, so we can look foreward to some strong performances next yeai. Overall, this season was a huge succes for the women's team. The team now heads into Eastern's as one of the favorites to make it to the National Championships in Squaw Valey, CA, March lOth - 13th. Thank you for your support and wish us luck this weekend! Race Heats Up in Patrick Division by Greg Kalish Concordiensis Staff While it still may be about a month too early to start securing positions for post- season play in ·the National hockey League, there is no denying that a furious playoff · hum is under way in the P\alrick Division. The race is primarily between four teams: the New York Islanders, the Washington Capitals, the New York Rangers and the New Jer:sey Devils. As of Monday, the Capitals held second place wilh sixty-two points, followed by the Rangers with fifty-nine and then the Islanders and Devils with fifty-eight points each. It is safe to assume that the Penguins, sitting atop the division with seventy-nine points will not be caught and that the last place Philadelphia Flyers will not be much of a contender. The Washington Capitals have had somewhat of an erratic year. After an extremely slow start, the team picked it up during mid-season, playing some of the best hockey any team has played this year in the months of November and [)eccmber. Led by outspoken and! outlandish defenscman AI Iafrate, a top candidate for the Norris Trophy this season, the Capitals have rccci vcd most of their scoring from their dcfcnsemen. The goaltending crop, consisting of Don Beaupre and Jim Hrivnik, has been outstanding at times and shaky at other times. The illljury bug has hit the Caps as well, as many of their star pla)'crs like Sylvain Cote and Dmitri Kristich has missed portions of the season. However, with these players returning to form, they should !()c&: up a playoff spot and possibly advance in lhc pLayoffs. Tlhe New York Rangers have the most well~rounded team in the !NHL ... on paper. They have tale11t, speed, and scoring with players like Mike Gartner. Mark Messier, Tony Amon te, and Alexei Kovalev. They hllve a decently solid defense with Brian Leetch, Kevin Lowe a.nd Jeff Beukeboom. And t!Ley have stellar goalkeeping from the dynamic duo of Mi:ke Richter and Jo:tm Vanbeisbrouck. So why is this team struggling so? Injuries have dismantled the defe11se for one reason. Last season's Norris winner Brian Leetch lias been out since mid-December with a nerve condition in his neck. Other defensemen S\Lch as Jay Wells and rookie MLke Hurlbut have missed time as well. Offensively, the Rangers have been ,getting the goals from Mike Gartner and Mi.ke Gartner only. Messier is piling up the points but his level of play is not what it was last season. Amonte has shown flashes of brilliance, but llis numbers have fallen off as well. . Then of course, there is the goaltending. The Rangers are third to last in goals allowrecl this season, a dramatic cha11ge from last year. Vanbeisbrouck has been the better of the two. but he has had his share of hard times in the crease. Mi:ke Richter's season has simp>ly been a nightmare. From Wales Conference All-Star last year to a two-week stint wiitfu Binghamton this past January. Richter is just recenlly beginning to show signs of great saves made in the past. Both goalies are struggling to keep their goals-against- average below four and their records near the .500 mark. Kudos to the New Yoork Islanders! Despite stiJl not being able to fill the Nass::au Coliseum, the Islanders have made tremendous strides fr()m one year ago. Led by Pierre Turgeon, arguably the best player in the Patrick Division this season, the team has turned things around and has a legitimate shot at landing a playoff berth. The Islanders have been rejuvenated 100 d~fense with Russian imports Darius Kasparitis and Vladimir Malakhov. Kasparitus, despite his dirty play, has been a solid blueliner and Malakhov has helped with defensive scoring. The two should be a dominant force in the division for many years. A lack of goaltending, however, is still preventing the Islanders from making that leap to the upper echelons of the NHL. Glenn Healy has played erratically and Mark Fitzpatrick has not been the same since contracting EMS, a potentially fatal blood disorder, nearly three years ago. Finally, there are the New Jersey Devils. Despite the presence of many quality players, the team has lacked consistency throughout the season. Playing in one of the most humdrum arenas in the country doesn't help either. The Devils have been inspired by the sparkling goaltending of Craig Billington, a first time All-Star. But they lack leadership and players of superstar quality. A recent trade for Bernie Nicholls should improve the team's scoring, especially on the power play. Scott Stevens is a quality player and very few have a more deadly shot than Stephane Richer. But the Devils are missing certain key ingredients to elevate them to the next level. Their speed is questionable, their offensive output erratic at times, and the lack of a true leader has hampered to Devils efforts to improve. All in all, it should be quite an exciting stretch run for the fans of all four teams. There arc still many questions left unanswered. Do the Islanders have the experience necessary to grind it out with veteran teams in a playoff race? Are the Rangers holding something back? And if so, when will they pick up their level of play? And do the Devils have enough talent to make the playoffs? The Sullivan Sheet by Rick SUIIiv,an <llnu.cJJr b iru.nln Sports Quiz · by larry Duncan . . NATIONAl ..

Thousands of young children and their parents filled the garden to witness a friendly game of hockey, ami then after· the Schwazz: A Man and His Mask . hot Knicks were able to defeat the Bulls and are currently the number one team in the East because of it. So Jordan's suspension had a major effect on his team. Just as Jordan would expect to be protected as a member of the league's franchise players, he must be acted against when he breaks the rules. Had Miller butted Jordan, I would not complain if Miller was punished harshly Rangers and Blues were finished, they would be treated to a special legends game. But only 21 seconds after the opening puck was dropped, Mark Messier and the Blues' Basil McRae were swinging at each other. Did tile little kiddies know enough about hockey to wonder wily Basil McRae was even on tb.e ice on a line with Blues star Brett Hull? Did St. Louis' coach believe that McRae and his 2J57 career penalty minutes (11th aU-time in the NHL) would be making that beautiful pass to set up Hull's phenomenal slapshot? Somehow I doubt it. Anyway. play and hard checking is an important ·and legitimate part of the game. I will even admit that I enjoy a good hockey fight. Everyone does, and if they deny it they are lying. But I still feel that hockey fighting must be banned from the game. To hockey fans it seems like a normal thing, but think about how ridiculous it is. Let' me paint a picture for you: Roger Clemens' fastball comes a little too high and inside, causing Jose Canseco to step back off the plate. Canseco grabs his bat, charges the mound and proceeds to exchange blows with Clemens as the rest of the team piles on to the field to beat each other up. What would you think if 3 innings later Clemens was facing Canseco again, but Carlos Quintana was ejected for being the 3rd man in. You would be shocked because fighting is· not accepted in sports and should not be iR hockey either. By Dagan LaCorte Associate Sports Editor It's a cold winter night at Union College as the crowd pours into Achilles rink to see the Skating Dutchmen ln action. Warm-ups end, the teams go into their respective locker rooms. As the crowd silences, the \Masked Dutchman\ steps on the ice. Donning a painted goalie mask, . and armed with a cowbell the Herculean figure of Adam Schwartz attempts to rile the crowd for the ensuing battle. Schwartz, known as \Schwazz\ to the majority .of the Union population, is considered to be the mascot of the Skating Dutchmen. · Sch wazz is a junior from Oceanside, Long Island. When asked why be got involved in such a time and effort consuming activity, Schwazz replied, \I do it for the team and the fans, I'm trying to get them pumped-up\ Schwartz first began his career as mascot last term, when he could be seen beating a cowbell as he went through the crowd during early season games. After purchasing a Union jersey at his own expense (contrary to rumor, Schwazz receives no grants from the school for his costume) Schwazz was one accessory away from completing his guise. The mask is the single element which adds the mystique to Schwazz's ensemble. \I found an old . since Jordan. is a star. r agreed mask in my garage and deci<led · with the fining and suspension to paint it\. of Adam Graves of the New Like most people Schwazz York Rangers w_hen he slashed realizes that instant success of Penguin superstar Mario the team is impossible.

Wbat a nice sight for the young crowd learning about hockey. I am a purist hockey fan. I enjoy the finesse parts of the game .. But I will admit that aggressive Schwartz also understands tilat the NHL playoffs last year. people take the teams lack of success out on him. \The fans get disappointed about the performance of the team and they sometimes take their frustrations out on me\. If one would travel to other schools in the E.C.A.C. they would see what Schwazz is trying to accomplish. Schools like Vermont, Cornell, and Harvard not only are unified in their cheering, but are very creative, and often make the other team feel like they're in alien territory. The fact is, its easier to root for a team that is winning than one that is not. Union is in only its second year of Division I competition, and its going to take some time before the team starts winning any championships. If the fans feel frustrated, they should think how the players feel. They step on the ice every week 3Ild give 100%, without chalking- up many victories. In hockey, as in any sport. when you're playing at home . you have what's called a \home-ice-advantage\. Unfortunately. this \advantage\ isn't evident at Achilles' rink.

February 18, 1993 Skating Dutchmen Falter At Vermont, Dartmouth by Dagan La Corte associate Sports Editor The Skating Dutchmen of Union took to the road this past weekend to face Vermont and Dartmouth. Union had early season success versus Vermont, claiming their first Division I home victory against the Catamounts earlier this season. Vermont, whose record was 7-7 in division play, was not willing to permit a Dutchmen sweep. Forty five seconds into the ftrst period the Catamounts took a 1-0 lead, and from then on never looked back. They scored two more goals in the first. and added one more in each of the remaining two periods to make the final score 5-0. .. The following night the team made their way through sleet and snow to face off against Dartmouth. One of Union's two victories last season was an overtime win against the Big Green in Hanover, New Hampshire. The Dutchmen were hoping to renew their success against Dartmouth. and chalk-up their first road win of this season. Unfortunately this was not the weekend for the Dutchmen as the Big Green bombarded Union with four third period goals to make the final score 7- 3. Jayson Flowers showed great speed in the game, leading to his first period goal; which was assisted by Reid Simonton, the leading defensive scorer for the Dutchmen. After Dartmouth went ahead 3-1 Union's leading scorer Chris Albert netted his fifth goal of the season to cut Dartmouth's lead to one goal. Rookie leading scorer Ryan Alaspa assisted on the goal, along with defensemen Shane Holunga. Union's defense and goaltending lapsed during the third period, and the Dutchmen fell behind 6-2 before Kevin Darby tallied his fourth goal of the season, with assists going to Scott Boyd and Ryan Alaspa. The Dutchmen hope to tum their luck around this weekend, with games on the road against Clarkson and St. Lawrence. NBA Talk by Rich Morgan Co-Sports Editor As the season reaches the halfway point, a variety of up-a11d-coming teams have soared to become the best amongst the NBA elite group. Here is the list (by record) of the best clubs in the National Basketball Association: Team 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. Phoenix Suns S. A. Spurs Chicago Bulls New York Knicks Utah Jazz Supersonics Trailblazers Clvd. Cavaliers 9. New Jersey Nets 10. Houston Rockets With the All-Star performance of Sir Charles Barkley, the Phoenix Suns have dominated the first half of this season's play. His 25.7 points per game leads the Suns, who are also supported by their two other key players, Dan Majerle (16.8 ppg) and Sean Dumas (16.7 ppg). The Admiral David Robinson, who will be making another All-Star appearance this weekend, has recently lead his Spurs to the top of the Midwest. The Spurs are currently the hottest team in the league, having won 7 in a row, 9 out of 10, and 20 of their last 23 games Won 36 32 34 32 32 31 29 33 29 28 Lost 10 14 17 16 17 17 16 19 21 21 Pet. .783 .696 .667 .667 .653 .646 .644 .635 . 580 .571 since their former head coach {Tarkanian) was replaced by Lucas.

Yes, this week the great God of basketball Michael Jordan was not only called for a foul, but actually suspended for a game and fined for a flagrant foul. In the Chicago Bulls' game against the Indiana Pacers this week, Jorrum was involved in an incident in which he head-butted Reggie Miller of the Pacers. When the whistle blew, not only was Jordan not taking his usual stroll to the free throw line but he was headed for the locker room. Its about time. After years of watching Jordan travel, elbow and shove his way to the hoop without being called for a foul, it was a nice cbange to see him punished for a flagrant foul. I have seen Jordan go up for a 20 foot shot while gyarded by 3 men only to land. and fall back before launching the ball at the basket, without 'being called for a travel too many times. Don't get me wrong. Jordan is the greatest player in basketball history and the NBA would not be half as exciting without him. He is far superior in athletic ability and basketball skills than almost spots have risen for both teams. The Bulls performance is down from last year, and they are currently suffering from a number of injuries, mainly to starters Horace Grant {bruised back), center Bill Cartwright (sore knee/back), and guard John Paxson (knee surgery). The Knicks are without statting guard Rolando Blackman for a few games due to a sore right knee. The Knicks are coming into the All-Star Break after losing to the Orlando Magic in what can be called the most exciting and entertaining game of the season so far. The triple overtime loss (102- 100) by the Knicks saw three of their starters fool out leaving the inevitable Rookie of the Year, Sbaquille O'Neal, all alone to dominate post· regulation play with 4 blocked shots (and 29 points for the game) . It is apparent from the above list ()f dominating teams that th~ most potent division in the NBA is, without a doabt, the Pacific Conference. The top three teams in the division are among the top seven teams in the league, with a combined won-loss recor<l of96-43. anyone else on tile comt. He is a tenacious defender, a fantastic shooteF and passer. and practically inhuman whem driving to the basket. But thi~ is exactly why he does not 11eed the special treatment which he has earned as a superstar of the NBA. . And I don't get 'too upset except when I see llim get away with the violent aspects of basketball which are fouls for everyone else~ Granted he is not the only one who receives this treatment. Las.t week, Charles Barkley, now of the league-leading Phoeni)l{ Suns, seemed to have the referees in his back pocket in his game against the Orlando Magic in Phoenix. Charles was able to drive straight a£ rookie superstar Shaq11ille O'Neal~ barrel into Shaq as he .stood his ground with his hands straight up, and have the whistle blown on the bewildered rookie. Quickly. Shaq found himself in majol!' foul trouble ooce Barkley realized the power he possessed. So maybe it is no big deal. Maybe the elite ranks of the NBA deserve this treatment since they put tile fans in the seats. But the violence in sports and in the NBA is something else. Two seasons Of these ten teams, oneof the big surprises for th()se who have not kept up with the season is the play of tbe New Jersey Nets. With tbe ninth best record, the Nets also lead the league in rebounding percentage (.52~)~ and are first in the Atlantic Division with 14 wins on tile road, a difficult task for m<>st NBA teams. The were recently snubbed from the All-Star Game this corning weekend, sending no playe-rs as either a starter or a backup for the mid-season festivities. An interesting note here is that from looking at the top 12 leading scorers in the NBA, all but Drarlen Petrovic (ninth in the league) made the team. He is also tops in the league in 3-point goals. Both Kenny Anderson and Derrick Coleman also had very legitimate shots at making the team, but were also turned down. If the teams continue to play the way tlley are, tbe playoffs should turn out to be more intense and' exciting; than ever before. Several teams have excellent chanc:es: of makinf the fi11als, and any two of them wilt prove to be a contest worth wat~hing. At this point, I would probablv ago, Utah Jazz {lower forward Karl Malone elbowed Piston guard Isaiah Thomas in the head so ·hard' that he required multiple stitches in his forward. Malone, the mailman, is a perennial all-star and Thomas is a very disliked player throughout the leagqe, particularly by Jordan. Malone received ~little more than a slap on .the wrist. Now, Reggie Miller, the bigmoutbed .. obnoxious scorer on Indiana is certainly not a league fav@rite in the players' eyes~ hilt that does not give Jordan tbe right to head-butt him. Vivlence has no place in professionm. sports and action must be taken when it occurs. Maybe the fine Jordan received is insignificant when compared to the ridiculous amount of money he is paid to play for the Balls md tlle millions of dollars he makes for appearing in Nike commercials with Bugs Bun.ny. But the suspen$i()n turned out to be quite significant. The Bulls played their biggest Eastern Conference rivals. the New York Knicks in Chicago the next day. Normally, the Bulls are heavy favorites to win any home game. and their home games against the Knicks are have go with Cleveland and Phoenix.. Both of these teams are on a collision for the finals. and with the increase in competition ov~r last year, there is no way that the Bulls will three-peat. Barkley and Majerle versus Price and Daugherty. Who knows? It could happen. Wait and see (sorry, Dallas- maybe next year!) WRITE FOR SPORTS CALL HAL (X4319), RICH (X4314), OR DAGAN (X4138).

Founded at Union College 1877 Volume 122, Number 15 Schenectady, NY February 25, 1993 AAC and SAC Review Greek Policies by Craig .Greenberg Concordiensis Staff One of the primary complaints of professors during the past several yea-s has been the condition in which their students arrive for class. Such disturbing conditions have included intoxication, radical sty Ies of dress, an<l disruptive objects carried to class. Faculty believe most of these disturbances are due to student involvement in fraternity and sorority pledging. \Rushillg\ and \Hell Week\ are purportedly responsible. In addition to causi11g problems for the academic community, students who act in such a manner often suffer academically as a <lirect result of pledging. which the AAC feels might remedy some of the problems students who are pledging face during the second half of the academic year. The AAC proposes that the SAC address the problems with class preparation facing students entering the Greek houses. Another proposal, centered around a recommendation that the SAC discuss with the Interfraternity Council (IFC) and/or the presidents of fraternities and sororities. ·offers several possible options to rectify the various problems associated with inducting members into Greek houses. photo by Scott Steele Crosstalk Explores \Lack of Community\ Greeks and Independents Express Differing Views about Problem This recommendation included various points of interest.

Cont. on page 14 Page 16 Skating Dutchmen Look to Home Finale by Dagan La Corte associate Sports Editor This past weekend the Skating Dutchmen of Union journeyed north to face off against division rivals St. Lawrence and Clarkson. Union had yet to win a·road game this season, and that trend continued as they lost 7-0 at St. Lawrence, and 9-0 the following night at Clarkson. Union's offense has struggled as of late, scoring a total of thFee goals in their last four games; all of which were away from Achilles rink. The Dutchmen hope to turn their luck around this weekend in their last homestand of the season against Cornell and Colgate. . Union faces Colgate Friday night. After winning three straight, the Red Raiders have dropped four of their past five games. Colgate's leading sc<Jrer is senior Andrew Dickson. who has amassed eleven .goals and twenty assists to lead the Red Raiders in sc<Jring. On January 23, the Red Raiders hosted Union at Starr Rink in Hamilton. [t was a close fought defensive game, with the Red corning up victorious by the score of 2-1. Union hopes to turn tile tables this weekend at Achilles Rink. The Dutchmen also face the Big Red of Cornell this weekend. Cornell like Colgate has had little recent success. dropping their last eight games. Their last victory carne in Ithaca against the Dutchmen. In that game they beat Union by the score of 5-2, avenging Union's upset victory at Cornell last season. Cornell plays RPI Friday night, and ends their road season against the Dutchmen Saturday. The Big Red is headed by Senior Ryan Hughes, who has eight goals and 21 points to lead all Cornell scorers. Cornell has an overall record of 5-16-1. It would provide the Dutchmen with great confidence if they could muster a victory or two before their home crowd. The Dutchmen finish their season next week on the road versus Dartmouth and Yale. East + West Equals Showtime By Igor Tsukerman Contributing Writer Once a year, the best in the National Basketball Association meet in the annual all-star game. The fans select which players get to play in the game by filling out their all-star ballots. Well, when the best in the East and the West meet. it's showtime. Karl Malone had 28 points and 10 rebounds and Utah Jazz teammate John Stockton collected 9 points and dished out 15 assists to lead the Western Conference to a 135- 133 overtime victory in the 43rd annual NBA all-star game at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. Hometown hewes. Malone and Stockton were named Co-most valuable players, marking just the sec()nd time in all star history that the award was shared. Elgin Baylor of Minnesota and Bob Pettit of St. Louis shared the award in 1959. Stockton had 4 points in overtime and Dan Majerle and Charles Barkley each sank key 3-point baskets in the extra session. Majerle's 3-pointer gave the West the lead for good at 124- 123 and Barkley increased the advantage to 131-125 with 1 :28 left. Majerle sank two free throws to give the West a 133-127 lead but Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls cut the lead to three with a tough 3-pointer from the comer. Free throws by the West's David Robinson of San Antonio and the East's Scottie Pippen of Chicago closed out the scoring. The Eastern Conference forced the game into overtime on a 15-foot jumper by New York Knick center Patrick Ewing with 8 seconds left in regulation.

However, Maintenance and Campus Operations, as well as Trish Williams, Dean of Residence Life, have reported that, despite rumors among freshman, the situation is under control. There was a backup in the pipe lines on Monday or Tuesday last week. By Tuesday morning the problem had been addressed. Crosstalk ... cont. from page 1 Weintraub spoke about the positive aspects of the Greek system and how fraternities are not as damaging as people believe they are. Weintraub argued, unlike other Union students, Greeks learn the value of giving back to ~he community and sharmg themselves with the people that surround them. Weintraub believes that Greeks, more than independents, are forced to live with people who aren't similar to them. As a result of these living arrangements, Greeks learn how to make their lives more positive through communicati'ng with these individuals. Weintraub also stipulated that any lack of photo by Scott Steele Prof. Sorum at Crosstalk on community at Union. community was probably not manifested by the fraternities, but was most likely a result of students not being as friendly as they could be towards other students. Professor Hugh Jenkins talked about how the students, faculty. and members of the administration all had different reasons for the lack of community on campus. The administration. according to Jenkins, blames the fraternities, the students aren't sure who to blame. but are aware of the problem, and the faculty blamed themselves and the students. In order to improve the community at Union, Jenkins suggested that any discontented party \should not mourn, but should organize.\ Jenkins stressed how important activism was by concluding his Maintenance asked the Area Coordinators of West tQ notify the students oo limit their water usage until the problem could be identified. It was concluded that an ' object had obstructed the water flow, It has since been removed. Sewage leaked into the basement during the efforts to repair the pipes, and has been cleaned up. Students living in West should be aware that no charge will be assessed to them for the piping problem. ·In addition, maintenance be'lieves that students need not fear a reaccurance of the problem.

February 25, 1993, page 4 Facilitators Bring Issues :to Union by Adam Perlow Peer Facilitator Four years ago, some students and administrators met to discuss ways to address peer relationship issues here at Union. A Peer- to-Peer approach was considered to be most effective. Joanne Tobiessen, Director of the CDC, established· the group with Professor of Psychology, Ken DeBono. The goal of the Peer Facilitators is to facilitate discussion on many topics in order to promote acceptance of differences, awareness, and communication. in order to remove such devastating acts as date rape, racial insults, sexis~. and many other critical and relevant occurrences. The Peer Facilitators have put on workshops on Acquaintance Rape, AIDS , and Diversity. The Peers are not conducting programs to offer their own personal opinion during a workshop. Their goal is to facilitate discussion, run activities, and show videos to get students talking and thinking so that they may realize their ow11 prejudices and inappropriate actions. There are plans to continue to expand their programs. In April, the Peer Facilitators will sponsor and produce ·a series of pro~rams including speakers~ workshops, and an and acceptance may become more imp&rtant to everyone. There are eleven Peer Facili'tat<>rs. each of whom went thro11gh an intense three :part inteiView process. A diverse group, the Peer Facilitat~rs include African Americans,Whites, Latino's (Hispani-c), Catholics, Protestants, Jews, men and women. The members feel the group could be more diverse at~d include Asians, Muslims, and many other flroups and they hope that all interesteci and qualified students apply.

An alternative to this proposal would be a written justification of how current practices enable students to keep up with their schoolwork. Also discussed in the AAC recommendation was a letter the Dean of Faculty sent to the professors emphasizing that Greek rush activities are not regarded by the College as a reason to re-schedule work. These a.ctivities are not acceptable excuses for poor performance. A copy of the Dean's letter was sent to the Greek orga11izations. The AAC requested that the SAC report to the AAC by May 1 on the success of its discussions. The AAC further added that if the SAC fails to resolve the situation satisfac tori 1 y, the AA C will seek remedies through the faculty and administration.

Gunther described DuBois as \a black man on a white college campus,\ who supported the belief tbat the Talented Tenth, though small in size, yet large in faith, had the ability to change America. According to Gu11ther. it was the \leadership and momentum\ of DuBois that allowed him . to \pass the instructs students \to keep · runlling the race and not to just lead the race, but to pass the bat()J1 and to understand the depttb of our consciousness.\ GiuAther revealed a wonderful lr-----------. baton\ onto Dr. Woodson, the second African American to receive his Ph.D, in history from Harvard.

In the long-run, Hohenberg stressed the 11eed for deficit reduction, and he supports most of Clinton's deficit· reduction initiatives. Hohenberg believes that \it is okay to have modest, gradua1 deficit cutting.\ \The problem with the deficit is not that we are about to go broke, but if we extrapolate, we will get int<> untenable situations.\ Hohenberg is referring to the increasing burden of paying back the interest on the national debt.As a result of the debt interest payments, if the debt grows, but only at a small rate, Hohenberg does not believe that the country will become strapped for cash. The increase in taxes that will help to reduce the deficit will not create too many economic hardships, according to Hohenberg.

In addition, Americans will not have to pay extra gasoline taxes or value· added taxes.

Hohenberg believes that during the 70s and the 80s AmeFican children suffered because of .the increasing burden of taking care of the elderly. Special programs were established to ensure that the elderly were provided with adequate medical care and funding. and the increase in spending on the elderly directly effected the children. In addition to having to deal with these problems while cutting the deficit, Clinton must also recognize that many states are \tapped out [of money l and are in need of fiscal help.\ Tbis will create a problem, because providing states with additional money in the face of decreased govemrnen t spending will be difficult. The good news for the country is that currently, the burden of providing for the elderly falls on many working class people, the productivity of the economy is bound to improve (seeing as it hasn't yet benefited fmm the extensive use of computers), the peace dividend wiH enable more money to st3y in the United States, .and tile citizens of the country are more willing to make economic sacrifices now than they have been before.

The performance is opell to the public with no admissi<>n fee. The shado\w -puppet theater or wayang kulit is both popular entertainment and a mystical experience. Accompanied by the gamelan or thitty piece metallophone orchestra, the dalang puppeteer manipulates leather 'perforated, two foot taU puppets . representing charactered from Hindu epics. Princesses are rescued. demons conquered, and English speaking clowns interpret and crack jokes, All actions are timed to the gongs and drums of the garnelan, whose function is similar to that of a ballet or movie score. The evening's story~ \When the battle hero Arjuna sends his soul to heaven to bring the god Kresna out of slumber to repel the Kurawa brothers Gamelan orchestra is conducted by the kendang or barrel drum player. Pieces are fashioned to depict battles, nobility, love, humor, and other emotions. It is a many layered music with a bu:rden carried by the saron trough metallophones, punctuated by larger gongs and kettles, and elaborated upon by smaller, softer instruments. Debussy is said to have remarked, upon hearing a gamelan at the Paris Exhibi'lion, that Patestrina's . . counterpoint pales alongside it. At the same time. it is a \democratic\ music that permits novice·s to play alongside experts: hence its success at institutions such as Wesleyan University, whose gamelan will be perfonning on the 26TH. by Eric Budke, Coo.tributing writer Well tilanks to all tbe ten of you who came to see Ornar Saeed Quintet.

A lot of people who were involved in the discussion were more concerned with blaming Greek orsanizations for division among students than they were in answering the real questions. When will the student body of Union College become more diversified. and not a homogeneous bunch of followers? When will the administration provide viable social alternatives so that members of cliques with slightly different interests will expand their horizons and meet other members of the college community? When will the administration give more emphasis to academics and place less importance on athletics? It is hard to blame Greek organizations for the fact that Union students need, and are not discouraged by the administration, to spend time around people who are similar to them. The lack of racial, and cultural diversity on this campus is glaring. In-all fairness to the Admissions Office, they are limited in their ability to recruit students with varying backgrounds because the school is not renowned for its diversity. and few racial and ethnic minorities believe that they will benefit from attending an essentially homogeneous co1Iege. Students. in a'l effort to distinguish themselves in some way from their classmates. find it essential to either join an organization or form their own clique. Factions within homogeneous groups tend to be very competitive with each other, and sometimes respect comes only grudgingly. It is not surprising to hear about fraternity rivalries because students differentiate themselves through distinguishing their organizations. Most students do not distinguish themselves individually because it is always easier for an individual to associate with groups, and because the options to do so are not readily accessible. That being said, let us stop the Greek bashing. Many people accuse Greeks of being homogeneous, and not caring to know people outside of their organizations. Well, my fellow Union students, 'the apple don't fall far from the tree'. We are all this way. If we are really searching for community, it will only come when a majority of the campus feels a need for individual distinction, and when the administration decides to encourage activities that will truly bring students together. By placing more emphasis on academics the school may just force students to communicate and learn more about their classmates. Students. please distinguish yourselves individually this week, and talk to your peers about how you (on a personal level) believe Union can become a better place for all students. By all means, express your views in a Letter to the Editor. You may learn something about other students' feelings.

H. Fausty C()lltributing Writer Don't get me wrong. What follows is strictly my opinion. I would never dream of trying to sell my biased beliefs for objective fact. What I write is not truth. I have done a lot of feeling and thinking, though. I have certain strong ideas. I have ideas that are based on my own experiences and my own life. I've had experiences both as a member of a Greek organization on campus, and as an indepen4ent college student whose education does not represent, for him, just one important piece of paper, but whose piece o{ paper will represent one important piece of his education. I do not think that affiliation and independence are necessarily mutually exclusive: there are degrees of dependence. It is certainly possible to be an independent member of a society--as far as it is possible to be truly independent. (We all need people.) The issue of dependence is the one I will discuss here--and specifically, independence of thought. I've seen people who are blinded by their allegiances. It's like unquestioning · nationalism. It's like faith. People are unwilling to see the imperfections in their systems. or to acknowledge the inconsistencies in themselves. They feel compelled to defend and justify themselves and the organizations to which they belong, of which they are ~f part. Yet they are bound to remain ignorant of other points of view (which may be right), due to a general failure to let go of their own preconceived notions. Prejudice. Fear of being wrong. Never bothering to listen, even to themselves. People don't meet each other. We ask but we don't hear. We must learn to question our own ways of thinking, speaking, relating, and communicating with one another. We must think about power and em:po'Weiment. We need .somebody to be held 11ccountable for what's happeming. and it has to be the individuals. Fraternities are non-{lmtities, in a sense, because if we blame them, we're blaming amorphous groups.. They are by their very natue liquid, flowing, changillg--even just in tenns of active membership. We don't blam.e ·i11dividuals when we blame fraternities because no indi'\'idual can claim reslJ{)nsibility for what goes on in a fraternity. Who is acc.ou ntable? Who is respo11sible? The individuals. But ..vho are they? We suffer from an epidemic of tbe herd mentality syndrome. The collective mind makes the decisions, determines what is right and wron!J. Nobody has any choice. Once you're in, once you bec<>me a part 9( tl)~ system, you stop questioning the system. Your individuality and freedom die with your critical conscbus11ess. This is not good. We should question the system from withill. We have an important op~rtunity to see it from the . inside. 'B11t ;doll't be fooled into thinldJJg that people can't see the _fa.ults of the system from the o11tside just as well--or . maybe even better than you on the inside can. There's a general fear of looking. closely at tbe system. People d()n't want to make waves. The atmosphere is too conse1'ti'ative. Ctiange is met with llostility here. Criticism is met witll anger. Defensive name-calling often results. People ·don't criticize from the o11tside either, because they just d<>ri't want to be bothered. The number of student voices sp-eakimg out against the reignillg social system at Union College is incredibly low. Poo]Jie are far from satisfied, though .. They have enough problems trying to live alongside it, without becoming involv~d in challenging it. or raisirtg questions' about its present value to the college. I don't have time to write this article. I'm doing it anyway because I was inspired by some letters in Concordiensis written by Mirriam Seddiq and Amy Cypres, and a few letters written by.. other people-- mostly people who belong to Fraternities and Sororities. .Okay, Unio~. Here's the question for today's class: What is cognitive dissonance? If you kriow what it is. then you can try -to answer the second question: How do you avoid cognitive dissonance? You may know, you students of American higher education--but even if you don't, I won't spoon-feed you the answer. Find out for yourselves, if you care to know. If you're curious, look it up. Take your education into your own hands. If you don't care, then just forget about it. Keep doing as little as possible to get by. Maybe you'll just stick along for the ride. Maybe you can get a \B or even an \A \ 'th t ar· g Wh , WI OU C In .... y should Concordiensis be any different from class? I know there are people at Union College who do care about knowledge and learning. There are even a few who come here to read books and study. I'm not worried about offending them. What bothers me is that very few people around here seem to care about their academic wod::, or even their major courses of study. I do care a lot, because the anti-academic attitudes· .around here often get in the way of other people's learning. If you see or hear or read something that makes you uncomfortable, fills you with rage, strikes you as wrong, unfair, or offensive, then ask yourself why. Don't be afraid of the answer. Learn to love the questions. Self -awa!'eness. Continual process of learning about your self, an ever-changing entity. Emotions. Thoughts. Reason versus passion. Passionate reason. Passion is a reason. cont. on page 9 '

@JJ1tr.orhictt£iz 0 PINIONS February 25, 1993, page 9 IGNORANCE EQUALS BLISS by Amy Cypres Opinions Columnist Cliched or not, I'm starting this piece with a quotation. \Enlightenment consists not merely in the seeing of luminous shapes and visions, but in making .the darkness visible. The latter procedure is more difficult, and therefore unpopular\-Carl Jung. That seems to encompass it all, .. enlightenment versus ignorance. Recently it appears· that the latter is winning. Ignorance lurks among us. Like a tumor, it grows, multiplies and spreads its cancerous hatred. And like cancer it seems difficult, if not imjxlssible, to cure. This has Lack of Spirit To the Editor: This letter is addressing two issues on this campus. First, apathy, if you are not a fan of the word apathy we can use sheer laziness on the part of the majority of the student body. Second, the lack of commpnity among the students here on Union's campus. Last Friday there was a free concert held in Memorial Chapel. There was a turn out of ten students, some of which were members of the concert committee. This is pathetic. Three students volunteered their time to put on this event in effort to provide a social alternative for the campus community. I can't comprehend how students can complain that there is nothing on this campus to do. When all. event like this occurs, and you can count the turn out on . both hands, where is the justification for all of this complaining? This brings me to my second point, I attended the cross talk at Chet's ·last Thursday night. The topic of discussion was the lack of community here at Union. The majority of students in attendance blamed either the administration and/ or the Greek system. They are not to blame. SchooL spirit is not generated by the administration, it is generated by the students. Furthermore, fraternities and sororities are in themselves social alternatives. Whether or not they be desireable is another question entirely. Students need to realize the amount of power that they possess, if there is something you don't like, you have the power to change it. For example, if you are not pleased with the events held on campus in most cases the student body is welcome to served as the b~tckground .of many discussio11s between myself and my friends as of late, the frustratio11 ()f speaking your mind and Eimding only an echo to remind :yo11 that you're screaming into a. vacuum; a vacuum named l!Jnorance. {I note the run-oil s~ntence, but this is my artide.)

And I use my forum to discuss the larger issue at hand. activities organiz~tti;ons. The stu den tr; on this campus who complain are the same ones wiJo. don't get involved or atte11d campus events. I suggest that these students either gd i11volvedor call home and C.()mplain to mom and dad. I am sick and tired of hearillg all the whining and compiaining and seeing nothing dl»ne about it. There are enougllmctivities on this campus to keep everyone busy, and if there is a dub or activity that we d<lll't already have, you have tile: power to make it exist.

Positions are available as Orientation Advis()rs to people who want to make a difference at this institutioll.. The advisor is the key to a su..Ccessful and outstanding Orielltation. ·!This person conducts .md presents all the activities md events that greatly influence tbe class of 1997 at the stoot of their \Union Experiellce\. In addition to gai11in~ valuable experience in a le~~dership role, Orientation Advisors make new friends in a cohes::ive group of Union's finest ret-resentatives. Most importantly, the advisor Because in spite of tho~ who react in malice, I c;h()ose to continue to act in tbe hopes that someone might listen. I digress ... back to the letter. As I read it I became more and upset. I wanted t() run. I wanted ,to hide. I wanted it all to go away. But that's the goal of these terrorist-like actions. Fear and shame. Intimidation and personal attack. Anonymity, the defe11se of the weak. If I stop, then I dignify these actions, I credit them, I condone them. I prove their effectiveness. I won't. Visions of the K.K.K. flash before my eyes. Hooded individuals who llide the human faces .of fear, i~norance and hatred. Individuals who derive power frorn their anonymity. Tiley burn crosses. They spout a d hominems. They gather at LETTERS eases the students' transition to Union College by making them feel comfortable in their new home.

Applications for this prestigious position .can be found at the Dean of Students Office [CC 306] or at the College Center Information Booth. All applicatio11s must be submitted to the Dean of Students Office by Wednesday March 1Oth. So for a good time and lots of fun call 1-800- 0rientation Advisor. Sincerely, Joe Saltzbart Amie Lanzendmf Orientation Co-chair~ Unjust Timing of Town Meeting To the Editor: We are writing tllis in response to the unjust timing of the Town Meetin~ \Honor Code\. On behalf of the Black History M()nth Committee, we feel that the student forum's scheduling of the Town Meeting was insulting due to the fact that we have ltad a well known speaker f<lr Black History Month. plan11ed since mid-January for tile same day/time. Deborah Williams Mohammud was brought to Union College to educate the students and faculty on issues concerning Black an<l Latino relations. It was our understallding that the purpose of the Student Survival Guide was to avoid conflicts such as these. Do you see that we are so insignificant that we can be ove.rlooked? No wonder we have '110 \sense of community at Union College!\ Black Histo:ry Month Committee secret places and meet with other members of their exclu$ive society ·Of hatred. They ~~rive strength from their collective impotence. Never do these individuals discuss. Never do they attempt to establish a dialogue. Because these kinds of individuals cannot justify their behavior intellectually. So they attack. Behind the mask, fear can become power. Power used not to discuss an issue, but to vent unspoken hostilities. I can only wonder why it is that you hate me. I can only guess at the reasons why you choose to cloak yourself instead of owning up to your message. I can only conclude that it's because·you~re afraid, and you really don't want anything to change. You want to remain safely in the darkness, using terrorist-like tactics to intimidate the voices that invade your familiar univ-erse. So, ·an unsigned letter becomes a veiled thl;eat, a warning for me to watoll not only what .J say, but wh() I am. Like the infamous organization I have referred to earlie:r, you judge me because you are afraid to judge yourself. Rathel' than turn witllin, you aJ)point yourself my very own ju.<Jge, jury and executioner. You don't want to know me, because as a sagacious J:i'ie11<1 of mine says, you don't ltnow you. (Sound familiar?) As long as ig11orance and fear 'llides in the penciled scribbli11~s in my mailbox. you can co1uince yourself that you are .t:i.ght. Without a dialogue and confrontation your bravery and truth remains secure. :B11t for me cowardice and ignora.IIce is -.:ot bliss. Or is it?

FEATURES WHY I HATE AIRPLANES Erin M. O'Neil Features Editor I have been sitting in this ~tupi<li plane for over an hollf, waiting for it.to take off. Why ca11't it Just go? Fly, airplane! Fly! I'm annoyed, I'm claustrophobic, I just want to go heme! I have never once been om a plane trip that went off withcut a hitch. Not once. Thi_s le:ads me to the subject of this C()Jilpelling article- I hate ai:Iplanes, 1 hate everything about them. Since it does not appear as if I am ever getting off this one, I have plenty of tim~ t(ll tell you exactly Why. l ) 'fhey crash- I realize I co11ld be jinxing myself by saying this, but at this point. .. I jtLst d!on't care. Yes. I know, cars c:rash too. but there's sometliling about plummeting tens cf thousands of feet to a certain death that makes a plane crasll just that much less appealing. This is not to say that I1 find either option plll1ticu.larly appealing, but.. .. okay,. I'll shut up. 2) Those stupid \how to fasten your seat belt\ demollstrations- A person must have the intelligence of a pea if tlley\ cannot figure this out for themselves. Such a pers()n ·should probably not be travdi11g anywhere alone while suffe:rhng from such acute incomJJCtence. Not only that, but wby does this oh -so- complicated demonstration take two attetldants to execute? Do these people not possess enough coordination to operate the se:at belt and speak? Furthermore, I can not count the number of times I have been on a plane, and not once have I paid any attention to what the flight attendant is saying. From what I can see, neither does anyone else. I have never quite grasped the concept of· how my seat cushion dcmbles as a flotation device. I definitely do not draw a -lot of comfort from the fact that I will have a piece of foam rubber to cling to in shark- infested waters. Call me crazy, but... 3) The .food- Looks tasty, but no thanks. You've got to wonder about the freshness of an omelet that has been sitting in one of those little metal carts for God knows how long. And Salisbury steak for dinner? What exactly is Salisbury steak? And why is it never served anywhere but in airplanes and T.V. dinners? I think I'll just take some peanuts. 4) Flight attendants- Actually. most flight attendants are friendly, but somehow I always end up with the not .. so-friendly one. Take today, for example. I'm sitting in the front row of seats, thus there are no seats in front of me, thus there is no place for me to store my two properly sized and shaped carry~on items. I did, however, notice some space under another chair- but no. My pleasant flight attendant insisted that I check my miniscule bags- losing them in the process. Well thank you! Something tells me that in case of an emergency, one backpack is not going to be a big hindrance to my ·getting to the big inflatable slide. I've always been curious about that slide- has any()ne really seen it? Alld anothel' tiling- why does your seat hack have to be in its upright, and locked position at take-of.f and landing? What difference ~oes it make?! 5) Bat.brooms- Now, I do not consider myself to be an especially large person. and I can barely fit into one. What about the portly members of society~ How do they get into the lavat()IY a shoehorn? And who is the idiot they are always reminding not to tamper with the smok:e detecto:rs 111 there? Oh, I thillk I'll just rip this smoke detector off the wall- and then I ca.n smoke a butti Who is this desperate? Get the patch! And where does all the \waste\ go? Maybe it~s better I didn't know. 6) In-t'ligh.t magazines- Wllo reads tllesei Who writes these? They SllCl<! 7) Tmblllence· \Folks. we!J.-e going to be hitting a few roug11 spots over the next hundred miles. Just remain seated witll your seat belt securely fastened.\ Yeah, okay buddy! Why ·do11't you just tell tile truth- \We're going to l>e bumping you all over the place, we may even crash, but I'm not sure, so I'll just sa.:y we've hit a few air pockets so you W()n't ~tart screaming.\ If I'm goi11g to crash, I wish he'd just tell me so I could enj<>y my last few moments of life. Seve11 !lours later, and I'rn about to tc>nch down in scenic Albany. I feel lucky to have survived. WRI1,E FOR FEATURES!!

I ·February 25,1993,page 11 JU'ST A FEW PET PEEVES Alexis Leist Features Writer There ate some things that I can tolerate, and then there are some things that absolutely drive me nuts. These \pet peeves:• can make me crazy, and I'll :blow up at the most inopportune time. I can't stand when people don't call back! After all the effort it took to call them (depending on the situation) they don't even have the decency to return a simple phone call! Is it really so hard to dial four little numbers! I love this one too, when I pass someone by and I say hi, not because I know them but because I have happened to make eye contact, and they don't say hi back. How humiliating! It's even more humiliating when l'm with a group of friends and the person does not respond. Then I have to hear \You were dissed\ for the rest of the day! Sometimes just the littlest things will make me so angry. Like when I'm in a movie, and right liefore the movie starts there is always a pause of thirty seconds; it is completely dark, and all I hear is people munching on their popcorn. Talk aboutannoying! Or when I'm watching a movie and the person next to me has to ask my whole life story. or reveal the movie's plot, or enlighten me with ~their deep insights on life (What are you wearing tomorrow?) And then I feel guilty saying \sh!\ because I feel bad when people cut me off in the middle of what I'm saying (which is pretty often). Let's talk about the phone. First of all. how many times have I forgotten my long- distance code? I think by now it is so embedded in my brain that it has replaced my social security number! And why is it more expensive to make a long-distance call in New York State than to call, oh let's say Vermont? This makes absolutely- no sense to me. But what's really annoying is when I call someone and I get that stupid beep (or as the commercial puts it, a gentle tone) which tells me the person I'm calling is on the phone with someone else. How about the efficiency of our call- waiting system? Someone will call me and I'll be on the phone (th.ey'll hear the beep), but I'll hear a ring and I will try to get it, but by the time I've finished pressing all the buttons they have hung up! And then I'll have to deal with that man who says \Enter Enter\ or sometimes he says \Tone Tcne\ (or something like that). I wish he was a real person so I could tell him what I think of .this phone system! Why can't it work like it does at home, where all you have to do is press the receiver? God forbid there was a real emergency, who would ever know? But enough about the phone, altbougll I could probably go on for days. I hate when I'm in class (or even when I'm in my room) and I fall asleep for maybe two minutes, and then I'll wake up really quickly because I think it has been two hours or could apply the same memorization processes to schoolwork they'd be set.

Everyone said it's so cold~ you never want to go out a.r1d people are in bad moods. Now that I'm experiencing winter term I realized it's not fair to blame the sadness on the cold, snowy weather. Unicn's campus is beautiful, all year round. In the winter I think it's .prettier than all the other settsons. Now that the ground, the buildings and the Nott are covered with a white blanket, it looks so much brighter! Personally, I haven't seen this much snow in a long time, but' instead of thinking abut cold, I fell warmer a~ ~ look at it! l The s11ow brings silence. It allows :you to think about so many tbings. I don't mean thinking about the exam you think YQII failed, or the paper you have to write, or even about what your going to do all weekend. You can think about beauty and happiness.

I heard the man say \Clarkstown Central School District closed today\ (Obviously, that's my school district in Rockland County, NY.) On those days I would jump out of my bed, so excited to call my friend Sandy who lives up the block. Even at eight in the morning, on snow days I always seemed more awake. I would put on layers of clothing and walk up the block with my red saucer sled. It never mattered how hard it was snowing! I never would wear the hat my dad yelled at me to wear so my ears were always numb, but when you're a kid you can handle anything. We would then go sledding. There is a huge hill on the side of her house to sled down. We would sled for hours and hours. After sledding we would make a snowman in front of her house. Eventually we would go inside and drink some hot chocolate. It was always the greatest day! Whenever it would snow at night I always loved sitting in the living room watching the snow fall. My father would always light the fire in the fireplace. He would then smoke a pipe and we would all sit ·and watch television. It with happy winter 111,emoiies.

February 25,1993, page 11 JU'ST A FEW PET PEEVES Alexis LEist Featttre.sWriter There are some tllings that I can tolerate, and then there are some things th:at absolutely drive me rn.1ts. These \pet peeves:' can ma:ke me crazy, and I'll blow up at the most inopportune time. I can't stand when people dmn't call hack! After all the eff<Ort it took to can them (depending on the situation) they don't even have the decency to return a simple phone call! Is i tJreaUy so hard to dial four little numbers! I love this one too., when I pass someone by and I say hi, not because I kno\W them but because I have happened to make eye conttuct, and they don't say hi back. How humiliating! It\s even more humiliating when I'm with a group of friends and !he person does not respond_ Then I have to hear \You we:re dissed\ for the rest of the day-! Sometimes just the littlest things will make me so angry. Like when I'm in a movie. and right oefore the movie starts there is always a pause of thirty seconds; it is completely dark. and all I hear is people munching on tlle:ir popcorn. Talk about all1loyiag1 Or when I'm watching a movie and the person next to me has to ask my whole life story. or reveal the movie's plot,.. or enlighten me with their deep insights on life (What are you wearing tomorrow?) An.<J then I feel guilty saying \shl ·• because I feel bad when poeople cut me off in the middle of what I'm saying (which is pretty often). Let's talk abo11t the phone. First of all. hoVI many times have I forgotte:n my long- distance code? I tllink by now it is so embeddeci in my brain that it has replacoed my social security number! And why is it more expensiv-e to make a long-distance call in New Y ark State than to call, oh let's say Vermont? This makes absolutely\ no se.nse to me. But what's really annoying is when I call some01ne and I get that stupid bee:p (or as the commercial puts it, a gentle tone) which tells me the person I'm calling is on the phone with someone else. How about the efficiency of our call- waiting system? Someone will call me a11d I'll be on the phone (they'll hear the beep), but I'll hear a rin~ and I will try to get it, but !by the time I've finished pressing all the buttons they ha~e flung upl And then I'll have lo tleal with that man who s!lys \Enter Enter\ or sometiooes he says \Tone. Tone\ (or something like that). I wish he was a real person so I could te:U him what I think of this pha.ne system! Why can •t it work like it does at home. where all you have to do is press the receiver? God forbid there was a real emergeflcy, who would ever know? But enough about the phone, although I could probably go on for days. I hate when I'm in class (or even when I'm in my room) and I fall asleep for maybe two minutes, and then I'll wake up really quickly because I think it has been two hours or could apply the same memorization processes iO schoolwork they'd be set.

Coach Bassett will remain the head swim coach of both the men's and women's swim teams, ~ well as Aquatic director, but will assume her new position starting Spring term.

Bassett led the Union women to Union's only state championship in 1989-90 after finishing a perfect 9-0 during the season. The women's team has finished 3rd in the state meet in the past 2 seasons, and second th.i; season. Bassett also took over the men's swimming y>rogram five years ago and has. compiled a record of 28-16. The men's swim team was 5-3 this season. The Dutchmelll have finished 11th, 5th and 3rd in the last three seasons at the New York State Meet.

She will assume her new duties tbe flrst week of April. SWIMMING cont. from page 16 OK- I know that was a lot of information. But thafs because there were so many marvelous achievements at the meet- none of which could be left out. And. I had to give credit where credit was due. To top it all off, Coach Susan Bassett was named Coach of the Year in the coach's poll. When I asked Coach Bassett about the meet, she said, \1 couldn't be happier about their performance. We swam a total team effort. It was- well, just incredil:llet\ Well said, coach. This weekend the men will try to C()mtinue the Union Swimmilllg Dutch.men success as they colllpete at their state champions:hips at Rochester.

' i 'I ·ClloJICOf biru.nin ByHalPoret Co SpfJr.ts Editor This week's Union College Athletes of tile Week are the Union women swimmers, who ])laced ·second last week in the New York State meet held at Hamilton College. The dutchwomen swam very impressively, finishing only behind perellnial champion Ithaca. Coacll Susan Bassett, who was named \coach of the year\ by her peers. was thrilled with the team's ,performance. \'We got solid performances from top to bottom, and every single one of our athletes scored, which is incr~dible,\ said Coach Bassett. The Dutchwomen managed to set 11 meet rec()rds, 15 Union College records, and qualified seven swimmers to swim at the Division III National Championships. Senior Julie Benker set meet records of :27.12 in the 50m backstroke, :58.14 in tllelOOm backstroke and ''Bonds cont. from ,prage 14 both. Not only does he get the 6 year security, but in 2 years when he is still making $7.1 miDi on a year llllder his current contract, and some other player is making $8 million, he will holdout for renegotiation of his contract. And the Giants will be forced to raise his contract to $8 million because they need Bonds on the field. Any economist or any baseball fan with common sense will agree that this large scale salary escalation is leading baseball full speed into a :brick wall. Many teams just don't have the ·money to pay the top players anymore, and as a result the rich teams buy victories and the poor teams lose. The Pittsburgh Pirates have won the NL East two seasons in a row. but because of where they- play, they don't h~ve a big cable TV contract a11d they don't make much money .. As a result in 2 years we have witnesses the c()mplete decimation of the Pirate team. They have now lost Bobby Bonilla and Barry Bonds, their two big hitters. Tltey have lost Doug Drabek and Smiley, tb.eir two best pitchers. They even lost Jose Lind because they could not afford to pay him $2 million a year. So in effect, the Pirates have lost their team. Other teams like the Seattle Mariners, Cleveiand bdians. and Minnesota Twins have the same problems. When I was a kid, I knew the starting lineup on every team in baseball. N()w I have to read the paper every day just to know half of the:n1 because of how fast pl~yers are shuffled around the league. And when the big baseball cable contracts run out 2:08.10 in the 200m backstroke, qualifying her for nationals in th:ese 3 events. Benker will also be swimming on 4 relay teams at nationals. Junior Kelly Bevan qualified with meet records. of 1:07.38 in the 1OOm breaststroke and 2:26.97 in. the 200m breaststroke. and will also be part of 4 Union. relay teams at nationals. Kristen Holbrook will also be heading for nationals for ~1 and 3 meter diving. Junior Jen Baldwin, who along witb Benker, Bevan and Meade set a meet record of 1:48.15 in the 200m medley relay, will be going to nationals for tllis event. Junior, Tasha Zabka sllone for the dutchwomen taking first in the 3m diving with 0376.05 and second. in lm diving with a 352.60. Though she did not qualify for Nationals, she was named the meet's.~'Outstanding Diver\ for the second year in a row. Three fresb.man swimmers also put in impressive performances which will send SPORTS them to nationals. Freshman Jennifer Allaire set meet records of 1:00.91 in the 100m Individual Medley, 2: 11.69 in the 200m IM and 4:51.56 in the 400 IM. Allaire will be competing in the 200m and 400m IM and on 4 Union relay teams. Freshman Jonatha Meade will be swimming in the 50m freestyle and on 5 relay teams ,including the 200m and 400m Medley relays in which she helped the Union teams to meet records. Freshman Eri Hayashi swam very well in the 200m and 400in free relays, and will be heading for nationals in these events as ·well as tbe BOOm freestyle relay. Last season, Union placed lOth at the NCAA meet with a school record 117 points. Five dutchwomen came away with All-American honors and seven won honorable mention. The seven women qualifiers will represent Union at the NCAA meet which will take place at Emory College on the weekend of March 1l to 13. Good luck to all competing!

Unfortunately, the most noble act in baseball this year was Kirby Puckett signing with his own team~ the Twins, for a mere $5 million a year, when he probably could have got $7 million elsewhere. There is no team loyalty left, . and by following the course that free agency has taken baseball, it is n<Jw officially a business instead of a game. The big strus like Bonds must be focused on because the problem is spreading to other sports. Football is on the verge of falling into the trap that has caught baseball. with their new free agency plan. Bl!.sketball players are already turning into vicious money-grubbers. Jimmy Jackson, who was drafted 4th this year by the Dallas Mavericks has held out the entire season because he wants to be paid more than the player drafted .Sth. Jackson was a good college player who has never shown the ability to lead a team or come through in the clutch moments.

Since it is too late to bring back the type of player who plays for the love of the sport instead of the money, it is up to the fans to stop paying for these ridiculous salaries. If we don't pay for the cable contracts and if we don't spend $15 dollars for a ticket, $4 dollars for a beer or hot dog, and $20 dollars fort-shirts, the owners would be forced to control the insane greed which has engulfed- baseball. Obviously it is not Bonds' fault that this problem exists. But he is the best player in baseball, and along with that status, he inherits the position of role model to millions of children and that is a great responsibility. What he is showing to baseball fans is disgusting. I am just thankful that there are only a few months between the end of hockey and basketball seasons, and the start of football, because to me, the sport of baseball as a game is dead.
