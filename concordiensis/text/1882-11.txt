APPLE-BLOSSOMS. BY HORATIO NELSON POWERS. The apple-trees with bloom are all aglow- Soft drifts of perfumed light- A mirade of mingled fire and snow- A lat1gh of Spring's delight ! Their ranks of creamy splendor pillow deep The valley's pure repose ; On mossy walls, in meadow nooks, they heap Surges of frosted rose. · Around old homesteads, clustering thick they shed Their sweets to murm'ring bees, And o'er hushed lanes anj way-side fountains spread Their picture.l canopies. Green~breasted knolls and forest edges wear Their beautiful array ; And lonesome graves are sheltered, here <.t nd there With_ their memorial spray. · ' The efflorescence on unnumbrred boughs Pants with delicious breath ; O'er me seem laughing eyes and fair, smooth brows, · And shapes too sweet for death. Clusters of dimpled faces float between The 5oft, caressing plumes, Anrl lovely creatures 'mong the branches lean Lulled by faint, flower-born tunes. ' A rude wind blows, and, as the blos.soms fall My heart is borne away; ' Fainter and fainter tender voices call ·of my enamored May. Fainter and fainter--oh, how strange it seems vVith so much sweetness fled ! ' I go like one who dreams within his dreams That, living, he is dead ! .

NOTCHING TREES. ~-:-:::> 'I ATHER, said a young man, who ·~ 'I \ .- . ~- · had just entered college, to an aged 1ninister of whon1 he .had been asking counsel in reference to various points of duty, ''do you think it best for young men who have tbe n1inistry in view,. or indeed an v of the learned _, professions, to be engaged matri mo- nially before :having eon1pleted their course of study ? \ \ vVe11, n1 y son,\ said the old gentlen1an, running his fingers through his silvery hair, as his thoughts flew backward to the experience of his early days,·'· as a general thing I do not think it is. for such bonds are liable to bind the n1ind as well as the heart, and one's attention is apt to be distracted, his thoughts engrossed in the contenl- plation of the good and beautiful one, rather than concentrated with un- one that is to your eye tl:c loveliest ot all.\ Let us look for a n1o1nent at the efficiency of this notching process. I see you are strolling- in the. cool of the morning. In your wander~ngs you approach a pleasant stream ; its banks are lined with vvillo\VS. I-lo\v very de- lightful it is; you sit upon its banks and drink in its limpid beauty. Sud- denly the ad vice of your aged guard- ian flits across your 111 in d. Those silver leaves shimn1ering in the sun- 1 ig,h t are lovely ; those pliant, bend- / ing branches, which the little strearn half rises to kiss, how very· beautiful and graceful tb ey are! 1'h e.re is a strange {ascination about·~hat willow; you think it a very ''nonpareil\ among all the trees of your life-\vood, and thus you conclude that you can conscientiously notch it. \Nith many a lingering look you wend your way back to your studies. .t\gajn, at the heat of noontide, on wavering zeal upon the 1nysteries of an errand of charity. you are gojng Hebrew lore, or the intricacies of legal disquisition. It is better to follow the example of the pioneer, and notch the trees you like in going through the wood, and by and by, when you have finished your studies, when your 'convenient season' has come, retrace your steps, and choose from among your 12otched trees, the across a wide plain, to reach that hun1ble cabin, where stately and ' beautiful, spreading its queenly crest against tb e sky, a lovely eln1 affords a kindly screen frorn the burning sun. There's a thrill at your heart ... as for a 1no.ment you enjoy the re- freshing coolness. As you retire fron1 that peaceful scene you hear music in those branches ; you listen and vich .I note thcr bavi anoi A dov .. list1 ~om old bre( that sp1r the n1aJ o-}o' ~ thn ing bra dou 'I'b( by eltr the ad tio1 tre, ag( yot ch;: ho] COl th<: far

THE COl-~CCRDlENSlS. 27 ------------ ---------·---- and ling( r ; yea, you go back, and vicld in g to the cb artns of . beauty, .I notch the eln1 deeply and plainly, then take again your l!ome\vard way, having- stan1ped upon your n1en1ory an otber lesson fro1n nature. Again, weary of study, you throw down JOUr boo:zs; heart-heavy and listless you take your way through ~orne quiet lane out into the \grand 1 '' . h' c old WO{i( S, Slg · 111g 10r S0111C S\Veet, breezy co1npanionship to bear away that unbidden weight from your ·spirit. You are glancing out through the dim, old forest, toward that n1ajcstic oak yonder. '\[he early glo\v of of sunset g1imtners clown through its glossy leaves; the even- ing breeze· plays lightly among its branches; you stroll thitherward, no doubt thinking of that \arboretun1.'' 'I'be spell woven around your lH:art by the lovely willo\v ancl gi~aceful eltn, is fast losing its witchery be1ore the majesty of tbis sturdy oak. What a dl:n~e shadow! What fair propor- tions! So havi.ng notched this noble tree JOU go away, singing of the '\ oak, the brave old oak.\ Tln.1s you pass on in your pilgrin1- age. Al0ng l i; e's n1oun tain track you \iVCnd your lonely way. vVhat chasms you find to be spanned by hope! What avalanches of danger con1c crushing do\vn upon you! But there is a rest for you yonder. Not far up the n;ountain, a stately pine, lonely and desolate, straight and spire-like, lifts itself proudly against the sky. Listening to its ·'plaintive song you sit down beneath it; you ·watch the quiver of 1ts rnyriad fingers and let th en1 fold caressing! y around your heart. Willing, or unconcious you sit there in reverie, musing of the beautiful pine, ever green and glorious, even amid the frost work work and crystals of winter, and with memory's knife you make a few quick, sharp incisions, then take your way down the mountain. So pass your youthful years away. Well, you are ready to go again into the \voods, to see which of your notched trees most, nearly personates your \beau ideal.\ You stroll to the brookside, where the willow of your early fancy grew ; but you look in vain, it is not there. Some one else has carried it away to grace in its wavy, silvery beauty another \ar- boretuin \ than yours. As you look at the still fresh earth that was once guardin.g the roots of wh·at might ha\re been your willow, you can only say alas! alas! You take your way across the plain to the cottage, and again look for the overshadowing elrn. It is there, but in' its towering beauty it tempted the flash of the lightning, and blight- ed and brown its yet clinging leayes • sway in the sum1ner air.

Such are the disappoint- ments of life you say., with a sigh as you turn away fron1 th~ smitten tree, thinking of the grassy knoll and the proud oak. Surely it must be stiH flourishing, strong and fair. Btlt as you near it you catch the echo of the woodman's axe, and see his sturdy strokes cleaving the heart of your I oved oak. With an aching heart you question the stalwart forester's rig11t to lay low the pride of the forest ; but, my friend, what right ba ve you to interfere? )'Our notch- ings are all grown over. At last you n1ake your \vay silently up the mountain. Even the refresh- ing atmosphere of the \everlasting hills \ cannot cheeL You think, if my pine, 1ny lovely pine, has fallen too, what shall I do for an '' arbore- tum?\ Hither and thithe~· you turn your \Veary feet and at length descry beneath a descending avalanche the still green branches of your· long- sotlght pine, dead--plucked up by the roots. Tbcn the thought con1es to you bitterly, oh! if I had watched and tended it ; if I had sheltered it from the rough blasts and descent of avalanche; if I bad transplanted it to a more genial soil, it might still I have been towering to the· blue heaven, yonder. · Methinks I see you starting in on another jo{lrney through the old \vood. Eagerly you press on, not a sigh nor···a ·sound escapes you. By and by you come to a tree that ap- proximates in many respects to the beauty of your fa!len favorites of by- gone years. Wi1l you dally now-· just notch it and go hence to let an- other appropriate it; will you leave it exposed to the scorching beat~ or winter storn1, if it is possible for you to shelter it? I trow not. Carefully will you fence it in, loosen the earth about its roots and give it, if possible, just enough sun and shade ; earnest, ly will you pray for showers to water and dews to refresh it; cheerfully will you rest at weary noontide in its refreshing shadow. With this experience, and many have felt as bitter, who· would bid any go a-notching through the woods? vVould it not be better to follow, and find such a one, and tell .. him some passages of life's mistaken doiugs, would it not be kinder to bid him mark oue tree that is fair and lovely; mark it indelibly, put all sorts of good stakes about it, study its peculiar characteristics, cherish it with a genial culture and a kindly care, that in his ti1ne of need there shall be for hi n1 a presence of beauty to gladden the way of his life, and lift his thoughts to the Tree that grows beside living waters In the Paradise above.

( . ~...- ~HE custom of leaving the pro- f~ auction of the coLlege paper en- tirely to the editors is not in vogue in other colleges as largely as here. We see son1e of our cotemporaries give directions as to the .kind of matter wanted. No such ·advice is necessary in our case. We are thankful for the assistance received, but \Vish it were entirely voluntary. The character of the paper would be n1uch nearer the ideal if the students would accept the opportunity it presents for literary work and the paper would be 1nuch fresher than where the work is left entirely to the board. Just at present our funny man is off duty and vve would be glad to fill his place. tfl'- ~@HE first meeting of the Senate (.J!3. passed sn~oo~hly enough.

~ I 30· THE CONCORDIENSIS .. fro n1 i n c x t ric able n1 es h of motions, points of order, appeals, &c. Much confusion m:ight have been saved, bad the n1embcrs of '83 vis- ited the S-enate last year. We would not advise anyone to pay their re-- spects at present, but when exper- ience shall have taught a lesson or more it would be well for under- classmen to learn by observation. The plan of calling a student to preside is a first-rate one and must oceasion much· study of the manual that otherwise could be deferred. ExperiencAe is sometimes the best teacher. (?._-'r>-; ~O~BT~ESS, the benefits and ~ evds of the dormitory system make a long list \Vithout wandering into the realm of itnagination or ir- relevancy. Much may be said in its favor, but at present, one evil disturbs the dwellers in the lower rooms of which we are con1pelled to speak. It is no pleasant experience in re- ply to the call lzeads out to receive a salute of water, yet anyone can learn to take a joke. It is quite a differ- ent matter, however, to have ashes and in1pure water thrown from the upper windows. We dislike to men- tion the fact but necessity con1pels. The act is due to thoughtlessness· and we trust that hereafter no one will be so inconsiderate of the wei- fare of others. A servant performs a daily round with more or le~s dil- igence, and if the \VOrk is not done as it should be, do not n1ake a bad rnatter worse. ~/) MONG the n1any peculiar laws '/ ~ \., of New York is one which virtually disfranchises students. The law provides that \no one shaH gain or lose a residence while at school.)) To the n1ajority t.his means loss of the highest privilege of citizens. It is said they mav vote in their - J native place. But fe·w can afford the expense of that course. Why should the student be debCJrred the privileges others enjoy? vVhy not choose his residence as others do ? The mechanic gains a residence while learning a trade. A residence of one year in the State, six n1onths in the county and three days in the election district makes any citizen, except a student, a voter. It is no argun1ent that a student is supported by funds fron1 another place. The same \vould apply to many a prodigal living on the pater- nal ducats. If the tin~e be spent loafing at the cornf·r grocery or at the pool table he may go to the pol1s and vote unchallenged. Is the stu- dent n1ore unworthy than a common loafer ? Someone may claim that students are not interested in politics. when at s like affa tha,1 mat citi: ly r the A war den . res I that as t rest Ru~ ern1 the citi2 th~, .)

The in- mates .of the Soldier's Home acquire citizenship in Bath though they on- ly ren1~in at the ''Home\ riuring the inclement winter 1nonths. Are students less reliable that tltese n1oral and physical wrecks of war? There is no reason why stu- dents should not gain and lose their residence as others do. We believe that the student is fully as reliable as the average person and needs no restriction in this State, whatever Russian student n1ay need. Furth- ern1ore, \ve think that students of the Empire State would be better citizens if they vverc in tercsted where they residl', instead oC being pilgrin1s (:nd stra~1gers in the land. ,) ._ \i ~1~, ECTURE COURSE. -The :h.~-, suggestiou has been n1ad~e that the Seniors undertake a lecture course to meet tbe expenses incident on grad nation. The idea seems entirely feasible. A lecture course in Dorp would be a novelty to the present generq.tion. It should be thoroughly popular, as anything e1se would be a financial failure. We believe that men whos~e nan1es \vould epsure a large audience could be secured by the Seniors at as reas- onable rates as by ariy one. The course might be sandwiched with a concert or reading, which are always popular. A good lecture course would be a financial success, but, as an educator, would be of 1nuch greater value. P~'-· J HE desire for prosperity and ;-~ ~ improvement has beca1ne an ardent and restless passion among the members of the Junior class. Not being satisfied with the duties in1posed upon them they have una- n i1nousl y agreed to organize a body called the House of Representatives, vvhich shall be conducted in a man- ner similar to our national legislative body. 'The object of this moven1ent . can readil v be seen. It enables those ..1 parl:icipating to becotne familiar with the sy;stem of a legislative-body which ·is recognized by the world, as sec- ond to none. Also to acquire a thorough knowledge of parliamentary r~lles and that formality which is so necessary in any organized . body. '1-.o successfully manage this will re- quire close attention and careful reading. It will necess1 tate the per- . usal of congressional records which will be an unlimited source of in- forn1ations, acquired only by diligent labor. Our opportunities for in1- proven1ent in oratory a:~e limited

and the existence of this feature will supply that which we have long needed. 'fhis new project ought to be looked upon with favor and en- couraged and supported by all. ~ ccording to the Star of the II th ~ i nst., prizes are to be offered for the \best room\ and the \best kept room.\ We sincerely hope the plan pro- ceeded fron1 the fertile brain of the \Star'' correspondent. Certainly no- thing in the price line could be more . injudicious, As well offer a pr£ze to the Freshman who chews the 1nost gum, or the man who plays the best game of billiards. The idea of re- warding a man because he can afford an expensive room is sin1ply ridicu- lous. Better give the money to sorr1e who cannot afford the necessaries of life. As to the best kept room, we think, if the object be to promote cleanli- ness, the money would be more ef- fectual, spent in bribing the \janitress- es\ to clean the halls and stairs, if sanitary measures in general be sought, let the money be spent in' making the atn1osphere of the rear yards 1nore salubrious and the out- look n1ore .agreeable. Dorwin, of '86, was badly burt while playing foot ball. ~lis collar bone was fractured and caused hin1 n1uc l~ pain. This is the first accident that has occurred while playing foot . baH, although there has been son1e • pretty rot1gh scrin1n1ages. In a game of base ball played No- vember Ist, the Sophornorcs ~\'ere defeated by a nine chosen from the remaining three classes. The fol- lowing is the score by innings: Sopho1nores, College, I 2 3 4 5 I, I 2 0 I-5 2 0 I 2 2-7 It ·was very cold and on this ac- count the playing was rather poor, though some good batting was done, two base_ hits being made by McEl- wain, Neagle and Fletch cr. During four innings McCauley pitched and Anable caught for the Sophomores. Delaney had his hand sever~ly in- jured in catching a ball.on first base. Union should no\v arrange for son1e games in foot ball between some other colleges. We have had son1e time for practice and we should not let tbe season pass by without one victory for Union, or at least a game. We would like to see some of the old sports renewed. It is some time since the different classes tested their strength and skill in such games as the tug of war, foot racing, &c. The The gen, wou ther A ser\ thei nea Maj th01 .

~ ---------- These sports should be kept up. They would not only add. to the general health of the students but would create more class _ spirit in them. As the Juniors retired from active service in drill the Freshmen took their station in the field and filled, as, near as possible, the deserted ranks. Major McMurray bas then1 now in a thoroughly organized company and is vigorously driving tac(k)tics into them. They do not seem to appre- ciate the kindness of the Major in drilling then1 through the whole hour. Chas. Van Deveer has obtained a pleasant and lucrative position in the gymnasium at Oneonta. We congratulate the young men of that place in obtaining such an one as as \Vandy '' and we also wish him all success in his new position. Dan Addison, '83, is to take ''Van- dy's place. He is one of Union's best athletes and a better choice could not be made. We are sorrv to see that as the \ interest in foot ball increases the in- terest in base ball decreases. The two games should not conflict in this way. The campti'S should pe de- voted to foot ball one day and to base ball the next and then both 'would have an equal chance to prac- tice. -----------------. -- -------~-- ~-We acknowledge the receipt of the following exchange : Argo, Rut- gers, Targzun, Madz'sonens-is, Trinity, .Tablet, The Student, Acta Colum- biana, Bates Student, Chronicle, Dart- 1Jtoutlz, 1\i.,-ortlz- TVcstertz, Notre Dame Scholastic, College ltfercury, Sunbea1n, l¥illia1n's Athenceu1n, Hobart Herald, Rochester Ca1·npus, Vassar .llliscella~ty, University MagaziJZe, Syracusian, ]Jrinceton, College Argus, Occident and Harvard Advocate. -The College Mercury, has an ar- ticle entitled, \College supersti- tions,\ which is is full of good com- n1on sense. \ Pertinax\ need not appologizc for such effusions, but give us more of the_same. -An editorial in the Acta Colum- biaJza gives good advice to the Freshmen.
