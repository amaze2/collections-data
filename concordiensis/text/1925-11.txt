Union Triad Founded Greek Fraternities The Kappa Alpha Society is the oldest secret brotherhood of a social and literary character which has had a continuous existence in American colleges. Special interest is attached' to the circumstances of its foundation as this fraternity is the parent of .the present vast system of Greek letter societies. The creation of Ketppa Alpha 1s due to the inspiration of John Hart •Hun- ter, Thomas Hun, at1'1 1 saac W. Jack- 1 son, of the class of 1826 at Union College, who conceived the idea of a new secret society of a literary and I socia.l order and .interested several of their classmates 111 the plan. 1 In No- vember, 1825, the first initiation was • held and from that time on the organ-~ ization has flourished despite strong o.pposition in the early years of its history. Sigma Phi was founded at Union in ~larch, 1827, forming the second of that group known as the Union Triad. This society was the first to establish a· branch chapter in another college. Delta Phi, the third member of. the ' Triad, .as well as third in order of I establishment of AmNican colltoge fra, ; ternities, came into existence in the I fall of 1827. 1 The new societies after a few years ! met with opposition from the college I f • 1 faculty. The defense of the raterm- 1 ties was taken up by Delta Phi, and 1 John Jay Hyde of the class of. 1834, · as spokesman, presented the case he- ! fore the faculty and trustees. He stat- 1 cd the aims and objects of the fraterni- ties so well that the college authorities 'j were convinced that the coHtirtuance t'>f the societies then in existence would I i he beneficial to Union.

Starting Power Plant • The General Ei..:ctric .Company has developed generating and transmitting equipment step by step with the demand for clectricpower. Alre&d~relectric­ ity at 22(),000 volts is trans- r:ritted over a distance of 270 miles. And G-E engineers, cvlr looking forward, a·re now experimenting wlth voltages exceeding a million. A new series of G-E advertise- ments sho·.ving what electricity is doing in many fields will be sent on request; Ask for booklet GEK-1. Da.v\1n-the slumbering city awakens and ca:lls for electric current. Many miles away the calt is answered. A penstock opens automatically, releas- ing impounded waters; a water turbine goes to work, driving a generator; and electric current is soon flowing through wires over the many miles to the city. This plant starts and runs itself . Power plants with automatic control are now installed on isolated mountain streams. Starting and stopping, generating to a set capacity, shut- ting down for hot bearings and winaings, gauging available water supply, they run themselves with uncanny precision. Thus another milestone has been reached in the generation of electric power. And with present-day achievements in power transmission, electricity generated anywhere may be applied everywhere. The non-technical graduate need not know where electricity comes from-nor even how it works. But he should know what electricity can do for him no matter what vocation he selects. 3-lOnH GENERAL ELECTRIC GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY, SCHENECTADY, NEW YORK =:..: r

A Lesson in Psychology cA N OLD CHIEF of the Pueblo Indians, on his first visit to Chicago, was taken to the top of the new Tribune Tower Building. On leaving the elevator, he turned to his guide and asked, \When are we going up?\ When he was told that he was already on the top floor, the old man declared flatly that he did not believe it, because he had climbed no ladders;-not could he be persuaded until he looked over the city spread out beneath him. It's all a matter of association. The Chief had always associated the idea of ''going up\ with the lad- ders of a Pueblo. I a a similar fash ~ ion, to people in modern cities the world over, the idea of ascent is inextricably bound up with the name of Otis. THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE BUILDING is equipped with nine ( 9) Otis Elevators, traveliltg at a speed of 800 F.
