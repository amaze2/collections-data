OUt in San Jose College in California, a sophomore bet a fel- low student he could kiss twenty girls in half an hour. He failed but gladly paid the five dollar debt and was warm in his praises of the new game. This new inter- collegiate sport only goes to prove that college students do not always llarticipate in foolish and senseless pastimes. Final exammations will begin earlier this year than as formerly scheduled, according to an an- nouncement made yesterday by Dean Charles Garis. The new dat~ has been set for Thursday, May 25, changed from the date given in the calendar, Monday, May 29. The reason for the change, accord· ing to the Dean, is to break up tbe series of days congested with ex- aminations, and scheduled games, relieving much unnecessary strain on the students. The new arrangement will allow Saturday afternoons free, and the Memorial Day receso will give suf- ficient breathing spells between the closely-scheduled finals. Summer surveying will begi'1 earlier also, having been moved up to Monday, June 5. This, will shorten the course by nearly 'l. week, allowing more time .for vaca- tion later in the summer, The baccalaureate address will be given on Sunday, June 11, and the commencement exercises will be on the following day. The dorm- itories will close on Tuesday, June 13. Emphasizes Debt to College Picking up tills point of alumni indebtedness to the college in his talk Wednesday,. Schultz declared that \this a debt of honor which we, in gratitude for the services rende1ed to us by our Alma Mater, wish to liquidate in order that Union College will develop and progress and continue its pace of leadership.\ He explained two plans for aid to the college .by out-going senior classes which his committee has evolved after considerable stu?y of conditions in this and other ~ast­ ern colleges and universities. The first is that of life insurance en- dowment policies, first proposed here In 1936, under which \an un- dergraduate in his senior year takes out a life policy payable to any member of his family·, but the accui):lulated dividends, up to $10(), are pledged to be paid to the col- lege-usually in about 17 years.\ The seconQ. plan, which the com- mittee believes the more practical of the two, calls for senior pledges to pay $1() pel' year during their first ten years as alumni, with those students going on to graduate school expected to contribute $5 a year until their graduation. Schultz concluded by elaborating upon the possible effectiveness of the plan from a statistical stand- point, and announced that the 25 members of the committee will be- gin an immediate canvass of the Senior Class for pledges. Conference to Attract I 00 Delegates From Boston to Buffalo The first annual Union College Conference on Industry and Gov· etnment will be held on the cam- pus on Monday, .April 17, and Tues- day, the 18th. The conference will feature discussions of problems of common interest to industry, gov- ernment and education and is the first of its kind to be held between Buffalo and Boston. The third group on the program will be taken from the operas of Richard Wagner, opening with the Chorus and Finale from \Die Mesitersinger.\ 'The fifth group is composed of light, novelty numbers such as \The Musical Trust\ by Clokey and \Mary Had a Little Lamb,\ by Hughes. To Give Take-off on Opera The Glee Club will also offer a skit entitled \Up To Date Opera,\ a farcical take-off on grand opera. It uses musical excerpts from sev- eral classical operas as its vehi- cle. The plot is buit around a ho- tel fire, leading up to the escape of the whole cast. The conference will be attended by 125 representatives of small, medium and large sized organiza- tions, Professor Russell A.

Dr. Fox appealed in his speech to the newspapers of this country to tell the public the real story of higher education and to forget the \frivolous caml?~s pranks and insignificant actlvi- Ues.'' . The latest fad which is sweeping collegiate circles ls that of swal- lowing goldfish. It all started when a Harvard student downed· one without a chaser. Just to prove that Harvard students are sissies a Southern student turned cannibal- istic hollered \hold tight,\ and did awa;,.. with six without burping. In his statement to the press he stated that the only after effects were that fins caught bEotwccn his teeth and he had to apply a toothbrush. Last report was that some student had esten one hundred and some and a woman mathematican ap- plied a slide rule to figure out that the average stomach can hold 356. To Sing At Annual Alumni Concert This Evening They are Rollin L. Twining, '39, David L. Yunich, '39, Henry Clay, \39 George Miller, '40, Robert Sim- mons, '39, and Louis J. Carr, '40.

The mem- bers o~ the Ga1·net Key Seciety, who will act as ushers at the con- cert are Don Glenn, Frank Fred- erick, Leo Dwyer, and Lou Carr, The Schenectady County Alumni concert will be the tenth concert in the Glee Club's seasonal series.· On Monday night the club will appear in the Plattsburg High School and assist Dr. Tidmarsh in an organ recital and concert at the Platts- burg Presbyterian Church. The con- cluding concerts of the season will tail:e place in Mechanicville on April 20 and Schuylerville on April 28. To prove Easterns are softies, the Midwest took to digesting Vic~ • trola records and are none the worse for it. Proving the old adage that the women always have the last say, a student in a woman's college grabbed a pail and shovel and. dug up a pretty mess of angle worms. Some reporters arriving, she turned on the prettiest smile pos- sible und·er adverse conditions, wound a few hundred worms around a ·fork, a few at a time, and swallowed them.

See it - today ! •A Handful of Beauty •A Roomful of Power F1·ida:y, April 14, 1939 \GET TOUGH\ MR. CHAIRMAN Frain time to time \Ye have bemoaned the lack of spirit on the campus and have pleaded for some semblance of student interest in Union's undergraduate life. Now, how- ever, it appears that even the men whom we have chosen as our student govemment rep- resentatives are not sufficiently interested in their duties to attend the monthly meet- ings of the Student Council. Shol'tly before spring· recess a Council meeting was postponed because there was not a quorum present., and again on Wednes- day night the scheduled meeting which had originally been postponed also lacked a (,uo- rum, so no official meeting could be held. Twelve rep1·esentatives were absent f1·om Wednesday's meeting, only five of whom wNe excused-leaving seven unexcused ab~ sences. Because of the 1•efusal of these men to assume the responsibilities of the posi- tions to which they were elected, approxi- mately 29 other representatives, many of whom made sac1·ifices to attend, could trans- act no business, and as a consequence ::;everal pressing Jnatters must hang fire. According to the Constitution of Student Government unexcused absence from a meet- ing is tantamount to resignation. Th€ Con- stitution reads: Failure of a member of the Student Council to attend any regular meeting will automatically constitute resignation from the Council, unless the member previously notifies and presents an ac- ceptable excuse to the Chairman of the Conncil. . . . The Coordinator and Chairman of the Council .shall then jointly determine the method of filling the vacancy, As this is the first year of the new Constitu- tion-a year in which precedents will be made, we suggest that l\lr. Yunich, as Chair- man, interpret the Constitution in a. strict sense, and appoint representatives pro-tem to replace these men. This move might prove cumbersome and distasteful, but we believe that in all fairness to future Councils the step should be taken. Such a measure would serve as warning to future representatives that membership in the Council is not merely another \line in the Garnet\ activity, but is honor which entails serious application to duties of the office. We feel this is essential if the Coun- cil is to maintain its prestige and is to play The principle was established in 1908 by the U. S. Supreme Court, in its de·cision of the famous Dan- bury Hatters Case. Because· the Brotherhood of United ·Hatters of Ameri-ca had called a strike and instituted a nationwide boycott against .hats made by Loewe and Company of Danbury, ·Conn., the com- pany charged 240 members O·f the union with con- ·~piracy to restrain interstate trade under the Sher- man Anti-Trust Act. A~ provided for in t:he law, the company asked for tl'iple damages. In an unanimous decision the Coul't upheld the company, and the unionists were eventually forced to ·pay $252.000. Since then un-ions have seldom been used under the :Sher·man Act. But that the vital labor -provisions 1 etain their teeth was pt oved a few weeks ago in a Philadelphia ·Court in th·e case of the Apex Hosiery Co. v::. Branch No. 1, American Federation of Ho::- iel'y Workers, a C I Q. affiliate. The union staged a 48 day sit-down strike in the Apex mill which resulted in widespread damal'(e to the plant and a halt to the mill's business. The company s-ued the union under the Shel\'nan Act. In returning a verdict for the company th·e jury found that the union had \authorized\ an·d \ratified\ not only the plant's seizure but injury to its ma- chinery, equipment, merchand-ise, thus restraining in- tentate trade. The com-pany was awarded $7,111,- 3~3.55. th1ee times the alleged amount of damage suffered? This is believ-ed to be the largest assess- ment of damages ever imposed on a U. S. Labor union. The decision has great significance; it estab- lishes !01 the f.irst time the right of an employer to collect damages for a sit down strike. The union's counsel viewing the verdict as \a dangerous do<J- tt·ine in labo1· law\ is planning an a.ppeal. Mean· while, the un·ion officials are wondezing how the as.;e;;,;ment would be paid if the decision is not re- vened. The union treasmy. it is said, ha.s only $50,000.

These are the well-organized tortures con- ducted not by villains of a medieval novel but by G-E engineers. They are the \creep\ tests conducted on sample rods of various steels before these steels are used in the manufacture of turbines. As explained by E. L. Robinson, St. Law- rence, 'II, Harvard Engineering School, '14, G-E engineer, .the excessive heat under which a turbine operates softens the metal of which it is made, and the metal extends, or creeps. If this creeping exceeds a dimen- sional change of a hundred-millionth part per hour, or is not symmetrical and uniform, the turbine shell may leak or the speeding rotor may get out of line. To avoid these troubles, types of alloyed steels that restrict creeping must be used. Therefore, the creep tests. Sample rods are held fast and stretched until they break. They are put into electric furnaces and kept there for as long as 10 years; temperatures as high as I'loo F being maintained. Careful Phone 4-7793 inspection of the results shows whether the steel is of the proper type. This creep test is only one of the many made on each G-E turbine. For many other engineers-veterans and Test men alike- conduct other exacting te!JtS. WORLD'S CHAMPION S IT. TING complacently on his new throne in the G-E Research Laboratory is the new midget weight-lifting champion. Not only does he completely outclass other contenders, but it seems probable that he will continue to do so for some tih1e. This champion is the world's most powerful permanent magnet for _its size. Even though he weighs only J/'150th of a pound, he is capable of lifting nearly r 500 times his own weight. The midget is made of a material known as Alnico, in traduced by the Research Labora- tory as a heat-resisting alloy. Alnico magnets have been used for some time in radios, motors, generators, and other electric equip- men.t, replacing electromagnets, which re- quire current for their operation.

Carroll, will pres~nt the final perform.ance of Peter Ibsen's \RosmeJsh<»lm\, at the Potsdam Normal School in Potsdam, New York on T'hursday evening. The play will be vresent- ed with the ol'iginal cast. Andrew Speziall, '42, and Mrs_ Viola Patter- son have the leading roles. The \Rosmersholm\ troupe held its final check-tJp rehearsal last Friday evening in the Mounte- banks Theatre. Tomorrow morning, the sets for the production will be shipped to Potsdam and set up be- fore t-he cast arrives. T-h)3 players will leave the college grounds at six o'clock Thursday morning, ar- riving at Potsdam at about two in the afternoon. They will remain until the following morning. \Rosmersholm\ was presented in the Mountebanks Theatre on March 3, 4, and 6. It was later presented in Albany.

He was expected earlier but his departure from the hospital was delayed because of an ulcerated tooth. Dr. Stubing probably will not res·ume teaehing, however, until next Septe-mber, Dr. George H. Danton announced. Dr. Stubing bas been confined to a hospital in Philadelphia for several weeks recoving from an operation for floating retinas of the eyes. His slgl!t will ,now be entirely restored after a short rest. Dr. Danton explained that Dr. Stubing under no condition would be allowed by hi£ docto-r to take over classes before three weeks have elapsed, and, that because of the short period to the close of college, it would not be advisable for him to re- turn at that time. It is expected, however, that Dr .. Stubing will resume his teaching in the fall.

The ma- chinery is much less expensive than conveyors and just as certain of rEsults if properly designed.'' A forum meeting on \The Prac- tical Meth.ods of Cooperation with Labor\ was held yesterday after- noon in Old Chapel. J.

The Philomathean Society met with the debating team of Wells College Friday evening in an in- formal debate on the subject \So- ci:llized Medicine.\ The discussion was carried on in a modified Ore- gon system, with no formal rebut· tal. In place of the rebuttals, both sides aslted questions in an effort to get a clearer understanding of the subject Union upheld the negative side of the question and was represent- ed by Lon Barringer and Marvin Lazarus. The Wells team, defend- ing the affirmative, was represent- ed by Miss Betty Tumbell and Miss Evelyn Jones. No decision was reached, the motive of the debate being a discussion of the problem rather than a forwarding of any one speclllc plan. The main attraction so far is the Cora Cola dispenser. This wonder- ful machine, upon insertion o-f one nickel therein, promptly pro duces one bottle of the liquid, without 1ny JlUshing of buttons ot• pulling of levers. As a matter of fact, the book- store now has all the aspects of a cocktail lounge, with th-e above mentlcned Coca Cola replll.cing the cocktails. People just drop in, browse around for a wbile, rest peacefully in the \boolt n()olt•• with a book, and then wander -(}ut again. We also learned from MrS-. Jen- kins that the number of students who drop in for a friendly game of checkers is amazing. Presiding over this scene from the synthetic seclusion of her glass- enclosed cubicle,. Mrs. Jenkins has no-v assumed the position of host- ess-manager of the store.

How about it? An Observer Bob North, '36, Describes Italian Reception of Adolph Hitler Two alumni, Russell L. Green- man, '25, and Robert Cartet· North, '36, have recently been active in the lecturing field, while a third, Vincent J. Keenan, has been awarded a teaching fellowship at Cornell University. Greenman, a consultant on the staff of McKinsey, Wellington and Company of New York City, will spealt on the employers' views of the labor situation May 2 at a Civic Education Forum at the Perth Amboy High School. The speaker has held numerous execu- tive pos>:tions sine e his graduation from college and became connect- ed with his present firm last fall. He has also been affiliated with the West~rn Electric Company and the United States Chamber of Commerce as personnel adminis- trator. \' A world traveler, following in the footsteps of his explorer father, Robert North recently told Glens Falls Rotarians that the Italian populace did not cheer Adolf Hit- !Pr when he visited thPir counHy recently. North told of seeing tlle armed force& instruct unenthusi- 3stic Italian civilians in the art of applause in ordet' that rrotion .pic- ture cameramen could make the desired movies. North also told· of his treatment at the hands of Hal- ian police and closed with the showing .of motion pictures of his trip to Tunis and Algiers. In recognition of his research on the action of fluodne on the dich- loro benzenes, Vincent J. Keenan was recently given a teaching fel- lowship in the Cornell Graduate School of Chemistry. The award includes .free tuition and fees and a salary of $500 for part time teaching in the undergraduate school. Keenan was initiated to Sigma Xi, the national honorary scientific fraternity this winter for· showing ,special aptitude in l'e- search. He will start a four year course in work for his doctorate degree next fall. 'lturUug 1'0DA Y! A<lOl]llt 1\lenjou In \l{JNH OJ' TilE 'I'URJ.'\ 2nd Hit!

A culture that is real ~prings out of the soil and out of the peo- ple.

Sophomores Take Exa·m. Thursday Along with sophomores in ap- proximately 250 other col!eges, the members of the class of 1941 will be given the National Cooperative Sophomore Ex a m i nat ion s this Thursday. The tests will consist of two sections, the first to be given at 9:30 A.. M., and the second at 1:30 P. M. Both sessions will meet in the lecture room of the Chem- istl'y Laboratory. Sophomores will not attend any classes on that day. The testing program will cov~r a wide range of topics, and will be unique in that students can not pre- par efor it beforehand. The Na- tional Education Association, which is sponsoring these tests, is striving to develop an objective basis for estimating how curriculums com- how individual stuC!ents in one col- pare with one another, and also lege compare with those in other institutions. Dr. Ernest Ligon said that the re- sults of the examinations, over a period of years, will be used to sug- gest changes in cul'!'iculums, and in methods of teaching. Dr. Ligon will discuss the tests before the student body in his address at the Daily Assembly tomorrow morning.

The quaint little struggle was conceived by the R. P. I. boys, probably because spelling was the old field in which they had never tried to prove their supremacy over Union. The Albany \Palace\ thea- tre was chosen as the battlefield, evidently because the management was helping to sponsor the event; but it was a smat·t move to have it on neutral ground. Apparently the R. P. I. lads never have trusted us. Union's team, hand-picked by Dr. Burges Johnson, had great poten- tialities, but they didn't material~ ize-very obviously. Two freshmen, two sophomores, and one jut1ior comprised the delegation, with one of the former taking second place to uphold the noble name of the· class of '42. The elimination was rapid at the outset of the ma,tch, due more to the contestants' over- eagerness to break speed records The morally victorious gladiators returned home via the doubtful locomotion of Go!'don Gould's car He's pretty optimistic, calling It a cat·, too. Sheldon Evans, playing . manager of Burges' Battlers, was allowed to exercise his authority by directing the pushing of the above mentioned vehicle. Suffice it to say that the boys finally got home. The cagy Dr. Johnson, however had the foresight to see that his proteges were assured of traveling expenses, before he allowed them to make the trip. We hope that the funds thus allotted were sufficient to compensate for the wear and tear on Gould's Folly. It certainly wa.s terrific.

Al- though, in this underdog position. since the start of the .lacrosse se- ries with Hobart, the Union team has .produced many such victories os the one two years ago. It is therefore Coa~h Harkness's hope that the Garnet stickwielders may be able to turn the tables on the boys from Geneva. Win or lose, the gatne will provide valuable practise to the inexperienced sophomores that make up the bulk of the Union team. since building up a team from raw freshmen is the only means of getting a team that is available to the Dutchmen. Hobart, however, has had most of its teams com- posed of men with past experience, for la.ct·osse is a very popula.r sport in that section of the s.tate.

The feature of the meeting was the re? cing of four papers and a tom of the research laboratoi'ies of the General Electl'ic Company. The Williams group. consisting of 13 students and four members of the Physics Department, arrived at 9 o'clock and was taken on a tour of the Union laboratories. The morn· ing session of the conferen.ce was devoted to the reading of four pa- WJrS and discussion oJ them. George B. Dutton of Williams dis· cussed the \Application of La- grange's Equation to Elect.:l'ical Cir· cuits.\ The use of Monomolecular Films, recently developed by Dr. Langmuir, Honorary Fellow in Physical Sciences, was th.e subject of a discussion lead by Frank L. Moore, '39. Henry C. Meadows, '40, talked upon \Energy ?rodu·ction in the Sun,\ and C. E. Glock of Wil- liams concluded the morning's dis- cuss.ion with a talk on the \Nega- tive Res istan·ce Oscillator.\ In the afternoon, the group visited the General Electric Company ·and took part in experiments dealing with fluorescence phenomena and the phenomena of the discharge of gasses. The Union group consisted of: Louis Maples a.nd Melvin Landon, graduate s-tudents, Frank 1 ... Moo.re, '39, Jack Me·ngel, '39, Henry Mea- dows, '40, Everett Hafner, '40, El- liot He-r-tzmmk, '40, Darius Gal- lagher, '40 and Da:vid Preston, '40. 0' Rourkes Are Three-ing Boast Bouncing Baby Boy The Vernon A.

Meeting Workshop Group Gives Roundtable Discussion The Radio Workshop group pre- sente<l another in its series of broadcasts yesterday, from 4:00 to 4:30, over the General Electric's short wave stations, W2XAD and W2XAF, The program consisted of a roundtable discussion between John Sheehan, ·25, director of the Worlwhop, Dr. Burges Johnson, Professor of English, representing the division of literature, Dr. Har- old A. Larrabee, Professor of Phi- losophy, representing the Social Studies division. and Dr. Peter I. Wold, Professor of Physics, as a member of the science division. The discussion was concerned with the work of the various fields of study in the college, and gave a cross section of the aims of Union's educational work. The program was entirely informal, and none of the discussion was rehearsed. The program was arranged by a committee consisting of Elliot Hcrtzmarlt, '40, Roger Fowler, '40, James Wade, '39, and Paul Ma- honey, '39. Dr. Frederic!{ Lidell Bronner, un- derstudy of Dr. Waldron as college historian, was first, foremost and most venemous. \First of all,\ he claimed,. \it cost the Class of 1923 $3000, not $200(} as printed in the 'Concordy.' The payments were spread out over the entire four years and we kept paying. They 'busted' about 100 at midyears and the class continued to dwindle. We still had a fifteen dollar payment to malre in our senior· year.\ w.ell, how, we quel'ied, in a simple riot could expenses get up to that gigantic figure? As Dr. B1·onner explained it, the sophomores, who were attacking the ball in which the freshmen were having their banquet, were unable to get in and so, with the evilest of intent, they dashed next door to the little Greek confectionery store and practically departed with it in toto. The pro- prietor put up no resistance. The merchandise was then hurled at the yearlings who were fighting back from their foul'th floor perch. \I remember,\ the dignified his- torian added, \that I threw a spit- toon from up there and nearly kill- ed by roommate.

Freshman Dance Attracts Crowd Class of '42 Revels Noisily With 'Scarlet Syncopators' In Alumni Gymnasium The first All-Freshman Dance held on the Union campus was pro~ nounced a financial success today by the dance committee in a report to \The Concordiensis\. Although a slight profit was made, the :price of several Union banners. which disappeared during the evening, will consume the pl'Ofits it was in- dicated. Over two hundred persons, in- cl-uding many faculty members, danced from nine until one in the Alumni Gymnasium. According to the dance committee, there were no disturbances reported at any time during the evening from up- perclassmen. The dancing was interspersed with freshman stunts, as bad been previously announced and the Scar- let Syncopators supplied the music. Furniture, borrowed from various fraternities, was used, although n<l regular booths were assigned. A novelty feature was used by the ft·eshmen in using indirect colored lighting rather than the direct light from the ceiling. Tll-e gym was decorated in Garnet and Gold with spring as the central theme. Behind the orchestra, was a black backdrop with the num· erals 1942 in gold. Union and fra· ternity banners adorned the walls, and garnet streamers of crepe pa- per were crossed from the ceiling. Another novelty was arranged by the dance committee and was a surprise to the freshman class: a skeleton, dressed in a 1941 sweater was placed in a wooden coffin wit!; a spotlight illuminating it,

Williams has a half a million less, Wesleyan, an even eig-ht million, Hamilton, $4,582,561, and Union, $4,379,000. And yet ''le at the latte1· institution are the fitst to affirm that we are getting educated just as efficiently as stud·ents at any of these sister schools. Tuition fees fm· the five are about on a level: our incom.e certainly has no advantag-e there. Now no flight of idealism can becloud the fact it takes money and !}lent;y of it to effec- tively run a college. Union may J.>.e able to keep up its end a while longer umiet· its pres- ent financial condition, but that its scholastic and soci~l status wiH suffer eve11tually un- less that condition is bet.tel'ed, is inevitable. Any man with a drop of gamet blood in him ougll.t to be aroused by such a situation. He oug-ht to be particula1·ly aroused when he comp1·ehends these figUl'es: even th.e student who is unaided by scholarships pays only $1500 of the <~.pproximate $2500 it costs the college to instruct him fm· fom years (nor does this sum include more- than -di i'ect oper- ating expenses). President John Schultz of the Senio1· Class has callEd it \a debt of honor\ that every graduate owes the college; he is rigllt. After considerable consultation with the administration, a representative committee of twenty-five seniors has arrive<! at what it conside1•s the best plan for young alumni support. Very sanely, the:y have discounted the possilJilities of the oft-recuTJ'ent insur- ance pla:.n and sugg·est a .system of direct, reasonable-sized, pledged gifts. The Inem- bers <Ue ,~,·i1Jing to spend a good bit of their time from now until the end of t:he year soli- citing pledges. The least that tho€ rest of the seniors can do is to seriously ,])'onder the possibility of making those pledges. Certainly o-ne is not being t()o optimistic to hope that the average s-enior 11()t going on to gTa.d11ate school will be able to spare $10 a year fOL- his alma mater until his temth re- union. If this year's class as 2 body can see its way clear to make th.e -pledg·es, and fulfill them, it. will help to establish a.n invaluable precedent for its succe~sor; it will give Union a. sum about equal to the interest on THE CONCORDIENSIS,' TUESDAY, APRIL 25, 1939 $50,000, and, both by the financial aid itself and the 'lasting interest in the college which it will prove, it will be clearing its \debt of honor.\ YOUR PJ\PER One of the goals which we have set for ourselves dul'ing our incumbency a:s editors of \The Concordiensis\ is the breaking down ! of the geaerally accepted campus belief that we are an isolated group of smug individuals, WOl\king somewhere ill sm;man Hall, dog- 11l:aticallr filling om· publi-cation with what we consider to be the important news of Union, with a fom1 of \to hell with what the students think\ attitude. We hope to prove that \The ConC(ll'dien- sis\ is genuinely concemed with undergradu- ate interests, and that we are attempting to cater to this interest. Desp;te the fact that ·we m·e fi·equently inclined to overestimate our impmtance, we do realize that we are a student pu-blication, financed by student tax funds, and al'e aware that our primary duty is to satisfy the student conception of a cred- itable paper. One of the difficulties we have encoun- tered, howev~::r, is the determination of what the students expect and desire of a paper, and it is in this 1·espect that we seek assist- ance. If there are aspects of \The Concordi- ensis\ that ~\re unpopular, we shall more than welcome criticisms and suggestions. If the complaint js found to be widespread, at- tempts at improvement will be made. This is the llt~wspap.er of the undergraduate body of Union CollEge-we are me1·ely editing it for those who suppo1t it, so if you, as a sup- p01te1·, ltave any comments to make about YOUR Jlaper, we ask that you send them to us. We are attempting to dispel! the impres- sion that ''The Conco1·diensis\ is <t closed cor- pomtion, open only to a mysterious select few. A11_v stud.ent is welcome to participate, and we al'€ anxious to include more fresh- men on our staff. ,Contributions, be they columns, feature stories about unusual hap- penings, news stories, or letters to the Edi- tor are particularly welcome. We cannot, for obvious reasons, guarantee that all sub- mitted material will be published, but our policy ·will be to include as much of it as possible. Ft·om time to time, one of the dozen or so persons who recognize a member of \The Concordiensis\ staff ask why we do not write an editoTial on some su:bject or other, or why we have not written up an account of some event. Our response is usually that we were unaware o·f the event or condition. We wish to encourage the use of our \In the l\lail\ columns. If you have what you considel' to be a grievance, write us a letter. If you [eel that someone worthy of praise is not receiving the attention he deserves, a letter mig:ht heLp remedy this condition, We feel that student interest in the paper will be infinitely increased when these \In the l\1ai-l\ columns become more popular. Don't grumble, write. In writing you will aid us ill making \The Concordiensis\ a true campu~ newspape1·, reflecting student opin- ion, instead of a publication edited by a small group attempting to cater to what it believes to be student interest.

'I'his is an instrument which accomplishes the task of presenting sepa-rate views to the two eyes, and so affords vivid impressions of the third dimension. \'ThAs tendency to perceive as objectively as possible is very prac- tica:l, -fm in life we deal with ob- jects ·rather than with retinal im- ages or other sensations. The ob- jectif:ying tendency comes out rather strongly in the perception of tbe color of objects.

This victory tabs the cadets as a tough obstacle and they appear to have several firsts sewed up. Coach Bill H:etz has a trio of fine javelin throwers who may up- set Army's men. Big Ernie Boden- stab should be able to take the shot and discus throws and Union's dis- tance men, Paul Santoro, Joe An- nese, and Bill .T oh.nson, are likely to place. Captain Bob Hayner of the Union forces is likely to take over the Army men in hurdling events. since Colgate's Captain Dave Campbell managed to breast the tape in front of the Cadet hurdlers for the Red Raider's only first. Campbell's time was : 15.3, however, three-tenths of a second better than Hayner's fastest. These seem to be Union J only hopes, since Army is strong in all other departments.
