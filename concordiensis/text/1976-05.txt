Page 4 't' a.r.··s Theater: CONCORDIENSIS, Wednesday; May 5, 1976 ,~, . ,.. ·, ~ ., .. 'The Lady' glowed by SUE FINKELSTEIN .. The set looks really good. l didn't expect anything this eKtensive,\ she said, and found upon examination that Charlie hac! painted the floor of the set to look as if a stone floor had been 1!1id there. And from any distance, it looked authentic. \Arthur Miller is playing the flute in that music, He's pretty good, but they play it so often that it .kind of gets engrained in your head after a while,\ he added, and was glad that this time ;he chose to sit on a chiar instead of those uncomfortable 'benches. The play was looking better already. _ A single actor sauntered onto the stage. He seated himself in front of the castles' windows, and began to write in a. huge old · notebook with a plumed quill pen. The audience soon quieted 1 down, and began to study the young man; David rerolled his program and slid it back into the small bit of ribbon within which it had been tied. The play was beginning. Everyone laughed. Gary Levy, who played Thomas, was awfully funny ·in his constant attempt to convince Bill Pike, the Mayor of this .small town, that he was guilty of killing an old man (Arnie Hiller) in the village and wanted to be hanged. After all, nobody really wanted to be hanged, and Gary's making himself out to be the Devil in the flesh went over awfully well. Shari Ratner . pointed this out herself in her own highly polished and convincing portrayal of the mother in The Lady's Not For Bur~~ing~ - · \What's the plot'l\ she whjspered to him, who was seeing it for the second· time t()night. \lt's a farce of the literature of the 1400's mostly,\ he said. \Thomas (Gary Levy) wants ta be killed because he•s sick of the world. Janet (Sheryl Holland) is falsely is accused of being a witch, and the Mayor (Bill Pike) condemns her to death, and condemns him to life. There are two brothers -Humphrey (Peter Sobol) and Nicholas (Roger Summerhayes) - they spend a lot of time at each other's throats while after the same woman, and set up their mother for some good spoofs on the \moral people\ of the world. It ends up that the old guy Thomas supposedly had killed is still alive; Thomas and Janet fall in love, and Humphrey and Nicholas lose the same girl (Allison ~ Meg Hokel) to Richard, the Mayer's clerk (Mike Brown); It's really not that hard to follow the language after a while ... Nicholas is now ranting and raving about his \dim-wit\ brother who insists in lying out in the yard in the rain,. and about Allison, a nun who has been promised to his brother in marriage, yet is promised to him in the stars. Th.e audience is hysterical. Thomas is still screaming to be hanged; Mother is appalled at the lack of etiquette with which this group is conducting itself, the Mayor is screaming that this all \will aU be gone into at the proper time,\ and the people are rioting in the streets, convinced that Janet is .a witch. \Their timing has improved a lot since the first time 1 saw them,\ he commented. \Now the :tines are really bitting home. This is pretty funny.\ \That's what my brother and l sound like half the time,\ she added. \You really begin to believe they're related. This is really good.\ The pl()t now involves itself with getting Janet to admit her witchery. Humphrey wishes someone wou'ld donate his litttle brother to charity, because he is getting \sick of him\. By the time · Humphrey propositions Janet in order to save herself from the stake, the audience is really caught up in the ctazy plot, and Susan is scribbling away. Everyone's really doing a fine job; how could Skwitz not have li~ed it the first time'! Roger, in his lust for women and suggested masochistic tendencies, delivers his lines beautifully; You'd never know Bill wasn't really nearing 50; he's come into his own . since those days on the stage set of You Can't Take It With You. Sheryl doesn't look very much like a witch, but accentuates the farce ·in he,r o·wn honesty and straightforwardness, as does Tabercoom (Nancy Levinthal), who appears to espouse one of the few sane ·philosophies in the play. Gary dominates many of the scenes with his biting and almost convincing speeches on the values of life in this world. Meg portrays the perfect caricature of the female, who overacts ·to perfection the corniness of the rale, and Richard is just naive. · Continued on Page 9 Pete Sobol and Bill Pike as they. appeared pre• The Lady's Not For Burning.

Yet for others Parents' Weekend is an attempt to rationalize to some not too sympathetic elders exact-ly what those tri-annua:l bank withdrawals are adding up to on the receiving end. This critic made the sad mistake of attempting to save these sore purses by taking my parents to see the \art exhibit\ displayed in the dreary halls of the Union art building for this special weekend. This criticism is not so much directed towards the works themselves as it is toward the lack of care or planning with which this so-called exhibit was put together. Twenty-two pieces lined the narrow halls on the first floor of the building, Many Were hung crookedly and .ghbsts of others were suggested by hooks left by SUE FlNKELS~EIN unadorned. The matting and frames often ol,)scured signatures; as all works were untitled, it becomes difficult to direct comment. Yet perhaps the Parents' Weekend Art Exhibit can be ta·ken as the best testimony yet Cited to the inadequacy and apathy directed to the arts at the college. The saddest part of this event was not that my par.ents left the exhibit without new-found confidence in their expendirures, but that a few fine pieces went unnoticed, due to their poor display. Charcoals, etchings in India ink, pastels, and oils made ·up the smaJl collection. Louis Spadenuta's \room\ (India ink) stood out from the bleak atmosphere as a beautiful work. The scene was both busy and quiet. Louis caught the stillness of the room as well as the activity outside it seen through an open window. A few of the oils, done by Marrs, were well painted, highly realistic,. and managed to make the viewer stop for a closer look. Another oil, painter unknown, portrayed a girl sitting on a multi- colored floor. The scene was bleak, but the. colors blended and made it pleasing to the eye. The sketch of an old man with a turban involved good detail, intricate shading, · and used an intriguing face for its subject. I am a novice to art, highly uneducated in both techniq,ue and quality, yet 1 do feel that even the most minimal attempts at art at least deserve a few moments. of time in their display. In sum I would like to quote first an art student and then my rather disappointed mother in their reactions to the Parents' Weekend Student Art Exhibit: \Have you seen that exhibit'! No wonder · there are no art majors in this place.\ \Susan this is terrible.\ Ladies, I agree. e· The photography of Union College semor. c.:znay Wolfson, is now on display in the Union Gallery.

Page6 CONCORDIENSlS, Wednesday, May 5, 1976 \ -- Editorial: tax: Tuition is .going up from $3305 to $3750. The cost of a room on campus is taking_ another incremental jump -. e.g. a double in South is going from $690 to $771. Student tax will remain stationary, no increase. At first glance one might say that this is good; but a little closer examination shows that this is not the case. The decision by the Tax Committee (on advice of an ad h()C committee studying· the role of student tax) not to ask for an increase in the tax is wrong. Since 1969 student tax has only been increased twice; these increases do not even cover the rate of inflation since that time, let alone the increased number of organizations. The decision not to raise student tax can only mean one thing: the organizations on campus are going to be expected to generate. more of their own revenue for the upcoming year. This has been stated by the Tax Committee. This will mean higher prices for movies, concerts, speakers and maybe you will have to become a paid subscriber to your favorite campus newspaper. Who do the members of the Tax and ad hoc Committees think the various organizations on campus are going to turn to for that increased revenue. If you haven't figured it out yet put down your paper and look in the mirror. Why do we have to put up with this kind of. logic? Who in their right mind is going to devote the time to running a campus organization and at the same time worry about keeping that organization financially solvent. Something has to be done. The whole situation is being handled- poorly. Either an increase in student tax should be requested or the criterion by which an organization is defined as fundable has to be re• examined and redefined. If the College and the Board of Trustees are willing to approve large increases in tuition and room rates . it doesn't seem likely that they would refuse a modest increase in student tax. If they do, it indicates one of two things: I) A lack of co~cern for the social needs of the students. 2) Serious inconsistencies and problems in the system for allocating student tax money. We think number two is the winner. MRA . umon college Concordiensis 'EDITORS-IN-CHIEF ................................

Ouch! .-of those eager, young scholars wh<;~ had to face their parents for a weekend. \It's my allergy, Ma.'' Socially, the parents were permitted to see aU those things which the school provides for us every weekend- a play, cabaret, cocktail parties, picnics, a view of the president, concerts, etc .. This, in turn, makes all the parents wish they were back in college, thereby increasing the likelihood of a small <lonation. Planning these social events the weekend before midterms also fit in nicely with the academic plan for lowering grades. l wonder how the parents can accept this veneer of deception- which includes an unrealistic example of a life that is unrealistic in the first place? Seeing Union on parent's weekend gives about as significant a portrayal of life here as the Mardi Gras does of the New Orleans slums .. How would you like it if there were parents around all the time!? Parent's weekend insures us that the other weekends will survive relatively unblemished for the small sacrifice of a few days in the spring. Though it was nice out Saturday morning, we did not waste a weekend's worth of beautiful weather on .. the rents.\ 'This (of course) was planned by ·AnQther candidate speaks: the college in. its .attempt to depict a realistic example of life at Union. The weekend permitted parents the opportunity to indulge in that same comparison test their children have been participating in -all year: next year's fashions, the year ·~ after cars, the proper dinner arrangements.. . . By the way, how maRy of those cars were ticketed'! There can be little doubt that the city bribes the school to sponsor the weekend. When else can the Schenectady Holiday Inn demand full payment in advance and all the restaurants in town boast full reservations? Even the Thruway Authority got a slice of the pie. Having survived one more anachronistic throw back to sleep-away camp, we can all begin to save up our resources against next year's invasion. But before that siege takes place; a few suggestions might be of some value. Reserve a section of the campus (a slice of the gardens and a room or two here and there) as off limits to parents as a means of escape. Hold parents's weekend at Girling Center or in the middle of July. Hold all the eyents of the weekend, only don't invite the parents. I'm not sure how to phrase this last tasty tiff-bit any of you see the movie \If .. .'\? I would like to take issUe with Mr. Pitney's artide of last weelc which criticised, Star Trek for being illogLca.!. 1 submit that Mr.· Pitney lia~·- transgressed the unwritten law concerning the watching of television; that, while the box is on thou shalt not think. . Where I live, .thinking during a TV show is punishable by a· two~minute minor. And, really, that is the way it ought to be. Television is meant to be . a vacation, a relaxation from thought. Mr. Pitney, however, is · a man with a longer-running intellectual warp drive than .many; so apparently some of his thinking time overflows into his TV slot. The rest of us are fortunate to make it through a day with anything but impulse power remaining for 11:30 p.m. to the days when one will be graduated, settled, employed, and most likely ~tagnated . into a pleasant, mindless treadmill where thought is rare and even discauraged.

PETER ELKIN Ira Goodman My caudidacy 1s a response to an increasing .disillusionment with the strength of the voice of the student body in making decisions on this campus. The recent College Senate action to keep the students out of the tenure process is one aspect of this problem. There are too many other issues on this campus in which student opinion is either not voiced or not heard. As student liason to the board of trustees, I intend to make that voice more prominent and hopefully more important in decision making. Although I have not previously been directly involved in student government, I am affiliated with organizations in which student opinion is important, namely, the Social Committee and the Campus Voice. I ·hope I can make the post of Junior Trustee a viable source of student input as well. If you wish to discuss any issues with me, I can be reached at 210 Davidson or telephone number 370-64ll. I will also be coming around to as many dorms and fraternities as l can this weekend to answer any questions you may have. IRA J. GOODMAN Bob Howard My name is Bob Howard.

I am simply interested in im}lroving some of the social and academic problems that plague our school. We have seen in the past, how many student officiers have lacked the interest and dedication necessary for fulfilling their promises, and performing their duties. If elected I will strive for increased student involvement in activities, an improved social atmosphere, and removal of some of the academic pressures that are prevalent.

Feel. free to call me - l want to be your President and I hope you give me the opportunity to do so. Jim Trump Union College has witnessed' many ·important changes over the .past several' years. The completion of the Achilles Rink and the· Dutch Hollow Pub mark the most signifi.c.ant additions to the. college's .physical plant since the erection of the Science and Engineedng Center. During the past three years, the quality of our films. and concerts, of student· llovernment, Concordy, the at~letic programs, both male and female, intn~mural and intercollegiate, has risen tremendously. It seems like only yesterday that Union· College had no Cabaret or even draft beet in, the Skellar. Obviously l]lore improven1ents are needed. Most students recognize the immediate necessity for a revision in the student tax structure. The Nott Memorial desperately needs repair, and· anyone eating at West knows that we could use a few changes in the present food service. How does the role of Student Trustee fit into. school government? Do students really have influence in school polil:y? What ,present issues will insure IJOnion's respectable and growing stature forthenext five years? The Student Trustee is the representative of student input on tlie Board of Trustees, the .group commissioned- to establish long-range school .policy. He does this by being accesible to student opinion; by compiling and assessing student sl,lggestions and presenting coherent recommendations to the Board. He also assists the administration in implementing school policy. The Pub-Restaurant, the Arts Symposium, the Campus -Mailroom, the Nott Memorial renovation - these are projects that have been initiated and carried through by our Student Trustees. In light of these e><amples, I believe Student Trustees do, in fact, have a positive input and role to .play in school policy. There arc several issues that will shape college policy in·the immediate future. I am particularly enthused by the possibilities of renovating our Comp Ed system and restructuring the Tenure process. 'I am also interested in the role the Arts and Athletics will play at Union College. Elaborjitiug on one of these issues, the Tenure process, I feel a unified student effort is needed to insure that students will have more than \an advisory role.\ Recently, student senators voted to allow student members of the Presidential Advisory Board to vote on the appeals of faculty while not allowing student participation on the Commitlee on Student Standing. If we are to gajn these positions of responsibility there must be a consistent and forthright eff art. In conclusion, the main point 1 would like to emphasize is that for the Student Trustee to .fulfill his .function satisfactorily, there must be student involvement and opinion forthcoming. Begin to get involved by voting in the school-wide elections on Tuesday, May I l. BRUCE HUNTINGTON Andrew Koblenz The Board of Trustees is the highest level of the Union College .governmental hierarchy. As such it has the ultimate responsibility for the setting of priorities and allocation of funds for the college. It is e><tremely important that there be student input into this process and that this input be well articulated. This point takes on more relevance when the recent decisions concerning tenure of cenain faculty, the raise in tuition, and the Nott Memorial are considered. The tiine to examine ·and perhaps reset bugetary and educational' priorities of the school is at hand. The responsibilities of a student trustee also include the communication of issues and decisions of the Board to the student body and the reception of their reactions and suggestions. In this way students will be more aware of what is happening and tile student trustee will be better able to represent their views. As the sophmore class representative to the Stude11t Forum and the All-College Senate, l have learned a great deal about the workings of the college and many of the problems facing it. This knowledge would help me to become a more effective trustee. Although I will not be able to see and talk to everyone between this printing and the elections, I would like to hear from as many people as possible. I live at 322 West and can be reached at 370-6742. 'Feel free to contact me at any reasonable time. ANDREW KOBLENZ of the school newspaper Concordy, and· the most frustrated pitcher on this year's baseball team. However, I'm trying harder. My reasons for running for President of Student Forum are as follows; I .feel there. is a great need for communication :between students and their representatives. Right now there is too much \back stabbing\ going on between students. Government should be set up on a more representative level, with each member of the Student Forum sharing an equal load of responsibility. This will enable the Forum to seP/e the purpose it was founded for. The President of -the Student Forum is also responsible for the educational planning and allocations of funds that enable Union to· survive as one of the finer small coileges. This planning is obviously quite important for the benefit of the entire campus community, and it is particularly important ·that the views of the student body be adequately expressed. With a $450 increase in tuition for the 1976-77 school year, and the same for 1977-78, the time has come for us to closely examine our budgetary priorities and attempt to hold th<;se rising costs down. It is essential for the President of .the Student Forum to listen to the suggestions of other members of the Forum, and the student body, learn from these suggestions, and then make decisions that are in the interests of all involved. Coming off a very succesful year With the completion of Achilles Rink and the refurbishing of Carnegie Hall, we the school, should now move in the direction of acquiring funds for the renovation of Nott Memorial and the construction of a new Arts Center, and new Gymnasium. I haven't had very many opportunities to discuss Presidential matters. However, l am willing to discuss with anyone their opinions or CHAR(;IE FLANAGAN Harris Halpert When trying to ''sell\ oneself in such a short period of time, it may be hard to convi.nce ·the students who don't already know me why they should elect me to the office of President. Many people seem to feel' that the student government is a useless mechanism that accomplishes very little. I believe that with the time and effort I am willing to commit to the office, it could be proven to these people that the government can get concrete results. Being an active member in both the academic and social phases of Union, I have observed many present conditions that must be changed in order for results to be obtained. Most importantly, student .parti~ipation and student feedback must reach a higher level, so all voices are heard when important issues are under consideration. Many committees and groups are unproductive and must be evaluated and reorganized in order for the government to generate the most useful output. Another important issue facing the whole campus is the value of our present Comprehensive Education System. This •-ystem. must be examined very closely and a decision must be m&dt whether or not it has been successful in its pr~.;ent form. In closing, I would like to point out the most important outcome in next Tuesday's elections will not be which candidates have the most votes, but how many votes were cast. Since all deciSions made by the governme~t effects each st~dents life. at Union, please remember to vote and be part of the decision. HARRIS HALPERT But even VJith these many ·improvements .both past and future, tbere are many ·serious .problems pr~sently facing the College. A small, private school cannot survive on its social graces, its athletic prowess, or its .pre-med and law achievements alone. Union needs all of these and much· more. It needs a much stronger Arts and H~manities program, .a. sensible and Owell-<lefined te!lure process, a revision in the Comp-Ed system, and a better ·library. The admissions program must begin to look for a more diverse stucjent, a student who is ·not only a grade-achiever but also the athlete, actor, and writer. In other words, for Union to weather .the crisis facing all smal~ Liberal Arts ·colleges, it must be able to present to its students a strong, unified yet comprehensibfe educational program, one that will appeal· to the pre-med as well as the· artist or engineer. The beer- drinker, the lacrosse-player, the Cabaret-singer as well as the book-worm all belong .at this school. Union must be prepared to accept all. None should be discouraged .to be here. B1,1t education must come first for the school. This is where our serious problems lie. This is where a lot\ of work must be done. JIM TRUMP Vice President Joe Feinberg Do Union students think that a .possible improvement in our calendar system IS more important than the name of Elroy Jetson's dog? Probably not. Student response to such questions posed during Tuesday night trivia contest have consistently evoked infinitely more ffedback than questions posed at open Senate meetings. While I don't mean to criticize the student body's choice of priorities I do think that some of this enthusiasm could be channeled into other less trivial enterprises such as Comp. Ed. reform, and other improvements. In the past three years at Union College l have been very involved with the Social Committee which has attempted to ·provide a better social life for students and is a productive, hard working committee. I am presently working on the Calendar Committee which is trying to find the most suitable calendar for Union College. I am also working on the committee for the preservation of the Nott Memorial because of my concern for its present. state. As Vice•President, one of my main objectives will be to encourage students to become involved in campus affairs and aid them in their efforts. In doing so, this will instill unity among the student body. ,- The past two terms I have worked closely with studelJl.officials in their attempts to better Union College: I feel with greater student support behind their government many new improvements can be attained. Resulting ·from the great increase in dormitory costs I feel many improvements can be made within the dorms. A committee has been reviewing Saga Food Service. I plan to make a close examination of the committee's findings. l also feel there is a need to review the tenure process. Another major issue facing the campus now is the revision of the Campi Ed. system. l am in favor of replacing .freshman electives .and Comp. Ed. courses wvth electives in fields outside a student's major. As Vice-President, l will be the student's representative in college affairs. I am sincerely Michael Ganz Students at the present time seem to have the greatest power to change the injustices of the system; yet it is also at this time that the fewest changes have occurred. Tenure (Professor Berthold for example) is the clearest exa111ple of student activism culminating in the denial. of the wishes of the students. The deafness of .the administration and others concerned. can only be rectified by increased activism of the student body. One can wonder if the election of one officer will make a major change: of course it will not. However, it is a: start. There is a beginning to everything, and if we want some start in getting change· then let's start Tuesday; May II.

JOE FEINBERG Dan Robbins • rep_resentatives Continued oo Paae 9 My name is Dan Robbins and l'm running for secretary. ·ln this Bicentennial year, it is time. to examine the issues that plague our 200tn anniversary. Pot in every chicken and a fifth in every fridge. 1 also feel that all ·benefMtors of !he Audit Committee, of which the Secretary is a member, with endowments of greater than $2,000 should have to account for the distribution of these funds. The larger benefactors should hav~ to give a periodic accounting of their allotted funds. These are the things I stand for. with students' needs. Having spent my Winter Term in Israel I was able to look at Union from an objective viewpoint and wish to· put some of my ideas into action. The tenure process as it stands now needs great revision as students do not have a major input in the process although they are .the main objective. An elective system may be able to replace the present Comp-Ed system. Saga Food Service should remain under review and if found illcoiYlpetent should be dispensed with. With the continuing dissatisfaction in the present calendar system a calendar committee was set up and has propC>sed a new calendar to the AU-College Senate. I hope to follow up on this proposal. In continuing my idea of bringing students feelings together 1 feel the Student Center should be utilized to its fullest. My major concern however, is to unify our class now and not wait until the end of our Senior year as has been done in the past. A Junior class function may be possible if the·interest is present. How do you feel? Let me know at 370-6581 or Box 959. Better yet, stop by 318 Fox. I hope you will take the opportunity to voice your preference on Tuesday. Please vote! JODY LAVIEN Bill Malnick In the past two years, I have listened to people complain about all types of things and at times, I have been one of these people. I have gone through the \transfer blues\ that appears to afflict practically everyone. However, all too ·often I find that people are constantly complaining about major issues concerning our life here such as the calendar (3-3-3), the lethargic attitude of our Student Government, in general, and also of the people who attend our school I am interested in serving as class representative for the \Class of '78\ and in this position, I pledge to work for change in many areas. For the past week and a hillf, I have been talking to lifany students about what irks them in order to learn what my major goals soould be. Among the goals that I feel important for Union are the following: I) Changing the calendar form trimester to 4-3-2, 2) Periodically having students go around campus interviewing approximately half the students about their views on major issues (definitely time-consuming but it makes up fa< it in its value), 3) Increasing the regional distribution so that we could increase our social learning by being with people from many different areas, 4) Having the social committee make more parties so that we don't force the .fraternities to provide us a social life, etc. Publicity has always been a problem for Union and I feel that we have resources that should he tapped. With aid of influential alumn~ we should be able to have a study of aspects of Union College published in newspapers and magazines (Howard Simons, the editor of the Washington Post is a Union Graduate and most likely would help us). Through statistics available to me as President of the Pre-Law Society, the school will soon be able to quantitatively show that Union is a good school for providing the students with the educational facilities needed for admission to law school. For the class of '75, of the students who answered a questionnaire, 75% were accepted into accreditted law schools. This year's class looks even better. We could also have the Nott Memorial restored as a result of increasing our publicity. The more people that know about this historic structure and its condition, the better ou~ chances are of receiving funds towards its restoration. As to the question about discrimination against women on campus, it is not the function of the Student Government to change the attitudes held about women. This problem must be alleviated in social circles. However, concerning the lack of qualified female professors, we must try to remedy tbls problem. We ·shouldn't aim for, or expect to get 50% female professors and 50% male professors because these are not the percentages that naturally occur in that profession. Rather, we should strive .for a percentage of qualified female professors th~t correlates with the percentage ·of female students on campus. Next year, we shouta agllm try to provide for .a large student input into questions concerning tenure for the simple reason that the best people for deciding whether a professor is good or not are. the ·students. I have more ideas that arc still in the formulation stage and when they are ready, I will let them be known. I ask you to support me for Junior class representative ('78) by .voting for me on May II. lfyou have any questions to ask me, my room number is 253 Fox; 1:m always available BILL MALNICK Dean Smith congratulates his persecutors.

BILL JI'N KINS TO ALL James Lippman The rc;ason I am running for Sophomore Class Representative is that I am not satisfied with the Student ·Forum the way it operates presently. My dissatisfaction stems front the lack -of knowli:dge and participation the student body has on its own Student Forum. First and foremost I believe it is the responsibility of the class. representatives to be aware of students' feelings and to act acco~dingly. Secondly, it is their responsibility to keep students .informed about current issues affecting them. It is because I do not think the Student Forum is even attempting to accomplish these objectives that I have decided to run. This ·is not to mean that the individtial that gets eleele\! should .not have ideas of his own, just that they sho\)ld be ·subordinate .to the ideas of the student body. Some issues that T would like to see dealt with include changes in the school calenqar, a ·reevaluation of the Comprehensive Education llrogram and most importantly, greater student participation and infiuence. In the past, student sentiment has not been adequately represented. It is time .that this sentiment becomes influential and if elected I will do ever-ything in my power to effect this end. Sincerely, JAME~ 'LIPPMAN Murray Levison As a candidate for the Sophomore Representative to the Student Forum for I 976-77 I feel it is necessary that the class of '1979 :know some things about me, and why I feel I am more than qualified for this .position. Student government is definitely not new t.o me. I have run for office every year since 7th grade, and will continue to do. Although I do not condemn those people who believe that they are here strictly for an· education, and do ·not get involved in any activities. 1 get a big sense of satisfaction in helping my ·fellow ·students get what they feel is important. but want someone else to get it for tllem. My maiti eKperience · has. included: Vice- President of my Junior Class; President of my Senior Class; Chairman of the Sixth-Annual Hike for HOPE in Rochester,. N.Y. which raises money for Project HOPE (an international medical and teaching organization), and last year had W,OOO people hiking and raised over $1 00,000; Co- ordinator of this year's freshman Student Host Program which found places for High School Seniors to stay· on campus; and Chainnan of this year's Security Committee. These positions have enabled me to learn how to effectively deal with fellow students, faculty, ·administrators, and prominent .businessmen. I believe that these traits will be extremely important if I am elected to represent my class in the Student Forum. The penon elected has to know how to effectively argile with administrators and get his point across. I believe I can,do this. If 1 am elected, I will try to be as' open minded as possible. I will hear both sides of the issue, gather as much information as possible, and try to decide· intelligently. But most importantly, J will try to reconcile the differences between two widely held .representation theories: The Mirror Theory which states that the representative should reflect exactly what his constituents say; and the Burkean Theory, which states that because the constituents elected ybu as their leader, they are putting faith in you ·to study the facts carefully and decide lor yourself what is right. I will l!lways try to make myself available for those who wish to ask questions or express their views. I can be reached at427 West, 370·6703. Thank you. MURRA \' A.

PETER MARRS Leslie Okladek Hi! I'm Leslie Okladck and I'm running for sophomore class representative. l'his ·Office entaib the .representation of our class on both the Student Forum and the Alt-Col.lege simultaneously. The Student Fo(um, as many of you·know, deals with matters such as th~ calendar system, ·housing, educational policy, the arts vs. athletics controversy, Student tax ,allocations, etc., while the AU-College Senate addresses itself to such issues as the college. budget, planning and P.riorities, etc., and acts in an advisory ·capacity to the president. Many new and innovative changes will result as of the addition of our new Dean of Faculty to the administration. One of the main concerns of both governmental bodies will be to help .in formulating an educational philoSOJ:!hY for the school; something which is ill-defined at the present, This would involve a decision as lo whether the college ought to promote a career-miented philosophy toward education, or a traditional liberal-arts one. Therefore, one of my most important· tasks will be to represent the class on this, as well as other ·relevant issues. By \represent\ I mean not just presenting my own· opinions at council meetings, but also seeking out the opinions of the student body, by polls and questionnaires if necessary. One. of the major faults with the system as it stands now, I think, is that there is not enough easy access to student government meetings, although they are open to the public, because the times and locations of the meetings vary and are not well publicized. (This year's town meeting succumbed to such faulty publicity.) Furthermore, there is no freshman representative to the Student Forum, an office which might have considerable merit if it were incorporated into the present government structure. Admittedly, .1 will be coming into this position without any prior experience·, save Jor some student-council flings of high school days. What 1 will be ·coming in with is .a genuine concern for making improvements, a sincere intent to keep the class informed and represented, and a lack of intimidation by faculty and administrators for seeking solutions to problems. What 1 hope to gain is ·a .realistic view .of what can 'and can't be accomplished, and a competence in understanding the governmental structure and ultimately attacking problems and effecting change. (As evidence of my interest in these matters, I have applied for positions on various committees, primarily the Educational Policy Comm., which I hope to sit on if I am not elected.} If you have any questions aboui my· proposed office or about my campaign in general, .feel free to reach me at 401 West, or phone 346-9414, in the afternoon or night. And be sure to vote on Tuesday, May 11th, in Carnegie Hall. Thanks, LESLI~ OKLADEK Karen Osterweil I feel that I am a qualified candidate to run for Sophomore Representative. I feel that there should be a twelve point grading system. This would entail the distribution of pluses and minuses. Students appraisal will then be more accurately defined. Students whose .grades are in the low tenth of the division (i.e. 70) as compared to the other end of the spectrum. (i.e. 79) should be given different recognition. I am backing the plan to change Comprehensive Education courses to Distribution Requirements. A student would then pe required to take certain courses in specific departments outside their major. As an eKample, Economic 10 would be considered a Distribution Requirement if it was outside someones major. To me, one of the prime issues is concerned with student-faculty relations. Many of the faculty members believe that sini:e they are here longer than the students, they therefore have a more substantial vote for decisions pertaining to the school. Each class of students that enter Union have ·different needs and desires. T eaehing methods and organizations must be centered around what is occuring now, not what has happened in the past. We, the students, must · reach these members of the faculty so that they will see our point of view concerning present issues. Students should have more say on committees that they are participating in. Too many faculty members don't want to hear students' views. An example is when they discuss tenure .. Students have little voice in this matter. There should be a decrease in apathy concerning issues at Union. More students shouid be urged to get involved with the school. If this happens and students' interests increase, then possibly professors will. see our view points and listen with an intent to change. The school's MADISON'S.

There should be more activities sponsored by the sophomore class for the entire student body. T\bis would bring our class together and get more students involved. I feel that! have showed a large interest in the school. l am working to organize a symposium at the end of May; I was also .involved in the Plti Beta Kappa weekend. I gave a conference at my former high school to encourage applicants to Union. I feel that I will' work hard and get issues passed on the Forum. My full' effort will be shown if elected to· office. As representative of the sophomore-class, I would represent your ideas and seek your problems and. disappointments. Only after that will I speak OUR opinion in front of the Forum. If there are any questions please contact me at 370-64'39, Fox 217. KAREN OSTERWiilL David Rubin We have now been part of the Union College community for a full school year and have encountered things Of which we disapprove of, are annoyed by, are enthused by, .or just don:t care about. This latter feeling seems ·to have become widespread due to the fact that the \average\ student: shares. a small role in the affairs of the school. It is for this reason I 'have declared my candidacy for Sophomore representative. 1 advocate the use of either polls of referendums put to the general student body on such important issues as the Academic Calendar. The Student Forum could be made into a viable \sounding- board\ for siudent viewpoint in the decision- making process. Being a member of both the Forum and the College Senate, I would try· to represent my class's opinions on tlte issues. in conjunction with my own sense of fairness. It would be ridiculous for me to promise that .I alone as a student representative could bridge the gap between the Student-College government and the student himself but my efforts would -be pointed into thiS direction. ' DAVID RUBIN Marc Seltzer Can Student Government fulfill it's major function as the forum for student opinion and ideas? Is the relationship between student representatives and the students themselves a. strong one, and are the avenues for communication easily accessiable to the student body? FinaUy, are the voices of both the student repre~;ntatives and the general student body being heard by the \Co !Ieger' It is without doubt that a critical need now exists for .a greater diversity of student input· intQ the student government system. Both the Student Forum and lite College Senate must open it's doors to the entire student community. Representatives must remember lhat their .~me. responsibility is to act as representative~. and. must learn to seek out student opiniom. Representatives must keep in touch with their constituency and make a considerable effort to 'inform students on \what is.going on.\ ·Indeed, there are a variety of ways in which ·to achieve a visible interaction between students and their representatives. They include·, first, \highlights\ of minutes from both the Student Forum and the AU-College Senate should be publicized in Concordy and WRUC, so that students will •lle informed as to what is actually going on· in ·these meetings. Secondly, meetings should be held on set dates and times, and publicized throughout the campus, so to insure that those students interested in attending specific meetings may plan to do so. ·!.astly, the ''mini- town meeting\ proposal should ·be ·enacted so. that students can express their feelings in a smaller, more informal. atmosphere. Representatives 'have made an effort to improve the communication flow through such means as individual student forum reports on RUC. This is a step in the right direction, yet an even greater effort should be made to inform· students. In addition, there are a considerable number of important issues which will be facing student government representatives next year, and should nave a significant affect on the direction of the Union Community. 1. Students should have an active voice in the tenure process, specifically in the decision making or appeals prCJcess. 2. The Comp-Ed structure will again be up for analysis, and should be revised. 3. The student tax proceedure should be improved, and Representatives should woik .to find a more equitable way of distributing funds to the different clubs·and organizations. 4. Students have, through experience, found that they have -little\ .power on imponant issues before the all-college senate. It .is my belief that t~is should be rectified, so that students will have a voice in setting College policy, which in the end run affects the students themselves. Through my involvement in Committee work., I have developed a strong interest in the affairs of student government. This interest will lead me to devote a considemble amount of my time and. effort to the Student Forum (and the all-College Senate), in order to improve the eKisting student government system. Finally, in the past, Union College elections have been characterized by a very small percentage of students voting. Hopefully, with the importance of the up-coming elections, students will vote in .greater numbers. Thank you. MARK D. SELTZER Junior reps Continued from Page 8 Dan Rosenbaum Student Government at Union is finally settling down after several years of confusion. In the last four years, there have been four forms of governance. Now that the school has found a system that seems to work, it is possible to acComplish much. The \revolution\ of the .late '60s is over, and students, faculty, and administration are now trying to solve the problems that were brought up during that era. And for the first time in years, Union has the stability to deal with those problems. It is my intention to run for the office of Junior Class Representative. I am running because I am concerned about many issues now facing the campus. I believe that the Comp. Ed.-Freshman Elective system is in need of revision. The question of student involvemei1t in tenure decisions is a major one, and . needs to be examined. The recurring question of grade inflation is urgent, and needs to be resolved. You probably also can think of a few things that need changing. I don\t pretend to know all the issues or all the answers. I will actively seek your gripes and opinions both before and after the election. Concern is not enough to be an effective representative, though. Through my activities in my fraternity, I have acquired a zest for and skill at parliamentary politics. I am currently sitting on the Ad Hoc Committee to find a new Head Librarian, so I am not a total stranger to tlte governance system. My post at WR·UC requires me to be an effective administrator, as well as a good speaker and listener. No matter what a person's qualifications. though, no one can promise to do everything immediately. Anyone who tells you that is putting both himself and you on. All 1 can do is to promise you that I will do my level best. I honestly believe I am the best choice, but even if you don't agree, I urge you to go down to Carnegie Hall this Tuesday and vote. •It is your best chance to shoVI your concern and your sentiments. DAN ROSENBAUM Jeff Scheininger My name is Jeff Scheininger .and I am running for Junior Class Representative. In the course of the next two years, Union College will be faced with a myriad of problems. Rising tuitions, financial aid; the salvaging of the Nott Memorial, conflicting building preferences, the faculty v~ting block in the College Senate, distributing procedures for Student Tax dollars, ongoing problems with Saga Food Service, and restocking and updating Schaffer Libjary, are but a few of these major problems. Whether or not our class has a say in any of the possible solutions which may be offered for these problems is, I'm t.afraid, dependent upon how loud we yell and upon how milch decision making power we can wrest from the administration. I am not naive enough to think that we (the students) run !his college, and who knows, maybe we shouldn't, but I do think that we should have some say in what goes on around here. Student opinion is not just the opinion of those kids interested enough to get involved in committees and in Student Government. For $6,000 a year, every student on this campus, and in our class, has formulated ideas and .possibly solutions for many of the Campus's problems. Representing these opinions, for everyone in our class. is what the job ofJr. Class Rep. is all about. I can do this job. I will be receptive to ideas, and I will listen to problems. Being all things to all people is impossible, but being a sounding board for our Classes opinions is possible. I hope that you will vote for me in the upcoming election, and give me, Jeff Schcininger (it's a long name and 1 ·had to fit it in .ag~in somewhere) the opportunity lo represent you and your views of the priorities at this College.

He was shelled· by just ab<)ut every Siena ball player, finally beiQg lifted after ·five innings with the score Siena: 9, Union: 0 .. The game wasn't aU Siena however, as the Dutchmen got untracked scoring three runs in the. seventh, and eight mote in the ninth. Too. bad Union was facing Siena's batting practice pitcher · in these later · innings, The bi~ bats for the Garnets were RandY Ruschak and Don Milder who each smacked three vicious base hits .. John Busterud, Dan DeGregory, Gary Borgese, and Chris Massaroni collected two hits apiece. Now the good news. Freshman pitcher Paul Brown twirled a. seven hitter and had a shut out for 6 2/3 innings before a stranded turkey pranced home from third -on an untimely Union error. Although the Dutchmen were outNhit, they made the most of every scoring opportunity. Bunching three hit!! and two walks together, Union scored four runs in the fourth inning. Don Milder started things off with a single, followed by betrothed Dan DeOregory who lined a double to the gap· in left center. Gary Borgese walked to load·the bases, Jerry Logan alsowalkedtoforceint one run, . then the mighty. Babe came to bat. Randy Ruscbak lifted a sing!~ to right clearing all three bags and making the . score U nion-4, RPI-0. The Gamet stEuck for two more run.s in the sixth, with Gary Borgese and Randy Ruschak collecting key doubles, and John Busterud ·knocking · in the sixth and deciding run with a .sharp liner to left.

Boxing a main • stay 1n gym On the evening of April 20th, Union College hosted its second Annual Intramural Boxing tournament, held in the Alumni Gym. !The action started off af p.m. with the lightweight fight between Nate (Skate) Keever and Ray Walker. The bout lasted for 3-2 minute rounds with Mr. Walker taking a hard earned decision. The. middle weights were the crowd pleasers. The I st bout in this class was between Jerry Kirby and Leonard Lee. Indeed this was an exciting match, with Kirby coming out for action. But Lee was too polished and knocked Kirby out, in the opening minute of the first round, with a right uppercut which came off the floor. Jerry recovered and is in good shape now! The elimination final of the middeweights pitted Lee with quick little Bill Brimmier. Their match was a perfect exhibition of boxing with a show of good handwork and blocks. It was a split decision awarding the edge to Lee again. ln -the· light heavy weights Darryl Hamilton of Fiji an5i Pete Delahunt squared off, and almost shook the building down to its foundation. For 3 rounds they fought their all out best. The decision as usual was close, with Hamilton taking the verdict. However, Hamilton still wasn't out of the dark, he had to face the winner of the match between Fred Bartow andAndy Rosenthal.This too was a good exhibition of boxing and sportsmenship. Barrow with his longer reach and quick combinations pounded out a decision over the ·game Rosenthal. As a result, the finals of the light heavies had Darryl Hamilton and Fred Barrow in the Ring, Hamilton as usual came straight at his man cutting the rine i.n half throwing a steady barrage oflefts and rights similar to. Joe Frazier. Although Barrow tried to dance and use his long reach he just couldn't keep the aggressive Hamilton away. The result was a unanimous victory for Hamilton. . ....... ,.._. ~- .f¢.'..-:>11 .,. ~ ......... _-t'- ~ ~ ' The last bout was between the only heavyweights and was one all were waiting for. The match was between tough· Davy Wilson and the well conditioned Alan Hertzberg. The fact that both boxers displayed good skills, instead of brawling made the fight much more exciting and surprising to tlte croV(d. ··Wilson was the leader going into the 3rd round, but the first two roundS drained him of his energy, and Hertzberg being in better condition took the advantage, and narrowed Wilson's lead, to win the decision. Judges were Bob Dl'iscoll, Rich Easton, and Bruce l)avis. The referee. Was Chris Smith. Smith noted that marty of the contestants were from his boxing class and showed considerable improvement over the fighters from last year. \This year all of the participants put a. lot of time in preparing for this night, and everybody that fought had a good time and no one aside from Kirby was hurt.\ Boxing classes will be continued for the rest of the term. Anyone interested is welcome to come out. For fur·ther information contact Chris Smith or Bob Driscoll at Alumni Gym. 374-5921 'GEORGE'S M.USIC STORE ·Student Discount!! . SOl Stii~J ~.

In 1952 the Delphics sponsored a Freshmen Tutoring Service \for Freshmen who. . • found getting acquainted with Minerva's wisdom slightly difficult.\ And finally, in 1958, it must be noted that the Oelphics played a role in assisting the Infirmary on polio and llu shots and also ran the Blood Drive. (It must have been a Delphic Society of Pre-Meds in ·ss.) Mr. Henry Swanker, then serving as Director of Alumni Relations, remembers forming the initial Delphic group for the sole purpose of organizing the Fir;st Parents Day at Union. He chose the hea(is of all the major activities on campus and intended them to be a service organization only. Mr. Swanker said that .. unfortunately we decided to give them a dinner to thank them\ and they have since been a self-perpetuating honorary service organization. As Parents Day grew into Parents Weekend and placed increasingly into the lap of the Annual Fund Office, \the Delphics became a spare wheel on the wagon\ and such they have been, in recent years, especially. · There does not appear to be any overwhelming need for an honorary service organization at Union. l would like to suggest that a student Parents Weekend Committee be created under the auspices of the Committee on Committees, to operate in conjunction with the various other individuals involved in the planning .of Parents Weekend. At the same time, if the College feels strongly that some sort of honor be bestowed upon a select group of students who have contributed a great deal to Union, then I suggest that the honor be accorded to Seniors only. ln that way, we can all have our cake and eat it too. Parents Weekend will go on while 'the paradox that it is ' an honor to serve coleslaw will not, and those students who have earned recognition will be duly recognized by the College and not just by their self-perpetuating 'colleagues.'

Anti~.Semitism I - Discrimination Student lmpofe·nce A.n Eq,uitable Proposal by frederi(k a. elliston department of philosophy As many on this campus already realize, sedous discrepancies exist in the teaching and research work of people in various departments and disciplines. Some faculty teach seven different courses each year; others teach as few as four. Some faculty receive credit fot independent studies to reduce their course load; others receive no ctedit whatsoever but accept independent studies inaddition to their regular seven ,courses. Some faculty .have been allowed to teach fewer courses so that they could finish up their research (e.g., a Ph.D. dissertation or article); others have received no such ·relegse time ,for their research. And· some faculty devote enough time and effort to committee work to equal at least one additianal · ·course; _pthers spend only a marginal amount 'of their time on such college activities. The existence of these inequities has a demoralizing impact on the campus. \'Why should some faculty be required to carry a greater burden than others? They also place members of some departments or divisions at an unfair disadvantage when it comes to tenure: if not all fculty carry the·same load, then not all faculty have the same time for course work and research; to judge everyone who comes up for tenure by a uniform standard for research and. teaching is clearly unfair. to teaching and receive credit for developing a new course.

This difficulty is serious, b1.1t not insurmountable.

Many feel that the college rewards those professors that give Union a better reputation by means of publishing and research.

In interviews with six junior faculty, only one stated that teaching ability appears to be the main criteria considered in rewarding professors.

It proposed a flexible loading system which, if applied uniformly, would help to ensure equality· in course loading and research opportunities. The principle of flexibility that it embodies is important in order to allow faculty to develop their strengths whle maintaining an equal division of labor. It allows people to · receive credit in the three areas stressed by the college: teaching, research and coll~agpeship. Most important, it allows each faculty member to shift his or her priorities in any given year in order to make the maximum contribution to the life of the college.

Some professors are judged by senior faculty who have not successfully fulfilled the criteria of judgement. Many of the junior faculty interviewed stress the politics involved in ·the decision making. Some believe that it comes down to who likes you and who doesn't. ''Tenured faculty gain a sense of self worth through the tyranny of exercise because of their positions of authority,\ says one. \You can seemingly fulfill all the requirements but then come under the tyranny of self serving appraisals.\ The· same professor speaks of the faculty judges as people seeking ego boosts.

When asked about research in general, almost all interviewed said that the college's expectations were far too high. Most said that lack of money and time were blockades to good research. One professor said that in the past two years he has had to teach no less than fourteen different courses at Union. A science professor said that the lack of a fully developed graduate program made research difficult. Another simply stated, \People under pressure to do research don't d'o' good· research.\ What many of the junior faculty are saying is that they are under too much pressure from superiors to pull away from benefitting their pupils in order to plunge into research. Others say that they are used to \fight old battles\ in certain departments, and decisions are made from purely political standpoints. For a college that prides itself in heing a cohesive community, there seems to be a lot of harmful animosity het ween all factions. ·

~ · Page 2A : .·. Union Colleg~. Campus Voice May 5, 1976 Four years at Union College has taught\ me that the only way to change things here is to play politics. Looking through the articles in this newspaper one can't help note the dissatisfaction of many segmentsof the college, including faculty, students and staff. The problems have existed for ages but the solutions seem no more apparent now than they were four years ago. Yet, the persistence of the complaints shows that people still do care, and still do believe that they can, to a degree, affect change~. It seems that the major problem with the people at Union is that they are too idealistic, it is assumed that all you have -to to do is talk about a problem, take a vote, and it will go away. Of course there are fits of depression where students declare .. that they will never do another thing for Union, but for the most part .the active core continues to write, attend meetings, talk, vote, and accomplish very little. The growing discussion, anger and frustration surrounding the tenure process in recent months should prove two things to the members of the Union \community\: first, that some of the issues with which we deal so lightly, merely following the tide . of popular support if and when it exists, are very serious issues and affect the livelihood and means of support for some people who have invested time and energy into Union College. Second the tenure issue should also finally prove to students that talking and signing petitions is just not enough, the votes have to be gott~n for reforms in the Senate. And the votes should be there before a count is taken. The students in government have just begun to realize the importance of a student bloc in the Senate. It is now time for the rest of the campus to realize the importance of electing people who can deliver the faculty votes in order to obtain a majority, of choosing student trustees who are respected by the trustees but who also have enough nerve and character to stand up to the members of the Board and voice and fight for student issues, and. to support . students who are willing and capable of drafting and redrafting concrete proposals for change at Union. I leave Union with a sense of urgency -. questioning whether the defeats of the last few years have created total apathy. on campus. I leave Union with a sense of fear- questionning whether elections have been treated too lightly for too long, so that the candidates and students voting ne longer really care. Yet I also leave Union with a good feeling, which I suppose is ye ole' Union optimism, it may take more than just complaining and the signing -of petitions to accomplish change but it will get done. After all it has to - we just have too much to lose.

Michael Ganz, Michael Kramer, Lee lUmsky,. Richard A. Siegel The W:rath of Roth by tindy greenspan and ntatrjie· kohn Pre~medical students in virtually all cases utilize the Pre- Meciical Boar<!. of Union College. As juniors, they meet together and are instwcted on procedures (Or. Roth spoke this year). These students are routinely given a waiver · which, upon signing, forbids them from seeing their . recommendations. The waiver is, a carefully worded document - Dr. Roth further stressed this by stating that several lawyers as well as other professionals have screened the form. Waiver Before discussing the situation at Union College, we feel that an explanation of the necessity of the waiver .is important. According to most professors, as well · as Medical School Admissions Committees, recommendations lose some of their impact when professors know that their students will be reading them. The reason for this is that ma11y professors feel . tb.at they cannot write candidly whep they know students will have access to these recommendations. This, in turn, leads Medical School Admission officials to take these recommendations less seriously. As Dr. Roth pointed out, this is. a detrimental situation for Union College students. He cited several · cases. in which Union students who had average cum's and boards but glowing recommendations gained admittance to medical sdhools - wh,ere students from other schools with the same boards and cum's were rejected. Dr. Roth stressed the importance of recommendations and the need of cQnfid.entiality to insure the · integrity and honesty of these recommendations. We applaud the desire of medical !IChoQls' admissions officials to personalize the admissi<>ns . ,procedure·. We cannot condone,. however, the need for secrecy. We believe that students have a right to see their recommendations ~ letters which may v<:~Y well' direct their entire lives. At Union we are faced with a questionable situation. After interviewing several junior pre- medical students, we were astonished to finc:l that they were actually given little chOice about examining their recommendations. With caref'ully chosen words, they were told by Dr. Roth that if·they did not sign the waiver form, their recommendations would probably be tempered -artd that other . professors would be informed of this decision. We belive that students should have the right to make t,he decision as to examining their recommendations without concern for any of the implied consequen~es. Alternatives We ate careful not •to attach any unnecessary blame to the Pre- Medic;al Board of Union. We do believe that alternatives exist which would make the Suckley Amendment a reality for o1.1r students. · We suggest that these students not be asked to sign a waiver; whether or not these students wish to see their recommendations will be an option left to their own · discretio.n. Professors, meanwhile would not knew which ·recommendations would be read and which would not. Medical Schools would receive a cover letter stating. that Union College, as an institution, supports its students in their right ,to see their recommendations. It would further explain that professors were unaware of whether students would be readin·g their recommendations or not, thereby putting all recommendations on the same level. This solution in itself is not a perfect one. 'two problems stiU exist The. first is that most professors do not relish the idea of explaining to students why they wrote the recommendation as they did. The second difficulty lies in getting Medical Schools to accept Union's position. Time for Chllnge · We do feel that regardless oi the problems mentioned above, it is time for a, change. :Pre-medical · student$ shoutd not feel afraid to express their opinions and it is time that this matter was dealt with openly. 'We ae. concerned that no pre- medical student ·volunteered to write this article even though they felt strongly about this issue, or would even allow us to use their names because of the possible repercussions. WolDen's: Sports Foul· Play REPORT ON WOMEN'S SPORTS by donna sockell In order to ascertain Union College's compliance with the provisions of Title IX, a ea-teful review of many aspects of Union. College has been completed by both the faculty and administration. Discrim.ination against female students, although apparent in many areas -of the college, 11eems to be most prevalent in the athletic program. As a female athlet~. l anxiously awaited the results of the department's self evaluation. I ·crefully read through the eight pageexamination1£!..'rious to find the \delicate areas\s '' where discrimination was shown to eKist. These areas were relatively few ,and:easily enumberab~:me;:tl general, pre-season varsity meals, pre-game meals, recruiting policy, etc.. Unfortunately, the justifications for these inequities are so easily available witbin the athletic departmenfs report; meeting game schedul~e commitments, schedu~s of. contests .prior to school, school calendar, maximization of income or revenue from each sport, preparation for game schedule commitments. Perhaps the department as well as the college is satisfied with these excuses, however 1 feel that neither the report nor the prevailing opinion of the women!s athletic program tell the full story. To devote Ill ore money to buying $200 uniforms as opposed to $45 ones or to give $3()0 for recruitment letters instead of $30 (as it now stands) is not the real answer to remedying the failures of the female teams. More importantly, the problems lie in the lack of support and general ;interest of students, faculty, staff members, and admmtstrators. lt is bard to be a diligent athlete, to play with confidence, to have self- esteem when from nowhere do you Eet an impetus. It is true. that one should get a degree of self- satisfaction as she grows close to perfectiQg her athletic ability. However; this is not sufficient to beat teams that have player!l with personal motivation as well as a- gyn;t packed with spectators.

It is not to gain presttge, social power and recognition, it is to represent. Representing our views does not mean getting caught up in the games the system sets up .. It is time for u:; to start addressing persons and not issues. The next logical question to be asked is how we can effect such c·hanges. The first step is all too obvious - we must drop the notion of political positions as serving a means of self . - aggrandizement or for the embellishment of graduate school transcripts. There must .be a commitment': to each other, and a commitment to caring for what happens to others.. The egocentnc approach of \doing your owll thing\ is not only impractical, but ultimately self- destructive. What we advocate is first the creation of a student community, with constructed centers for political and intellectual interaction. This could be accomplished by uniting students in a variety of social and academic milieu. The purpose of such a community is to enable students to achieve impact in the institution. Any faculty, adminstrators, or staff who would want to contribute to such a \giving\ environment would be welcome. :by peter aronson · In a rec.ent college survey it was reported that 25% of the ,students at· Union College have anti- semitic feelings.

We must · At the same time, under the supervison of the new Dean of Faculty, the faculty would band together, with the notion of becoming an interacting body on campus, willing and open to generate and listen to new ideas to build a stronger Union. Reasons For Anti-Se ... itism When questioned about the causes .of Anit-Semitism the majority responded that all the Jews live on Long Island, and are wealthy. The Jews seem. to flaunt their wealth (i.e. clothes, cars). Their \extravagant and boisterous life style\ typifies the Jew, one response stated. This produces a feeling of resentment which turns to anti-semitis.m. a number ot people who sau:t tnetr are m~inly judging the Jews on act and speak out in ways that we contact witfl., anti-semitism was far their outside appearance and the deem fit.

The final step is for all of us on the campus to become a flexible, dynamic, interacting community, where all voices are heard, where all people are working towards the development of better means to educate and nurture the lives of ali involved. Another major reason is that the Jews tend to be more competitive or \throaty as Union lingo might have it. To most students, the majority of students. who are pre-professional here at Union are Jewish. If they are not the majority, they appear to ·be the majority because they stick out. One person polled commenteq ••pre-med~>. pr.e-law, business, I think these are practically the only three fields Jewish people consider.\ Other students saw the anti~semitism grow out of the opinion \J~ want to succeed.

The time has come for us to unite and to build a better Union, a better community. Since most people think that Jews seek jobs that are more financially rewarding the issue of money is again raised. The survey showoo that people at Union think Jews are more concerned with having money and usiltg it as a status symbol than anything else. Many people polled felt that the .Jews tended t<> ·form cliques and make the non-Jews feel like outsiders. The. feeling of being ai\ outsider can be brought on by difference in socio-economic status. The consensus of the people polled felt that one reason why people hold anti-semitic feelings was because. of their backgtound. The majority of non-Jews here at Union reponed that many were coming into contact with more Jews than at home, or in many cases meeting Jews for the first titne. Therefore their anti-semitic feelings are an outgrowth .of their own lack of awareness. Students feel the family attitudes towards Jews influenced the students a great deal. They were unable. to form their own opinion because they had not come. in contact with man:y Jews. \thus the studertt came .to Union with the so-called •myths' about Jews, such as being hungry for money. These myths were applied to any Jew they met Those ·Who Experience Anti· .Semitbm Of the Jews polled, 70% claimed to have experienced anti~ · semitism, it was tnostly throtrgh sly remarks or · graffiti on the walls in the bathrooms.

Some departments are <)pviously more receptive to varyin~ attitudes and teaching styles than others. Their problems and successes also depend on just how much difference in treatment they are aware ofwithin their department or willing to accept, or not tolerate in interactions with . their colleagues and 11tudents. Some women faculty are not aware of or do not mind incidents that ·annoy others. It is evident, then,that some problems arose because ·they would not change to comply with what appears to he a code at Union, or did change and then felt uncomfortable for having done so. Thus there are quite a few explicit roleexpectationsof the female faculty. This iswhere these women faculty.£annot help but lose. Ihey.canllQt.passiblydilleUp.to everyone's ideal perceptions of thern. First Impressions The women. faculty were asked about their first impressions of Union, specifically if they had to learn to be more assertive, or tone down their assertiveness with respect to their collegues. The answers to this question clearly reflected theh:- own varying personalities, the differences in the make-up of their departments, and the differences in their students. Two had to learn to be more assertive (one of whom said it was more because of the transition from student to teac~e.r t~an because of any sex discrimination), one had to tone it down· (which she .resented), and the rest made no changes. One, for the first time in l}er Ufe, encountered opposition because of her assertiveness. · Sexist Demands They were next asked if the male professors put any demands on them that they considered sexist. The majority of the women said yes, one of whom was asked to be a secretary fdi' two committees she served on. When they were asked if they had to put Up with any •token woman' jokes, three women stated that they had no trou~le in this ·respect, whereas the remaining three did. One female professor was called a \smart girl.\ (Try imagining a male professor with a Ph.D. getingcalled a \smart boy\). Another point made was that in the faculty manual, faculty spouses are referred to as \faculty wives.\ This seems indicative of the philosophy of what sexual gender a .professor is .at 'Union. Reactions The women were asked how they perceived the tnale professors' reaction to them, and while four reported no problems with the male professors, the others thought they felt threatened and uncomfortable. One of these who thought the males were uncomfortable stated, \Competent women are a thteat hut, then, so from each other five replied yes, that they do have the sense of being in the minority, and one said maybe. English Professor Elizabeth Mansfield said that it iwas difficult to get to know other women ·faculty because of the ••revolving door' situation here; women professors are toooften hired for temporary positions and leave after a year or two. As a result the women faculty at Union do not feel a ~teal sense. of community. Expectations Women Faculty were also asked if students seem to expect more or less of them than they do &f male professors. Psychology Professor Susan Britain said that the students were in a powerless position to let them know. Another said that women faculty were .expected .te ·be Jess :eo-mpetent. than male faculty. . Economics -Profesror Caroiyn Kent, who teaches Finance, a traditionally male- dominated field, explained that some students expected more of her because they felt that she must be competent to be in a man's field. Others felt that she could not possibly have a mind for Finance. Professor Mansfield said that in her (traditionally woman's) field, students did. not expect anything different from her. ihe last question concerned itself with the interactions between women faculty and female students. Whether woman faculty were looked towards..as role modes for encouragement in career goals, identifying with another woman who has achieved etc .. Four women professors said definitely yes, that female students spoke to them. about non-academic matters. Another said that during her first year here she felt that students were hto+ile toward her, which has since changed. The sixth doesn't want t .msh them since they J.leed to do it for themselves. Professor Kent said that she has few women .students since bet field has been defined as a traditionally male field. ln reviewing the questions and responses, it appears obvious that some of these women's needs simply are not being met here. Some confessed that they are very lonely here, finding it difficult to break into the male-dominated, married, established, middle aged and middle class faculty we have here. These women never achieved a sense of ease here, or at least had a difficult time in orienting themselves to what is here. As Economics Professor Irene Lurie states, .. While Union may be ma-king an effort to hire women, I do not think they are taking affirmative action to keep them here.'· On the other hand, some of the women faculty claim that they've had no prQblems because of their sex whatsoever here. One of these conceded that she has encountered enough classic sexists among the faculty, she doesn't find them offensive any more, she says, because they are so entrenched in their own ways, that they aren't worth reacting to. She added that other colleagues .she works closely with tend to lean to the opposite extretne and, she thinks, respect her as they do their male colleagues .

Bill Auger - Sophomore I think a good professor is one who is concerned about the students, one who knows ·his material, and one who is willing to take time to relate to students on their level instead of his. The school definitely agrees with that but they don't actually promote it. Linda Cohen- Freshman A good professor is involved in the subject, is interested in what they are teaching, tries to put information . across in the best manner possible, and genuinely likes their students as people. Basically the college agrees. 1 think that's why people are here. I like a professor who's more personable. Howard Lee - Sophomore A good professor is someone who's always available for extra help, is a good lecturer, and is motivating enough that people actually learn something from the course. It seems like there are 1 a lot of professot;.s who aren't Susan Freeman -Sophomore The · important thing is availability to the students who need help. A professor should be flexible in meeting student's needs and his own personal interests should come out in his lectures. He shouldn't just read off his notes, he should be more enthusiastic about it. I wouldn't say that most professors are like that, but that's probably what the school wants to see. ,, ~ ' ~ David Eilbott - Junior The mark of an excellent professor is one who can make any topic interesting. He can keep the students' attention even though the subject matter might not be too interesting, by applying the. force of his own personality. I think the administration tries to get the best faculty possible, however, I ' think that the tenure process does not really push for these qualities to the extent that I'd like to see them pushed. qualified to lecture and who are often not available to the student. It seems like Union doesn't have a good idea of whal a good professor should be. Ann Taub- Junior I think the administration feels that a good professor is someone who can write well or is an expert on a small subject, and I don't agree with that. A good professor has to . be a good U:acher; not necessarily a good writer and he has to get his point across without boring the students. Professor Kershner - Chairman of the Department of Economics - · .... · · · Learning is an exciting process. It's my job as a teacher to stimulate, to generate, to provide examples, to lecture, to explain, to reinforce; it's my job to stimulate the wqole learning process whether it's in economics or in any other discipline. I think Union faculty generally care very much about ,; teaching. Union does many things formally and informally to stimulate and support good teaching .. A Tenure Proposal Continued from Page tA Foundation, the Humanities Development Foundation, and the Faculty Research Foundation. (3) The scheme would make some faculty second class citizens by accentuating the division between scholars and teachers. This objection raises some far- reaching questions about the 01ientations of different groups of faculty on campus. But as a first response it. should be stressed that the scheme suggested is for loading not evaluating, (lnd operates on a yearly basi!!. It is the task of the Committee on Faculty to. assess the quality of work done and to make judgments about tenure; as well it is the responsibility of the Dean of Faculty and departmental chairmen to help faculty reach the institution's long-term objectives: they bave the power to prevent faculty from becoming 'just scholars' or just teachers' - if these are regarded as objectionable. Finally it is not clear that some measure of 'tracking' into these two categories does. not already exist or that it is indeed so objectionable. The strength of Union College is its diversity and the institution might find it desirable to allow some t'aculty to make a greater commitment to one of the areas. Still Flexible· The details of the 15 point scheme proposed in the Long Range Planning Report are not as important as the principles of ·equity and flexibility that it embodies. The problems for which it (or some variation on it) may provide part of the solution are serious, and deserve wide discussion across the campus as a whole. From the Long Rang' · Planning RepQrt (May 1974) 9.1 Accounting for Faculty Time We are considering new methods of accounting for f;;tculty time which Will allow a greater recognition of a diversity of abilities and interests, while permitting reasonable control to be exercised over the overall investment of · professional resources at the Co'llege. Currently, only teaching loads are accounted fer, the accepted load being .seven courses per year per faculty member. We propose, ill principle, a system which considers a smaller unit of accounting than one-seventh and which permits selected other activi~ies as part of the lo~~l. 'fhe mix of activities comprising faculty members' loads· may differ, and any subsequent evaluation of a faculty member's performance would he with respect to each activity i:1cluded in his load. The total amount of each :activity on campus would be budgeted. to remain within acceptable bounds, but a rich variety of activities would be permitted among · individual Activity faculty members. Thus, it is conceivable that whereas aU of one faculty member's time may be devoted to teaching, another's time .might be partly in student counselling and administration; another may have a larger fraction df research, etc. The entire faculty effort is kept \in bounds'' by. (1) the allocation of weights for various activities, and ·(2) an overall time budget which prescribes, for example, that the average faculty involvement (campus-wide) directly in course . related activities will be, say, 70%, Administration 10%, and reportable !!Cholarship and r~search iO%. We . suggest that these weights and budgets be assigned with full consideration given to the long~range goals and priorities of the College. Below are some illustrative acti¥ities and ·possib)e load units base~ on a total load of 15 units. ··similar. · systems could be deveioped Ol\ the basis of different total units and on the basis of different proportional allocations. Once again, we are in some disagreement about the details presented here, and we bring them forward fpr discussion purpose~: Each course (small to med·ium enrollment) Each course (large enrollment) Units 2 3 Extra section (same course; same term) Bonus for each new course Theses and independent studies ; Chairman of Dor;toral committe~ Preceptor (advising) Department chairman Chairman major committee Major committee membership Reportable Research and Scholarship I I 1-3 l 2 2-4 ,2 1 l-7 No Appeal The allocation of the time budget to departments . and individual faculty members would be negotiated, subject to the constraints on averages. \..:outinued from Page lA department or the college, of the standards that would be used to evaluate hisjher tenurability. Should an individual be evaluated by the standards made clear to him/her, or the standards in effect at the time? This appears to create a discrepancy between who is being protected, the system or the individual, Dr. Jonas appeared more. concerned with protecting the system than. being responsible to the individual. \What does it do to- the next person up the line, if you judge what was done.\ (Instead of what was wanted.) Student Input When questioned about student input, he stated that it should occur when the ad hoc Committee interviewed students and should stop the.re. He stated, ••f do not think that students are the best or very good judges of who should ot should not be tenured.\ The tenure decision \involves a long view that students don't have because they are just passing through.\ Consequently, students have \no basis to make judgements how good the person will be ten years from now.\ Author's View Dr. Jonas' responses to q.uestions on the appeals procedure and the recent. decision of the i>.A.B. not to consider the appeal of Professor Howard Berthold in what was obviously a very controversial decision raises serious questions about whether this college has an appeal process. In fact, whether this pFOcess is simply an image without substance. On one hand, Dr. Jonas has stated the lact that the President sits on the P.A.B. causes that body to be the unique committee to hear appeals. At the same time, however, Dr. Jonas negates the ability of the President to become involvei:i in the appeal (the Profelsor Jonas \President.frequently has no basis for judging at all.\) This apparent contradiction coming from the Chairman of the committee that is charged to hear appeals, leads this author to conclude that only lip service has been given to an appeal procedure. It is extremely upsetting to be told that the college will not be responsible when it has allowed an individual to be misinformed of the standards upon which he 1 she will be evaluated. Th·is is a grave injustice to members of the college community. Furthermore this reporter was amazed to hear Dr. Jonas state the archaic opinion that students are incapable of making meaningful decisions on who is best qualified to direct their learning. Consequences Attitudes and policies such as these can have no effect other than to destroy morale on campus and weaken Union as a learning institution.

Page 4A May 5, 1975 Union College Campus V_~iee - ------· ------------·----·-------·--·---------'-- .. _, __ ·------·----·- ------------- Roving Reporter by jan rosker and seth okun QUESTION: What do you think makes a good professor, and do you think the administration agrees with this? l Linda Cohen- Freshman A good professor is involved in the subject, is interested in what they are teaching, tries to put information , across in the best manner possible, aad genuinely likes their students as people. Basically the college agrees. I think that's why people are here. I like a professor who's more personable. Bill Auger - Sophomore 4, l think a good professor is one who is concerned about the students, one who knows his material, and one who is willing to take time to relate to students on their level instead of his. The school definitely agrees with that but they don't actually promote it. Susan Freeman- Sophomore The · important thing is availability to the students who need help. A professor should be flexible in meeting student's needs and his own personal interests should come out in his lectures. He shouldn't just read off his notes, he should be more enthusiastic about it. I wouldn't say that most professors are like that, but that's probably what the school wants to see. David Eilbott - Junior The mark of an ex.cellent professor is one who can make any topic interesting. He can keep the students' attention even though the subject matter might not be too interesting, by applying the force of his own personality. I think the administration tries to get the best faculty possible, however, I think that the tenure process does not really push for these qualities to the extent that I'd like to see them pushed. Howard Lee - Sophomore A good professor is someone who's always available for extra help, is a good lecturer, and is motivating enough that people actually learn something from the course. lt seems like there are a lot of professors who aren't qualified to lecture and who are often not available to the student. It seems like Union doesn't have a good idea of what a good professor should be. Ann Taub- Junior I think the administration feels that a good professor is someone who can write well or is an expert on a small subject, and I don't agree with that. A good professor has to be a good teacher; not necessarily a good writer and he has to get his point across without boring the students. . 1 Professor Kershner Chairman of the Department of Economics · · · Learning is an exciting process. It's my job as a teacher to stimulate, to generate, to provide examples. to lecture, to explain, to reinforce; it's my joh to stimulate the whole learning process whether it\ in economics or tn any other disctpline. I think l'nion faculty generally care very much ahout ,' teaching. IJnl(Jn does many thing~ formally and informally to sttmulatc and support good te<~chmg A Tenure Proposal Continued from Page lA Foundation, the Humanities Development Foundation, and the Faculty Research Foundation. (3) The scheme would make some faculty second class citizens by accentuating the division between scholars and teachers. This objection raises some far- reaching questions about the orientations of different groups of faculty on campus. But as a first response it should be stressed that the scheme suggested is for loading not evaluating, and operates on a yearly basis. It is the task of the Committee on Faculty to assess the quality of work done and to make judgments about tenure; as well it is the responsibility of the Dean of Faculty and departmental chairmen to help faculty reach the institution's long-term objectives: they have the power to prevent faculty from becoming 'just scholars' or just teachers' - if these are regarded as objectionable. Finally it is not clear that some measure of 'tracking• into these two categeries does not already exist or that it is indeed so objectionable. The strength of Union College is its diversity and the institution might find it desuable to allow some faculty to make a greater commitment to one of the areas. Still Flexible The details of the 15 point scheme proposed in the Long Range Planning Report are not as important as the principles of equity and flexibility that it embodies. The problems for which it (or some variation on it) may provide part of the solution are serious, and deserve wide discussion across the campus as a whole. Fro,m the Long Range Planning Report (May 1974) 9.1 Accounting for Faculty Time We are considering new methods of accounting for faculty time which will allow a greater recognition of a diversity of abilities and interests, while permitting reasonable control to be exercised over the overall investment of professional resources at the CoUege. Currently, only teaching loads aFe accounted for, the accepted load being seven courses per yea,r per faculty member. We propose, in principle, a system which considers a smaller unit of accounting than one-seventh and which permits selected other activities as part of the lo[\d. The mix of activities comprising faculty members' loads may differ, and any subsequent evaluation of a faculty member's performance would be with respect to each activity i-Jcluded in his load. The total amount of each activity on campus would be budgeted to remain within acceptable bounds, but a rich variety of activities would be permitted among individual Activity faculty members. Thus, it is conceivable that whereas all of one faculty member's time may be devoted to teaching, another's time might he partly in student counselling and administration; another may have a larger fraction of research, etc. The entire faculty effort is kept \in bounds\ by. ( l) the allocation of weights for various activities, and (2) an overall time budget which prescribes, for example, that the average faculty involvement (campus-wide) directly in course related activities wiU be, say, 70%, Administration 10'%, and reportable scholarship and research 20%. We suggest that these weights and budgets be assigned with full consideration given to the long-range goals and priorities of the College. Below are some illustrative activities and possible load units based on a total load of 15 units. ·Similar systems could be developed on the basis of different total units and on the basis of different proportional aUocations. Once again, we are in some disagreement about the details presented here, and we bring them forward for discussion purposes: Each course (small to medium enrollment) Each course (large enrollment) Units 2 3 Extra section (same course, same term) Bonus for each new course Theses and independent studies Chairman of Doctoral committe~ Preceptor (advising) Department chairman Chairman major committee Major committee membership Reportable Research and Scholarship I I 1-3 I 2 2-4 2 I l-7 No Appeal The allocation of the time budget to departments and individual faculty members would be negotiated, subject to the constraints on averages. umtinued from Page lA department or the college, of the standards that would be used to evaluate his/ her tenurahility. Should an individual be evaluated by the standards made clear to him/ her, or the standards in effect at the time'! This appears to create a discrepancy between who is being protected, the system or the individual. Dr. Jonas appeared more concerned with protecting the system than being responsible to the individual. \What does it do to the next person up the line, if you judge what was done.\ (Instead of what was wanted.) Student Input When questioned about student input, he stated that it should occur when the ad hoc Committee interviewed students and should stop there. He stated, \I do not think that students are the best or very good judges of who should or should not be tenured.\ The tenure decision \involves a long view that students don't have because they are just passing through.\ Consequently, students have \no basis to make judgements how good the person will be ten years from now.\ Author's View Dr. Jonas' responses to questions on the appeals procedure and the recent decision of the P.A.B. not to consider the appeal oi Prolessor Howard Berthold in what was obviously a very controversial decision raises serious questions about whether this college has an appeal process. In fact, whether this process is simply an tmage without ~ubstance. On one hand. Dr. Jonas has >tatcd the fact that the Pn.:sidcnt sits on the P.A.H. causes that body to he the unique comnuttcc to hear appeals. At the same time. hov.cver. IJr. Jonas negate-. the ahihty ot the Pre~:idcnt to become mvolved tn the appeal (the ···ty St ff l . a i~ ii Wages ~r<~ Professor Jonas \President frequently has no bas1s for judging at all.\) This apparent contradiction coming from the Chairman of the committee that is charged to hear appeals, leads this author to conclude that only lip service has been given to an appeal procedure. lt is extremely upsetting to be told that the college will not be responsible when it has allowed an individual to be misinformed of the standards upon which he/she will be evaluated. This is a grave injustice to members of the college community. Furthermore this reporter was amazed to hear Dr. Jonas state the archaic opinion that students are inca.pable of making meaningful decisions on who is best qualified to direct their learning. Consequences Attitudes and policies such as these can have no effect other than to destroy morale on campus and weaken lJ n ion as a learning institution. rhe message being sent to faculty is clearly not to he innovative in the cla\sroom and not to spend time advising students and threctmg student research.

The' Apple Tree is the first full scale musical to be performed in th~ Cabaret. The room has beeri remodeled at great expense and with extreme mental anguish. There will be music and singing and free refreshments during the intermissions. Each performance promises to be a tremendously enjoyable evening. Tickets are on sale now in Student Activities for The Apple Tree. It-will be performed on May 19, 20, 21, 22, 26, 27, 28, 29 (Wednesday~Saturda'y ). The play begins at 8:30. Tickets may be bought between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.. Tickets are priced at $1.00. THERE lS A LIMITED NUMBER OF SEATS, SO BUY YOUR TICKETS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. The show is actually three mini- musicals combined to make a delightful evening. All the shows are based on the same themes - the relationship between man and woman, and what happens when woman gains the \forbidden knowledge\ that she should not have. The first show is \The Diary of Adam and Eve,\ based on a short story by Mark Twain. Jt is a satiric look at the creation of the world and the fall of man. Adam is a strong-willed ass and Eve just wants to peacefully co- exist. The snake offers a solution to Eve's problems, and presents her with an apple. The rest may be history, but history was never this funny. Nadjira, behind the other is an extremely hungry (and not very jolly) tiger. If he chooses the lady, he must marry her. If he chooses the tiger, dinnertime. Barbara knows which door is which, but it doesn't matter. .Each way she loses. But she must choose. As the Balladeer sings: \The deeper we probe the heart of Barbara, the morewe discoverthe outcome's in doubt.\ The final show of the evening is .. Passionella,\ based on a story by cartoonist Jules Feiffer. It is an outrageous parody on the worship we all have for movie stars. Ella, a chimneysweep,wants nothing more than to be a star of the silver screen. Her wish is granted by her fairy godperson. She becomes Passionella, world famous underground movie star. Now all she needs is the right man,with whom to shareit all. He co~es, in th~, form of Flip, The Prince Charmmg. Please do not reveal the surprise ending to this show. Sound like fun'! Well, it is. The Student Activities Office is the place to pick up --your tickets. They're going fast, so you'd better hurry up, or you'll miss one of the most enjoyable shows of the year! The Union College Film Committee Presents \The Lady or the Tiger\ deals with the age old problem of jealousy. Captain Sanjar, a commoner and a soldier, is in love with Princess Barbara (as in barbaric), which is, of course, forbidden. Sanjar's love is put to the supreme test.

As· of today, Concordiensis has no official candidates for the position of editor-in-chief. Having held the position for nearly two terms, we feel qualified to speculate on the treasons behind this situation. During the past two terms, we have made an attempt to bring the newsworthy, cultural, social, and sporting aspects .of the college into focus. Several important decisions have been made at Union during our editorship and we hatl1 hoped the community would subsequently, involve themselves in debate. In this respect we have been a total failure. The 'Letters' column has been iittle more than an open forum for debate on such non-critical issues as: whether or not Star Trek is illogical and whether or not Union's motto should read \We all become brothers ... \ or \We all become one ... \. The column has been the setting for comical bandying between professors as well as a site where organizations can congratulate themselves on their own accomplishments. Issues such as tenure, tuition increases, · the future of Union's Arts Department, and the rapid growth _of athletics continue to go completely ignored. It seems that the community doesn't need a real newspaper, and considers Concordy to be a portable bulletin board. The feedback necessary to maintain a creative, viable newspaper is absent at Union. The potential editor is faced with a problem. Does he make the attempt to wake up this sleeping campus or does he spend two terms sorting 'ride wanted' notices? After 11 issues, we sure as hell don't know. Editorial: athletic scholarships? This week's lead story, • ~ thletes M~y be Receiving Preferred Financial Aid,' is the result of the accidental finding of a computer printout listing the students receiving scholarships at Union and the amount of those scholarships. Peter Berick and Charles Holleman concluded, from calculations performed with the available figures, that while no direct athletic scholarships are given at Union, unusual or preferred treatment may be offered to athletes in doiing out financial aid. While Union is required by law to remain within PCS limits when dispersing financial aid to students, there is nothing to prevent the admissions office from giving a studel)t a higher classification than he would normally get if he were not an athlete. (The higher the classification-the more money given) If this is the case, then there is such a thing as an athletic scholarship at Union; it is just slipping in along with the rest of the financial aid packages given at Union. Rating a student as Al means that the school will give the student as much money as possible (while remaining inside PCS guidelines). This is the equivalent of saying -that the student has something the college wants and will pay for. President Bonner and Jay Shupe suspect that the socio- economic level of one group of athletes, the hockey team, is the justifieable reason they received so much financial aid. While this may be true, the staggering figures for the hockey team and the statistically significant figures for other varsity sports .(with regard to finan~ial aid) seem to indicate that something other than need is being considered when money is dispensed. Perhaps the College's desire to insure a high quality hockey team came into play. Is this why such a high pereentage · of hockey players are on financial aid, and why they are so much above the college average in money received? The fact that many students playing other varsity sports are also above the College average may reflect the College•s desire to build and maintain good programs in these sports. If there is any · supportative evidence for this conjecture, and we feel there is, then how can Union College claim that the athletic scholarship does not exist? . . ' ' . ~ ' . • • ·no 1.ncre~ase by DAVID EILBOTT (Chairman, Tax Committee) and LARRY FEIN (Chairman, '76·'77) ln last week•s Concordiensis editorial, the opinion was stated that the decision not to request an increase in student activity fee was wrong. We question the validity of presenting this edit.oriai since it was written without a direct knowledg<:: of the relevent facts; in fact, upon consideration ·of these facts. it becomes evident that such a student tax increase is unnecessary. . Without an activity fee increase for neX:t year, Student Tax will be operating on a .budget of approximately $.) 50,000 ~ this represents a tot!ll of about $18,000 less than was budgeted for this year; this, however, will not he the case _since envisi'oned cuts totalling about $20,0<lQ w,iH be rnade fm: next year. These cuts are possible for a variety of reasons, including the fact that the Tax Coinmittee will ne .longer fund capital expenditures and als-o that the Social Committee will not .require: J\S much fun,di~g due to its being able to use the Achilles Rink for concerts. As a result of a thorough investigation by the ad hoc committee studying .. the role of student tax .(at this and other colleges), it Was found that of schools comparable to Union only Wesleyan ~$80 pet: year) had a higher student .activities fee than out $75 per year fee. It was understood a~ these colleges that th<:: student activitie!l are to at least make attempts at fundraising in order to partially defray their budgetary .costs. We feel that not only is this a fiscally sound way to op.erate studc,mt tax but that it will result in greater responsibility on the part of a good number of clubs currently in existence here at Union. We believe that :!ly instituting the above student tax policy at)d by keeping the student activity fee at its present level, it is hoped that the student activities wili .be more concerned with their financial stability. This is the direction we feel student tax should take. ...

Issues such as tenure, tuition increases, the future of Union's Arts Departrnent, and the rapid growth of athletics continue to go completely ignored. It seems that the community doesn't need a real newspaper, and considers Coneordy to be a portable bulletin board. The feedback necessary to maintain a creative, viable newspaper is absent at Union. The potential editor is faced with a problem. Does he make the attempt to wake up this sleeping campus or does he spend two terms sorting 'ride wanted' notices? After 11 issues, we sure as hell don't know. Editorial: athletic scholarships? This week's lead story, ·~thletes M~y be Receiving Preferred Financial Aid,' is the result of the accidental finding of a computer printout listing the students receiving scholarships at Union and the amount of those scholarships. Peter Berick and Charles Holleman concluded, from calculations performed with the available figures, that while no direct athletic scholarships are given at Union, unusual or preferred treatment may be offered to athletes in doling out _financial aid. While Union is required by law to remain within PCS limits when dispersing financial aid to students, there is nothing to prevent the admissions office from giving a student a higher classification than he would normally get if he were not an athlete. (The higher the classification-the more money given) If this is the case, then there is such a thing as an athletic scholarship at Union; it is just slipping in along with the rest of the financial aid packages given at Union.Rating a student as Al means that the school will give the student as much money as possible (while remaining inside PCS guidelines). This is the equivalent of saying that the student has something the college wants and will pay for. President Bonner and Jay Shupe suspect that the socio- economic level of one group of athletes, the hockey team, is the justifieable reason they received so much financial aid. While this may be true, the staggering figures for the hockey team and the statistically significant figures for other varsity sports (with regard to financial aid) seem to indicate that something other than need is being considered when money is dispensed. Perhaps the College's desire to insure a high quality hockey team came into play. Is this why such a high pereentage of hockey players are on financial aid, and why they are so much above the college average in money received? The fact that many students playing other varsity sports are also above the College average may reflect the College's desire to build and maintain good programs in these sports. If there is any supportative evidence for this conjecture, and we feel there is, then how can Union College claim that the athletic scholarship does not exist? • no 1ncrease by DAVID EILBOTT (Chairman, Tax Committee) and LARRY FEIN (Chairman, '76-'77) In last week's Concordiensis editorial, the opinion was stated that the decision not to request an increase in student activity fee was wrong. We question the validity of presenting this editorial since it was written without a direct knowledge of the relevent facts; in fact, upon consideration of these facts it becomes evident that such a student tax increase is unnecessary. Without an activity fee increase for next year, Student Tax will be operating on a budget of ap111roxirnately $150,000 - this represents a total of about $18,000 less than was budgeted for this year; this, however, will not be the case since envisioned cuts total'ling about $20,000 will be made for next year. These cuts are possible for a variety of reasons, including the fact that the Tax Committee will no longer fund capital expenditures and also that the Social Committee will not require as much funding due to its being able to use the Achilles Rink for concerts. As a result of a thorough investigatien by the ad hoc committee studying the role of student tax (at this and other colleges), it was found that of schools comlllarable to Union only Wesleyan ($80 per year) had a higher student activities fee than our $75 per year fee. It was und.erstood at these colleges that the student activities ar.e to at least make attempts at fundraising in order to partially defray their budgetary costs. We feel that not only is this a fiscally sound way to operate student tax but that it will result in greater responsibility on the part of a good number of clubs currently in existence here at Union. We believe that by instituting the above student tax policy and by keeping the student activity fee at its pFesent level, it is hoped that the student activities will be more concerned with their financial stability. This is the direction we feel student tax should take. I, ' I i ,

So it only fits that a sport that officiaHy calls itself \The sport of space for the age of space\ would be worth checking out. Sport Parachuting is a new sport for most people, altho1:1gh it has been around since after World War II. Recently, parachuting has taken upon itself to technically advance the sport and its equipment, so that with some good fundamental instruction, anyone can start digging the sport on the first jump. As with any sport, there are many different levels of achievement. But when you start at 2800 feet, it's some beginning! One might wonder why anyone would want to jump out of an airplane with an oversized handkerchief on their back. 1 wondered, too. However, speculation leads to opinions and opinions lead to misconceptions, so I thought I'd find out for real. There was nothing to lose, since I had just blown all my midterms, and l have no summer job. I looked up the local jump club and found one in Johnstown, the Drop Zone Para-Center. It is run by Mike Bogt, a stocky, ro,md faced young man whose dedication and enthusiasm for the sport is evident. Mike is a certified Jump Master and has been parachuting since 1972. Well, contrary to what I had thought, they do not just chuck you out of the plane, but rather you become trained in the basics of the sport in a 3 and one half On Saturday of Parents' Weekend, a piece of art work was removed from the Arts Building.

Because Saturday was too windy for a novice jump, Dave Karl and I wnet through our instruction in the morniag and early aHernoon. Even instruction was a thrill. Ten people on a field practicing falHng and .screaming jump sequences was big fun. Our class consisted of nine men and one woman, althou.e;h ~ik_e informed us that 35% of hts pupils are women. Sunday was the day. As we got ready for the jump, we received the ground rules. A smile as you left the plane earned a bottle of beer, a landing in the trees cost a case of beer, and a landing on the runway cost you a soFe ass! We had the (dis)advantage of seeing some others come down before us, and it. was beginning to make sense. I was nuts. Going up in the plane, reality tightened its knot in my stomach. l was anxious, and scared. Mike opened the ·door and 1 stepped outside,holding onto a bar. I smiled, and let myself go. You might imagine what it is like to be 3000 ft. in the air, t1oating down towards earth, and earth like you have never seen before; your body in a place where it has never been before. If you know what it is like to jump into water, and have no idea how deep it is, and you can not seem to find the bottom, now imagine the water is crystal clear and you can see half a mile down, and imagine yourself sinking slowly down to the bottom, listlessly, effortlessly, descending all the way down. lt might start to give you a feeling of what parachuting is like. As l approached the ground, I realized I was headed for the trees, another member of the bushwacking club. At a few hundred feet after minutes of weightless space, Terra Firma made ·. its reappearance. Dave landed 'm tlte ample field space alloted to us. We both j.oined our space mates in promising to get back as soon as possible. Mike runs his center regularly on Satu.rdays and Sundays all year round, and offers discounts to groups and students. If you want more information, you can call him at 377-1311, any weekdav.

Page8 CONCORDIENSIS, May 12, concordy sports JV lax ends at 5-3 by DON CORCORAN Hustle and desire are two words that characterized this year's J. V. Lacrosse team. The team's record ended up at 5 wins and 3 losses. Coached by Earl JRogers, .. the team was behind many times in games but ·were able to come back, a sign of a spirited team and coach. team. The leading scorers for the team were attackmen Greg Steiner (17 goals, 2 assists), Jim Garafalo (4 goals, 3 assists) and Dan Dutelli (5 goals, l assist). From the mid-field, Geoff Spicer (5 go~lls, 4 assists), nave Guter (7 goals, l assist) and Don Corcoran (I goal, 3 assists), were a thorn in the side of the opposition. The final game of the season was a storybook ending to a successful season. Albany St. took an early 2-0 lead. Union was taking many shots but was not able to burn the nets. The score stood 2-0 at the half. lJ nion came back with a goal by Greg Steiner, Albany countered with their third score but it was their last. A :fired- up team disturbed by the officials and the unsportsmanlik~ conduct of the Albany players came flying back with four straight goals. Geoff Spicer and Mike Gray both scored in the third 1 period to tie the score. In the 4th period with 5 minutes on the clock, Dan Dutelli put in a chip shot to put the Garnet in the lead. Greg Steiner then closed the book by scoring 46 seconds later for a Union Baseball continues in its disappointing season with two more losses. The team was led on defense by Leigh Gulas' steady play and good stickwork. Likewise Dick Hoskinson often came up with the big play on defense. Rounding out the defensive gladiators are Howie Lee, Bob Ewell, and Greg Scott. Garnet 9 coni:inue .losing .ways In the goal was freshman Kevin Ice who was as cool as his surname. He had a. fantastic average of only six goals-against per game. In the close. games, time and time again he came up with the big play, whether on fast- breaks, or mandown. Rounding out the attack was freshman Dave Rosenthal. For a team to be successful, the mid-fielders must scoop the ball constantiy and always be hustling up and down the field, Though these middies didrrt score often, they were as much responsible for victories as those who did score. These mid-fielders were jim Sutton (2 goals), Tom Flynn, Doug .-Richardson, Mike Gray (I goal) .. Bob Clark and Bill Wade. Mike Greenbladt and Les Weiss also saw action. The team's five victories came against R.P.l. (twice), Williams, and Albany St. (twice). Losses came at the hands of Middlebury, Syracuse, and Oneonta's Club From Tuesday, May 18 to Saturday, May 22, Union College will be the site of the 1976 United States Volleyball Association - YMCA National Volleyball Championships.

Both schools matched each other for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th periods, with Union's goals in the first period deciding the outcome. The Continentals were only one goal down with 5~55 to go in the game, hut Jed Kanner added another goal with just 1:03 left to capture the game for the stickmen from Schenectady. The scoring was not as frequent as other contests the Dutchman were in this year, although the goals were distributed among the Union squad evenly. Senior Co-captain Don Ward ·got two scores past Hamilton's goalie John Rice. Ray Stecker had two goals as well and he had an a;ssist, too. John Thompson and Jed Kanner had one goal and two assists while Union's Jim Felix also saw action in the scoring column. J\lan Greenberg, in the nets for Union for the majority of the Hamilton game, had nine saves. In a game held last Wednesday on Daley Field, Union rolled over Wesleyan 15-2. Jed Kanner was in the spotlight before the home crowd as he scored 40 percent ·of Union's output with six goals. Jed also had 3 assists to his credit. Stu Napear added three goals to his total that Wednesday while Ray Stecker and Hank Fleming scored 2 goals apiece. After today's game, Union will end up their season Saturday at the only Ivy League School on the schedule ~ Dartmouth.

State outdoor meet, coming in a mere 2 points behind the winners, the engineers of RPI. The Union quest to become the first team to win both the itidoor and outdoor track titles thus fell just short. Coach Ken Michelson had predicted that 90 points would win the· meet, and he couldn't have been much closer as RPI won with 8'1 points to Union's 87. Alfred was a distant 3rd with 63!.1. The Garnet runners have much to be proud of however. 1'he Garnet took first or second in 7 of the 9 running events, and a 4th in the mile relay. Winners for Union Were led by senior Steve Jones, who took the 3 mile in a Union College record time of 14:29;87. Bob Moffat added to his string of victories in the 440, winning in a time of 49.6. He also took a second in the 220 in a time of 22.58, after having run two fast heats as well as the final into a stiff wind. Matt Blum, just a freshman, remained unbeaten for the seaso'l by capturing the 120 highs in a time of 15.46 seconds, again into a stiff breeze. And senior Milt Herring burned up the field in the 100; winning in a time of 10 flat. Kevin Scheuer took a second in the 880, losing out by a second: And Steve Jones set yet another Union College record and qualified for the nationals as well in taking a second in the 6 mile run with a fine time ·of 29:48.2, just .6 seconds behind the winner .. Other scorers for the Dutchmefi were Rich Norman in the javelin . (198ft. II inches), good enough for 3rd, Bruce Bonannp in ·the pole vault (12ft. 6 inches), asain good enough for 3rd, Steve Mastaitis 5th in the pole'vault (12 ft. 6 inches), Lee Parish~s 5th in the 100 (10.4) and Milt Herring's 6th in the 220. The Dutchmen couldn•t come up with some points in the jumping events that could have made the difference. Coach Michelson is proud of his team, as well he should be, as they came through very well, a few men running many heats under less than ideal conditions. Prior to the State meet the butchmen saw their undefeated status go down the drain against a revengeful .. Albany and ·always tough Williams, at Albany State last Wednesday. The Dutchmen, looking ahead to the state meet, weren'.t about to burn themselves out and hence felt a lack of depth as many runners ran in just one .or 2 events instead of the usual 3 ot 4, thus hurting the Garnet effort. It was still close, with Albany winning with 65Y2 points, Williams next With 60 and Union a close 3rd wifh 55!.1. Some outstanding per- _formances were turned in by tlle Outchmen. Earl Chilton jumped a personal· best 45 ft. 7!4 inches in the triple jump for the win, and Dave Plumer, returning front a knee injury, won the high jump with a leap ·of 6 ft. 3 inches.

September- Concordy reports that the new Tax committee has cut the entire budget for WRUC.

Even though 1900 students showed up at a meeting to show their suppport for squatter's rights, Concordy reports that the committee felt that since the entire student body didn't show up, then the showing at the meeting probably didn't sufficiently represent student opinion on the matter. So, disregarding student wishes, they did what they wanted to do in the first place. November- Rumor has it that ex-Concordy editor David Moskowitz has been seen walking around Memorial Chapel talking to the portraits of past presidents of Union. According to Concordy, Moskowlll once got down on his hands and knees and pounded the tloor, asking, \Why didn't the students just write about Star Trek in the letters section'!\ December-The remains of Concordy reporter Jack Pitney were found by campus police on Library field. No motive or suspects are known, and the only clue was a copy of the book Star Trek Lives found next to the char-broiled body. January - The newly formed .

To date, every Voice article has nothing but bad words about Union. March Another new calender was submitted to the Calender committee. The new proposal, the 9-0-0, would entail one 9 course, 29 week term that would start on Columbus day and end May lOth. There would be no vacations, not even Christmas (we don't observe the other Christian holidays anyway), but there would be one heck of a summer vacation. The committee is reported to be seriously considering this proposal. April - A new two point grading system was submitted to the Grades committee. The new system would have just A's and Fs. It was felt that the five point grading system, like the proposed 12 point system of a few years back, was too competitive. \We don't want to present an image of being overly competitive, you know.\ observed one committee member. May - The annual \Let's get rid of Saga\ drive has again captivated the Union campus. The Saga tradition, a tradition as old as the Nott itself, is one of the why so short?

Students claimed their voice was not being heard. · ~ The students argued that having a member on ad hoc committees \formalizes\ the student input and would dispel a lot of the questions about the process. Jim Kestenbaum said, \Students .will feel that more is being done with the information they provide.\ The one issue which the faculty picked upon was that of peer review. The topic was introduced by a student, Jack Pitney, who said, \The idea (being expressed by the students) is that faculty and students --are peers. The students are not the peers of the factrlty. We have not, in general, done high level scholarly work.\ · Provost Enteman said, \The system (peer review) is indigenous to a professional enterprise.

I find it a much stronger system, a much easier system to deal with than other institutions where a small group of administrators make the decision.\ Discussion at this point had become repetitive. It was o'bvious that the students and the professors were at odds and their djtlerences Were irreconcilable on this issue.

The game was called after the third inning because of dangerous field and weather conditions. Because of <;alendar conflicts the game could not be rescheduled. With a few days rest the Garnet Girls roared out to battle Siena, a long time rival Siena had an 8-7 lead into the 5th but then the Diamond Ladies· pulled it all together. Joyce Sears nailed a solid hit up right field for a home- run; Ronnie \Z\, Perky Francis and Cathy \Hustler\ Reals all connected with doubles and Young Gwen got her cream for came to an end Union had scored 20 runs to Siena's 8, thus making our record an impressive 7 and 0. However, with an impressive record or not, HVCC was going to be a tough cookie to heat. There was a major factor in:volved in · the Garnet Girl's loss to HVCC; Mother Nature had blessed us. again with lousy Weather. It was l-1 for a while, hut that didn~t last for tong. In the bottom of the fourth inning H VCC had managed to get four runs. The· weather got wone and chances for Unoin.'s Garnets to shine looked dim.

In his work he emphasized the need for Black leadership and encouraged the development of a self-sufficient, educ~:tted race. W.E.B.

During 1900-1930 the following films were considered to hold bad stereotypes that degraded Blacks and projected bad images: The Wooing and Wedding of a Coon (1905) The Salve ( 1909) Uncle Tom's Cabin (1909) The Battle (1911) For Massa's Sake (1911) The Dark Romance of Tobacco Can (1911) In Slavery Days (1913) The Octoroon (1913) Coon Town Suffragettes (1914) Dark Town Jubilee (1914) Birth of a Nation (1915) The Nigger (1915) Our Gang (1918) Ten Nights in a Barroom (1920) Robinson Crusoe ( 1922) Homogenous Perspective on Blaek Di.story DuBois~ Dream Deferred William Edward Burghardt DuBois was twentieth century America's most knowledgeable scholar on race relations. A leading intellectual of his time, DuBois devoted his life to researching, evaluating, and interpretin'g Black American culture. By publishing a number of books and essays DuBois attempted to bring the plight of the Black American to the attention of a discriminating white society. In his work he emphasized the need for Black leadership and encouraged the development of a self-sufficient, educated race. W.E.B. DuBois played a major role in lifting the status of the Black race by promoting self-awareness and pride among Blacks and fighting the oppressive barriers of white pre!udices. Rather than endorse the industrial education doctrine of Booker T. Washington, a leading Black educator of the time, DuBois advocated intellectual rather than vocational advancement. He fouoo Washington's stand too conciliatory and submissive and dismis~ed Washington's materialistic economic priority in favor of the Black struggle for civil rights. \Manly self-respect is worth more than the land and houses and a people that voluntarily surrender such respect, or cease striving for it, are not worth civilizing.\ DuBois felt the duty of uplifting the Black race lay in the hands of determined Black leaders whose major concern was social reform. His social reform strategy consisted of three fundamental demands that American society must meet in order to alleviate racial discrimination; the right to vote, the right to civic equality, and the education of youth according to ability. Irked by what he felt to be an inadequate job on Washington's part in defying southern lynching, disenfranchisement, and Niagara Movement in 1906 calling Blacks to \Oppose firmly the present methods of strangling honest criticism; to organize honest and intelligent Negroes; and to support organs of news and public opinion.\ The Niagara Movement provided an alternative to Washingt()n's doctrine and was the predecessor of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

' . ' .. · .... ·: PageC I •••••••••••••••Biaek· History·-~·-···-···•••••••·~ The el'li!. of Radical Reconstruction was not a peaceful time in the South. The freedman exercised rights of which his father ba(,l' not even. dreamed and which would be denied to I;tis !iOns and grandsons. The accomplishments of the 1860's and 1870's would not 'be repeated fi>r almost a century, arid ill some cases they have not yet been duplicated, The dramatic and fundamental changes wroUght during Reconstruction generated desperate resistance. Reconstruction had barely begun when Southerners formed an organization ded~cated to .restoring .. law and order\ thr.ough harassment, murder., and ghostly night rides. The Ku Klux Klan instigated a campaign of terror to prevent Black men from voting or exercising their other new rights. While the Klan and similar groups terrorized . the freedman, powerful white leaders man~uvered in less overt ways to deprive the Negro of his right to vote. By the mid-1870's, \home rule\ had been restored to several s<>Utbern states; federal troops were withdrawn and the black- and-tan .governments were fordbly disposed. Soon the northern allies of the freedmen grew weary of continued chaos and upheaval in the . South. They longed for tranquility and order in Dixie, even .if its establishment meant a return to white supremacy. The fate of Radical Reconstruction was sealed by·the compromise of 1876. The presidential election of that year was contested, and Rutherford B. Hayes only· won the southern !!Uppott necessary to break the stalemate by promising to pull out the federal troop!i and . leave the problem of the freedmen to southern whites. Without federal protecticm,' willio~t atrtls, and withou~ land, the freedmen were almost defenseles!!. Many of them became sharecroppers on the. plantations of their former owners, in a condition of perpetual· debt which was very similar to the old .system of 11lavery. Under the ••convict lease system\ prisoners were hired out as slaves in everything but name. The old Black Codes werre · resurrected to restrict the lives and activitie11 of the ex-slaves and their descenda11ts. Disfranchisement was effected in a variety of ways: outr-ight terror was a· popular method, but a more .refined technique was the infamous \grandfather clause,\ which gave the right to vote to those whose fathers or ,grandfathers had voted before }867. . One reaction to this repression was the growth of the .Populist movement in the last two decades of the nineteenth century. Early Populist leac:lers urged Black and poor white farmers to work together to fight against their common enemies and to demand their common rights. The Populists ran Black candidates and won massive Black support in some areas. Sut as Afro- Americans suffered defeat after defeat at the hands of law-makers and judges, they became less attractive as allies for the Populists. In a striking aboutface, Populists leaders such as Tom Watson became the most rabid segregationists and stirred up racial lurtred among their followers. . The defeat of Reconstruction and triumph of reaction was a ~ore gradual process than Radic;al Reconstruction itself had been. Disfranchisement could not be effected all at once, for the Black .freedman cherished his right to vote and fought for it. The first Jim Crow laws did not appear until five years after Hayes compromise of f876. Some states did not institute segregationist laws until almost twenty years after Reconstmction. Jim Crow legislation became the very cornerstone of segregation and debasement of the Negro. A rash of laws, covering a · wide range of activities, were passed between 1885 and 1910. Some laws were <lPI?res~ive, ~uc~ as the_ ~~sidential restrictions whi<;h gave rise to ghettos, the discriminatory policies of the courts, and the legalized vio'lation of the Black man's economic freedom. Some Jim Crow laws were demeaning, such as those which designated special railway cars for .. Negroes and Freight. \ Some were simply absurd: textbooks for Negroes and white children had to be stored in separate ·warehouses; a :Negro family's pet could not be buried .in the same dog cemetery with a \white\ animal.

Birth of a Nation based on the Thomas Dixon novel, The Clansmen has been the most projected and seriously racist movie or film of the twentieth century. A summary of the movie may be in order but it's too disgusting, therefore, I'd rather not go into it. (Anyway, I know that aU you latent racists, average Black students, bright-eyed liberals, and etc. have seen the film and enjoyed (?) every moment of it because of the realistic: atmosphere that surrounds the movie.) There are other stereotypes of Black Americans. These include the corrupt politician, the irresponsible citizen, the petty thief, the social delinquent, the superstitious church goer, the chicken and watermelon eater, the razor and knife carrier, the uninhibited expressionist and the mental inferior. · Today, in recent years, the amount of Black motion pictures has increased greatly. There are many Black movies around. The best motion pictures I've seen were Come Back Charleston Blue and Buck and the Preacher. Do they portray the true Black image? A lot of the Black viewers are wondering if there is too much exploitation in Black films, today? On television, there is Good Timest That's My Momma, Sanford and Son and the Jeffersons. Do they portray the true Black image?

You haven't thought about them enough ... You haven't committed yeurselves to them.\ At the same time, the consultant committee appeared to have been impressed by the students with whom they had come into contact. Taylor said that he recognized an · \internal energy\ of considerable size and importance on the part of the students which he felt was responsible tor carrying on the arts program here. However, he was surprised that students had so passively relinquished their hold on the Director's Lab Theatre; he also sensed that the spirit in the arts is close to being \frustrated and turned off.\ Taylor criticized Union for treating the creative arts as just a \thing to do after important things are done.\ Further, it was made clear that the committee believed Union to be \terribly short on teaching talent,\ and that, for example, the two professors in theatre are doing much more than they should even be asked to do.

Late Discovery The decision to postpone SeniHe action on the tenure pti~bletn was made after President Th'omas Bonner requested, \I>eeause of the unclarity\ of the s1i:~~tion •. that the matter be withdfawn. Bonner noted, in ~he . light of recent controversy over student participation in tenure decisions, that \it is healthy to bring strong disagreements to the surface.\ Still, in view of the questionable parliamentary legality of Senate action,. Bonner added that such action \would make the situation more tense at a time when the institution is trying to validate its . system of tenur.e.\ As the motion was subsequently, and unanimously withdrawn, three student members of the Campus Voice quietly vacated the meeting room, prompting one faculty senator to remark ''that it was an imma-ture and single-minded gesture which overlooked the reality of the situation.\ l\he parliamentary problem arese from an oversight made last year when an ad hoc committee formulated the -new college governance structure. The committee overlooked a-provision in the faculty constitution which indicated that the trustees give all campus power to the faculty who subsequently vest it in the Senate. lhc problem i~ that the faculty Constitution provides o.n certain committees tu be exempt from Senate control, and thus their members are derived frotn the laculty- nmks. According to trustee-elect Andy Koblenz, the oversight came as a result of a Demographic data indicates that by 1990 the number of students who will be of college age will decrease by 17 percent nationally. The corresponding figure for New Y ark State will be a 33 percent decrease. According te Jay Shupe, Union's l.)irector of Admissions, there are two courses of action which can he taken to counteract the pFoblems posed by the expected decrease of prospective students. Union could begin a pregram of retrenchment and start planning for a student body 'ol 1600 instead of 2000; or attempt to entice a larger percentage of the available students to matriculate to Union. ''The latter is tnt route we have elected at thi~ time,\ said Shupe, \We are n0t gomg to decrease the stt.c ot the student body.\ fhe plan 1s to mcrease the applicant pool from 2700 to 4000. As a means to this end Shupe said, 'We plan to take more advantage ol lJnmn'scurnculum and faculty. There are very lew colleges in the country whose ,curncula can compare ta Union's.' A Marketing Program In the next few years Shupe hopes to institute recruiting programs which the Admissions staff will not directly operate. Shupe explained that Union's curriculum is one which attempts to impart to the students a sense ul what tcchnoloi!V is all about, and thatthccurti('ulum ·. here is unique in that. He also noted that Union~s faculty is a strong, well respected group in academic circles. Shupe said, ··me key to our success is letting people know these thirtgs. Jack Maranville, the.

May 26. 1976 New committee. established: Saga food service at the crossroa·ds By DAVID MOSKOWITZ The Student Forum decided recently to set up a special food committee whose main function will be to supervise the upgrading ot much mtrligned SAGA food service. on the other hand, has complained that its avenues .of communication have been too diverse in the past. Forum president Brian Tucker pointed out that the college's comptroller Oale Timberlake was' completely unaware that Saga'.s performance was in any way inadequate .. Lacking ;in Facilities Paae 3 SAGA has been under fire in recent months due to its failure to satisfy the culinary needs of its customers. Back in February, the Food Service was presented with a Jist of 18 demands for changes in service which were to · be instituted before the fifth VJeek of Sp~ing · l'erm. Several other food companies .have been making contract effers to the College in the event that .Saga's attempts at improvement wen~ seen as lhe present West Coll~ge dining hall seats 24!! students and only 559 students• are on some sort .of meal plan; only 109 of these are not heshmen. Hipp's goal is an all college dining hall that would feed about I 000 students: \it's something that's been ignored for a long time.\ At present, though,: Saga is trying to impmve its atmosphere l\nd design in and out. of the kitchen. Hipp claims· that Saga doesn't have the necessary expertise in the. area of physical planning and would have to· invest several: tl~ousand dollars for an outside firm's plans. \We're willing to put out a normal amount;'' explained Hipp, but he feels that the college must also commit itself to food service il!lprovement Mark Smith says, on the other band, that it is Saga~s responsibility to plan for its renovation, commenting that .. if l had an $80,000 operation, 1 wouldn't give a damn who would pay for the planning.\ ' . The .inadequate Saga kitchens may be the source of future .replanning efforts by the college inadequate. The suggested improvements covered a range of topics from better menus to improved communication. \We've tried to comply with every sllggestion the forum presented us.'' explained Saga directur (lacy: Hipp. Saga has ·eliminated the controversial and money\lvsing option plan fer next year and will institute a system of full value mo~ey coupons in the faiL The Saga menus which are standardized and provided ~y the company's national offi~, are often being .replaced or scrapped: \We're trying to provide more .of what the students want,\ .says Hipp. Meal · hours have been extended an.d provisions. have been map~ for guests to eat at West. Hipp explained that tickets must remain non-transferable as meal cost is computed on an attendaJ}ce basis: the student actually pays for only about 12 meals of a 20 meat plan. Saga's equipment is now checked weekly to insure the .cleanliness of silverware and cooldog utensils. .l.he main .problem taciJtg Saga has been one of coriini'uriications - the· college students and food service have never managed to get together. a.t o.ne time to. set up a plan for improvement. :Aeco,rding to Dean of Students Mark Smith .. Saga is responsible for making sure something happens.\ Saga, Op,inion: Progress Ahead The new food committee's task will be to integrate Saga's plans with the administration and the nee~s of the student body. While Hipp admits detecting \concern\ in the Union community on the status of West College dining hall, he callll the facility .. not atrocious: it's clean and functional.\ He explained some of the difficulties the building has ... We have to bring· su.pplles in :through th~,: window\ and \there is no elevator for toe two tloors we have.\ Still, Hipp feels it is his job ''to respond to students\ and sees the new food committee as a way towards a better food service and a more satisfactory eating future. ana the food service. George speaks at Museum Professor Carl G,eorge, Asso.ciate Professor of Biology lot nine years at Union College and former Chairman of the Nature Conservancy gave a slide/talk presentation on the unique history and cbaracteristics of Collins Lake on Tuesday, May 18 at 8 p.m . .at the Schenectady Museum. · · Prof. George is particularly interested in Collins La,ke - . which was given into the care of The Nature Conservancy during the time he was Chairman of the Conservancy by Mrs. Helen Myn~erse. The Lake represents ·the smallest holding · of the Conservancy\ in all of North Am-::rica.. Union College is giving attention to local resources and Collins Lake represents one effort by Union's people to stage a number of stud'ies, e.g. Dr. Philip Snow, an engineer with interests in water resources, sedimentatic water balance, and water chemistry an{! Dr. David Young, a biologist working with a number of studies of aquatic vegetation, both are finding Collins Lake of interest in their prote11~ional researches. Prof. George's talk reported on the team eHort by Union in Collins Lake study and his personal efforts which center around plankton and fish in the Lake plus a general assessment of .. Admissions investigations continued: the .population •of the Lake. His professional lite has always concerned the impact of man on aquatic environment . and while teaching at the American University of Beirut, he studied the impact of the Aswan High Dam and the Suez on fisheries in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Sports applicatiOns rolled back by PETER BERICK and CHARLES C. HOLLEMAN Following up on statements made to lis in previous interviews, we discussed admissions procecures further with Mr. Jay Shupe, Director of Admissions. l-Ie told us that Coaches Cahill l~l Today, I'm outahere, and Harkness were hired too late in the year to have an effective input in suggesting candidates for the entering class of '79. Therefore the · deadline for applications was rolled back two weeks to May I. Shupe explained that in many cases when an exceptional application · came before the admissions staff after the dead·lin.e it might be considered. In the case of these teams Mr. Schafer, chairman of There are physical limitations however on the time of the members of the admissions committee. Usually the rush of folders comes in at the end of the winter term when there are a lot of academic pressures on both faculty and students. It is hoped that the committee's members could read about I 00 folders each but the usual number that is reported read is about 50. This adds up to about 750 readings for committee members ollt of a total of about 2,500. The admissions staff therefore takes in the great bulk of the work in reading folders, but what of the applications that come in late'! ,,. ' .

Page 4 CONCORDIEN$JS, Wednesday, May 26, 1976 sOrry, grandma, we edited \So did you do anything but study this year at college, David?\ \Well grandma, yes ... you'll see that in my grades. You see, me and this other .guy edited the campps paper. We started out in January with high hopes to turn the paper around. It's been pretty hurtin' in the past, you know. Anyway, we even managed to ,get an independent study in newswriting to take some of the work load off our backs, and the paper turned out pretty .good at first. We had lots of in,.. depth analyses, urgent newb, witty opinion pieces, soporific humor, exciting sporting news, clever cartoons, constructive criticism, urbane cultural news,.all sorts ofgood stuff. By the second term, though, we began to realize that very few people were really involved with discussing campus issues, and after that, very few people were involved with the paper at all. All in all, though, we tried very hard to create a little interest in reading about how the college ticked. Nobody 'likes to see an optimist become a pessimist. It happened to us.\ - \So why the hell didn't you study like a good boy and become a doctor?\ \Well ya got me there ... \ - David Moskowitz 'you know too much' Cautiously he peeked into the dimly lit confines of the pub and then stepped quietly, but quickly, to a corner table where three people were waiting \'and was enveloped in the semi- darkness. He was greeted by a friendly but nervous voice; \They're looking for you Mike.\ ~·who's lookingfor me?\ \They all are,\ said the voice, \They say you.have outlived your usefullness.\ \Who is they goddam it?\ ••why. your •friends' Mike, your friends. For two terms you have devoted your time to them and the newspaper; but Mike, you've ignored us.\ \It's true, I have ignored you; but 20 weeks on the paper have shown me my error. I was too much with trying to 'wake up' the campus. I should have left well enough alone.\ \But Mike, what about all of your political buddies? You know. the members of the 'pnwer bloc'. What would they think?\ \It doc~n't matter an,y more. always put their announcements in the paper iind never really said anything to rub them them the wrong way. And now, I'm not the editor anymore and they will leave me alone and let me sink into oblivion. Oh, that's all I want to do next year, just forget I ever ran the newspaper.\ \But that's the point Mike, they aren't going to let you do that. They say what you know is too dangerous to risk exposing it to the rest of the student body.\ \\· \What do I know?\ \What has the paper taught you?\ said the voice. \Well it's taught me that in general, the students here are uninterested and unresponsive. I've learned that the students don't want their minds stimulated by the newspaper because they really don't have time to think. I guess I've learned that it is not worth the time you have to put in on a major activity because nobody really gives a damn. Boy. have I turned hitter.\ .. Exactly Mike. that's why they don't want your kind around. That kind of knowledge is dangerous, it fosters unhealthy attitudes toward the College. And he says we can't , have that.

Page 4 CONCORDIENSIS, Wednesday, May 26, 1976 --~------------------------~--------~--------~----------~--~---------------------~--------------------------- sOrry, grandma, we edited \So did you do anything but study this year at college, David?\ \Well grandma, yes ... you'll see that in my grades. You see, me and this other guy edited the camp;us paper. We started out in January with high hopes to turn the paper around. It's been pretty hurtin' in the past, you know. Anyway, we even managed to get an independent study in newswriting to take some of the work load off our backs, and the paper turned out pretty good at first. We had lots of in- depth analyses, urgent new~. witty opinion pieces, soporific humor, exciting sporting news, clever cartoons, constructive criticism, urbane cultural news, all sorts o(good stuff. By the second term, though, we began to realize that very few people were really involved with discussing campus issues, and after that, very few people were involved with the paper at all. All in all, though, we tried very hard to create a little interest in reading about how the college ticked. Nobody likes to see an optimist become a pessimist. It happened to us.\ \So why the hell didn't you study like a good boy and become a doctor?\ \Well ya got me there ... \ - David Moskowitz \you know too much' Cautiously he peeked into the dimly lit confines of the pub and then stepped quietly, but quickly, to a corner table where three people were waiting ··and was enveloped in the semi- darkness. He was greeted by a friendly but nervous voice; \They're looking for you Mike.\ \Who's looking for me?\ \They all are,\ said the voice. 'They say you have outlived your usefullness.\ \Who is they goddam it?\ \Why your 'friends' Mike, your friends. For two terms you have devoted your time to them and the newspaper; but Mike, you've ignored us.\ \It's true, I have ignored you; but 20 weeks on the paper have shown me my error. I was too much with trying to 'wake up' the campus. I should have left well enough alone.\ \But Mike, what about all of your political buddies? You know, the members of the 'power bloc'. What would they think?\ \It doesn't matter any more. always put their announcements in the paper and never really said anything to rub them them the wrong way. And now, I'm not the editor anymore and they will leave me alone and let me sink into oblivion. Oh, that's all I want to do next year, just forget I ever ran the newspaper.\ \But that's the point Mike, they aren't going to let you do that. They say what you know is too dangerous to risk exposing it to the rest of the stl!.£1ent body.\ \What do I know'!\ \What has the paper taught you'!\ said the voice. \Well it's taught me that in general, the students here are uninterested and unresponsive. I've learned that the students don't want their minds stimulated by the newspaper because they really don't have time to think. I guess I've learned that it is not worth the time you have to put in on a major activity because nobody really gives a damn. Boy, have I turned hitter.\ \Exactly Mike, that's why they don't want your kind around. That kind of knowledge is dangerous, it fosters unhealthy attitudes toward the College. And he says we can't have that. So Mike, in 20 weeks you've lost it all. It is close to lunch time, and they will be looking for you. We hope they don't find you, hut we can never be seen with you again.

LETTERS- all fired up Editors. Concordiensis: , On Wednesday, May ·19 Saga held a . special Hawaiian Qr Polynesian--type night tor dmner at the West College dining room. Thete were special toods and an attempted special atmosphere. A special-teature of the night was a dancer from Lake George named Keana, and students were urged to stay after eating and watch Iter dance act. About I00-150 pegp!e stayed to watch an9. Kaena did her dance. I am not writing to comment on the dance itselt or on the general reaction. Rut, what I think is important is that the nnai portion of her sh:ow was a fire dance, which ,consisted o:f Kaena dancing with some kind of lighted Haring to reb in her hand. Now l don't ''. know how the name was Ht, but it was fire and was a foot-high tlame. Kaena said herself, before the fire dance, that there could be no LV. filming. or other drstractions because they could cause a serious accident. I assume that acddent would involve the· flaming torch. _ With that fire and her warning. there were no tire, prevention !}recautions that 1 could see. She performed in the back comer of \t.n~. , dining roof!l . ri_gpt • on the uncovered carpet. Afterwards, when l spoke to a couple of people involved in setting it up they JUSt said they assumed nothing bad would happen and weren't ·sure whether tb~. carpet was JJreproQf. Granted, sne ~as probably done the dance many times. without any accident but something can always happen. -With the name, there could be very senous or potentially tragic results ot an accident. It a fire did start, there are many people eating or Jiving at West who could be hurt. l thin{\ it is shametul that Saga, tor · a promotion like that, could not take the time and care to guanmtee the . satety of ~he students. Also, I'd like to add that Saga is now workiog on a trial basis by the students. ·1 heir contract is up tor renewal and they must pass this trial basis successfully. r only hope that all the $!Udents that are unhappy ab9u,t>Saga's food and service will nu:t be overwhelmed' by these special promotional nights and dubious· dance acts. 1 . hope all the students remember that the food must be unproved and that is what must be judged with clear eyes. uninfluenced by ''Hawaiian\ night or things of that sort.

This is the third major incident at the Nott Memorial. Last December a thug gained entrance to the control booths and costume shops on the second tloor.

We expect the Tmsltes to ask the Continued <m Page 7 when the fine line has been crossed. in any event, it is a dangerous circumstance. Recent incidents have bnmght this .problem to lignt again. One involved a number of students who beat ·up a tellow student and accosted the girls who were with him. The veibal abuse which accompanied the physical attack left no doubt that these students were being bothered merely because they are Jewish. (It is ironic that one of the girls _who was hit is, in fact, not Jewish;) This was followed a few days later by a verbal and graffiti attack on North College. The slogans painted on the dumpster intimated that \all North girls are hebes.\ The two in¢idents are related in that alcoholic inebriation was the catalyst and that the perpetrators are brothers of the same fraternity. These ·are the essential facts. There are many complications to the story, but they do not change the fact that these events did occur. lt has been suggested that these were not anti-Semitic actions at aiL out rather JUst a hunl:h ot guy~ ha\ mg a good time. Anyone who regards phys1eal violence as a \good t1me\ has a problem which I cannot deal With 1n lht:; letter.

However, we recognize its existence and need to deal with it. It cannot be ignored and allowed to tester. The only antidote to the poison of prejudice is knowledge • and understanding of people's differences. In dealing with the$e particular incidents, l feel there are a number of things which both Jews and non-Jews need to understand about each other. First of aU, those who belong to the majority (often called \WASPs\) ·must attempt to understand what it means to belong to an ethnic group (in this case Jewish). WASPs are every .bit as much an ethnic group; however, they form a majority in. this country, and are a large group on Uiis campus. Thus their values. culture, et~. have come to be. regarded as the national norm. Other groups must therefore conform to these, and for the most part they do. Yet they also wish to do as the majority has been able. to do so easily, i.e., preserve their heritage. What WASPs do hy delirllt um m i\menca.

One involved a number of students who beat up a tellow student and accosted the girls who were with him. lhe verbal abuse which accompanied the physical attack lett no doubt that these students were being bothered merely because they are Jewish.

Her tina! work is a study of the Stony Lane Bar in Schenectady, and is the culmination of her work in a two term senior art project. The painting depicts a view of contemporary life in America. The project required a number of preliminary sketches and color studies, many ot which are included in the show to demonstrate how a painting is developed. Also included is a selection of her graphic art done during her internship with the Graphic department of the New York State Assembly. The show runs from May 31 to June 6.

Lawrence, who retires at the end ol this college year, has bean at Union College since 193,;, when he Joined the Dutchmen's phys. ed. staff fresh out of Purdue University. Uuring his long tenure at Union, Lawrence has had a varied coaching career, serving as head coach of baseball, football and ice hockey, as· interim director of athletics and as organizer and lirst director of intramural activities. But baseball has probably been Lawrence's first love. He had his team reach their apex in 1965 when Union won the NCAA Atlantic Coast Division baseball championship in Yankee Stadium. There were no national tournaments for college division Allison teams in that era. In that year Lawrence was named Coach ol the Year by the American Association .of College Coaches. Although his cun:ent team at ·union has won only one game, Lawrence's teams have a solid career percentage of .559, with 226 wins against 17~ losses going back to 1939 when he was named head baseball coach. lJespite his success on the d.iamond, Art is reluctant to name any .outstanding players, fearful \I might miss ·one or two.\ · Whtle at Purdue in the early 1930's, Lawrence was an .outstanding center for the Boilermaker football team. He also played college baseball and later played professional baseball in the Canadian-American and Hi-State Leagues. Art hasn't decided upon his plans after retirement. But the coach of 42 years is certain of one thing; \I'm not going to take another lull-time job.\ moves on By CLARK KENT R. B~uce Allison, director of athletics, chairman of physical education, and head lacrosse coach, has been named director of athletics and head of physical education at the Colorado School ol Mines in Golden, Colorado. Allison, 46, said he . had accepted the position in anticipation of \a new set of challenges\ at the school. Tnese included, he said, the opportunity to direct an athletic program \in an NCAA Division II setting,\ to coach a lacrosse team from scratch, and to teach in a physical education program at which attendance by students is required. Allison said he was also attracted by the \highly appealing geographical area.,., Allison joined Union College in 1957 as art instructor in physical education and coach of varsity wrestling, varsity lacrosse, and freshman footbail. He was named director of athletics and chairman of physical education in 1971. He is an associate professor ot physical education. As athletic director, Allison played an important role in the recent developments in Union College's athletic program, including the hiring of former West Point coach Tom Cahill to head ·union's football program, the establishment of an intercollegiate hockey team and the hiring of former Detroit Red Wings coach Ned Harkness, and the creation of six new intercollegiate women's teams. \He has provided steady leadership in times of chan!e,\ said President Thomas Bonner. ••He has the thanks of the entire college for a job well done.\ A:llison and his wife Ann have two children.

Page2 CONCORDIENSIS, Participation proposal reVised On February 11 the College Senate declined to approve Brian Tucker's proposal to institute non-academic transcripts for students. The Senate refused to approve the proposal until a subcommittee (of the Senate) had further investigated tile implications of and an adequate means of implementation for, such transcripts. The Subcommittee is now in its final stage of delibecations and will return to the Senate this month with a proposal that is both more detailed and more feasible than the one presented in February. What once began as a proposal for a Community Participati<.>n Requirement has been revised to the extent that the latter would now take the form of a \Statement of Contributions.\ An official non-academic transcript would be filed and would remain with each student's faculty advisor. The form would include a Preamble of sorts stating the formal requirement, followed by a statement by the College explaining the requirement. The remainder of the transcript would be filled out by students in 3 phases:Phase 1: Each student (whether Freshman or Transfer) by LIZ PAVA would be required to fill out and ph<>tocopied and sent with the file with his/her advisor a , student's academic transcript \Statement of Intentions\ by the whenever and wherever th~ latter time of Preregistration for the was sent.

It is these students who have to be helped the most. By instituting the above mentioned changes the committee hopes to give the incoming students a better grasp on college life at Union. Also being renovated is the Freshman Record. Mike Marks, editor, outlined a number of changes for the new book. He said that, \This book will be truly SQ.mething every entering student will want for the 4 years.\ The first change is the a?dition of a section explaining the student government. Also the environs section describing the local highspots has been revised for the first time in years. Pictures of transfers will be included for the first time. Advertisements have been added to help defray the cost from the Orientation Committee. The activity section is going to be expanded to include student committees, intramurals · and intercollegiate sports. Random statements from professors will be included. The cost will be $5.50 for the hardcover and $4.50 for the soft cover for upperclassmen. Overall, the prospects for a successful Orientation seem to be good. Anyone who wants to apply to be an OA should pick up . an application in Mrs. Marra's office on May 6 and should return it by May 10 .. Resignation ruiDors dispelled Recent rumors have circulated to the effect that Union College Athletic Director Bruce Allison has resigned in order to take a .position at a Colorado school Allison declined either to confirm or deny reports that this will be his last year at Union in a· recent interview with Con£ordiensis. Allison did acknowledge that he is the'Ieading candidate · for the position of Athletic Director at the Colorado School of Mines. Allison commented that he initiated the discussions currently going on between himself and the Colorado school, at the urging of ~he retiring Athletic Director, a long time friend .of coach Allison. Allison remarked that he was attracted to the position by the challenges that it offers. The Colorado School of Mines is a school comparable to Union; a Division 11 school with a student population of 2200. Coach Allison remarked that the physical plant is in better shape than Union's, and that more tuition waivers are granted Colorado students. The development of a program for women's athletics will be one of the bigge~t challenges for the new AD at Colorado, the coach noted. Throughout the interview, coach Allison emphasized that he has neither signed nor been offered a contract from the Colorado school. He noted that tltrough his nineteen ye~&rs at Union he has made 'a million friends'. However, when asked if they play lacrosse at the School of Mines, Coach Allison replied with a slighU[in, 'They will.' - Jaly~Ttger ' , 'l RESTAURANTS We're glad you're here! 10% DISCOUNT for all students between the hours of 10 p.m. & 6 a.m., 7 days a week STUDENTLD.REQUJRED
