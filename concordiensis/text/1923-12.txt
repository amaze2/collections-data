Five others became comfortably off and found themselves after twenty . ·years at the small yacht and chauffeur , ; stage. The other ninety-four pres urn- , i ably congregate in .the great section of ' 'tl1e American people who drive their own Buicks to the golf club. In other words, dreaming about being a rich . · man is one thing, and making the grade, is ''something else again.'' I · Yet the ninety-four presumably work, . j tistas hard as the sumptuous six. Their j · business is the axis on which a small: ' and uninteresting world revolves. They: have become devotees of the dollar' ; . and when that fickle deity deserts, have, nowhere else to turn. Jamm~d in a.. .dull, straight rut of business tlley can' . never leave the road and jump the fence-. . into :finer fields of life. This, then, is ' the portion of ninety-four men out of • every hundred now on the campus. The answer to the problem lies in the proper choice of a career. : ,y· . .Aids digestion, Meal c:leanses the teeth, 7 soothes the throat.

A century later the French Government collected all the scientific studies of this great citizen of Paris and published them, that the record of his re- searches might be preserved for an time. Lavoisier showed the errors of the theory of phlogiston- that hypothetical, . material substance which was believed to be an ele- ment of all combustible compounds and to produce fire when liberated. He proved fire to be the union of other elements with a gas which he named oxygen. Lavoisier's work goes on. In the Research Laboratories of the General Electric Com- pany the determination of the effects of atmospheric aironlampfilaments,on metals and on delicate instrurpents is possible be- cause of the discoveries of Lavoisier and his contemporaries.

Planning twenty or more years ahead is all in the day's work, among the telephone companies of America. The electrical generating and manufac- turing companies likewise look fariuto the future. To put a telephone in eve1·y home, to light the 16,000,000 houses that are not yet wired, to devise nnd promote many apvliunces for the comfort of man-all this will require decades of time and billions of capital. Chiefly it will need the brains of men. It has long been said that electricity is in its infancy. That is still true.
