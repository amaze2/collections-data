THE OLD YEAR'S SORROW. WinteT's storms and fiercest ragings I withstood when I was young, Summer's songs of joy and beauty I have heard and I have sung. I have watched the fading twilight, And the glowing dawn of day, But the watch is nearly over, For I'm growing old and gray. Yes, my end is fast appearing, I can see it almost here, And my heart is filled with SOl'l'OW As I feel it drawing near. Sorrow, not that I in living, Have not run my journey well, Nor that o'vr 1ny lifeless image Soon must ring the funeral bell; But with sorrow from which angels, If they weep, have often wept, When beholding human beings, And their many vows unkept. For how many sacred pledges Have been made, when all alone, That the coming year should witness Kind and loving ones at home. But alas ! alas, how often Discord the1·e instead of peace, And another has been worshiped Than Who bids the stonns to cease. Mother's boy, with step so manly, I have seen his journey take; Eut alas ! a broken promise; Mother's heart is Inacle to ache. I have heard the parting pledges . Mn.de by dear and loving friends; Eut the pledges now are broken ' .And the loving friendship ends. ~~I have seen the gentle lover, And his sacred vows I've heard· ' No, 3·

AND DEAR Sr:R : The Repres-entatives of the Trustees, Alumni and Faculty of Union College, and .of the authorities of Union University, beg to present to you their cordial congratulations upon the occurrence of the twenty- fifth anniversary of your Episcopate : Graduating from Union College in 1826 with distinc- tion, you were called in the :fiftieth year after you re~ ceived your baccalaureate degree, to one of the highest hono1·s in the gift of the University ; and as the Honor- ary Chancello1·, you delivered an address, afterward published, for w:hich the inst~tution has received thanks from every quarter of the land. We are also indebted to you for that other communi- /cation in whichyoupleadearnestly and eloquently for the establishment of the ~ibrary 2 and for culture, i~ the course of which you say: \From my experience in for- mer days as a professor in college, and from the deep in- terest which I have felt in young men through all my life, I think I have something like a just appreciation of what they greatly need, and of what would be greatly for the honor of our American coll~ges, and for the · credit and real welfare of our educated men: \ The danger is that if graduates leave college with little love of good reading, and with only some mechan- ical instruction, they will go through life in the same state, with scarcely a touch of literary elegance or en- largement of mind about them, no credit to their col- lege or to the education of their country.\ We thank you for the words thus spoken, for your constant love for the \ DEAB MoTHER ; \ for the honor you have conferred on her, by yo11r attainments, your high station and your long life of useful labor and Christian philanthropy. We may not say to you \&erus in ccelu7n redeas,\ lest; as your friend, Tayler Lewis, once remarked, that should seem '' heathenish and pro- fane,\ but we pray that God may gl'ant you every blessing. • ONLY A BINGLE HAIR. 'Twas on]y one, a single hair, But then, 'twas .so expressive; It told the story at s glance, And made it so ~mpressive. And then how throbbed my tender heart As forth I fal'th.er drew it, So long, so c1·im ped, so like her own- ' Twas llers, 'twas he1·s, I knew it. Oh, call it not .a fancy freak, Oh, call it not a notion, For who can not with mem'ry .call To mind a like emotion ? Emotion such as one can feel But wishes not to utter, For, oh, 'twas not my dear-one's hair, But Bridget's in the buttel'. A SA.D MISTAKE. ''May I, Miss--?'' the Senior cried. '' You may,\ Brunette replied. But no one asked the gentle Blonde, Permission by her side. Shakespeare read, the Seniors smiled, The maidens bowed consent; By two and t.wo they reached the door, And homeward bound they went. \ Stop ! oh, stop ! ! I must go back,\ The gallant Senior said. (He'd left behind his fair Brunette, And taken Blonde instead- Sad mistake, what could he say? He ne'er could treat her so-) Then, laughing, gentle Blonde replied, \ And I with thee will go. \ Baok he goes if find he may The waiting one so true; When, lo ! he meets his fair Brunette With Senio1· number two. She looks at him, he looks at her, Then comes a great ado- He gives to Senior two Miss Blonde And takes Brunette the true.
