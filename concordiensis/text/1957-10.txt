Mr. Nowack's View By 1\'Ielvin S. Einhorn We commend the House Presidents' Council for en- forcing- the rules which it has set up. In the past no house pressed for strict enforcement for fear that it might be the next one caught violating the regulations.

M.F.A., had to say from the basement studio in Silliman Hall, about the forthcoming art exhibit, beginning October 6, in Old Chapel. Mr. No- Pertaining to the declme of ar- tists occupying themselves only 1\ith art, Mr. Nowack indicated the sizable migt.ation of aesthetic artists into the field .of commerc- ial art. He cited comparisons of the poster art of ten years ago and today as indicative of the talent no1v attracted to that field. Tl1e former attitude of \no one will be hurt if we all cheat a little~· seems to have been successfully squelched. We believe that the violation which has been committed is a mim>r one. lt certainly was not an intenJional infraction of the rules. \' ack indLated, in explaining his brief remarks concerning the show, t!J,at his Vlork would repre- sent itself. \The creative indi- vidual speaks best through hls own medium.\ The fact that Michael Meyer, President of the Coun- cil, did not \let it ride\ is significant for if the present disciplinaq standards are not adhered to, the rushing rules are not worth the paper on which they are printed. Though we approve of the H.P.C.'s actions we cannot approve of its methods. No orgamzation which owes its authority to over 65 Yo of the ~tudent body has a right to close any meeting, for it can lead to a dangerous precedent. To see that their confidence is not being violated every student must have access to all of the Council's meetings. Union students should not be subjected to one para- graph capsule summaries of three hour meetings (See page 1). The Concordiensis Editor should not be asked to put such paragraph summaries \in an inconspicuous place at the bottom of the page.\ The House Presidents' Council has finally done some- thing constructive in enforcing its rushing rules. The members of the organization have taken a stand and can- not make it any less meaningful by attempting to sup- press it. DSP However, Mr. No'ilack comment- ed at length upon the correla- tion of his exhibit and the tea~h­ ing of arL He rerroarked ~hal for the teacher to realize and alleviate the stndents' difficulties in creating, he must encounter parallel problems in his own cre- ating. He further elucidated that the creative being has t\' o obli- gations, to create for the per- spicacious aesthetic and to en- lighten the student of art. Persuing the latter, he contin- ued, \the Basic Design course, as given here, is contrived to assist the student to establish for him- self, the breadth and comprehen- sion of all the stylistic possibili- ties. Students of art today must also reconcile themselves to Ie:~d­ ing a dual role, possibly as I have done, by nourishing my creative work and propelling it through teaching. The artist must fnnc- tion as a social being.\ William's Voice Newness brings with it optim- ism. Having been this serr•ester a;ppointed lnstru·ctor in Art, Mr. Nowack, anticipates enougl:J, creative and receptive activ1ty among the student body to fa~ iii- tate at least one student show and possible exhibitions to be in- vited from various museums and galleries. Professor John Bradbury is still optimistic about the development of the fine arts ·at _Union, even though he has witnessed a bit of the apathy encountered at cul- tural activities. Already freed of coaching tennis for a year and publishing a book in J·anuary, he can again have leisure to play golf and dream of such futuristic additions to our modest Art department as a course in three dimensional de- sign (sculpture). Bradbury is now busy devising a represenbt- tion of his department, \Art 5n the Atomic Age,\ for the At0oms for Peace display, which will suc- ceed Mr. Nowack's exhibit toward the end of October, • The Profes- sor hopes to present a mobile sculpture as the prime object.

Coach Bill Ketz feels that his : squad is in as good shape now as last year's team was at the time. He has been slightly concerned about a series of cold.s and minor injuries that have plagued his runners recently, but does not ·consider them serious. The Garnet squad' will consist of captain Tom LaWTence,. Dick Ruquist, Tom Hoffman, Ted Tot- man, Geoff Pietsch, Richie Lewis, and J·im and Ted Cavender. Lewis, who has been nursing a foot in- jury is coming along well and · should add a solid punch to the 1957 squad. Ketz is hopeful that the harriers will perform as suc- cessful!y as last auti.unn's runners who rang up a 7-1 record. Following the !Massachusetts meet the Dutchmen face Vermont on Prom Weekend and travel to Troy to take on the Engineers at RPL The harriers close the first ·half of the d1,:tal meet season aga!nst Colgate, a home match on October 26, Ketz expressed deep con.cern over the tumout for this yeat''s freshman squad. So far only four freshmen have shown up for prac- tice. If the team is not filled out it will be necessary to cancel the freshmen schedule. Ketz feels that such a cancellation would hurt the harriers' chances in ·fu- ture seasons. The fledgling squad is scheduled to run ag-ainst the University of Vermont on October 12, less than two weeks away.

4 So ph Rivalry Week Begins~ 'Dhree sophomores and a junior on a dark night in 1876, furthet•ed the cause of art (and paint store dealers) on the Union campus by painting the newly imported Shanghai Idol. The CO'IIege ad- ministration placed this deed un- der the heading of a \college p.rank.\ , In the past 1&1 years the basic features of the campus remained unchanged. The Shanghai import,' now known affectionately as the \Idol\ is still omnipresent. How- ever, the insignificant college prank now comes under uhe title. of \Soph-Frosh Rivalry.\ Since the beginning of this • school year, the freshmen and the' sophomores have kept the idol colorfully adorned. 'The culmina- tion of this competition will be \Soph-Rivalry Week\ Oct. 7 to 11. In this gruelling contest last year, the sophomores won 145-85. The Student Council has ar.-- ranged the following numerical point values for the events: Concordy Chooses Editors The above have been given promotions on this year's CON- CORDIENSIS. Left to r.-ight they are: Stefa.n Stein, Peter Gold- fine, Paul Wollman, Krumeth Hasson, Arnold Goldschlager, Richard Sobol, Mark Krugman, and Joseph Kupersmith.

Preparations for the Beethoven performance and Its addition to the Tri-City Symphony's reper- toire have been summed up as a \momentous undertaking\ by the orchestra's founder and conduc- tor, Edgar Curtis. \Because of its complexity,\ Mr. Curtis said, \the Ninth Symphony is seldom heard in live performances outside of the world's greatest concert halls. Consideringt the formidable or- chestral and choral resources re- quired, its presentation will be a milestone in the musical history of the community.\ Presentation of the Beethoven Ninth Symphony has been re- served for the fourth and final concert in this year's 'Schenectady Museum-Union College series, which will take place in Memorial Chapel on the evening of May 13, 1958. The choral portions, from which the composition draws Its name, will be performed by the Union Collt>ge Glee Club under Robert Campbell and the Skid- more College Chorus under Hoyt Irwin. Names of the solo artists will be announced at a later date. Opening the forthcoming series will be an equally noteworthy pr.-o- gram by the Tri-City Symphony Orchestra on Tuesday evening, October 29th. Featured on· that occasion will be the American premiere of Norman Symonds' Conoorto Grosso for Jazz Quintet and Symphony Orchestra, a mod- ern chamber work commissioned by the Canadian Broadcasting System and first performed in that country earlier this year. 0 Homeeoming . ..

He went right to work with Southwestern Bell in Fort Worth. How did he make his choice? Here~s what he says: ••from what I'd seen it was an interesting business with tremendous room for expansion. And a big feature with me was the opportunity to choose my location. I wanted to work in the Fort Worth area. \I came in under the Staff Assistant Program for college graduates. I spent several Weeks in each of the company;s five departments. Then I went hack for six months of intensive training in our Traffic Department. \After trainin-g, I was promoted. One of my .first jobs was setting up and super· vising a customer service improvement program. \In January, 1956, I was again pro. moted.

DSP The Achievement Test One of the major functions of the Admissions Office is to assemble information necessary for evaluating the fitness of candidates for admission. A careful selection of these candidates will provide students who can benefit from and succeed in the academic atmosphere prevailing- on this campus. The Class of 1962 will be required to take three achievement tests of the College Entrance Examination in addition to the customary Scholastic Aptitude Test. The new requirement should help to secure better entei·ing- classes in the future. Division. Allen is accoutred With an un- del'graduate degree from Bow- doin, as well as a Masters and Doctorate, ·both in history from Harvard. Outgrowths of this erudition have taken the form of various short articles, and will culminate later this autumn, with the pu'blishing of a book, the con- catenation, Maine Province and ~art Records.

The admh:jsions committee voted to require the tests of all candidates because too many \high aptitude\ boys were failing- ·to produce. The committee, as well as the faculty, felt that more evidence of actual preparation was necessary. In addition to providing this evidence, the tests will take much of the emphasis off the traditional \rank- in-class\ which is an unreliable criterion because of the variation in secondary school grading systems. The achievement exams will enable the admissions committee to cut through these confusing m~king systems and will provide a common yardstick by which to judge candidates.

He has named the plant Hedera-Helix Africans.\ This year, 1957, marks the cre- ation of another Hedera-Helix: Africans in ce>J.lege football. The new \Africans\ is of a different genus than Bill Winne's rare find and covers a broader segment of the classification system of the gridiron scene. Whereas \Afri- cans\ included only thirteen small colleges in an. ephemeral \Little Ivy League,\ the new trophy in- cludes every small college in the East. It is called the Lam'bert Cup. The Lambert cu·p competition includes almost 100 small colleges in the East that play footbalL The small college champion will be chosen by a comm-ittee of twelve, consisting of coaches and football \\riters and broadcasters. The pW'pose of both the Lam- bert cup and Winne's ivy plant is fundamentally the same-to grant recognition to the football team that has shown exceptional prowess on the playing field. Like most of the other smaller colleges in the East, the recipient of the Lambert award will probalbly be a school that takes a dim view of .profes- sicmalized college athletics while emphasizing tlle importance of scholarship in campus life. The idea of a Little Ivy League goes back to 19:39 when New York Times columnist John Kiernan, WI\iting about Union's undPfeated team that yea1·, suggestE'd it.

They have a key role in the production of some 50,000 types of apparatus and component parts that Western Elecb'ic makes in a given year. • To our engineers falls the monu- mental task of developing manufactur~ ing operations and of planning the installation of telephone central office equipment across the nation. They de- vise the new machines. tools and meth- ods needed to do our job. They also shoulder the major responsibilities in carrying out the defense contracts the government has asked us to take over- major projects like the Nike guided mis- sile .$¥Stem and the Distant Early Warn- ing (DEW) Line. • In the course of their technical work, engineers participate in such broad managerial functions as production, merchandising, installation, and many others. \Vhat's more. we have a record of promotions from within. It's not sur- prising, therefore, that fifty-five percent of the college graduates in our upper levels of management have engineering degrees. • Naturally we do everything possible to encourage and speed the professional development of our engineers. Just re- cently, for example, we inaugurated a full-time off-the-job Graduate Engineer- ing Training Program at special train- ing centers, a program with few paral- lels irl American 'indushy. • The new engineer moves into the first phase of this program, Introd~c­ tion to Western Electric Engineering, four to six months after he joins us and devotes nine weeks of study to such technical subjects as communications systems, military elecb'onic systems. product design principles. He takes part in the second phase, General Develop- ment, after the first year on the job. In this phase he devotes nine weeks to courses in human relations, semantics, engineering statistics. electronics, meas- urements and instrumentation, systems circuit analysis. The third phase, Ad- vanced Development ( 4 weeks per year), is available to selected engineers and is geared to the individual to help develop his creative engineering abili- ties; goes deeply into such subjects as magnetics, computer applications. elec- tronic switching, radar fundamentals, feedbaok control systems and technical paper writing. • Besides this company-wide program, a number of our divisions offer inclivi- • Western Electric has major manufacturing plants located at Chicago and Decatur 111 Kearny N J 8 It' Md Indianapolis, lnd.,AIIentown, Pa., Winston-Salem, N.C., Buffalo N y North Andover Ma· s's o''maha N'eb • 0 :• 1 'ba t'!llorCe, t \ In 30 cit\ 1 t 11 11 h d · . .

The Cut Proposal The proposal to eliminate cut regulations for juniors and seniors has turned into a political football. Passed by the Student Council last spring, it was sent to the Faculty Council for final approval. Instead, the problem ':'as._ re- turned to the Student Council to decide whether all JUmors and seniors should be granted this privilege or if it is to be reserved for upperclassmen in upperclass courses only. According to Helmer L. W~Jb'b, Union College librarian, in 1863 a scholar, Taylor LewiS. Dhose these words' in the original He- brew to aciorh the dome of a uniquely shaped new !2uilding on ·campus, technically designated as Alumni Hall: \The day is short and the labor gr!!a:t, and the Ia'i:lDrers sluggish; but the recompense is il.mple, a:nd the master of the house is urg- enU' W'hether Lewis meant this ex- tract from the Ethics oT the Fath- ers, to be taken for its Iofti'er meaning, or as an epigram-like comm,ent upon the fifteen years ·that were consumed in complet- ing the building, is a moot point. WEibb indicated that ' 1 a very definite stimulus to the comple- tion of the structure was lent by .a student demonstration, in the form ()f a. funera'l 'ih effigy' for the trustees.'• Museum and Dance Hall If The Musical Box By Paul Fre.undlich After this colorful birth, A,Itpn- ni Han, or as it is now known, I the EliP!'haJ.et Nott Memorial.. r;L .,. ~. rary, served thirty years housing occasional dances, · It was· used for nothing else during tl;!.at per- iod.

Impro-vements Added Offices, a new .heating system, improv€ld lighting, a paved base- men:t and steel ·stacks to ho1.1se books were added to the \shell\· in 1936, 'by virtue of a contribu- tioh from Frati'k Bailey. This completed the grooming and con- version of the Hail into· a library. 1Since the-n, the addition of.. sev- eral ·shelves has constituted. the major improvement ih ·storing books in that building. Books constantl;:r ove1>flowed the avail~le shelves .and ali annex was created for their storage, In 1940, the Rathskell.ar served this function. Six year.s later·, the .present annex was esta;b!ished. Space Shormge Acute Many departments took on the storage of technical books con- cerning them, to try to alleviate the crowding i·li. the lib~·ary, yet today .the .Jibrary is filled to ca- pacity, and the annex has no available space left to accommo- da;te the surplus frorn· the main building. The library faces a dilemma. \There is no w'.here- to shelve the books that must •be purchased over the· coming summer. The inadequate space now available for student 1.1se cannot be com- pressed any further.\ This is what librarian Webb said from among the st~J.cks ().f rb~oks which -have beeh pushed into his office to gain space. A library is .effective and use- ful only as long as it is up to date, and can purchase and make available thhely literature.

Tickets for the jazz concert may b€l purcl)as- ed from fi•aternity representatives or at the Students' .Activities Of- fice. This modification serves little use except to delay the final vote by the Faculty ·Council. To tell a junior taking four upperlevel courses and one on the lower level that he may cut his four dfificult subjects with impunity, but must reglarly attend his easiest class would seem to be ridiculous.

RJK· Bed Count Union's present bout with the flu bug, Asian or other- wise, calls forth two observations. The first is' the effi:.. ciency and devotion with which Dr. Myron Weaver and his staff have combated the outbreak. The second is the peculiar lack of facilities exhibited by the Union College infirmary. Dr. Weaver's emergency quartering of ailing students and his treatment of these students under crowded and awkward conditions is to be commended. The reserve and wisdom he has displayed in the face of rumor and fever are equally comendable. The extra hours put into control- ling Union's near-epidemic are above commendation. However, the still active flu battle has pointed up a fact that is hard to explain, but which might easily have gone unnoticed in less fevered times. The infirmary Qf Union College, an institution with more than one thousand students in atendance, provides bed space for a total of six students. The proportion in other words, of infirmary beds to students is a disappointing 0.6 per cent. from the Jazz world.

Accord- ing to the Cril)lson, the second floor lounge of the Freshmart Un- ion :tt Harvard ·has ·beert lut ned into an infirmary for the dura- tion of an emergency. It is kno\·n however, that \in addt- tton to the 20 cases In. the in-firm- ary. that several mild cases, not serious enough for the infir!llary, are lying around outside.\ JAZZ C.ONCERT Just where and how Cnion's infirmary inadequacy mises is an interesting question. The fault obviously does not lie with Dr. Weaver and his staff who make the best of what facilities are at hand. We might question here, however, the use to which the annual general fee of fity dollars per student is being put. Roughly $26,000 from the general fund is budgeted toward medical expenses. Some proportions of this, we sugg·est, might be put toward a broadening of infirmary facilities. The need is present. JES Campus Frolics The weekend of the Union-RPI game traditionally has been a tirne .of g-reat student exuberance. In the past, groups of Umon and RPI students have done considerable damage to each other's campus. Though the football game has been called off this year, we fear that it will not cur- tail the excesses. We wish to remind Union students that they will be petsonally responsible for any damage which they commit. If a student escapes without being a-pprehended the Stu- dent Council must bear the cost. It should be noted that R.PI employs 24 campus policemen to cut down the chances of escaping without being apprehended. . DSP * * * Wesleyan, on the other hand, reports that to date the virus has made no· appeat:ance on . their campus. This startling statement is due in large part to the fore- sight of the Wesleyan Director of Health who placed an early order for vaccine and received * * * From the Wesleyan Argus comes the information that the Amherst Student has reported over 100 cases of flu, \presumably of the Asiatic variety;'' at Wil- liams, and quoted Williams Col- lege physician Dr. Thomas Van Urmy in calling it an \ex·plosive\ epidemic, with cases appearing at the rate of 25 and 30 per day.

One feels sympathy for Cap.. tain Boyle as he tries to hide 'his visits to the local \snug\ or bar from the probing inquiries of Juno. On the other hahd, how- ever, he !becomes detested as he squivms and c·rawls to keep from doing any work at all. The .Joxer, the captain's ever present side- kick, is a darlin' character. Professor W'ingate has recently finished working on the :blocking of the play, ana the cast is now in the process of memorizing their lines and mastering the heavy Irish dialect Which gives the play its flavor. The play will be dohe as an evening production. The Mountebal).~s are still in need of students in most lines of theatre work. There are open- ings in such diversified. fields as acting, electrical worlt, stage de- ~gning, set construction, ptLbUc- Jty, and. the many other eapacities necessary for the production of a play and the maintenance of a theatre and an organization. Freshman and upperclassmen can obtain further informatioh any evening at the Union College Theatre, or by speaking to a mem- ber of the Mounts-banks. Music Hall, Troy, N. Y. - Sun., Oct. 27 at 4 P.

UaofR.Men Paint Arthur ARTHUR ADORNED A group of Rochester students stole on campus last Thursday night and painted the Idol. How- ever, it was the wrong Idol. Ches- ter A.

The massive display is believed to be the first or its kind shown in this area. Four main exhibits will make . up the 25,000 square foot exposi- , tion. First of these will be the Atomie Energy Commission's Atoms for Peace exhibit, prepared .by the Commission as a means of bringing the latest developments in all fields of atomic energy to the attention and under:.standing of the general public. The next · exhibit will focus on the indus- trial a p p 1 i cat i o n s of atomic energy prepared by the Schenec- . tady pioneers, designers, and manufacturers of nuclear reac- tors. Liberal Arts Role Shown The third exhibit, prepared by the college; will show the role of the liberal arts and engineering college in the atomic age. The final exhibit, The Peaceful Atom, is a traveling United Nation's dis- play of peaceful uses of atomic energy. Professor Gordon Silber, Chairman of the Depart- ment of Foreign Languages, lectured on several aspects of his trip abroad in last Tuesday's chapel. Essentially he • spoke about the post-war relations between France and the United States. V acatjons Of Profs.

By t~e time he was 18, Henderson's interests had shiften to the popular music field and in 1938, he went .on a theatre tour as Judy Garland's accompan- ist. The tour ended in Hollywood where Skitch worked for NBC and studied conducting with Al- bert Coates.

Professor William Winne, the act- ing chairman of the Biology De- partment, commented that this was the greatest number of med- ical scholarships won in the bwelve years he has been teach- ing here . This year compares favorably with last when Union had only two winners. The winners of ·the Medical Scholarship are: Peter Cassileth, Bruce Boklan, Ira C. Halperin, Stuart Blum, Robert Howe, Bernard Grand and An- thony De Tommasf. Gerald Finke was awarded a Dental Scholar- ship. De Tommasi is in his first year at Albany Medical College. Elach year seventy-two scholar- ships are awarded to those under- graduates in New York State who achieve the highest score on the prescribed examination. Thirty- six of these are awarded to up- state residents and 36 to resi- dents of the metropolitan area. This year, of the seven winners, four were from upstate and three were from the New York City area. (Continued on Page 6) waine. According to a ten year old plan, the presence of the New York Thruway in the 'Schenec- tady area would require a num- ber of im·pr(wed ar>terial routes to cope with increased traffic. Among the suggested routes was a proposal to extend Nott Terrace, between the Schenectady Public Library and West College to join South Avenue at Seward Place, between the present Phi Sigma De Ita and Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity houses. The road would therefore run approximately in front of the President's House, the .Adminis- tration BuHding and Silliman Hall. IMcihyaine was quoted as say- ing that th.e result of such a road to the college would be \unfortun- ate\. The City Engineer was unavail- able for comment, but it was learned from a reliable Ooncordy source at city hall that municipal officials have already met with the trustees of the college, but the trustees \turned the plan down\.

The road would continue west, past the Delaware and .Hudson Railroad tracks, crossing the Mo- hawk River a few blocks west of campus.

The new work will be heard dur- ing the opening program of the second annual Schenec- tady Museum-Union College concert series, which will begin at 8:30 P. M. in Mem- orial Chapel. Featured on the occasion will be the Tri•City Symphony Orches- tra Under Professor Edgar Curtis, which will be opening its fifth season and making the first of its two scheduled appearances on the Museum-'College series. Another prominent guest artist will be pianist Walter Nollner of Wil- liamstown, Massa,chusetts, who will take part In a performance of Brahms' Ooncerto No. 2 for Piano and Orchestra. Began in 1954 Organized three years ago, ini- tially as a quartet, the Collier Quintet has distinguished itself for its outstanding interpretations of modern musical works. On January 21 of this year it was featured with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Sym- phony Orchestra in the world premiere of Mr. Symonds' new work. ' The R~n <Jollier Jazz Quintet will appear in Memorial Chapel Tuesday night at 8:30 P. M. The growp will perform Norman Symonds' \Concerto Grosso for Jazz Quintet and Symphony.\ in festivals in London and Am- sterdam. After moving to Toronto in 1951, he studied theory, harmony, counterpoint and orchestration with Mr. Delamont's son, Gordon Delamont, and also played in many of Canada's top dance bands and radio orchestras.

'Education and the Atom' Exhibit Will Open To·day in Field House By Willirum Wheeler The relationship between atomic energy and education wiH be the theme of An Ex· position on Educati()n and the Atom, a con~prehensive exhibit opening today in the Memorial Field House. The massive display is believed to be the first of its kind shown in this area. The Exposition on Education and the 'Atom took over two !lllOnths to pll'epare. Beginning today it will last until October 30. Four main ex.hibits will make up the 25,000 square foot exposi- tion. Fir-st of these will be the Atomic Energy Commission's Atoms for Peace exhibit, prepared by the Commission as a ·means of bringing the latest developments in all fields of atomic energy to the attention and understanding of the general :public. The next exhibit will focus on the indus- trial a p p 1 i c at i o n s of atomic energy prepared by the Schenec- tady pioneers, designers, and manufacturers of nuclear reac- tors. Silber Lectures in Chapel On French-U.S. Relations Professor Gordon Silber, Chairman of the Depart- ment of Foreign Languages, lectured on several aspects of his trip abroad in last T1:1esday's chapel. Essentially he -----------~·spoke about the post-war V acatjons Of Profs. Vary Union College's faculty mem- bers returned to their college classrooms last month after a wide variety of summer activities ranging from writing, research, study, jobs in industry, travel, and working on degrees to \just taking it easy and catching up on reading.\ An informal survey among the full-time faculty members showed that the largest group, some twenty-five, took paying jobs dur- ing the summer to supplement their incomes. Eight of these held jobs as teachers while· another six worked for General Electric Company in Schenectady and in Lynn, doing pt·imarily administra- tive duties. The remainder were engaged in work varying from the operation of a forty acre apple orchard to water analysis for the State Health Laboratories in Albany. Geographically they were seatter- ed from Maine, where one was a director of a marine biological station, to California, where an- other was doing classified work for a corporation. Study and research activities claimed the work of the next laregst group, some twenty. The range of work in this group was almost as varied as the former. Several were working on doctoral theses or preparing new courses for the coming year at Union. ·One professor set up a new course at 'Cornell for telephone .company engineers, while research activ- ities covered' labor relations on one hand and a project with the College's electron microscope on the other. ' The activities of this group took them all the way from Nova Scotia, where one professor was studying Anti...Stratfordians, to the West, where another was studying power installations in the Rockies. relations between France and the United States. Professor Silber expressed con- cern \that we have fallen so far short of our goal of achieving world leadership.\ He put the blame for this squarely on the shoulders of the present admin- istration which he feels has often .been \ignorant of the approaches that would ·be effective in reach- ing people O·f other countries.\ Professor Sihber seems to feel that this inadequacy can be trac- ed to the too-frequent rotation of career personnel, the lack of preparation for these positions, and to the evils of the spoil's system in American J.>Olitics. Tourists Give ~Poor Impression Our best representatives abroad, Silber said, are students, profes- sors, and our European stati[)ned top U. S. ·businessmen. This last group, Professor Silber noted. is the very best inform~d and the very .;best spokesmen we have. To the average American tourist he offered the advice that they be less ostentatious and more courteous to the European. Sil- ber, a professor of .French and Italian, stressed the importance of learning the basic words of the major European languages. He praised the foreign students and businessmen who are ·best able to interpret Americans and the American way of life to 'their countrymen. A high spot of his trip, Pro- fessor Silber added, was reunions with former French and Dutch help students from who he brings greetings to the Union student body. In conclusion Professor Silber said as a result of this trip he had confirmed two convictions a,bout American colleges and uni- versities in general, and Union College in particular which he had originally made upon the return of a similar trip in 1952. He applauded the accessi•bility and friendliness which \form a part of our tradition of educa- tion\ and contrasted it with the strict formality of the continental educational system. He also praises the \.Anglo-American\ tra- dition of residential colleges and uni-versities and their concern for the whole person of the student. He ended his lecture with the statement that for him, \the Seine g1eems no brighter than the brook that bounds.'' Liberal Arts Role Shown The third exhibit, prepared by the college, will show the role of the liberal arts and engineering college in the atomic age. The final exhibit, Th.e Peaceful A~m, is a traveling United Nation's dis- play of peaceful uses of atomic energy. The opening will climax two months of intense work in pre· paration of the displays and in publicizing the event. Two thou- sand posters, designed by Wayne Nowack, new art instructor at Union, have been sent with vari- ous letters and memoranda to sec- ondary schools in New York and adjoining New England states, and to local businesses and the press. Fincke Name<! Coordinator The Student Council has named Gerald Fincke as Open House Co- ordinator. Fincke, working with the Public Relations and Admis- sions offices, vvill take the re- sponsibility for supplying all the students needed to man the Ex- position and to se!\Ve as tour guides. The panel construction and painting is being done under the supervision of William Ma- thias. Several pieces of literature are being prepared for distribution to all visitors at the Exposition.

The exhibit itself, the first of th:r.ee such exhibits scheduled for this year has been designed S.Pecifically for the enlig-htenment of laymen, and its aim is as ambitious as it is laudable. Few would deny the importance of recent develop- ments in the field of atomic physics, hut certainly -more than a few lack the hasic understanding of these develop- ments necessary for fullest appreciation. That Union Col- lege has been willing to undertake the task of setting be- fore the general public a clear and valuable exposition of such developments is an indication that education may be carried beyond the sphere of the classroom into the sphere of everyday living. The Ol'ganizers of the Atoms for Pe~e program, in particular, Mr. Brown Wakefield, Union's recently-acquired and able Director of Publicity, should be recognized for their vision and contribution. Their program is not only forwari!-looking and worthwhile; it is successful as well The exhibits themselves, as well as the anticipated turn- out, justify their efforts.

Dormitory Blackout An eclitorial comment appeared in the Hamilton Spectator last week criticizing what were called \unre~s­ onable\ 1·estrictions on dormitory visitors. The restrJc- tions nfened to in this article were, of course, those dealing with feminine g-uests and the questions raised at II.amilton might as easily be raised here. A Grief suryey of 'Cnion's campus reveals that only one of three dormitories maintains a lounge of any pre- tensions at all. This is not to suggest that lounge facilities shcmlcl. be immediate!\· installed in both North and South Colleges. Itather. we mig-ht suggest that a few clear modi- fications of present visitor regulations I?igh~ make it possible to accommodate female guests w1th httle or no sacrifice of propriety. The most siO'nificant modification suggested by such a policy would p~rmit dormitory inmates to. e;ntertain fe- male guests in their rooms, under the admomtwn that the doo1· must remain open or at least slightly ajar. An added condition is that no less than two couples be present in a room at one time. Whether the Hamilton suggestions would prove prac- ticable or not is an interesting and somewhat baffling question. In anr case, it would seem that certain visi~or's hom·s might be instituted during \Vhich students might receive female guests \vith impunity. If the hours so designated were spec:i fie ally defined, the possibility of un- o-entlemanlv conduct could be lessened and probably pre- ~luded. · In an~· e\·ent, it would seem that the present d01mitory blackout on female visitors is somewhat unrealistic and perhaps too idealistic. The eventualities which the dormi- tot·~· regulations seek to prevent are beyond doubt taking plac~ in spitE:' of anrl possibly even because of present restrictions. Eve was, after all, the first but not the last mortal to realize that f01·bidden fruits are the most desir- able.

In, announcing plans for this nationwide salute to the game, 'Chester J\. LaRoche, J>resident of the Foundation, reported comple- tion of preliminary drawings for the new Football Hall of Fame which will be built on the Rutgers University campus at New Bruns- wick, N. J. The national shrine will be constructed virtually on the site where Princeton and Rut- gers played· the first intercollegi- ate football game 88 years ago. Mr. La!Roche said that desig- nation of tiie week of Nov. 11 as National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame week was intended to focus increased attention on the values of football as a vital character building sport which must continue as ali essential part of the nation's educational pro- cess. Harriers To Face Colgate Union college runners talle the field against a weak Colgate group tomorrow afternoon be- tween halves o.f the Union-ffi:obart football gar:ne. Since 1954, the G~rnet has h~d little troubl-e with Colgate, best- ing lhem in. 19115 by a perfect 15 -46 score, and last year defeating the Red Raiders 23-3'5. In the over-al! series Union holds a 11-7 lead. 'rhe only uncertain factor in tomorrow's ·running progra:m is the appeara:nce of first man Tom Hoffman. Hoffman contracted Asiatic Flu last weekend and will probably not. compete against Col- gate. Coach Bill Ketz .feels that a well-rested Hoffman wil] •be of more value in the tough :Novern2 ber 2 mee't against Alfred. Tl'ial Pleases Ketz Statesman Game Second Vict·im of Flu The Uni0n-Hobart football game, scheduled for tomor- row afternoon at 2 P.M. has ueen cance11ed, according to Bill Ketz, Director of Ath- letics. The reason given was Asiatic flu.

' ''In a big company, a young man can get to tackle big jobs'' \The thing that has impressed me most in my two years at General Electric,\ says 28~year-old Yusuf A. Yoler, manager of Aerodynamics Laboratory Inves- tigations, \is the challenging opportunity open to young people here_ My field is guided-missile research -the nation's top-priority defens~ job. Because of the scope of the company's research and development program, I've had the opportunity to work with tech- nical experts in many related fields. And I've seen at first hand the responsibility which General Electric has given to younger men- proof to me that in a big company a young man can get to tackle big jobs.\ The reseai-ch being done by Dr. Yusuf A. Yoler is significant not only to himself, but to General Electric and the security' of the nation as welt A.t present, the company is participating as a prime contractor on three of the four long-range ballistic missiles pro- gramed by thep. S. government. Yoler, who is play- ing an important role in this work, directed the design and development of the world's largest hypersonic shock tunnel- a device which will \test-fly'' missile nose cones at speeds over 15,000 mph. Progress in research and development- as well as in every other field of endeavor-depends on how well young minds meet the challenge of self-development, At General Electric there ate more than 29,000 col- lege graduates, .each of whom is given the opportunity t~ develop to h1s fu!Jest abilities. In this way, we be- lieve, everybody benefits -the individual, the com- pany, and the country. -,;mgress li Ot~r Alosf lm;ol'ftilnf Ptotlvd - GENERAL- ELECTRIC ;-,1 ... •',- ,.,., ,, !- <j .: ,; YO 'I -·-.- L Pat Ttt tin! bra or · terE nat <M: Trm .son Wei: grot star1 usin The' tion' pem \pie1 ance migl d·onc M: was lege' don~ end nom ad de the Schc Pr that with brar the Spri set Com for · Tl 400,C twic ent the fice1 clas: lang thes shor neer H ' ~ A1 Bur Uni• the Jow has and schc Ei1 den1 Che arti• e:ffo lege fielc cific disc has ·seve ers R• of Enn Che Stitt olic cent Bia.r tion scie: pre I fie1c ilar U!lil rep< obse the and trar A ne.ct B.S. try Inst gree Uni ·her 192~ tM ICol: side Sch
