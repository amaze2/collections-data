Coach Harkness wants lall the men who turned eut last :fall to r.epor.t as well as any new candidates who may be interested ~n trying to make a berth on the :team. Because of the fact that many of the veterans from Iai;t · year's squad will be out for posi- tions again this season, the compe- tition will be unusually keen. Hark- ness is anxious to start training the men so as to put them in good physical condition for the coming games with some of the festest teams in the East. At the meeting to~orrow th~ principal business will be the distribution. of equip- ment to the men. For the first few practices the coach intends to have the men pass the ball around, while later the regulat· scrimmagef:l 'wHl . take place. The squad will continue practicing next weel!: if the weather is favorable. Among those of 'la::Jt year's squad who appeared in. the fall pr.~ctice and who will probaply report for spring ·training are: Captain Al- drich.

THE CONCOR])IEJNSIS, TUESDAY, 1\{ARCI! 10, 1931. hy we spend $2,000,008 to put i• the new <> ' ' • WE haveLeen in the tobacco business a long time dowiJ here at Winston-Sa~em and we tal{e a lot of p:ricle in the qua:li ty of the dgarettes we make. While \We have spent a good many million dollars adv~J.·tising Ca:mels, we've always held to the old fashioned idea that the thing that really conn ts is what we put Into our cigarette and not 'vh.at \'ve say about it. If we ]mow anything about tobacco, and we think wed~, Camels contain the choicest Turk- ish and fhe IneUowest, ripest dmnestic leaves that mon~ycan buy. l~1. fact w'e have e!ery reason to he proud of the quality of Camels as they come from the factory, h11t the remarl{ of an old friend of ours ft·om Den'Ver son1e time ago emphasized a point that has been the problem of the cigarette industry fo:t· )Cars. As he inllaled the sn'Poke from a Camel we gave him in OUJ;' offices one morning, he sighed \ivith very evident enjoyment and then asked jokingly, ''\What is this, a special blend re- served for Camel executives?\ \Certah1ly not,\ \\'e told him. \This package ·of Camels -was hough t at the corner store this . ,; mornmg. \Well~'~he said, ''I've been a dyed in the wool Camel sinolter fo1• a good many years, but upon my soul I 11~W\I' got a cigarette as good as this in Denver. If you would give the rest of the world the kind ~f Camels you sell here in Winston- Salem, you ought to have all the cigarette busi- ness there is.'' LIAT stat.entent simply em- phasized a§ain the cigarette industry~s. J.nost important prohlem .. The more we thought about it., the surer we were that he was dead right, au,<J. that somehow, something; 1nus t he done. Denvei' ~~·sn't getting a fair break. Neither in fact was any other town. The only peo- ple who rea.lly kne'v how good Camels co1t1dbe,wei'e the folks right he:re in Winston-Salem, That was due to a factor ilo cigarette rnanufac'tm·er had ever been able to control. Naturally thel'e is no differ- ence whatever in the quality ... ·· ' . tt AMEL e1garei.·· es tiMID OR ACK • of the tobaceo in Camels~. whether you buy them in Winston-Salem, Denver or Tinibuc- too. But up to now there lias been a very real difference in the condition (){ the cigarettes by the time they reached the sm.ol{er. The flavor .and mildness of fine tobacco depend upm1 the retention of its natural, not added, moisture content \ivhich is prime at about ten per cent. In spite of our ,great pains always to make sure Camels left the factory with just the right amount of n.atura:I moist1:ll!e, no cigarette pack• age had ever yet been design~d that could pre• vent that precious moit:~ture from drying out. THERE are three things about a cigarette that can sting the tongue and unkindly burn the throat. (I) ClaeaJI toht~eeos. (2) Partieles ol peppe'I'IJ dust felt In tlae tolJaeco because oTin.elllelent elesn• i''fJ 1neth.ods. (3) A purehetl dry ee•4litlon ol the to• buc.eo due te less oFraaU.ral moisture bg overlteating or ~~aporutlon. Always certain of the quaUty of our tobaccos we had already made Camel a \dustless\ c~g­ arette by the use of a specially designed vacuum cleaning apparatus exclusive 1dth our factory. Now, if we could perfect a package that would actually act as a humidor a:nd retain the natu- ral moisture content, theiJ. Yuma, Arizona, could enjoy Cantels as m:u«Jh. as we do here at Winstc:m- Salem. We knew what we wanted. We tried many things. We asked the Pittsburgh Testing Laboratory to help us. After m11n.y experiments and humidity tests covering all methods of packing cigarettes came the detailed report of which this is the net: (A) No existing cigarette pack• age, including those wrapped 'in glas~ine paper or ordinary cellophane~ gives anything like adequate ·protection against evaporatiuJJ.. (B) All dgorettes so packed tend to dry out rapidly from the day they are released from the factory. (C) Only a waterproof mate• rial with a apecially devised air-tlght seal could give the .desired protection. (D) This measure, while costly, could he relied on to keep Camels in prime condition for at least three months in any climate. If you have a technical bent, the graph bel'ow made by the Pittsburgh Testing Laboratory will show yott the exact results of their ex• ·haustive study.

We cheeked it and re-chec)(ed. it and then we went ahead. We tried this device and that. At last we me1: success. The air-.tight wrapping involved the designing of spec:lt•l processes, special machines. That costs a lot of money, more than $2;000, .. ()()() the first yea:r, but after you have tried Camels packed this modern new way we are sure you wiU ag:ree it is a fine investment. For some time now every Camel that has left our factory has gone out in this new Humidor Pack. We have said nothing about it -untR ~ow, to make sure your dealer would be able to supply you when the good news came out. Camel smokers of course have already dis- CJovered that their favorite cigarette is better and milder now than ever before. If you aren't a Camel smoker, 'try them just to see what a dift'el!ence there reallY is. between harsh, dried out tobacco and a properly con ... ditioned cigarette. f ou can feel the diJference., you can hear the dijference and you cer.tainly can taste ~the dif· /erence. Of course we're .prejudiced. We always have believed that CaJD.el is the world's best cigarette. Now we know it. Just treat yourself to Camels in the :new Humid(jr Pack and see i£ you don't agree. a.

Again peo:ple talk excitedly of: Yt</VIs 11 Burn:ing Air 11 When a public display of gas lighting was given in London in I 802. to celebrate · the Peace of Amiens, people talked ex- citedly.ofburning air. N apo1eon called it a grand folly, and Sir Walter- Scott wrote that the world was going mad. Thus was ushered in the er:t ofgas illu- mination. It lasted for 75 years. Then electricity ~tole the :field and the.gas giant dozed through a quarter century; used chiefly for kitchen cookery. Now it reawakens in a chang~d world, to new possibilities, greater op-po_rtunities. Eighty thousand miles of pipe lines al- ready laid, extensively equipped with Crane valves and fittings, prove that the old problem ·of transportation is solved. Pipe lilJ,es crisscrossing the country as numerously as electric power 9hes are freely predicted. . · .. What has brought this second greater gas era? The answer is: piping materials. Thanks to these, gas men can. say for the first time that they are able to pipe gas in enormous quantities from Amarill0 ·gas- fields to Chicago, from. isola.ted natural gas fields to users everywhere ... No matter what field of engineering. you take up on graduation,- 'you ¥ViR find its future and its growth interwoven with the development of piping materials. And, as in the past this development has, time after time, been first reflected-in the com- plete Crane line, it will pay you to keep in touch with Crane. research and Crane materials.

Note that Camels are completely en- c'lll$ed. in an outer transparent cover. of m:oistttre~proof cellophane and sealed air-tight at every point. We call this outer shell the Humidor . . . Pack. It differs from the ordinary cello- phane pack and w~le it is egg-shell thin, it means .a lot m terms of cigarette enjoyment •. It means, fc>r instance, that evapora• tion is checkmated and that Salt La],,e eity can now have as good Camels as Winston• Salem. The llu:midor Pack insures that. It prevents the fine tobaccos of Camels from dryin,g ·out and losing any of their delightful flavor. Aside from cheap tobacco, two fac• tors in a cigarette can mar the smoker's pleasure: Fine particles ofpeppery dust if .left in the tobacco by inefficient cleaning methods sting and irrita·te delicate throat membrane .• Dry tobacco, robbed of its natural moisture by scorching or by evapora- tion gives off a hot smoke that burns the thrfnit with evety inhtil!ation. We take .. every· precaution against these factors here at Winston-Salem.
