'l'heGeneral Electric Company produces other electrical appa- ratus which makes it possible to transmit power over great distances. It has put electricity in seven-league boots. In its laboratories, scientists are now experimenting with voltages ten times as great as the high- est now in use. If you are interested inlearning more about what electricity is doi11g, write for :Reprint No. AR391 containing a complete set :of these advertisements. GENERAL EL·ECTRIC Back in 1885, Thomas A. Edison succeeded in transmitting electricity at 2~0 volts for one mile -an achievement and a promise. The promise was fulfilled a few months ago, when electricity at 2 20,000 volts was transmitted two hundred and forty miles to supply Los Angeles with light and power. Now five billion dollars are invested in electric power plants. A s~upendous figure that testifies to the alertness of thoQsands of college-trained men who h:1ve b::!en leaders in the production and use of electric power. The electrical era has only dawned. Each year some new machine or discovery makes it possible to apply electricity in unexpected ways. The graduate of today will find electricity directly· or indirectly a means for even greater accom- plishments, no matter what his calling in life may be. It-It DB SCHENECTADY.

This realism is strik- ingly manifested in the \Dead Christ\ ·by Hans Holbein whom }.fr. Cortissoz classified as \the realist of realists.\ The Madonna was a subject favorite among these artists who portrayed her SMART CLOTHES oi FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC MAKES SMART SUITS-SMART HATS-SMART OVERCOATS- SMART HOSE-SMART HABERDASHERY with statcly serenity ~ the setting of ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~= the exquisite finery of the Venetian and Flore11tine interiors. The painting of Michael Angelo were not so impressive to him, Mr. Cor- tissoz said, from the sublimity of their religious fervor, but rather from the individuality of Michael Angelo im- pressed upon them. To emphasize his point :..Ir. Cortissoz called attention, in the \Creation of Adam,\ to the nmscular tension, the grace, yet strength, \.Yhich ~Iichael Angelo gave to his Iutman forms. The individual impress is strongly presented in the exquisite design and symmetry, so marked of H.aphacl, in the beautiful \Sistine ).ladonna.\ }.1 r. Cortissoz was enthusiastic over this painting, outlining its qualities of human warmth and companionship, its majestic and soothing sense .of mother love, set placidly in the most perfect design, and symmetry, ::\ot to aHy small extent in contrib- uting to the beauty and emotional po·wer of these paintings, }.fr. Cortis- soz brought out, was the fact that their authors seized upon, for their subjects to portray, the dramatic in the Scriptures. The crucifixion was a favorite theme because to them it rep- resented the world's greatest tragedy.· Tintoretto created masterly portrayals in his \Crucifixion\ and his depiction of \St. Michael Driven from Heaven,\ while the \Tribute 1foney\ and the \Entombment\ of Titian, Van Dyck's · \Kiss of Judas\ and the \Samson and Delilah\ of Rembrandt are other ex- 1 amples of the love of the striking, the dramatic, in the themes of these painters. Mr. Cortissoz declared that the· greatness of a painting does not come from a school, or an age, but that these pictures were great because their! painters knew how to paint from the point of view of the craftsman. Mr., Cortissoz used the painting in the i Church of the Ascension in New York City by the American artist, John La-! Farge, to bear out his contention, de-, daring it to be \one of the great mas-' tcrpieces, i10t only of modern times, 1 but of aJ.l times.\ The .lectures will be resun1ed on May \· 11 and 12 when Mr. Cortissoz will dis- cuss \Whistler\ and \The Modern-' ists.\ Garnet Tennis T earn to Play in New York Leaving Albany by hoat for New; York City last night; the varsity ten-/ nis team will engage in matches with New York university and Pratt in-j stitute on Friday and Saturday, re-. spectively.

Do College Students Insure 'I1heir Lives? The Answer Seems to be'~Yes\ D(JYouKnow Thl;l.t in a test recently made with upper~class students of both sexes in fourteen representative colleges, 140 out of 351 ~aid they carried life insurance policies? It is significant that 40% of undergraduates have insur• ance on their lives-a notable advance over what prevaHed twenty, or even ten, years ago. This shows that college stu• dents and their parents think Hfe insurance is of' co,nsider· able use in connection with •the educational program. Parents believe in it because they have something invested for the benefit of their chil· dxen. Students -realize that their lives have an economic value.

But opposed to this I =~rr~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~;!~~~~~~~~~~;;~;~---~-~~-~-~~~~~~~~~;---~;=~ idea of honor there is another which 1 completely defeats the purpose of the: first, for it is almost universally preva-, lent among the students. This code of! honor forbids \telling on\ any fellow; ~tudent who is guilty of a violation.: This feeling is real; it is sincere. Every: student shares it in some degree. In j fact, if some speeches were made about I it. it would undoubtedly become a: tradition. i Such an attitude on the part of the I students is the real cause of the failure, of the Honor System. There are col- 1 leges in which cheating is held in gen- j era! abhorence. It is reported_ that at I Stevens a cheat, when caught in the act, was actually .thrown out of the class by his fellow students. At other i ins.titutions a de·tected violation • amout).ts to social ostracism, which in I a college community must be far worse 1 than breaking on the wheel. I The inevitable effect a£ a proctor system will be a still greater abas~ment of honor in regard to ~;h~ating.

For an hour or more I had lazily turned over the pages of \B ··t· 1 p , • II Is 1 oems . fhen I began to dream of love and romance · t d b . ' as pte urc y some of the authors ui the book. Soon I felt a growing d·esire for excitement. I was sud- denly restored to full consciousness by the peremptory tinkle of the telephone bell. Probably it was one of the boys calling up to find out ahout an assignment. No, the voice was that of a woman, one which I could not remember having heard before. Much to my amazement she called me by name and immediately b-egan to talk as though we were intimate friends. After fifteen or twenty minutes conYersation, dHring which she convinced me that she knew me, she invited me to call on her that evening. Responding to my desire for excitement, I set out almost immediately to find this mysterious woman. In the meantime I was trying to picture her. Was she j-ust a common woman ot the streets, or was she a young thing who craved excitement too? Would she be fair to look upon or was she homely and withered? Her voice had given me the impression of a pleasant young business woman e-v·idently of some culture, but then, voices can be deceiving. My ·ad\•entme led me to the other side of the town, not ex- actly the residential section. The number which I sought proved to be a cheap apartment.

Senor ] ores' latest and most p~ngen t comedy-drama-tragedy-farce was rec·eived last evening by an unusually brilliant audience of last nighters with such marked enthusiasm that several times the ap-. plause of more than a score of daqueurs was heard. It was gen-1 'erally conceded by the ofdest inhabitants to be one of the worst 1 successes since John L. Sullivan appeared in that pathetic little I playlet, \Jabbing Jeffery's Jiblets,\ or, \Out of the Gutter into the I To the Marco Polos of 1925 S-ewer.\ ' The play oozed from the pen of Senor ]ores, one of our most powerful and insidious younger playwrights, and was admirably plagiarized from the play of th-e same name by the same author. The play opens, like all current New York successes, in a love nest atop Washington Arch but is quickly transferred, due to the refusal of the leading lady-Beautiful Beatrice Larkin-to antag- onize the censors or her publick, to the bedroom of the Doily Sisters where fhe main action takes place. I For no reason at all the scene suddenly shifts to the bedroom 1 of the Doily Sisters where we fh1d the .wicked squire, admirably played by Heartl-ess Duhee, confronting the poor girl with her pledge to _the Chapel fund. The \vicked squir.e chases Little Eva, clad only in \teddies\, across the weeping cakes of ice while the bloodhounds follow trying to seH Prom tickets. Suddenly a hil- arious happening happened. The house electrician, admirably played by T-ed Erdman, acci- dently sat too heavily on the fuse box causing all the lights in the house to go out. The action was temporarily trartsf·ered from the stage to the audience. Police Commissioner Tom Gould prevented this critic's hope of a panic by shouting, \Anything you say will be held against you\. Act II opens with a short hour's speech by Arch Wemple en- titled, \My Dreadful Experiences: On The Nightboat''. After the ushers had awakened the snoring audience, the curtain rose on Gilda Green \en deshabille\ about to retire for the day. She sii1gs, Tuck Me To Sleep with Bud Campbell on the piano. Meanwhile she shakes a meart torso. Suddenly the bloodhounds enter through the skylight arid recite \Quarta Gin\ in unison.- The place is raided but the boys manage to hide tmder the t·ug .. When the cops have left the lads toss the braz-en bag in a blanket artd the curtain descends.

D ID the world hold more to be conquered in the days of courtly adventurers than it does for daring knights of '25? Does no far- off Cathay, no passage to India, beckon today? Perhaps not; but that's no reason for dis- appointment. Graduates ofl925 can look about them without sighing for worlds to conquer. There's high adventure in the lanes of busi .. ness. Hidden riches underfoot. The ver:y hugeness of modern business demands bigger vision than ever before. Thinking must be on a scale so large and unfettered by prece- dent as to try any man's mental equipment. Here;swhere college graduates have proven their mettle. Here's where they have justified th~;Jir training. And here they may indulge their fancy fot· exploring new fields. ~stern Electric Company Since 1869 1114kers and distribzttors or ekctrical equipment Number SO of a series
