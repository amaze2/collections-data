HOC'i<well I•'HlDAY, JANBAH.l' 6, 192o ·with the commencement of the ne\V calendar yea1· and the formation of the customary resolu- tions, it might be well for the Student Body as a whole to resolve that it begin at once whole~ heartedly to support .its basketball team and to continue this sup~ort throughout tl1c season. It might also be well to resolve that the sup]wrt be encouraging rather thnn boorish and disagreeable to members of the sqund. l·~n'r since the adoption of the various sports existing at Union, the students have been justly proud of their successful athletes, of thei1· mem- bers who have mptmed trophies of the sport • world, of their teams which have w·on honor by mn·ying their colors to vidot'y. The students have also taken a ,just pride in the .athletes who have not broken records, who have lost hard- fought games, and w]w have carried the Garnet to defeat. All have served their Alma Mater to the hPst of their abilities, at the same time playing the role of gentlemen and good sports before their college and the opposing teams. During the last few years, especially in basket- ball, Cnion has been unusually fortunate for a college of its size in having teams which :have been able to outscore opponents and play a clean game at the same time. And it has been no great diffi- culty for the Student J3ody also to act like gentle- men and to sup,port teams most loyally under these eitTumshmccs. Ally Student Body would :find it l'R.SJT to support teams of such unusual caliber. But at a few of the home games dm·ing last win- ter's basketball season, even games from which the Garnet finally emerged victorious, tllC conduct of the local cheering section was far from that which should have been slunvn by men of the traditional Union spirit. Referees were frequently aided from the stands, comments were made upon ,the personal appearance of the opposing players, and the visit- ing teams as a whole were given to understand that tlw.v werC\ not of the social elit~. On the annual Christmas trip to New York Cit;·, the prC>sent basketball team dropped a:l'l three of its games to the metropolitan quints. This was no more than could be exp~cted, as .the city teams were all strong fives with the advantage of much more practice, and all three were playing upon home territ01·y. Witl1 as much experience, the Garnet will probably soon hit its stride and up- hold the creditabe record already set. But it needs the support of the students, and not their hostility. In spite of what recent records seem to show, it. must he remrm be red that it is not the sacred moral obligation of visiting teams to bow to Union, but it is tl1e duty of the students to back the team with a lifd.ikc and courteous spirit f.i•om the first game of the season tl1rough to the last.

The quintet surely nnt!'·t haye been convinced t·herc is ·no Old Nick. N en·rtheless, there is one rrdt:emi-ng .fratml' ahout the initial series of scrhnm:agcs and that is thr games werr haHlcr fc;ntght tl·Jan the scores would indi- cate. All ·of which shows that the Garnet has an up a·nd c0minp; court oat:ti.t this season. It must be ad- mitted that Cnion has a grr.en team t·his ye:tr. Before the first game the men had not played enough together in order that they mi£?;ht get used to each othl'r. T-Ire first tht·l'e games show clearly that matl'rial and abiWy is J~r·cscnt and that the sqHad needs more .JHact.ice to find its stride. * * * 'Ponight the Garne.t should win o~·cr C0lumhia despite the fact that Bill Reiger of the Lions 1ViU be back in the lineu-p. The Blue am! \Vhitc has had a \'l'ry poor year so far and its team is not ·of thl' calibre it usually is. In .\Ianhattan College the l'nion College basketball team will find a more fonnidable combination than Cohtmbia will offet·. The Jaspers han b<'en nn- bl'a·ten so far this season an<;[ in addi,tion are out for revenge for the defeat suffered at the hands of Coach Bill Hardmans cohorts two yC'ars ago in }Jew Y·oFk. * * * There always seems .to be an unfortuna,tc incident which appears to mar the brilliance of a football season. This year it is the apparrnt break in relations betwl'cn the Army and the Navy owr the! eligibility of 11layers. The bone of contention is G\'er the equality of compe- tition bl'twern the Service teams and t:he eligibility ruk at \Nest Point which )lNmits thl' Army to have older and more experienced playcrs than the Na·vy. Thc con- scnsns of opinions among football coaches is that West Point has had a vast advantage in the past owr Annapolis because of the age limit and that neither university should have eligibility advantages. Eddencc that Army authorities still hope for a settlement is sern in the fact that the 1928 date for the Army-Navy game is being held open by the 1\lilitary Academy despite feelers already received from several colleges which de- sire to takl' Na,·ys placC' on the t\rmy srhcduk * * * Syracuse has dropped boxing, vvrestling, ·fencing, tennis, hockey, golf, ,soccer and rifle from its sport program and has retained football, basketball, rowing·, track, cross-country, lacrosse, swimming and wate1· polo. The move is made with the joint adoption of a big program of intt·amural and inter-fraternity athll'tics. The plan was originaHy to have gonC' into effect this year but dne to student sentiment and reconoideration on the part of th<' athletic council the minor sports will continue for the remainder of this year. The purposrs of the idea appear to encourage as many stud!'nts ~s possible to participate in some form of sport and exer- cise and to decrrase expenses and losses. * * * Forty-five of 71 college football captains elected for next season, or almost two·thircls of the total, are line- men and the remaining 26 are backfield players. Gone arc thl' days when it was tl1e thiing for the quarterback to be the leader. The huddle has contributed something toward eliminating the quarter for now in the huddle system the captain, even though a liineman, can decide what play is to be executed. Of the 45 linemen chosen as captains for next year, 16 are tackles, 13 are guards, nine arc ends and seven are centers. Fottr colleges, Vermont, Iowa State, Nebraska and Indiana, will ha·ve dual captaincies. * * * According to the sttggestions for the reform of foot- ball proposed last year by President Ernest M. Hopkins of Dartmouth, the Univ.ersity of Michigan will have two football elevens next season. Director Fielding H. Yost is endeavoring to schedule sixteen games, two to be played on each Saturday of the 1928 campaign, and it is a certainty that on ·the days Michigan meets two opponents, one of the contests will be played .away from home. Michigan's action comes as a result of a resolution passed by the Big Ten officials a:t their meeting in Chicago a shor·t time ago. Every member ' of- the Big Ten is permitted ·to 1 card two games each Saturday and is not restricted to home and home scrim- mages. The regular schedule, as previously a1tnounced; 'will be followed and in addition' each member is al- 'lowed \o contract cigb t mot'C games, to· be, played in the. san;e eight-weeks; period.

The Spanish Northern Railway reports that the American equipment with which in 1924 the railroad electrified a mountainous section of its lines from Ujo to Pajareshas accomplished the following economies: 1. A 55% saving in the cost of power. 2. A reduction of 40% in the number of engine miles for the same traffic hc.ncl~d. 3. A savi:pg of73}1% in the cost of repai!\s and upkeep for locomotives. 4. A saving of 63% in crCYl expenses. 5. A . reduction of 31% in the cost of moving a ton- kilometer of freight.

Mauger TUESDAY, ITANUARY 10, 1928 'Ve are living in or passing through an age of experimnetation in every field of human aC'tivity. Education, though it possesses a greater historical background and is interwoven very strongly with tradition, and precedent, is nevertheless subject to differentiation in method. ·we are now witnessing an experiment which has been instituted at the University of Wisconsin by Dr. Alexander Meiklejo'lm, former president of Amherst college. This is based on the principle of greater freedom of indi,vidual expression or adapt- ation on the part of the student. It is an informal gathering without obligation or duress, usually held in the comfort of the students' dorms and with no systematic attempt at quiz or recitation. lfpon close analysis it appears to some of us that, in an institution such as our own which is composed largely o( students recently graduated from secondary schools, there must be an element of regulation and compulsion in the curriculum in order to produce the best results. Not having had the benefit of a gradual transition from strictly supervised to a non regulative system of study, the student is apt to become altogether sluggish, haphazzard, loose in his application to his require- ments. Without any definite schedule he can effect no concentration on the subject as a whole and consequently coherence in the subject is lost to him. The subject becomes to him me1·ely a sus- pension of facts, gathered together at intervals of time. Wha.t is there to be said in its favor? It is true a first impression of this radical innovation is one of astonishment at its almost reckless dar- ing. But if we ar:e to assume that, with all worldly opinions to the contrary, a college man is nevertheless committed to a pursuit of educa- tion, then will he not cooperate witl1 a plan that is intended to improve his method of study? In the Meiklejohn plan, he is permitted to spend as little or as much time on the subject as his own interest and inclination dictates. By that selective process he naturally leans to those subjects which are more definitely suited to his ability and in- stinctive desire_ This would create a more favot•- able response on his part to the professor and would naturally tend toward a greater spirit of unity in the class; all ,tending toward greater accomplishment. The informal atmospl1ere or dis- cussion existing helps to build up a fraternal atti- tude between instructor and the instructed. As to the danger of the ,student becoming indifferent in his work we have the statement of the student at lVisconsin to the effect that \sometimes we wish for more definite schedules but when we find ourselves loafing we make out a schedule of our own, allotting so much time to work, so much time to recreation and other activities.\ This statement alone shows that the plan makes for responsibility; responsibility makes .foi' character; the stimuli to achieve greater things. Those in favor of the plan argue that the student at cdllege has enough abil- ity to plan his own hours of study. Here at Union we are interested in the possi- bilities of the plan as ll<Pplied to this campus. Naturally this plan could he applied 1vith varying results anywhere but because of the particular SCHENECTADY, N. Y., TUESDAY, J-ANUARY 10, 1928 I fet Th£ Grecian Dreamj I ' THE GAZEITE PRESS A ..

Spea·king of vacations we believe that the length of every vacaHon should be increased about three days and that it should be required that the last three days should be spent at the college. Such a con- dition, however is not greatly different from the situ- ation as it exists at present. 1\'c come back in the midd·le of the week and for the ·first two days no one has the assignments, P_ S. courses excepted. By the third day the urge to catch up sleep lost during vaca- tion becomes paramount and it then becomes a question of whether to sleep in Class or in bed, and our New Y car's resolution to do every day's work every day is completely shattered and beyond repair. * * * * ' \Ve find that the Schcnectadians, following the lead of Pinkham's store have decided that the Christmas spirit should prevail all year and have decorated Union street and Union avenue with a string of red and green lights that blink spasmodically. It has been infe.rred that these same lights create a s.pirit somewhat different than a Christmas spirit in drivers who happen to hit the signals the wrong >Yay. * * ·* * * vVe also absenT that the mound builders have been busy this vacation and we are wondering if the college is instaHing steam heated dri\·eways for the Betas, in keeping with the steam heated sidewalks now in vogue. It also appears that someone tried to lay out a new track over the lawn on various parts of the campus. The tracks arc there at least, but it is feared the dis- tances arc not rxact.Jy true. Vle are informed that they will not be used for official practice till Schauf has sur- veyed them. * * * * * The hockey season is almost upon m, judging from the weather at 'least. We've had enough wa·rm weather now so that the rink should be in very poor shape and accordingly it must be nearly time for the hockeyers to begin to • hock. \Ve haven't been privileged yet to see our courters court, except the cub courters who courted very successfully last Saturday. Our indoor trackers arc tracking outdoors very regularly, and the grapplers are getting ready to grapple, and the fencers are making the preliminary surveys in view of an inten- sive campaign. Yes, pretty soon we wil1 be able to for- get about mid-years till the day before. By ANTTSTOPHANES conditions applying to Union bhere is reason to believe that it could be applied with more ease and with more assurance of beneficial results than at most institutions,. It does not reqt1ire a ·breakdown nor is it an admission of the inefficiency of the pres- ent system to adopt the new plan, but would be mereiy a trial for the purpose of elevating the schol~stic standards of the undergraduates. We have no apologies to make for the present system, but docs that necessatily close tl1e doors o\n possible improvements. In many ways Union is ideally suited for such an experiment; we ,have an extra~rdinaril,v composite group of students, little effort would be required to familiarize them with the new order of things. There is all'eady here less formality in class room proccdm·e than in larger sehoels and so the change would be more gentle and agreeahle, Since this sort of as~ociation is instrumental in producing the utmost m effort from the student it might be a justifiable conclu- sion that such a plan if adopted would react very favorably.

In office and laboratory, mountainous problems in management, in methods and in scientific research confront the men of the Bell Telephone System.

The freshmen gann should be a good -one, as Wittner has worked wonders with his squad, and last week tl!cy demonstrated how good they a1·e by trouncing Cathcd:ral Acadcniy fr.om Albany by the score of 46 to 14. The frosh team was handicapped by lack 0f sufficient time to practicr so it was quite a surprise to see the yearlings play rings around the Cat·he· dral five w·hich had had more exper· ience in tha-t the men had played to· gether longer. Wittner immediately went to work with his five this week and has :been working them hard to get them .primed to perfection for tlu· game tomorrow night. The few weal< spots which showed in the Academy game have been remedied consider- ably, and it is certain that the fresh· men w!ll play a smooth and fast gam\' against the Cobleskill team. Coble- skill has a good team and s hc:>uld gi vr the freshmen plenty to think about. Former Prep School Stars Feldman and Livingston proved tht mainstays of the Garnet yearling team last week, and it ·is certain that they will give a good account of them- selves tomorrow night as well. Feld- man is a former Saratoga High Schoo' star who was instrumental in beating thl: Union frosh last year when they met the Saratogians. Livingston is from Manual Training High School in Brooldyn, which is noted for its crackerjack interscholastic teams.

Four of these entertain- ments are held throughout the year and each member of the class is in- vited to one ef them. These in·vita- tions were for Friday, January 20, at the home of Mrs. Edward Ellery. Mrs. J. W. Black was hostess at the last reception. One-fottrth of the gradu- ating class is included in each list, the names being selected in alphabetical .order. In this way, the men who have become acquainted in classes· through taking the same course will be pres- ent at th.e same time. The office list is arranged with all the academic pu- pils in one gr.oup and all the engine crs in another. The entertainment committee of thr faculty is headed by Mrs. Coffin and success for tl1e functions thus far is given to her. A large number of seniors attended the last one at the home of Mrs. Black.

Everyone who travels in Egypt, who comes into contact with the most ancient of civilizations, must say something about his impres- sions to someone-.-- even if he has hitherto been a lazy correspondent. He may send only a postal card showing theGreat Pyr~ amid with «X showing the spot where I ate my luncheon.\ But he must write something! And since the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamen, tourists have multiplied, impressions have been voluminous, and the mails have increased enormously.\ Of course, you can't imagine it without being here, but I simply must tell you about ..... \ And so on. It is very lucky for the correspondents thatwi th her wonders of antiquity, Egypt did not also inherit the ancient postal sys- tem. Only the Pharaohs and the great officers of state could indulge in the luxury of conespondingwi th a foreign country- and a letter from the King of Egypt to the King of Babylon might take months in transit. Some of these i'oyalletters have come down to us. They are very long, full of elaborate salutations and important news-as if their writers con- sidered their composition the event of a season. All things considered, we may be grate- ful that themodern postal system ofEgypt is what it is-efficient, ordedy, up-to- date. Of course, the Cairo Post Office is equipped with Otis Elevators. So with the advance of civilization, Otis, the symbol of twentieth century convenience, has been put at the service of the Pharaohs of Egypt in spreading their fame far beyond any worlds which they could even have dreamed of! The pyramid builders would, we feel sure, ap- preciate the marvel. 0 TIS ELEVA T 0 R c .. Q M PAN Y Offices in all Principal Cities of the World I •

These figures may best be shown by a short table which foUows: GAltii<JS PLAYED Fn~nlty 192G-2G 192(;-27 Rest·rietion Tot.-Aw'y Tot.-Aw'y T.ot.·Aw'y Varsit,y Sports Football -------- 8 4 8 4 8 4 Baseball--------- 9 3 10 4 11 5 Basketball ------- 24 12 18 9 11 5 Outdoor track ____ 4 2 4 2 5 3 Cross Country ____ 7 2 7 4 6 3 Golf ------------ 6 3 4 2 6 3 Hockey --------- 8 4 8 4 8 4 Indoor track ______ 8 4 Lacrosse -------- 10 5 10 5 8 4 Swimming ------- 5 3 8 3 6 3 Tcm:tis ---------- 8 4 6 3 6 3 Freshman Spo1·ts- Basketball ___ ---~ 9 3 8 4 6 3 Cross-Country ____ 1 2 Football--------- 4 2 5 2 4 2 Totals --------107 51 97 46 91 46 A study of the above compilation, of which the Handbook is the source, proves that the totals for the last two sea.sons are not so much grea·ter than the new policy allows, as various complaints and protests would seem to imply. As may be noticed, the Handbook figures are not the maximum which were permi.tted but the total aggregate of contests which were listed and played under the recently supplemented code. · Without doubt, these sche~ dules were as long and complete as managerial acumen would permit and so, perhaps, should be regarded as standard. Approval of the Athletic Board is necessary to make any schedule official so that financial demands and class.room specifica- tions are considered in evolving the most logical schedule possible. The re is a discrepancy between the 1925-26 and the 1926-27 totals ·of ten games while in corn- paring the latter and the new facult,y maximum there is a second loss of six contests. The greatest part of this loss is suffered by one sport, basket- baH. Much of this is replaced, in the faculty theor- etical list, by increases in some minor and f.resh- man sports and by the addition of indoor track. ,.l'he ratio of away and home games, however, re- mains about the same as formerly. No mention is made in the faculty committee repot•t of the <'X- istence of freshman hockey even though one or two contests aTe played annually or .of soccer which is not o1ficially recognized _by the Depart- ment of Physic11.l Tmining and Athletics.

Mauger FHIDA¥, JAN'UARY 20, -!·928 WCTORY Rarely docs one .find a losing ·team very popular even in the most loyal of caHcges. Yet the Union basketball team, winning but two games out of the seven played, is highly rlauded by the undergradu- ates. One wonders whether it is just victory that the students want or just the old-fashioned, har~, clean fighting in thci1· athletic representatives. All are convinced that Union fought liard and cleanly in the two home games last week. The contest with R. P. I. tomorrow night will mean little to the undergraduates, even if Union wins, should Coach Hardman's men put up a lesser exhibition .of courage, fight, and sportsmanship. Anybody can go to bed late but it takes a man to get up next morning for an eight o'clock. ABELARDS COME TO UNION Union has been privileged this year to have within its gates at least three g1·eat prominent men of national and international fame to lecture to the student body. The lchabod SJ?encer lcc- tur~rs left many friends behind when th~y departed from Schenectady. More recently, the Joseph P. Day lecturer, Dr. W. B. Munro, left a more en- lightened group tllan what he had found before he gave his four ex:posi·tions on principles ol American government. To the me11 who are rc. sponsible fo1· the securing of sucl1 leaders to im- part their broad knowledge to the undergradu- ates, should go the gr·atitude of all scholars. In the ancient past, students went to Abelard. Today there are some men who help bring the Abelards to those who cannot afford tg go out to seek them everywhere. The pre-examination splurge is on, of course usually resulting in a more or less pc>rmancnt splurgt! afterwa,rds to forget. At least colllpulsory chapel acquaints us with many men in our class in different courses with who~ we usually donnot rub shoulders. -M. M. E. THE CUSTOMARY EXAl\I :BLURB For those of the Student Body who arc already assured a leg or an arm of the Berg cup, this editorial has no inte11est as we are only going to exhort tlH· other 8~6 .undergraduates to study for mid-years. But we must confess to our custom- ers that we haven't the ghost of an idea for an honest-to-gosh editorial on exams and, wl1ile we hate to disappoint the paying public, it will ·he necessary to tell them a story instead.

The f0llowing are some of the suggested means of re- stricting the dribble with which Coach Wheeler will experiment: 1. Limit the dribble to a single bounce or toss, of any length; 2. Limit the dribble to two ·bounces or, one toss and one bounce; 3· Divide the floor into two zones by a line pa·rallel to the end line. 1 Permit a team -to use the regular dribble in its defen- sive ar.ea, but only ·allow it to use a single bounce in the offensive area; 4· Divide the floor into three zones. Permit the dribble in the middle zone but only a singl-e bounce in the end zones. While the results of thi~ experiment may not prove practical,. they should be : , interesting to say the least. At the present time there . are many who assert the present form of dribble is llll- sa tis factory. On the contrary, those who .favor the restricted dribble see a loss in spectacular play and a far gl\\eater gain in team work. They claim the re- stricted dribble would lessen the effectiveness of stall- ing as a scoring play and a great number of fouls arising from the dribble would be ·eliminated. * * * We arc of the opinion that the recent Faculty ruling in regard to sports schedules is no ground for alarming consternation on the pal\\t of the student-body. For the past few years it has been the custom for universities and colleges in this country to place emphasis on only a few sports. Gradually it was discovered that too few were reaping the benefits derived from the spirit of com- petition and fair play which are inherent characteristics of American sports. Lately the trend has been toward offering many sports to the many, athletic activities which would embrace the individual desires and apti- t,Jdes. No doubt the Faculty saw that here at Union slightly more emphasis was being placed .on some sports to the detriment of other such activities which were Just as worthy of recognition. This move on the part of the Faculty to encourage more individual par- ticipation in athletics at Union should l>e welcomed ratl1er than condeinned by the students. We also see in the ruling a distinct boon to the intramural sports, which activities the student body cannot afford to frown upon as in the past, but rather give its whole-hearted support. And we might point out that the present trend of athletics in this country is carried to a far greater extent in Canada. All universities and colleges save one, Qtteens, have no professional coaches. Su- pervision of sports is done by alumni without remunera- tion. Intra-mural athletics are given the same support and encouragement as the Varsity sports. MOBY DICK. o'clocks.
