By abolishing the greater part of our freshman athletic program the athletic hudget will be reduced. This may well be real- located to the construction of a. new infirmary. Union has a very definite and tangible need for an infirmary. At the present time college medical attention is only procurable about two hours of the day. At other times, a personal call by the college physician or some other doctor is necessary, at an expense of from two to five dol- lars to the student. This condition is unwarrant- ·ed and should be remedied immediately. By the establishment of an infirmary such as has been suggested, e:x;pert medical care would be possible for students at all times. It would be equipped as to allow serious eases complete care under trained nurses and doctors while in the infirmary, rather than risking the possibility of the spread of a serious malady. REGULATED ACTIVITY In the Campus for November 2, we printed an editorial expressing our sentiment regarding the present po~l.tion of extra-curricular activities on this campus, We sought te prove that such activity tends to be overemphasized and unbal- anced through a lack of proper regulation. It was maintained in that earlier editorial that these faults lay both in the motive and the effect of the present organization. To reiterate briefly, the student tends to pursue an activity with the wrong end in view; in most cases mere personal glory. Thus he misses the greatest ad- vantages it can offer in the training of mind or body. As for the effect, there results an unb.ealthy piling up of numercous responsibilities and hon- ovs upon the heads of a few, while many pass through four years at Middlebury without a ~in• gle experience ·in competitive sports or a single .achievement in non-athletic activity outside his classroom routine. Even those few upon whom the. majority of extra~curricular obligations are concentrated have .often failed to .gain the proper ·education for life that college should mean. One frequ~ntly meets college graduates whose whole eonception of life values has been distorted thr<lugh just such a -college experience. Because this unbalanced condition exists, then, we feel that a system of more evenly divid- ing the opportunities of extra-curricular activities should be instituted. We offer as a possible solu- tion, a graded scale of points to be awarded for all extra-curricular .activity during the four col- lege years. The complete range of these point cre.dits would be so scaled by the director of .each activity as to :fit every position in every activity on this campu~:;, from candidate for assistant ma.nager of golf to chairman of junior week. 'i THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, MARCH 3, 1933 Pe:ep·ing Thfu the Keyhole :r My usual custom is to begin this •co'lumn or coliect·ion of damaging evide:n.ce, with lamenta- tioRs. However, as I look over my recording ap- paratus, I find .a few ,prom·ine:n.t names imd start- Hug data that must be conveyed to m.y readers, friends- or otherwise-a:n.d so I'll be about my rotten procedUre without ·further delay. Ten Cents A :pance• Ed' Minch, that .good old merry~andrew, was seen about a week ago strutting about the Nott Terrace High School' dance floor attired in a Tux, despite {he faet tha.t the admission was only a nominal fee and that a busilaess suit would have been in keeping with the spirit and nature of the dance. The Northern Institution Stages Huge Demon- stration For Royalty 'The Baron Bania was most enthusiastica.lly received at the venerable center of a·rt and culture last Friday evening. it was the Baron's first visit to ,the racing city bu:t due to the fact that he was ensnared in a CoH of fastidiousness it wil:l be necessary for him to sign the social reg- ister. In connection with this little item I shouldn't be surprised to hear of Bay HuttoR challlengi,ng- him to a duel. Bay has already charged the Baron with cleptomania-(one dear) being at sta~e. If More (Jould Only Kno,w of 'This Professor Cummings has asked each one of his economic studeRts to w:rite a paper on th~i~r idea of a Utopia.

Did You Know That The recent unexpected snow fall wUl spoil the pros:pects of those two veritable head men, 'Daddy' Gain and 'Pon' McMillen. Both had planned to take the kiddies on a basket picnic after the twelve-ten classes tomorrow. That when Professor Tidmarsh asked how many stu- dents had ever seen a mirage only two responded bY raising their hands, Professer Jones and <rother Barnett. That after the Tuesday issue of The Concordy, Red Ackley was greeted as the Happy Warrior, as he sauntered up the middle aisle of chapel on Wednesday morning. That Jimmie Keegan, the Phi Delt, was the recipient of thirteen diamonds during a recent bridge g-ame. That a cowboy came into town a few weeks ago and ·asked Mr. Burdick to come out to his ranch and look over what he thought to be a ~ross between a deer and a cow. That is the popular report on the campus that Professor Mavor is Gracie .Allen's lost brother. R. P. I. May Not Triumph On the Court-But in Love They Are Superb Rod Clarke has encountered difficulty in re- gard to his love affair with a certain Watervliet maiden. A junior at the Troy institution has caused him the loss of the enchanted gaze, when 1 Beauty smiled on him. It is rumored that Rod ~ . sits each night on the banks of the lonely Mo- hawk pondering over the time he has lost in wooing, in watching and in chasing the light that was once found in the woman's eyes. May I propose that kisses no doubt will .always be in style but from now on Roddie, why not take them for what they shou::td be. It is dawn and I see tnat the chimneys are already smoking so I think I'll catch a :flew winks before my eight o'cloclt. -Tee Pee. Parallelling the point system ased for sem- ester hours in courses, the activities credits would be requi.red for graduation by the adminis- tration. That is, a definite number of points, somewhere between a set minimum and a se{ maximum, would have to be acquired ·before a degree .is conferred. Obviously, this minimum and maximum fea- ture is the essential part of the system. We hold that the requirement of each would tend to adjust the other. Since the superior few would be forc- ed to direct their efforts in but one or two activi- ties, there would be left a greater opportunity for .competition by others. This limitation of ac_, tivity would further tend to a more efficient functioning in each activity. That greatest of benefits accompanying ex .. tra-cm:rioular activity, competitive stimulation, would in no way be abated by our maximum re- quirement. A greater number of positions are left open, and more are the competitors. Perhaps the highest advantage of this pro- posal lies in .its effect on those who would other- wise miss the fundamental opportunities wbich all extra-C!Urricular act-ivity during the four col- that such effort is not an ·essential part of col- lege. · · \! --Middlebury Campus. Coal ... silk stockings ... meat -and tlte telephone ' Keenly aware of the problems of business, large and small, Bell System commercial men are con- stantly devising specia:I telephone plans to custom- fit service to the user's needs. For example,. a plan they worked out for a coal distributor helped him to contact 50% more dealers. A manufacturer, using a telephone selling plan, sold 700 dozen pairs of hC)siery through one Long Distance call. A great meat packer handles compie~ sales and distribution problems efficiently with the aid of planned Long Dista,nce and private wire services. Systematic telephone plans are helping many u-sets to build business- cut costs- handle collec- tions - unify nationwide organizations - increase profits.

.·, 1 Four fi'VE EN:DS SEASON ON R. ·P. t COURT, Swimmers Win.d Up Season,: Here Against Cornell; Frosh Five at R. P. I. The basketball team wHl con• clude a mediocre season: when they : meet their inveterate enemies, R. : P. I., at Troy tomorrow night, and!; the yearlings wm complete their . season when they encounter the . ' R. P. I. frosh in a preliminary · . game. The swimming team wi11 , also wind u;p its seas_on totnoril'oW' when it meets the Cornell natators in the F0ote pool'. The fact that Union defeated the Engineers, 64-11, is no indication that the. Trojans are not going to j put up a stiff fight. Although the ~ Trojans have met with hut Uttl'e: success on the court this season, i they defeated Stevens Tech by a 1 score of 25-21. According to com-! parative scores they stand a good i chance of trouncing Union, because: the Garnet five lost to Stevens ! Tech, 29-21. Union is expected to i win by a slight margin, however. Same Lineup The Une-ap will 90nsist of the : men who have performed so well' in former games. On this conibi-; nation J\ ackson and DiH will fill the' fo'l.'ward berths; Ackley, center, and: Captain Murray and Dow, guards. i Captain Murray, Dill, Ackley, Hig- i gins, and Single will be playing their last game for Union, and ·it: is expected Coach Hardman will ; give them all a break. · The yearlings, who have won three out of five games, will have • to play a better brand of ball if ' they expect to ring up a victory.' The probable lineup is as follows: Brandow and Ouderkirk will play • forward positions; Waldron, cen- ter, and Milano and Di t..ano, , guards. Swimmers Meet Cornell In the swimming meet Unien · will be represented by the same group of men entered in former: meets. Union is stronger in most of the events, but will probably: lose the backstroke and the 440-: yard swim in which Captain Rob-i erts of Cornell excels, and the ' breaststroke, in which Goldberger: easily outdistanced the Union swimmers here last year.

Wohl THE BLOCK \U\ DINNER The annual Block \U\ dinne:rs can be num- bered among the few colleg-e functions that really afford the Student Body an opportunity to get together in a social capacity. It is unfor- tunate that there are not more OCJcasions to meet · as a ·whoie; but since there are not, every stu~ dent should take adv,antage of tlie sixth annual Block \U\ dinner a:;; a means to become better acquainted with his fellow students. The d).nner has never been an expensive one, and this year the cost has been reduced to one dollar. Some of the fraternities are closing their dining rooms on the night of March 20 and re- funding the cost of the meal. A ticket for the dinner can be purchased 'by addi:Elg approximate- ly a half dollar to this rebate, In the past, an outstanding 1lg11re in intercol- legiate athletic circles always has been the prin- cipal speaker. The announcernen.t that Ap.dy Kerr, the head coach of the un!lefeate!). Colgate university football team, will b·e tbe speaker 'of the evening indicates 'that tl;tis year will be no exception. Mr. Kerr represellts an· athletic policy that is entirely unlike ou.r own, and· what he has to say should be of the g-reatest interest. The fundamental reason .for having the Block \U\ dinner is to honor our athletes. T-his oc<iasion is the only time that we ca.n honor them collectively. The least we can' do is to devote one evening to the men who giv·e such a large part of their time to our enjoyment and their Alma Mater. G-. R. c., JR.

' · Tbe· A,cifte Barber Shop : My dear reader-If this column is deficient in length, buffonery, or how many have we, it is because o:f' the world-old story that he1 known around the sundry synods as the reund~faced monk, was caught with his hands down, and has played upon his friend's good nature to get a. col- umn prepared in the lib.eral space of some fifteen minutes. The round-visaged fellow h:as always played the part of an old wag,. however, 'SO you must forgive him-and your ·~corrie.\ {Isn't that cute? It's a new word for correpondent}.

A large number ef viewpoints have been ex- pressed, and. for the first time will be made known to the Student Body and faculty. Mr. Duane Crichton, the Rochester \punctilio who is smarter .than three Philadelphia lawyers, 'stat- ed, when interviewed, that he was a little :bit light on the matter, and was I intending te escort him to the cinema this afternoon. Mr. .ifohn Dearstyhe, while lodging in his .study, in back of one of those bulldog P. K~s., mentioned that there were decided advantages in the present condi- tion~:~, as he did not have to pay any of his bills. Mr. Dearstyne ls a senior and comes from Al- bany, New York. Gloomy Gus Barnett predicts· that \existing tFoubles and realities will take up- on themselves a metaphysical impalpability, sink- ing to mere cerebral phenomena for quiet con- templation, ;and no longer stand~ng as pressing concretions which chafe ene's body and .soul.\ Gus prepared for Union at the North Hoboken Memorial High for Deaf and Dumb, and has been that way eV'er since he got here. Ashmore Mitchell's theory was exactly the. antithesis of Mr. Barnett's when asked for his opinion, :stating he was quite certain that \Red\ Ackley: would not play: second base this year. Others .to be in~ terviewed were Emmuel P. Schoonmugle, of the Alpha Del·ta Phi house, who tittered like a little girl whe:n asked to express his sentiments.. He feels quite sure that President Roosevelt will straighten everything out \because he's a good guy.\ (A very scintillating deduction on the part of Mr. Sclloonmugle). Mr. John Bonnell as- sured me that the situation was so much broko- lie, and also expressed his desire for a motion picture. * * * * The glee club had a most successful trip to New York last week-end, and I wish to thank the New York Alumni for their courtesy. Of the younger alumni, Larry Swart, Dick Draper, Jim Allen, Dave Smith, Hank ~othmann and Jack Weeks wished to be remembered to friends oid . and new.

IrS MORE FUN TO how There is also a trick of cigarette adver· tising, whereby a few magic W()rds are used to create the illusion of \Coolness.\ EXPLANATION: Coolness is determiaed by the speed of burning. Fresh cigarettes, retaining their full moisture, burn more slowly .•. smoke cooler. Parched, dry ciga- rettes burn fast. They taste hot. This makes the method of wrapping very important. Improperly wrapped cigarettes begin to dry out as soon as packed. Camels are cooler because they come in the famous Humidor Pack of welded, three-ply, MOISTURE-PROOF cello· phane .•• and because they contain better tobaccos. A cigarette that is fresh, full of natural moisture, and blended from choice, ripe tobaccos tastes cooler than one that is harsh and acrid .. For coolness, choose a fresh cigarette, made from costlier tobaccos • ._.._ It is a fact, well known by ~ leaf tobacco experts, that Camels are made from finer, MORE EXPENSIVE tobaccos than any other popular brand. Try Camels ..• give your taste a chance to sense the di1ference. You'll appreci· ate it! •• NO TRICKS Jl7ST COSTLIER TOBACCOS IN A MATCHLESS BLEND

Carroll Addresses Initiates \You are aware, of course, that, according to statistics, tlJ.e very fact of our meeting here tonight has placed the odds for success in our favor,\ said Mr. Carroll in his speech. \But. you also know that those percentages have themselves sharply defined success as a com~ pletely worldly concern. Among the members of our society are some of America's most illustrious ·figures. Mr. Roosevelt is frequent~ ly pictured wearing our emblem. The roster of the senators of our society is an inspiration to the least of us. But among the mem- bers of Phi Beta Kappa are also narrow pedants, stupid egoists, ambitious imposters, and conceit~ ed weaklings. These are incl!l.ded to swell the statistical average in our favor.\ The men who wer~ inducted in- to the society are Donald Nitch- man, Thomas Wade, William Pal~ mer, Sed·gie Griffith, John Lyons, James King, Abraham Levine, AI~ len Bernstein, Julius Emspak, Lewis Horwitz, Peter Kapsalis, and Abraham Schhipelsky.

Bennett, Associate Professor of Economics, in daily assembly Wed- nesday morning. He suggested three basic changes which would help to bring banking up on a level with modern industrialism, and thus relieve the present crisis. Professor Bennett began by giv~ ing an illustration of the underly~ ing cause of the existing financial situation. \Henry Jones, hearing rumors of instability and shortage of cash, decides to hold back his usual deposits, at the same time continuing to make the necessary withdrawals to meet his payroll,\ he said. \Thus a million Henry Joneses oreate a credit collapse, since the banks are not prepared to meet such heavy drains on their cash reserves. \The reform which we may hope for in the near future will consist of three major points: First, a .national system of banking which would eliminate all state banks; second, an adequate branch bank system, taking the place of the approximately 22,000 independent banks now operating in the conn~ try; and thirdly, a central plan for regulation and supervision of all banking functions.\

Olson A Greenberg · TWO SETS OF FRESHMAN RULES The hair cut administered by the Sophomore Disciplinary C<Jtnrnittee yesterday was a great shock. For the past year or two the Student Body has paid. liltle attention to whether or not the freshmen have obeyed their rules. Then out of a clear sky a tnember of the class of 1936 has his hair cut. It is not our purpose to defend the reeipient of this disciplinary measure. He literally \tried his best\ to get wbat he did. Nor is it our pur- pose to attack or defend the freshman rules, The difficulty at pr-esent, is that we have two Sf!ltS of regulations: one for those who are members of fraternities; and another for the group that has no fraternity connections <Jr influence with the powers that be. There is a large number of freshmen who walk about the campus and the city witJ:i.out their hats, smoking when and where they please, Most of these first year men are members of the more powerful fraternities. Perhaps the Disciplinary Committee has not noticed them. If they do not dare do any more than warn them by sp~aking on the side to some upperclassman who is a member of the same fraternity as the offender. The freshman who had his hair cut yesterday is not a member of a fraternity that has a repre- sentative on the Sophomore Disciplinary CC'Jmmit- tee . .As far as we know his only interest in Union College is going to classes. It is not surpl'ising that the Sophomore Disciplinary Committee should choose a type such .as .he to puniSh. In 1931 a crippled member of the class of 1:934 had his hair cut to preserve the dignity of the sopho- more class. This year the culprit was just re- covering from a .severe attack of ptomaine pois- ·Oning. If we are to have freshman rules, they should be the same . for everyone. They should be en- forced by a c<lmpetent Sophomore Disciplinary Committee. Why not give half of the class of 1936 hair cuts'? Probably at least< that number has broken the regulations many times, but have had the good sense to keep quiet about it. We still have freshman rules, and u~tll they are revised or abolished, they snould be enforced. The sophomore committee has shown by its ac- tion yesterday that it is unable to .b.andle the .situation. G. R. C., JR.

STUDENT COUNCIL METHOD OF NiOMINATIONS Is the metho.d employed by the Student Coun- cil in .nominati:rug men .for membership into its body adequate amd conducive to the best repre- sentation on the council? This is the question that arose yesterday in Student Body meeting. There is a celi'tain group, composed chiefly of ·neutrals, who fe!()l that it is not receiving the proper amount ()f representation oh our govern- ing tribunal. The manner by- which this senti- ment was expressed yesterday is anything .but appropriate. Aft.er fruitlessly attempting to gain representation byr the formation of a new Inter- fraternity Council, this group is now retaliating with the same· ob;jective. The present method of nominations employed by the Student C<>uncil is the best that has ever - been used hel'e. With the institution of the Stu· dent Council last year, it was realized that the major problem facing it was the. selection of some nominating methCDd which would decrease, if not eliminate the pos;stb;lity of deals. With this in mind, the present system was inaugurated. Under the existing system, nominations are announced by· the Student CiounMl on the day of election, making. the for~a.Uqn of deals almost impossibl~, . due to the short t.ime between the announcemeiit of; the, nominations·. and the actual voting •. .Aiiy meth6d: o:f nominati'ons which provides for open nominations reverts Ulll .to. th~ fo:vmev · cond:ition, which w.as found t~ be · entixeiy 'On·· repre~entative. This .Uien places the re~poli~,ibll- ' · ity upon the outgoing ;.st~<l~nt Council,, in the prep,..ration of their nont~nations. It the St~J,d,ent · Coui:tcil is unable tQ justly ex:- erdse this respom:libilit~, b.etter that it be ab.ol- ·· ished.

Tb:e first type is the man who continually asks very irrelevant questions throughout the class period, merely to att.emr.\: to show the instructor that he has a great deal of interest in that particular course. Not being content with annoy-ing the rest .of the class this much, he waits until th.e last minute. and tq~n begins on some long and uninteresting discourse on his method of solving all the probleJDs that have confronted students in that course for years, and wili continue to face them long after he is forgotten. I suppose that some men musf 1 ''pc:5lish a,PPlliW\ .. but I W·ish that they would find some less annoying method. . The second nomination is the man who finds it impossible to keep quiet during the chapel service. If the speaker does not interest him. he makes it a point to cause as much disturbance as p.ossible in order to draw attention f;rom the speaker to himself. Tbis type of behavior might be overlooked in a high school assembly but ·it does seem no more than right that when men reach college they should begin to grow up. If these men are not ·interested in what is taking place they should at least have the courtesy t~ keep quiet and show a little respect for the. speaker, or if not for him, then for the men sit- ting near them. If this is too much to ask, :r;: might suggest that these men stay away from chapel and give the rest of us a chance. These nominations stated above were f()r· warded to me by some of my readers, if anyone else has any more suggestions I would appreciate them and shall attempt to use them, M. ·(t. that the Student Council has . .already accomplished, or failed to accomplish.

EXPLANATION: All cigarette manu- facturers use heat treatment. It is a routine process of manufactare. The first Camel cigarette ever made was manufactured under the heat-treating process. Every one of the billions of Camels produced since has received the necessary heat treatment. Harsh, raw tobaccos require inten• sive processing under high tempera• tures. The more expensive tobaccos, which are naturally mild, call for only a moderate application of heat. Heat treatment never can make cheap, in• ferior tobacco good. ·~ It is a fact, well known by :rw-r leaf tobacco experts, that Camels a.re made f.rom finer, MORE EXPENSIVE tobaccos than any other popular brand.

News Editor ------------D. B. Moulton Sports Editor ____________________ J, Woolman ' THE NEW HOME FOR STUDENT PUBLICATIONS With this issue of The Concordiensis we say \farewell\ to the old system of desultory journal- ism at Union College and we \hail\ the increased opportunities that the new home for the student publications will provide for directing our efforts to tl:le greater glory of Old Union. Although the new equipment has not yet arrived in the new home of the student publica- tions in Silliman Hall, we know from the plans approved by Dean Garis, president of the Publica- tions Boatd, that Union College will have a publications office that will be second to none for its facilities for efficiently editing an accur- ate newspaper. The new office has 504 square feet of floor space well lighted ·by six large windows during the day, and by special non-glare lamps by night. .Adequate Elesk space is prev·ided for the editors of The Concordiensis, The Garnet, The Hand- book, and The Idol. The reporters have a .battery of steel desks specially arranged to hold type- writers at convenient height, and special type- writer chairs. The sub-editors will read the news- matter at a special \copy table\ presided over by the issue editor. Filing cabinets are provided for the first time for the Garnet and the other publications' cuts, and for filing matter relating to the various departments and extra-curricular activities of the college. This newspaper \mor- gue\ will help toward more accurate journal- ism because it will provide easy access to the history of the subjects concerned in the news. In addition to these facilities, the new office has provided an ideal manner for keeping on file copies of other college publications, as well as an expanding file of our own back numbers. It is only by reading other college newspapers that we can arrive at some measuring device with which to evaluate our own campus affairs. The mailing of the publications will take place in the basement of .Silliman Hall where it will be mo.re convenient for the business staffs to do this kind of work. Specinal lighting facil- ities and other equipment have been installed for this purpose. REORGANIZING OF STAFF With all this equipment it will be possible to have regular office hours for The Concord1en- sis staff during the day and early evening, do• ing away with the dusk-to-dawn shifts that ob- tained in the old office in Washburn Hall. Be- ;ginning next week the entire staff of The Con- cor~iensis will be in the office on Monday, Wed- nesday and Thursday afternoons from 2 to 5 o'clock, and 'Sunday, Monday, Wednesday and Thursday nights from 8 to 10 o'clock. Experi- ' ence may, however, necessitate a change in these hours. A complete reorganization of the method of editing The Concordiensis will be .gradually taken place during the rest of the college yeari for with these new mechanical facilities we may THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, MARCH 17, l933 I I ,I .

On this oc- casion, You. and You wiJ:l .escape my opprobrious paragraphs. THE 'TEST The dances tonight and tomorrow n:ight are the first to he held under -the new rules of the Student Council. These rules have 'been pUblish- ed in The ·Concordiensis a:nd as was e:81pected, sub- jected to much discussion ·on and about the cam- pus. I'm sure that the Student Cbuncil :tropes that these •FU·le01 are familiar te all of the students by this hour-just about four more hours and they go into effect.

The real test takes place this · week-end and we shall be able to ascertain just how the students regard them, whether or not t]:rey wiH enter into the spirit and to find out if after all the rules are really worth the effort ·spent upon their construction. You and You have a chance to do away with the \policemen\ wllo come to visit each dance, if they live up to the laws creat- ed by the men whom they have elected to the Student Council. -Tee Bee WHY YOU 1 RE GOING TO 'THE BLOCI{ U DINNER The Bl1>ck U Dinner is significant to the life of Union College. This is clea:tly shown in some of the reasons that every undergraduate who can possibly attend will not miss this annual event next Monday n-ight. Why go to the Block U Dinner? 1. Because it is the only time when all the stud.ents and faculty of Union College may gather to break bread together at the same place. 2. Because about 180 students, or almost a quarter of the Student Body will be rewarded for representing Union College with distinction on the athletic field. 3. Because the students who wil'l receive the athletic insignia not only entertained us but also because they were responsible for maintaining and increasing the goodwill toward Union Col- lege: this benefits aU of us who are student~> here. 4. Because a first rate authority on football, Andy Kerr; coach of the. brilliantly successful football team at Colgate, will deliver an authori- tative and interesting address on some phase of football . .As a natton of athletes, we are interest- ed in the most popular sport and should have some intelligent idea about it. 5. Because George H. Daley, sports editor of the New York Herald Tribune, quarterback of the Union football team in 1902, and always an active staunch supporter of Old Union, and founder of the Block U dinners, will he toast- master. 6. Because we must eat, and for one dollar we will all have a corking good meal, entertain- :m~nt, and a good time . 7. And hecause no matter how hard hit we have been by the depression we cannot afford to forego such an event which helps to cement our interests ·in each other which is essential if \we are .to get anything out of colleg:e.\ very well put out a more attractive and perhaps more technically perfect newspaper, but we real~ ize how g·reat is our responsibility to conduct a college newspaper that will earn and maintain for itself the reputatien of being a source of accurate and significant information, interest'\ ingly presented, We hope that the best type of student jour- nalist will no longer hesitate to apply :for a. place on the staffs of the publications, for no matter the type of organization, good men are needed to make a good newspaper; Henceforth the entire board of senior edi- tors wiil take active part in managing the paper, assisted by a junior board of editors and a sopho- more board of reporters. The sopl10more report- ers will be chosen principally from those fresh- men who successfully complete the special course in journalism conducted by Mr. :Milton :M. E:n- zer, director of the college news bureau. By do- ing away with freshman reporting, it is hoped that a great source of inaccuracies will also dis- appear. SAVING FOR A RAINY DAY It will probably cost approxiamtely $1;000 to complete the plans for the new publications office. All this money comes from the surplus built up by the publications during the \fat years\ under the direction of Dean Charles F. ;tl'. Garis, president of .the Publication Bo.arcl., and \daddy\ to student publications. We are grateful for his long view and his wise planning, for without it we would no.t have been able to own such a fi.ne plant for publishing our jo11rnals. With thls plan- ning, perhaps we will also have a Union College Ptess someday, when we will not only edit but also print our own publications. i I' 't '' '. I ' ' ;~·.' II ~.· . ' ' l : I ;: !

The Rt. Rev. Mr. Irving P. Johnson, Episcopal Bishop of Colo- rado, a member of the class of 1887 and of the same fraternity as Mr. Gowenlock, will deliver the prin- cipal address at the services. Mr. Gowenlock was president of the class of 1875 and although he lived hi India and England from the time of his graduation he re• turned to al1 his class reunions every five years until 1925 when he received the honorary degree of master of arts from his .Alma· Mater. He died in England last December. In his will he left 2,000 English pounds sterling to the college, 500 pounds to his frater- nity chapter, and the remaining 7,500 pounds he distributed among his ten living classmates and three widows of other classmates.

B. courses have been requested to make a careful study of the new .schedule for the sophomore curriaulutn an- nounced today by Dean Charles F. F. Garis who believes tha.t such a study will pre:pare them to make a more intelligent choice of their elec- tives after .the Spring vacation. Dean Garis stressed the point that courses should be elected with a view to the major work they expect to do in their junior and senior year. In his announcement Dean Garis also declared that Mathematics 13 will not be given next year and that Mathematics 12 will b.e a year's course in ca.1culus. D~;ian Edward Ellery will give .a new course in chemistry for the arts students who are anxious to know the relation of chemistry to the civilization of the world; to the life about them, to the various in- dustries to the different sciences. This course will be a lectul'e course without' laboratory work and will deal with modern chemistry as if it were one of the \humanities.\ The new course is called Chemistry 1. The schedule announced by Dean Garis follows: Five courses are required. As a student may maj()r only in a department in which he has had an introductory course in either his freshman or sophomore year, it is desirable therefore to elect the prS-'requisite of any major that one is at all likely to select.

In conclusion Mr. Kerr urged' the students not to take the out- come of any game too seriously .. He stated that the margin of vic- tory or defeat Is often so slim, as in the case of a 7 to 6 football score, that it is not worthwhile to place too mu~h faith in its result. 11:20-12:10; lab., M., T., or Th., 1:30-3:30.

Daley contributed much to the program and is deserving of our highest respect for his efforts of six years ago in establishing this institution at Union College. Druley was able to make the first dinner an overwh.elming success by his ability to engage Knute Rockne as guest speaker. Rockne was a very close friend of Mr. Daley's, and made the entire trip from South Bend to Schenectady for the sole purpose of being at the dinner, and left immediately afterwards to return to Notre Dame. Daley received a letter from Rockne soon after the dinner which contained the fifty dollars which had been paid him as a small portion of his expenses, and also a note which read to this effect: \Take this and buy some footballs for the boys at Union.\ .rust as Rockne loved the youth of .Al:nerica, so does George Daley love Unlon College. After the first dinner, a deficit of nearly one hundred dollars was covered by Daley. Even greater than his material efforts to make the first dinner a success, has been his un- 'lroken interest in Union College students, as shown to soJ.?1e degree by his speech last night. Seniors will .soon be graduated from Union. These men will go out into the world with varied con- ceptions of life. Will these men make a \racket\ of life, as Mr. Daley put it, or will they take an active and sincere interest in life, ever striving to improve the world around them? We leave here with a fair knowledge of the art13, the sciences, and the humanities. There is another side which cannot be developed by teach- ing, however. This is the personal side of one's existence, which contributes the greater portion of our relation to society, as set up by our fellow- men. wm we be willing to sacrifice a portion of our life, foi\getting the persona;! gain, in an at.., tempt to do something for the other fellow? When we do ta:ke upon ourselves this re- sponsibility, more men of the calibre of George Daley will grace. the list of Union College alumni. PUTTING OUR BEST FOOT FORWARD In spite of the inclement weather, the calen- dar tells us that today is the first day of spring, the season when all good housekeepers busy themselves putting their houses in or(ler. We of Union College might very wen take a leaf from the book of. the wise housewife and try to make our campus more presentable d'Uring the next three months when the college will be entertain- ing numerous visitors including scores of pro- specti:ve freshmen. We all realize the necessity APf looking our best when these future freshm,en .·,,first see our campus, since we know full well how · great an impression the first glitnpse can ma.lte. This spring the college is faced with the neces- sity of making the campus. appear as beautiful \ · campus who gather in the .Ad Building on alter- ' 1 nate Wednesdays might evolve some system whereby each house could J.imi·t the nUmber of band leaders at a dance. * * * : 1 A few weeks ago w-e were so optimistic as to , , announce proudly that the war was over and· that · i a tr.uce had ;been declared between ·the ·partisans of the• student goverament and the op.ponents. Well; vve were wrong as our colleague and co- columnist, Herman, was pleased to point out .. The lull of hostilities which we mistook !!or an arm- istice was only due to the marshalling ~f both forces. Of course, Herman, no war has been of- ficially declared and this disagreement is prob- ably one of 1ih0se Sino-Japanese understandings. Far be It from us to take sides in this battle. A Concordy columnist has enough enemies without deHberately seeking more, but our student body , meetings al'e going to he· lively sessions from now I on or .else Toby is wrong again. There's no bet- 1' ter way to begin a weary week than by .enjoying a 'little verbal scuffle on Monday morning at 10 a. m. * * * In :r:egard to the committee appointed by Ex- ecutive Mitchell to study the present methed of , nominating the Student councilmen, we hear :' that an effort will be made to adapt the Hare system of proportional representation to our campus elections. Always pl'ovid.jng of course, ' that the P~ S. majors on the committee can ex- plain the system to the satisfaction of the non- P. S. men on the committee. It seems to be a case of first find your Hare! * *' * And just to show that we aren't forgetting our promise to that Titian-hai,redfriend at Northamp- ton, this little reminder is addressed to her and the other inmates of Baldwin House. Even though last week-end .did mess things up a bit, we stm can explain everything-we hope. * ~ * Unfortunately those delightful little personals must be omitted from this issue, but let the campus cut-ups beware. There will be oth.er col- umns to follow. TOBY. as ever w-ith the added handicap of a curta~led budget. But a little carefulness on the part of the students would do a great deal to lighten the task of nhe grounds committee. First of an the students might exercise more care in walking about the campus. The paths at present are none too inviting, but the practice of cutting- across the lawns has proven to be ruin- ous to the turf. A few seconds spent in going around hy way of the paths will be a service that the students may easily render to the college and there will be less work for the grounds commit- tee later in the year. Secondly the college's appearance would be tremendously improved if the undergraduates would take pains not to strew papers and other refuse about the campus. No matter how hard the grounds committee may strive, their efforts will be futi.Je if the students refllse to do their share in refraining from littering up the grounds with scl'aps of waste paper. But the greatest improvement that can be made ·is an improvement in the behavior of the undergraduates during chapel services. Visitors cannot help being un.favorably impressed by the lack of courtesy which Union men exhibit during the daily assemblies. Speakers are given very shabby .treatment and the silence which any speaker .expects is often lacking. When markers are not pvesent, whole sections of the student body rise and fUe out, even though the speaker may have already begun his address. The un- dergraduates sitting in the first row of the bal~ cony drape their coats over the railing and the aesthetic effect is anytlting but impressive. We all know how well ·the visitors will be only too ready to notice such lapses of courtesy on the part of .the undergraduates and ·the reputation of the .eollege as a whole will suffer. This season is one time when the. college can ill afford to have its enviable reputation attacked by such accusa-tions. Within the next few weeks scores of prospective freshmen· and their pareQ.ts 'Will be visiting our campus. Let us all work to- gether and try .to present the visitors with a fa- vorable ir;ripression (jf Union College. The 'lapses of courtesy and our untidy habits are merely the result of carelessness on our part. Let us put our best foot forward and try to make our campus a.nd our daily .assemblies as attractive to visitors as possible.

Following the Hobart encounter, only one deba,te will remain on the , Union scherule. On the following Tuesday, Ap'l.'il 18, Williams col- lege will send a team to Schenec- tady for a radio debate on a topic which has ,not yet been announced. PI DELTA EPSILON CONFERENCE William Eldred, Donald Walker, .John English, Thomas Wade, Gor- don Bell and .Joseph Saidel were chosen to represent '\ the Union chapter of Pi Delta Epsilon, na- tional honorary joumalistic fra- ternity, at the Eastern District Conference to be held at Penn State university at State College, Pa., April 7 and 8. In addition to the Union delegation there will be about fifteen other colleges and universities represented at the conference. ILLUSION: Daley Interviewed (Continued from page 1) per-iod when. a losing team uses this style of offense as a last re- sort, and a markedly inferior team may very conceivably win the game, something which I consider ext:vemely unfair. \The more stringent rules about use of the hands are much in fa- vor with most eastern coaches, and in this Mr. Kerr should be backed up. The misuse of the hands was brought about by high school' coaches who worked on the wmng theory that rabbit punches and other low forms of body contact were necessary. College coaches always have to break this habit. It wa.s this same sort of acti~m, a steady stream of short rabbit punches on the head and neck which caused the death of the heavyweight boxer, Ernest Schaaf. Clipping .. Andy's ideas in regard to clip- ping, allowing more of it under the discrimination of the official, are just the opposite of mine; I think that clipping is not punished enough.

Head, hands and feet protrude, and are held by specta- tors while the magician takes a crosscut saw and, with the help of an assistant, saws through the center of the box: and apparently through the wo- man. It's fun to be fooled • • EXPLANATION: There are many eJCplanations for this illusion. One method of performing this illusion requires the presence of tVJo girls in the box. One girl curls up in the left half of the boJC with her head and hands protruding, giving the effect you see illustrated above. The other girl is doubled up in the right half of the box, with only her feet showing. Nobody is sawed in half. NO TRICKS JUST COSTLIER TOBACCOS IN A MATCHLESS BLEND . ' ... 1ts more fun to KNOW Cigarette advertising, too, has its tricks. Consider the illusion that \Flavor\ can be achieved by some kind of magical hocus- pocus in manufacturing. EXPLANATION: Just three factors control the fhivor of a cigarette. The addition of arti· ficial flavoring. The blending of various to- baccos. And the quality of the tobaccos them· selves. Quality is by far the most important. Domestic cigarette tobaccos vary in price from 5¢ a pound up to 40¢ a pound. Imported tobaccos vary from 50¢ a pound to $1.15. No wonder, then, that cigarettes differ in taste-since distinctive, pleasing flavor de- pends so largely upon the blending of the cost- lier tobaccos, r.- It is a fact, well known by leaf tobacco experts, that Camels are made from finer, MOitE EXPENSIVE tobaccos than any other popular brand. Try Camels. Give your taste a chance to sense the subtle difference that lies in costlier to· baccos ... a difference that means all the world in smoking pleasure ... in pure, un- alloyed satisfaction. VOL.

Teaching Discussed By Howard Pillsbury Superintendent of Schenectady Schools Explains the New Standards of the Profession \The teaching profession has ac- quired a new standard during the past century,\ declared Mr. How- ard Pillsbury, superinten'dent of public Schools in Schenectady, in . a short address at the daily as- sembly on Wednesday. Mr. Fills- bury pointed out how that profes- sion has advanced with the civil- ization of our country over a peri- od of a hundred years. Mr. Pillsbury had a high nation- al distinction conferred upon him when he was appointed as, a mem- ber of the joint committee on the emergency in ~ducation, accord- ing to announcement made in Washington early this week. The purpose of the commission is to secure advice and support of offi- cials of important ~d:tJ9ational agencies in the country. Mr. Pillsbury stressed the fact that one must not expect to achieve either fame or wealth in the teaching profession. Research workers and administrators may acquire these standards of success, but they are absent from the lives of teachers in a large majority of cases. There are, however, several notable assets in this profession. Chief among these are the con- tacts made with young people which enables educators to keep young and alive to the trends of the world.

Painter Sophomore Board M. Berger R. Diamond D. Moulton C. Groesbeck C. Hathaway J. Woolman Issue Editor Arnold J. Friedman COLLEGIATE JOURNALISM Student publications have long been the sub- ject for denouncements by daily press editorial writers, undergraduates, and faculty members. The removal of Reed Harris from the editorship of the Columbia Spectator was given the most space in daily papers of any college story for the year. His position enabled him to make a speak- ing tour throughout the .country, as a result of the nation-wide publicity which had been ac- corded him. Following the removal of Harris, there was published the Columbia University Report on the Spectator. This attacked the sensationalism and editorial invective of college newspapers, and suggested that sensationalism and bluntness of attack be avoided in college publications. Can this· not be applied more accurately and justly to· many .gf our daily paJ>ers? It has been said that not more than half of the newspapers are true in their content of subject matter. Word comes to us that the entire senior board Of the Williams Qttattetty has resigned, upon the request of Assistant Dean Leonard. The cause for this practical dismissal was a story appear- ing in its last issue which allegedly was not writ- ten by an, undergraduate. The article which was accepted by an instructor in Rhetoric is a piece of dialogue between two Williams men in a New York speakeasy and contains such words as God, Jesus, gin, damn, rye, lousy, blond, horticulture and pansy. Are such removals warranted? It was not a matter of invective or sensationalism that Reed Harris was discharged from his position. It was because he had failed to realize his position as the .supervisor of an expression of mass under- graduate opinion. When an editor loses his re- gard for this responsibility and injects into a paper any opinion which is not representative of the majority of the student body, he not only jeopardizes his paper, but himself as well. College editors are apt to represent personal opinions in their editorial columns, which may or may not represent the .opinions of their read- ers. Alert editors usually find that the opinions of their reading clientele are synonymous with their own personal opinions. .An undergraduate publication should act as the organ for student ·expression, not a means for the acquirement of individual ends. It is the one means whereby new ideas can .be introduced in a clear and concise manner, so as to present the relative points of view of the question, 'With- out bia.s Today, which is really Thursday and not Ftii'- day at a:ll, as we wha would write eO'lumns rrwst be prepared to submit our superficial endeavoxs at least a day .before publication breaks forth, and who must p·rognestieate (better look it up belore committing yourself) the mono:w's ev:ents:. and who, my playf:u.l ph1mp pats,. are damned fools for being columnists a:t a:H,. as there is not:h~ ing, absolutely nothing, so exasperating as te gEt mi'leed up in a sentence like this a.nd not be able to finish it without returning to the initi~l thought which Was merely a five-wo.rd stateme11t concerning the weather, and col:lld really be done away with entirely if it were not for the string;.. · .. ···1 encies of newspaper .etiquette, aH of' which makes . it n.ecessary for me to return te the ;subdect mat'- ter which begins with the fi·rst word ·of this· in- volved paragraph, and merely states that \today- is a very nice day\ for a change.

I don't believe many of •liS realize how much Mr. Achi),les, in collabor- ation with the headmasters of many of the .fore- most preparatory schole; in the east, is doing to build up Union with the finest grade of incoming men that can possibly be admitted. Recently h:e has visited such schools as Taft, Hotchkiss, Kent, Manlius, and several others, and h.as arranged it so that representatives of these· .schools can visit Union during their holidays and become ac• quainted with college fraternities and various· ac- tivities. It is a noble project and 'Well worth the students' cognizance, that they m~y not only as\ sist in entertaining such visitors, but also might take it upon themselves to invite fr.iends of theier own from other preparatory schools, whom they think might be of value to a strong- nucleus for ensuing freshmen years. • There is very little going on about the sundry pa.rts ef the campus as there is a sort of cooling off after last week-end.-Everyone seems rathe·r cheerful that \the great wheels of inert industry are beginning to whirl again,\ and many are al- ready anticipating their first legitimate glass of beer on .April seventh, although perhaps not se early in this state.-Professor Fernand Jag1.1 leaped to the rescue this morning conducting a Spanish class in Mr. Gomez~Duran's· absence.

SOPHOMORE GYMNASIUM The action of the faculty last night in abolish- ing compulsory sophomore gymnasium is a com- mendable one, and in keeping with .the policy of. the administration. The policy of the adminis- tration is to provide \athletics for .all.\ Although the act of the faculty may appear paradoxical· to this policy, it is hoped that rather than remove phys]cal training, it will stimulate it. Not only will this step allow mol'e time for the gymn[J.sium to be used by the members of all classes, but also, by the shifting of la.b sections to end at 8:80 o'clock, more time will be available for men to compete in intramural sports as wen as in other extra-curricular activities. The students themselves, by the time they have reached the rank of sophomores, should have come to the conclusion that pl!y-sical :.health must. be maintained for the greatest efficiency in their worh:, whatever it may be, .Acquainting- them in their first year with the facilities and equipment of the department of physical educa- tion should make them desirous of continuing work in that department through an the succeed- ihg- years of their college life 1 especially when they know that by the move of the faculty, men will be available to instruct those whose time was formerly taken up with routine work. The :abolition of the compulsory ·features w'ill have a psychological effect on the students. Most people; and especially college men, ft.nd distaste- ful any semblance of compulsion, and conse- quently do everything in their power to esca.pe their duties. With physical exercise for SOJlhO- more:s made voluntary, it is hoped· that more men than ever will take advantage of the equip- ment and facilities offered them. :M. B. M.

FENCERS STILL HOPE TO MEET WILLIAMS Word was received by Mr. Kurt v:on Fo:rstmeyer last Friday that the :fencing meet with Williams sc\heduled :tor last Saturday had b~en cancelled. Reasons for this Sttdden action are as 'yet unknowri. It's .. like this: ·You don't want a strong, rank cigarette; you don't want one :that's tasteless. You want one that lets you know that you are smoking, but you don't want one that's bitey. Chesterfields are milder . . . and yet They Satisfy. • • .Although the meet has been ca.l!ed .off indefinitely, the Union fe~cers anticipate an encounter \W:tth Williams soon. The fad that t~ere will not be a boxing, wres- tlrng, and fencing e:ldlibition this Year will not affect the plans of tll.e fencers. Practice has been as consistent and arduous as ever ~heir aims are not exhibitions but competitive meets with other col~ · l~ges. 1 Interest in fencing was revived · a.st year by Mr. Kurt von Forst- ;n.e:ver when he came to Union .as ll~structor in: German. Since then the sport has aroused much inter- est ·on the campus and many men have. elected it to fulfill their gym ~equ1rement. If :the interest which encing has evoked among the es er 1e ~tude!lts does not diminish, it may ecome .a minor sport. @ 1933 'LIGGETT & MYERS ToBMiCO Co. tie. dtjruefte tiat!J WLDEB tie ctfruet/e that TASTES BETTER

Friedman ON CO:L:LEGE STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS Do we college students realize that parents are spending nearly a billion dollars yearly on us,· so that we may obtain a college education? This editorial assumes that a college education is of advantage, and will attempt to show sor;ne -correlation betw€en the facts and knowledge gained at college to the practical application pos- sible in the home. Alvin C. Busse, director ef Public Information of New York university, in an article appearing in Sunday's edition of The New York Herald- Tribune, b11aught out the rather startling point that we undergraduates do not attempt to trans- fer the wisdom which we obtain in school to our parents. This :lack of a close relationship reduce§! the potential return on parents' investment~. in sending us to college. Is the money spent by our parents returning the greatest possible benefit? Mr. Busse attempts to show that jt is not. He says: \The dinner hour (potentially the most profitable family hour of the day and the one most woefully misused) is likely to reveal that so far as .John's day at the university was concerned, he is now a pledgee of the \best\ fraternity, a likely prospect for the Glee club, the debating team, the Frencb. club and .so on in comparatively unimportant detail. He may have learned the same day that the g:_overnment was running into debt and that a proposed tax bill would increase substantially the amount 0f the family taxes-but that important information is left \back at school.\ There is, by the way, a class dance to be held within a week and a new tuxedo for John would be appreciated. John may have learned at the university the same day that a new supplantive indus- try would probably get under way soon be- cause of a new discovery in science. It is quite possible that \some day\ t:P,e business in which his father is now engaged would therefore be affected adversely. But the in- formation is left where it was discovered- 'The :life of a Concordy columnist :becomes more djfficult, and often more danger.ous, with each. new edition.

This un- expected delay is an awful .shock to ·those meR who· have waited so long for spring vacl}.tion to 1 come .and go so that they may again en.ter the haHs of learning with renewed vigor and slight- ly enlarged heads. Now the:ve is nothing to come , back for ex:cept the very :boring scheduie of classes and week-ends. The only ray of ho.pe for these men is that Governor Lehman ,promises them ·reUef fGr the read·ing period, at which time the student mind will be taxed to the upmost. * * * Sunday afternooN a joint tea was held for the Russell' Sa.ge and Union College student bodies at ·the home of R. M. on Wendell avenue. Re- freshments weve served by the colored maid with the very able assistance of Mr. Powers Clinton of Tro.y who is one of the more versatile gentlemeN on the campus. Mr. Godman was unable to pout due to recent injuries. W•e would suggest, George, that .from now on it would behoove you to stay away :lirom the elephants and avoid further acci~ dents. * * * Last week-end Union College represented China in the Model Council of the League of Na- tions at Syracuse. Our friend, Mr. Schwe:nger, the recent guest of the state of Massachusetts, also went to Syracuse. In an interview th:is morning Mr. Schwenger informed repor-ters that after his graduation from Union (wllich. will oc- cur anytime within the next four or fi.ve years) he intends to return to Turkey and continue his very ]Jrosperous business in that country. He also informed the reporters that he will be ac- compa!lied by his friend, Mr. C. P. Palmer. * * * With the advent of the lacrosse season the campus begins to look as though it were inhabit- ed by a group of over-inspired scientists in dili- gent pu:rsuit of the evasive butterfly. We might suggest that Professor Mavor be appointed to assist Coach Harkness in the coaching .of the gentle sport. However, with such valuable ma- terial as Junior Dill (the fourteen-year-old won- der), .Austin Pierce-Arrow Gillette and last but not le~st tl:J.~t Speed Demon, John King Sullivan, a very successful season is assured. * * Last week in Chapel, Mr. Achilles requested that the students refrain from walking on the grass and use the walks provided by the college. Possibly we misunderstood but we have never heard .these rivers of mud referred to as walks, although I think they have been called about eve'fything else. Perhaps the administration might provide rafts or motorboats to carry the students from one class to another. If this is. too large and ex.pensive an undertaking the students might at least be provided with rubber boots for the sp.l'ing season. M.G. at the uniV-ersity.

For example, they 1 laid a huge conduit under the I4arlem River. They dredged a trench in the river bottom, lowered enormous sections of tron ptpe, sent down divers to join the sections, encased the finished tube m concrete. Through this they ran telephone cables forming one of New York's main li.nes of communication. Across the Gi-la River in Ariz.ona they constructed a catenary span 2373 feet long. To bridge ocea.ns, they developed radio tele- phony. They have built telephone lines over moun- tains, across deserts, through swamps. Their resourcefulness in getting through, over or under natural barriers makes possible telephone ser- ~i:ce that is practically world wide in reach.

THE CONCORDJENSIS, TUESDAY, MARCH 28, 1933 ==~==~======~====~~==~ Music By RANIUNE HINMAN '\Ve were interested that the Sun- daY program of abstract Bach 111 usic attracted the same large audience that has come this month for Schubert, Liszt, and modern ,A:Inerican and French impression- ist m.usic. But though Bach music is b:ighiy technica1 and intellectual, it is not cold. The most intricate passages of the D minor Concerto seemed impregnated with the sin· cere serenity and strength of the composer's character. We were glad Professor Tid- marsh included the familiar Air fer G string and the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, for the beauty of these works, the rich melody of the Air and magnificent har- monization of the latter grow on us with each hearing. intensity that seemed to give phil- 0Sophic import to the idyllic ex- pressi0n preceding. Liadoff's tone poem, \Le Lac Enchante,\ was in some r,espects the most difficult and effective work of the eveaing. Its intagible, halituous weaving of effects re- quired as delicate orchestFa con- ducting as we have ever witnessed. The exquisite diminuendo at its close was so perfectly executed that it was impossible to distin- guish the final cessation of sound as the image of the phanton1 lake vanished. Two highly dramatic num.bers, Weber's \Der Freischutz\ Over- ture and the Closing Scene f~·om Wagner's \Die Walkuve\ balanced the program admirably. a soul that transcended its instru- ment. Union students present at both had heard the greatest piano work they may ever hear, that of Rachmaninoff and Paderewsky. In contrast to Rachmaninoff's impec- cable work, the occasionally faulty manity of his music. In the Ta.usig arrangement of Vij'dber's \Invitation to the Dance\ 2'1d in Beethoven's \Sonata Ap- passionata\ Rachmaninoff was lit- erally astounding; we have never heard such command of technical effect as he exerted. Indieative of his iRterpretalions was the unusual dignity and restraint with which he played Schumann's \Nacht- stuck.\ Andrew Vogel Talks On Modern Buildings Mr. Andrew Vogel of the Gen- e~al Electric Companv, spoke on \Modern Industrial Buildings\ at tlle meeting of the .American So- ciety of Civil Engineers held' Tues- day evening in the Civil Engineer- ing building. He described the new turbine plant in Russia and two buildings in Philadelphia, il- lustrating his remarks with over 5() slides. ':['he Concerto was pl:ayed with perfect fidelity t0 its eighteenth century charm and with excellent brulance and blend of parts. The exquisite Largo was probably the loveliest portion of the progFam; the pure delicacy of the muted strings in this movement was care- fullY retained by the guest art- ists, Mr. Weiss and Mr. Malloy, whose contribution to the pro- gram was considera;ble. The Brahms D maJor Symphony which constituted the major work of the program given Tuesday evening by the Cleveland Orches- tra was a gratifying divergence from the more customary sym-1 phonies offered by orchestras on tour. In contrast to the passion- ate heights of the Tchaikowsky Fifth of the profound depths of Beethoven's Seventh, Mr. Sokoloff brought forth a refined, intellect- ual product that, like the com- d d :PSY'CII&LOGY CLUB MEETING poser, bordered between the class- Thursday evening a cro-w e ic and the romantic.

The flowers, called \magicians' feather flowers,\ are a regular part of a magician's outfit. The flower gir-l wears a rubber tunic and a bathing cap to keep the flowers compressed into small space.

Dairy Dr. Grover's paper dealing with this subject will appear in the London Philosophical Magazine, the oldest periodical on physics in the English language, it was learned today. The paper is en- titled, \On the use of arithmetic and geometric mean series for the calculation of elliptic integrals with special reference to the cal- culation of inductance.\ The March, 1933 number of the American .Journal of Science car- ries an article by Profes:sor Ed- ward S. C. Smith of the Depart- ment of Geology dealing with his investigations of the· I'hyolitic lavas of central Maine. 'Dhe ftrst part of the paper deScJ'ibes a rather rare occurrence of garnet crystals in this type of lava; the . second part describes t~o new rhyolite localities in Maine. Professor Smith's field studies for several years past ha~e been concerned with the extensi~e areas of this type of lava which emanat- ed from volcanoes that ~isted mil- lions of years ago in that .part of New England. :Nearest the Campus ·1 509 UNION ST.

GERMAN MOVIES SHOWN BY FORSTMEYER MONDAY About seventy people attended Mr. Kurt von Forstmeyer's show- ing of three motion picture films on Germany Monday evening in the Old Chapel. The films were shown under the auspices of the German club, to whom they were loaned by the German. Tourist In- formation Bureau. The first film, which had titles in English, shoWed scenes of Ber- lin. The other two, which dealt with Nuremberg and Petsdam, and with the Bavarian Alps, had German titles. Mr. Forstmeyer spoke briefly on the subject on each film before it was shown and translated the foreign titles. The German club expects to have similar programs to offer in the near future.
