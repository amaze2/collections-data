Those clubs that bave not yet submitted. revised budgets must do so by October (J. Changes will be made pending review by Student Forum. Union's clubs and activities are facing a deficit of $44,32.6 dollars rather than the $21;000 reported at the end of last year. Mark Richter, vice president for finance, and the other finance representatives have been meeting with clubs over the past two weks 1:0 discuss any feasible cuts clubs can take in their budgets. Richter offered reasons for the problem of tlte deficit ranging from th:e responsibility of the clubs to the optimism of the former Finance Committee. Richter commented that a leading reason for the deficit is the overspending of clubs. A:t the end of last year, many clubs did major purchasing. Because of the lateness in spending and tme lag in billing, many clubs were ever budget. Another reason for this deficit originates from the optimism of las.t year's Finance Committe. \Overestimated beginning balance gave u~ monies we didn't have,\ comments Ricilter. The former Finance Committee planned on 2,.100 students this year. However, this figure was altered by ·the r:educed number in the freshltlan class, the transfers, and those students who were unable to return to Union this fall. 2.100 students paying an activities fee of $159 would produce $331,800 for this year. Clubs' budgets were based on this figllfe when, in fact, the actllal figure is approximately 5318,000 .. With ihe $44,326 debit that figure is further reduced to $305,000. Contributing to the finance problems is the: policy of \use it or lose it.i\ Clubs, as it stands, must !;pend all their budgeted monie:s cr the surplus · will return to the activities fund. This may change to a \keep half, ret!lln half'' policy offer incentive lo the clubs not · to go on spencling binges.

They have also decided to appoint a consuJtan t to advise and assist in the search process. Lastly, the Committee has begun to focus on the most desirable skills and qualities needed in a new {)'resident. There are approximately fifteen members of the Presidential Search Committee.

Page 2 CONCORDIENSlS, October 5, 1989 Olnncnrhiensis N.EWS ANALYSIS By CARL R. FRIEDRICJI, JR. In recent years, Union College has begun a massive metamorphosis. It has taken on a new vigor, which has improved the status of the College, but additionally has had detrimental effects on the Greek life here. In their effort to make Union another Williams, the College has begun to attempt to dismantle both the fraternity and sorority systems. Union, which is proud enough to claim the founding of six national fraternities in their publicity brochures, has within this decade either relocated, removed or .failed to grant housing to no less than five organizations. How thay accomplished this has been through a variety of methods, some more noble than others. In addition to those mentioned, at least four others are in jeopardy of losing their place at Union. The force of change comes from a variety of excuses, from a desire to expand (Union just sold the Girling Center), to a housing problem (one SPAA Requests Boycott Of Gillette Products By JOHN KELLER It has recently come to the attention of several Animal Rights organizations that the Gillette cosmetic corporation has been conducting inhumane product testing on helpless animals. These tests include the Draize Test, in which chemicals are relentlessly dripped into a rabbit's eyes, as well as various skin tests, all of which result in the senseless torture of the animals. Organizations such as PET A (People For the Ethical Treatment of Animals) and others have argued that such testing is unnecesary. Alternate product testing methods are readily available, such as synthetic skin-patch tests, computer models and organ, tissue and cell-culture tests. However, the fact of the matter is that the Gillette Corporation is unwilling to utilize these methods because it would have to incur the added expense of these alternate methods. To many, this reason is completely unsatisfactory and therefore, a boycott of all Gillette products is being called for, including razors, shaving creams, deodorants., hair products and Liquid Paper Correction Fluid, which is a subsidiary of Gillette. It is hoped that a message will be sent to the executives of the Gillette Corporation and that they will eventually put a stop to all animal testing.

The first ·of these questions . asks about the effectiveness of leadership by three parties. The results show that appro:ximately 15 - 20% of the respondents agreed that any of the tllree groups effectively lead. Also interesting to note is that within the questionnaire, almost half of the respondents could not name their representative to the Board of Trustees as well as the Faculty Execlltive · Committee, the Faculty Review Board and the Academic Affairs Council.

Only 12 of the 89 respondents said that the college does establish clear budgetary policies of some form or another. Only 14 hel<l a \middle-of-the-road\ positio11 while 64 disagreed in some way ..

This question asks if students should be allowed to llave a vote on committees charged with formulation of academic policies and procedure. The results of this question show only 27 faculty members favoring a student vote with 44 being against it. This can be demonstrated to some extent by the recent decision where only one . student was selected to help the presidential search committee.

The first of these questions asks about the effectiveness of leadership by three parties. The results show that approximately 15- 20% of the respondents agreed that any of the three groups effectively lead. Also interesting to note is that within the questionnaire, almost half of the respondents could not name their representative to the Board of Trustees as well as the Faculty Executive Committee, the Faculty Review Board and the Academic Affairs Council. The second question listed asks if clear budgetary policies have been established by the College. 0Hly 12 of the 89 respondents said that the college docs establish clear budgetary policies of some form or another. Only 14 held a \middle-of-the-road\ position while 64 disagreed in some way. These vague policies may have been. demonstrated last week when the College surprised the various clubs and organizations on campus by cutting their budgets by $13,120. this on the remoteness or the planning and decision-making process. The fifth question listed is of particular interest to most students. This question asks if students should be allowed to have a vote on committees charged with formulation of academic policies and procedure. The results of this question show only 27 faculty members favoring a student vote with 44 being against it. This can be demonstrated to some extent by the recent decision where only one student was selected to help the presidential search committee.

The first one asks if Lhc current system allows for effective faculty participation. Approximately 80% stated that the current system docs allow effective faculty participation, but the next question shows that only 30% would be willing to spend more time on service to committees. The summary of the report blames The summary and findings of the report list a lack of effective communication, lack of committee operation in accord with their prescribed duties, and a loss of faculty legislative function as some of the primary areas needing change. The overall direction of the report demonstrates general faculty dissatisfaction with the current governance system.

CONCQRDIENSIS, October . 5, 1989 Page 5 . . . FEATURE'S President Morris Reminisces After Ten Years At Union By LEE ANN SCHMITT What were tile .biggest cballenges you bad to face? !'There 11a:V:e been .several important challenges. First of all I wanted a strong academic discussion on the issue of general education, and to campus facilities such as the College Center and the Alumni, Gym. One of his favorite places on campus is in the College Center. \I like to .stand on the second floor baico11y and loC>k down on the atrium and wh:en I do ~. that, .especially in the late . ~- -mornings, th.e whole purpose ~· of the building for me is real. I w. can see what I had in mind as ·~ the crossroads of the <:amp1:1s, 1C it's there.. It symbolizes tne . 0 sense of CQmmunity.\ · ~ Morris said one of the revitalize discussion on the c;;lllricuium issue. I want;ed to rn:ake sure the financial basis of the college was sound and to hav~ a good tlelationship between the campus and the community.\ a. challenges of the next president will be to continue to improve campus facilities. Morris declined to answer what the most important attributes a · candidate for the presidency should have. It is up to the search CO\Illmittee to determine what the co-llege needs, he said. He did state however that in his role he fo11nd it very important to unders~and tbe academic concerns <Jf the college, to get those issues discussed, to be .Building a c.am.pus community was another iim:portant goal for Morris. He \\\' orked towards this -accomplishment by renovating able to raise funds, to be able to articuLate the strengths of the college, and to be able to relate to ()thcrs. \The cha:llenge of the new president will be to take Union onto its next step into the future: to try to perceive the way in which Union can meet the problc~ns of the 1990s,\ he said. Wh11.t are your future plans? \Next year l have a leave of absence lHld I will spend part of the time in Cambridge.\ Morris said that at Cambridge he woul<l work on the issue of how to balance diversity and individual rights, against unity. Morris plans to return to Union tlle following year and said he will retain his profess()rship and hopes to teach terms abroad. What was the most difficult. decision you had to make? \I do11't know if I want to tell you that. I think the most difficult job each year is getting the budget out.. .. Yes, I think, in some ways THE most difficult decision I h:ad to ever make was whether to put in th c all~ p urposc as.tro-t[Jr f playing field. The difficulty of that decision was whctltcr or not astro-turf was good for Union.\ He said the rcas<m he decided on the astra-turf wa:-; because Union is a landkJckcd campus and they needed an all- purpose field \When Enitl and I go for a walk at night up to the field we sec that it is used an awful lot for a variety of games.\ What did you enjoy most about your job? \I certainly have enjoyed trying to look at planning issues, and meeting with members of the community, faculty and students. I think in many ways it is our relationship with the f\culty and the students, the people side that we will miss the most.\ -Ne·w State :Law Will Force Unio·n To Reevaluate Social Policy ,-•1!1 • ~f By SYBIL ZANGER ~ ~ ~ \We are not above the law at Union College,\ said Dean Alford. Beginning in January 1990, there will be a law in New Yer:k bant'ling all minors from the possession of alcohol. People under twenty-one will be subject to arrest if tliey me caught hcl<ii.ng any alcoholic beverage. The present New York State. Alcoholic Beverage Control Law states that organizations and individo.als are forbidden from either providing or purchasing alcohol for lninors. The new law will expand the .financial and legal liability to i:nclude consumers along with ;tile sellers. The fratctmity and sorority neeting to go over the rules and reinforce the social policy 'Was already held. According to IDean Alford the college will 1Jlrobably modify its~ rules in :response to the new law. The Interfraternity Council is ]Jresently nominating a r~ommittee, whic-h will be m11king recommendations about how the 1990 New York :State Alcoholic Beverage Control Law will affect the :social policy for alcC>hof use. 'TI!is committee will consist of cStndents and faculty who will ])epresent a cross section of cpittions in which all sides are represented.

If interested contact Classics Department immediately!! \There a-e two forces coming together · tllat wiil influence social lif:e ~tt Union College, the change in law and the wide scale mo~ement on the part of the fratetnity nationals and insurance companies to prohibit fraternities from buying alc<Jhol with fraternity mane~.\ co.mmented Alford. \If a fraternity is having a party in which the:y are serving beer. one individaal has to sign for delivery alld is therefore liable. The new law will make it increasingly difficult to find a person callow enough to take responsibility fer lots of underage mnk.ers. If fraternities choose to me alcohol in social events, stadents will probably be responsible for l;>ri~ging their owli. Individuals would be crazy to provide on a large scale,\ comll1ented Alford \As a result of the new policies. of nationals and insurance agencies, .everyone is backing away from the liability. As they peel away layer after layer, all that's lefr is a twen~y-one year old that will p11t his name, future earnings. and possibly family's assets a-n the line to provide alcohol to people under twenty- one,\ continued Alford. Hiri11g. police for Camp Union m.ay cause problems with the 1990 New York State Alcoholic Beverage Control Law. Union is required by law to hire police for the event, but hiring police could caus:e problems. The police would be legally obliged to arrest any miners with alcoholic beverages, and at least two- thirds of the students are minors. Camp Union, however, is the only fotseeable change at the present moment. Uiitil the committee meets, the exact results of the 1990 New York State Alcoholic Beverage Control Law are unknown. In cone lusion, \The fraternities are going to nave to stop styling themselves .as bars on campus,\ commented Alford.

Page 6 CONCORDlB\'NSJS October S, 1989 ' . FEATURES Safety Meeting For Union , Students By LISA R. CHERANDE Did you know that statistical evidence suggests that every 18 minutes a woman js raped? Did you know that Schenectady has one of the highest rates of rape for a class-two city (based on population) in the country? Did you know that you can do something about protecting yourselffrom rape? Last week, th~ Union College Security and Safety Department sponsored a series of open meetings for Union students on the subject of crime prevention and personal safety. Each meeting was aimed at a particular audience. The first lecture, held on Tuesday, September 26, was targeted at females living in off-campus housing and the second lecture, at the general student population. Guest speakers at the meeting included Paul Mantica, Director of Security and Safety, Detective Larry Atianasio of the Schenectady Police Department, Deborah Gilbert of the Rape Crisis Se~;vice and Jennifer England, a Union Colleg senior. Their pmpose was to educate students about the existence of crime in Schenectady and what students can do to protect themselves. The first speaker, Deborah Gilbert, cited the statistical and personal realities of rape. She attempted to dispel the myths that much of the population has about rape. For instance, many people believe that rape is an impulsive act, when it is, in most cases, a planned action that is used· as an expresssion of frustration and the need for power. Another popular myth is that one can detect who is a rapist and who is not. Gilbert said that rapists can \wear three- piece suits and make lots of money,\ just like the rest of the population. That victims asked to be raped is another common misconception. As we all know, nobody wants to be raped Finally, that rape is The Writing Center Do you ever have trouble beginning a paper, organizing your ideas, knowing how to end? Are your ·sentences sometimes so convoluted that YOU have trouble wading through them? Do you suffer from \writer\ block\? If your answer is \yes\ to any of these questions, the Writing Cemt:r may be able to help you. Located on the second floor of Whitaker House, The Writing Center offers a place for writers to come at no cost and ~eel< help with ,my kind pf writing difficulty. It i~ for ~trong writer~ a~ well a~ weak ones. The actual tutoring is done by a staff of ten students: seniors Dave Adinolfi, Melissa Bloom, Carolyn Dunn, Lori Estes, Shary Luby, Christian Smith; juniors Elizabeth Berliner, Kate Kaufman, Ray Tan, Tammy Tibbetts; and sophomore Julie Walter. Margaret Wadehra, who has succeeded Alan Nelson as Director, says, \Our tutors are good writers, but even more important they are supportive, patient, and constructive. It's usually very hard sharing your writing with another person. Our tutors are sensitive to that.\ Wtiting tutors are not editors whose job it is to \fix\ things up. Instead they are readers and listeners trained to offer feedbat:k that keeps writers movmg. \The response has been very positive,\ says Ass.istant Director Sandy Longley, \and the number .of people using the Center has increased significantly over the last five years.\ The Center is equipped with three Rainbow computers and a new Macintosh. A Short Guide To Notes and Bibliograpy is in its third printing and available to anyone at no cost. Also at students' disposal is a collection of handbooks, reference materials, and texts on writing and the writing process. Hours are Mon.-Fri. afternoons, 2-4:30 and evenings, Sun.-Thurs. 7-10:00. No appointment is necessary. \The earliet a student comes in , the more we can help,\ stresses tutor Lori Estes. See Your Name in PRINT! WRITE FOR FEATURES Call Des Ward x4305 perpetrated by strangers. This is one of the most popular myths about rape. Statistics show that someone you know is more likely to be the assailant of a rape than someone you have never seen before. Gilbert also explained to the audience that even if you are assaulted, it does not mean that you did something wrong, that it was your fault. Next Jennifer England spoke about an incident tb,at recently happened to her and her roommate. They were both attacked this past summer at their house off campus. Though they were separate incidents, the police ·suspect that the assaults were committed by the same assailant. Fortunately, Jen was able to fight off her attacker. Her roommate was not so· lucky. J en feels that it is important to let students know about the incident because she .thinks all Union students are potential victims. Most students think that they are infallible, that nothing is going to hapven to them. Looking back at the incident, Jen reaLizes she was like everyone else, ''Everyone wants to feel safe in their own home, but the reality is that you are ,not. Union is not an isolated campus. It is. in a city.;'. She does not want to intimidate the campus with her experienc~. yet she hopes that students will take more precautions. She warned the audience, \People always told. me to take precautions like' locking the door and taking security, but I never djd ~ecause I felt like I was· losing my independence. You lose more than your independence .if you're raped. I don't want to scare you, but your fear will go away, mine won't. People who are attacked never lose that fear.\ The last .speaker was Detective Larry Atianasio. He told the audience to take all necessary precautions. \Even though you aren't at fault, he warned, \you can do something to eliminate the oppertunity. A· criminal will commit a crime whenever there is an opportunity, if you don't make that opportunity available, then he can't commit the crim~.\ Some slig,gestions made by Detective Atianasio and Paul Manticato protect yourself: '~'Always walk in groups off,. campus *Don't walk around late at night alone. *Travel on well-lit patbs at night - *Call escort service if you need transportation somewhere *Don't talk to strangers *Report all suspicious incidents or people to Can1pus Security at 370-6911' or the Schenectady Police at 382- 5264 *Lock aU doors and windows *Do not give copies of your key to anyone *Do not prop dormitory doors open Union College Career Festival Notice of the Career Development Center <J The eleventh annual Union College Career Festival, which will be held in the Field House on Thursday, October 12, 1989 from 12:00-4:00 p.m., will provide a unique and valuable opportunity for ALL students to di~cuss career options with corporate recruiters, graduate ::.chou! represcntati ves and professionals from a variety of fields.

The Nott is falling down, library facilities are lacking, and the student body lacks diversity. However, we can look forward to an optimistic future. Reconstruction funding for the N ott amounts to three million dollars; a sum that will enable us once again to boast pride in its existence at Union. Plans are in the works for a library annex and soon students will have apt resources .. The Admissions Office has eliminated the SAT requirement and is striving towards accepting a wider variety of students. Students will always be dissatisfied, but many of today's complaints are valid. The college is a business which puts profit before student interests. In the past the College Bookstore and Dutch Hollow Restaurant have maximized prices in order to create an abundant income. Hopefully, in the future, our new president will promote the students before Union's pocketbook. The new director of the College Center has many improvements in mind for \the mall,\ as the College Center is affectionately known by the students. Wasted space may all be a notion of the past. It will soon be the 20th anniversary of women at Union. Union opened its door to us. However, once we walked in they failed to recognize us. Hopefully we can anticipate the time when men and women will be treated equally at Union, having an equal say, equal pay and equal opportunities. We can anxiously await the bicentennial celebration in 1995. Let us hope that student interests are not forgotten in lieu of celebration plans. 200 years of existence. It has been an impressive record. It often seems that the more things change the more things stay the same; The. issl!-es o,~ campus safety, Greek life, and student dtssattsfactton seem to rarely vary. No matter what our disappointments are at Union, however, we will all miss our time spent here and will always be eager to come back! • Concordiensis' editors and staff work hard to produce the best paper we can.

The Nott is falling down, library facilities are lacking. and the student body lacks diversity. However, we can look forward to an optimistic future. Reconstruction funding for the N ott amounts to three mil1ion dollars; a sum that will enable us once again to boast pride in its ex.istence at Union. Plans are in the works for a library annex and soon students will have apt resources. The Admissions Office has eliminated the SAT requirement and is striving towards accepting a wider variety of students. Students will always be dissatisfied, but nany of today's complaints are valid. The college is a business which puts profit before student interests. In the past the College Bookstore and Dutch Hollow Restaurant have maximized prices iu order to create an abundant income. Hopefully, in the future, our new president will promote the students before Union's pocketbook. The new director of the College Center has many improvements in mind for \the mall,\ as the College Center is affectionately known by the students. Wasted space may all be a notio11 of the past. It will soon be the 20th anniversary of wom.en at Union. Union opened its door to us. However, once we walked in they failed to recognize us. Hopefully we can anticipate the time when men and women will be treated equally at Union, having an equal say, equal pay and equal opportunities. We can anxiously await the bicentennial celebration in 1995. Let us hope that student interests are not forgotten in lieu of celebration plans. 200 years of existence. It has been an impressive record. It often seems that the more things change the more things stay the same. Th~ iss~es o~ campus safe~y, Greek life, and student dtssapsfact~on seem to rarely vary.

This project cannot be postponed for \many years,\ as Ms. Bums has claimed. Concordiensis apologizes to Prof. Kellenter for the omission of her letter in the September 28 edition. Instltntional Planning Dr. Jack . Maranville, was qt.wted in the . June 29, 1989 edition of the Sclte11ectady Gazette as saying that the Nott was \a very high priority bllilding on our campus .and is one of the who are unaware that the bluestone which fell from the Nott this summer landed in large chunks which would have seriously injured, if not killed, someone, had anyone beeen prowling around in the bushes surrounding the Nott at the time of the collapse. This incident was reported in the Schenectady Gazette the following day and was featured on several of the local news stations that evening. It was a serious incident which forced Union to contract a structural engineering finn to inspect the building and·-to take steps to .prevent further deterioration. The splints which are visible to all who pass by the N ott arae actually referred to as \band-aids\ and are intended to brace the stone so that more of it will not crumble. Ms. Burns was correct in stating that Union has applied .to the Olin Foundation for funds to build a new theatre. She did not cite any sources in her article, however. I am therefore unable to determine where .she heard that \actual construction of a new theater will be many years down the road.\ This strikes me as an incorrect conclusion. Assuming for the moment that the completion of the renovation of the Nott is targeted for 1995, this leaves only six years for renovations. Before the administration can even consider renovating the interior of the building, or even initiating any serious exterior renovations, it must relocate · the theater to another site on campus. I cannot be certain, but it seems reasonable to conclude that this is the actual motive behind application to the Olin Foundation. I believe the strategy is to build a new theater soon, move the Mountebanks out of the Nott, Ms. Burns is also incorrect in stating that it will require between $3.5 and $4 million to restore the Nott. If the administration could accomplish the project at such a bargain rate, I do not think they would have hesitated to begin renovations this summer. Mr. John Hauser, Vice President of Finance and Administration, roughly estimates that the cost of renovationg just the exterior of the Nott will faH between $4 and $5 million. Since an architectural firm has not yet been hired to draw up plans for the renovation of the Nott and since a definite use for the Nott has yet to be determined, a more precise estimate cannot be made at the present time, and no one can estimate the cost of renovating the Nott's interior. Anyone Can Be a Victim To the Editor: Department While precau.tions are extremely important, quotes such as this tend to put blame for a crime such .as rape or assault on the victim rather than on the perpetrator. This leads to additional stress for the victim as well as an uneasiness in reporting such crimes.

Page lO CONCORDJENS!S, Octpb~r. 5, . 1989 LETTERS Adffi1nistration denies fair access to facilities ': - . . ' . \ To the Editcr: I am writing in regard to last week's letter by Cristina Calvi in which she expressed her disappointment concerning the International Student Union's annual use Hf Milano Lounge. · Miss Calvi, I can sympathize with you. Your club is not the only student organization which has been denied use of campus facilities for unclear reasons. As Co-Chairman of the Union College Concert Committee, I have been faced with the ongoing problem of where to put com:erts on this campus. Because of the lack of a la·rge theater, there is virtually no place for concerts to be performed for a larger audience, and the cost of renting Proctor's Theatre is not practical considering our annual budget and our responsibilities for Camp Union and other spring activities. For those of us who are juniors and seniors, the memories of nights in Memorial Chapel with Marshall Crenshaw and The Bodeans are fond ones. However, during the 1988.:89 academic year, the order came down 'from above' that concerts would no longer be held in the Chapel. The justification given was that the Administration felt it was disrespectful to have students dancing to music in the Chapel Granted, I respect that rationalization, but I beg to differ that dancing is more disrespectful than the comedy antics of Sam Kinison or even the verbal· opinions of G. Gordon Liddy (\ ... then they'll be one extra dead person in the world ... \). This fall, however, the Committee had the chance to book an artist whose music was evaluated as calm enough to be performed in Memorial Chapel. The promoter wa:s able to give us three possible dates fen the show, but when we contacted Central Scheduling about use of the Chapel, we were informed that the building had been reserved for an e11tire week's time by a choral group which was not affiliated with Union College. Though the group was only performing one night of that week, they felt the extra nights were necessary for rehearsals. I realize that by contracting off campus organizations, use of our buildings the Cdlege may generate funds, but shouldn't the student bcdy, who generates approximately $20,000.00 per year per person for the college, be given preference for us~ of campus facilities? Furthennore, I'd like to pose a general question. Are we always Union students?During . long breaks, do we still have a right to associate outselves with the college? As :young people who are attempting to further our education, are we only permitted to learn during academic terms, or are we encouraged to expand our knowledge in the 'off season' as well? As a full-time student, I'd like to believe that '1 can call Union my horne at all times, regardless of the month. If that's true, then why were WRUC DJ's denied acc:ess to the radio station this summer? As an executive board member, I was thrilled that the station had a large enough membership staying in the area over the summer months to keep. us on a regular schedule of programming. However, I was informed by Dean Mammola that WRUC is 'just another' student activity, and that student activities are to cease during breaks. Certainly I cou·ld have agreed with this decision if the station was asking for extra money in its budget or if we were in .some way harming the facilities,. but we weren't. However, Dean Mammola did allow us to use the station during regular Carnegie hours. What Dean Manunola failed to realize was that, like the employees of Carnegie, we too had '9-5' jobs, and, also, that prime listening hours are in the evening. This meant we could program shows for three hours a day, from 4:30 until 7:30 p.m. Gee, thanks. Forgive my sarcasm, but three hours a day just didn't set:?m to compare to WRPI or WCDB (from SUNY Albany) which were working on a 24-hour a day schedule. I wonder if students at those institutions had trouble utilizing their school's facilities between terms? 1 doubt it. I would hope that their administrations would understand that they were working as much as the college as for themselves. A labor of love, you might call it, that we can learn from (even between terms). Miss Calvi, ,please believe me that you are not alone in your frustration. That your group, as a student organization, was pushed out of a college building for 'administrative p1!1poses' is, in my opinion, wrong. After all, if there were no students, would there be a college? And ifthere wasn't a college, would there be administrators? Sincerely, Karen J. Schaefer '91 South Carolina Hurricane Hugo . Survivors Need Your Help Residents of South Carolina coastal communities are in dire _:t}e~d of basic supplies to enable them to begin the reconstruction of hurricane ravaged communities. An appeal is being sent to merchants in the Capital District to contribute such items as· baby supplies (formulas, diapers, baby food), camping supplies (batteries, flashlights, Coleman stoves, tents, coolers, wading boots), building supplies (construction materials, work gloves, etc.), clothing (rain slickers, blue jeans), and bedding. The magnitude of the disaster is still growing as the fundamental necessities of food, water, clothing and shelter are not yet available to the thousands of rural residents in the many counties of South Carolina from the Charleston to Myrtle Beach areas and beyond. .

SOCIAL SCIENCES REFRESHMENTS Room 112 4:30 Mohammed Mafi, assistant professor of civi:l engineering at Union College, has been named recipient of the Dow Ou tstartding Young Faculty Award by· the Americ.an Society for Engineering Eduction for ASEE's St. Lawrence Region. Mafi, who was given the award on June 26, 1989, at the ASEE annual conference in Lincoln, Neb., is one of nine people chosen for the award .nationwide. The. St. Lawrence Region, which includes parts of Canada and all ofNew York, is one of ASEE's 12 regions. The ASEE's announce.ment of the honor says the awards are given to \respected leaders in engineering education who, throug.h their teaching, research, innovation and personal commitment, have . contributed significantly to the profession.\ Mafi, a Niskayuna, N.Y. resident, joined the Union College faculty in 1985. He has developed new courses in computer graphics and in computer-aided structural analysis. Mafi also has supervised the expansion of the RISING SEA LEVELS? FOOD FROM THE SEA'! COASTAL Discover a challenging the past, the present, and - MARINE ECOLO(;y - MARINE POLICY - MAIUTlME HISTORY A'i' SEA - LITERATURE OF THE SEA .

OCTQ:I}f:l~, .. jj~'(J~ college's civil engineering computer facilities. He developed a structures laboratory that enhances the students' knowledge of struct1,1ral engineering by allowing them to experiment with and observe the bahavior of model beams, trusses and frames under different loading conditions. The students then compare their experimental results with their manual calculations and the results of computer programs with graphk capabilities. Mafi said the laboratory combination of model building, manual calculations and computer simulations is unusual, if not unique, in undergraduate structural engineering programs. Mafi's paper, titled \Involving Students In A Time-Saving Solution To The Homework Problem\ was published in the April 1989 issue of the ASEE's Engineering Education M a g a z i n e . The paper describes a method by which busy engineering professors can involve students in the grading process and enhance students' learning while allowing the professors time for more productive work. He presented a paper on \A Basic Expert System For Type Selection of Bridges (BEST Bridges)\ at the ASEE conference in Portland, Ore., in August 1988. Mafi is a registered professional engineer in New York and Pennsyhania and also has taught at Pennsylvania State University. As a consulting structural and forensic engineer, he conducted an investigation of the April 1987 faifure of the New York State Thruway bridge over the Scoltarie Creek: He was commissioned by the Times Union newspaper in Albany. Mafi also investigated the safety of the 24-span Acosta Bridge in Jacksonville, Fla., last year. He was hired by WJYT television a CBS affiliate in Jacksonville. Mafi received a doctorate in civil engineering (structures) from Penn. State in 1985, a dual master of science degree in civil engineering and operations research from Penn. State in 1980, and a bachelor of science degree in structural engin.eeri ng at Shaari f University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1977. Besides the ASEE, he is a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers; American Concrete Institute; Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute; Chi Epsilon, a national civil engineering honorary society; and Tau Beta Pi, a national engineering hororary society. Union College Given Grant For Chaos Fractals Laboratory The Union College physics and mathematics departments have received a $59,140 National Science Foundation grant to develop a laboratory to involve undergraduate students in examining the blossoming fields of fractal geometry and chaos. The .grant was received by Professor Michael Frame in the Mathematics Department and Professors Roset Khosropour arid David Peak in Physics. It will be used to purchase computers for simulations and numerical experimentation as well as state-of-the-art hydrodynamics, electrical circuitry and acoustics. The laboratory will be used in three or four courses, including a course for non- science students given by Frame and Peak titled \Order and Chaos: Art and Magic.\ Peak said the new labotatory will be \a very powerful tool for teaching\ because it will be \extraordinarily visual.\ Fractals are physical or mathematical objects that look more or less the same at all levels of magnification, said Peak who is chairman of the Physics Department. An example might be a snowflake, which on a crude level looks like a star, he said. When an arm of the flake is magnified, it reveals bumps that themselves look like li Hie stars. Chaos, in the scienttfic and mathematical sense, refers to a system that changes in time, where the future is completely determined by the past but where the outcome shows an extremely rich complexity, said Peak, -citing the turbulent flow of water in a very rapid river as an example. Both fractals and chaos result from what are called nonlinear phenomena, Peak said. The weather is another example of a nonlinear or chaotic system. It is a highly complex system produced by the interaction of many factors in which a little doubt about the exact conditions one day can destroy the possibility of predicting the weather days later, he said. On the other hand, Peak noted, the computation of bank account interest would be an example of a simple, linear system. \The world is nonlinear almost all of the time,\ said Peak. \We try to pretend it's a linear place. But there are really no straight lines in our world.\ Peak said; for example, that people often simplify the world's geometry by seeing it as a place filled with classical shapes, such as cones, cubes, and spheres (for example, mountains seen as cone-shped), when, in fact, it is much more complex.

Mafi, who was given the award on June 26, 1989, at the ASEE annual conference in Lincoln, Neb., is one of nine people chosen for the award nationwide. The St. Lawrence Region, which includes parts of Canada and all ofNew York, is one of ASEE's 12 regions. The ASEE's announcement of the honor says the awards are given to \respected leaders in engineering education wlw, through their teaching, research, innovation and personal commitment, have contributed significantly to the profession.\ Mafi, a Niskayuna, N.Y. resident, joined the Union College faculty in 1985. He has developed new courses in computer graphics and in computer-aided structural analysis. Mafi also has supervised the expansion of the RISING SEA LEVELS? FOOD FROM THE SEA?

He developed a structures laboratory that enhances the students' knowledge of structural engineetillg by aHowing them to experiment with and observe the bahavior of model beams, trusses and frames under different loading conditions. The students then compare their experimental results wi,th their manl!lal calculations and the results of computer programs with graphic capabilities. Mafi said the laboratory combination of model building, manual calculations and computer simulations is unusual, if not unique, in undergraduate structural engineering programs. M a fi ' s paper, t i tl ed \Involving Students In A Time-Saving Solution To The Homework Problem\ was published in the April 1989 issue of the ASEE's Engineeri11 g Education M a g a z in e . The paper describes a method by which busy engineering professors can involve students in the grading process and enhance students' learning while allowing the professors time for more productive work. He presented a paper on \A Basic Expert System For Type Selection of Bridges (BEST Bridges)\ at the ASEE conference in Portland, Ore., in August 1988. Mafi is a registered professional eAginecr in New York and Pennsylvania and also has taught at Pem'lsylvania State University. As a consulting structural and forensic engineer, he conducted an investigatiofl of the April 1987 failure of the New York State Thruway bridge over the Scoharie Creek. He was commissioned by the Times Union newspaper in Albany. Mafi also investigated the safety of the 24-span Acosta Bridge in Jacksonville, Fla., last year. He was hired by WJYT television a CBS affiliate in Jacksonville. Mafi received a doctorate in civil engineering (structures) from Pen a. State in 1985, a dual master of science degree in civil engineering and operations research from Penn. State in 1980, and a bachelor of science degree in structural engineering at Shaa ri f University of Technology, Tehran, Iran. in 1977. Besides the ASEE, he is a member of the American Society of Ci vi I Engineers; American Concrete Institute; Concrete Reinforcing Stee I lnstitute; Chi Epsilon, a national civil engineering honorary society; and Tau Beta Pi, a national engineering hororary society.

Powerful Message Still Remains at Dachau By ANDREW SALEM When I was a senior in prep school I enrolled in a fascinating course titled \Nuclear P.roliferaton and Responses.\ It was taught by a brilliant professor who happened to be a well known demonstrator during the days of Kent State. Although he tried to be objective, :his negative views toward nuclear weapons seemed to seep through. Over dinner with my dad during this time, I began our often heated father-son conversation with the . . ..,. statement, \We never should have dropped the bomb on Japan.\ Pardon the cliche, but to _put things mildly, \that was the end of it.\ In a restaurant packed with listening ears my dad proceeded to publicly humiliate me fot my statement. Is my father a ruthless killer? No, he is a veteran who served in the pacific during World War ll. I never really believed my father, since after all sons never do, until today. Today I visited Oachau, a beautiful German town blackened forever by the remains of Hitler's first death camp. My father was correct, war is hell.

Orientation ~ A Year Long Exp:eri.ence By LISA PLOTNlK Each year, Union College partiC'ipates actively in student exchange programs. In addition to sending Union students to host countries, we receive students to host ourselves. Every year, our host program seems to expand not only in number of students, but also in culrural diversity. This year we have students from western Europe, South America, and Asia, representing seven. countries. Union offers each exchange student a unique opport11nity to adapt to college life in the United States. During orientation and throughout the school year, eac·h exchange student is pa.ired with a Union student \·buddy\, a student who participated irl a term abroad and now has to be an Internationar Student Assistant.

Perfect therapy for those tests and paper blues. The lead, Captain Cocorarn, was played by Keith Jurosko. What is neat about him is that he was born and raised right here in Schenectady. He is a former member .of the Schenectady Civic Players, and has been a member of the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players for the past ten years. He also travels around the country and the world singing with La Gran Scena Opera. Juroska. is now working with Opera Northeast in his new role as Captain of the H.M.S. PiHafore. Jurosco says he's very excited to be performing at Proctor's because it is 'a wonderful opportunity; to sing for family and friends in one of the most beautiful theaters in the world.' Anyway, here's ~he scoop. There is this \plump and pleasing person\ named Little Buttercup, who is in love with Captain Cocoran. She won't confess her love for him because she is of a lower class than he, and that just won't do. Then there is the Captain's daughter, Josephine. She is in love with the \able seaman\ Ralph Rackstraw; he is in love social status, they are forbidden to hook up. But wait! There's more! Sir Josepl'l Porter, who is by far the funttiest character ilil the musical, l~es Josephine and wants to mmy her. But as we already kn<Jw, Josephine wants to marry R.alph. And, to make things even more complex, Sir J\seph's first cousin, Hebe, vvants to marry Sir Joseph. (Isn,t that illegal in most states?) If any if all of this sounds famlliiar to you, it's probably like the :;ocial scene at Union. Some things never change. The plot thickens at the end of the show, and things get a little crazy on s;tage. I won't ruin it for you if you haven't seen it, but...oll,. forget being nice. I want to nuin it for you. Little Buttercup explains to the crew that many years ago she mixed two baby boys up, and now she wants to undo her mistake. Captain Cocoran is actually Ralph ltackstraw, and vice versa. Do yo0u know what that means? ''0 bliss, 0 rapture!\ they sing, because now Ralph is worthy of Josephine, and Uttle Buttercup of the Captain. Even Hebe and Sir Joseph get tOogether. All the men sing to their respective brides-to-be. attd GiJbert and Sullivan encl. their comic with her as well.

It's October and the playoffs have started, so do you want to know what :I'm gong to do?!? I'm going to talk hockey, because wlut else is there to say about baseball after already compiling rny top ten list? Anyway, the National Hock:eyLellgtle's regular season begins to11ight with the Calgary Frames attempting to defend their Stanley Cup Charnpionsltip. And, they will, with as tn11ch ease as last season. rhough Lanny McDonald has. retired and Haakert L<lob has returned home to Sweden., the Flames v:lU be jast as strong with the addition of Soviet star Sergei Makarov. Tllis right wing was one of the three best players in the world ()over the past decade along with Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux. He is the consummate f<>rward. Makarov can skate, shoot, score, and even play defense. He just makes the rich Flames even richer. The Va11couver Canucks have also filled their coffers with Igoi Larianov and Vladimir Krutov. These two Soviets, along with Makarov, formed o11e of the most intimidating and lethal lines in the history of the game, the KLM Line. The Canucks' nonexistent cffense will receive a great boost from these two agjng stars, and it might even lift them inf;o third place in the Smythe division. But it will be tough to be.at the Los Angeles Kings and Edmonton Oilers, two teams il()aded with offense. The team that is able to balance it; offensive attack with some tlefense will have the most success and will finish second in the Smythe Division. lil Winnipeg, the Jets are j11;t trying to win 10 games in tile division, but will have a devilof a time. The Norris Division will be just as clo:;e as the powerhouse Smythe. Tlte difference is that the teams. are not as good,. top to bottoill. The Chicago Blackhawk; !>tunned the league last·seasonby advancing to the Conference Finals. This year, they will edge out Steve Yzerman alld the aging Detroit Red Wings for the division title .. The St. Louis Blues, Minnesota· North Stars and Toronto M'aple Leafs will battle for the last playoff spots, but Toront-<J has the biggest handicap i11 owner Harold Ballard. Ah, finally, a runaway division. The Montreal Canadiens we a lock to win the Adams Division. They have multitudes of talent tluoughout their lineup. The Buffalo Sabres and Boston Bruins will battle for second place, but look for the Sabres to take it. They bave rid themselves of Ted Sator and have added Soviet defector Alexandr Moligny. The Hartford Whalers and Quebec Nordi<Jues will make it interesting, but Hartford's management is just getting adjusted and the team doesn't have much talent. The Nordiques, on the other hand, have a few stars, including new addition Guy Lafleur. With the presence of The Flower and the return of coach Mi.chel Bergeron, Quebec should make its return to the playoffs. The division that I can't make head or tails out of is the Patrick Division. The only thing I can see is that the New York Islanders will finish in last place. Beyond tllat, who knows. Five teams, the Washington Capitals, Pittsbutgh Pe11guins, Philadelphia F·lyers, New Jersey Devils, and New York Rangers will aH fight for first place. They wi II also be fighting for fourth. But to go out on a Jimb, l see Mario ending the season on top. He is too good, and the Penguins have a lethal offense. The Capitals and The Rangers will have great defenses, and the Devils will be much improved with their additions on defense (Soviets Viacheslav Fetisov and Sergei Starikov as well as Reijo Ruotsolainen). That leaves the Flyers out in the cold. As long as Ron Hextall holds out, the Flyers will falter, and he is out for at least the first 15 games with a suspension. The winners of the divisions, however, will not necessarily make the Conference Finals. Calgary is a lock to win the Cup. But they will beat either St. Louis or Minnesota to get there because there is always an upset in the Norris. Look for Buffalo to upset the Canadiens because there is also always an upset in the Adams division. Finally, I have no idea who will face Buffalo, but I have to go with my heart. The New York Rangers will win the Patrick Division. will beat Buffalo, but lose to the Flames in five games, and I never said I wasn't biased. The Concordiensis sports staff would like to welcome back all the Alumni athletes and sports writers. .~

It's October and the playoffs have started, so do you want to know what I'm gong to do?!? I'm going to talk hockey, because what else is there to say aoout baseball after already compiling my top ten list? Anyway, the National Hockey League's regular season begins tonight with the Calgary Flames attempting to defend their .Stanley Cup Championship. And, they wilt, with as much ease as last season. Thoagh Lanny McDonald has retired and Haaken Loob has returned home to Sweden, the Flames v;i\~ be just as strong with the addition of Soviet star Sergei Makarov. This right wing was one of the three !>est players in the world over the past decade along with Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux. He is the consummate forward. Makarov can skate, shoot, score, and even play defense. He just makes the rich Flames even richer. The Vancouver Canucks have also filled their coffers with Igor Larianov and Vladimir Krutov. These two Soviets, along with Makarov, formed one of the most intimidating and lethal lines in the history of the game, the KLM Line. The Canut:k~' nonexistent offense will receive a great boost fmm these two aging stars, and it might even lift them into third place in the Smythe division. But it will be tough to beat the Los Angeles Kings and Edmonton Oilers, two teams loaded with offense. The team that is able to balance its offensive attack with some defense will have the most success and will finish second in the Smythe Division. In Winnipeg, the Jets are just trying to win 10 games in the division, but will have a devil of a time. The Norris Division will be just as close as the powerhouse Smythe. The difference is that the teams are not as good, top to bottom. The Chicago Blackhawks stunned the league last season by advancing to the Conference Finals. This year, they will edge out Steve Yzerman and the aging Detroit Red Wings for the division title. The St. Louis Blues, Minnesota North Stars and Toronto Maple Leafs will battle for the last playoff spots, but Toronto has the biggest handicap in owner Harold Ballard. Ah, finally, a runaway division. The Montreal Canadiens are a lock to win the Adams Division. They have multitudes of talent throughout their lineup. The Buffalo Sabres and Boston Bruins will battle for second place, but look for the Sabres to take it. They have rid themselves of Ted Sator and have added Soviet defector Alexandr Moligny. The Hartford Whalers and Ouebec Nordiaues will make it interesting, but Hartford's managemeAt is just getting adjusted and the team doesn't have much talent. The Nordiques, on the other hand, have a few stars, including new additioR Guy Lafleur. With the presence of The Flower and the return of coach Michel Bergeron, Quebec should make its return to the playoffs. The division that I can't make head or tails out of is the Patrick Division. The only thing I can see is that the New York Islanders will finish in last place. Beyond that, who knows. Five teams, the Washington Capitals, Pittsbutgh Penguins, Philadelphia Flyers, New Jersey Devils, and New York Rangers will all fight for first place. They will also be fighting for fourth. But to go out on a limb, r see Mario ending the season on top. He is too good, and the Penguins have a lethal offense. The Capitals and The Rangers will have great defenses, and the Devils will be much improved with their additions on defense (Soviet'\ Yiacheslav Fetisov and Sergei Starikov as well as Reijo Ruotsolainen). That leaves the Flyers out in the cold. As long as Roh HextaH holds out, the Flyers will falter, and he is out for at least the first IS games with a suspension. The winners of the divisions, however, will not necessarily make the Conference Finals. Calgary is a lock to win the Cup. But they will beat either St. Louis or Minnesota to get there because there is always an upset in the Norris. Look for Buffalo to upset the Canadiens because there is also always an upset in the Adams division. Finally, I have no idea who will face Buffalo, but I have to go with my heart. The New York Rangers will win the Patrick Division, will beat Buffalo, but lose to the Flames in five games, and I never said I wasn't biased. The Concordiensis sports staff would like to welcome back all the Alumni athletes and sports writers. ••

Continued on page 3 ID Now Required At Registered Parties IFC creates New Party Policy in light of past attendance problems ' By R. REED WHIDDEN Editor-in-Chief A new Party Identification Policy has been adopted by the Interfraternity Council requir- ing students to \present a Union College ID in order to gain admittance\ to parties. The proposal was passed by a vote of 13-2 at the most recent meeting of the I.F.C. Tuesday night. The policy now compels the fraternity hosting a registered party to place two members at the entrance to check for proper identification. The purpose for this new policy is to \prevent people not attending the College from drinking at fraternity parties.\ These non-college persons refer to local residents and high school students. A provision has been made, however, for visiting friends of students. It will be possible to obtain \guest passes\ at the Information Booth in the College Center prior to the party. President of the Interfrater- nity Council Arthur Hudson commented that the creati<Jn of this policy arose from problems with unregulated attendance at fraternity parties. These problems became evident to the Administration last year. They. in turn, addressed the I.F.C. However, \the Admin- istration did not request that [I.F.C.] formulate the policy. I.F.C. took it upon itself to create it, and will take it upon itself to police it as well,\ remarked Hudson. He also stated that this is \another step te show I.F,C. is making progress in attempts to strengthen its voice\ and \to gain additional tespectJrom the Administration and facolty.\ The Conduct Committee of the I.F.C. will penalize those fraternities which violate the policy. Fines will be given to those which do not cooperate, and with repeated infractions the fines will increase. If lack of cooperation continues fraternities will face the possibility of s<Jcial probation. Earlier this week, tlie National En<lowment for the · Humanities r-eleased a startling report showing serious weaknesses. in history and literature.

REED WHIDDEN Editor-in-Chief A new Party Identification Policy has been adopted by the Interfraternity Council requir- ing students to \present a Union College ID in order to gain admittance\ to parties. The proposal was passed by a vote of 13-2 at the most recent meeting of the I.F.C. Tuesday night. The policy now compels the fraternity hosting a registered party to place two members at the entrance to check for proper identification. The purpose for this new policy is to \prevent people not attending the College from drinking at fraternity parties.\ These non-college persons refer to local residents and high school students. A provision has been made, however, for visiting friends of students. It will be possible to obtain \guest passes\ at the Information Booth in the College Center prior to the party. President of the Interfrater- nit y Co unc il Arthur II udson commented thmt tb.c creation of this policy amsc from problems with unregulated attendance at fraternity parties. These problems became evident to the Admillistration last year. They, in tum~ addressed the I.F.C. However. \the Admin- istration did 110t request that [J.F.C.] formulate t.lJe policy. I.F .C. took it tipon itself to create it, and w;ill take it upon itself to police it as well,\ remarked Hudson. He also stat.ed tllat this is \another step to show LF.C. is making progre~;;s in attempts to strengthen its voice\ and \to gain addition~l respect from the Administration cmd faculty.\ The Conduct Committee of the I.F.C. will Jlellalize those fraternities whLch violate the :policy. Fines will be given to those which do n<Jt cooperate, and with repeated infractions the fines will increase. If lack <Jf coopcratioll continues fraternities wiU face the )JOSSibility of soocral probation. October I 2, 1989 GMI Graduates Selected For Prestigious Internship By ELISE FOOD\' News F:ditor Two former Union graduate students have b~n selected to participate in the prestigious New Y ark State Mental Health Administrative Internship Pro- gram. The studcms are Dawn Chupay ('87) and Cathy Bednarik ('88). The Intcrnsh ip Program seeks to attract men and women with gradua1c manage- ment training who have the ability to become \high quality, creative menr.al health administrators able to meet the ongoing and future manage- ment needs of New York State's complex mental health service system.\ Earlier this week, the National Endowment for the Humanities released a startling report showing serious weaknesses in history and literature. The report comes from the results of a survey of college seniors administered by the Gallup Organization. This report has sparked the release of \50 Hours,\ a manual listing suggested revisions in college and university curricula. Six selected highlights from the report are listed in the box above. These give more magnitude to the overall finding that 55% of all the college seniors surveyed would have failed and another 20% would have received D's. This is frightening information considering that portions of the A.T. & T.

Some of its duties include the operation of th irty-onc psy- chiatric centers across the state and two psychiatric research institutes. The Office also fund~ licensed programs as well 1s numerous other programs serving the mentally ill that are not subject to licensure.

Page 20 Courtesy of AT&T College students across the country this fall will be studying the stock market in their quest for the $25,000 top prize in the second annual AT&T Collegiate Investment Challenge. The AT&T Collegiate Investment Challenge is based on Wall Street Games, a hands- on educational game that recreates actual stock-market trading without financial risk to the players. The objective is to compile the most profitable stock portfolio by the end of the four-month competition. Students can draw information from any source available to them -- newspapers, business journals, their professors or a \hot tip.\ By keeping abreast of the news, the students learn about various industries and business trends in America. This year's competition, with $200,000 in cash and merchandise, is expected to outdraw the first AT&T Collegiate Investment Challenge, which last fall attracted 11 ,250 student contestants representing every state. The 1989 Challenge also will include a contest for high school students. Students can call toll-free 1- 800-545-1990 to register and receive game rules and materials needed to participate. The registration fee is $49.95 for college students. Deadline for registering is Oct. 27. The top 10 collegiate finishers and their guests will be flown to the Bahamas for an awards banquet and a week's vacation. Wall Street Games was created two years ago by Tim DeMello, 30, a former stockbroker from Boston, who decided there was no realistic way for people to go through the trial-and-error phase of learning the stock market without actually risking their money. DeMelo's creation, popular in homes and offices as well as on college campuses, is a financial success story.

Students Mobilize To Support Chinese Pro-Democracy Movement Courtesy of National Student News Service In an open letter to American students this fall, the Chinese student leaders of the pro- democracy movement write, \Dear Friend: Three months ago, units of the People's Liberation Atrny loyal to Deng Xiaoping and Premier Li Peng swept into Tiananmen Square. Thousands died. Our. friends died ... Today we are asking for your help.\ That request for help has sparked a burst of activism by native Chinese and Chinese- American students, with sympathy. from other students across the ideological spectrum. Already, students returning to school after a summer of news about repression in China have organized campaigns that include: • educational events to learn about the issue and help teach others; • protests and other sym- bolic, attention-getting actions to place international pressure on the Chinese government to ' end the repression; and • actions to· pressure the American government to help Chinese students stay in the United States. More than 800 students; university professors, and China experts gathered the weekend of September 15th for a conference entitled \Perspec- tive on Tiananrnen.\ The conference-sponsored by Brandeis University, the China Scholars Coordinating Com- mittee, and the China Infor- mation Center-· was high· lighted by addresses from Shen Tong and Wu'er Kaixi, exiled Chinese student leaders. II Anything we do as Americans, even if it doesn\t provide direct assistance, gives moral support to the Chinese students,\ says Dan Silver, a Brandeis student who helped organize the conference. \Our main goal right now is to maintain interest in what's going on in China,\ says Silver. \The Chinese students and what has happened in their country are so :important that everyone wants to get involved to support them.\ On October lst, thousands of students around the world joined in a olle-day fast to remember those who died in Tiananmen Square on the day the Chinese government cele- brates the 40th anniversary ()f their revol'ution's victory. \Wu'er Kaixi and Shen Tong were the ones wht> had the idea for the fast,\ explains Liu Yuan, president of the China Information Cen1er, a student- based group established last May to connect Chinese stu- dents around the world with students in China. 11 The Information Center sent out hundreds and hUI1dreds of letters to campuses and ()rganizations around the coall try asking people to join us in remem- bering those who died in Tiananmen Square.\ In Washington, D.C., thousands of students and non~ students held a 24--holJI' rally in front of the Chinese Embassy. \We wanted to show our anger at what has happened in China,\ Lin Yuan said. The money raised from the fast, and money raised through numerous other student-spon- sored events, is being contributed to the Democracy for China Fund, recently established to help broadcast information abou~ tile events in China. The China SupiJort Network, a national student organization, was established after the June 4th massacre . to coordinate campus activism against the Chinese repressi()!i. Charlie Grapski and John · Patrick, studemts at the University of Florida and Arizona State University respectively, formed the network to demonst:J:ate the concern of the American students to the United States Goveinment andtlle world. \Students have been called apathetic in the past,\ says· Grapski. 11 But th:e amount cil activity on this issue by students this s:ummer was impressive. Students ·are realizing the importance of ·this issue.\ The network, which is active at more than 100 campuses, is establishing speaker tours that will allow experts on China and student leaders to spread the word on events in that country. Students at several campuses are lobbying for legislation to help Chinese students remain in the United States. · A bill introduced in Congress by Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) would give a two-year waiver to Chinese holders of J.:l visas. Under current law, many of the Chinese students living in this country will be forced to return to China before they can renew their visas. ..... According to Andrew Wo,. a member of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Chinese Student and Scholars Association, most of these students would be prohibited by the Chinese government from returning to the U.S. and many would face .punishment upon arrival in China.

The College, in association with the AIDS Council of Northeastern New York,. and the Schenectady County AIDS Task Forces, will be sponsoring the third annual AIDS and Sex u.ally Transmitted Diseases Awareness Week starting · October 29. This week-long . conference will present several speakers addressing a wide variety of topics related to AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases both on and off the Union College campus. Students and faculty may recall last year's AIDS Awareness Day, which featured a keynote speaker at the Minerva Hour and several smaller programs during the afternoon. The AIDS Awareness Committee which emerged from that conference has been working to develop a larger-scale conference which will utilize both Union College and the community to promote awareness and understanding .of this incurable disease as well as other STDs. The committee, comprised of faculty and students from Union College, as well as members of the AIDS Council of Northeastern New York, and members of the Schenectady County AIDS Task Force, has been working hard since last year to present this year's conference which promises to be thought-provoking as well as informative. Because such a wide range of topics will be covered dUfi,ng the conference, everyone will be able to find at least one program of interest to attend. The conference will commence on Sunday, October 29, at 9 pm on WRUC 89.7 FM.

NY 111391 AIDS A ware ness Week To Coming Union By TONIA ELLSWORTH In less than three weeks Union Cot.lege will be hosting a cont:Crence which will address two extre~nely serious issues: AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs). The College, in association with the AIDS Council of Northeastern New York, and ~he Schenectady County AIDS Task Forces, will be sponsoring the third annual AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases Awareness Week starting October 29. This week-long conference win present several speakers addressing a wide variety of topics related to AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases both on and off the Union College campus. Students and faculty may recall last year's AIDS Awareness Day, which featured a keynote speaker at the Minerva Hour and several smaller programs during the afternoon. The AIDS Awareness Committee which emerged from that conference has been working to develop a larger-scale conference which will utilize both Union College and the community to promote awareness and understanding of this incurable disease as well as other STDs. The committee, comprised of faculty and students from Union College, as well as members of the AIDS Council of Northeastern New York, and members of the Schenectady County AIDS Task Force, has been working hard since last year to present this year's conference which promises to be thought-provoking as well as informative. Because such a wide range of topics will be covered during the conference, everyone will be able to find at least one program of interest to attend. The conference will commence on Sunday, October 29, at 9 pm on WRUC 89.7 FM. Dr. George Butterstein of the biology department, Wendy Shotsky, the director of education for the AIDS Council of Northeastern New York, and Ann Smith of the Schenectady County AIDS Task Force will be featured on the radio call-in talk show \The Bottom Line,\ answering questions on AIDS and other STDs.

I laughed .several rapes have been It was last Saturday night when two individuals approach- ed me in my car. They went to both sides of the car and lifted the handles of the door. At first, I thought it was security checking to see if I was the owner of the car. They weren't Union College security guards. I sat back in my car thinking about what was happening. I cursed at two men from the inside of the compartment as I slammed the dashboard with my .fist. They began beating on the windows. Their long curly hair hung in the windows on either side of the car while the metal buttons of their jean jackets snapped against the metal paneling of the car door. They have not realized that I was in the car, until I got out in a state of fmstration and anger. The young assailant backed off in a state of drunken surprise while his accomplice in a sense of S111J>rise because reported. This inciaent of the these hard core criminals turned two young boys was just a out to be 5'2\ tall.

At a crack, without a11y hesitation these two boys went running off. The next day I was informed that several other cars were broken into, windows were smashed, and various items, including radios, were taken. In a frightening display of violence, several other crimes have been committed in the area. off campus houses have been broken into, bicycles have been stolen, and worst of all In a frightening dis,play of violence, several other crimes have been committed. campus. The intensity of the crimes is increasing and is influencing our decision to go out across campus. The question that divides us is whether we have the right to take it upon ourselves to do something about it. Starting Monday, October 16 with the World Food Day live telecast National and.

ALL 1\RE WELCOME TO M1END GOOD NEWS! ]Jy JENNIFER FRtEDMAN From the outside, Union College appears to be a haven of perfection, clad with ivy covered buildings, statuesq\le · monuments and well manicured grounds. So, for your average passerby, it seems like a pretty nice place to go ... BUT, for those who call Union home, it's a very different story. The College Center, library, and even ordinary dorms or fraternity houses have the potential to become large scale annoyances. Therefore, I've asked around and compiled a list of the top ten pet peeves here at Union College. 10. Those slippery, fatal blue tiles in the College Center that only freshmen are unaware of. 9. That annoying person who always has post nasal drip while you're trying to study :in the library. 8. The cluster of video game groupies that probably spend at least ten dollars on Arkanoid. 7. The fact that tomat<>es cost an extra twenty-five cents on sandwic-hes at the Dutch Hollow. 6. The freshmen girls who feel compelled to go behind bars at fraternities and act as if they pay social fees. 5. The fact that hardly any fraternities have toilet paper in their bathroom...;;. 4. Having to leave your bookbag outside the bookstore every time you go in -- like you're going to attempt to pocket pads of paper. 3. How everything you purchase at the Dutch Hollow has to end in a penny. Why do sodas have to be $. 71 instead of just $. 70? 2. When people go to the laundry room to check if your clothes are dry and forget to press \strut\ again. 1. That pre/post class rush that occurs in the mail room every single day. By the time you get to your mailbox, the next class has already started and all you get are those annoying campus mail bulletins tht you end up throwing out anyway. These are definitely only a few of the quirks associated with Union College. Chances are, there are millions of others. For instance, what exactly is that voice saying on the phone when you attempt to do call waiting, is it \held \hold who knows. And why is it that whenever you finally get around to paying that phone bill the secretary is always out to lunch? It's little things like this that make living at Union College such .an interesting experience. Foreign language new.s programs will be shown in the Language Lab (HU 010). All are welcome to attend.

The soda hidden in your pocket, you return· to your-· !)ooks, tum on your W aikman and begin writing. In the meantime a clueless colleague interrupts you in desperate need of your help.

Page 6 CONCORDIENSIS, Octf!ber 12, 1989 INTERNATIONAL FEATURES Fuji-San -News from the Jap·anese Term Abroad By JENNIFER KAVE This weekend Union students and some fellow Kansai Ga.idai students challenged the tallest mountafn in Japan. Mt. Fuji, reverently known as Fuji -san, stands 12,388 ft. tall and is the most famous mountain on the island. This oft-photographed and painted spectacle offers countless inspirational displays of natural ·phenomena. Our adventure began on Friday night in Kyoto, where we anxiously awaited our eight~hour 'Dream Bus.' Being on the budget plan, we did not take Japan's reknowned bullet train. Fortuntely, we were transported comfortably to Tokyo on a spacious, well- equipped bus-complete with the ever present slippers! Another train and some buses later, we were deposited at Gogome (the 5th of 104 stations). To our astonishment, we descended not into a peaceful mountain hut; but, a chaotic herd of tourists and souvenir shops galore! Unaware of what lay ahead, we ventwed 011t. Our plan was to hike for a while, and if we needed it, sleep ·out on the mountain in order to avoid spending our dwindling yen on a hut. The biggest threat was a predicted typhoon. Apparently Buddha was looking out for us. There was nothing but sun and warmth. This is especially unus11al since it has rained almost daily since our arrival. Japan is experiencing a rare \typhoon warm-up\ seaso11; but luckily, we were able to stay dry and even wear shorts until the seventh station! Initially, the pace was Olympic style; but, we soon (15 minutes later!) realized that jogging up with a backpack was a bad idea. We trudged on and lost the commercial scene. The charm of horses along the wooded trail was nothing compared with what came later. Up we went, above the trees and into the clouds! The further we climbed, the more exhilarated we felt It was as if we were on another planet! The views were exciting and unique. It seemed as if the hiker ahead of me was walking into the clouds as he navigated the curvy terrain. The landscape consisted of craggy, pourous lava rock (reddish brown in color) and land devoid of vegetation. Many hours and painful ste:PS later, we mived at one of the two stations remaining open in this post seasontime. This is another example of our 11nfailing luck. Despite our adamant assertions that we would sleep outside, not a soul was disappointed with the new decision! It was far too cold to sleep outside. And once inside, a violent storm broke out. This station was a large tatami mat room with a few low tables scattered through- on t. In the center, our elderly Japanese hosts sat around a large cauldron, making ocha (green tea) for us. It was a pleasant way to regain our strength. We contentedly shared mu food, played cards, and drank tea. Eventually, we retired to our futons which were covering the floors of a two tiered closet! Weathering •wwF •• ·- SAVE THE WILDLIFE WORLD WILDLIFE FEDERATION DO IT! Write for -International Features the stonn with us were some Germans, Japanese, and an Iranian. We learned from them that the stations were shutting down the next day! Phew! Our large group all had different goals. Those sharing my dream woke up at one a.m., aspiring to catch the sunrise from the top of Mt.- Fuji. Others waited for the sun and climbed the crater of the volcano. A few others were happy enough to go in the other direction! Again lucky, we did not need flashlights and prayers to stay on the path. There was a bright moon whose luminescence brightened the way. As we got closer, the oxygen got further away. We had every layer that we had brought and still we froze. hard to believe that a few hours later, we would be getting tanned and burn~! Well, we made it. The su.n came up and spilled its rays over the ocean of clouds beneath us, illuminating every crevice. A soul quivering experience to say the least! We later learned that it is rare to see the sunrise from the top beca11se it is usually swathed in clouds. There is a saying in Japan, \Everyone should climb Mt. Fuji once; only a fool would climb it twice.\ I disagree. Fuji-san is an unforgettable mo11ntain filled witlt an infmite amount of enjoyment. International Question the Week Q: Do you think that the Palestinians will given an independent state on the West Bank? of be Bob Vadney (1990) -Yes, eventually. Tensions are high and another spark will s.et oif unrest. The Israelis can not tolerate anymore bad publicity. The last uprising brought dissension within the Israeli government and hurt the moral of their army. The Israeli government can not afford to crack down on the Palistinians again. Joe Andrade (1990) - It would be nice if an independent Palestine existed with,out communal problems with Israel. However communal problems are numerous. Both sides should put down their guns (and their ideo-logies) but this would invite further retribution from other Arab states. This problem is similar to Northern Ireland, another communal problem, and unfortunately shall not be decided until relative peace exists in the area. David Shepard (1991) -If the Palestinians can protest in such a way that they don't ask for an Israeli crack down, they have a good chance to be given some t~rritory .. I don't think the Israeli offer will satisfy Palestinian demands because they both want some of the same land. Nat Keller (1991) - No, due to the fact that the Palestinians and Israelis have bee~ in constant turmoil in the past several years particularly. I do not foresee any posstble compromise between the two parties in the immediate future. Dork Giunfher ·Yes, I think the Palestinians should have their own country, because they have their own ideas, their values and their owi'l culture. Rob Mayow (1990) -No, I do not believe that Israel would ever allow the Palestinians to occupy the West Bank. It would not be in the interest of Israel to give back the West Bank. Other proposals for occupation have been unacceptable to israel in the past, there is no .reason to believe that this \new plan\ will be any different.

It was as if we were on another planet! The views were exciting and unique. It seemed as if the hiker ahead of me was walking into the clouds as he navigated the curvy terrain. The landscape cons is ted of craggy~ pourous lava rock (reddish brown in color) and land devoid of vegetation. Many hours and painful steps later, we arrived at one of the two s tati<Jns remaining open in this post seasontime. This is another example of our unfailing luck. Despite our adamant assertions that we would sleep ou.tside, not a soul was disappointed wirh the new decision! It was far too cold to sleep outside. And once inside, a violent storm broke out. This station was a large tatarni mat room with a few low tables scattered through- out. In the center, our elderly Japanese hosts sat around a large cauldron, making ocha (green tea) for us. It was a pleasant way to regain our strength. We contentedly snared our food, played cards, and drank tea. Eventually, we retired to our futons whicll were covering the floors of a two tiered closet!

Tensions are high and another spark will set off unrest. The Israelis ca11 not tolerate anymore bad publicity. The last uprising brought dissension v.tithin the Israeli government and hurt the moral of their army. The Israeli government can not afford to crackdown on the Palistinians again. Joe Andrade (1990) - It would l>e nice if an independent Palestine existed without communal p.roblems with Israel. However communal problems are numerous. Both sides should put down their guns (and tl:teir ideologies) but this would inv:ite further retribution from other Arab states. This problem is similar 10 Northern Ireland, another communal problem, and unfortunately shall not be decided until relative peace exists in the area. David Shepard (1991) - If the Palestinians can protest in such a way that they don't ask for an ls~aeli crack down, they have a good chance to be given some ttmitory. I don't think the ls~aeli offer will satisfy Pales.tinian demands because they both want some of the same land.

Yes, I think the Palestinians should have their own country, because they have their own ideas, their valt~es and their own culture. Rob Mayow (1990) - No, I do not believe that Israel would ever allow the Palestinians to occupy tile West Bank 11 would not be in the interest of Israel to give back the West Bank.

In 1990 a new law is expected to take ·effect that will build upon the existing one. lt will consider consumers also to be financially and legally liable. To the Editor: Although we at the College Center appreciate the desire of hthe Plant Liberators\ to upgrade the treatment and environment of the subjugated citizens of the plant world we must make the following ()bsetvation. The plant recently \liberated\ by them is known in the scientific world as a Scheffelera ArboricQla. Althoqgh the note left bellind states tbat tltey intend to restore the plant to its \natliral habitat\ we feel we must inform yo11 that this plant is native to the continent of Australia. If their organization has the funds to accomplish its stated gow I would personally lik€1 to offer my assistance in serving as caretaker of said plant in its ·transit to that faraway place. It's a tremendous sacrifice, I kn()w, but we must all do our part. I await their reply. Lee Bloomros~n, Director College Center & Student Activities Dean Alford, in an article concerning this new law, commented in last week's Coucordiensis that \fraternities are going to have to stop styling themselves as bars on campus.\ The adaptation of this law and its effects on the social life on this campus raise two interesting and long standing points. \C . 0 '' A · · 1 omtng · ·. nt nonymous y The frrst point is that realistically this law will have, as do current drinking laws, no effect on underage drinking at fraternities. The New York State Alcoholic Beverage Control Law already held fraternities responsible because they provide to minors. H anything, this will relieve legal pressures from the fraternities. An underage drinker served at a fraternity will be just as much at fault for any problems that might ensue as these \on campus bars\ are at present The second point is that of social activities. If indeed thi~ new law affects dramatic changes in the social policy, then the ever pre.$ent problem of finding alternative activities for the students on this campus resurfaces. While it should not be the sole responsibility of the Administration to provide entertainment for the campus, they are obligated to replace what they take away. What we need to realize is that, in general, the social activity most enjoyed by young adults on campus is drinking (albeit a sad commentary on our generation). If there is alcohol on campus~ students, underage or not, will drink it. Believing that this new law will have a significant effect on how~ where, and at what age students drink is foolish. The current law does not have such an effect. If students will drink, as Alford himself seems to assume, then isn't it preferable to have students drink on campus where they are safe from the dangers of drinking and driving? The social burden has fallen to the fraternitie::;. Perhaps the Administration's focus should be to help them make socializing more safe rather than cracking down on the fraternities and possibly forcing more students to gather away from Union College, a walking campus.

CONCORDIENSIS, Octoj,er 12, 1989 Page 11 Anti-Greek Policy Denies Freedom of Choice To the Editor: We would formally like to address certain grievances that have been thrU:St upQn the Greek community at the present time. The College Administration has. without c~use or reason, placed the entire Greek system under severe restrictions which infringe upon the ability of the organizations to further their presence at Union. The past few weeks have seen a continuance of an anti-Greek policy, ·carried out by an administration that has proven in .the past to be unsupportive of the student bQdy's interests. The students have continually been forced· to face decisions made without our opinions, input, and contributions. The latest in this series of \taxation without representation\ has seen a fraternity on campus denied the right to have open, controlled gatherings on a week night. These. gatherings have been part of campus tradition, where people can to go relmt, take a study break, and socialize. There has not been one incident where the campus security has been called up0n to quiet any alleged disturbances at these gatherings. We see this restrainment as yet another step in the College Administration's attempt to dismantle the fraternity and sorority systems. The contributions that the Greek System makes to the community, both on and off campus; are for worthy cau,ses which further enhance the College's reputation .. Last year alone the Greek system raised over $22,250, reported by the Concorc:liensis, listing only ten out of twenty-two houses. Besides the charity and c 0 mmun~ty service,.the Greek system provides· a social atmosphere that the school cannot afford to ignore. In truth, the school does not provide enough alternative social activities that students wish to become involved wi,th. The only time when there are events of this nature occur when there are Alumni or parents present. The freshmen class has just experienced their first I:Iomecoming. Weekend. If they wish to continue to see such a wann and friendly occurrence at the College~ then the College Fraternity system, which is based upon over one hundred and fifty years of history and tradition, should not be compromised in any manner. The purpose of college is not only to gtow academically, but socially as well. The College has obviously ignored the latter. We ask the administration why they are playing such a heavy handed role in the decision making and governing processes of our historic Greek system which the College is so proud to boast of to prospective students~- Are we not adults who are capable of making rational and mature decisions -without a' \big brother\ watching over us?

CONCORfJJENSISJ October 12, 1989 Page 11 Anti-Greek Policy Denies Freedom of Choice To the Editor: We W()llld formally like to address certain grievances that have been thrust upon the Greek community at the present time. The College Administration has, without cause or reason, placed the entire GFeek system under severe restrictions which infri.nge 11,pon. the ability of the organizations to further their presence at Union. The past few weelcs have seen a continuance of an anti-Greek policy, carried out by an administration that has proven in the past to be unsupportive of the student body's interests. The students have continually been fmced to face decisions made without our opinions, input, and contributions. The latest in this series of \taxation without representation\ has seen a fraternity on campus denied ne right to have open, controlled gatherings on a week night. These gatherings have been part of camp1:1s tradition, where people can to go relax, take a study break, and socialize. There has not been one incident where the campus security has been called upon to quiet any alleged disturbances at these gatherings. We see this restrainmcnt as yet another step in the College Administration's attempt to dismantle the fraternity and sorority systems. The contributions that the Greek System makes to the community, both on and off campus, are for worthy causes which further enhance the CoUege's reputation. Last year alone the Greek system raised over $22,250, reported by the Concordiensis, listing only ten out of twenty-two houses. Besides the charity and community service, the Greek system provides a social atmosphere that the school cannot afford to ignore. In truth, the school does not provide enough alternative social activities that students wish to become involved with. The only time when there are events of th,is nature occur when there are Alumni or parents present The freshmen class has just experienced their first Homecoming Weekend. If they wish to continue to see such a warm and friendly occurrence at the College, then the College Fraternity system, which is based upon over one hundred and fifty years of history and tradition, should not be compromised in any manner. The purpose of college is not only to grow academically, but socially as well. The College has obviously ignored the latter. We ask the administration why they are playing such a heavy handed role in the decision making and governing processes of our historic Greek system which the College is so proud to boast of to prospective students. Are we not adults who are capable of making rational a11d mature decisions withGut a \big brother\ watching over us? We would like to see more student/- faculty/adrninistration involve- ment and interaction, but with open discussion and without being jutiged unfairly. The student budy is responsible enough to take constructive critic ism and make amendments to its practices. The Administration would be wise to follow this example. We urge the Administration to allow the ~ludents the right to make tlleir own decisions regarding when, where, and how they cho()se to spend their time on ca.mpus. After all it is the students who make Union what i!t really is. Part of growing liP is experiencing life. Findi11g out what you can and <:an11ot handle. We must ask ourselve:s if we really want to see our fellow students experime11ting off campus, in an uncontrollable and dangerQ<us environment. It would be inevitable that students \V.'Ould be going to bars~ causing problems with the local a.rea, and then driving home drunk.

By DINA SCHW·EITZ.ER Arts Editor \Happy Man\ is the name of Pt.ofessor Gu Le-Fu, a well known contemporary artist from China, who has come to Union College to share his art work and to profess his knowledge as a painter, calligrapher, and ,poet. 'Together,. his talents define an artist in every sense of tile word Gu Le-Fu was born in 1938 and grew up in the town of Nantong Jiangsu, China. His father, a famous calligrapher and amateur painter in tbeir ·hometown, taught Gu the art of caHigraphy--the basis for Chinese painting. Additionally, bis father taught him about traditional Chinese poems; which have strict rule concerning rhyme and meter. 'The art of Chinese poetty is very hard to master, but since - Gu devoted much of his childhood years to the study and practice' of traditional Chinese poetry, he knows this 3rt well. Consequently, he is a master in various fields, all of which he lectured about as an associate professor at the Nanjing Normal University, People's Republic of China. As a student at Zhenjiang Fine Arts College, from 1956 to 1958, he studied Western painting which is quite different from Chinese painting. Western painting uses bright colors in order to depict figures in a \pure and real form,\ whereas traditional Chinese painting uses black ink on textured paper to elicit a whole other form of expression. As a young man, Gu preferred Western pai11ting because it was \clear and easy,\ but as he got older he preferred something different. ln his own at Union ' words, youllg: people \like sweet drink, llut older people prefer strong tea .... \ And so ile began, at the a.ge of thirty. to combine We:stern style with traditional Ch.ioese; thus as. he went from oil to watercolor he found an expression and style all his own. · According to Gu there are two differellt techniques involved in Cllinese painting: (1) detailed, anti {2) free sketch. In detailed pa.inting he uses Western paper which cannot absorb a lot of water. Therefore, he must blot t!Je paper many times -- paying careful attention to painting within fine li11e:s. In his free sketch paintings he uses cott()n, bamboo. and rice/straw paperc These different kinds of paper can absorb a lot of water whicll makes it very difficult for him to paint on. In this medium.,. he must work diligently be<:ause the paJler absorbs the Mack ink very quickly. Therefore, he has no time to correoct any mistakes. In fact, because he cannot use a pen or pencil to sketch out his design before he paints it, he must be verr precise with every strokee This very fact reinforces the difficulty in perfecting tbis kind of painting. There are three kinds of traditional Chinese painting: (1) figure drawing. (2) flowers and birds, an<l (3) landscape painting. Gu prefers figure painting over all, but in his exhibition in the Arts Building he experiments with all three tY}les of Chinese painting. The main subjects of his paintings. however. are primarily figure drawings. His portraits are created with a fountain brush an<l black ink, and are developed using the free sketch technique. He explained to me that his portraits take him between a half-hour to an hour to create. This indicates the hard training, practice, skill, ami technique necessary to master such an art. Professor Gu Le-Fu will be here at Union College for the whole year. In the winter he plans to offer two courses: Chinese painting and Chinese watercolors. In both classes he will cover both the theory and denlopment of Chinese painting. Furthermore, in class he will actively demonstrate his art, and conversely the students will have a chance to try their hand in the art of Chinese watercolors. P'rofessor Gu Le-Fu is honored to be a visiting Professor to our College cornrrmnity, and I highly advise all to see his works now ondisplay in the Arts Building until Oct. 20. Perhaps enroll in one of his classes next term and take advantage of an opportunity to learn the art of Chinese painting from a master.

Probably not a heck of a lot, unless you were born in the 1930's and lived through the 1940's atld 1950's when this sound was, bot. Because I wasn't a part of the radio generation, the songs of the Sammy Kaye OrGitestra mean completely different things to me than they did to my grandparents. Dilling that time, m:y grandfather owned .a record store on Broadway in New York City. According to my grandmother, ''There was this new young guy who no one had ever heard l>f ... your Pop- Pop would come home from the store and listen to Sammy on the radio in awe and say 'Who is Sammy Kaye?' Only months later every one wanted to swing and sway with Sammy Kaye. It was amazing.\ When the curtain went up at Proctor's last Sunday night, my brother and I laughed at what we saw. It looked like the Lawrence Welk Show. Fourteen men in red tuxedo jackets and black bow ties, most of them with a brass instrument in hand. The band's conductor, Roger 'fhorpe, doubled as one of the three \Kaydets or Kaye Singers. This guy must have been a real cult figure. Dick Wens was the other male singer, and Kathy Lee,. Roger's daughter, sang as the female voice for the trio. It was quite a scene; very foreign to th.e .eyes. (and.ears) of two teena,gers who live, eat. and breathe MTV. If you still can't picture it, I'll throw some familia-r images at you. · Background music f« Woody Alltm movies,. hired hands for Bat M·itzvah parties, the Concord Hotel (similar to Kellenn'ann 's in Dirty Dancing). Got it now? Good. Tile .phrase ;, Swing and Sway\ became Sammy Kaye's motto very early on in the Orchestra's career. Notice how nice!}' it rhymes. Catchy, huh? Many of their songs were catchy as well. Dick's frrstsolo was to the song \People.\ Dick has one of those Perry Como- like voices ... a little sappy, but good. After the song was over~ my brother (who was. forced to accompany me) leaned towards me and said, \Do you think Dick's hair is real?\ lm)Jortant questions like this· one came to mind frequently throughout the performance. The orchestra played a lot of wonderful swinging (and swaying) tunes. Their repertoire of memorabilia masic ranged from \I Left My DUTCH HOLLOW ' welcomes the Live Band Sound of ' FUNDAMENTALS Heart in San Francisco\: to \New York, New York\; coast to coast sound, you might say. They also played i'You Are My Sunshine,\ \Ain't She Sweet,\' · \Carolina in the Morning,~' and \Yes Sir, That's My Baby\' (No, Sir, don't mean maybe ... ~) By far, the best song of the· evening was \ln the Mood,\ as a tribute to Glen MiUet (Sammy Kaye's golf partner.,J swear!)_ _ The culmination of this trl1> down memory lane began whet! Roger asked for four volunteers from the audience to try and conduct the band. Hysterical My brother was off his seat, he was laughing so hard. Th:e audience participation was refreshing to see, and we all had fun cheering for each contestant. I congratulate Ray Ringer for winning a mo:;t intense competition. Anil Susan, who was in the audience, just turned 81 years old. We sang \Happy Birthday,\ and then it was all over. I'd like to leave you with !l few lyrics from the lovely Kaydets. Here it goes. \Baby Face, it isn't fair for you to want me (if it's just for tile day,) so please don't talk about me when I'm gone.\ Wise words from way back when. don't you think? presented by Concert Committee Thursday, Oct. 12 • 8-11. p.m. • ID the Dutch Hollow Atrium FREE SODA by the Social Committee and Social Alternative Committee WING SPECIAL - 10¢ PIZZA ·(Sicilian Style) - 5 0 f/, COME ON BY AND JOIN THE FUN!

During that time, my grandfather owned a record store on Broadway in New York City. According to my grandmother, \There was this new young guy who no one had ever heard of ... your Pop-Pop would come home from the store and listen to Sammy on the radio in awe and say 'Who is Sammy Kaye?' Only months later every one wanted to swing and sway with Sammy Kaye.. It was amazing.\ When the curtain went up at Proctor's last Sunday night, my brother and I laughed at what we saw. It looked like the Lawrence Welk Show. Fourteen men in red tuxedo jackets and black bow ties, most of them with a brass instrument in hand. The band's conductor, Roger Thorpe, doubled as one of the three \Kaydets or Kaye Singers. This guy must have been a real cult figure. Dick Wells was the other male singer, and Kathy Lee, Roger's daughter, sang as the female voice for the trio. It was quite a scene; very fo:Feign to the eyes (and ears) ef two teenagers who live, eat, and breathe MTV. If you still can't picture it, I'll throw some familiar images at you. Backgroun.d music for Woody Allen movies, hired hands for Bar Mitzvah parties~ the Concord Hotel (similar to Kellermann's in Dirty Dancing). Got it now? Good. The phrase \Swing and Sway\ became Sammy Kaye's motto very early on in the Orchestra's career. Notice how nicely it rhymes. Catchy, huh? Many of their songs were catchy as well. Dick's f'trst solo was to the song \People.\ Dick has one of those Perry Como- like voices .. . a little sappy, but good. After the song was over, my brother (who was forced to accompany me) leaned towards me and said, \Do you think Dick's hair is real?\ Important questions like this one came to mind frequently throughout the performance. The orchestra played :a lot of wonderful swinging (and swaying) tunes. Their repertoire of memorabilia music ranged from \I Left My DUTCH HOLLOW welcomes the Live Band Sound of FUNDAMENTALS Heart in San Francisco\: to \New York, New York\; coast to coast sound, you might say. They also played \You Are My Sunshine,\ \Ain't She Sweet,\ \Carolina in the Morning,\ and \Yes Sir, That's My Baby\ (No, Sir, don't mean maybe .... ) By far, the best song of the evening was \In the Mood,\ as a tribute to Glen Miller (Sammy Kaye's golf partner .. .! swear!) The culmination of this trip down memory lane began when Roger asked for four volunteers from the audience to try and conduct the band. Hysterical. My brother was off his seat, he was laughing so hard. The audience participation was refreshing to see, and we all had fun cheering for each contestant. I congratulate Ray Ringer for winning a most intense competition. And Susan, who was in the audience, just turned 81 years old. We sang \Happy Birthday,\ and then it was all over. I'd like to leave you with a few lyrics from the lovely Kaydets. Here it goes. \Baby Face, it isn't fair for you to want me (if it's just for the day,) so please don't talk about me when I'm gone.\ Wise words from way back when, don't you think? presented by Concert Committee Thursday, Oct. 12 • 8-11 p.m. the Dutch Hollow Atrium • Ill FREE SODA by the Social Committee and Social Alternative Committee WING SPECIAL - 10¢ PIZZA (Sicilian Style) - 5 0 ¢ COME ON BY AND JOIN THE FUN!

If you are not a Selleck fan you may find it to be: just another run of the mill action movie. In short, if anyone else portrayed Jin1my, Selleck's character, it would not have been a good tn(')vie. \An Innocent Man\ begins with Jimmy, a twelve-year veteran of the maintenance crew for American AilHnes~ and his wife Kate (Laila Robins) living a happy middle class life in California. As the title suggests, Selleck is convicted and sent tojail for a crime he did not commit. 'f.wo crooked cops mistake his house for the home of a drug dealer. They shoot Selleck only to reali:z:e a few minutes later that they have the wrong guy. The cops are unwilling to admit their blunder so they frame Selleck for drug trafficking. Jimmy goes to jail for a crime he did not commit. He does know, however, that he was set up. In jail Jimmy faces certain death unless he stan<;is up to the evil individ11als in prison. Virgil, an aging convict, 1 takes Jimmy under his wing to show him the methods of surviving prison life. Supposedly Virgil has a vendetta against the same cops for setting him up. Jintmy must change from the good and moral person that he once was and adapt to tlte inverted society of prison life. SelLeck does a good job here. It was surprising to see him lose his goody-goody image. l{e even swears in the movie! · In other Selleck movies it seems as if he is playing Thomas Magnum. I expect him to jump into his red Ferrari at any second! This is not the case with \An Innocent Man.'' In the movie Jimmy goes through many changes over three years, none of which resemble the \Magnum'\ character .. Although Selleck's character changes he never loses the romantic leading man image. The movie was disappointing because the prison scenes were predictable. When I watched many of these scenes I felt like maybe I'd seen them somewhere before such as in a Sean Penn or Sylvester Stallone movie. The writers could have also expanded the relationship between Virgil and Jimmy in prison. I expected to see more of Jimmy and Kate's relationship consider~ng that is how the movie is portrayed on advertisements on TV. Laila .. See Your Name-· inPR·INT! w:RITEFOR A'RTS& ENTERTAI~NME·NT Robins is a good actress, unfortunately her character should have been developed more.

Although fatigued from a week of double sessions (7 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. Ugh!) the young team proved they can run with the best. Starting the day off, five women fmm the team competed in the Alumni race held on campus. Jen Lee, assistant coach and alumna, showed her stuff and ran a competitive race, showing everyone that she's just as good as she was in her college days. Tracey Reynolds ran an outstanding race, finishing second overall for the women with a new personal record of 23:26. Cindy Hunter, a new- comer to the x-country scene, proved she'll be a strong asset to the team and finished with a great first-race time of 25:23. Sue Lyon and Teresa Sibeni rounded off the team, both running strong races. After the Alumni race, it was into the vans to head over to Saratoga for the Varsity race. Sandy Anselment and Lynne Erdman both ran a strong. race, finishing 3rd and 4th overall respectively, both with seasonal bests. Dawn Harring- ton, fighting a knee injury, ran a tough race and finished with a time of 21:19, a new PR. Kristen Welch, also continuing to improve, finis bed with a personal record of her Gwn of 21:49. Lauren Katp, Jen Regan, and J en Robbins pushed each other through the entire race and fmished with a mad dash to the line. The pack running resulted in times of 22:04, 22:08, and 22:19. The team. ended up second overall behind a strong team from Mohawk Valley. One more week of double sessions for the women and they're off to Saratoga once again f()r the Capital District Meet.

Page 18 CONCORDIENSlS, October 12, 1989 SPORTS Women's X-C Team Continues To Improve By SAMMY The Saturday of Home~ coming turned out to be a perfect day for a race, and the women's cross-country team took full advantage of the beautiful weather. Although fatigued from a week of double sessions (7 a.m. and 3:30p.m. Ugh!) the young team proved they can run with the best. Starting the day off, five women from the team competed in the Alumni race held on campus. Jen Lee, assistant coach and alumna, showed her stuff and ran a competitive race, showing everyone !hat she's just as good as she was in her college days. Tracey Reynolds ran an outstanding race, finishing second overall for the women with a new personal record of 23:26. Cindy Hunter, a new- comer to the x. -country scene, proved she'll be a strong asset to the team and finished with a great first-race time of 25:23. Sue Lyon and Teresa Sibeni rounded off the team, both running strong races. After the Alumni race, it was into the vans to head over to Saratoga for the Varsity race. Sandy Anselment and Lynne Erdman both ran a strong race, finishing 3rd and 4th overall respectively, both with seasonal bests. Dawn Harring- ton, fighting a knee injury, ran a tough race and finished with a time of 21:19, a new PR. Kristen Welch, also continuing to improve, finished with a personal record of her own of 21:49. Lauren Karp, Jen Regan, an.d J en Robbins pushed ead1 other through the entire race and ,finished with a mad dash to the line. The pack running resulted in times of 22:04, 22:(18, and 22:17. The team ended up second overall behind a strong team from Mohawk Valley. One more week of d~u ble sessions for the women and they're off to Saratoga ()nee again for the Capital District Meet. Grab your friends with cars and come out to Saratoga on F1iday afternoon (4- p.m.) to cheer the women to \ictory! Roselle Eisma takes the ball upfield against Hartwick.

.· CONCORDIENSIS, Oct()ber 12, 19S9 l'a~e 19 atnn tnril i.ensis SPORTS Mike Martinez· Leads Running Dutchmen at· Union lnvy By MARK T. ZIMMERMAN Sports Editor This week's Athlete of the Week is. junior· X-C co.:Captain. Mike Martinez. S'aturday, at the Union Invitational, Mike finished first for Union in a time of 27:44.7 and , fourth overall. This was the third time in Union's four races that Martinez has finished frrst for the Dutchmen. On September 30, against Hamilton, he set - the Union course record and ran a personal best on the 8 Km course in a time of 27:34. According to assistant coach Charlie Casey. \Mike has a good sense of pace that seems ·to benefit the whole. team and is a good team leader. As a junior; lle can look foiWard to a good year next year. Now most people ahead of him are. seniors.\ The coach also went on to describe how f~ running has helped Union's scoring position in every race this year. He acts as a pacer for 'two or three of the other runners and consequently helps them pace themselves. Against Oneonta, Mike finished second ovectaJI with a time of 28:36. Tile following week at the Williams Invitational, despite .a fall early in the race, Mike managed .to. collect himself and finish with t a time of 29:23, which was second for Union beh.ind Dirk Gunther. The Dutchmen still have three meets left before .the State Meet, and Martinez is sbowing no signs of a letdown. His excellent running style allows him to keep a constant pace throughout a race. With the success he is having as a junior. his senior year should be even more rewarding. X-C Hosts Second '\ Annual Union lhvitationa. I . . By B.T.M. The Union men traveled north to the familiar paths of Saratoga State Park this weekend, where they hosted Cbrtland State, Mohawk Valley C.C., and Siena College in the second annual Union Invitational. After ru1ming an intense week of double sessions the success of the team was q~estionable at best. Charlie Casey, the new assistant X-C coach, stated afterwards, \We surprised a lot of people at Saratoga, most importantly ourselves, after finding out that we could run doubles and race in the same week.\ Casey was Hartwick College'S number one runner for four years and has played an important role in the improvement and strengh of Union's team this year. The JV squad kicked off the H.QJmec:omilng Weekend with a 5 km (3.1 mi.) race against the Union alumni here on the Union campus course. The old men fared well, taking the top three piCJces, but. the next four places were taken by members of the JV squad. Jllaior Will Allen finished a close fourth with a time of 19.:18, followed by Chris Ryan who clocked a 19:31. Mike Emmi and Mike Morin also finished sub-20 with times of 19:36 and 19:57, respectively. Peter Pretzel capped off Union's top. five in ninth \)lace with a time of 21:29. . For the second week in a row, Mik:e Martinez was Union's top· rurtrter. taking fourth place at the Union Invitational with a time of ·27:45. Despite feeling the effects of the double sessions, Dirk Gunther still ran a strong race in 28.: 18, which placed him second on the Union team and ninth ovenll. Jon Rosenfeld, finishing directly behind Dirk, ran a personal best of 28:25, which was the deciding factor in his selection as \Runner of the Week.\ Coach Casey stated that, \He (Rosenfeld). has done what everyone else has, but more so.\ Co-captai11 Doug · Martocci finished sub-30 and fourth for the running Dutchmen with a time of 29:54. Jon Dubow ran a personal best of 30:3() to finish as Union's fifth man. Bob Townsend and Ed Rothenberg completed the 8 km course in 30:40 and 30:54, res::pectively. Union finished third Ollt of the four teams witlt a total of 52 points. The men's X-C JV and varsity teams will race at Saratoga this Friday for their final dual meet of the season, competing again.st the impressive RPI Engineers.

Whatever you want to call it, this bas been the decade of the 49ers.'{hey have woa tbree Super Bowls in the past eight years. The. Raiders have won two, one in Oakland (1980) and one in Los Angeles (1933). Bnt on the diamond, the area•s fortunes have not been as gC>od, at least until now. The Oalda.nd Athletics and San Frmcisco. Giants will play for the W<>rld Series beginning on Satt~rday. But the Giants have oaly l>een to one World Series, a '19()2 loss, and have won their division on one other oc~~sion prior to this year, in 1~87. In Oakland; the A's won thrce.consecutive World Series TiLles from 1972-1974. The RuideTs also won their first Super Bowl during that span. Last year, the A's lost the W()rld Series though they were a heavy favorite going in. But this year, the Bay Area will have won a Super Bowl and a W ()rid Series. De you want more?! The Los Al!gelcs Dodgers defeated Oakland in five games last year to win the Series. Four months earlier, the Los Angeles Lakers won tbeir second consecutive NBA Championship and fifth of Jhe decade. It was also the Dod,gers' second World Series victory of the decade; they defeated the New York Yankees in six. games in the strike- sll()rtened season of 1981. Row about the New York Giants' victory in the 1986 Super Bowl? They beat the Denver Broncos and John Elway. But the Giants won because of the New York Mets' iacredi:ble comeback in the World Series three months ear.lier. The Mets defeated the B()~t()n Red Sox in seven gantes, but were down to their la~t strike and came back to win . They were a team of destirry, like the Giants. · Ev,en more?

Sure, some teams .are do-minant for decades, like the N'()lltreal Canadians in the NHL ~nd !he Boston Celtics in the NBA, and others, like the Pittsi:Jurgh Steelers, are good for o11ly ten years. The Steelers stu11k up the foo!hall field for 4() years, and in the 1970's won four Super Bowls in six years. They had one of the best teams in the hi&tory of football, if not the best. But now they are stinking up the field again. It will probably take them another 40 years to wi11 their nex.t championship. Other cities hav~ lots ()f luck to. The Cubs have not \VOn a World Series since 190~. Now . please, you have to agree that they have lots of luck to go :>vcr 80 years without a ~eries win. True, the luck is ba<l, but it is luck.

Their professional sports teams always win, always lose, or have won for a few years and have returned to their losing ways of the past. Still others remain in a state of mediocrity which seems destined to remain ami impossible to break. Take San Francisco for example. Or, should I say, the 'Bay Area.' Whatever you wal'lt to call it, this has been the decade of the 49crs. They have won three Super Bowls in the past eight years. The Raiders have won two, one in Oakland (1980) and one in Los Angeles (1983). But on the diamond, the area's fortunes have not been as good, at least until now. The Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants will play for the World Seric~ beginning on Saturday. But the Giants have only been to one World Series, a 1962 loss, and have won their division on one other occasion prior to this year, in 1987. In Oakland, the A's won three consecutive World Series TiLles from 1972-1974. The Raiders also won their first Super Bowl during that span. Last year, the A's lost the World Series though they were a heavy favorite going in. But this year, the Bay Area will have won a Super Bowl and a World Series. Do you want more?! The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated Oakland in five games last year to win the Series. Four months earlier, the Los Angeles Lakers won their second consecutive NBA Championship and fifth of the decade. It was also the Dodgers' second World Series victory of the decade; they defeated the New York Y ankces in six games in the strike- shortened season of 1981. How about the New York Giants' victory in the 1986 Super Bowl? They beat the Denver Broncos and John Elway. But the Giants won because of the New York Mets' incredible comeback in the World Series three months earlier. The Mets defeated the Boston Red Sox in seven games, but were down to their last strike and came back to win. They were a team of destiny, like the Giants. Even more? Chicago had great seasons in all four professional sports this past year. The skating Black llawks ad-vanced to the league semi-finals after a disappoint- ing regular season. The football Bears had their usual stellar year, even withoul 'Sweetness' carrying the pigskin, and they arc doing it again this season. The Michael jordans also advanced to the league semi-finals after making an incredible run through the playoffs. Thee Bull was a one- man wrecking crew, setting new playoff scoring records and just amazing and enthralling all basketball fans. Finally, the Cubs. They won, again. No, nGt the World Series. Don'L be silly. But they wo11 their division for the second time in six years. The Cubs surprised every expert and even their manager. They had a great year, giving the Windy City a clean sweep, even though no teams won a League Championship. Now why is it, in the last f~w years especially, that a city wins titles in more than one sport, or just gets great seasons out of a few teams, in tile same year? It is a very interesting phenomenon; it has to be luck! Some cities have all of it. Sure, some teams arc dominant for decades, like the Montreal C11nadians in the NHL and the B<Jston Celtics in the NBA, ami others, like the Pittsburgh Steclers, are good for only ten years. The Steelers stunk up the football field for 40 years, and in the 1970's won four Super Bowls in six years. They hnu one of the best teams in the history of football, if not th c best. But now they are stinking up the field again. It will probably take them a11other 40 years to win their next championship. Other cities have lots of luck to. The Cubs have not won a World Series since 1908. Now please, you have to agree that they have lots of luck to go :>vcr 80 years without a Series win. True, the luck is bad, but it is luck. The Boston Red Sox drought is almost as long. Tiley haven't won a Series since 1918. The New York Rangers have not won a Stanley Cup since 1940. They, like the Cubs and Red Sox, also have lots of bad luck. It's too bad that more cities cannot experience the euphoria that comes with a winning t~am. But when your hometown team wins something, who wants to give it up? Certainly not me. It's just interesting, and it defies the odds, hccJusc sonw L itil''- havc all of the luck. Come out and support the field hockey and tennis teams this Saturday. They host Middlebury and Plattsburgh respectively.

Men's Soccer Records First Victory By RON BIRNBAUM After having suffered a sixth straight loss to Albany State, the Union's Men's Varsity Soccer team has finally moved , up in the ranks. After holding on for a 1-1 tie at Vassar, a 1-0 victory against the University of Plattsburgh at horne this past Saturday added to the homecoming spirit. - As usual, the Dutchmen went into the Plattsburgh game with a positive attitude and were able to work up to potential, coming off a well- played game against Vassar. While it was a good game for both teams, Union had more opportunities to score than Plattsburgh, and the offense took many shots. The first half was well played all around, and was the squad's best all season. Although th.e wind picked up and began to make good play difficult, Junior Brian Desmarais was able to score a goal for Union early in the second half on a set play executed off a restart. On a ball played 40 yards out from goal to Sophomore Jeremy Sollinger at right wing, Sollinger indicated for the forwards to run toward near post. While all of Plattsburgh's defenders came to cover near post, the back was lefi open, and Desmarais came up around back. Upon receiving a pass crossed from Sollinger, Desmarais was able to one- time it into the net for a 1•0 Union lead. Combining ball control and an incredible job of goaltending by Sophomore keeper Paul Viviano, the team was able to get through a difficult second half and they totalled more shots on goal than in any other game so far. In addition, there was better communication between the rnidfielders and the forwards. With one win under its belt, the team now holds high spirits for future competition. It lookes forward to its next victory at RPI this coming Saturday at 1 :00 am. October 1 2.. 1989 Dutchmen Squash Caregie Mellon, 28-6 :By ANDREW SEEWALD It was Homecoming Weekendat Union College, and roughly 4,800 fans ,crowded around Frank Bailey Field to watch the Dutchmen put their unblemished record on the line against the Tartans of Carnegie Mellon University. It is impossible to gauge how much the strong fan support mattered, but the Union football team displayed a certain elan often demonstrated by an inspired team. The Dutclimen amassed a 25-0 halftime lead and then rode the tide that they whipped up, to a 28-6 victory. - Union improved to 5-0 on the season and in doing so eclipsed last season's victory total. Carnegie Mellon fell to 3-2. It was the first ever meeting between the two schools. The Dutchmen travel to Troy this weekend to take on the Engineers of RPI. The team does not play at home again until November, after it will have also visited Coast Guard and Gettysburg. The Dutchmen maintained their top ranking in the Lambert/Meadowlands po1l, as well as the third position in the NCAA East region poll. When Union takes on RPI Saturday afternoon, Head Coach Al Bagnoli wil1 be looking for his 60th career victory with the Dutchmen. Since taking over the program prior to the 1982 season, Bagnoli has a record of 59-16- 0, a winning percentage of . 787. If the Dutchmen win, not only will Bagnoli reach the milestone, but they will once again capture the \Dutchmen Shoes\ Trophy. Last year, Union thumped RPI 27-0, That, too, was a Homecoming victory 'before a large crowd, and perhaps just as impressive as this year's. Greg Hallas got Union off on the right foot against the Tartans when he sacked the quarterback and recovered the :ensuing fumble on the first play from scrimmage. Hallas. a senior, leadS the team with 6 srtcks. From Carnegie Mellon's 30, sophomore quarterbaclc Brett Russ and his offense. which piled up 36 points tbe week before in beating Albany State, struck quickly. Three IJassing .pJays and three nms, culminating in a 1-yard - touchdown plunge by_ senior tailback Ryan Mas<rn, put Union on top, 6,.0. On Union's ~econd possession, :a 42-yru'd run by Mason highlighted a 6 .play, 60 yard,. drive. Fullback: Tom Lombardoni ran tbe IJall in from the 2 and the Dutchmen led 12-0. Mason is the team's leading rusher, averagl;ng just under 100 yards per game. The fans were electrified by the fast stint, but lt was nothing compared to wltat they would see in the next quarter. The Dutchmen reco~Tered a fumble on the Tartans' 23, and then drove to the 6-yard line before stalling and then calling timeout on third and goal. At last year's Homec:()ming, Bagnoli impressed the alumni with a flea-flicker that SJlarked the Dutchmen to a rout of the Engineers. This year. th<J play be came up with was a pitch to sophomore running back Jerald Walker who ran right llefore · throwing left to a wide open Russ in the end zone,. Waik:er has become known for his option passes, but this was a new twist to that play. A 12-yard touchdown pass to Mason gave .the Dutchrnen a 25-0 halftime lead. The Union defense was in its usual spectacular fonn, and.it looked like the Dutchmen were well on their way to a shuto~~;t. For example, the Tartans gained just 32 yards on 26 rushes in the half. However, Carnegie Mellon did mount an impressive drive early in the third quarter. The Tartans ·drbve from their own 32 to the Union 16 on 11 pla.ys. On fourth and six from there, though, Rick Werdann made the play that looked like it would save the shutout when he intercepted a pass at his own 1-yard line. After the game, Werdann said that he was not looking for a turnover any more than usual, but that it is something that the defense always keeps in mind. As it tumed out, Carnegie Mellon would get on the scoreboard anyway. Mario DiLoreto kicked a field goal to put the Dutchmen UJ? 28.:0. With 2:25 left, the Tartans took advantage of good field position to drive in 'for a touchdown, but their conversion attempt failed and Union had a 28-6 win. •••• RPI is 1-3 after the14-6 loss at Iona last week. The Engineers outgained the Gaels, but were unable to take advantage of scoring opportunities. RPI' s lone victory was a 32-0 trouncing of Siena three weeks ago. Sophomre Rip Patten (61 carries- 275 yards) and junior Kevin Knox ( 46 - 206) are the leading weapons in the Engineer offense. Union has outscored its opponents 101-57. A big factor in the Dutchmen's success has been a 14-5 advantage in int'erce.ptions, espe.cially considering that an inexperienced secondary was supposed to be an Achilles' heel of the team.

Aaron Epstein controls the baU in Un,Jon's 1 aQ victory over Plattsburgh last Saturday. Jerald Walker turns upfield against Carnegie Mellon. He als()l threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Brett Russ. Men's Soccer Records First Victory lly RON BIRNBAUM After having suffered a sixth straight loss to Albany State, the Union's Men's Varsity Soccer team has finally moved up in the ranks. After holding on for a I -1 tie at Vassar, a 1-0 victory against the University of Plattsburgh at home this past Saturday added to the homccorn ing spirit As usual, the Dutchmen went into tile Plattsburgh game with a p<lsitive attitude and were alJie to work up to potentia], corning off a well- played game against Vassar. While it was a good game for both teams, Union had more opportunities to score than Plattsburgh, and the offense took many shots. The first half was wcH played all around, and was the squad's best all season. Although the wind picked up and began to make good play difficult, Junior Brian Desmarais was able to score a goal for Union early in the second half on a set play executed off a restart. On a ball played 40 yards out from goal to Sophomore Jeremy Sollinger at right wing, Sollinger indicated for the forwards to run toward near post. While all of Plattsburgh's defenders came to cover near post, the back was left open, and Desmarais came up around back. Upon receiving a pass crossed from Sollinger, Desmarais was able to one- time it into the net for a 1-0 Union lead. Combining ball control and an incredible job of goaltending by Sophomore keeper Paul Viviano, the team was able to get through a difficult second half and they totalled more shots on goal than in any other game so far. In addition, there was better communication between the midfielders and the forwards. With one win under its belt, the team now holds high spirits for future competition. It lookes forward to its next victory at RPI this coming Saturday at 1 :00 am.

It is impossible to gauge how much the strong fan support mattered, but the Union football team displayed a certain elan often demonstrated by an inspired team. The Dutchmen amassed a 25-0 halftime lead and then rode the tide that they whipped up, to a 28-6 victory. Union improved to 5-0 on the season and in doing so eclipsed last season's victory total. Carnegie Mellon fell to 3-2. It was the first ever meeting between the two schools. The Dutchmen travel to Troy this weekend to take on the Engineers of RPI. The team does not play at home again until November, after it will have also visited Coast Guard and Gettysburg. The Dutchmen maintained their top ranking in the Lam bert/Meadowlands poll, as well as the third position in the NCAA East region poll. When Union takes on RPI Saturday afternoon, Head Coach AI Bagnoli wiH be looking for his 60th career victory with the Dutchmen. Since taking over the program prior to the 1982 season, Bagnoli has a record of 59-16- 0, a winning percentage of .787. If the Dutchmen win, not only will Bagnoli reach the milestone, but they will once again capture the \Dutchmen Shoes\ Trophy. Last year, Union thumped RPI 27-0. That, too, was a Homecoming victory before a large crowd. and perhaps just as impressive as this year's. Greg Hallas got Union off on the right foot against the Tartans when he sacked the quarterback and recovered the ensuing fumble on the first play from scrimmage. Hallas, a senior, leads the team with 6 sacks. From Carnegie Mellon's 30, sophomore quarterback Brett Russ and his offense, which piled up 36 points the week before in beating Albany State, struck quickly. Three passing plays and three runs, culminating in a 1-yard touchdown plunge by senior tailback Ryan Mason, put Union on top, 6-0. On Union's second possession, a 42-yard run by Mason highlighted a 6 play, 60 yard drive. Fullback Tom Lombardoni ran the ball in from the 2 and the Dutchmen led 12-0. Mason is the team's leading rusher, averaging just under 100 yards per game. The fans were electrified by the fast start, but it was nothing compared t-o what they would see in the next quarter. The Dutchmen recovered a fumble on the Tartans' 23, and then drove to the 6-yard line before stalling and then calling timeout on third and goal. At last year's Homecoming, Bagnoli impressed the alumni with a flea-flicker tbat sparked the Dutchmen to a rout of the Engineers. This year, the play he came up with was a pitch to sophomore running back Jerald Walker who ran right before throwing left to a wide open Russ in the end zone. Walker has become known for his option passes, but this was a new twist to that play. A 12-yard touchdown pass to Mason gave the Dutchmen a 25-0 halftime lead.

Our generation will be the gerteration responsible for dealing Wif:b our world's environrrt()ntal negligence. For this reason it is to our advantage to learn how to deal with effective solid waste management now. If we \learn now we will be better able to act responsibly in the communities ·we live in in the f-uture. RAlPH \f\4E !<EC.

The idea is, however, to be ahead of the game by inciting a recycling plan NOW!

They have had to invest over $80,000 in Order to implement recycling in their community. To avoid this sudden financial oblig~tion As previously stated, instituting an effective recycling at Union is no easy task. For this reason a recycling committee is in the process of being formed. The purpose of this committe() is to show Union the amount of concern that the students, faculty, · staff, and administration have for the environment. The committee will also be actively involved with: planning and instituting the recycling program. If you are concerned with our environment and interested in recycling at Union, please contact Amanda Lewis 381- 6284. By AMANDA LEWIS Union College is working on establishing a waste reductioiJ and recycling plan I.Q be commenced by 1990. Although the administration, faculty, and students are in support of recycling, it is going to take extreme persisteflce and effort on the part of the Union community. Our nation has been dumping soli~ waste in large holes in the ground for hundreds of years and now we are left with contaminated waste in our drinking water and a lack of space to continue this practice. Well something can be done! In April of 1988 the Senate passed the .State of New York Solid Waste Management Act of 1988. This bill promotes recycling and waste reduction. It states that: 1) by July 1, 1989 all public offices and institutions have to be Nuclear Awareness Day Concludes Pangaea Week· By MICHELLE MERER As SPAA's \Bring Back Pangaea-Peace and Justice Week\ continues, we are concludi11g with a Nuclear A ware ness Day. For those students who found dots in their mailboxes, or are just curious, please read on. If you received .a yellow dot, you represent a survivor. If your dot is red, yo\! represent an injured person, and if you found a black dot, well, yqu represent the many innocent people who would die as a result of a nuclear attack. Come to the table set up in the College Center for further information and statistics. We are in the midst of a nuclear-oriented world. Nuclear power provides approximately 6% of all the energy consumed in the United States, and 60% of the Department of Energy's budget is spent on nuclear power. Nuclear waste complicates the problem, and unfortunately, an appropriate solution has not surfaced as of SCHOlARSHIPS AVAILABLE . 0 Looking for a scholar- ship?

Together, the United States and the Soviet Union possess some 50,000 nuclear warheads. Present nuclear arsenals alone represent over 26,000 times the explosive force of all armaments used in World War II. These are the frightening facts. The message SPAA has attempted to bring to Union College this week is that world peace.~ is possible, Perhaps it begins with feeding the hungry; cleaning up the environment. worldwide justice and equality, or a denuclearlzed world, Whatever it takes, we must redirect our energy and our money to bring about a peaceful world.

.()ONCORDIBNSIS, Octobel' _19, 1989 Page 5 Spontalleity .BY SYBIL ZANGER People are always complaining that there ·is nothing to do. If you think about it yo11 r~ali2:e that there are so many opJJortunities, that trying to ,make a decision is seldom more stressful than doing nothing. The close minded petsonwill sit around· and mull over the lack of options,. and jn tl:te end they will probably end. up staying home. This mulling can carry on for hours upon hours in a never endi~g cycle; As a result, the individqal wa~tes coantless hours that corud have been spent doing something more productive. Unless the insight of an optimist is given, the whole process of 'muUin,g over the lack ofentertaillment that they see will keep them in a never ending rut. MQ:;t people capnot bypass the state of depression until they m;lle a conscious effort to being. optimistic. The adventulous. person, on the other hand, will always ~d up taking a random thought and stretching it until it d~velops into an entertaining event. Whenever the Greek life becomes monotonous or subsides for a little while the adventurer can still create plans, for there are always numerous pOpportuniHe s available on campus ..

CONCORD!ENSIS, October 19, 1989 Page 5 Spontaneity By SYBIL ZANGER Pe<Jple are always complaining that there is nothing to do. If you think about it you realize that there are so many opportunities, that trying to make a decision is seldom more stressful than doing nothing. The close minded person will sit anmnd and mull over the lack .()f options, and in the end they will probably end up staying home. This mulling can C<tl1I'y on for hours upon hours in a never ending cycle. As a result, the individual wastes countless hours that could have been spent doing something more productive. Unless the insight of an optimist is given, the whole process. of mulling over the lack of entertainment that they see will keep them in a never ending rut. Most people cannot bypass the state of depression untH they make a conscious effort to being optimistic. The adventurous person, on the oilier hand, will always end up tak:ing a random thought and stretching it until it develops into an entertaining event. Whenever the Greek life becomes mono~onous or subsides for a Wtle while the adventurer can still create plans, for there are always numerous ,,opportuRities available on campus. Opportunities will always remain abundant if the person is willing to continue trying new things. Even if there is nothing on campus, the adventurer will find something to do anyhow. There are many options off campus for those dulled by on- campus actitivies. Some activities include going to the movies, the malls. local bars, going out to eat, Rupsi's, Brandywine, Gepetto's, Ptoctors, clubs in Albany, going to Ben and Jeny's and even a walk to Price Chopper can provide a good change of atrn()sphere. Basically, if you are determined enough you can always find something to do on or off campus, but is is much better to approach situations with an optimistic attitude than a pessimistic one. A little spontaneity and some positive thinking can make an unbelievable difference. 'llpstjvon DRY RUSH DINNER THURSDAY, OCTOBER19 6:00 p BM.

At the same time they seem to have put an end to the stereotype of a \Russian.\ This year Yuriy and I represent two other national minorities, namely Belorussians and Lithuanians. I know darn we H that these notions make little sense to a person who is not completely absorbed in politics. Therefore, todav, I would like to skip the traditional topic of politics, whkh a Soviet is mostly expected to speak on (questions like, \What do you think of Gorbachev?\ or \Will perestroika succeed?\ and the like). Instead, I would prefer to introduce the readers of The Concordiensis to our cultural background: \Who we are?\ \What we are?\ To be more specific, today I will speak about Lithuania, my university, and its students.

Tl!e population for the last decade ha~ remained approximately 3.5 million, 80% of which are Lithuanians. Recently, Litlmanian was proclaimed the· state language.

Yet the first written evidence of their civilization is of the fifth century B.C. In his work Gerrnania, P.C.

We link the foundation of a Lithuanian state with the Grand Duke Mindaugas who united several principalities into one centralized state in the early 13th centtJry, In the 14th-16th centtJries, Lithuania was very powerful, and its teritories extended from the Baltic to the Black Sea. However, because of the severe attacks by the German Teutonic order, Lithmmia was forced to unite with Poland, thus forming a new Polish-Lithuanian state. The state saw intermingled periods oc! prosperity and decline until in 1795 it was partitioned by Russia, Prussia and Austria. Lithuania was a part of Czarist Russia until World War L In 1918, the National Liberation Movement reached its peak and an independent Lithuanian Republic was proclaimed. We had two decades of peacefu I and laborious life which ended with Soviet occupation, as a result of the Molotov-Ribentrop Pact. Consequences were very painful for my nation, and they still continue to be.

- ~ . . ' . '~ .. ~ CONCORDIENSIS, October 19, 1989 · Pa.ge 7 INTERNATIONAL FEA'TURES The Baltic States A Time For ChaRge By CARL R. FRlEDRICII, JR. The Soviet Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have undergone massive changes since the implementation of Perastrokia and Glasnost, changes which the old guard in the Kremlin might not have anticipated. The three nations, illegally annexed in 1940 in a secret agreement between Hitler and Stalin, have recently placed themselves in the forefront of the protests all over the U.S.S.R., attempting to gain more auto·nomy for themselves, even freedom. The Baltic Republics (the proper name) pose a tricky ·question to ihe Soviet regbne for several reasons. Econ<>m- ically, the Baltics provide ports to Western Europe, supply Russia proper with. a tre- mendou,s supply of dairy products, and stand as both a front door and buffer to surrounding c<>untries (In Estonia alone, over half of the U.S.S.R.'s joint-venture enter- prises with the West have been conceived). Politically, the republics provide an open view to the west. The Sovie.1s might be able to disrupt protests within the interior (such as in Georgia), but cannot act in the same way in the Baltic. Too many interests are repres.ented, and Gorbachev cannot afford to alienate Western opinion. The- leader of the conscripted world finds himself in a catch-22, with th economic vitality of the Republics forcing his hand, but the political situation of the East needing the West preventing him from doing anything.

CONCORDIENSIS, October 19, 1989 Page 7 INTERNATIONAL FEATURES The Balti:c States A Time For Ch1111ge By CARL R. FRIEDRICH, JR. The So\Viet Baltic states of Esto11ia, Latvia, and Lithuania have u11dergone massive changes since the implernen:tation of Perastrokia and Glasnost, changes which the old guard in the Kremlin might not have anticipated. The tltne nations, illegally annexed in 1940 in a secret agreement 'between Hitler and Stalin,. have recently placed themselves in the forefront of the p1:otes ts aU over the U.S.S.R., attempting to gain more autonomy for themselves, even freedom. The Bcdtic Republics (the proper name) pose a tricky questicn to the Soviet reg.ime for several reasons. Econom- ically, the. Baltics provide ports to Western Europe, supply Russia proper with a tre- mcnd<Jus supply of dairy products, and stand as both a front dCJor and buffer to surrounding countries (In Estonia alone, over half of the U .s_s J~.'s joint-venture enter- prises with the West have been concei vecl). Politically, the republics provide Cln open view to the west. rhe Soviets might be able t() disrupt protests within the interior (such as in Geor~ia), but cannot act in the same wa~ in the Baltic. Too many interests are represented, and G<Jrbachev cannot afford to alienate Western opinion. The leader Df the conscripted world finds himself in a catch-22, with tit economic vitality of the Republics forcing his hand, but the political situation of the East needing the West preventing him from doing anything. As far as the Baltic Republics are concerned, the desire for increased economic and political freedom goes beyond the parameters of the words themselves_ The people of the Baltic have never considered themselves Russian, nor hope to. As one columnist adds, over time. the Russians thought that they (the Baltic states) would 'feel' Soviet (U.S. News and World Report, Apr. 3, 1989). This theory could not be more false, and in a land where national flags, songs, and stories of the old days with free market still abound, (also the region of the U.S.S.R. with the highest literacy rate and contact wi:th the West), the people are not going to be stepped on anymore. A Nation a I Geographic writer sums thesentiment up best-- \M oscow may have underestimated the impact of offering such people free speech\ (NG, May, 1989).

~-- Founded at Un·ion College 1877 --~ Get Ready ·For An Optimistic Aiu1Tlnus Change While Union claims to. be an institution of higher education, it seems that the atmosphere here tends to hinder the expansion of our minds. We are not only to learn from our professors and the courses they teach, but also from living environs, social interaction, and diversity. The most educational topic this term seems to be homosexuality. Students and faculty ·alike are confronting their own personal feelings on this issue. It is imperative that we confront those issues which we do not understand. We must learn about and appreciate those issues as Unio:p. is to train us to do. fssues as shocking and disruptive as homosexuality is to Union are ever present outside our encapsulated community. To the Union Coll~ge Cominunity: · Thank you for a wonderful Homecoming! Interesting far me to come back as a recent graduate-- Same school?? I don't know ... a perusal-through the campus news had seeds of optimism mixed with familiar disappointments. Overall, it appears as though .the \good 'ole U\ is ripe for a change. What caught my eye as a particularly th.oughtul gesture, did so because it hit close to · ' ·~horne\. As many new alumnus, I've moved out to test the waters far fi'om home. As a newly established graduate student at the University of South Carolina, I had the unique chance to experience my fint natural disaster with Hurricane Hugo. Thoagh escaping relatively unsc.athed, my sympathy understandably goes out to the thousands around me who were devastated in many ways by the storm; Seizing the oppmtunity to return for Homecoming in the great northeast, I was touched by the efforts of people in the capital district, a thousand miles away,. to ~se the pain of South Carolinians rcovering from their loss. The ad in The · Concordiensis (Oct. .,s. 1989, on Page 10) gave Students and the FeSt of the campus community a con- structive way to help in this massive relief effort. I don't know how it got there, but as a ''displaced\ dutchman far away, it's wonderful to see an awareness in .the world beyond Schenectady. You may\ not know who you're helping, but they'll never forget the impression yoa have left behind. Which, can't help but bring me back, in closing, to the editorial pages of the campus newsletter, and the. \familiar disappointments\. The issues you're confronti11g on campus-- . they go beyond your -specific incidents. These actions should raise questions about the motivation behind what is occurring on cam.pus. for those of you quick to write off inappropriate behavior by fellow students. Is there respect for one another2 The messages behind your actions; whether they address racism, safety, or personal respect fo:r human being:;, illuniinates an ·attitude that shou:ld upset you. Why? Because not. only does it effect you. -on campus,. 'but it effects you off campus as well. The attitudes displayed effect the alumni, anQ; even prospective students. The reason you should be concerned with the s~me displays of close- mindedness. and humiliation of one another, js that the .. motivation signifies the accepted, or - at least the tolerated. belief system of our campus. Beliefs .of racism, sexism, personal violation, vandalism, and careLess disregard for one another aren't making Union be what it has .. the potential to become. So \ many things to be proud: of, and yet things· .still need to change. I hope some of these things can stay back with ' 1 The ·Way We Were, and the positives; our opening awareness of ourselves, and an increasing tolerance and acceptance of one another can · be part of \The Way We'll Be\. Sincerely,· Donna L. Lanzendo:tf This small liberaL arts college strives to be like those more prestigious colleges and universities that make up.the Ivy League. Yet, unlike these institutions, Union fails to educate us thoroughly about life. Brown, Harvard, and Stanford, to name a few, have gay and lesbian societies. Prior to this year, Union had no such representation. Now with the formation of Union's gay and lesbian society (and let's face it, there is one), we are coming closer to being truly an institution of higher education worthy of that label. Cheerleaders Deemed ''Unimportant'' · The controversies surrounding this issue have brought us to a degree of thought, but perhaps not to the degree we w·ould prefer. The respectable reaction would be that of an open minded nature. This is not to say that controversy over this issue is wrong or should be waylaid, but the issue should be confronted from an objective point of view. Students at Union should feel comfortable expressing their opinions and individuality. However, students are afraid to express their true selves because Union is not yet, in fact, ready to receive such a large dose of change at once. Those homosexuals who choose to remain anonymous realize that the initial introduction of homosexuality to Union is the first step of many towards achieving any change. Slow that it may be, for now, anonymity is the best possible method. To avoid going into shock, one eases oneself into a cold, unreceptive ocean. It will take time for this college community to. be receptive of such, or any, diversity. But the time is now for us to become conscious of social, intellectual and personal diversity. Society· outside of Union is surpassing us · quickly on such matters as we continue in our · egocentric rut. The \everyone should be like me\ mentality found at Union is not realistic; homogeneity is stagnating. Positive change cannot and will not result as long as change is feared. It is not something to fear. What people fear the most is the unknown. At Union much of society's regularities are- unknown to us. They will be there when we leave Union's grounds. Why not face them now? To the Editor: We, the Union College Cheerleaders, would like to. apologize for our inability to support the team in our usual manner. Due to a limitation in space, we were unable to cheer at the Union/ RPI game Saturday, October 14, 1989.

It is imperative that we confront those issues which we do not understand. We must learn about and appreciate those issues as Union is to train us to do. Issues as shocking and disruptive as homosexuality is to Union are ever present outside our encapsulated community. This small liberal arts college strives to be like those more prestigious colleges and universities that make up the Ivy League. Yet, unlike these institutions, Union fails to educate us thoroughly about life. Brown, Harvard, and Stanford, to name a few, have gay and lesbian societies. Prior to this year, Union had no such representation. Now with the formation of Union's gay and lesbian society (and let's face it, there is one), we are coming closer to being truly an institution of higher education worthy of that label. The controversies surrounding this issue have brought us to a degree of thought, but perhaps not to the degree we would prefer. The respectable reaction would be that of an open minded nature. This is not to say that controversy over this issue is wrong or should be waylaid, but the issue should be confronted from an objective point of view. Students at Union should feel comfortable expressing their opinions and individuality. However, students are afraid to express their true selves because Union is not yet, in fact, ready to receive such a large dose of change at once. Those homosexuals· who choose to remain anonymous realize that the initial introduction of homosexuality to Union is the first step of many towards achieving any change. Slow that it may be, for now, anonymity is the best possible method. To avoid going into shock, one eases oneself into a cold, unreceptive ocean. It will take time for this college com~munity to be receptive of such, or any, diversity. But the time is now for us to become conscious of social, intellectual and personal diversity. Society outside of Union is surpassing us quickly on such matters as we continue in our egocentric rut. The \everyone should be like me\ mentality found at Union is not realistic; homogeneity is stagnating. Positive change cannot and will not result as. long as change is feared. It is not something to fear. What people fear the most is the unknown. At Union much of society's regularities are unknown to us. They will be there when we leave Union's grounds. Why not face them now? LETTERS An Optimistic Alumnus To the Union College Community: Thank you for a wonderful Homecoming! Interesting for me to come back as a recent graduate-- Same school?? I don't know ... a perusal through the ·campus news had seeds of optimism mixed with familiar disappointments. Overall, it appears as though the \good 'ole U\ is ripe for a change. What caught my eye as a particularly thoughtul gesture, did so because it hit dose to \h II A . ome . s many new alumnus, I've moved out to test the waters far from home. As a newly established graduate student at the University of South Carolina, I had the unique chance to experience my first natural disaster with Hurricane Hugo. Though escaping relatively unscathed, my sympathy understandably goes out to the thousands around me who were devastated in many ways by the storm. Seizing the opportunity to return for Homecoming in the great northeast, I was touched by the efforts of people in the capital district, a thousand miles away, to ease the pain of South Carolinians rcovering from their loss. The ad in The · C()ltcordiensis (Oct. 5, 1989, on Page 10) gave students and the rest of the campus community a con- structive way to help in this massive relief effort. I don't know how it got there, but as a \displaced\ dutchman far away. it's wonderful to see an awareness in the world beyond Scbenectady. You may not know who you're helping, but they'll never forget the impression you have left behind. Which, can't help but bring me back, in closing, to the editorial pages of the campus newsletter, and the \familiar disappointments\. The issues you•Je confronting on campus-- they go beyond your specific incidents. These actions should raise questions about the motivation behind what is occurring on campus, for those of you quick to write off inappropriate behavior by fellow students. Is there respect for one another? The messages behind your actions; whether they address racism, safety, or personal r.espect for human beings, illuminates an attitude that should upset you. Why? Because not only does it effect you on campus, but it effects you off campus as well. The attitudes displayed effect the alumni, and even prospective students. The reason you should be concerned with the s~me displays of close- mindedness and humiliation of one another, is that the motivation signifies the accepted, 01 at least the tolerated, belief system of our campus. BeHefs of racism • sexism, personal violation, vandalism, and careless disregard for one another aren't making Union be what it has the potential to become. So many things to be proud of, and yet things still need to change. I hope some of these things can stay back with \The Way We Were, and the positives; our opening awareness of ourselves, and an increasing tolerance and acceptance of one another can be part of \The Way We'll Be\. Sincerely. Donna L. Lanzendotf Cheerleaders Deemed \Unimportant\ To the Editor: We, the Union College Cheerleaders, would like to apologize for our inability to support the team in our usual manner.

CONCORDIENSIS, October 19,. 1~89 Page 11 LETTERS .,,------------------------------------------~~~==~===== ·Diversity N~eds No Solution >' To the Editor: This is in response to Mr. Friedrich's letter. which appeared in the 12 October Issue of Concordiensis. While I fmd certain sections of the letter obscure (\ ... but one - ., cannot expect to even begin to consider the legitimacy of a conspiracy.\) the overall thrust of the article is clear. Mr. Friedrich is unhappy with the presence of gay men and women on his campus. He seems concerned that hgmosexuality is a disease, and wishes that a \suitable solution\ may be found. I-fegret to inform Mr. Friedrich that there is likely no solution. What he is complaining about is one aspect of human diversity. One may or may not view it as a .particularly attractive aspect, but. then, on~ might not be too happy with Mr. Friedrich's eye C()lor or .personal behavior, either. Perhaps the rest of the world has \come somewhere\ in the last few thousand years, but, if it h<ts, this is not particularly reflected in the sexual behavior of \normal\ Union College students, nor their \normal\ compatriots in the surrounding community. I would Hke to remind Mr. Friedrich that, as far as I am aware, rape in this area seems to be an activity engaged in by singularly \normal\ people. Sincerely, Andrew Marchant ShapirO Visiting Instructor Sociology and Political Science Don't Deny Freedom of Choice To the Editor: Attirudes Add Anonymity To tile Editor: 1be letter to the editor in last wee-k's Con c or die n s i!! \'C{)ming Out' Anonymously\' (Oct. 12, 1989) explained fai more than I suspect its autl'lor intended it to. His letter .concerned the anonymity of homosexuals at Union, fee1i11g that their reluctance to identif:y theooselve.s stemmed from a \realization of what they are - · ab11ormal.\ I would like to correct the author by pointhng out that it is not a realizati<lll that keeps them from statin!J their names, but ratlle.r attitudes like his. They are not afr<tid of what they feel, pllt rather of what we heterosexuals will do because they are different By making homosexuals afraid ·of persecution, we are making the difference between being homosexual and heterosexual all the more apparent. If we downplay the difference, and allow each to live his life as he pleases, an area of strife will be eliminated, benefitting all. Remember, \a man's right to swing his fist stops at the nose of another.\ Simply put, a man has the right to do whatever he wants, until it infringes upon the rights of another. As a homosexual lives his life, if he does not actively infringe 11pon my rights ( a person's outrage at the \unnatural\ act is not considered an active infringement upon these rights), he is well within his rights to live in any manner that he pleases. By the same reasoning, we have no right to try to force our \proper\ heterosexual views on others, as we arc then infringing on their personal rights. As long as he docs not harm me or actively try to convert me, and I do not harm him or actively try to convert him, we can live in peace. Sincerely, Deb Atwo<Jd '90 A Union Education To the Editor: It was .amusing to read Carl Friedrich, Jr.'s mindlessly anti- gay letter in the October 12 iss11e, and then to reflect tllat this was the same Carl Friedrich who had delivered such a: splendidly incoherEnt defense (what is a \Williams' liberal syndrome 1 \.?) of the fraternity system tile week before. What a perfect ntHtured by Greek organizations lt..t their worst though not always or necessarily so. inconsistent with everything an institution of higher ed11cation must stand for. And speaking to you personally, Carl, l hope that by June 1991 Union has succeeded in beginning to educate you; i.e., succeeded in causing you to beg in to question your received ideas and prejudices. Sincerely. This letter is. in response ~o Mr. Friedrich's letter regarding the homosexual population at Union College published in the October 12. 1989, edition of the Concordiensis. Mr. Friedrich believes that homosexuals are \sick\ and should be helped. We would like :Mr. Friedrich to know that support to those individuals on campus who had the strength to overcome attitudes similar to Mr. Friedrich's, thus creating a peer group. Hopefully~ with the formation of this group, Union will continue to strive to ·allow the practice of individual choice witbout the condemnations voiced-by Mr. Friedrich.

The autncr certainly doesn't debate a person's right to play video games, so she must be wondering why people like m)'self play them. Ulllfortunately, it seems no o11e has explained to the author the benefits which accrue to those who play these coin-operated marvels. Allow me. First of all, video games are a great way to pass time between classes, since it rarely takes me 20 minutes to buy a newspaper and get a drink. Second, it's impossible to get a table in the College Center between classes, so if I'm standing up, I might as well play. Third, video game playing dramatically increases hand- eye coordination (flight simulators used extensively by civilian airlines and the military are very sophisticated video games). Finally, playing these games is fun: try it sometime. I probably could have written a negative, insulting, angry letter, but who would benefit from that? By the way, Jen: if you like, I'll teach you to play Arkanoid. Once you g.et the hang of it, I bet you'll like it.

AZT, costing upwards of $8,000 per year, blocks the AIDS virus from reproducing; this gives the body's immt1ne system time to replenish seme of its defenders agai11st the disease, called helper T cells_ A i recent study finds that 600~000 people might heneflt from treatment Nobel Prizes Awarded The Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics V!ere recently awarded. 1'wo Americans, Thomas Cech of the University of Colorado and Sidney Altman of Yale, snared the chemistry prize. Eoth independently made the discovery that RNA is not only a passive carrier 'of gmetic information,. but that it actively aids chemical reaction in cells. One physic~ prize went to Norman Ramsey of Harvard for his W()rk in developing the atomic doo\ a device used to meas11re the vibrations of atoms to create a . . I J time st~ndard. A physics prize also went to Hans Dehmelt of the University of Washington and Wolfgang Paul of the University of Bonn for development of methods to isolate atoms and subatomic particles for study. Both prizes carry an award of about $470,000. Ulcer Causing Contacts Two studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine report that people who use extended-we;tr contact lenses dramatically increase their chances of contracting a corneal ulcer. The chance is especially high among those Who sleep with their lenses in. A corneal ulcer is a severe infection which can cause permanent eye damage or even lead to blindness. The incidence of infection among extended- wear lens users is five times greater than that among daily- wear users. Those who wear lenses while sleeping are 10 to 15 times more likely to suffer from the condition. The infection is preventable through daily cleaning. Extended-wear users are now advised not to leave lenses in for more than seven consecutive days. Nourishing-- Sludge? Scientists from Woods Hole, Massachusetts, have reported finding a seabed richly populated with tiny plants and marine animals at the exact site in the ocean where New York and New Jersey have been dumping their sewage sludge forover two years. Researchers discovered a wide variety of life, including fish, shrimp, -crabs, sea cu.:umbers, anemones, and other .small marine organisms during a tO- day survey at the si~e. The discovery of life in an area many feared dead raises questions about a national policy to han ocean dumping of sludge by the end of 1991. The aim of the policy is to protectthe marine environment from contamination, but it shifts the risks of disposal to land. The researchers have not yet completed tests to determine whether the plants and animals at the site are contaminated with bacteria, viruses, or other indu.s trial wastes. To Jupiter with Galileo The Galileo space probe was set to be launched this week on its jouruey to the planet Jupiter. The space shuttle Atl.antis will carry the three-ton robot spacecraft into orbit. The mission will make use of the gravitational fields of other planets and moons to accelerate and maneuver the craft through space. The probe will first travel to Venus. It will then circle back to use the gravitational fieJd of Earth to pick up speed. The craft is scheduled to pass Earth one~ more in 1992. Galileo is tentatively set to arrive at Jupiter at the end of 1995. Sometimes~ are what you d6ltt eat 16. Don't eat a thing on the Thursday before Thanksgiving.

CONCORDIENSIS, Oct(Jlfler 19, 1989 Page 17 ARrfS & ENTERTAINMENT Kit's Corner: William Hathaway Reads His Poetry By. THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENT On October 10, a portion of the Union College students; and faculty were treated to a poetry reading .by English professor William· Hath~way, affectionally called \Kit\, at the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity house. Hatfiaway, a visiting associate professor for six years at Union, touched the evening off on a light note with his anecdote of how he practices reading his poetry in the :company of his \deaf' dog,. He said the only way he cowl(! get his dog to listen was to tempt her with a sandwich. Such humble perscnal stories proved to be an impressionistic backdrop to · his salty interjections of bitter reali1ies: ''if women were only nicer ... ''. Kit's trenchant sarcasm could not uproot the comf.ortaMe fireside atmosphere, because his sarcasm would always give way to trenchant wit. As in his poem about \Bobby Zimmerman\ better known as Bob Dylan~ sarcasm abounded; but humor :broke through in this poem about the illusory vision of life during the 1960's o:rt the west coast beaches where he met Dylan. , -Much less cynical was his pc:>em about his adolescent years in Oneida, New York: \Spit\. Professor Hathaway's imagecy was that of a comical Norman Rockwell: dusty streets, the tovm keystone cop, and the young boys hanging around the Navy recruiting office until they we~e ·old enough to enlist. What bonds Hatllaway's poetry together is his incorporation of bitter realism with subtle humor of life's idiosyncrasies. Altltough he was toQ cool to attend his senior prom, or to llike the Eiffel Tower during the year he spent in France, the a11dience of students and faculty were elated that he was not too cool to give a reading at a fraternity. Hathaway has had five books of poetry published, and hopefully in the f11tute more events like this one will take place on our college campus, Such integration proQvides a rapport between .students and faculty which has b~en remiss during these past few:~ears. ~- - - - .- .._ ._ - ...

CONCORDJENSlS, October 19, 1989 Page 23 SPORTS Ryan Mason Gains.129 Yards and Scores 2 TDS in Win Over _RPI By MARK T. ZIMM,ERMAN Sports Editor This week's Athlete of the Week is senior tailback Ryan Mason. He carried tlle ball 15 times in Union's 28-3 victory over RPI, gained 129 yards, an average of 8.6 yards per carry, and he scored two touchdowns. Fot his efforts, he was also voted the eastern College Athletic Conference's Upstate new York \Qffensie Player of .... the week.\ Mason, in his fourth year on the team and one of the team's tri-captains, has already run for 627 yards on 110 carries this season for a 5:.7 y~rd avemge.He is averaging 104.5 yards :per game this year; In his career, he has gained 1,572 yards and scored l3 touchdowns, four of them coming this year. With Mason in tbe backfield, defenses are forced tQ concentrate on him, giving Union the opportunity to use other facets of its offense .. When Mason does get the ball, hovvever, he makes the most of it. Only two of his 110 .carries tllis season have resulted in losses, for a total of merely tWo yards. Against RPI, he scored Union's third touchdown ·Of the first half on a two-yard run. Earlier in the drive, he gained 12 pnd 15 yards on two key third down conversions. His number was also called in the third quatte'r, with the score 21- 3. Mason took the baH on the Union 42 yarci line, ran .straight through tne defense, . and simply outran every defender enroute to scoring a 58 yard touchdown which capped Union's scoring. With Mas(}n in the Union backfield, the Dutchmen are a constant tlue~t on the ground. M - ·• s · w· . ens occer .. 1ns Third Straight By RON BIRNBAUM T~e Union Varsity hooters· notched two more wins at away games this past week. increasing their winning streak to three. Their league record is now 3-6-1. While RPI, whom the squad contended with this past Saturday, was ranked in the state, it was Siena that proved to be the . greater challenge. At Siena 1 ·aggression and all- around good play prevented the Saints from scoring. With only 5 minutes left in the second half, sophomore Jem Sollinger was able to bend a free kick inte the upper right comer of the net from 18 yards out. The unassisted goal gave Union a 1-0 lead which they maintained for the remaining few minutes of tile game. While .the Union forwards gave the team greater opiJortunity to put the ball into the net than in previous games, the rnidfielders and defenders warked consistently with goalkeeper Paul Viviano to get the aecessary saves. RPI, which was a generally weak team; . allowed the D11tchmen to earn another 1-0 sh11tout. Good combination passing from the fullbacks to the rnidflelders to the forwards resulted in a first-half goal. After Solinger crossed a kick, SO]lhomore Adam Epstein received the ball on the far side an;d cross-headed a snot into net,. giving the team a well de-served win. Excellent go.altending by Viviano was vi~l and the defense was led by sophomore Don Hodson and junior Eric Reaman. The team faces a tough upcoming scl1edule, with many of the upcoming competitors to be faced ranked on the state, regional. or national level. The-· final four opponents--RIT, North Adamg, Clarkson, and St. Lawrence--are all to be played at home, with the next game to be played this Saturday, Oct. 21 at 2:00 pm against RIT. According to freshman forward Dave Romeo,. \The· record s)lows we've improved much, but the real test is going t<> be RIT.\ With continued aggression, intelligent play, and strong fan support, tile D11tchmen should, be able to .put up a strong effort.

Rest in Peace, Mr. Pocldington. Tune in to 89.7, The Dutchmen Sports Network, f~r all the football games. Mouthing Off By ANDY RRA VER I feel for some .people. They have all had busy weeks--some . had good ones, and others want · . to forget and roll back the hands of time. Poor Pete Rozeiie. He has been - Commissioner of the National Football League for almost 30 years, and last spring he announced to the football world, and the owners in .particular, that he was going to retire. But out of courtesy and loyalty, he agreed to stay on as commissioner until a successor was found. That was over six months ago. It is now October 19, and there is no sign that the NFL owners will agree on a new commissioner before the year is out. On July 19, Jim Finks, General Manager of the New Orleans Saints, received 16 out of the 19 votes necessary for a commissioner to be elected. The 'New Guard's' selection process did not give them a choice, but rather presented a candidate whom the 'Old Guard' wanted to elect by acclimation. To rectify this situation, the . 'New Gu::u-d' found a candidate of their own, New York State Republican Party Chairman Paul Taglibue. Last week, the owners met in Dallas to try to reconcile their differences and go home with a new leader. Instead, they ended up with a draw, with 13 votes for both Finks and Taglibue. Poor Pete Rozelle. He wants to get out of the game, and the owners won't let him because they are too busy bickering among themselves. If they have any sense of gratitude for what this man has given the game of football (and how much money he has made for each and every one of them), in their meeting in Clevland next week they should vote in a third candidate, a man like Hall of Fame quarterback Jack Kemp (currently Secretary of Housing and Urban Development), and give Pete Rozelle the freedom that he so greatly deserves. Poor Joe Walton. From the day he took the job as Head Coach of the New York Jets, Walton has taken heat from fans as well as the media. He has withstood the endles chants .of 'Joe must go, Joe must go!!!' from the unruly fans in Shea Stadium and now in Giants Stadium. Walton has stuck it out. But why? He is coaching a mediocre team, and with a personnel director like Mike Hickey, he will never coach a very good team. Isn't a first round draft pick of Ron Faurot (Who?!) enough evidence. So, Joe, for your own sake, GO. Poor Gordie Howe. He played professional hockey for 26 seasons and scored 1,850 points. Wayne Gretzky, in 10 seasons, broke Gordie's record. It kind of makes one wonder why Gordie scored so 'few' points in so many years, or how Gretzky scored so many so quickly. One main reaso11 is Jarri Kurri. Tnis Edmonton Oilers winger was responsible in some way for over 650 of Gretzky's \'points. Remarkable. Now if Gordie played witll a Kurri, or a Messier, or a Coffey, or a ..... , he might have scored an extra goal or two. And another thing--let's see Gretzky play hockey for 26 years, or just until the age of 51. Poor Dave Manson. This Chicago Black Hawk Defenseman was suspended for three games after pushing/hitting linesman Ron Asselstine during a fight with New York Ranger Chris Nilan. Come on Dave. If you are going to hit a ref and .get suspended, really hit him and make it worth your while. Lastly, poor Jerry Jo11es. What else is there to say but last'? He bought a bad football team and, witn the help of friend and coach Jimmy Johnson, has turned this once proud franchise into the laughing stock of football, if not all professional sports (excluding the LA Clippers). On the other end of the spectrum, a few men deserve some congratulations. So: Congratulations Wayne Gretzky. He broke Gordie's record, and even if he did play with a team of superstars for 9 years, he is sti 11 and always will be 'The Great One.' Congratulations Bo Jackson. After hitting 32 home rum for the Kansas City Royals, Bo returned to his summer home to gain 75 yards on 11 carries as a Los Angeles Raider tltis past Sunday. Bo, you know everything. Congratulations Herschel Walker. He had some week. After spending five brutal weeks on the sidelines next to Jerry Jones, this Bulldog was traded to the Minnesota Vikings for five players and seven conditional draft choices. He was wanted, and he got his money's worth in the shape of a reported $1.25 million bonus just to accept the trade, as well as a Mercedes, a house, and oth~r prizes that would make even Pat Sajak jealous. 011, I almost forgot--Herschel gained 147 yards for the Vikings in their win over Green Bay on Sunday. Not bad for one day of . . h?t? practice, e ... Congratulations Matio Lemieux. After signing his 5 year, $12 million contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins this past summer, Mario finally was able to purch~se his dream car, a Ferrari. I hope he doesn't ask Jose Canseco for driving lessons! And lastly, congratulations to the Orlando Magic. This NBA expansion team won their first pre-season game last week. Just think, it took the Miami Heat almost two m<>nths to win a game last yeat. -

Terri Thomas passes the ball off against Plattsburgh. The women's soccer team lost 3·1. Ryan Mason runs · up the middle- en route to a $B-yard touchdown against RPI. ·The team remained undefeated. Men's X-C ·Falls to RPI By CCM Q: Do double practices affect perfonnance? A: RPI 18; Union 43 On a beautiful Friday afternoon, the Running Dutch- men travelled to Saratoga State Park with the intent of improving on their .500 record. This would prove to be no simple task. Tile fatigue from two weeks of double practices, coupled with the strength of the RPI squad, was too much for the team to overcome. The Joss closed out the Dutchmen's dual meet season at 1-2. RPI controlled the tempo of the race from the start using a group running technique perfectly, a formula the Dutchmen have been searching for all season. The Engineers held the first 10 positions at the mile and from that point they never looked back, finishing with 13 of the top 16 places. Despite the numbers, the Dutchmen ran particularly well for this point in the season. With the focus being on the Championships. the team went through a two week conditioning period in order to peak at the end of the season. The team continued its penchant for S·trong front · ' '· < -F:riday, · JV Sr>oea:rvs RP~ ·- · · running with Jon Rosenfeld (4th) and Co-Capt. Mike Martinez (6th) finishing with times. of 28:39 and 28:59 respectively. A bi~ gap separated Union's other top finishers; Greg Barrett (12th- 30:29), Co-Capt. Doug Martocci (16th-31:ll), Rich Zembek ( 17th-31: 34), John Learned (18th-31:58)~ and Bob Townsend (19th-32:()5). Union's highlight of the day came in the JV race, held earlier that day, also in Saratoga State Park. Junior transfer, Jon Dubow, finished first with a time of 31:22. This was a big confidence boost for Jon and was the thud year in a row that a Uni<>n runner finished firSt in that mce. Coming up for the Running Dutchmen is the Albany State Invy, which marks the beginning of the post season. Still remaining for the Union squad are the Conference Finals, State meet, and the NCAA Qualifiers. According to coach Dave Herrington, all of Union's work will begin to pay off in these meets. The doubles may have affected Union's performance this week, but when all of the other teams begin to slow down, Union will just be getting warmed up! . . ' . .

Dutchmen Claim Sho·es:: Travel to Coas,t By ANDREW SEEWALD Last Saturday afternoon at '86 Field, the Dutchmen spoiled RPI':s Homecoming, gained a measure of revenge, and held an opponent to 7 or fewer points f()r the fourth time in six games. For their efforts, which resulted in a rousing 28- 6 victory over the rival Engineers, the Dutchmen were awarded with the \Dutchmen Shoes.\ The trophy is presented annually to the winner of the Union-RPI game. A large crowd in Troy~ including a substantial contingent of Union faithful, saw the Dutchmen improve to 6-0 on the season. Union has won eight consecutive games dating back to last season. The last team to beat the Dutchmen is Coast Guard, and Union will have a chance to avenge that 17-10 defe-at in Schenectady when the team travels to New London, Connecticut to meet the Bears this weekend. Senior tailback Ryan Mason led the attack against RPI as he rushed for 129 yards on 15 carries. Mason, who also rushed for two touchdowns, was voted the Eastern College Athletic Conference's Upstate New York \Offensive Player of the Week.\ Mason had 45 yards on the first Union possession of the game. With a light rain falling, the Dutchmen kept the ball mostly on the ground behind an offensive line that was typicaliy overpowering. On first and goal at the Engineer's 7, sophomore Vladimar Telamaque spelled Mason, a switch that spelled trouble for the RPI defense. Telamaque dashed over the rigbt side for his first of two touchdowns in the game and, after Scott Goodwin's extra point, a 7 \0 Dutchmen lead. - RPI's ftrs t possession ended when David Healy recovered a fumble at the Engineer 45. Telamaque wasted no time getting the ball back into the end zone. This time, he took a screen pass from sophomore quarterback Brett Russ and sprinted up the sidelines for bis fourth touchdown .of the year. With the Dutchmen out front 14-0, it looked like a re.,run of last year's game at Frank Bailey Field when Union celebrated its own Homecoming by whipping the Engineers 27-0. However, the Dutchmen were looking to avenge a surprising loss two years ago in Troy ~ter which the scoreboard displayed the final tally for one week after the game. That game two years ago might have been in the back of the players' minds, but there were certainly more tangible factors at work .. The Union defense held RPI to 254 total yards, an average gain of just 3.5 yards per play. (Union averaged 5.2 yards per play.) Mason burst through a spacious gap opened by the line and proceeded to run over several ·ambitious but ·exasperated defenders. Saturday's game was another step in the continuing display of defensive dominance by th:e Dutchmen. The defense has held the opposition to less than 240 total yards per game, or almost 150 yards less than the Union offense averages. Dutchmen opponents are averaging 9.5 points per game, and have scored only 18 points in the first half all season long. RPt W<>uld not score at all in the first half. The Dutchmen built a 21-0 halftime lead on Mason's frrst of two scores, a 2 yard touchdown plunge. The score was s.etup by a spectacular punt retum of 50 yar.ds · by sophomore Mark Tullman. The Engineers finally got on the bo!ll'd· when their first possession of the second half resulted in a 2.6 yard field goal. But Mason's second score of the day would epit<>mize the day and the season for both the senior tailback and for the Dutchmen. On a third and four from the Union 42, Mason burst through a sp!lcious gap opened by the line and proceeded to tun over several ambitious but exasperated defenders. *** Some individual standouts for the Dutchmen: Pat Ahearn caught four passes f0o:r· 55 yarCis. Ahearn remains tbe team's _ leading receiver and now has 21 receptions f~r 293 yards ...

A: RPI 18; Union 43 On a beautiful Friday afterno•Jn, the Running Dutch- men travelled to Saratoga State Park with the intent of improving on their .500 record. This would prove to be no simple task. The fatigue from two weeks of double practices, coupled with the strength of the RPI squad, was too much for the team to overcome. The loss closed out the Dutchmen's dual meet season at 1-2. RPI controlled the tempo of the race from the start using a group running technique perfectly, a formula the Dutchmen have been searching for all season. The Engineers held the first 10 positions at the mile and from that point they never looked back, finishing with 13 of the top 16 places. Despite the numbers, the Dutchmen ran particularly well for this point in the season. With the focus being on the Championships, the team went through a two week conditioning period in order to peak at the end of the season. The team continued its penchant for strong front running with Jon Rosenfeld (4th) and Co-Capt. Mike Mat1inez (6th) finishing with times of 28:39 and 28:59 respectively. A big gap separated Union's other top finishers; Greg BarTett (12th- 30:29), Co-Capt. Doug Martocci (16th-31: 11), Rich Zembek (17th-31:34), John Learned (18th-31:58), and Bob Townsend (19th-32:05). Union's highlight of the day came in the JV race, held earlier that day, also in Saratoga State Park. Junior transfer, Jon Dubow, finished frrst with a time of 31 :22. This was a big confidence boost for Jon and was the third year in a row that a Union runner finished first in that race. Corning up for the Running Dutchmen is the Albany State Invy, which marks the beginning of the post season. Still remaining for the Union squad are the Conference Finals, State meet, and the NCAA Qualifiers. According to coach Dave Herrington, all of Union's work will begin to pay off in these meets. The doubles may have affected Union's performance this week, but when all of the other teams begin to slow down, Union will just be getting warmed up!

For their effoits, which resulted in a rousing 28· 6 victory over the rival Engineers, the Dutchmen were awarded with the \Dutchmen Shoes.\ The trophy is presented annaally to the winner of the Union-RPI game. A large crowd in Troy, including a substantial contingent of Union faithful, saw the Dutchmen improve to 6-0 on the season. Union has won eight consecutive games dating back to last season_ 'The last team to beat the Dutchmen is Coast Guard, and Union wi11 have a chance to avenge that 17-10 defeat in Schenectady when the team travels to N'ew London, Connecticut to meet the Bears this weekend. Senior tailback Ryan Mason led the attack against RPI as he rushed for 129 yards on 15 carries. Mason, who also rushed for two touchdowns, was voted the Eastern College Athletic Conference's Upstate New York \Offensive Player of the Week.\ Mason had 45 yards on the first Union possession of the game. With a light rain falling, the Dutchmen kept the ball mostly on the ground behind an offensive line that was typically overpowering. On first and goal at the Engineer's 7, sophomore Vladirnar Telamaque spelled Mason, a switch that spelled trouble for the RPI defense. Telamaque dashed over the right side for his first of two touchdowns in the game and, after Soott Goodwin's extra point, a 7-0 Dutchmen lead. RPI's first possession ended when David Healy recovered a fumble at the Engineer 45. Telamaque wasted no time getting the ball back intu tile end zone. This time, he to()k a screen pass from sophomore quarterback Brett Russ and sprinted up the sidelines for his fourth touchdown of the year. With the Dutchmen out front 14-0, it looked like a re-run of last year's game at Frank Bailey Field when Union celebrated its own H0mecoming by whipping the Engineers 27-0. However, the Dutchmen were looking to avenge a surprising loss two years ago in Troy after which the scoreboard displayed the final tally for one week after the game. That game two years ago might have been in the back of the players' minds, but there were certainly more tangible factors at work. The Union defense held RPI to 254 total yards, an average gain of just 3 5 yards per play. (Union averaged 5.2 yards per play.) Mason burst through a spacious gap op-ened by the line and proceeded to run over several ambitious but e:x~sperated defenders. Saturday's game was another step in the continuing display of defensive dominance by the Dutcl1men. The defense has held the opposition to less than 240 total yards per game, or almost 150 yards less than the Union offense averages. Du:tchmen opponents are averaging 9.5 points per game, a11d have scored only 18 points in the first half all season long. RPI would not score at all in the first half. The Dutchmen built a 21-0 halftime lead on Mason's first of two scores, a 2 yard touchdown plunge. The score was setup by a spectacular punt return of 50 yards· by sophomore Mark Tullman. The Engineers finally got on the board when their first possession of the second half resulted in a 26 yard field goal. But Mason's second score of the day would epitomize the day and the season for both the senior tailback and for the Dutchmen. On a third and four from the Union 42, Mason burst through a spacious gap opened by the line and proceeded to run over several ambitious but exasperated defenders. * * * Some individual standouts for the Dutchmen: Pat Ahearn caught four passes for·ss yards. Ahearn remains the team's leading receiver and now has 21 receptions for 293 yards ... Defensively, Bob Anderson finished with three solo tackles, nine assists, two pass breakups, and a fumble recovery. Bill Deakins had six solos and seven assists. Greg Hallas had three solos, four assists, and a sack. Thorn McMahon, who continues to lead the team in tackles, had two solos and seven assists. Coast Guard is 4-2, and is currently on a three game winning streak. RPI is the one common opponents between the two clubs. Coast Guard also topped the Engineers, but by an unimpressive 14-10 score. However, that was early in the season, and the Bears have gotten healthy since. The Union-Coast Guard series began in 1984 with a 27- 10 Dutchmen victory, the first of three straight wins for the Dutchmen. The Bears have captured the last two games, including the 17-10 win at Frank Bailey Field 1st year. The Dutchmen should move up in the polls this week from the third spot they occupied in two of the three rankings going into last weekend. Wagner, which was ranked first in the Lambert!Meadowlands Poll and the SportsChannel Poll, fell to Hofstra, 42-24. With its 24-6 win over Albany State, Cortland should move into the top spot in those polls, in addition to retaining its top position in the Upstate New York Poll.

The bill requires the deficit to be under $140 million. The government will not be able to do it, I'm afraid to say. Much of the deficit can be attributed to the \War On Drugs. 11 The war can finance itself with some ingenuity. In fact, under my plan, the war will finance the entire They're Just Not Funny Anymore By CARL R. FRIEDRICH, JR. One of my .sisters was recently playing with my young nephew. She ran into a roadblock when she was asked to describe what a pteradactyl was. Puzzled as to how to describe it, she quickly blurted out that it was a 'monster,' to which my nephew screamed hysterically. You see, he was recently horrified by a Ghostbuster's cartoon. Today's children are continfially exposed to negative images in all situations, but to me what appears odd is that in an area where children are supposed to be nurtured (in the hope that they will stay away from the evils of society) they are instead exposed to situations in which hate, violence, and strife are the deficit and give us back our power with the J~panese. The plan is simple and non- destructive to the J)Opulation at large. The plan is:. 1) fight the war on drugs to confiscate dr11gs from traffickers. 2) take the drugs and sell norm. Character use of weapons is continual. For verification. tune into any episode of Masters of the lJniverse. · From a :psychological standpoint, it is difficult to say what kind of impact these cartoons'(as well as, but not as much as, newspaper cartoons) have on impressionable youth. While I win be the first to admit that my nephew is a wimp and needs a lacrosse stick, the effect ()n the whole could be quite different These cartoons help encourage a world in which violence is condoned, accepted. In a better time (see Ed Stevens' latest Sentinel article), children were sheltered a great deal more, so that they would not ever grow apathetic (dare I say a taste?) towards violence. Evert the students of Union were never e:xposed to the likes them to certified drug addicts. The certification will be controlled by the Fede~al Drug Administratioa. They will hand out drug licenses that would be similar to drivers' licenses. Of course, sdme forgery will occur. but tbe forgers will probably be eligible for the real card. The addicts then will be able to--shoot, swallow, smoke or snort the drug .of his/her choice wit11 no .peaalty for being an addict. In order to insure that the drugs do not get into the wrong hands, shoatfug arcades, similar to regular arcades? will be set up for' the addicts to· get the drugs in their system.

Boycott Gillette: You Can Make A Difference By JON KELLER In the October 5 issue of Concordiensis, SPAA urged all students to boycott products manufactured by the (}illette Cosmetic Corporation. We would like to take · this opportunity to explain the degree of cruelty w hicll. these tests inflict upon the subject animals. Below is a brief history of Gillette's inhumane and cteceitful practices, as well as information on how we, as consumers, can force Gillette to stop all product testing on animals. We can make it happen. In 1985, an employee at Gillette's Rockville, Maryland testing plant began to keep a Hair Care: Silkience Atra Gi!fette Swival Face Saver diary. Later, with a still camera. she photographed and videotaped the suffereing of animals she witnessed in her \daily routine.\ She saw rabbits, their skin pealed raw and blistered with dandruff shampoo; she watched rats die horrifying deaths after massive forced inhalations of hairsprays and aerosol deodorants and many other scenes of unspeakable misery. The Gillette Corporation has offered nothing but propaganda and misinformation in its public statements regarding animal testing. In a 1983 statement, David Fausch, Gillette's vice president of pubfic relations, stated that \The company has not used the LD50 test since 1977. Yet. evidence was late:r found that Gillette's Rockville plant was conducting scores of these specific tests, which involve the poisoning to death of large numbers of consci<>us animals. · Mr. Fausch also claimed that \The company no longer uses monkeys.\ Tilree years after this statement was made, large numbers of caged monkeys were discovered at the same Rockville plant. In the same statement reads the sentence \The classic I>rah:e eye test is not used by Gillette.\ Yet, according to the animal technician who blew the whistle on Gillette~ she saw rabbits held fast in stocks as Gillette's Liquid Paper was squeezed into their .eyes by syringe. Gillette also goes on to pr.aise itself for \participating in efforts to explore the development of animal testing alternatives. II Such rhetoric does not bear close examination. In pojnt of fact, les& tl!an. $1000 has been spent l>y Gillette on the program it mentions. These acts of cruelty and deceit cannot go unpunished. As consumers., it is within our power to force Gillette to stop all animal testing. If enough Americans refuse to purchase -Gillette products, if new laws are passed by Congress to curtail animal testing, if enough pressure is levied against this m11lti-billion dollar corporation, we can force it to put a st()p to this cruelty. We can make ithappen. What You Can Do: 1. Take the Cruelty-Free Pledge today.

MBA Collo·quium Honor,s President Morris By KAREN HURWITZ At 3:45 p.m. on Thursday, · October 19, in Baily Hall312, Union's President, Jonn ~. · Moms, delivered a speech on • \The College President as an • Institutional Manager/' as part of the MBAColioquiumseries · sponsored by the Graduate Management Institute. The president sees his role as symbolic, in that he represents Union College to the faculty, students, alumni, aad community. His relationship with the faculty, he believes, is extremely important because they are the teaching element. the re~son why students come to college. It is important to · realize, he said, that \faculty are not employees,\ they need mental space to research, read. and prepare to discipline.\ The alumni are an integral part of our school because they give millions of dollars a year . to our school. He believes it is · a difficult job to represent our College to the alumni because he mus.t help them to understand the changing circumstances of Union College. Many alunmi remember the days when Union was single sex, when Nott was a library, and when the College Center was an engineering buildng. He tries t() demonstrate the constant movement of our school in time and the changing circumstances and needs of this academic community. Schenectady is another example of the president's role as a business manager. He suggested the importance (}{ his·efforts to make Schenectady an improving business community. A vigorous Preside nt Morris addressed the r.IIBA Colloquium last Thu.rsday. downtCJ..vn Schenectady is imporU!nt for the welfare of Union <:tO!lege. President Morris is also a business manager in his role as the head of an institution that has a 'b:udget of 40 million dollars_ [n order to balance the budget he must run school as a business e11terprise. Finally, and eq11ally important, is his relatior~silip with the Board of Trustees. He believes much of the success of Union is due to the gooo working relationship of the ]]r-esident, faculty, and Board ()f1rustees. As ))resident of Union College, tnany other issues are importa11t besides finance. He mention~d the most recent problerras of how to deal with the concem abut security, drug and alcoJIOl abuse, and the negativ-e. attitude towards independe:nt colleges.

KAPlAN \'Take Kaplan Or lhke Your Ch:anccs 489·0077 ' Page 3 F rate,rnities ·under Fire F·or Harrassment ConHnued from pag.e l sexes, he cite<l the issue of rape. Some collcgiarc rapes do occur at fraternity houses, yet the conclusions drawn as to Why Gogola f)elievcs this occurs were not specific to Greek organizations in particular. Gogcla quoted an article from \1'hc Nation,\ which stated that males arc apt to rape women when their peer group \discusses women in sexual terms and creates a climate of scori11g.\ The writer infers that fratcrn i tics perpetuate this JJractice. Once again, he does not perceive the entire issue. Sexual peer pressure most lil<ely begins in high school, not college. Therefore, some men come to \These guys are the sweetest guys in the world. Maybe that's true, I think, and tlien go downstairs to the bar and see a bumper stifker reading, \'No one is ugly after 2 A.IVL'~'. -excerpt from Metr()land artie le college with thi:s auitudc and whether Greek or not, are pressured, and pressure others, to \score.\ In addition, many males and females, Greek and Independent, discuss each other in sexual terms. Furthermore, Gogola's inset on black fraternities never raised the question as to whether they were sexist. Nor did he attend any black fraternity parties. His questions to black fratemity brothers were based on a racial standpoint. Is G()gola saying that only white fraternities are \Two brothers are playing beer pong in the basement as we tour the bouse. 'The drinking rule is in effect,' says o11e,\ ·ucept from Metroland article sexist, and promote dangerous attitudes betwee11 the sexes? Does he believe only black fraternities are racist? I think the issue of fraternities being sexist_ is one worth being explored. So are the issues of racism and degradation of both sexes in regard to Greek organizations as well as on · college campuse\S. Perhaps if Mr. Gogola focused on, and fully answered, one of these questions, .he might have written an enlightening, and not a sensationalist, article.

In a recent Student Forum meeting held at Hickok House, site of an academically-oriented special- interest residence., there was an obvious indication that the administrtion has fallen far short .on the promises it made to the residents of Hickok House. The largest complaint on the part of the residents of Hickok is their feeling of isolation. The residents of Hickok feel very isolated from their class, and til is llas led to a . negative stere«:>typing by otl1ers. Hickok House. is just one example of poor planning by the administration. The fact that Hickok House and Ludlow House, another speCial-interest house, have vacallcies leads me to question the removal of Delta Chi because of their failure to meet occupancy requirements. Perhaps the administration should be a little more open to students' - wishes. It is quite obvious that the administrati~n is pushing special-interest h()using beyond the interest of the students, wbile at the same time condemning an<Jther form of special-interest housing; more commonly known as fraternities. Fraternities at Union offer a broader range of special-interest housing than the administration could ever hope to develop. Every fraternity is diffetent in character, but they all have certain common characteristics. All fraternities provide their members with chances to grow in many ways. Fraternities also provide tbe chance for students to develop . their leadership abilities. No one at Union is forced into joining a fraternity, b1,1t those who choose to join a fraternity . are rewarded in rnany ways~ The removal of the Greek system at Union would deprive a great many students of one of the best experiences of their lives. The current trend by the · administration towards the . removal of the Greek system is only part of a larger problem, which is the continuance of the administration to make our decisions for us. How are the students expected to grow and develop with the administration ' making decisions for 11s? Part of growing is learning to make , your own decisions. Some decisions turn out beneficial and others do not, but the experiences resulting from those decisions are what shape people.

Apparently, one of the.faculty had given a speech discouraging the use of sarcasm in communicating with others. Being an extremely sarcastic person myself, his attitude angered me a great deal. Granted, sarcasm can be a cryptic form of expression, but it also allows you to say what you truly feel in situations where sincerity would fail. For example, sarcasm enables you to be extremely polite to people who you really can't stand. Take the girl who sits next to you irt Bio for instance. She chews her gum too loudly, constantly reads over your shoulder, critiques · you in lab, never says hi out of class, and then conveniently calls you the day before the midterm blabbering on like Secular Sobriety Group Introduced To Union By DESMOND WARD and BARBARA CUSHMAN Since it is Alcohol Awareness Week, it is important to be aware of the various groups that .offer help and support for those of you who are dependent or know someone who is dependent on alcohol or drugs. The Secular Sobriety Group, established in 1986, provides a comfortable group for the young person who is having trouble controlling his or her alcohol intake. The new group for recovering alcoholics is now meeting on a regular basis in the Albany area. The secular sobriety group is open to all alcoholics, especially those who may be uncomfortable with the \higher power\ religious concepts of other groups. The alcoholics share with one another in an anonymous, informal, caring atmosphere. The Secular Sobriety Group is a nonprofit organization and there are no fees or dues to pay, that sometimes inhibits some people from attending the groups in the first place. Most importantly, the people who are attending the group meetings have already recognized that they have a problem and are trying to do something about it. Weekly meetings are held on Mondays at 7:30pm at Temple Gates of Heaven at the comer of Ashmore A venue and Eastern Parkway in Schenectady. For more information write: Secular Sobriety Group, P.O. Box 9043, Schenectady, NY 12309. C()NCORDIENSIS, October 26, 1989 FEATURES Sarcasm - Yeah Right! you are old friends. So one day she gets her bair cut and it looks reeeeally awful! Using sarcasm you can make her feel good about herself and know you're brightening someone's day by saying, \Wow your hair looks wooonderrful!'i She'll never know what you meant and you can chuckle to yourself feeling satisfied. In addition, sarcasm is used in comedy all the time to illustrate the ridiculousness of a situation. For instance, it's 10:00 at night and your roommate suggests walking to Price Chopper to get some Ben and Jerry's New York Super Fudge Chunk. Instead of telling him/her what a stupid · idea it is, you can say \Oh sure, so you can get a 4.0 after I get jumped by one of Schenectady's finest!.\ Then they realize that it's not such a good idea and nobody's feelings are hurt. Last, I find sarcasm to be extremely helpful when in uncomfortable situations. If someone starts to give you a hard tim~, don't let them get t0 you. just pop back with a sarcastic comment to put them in their place without truly being itisuJting. It's a great way. to tell someone to get lost without actually saying it. That way you don't sacrifice your pride and dignity by lowering yourself to their level. Sarcasm, h()wever, can backftre and. must be handled carefully. I find it's generally a good idea to :eorb it when meeting new pe()ple or else be prepared to say·••jast kidding\ a lot to lower raised eyebrows and dispel q11e;tioning looks. Problems als<> arise when I run into certain individuals whose sarcastic nature feeds off mine, and mine off theirs and neither orte of us knows whether we are being truly insulted or not. As with many art forms,. it takes lots of practice. Admittedly, it can be hard to take and yotL have to learn when to quit.

(Dad's . usually Ia.~ghing too hard to leave, because that's where I got it from.) However, in the long run I think sarca~m is an extremely useful tool that should not be thoughtlessly discarded. Some may find it hurtful. but only if they know what you're doing. That's the beauty of it though, they usually don't and it gives you the opportunity to feel you have control over a situation. It also helps to be able to-detect sarcasm. That way when friends tell me they \loooved\ my article, I'll know what they really mean! ''I don't want a lot of hype. I just want something I can count on.'' Some long distance companies promise you the moon, but what you really want is dependable, high· quality service.

This committee is an adhoc, put together to formulate a draft of recommendations for SAC (Social Alternatives Committee}. \The committee was put together to represent the points of view of the faculty, fraternities, sororities, students not affiliated with the Greek system and an administrator,\' said Alford. The committee consists of four students, two faculty members and an administrator. The four students (two males and two females) include the president of the Student Forum, the president of IFC, the Panhellenic president and one independent student. \The two faculty members represent people with experience and perspective of Union over time. They both express intetest in student affairs through committee work and extra- curricular involvement,\ commented Alford. The committee is trying to work as efficielltly and quickly as possible. \We want to work thoroughly and get everyone's point of view, IJut we want to get the job done,\ Alford stated. \In the spirit of free exchange,\ Alford commented, \we are using :fairly informal procedures.\ \We're not interested in ramrodding a decision past the students. We are faced with having to keep our social policy consistent with the law and other significant· factors, such as insurance companies,\ Alford explained. \Most important is that the social policy should be consistent with an environment that supports high quality teaching and learning,\ Alford concluded Union Students Exhibit Photographs of Britain Twenty students and two graduates of Union College who participated in a fall 1988 term abroad in Bath, England, will exhibit their color photographs taken in Grea:t Britain.

October 26, 19-89 (llnnrorbirnsis Founded at Union College 1877 --- The Truth Hurts The October 19-25 issue of Metroland featured on its cover It The Lust Boys.\· Inside an article entitled. \He Ain't Sexist, He's My Brother\ described the immature behavior of local fraternity men. Not only was Union targeted as a culprit, but other colleges and universities such as RPI, SUNY Albany, and Colgate were attacked, Union and SU-NY A taking the most abuse. However, Tiiomas Gogola's article articulates certain points that. are in fact valid. While Gogola's angle is obviously anti-greek, one might suggest that reaction to his article is motivated by personal offense rather than the knowledge of the truth. It carmot be denied that those incidents mentioned in the article do take place. He is right on that point. We have all been witness to such happenings. In fact, fraternities and sororities in their very existence are sexist. Objections stem · from the fact that he is biased and personally attacks us in his article. The article presents itself as covering purely the sexism of fraternities. Gogola introduces more into the article than this sole issue. He touches on racism, alcoholisnt, and hazing in addition to sexism. Fraternities do offer redeeming values as well. This too cannot be denied. Gogola does not mention the efforts of fraternities to correct sexism (such as sponsoring speakers on the topic of date rape), for that is not his point. His point is that \fraternities reinforce unhealthy attitudes between young men and women.\ Gogola's intention is not to say that these things occur exclusively at fraternities, but rather they are just one more place to find this behavior. Sexism may very well be prevalent · throughout society, but that is no excuse for it to occur or be tolerated here. And knowing that fraternities are a part of an educational system should be a cause of worry. In an age when we are trying to rid ourselves of sexual stereotypes, should we include \reinforcement'i of them in our college or university environments? This is quite a harsh accusation. A finger pointed such as Gogola's is not readily accepted. No one likes to read criticism, let alone hear negative things, about themselves. Print seems to make it more concrete. If Union's.Sigrria Chi were not mentioned in the very first sentence, or any there after, would the reaction have been as strong? Would any one have even bothered to read the article in the first place? In addition to challenging Gogola's angle, one must question his intentions in writing the article. He obviously extracted a reaction on our campus as evidepced ~y the discussion of his. article in classrooms~ and the very space alloted in this week's Concordiensis. Perhaps he is hoping for letters to his editor, perhaps he is hoping to raise consciousness, or even elicit actual reformation of men's behavior within fraternities. Whether he intended to qr not all of this will occur, however, so slightly. As we have experienced on this campus before~ it is the extremist point of view that acts as the catalyst.

Like aU goed icons of the sixties, Monty Python pushed the established beliefs of society to the brimk ..Python had a unique quality and eaqh was as lovable as the other. But when these six Oxford and Cambridge graduates came together as English Crones or Bum.bies, a new · incarnation was established. Python transcended individual input-· to put it .simply-.

Starting this coming Sunday, Union is offering a week-long series of lectures, workshops, -and community events which will hopefully bring our community's consciousness to the forefront of this issue. The skits performed by Shades Of Grey were exaggerated versions of what would happen if... well, if AIDS began to spread around our college campus.

Although she begs him to leave his wife he refuses, citing every excuse in the book. When Molly accidentally becomes pregnant she still ha.s hope that her lover, played by George Segal, will leave his wife. However, her hopes <>f his leaving are dashed when she catches Segal with another woman. All the co rne while Molly is pregnant we get a very artic11late interpretation of the baby- 1 s life through his eyes in the womb. (the voice- over is done by Bruce Willis.) The conceJ>1ion of the baby is actually oae of the funniest parts of tile movie. A pa.ck of spenn, led by the baby-to-be (Willis), swim frantically up the fallopian tubes into the uterus, ali the way yelling \Come on guys, it's this way!\ Molly goes into labor in the middle of rush hour in a cab. She relies {)n the fancy driving techniques of the lovable cab driver James, played by John Travolta, t{) get to the hospital. James and Molly become friends and eventually James becomes baby Mickey's babysitter. Jason Schaller who plays Micley as a toddler displays ease in interacting with Travolta and Alley. Travolta's scenes with Mickey are truly tile most precious in the movie. This will hopefully be Travolt!!'s movie comeback ALBANY SYMPHONV ORCHESTRA'S NOV. 3rd & 4th CONCERTS Geoftrey Stmon. conductor 11vorks by Brahms, Koda/y, Bernstein & Downey} \ ALL STUDENT TICKETS: (One hour before concen With iD) AND THERE IS MORE!

Molly goes on a search for the perfect father for Mickey because she feels he needs a permanent male influence. She puts her personal choices aside in looking for a mate and instead looks for a man wh.o would be a good father. The series of men she dates prove to be very f11nny, especially her date who doesn't stop talking about his intestinal disorders and gallbladder problems. Although this movie is super cute and mostly funny there are parts when the jokes are silly. As I said before, the writing is predictable, especially the ending. However, this is definitely a feel-good movie that leaves you wanting a baby to cuddle with (not your own of course!). If you like babies this is a definite must.

Q1nn cnrb irnsill SPORTS Rob Adler Places. 2nd In Lifting Competiton Winning Streak Ends for Men's Socc·e·,r On October 15, junior Rob Adler entered the All-American Bench Pressing Championships in Pennsylvania. There were approximately 300 lifters at the competition, and Rob was entered in the 165-lb. division. He had lifted 370. 385 and 400 lbs. The first place winner lifted 410 lhs. and Rob took second. Although the winner had previously tested positive for steroid use, no test was issued before this competition. While Roh began lifting weights for football, he now lifts for his own recreation. Rob claims that his bench press is his strong point because he has shorter arms and has been seriously training for many years. Currently, he is training fm the world record of 415 lbs. for non-steroid users. The world record lift, regardless of steroid use, is 454 lbs. The Women's Soccer team finishes tile season at 4-9•1.

There are still places available, and students are invited to enroll in the program. One must be at least a sophomore and Siltis:fy the minimum pruruqllisit~ for acceptance which is completion of Garrnan II (Basic Gr.rnmn II). The Austro·American Institute in Vi onna is organizing several levels of instmclion in German which will suit the student's different language abilitie::; •md it will provid~ lor housing in private families. The \Arts Architecture o:md Culture\ course t.1ugt1t by Union faculty members in residence (Prol. Kellentcr during the first half of the term and Pr.11 Warde during the second hall) wilt draw on all of Vienna's rtJsourcos. and acquaint the students with its rich traditions. Vienna, a magnificent city with its famous Gothic St. Slt:pllen's Cathedral, its Renaissance and Baroque palac~s and monumental buildings, occupies a leading position among the world's centers ol artistic and int~llecluallife. It has produced masters of literature and science: its art collections are renowned the whole world over; and as a musical center, it probably has no equal. Today, as welt, Vienna is a center of diplomacy between East .and West (and for that reason. too. a capital of espionage!). Several trips (included in the cost ol the term) wiil enrich the program, among them a boat trip on the Danube 'to the world famous monastery at Melk and an eight-clay excursion to the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) via Prague. Stops In ll1e GDR will include Dresden, Weimar, Leipzig, and East Oerlin, A day in West Berlin will provide Interesting contrasts. The cost of the program approximates the cost of a term spent on the Union cnmpus, All · scholarships currently received will apply. The only additional expense is the air far~ to Vienna and back. An added attraction is that students pa1ticipating in the spring term can choose to spend some extra time in Europe during tile summer without spending add~onal air fare. AU interested students should contact the Terms Abroad Office, Prof. Warde or Prof. Kellenter. HU 211. The applications rnusl be received by Oc1obor 20. was beaded in for an early l-0 lead. The Y ellowjackets put in another .goal before the h&.If was over, and the game ended with a score of 4-0. In the RIT game, the Tigers scored three goals off misma.rlts. Tlie fll'st goal came en a play that should have been called offside, and the other two were, one-touc·h goals. However, in the second half, Union was able to finish strong and they played well all around. RlT was kept to three ' goals and the game ended with l:lle Tigers on top, 3-0. While Union ....,has traditionally been a successful. soccer team, it's to11gh to be optimistic this year; This has been a difficult s~on so far; with a1l but three cf the teams on sc:h<edule ra~lkedat eitherthe state~ regional, cr national ' levels.

In an instant, tbere was a tremendous loss ·Of life, and suddenly, baseball meant nothing. Certainly, life is more p:tecious than a .game, no matter what game it may be. While games can be mad~ up, lives cannot be replaced~ But as the week progressed, one .could not help but think of the . players, for baseball is their lives. The Bay Area had waited for some 27 years for an event such as this and the players had waited all of their lives. Other children dreamt of being doctors and lawyers, but these particular children dreamt of , playing baseball. Baseball is now their career andjust as the doct<>rs .and lawyers have retur:iled to work, it is time for the players to do the same. It was certainly n~essary to pat baseball on hold, to remember and .to rn{).urn. but the Series must continue. The games must be play«!, not just for elite sake of finishing the contoest~ but to symbolize the feeling 1hat life must continue. :Baseball has been an insp:ir:ation to all since its inception. lt has ]Jersevered through. depressions and world wars.

P;;tg~ 23 SPORTS Jen Lyon - Finishes Career With ' a 29-1 0-2 Recordinne1' By MARK T, ZIMMERMAN Sports Editor This week's Athlete of the Week is senior field hockey go~tender and co-captain• Jen Lyon. While the team h:as a modest 6-6-2 record. Lyon's performance has been out- standing as she has all()wed jQst 12. goals and made 74 saves. Jen has been the starting goaltender for the varsity team since her sophomore year. Fresbmat~: year she :played for the junior varsity team. As· a sophomore she had a 7-3 record and in last year's outstaDding season she had a 17-1 record. In those two seasons,_sl1e made a total of 187 saves. . According to Coach Clurlie Jenlyon Roberts, Lyon is an extremely stable and consistent player. Not only does she do her job by saving goals, she directs the defense well, so tllat much of the time the ball never even reache!; ller. The coach also went oil to talk about Jen's positive attitude and how she alw;,tys 1einforces the team and keeps ,fhelll on their toes. In tlte team's six losses they have o~ly scored a total of two goals.. They .have lost four games lly 1-0 scores and two by 2-1 scores. From these figures. it is evident that wllile Jen ha!; been doing her job in the net., the opposing defense has beell playing well against the Dutterunen offense as well. The field hockey team made the play()ffs again this year, and Jell is one of the major reason~ for their success. Coaclt Roberts speaks very highly of Lyon's abilities and went so far as to say that Jen was one()[ the best goaltenders in New York State. Dutchmen Dive Into Swim Season By JAIMIE LlPSHER The Union College Swim- ming Program, which :really blossomed two years ago when Susan Bassett took over .as co- coach with Bob Magee, has s:plashed into its 19~9-90 season. This year there are two new assistant coaches, the. husband and wife team of Linda and Dirk Francios. Linda, formerly the diviilg instructor at the Hallenpatten School, will impart her knowledge and expertise to our veteran divers Mary Kelly and Dan Jacobs and to her four new rookies, David Robison, Kristen Holbrook, Lisa Massimino, and Suzanne Reed (who will be 1ransferring to Union in January). Dirk, like his wife, is a graduate of Cortland State and previously coached a high school swim team. Although the swim team began its official pool practices on Monday, October 16th, they have been training since the second week of September. For the month prior to water training, Susan ran a mandi:tory intensive dryland program that included work · with the Nautilus equipment and a specialty circuit The purpose of dry land training is to prevent injuries and build speed, power and strength. Susan's; water workouts combine specialty training in stroke work, distance, as well as sprint work. But both programs combined make for a competitive, rigorous swimming experience. The only other training incorporated into the swim season is the winter training trip, This year the team will be traveling to Curacau for ten days during the month of December. The purpose of such a trip is to train in an outdoor Olympic- sized facility, as well as participating in a competitive meet, and boost physical condition, team unLty. and morale. This year's women's swim team .has a strong nucleus of returning talent. Among them are captain Kathy Kavaney, Cindy Curtis, Jeanne Cutrone, Kerstin Dorse,. Pam Fiedler, This year's women's team has a strong nucleus of ~returning talent. Anne Glicksman, Jen Halsdorf, Jen Joyce, Amy O'Neill, Lisa Pizzuto, Jen Torrant, Melita Walsh, and Heather Weckerle. Newcomers to the team include Jen Crowell, Sharon Gatt, Beth Kaplan, Liz , Lambert, Beth Sardillo, Daphne Shirley, and Elisabeth Tripp. Overall, the roster\sports 24 out of control, devoted women. The team has a real advantage because, for the most part, it is a young group with lots of depth. The team will sadly (but only) be graduating four seniors this year. The men's team, though . quite a bit smaller than the women's, (17 swimmers) still looks to have a gteat deal of potential. Captain, and sole senior Lee Fraijii is a good leader;.. devoted to making those · swimmers underneath him work: liard while at the same time he~ve a good time and keep their .s~nity during those brutal practices. Those returning to the ' 1 2.1 Club\ and those who have yet to experience it inclucle Frank A vason, Mau Boo11, Gordo Buchin, Alex Finger. Tim Judge, Nick Kou.kelyoulos, Tim Lynch, James Rawstron, Clifford Shaw,. Tony, Tremaglio, Andy Wags, Chris Walsh, Kevin Wilb11r,. and Sven Zabka. Tlte early season schedule shows quite a few home meets. But the first event that the swim team needs support at is the lJnion Relays being held on Saturday November. 4 at 1:0() p.m. in our illustrious new f~cility. There will be twelve women's and twelve me11':s teams competing and partid:pting from all over the Nortll East area. Diving for t1tis ~vent will be held at Albamy State. 0\o\erall, both teams look very I>romising. With good coaclling, lots of spirit, and a few Jtew cheers, there is very little. these teams cannot do. The women will be hard pressed to improve on their 8-1 reco:rcl from last year and the men,. though they posted their finest won-lost record in over 15 rears in the '88·'89 season, face mll!ly challenges ahead and have a great deal of room to gro\1'.1. So, GOOD LUCK to the l!len's and women's swim team in their upcoming season, but remember ... NO NEGITS AND NO SWEARING!!! Crew Team Win Travel To Saratog,a This· Saturday, Come Out and Support Them. Mouthing Off By ANDY BRAVER To play or not to play? That is THE QUESTION! After the near devastation of a city and countless thoughts of what might have been, the World Series is set to resume in San Francisco's Candlestick Park this Friday evening. But after an earthquake of such magnitude, one must wonder if the Bay Area Series should be resumed at all. Of course, playing any time before Friday would have been disgraceful, if not impossible. Beyond the fact that Cand1estick Park had not been fully examined by structural engineers when Commissioner Fay Vincent made his announcement this past Sunday that the games would resume on Friday, would it have been right for baseball games to be played while there were still possible survivors in what remains of Interstate 880? Or would it have been acceptable for Major League Baseball to use the services of numerous police officers and other officials before the brunt of the clean-up in Lhe city had been completed, or if their services could have been used to help ·protect areas of San Francisco that remained without electrical power? Many other scenarios existed that would have made it very difficult for Commissioner Vincent and San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos to have made a decision other than the one they eventually made. But I am not satisfied by their ultimate wisdom, and I do not think Baseball has gone far enough. Sure, this is the first Inter-city World Series in over 30 years, and it will do a great · deal of good for the moral of San Francisco and Oakland when it does resume. However, should the Series be played as if nothing has happened? Should players and fans alike celebra<e with reckless abandon while a projected $4 billimi worth of property lies in ruin, among them Oakland's City Hall? It is a sticky situation. but this is one time that I would like to wear the beleaguered shoes of the Commissioner .. I would have added a few conditions under which the Series will resume to the speech of Mr . Vincent First of all, every single dollar gen~ated by this Series should be donat~d to help the .quake relief effort: This includes television revenues, ticket sales, co'!lcession revenues, even parking and program revenues. Major League Baseball and its owners should not make one cent profit from this year's World Series. The players and coaches, on the other hand, should be required to donate at least half of their Series bonuses, and they should be pressured,. not forced, just pressured, into donating the remainder. That takes care of baseball's monetary commitment to the Bay Area. Now all that is needed is a commitment from the teams. Whether the Giants or A's win is irrelevant-they just have to make sure that there are no champagne celebrations in the locker rooms after the Series ends. Such a show of frivolity would not be helpful to the communities. There really could not be an occasion which would cause a person to pour champagne on another man's bead unless he was pulled from the wreckage of 880, somebody like Buck Helm. The players also have another responsibility. They have to make sure that they adjust their desires to win. Of course, everybody wants to win a World Series because they don't know if they will ever get another chance. But in this case, the Giants and A's are not playing for themselves. They are all playing for their communities, because whether San Francisco or Oakland win, the entire Bay Area is victorious. With this in mind, the A's, for example, should do away with their forearm bashing ritual. It does nothing other than taunt the opposing team and exalt themselvs, and certainly there is no need for exaltations at this point. Everybody already knows that these were the two best teatns in baseball this past season because they could still be playing in November. I do not mean to suggest that the World Series be played in a state of mourning. However, baseball is only a game. Returning life to normal is the main priority for Northern California, and the resumption of the World Series will help to achieve this goal. But they cannot play as if nothing has happened, because they are still playing on October 27th. An earthquake devastated the lives of numerous people and the fans and players who were in Candlestick Park at 5:06 P.M. on October 17th were lucky that they were not on Interstate 880 at the time. So Major League Baseball owes it to the community and the country to fil}ish the Series. They must, however, show their respect to the forces of nature which created this natural disaster. Even more, though, the baseball community cannot act as if thistragedy never occurred because it will never be forgotten. IIC-

And for a unit that had held opponents to a touchdown or less in four of six previous games, a 24-0 victory at Coast Guard gave the defense its first shutout of the year. Union improved its record to 7-0 on the season and broke a two game losing streak against the Bears. Coast Guard, the defending ECAC champion, fell to 4-3. Tile Dutchmen, playing on the road for the second of three straight games, quieted a Homecoming crowd of 4,201 in New London, Connecticut by shutting down the Academy from the start. It took some time, though, for the Union offense to put some points on the board. The Dutchmen moved the ball effectively but a few dropped passes prevented them frorn capitalizing on their first three drives ofthe game. A gimmick play finally put the Dutchmen on the board in the second quarter. At the Coast Guard thirty-nine yard line, the Dutchmen lined up, but with only ten of the usual contingent of eleven present. The eleventh Dutchmen wa!; junior wide receiver Marie . Callahan who had run towards the sidelines as the teams lined up. Callahan turned around towards the line of scrimmage just as quarterback Brett Russ took the snap. The play was designed te> catch the d~fense off guard, but it failed in that vein. The Bears were right on to it, and when Russ fired the pass toward Callahan. a Coast Guard defender moved into position to pick the pass off with clear sailing to the Union end zone~ But when he attempted to catch the ball it skidded off ltis shoulder pad and into the .hands of Callahan, who then sprinted down the side lines to give the Dutchmen a 6-0 lead. It was Cailahan's second touchdown reception of the season. The Dutchmen extended their lead to 14-0 when Ryan Mason scored from 1 yard out to cash in on a ten play drive. The senior tailback was held to just 66 yards on 17 carries, but, as has been the case in recent weeks, his talents were )lardly needed by the second half, as Union has consistently been comfortably in front. Scott Goodwin kicked a 20 yard field goal in the third quarter for a n-o lead, and a 38 yard run bY Vladimar Telamaque in the fourth quarter rounded out the sc01ing. But the constant throughout was a defense that held previously potent Coast Guard to a paltry 142 total yards.
