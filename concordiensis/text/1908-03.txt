3 , l_ d THE CoNCORDIENSIS VOL. XXXI. UNION COLLEGE, MAR·CH 3, 1908 No. 16 .. \y ; X - !!' - a ;I. jJunior mtcrk Junior Week has passed and it is safe to say that no week of the ..social history of the college ha.s been enjoyecl by more persons. Everything was !Jetter than anything had ever been before, and better in such .a. degree as to leave no doubt on the. score of superiority. The guests of the week began to arrive as early as Wednesday afternoon, and from that time till the cfficial closing of college on 'T'l:ursday at 4 o'clock, there was a diminishing ratio of students present at the various classes. As tlle number of students diminished the number of guests in- creased, until soon all over the campus were to be seen collegians, their sisters, mothers an(l friends. Studies were banished for good and all Thurs·· day afternoon and from that time till Sunday the usuall \' strenuous student was changed into a gay society man. The festivities of a general nature Thursday evening with the sophomore 1 opened so:ree. Friday afternoon the college musical clubs gave their first concert o·f the season before a large audience in the Second Reformed Church. The same evening the Junior Prnm was held at the Ten Eyck Hotel in Albany. Saturday the various fraternitie;; entertained their guests at their houses. Parties, teas, receptions and dances .... ~~~ passed away the afternoon and evening. The reluctant guests .started to depart on Sun- day, and by Monday morning the campus had again taken on its usual classic and studious ap- vearance. -~ --------- Syracuse University :s to hnve a new $3:00,000 gymnasium, which is to he the largest in the world. It will be a three-story structure, 210 by 100 feet. THE SOPHOMORE S:QIREE Last Thursday evening witnessed Dne of thu mcst succe:::sful dances ever held Jn the Boat- house. There were fully seventy-five couples who ·started at 9 to dance the first dance, and the en- t\ usiasrn seemed to hold everyone to the: joyous spirit of tt e occasion. The decorations, in lav- ender and t11e college colors, added 'beauty to the hall. Tte 1nnsic was furnis~:ed by Reuben's Orchestra. The two lJarn clances \Yere quite pretty and en- jo~·ed as being .something out cf the ordinary. In all there were eighteen regular and six extra dPnces. There \Yas a light lunch served about midnight. The patronesses of the dance were Mrs. Hoff- man, Mrs. Von Voightlander, Mrs. Garrison, Mrs. W. C. Yates, Mrs. Cool, Mr.s. Featllerstonhaugh, Mrs. Gibbs, Mrs. Weyrauch, Mrs. Landon, Mrs. Cullings, Mrs. Allen, Mrs. Buck, Mrs. Carmichael. Mrs. Clowe, Mrs. VanOlinda, Mrs. Walton, Mrs. Vedder, ~Ir.s. J. A. Van Voast, Mrs. W.

The committee in charge were Ferguson, chair- man; Conklin, Grover, Kelley, Whitcomb, Nimmo, Shepard, Slutter, Zimmer, Lanclsche:t .. JUNIOR PROMENADE The first Junior \Pron1\ in the :history of the college, the first social event in which all the de- partments of the university conjointly partici- pated, was held last Friday evening with a brilliancy and style that far surpassed any simi- lar social function hitherto give n by t11e college.

TI-LE CONCORDIENSIS The affair was held in Albany, at the Ten Eyck Hotel. T11e main ball room was tastefully adorned with SoHthern smilax and palms, while· nume~·ous college banners and pennants added a. eharacter- istic air to the occation. The mezzanine han, a favorite y,e sting place for the dancers, was Hlce- wise decorated with smilax and palms. The dance was .opened with a ge1:reifal pr.ome- nade, led by President Chapman of the Junior Class. A_ full program of twenty-four regular and four class dances then followed. 'The 1nusie, a feature oif the evening, was rendered by zaa's orchestra of eight pieces. ,Ait intermission a light buffet }unch was served, consisting of sweetbread croquets, fiRger rolls~ bisque g-lace, fancy cakes and coffee. 'iF he pro- grams were decidedly novel, 'being covered with garnet corored .silk, and bearing on the· inside the universf.ty seal incrusted in gold.

The head of the Athletic Executive Committee of PriRceton University has made the following statement: \Cornell and Princeton will not meet in .football this year. The three-year agreement expired last October, and Princeton wished a new agreemen.t for two years, both gahe.s to 'be played in New York. Cornell refused this and insisted up on a home-and-home game, which was rejected by the Princeton management.\ BASKET'BALL DIFFICULTIES Rochester Decries Injustice of N. Y. S. I. C. A. A. Rules. Owing t'J the failure .of Rochester and Colgate to arrange gan1es with e.ac11 other, it is :probable that a pennant win not be awarded this year in basketball. This will he a serious injustice to Rochester because the splendid re·eord tlle tean1 is n1aking leaves no doubt in the minds of Roch- ester men that the pennant be1ongs by right to us.. The situation emphasizes the desirability of some change in the rule that no pennant be awarded unless contests have been arranged be- tween all the members of the 1eague. If this rule is to hold, some way sho.uld be devised compelling ali the colleges to arrange games with all the others. U this cannot be done, the comparative records of different teams should 'be consider€d a sufficient basis for the awarding of pennants, whenever this method shows clea.rly the right of any team to be granted the pennant. The failure to a ward a pennant is not only disappointing to the college which feels itself cheated out {)f its due right, but also cannot fail to Jessen the in- tere.st felt in the league by all its members, since it is equivalent to the suspension of the league· as far as that sport is ·concerned. Rochester might well bring this matter up at the next meeting of the N. Y. S. I. A. U, which will he held in this city probably on Memorial Day, and see if some satis- factory remedy cannot be ~ound, for what is a real and important defect in the organizati{)n of the league.-Rochester Campus. ---------- The Oxford University Athletic Club has de- clined the challeng.e of the Intercollegiate Ama- teur Athletic Association of America for an inter- nationai track and :field meeting between teams representing that organizaUon and the Univer- sities of Oxford and Cam hridge in London, follow- ing the Olympic games. The only reason given is \insuperable diffkulties.\

P. l. Thi~rd. In the match one-mile relay race, the twenty- eighth of the series {)f track events· in the meet held last Wednesday und:er the auspices of tltr:e Troy Y .. M. C. A. at {he State Armory, Hamilton, finished :fi:rst, Union second and Rensselaer Po1y. In st. third. This event prove·d the ID·OSt pop'u hn and interesting of the evening. Dwyer, 'O.S, t11e first rul!lneT for the ~Garnet, ran a ptetty race, and at the end of the second lap the c,{)ntesta.nts were ev(?nly bunched. Captain Parsons, who then toolc up the race for Unio11, wa\s ht excellent form aH:d led the: field from the start. A·t th.e completion of the second lap he was twenty yards ahead of lJ.is nearest op.ponent, and for mo·i1!l.-en t it looked like an easy victory for tlle Garnet. Parsons passed the race up to Ayer, Me·dic, '10, who ran strong, maintaining the lead secured by Par~on until aear the end, where he weakened l)erce}Jtably. He man- age,d, however, to give Streibert, '()9, the last run- ner, a lead of ten yards. The Handlton ru1:n1.er quickly took away this advantage and securing the lead was never headed. The mile was run in 3 minutes and 42 seconds. In the two-Inile relay between Col'nell a'Ild the Univenity of Pennsylvania, .Cor.nell easily ele· featecl her opponent, the time being 8 minutes 1 3-5 seconds. Brown, after a hard struggle, de· feated Williams in a 1ni1e relay. The time for t1Qis event was 3 minutes and 34 seconds. Wesle:yan was defeated by Colgate in an interesting mile re- lay, the time being 3 minutes and 34 seconds. Huthsteiner, '11, and Anderson, '10. represented the Garnet in the high jun1p, the former clearing the bar at 5 ft. 4 in. and the latter at 5 ft. This event, however, wa.s won by Robertson of the Irish-American A. ·C., who clearecl 5 ft. 10 in.

The Sunday afternoon vesper service was omitted on account of the Junior Week fes- tivitie.s. From henceforth to the end of the term the usual time. set apart f.or the prayier meetings on Tuesday nights will be combined with the Bihle Class, which ha.s hitherto follo\Ned the meet- htg. Special attention should be paid to this by the students.

12 THE CON,CORDIENSIS alumni J12ote~ 1838-· · In the re-cent death of WilHam H. Burr, Union has lost one of her oldest living alumni, and one whose never railing lov~e for his Alma Mater endeared him to the hearts of all Union men. Mr. Burr was o·ne of the. first official stenog- raphers in the United States Senate and reported the famous .speeches of Webster, Clay and Cal- houn. Mr. Burr was present at the recent alumni re- union in Washington and at this time gav·e an in- teresting account of our early Amer:can or~tors. 1881-County Judge A. M. Vedder is seriously ill at his home with. a general breakdown of his health as the result of a severe attack of grip. His physician advised him to go South some th11e ago, but with his usual desire to attend to his work, he did not follow this advic.e until last Monday. He left for Southern Pines, North Caro- lina, but his condition was such that when he reached there he suffered a relapse, fainted a num- ber of tirnes from the strain of the journey, and had to return to this city. For over three years, Judge Vedder has been such a slave to his work that he has not taken a day's vacation and this illness is the result of overwork As so-on as he recovers strength enough to attempt another journey he will prob- ably leave for the Bermudas or other points in the South. Judge Vedder has always thought of his health as a secondary eo-nsideration where his work is concerned and is known as a public of- ficial with the good of the city and country truly at heart. 1882-. A bill providing for an addition to the Cabinet in the person of a Secretary of Transp()r· tation and Public Works is being prepared by Rep- resentative Joseph E. Ransdell of Louisi~na, a member of the Rivers and Harbors Committee. \I am :firmly of the belief,\ said Mr. Ransdell to-night, \that it is the part of wisdom for ·us to create a new executive department to care for all 1natters relating· to highways, railways and water- ways. It should also have in its jurisdiction que.s- tions pertaining to the reclamation service, public buildings, and grounds which should include navy yards and docks, the forest service, the Bureau of Soils, and the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Mr. Ransdell says all these bureaus are engagtHl in work associated with transportation. Oo-ngres.sman Ransdell is a graduate of Union: ·College, ·class of 1882. He deliver·etd the Chance1- lo·r's address last June, and was honored with the LL. D. degree .. 1882-Dr. Hinds. gave a ste·reopticon lecture O]il \''Te·mperance:\ before the Frances Willard W. C. . T. U. at the State Street Presbyterian Church Sunday afternoon at 5 o'clock. Dr. Hinds delivered an address on Friday even- ing, February 21, at St. George's Lndge, the event )being a lodge celebration of Washington's Birth- day. 1882-The funeral of Rt. Rev. Henry Y. Satter- lee, Protestant Episcopal bishop of WashingtDn, was held Tuesday afternoon, Flebruary 25tll, at the Pro-Cathedral Church of the Ascension, a.fte,r w.hich the body was taken to the cathedral close and laid to rest in the little sanctuary tnere. The service was eond ucted by Bishops Potter of N e'\\T York, Gaylor of Tenne.ssee and Mackay-Smith of Pennsylvania, and consisted ·of the reading of tlle Episcopal ritual and singing by choir boys. Amo11g the distinguished mourners was President Roos€- velt. The late Bishop Satterlee of Washington was an LL. D., of Union College, the degree having bee11 conferred in 1882. He was a de.scen~dant, 011 the maternal side, or Joseph C. Yates ,a graduate o:f Union, Supreme Court Justice and eventually Gov- ernor of this State. 1886-State Senator W. W. Wemple was chair- man of the general committee of the Charity Ball held in Schenectady's new depot on Friday even- ing, February 21. Picture Framing=== Did she give you her Photograph for Christmas?

Under the .superv~sion of Prof. JMaus·sert they have reached a wonderful perfection, not only a:~ soloists, but f!.lSo in quartet and clt1.b W·ork. The ·orchestra is o.f ~comparatively new origin, but really played like an or.chestra of long standing. EJSilJeCial c-redit is due to the leaders, lVIr. Kline of the Glee Club, lVfr.

A California student who permitted the publica- tion of an article which represented the girls of the University of California as smoking cigarettes, was divested of his clothes and covered with fly- pa.per. inquiries arriving from America in regard to the .subject. With the authority of the full bench of trustees, Secretary Charles W. Boyll says: \Alain Loraine Locke has been appointed by the selection committee of Pennsylvania Rhoc1es trustees, and their agents in England have the greate.st respect for Amer:can opinion and never interfere on prin- ciple with the decision of American 8elections. President Eliot of Harvard will take a trip through the cities and towns of the Middle Wedt in ·A1)ril, lecturing on ''Municipal Government by Commission\ at Indianapolis, Urbana, Chicago, Evanston, St. Louis, Des Moines, Columbus, Day- ton and Cleveland. He will be entertained by col- lege pre·sidents in the places visited and by Har- vard clubs. Mrs. Eliot will accompany him. The total enrollment at Golum 1 bia University for this year is almost 5,200. About 1,100 are summer school students.

THE CoNcORDIENSIS N'o. 17 VOL. XXXI. UNION. COLLEGE, MARCH 10, 1908 eaa iw ;THE NATIOANL DEPT :QF COMMERCE AND L.ABOR and hnn1an principle'S irl wl1ich these laws in the last analysis are embedded. Tb ere are no considerations ef higher imtJ ~nt ------ By Hon. Oscar S. Straus, Secretary. Civics Club Series Continued Commerce has be-en variously de:::cri'bed as an art and a science. Inclu,stry is an art, finance is a science, and I suppose wte:1 finance tal<.es in- rl~'stry under its wings it becomes an artful science. One of the chief functions of the depart- ment whic:1 I admini~:ter is to open up the high- ways and byways of this artful science to the sunlight of public opinion, and so long a.s public opinion is sound and healthy it will kill off all the wriggling and s•quirming vermin that burrow through the 1noral fabric of our financial and political systems. That the stock ticker, which after aU is a deli- cate and sensitive electrical instrument, should register this moral regeneration, is a sign of health and not of disease, and the physician who detects the· germs of that disease which is sapping public confidence and poisoning the industrial and political body, is a benefa.ctor of his country and a prophet ·of his day and his generation. When Jenner introduced vaccination int() the domain of curative and preventative medicine. the reaction- ari-es pronounced him as an enemy ·Of mankind, but the next generation held him up a.s one of the greatest benefactors of the human race:~ and erected statues to his. sl{i11, his service and his memory. than tlle just relatioNs ·of capital and labor. The organization of capital, which is a normal and logical development -Bf our time.s, .should welcome reasonable laws which p 1 lace wholesoiDe restraints upon its activities, so tba.t through competition or otherwise, it will not '0e induced or forced to over- step the safeguards of industrial rtgnts and blocl{ the hig1nvays of or;pcrtl!niity for the humble.3t cit- :zen of the land. There can be no liberty _without cppOl tunity, and to tl: e extent that opportunity is abridged, whether by tl-:e State or by corp-orate 1~ower, it i3 a denial of lilJerty. It is oppression, and it is no less oppr8ssion when it emanates from organized capita 1 or from o.rganized labor. The fundamental p~·Lnciples of indi\-idual liberty lay at tl:e basis of our political sy.stem, and no mere sacred cluty rests upon the c;1ief executive under the constitubio11 than to see that the laws are faithfullly exee1:1 ted. No executive has been were watchful and \Vigorot:s in the fulfilling of that trns1t than our prese·nt executive. The m·ore power- ful the capitalistic interests grow, the more need is there that the rights of the masses be guarclec1, and that their justi ned grievances be redressed. ,And so long as we are faithful to this fun.damental dcctrine there is not now, nor can th,ere ever be, any room in our ooH ntry for -communism, co1lec- tiveisn1, socialisn1 or any other imp·orted \ism but on1 y for Amedcanism. Far more important to the well being of a State than tl1e increased production of commodities, is the upholding of public 1nora1s. We are on the crest of a commercial age. Our roreign commerce alone exceeds our past records, thrP.e thousand. three hundred milli·ons of dollars for the past year, and year by year it will mount nigher, if we do not lose sigh't of economic laws and of the moral As head of this ex:_ecutive depart1nent . .charged with the adn1inistration of some of the laws affect- ing the commerce and lahor, I am deeply sensible, not only of the close mutual relations of capital and la•bor, but of their respective rights, duties and limitations. The department is desirou.s of exerting its ut- n1ost eff·orts to further commerce. As our foreign commerce increases in volume we come more anrr more in competitiol~ with our rivals in the marts of the worlcl. We have trade agents in foreign

I 'I I' 'f I I 6 countrie:s studying conditions and markets in the principal countries of the world which draw, or can draw, upon the products of our In ills and fac- •tories. Their reports are disseminated throughout the country, as well as the reports of our consuls bearing upon commerce. 'The department has taken steps to come into closer relations with the commercial interests ·of the country, and with that view invited delegates in December last from the leading co1nmercial and trade organizations of the principal cities, with a view, not of creating a new National Bo·ard of Trade, but a small delegated body with a ·per- manent s-e·at in Washington, which would rep- resent the entire commercia[ and trade interests of the country, and would not only co-op.erate, but be constantly in touch, with it and other depart- ments in promoting· the best interests of com- merce at h·orne and abr·oad. The governments of our leading eomm.ercial rivals have such co- operation, and they are largely profiting by the arrangement . I am pleased to tell you that this organization of commercial interests is making excellent prog.ress, under the direction of an Exec- utive Council, and that the departlnent is ready to heartily grasp its hands. Furth.er than this, the department, upon a request laid before it by the President, has warmly endorsed a plan to estab- lish commercial instruction in the leading State universities and other institutions in States where no such universities exist, so that the science, as well as all the arts of commerce may be taught to the youth of the .country. -------. --- According to plans being laid now, the soccer football team of Columbia University will make a trip to England late in the summer for the purpose of playing the most prominent English and Scotch teams. The trip will probably be tal{en if Colum- bia wins the intercolegiate championship, or if it comes very near winning. Great interest has 1 been sh·own in the game there and a .squad O·f about thirty men has been practicing daily. passed the examinations h€ld in January. From a recent publication we take this state- ment: It's an interesting psychological faet that the chair of \.AppHed Poultry Science\ at Cornell University is filled by a colored Wiethodist clergy- man. PENN,SYL VANIA'S RELAY RACES. Carnival to be Held in April. The fourte·enth annual relay races given by the Univers.ity of Pennsylvania will be held as usual on the -last Saturday in April. Invitations have }j.een sent to all the leading educati:onal institu- tions in the country and already entries are pour- !ng in, rneet. guaranteeing the success of 'this year's The relay races are probably the best l\now11 set of sports held annually in th·e world. 1i'hey are likewise the largest. Last year over 200 seolastic and college teams faced the starter. Fifteen hundred competitors 'tickets were neces- sar~y to supply the la.rge number of athletes that competed in the different events. Yale, Cornell, Pr,inceton, Chicago, Michigan, Dartmouth, Syra- cuse, in fact all the leading colleges were present, wl1ile the schools were just as wen represented. The institutions having teams in these races ·came from districts as far di.stant as west of Chicago, south of Richmond, and north of Bosto·n. Every intercollegiate champion, both Western and East- erN:- then in college with but one exception com- peted in the speeial events. It is thus no wonder that these games attract to then1selves such wonderful entrie.s. mach year, the- ~best college ancl and scolastic athletes of the country are at the Yelay races and it is an athletic education In itself to attend this 1neet. A relay team is com- pos·ed of but four members, so that it is within ·th€ power of any school or college to send their atllletes to Philadelphia. This is done in many scllools by popular subscription where the finances of the Athletic ,Association are. n'0t sufficient for the p.urpose. This year's meet needs only fair weather to make it the most succe.ssful to date. All the big colleges have sent assurances that they will he represented. Because -of the Olympic Spo-rts in London, all the star athletes will be in fine shape and they will all be on hand at Franl<Hn Field on April 25th. ---. ------- L.ast week Monday, Lent, '10, took up his duties as a cadet a.t West Point, having successfully THE First 1 This · sched':ulE here in 1 As prE is \Resc ing .syst• financia; taken b, ative. selected are La ·~ R.

The speakers for both tean1s have been selected, and those who are to debate for Union are La Grosse, '08; Kin.g, '08; Weyrauch, '08, with R. Ury, '09, as alternate. Our team ~s putting forth every effort to win, and to that end has held debates daily in the chapel. Judge Alder Chester of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court at Albany has consented to bE' one of the judges of the contest. Mr. Darling, treasurer of the General E;Iectric Company, ha.s been asked to serve in a like capacity and for the third member it is expected that a man will be procured fron1 the State Education Department in Altbany. During the week word has been received from Rutgers relative to the annual debate. The con- test will he held this year at New Brunswick ou May 1st. Rutgers will submit the question within a week ---------- Opposition to the selections of a Cornell coati for ~the debating· team that 1net Columbia at Ithaca on February 28. was withdrawn by the THE JORDAN VALLEY Dr. Cady's Seventh Lecture Delivered on Friday Afternoon On. Friday aftern·oon at half-past four, Rev. Put- narn Cady delivered the seventh lecture of his .. POl)Hlar series on his ·explorations and investiga- tions in Egypt and Pale.sHne. His specific the1ne ,,, 3'S ''The Jordan Valley .and the Western Shore of t1l e Dead Sea.'' Oil\. Cady n1ac1e the statement that there is no valley on the face o:f the earth like the wonder- fnl Jordan valley; that Palestine is a miniature \VOTld in itself, for within the limit of a day's jo1:uney one can pass through a country where all forms of vegetable life in the \vorld could be pToduced from the Scotch firm down to the trop- ica1 11alm. H·e described the· Dead Sea as nearly thirteen hun(lrecl feet below sea level, this 1 being the lowest body of water in the world. The water of this sea contains from. twenty-four to twenty- six. per cent. of s-olid matter, whereas ordinary sea. \va ter contains only four o-r fiv.e per cent. DPSllite the inclen1ency of the weather there wtts a goodly nun1 ber of students and outside friends present. The growing interest in Dr. Ca.dy's lectures see1ns to indicate that the student ho{ly is beginning to realize and appreciate the va Iue of such a cmu·se of lectures at the hands of such an explorer and student of archaeology as D1~. ·Cady. 1'he next lecture of the seTies will be given on next Friclay, March 13th, as a supplement to this one, the subject being ''The Jordan Valley and the Eastern Shore of the Dead Sea.\ Columbia .speakers.

A nun1 her of valuable le~sons have been learned fron1 the season's work, however, and H is ex- pected that next year's team wHl score a longer string of victories. Union .sco-re.d 138 points dur- ing ·the season, while her opponents rolled up 269 points. The games were: January 18, a.t Troy, N. ¥., Union 9, R. P.

At the regular weeldy prarer n1eeting in Silli- man Hall at 7 o'clocl\: Tuesrlay evening, Dean Rip- ton conducted the service in accordance with the plan adoutGd last week for making a special studY of \The Passion \Veek.\ His special theme was ''The Discourse on the Destruction of Jerusa· Ie1n and the End of the World.\ The attendance was much larger than at the la,st meeting, and it is expected that a still greater number o.f fellows will take advantage of the Dean's course. Next Tuesday evening the annual election of the offieers of the association for the ensuing year will take place. At the vesper services on Sunday afternoon at 5 o'cloc1{, Dr. Hale wa.s the speaker. His talk was very helpful and instructive. This was the last of these services for the winter term.

S~prag1ue has just publishe.d 185S-Sena.tor Redfield Pr·octor of Vermont died }ust before 5 o'elock on Thursday afternoon, Mar·c1l 5th, after an illness of but a few d.ays, with pn€nmonia. The news of his death came as a g.-rea t shock to \Vashington, and hi·S colleagues in the Senate, few of whom k11 ew of his illne.ss. Sen- ator Proctor was a graduate of the Albany Law :Sel1ool, Union University. Senator Proctor acquiretl a fortune in the Tnat~:.rle industry, the headquarters of which are located in the town in Vermont natned for him. He studied law, but was early attracted by the possibilities of developing the quarries in the southern part of his native State. He would have been 77 year.s of age next June. Graduating fro-m Dartmouth College in 1851, h.-e studied law at the Albany Law School, and enlisted in 18·61 as quar- t€nnaster of the Third Vermont Regiment. His most conspicuous public service ·outside the Se11ate was as Secretary of War in President Ha.r- ris.on's cabinet, from which he resigned after two year.s and a half to acce'l!>t the appointment of Seirator from Vermont, to succeed George F. Ed- munds. He was elected Senator at the following session of the Legislature,. and had since been in t11e Senate. His term WOl.lld have expired March 3, 1911. 'The death of SenatDr Proctor creates an unusual sit-uation in Vennont, where G·overnor Fletcher Pr<:lctor, son of the Senator, will be called u·pon to appoint his father's successor. An ele·ction will occur in October, when t11e Legislature will meet, a11d, as Senator Dillingha1n's term also expires, will be called upon to €1ect two Senators. The term of Senator Proctor's successor will expire in March, 1911. The situation is more complex t11rough the fact that Gov,ernor Proctor is believed to be a candidate to succeed his, father. What eff€ct his father's death will have upon Governor PrGctor's desire to come to the Senate is a n1atter of interest in Vermont. R was the desire· of Senator Proctor that suceession should descend to his eldest son, who is the active head of the Ver- mont Marble Company, ia which Senator Proctor accum.ulatecl his fortune.

Section 8 reads: \Championship pennants shall be awarded in footbal·l, baseball and basket.ba'l1, provided, how- ever, that at least three colleges ~be represented with a full schedule. A full schedule· shall be understood to mean two ga.mes arranged with eacl1 of the other colleges represented, except in foot- ba 11, in which a full schedule shall mean one game arranged' with each of the other colleges represented. A· championship pennant fnr track athletics shall also be a warded, together with in- dividual prizes for the :first three contestants in each event.\ According to this section we see no reason why a pennant should' not be granted to Rochester. The only possible ground fo-r doubt is in the phrase, \full schedule.\ It migllt be claimed that Roch- ester has not a full s.ebedule because we have no games arranged with •Colgate. But in th.at case, how could a basketball pennant ever be awarded, beca.use, a.s none of the other colleges have games with H·obart, none of them would' have full sched- ules? Three co-lleges, Union, Hamilton and Roch- ester, are each represented with full schedules ar- ranged with .each of the other two coHeges repre- sented. That Colgate has not arra.nged a. full sched.ule .i·s her own fault and has nothing to do with the question. The section is certainly am- biguous, but a fair interpretation would seem to point plainly to the fact that Rochester is entitlec1 to the award of the basketball pennant.-Roch- ester Can1pus.

Precedent had been esta'blished in this partie·· u,lar by previous trustees who had granted a sim ilae favor to Mrs. Samuel T. Benec1ict, whose father, \Captain\ Jackson, was fo-r n1any years connected with the college. The Building Committee also ,considered the advisa.bility of erecting the new civil engineer:ng building on the lane just east of North College, but this has not been definitely settled. The resi~ dence which Miss Wells will erect will be locatecl on Union Avenue, just above the Sig1na Ph: house.

The subject, as p1·evionsly submitted by Hamil- ton. was: ''Resolved, That. our general currencv ancl banking s~·stems were the dominant cnnse of our recent financial panic.\ The negative sicle nf the contention was defended by Union's team, con- sisti no· of La Cros·~e '08 · Kino· 'OR· Wevratlch '(l8 ... b t<v .. , ' b' Ll' .., · ' , and Ury, '0!3, a.s alternate. \Vatson, '08; Anibal, '08; Williams, '08, and Riffenbark, '09, alternate, upheld the affirmative for Hamilton. Watson lecl the attack for Hamiltcn by defining u~e question from the standpoint of the affirm- ative. The term panic he defined as a condition of nlarm existing in t11e mincls of the people and giving rise to runs on bn.nks ancl phenomena of lil-~e nature. He maintained that the recent panie s: arted with the run on the Knickerbocker Trust Ccmpany on the twenty-second of last October ancl t11at it lastetl only while the depositors' n1in~:1s \Vere filled with fear. He then proc8ecled with the li:1e of argument, showing that the lacl\ of d!s- crimination between State and national banking E:ystems is one of the most glaring defects. The negative, 1ecl by La Cro:ssc, ~net the affrm- ative on their own ground regarding the c1efinition cf terms and the origin antl close of the panic. He 1naintained that, a1t11ou;:;h defects exist in our sys- tem, the debate must be decidell up-on tl.1e question whether thiG; over and above all other causes combineJ, '.vas tl:e pre~·imninating r.anse of oar recent panic. He then outlined the position of the negative as follows: First, the in1possibility ancl ir1probability that these systen1s sbould have been the dominant cause; secondly, that aver specula- ticn and destrr:ction of vi·ealth were the d::>minant cause. He place.cl upo'2 the affinnative t~1e bunlen of proving why there is not a pan!c to-r1ay, sin,.;e the same defects are still in existence. I~n closing; he sumrnarized the standpoint of the negative l:Jy a quot::ttion from a recent spee~!1 made by Senator Bt:rs-ess: \T .·e cause cf our panic is our prosperity spree and the sobeTing up process brought on the panic.\ .1\.nibal, f.:econcl B~)eaker for the.' aJfrmative, ex- plained at 1 engtn the defects in our cash reserve methccls. He n1ade the statement that a great part of the t1eposits sent by the country banks to the re;:;t:rve banl\s is investerl in wildcat speculation in the Steck Evchange. King retaliated for lTnicn 1Jy sho-wing that over speculation had strained the cret1it of our country to the breaking poi.nt, and had til us brought on the panic. He lil{ened the conditions at the time of the panic to a great pyramid of cre~1it standing on its apex and reacly to topple over without warning. Williams closed the direct argu1nent for the affrn1ative by arguing that our currency is abso- lutely inelastic, since it is built on a 1Jonc.1 sccuret1 currency. Weyrauch, the third speaker for the n€g,ative, took up the argument of destruction of ca:pital as another uominant factor, showing how this taxes the capital and credit of a nation and quotin~ reliable authorities in support of this vie'\v. The rebuttal W3S marked by zeal and eloquence. and repartee was frequently passed. The affrm- ative's argument hinged largely on the pojnt that the fact that foreign countries, although in lil<e conditions, did not experience a panic proved our system to he the dominant cause. The negat:.ve in their rebuttal attacked the position of the affrm- ative and strengthened the view that ovei' speculation and destruction of wealth was the prediminating cause. The judges of the contest were Judge Alden Chester of Albany, Henry \V. Darling of this c!ty and Dr. Howard J. Rogers nf the New York State l . l.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 7.. CLASS OFFICERS ELECTED A THE:ORY :QF· MIND 1908's Commencement Orators Are Chosen-Committee's Report O·fficers for the commencement functions nf the Senior class were elected at a regular hl:eeting o;f the class, held Saturday morning in the chapel. At the .same meeting reports were heard fra:m all the committees having charge o-f .the varioHs affairs of the class. John F. Nash .of Plattsburg was eJected grana marshal after a close triangular co.ntest. Robert MacMullen and W. S. MeN a b were the other two contests for the position. The Ivy Day officers as elected are: Ivy orator, Rcss W. Tiffany or Schenectady. Pipe orator, Arthur B. King of Troy. Ivy poet, Carl Vogt of Buffalo. The Ivy Day exercises, including the orations anc1 smoldng of the pipe of peace in the grove, under the old Nott elm, and the planting of the ivy vine, will take place Monday afternoon, June 8. On Tuesday afternoon, June 9, the class day ex- ercises will tal{e place in the First Reformed Gh urch. The speakers on that occasion will be: Class historian, T. E. Hanigan of Schenectady. ·Class orator, H. W. Bell of Albany. Class prophet, A. E. Davies of Scbenectady. Class poet, A. V. V. Raymon·d, Jr., -of Bnffola. A. V. V. Raymo.nd, Jr., chairman of t~e commit- tee appointed to see about procuring a 1nemorifl•l in com1nemoration of tbe class of 1908 upon .grad- uation, re-poTted in favor of new pews for the col- lege chapel, a new piano for the chapel, or a stan(~ fence to be built upon the· Union Avenue side of the college. The matter wi11 be- settled at a later meeting of the class. Reports were also heard from the chainnen ot the cap antT gown, the invitation, the senior hall and the song com1nittees. It is intended this yea1· to hold the Senior ·ball in the Nott Library build- ing, and it is pracUcally certain that the assent of the authoritie.s will be secured to hold the func- tion there. Soon after the beginning of the term another meeting of the class will be called to decide finally up·on the business of the class, as presented by the various committees. P , f M· arch's Work A·ccepted by · ro . Scribner's-To Appear in The Fall Prof. March's new book, \A Theory of Mind,\ has been accepted by Scribner's, who expect to publish it next autumn. The volume, divided into twelve c11apters, will contain about 400 pages. According to Prof. March, the theory proposed and elaborated in the hook, rnakes the instincts (which are carefully clescri\\bed and enumerated), the fundamental me·ntal fact. From these instincts are derived, among other things, all interests, feel- ings, actions .and thoughts, as well as memory and sense perception. A complete systematization is thus attempted. Since the books covers, in its sphere, principles that have never before been elaborated in the way undertaken by Prof. March, it may turn out to be of vital importance. Critics who have exa.minecl the \theory\ say that it will revolutionize the world of thought if it is accepted. H has long been ln1own that Prof. March was at work on the volume, and the appearance of the book is awaited with interest. A new .scheme· for the elimination of roughness from the game of basketball has been proposed by Coach Jamis-on of Purdue. It consists in having \ a starter who is to do nothing but toss up the baH, and then follow all the plays with the ball, leaving the referee to oversee the game from the side lines, so that he may be in a position to see all of the roughness. --------- CORNELL UNIVERSITY M-EDICAL COtlEGE NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION COLLEGE DEGREE THE STANDARD .

8 THE CONCORDIENSTS THE FORESTRY MOVEMENT U. S. Forester Writes for Civics Club. NO. 6 OF SERIES Wh.irch vrere in as. bad shape as many of our own which ha-ve ibeel!l reeldes sly cut over, it raised the ave~·age ytel:d. of wood per acre from 2·0 cubic feet in 18 30 1 to 65 cubic feet in 19 04. In F'l'Rlil:Ce forestry has decreased the danger Many people i.n this country thinl\ that forestry hacl never been tried until the government began to practice it upon the national forests.. Yet for- estry is practiced by every civilized country in the world .except China and Turkey. lt gets re.suits which can be got in no other way, <1!ld which are necessary to the general welfare. The more advanced and progressive countries fron1 :floO:fjrs, which threaten to destroy vast area..s of ferti:l:e- fa.rms, ancl in doing so has adc1ed many mil'lion s of dollars to Eu:: national wealth in new forests. It h:as removed the danger from sant1 dnnes ancl in their place has created a property worth Jinany millions of dollars. France aacl Germany together have a population of 1()'(ij.,Hn n,O!Hl, in ronnel numbers, against our prob- able 85,0!)0.,000, and State forests of 14,500,000 acres a:gai11:st onr ]().{),000,000 acres of national for- ests; 'l~ut F\rance and Germany spend on their forests $11,000,000 a year and get from them in net returns $3 o.,00-0,0(}0 a yea I\ while the United States svent ·on the 1ilational forests Jast year $1,40.0,000 antl .secured .a net return of less than $130,000. arrive first an:.l go farthest in forestry, as they do in other things. On the one hand, the nations whi~ch follow forestry most widely and sy'stematic- ally would be found to be the mo~st enlightened nations. On the other hand countries without for- estl·y, we cou1<1 sa~· of \Here is a bacl\warcl nation.\ 'I'he countries of E'nrope and Asia, taken to- gether, have passed through all the stages of forest history and applied aU the lu1own principles of forestry. They are rich in forest experience. The le.ssons of forestry were brought home to them by hard l{nocks. Their forest systems were built up gradually as the result .of hardship. Every step <Jf the way toward wise forest use, the world o·ver, has been made at the sharp spur of want, suffering or lo..ss. .As a result, the science of for- estry is one of the most practical an(1 most directly useful of all the sciences. The United States then, in attacldng the prob- lem of how best to use its great forest resources, is not on the po.siUon of a pioneer in the field. It ha..s the experience of all other countries to go upGn. There Is no need for years cf experiment with untried theories. The forest principles which hu11dreds of years of actual practice have proved right are at its command. The ·only question is, H·ow shou1c1 these be modified or extended to best meet American conditions? In the management Df the national forests the govern1nent is not w-orking in the ilark. Nor i::l it slavishly copying E-uropean countries. It is putting into practice, in America, and for Americans, principles trie·d and found correct, which will insure to all the people a1ike the fullest and best use of all forest re- sources . . Take the case of Germany. Starting with forests A ci-rol!l1Rr entitled \What Forestry Has Done,\ just published by the Forest s.ervice and obtain- , able UJlOLl application to the F:orester, Washington, D. C., reviews the forest wor1{ of the leading for- eign ccHtntries. The chief le·ssons \Yhich may be learrletl fr0n1 them are summarized as follows: \tVh.at forestry has done in otb er countries shows, first of all, that forestry pays, and that it pays ·best -where the most money is expended in applyin.g it. The United State.s is enormously be- hind han <l in its exp.enditure for the management o:f the H ational forests, but neveTtheles..s returns have n1reac1y increased with increased expenditure for m.a:nagel!l1ent. A second less·on, clearly brought home by for~ eiglil forestry, is the need of timeLy action, since forest ·waste can be repairecl only at great cost. Third, private initiative does not suffice by it- self to l)revent wasteful forest use. England, :t is true~ has so far consistently followed a let-alone policy_ However, England has been depending upon foreign supplies of wood. Now that all En- roi:Je is running behind every year in the pro{hlC- tiou of w-ood (2,620,0·00- tons), and there are un- mista\H.able signs that countries which lead as eXlDorters ·of wood will have to curtail their wood exports, England is at last feeling her dependence .and is speculating uneasily as to where she can certainly secure what wood she needs in the future.

Editor of Goncordiensis: I enclose two efforts of mine, which perhaps yon may find room for, and which I should be very glad if your Glee Club would try. Even the oL::l hoys, you see, occasionally burst into ~ong, and their outpourings, if not very muc;ical, have this virtue, that they bear the genuine ilnpress of an old-time and 110t-forgotten enthusiasm. The \Cheer fo·r Union\ is not n1uch in itself, but the .splendid air to which it is set may carry it through. Tl1e same can be said with even m-ore truth of the ''Ten Dominies,\ the rollicking air here serving to swing along almost any words. The song itself is over-long, but college boys, I know, will, without scruple cut and, for that mat- ter, add as they please.

The greater part of the nnm ber is taken up by the reports of the Sl:'cretary of the faculty. A novel feature of the n un1 ber is a classification of the college .students by geographical sections.

The variol.J.s activities of student life are noted, and their parti:e~patioTl by the undergraduates i3 presented in a ~lassified list. The activities in- clnc1ec1 are the Y. M. ·C. A., The Concordiensis, The Garnet, the dehati11g societies, the Civic Club, the Musical Ass()ciation, the athletic teams, the frater- nities and the P~Tamid Club. The report of Treasurer Bailey shows the total availa~)le assets up to July 31, 1907, the date of his annual report, to be $653,5,00.57, and since 1902 the increase of the college assets for the five years totals $119,544.55.

THE CONCORDIENSIS VOL. XXXI. UNION COLLEGE, MARCH 24, 1908 CHRISTIANITY AND EDUC.A.- TION. It is not n'ly purpos .. e, in this sketch, to give a history of the rela.tinns of the OhristL:tn G:n1reh to Educational institu~ions but to define son1e of the principles of Ghr:stiani 1 ty which have made it inevitable that the ·Chur·ch should be the guardian and pron1o~er of educational interest 3. \iVil·lt was it~ that Christianity t~ave to the .first d·isciples? A new interest in life, a new enth u- ~:la:sm, 2. new· mnbition. After the mos.t car2ful analysis this will be found as tile esseatial forc.e, L1e· vi~~alizintJ energy of t:he new religion. As Christ hiHlSE.:lf expressed i~; \I am come t:1at they m·lght have life and 1that they n,1ight J.1a ve it more abundanttly.\ Christi·anity has never ·had a voiC2· rncl 'has no voice t:>day for n1en w:1o wors~1ip at t.1e s~r:ne of the propD.ets believing (hat the greates ~ wit:dom and the highest virtue lie buried there. TI:e bel·ief in larger life has represen1~ed the s-pil\it of Christianity in all the ages and in this belief we find the secret of Chris- tian influence an edt:cational force, for, from L1a~ beli·ef h.as con1e the struggle for better things c:nd in that struggle. n1an has developed the eap:::ci ties and powers wh•ich clothe D.im with dignity and h :;nor. To make this n1ore tl1an a 1nere asserticn let us look at some of the principles ch3.rac.teris- Ucal1y GhriE~~ian. First the de1nand for realit~·. This perhaps more than anything else indicatEs tlle dire.ction of tthe new enthusias1n which Christ gave to l1is disciples. They were living in a world of shadows, of pretended virtues,· of boast- ful knJiwledge, of arbitrary power. Ghris·t un- cove-red the hollowness, exposed the deception and then revealed the tthings of real value, k~ind­ ling in 1lis followers zeal fJ·r ·~he~ substantial. His revelations c-overed the whole range of human interestts. Cl1rist we.nt to the JJ.eart of things, His Kingdorn was 1the Kingdom of truth. He taught his dis·dples n Jt to be con ~ent with ap- pearancets; to get beneath the surface; to find truth and then to s 1 tand for the truth a1t all cost. T lliS· w·a·s the spiri;: of Christ'ianity at the begin- ning and has always been its spirit and to it education owes its greattest triumph:s. Wilen- e~~/er and wherever men have been led to inquire ancl investigate, to h·ace results to their hidden caus.es, to discover nriginal forces and their laws, there the .genius of Christianity h.•1s been il:lu<:l- tra ted and the spirR of Christianity h:::ts been ae- t'ive. Ne.wt:::n and Fr-anklin, Kepler and Agassiz were in t:1eir several spheres disciples of truth, following him w11o said, \T:o this end was 1 born and for this cause· ·caine I intto the world that I should bear witnes.s to the truth. Every one th~ut •is of the tru:th heareth n1y voice.\ As in the sphere of physical science so in the s;1here of social S·Cience ~nd the3logica.l science the spirit of Christi.ani~y has led to the :abandon- mE JJ.t of the s up2rfkial for principle:S funda- nlEntally true. If our schools to-day are teac::.l- ing- more truth and le·ss. error, it is due to the den12nd for reality which the spirit •Of Christ h JS inspired from t:he time· long agJ when he ex11osed the we.akne ss of tradHiona.l ideas, the Inockery of Ph arisaism with its narrow literalisnl its irrational conclusions, its false distinctions. ·Another influEnce springing directly from the teachings of Christ~ is reverence for law. He pro- claimed a Kingdom ::f Heaven whose laws we·re 1::1 bsolute and writ: en in the very na1ture of the· forces which they directed. There was nothing arbitrary ·in these laws. 'They were as natural and neces·s.ary as they were absolute, as he illus~ tratecl. \A good tree cannot bring forth e·vil frt:it neither Can a corrupt ,tree l)fing forth t.:?;OOd fn:L.\ There, written in the· very heart of t~1e tree is the law th•at dete-nnines ine·vittably its fn~ it. When he s a·id, \That which is b()rn of the fles.'h is flesh and tha1t w:hic~1 is. bJTI'l of the Epirit is spirit'' he a:sserted the same truth. Here is a princi:pl e of tre1nendous eel uca ~innal importance. We cannot say that Christians have Glways1 recognized it. ·Indeed, one of 1tD.e most serious ·charges :made against the Church has

THE CONCORDIENSIS bet:n the arbitrariness of it's dogn.:ras and rules, LlE absence of any juEt r .:c::>gni~i·on of the cp·3ra- tion of nati..na·l la.\YS. Wha'tever the erTors of the p2 st. llowev·er, the world ·is n0w a W':::tke to the •truth and reverEnce for law wi1ieh Christ taught and en1p;1.asi~e\l in prEcer~:~ and p.a.r:a:'b1e. 'T:1is led to the acl;:icvemen s o.f n1odern science and IS to-clay =ne of the m·ost potelllt h1fiuences in our ins1:itntions· of learning. However revolutionary it n121:y seem to be 11owever ·destrncti ve of much t,:1at we h-~ ve thought ·es·~abHsihed forever, it marks the coming of the Kingdon1 of Heaven upon eartfi. W·e men. ion but one o~her })r:incil31e. one that is a.p-parent1y ·connected more dire·ctly with the education than any we have named-the duty which every man owes to h•im:self, to the world anrl to God, to develop 1U1e facn1iUes and use the gifts with which God has endowed [l,:im. This .is the snlH:.tance :;f Chr·Is~'s teaching in the· parable·s of t:'le ''Talents\ and the \Poun·ds.\ It underlies ms whole doctrine of service. lf the greatest in his Kin~dom is e1e servant ·of all, then ability 'to ·serve is a distinguishing n1.ark of diseiple·ship and L:e deveiopn1en~. of s.uch ability the first woTk of a true nu:!n. It is upon this Christian princip'le that all .our education·al insNtutions are founded. The pr:;gres.s of Christianity through the -centuries has been marked a.nd de1tern1ined hy incre13.sing entl1usiasn1 for 0:-tln:cation. As the concep1tdon of Christian•ity has enlarged, educa- tional inte·res~s ha.ve bro•adened. When for in· stance· in t:1e time of the Reformation responsi- bility was taken fron1 the Church, the pries1thood, and placed upon the individ u.al, p:)pular educa- 1Ji:)n followed inunediately. Tlile truer thought oi Christianity, which inspired the n1en who firs't soug hit this western land. is respons·ible for the public schoo11 and the whole sy.stem of educaltion which has distinguished us, as. a: pe·ople. Fron1 all that has been said it •is evident that the g·enius ·of Chr.isUani ~Y finds .expression in tll·E· search af~er 1truth, the increa.s·e of knowle,dge, the d ifftmion of in telligen.ce, the eulltivati::ln of thought, the development of man in every d•irec- Non that enlarges his life, and a:dds to his pow·er of achievement. Al~l this we comprehend undetr the one term edueation, and for 1this the Churc:1 of Christ as no other insltitntion has sto:ld. A. V. V. RAYMOND, '75. ou·R ALMA MATER'S· S:ONS. ------ A Reverie. One day as I sat in tile Chapel d~ltJ:\'in.g the daHy 'service I fel~l into a partkularl y r:e~tlee.ti ve mood, .and le.aning bacl{ •in ill'Y seat. ffj):tget:ful of tB.e service and of all tha~ was going on ·a:bowt n1:e, I sa..t in a deep reverie. As I had gaze·d around the Jld .Chapel my glance had ,faUen. upon th·e port~raits of e1e old 1nasters· •(i)I Un.:iotl CoHege; iUustriot~s In embErs of her f·::nnou.s facHl ty, and it was thus I llrifte.cl ·into refieeHon.s on the lry- gone g!:ories of old Undon.

T remembered L1at for nearly a q1:1a1ateT ·Of a cen- hny Union had a grea:er RunJ:}).er of s·tndents th·3n Harvard, Yale, cr any othe1~ .American col- lege. Then I thought of what a pioneeT 1Jnion College. had been: The first -college in A n1 eric a founded on a non-secretarian yet Christian basis, and 1that, too, at a time when infidelity or1. •tl1e one hand and den)min·::t~ional bigotry ·Oil the· other ran ra1npa.nt; the first c.ollege to rece·ive a charter fro-m rtlle Regents of the Univ€rsitr of New York State; the first to establisl.1 a sclil()01 of .science as a s·ep.arate department; the ftrst to provide for a sy:stenl that shJuld be ·elective in any de- gree; the fin:tt to give 1nodern J.anguages a place in .the curriculum. Then I renembered that Union had been a pioneer in anoth·er respect, f{)r she was the first college to tn1st the s~udents. Dr. Nott was t!1e first colle:ge pre·sident to pult the students on the•ir honor as eega.rds personal ·con.duct, and the first ~·o receive stucl.·en.ts expel- led frJn1, oth eT ins.titutions. I recall€d a quainlt,. little anecdote, wh1ich says that, wllen ask.ed what he did wi1th the se1la:wa.gs, he replied, \Make· men of them, sir.\ And l1e dia m.ake men of them. I L1oug.h t of the great share Ullion had had in the higher eduea1tion of wom2n., in preparing An1erica's wives· and daught€rs .for more noble service; for she g.a ve to E'1nira Corlege its founder and firs•t president, to \Rutgers.'

Then my thoughts wand·ered to thos·e who had lived on this· Campus a.nd had loved it. I thought of the old faculty :members:- of Laurens P. H,:.ck.ok, a scholar of world wide reputa~ion, known '3.S ''T·he Prince :of ·Amerk::..n Metaphys.i- cian·s;\ ·of Tayler Lewi's, gre-atest li:Rguist and scllolar of his day, ·in wb:oiHS, frail body Tesided such a Ini1g1tty .. 1nind; .of William. Giiltespie, a leader in the world of engineering; {lf Professors PI'Ol.Hlfit, WhitehoTn.e, Jackson, Wayland, Yates and other o'ld la1u1n1arks .of tlle col:ege. Then ·I :pon.dered upon what Union fiad done for that sHU greater Unison, t:he Union of the Federal .States; for the college had been almo:st urol<en up when the Situdents .enl·isted as volHn- teers in the gre·at civil ·strife. The brtlliant, young Pr:.:;f. Peis:sRer recruited and dr'illed heTe on the l1ill a company of colle-ge· zouaves and i11 pen:on le;J the1n to t!J.,e frcn.~ of battle, where he fell ·:1 t t~1e awful slaughter ef Ch ancellorsvil1e.

Sudd:en.ly I awol{e fro1n. rny reverie. T':L1e ·stud- ents were le::tving the Chapen. Mechanically I aro:::e, and !18' I went I :1-ecalle·d an an·8Cdote one of nlY professor had t=:ld me a few n1olliths ago. It w£.s a true story. As the profess.or had been speaking .of Union's past. ::t student had a.sked, \What put Union on t1:1e bum, anyi1ow?\ And I tl:ought, ''Is U·nion rE-afl y on the bum?\ \No H1e answer ·can1e q ui·ckly to my n1ind, \Union is no~ =:n fi1e bun1.\ I thoHght of Prof. S1teinn1etz. ·1· wonder in electrieity, O·ne of the two ,:sreat·3St el·ectricians in the wodd, and I remembered that > the Hindu govern1ne nt in selecting a col'lege to wh·ieb ~~o· send a studen1t to learn engineering rneth::ds t~o be ~~aught .in their e::mntry, cD.ose Union in preference to every other American un·iversity. The tlw·ugh t caine to 1ne that although Union is not the greates1t eollege j1.1dged bY the ~s1tandard of siz.eo, number o·f studeRts. or richness· of en- dowment, ye~ she is UIHJ.Ue·stionably great in the spirit of Christian un..ity whk~1 has ever ch·::trac- teriz·ed the •college, and in the· spirit of unity in essen1~.ia.ls, in n::ln-essen. tia'ls 1ibe-r1ty, in a~ll things charity. .Afte.r a.11, thoug'ht T, Union ·is a grand old eol- ' for hi's slowness, but wboEE' E~ ~wnes was lthat a.! prudence lil(e th,::~t of Lincoln himself, was com- nla.nder-in-chief of the armies of the United S1~ates. Ja.1ne'S B. Dua.n2· was en·gineer-in~chief of the anny of the P.otoma<:, while at Washing- ton; s·econd to none b1.1t 1t'he immortal Lincoln, was William H. Seward, Secretary of State. Then t~1·ere fla-s;1ed throl;g h my n1ind the nan1es of n1en whJ h3. d gon 2· forth .fr8m old Union to take up lifB's battle and had rendered noble se-r- vice tto mankdnd. I thought of John Howard Payne, aut11or of \Hon1.e Swee ·~ Home,\ with ilts 1nelodies of untold sweetn2ss; of Robert Toornb 1 S, great leader Gf tlle Con.federacy wh·o but for a mere chance would have been P1~esident of tl:1e Confc:.derate States; of Si1eldon Ja.cl{son, G1e pioneer in Alask·an n1issions and founder or over a hundred churches; of Austin Blair, :sturdy old le.ge, grand not only in bygone glories but in the prese~n~ and 1n the outlook for the future as welL And so I reached the eonclusdon that what o1d Union llas been in the past she ever shall he; 1that she will always 'be an ob}eCJt of love to thos·e who l1a ve in the :vast or shall in the future flocl< here, and· that t.o those who 11ave gone forth froin these old gray walls 1t'he memories of the happy ce1ys spen'~ here an cl of U1e fond ass-ociations con- nected with them w•in be a never-failing :s.ource of inspiration.

II 'I I ! I I IO THE CONCORDIENSIS THE TEN DOMINIES By A. Duane, 187:8. 1 Oh, ten most knowing domini,es: together met one day. They said: \We'll find a college in a most pe- culiar way, \No single sect shall run it, but aH shall work as one, \A thing which you will all agree has never yet :been d-one.\ Chorus. In union, in union for brethren to cl\Yell Is surely a most plea.sant thing as all the wise men tell. Then Union be our college, in Union we will live, And for old Union's staunch gray walls three hearty cheers we'll give. Chorus. 2. \And since we all unite in peace,\ these good men loudly cried, \We'll call our college Union; let all in Union bide.\ And 1nany a right good fellow came to answer to this call, And met in right good feHowsl:ip in Union's classic hall. Chorus. 3. And when the college still \Ya.s young, a president she had, Who gathered men from every bana, the pious and the bad, In Union's· walls he moulded men from those none else could guide, And S·oon the fame of Dr. Nott was spread on every side. Chorus. 4. And then 1 anon came Captain Jacl\:, the great of heart and mind, He loved his plants and loved his ~)oy.s and could not be unkind. One day he spied a Snphor1ore all prostrate fron1 a spree Said he \Boys put him safely where the Faculty won't see.\ Chorus. 5. And then Jack FD•ster came, who taught how pen- dulums can veer, GilleSIJie with his r·od and chain, the naster en- gineer, And Tayler Lewis brimming o'er with orientJ.l lore And Pei:s.s.ner's ardent soul \Yho Union's flag in battle l;}_ore. Chorus. 6. And W·hitehorne, good old \Father Zeus,\ whose words of bitter scorn Made many a flunking freshman wish tJ.1at he had ne'er been born, And Perkins, master of the Lab, who made weird smells ascend, And Price expounding diagrams and symbols with- out end. Chorus. 7. All the.se and many more have passed, and others have their place, Lifting the torches they have dropped and carry- ing on their race, And these shall raise old Union's name to honor yet 1nore high, And though her crumbling walls decay, her narae shall never die. Chorus. 8. And should those l\:nowing dominies return to earth once more, And enter at the Blue Gate, and knocl\: at Union's door, In work and play united still each college boy they'd find, All fighting for old Union with all their heart and mind. Chorus. 9. So cheer those good old dominies who worl\:ed so well that day, And cheer the college that they ~'built in that pe- culiar way, And cheer for all good fellows who work for Union'.s fame, And work with them, my jovial boysJ to elevate her name. Chorus.

D.1'il1man of the class .of 1833 in lR.J.-o.] • !The his.tory of the \Partheno·n\ as far as I was connected with it is simply this. In 1832 I propos.ed t~ Henry Sandford, ·son of the late iChancellor Sandford, ti.1at we should publish a oO:lleg·e paper. The proposi1~ion pleased l1im and we agreed that as the te;rm was ahout to be closed suddenly on aceount of the cholera, wnich was. then carryi-ng off Hs vic :.in1 s daily all a bout us, we w::;uld devote the e·xtra tiine thus @iven to us to preparing mat1~ers for the first nun1ber. T·he trouble of l)reparing ·a prospectus was left to n1e, while Sandf·ord was to look about a.mong our co:nege friends for sucl1 assistance in the way ~.f m.ancscri.r;lts as waul be needed. Sandford had then been at u,n·ion two year-; and I but a single tern1. We parted at college in lli,gh spirits, Sandford s.e;:,med to have no fear of the fatal disease. I had bee·n at D.on1e but a few days when I was horror .struck upon seeing his death announeed i.n an Albany paper. He was a victim of the cho,lera. Before leaving college s;uch arrange·ments :1ad be,en made with printers and noltiee' given of the intended publication as induced 111-e on my re- turn to undertake the w·ork alone. I found more n1a1tter in n1y hands than T expected and I ven- tured to bring out the work in magazine form. It was ranked only third among all publis:he-d at thalt time in this country. The first nun1ber .apllEared on the first of November, 1832, and the w::;rk appeared regularlr on t:he first of eac:1 1nonth until 1t.he next con1- ·mencen1ent when I graduw~ed. The Jnagazine had acquired some reputation and w·as soon fo:llowed by one· at Yale and another at Willian1s.

The following extract from '(-Seeing Boston Through a Megaphone,\ published in a 1907 issue of the Ladte.s' Home Journal, is a sa1nple of George Fitch's excellent sarcastic hunor: \We are now approaching Harvard University. In it brains and money are more intimately ac- ' .quainted than anywhere e1se· in the country. No- where else can you get so much knowledge for so little n 1 oney, or so little knowledge for so much money.

Harvard University is attended by more than six th,ousand students, who pursue knowledge with pontes, traps, four-in-hands, steam yachts and automobiles. For all its vast wealth it is very democratic. Tile poor student who has a two-cylinder n1nabont is received on just the same tern1s as the student who owns the imported automobile. \This is Harvard's gy1nnasium.

THE CONCORDIENSIS IS THE GENESIS OF A COLLEGE SONG. To tte generation of Union College students who have been singing the Union :Marching Song during the last thirty years, a brief note of his- tory concerning the genesis of th€ song 1nay be of interest. I will try to write ~t vvithout too great a display of egotism. I was a me1nber of the engineering class of 1874. I believe it was in 1872 that tlle College Spectator, the predecessor of fne Concordiensis, was founded. I had so1ne literary ambition and I was moved by it to send in to The Spectator a contribution. It was accepted aad appeared the follcwing week as the leading article. Later on \Billy\ Rudel of '73, who was ecUtor-in-ch.ief of the . Union College Magazine, met me on the campus and wanted to know if I was tll.e felow who hart clcne some writing for the S.pectator, because if I wns he wanted me to transfer ~s Hterary activi- ties to the pages of the Union College Magazine. Henceforth I was .a contributor to botb ·Of these periocHcals. My literary work attracted the atten- TIFFANY & co. Fifth Avenue and 37·th St., New Y'ork Blue Book The Tiffany & Co.

B. Welch and Pro·f. Cady Staley. matter into consideration. The n€xt dar, when 1 1net him, he said: \Greene I have just the air for that new song of yours.. It's ..something tb e boys will pick up readily, and it 1las a. lilt and a swing to it they will like. The soldiers usecl to sing it in the Civil War. I'll lJri:ng: it over to you.\ Prof. Staley tool~ a 1nost kindly interest in this branch of my colleg2 activities_ Notwithstanding his scientific attainments, which. were of a high order-he was dean of the engineering school-1 think he had the finest literary taste, and the high- est appreciation of good literature of any man I ever lu1ew. I stlunbled a go·oGl bit in some of the m-ore intricate subjects of my €ngineering course, and had it not been for his kindly encouragement r:.nu persistent. patience there; is rnore than a shadow of suspicion that I might not now have the right to put C. E. after my nane. It was in the spring of '7 4, after I had been graduated as an er..· gineer-engineering classes were graduated at the close of the winter term in those days-and I had decided to stay on and con1p·lete a regular aca- demic course, that Staley said to me one day: ''Greene, wty don't y·on write a college song? You can do it. Yon can't equal Ludlow's, but you can write something the boys will sing, and I wish you would.'' \Vith a modesty that was only half genuine, I demurred, bnt he had a1)parent1y set his mind on it, and when we parted I had ]J>r<>inised to tal\e the That afternoon he put into my :hands the words and music of \The Little Octor·oon.\ He sang it for me to-o that I might the better understand L:l:? rhythm. Possibly no one of this generation is fa- miliar with the words, though the air has re- mained popular enough. The last stanza and the chorus were as follows: \Then the brave old gunner took h.er in his arm.H, Thinking of his little ones at 11ome, And through all the marches and the rude a·larm.-;. Safely brought the little octoroon. CHORUS. \Glory glory, how the freedmen sang, Glory, glory, how the old woo(ls rang. 'Twas the loyal army marching to the sea, Flinging out the banner of the ·free.\ So I went to work at the song, rneeting with but indifferent success. When I hacl completed it I

r6 took it to Staley. I do not think he was partie- u1:arly enthusiastic over it. But after mal{ing .some slight alterations he thougl1t it would do. He sug- gested, and I quite a.ppr·oved of the suggestion,. that the authorsh·ip of the song should, for UJ..-; tim·e being at least, remain a secret. I believe be finaneed the enterprise to the extent o-f printing slips containing the song, for free distribution 011 the hill. I kn·OW he called the glee club together an·d taught them both the words and the music in song to sing it. .And yet, little by little, it made its way, and held its nwn, and by the time I was graduated in '76 it had become accepted as one of the eolleg·e so11gs. I think it was. ten years later that I aga.:im_ saw Prof. Staley. He was then presi- dent of the ·Case Scb..oo1 of AppHed Science at Cleveland. 1 met hi'm on the campus at com- InencemefJ.t ttme. A body of undergraduates a cross the green. expanse, beyond the Memorial Eall, all 1~nconscio1Is of our listening ears, was order that the thing migll t ha v.e- ·a fair start. But singing the Union lY.[.arching Song. \Greene he son1ehow the song didn't go. The boys didn't siRg it. H was the spring of '74. The weather was moderating into June. There were beautHut n1oonlight nights. It was song time on the· hHl. But though I strained my ears to catch. some echo of the song over which I had labored, my effort was in vain. I was disappointed and eha- grined. I think Staley, too, felt bad about it, but. he was still o:ptilnistie. \They'lT sing it son1e day,\ he said. \It'll grow on them. Just wait.\ 'Then I was both glad and sorry that the nane of the author was not known. Mingling with groups of students on the campus I heard my S·Dng criticized and ridiculed till my ears burned, and I longed to acknowledge the authorship anrl plunge into its defense. That sort o.f college sen- timent was trite, .stale and profitless anyway, tbe critics said. Then suddenly, one Jnorning, a new song -was launched. Benjamin of '74 was the author. TherP. was no secret about that. \Benny\ had :fine :liter- ary ability and he knew it. His song, written to the tune of Lauriger H·oratius, was intended as an answer to mine. The chorus ran: \Down to Wieneke'.s we will go; Let the lager freely flow; Then go reeling to and tro Back to Alma Mater.\ Irreverent and rollicking, the song caught ·On at once. Before night every student on the hill was humming it. The streets of \Old Dorp\ echoed with it, and the '.'old gray walls\ shoolr with the chorus. Staley was downcast, my nos·e decicledly out .of joint, and Benjamin of '74 was acclailne·d a.s the literary prophet. His song at once becarne a classic. But it was only now and then during the re1nainder o.f that term, or indeed during the fol- lowing yeaT, that the student body or any part of it, was sufficiently attra.cted by the music of my said, '·I tck1 y.ou so.\ For me, on·e of the joys of ccmmencen1ent tiine after thirty years is to listen to the .singing of that song by men as young, as Vlt?·orous, as enthusiastic as I was when I wrote it. HOMER GREENE, '76. ---------- \OLD UNION\ By A. Duane, 1878. ------ Once .more, boys, lift your voices For on r co liege on the hill; As eaeh loyal son rejoices, Shout her praises with a will.

The com.mittee wl1ich has charg-e of the affair consists of Prof. Barnes, chairn1an; Dr. Ellery, Prof. G.aris and Instructors King and Cunningham. The comn1ittee at first directed its eneTgies ill obtaining the nan1es of the Seniors in variou.s high schools and those schools were, in the main, eon1m nnicatul 1vith whlch have rep- resentatives at l'nion. I11 this work the co·mn1ittee was em~inentlr successful. Over fiftr in vi tationR have already been been issued, and more will follow fron1 time to tim[·. The l)rospects of the acceptance of a 1naj.ority of these invitations is exceptionally bright. The co1nmittee is being assisted in its work by the following members of the various fraterni- ties and neutral body: Delta l'·psilon. ::\tJ:.cCor- h1kk. '09; Delta Phi, Welles.

UNION'S EARLY ALUMNI. Tayler Lewis. Taylee Lewis, one of the most brilliant seho1- ars an1ong lTnion's great host of famous alumni and one of her n1ost popular and n1ost lJc:Joved professors~ \Yas born in the little ·eountry town of Nort11tHn.ilJerland, Sarato·ga County. Thr·ough- out his 1on,g· life he had a lasting aff.ection for this first 11 o1ne, with its scenery .of the Upper Hudson and its landsca!Je of f::>rests and m·oun- tains not far distant. In his early school days he gave lJromise of the fu lfi Brnen t of the fondest hope3, for even then h ~ began to attain too great proficiency in dass·i· cal pursuits. Re \vas prepared for college under Dr. Proud~ fit. a relative of Prof. Proudfit of \'Cnion College, and it ·was to the influence of this teacher that Dr. Lewis o1ved considerable of his de::pest reli- gious convictions and earnestness. At eigh- teen he had graduated fron1 \'Cnion where he had c·ome into touch with the pe::rless Dr. N·ot t and had had as c lass:1.1ates- such n1en as L::twrens P. Hickok. the geeat metaphysician and President of the College after Dr. ~ott's death, and 'VIilliam H·. S.::ward, the fiTst statesn1an of his day. :Aftel~ gradnating, Dr .. Lewis began th9 prac- tice of la\\v but beco::nin.g convinced that his duty lay in another direction, he toofl up the study of IDelJrew. So untiring and eager was he in his study, that he often sat up all night and the small hours of morning found him still pouring over th2 classis languages and his Hebre\Y Bible. Tn 1838 he was asl{ed by Dr. Nott to deliver the P·hi Beta Kappa oration at Union. His 1119-stel~­ ful, scholarly .a.dcl.ress, \Faith and the Life of Science,\ won foe hims:lf the favorable attention of the world's best scholars, and he was soon ralled to the chair of the Gree1\ and L3.tin lan- guages in ~ ew York University. In '4:9 he accepted the· professorship of GrePk and Latin at his Alma Yl·ater and later that of Oriental Languages and Bibical Literature. For nearly tllirty years he was connected with the r'nion Facult~·. In the class-roon1 he was an object of affec- tion to hh:; students, in whon1 he inspirecl his own earnestness and noble Chtistian manhood'. As a rnan he was frail but firm, small in stature but mighty in 1nind. He was undoubtedly the best linguist and scholar of his time. He ,could con- verse easily in Greek, Latin, Hebrew. He co,Hld write :Greek, Latin or Hebrew verse. H.e kne·w Chaldaic, Syriac, Koptic, Sarnaritan and Arabaic. lflll2 studied the K1oran carefully. He lu.ad also a knowledge of Gothic, could read Ger:nan an!!l seve'l'al other ITJJOdern languages. He dElighted i11 solving original problems in higher mathe1natLes. He was zealous in his study of astrm.1on1y, anc.l in leisure hours used to calculate eel i:P~es fre- quently. He was a lov.::r of n1usic and produced occasi-onal compositions. He had, also,. an u n- usual fa1niliarity with the poets, Shakespeare es- peciaBY. Dr. Lewis was a voluminous writer and an author of wide reputation. In his literary wor1m he endeavo.r~d for the most part to harn1oHize religion with science and exerted profound influ- ence on the world of theology and science.· t:cle was one of the reacl iest d.::fenders of the chur-ch. against skepticism and atheisn1. As an alumnus, Dr. Lewis was worthy of e1n- ulation. He Inade it a rule to return to his Alma Mjll ter at corr.,menceem'·n t every year. For years he drove her2 from Fort 1 MJller in the sam1e wag<ln. which had brought hin1 here in his coDege da:yrc He had a l{een inte1·est in the colle.~·e and an un- dying love for it.

He was born in Morris, Otsego county, N. Y., on January 30, 1851, was ed uca.ted in the schools of Sche- nectady and graduated from Union College with the degree of Civil Engineer in 1871. For the past decade he has lived in Niagara Falls where he was the Genera.l Manager of the National Electrolytic Com_pany, a concern that manufac- tures chemicals. Receiving the Republican nominati~n for Ser.• ator in the Fall df 1906, he was elected after a hard and bitter c arnpaign. He at once became a leading member of the State Senate and served on the principal comrnittees of that body. Senator Franchot was a polished at:d accomp- lished gentleman, genial and companionable, astute and clever. As an after~dinner speaker he was especially- :entertaining.

JO THE CONCORDIENSIS T'HE OLD NOTT E:.LM. Life of This Famous Tree to Be Pro- lon:ged for 7 S Years. In response to an invitation Sent him by the Junor 'Class, ·~. H:ermann Wi. Merkel, tree ex- pert of th.e New York Zoological Park paid a visit to the ·college la.st week and made a thorough exam.inaUo·n .of the' Nott Ehn whJch has been in a bad state o.f decay for som~ time. The eondi tion of the eln1, it will 'be re;mem:- bered, was first brought to. the attention of the college by Dr. W~ T. H·ornadar, an authority on the pres~rvation of tree.s, who declared that un- less immediate .steps were taken for its ·preserva- tivn, the life of the tree would be extinct in twenty years. 11\1 1 r. 'Ml·2rkel verified the staternent made by Dr. H 1 ornaday, .but feels confident that the life of the famous old elm c.an be prolonged for at least seventy-five years. FoBowing out his recom- mendations, workingn1en wer1c' immediately set .to work under the direction of Dr. Stoller, and heroic m:easures were taken to re.stard the decay. The large limb on the east side of the tree has been strengthened by an iroR support. The decayed portions have been removed and cement substituted in its plac·e. The tree will from time to time receive simdlar treatment whenever any signs ·Of decay .manifests itself. 'Mr. Merkel will shortly forward a report on the exact ·condition of the· tree to W~lton, '09, who is chairman ·of the Nott Eln1 Committee: and he, in turn, will bring the report before the trustees of the college, who are deeply interested in the ],)reservation of the elm. The age of the elm was computed by Mr. M.erkel to be a·],Jproximately 400 and possibly 450 years old. JUNIOR BANQUET. The Junior Class is making JJreparation for holding a large banquet which it is planned will partake of the nature ·Of a gc:neral college affair. The banquet will doubtless be held in Albany, at either the Ten Eyck or the H--a~pton, in the latter part of April. The comrmittee in charge consists <.)f Duane s. Guardinier, chairman; J·ohn T. McOorn1ick and Ralph J. Ury. IMPORTANT MEETING OF ATHLETIC BOARD. ''U\s Awarded, Number of College Teams Limited and Other Mat- ters Considered. -. --· --- At a meeting of the Athletic Board held la<:;t F'riday evening, the baseball schedule for this spring ·was approved with the exception of the N. Y. u. gam:::, A1pril 21st. This w:ill be changed if possible to M1ay 2'0th, but if not,. it will be dropped, inasn1uch as there are at ,present four games during a period of eight day.s at this time. There were son1e am-endments to Faculty rules gov ~ rning· athletics, approved by the board. T'hese were in regard to lilllliting the num:ber of athletic teams so that there will lJe but thn:e classes of tean1s, viz,: Varsity, Second, and Cla::;3 T'eams. Thus all the teams will be under th·2 direct supervision of the Athletic Board. This li:miting of the tean1s was don2 in order to clo a way with the promiscuous temns that are fonn- ed, .and usually reflect very little credit upon the college. The following eight 1nen were awarded the \·U\ for basketball: Starbucl{, W. Brown, Buck, Leon, Charest, Hequem'bourg, Micl<s, and Clowe. The \a.U.a for basketball was awarded to Pettit and .Johnson of the M~dical ·School. . A report was given by th2 delegates, Dr. MicGomber and ,Mgr. La Roche, of the n1eeting of the N. Y. ·S. I. A. U., which was held in Utica on lVI;1.rch 7th. At the next meeting of this union there will be discussed and voted upon, an am- endment to th2 rules, providing that all members in the league m1ake out a full schedule on foot- ball, haseball, basketball, and track, with all other c.olleges in the league. There are at pres~nt five colleges in the union-·Ham.ilton, Colgate, Roches- ter, Hobart, and Union. This step is taken so that the league will b: .strengthened and will be of real in1portance to all of the colleges in it. Ail effort is als-o being made to make Utica the place for holding all track n1eets in the future. It was voted to place s2venty-five dollars at the disposal of a \Di.an1ond Con1mittee,'' con- sisting· of Prof. Opdyke, Mr. E. T. Grout, and Mgr. LaRoche for the purpose of getting and l{eeping

In .reference to baseball this year, an alumnus has expressed his opinion that funds can be read- ily ·1De obtained to hire .a baseball coach for this season. The name of !Mlr. Cregan an old alumnus has been suggesLd for coach. The matter has been placed in the hands of a commdttee consist- ing of Prof. Garris, •M 1 gr. LaR·oche, and Capt. Hildreth. ---1-t-f.-----,____..-- ABSENCE R'ULE·S REVISED. Preliminary Examinations Abolished, and a Committee on Excuses Created. At a meeting of the .faculty held ccently it wa.s unanimously decided that the rules governing- absenc€s were entirely inadequate to check the pro1niscuous \overbolting\ which has been for some tinre prevalent. To this end thG old rnh s were revised and made more d·1:astic. The 1nost radical change under the new rul- ing is the com 1 plete abolishl11':nt of preli:rninary examinations. H:ereafter only such ;york will lJe n1ade up as is actually missed by absence, ancl at such a tin1e during· the term as th(j head of the department d·z.·crees. M·oreover, a Go1n:nittee on Absenc~s is provi<1- ed which will have entire charge of the issuance of excuses. This .committee, which is compos~ .1 of Dr. Ellery, Prof. 1 Mlarch and Prof. I~ergus~:1, will Ineet every Monday afternoon fronl :~ to 5 o' clocl{ in the ehemical laboratory for che c:Oli.- sideration of absences. The entire set of absence rules here::tfter in vogue, follows: 1. Attendance at all exercises is required.; and it is ex·pected that no student will 1Je absenl·, except in case of unavoidablt:· necessity. To pro- vide for such cases of necessity, students will be allowed, each term, .as n1any absences without excuse in any subject, .as there are rc:·ci tations pe·r week in that subject. But this rule does not a:pply to examinations, or to recitations just be- fore or after vacation or recess, or to any c1as.:; as a whole at any tinT2·, and it is not to be .interpreted as rem·itting any part of the total work ·Of the term. \2. After the limit set in. t11e last paragraph has beeB ~reached, however, as well as in those cas~ .. s where the rule as stated does not apply, excuses n1ay be granted only by the Absence Committee of the :B..,aculty. N:D· excuse will be granted except for protracted Hl ness, or for rea- sons in ev:·ry way exceptional; ancl no ex·cuse will be given to provide for difficuHies caused by the use of tbe allowance for unnecessary pur·poses. No ·excuse I~emits any work .of the term. \3. 'The work lost ·by reasoN. of an allowed absence or an excused absence must be ma_de up in a manner satisfactory to the head of the depart- ment coneerned, unless the nat-ure of the work renders t:lds ilnpossible, in wlvich case the stu- dent's grade win suffer. \4. .Any absence not allowed or excused will ronnt as a .failure. \5. ·A.fter a number of uRexcussed absences equal to two weeks of recitations in that subject, the student will not be allowed to continue his WOl'k in that SUbject, but :must take it wjth the sncceedine; c1Dr.q\ CfiARTERED 1834 THE SCHENECTADY SAVINGS BANK Cor.

THE CONCORDIENSIS IS BASEBALL PROSPIECT'S BR[Gf:[T. Pitchers' Staff to Be Strengthened by Albany Department. ------ Baseball activity for the season was in- augerated last Thursday afternoon when the first call for candidates for the baseball team was is- sued. The following tnen responded: Clarke, King, Hoffn1an, Vogt, Bergan, Perry, Stark, L:a- Due, Stewart, Dennis, Anderson, Kelley, Tobin, vV\oodward, Duscherer, Bray, Chad wicl<:, O'Connell, Dunn and w·anace. Both Thursday and Friday afternoons, the candidates were worked out in the gymnasilun, throwing and catching. Captain Hildr~ th ex- pressed hin1self as bei mg very well pleased with the prospects for a winning tea1n and further- more, stated that U1e' various positions would be well supplied with players from the large num- uer of candidates. The position of pitcher which, it was hitherto though would be unsatisfactorily filled, would un- doubtedly 'be succec1sfully taken by eandidrutes frmn the Albany Departments of the Coll~ge. Win- slow, from the Law School, have registered for this of the IM.edical ~School, h1ave registered for this position and will, without doubt, add materially to the strength of .the Garnet's pitching staff. Outdoor training bas already begun, a strong squad is out, and, ev::. ryone doing his best, there is no reason why we should not turn out a team creditable to Old Union. --------- ADDITIONS TO BASEBALL SCHEDULE. ----- Manager La Roche of the basketball team has announced the addition of two more gamf: 1 S to the basketball sched 11le as recently published: Colgate will be played on Mlay 2 at Clinton, and on Mjay 23, the .FJ.dison Club will line up again~.,t the Garnet te~m on the can1pus.
