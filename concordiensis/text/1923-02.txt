The recent examinations cer.fainlyl did accomplish two very definite results-(1) they left the facudty a little freer to tend to each of us individually, and (2) they prohibited certain indivicl uals from con t·inuing to waste their time \vi thin these classic halls. But if these vvere the only results obtained, all of us might justifiably mutter, \'Well. what of it?\ Preparation for an exam compels the student to correlate logi- cally for instant reproducbion a \vide variety of facts. It is true that to pass a quiz creditably requires a clear understanding of values and proper ord·ers. But further than that, the student should remem- ber that the examination is given for his instruction and not for that of his ~professor. The professor who gives an examination is in the position of the parent who administers a span1{ing for the good of the child. Not that the spanking is arty sort of compensation, but it is a mighty impressive ,\·ay of compelling retrospection and intro- spectfotl.. The amount of knowledge or ignorance you display on your pa·per is seldom a startling disclosure to the professor, nor indeed, is that the directing intention. College students have not passed that age when self-inspection and appreciation are inclined to be rather o•verly optimistic and immature. The \well what of it\ of the exam- inat~on comes in this yery demand it makes upon proper and more exact introspection. The moving finger has ·written and has moved on, but for all of us ther.e is the handwriting on the wall of Miss Ely's office which can he most instructive.

CHAIRMAN JUNIOR BANQUET ·COMMITTEE At the last class meeting the juniors voted unanimously to hold .a class ha·n- qttet. The success of last year's ban- quet held at the Kenmore 'hotel in Albany induced the members of '24 to again trust themse]y.es to gather to- gether at a festive board arranged by a banquet committee. President Alvin Nitchman has appointed the following men to serve on the committee 1 Willard Augustus Pleuthner, chair- man Clark Winship Slade. Harold Jrohn Potts. Donald Clute M-acintosh. N·o definite date has been set for this affair, but it will come sometime between Soiree and Junior Prom. The committee expects to run a banquet that will ·be a pleasant memory to •ev- ery member of the class. Several radical and pleasing inno-.,nations will find expression in the course of the evening. All juniors are requested to start training their bill folds and ap- petites for this event.

Deim, '25 Tuesday, February 20, 1923 \The trouble is not so much that too many men are going to college as that often the wrong kind of men are going.\-President Faunce of Brown University. FACTIONS (From The February Alumni Monthly) The underlying causes of such a condition of factional grouping are harder to describe than the condition itself. It is natural for boys and men to break I into -groups, a:nd for s·ocial purp1oses few would wis·h to have it otherwise. Still, even so. there is always a certain danger which should be :recognized and fought a,gainst, and we see it in t'he grouping at Union now where the division is som·ew~at aLong s·ocial. lines. Again, ability and <_tmb_itio~ in a given gro.up 1 of boys wtll ·of-ten lead· them to grab every college off1ce tn stght, and thus ra1se against them a jealousy that in extreme cases does not hesitate to injure the college itself if, by so doing, opponents may be discredited. It is hard to con- demn ambition and :ability, and yet moderation in this race for office is often of greater service to the college than the hard work entailed in winning many offices. The writer feels that, most of all, we must blame the selfishnes-s, so marked a feature -of this day. The ·essence of college spirit is willingness to serve, that the larger unit (in this case the college) may benefit. It is pretty evident that nowadays the balance is tipped a way from this attitude and toward self-interest to a lam~ntable degree. The fundamental problem is to move the hearts of our boys so that they may see and feel ·rightly about •thes.e matters. The present cas-e is obvious. A factious spirit is developing and already work- ing harm, and if nat checked is bound to work perhaps serious harm. The way to combat it, however, is far from obvious. .. ALL ALONG 0' DOIN' THINGS RATHER! .\t l·nion enlle~~~R=y ~!eg:.~;;:· is always an over-! worked g-r-oup of men who hotel many undergraduate offices-too j many offices to efficiently administer them all. The man who is,. willing and ahle to do good work always has greater demands upon·. hjs time than he can properly satisfy. Ancl there is no reason to i believe that it will ever he otherwise. Some colleges have found it' necessary to evoke some Yariety -of \point system\ in order to arrive at some equitable distribution of the work entailed in filling coHege offices. This is not a condi-tion characteristic of or restricted to the college: it is simply human nature to try to fill every proffered honor, especially 'vhen there is some fraternal o1·ganization which I is to catch something of the reflected glory. Various writers of a'bility discussing interfraterni'ty friendship have admitted that there is a factional feeling here at college which is a subtle detraction ·from the success that might very well he expected to attend undergraduate activities. The Alumni Monthly in the preceding abstract has attrributecl any present scism between the fraternities to the \ambition in a given group of bGys that wi-11 o.ften lead them to grab every college honor in slight\. It must be admitted in all fairness that college honors do have a most annoying, habit of hei-ng segregated among one or two crowds. Such a con- dition exis·ts everywhere and always has existed at Union. The healthy sign is tJwt this halance of power shifts loca1:ion from year to year. As Charley \Valdron says, \it is hard to condemn ambition and ability\. Kor does it seem advi·sable to limit this ambition expressed in the race for office. Not so.much is it moderation that is needed ati the proper direction of effort s0 that \the larger unit (in this case always respected; 1t IS dt:fhdence and mabthty whtch earn oppos1t10n banquet in addlition to those already for themselves. · named were Sam H.

They Weighed A if- and Charles II Laughed AMUEL PEPYS says in his diary that Charles II, for all his interest in the Royal Society, laughed uproariously at its members ''for spenaing their time only in weighing of air and doing nothing else since they sat.'~ This helps to explain why Charles has come down to us as the ''merry monarch.\ The Royal Society was engag.ed in important research. It was try- ing to substitute facts for the meaningless phrase \nature ab- hors a vacuum/' which had long served to e:xpla.in why water rushes into a syringe-the com- monest form of pump--when the piston is p:ulled out. Denis Papin had as much to do as anyone with these laughable activities of the Royal Society. Papin turned up in London one day with a cylinder in which a piston could slide. He boiled water in the cylinder. The steam gener- ated pushed the piston out. When the flame was removed, the steam General 9eneral Of.f~ce c·om condensed. A vacuum was formed and . the weight of th~ outer .air forced the um:esisting piston in. Out of these researches eventu- ally came the steam engine. London talked of the scandalous life that King Charles led, and paid scant attention to such physicists as Papin, whose work did so m:ucb. to change the whole character of industry. The study of air and air pumps has been .continued in spite oi Charles 7 s laughter. In the General Electric Company's Research Laboratories, for instance, pumps have been developed which will ex;. haust all but the last ten-billionth of an atmosphere in a ves~el. Thjs achievement marks the beginning ofa n.ew kind of chemis- try-a chemistry that concerns itself with the effect of forces on matter in the absence of air; a chemistry tha~ :has alrea<l-y en- riched the world with invaluable improvements in illumination, ra- dio communication, and roentg~n- o1ogy. · Eledlric any Scktner:tady.,N;Y.

Editor's Nate : The following editorial may be objected to on several grounds ; perhaps because a college newspaper is not the proper vehicle for such criticism or because the argument is loose. All communications on th~ subject will be welcome. The conductance of chapel services at Union college should be al~olishecl. Such meetings are not attended with the slightest bit of reverence; it would seem impossible for the man of college age to slough off the inquiring- atti.tnde of the classroom or the jocular air of the fraternity house by merely entering the chapel bu1Ming. Nor can it he remonstmted that this irreverence toward chapel attend- ance is an indication of the degeneration of the new generation. We quote from The Concordiensis of 1881: \\vVe have but a word or two tu say with regard to the conduct of students in chapel. We do not have to tax our memory to recal·l scenes enacted in chapel of a positively disgraceful character. * * * There are a few, how- ·ever, who devote their time and attention while in chapel to their lessons. * * * That is not as it should be. All should take an interest in these exercises.'' Today the students in attendance at chapel can be catalogued as th<.\y \Vcrc forty-four years ago. There are the students with the playful dispositions who throw snowba,lls and hymn books without discrimination. There are those who study or read throughout the seni.cc and prayer. There may he a dozen who maintaih a reveren- tial attitude in spi,te of the· discouraging surroundings. And since there is no reverential atmosphere, but rather one which cont.radicts college.
