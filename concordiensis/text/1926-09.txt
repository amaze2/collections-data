In its own vast plants the handling and moving of materials and prod- ucts have been simplified to the highest degree, thus provid- ing a daily demonstration of the value of electricity. A series of G-E advertisements showing what electricity is doing in many fields will be sent on request. Ask for book. let GEK-1. A button is pressed. An electric motor goes to work, followed by another and still others until hventy sections -of a belt conveyor four miles long are in operation! 1'hrough an abandoned mine runs this giant wheelbarrow carrying nine thousand tons of coal per day in a steady stream from the miners to the coal barges on the Monon'\' gahela Rive:r. One roan controls it withilo more effort or concern than pressing a switch button. Electricity pushes it. Not only ~onveyor belts of all sizes\ shnpes and kinds, but also hoists, trac-tors, cranes, elevators, stackers, loco1notives, and other material- handling equipment have gained flexibility, dependability, and ease of control through electric motorization. Moving things in one way or another is the educated man's work in life. And electricity, ever at his command, is moving more and still more of the things which move this new world of ours. 7-5:ma.

hows~. ancl with FalJ the New Homes For Three Fraternities T.hr.ee f:r;aternities of the college l1ave moved into new homes tl1is year. One of these, Kappa Nu has located in the \Pitkin\ residence at Union ave- nue and Union street. Alpha Gamma · Phi have talren over a new home at 1054 University place. Zeta Beta Tau, : the third to move its quarters, is back in the Old Gym Donn. All of these : fraternities have had chapters at Union for some time, one of them, Al· pl1a Gamma Phi, being founded here. Kappa Nu first formed a chaptt'r here in 1917 and has grown steadily since. It now comprises 22 active members. For a number or years tlw chapter had occupied the south sf'ction of North College. The new h0ID•3 is of more than passing interest, in thRI it has been the residence of the rresi- dent of the American Locomo1ive Works, the home of :Mr. J. R. Lovf'joy, vice-president of the General Elertric Company, and that it conlftins thE: \Roosevelt Room,\ a room in one of the towers, where President Roosevelt always stayed during his visits here. Kappa Nu has maintained a high stanclard of scholarship, and is active in campus affairs. Alpha Gamma Phi was founded in South College in 1919. Thi!:l l'ralemity has a remarlmble scholastic record, ' having won U1e Berg cup fo:· :3cholar- ship during the past six cor>secutive years. In June, 4 of it!:' mt•mllr-r:-: were· elected to Sigma Xi. Fcu1~· or its me,u- bers are on the faculty: :\Tr Powell, Mr. Steinert, Mr. Ha.efnRr and Mr. Pal- ermo. The chaptee now nnmber~ 22 men. Zeta Bela Tau has mc,Yecl hac!\ i~11o its former home in the Qlr1 Gym Dorm, where it hacl its quarter,; before moving to. Union stre6t la·;t ~·e:-\1', Zeta· Beta Tau has a good ret,utntion on th0 campus, having had s~vr~1·al Tt'!Tace Councilmen in the ].'last. Tlw chapter! is small at present, bein~ macle uv of fivt~ active men and four p leclg-e£<s.

For no other cigarette was ever so friendly, so loyal as Cunei. The unfathomed goodness, the deep underlying quality of Camel tobaccos ts ever-dependable. The world's largest tobacco Oi:· ganization buys the best of every- thing for Camels. The choicest T udd.sh and Domestic tobaccos grown. The kind of b1ending that only such a group of experts could give. Regardless of what you are willing to pay~ there is no other cigarette like Camel; there can be no bette:r cigarette made than Camels. Camels never tire the taste, no matter how indefatigably you smoke them, never leave a dgaretty after-taste. If you don't yet know Camel enjoyment, just sample the tnost exquisite fragrance that ever came from a cigarette. Ha'Jle a Camel! R. J. REYNOLDS TOBACCO COMPANY, WINSTON-SALEM, N. C.
