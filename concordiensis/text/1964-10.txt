IFC Contetnplates ~ush Rule Changes By AI Nahmias The Interfraternity Council turned most of its atten- tion toward the new rushing rules at Tuesday's meeting. The Council passed a motion banning freshmen from fra- ternity houses before 8 P.M. on Saturday of Homecoming Weekend. The original motion, made by Phil Evans, called for the exclusion of Freshmen from fraternity houses for the entire day on Saturday. Gary Morris amended the mo- tion to read that freshmen would be able to visit houses after 8 P.M. The reason for this motion was<P--------~----­ to enable fraternity men to de- vote their attention to the Alum- ni. Homecoming is one of the few opportunities fraternities have to socialize with their Alum- ni.

Goldberg A new Chapter in the book of Union College FootbaU was begun last Saturday in Canton, New York where the Garnet defeated St. Law- rence University 16-9. Un- ion's gridders were an ag- gressive, alert team, charac- terized by a hard charging line and a gang tackling de- . fense. They made few mis- cues while taking advantage of their opponents mistakes. The Garnet will have :to pla::,y equally well tomorrow, for they will meet an Alfred team that is vastly improved over last year•s team. Last Saturday the .Sax:ons evened their record at 1-1 witll a 20-0 victory over Brockport. In defeating Brockport, they end- ed a 7 game losing streak and also scored their first points in 8 games. Not since the Uni():rt game a year ago had Alfre.d scored a point. Both the Garnet and Saxons have discovered that victory is sweet and neither will want to lose that new-found feel- ing. Offense Moves Well From Coach Flood's basic Win.g T, a good ground attack was gen~ erated to support the fabulous passing of quarterback Torn Hitchcock. The junior quarter- back called and passed a master- ful game. St. Lawrence was kept off balance throughout the gante due to Hitchcock's play selectiolU!l, He completed 11 out of 14 pa~ses for 120 yards against St. L.tlw- rence.

Union's defense, led by the line- backing of Bob DeMichele. F1·ed Thomas, and Tom Morgan, cotn- pletely dominated St. Lawrence•s offense. Also helping to throttle St. Lawrence's offense was the kicking of Hurlbut that kept St. Lawrence in the shadow of their own goal for much of the day. Union's offense showed it coul<l (Continued on Page 6) Frosh Given RushingRul~~ Representatives of Interfrater- nity Council met with the fresh- men class in Memorial Chapel on Wednesday, to announce the rule::; for formal rushing.

Assistant Copy Editor Assistant F~atures Editor Frosh Hazing The issue of frosh hazing has once again reared its ugly head on the campus. Over the lone dissenting vote cast by David Braff, the Student Council last week passed an \emergency\ motion recommending to the administra- tion that a \limited form of sophomore harassment be reinstituted for next year's orientation week.\ We submit that this action was hasty and ill advised. The motion stated \whereas: this year's orientation week proved to be boring and unproductive for the freshman and whereas: the consensus o.f campus opinion showed that there definitely was a lamentable void in orientation week , ... (hazing should be reinstated.)\ It seems to us that there is a lamentable void on the Student Council if all but one of its members feels that the only way to stop Orien- tation Week from being boring and unproductive is by harassing the freshmen. Is it not conceivable, as Mr. Braff pointed out, that some positivE' programming might ov<'r- come Orientation Week boredom? And what is so pro- ductive about harassment? If the council had seen fit to wait and see what effect the new Orientation Program was going to have on the beginning the frosh would make in the academic area, they might not have acted as they did. Dean Pollock reports that several faculty members have said that this year's frosh have buckled down to serious work more quickly than in the past. These faculty members attributed the improvement to the different tone and atmosphere of this year's Orientation Program. We are sorry the council judged this motion worthy of \emergency\ handling procedures. Certainly the next orientation period is not close enough to warrant such measures. Would not the council have done better had it appointed a committee to investigate all the programming possibilities that an orientation week provides? We would like to offer some suggestions for future orientation programs. 1) reinstitute the orientation counsellor variety show which has always been a highpoint of orientation week in the past. Z) Schedule a film similar to those in the Friday Film Series and show it in Memorial Chapel to fill a lull in the schedule. 3) Have some form of frosh-soph athletic rivalry such as the tug of war during the orientation period. 4) allow the freshmen certain periods when they can go off campus during the week. 5) have Professor Winne give his famous Jackson's Garden speech as part of the orientation program. We welcome further suggestions as to how to con- structively improve orientation week and will print any suitable suggestions received. Fall Weekend It has been called to our attention that Josh White, who is to appear in Memorial Chapel Saturday night, Oc- tober 31, as part of the Fall Weekend program, will also appear seven days earlier at an R.P.I. concert. We hope this sort of thing can be avoided in the future so that those Russell Sage girls concerned need not sit through the same concert for two weeks in succession. A Good Beginning We would like to congratulate Head Football Coach George Flood on his successful debut last week at St. Lawrence, and wish him the best of luck for the weeks ahead. .. Fridcey, October 2, 1964 t Friday, 0 ·--- Letters to the Editor Cantpus Calendar M(J '·'Fo~ To the Editor of Coneordiensis: It is unfortunate that Mr. Sei- fert's obvious attempt at humor during the recent Student Coun- cil meeting was taken so seriously. Concern over the deplorable \lack of freshman harassment\ cannot d . ' un er any mrcumstances, be con- sidered a situation of h·eme grav- sidered a situation of extreme gravity. If we are to continue to assure each other of our manhood and adulthood during our stay at this institution, as seems to be the custom, it is somewhat inconsist- ent to continue to behave like childish, ape-like imbeciles. No one, apparently, stopped to con- sider the degree of usefulness of meaning inherent in this fervent desire to haze and harass incom- ing students. It is time to call an end to this annual display of barbarism and neurotic hostility. Pound the wall, gentlemen, swear at your parents, but please re- spect the dignity of other indi- viduals on this campus . No rationalization of this ri- diculous ritual can conceal the fact that the \lam~mtable void\ described in the emergency mo- tion refers not to orientation week, but to the mentality of those who joyfully support this mens m·r. The final decision to request a limited form of harassment indi- cates only that our ambiguous hatreds are becoming more re- fined, because no serious consid- eration of this matter, viewing the changing nature of the Un- ion freshman and the evolving maturity of the college atmo- sphere, could support the feel- ings of those favoring hazing. Doug· LaBier '65 EDITOR'S SOTE: An editorial on this topic ap- pears in this issue. To the Editor of Concordiensis: A note appeared on the bul- letin board in Bailey Hall the other day with a reference to \Leftist oriented political science courses.\ At first glance I smil- ed, but serious thought has led L<• eoneetn over that that phrase's \·alidity. \Leftist oriented'?\ Per- haps the term is somewhat too strong, howe\·er with careful consideration I have reviewed my g&vernment courses over three years at l:nion. The names: Bucldey, Hayek, Taft, Rossiter, Kirk, Dos Passos, Bozell, Burn- ham, Chambers, etc. have been missing, not because their writ- ings were outside the content of the courses, but rather that they were intentionally ignored by the Politica•l Science Department. I wish to express my sincere faith in the competence -of those professors in the department and their willingness to help a stu- dent. However as a conservative my voice cries out in a liberal environment, \Where is the other side?\ It is a wonder that there are any conservatives left at Union, for this criticism includes all of the social science courses. I sup- pose, however, a political philos- ophy, although it may suffer the ringing criticism of a goodly num-ber of profes-sors, is more deeply ingrained than what the fleeting words of a liberal lec- turer can destroy. I am not crusading for sterile objectivity in the classroom, but I plead gentlemen of the faculty, let the other side be heard. William P. McGovern '65.

As I reached the end of this long string of marble monu- ments, I noticed a little plaque in the grass, which I was told was Stalin's tombstone. Leningrad Visited I found Leningrad to be much more pleasant than Moscow. It has a very different appearance, quite natural since much of the city was built by Italian .archi- tects. It too is a huge city with wide streets and spacious squares. You can walk across the gigantic square where the czar's soldiers shot at the people and the Revo- lution began. Leningrad is un- fortunately becoming one big slum. Nothing is being restored or rebuilt. There are many parks in Leningrad, as in Moscow, which for some reason, are called \parks of rest and culture.\ They seem- ed to me to be just like any parks over here. I'm certainly no judge of ballet, but I won't hesitate to say that the ballet which I saw in Lenin- grad (not one of the more fam- ous companies) was, to put it mildly, absolutely terrible. Every few minutes the peasant-hero would run across the stage and beat up the mean old tsar. They had a rematch during the curtain calls. The audience loved it. The Leningrad Minsk soccer game wasn't too exciting, but I found the audience very inter- esting. People clapped and jeered at different times but were other- wise silent. Upon leaving the stadium I noticed a poster on one of the gates-a picture of a man standing over the world with a tremendous hammer and smash- ing missiles, which were sticking up all over the surface. On the way back to the hotel I saw an- other poster-a picture of a sub- mal'ine firing missiles. Russia's People I found that the people were, in general, extremely friendly. They stare at you unceasingly, but I found that their curiosity is almost always not mixed with ill-will, although a man once cursed me for wearing a bright red wool sweater (my guide in- terpreted for me and then bawled him out-he thought I was too rich. Younger people often ap- proached me in public and asked in English if I had any clothing to sell them. Children often stop and ask you two words \Chewing g·um ?\ They love it but it is not made in Russia. Everyone who smokes had tried American cigarettes, and won't hesitate to ask you for a few packs.

Freshmen should become in- terested in what fraternity men are like, getting around and in- specting as many fraternities as possible, and above all obeying rushing rules carefully. With regard to this weekend's mixer with Russell Sage, the Dean hop- ed that all freshmen would be able to g·et the girls back to their buses by 12:00 P.M.-in time to make the late curfew at Russell Sag!'.

Tallies came via Gary Brown, with an assist from Greg Olsen in the first quarter, G~eg Olsen, with a boot from outs1de the penalty area and Larry Fab- ian with an assist from Frank W~lter in the second quarter. The s~cond half saw this lead dwindle to one goal, as rough playing in front of the Gar!let goal gave Oneonta three scormg shots However, the men from Oneo~ta could only capitalize on two of the three penalty shots, and the Garnet hung on to the slim margin. Coach Bi11 Ketz, staiting his 34th year at Union, is basing his hopes on Ring, Campman,. Morris and Hunt in the top four posi- tions. Dave Ring, a junior runner, is in good form this yea1· and hopes are that he can capture a good number of first places in the six matches scheduled fo1· this season. Sophomore Neil Camp- man, Senior Gary Morris, and junior Bill Hunt will also be heavily relied on for scoring con- tributions. Adding depth to the squad are Juniors Dave Bruce and Bill Stoner and Sophomores John Peters, Ed Monfred and Spencer Hunt. With the addition of the newcomers and the im.pl·oved form of the returnees, it is hoped that the team can better last year's 1-4 record. ------ Frosh Booters Edge U of R, 2-1 \Cnion's freshman soccer team successfully opened its season Saturday by downing the Univer- sity of Rochester freshmen by a score of 2-1.

It was hard to believe that the team that defeated Oneonta, 3-2, in a game that was played un- der a constant drizzle Tuesday afternoon, was the same one that looked so inept against Rochester under fair skies last Saturday. • ~La . ~ Inl While Union's other eleven was moving its ball well against St. Lawrence at Canton, N. Y. the Beaudrymen were unuable to build up an offensive threat at all.

The fact that Oneonta was not nearly as strong as Rochester must not be overlooked. This alone would not cause the change in the character of Union's s<X!cer that was observed. Injuries to a number of experienced upperclass- g· men have made it possible (or actually necessary) for a number of soph.omores to assume starting positions. One game of varsity competition can give an able athlete the finesse he needs. Even play- ers with experience are more nervous for a season opener than for other contests.

Sugp The Co by natim fig-ht tha * Perha}ls the blame for a poor showing against Rochester is at least in pait due to poor planning in the Garnet athletic de}lal-tment. • When one considers the conditions which Coach Beaud1·y has faced in rounding the squad into shape it is certainly a tribute to him that a rel!sonably well organized unit did not collapse before the final gun was on the field. The hooters played their first scrimmage against Albany State witl1 only six days of practice. I doubt that I any member of the athletic staff would deem that period sufficient for conditioning, much less organizing a potent offense and defense. I Selection of personnel fo1· positions seems a tough job to be crammed into that little time as well. e Premature Opening A week later the Dutchmen opened their season against the ll Yellowjackets. A disorganized attack was quite evident, but out- standing hustle and determination on defense yielded a respectable performance in which the score was certainly not an accuurate in- dication of the effort involved. At any rate, this writer wonders why the soccer team did not begin practice sessions as early as the gridders do. The excuse that the funds were not available is certainly a hollow one. A de-em}lha- sis on Union athletics is one thing, but chancing injuTies is another. t) Athletes should at least be given the opportunity to show their pr:Jwess at the peak of ability rather than the depths.

Keat- ing, United States Senatorial candidate campaigning for re-election, has announced .through the Students-for- .. Keating Committee that he will give an address at the Union C o ll e g e Memorial Chapel on October 16, at 1:00 P.M. Senator Keating, a graduate of the University of Rochester and I Han ani Law Srhool, served in 1 the House of Representatives for twe In~ years before his election to the Senate in 1958. He is a member of a Committee on the Judiciary, the Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences und the Special Committee on Aging. Keating Withholds Support Although Senator Keating is running on the Republican ticket he has not given any support t~ S~n~tor Goldwater's campaign. Similarly, Senator Keating has not announced support for Presi- ctent .Johnson and is expected to remam neutral in the Presidential race. Current leaders of the Keat- ing campaign on campus, James Upton and Alon Jeffrey, ex- PI'essed their appreciation to Keating for accepting their invitation to speak on cam- pus. Both maintained that Keat- ing \represents the responsible wing of the Republican party.\ They also noted that Senator Keating has a fine voting rec- Ol'd, to which his opponent, Rob- ert Kennedy, does not object. Bv virtue of his independence from the Goldwater party, Keating \woud not be subject to boss- c>ontrol as would his opponent Upton noted. Students for Keat~ ing- expressed the hope that there wou·ld be a large turnout fot· Keating's address. Candidates Cover State Tlle campaign between Senator Keadng and Kennedy has thus far seen the two candidates tra- versing the state to gain votes. The choice is between two men who appear to favor the same policies and the choice is also be- tween a proven senator and a man of high capabilities. . The fac~ that Kennedy is an mterloper mto New York politics has received a lot of mention. However, the issue does not seem to be overly important in the campaign, although both candi- dates have spent considerable time on it. . Senator .Keating has obviously been handicapped by his refusal to support the national Republi- can ticket. The challenge posed by lJoth Clare Booth Luce and Paul Fino certainly weighed heav- ily on Keating. Keating has been r-:c~ived warmly, although by sig- mficantly smaller crowds than his rival. However, all is not well in the Kennedy camp either. Kennedy has received large turn- ol.lts whet·ever he has gone, but his supporters wonder just how much these turnouts can be trans- f~r~ed into support at the polls. Similarly, Kennedy, although he (Continued on Page 5)

2 Faculty Column: In Guatemala By Prof. William Bristol I don't know whether the most nerve-shatteri-ng experience 1 have gone through z·eel'ntly was having my pocket picked in Guate- mala a few weeks ago or witnessing, as a native of PhBadE'lphia, the late lamented decline and demise of the Phillies.

U is a brutal work that explores the depths of human degradation. An atmosphere of cold indifference weaves itself within the fabric of the . film, making it u shocking and agonizing experience for the viewer. 1 ., ,. Sena1 I ''only\ dil 1 no mean \The Silence\ is the last part of a trilogy in which Bergman continues his quarrel with God that was begun in \'Through a Glass Darkly\ and \Winter Light.\ In his previous symbolic gropings into the nature of the s<:ml and of faith, he seems to have concluded lhat belief in a mysterious and merciless god is absurd. In this, his latest work, he depicts the silence within his characters when faith is dead. Simple Plot The plot is simple. During wartime, two sisters and a young boy a1·e delayed during their journey through some unnamed Euro- pean country when Esther, the older sister, is taken ill. They a1·e confronted with a strange languag·e and unsympathetic sur1•oundings. Once they are e·stablishe-d in a hotel, the conflict that is created by ' the sexual incompatability of the two women is graphically por- tl·ayed. Each sister has a passion which disgusts the other. As the film ends, the younger sister, Anna, and the boy leave Esther to die in the hotel room. Esther's Tm·ment Esther finds no pleasure in the company of men and tries to lavish her sensual desire-s {)n an unwilling Anna.

Dl 6-9644 3 Conversati.on Views: National Affairs By Richard Sifton For some reason, it has become fashionable in this country to accept the ea~iest ,.ol11tion~ to !oral p1·oblems-that is, to turn them over to the fec!f:'ral gove1 nment. Tho~e who insist that only the federal go,·ernment can re~pon,-ibly h:-mdle individual uffairs seem to have had theit· v\·ay the;;e pa::<t four years. It mi~ht, therefore, be advisable to review present tttbni nist1·ation [>oliciPs in order to de- termine just how nsp()nsible they arP. Of immediate interest to Htudents is the Aid to Education Art. This moderately expensive p1ognun prumi::;t•s help to those higlwr educational institutions whi·ch presm t extensive enlaq.~ement projects. Hence, the small liberal arts <\ollcge is being pressured to expancl significantly, thereby losing its ch.uractcr. It is easier to accept federal aid than to t•emain basic--ally independent. It is no coinci- dence that a number of traditionally small colleges, such as Trinity, announced rapid ex.pansion programo within month~ of the signing· of the Aid to Education Act. Several observations can be made: the amoUnt of money which each college might receive for new buildings may not offset the problems an expansion program creates in terms of hiring new faculty and enlarging endowments. The new Act overlaps to a great extent such programs as the NSF which are designed to answer a college1s. immediate needs rather than tG foster future ones; corpor- ations, which pay very high income taxes, still find more and more money available for research programs at many colleges. Medicare The so-called Medicare prog1·am has been grossly misrepresented by its sponsors. In Canada, France and Great Britain there have rectntly been riots in protestation against federally run health pl'O- grams. The proposed program in this country would raise individual payments into social security by l'oughly 30 per cent. Many people (in fact, most) will never even redeem the money that they havP paid into the prog1·am under the present rates. The AMA is against Medieare. Yet, with all of these rather obvious distress signals fly- ing·, the present administration feels an urgent, \sincet·e\ responsi- bility to superimpose an unnecessary program onto existing (and increasingly active) private ones. Many people hailed the reduction of Amel'ican tariffs under Kennedy and now, Jo·hnson. There is only one slight hitch: these re- ductions have caused a tremendous influx of cheap foreign goods, particularly textiles, which in tum haYe forced literally dozens of American producers into bankruptcy. In manr small communitieF<, particularly in Ne·w England nncl in the South, to:dilc mills are thE' only si~rnificant sourcros of income. T<>d::t)''s dct.ims of present tariff policies are tomOITO\I·'s new disaste1· areas. As for trade with the SoYiet Union, remember the great Wheat Deal. A group of American businessmen wanted to buy surplus government wheat-at a fraction of the price which the government had paid farmers for it___,in order to sell it to the Soviet Union at the world price, keeping the differl:'nce as their profit. At the same time, the governmE:nt was asked to extend Cl'edit to Russia, thereby assuming the debt responsibilities of the businessmen. The loan was to be secured by American taxpayers• money. And all because our bitterest enemy had botched its farm program in order to score propaganda victories against us in the space race. Unfortunately, the American taxpayer was not given the privilege of deciding whether Ol' not his money should be put to this rathe1· unique USE'. Morality A few words should be said ab<>ut public and private morality; or, better still, the lack of the same. There is no denying that John- son is pragmatic, skillful, and eloquent. However, one might ques- tion the morality of his motives in crammin?; through Congress and through Congressional Committees a series of unnecessary and ex- pensive bills. Tuming off the lights in the White House is admirable; putting venetian blinds on every exterior window of the Pentagon to cover the fact that all of the lights are on all nig·ht is something of a slightly different nature. l3obby Baker speaks for himself. Johnson's radio and television monoply in an area which contains 250,000 people speaks for itself. Large government contracts award- ed to companies in 1vhich Mrs. Johr1son owns stock (in trust, natur- ally) also speaks for itself. A question which might here be asked is this: if the moral leader of the free world cannot keep his own house clean, how can the American public expect him to sweep up the ga!'bage in Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, the Congo, and wherever else he is called upon to act? If the liberals in this country stopped to realize that their support is being purchased at a rather high price, they might begin to feel a little bit insulted.

Assistant Sports Editor Retire1nent Age Though Professor Winne's column (which appeared in the last issue of Concordiensis) was written with a par- tially tongue-in-cheek attitude, he raises ·so~e questions that are now plaguing m,any areas of our soCiety-how to provide a meaningful and pro.ductive life for. ~~e senior citizens that is in line with their present capabthtles. Professor Winne is fully aware that his broad genc- alization about all people over 55 being ready for the junk heap is false-yet, though many of our most dynamic edu- cators seem to be able to go on forever without losing any of their vitality, it is also true that many do lose th~ir effectiveness as the years wear on. The question is \what can be done about it?\ and there are no readily available answers. How can we keep those who have lost none of their ability and dismiss their colleagues who have become ineffective? One cannot ap- proach a man who has spent twenty years of his life at the college and tell him that he is no longer needed when his colleague, who is the same age but is still in top form, has his retirement postponed. True this may be better for the college but simple human decency requires that it is not done. This quality must never be sacrificed for effi- ciency's sake. British Election The extraordinary nature of our presidential election and the prospects for an unusually exciting New York sen- atorial race must not be allowed to blur our perspective of other important world events. In particular, the 25 million people in Great Britain who will this week choose a new government will, in part at least, also be voting on our relations with this most im- portant ally. Although the Concordiensis feels that it is out of place to take sides in this election, we do feel that students should be made aware of the significance of its outcome. The Amedcan student should acquaint himS€lf with the major differences which separate the Tories and Labor, on such basic issues as the United Nations, Britain's membership in the Common Market, and an independent deterrent force. However strongly we may feel about the historical importance of our own election, we must not forget that October 15 may itself be a decisive day in U. S. history. R.A. Weekend Incidents The events of the past weekend are another in a con- tinuing series of skirmishes between Union students and local hoods. We feel that the number of such incidents can be cut down if the fraternity houses would hire .a Burns Detective to stand at the door on party weekends. Many houses already follow this procedure and it would be wise if the IFC required it in the future. Student Council At the last meeting of the Student Council, Jack Sei- fert proposed the establishment of a Campus Communica- tions Committee to check up on (among other things) the various publications. The Council would be within its rights to say whether or not it likes a given publication. This might even be an effective means to keep the publication on its toes. But we hasten to remind them that there is a replacement for the publications board in the Faculty Committee on Student Affairs and it is within its province, not the council's, to issue any sort of directives to keep the publications in line.

He seem- ed to be a throwback from the current fairly progressive mood of the party to a past era-the Lo1•d at the head of the nation; his personality was not particu- larly well known, and what was kno\vn about him wasn't particu- larly good-he seemed to be a 'nice enough chap,' but a little vague and not particularly in- telligent, the image of the past Bdtish dilettante, 'amateur' dip- lomat, in fact. He was not known as a good debater, in ·sharp con- trast to both Macmillan and Wil- son; his record as F01·eign Sec- l'etary was not terribly impres- sive, especially in relation to the U.N. against which he had once spoken very strongly. Naturally, he would renounce his :peerage and sit in the Commons (thanks to the recent Peerage Act and a convenient by-election in a farm- ing county of .Scotland) but he hardly seemed suited to a Com- mons career. He was greatly misjudged, however. Although he has not been a dominant lead- er, he has managed by s-ome means or other to appeal to the public. Despite (or perhaps be- cause of) his blueblooded back- ground, and because of the gen- eral British dislike of intellectu- als in politics, his image as a plain, straightforward, natura~, easy-going type, who is seriously concerned about the future of Britain, and his playing down of the personal image in favor of the team of government have done his party a great deal of good, and the Labor Party quite a lot of harm. Harold Wilson On the surface there could scarcely be greater differences between the characters of Home and Wilson. The present Labor Patty leader is certainly one of the most brilliant political brains in the country, if not in the world; middle-class, born in the :\'orth of England, educated at a grammar school and Oxford Uni- Yersity (on a scholarship) where he gained a first-class degree in politi-cs and et•onomic$, u fellow of his college at 21, he became President of the Board of Trade in the post-war Labor g·overn- ment, and, as such, was largely in control of their nation-alisa- tion policies. During the Gait- skell party leadership he became lmo\vn as something of a radi- '<'al left-winger, harassing the centel' of the party on their na- tionalization committment, which it were trying to reduce. . The death of Gaitskell saw Wilson and George Brown, now his right- hand man, in direct competition for the leadership, a .struggle equally bi'bter as the more recent To1•y wrangle. It seemed as if the :party would veer leftward once again if Wil-son won; but he finally realized the importance of the center. He has been able to compromi·se; there has been a slight swing to the left, which has, generally, been a good thing for the party and for the two- pai-.ty system, as both parties had been so similiar at one point that the risk was of the growth of a center party and two far-out par- ties on the right and the lef.t. His present committment to na· tionalization goes no further than an undertaking to return the pri- vitte sectors of .the steel indus- try, a large part of which is still nationalized, and of road trans- port, to public ownership. Wilson's ability as a politician, ho1vever, may well lose him this election. T-o the public he seems tricky and too professional; his brilliant balancing act since the example, as we disembarked from dea:th of Gaitskell looks too much our rented outboard at a small (Continued from Page 2) • • like sheer opportunism to rnany. town beside the lake, a young- assumes towards sex is anti:the- He is perhaps too brillia11t; his lady came out on the dock and tical to pornography.

Professor Winne is fully aware that his broad gene..- alization about all people over 55 being ready for the junk heap is fal~e-yet. though many of our most dynamic edu- rators seem to be ablP to go on forever without losing any of their vitality, it is also true that many do lose their effectiveness as the years ·wear on. The question is \what can be done about it'?\ and there are no readily available answers. How can we keep those who have lost nom• of their ability and dismiss their colleagues who have become ineffective? One cannot ap- proach a man who has spent bventy years of his life at the college and tell him that he is no longer needed when his colleague, who is the same age but is still in top form, has his retirement postponed. True this may be better for the college but simple human decency requires that it is not done. This quality must never be sacrificed for effi- eiency's sake. British Election The extraordinarv nature of our presidential election and the prospects for ~n unusually exciting New York sen- atorial race must not be allowed to blur om· perspective of other important world events. In particular. the 25 million people in Great Britain who will this week choose a new government will, in part at least, also be voting on our relations with this most im- portant ally. Although the Coneordit>nsis feels that it is out of place to take sides in this election, we do feel that students should be made aware of the significance of its outcome. The American student should acquaint himself with the major differences \Vhich separate the Tories and Labor. on such basic issues as the United Nations, Britain's memben;hip in tht• C()mmun J.Iarket. and an independent ch•terrC'nt f urec•. Hmw\'l'r strongly wp may feel about the historical imp01tanee of our own election, we must not forget that OdobPr 1;) mav itself be a decisive davin C. S. historv. . . . R.A. Weekend Incidents The events of the past weekend are another in a con- tinuing- series of skirmishes between Union students and local hoods. We feel that the number of such incidents ean be eut down if the fraternity houses would hire a Burns Detective to stand at the door on party \Veekends. Many houses already follow this procedure and it would be ·wise if the IFC required it in the future. Student Council At the last meeting of the Student Council, Jack Sei- fert proposed the establishment of a Campus Communica- tions Committee to cheek up on (among other things) the various publications. ThP Council would be within its rights to say whether o1· not it likes a given publication. This might even be an dfedive means to keep the publication on its toC's. But we hasten to remind them that there is a replacemf'nt for the publications board in the Facult~· ('ommittt•p on S1udPnt Affairs and it is within its province, not the council's, to issue any sort of directives to keep the publications in line.

They prac- ticed diligently and conditioned themselves so that they woul'd not falter in the third period as they hud in the past. The NCAA, which evidently did nut appt·eciate folk music, passed new player substitu- ~. tion rules to thwart the eff01 t of the Dutchmen. These rules made it difficult to allow Union sub~titutes to relieve tiring players a:nd we all know that tiring players won't last until the fourth period. The Garnet eleven succeeded last year in overcoming the \third ·r period blues\ as early as their opening game against St. Lawrence. The Dutchmen completed three quarters of play with a commanding lead of 19-0. They did, however, quickly lose this lead and the game allowing the Larrit?s to score 21 points in the final stanza while not • adding a single point to their total. Capital Development A new group of commercially minded folksingers, inspired by the success of the preceding year's school, was quick to capitalize • on this new development.

Although fullback Jim Ramich played another out- standing game, it will be on the strength of quarterback Tom Hitchcock's passing that Union will win ball games. The defense played another fine game. This game should have been put in the win column along with any other game in which the opposi- tion is held to seven points. Alfred Scores Alfred employed a grind it out offense and grind it out they did, until they started to close in on the Garnet goal line.

Th At the end of the first half the only score was Alfred's and hy the way they were traveling up and down the field, it appeared that the ball game was .soon to he theirs, too. The Dutchmen's only score kept them out of the loss column and also helped to unveil another hard running so- phomore in Rich Clemens. He ran the ball 8 times for 31 yards, which was second only to the other sophomore, Jim Ramich, who had 54 yards in 18 attempts. Hitchcock Off Plagued by this difficulty, the l\nion squad has dropped it's last two decisions; a hard fought 3-1 loss to Hamilton and a one-sided 9-0 loss to Hartwick. In Friday's contest with Hamilton, the Gar- net could muster only a token offensive attack, one which man- aged less than ten shots the en- tire game. Tuesday, against Hartwick, even the usually crisp and reliable Garnet defense fell apart. The Union attack, at the same time, managed only one mot·e standout. Greg Olsen and Bob Maynard. Aiming to back them up, coach Beaudry has switched Bob Dickman to Left Full, where he will be spelling partially injured Vince DeQuisto. Replacing Dickman at Goalie will be an impressive looking sopho- more, Toby Olsen.

TiUif; Cenlt;l\ JeweiE .. s JEWELER AWAY FROM HOME 428 State St. FR 4-0183 The big difference in the out- come of Union's first two games lies in the passing offense. The first game saw Hitchcock com- plete 11 out of 1-1 for 120 yards and a win was recorded for the Garnet. Last .Saturday he could only complete 4 out of 12 and the Dutchmen were lucky to get out of the game with a tie. To say that the Union offense is a one man show is ridiculous. Our ground attack is strong enough to keep the defense honest. Against Alfred the pass protec- tion broke down, forcing Hitch• cock to rush his passes. If Hitchcock's passing returns to opening day form, if the run- ning of Ramich continues on the same course, if the defense continues its excellent play, and i.f the pass blocking improves, the Rochester game will be worth listening to on radio, even while the World Series is on television. The score was not even a good indication of the game. The Garnet completely dominated the play, and the ball was kept in Engineer territory for most of the game. Even the lone RPI score, which was booted In early in the first period, was tainted. The goal came on a corner kick which goalie Ben Volinski got his hands on, but couldn't quite hold.

Tha·t Senator Goldwater, unlike President Johnson, can be obliYious to this atrocious situation in and of itself di!o:;qualifies him from being elected President. \Welfarism Senator Goldwater tells us, \transforms the individual from a digni- fied, indu:>trious, self-rc:liant spit·itual being into a dependent animal ·reature without his knowing it.\ This is a finE, upstanding, Amer- k:m statement which am·one can make when he has a steady source ,f income; yet, people, to use Kenneth Dixon's words, \whose only 11ode of mnking· u living has be:.>n yanked fro:rn under them- and 1 ho dnn't P\'en havP the money to mon• some,,·hel'e else and tt·y to ,;tart o1·er,\ must certainly dew the problem in a different, l.!nA n'Ni- ·an light.

It is a fear of the Re- publican standard bearer that has sent the masses flock- ing to Johnson rather than any great admiration for the man himself. The decision the voters are facing is not whether to vote for Johnson or for Goldwater, but whether to vote for nr against Goldwater. This is a significant Letters to the Editor (Continued from Page 1) ferent sounds mark the third movement, while the last move- ment is written in sonata form.

The President, his running-mate, and even the man who nominated the Senator from Arizona heartily endorsed and courageously work- ed for the passage of this Act. difference. The Concordieusis endorses Lyndon Johnson and Hu- bert Humphrey for President and Vice President. We had no choice. To elect a man who refers to nuclear bombs as being conventional weapons, who refers to Joseph Mc- Carthy as a man who \made a contribution to his country- men that will forever redound to the credit of the people of Wisconsin,\ who is \impressed by the type of people\ in the John Birch society and says \they are the kind we need in politics,\ who would recommend \defoliation of the forests (of Southern China) by low yield atomic weapons,\ would be to invite disaster. Johnson, to his credit, has shown that he can get things done. In his short time in office he has pushed through more important legislation than his predecessor would have been able to in all probability. He is a master politician, and while· this is far from being an admirable trait in our society, it certainly helps in getting things done. Johnson, as others have before him, seems to have grown with the office, and in this light contradictions in his record have less significance. The brightest spot on the campaign horizon is Hubert Humphrey. All but demolished by John Kennedy four years ago in West Virginia, it is encouraging to have him on the national scene again. By contrast, the dimmest spot on the campaign trail is William Miller. Not even the die- hard Goldwater supporters speak of his merits unless they are pushed very hard by questioners. The choice is disturbingly clear-so clear and so dra- matic that to us there is no choice at all. On November 3 Lyndon Johnson must be elected to the presidency and we urge all those eligible to do their part to see that he is. For Senator . • • Happily there is a great difference between the Repub- lican standard bearer and that party's candidate for the New York Senate. In this race both Republican Kenneth Keating and Democrat Robert Kennedy are qualified men. Because Keating is willing to stand on his record (which is a good one) and Kennedy has thus far refused to chal- lenge it, we see no reason why Keating should not be re- turned to office. Kennedy is depending on his brother's image to carry him through. He constantly reminds the public of the late president by his campaign emphasis. Yet he should be concerned with Keating's record-and thus far this has occupied little of his campaign time.

It is conceivable that the above mentioned gentlemen did indeed come to Union in order to broad- en their stm·e of knowledge and understanding? l think not. I think that what they intend to do is stockpile their emotional ware- houses with biased, out of con- text, irrational and uncompro- mising distortions. The epitome of parochialism is well lighted in the concluding sentence, \If they don't want us in their town, we don't want them on om· campus!\ Does the engineer attempt to intimidate a 1·adio because it does not work as he so wishes it to? Does the chemist come on with a left jab because two materials re- fuse to combine? Does the psy- chologist condemn mankind be- cause ::<ome pt·efer the color red and some the color blue? Indeed, some of these people do just that. What are the results? One for- gotten idea and one forgettable man. What of those who do not become irate'! They attempt to perceive, to delve, to know, to un- derstand, to feel, to look, to grasp. Undoubte<lly, the latte1· individ- uals are posing problems \vhich by their very nature, involve com- plexity and intricacy. Is it the brave and -..,,·ise individual who shouts, \Go to Hell in a hand- basket.\ Or, by some chanre, is it he who mumbles, \What combina- tion of events in myself and oth- ers, material or immaterial, caus- ed this unfortunate result?\ 'The leaming of many things does not teach intellig·ence; if so it would have taught Hesoid and Pythagoras, and again XE>no- phanes and Recataues.' -I>iogenes Laertius Tb()mas A.

If Union intends, ns I as~vnw she does, to cling· to her ridicul- ous and arehaic system of com- pulsory convocation attendance, please, gentlemen, never again inflict upon us, the student body. what you !lave succeeded in in- flicting upon us today, October 1:~. 1964. ion's New Policies Weaken Fra- tem-ities\ (October 9), stil'l'ed considerable discussion in my fm- ternity, Phi Sigma Kappa-un- derstandably, since we were chosen to illustrate it. We are uncertain as to what, exactly, we were illustrating. Was it the poor, uncompetitive house grow- ing empty? Unlikely, since the house on Seward Place has more members than last year and is running well in the black. Was it the house which holds its mem- bers simply because they have no social alternative? We hope not. Fo1·tunately, the article itself was more lucid than the choice of illustration. Mr. Milder hit upon an important aspect of the challenge to fraternities at Un- ion. The fraternity that is noth- ing more than a recreation cen- ter will eventually outlive its usefulness. One day soon, we hope, it will be replaced by a student union (the Union Union). I should like to suggest the pos- sibility of a fratemity offering something more than entertain- ment-that is to say, the possi- bility of a fraternity offering fra- ternity. The concept \fraternity\ is the third member of a familiar trin- ity: liberty, equality, fraternity. Yet &ame of the very men on this campus who champion liberty and equality are the ones to deny fraternity. The same men who exert themselves for civil rights say to me: \You don't really be- lieve in that brotherhood stuff, clo you ? \ I would be the last one to criticize the patemal in- stincts of college men toward a mistreated segment of om· popu- lation. ln the end, however, only fraternity among- individuals will ease the f1·ictions in our society. What, after all, are liberty and <'quality without fraternity'! My thesis is, simply, that the i(\ea of fraternity is concerned with individuals here at Union College and their attempts to live \\'.ith one another. I am skeptical of the man who claims to love mciety in general, but who in his own living guards a sterile inde- nendence. \You don't really be- lieve in that brotherhood stuff,\ he says. Yes, I do; I've seen it work. Energetic Psychologist Dr. John Girdner described Stern as \an energetic, original thinker in the .field of psychol- ogy.\ His research has been mainly concerned with personality assessment, attitude measurement and the analysis of institutional environment. In his talk, Stern will discuss the recent research in the psy- chological characteristics of the college community's environment. He will point out the importance of the finding-s of this research to the student, his parents, and edu ·a tors. Stem 1·eceived his Ph.D from the Cniversity of Chicago in 1949.

Indeed, Senator Goldwater has either failed to acknowledge the problems existing in this nation today, or he has steadfastly main- tained that those segments of the people, or those segments of the federal system which have proved incapable of solving the problems, can 1•eally do the job. He has no program to offer the people. After examining the good Sen- ator's position on these and other problems facing the nation, one almost instinctively thinks of the refrains in a song of our times which says: \Row many ears must one ;.um have before he ean hear peopli> cry? \How many times can a man turn his head and pretend that ne just doesn't see?\ Planning to Build Something?

Kennedy on the other hand, being a young man will be able to find other ways to enter public service. As both of them are equally qualified in our opinion, the p~blic's interest would best be served by putting Keating to work for the next six years. The Concordiensis thus endorses Kenneth Keating for United States Senator from New York. Kennedy has shown no valid reason to turn him out. While I agree that we of the \Younger Generation\ should oft- en be given what is good for us, as opposed to tliat which we'd rather have, there is a limit to what we can stand. The haste with which the chapel was emptied at the conclusion of Mr. Braine's lec- ture is, I feel, ,an indication that this limit had been reached. The Concordiensis once predict- ed that fraternities would not be able to coexist with a Union Un- ion; that, in effect, Union men woul.-1 prefer to leave class just as businessmen leave their of- fices; each returning to his pri- vate corner of the world, coming out only for the purpose of social entertainment.

The fact that Khruschev was away from Moscow on vacation when the change was made and that no immediate official words of praise were given to him after his 11 years of power and a lifetime of service to the party seem to indi- cate that the retirement was not purely voluntary. This change mak·es it all the more important that our Isn't it possible, gentlemen, that those students interested in \learning to write a novel\ could have been invited to a friendly gathering somewhere on campus and that those whose interests lie elsewhere miglit have been spared this morning's experience? 1 might 11ote in closing, that such a step would also have saved Mr. Braine a good bit of embar- rassment.

Cnion's first score was set up on a fourth down punting situation on which Rochester kicker Mcintosh could not get his punt away. This gave the Garnet the ball on the Yellowjacket's 24 yard line. Union couldn't score or even get a first down on four tries, the last being a pass in- complete in the end zone. Here the referee called interference against the Rochester defender and gave the hall back to Union on the 1 yard line. This disputed call gave Hitchcock the oppor- tunity to score on a qua1terback sneak. Rochester's second score, on a fourth down play from the Un- ion 27, came when qua1terback Wormuth passed to end Rice. Hutchinson defending on the play hatted the ball but it popped up in the air enabling Rice to haul it in for six points. Marc Hurlbut went into the game ranked ninth in the nation in punting.

Play abruptly ceased with the coming <>f the Revolutionary War and was practically non-existent for one hundred years. It was reintroduced by Christian Schepflin of Dunellen, N. J. The game caught on once again and clubs were formed in every city and town. I their ul ti: thel'efot·e ation. A provides ., :;o can be ol results. By 1915, lawn bowling was so widespread that a governing body was created to standardize rules, arrange toumaments, and regulate play. The organization, founded at Buffalo, was called the American Lawn Bowling Association. Today, more than 150 lawn bowling clubs are in existence in the United States. The Rules La·wn bowling is similar to another Union College favorite, curl- ing, which is played o:n iee. The playing area js a lawn 20 feet wide J and 120 feet long. The ball is 16.5 inches in circmnference and weighs 3.5 poUIIds. It is biased, or in other words, it is unbalanced. The game is meant to be play-ed with two teams of four men each, but is also played with teams of one, two, or three. The object of the game is to place you1· ball nearest the \jack which is a small white ball, weighing ten o\mces and having a diam- eter of 2.5 inches. The strategy calls for knocking away your oppon- ent's ball as well as placing yours nearest the jaek. Each player is permitted two bowls each turn, the bowls beino· made alternately by opposing players. The team that wins the tos~ starts the game by throwing the jack onto the rink. This team then has the first turn at bowling. 'fhe first man is called the leader. lt is his job to throw the jack and then take the fi1~st turn from the mat, which is the point from which players must bowl. Each player must have one foot on the mat when bO\.,;ling. The game is ,usually won with twenty-one points, but some are played on the. bas1s of so many shots per team, or on a time basis. If the spread of bocci from the biology depat·tment to the resi- ?ents of Bailey Hall i~ ~my indication of the futu1·e of lawn bowling, 1t would not be surprismg to see horci someday reach the level of curling in Union College sports.

2 Political Scene: Burn's Fallacy By Alon Jeffrey In his lecture at the Ft:ee~lu:n Forum last Monday night, Prof. Jal:!les .M:acGregor Burns of W1lhams ~olle!\'e n<?ted the necessity of mamtammg the strength of the \presrdential wmg\ of the Republi- can party. He was, however, unwilling to state that this position was an endorsen1ent of Senator Keating. Most likely this was due to his long and cl0se relationship with the Kennedy family. . B';!rntl was quite adamant in suggesting that the strength of t~us wmg of ~he pa1·ty sheuld be maintained by continuing in office l:1beral Republ!can govemors. We also subscribe to this position, hut feel that It does apply t() the Senate race in New York.

Ravina Disappointing • 0 Professor Edgar Curtis, (con- ductor of the Albany Symphony, and chairman of the music de- partment at Union) has often noted that an institution, be it • c a college or a music ensem- ble, which considers itself to \have arrived\ at the level of achievement to which it aspires, illlP sacrifices both some of the drive to do better, and the progt·ess which precludes stagnation that charactcl\ize \unarrived\ organi za- tion. The Albany Symphony has \ \ definitely not arrived as a pro- fe:;sional orchestra of the first rank, or even of the second. But, as a result of the prodigious ef- • t. foi-ts of Cuttis in demanding the best from his players and in t•e- eruiting younger and beter talent, : the orchestra has improved dis- • ; tinctly each year. This year, as ~ the listeners in Memorial Chapel .. n Tuesday evening discovered, is no exceplion. However, despite its improvement, which is by no means overwhelming, the Capitol District's professional answer to the Skidmore-Union Orchesti·a. participated in, and contributed its share to a very mediocre con- cert.

The strings, which have accompaniment, which was com- cften been Symphony's weakest petent at best. point, were strong, and the lower strings were excellent. Although the string sections temporarily lapsed in the Andante, they pro- vided the full sound of an accom- plished group. In addition, the horns recovered and, to the credit of the first hornist, beautifully executed a solo shared with the celli, thereby contributing the high point of the opening per- formance. ·On the O'ther hand, while the orchestra played with decision, it did not play with pre- cision. Entrances and conclu- sions were sloppy, especially in the fit•st two selections, and the playing was mechanical and choppy throughout. There was no nuance, no shading, and no real excitement, and there were too many obvious mistakes. Ravina In Solo Fam.ous Opening The Concerto is probably most famous for its magnificent open- ing, in which the theme of the first movement is stated in the solo violin, above the churning of the strings. Mr. Ravina ruined the opening with a tremendously exaggerated vibrato, a whining tone, and a series of notes which were remarkably out of tune. Having laid the foundations for an egg, he proceeded to render the staple of violinists' repertoires without powe1·, without excite- ment, and without the spontaneity that should characterize the ly- ricism of the piece. His perform- ance was deliberate, overplayed, and unmusical. And his intona- tion did not improve until the thit·d movement, when he became too preoccupied with executing Unlike the rendition of the difficult runs, which he did poor- Handel, which was average, but ly, to devote attention to drag- promising, the performance of the ging a romantic tone out of his Mendelssohn Violin Concerto was violin.

Communists Continue Divided In short, the Communist movement will continue to be divider! over strategy and tactics, ideology and control, authority and auton- omy, and it will likely develop largely uncoordinated foreign policies. One can only hope that the West, recognizing these profound develop- ments, will adopt policies suited not for the late 1940's or early 1950's, but for the new realities of the mid-1960's.

Nuclear Weapons The entrance of Red China into the once select nuclear club clearly demonstrates that the current debate on nu- clear weapons in this country is entirely missing the point. It is no longer significant to be the \mightiest nation on earth.\ One need only be mighty enough. And the num- ber of nations who are \mighty enough\ will be increasing at a disturbing rate in the years to come. There are schools of thought in the world that feel that the best way to prevent a nuclear war is to make it totally unthinkable-by having several nations each with the capacity to totally destroy the world. This line of rea- soning is absurd. As the tragic events of last November demonstrated, it only takes one--one emotionally disturbed individual to press his finger on the nuclear trigger. As the number of nations with nuclear weapons increases, this danger will increase accordingly. Goldwater proclaims that the United States must not lose its status as the world's most powerful nation. This is unnecessary-we are strong enough now to end life on this planet. Even if we should slip to fiftieth in the \nu- clear standings\ it would not alter that fact. Our attention must now be turned to achieving an effective disarmament agreement. The problems involved here are immense and it is perhaps unrealistic to think of achieving disarmament in the world as we know it today. But it is our only true hope for survival. The alternative offers no hope at all for one day one man will slip. The next administration therefore would be well ad- vised to go all out to achieve a nuclear agreement. It might consider a unilateral step such as stopping the fur- ther production of nuclear weapons while continuing to work only on the improvement of defensive missiles and defensive technical apparatus. True, we would lose none of our capacity to destroy the world, and the danger of emotional · illness causing a man to start a war would be just as great, but it would be an effective first step. And first steps are solely needed.

For the matter of rebuttal', I'll m bhrarily assume that the John Birch Society is considererl ex- tl·eme, they certainly evoke the Constitution enough if that is the test. In fact they want to im- peach Earl Warren. I don't ag·ree with them. But the Citi- zens for Johnson are concerned with methods, which they claim \do complete violence\ to the Constitution. Now the Birchers don't want to hang Earl Warren, they don't want to ride him out of town on a rail, they want :to impeach him. Impeachment is set down in the Constitution. I ask you, is this method emotional, is this method counter to the spirit of constitutional government? Of course not. Other groups would pass Constitutional Amendments on the school prayer decision, and on the reapportionment is- sue, On these issues there 1s lit- tle g1·ound for half-measures, ('Ompromis·es, and the like, terms so often envoked by the liberals who claim that we who do sup- port Goldwater .see everything in terms of black and whites . My last point concerns the con- tention that Goldwater \captured\ the Republican Party. The tel'.rn \captured\ is used in <this con- text by the Citizens for Jolmson. I ask you, how can you .say that a man who received over eight hundred first ballot vOites in a smashing victory grass roots support (remember the California primary 1) \captured\ the party? Goldwater forces allowed roll call votes on the key platform issues of civil rights and extremism, and won. In contrast not one single roll vote was taken at the Democratic Convention, during which duly elected members were tossed out. I ask y.ou who is capturing whom? To the Editor of Concordiensis: I want to take issue with the casual line of last week's editor- ial. My intention is not so much to argue with the Concordit>nsil'1 as to clear away some misconcep- tions which I feel have arisen con- cerning the m;e of nuclear wPa- pons. Firstly: From newspaper a('- counts I have read, I get the im- pression that every nuclear wea- pon in our or Russia's arsenal is capable of destroying a city. Ar:.- tually, the Davy Crockett can de- stroy one plane, and the Little John missile would have to be well placed to do equal damage to both the State St. shopping area and this campus. These are what are meant by 'tactical nuclear weapons'. True, this is fairly heavy damage, but hardly the to- tal devastation most arcounts imply. Secondly: The fear of escala- tion has overshado·wed the rea- soned estimation of its chances. Now that we have tactical nu- clear weapons, the fear is that their use will lead to the use of strategic nuclear weapons. But selective bombings in WW II did not lead to unrestricted bombing, and tactical nuclear weapons don't necessarily lead to stmteg-il' n u- rlear weapons. Besides, the1·e is no reason to suppose that any na- tion would wait for the excuse that tactical nuclem· weapons had been used against them to usP strategic nuclear weapons them- selves: just al'1 we needed no such excuse for the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Thirdly: The two Army divif:- ions available and designed for rapid reinforcement of a hot area, the 82nd and lOlst ai1·-born di- visions, are both heavily, although not completely, dependent upon their nuclear weapons. The :Vlar- ine Corps can fight either con- venti-onally or with the nuclear weapons within their units. The President is the man who must decide if we can afford to gamble on another Pusan perimeter stand; and this type of policy de- cil'ion must be made before a crif•i~ breaks. It then becomes the job of the field commander to es- timate the situation and make use of these available options within the l'1rope of the Presi- rlt·nt's policy. This system leaves the ('hoice, within the President's n·strictions, of tactical nuciPnr warfare to the field commander; a-; is now the case with General Lemitzer, commander of NATO, as app1·oved by President John- son. Frederick Firman '65 tion's defense policy to entrust their defense entirely to the Unit- ed Stated. The Citizens for Jolmson say that the issues facing the free world \will not be disnelled by bluster.\ I agree. And I don't think that Mr. Goldwater's em- phasis upon the ultimate triumph of freedom over communism, vic- tory is the word used, can be termed \bluster.\ Why do not the Citizens delve ir.to the area (even ever so shal- lowly) of \quick and easy solu- tions\ to domestic matters- I ask them, what is The Great Society? President Johnson in his book :\ly Home for America says ( p.52) \There are three central places where we must begin to build the Great Society - in our cities, in our countryside, and in our class- rooms.\ What happened to the suburbs will forever remain a mystery, probably it is forever dt:stined to be lost to the Repub- licans! My point is this: is this not the ultimate generalization, the ultimate framework for \quick and easy solutions\? The War on Poverty is another Democrat phrase. But just how far can unde1• a billion dollars (eut some already) go to answer- ing the poverty problem? Why it can even imply that Senator Gold- water is for noverty, but of course that thought never crossed the mind of any Democrats! Want to bet? So my friends who are Citizens for Johnson, no party has a mo- nopoly of phrase making, gener- alizations, and simple solutions. \It is doubtless true that the majority of Sen. Goldwater's sup- port comes from respectable mid- clle class people who have some- how been convinced by emotional rather than rational arguments that their candidate is the coun- try's political savior,\ so reads the tract before me. The Schenectady Citizens for Johnson go on to say that Gold- water has \also attracted to him- self and his cause groups and in- dividuals for whom the ..• term extremist is entirely appropriate.\ I will ('ome to this second point in a minute. How absolutely ducky for the Srhenectady Citizens for John- son to have so much concern for the poor misguided citizens in this a1 ea. My hat is off to them! But bd'orC' I put that hat back on I'd like to know just how the Citi- zt·ns group knows the thought processes of those who support Goldwa.ter. Did the Citizens for Johnson take a poll? Perhaps they asked (the middle class peo- ple only): \Do you support Sen- ator Goldwater on rational m· Review . .. (Continued from Page 3) and minimized his ever-present vibt·ato. The orchestra provided a powerful ending to the recovering affair. In all, Mr. Ravina did not acquit himself commendably. If he is interested in \arriving-.\ and if this performance is char- acteristi-c of his approach, he is on the wrong bus. Hopefully, he was just nervous. The audience, undaunted by this, applauded with fervor, probably because it always does. There is little else to cheer in the tri-cities area. Charged Atmosphere The audience did not ask Mr. Ravina back for a curtain call, though it gave him a healthy round of applause. But it did call Mr. Curtis back, repeatedly and, in the reviewer's opinion, cor- rectly, after the closing perform- ance of the Piston Fourth Sym- phony. Once again inaccurate timing, especially in the horns, who were consistently slightly ahead of the beat, and less than perfect rendition of difficult pas- sages in the trumpets detracted f1•om the result. Tht> result was, however, laudable. The orches- tra, which showed that it can play with a big, exciting sound earlier in the evening, gave an inspired recital of the Piston Work.

The final movement served as icing on an extremely interesting cake, and the orchestra redeemed itself. The curtains which drape the huge windows at the front of Memorial Chapel were extremely dirty, and the overall level of performance was disappointing, but there is hope for a thorough cleaning on both scores. •Messiah' ••• (Continued from Page 2) and concepts of American gov- ernment that have evolved during this century; nor can the strife of t•eorganizing fundamental pol- icies toward foreign nations, in view of the new realities of to- day's existence, be dealt with by using those nations with whom we disagree as the outlet or scape-goat :for our desO:re to ex- press internal violence and hate.

The Curricular Affairs Committee is currently investi- gating various calendar possibilities along with working to- wards a revision of the curriculum. As this might be a lengthy process we would like to propose a stop-gap mea- sure to eliminate the lame duck period in January until a permanent calendar is decided upon. Nothing would be lost by having the first term run from September until December with Final exams coming before the Christmas vacation, and the second term run from January to May. This would only make the first term two teaching weeks shorter than it is this year, and would lengthen the second term accordinly. Starting next week, the Concordiensis will publish re- ports of the Curricular Affairs Committee to enable the campus to know in depth what is going on. We welcome any additional calendar suggestions. To the Editor of Concordiensis: I have before me a curious political document titled \Why We Are Opposed to Senator Gold- water\ and signed by the Sche- nectady County Citizens for John- son. The aim of this tract is by no means hidden, it is to attract Republicans and the independent vote to the Democratic column on November third. The tract, from which I shall quote from time to time below, is an interesting mix- ture of generalizations and deft >.ide-stepping. emotional grounds 1\ Otherwise their statement is self-serving only, not only self-serving but downright insulting to those who have come to support the Arizona Senator after a large amount of discussion and self-reflection. Again, is Johnson's plea for the Great Society a rational appeal? I think not.

Once again image is being given priority over substance. If the substance changes (and Dean Lockwood is trying to change it) then the image will take care of itself. The Schenectady Citizens for Johnson say that Senator Gold- water puts \The emphasis on quick and easy solutions to mat- ters of foreign policy . . .\ and thus will \lose us. our allies.\ I openly ask these people who so claim if they honestly can say that Kennedy-Johnson leadership has gained us the support of our allies in the critical area of Eu- ropean defense?

It is no Iunger significant to be the \mightiest nation on earth.\ One need only be mighty l:'nough. And the num- ber of nations -..vho are \mighty enough\ \Vill be increasing at a disturbing rate in the years to come. There are schools of thought in the world that feel that the best way to prevent a nuclear war is to make it totallv unthinkable-by having several nations each with the c~paeity to totally destroy the world. This line of rea- soning i::; absurd. As the tragic events of last November demonstrated, it only takes one-one emotionally disturbed individual to press his finger on the nuclear trigger. As the number· of nations with nuclear weapons increases, this danger will increase accordingly. GolLhvater proclaims that the United States must not lose its status as the world's most powerful nation. This is unnecessary-\\'C are strong enough now to end life on this planet. E::wn if we should slip to fiftieth in the \nu- dL'ar standing:::;\ it would not alter that fact. Our attention must now be turned to a<.:hieving an dfedive disarmament agreement. The problems involved here are immense and it is perhaps unrealistic to think of achieving disarmament in the world as we know it today. But it is our only true hope for survival. The alternative offers no hope at all fur one day one man will slip. The next administration therefore would be well ad- vised tu go all out to achieve a nuclear agreement. It might consider a unilateral step such as stopping the fur- ther production of nuclear weapons while continuing to v;ork only on the improvement of defensive missiles and defensive technical apparatus. True, we would lose none of our capacity to destroy the world, and the danger of emotional illness causing a man to start a war would be just as great, but it would be an effective first step. And fin~t steps are solely needed. Calendar Proposal TION CREDIT\ Friday, October 23, 1964 Catnpus Calendar Odolll'r 2:\ .Footb:tll (fn·.,hnmnl, \\ni<'ll \\>'.

The Curricular Affairs Committee is currently investi- gating various calendar possibilities along with working to- wards a revision of the curriculum. As this might be a lengthy process we would like to propose a stop-gap mea- surP to eliminate the lame duck period in January until a permanl'nt call'ndar is decidl'd upon. :\'othing would be lost by having the first term run from September until December with Final exams coming befon' the Christmas vacation, and the second term run from January to May. This would only make the first term two teaching weeks shorter than it is this year, and would lengthen the second term accordinly. Starting next week, the Concordiensis will publish re- ports of the Curricular Affairs Committee to enable the campus to know in depth what is going on. We welcome any additional calendar suggestions. To the Editor uf Concordil'nHis: I han• be•fon• nw a curiou,.; pol.itieal docunwnt titled \Why W\ An.'

The latter is relatively rare, occurring only when one team accuses the other of breaking the tournament rules. Onre ag.ain, 1..'nion sophomores hav~ the opportunity to spend their junior year abroad. This year there are many openings for study and work in European l'Ountries, including the St. Andrew's and ETH exchnng~ plans. The St. Anlh·ew:; progTam de\·eloped out of a friendship between former president of Union, Dixon Hyan Fox, and S.ir James Colqu- houn Irvine,. Pxincipal and Vice Chancellor of St. Andrews Univer- sity in Scotland. One Union student studies at St. Andrews for a year and one Scotsman comes here. The two students continue their wo1•k in the liberal arts fields, and receive credit fm· a year's work from their home college. Although the visiting student must pay his own transportation, his tuition, room and board are paid for by the scholarship g-rant. To apply, studt>nts must write a letter to President Davidson, Dean Lockwood and lJean Pollock, Yarious mem- Andrews. The candidate is then judged by a committee composed of President Davidson, Dean Lockwood and Dean Pollack, various mem- bers of the faculty, and the Exchange student of the preceeding year. ..(ill interes·ted students who feel that they qualify are urged to apply fur this program in the nem• future.

Natural'ly, the press blasted Goldwater for making a rash and inesponsible statement. That btatement was, essentially, the truth.

However, the D~mocrats are strong in the Lake County region, one of the larg-est m the state. Yet this is the same area which gave strong support to Wallace.

The New Deal - A Dead Horse . taining the peace that the wol'ld has ever known, Goldwater is never- ,•1 theless made to appear irresponsible and is not to be trusted for a minute. Meamvhile, Johnson, following in the footsteps of his pre- decessor, is attempting to establish some- sort of multinational atomic fleet which would give considerably more power to the Europeans, «I The argument over the term \conventional\ is mainly one of seman- tics.

GO (2 OR MORE) Conservative Rebirth Beyond the Republican stand- ard-bearer one only has to look at the Senatorial races t:his year to see evidence of a Conservative G.O.P. rebirth: Ohio, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, North Dakota, Indiana, Michigan, Tex· as, New Mexico, and Tennessee are states where Conservatives have received their party's en- dorsement and the task to defeat a Democratic New Dealer. Sen- ator Goldwa:ter, therefore, was not the only Conservative who won in the party caucuses. The Conservative rebirth is revealing itself from top to bottom in this election and provides the foun- dation fo1• an effective opposition party. No lo)1ger will the Re- publican Party be branded with ''me tooi~rn·\ Dead New Deal The Democrats, first· to seize upon a philosophy that appealed to the Depressi<ln era voter, have been slow in discovering that they have sa:t on their haunches for too long. And so they still cam- paign on the tiresome slogans of the New Deal: Everything for Everybody, and Rah! For the Great Society; but L.B.J. and H.H.H. al,'e not F.D.R. who was tempered by the times. In fact, they are anachronistic to the six- ties. The iroi1y of the campaign is that it is not Conservatism which is outside the main stream of political thought, 'but that de- cadent ship the New Deal which, with its torn sails and leaky hull, has drifted into still waters. On ' its deck it has carried the Demo-~ cratic Party for thirty years and carried it profitably, but no longer does it ride high on the waves of time. It will be in the sixties and seventies that the deck hands of this ship f.inally discover that their means of transportation should be scuttled, and only then, will cries of \me..:tooism\ be aim- ed at the Democratic Party. CLE4.:~yy of the traditionally conventional weapons used in World War U. IJ' Decline in Capacity Also along the lines of national defense, Goldwater has accused the g-overnment of allowing our deliverable nuclear capacity to de- cline ne·arly ninety per cent ovet• the next decade at the present rate of termination of eyi_sting contracts and at the failure of the govern- ment to institute any. significant new programs to replace the old. I cro not deny that Goldwater's figure is probably an exaggerated one. Nevertheless, :most of the major defense programs with whieh ,I we are familiar were s.tarted in the late 1950's and have not yet been replaced. At any other time in history, this might not have been significant. Immediately following the detonation of a nuclear device by the Chinese Communists, however, the implications of such a situation, including an announeed plan to reduce om armaments pro- duction, are frightening. Constitutional Equality In the area of domestic affairs, Goldwater's attitude toward the Negro is not that which is shared by sou them segregationists. It is I·' not based on a philosophy of white supremacy or of &urvival of the fittest. Rather than distinguish the 'Negro from the American as a sort of speci-al eharacter, Goldwater simply makes it clear that it is not the natural or legal right of any person to have privileges; it is, •. however, everyone's pl'idlege to have rights. To legislate rights for one group at the expense of the free choice of association for other groups is not true progress. It will simply drive the basic problems deeper and cause g-reater discontent.. The anti-Goldwaterites have interpreted these ideas as meaning that there is no such thing as ·· equality or equal opportunity. In fact, Goldwater's equality is of a sott that is closer to the meaning of the Constitution than that. of the liberals. The liberals, in calling for a collectivist, horizontal and centi·alized society, have chosen to attack Goldwater as an enemy ., of the free individual when, in fact, he emphasizes the individual above almost anything else-including the pO\\·er of the federal government.

By Giuseppe Ruggeri To speak of the political sys- tem in Italy is to speak of the pa1·ty system. In fact the polit- kal functions and power a1·e mo- nopolized by the political parties. h is the pa1·ty that chooses can- didates, it is the party that makes programs. The leader of each of the nine parties is potentially a pdme minister. The leader of the majority party is normally the prime minister and leads the ex- ecutive functions, and, indirectly, by the compulso1·y loyalty of the party congressmen to the pro- g-ram approved. by the majority within the party, the legislative funetion. The power of centrali- zation and monopolization of po- litical functions has gone so far that some Italian students of poli- tics have defined the Italian polit- ical system not as a parliamen- tary system but as \Partitocru~ zia\ government of parties. The function of Parliament is only formal. Each political decision is made out of the parliament. Also the erises are extra-parliamentary ir, natul'e, The parliament is only the place where the party decis- ions acquire lawful meaning and power. .\Iulti-Party Hystem The political-party system in Italy is quite different fmm that of U.S.A. We have an effective multi-party system at the local and at the national level. Actual- ly the political pa1;ties in Italy are divided in regard to the position they hold in the Parliament which reflects their ideological position. The Christian Democrats (DC) stand in the center; at their right there are, progressively: the Lib- et·al party ( PLI}, the Monarchic party (PDIUM}, and the f<J.srio;t party (MSI}. At the left: the Dem- ocratic socialist party ( PSDI}, the ~epubl ican pat-ty ( PRI), the Socialist party (PSI),~ the. left wing of the Socialist~ . ·:Party ( I'SDIL'M) and. finally the. com- munist party (PCI). Some of them, like the Republican party, Distortion ... (Continued from Page 3} la1·y. The programs cal'l'ied out hy the pl'esent administt·ation m·e antithetical to Goldwat<r's view::< \n the n~ture of goYel nnwntal powet· and pre1·ogative. He iR dis- :!ppointed not only with the spe- cifir programs but with the na- ture of the centralized govem- ment by which they have been tarried out. It should be to Gold- water's ct·edit that he has ex- posed and criticized what he feels to be wrong. It is not to John- ><on's credit, however, that such mistakes be concealed, as has hap- pened with the farm program. Several Grange organizations vot- ed recently to seek the removal of strict federal supervision. How- ever, the farmers still haYe thf:' old eontrols, and more are being promised. It would seem that Johnson's only solution to Big Government failures ig Bigger CovernmPnt. ~ocial Undesirability It would be quite a disaster if the word \criticism\ were to be- come synonymous w.ith the word \reaction.\ Similarly, the word \innovation\ should neYer become are very small, but in u multi- party system even the smallest party n1ay· ha\'e ,a fum!amenta'l influence. : The political hendeneics in the Italian political pa\oties h·ave fol- lowed four n1ain d~):ections: 1) A total coalition. Just after the war we had a coalition of all parties. But soon after De Gas- peri, DC leader, realized a coali- tion with PCI was incompatible v;ith the Christian and Democratic ideology of DC. So he broke with the communists and pro- c_l~imed the mai? issue o~ his po- htteal program m domestic policy the struggle to communism. 2} I·n 1948 DC won the abso- lute majority so we had the \monocolore\ (one color); it is a cabinet formed· only by DC con- gress men and ··,carrying on t-he DC program. Next election DC bst. ~he ahsol¥te .majority so a coalttlon was needed. 3) The 4 party coalition: DC former a maJority with PLI;. PRI and PSDI. De Gasperi's death, economic development, and a rise of social problems, pushed DC to the left. At the same time PSI tried to free itself from PCI, so DC leaders thought it was time to make a coalition with the social- is~ pa1·ty. That !>hould have per- nutted the solutwn of' the social problems and the formation of a lar~e majority, a strong wall agamst communism. This is the fourth way, and it is still at the beginning. It depends on its suc- cess to carry on a sound economic and social program if 1talv will go on to a strong de mona ti'l' sn;- tem or to communism. · Six Colleges Found Athletic Conference Earlier this week the forma- tion of a six team athletic league of which Union will be a member: was announced. The league, call- ed. the Indepenqent, College Ath- letic Conference (ICAC), will be composed of Alfred University Clarkson College, Hobart College: HPI, St. Lawrence University, anil l:nion College. Union pres- ently competes witl1 all five schools in at least two sports. The Conference will be con- { el'lled with five sports-foo·tball basketball, wrestling, tennis, and golf. Competition will begin with this season's football sched- ule. The other sports will begin next fall. Football and basketball will be based on each team's won-lost percentage. Tournaments will be lll'l'anged in the other three sports to determine inclividual and team winners. · Thomas A. Cartmill, director of athletics of St. Lawrence and former coach of basketball and tennis at Union, is president of the ICAC. Union athletic head Wilford Ketz is secretary-treas- urer. Austin, Texas-(I.P.)-A new research project at the University of Texas is attempting to put more accuracy into the art of pre- dicting success in college.

This made the score 7-0 and it probably would have remained tha:t way when the teams went to the locker room at halftime if it had not been for a bad eall by the referee on what turned out to be a Hitch- cock fumble. In the closing min- utes of the half, Hitchcock, in attempting to pass, was hit and the ball popped loose. It appear- ed quite obvious to this reporter that Hitchcock's arm was in for- ward motion and this, if the ref- eree h.ad seen it, would have meant an incomplete pass. The referee did not see the motion and ruled the ball free for Ho- bart since they had recovered it. Hobart took over with a first and ten on Union's 16 yard line. On the first play halfback John Mar- chi tell ran through three would- be tacklers to score.

Second Half The second half started as a rerun of the first when Bob Grady fumbled a fair catch at- tempt and set up a first and ten situation on the Union 24. Ho- bart~s quarterback Jim Murdock capitalized on the Union gift by scoring on a 12-yard roll out. For some reason this seemed to ignite the Union team and they started hitting, which they had been doing in the first half with- out knocking anybody down. The remainder of the game was a complete reversal of the fll'st half in that the Gamet defense com- pletely dominated the Hobart of- fense, including Yamashiro. But the damage had been done and the score was 19 to 0. Garnet Scores Th.e Garnet's first score came at the end of the third period on a two yard plunge by a fullback, Jim Ramich. In the fourth quar- ter the Garnet, led by the pass- ing of Tom Hitchcock, marched for a score gotten by halfback Dick Clemens on a 27 yard pass and l'llil play. Even though the Garnet dominated the second half they had spotted the Statesmen just too many points. One of the few bright spots, in a game which could ultimately be the deciding factor in a good sea- son and a fair season, was the passing of Tom Hitchcock. Held for only two completions in seven attemp.ts for 15 yards in the first half, the junio1• quarterback came back to attempt to lead the Dutch- men to victory .as he completed 14 of 21 passes for 147 yards and a touchdown. His final totals of 16 for 28 for 162 yards and a touchdown don't reveal the con- stant pressure that he was under from the Hobart linemen as he attempted to Jlass.

Union 16, St. Lawrence 9; Union 7 Alfred 7· Chi Psi Takes Football Title By Gai·y Van Graafeiland With the football season completed and with tennis fast draw- ing to a close, the intramural spotlight now focuses on badminton and volleyball. The dust hasn't settled yet, howevet·, from the football final where Chi Psi defeated Phi Sigma Delta 19-7. Chi Psi had beate~ Kappa Alpha 19-18 to reach the finals, and there was no stopping them after that. Tennis looks like a three team fight. In the South- ern Division, Alpha Delt emerged victorious \virth a Intramural perfect total of fifteen points. In the north, Chi Psi and Beta Theta Pi are tied, each with twelve points, Sports But Chi Psi has one match left to play, and needs to . . ta~e. ~ut one point from Phi Epsilon Pi to reign supreme m 1ts diVISion. In the east, Kappa Alpha h·as copped the number one spot with a total of thirteen points. Coach Lawrence hopes tha.t the tennis matches will be completed sometime next week. Badminton, Volleyball Start Badminton, which began this last Wednesday, is a best two of three games affair, with two sing·les and one doubles match be·ing played. No man can compete in both singles and doubles, Volley- ball also began Wednesday. One match is played, and the rules are the regular volleyhall rules. Coach Lawrence stated that basketball would begin as soon as the varsity vacates the gym. The Leag-ues for both volleyball and badminton are: Northern Alpha Delta Phi Phi Sigma Kappa Sigma Phi Delta Phi Phi Gamma Delta Independents Southern Phi Epsilon Pi Chi Psi Psi Upsilon Phi Delta Theta Kappa Sigma Eastern Delta Upsilon Kappa Alpha Beta Theta Pi Sigma Chi Phi Sigma Delta Thetn Delta Chi Rochester 20, Union 14; Union 27 RPi 3' Hobart 19 Un1.'on 13 ' ~USHING: ' ' ' ' .

Colgate Meet Last Saturday the cross coun- try team traveled to Hamilton, '\ New York, to compete against what proved to be a very strong Colgate squad. The weather was clear and dry, there was no wind .II and the cool 50 degrees made rum1ing very pleasant. The Col- gate thinclads proved too strong, .1owever, and won the meet 15-48, .1 sweeping the first five places. l;njon's Dave Ring was constant- ly in contention and took sixth place, finishing only five seconds behind the fifth place finisher for :; Colgate. Record time for the 4.7 mile course is 24:28.7 and the times at the Union-Colgate meet were not '\· exceptiona 1 ly fast, the first place finisher recording a time of 25:39.3. T)le Garnet thinclads will round •i) out the season with two big meets on November 7 and 16. On Nov. 7 the team travels to Oswego to complete in the NYSCTFA meet and on Nov. 16 they travel to ') New York City for the IC-4A meet. Coach Ketz will be taking the full team to the NYSCTFA :neet and will take Ring and IJ Campman fot· the varsity and Flinn for the Frosh to the IC-4A meet. Dutchmen's Doings SENIORS John Soper (cap- tain), Art Marshall, Brendan Hutchinson, Denis Riva, John 6) Wilson, Richard Engles, and Jo- seph Sawyer will be playing their last home football games tomor- row against Williams. The seven 11 ~ seniors have been instrumental in Garnet successes this season. AGAINST HOBART the Dutch- men were not penalized once. This is admirable, but what is the rea- j) son for it? Could it be that the gridders are really that well drill- ~rl? UNION OPPONENTS have fJ been penalized a total of 315 yards while the Dutchmen have lost only 135 yards through pen- alties, UNION'S G:RID TEAM has not yet scored in the first period this season. BOB DeMICHELE has been credited with 70 tackles in the ~ Garnet's first five games. MARC HURLBUT is now rank- ed seventh in the nation among small college punters.
