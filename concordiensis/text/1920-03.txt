The Service of an Electrical Research Laboratory The research facilities of the General Electric Company are an asset of world-wide importance, as recent war work has so clearly demonstrated. Their advantages in pursuits of peace made them of inestimable value in time of war. A most interesting story tells of the devices evolved which subo stantially aided in solving one of the most pressing problems of the war-the submarine menace. Fanciful, but no less real, were the results attained in radio. cotnmtmication which enabled an aviator to control a fleet of flying battleships, and made possible the sending, without a wire, history-making messages and orders to ships at sea. Scarcely Jess important \vas the X-ray tube, specially designed for field hospital use and a notable contribution to the military surgical service.And many other products, for both com- batant and industrial use, did their full share in securing the victory. In the laboratories are employed highly trained physicists, chemists, metallurgists and engineers, some of whom are experts of inter- tlational reputation. These men are working not only to convert the resources of Nature to be of service to man, but to increase the usefulness of electricity in every line of endeavor. Their achievements benefit every individual wherever electricity is used. Scientific research works hand in hand with the development of new devices, more efficient apparatus and processes of manufacture. It results in the discovery of better and more useful materials and ulti~ mately in making happier and more livable the life of all mankind. f3ooklet, Y-863, describing the company's plants, will be mailed upon request.

Y .. The Service of an Electrical Research Laboratory The research facilities of the General Electric Company are an asset of world-wide importance, as recent war work has so clearly demonstrated. Their advantages in pursuits of peace made them of inestimable value in time of war. A most interesting story tells of the devices evolved which subg stantially aided in solving one of the most prcss'n::; pcoblems of the war-the submarine menace. Fanciful, but no less real, were the results attained in radio communication which enabled an aviator to control a fleet of flying battleships, and made possible the sending, without .a wire, history-making messages and orders to ships at sea. Scarcely .Jess important was the X-ray tube, specially designed for field hospital use and a notable contributior. to the military surgical service.And many other products, for both com- batant and industrial use, did their full share in securing the rictory. In the laboratories are employed highly trai::led physicists, chemists, metallurgists and engineers, some of whom are experts of. inter- national reputation. These men are working not only to convert the resources of Nature to be of service to man, but to increase the usefulness of electricity in every line of endeavor. Their achievements benefit every individual wherever electricity is used. Scientific research works hand in hand with the development of new devices, more efficient apparatus and processes of manufacture. It results in the discoveqr of better and more useful materials and ulti- mately in making happier and more livable the life of all mankind, ( f3ooklet, Y-863, describing the company's plants, will be mailed upon request.

Their achievements benefit every individual wherever electricity is used, Scientific research works hand in hand with the development of new devices, more efficient apparatus and processes of manufacture.

Tne:ir advantages in pursuits of peace made them of inestimable value in time of war. A most interesting story tells of the devices e\'o lved which sub~ stantially aided in solving one of the most pnsd:-tp; problems of the war-the submarine menace. Fanciful, bu~ no Jess real, were the results attained in radio oommunication ·which enabled an aviator to control a fleet of flying battleships, and made possible the sending, without a wire, history-m~king OJes!Sag,:,s and orders to ships at sea. Scarcely less important vvas the X-ray tube, specially designed for field hospital 'JSe and a noteb1e contributior:. to the military surgical service. And many other produ.cts, for both com· batant and industrial use, did th.eir full share in securing the victory. In the laboratories are employed highly trained pn:s?sicists, chemists, metallurgists and engineers, some of whom are ex:perts of inter• national reputation. These men are working not only to convert the resources of Nature to be of service to man, but to increase the usefulness of electricity in every line of endeavor. Their achievements benefit every individual wherevel:' electricity is used. Scientific research works hand in band with the development of new devices, more efficient apparatusand processes of manufacture. It results in the discovery of bet'tei\ and more useful materials and ulti· mately in making happier and more livable the life of all mankind • Booklet, Y-863, describing the comp<'lny's plants, will be mailed upon request.

Patrick Henry remarked that l()tlly by study of the past can we form ot.11· yicws of the present, and the old system of education con- sisted o+ a respectful harkc11ing to tlile words of the elders. Chapel. by its very forms, teaches this basic put:inciple of learning anrl, w:h1le its religious importance has somewhat diminished it forms for some o-f us our only link to the teaching of otltcr years. Laying aside its more important fUt<~.ctions chapel has one other use which alone would give it reasom for existence. It does more than rout us from our ;.;lumbers while the sun is still low in the east. It Jorms an efficient and useful means of assembling the student body for i:hc indispensable personal contact. This is what renders Union what it is and thereby distinguishes it from a mere hig-her educational school.

NY. The Service of an Electrical Research Laboratory The research facilities of the General ElE:utnc Company are an asset of world-wide importance, as recent war work has so clearly demonstrated. Their advantages in pursuits of peace made them of inestimable value in time of war. A most interesting s\tory tells of the devices evolved which s~ba stantially aided in solving one of the most pressing problems of the war-the submarine menace. Fanciful, but no less real, were the results attained in radio communication which enabled an aviator to control a fleet of flying battleships, and made possible tb.e sending, without a wire, history-making messages and orders to ships at sea. Scarcely less important vvas the X-ray tube, specially designed for field hospital •:~se and a notablecontribu tion to the military surgical service. And many other products, for both corn~ batant and industrial use, did their full share in securing the victory. In the laboratories are employed highly trained physicists, chemists, metallurgists and engineers, some of whom are experts of inter- national reputation. These men are working not only to convert the resources of Nature to be of service to matl, but to increase the usefulness of electricity in every line of enJeGvor. Their achievements benefit every individual wherever electricity is used, Scientific research works hand in hand with thedevelopment of new devices, more efficient apparatus and processes of manufacture.
