It's the old Garnet fighting machin~ that goes into action on Pratt Field against the powet-fu 1 Massachusetts \ eleven. . · The varsity has staged a remarlr-1' able mid-season comeback and the bal-l ance of a victorious ·schedule hangs on tomorrows' contest. After suffering some severe set-baclls in the early part of the fall, a new! yorganized and spirit!;ld team came back and is de- serving of the most 'Worthy praise of every loyal Union supporter. The Am-I herst game has been conceded the j hardest battle of the year. lt was for I this reason that the faculty granted a half holiday ~o t:he student body in: order that the 'Garnet support would ! be \with the team.\ Zest has been a<ld ed to the organ-· ized cheering with the new football i song and the new \IJ'arldng yell,\ and, the attendance of Union men prom- · jses to be large so that the Garnet will : bark her answer tot he Blue threat. When the black cl<luds were hover- ing overhead a fe\': weeks ago much criticism was comrno n. This may or may not ha \\' be~n:: deserving. The fact remains that the men on the team had the right to co111e through and the Hilver lining is be?;inning to appear. It is an old prophes}· that the clouds look ·darl<est just boerore the storm.

Y. ica's riddle. --\Amherst Student.\ Phone 4838 118 Jay St. The Sidewalks of New York H AVE become for most of us that very short space be- tween going up and going down. We do not travel nmch on the surface these days. If our minds were a reflection of our trip through a modern city, we should be at once the most profound and the most ethereal race in the world. The escalator and elevator carry us from the subway to the sur- face, from the surface to the de-· vated subway. The baggage hoist lifts our trunks from level to level. We enter a building and mount to the fiftieth story. Indeed, we have almost abandoned the horizontal, and the force of gravity seems just a bit old fashioned. The Otis Eleva tor Company has placed at our disposal an entirely new direction. THE0ns ELEVATOR must accept a great deal of t·he responsibility for the crowd- ing of New York's sidewalks in the congested district. This seems fanciful but nevertheless it is true. Newspapers and magazines continually deplore the in- creasiagly over-crowded condition of these sirile:walks, due to the ever-increasing height of buildings. If it were not for the devef.opmen ts in the elevator industry made by the Otis Elevator Company as a pioneet, it would not have been pos- sible to erect buildings of the stupendous heigl:lts which are now in vogue. It is the high speed Gearless Elevator, now culmiBa. ting in the Sao ft. speed auto- made signal control elevator, which has made the fiftieth floor almost as avail- able in point of time as the twentieth floor, and that has, t.herefote, made it feasible to pile office on office high into the air. 0 T I S ELEVATOR COM PAN Offices in all Principal Cities d the World y E y d -t: t c d

And since the art of increasing life's comfort through smoking was discovered, no other cigarette ever made and kept so many friends. Why does Camel lead the world? Because only the choicest Turkish and Domestic tobaccos ate bought for Camels. Because Camel is given a blending that, regardless of price, can be found in no other cigarette. Because the world's largest to· bacco organi:z11tion spares neither cost nor effort to make Camel the utmost in cigat'ettes. Camel rewards its friends with never-ending peace and satisfac- tion.

You've quite outgrown that sort of thing. No dream, no religion, no morality.\ H this absence of something to be- lieve in, is the major cause to which the peculiar vagaries of Huxley's char- acters may be attributed, its signifi- cance is great indeed. One of the most pronounced symptoms arising from this majoi· cause is the boredom and utter lack oF Interest which stu•round the lives of <!lis characters. Frantical· ly, in \Antic Hay\ they seek rel'ief from this omnipresent and inescapable boredom which engulfs them on all sides, some leave for the tropics to hum carnivors among the Tikki-tikld pygmies, others seek io the clash· and blare of the jazz bands at the night club an aven.ue oi' escape. In an ex- exquisitely written cl1apter Huxley portrays a scene in one or these night clubs in which Theodore Gum bri'l and Mrs. Viveas:._ .seek refuge.

BEAT HAMILTON! The Union College Radio Club will disc on tin ue r-egu Jar f ortn.ightly m-eet- ing·s f.or a short time, according to an announcement i·ssuecl this week by the president of the m·ganizatiGn, W. S. Dewey. This move was advis-ed by, the ·executive committe-e and has been sponsored by the club as a whole, as being the most -expedient thing to do under the pres-ent circumstances. It \'ill be imposs·ible for th-e ch1b to re- locate its transmi<tting station and ex- perimental laboratory until late in the semester, and, since the very life of .the society dep-end's upon the work . done in the lab., its aims cannot at· this time be carried out. For this reason it has been deci:ded to forego further nreetings unti-l definite plans for relocating the station are at hand. In the meanwhile, Fred B. Wood- worth, chi·ef engineer, will formulate plans fm· both the receiver and trans- mitter, so that no time wi<Ll be lost in designing work after a suitable hon1e for the apparat't1s has be·en procured. As soon as this is accomplished, a . complete reorganization of th·e society will be carried out. All men inter- ested ·in the rebuilding of the set are asked to turn their names in to Wood- \Vorth at the Kappa Phi Lodge im- mediately. rJ / I I I ~/ih v PEPPERM I!NT FLAVOR' A 'lasting treat and gooa £or teeth, appetite, and digest!ion.

H A v E A M E A smoking pleasure that neYer fails ~1926 HERE is the outstanding fact of the entire cigarette industry: Camels never tire the taste, no mat- ter how liberally you smoke them; never lea11e a cigaretty after-taste. Only the choicest tobaccos that!: nature produces, only the finest blending ever given a cigarette could pt·oduce a smoke that never fails to please, that always brings the utmost in smoking enjoyment. Regardless of how often you want the comfort of a smoke, of how steadily you light one after another, Camels will never fail you, never give you any but the finesi!: thrill of smoking pleasme. That is why Camel sales, by far ~he largest i11 -the world, keep over- whehningly in the lead. Incroeasin.g millions are discovering the incom- parable Camel quality - smooth- ness and mellowness.

Christianity wa,s born in the age of Roman and Greek imperialism, in ·COlll- lJarison with which other systems seem crude. This age of ages bowed to the cross.
