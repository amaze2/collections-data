The Death of Love 'Tis sad to watch a dying friend, To see that dear life ebb away, No aid our htunan power can lend, 1'he cruel clutch of death to stay. To see those poor eyes peer and strain, 1,o nierce the veil of shadow land, '\ To see the tnuscles stiff with pain, To press th~ rapid chilling hand. But through the inky 111 ist of death, We see another purer land, \i\rhere he who faintly gasps for breath, Shall soon all pure and spotless stand. But \vhen love dies no hope is left, vVe cannot say, \ \Ve n1eet again,\ And then we doubly are bereft, When Love, the pure, the true, is slain. GEo. CoMsTOCK BAKER. At Last. I. .A. college student's roon1. Over the carpet as well as the table 'Which stands in the centre, bookti and papers are strewn in pron1iscuous heaps. Everything indicates the genuine book- wonn. In the 111idst of this litter lounges a senior ln an easy chair, his feet stretched out to a blazing grate fire. A heavy volun1e lies un- noticed on his knees and he is gazing absently at the red coals. A rap is heard at the door. JVEurphy, vaguely: \ Con1e in !\ The {loor opens and Brooks enters. Bt·ooks: \Hello Murphy, what are you dozing oYer there? Got up Hofrn1an for to- nlorro\v ?\ Jld\urphy arousing hin1self with an effort: '' Oh, after a fashion. That psychology is abontinably tough. It strikes n1e it's about ti1ne they let up son1e on us seniors. I thought we were to take things easy this year, but I haven't found anything easy yet. Sit down and tell 1ne \vhat you know about the non-ego. Have a cigarette?\ Brooks, taking a chair and lighting the cigarette : \ What I know about the non-ego ! What I know about the south-pole ! Precisely nothing. I heard sotnewhere the other day that novelists were psychologists, and hereafter I 1nean to learn 1ny psychology fron1 then1-except of course what's necessary to pass up this exanl- ination.\ J)furphy, sadly: '• I wish I could take things as easy as you do, Brooks.\ Brooks: \Why the devil can't you? What's the use of burying yourself in such a n1ess of stuff as this!\ He looks around contetnptuously at the piled-up books and 111agazine. \\. ou don't get any credit for it, do you?\ Jlfurphy: \No 1nost of the professors dis- approve of trying to read nu.tch outside of the class book&, I understand, but I have a kind of innate curiosity to find out how other peo- ple besides old Porter for instance, look at things. I suppose it is waste ti1ne !\ He takes the vohune frotn his knees and flings it itn- patiently down on the floor. Brooks: \ Thank Heaven, I haven't any • innate curiosity,' as you call it, then. But, by the way, what kind of a tin1e did you have at the Junior Assetnbly last night?\ .Jlfitrphy: '' Splendid. I thought it was very successful indeed, didn't you?\ Brooks: ~'Of course; the best thing those Juniors have done yet. I n1ean to encourage then1 to do it over.''

't 36 THE CONCORDIENSIS. There is si1ence for a n1on1ent. Jl:litrjh_:v, slowly z \BTooks what do you think of Miss Can1eron ?\ Brooks, knocldngthe ashes frotn his cigarette: \ Why, she is pleasant enough as girls go I think.\ ilfurphy, still: n1ore slowly and hesitatingly, half to hi Inset f: '' I think she's a lovely girl. Brooks, I want to tell you sotnething, and I want you to keep it perfectly secret. You know we have always been very close fi·iends and perhaps you can help tne-Brooks, I think a great deal of Miss Catne1·on.-in fact, Brooks, I believe I <.u11 in love wiH1 Miss Can1eron.\ He blushes furiously and bends over to plunge the poker into the fire. Brooks, b1ov-ving forth a cloud of sn1oke and tipping his chair back against the wall in an1aze- n1ent: '' Phew ! The deuce you say ! \ .1.lfurphy, stal poking the fire and speaking vvith nervous haste: ~' 1-.- es, I have been think- ing a great deal of her latel y-I have hardly been able to think of anyone else. And last night I had n1ade up tny tnind to propose to her-I had 1nade up n1y t'l1ind to do that any nutnber of • titnes before, but I couldn't.\ He throws down the poker and 1 eans back in his chair continuing eloquently : '' Did you notice ho\v beautiful she was last n.ight ? Those brown eyes of hers were perfectly enchanting and ball-dress never ~bowed tnore comely neck and arn1s. How ~plendidly she carried herself too, I don't think any girl ever \v-alked or danced 1nore gracefully, at least I never saw any. She has a n1agnificent figure ! Don't you think het figure is very hand- sotne, Brooks?\ Brooks, who l1as been sitting with his chair tipped against the wall eyeing his friend with a half-curious, half wnused air: '' Well, when is it to con1e oft~ anyway? .L.t\re congratulations in order? If they are, accept n1ine.\_ Murphy, putting his hand to his forehead tragically: '' Ah, that's just it. That's the trouble.\ Brooks: \ What's just it? What do you 1nean ?\ He bends forvvanl to see that his friend is not gone crazy. Jl:furphy: '\' 1 haven't proposed yet. I can't get up courage-or rather I don't know how to n1anage it. I have gone to her house over and over again detennined to tell her before ever I can1e hon1e ; and last night at the hall I thought I surely should, but son1eway I couldn't ac ... cornplish it. I can't bear to do anything in a bungling way and I was so afraid I should bungle over this that I didn't dare to try it. I've been reading high and low to learn the 1nost graceful way but neither novelist nor psychologist fron1 Spencer to Howells gives n1e any help.\ He shakes his head sorrowfully and covers his eyes with his hand. Brooks, bursting into a laugh : '' Well, I declare, Y<?U are the worst n1an· I ever saw! What earthly difference does it tnake to you hovv you do it, so only you get her to accept?\ Murphy, looking up piteously: \·But do you think she would accept 1ne if I went blun- dering into such a question as that?'' Brooks: \Just you try her and see. If she is willing to take you, I guess the words won't tnatter tnuch. I can itnagine myself waiting to find out how to tell a girl after I was in love with her! It's just like you, Murphy. It all cotnes of your polling these books so n1uch and always trying to be exactly correct about every- thing. You are getting to be a _regular r. Lang- hatn' in etubryo. Pretty soon you vvon't know whether you are in love at all or not!\ .ll1urphy, stniling sadly : \ \\. ou tnay laugh a.s tnuch as you like, n1y friend, but it's a very serious n1atter to tne, I assure you.\ Brooks, itnpatiently, lighting another cigar- ette: \ Pshaw! Stnash right ahead, old fel- low ! )..,.. ou'll cotne out all right. That's the w·ay I always do. But I say, can you lend tne your crush hat; n1ine got filled \Vith salad or son1e- thing last night. That's what I can1e in for.\ ilfurphy: \ Of course.

It-it would be quite itnpossihle to-to think of · you-with the-the ordinary--crowd of--of · dancers. .That's ~1bout what I was thinking though-I intended to express it differently.

The hat rolls on the floor and before she can rescue it the pug has seized it and torn a great hole in the crown. \ Oh, what shall I do!

It was near the close of a drovvsy day in June. The sun had left the streets, but still glistened on the church spires and tinged the far away hills with a soft argent glow. The robins vvere bidding each other a plaintive good night, as they sat red breasted on the highest trees to catch the last glitnpse of the setting sun; while unseen insects droned a lullaby. The sun descended until the robins could see it no longer, and they flew twittering away, while in the east fleecy clouds blushed a rosy good night, until the very air see1ned to take on a faint reflection. A single star showed a tiny h11ninous ·point, and twinkled and quivered with quiet pleasure. Up in a bay window, where he could see over the city and down the river, which gleatned like n1olten silver in the starlight, sat a young n1an. He too had been watching the sunset, and as the last quivering, golden ray died out in the west, his handsotne face took on a look of yearning retnnuscence. He took his cigar frotn his lips and slowly blew a cloud of thin, blue stnoke and watched the night breeze waft it away. His hand dropped to his side and he fixed his eyes on the far-distant, tnysterious star, while his eyes seetned yearning to pierce the fair canopy of soft, blue sky. \ Three years ago,\ he tnunnured, •' Three years, yet it seen1s as if she died but yesterday.\ He .slowly opened his vvatch and .gazed long on the little photograph it contained. '' It seen1s as if r could feel her presence now. She used to 1o\re roses,'' and he pressed the dainty rose he wore in his buttonhole to his lips. He rose and sighed, and leaning against the window sash, rooked far down the r·iver where tiny sparks blin'lced along the shore in the gray dusk. Sudden~y there pealed out a glad song of triutnph frotn ct neighboring church tower. Louder and louder swelled the gbd notes, telling of victory over d:oubt and despair, and of perfect faith and love. Slowly he turned his head as if in a drean1, and listened, then he n1echanically took his prayer hook, which had lain unused for so long a titne,, and quitting the house, walked towards the church with the unconscious air of a sornnatnbulist. When he entered the church, there ·were but few lights save in the chancel, and he sank unseen into a seat in the shadow of a pillar.

THE college at large can only re-echo the sentin1ent expressed in the Mail and Express regarding the condition of affairs at Union at the close of the first tenn of Dr. Webster's ad- tninistration. There has been in every depart- tnent of work, renewed zeal in the perfonnance of duties on the part of instructors and students. If the work done, with the spirit displayed in its doing be considered, if the obstacles that have been tnet and sunnounted be weighed, the 1nost severe critic n1ust acknowledge that the college is about to enter upon a future~ of renewed pros- perity and usefulness, under a leader in every way qualified for his position. * * * NEXT to a goodly endowment, Union needs a thorougl1 and effecti,.re organization of its ahunni. 'J.'he existence of the latter is assured. May the benefits and blessings of the forn1er speediily :follow ! The r:neeting and banquet of the New York: City Alurnni Association, the eady part of the n1onth, was in. every sense of the word, a success. It recalled to the tnany vvho were there assetnbled, the good old days of yore, it brougb.t together in a con1n1on cause, around a corrn11on board, rnen of divers aitns and pursuits, and it revived, as nothing else can revive; the old iliove for Alrna Mater. Fro:tn another standpoint, however, the n1eeting was pro;fitab1e, which, though of secondary itnport- ance, is a thing by no tneans to be .overlo~ked, natnely, it brong:ht the college before the world as a living insbitution, and as a potent factor in our national progress. ->1.!. -,,, * * THE present liln·ary regulation which pro- hibits students fhnn dra\ving books frotn the college library proper, is a condition of affairs that is n.Htch to be r·egrettec.l.

The pennission that is granted the students of reading the books in the library, where one has to choose behveen sitting in a roorn large ancl cold, or one close, crow·ded and badly arranged, is surely not rnuch ofa privilege. The appeal has been fi·equently tnade before, and is, we believ-e., 1nade with 1nore vehetnence this year than ever before, for the opening of the libr~ary to the students use, an-d for the systetnatic arrangetnent of its eontents that one tnay search without labor lost for the hook he wishes to con- sult.

On the adjourntnent of the business 1 neeting the co1npany betook thetnselves to the brilliantly illtn:ninated dining roorn, and pro- ceeded to dispose of a dozen of Dehnonico's courses. At the raised table at the end of the rootn sat the toashnaster, Wn1. H. McElroy, of the Tribune,· on the right, President Webster, and on his left, Hon. Warner Miller.. .At the san1e table were Judge George F. Danforth, of the Court of Appeals, Rev. Dr. Chas. D. Nott, Hon. John H. Starin, Rev. Dr. George Alex- ander, Chauncey B. Ripley, LL. D., Prof. W 111. Wells, Gen. Daniel Butterfield and Re\r. Dr. W n1. Irvin. At four other tables at right angles to the first sat the representatives of fifty-four classe~, ranging frotn '34 to '88. The two Allen boys, twins, of the class of '34, were · the oldest graduates present, and were given seats of honor. In front of the chairn1an was a large basket of flowers, while a boutonniere lay at each plate. 'I~he tnenu cards were tastefully tied with a how of garnet, the college color, and on the third page appeared the fatniliar '' Song of Old Union,\ which has opened the exercises of every con1n1encen1ent for thirty years, and which -vvas sung by the ahunni vvith as tnuch energy as their repleteness pern1itted : Then here's to thee, the brave and free, Old Union smiling o'er us, And for many a day, as thy walls grow grey, May they ring with thy children's chorus. Chairn1an Me Elroy, in opening the after- dinner speaking, said in part that the one thing which rnade hin1 sad upon this joyous occasion \\Vas the realization that the function of a pre- siding officer was not to talk, but tnerely to he the cause of talking in others. He was loaded with a speech warranted to last an hour, ·which he longed to explode. [Laughter. J Several vvinters had elapsed since the alun1ni of lTnion had dined together. During the interregnun1 they had kept asking after the health ot their co nun on 1nother with ill-concealed anxiety. 'They knew she was itntnortal [cheers,] but they realized that ternporarily she was not feeling first rate. [Laughter.

J If the college is true to what is worthiest in ,j ts. past vve need not worry about its future. [Cheers. J Mr. McElroy paid a high cotnpli1nent to the new president, Harrison E.

The cheering \\vhich greeted Dr. Webster vvhen he arose to speak in behalf of the college could have been heard blocks away. \r ociferous inquiry was tnacle as to his syn1pto1ns, and as vociferous was the answer that he vvas \ all right.\ The president tnakes no pretensions to oratory, and claitns to have gone through college without tnaking any kind of a speech in chapel or on the con1n1encetnent stage, but his class- roon1 ~' talks \ are celebrated wherever he is known, and it was one of these plain, practical talks that he gave the New York Alutnni. He said that his heart and life were hound up in Union College and there the best part of his life had been spent. l-Ie never -vvanted to go away. [Laughter. J He was never contented vvhile he was a-vvay and he was glad to get hack and go to work. l-Ie spoke in the highest tern1s of the earnest support he was .re~eiving fron1 the faculty, and of their faithfulness and devotion during the interregnutn of the presidency.

It was, I believe, the last class whose diplo1nas bear the natne of Eliphalet Nott. ... Soon after that year catne the civil war, which crippled so tnany of our colleges, North as well as South.

Hundreds of others, arnong whon1 was the boy you now call Presi- dent Webster, [cheers J dropped the text book and shouldered the 1nusket. One of the pro- fessors recruited a cotnpany on the catnpus and led it to the front, never hitnself to return. lT nion never fully recovered what she lost during the war. The tin1es since then have not been conductive to polite learning. Few who left college to enlist returned, as did President Web- ster, to con1plete the course with younger 1nen. The tin1es, too, were intensely practical. The profits of business~ etnolutnents of office drew young tnen away fron1 literary pursuits. Now, ho\vever, titnes are changing. Prosperity and leisure are bringing hack a 1nore general desire for a good collegiate education. New colleges are being built and old colleges are filling up. In this general reviYal of learning I congratulate \ Old lT nion\ that she is .joining, and that \VC have found the tnan tnost en1inentlv fitted to lead \' ELEVATING- COLLEGE STANDARDS. In rny day the require1nents for adtnission were such that a boy could generally enter college at I 6 and graduate at 20. He could thus get a start which would enable hitn to enter upon his professional or business career before he was bald-headed. [Laughter. J Now, how- ever, things are so that few n1en can graduate under 23. Then catne three or four years in the professional school or in post graduate study, and before the college tnan is really skilled in his profession or business, he is well on toward the average litnit of htnnan life. I atn not in accord with the present tendency of our colleges in tnaking the course constantly broader and n1ore difficult. THE CLASSICAL COURSE THE BEST. Another tendency of college faculties of to-day is the gradual substitution of scientific studies and tnodern languages for the good old classical course. In n1any colleges it is possible for a student to obtain the degree of Bachelor of Arts without having opened a Latin gratntnar or knowing the Greek alphabet. A careful review of the systen1 of education here and in Europe shovvs that the best results are produced by tnaking the classical course the foundation of every education. In tnany of our schools and colleges to-day they are sitnply teaching trades fron1 beginning to end, and they begin at the \vrong 9nd.

(Cheers.) CHAUNCEY'S PLASTER LEG. At this point 1\{r. McElroy read several letters frotn the altnnni or invited guests who were pre~ vented fro1n attending. Chauncey M. Depew was still contined to his house by a sprained ankle, but sent the following characteristic letter, the reading of \vhich was frequently interrupted by shouts of laughter and applause. ''I had a plaster of Paris leg built for n1e yester- day by one of the tnost etninent tnedical artists in town, over the one which has done n1e service for about half a century, with the pr01nise that it would carry tne safely to and through the Union College alurnni dinner, and afterward be placed in the MetropQlitan Museun1 of Art as a n1odel for the sculptors of the future. That leg has broken. I mn therefore prevented frotn at- tending the Union banquet, and Atnerican art has suffered an irreparable loss.

As a Regent of tl1e University of the State of Nevv l.rork, I haYe ahvays taken a deep interest and felt a patriotic pride in the oldest and tnost progressive child of the Regents.

As the ~ ~ Regents look back over the nearly cornpleted century of Union's existence, her tnagnificent educational vYork during that period, the nun1ber of tnen distinguished in every walk of life whorn she has gracltaated, and the accntnulated in~ fluences of her century upon the culture, wis- dorn and enlightened developn1.ent of the State, we feel that this first of cotntnonwealths n1ust rank as one of the n1ost iinportant factors in the developtnent of its greatness, Union College at Schenectady. Some years ago I attended your annual con1- Inencetnent, with the understanding that I was to have. no part in the literary exercises. I arrived just before the valedictory vvas delivered, \Vas rushed upon the stage and warn1ly wel- con1ed by the president. vVhile I was gasping for breath on account of the speed -vvith vvhich tvvo of the professors had hurled n1e through the crovvcl, the president said to n1e : ' The vale- dictory will take ten tninutes, and at its close I will announce you to deliver the oration upon the bi~centennial of this church in which \Ve are, and within whose \valls Union College was o,rganized, so that it will be virtually a double centennial oration.' Aghast and paralyzed, I htnnbly inquired hovv long it would take a gradu- ate of Union College, vvho had never heard before of the his tory, or life or work of the ob- ject whose double centenary was to be celebrated, to prepare a polished and accurate oration which ·would satisfy a conunencen1ent audience. lie replied that any one of then1 could do it in fifteen tninutes. Sin~ce then I have never ceased to re- gret that I clid not graduate at lTnion College after I left Yale.

One of the tnost entertaining speeches of the evening was by Prof. Willian1 Wells, on '' Ye Olden Tirne.\ It was full of happy retninis- cence and witty allusions. The professor has rounded out a full ·quarter-century at Union College and is loved and honored wherever any

He has brought along a few relics of the olden tit-ne with which to interest the \ boys.\ One of then1 vvas the. oid \three-cocked\ hat, worn by Dt. Nott on every co1nn1encement day, whose re-appearance in the hands of\' Uncle Billy\ was a signal for a hearty cheer fron'l the okler gradLuttes. Another relic was the fan1ous '' Pipe of Peace, \ fashioned after the fonn of Metnorial Hall on the can1pus, and whose coiling stetn was soletnnly passed round by each graduating class at theitclass-day exercises, and s111oked, Mohawk fashion, in token of perpetual friendship and atnity. Once tuore the professor bob bed his head under the table and this tin1e drew up an enonnous n1allet or beetle, which he called a gavel, and which he said he would present to the association. It was saturated through every pore with tnetnories of the olden tirne. The h~ad was carved frorn .a piece of the old eln1 in the college garden, under whose spreading branches Dr. Nott's favorite seat and the favorite walk of Taylor Lewis, as he walked with hands behind hitn, conununing with the invisible.

Asphalt as a Material for :Street Pave- ments. .A.sph~tlhun, or solid bitutnen, although not 'Playing so active a part in the arts and sciences as tnineral coal to which it is closely related, yet fonns an in1portant factor in our n1odern civilization. As to its origin and nature there seen1s to be son1e doubt ; ho\vever, it is believed to be of an organic nature, being fonnecl frotn the decon1posed tissues of anin1als and plants. Like coal, asphaltun1 is a hydrocarbon but it differs in the respect that it contains very little or no oxygen and a tn_nch greater atnount of hydrogen than coal, this con1posi.tion renders it fluid naturally, or it becotnes fluid when heated. It is found in the Dead Sea and in rnany other places in Asia and Europe and also in Atnerica ; the n1ost accessible and econon1ical for our own use is that obtained fron1 the Great Pitch Lake on the Island of Trinidad. This curious and ren1arkable phenon1enon is a tnass of solid pitch about a 111 ile and a half in circutnference, its surface can ht! walked upon

r /• !,{, ,. ,; \• ; ·. ' \ ~l .~: ' '.' TI-lE C'ONC:QRDIENSIS. 49 vvith in1JH:tnity in all parts scarcely giving way 1110 re tha:n to receive the in1p1~ession. of a tnan's foot. The pitch is obtained by staking out areas thirty or forty feet sq·uare and two feet deep ; when this is done the excavated space begins gradually to fill up, not by a closing in of · the walls but by a ris~ng of the bottotn, so that in a few days no sign of the excavation. is visible. As no soun.dings have ever been n1ade and the depth ofthe pitch is unknown, it is a question ,vhether we have here an inexhaustible supply. It is a retnarkable fact in the history of the useful arts that asphalt, vd1icb .. was so generally etnployed as a solid and durable cetnent in the earliest constructions upon record, as in the walls ofBabylon, should for so tnany thousand years,. have fallen well nigh into disuse an1.ong civilized nations. For there is certainly no class of 111ineral substances SO vveill fitted as the bittuninous by their plasticity, :fusibility, tenacity, aclhesive11ess to surfaces, in11)enetrability by vvater, and unchangeableness in. the ahnosphere, to enter n pon the cotnposition of terraces, foot paven1ents, roo£'3 and every kind of hydraulic work. The ·chief reason for the great durability of natural asphalt is the fact that· its bittuninous tnatter is 11ot volatile under the fiercest rays of the sun, whereas in that tnade frotn coal tar the oils are volatile and are given off under a strong sun, thus destroying the very essence of the tnaterial. Porter found atnong the ruins of Babylon large cakes of asphalt, which had lain exposed t() the elen1ents for ~11oTe than t\\-o thou- sand years in such a state ot preservation that it could be definitely told the purpose for which they hacl been used. The chief use of asphalt c~t the present day, and the head under which we will consider it is as a n1aterial for street pavetnents. When the pave- l11ent fo1· a street is under {_liscussioi1 several ' things should be taken into account before it can be fully decided upon which one wou'ld be the best, the traffic which will be ·upon it, the loca- tion, whether city or country, and the relative durability and serviceability of the different tnaterials under consideration. If it be a country road where the traffic is usually light and not -very great, it will be tno.re econon1 ica 1 a ncl sufficiently useful fen· all rcq11i red purposes, if th,e road bed be of gravel or n1acadan1 ; in the vicinity of store houses, wharves, factories, etc., where the traffic is both heavy and great, granite blocks set in concrete and their edges interlaid with asphalt are preferable, hut in onlinary residence streets, vv hich cotnprise about nineteen twentieths of the paved streets of the world, it is better frotn a sanitary anc.1 econon1ical })Oint of view, to use a sheet paven1ent. 'Granite block has t\VO advantages,-~tret1gth and durability; it is plainly evident, however, that in a granite pavetnent there can be hut little support between the stones ; if the blocks he laid on sand a heavy passing load vvill either drive then1 down in succession thus fortn ing a rut, or if alternate blocks be displaced chuck holes will be fanned ; this n1.ay be ren1·edied to a certain degree b_y laying the blocks ori concrete and placing cen1ent bebveen the joints, but as the cen1ent will vvear a way faster than the granite, depressions are caused in which the surface liquids can acctunulate and fro1n \vhich noxious exhalations arising exert an injurious effect on the in11nediate neighborhood. Another objection is the never ceasing din and noise peculiar to this pavetnent, rendering life in its vicinity anything but a pleasure. l\L Foussa- grieves, professor of hygiene at l\1ontpelier, France, says, in Teference to this noise ; ·~' I can not consider such a perpetual vibration of the nerves as hannless even for those who have been born and bred in the tnidst of the noise, and to it n1ust be ascribed the prevalence ot nervous tetnpenunents and diseases in large towns. These bvo objections constitute a very serious and just clain1 ag~tinst the use of granite blocks in a populous city. Wood as a n1,1terial for paven1ent has been in use in Atnerica for a quarter of a century. Its chief point of n1erit is its stnooth and noiseless surface, but this is 1nore than offset by its slight resistance to wear and its early tendency to decay. For about three years it ren1ains in good conditions, in the fourth holes begin to appear and in the sixth or seventh the vvhole pavetnent is one 1nass of decayed rubbish. T'he points or tnerit ,Yhich a good pavenlent should possess are stnoothness, so as to protnote an easy draft, strength, durability, noisc:Jessness

It has been endorsed by tb1e leading engineerG and authorities in our country as possessing pre-erninent fitness for all kinds of street paYeinents. The first asphalt pavetnent laid in the United States on a large scale vvas that in Washington in 1876. Previous to this 6tne theve w.as about 50 tniles of \vooden pavetnent in the city costing fotlr tnillions of dollars and although it had been laid but five years it vvas so badly V\\Qnl that the streets were i tnpassible. Congress ~tppointed a con11nission, two frorn the engineering corps and the architect of the capital to procure the '' best pavetnent.\ Forty..-one proposals were received including every variety of stone, wood, rnacadan1 and asphalt. After sotne deliberation the coln- Inission decided upon asphalt as best fitted for all requisite purposes. The pavetnent was cotnpleted in IS77 and 110\N after I I years of use it is in an excellent state of preservation. Asphalt is laid on a foundation of hydraulic concrete cernent vvith a w,caring Hlr- face of fro 111 2 to 2 Yz inches. 'I'his surface is capable or ·wearing for 111any years and vvhen necessary can be replaced at a stnalt proportion of the original cost. The objections against asphalt haxe been non- durability and slipperiness, but these objections, after n1any severe tests, can scarcely hold good. In St. Louis, a load of9o,ooo pounds placed on rollers passed over asphalt -vvithont lea\·ing a single 1nark whereas the stone paved streets were tnarked by deep itnpressions \rese1nbling those seen in a faulty water Ina in ditch after a heavy rain stonn.\ Experitnents n1ade in other cities \vhile not as severe as that in St. Louis only prove tnore fully the durability and strength of asphalt. As to slipperiness. The result of a long series of observations in different cities of the United States for about six n1onths in \Vhich Soo,ooo horses vvere observed, shovvecl that on the average a horse travelled 583 tniles on asphalt before falling, and on a stone pavetnent 413 ~ or there vvere 4r per cent n1ore :fitlls on the stone than on thP asphalt. If this test is regarded as ntir and honest, and \Ve have no reason to believe otherwise, then the question of slipperi- ness or non-slipperiness of asphalt in con1parison with other durable pavetnents is definitely settled. The dai n1 has also been urged against this pavetnent that in the event of the freezing of the \Vater n1ains, the expense and trouble necessary to reach then1 through this pave1nent wouTd he considerably heightened. But as asphalt is a non-conductor of heat, it acts as an insulator protecting the n1ains frotn aH clin1atic inflt·teaces. 1'he a(h~antages vvhicb asphalt claitns as peculiarly its ovvn nre as follovvs: Cleanliness, because no clust is generated by .abrasion of its surf~tce and because it can be washed and kept as clean as a floor at a very 1noderate expense. l-Iealthfulness, because it is inpervious to sur- face liquids, the tnain Cc:tllSe of all 111aladous diseases. Q!-1ietness, because there IS absolutely no llOISe. rrraction, because being one continuous, ev,en paven1ent it is free fro1n all ruts and holes thus increasing the tractive power of Yehicles. \ If one horse can just draw a load on a level on iron rails it \v.ill take I 7'.3 horses to dnt\V it on asphalt, 3Yz on the best Belgian block pavetnent, 5 on the ordinary Belgian paven1ent, 7 on good cobble stones, IJ on bad cobble stones, 20 on ordinary earth and +o on a sandy road. There- fore a city paved with sheet asphalt \vill save to itself and its citizens frotn zoo to 300 per .cent of the cost to it and then of transporting passengers and goods as C<Hnparecl \Vith a city paved \vith blocks. This saving will, in a large city, atnount to thousands of dollars daily and the yearly aggregate will doubtlessly be large enough to pave the city. It is also plain that the value of real estate bordering on asphalt paved streets 1~1ust be considerably increased by such a pave- tnent. Therefore, revie\ving all the p'oints pro and con it seen1s to n1e that asphalt, as a n1aterial for street paven1ents, has no equal. Deep Foundations. rfhe cheapest and the tl10St COllll110tl founda- tion when the vvater is shallow, and where a hard 1naterial underlies a soft tnud, is the pile foundation. It is easily and q uicl-dy constructed and is in 1nany cases very strong and pernutnent. vv'hen the foot of the piles rests on a solid foundation and \vhen the lateral stabiEty is assured by the nature of the tnaterial into which it is driven or by son1e artificial rneans, the sup- port afl'orded by it is tneasured by its ability to resist crushing and is usually estitnated at 1000 pounds per square inch, in which case the pile is supposed to be beyond the reach of an attack of sea vvon11S.

Myers found that piles driven: in nhnost liquid n1.ud. vvoul~l take 13,ooo pounds to start thetn, the pile betng 30 or 35 feet in leHgth. Pile foundations situated in a swiftly flo\ving river, or where n1asonry on then1 is subject to a very great p1·essure frotn ice, are not to be recotntneruded and if they are built they should be ex~tnined frotn year to year to see that the tnaterial rs not scoured a\vay fron1 bhe piles by the current of the river. Pile foundations are sotnetin1es covered with layers of concrete to give the1n 1nore stability. Each layer is about r foot in thickness. Another 1nethod of laying foundations is by 1neans of caissons which are a kind of flat- hotton1ed boat upon vvhich the foundation .courses of so1ne structure, which is to stand in the water, are bui,lt and then it is towed to its intended site. They are used in a g-reat n1any ca·ses. The largest ever constructed \-Vere those upon which the piers of the Brooklyn bridge rest.

The tnud and other 1naterial beneath it was ren1oved by tneans of open water shafts and Ct11111nings' dredges. The shafts were round, having a diatneter of 7 9 as they wou1d better resist a bursting pressure in case it becatne necessary to hlo\v \\'ater out frorn thetn. Since these shafts have to he cut off vvhen solid botton1 is reached, they were pro- vided with caps and air chatnbers of their own. Besides these rnain shafts -vvere 58 iron pipes fron1 3Yz to 4 inches in diatneter to let out sancl and other stnall n1aterial which tnight be en- countered. 'I'hese were brought into service at a depth of 6o feet ; sand was discharged by 1neans of ail' pressure frotn three of these at the rate of one yaTd in 2 tninutes to each pipe and it took 14 n1en standing in a circle around the pipe to keep enough sand to supply each one. At a depth of 68 feet, boulders too large to be taken out vvere -tnet vvith, and the water shafts had to be cappecl and the \Vater blown out fro1n then1. There \vere 4 supply shafts~ two 21 feet in d~an1eter, and the other tvvo were only 2 feet in dtan1eter and by n1cans of these they supplied the 1nen with concrete which was used in filling up .the air chatnbers. The caisson is so1neti1nes held in position when it is sunk by rneans of strong supports hut this is not necessary except when the \Vater is of great depth and there is a strong current. At the sinking of the caisson of the Havre de Grace bridge, suspension was not resorted to and the change of position was not over 18 incbes, and this produced little or no effect. Concrete is often used as a foundation belovv the surface of the water and it is just as durable and 1nuch cheaper than tnasonry. · Broken stone is son1.etitnes 1nixed with it as it tnakes it cheaper and sotne engin.eers claitn that it gives the con- crete tnore strength. Concrete, when once placed in position should not be disturbed. and it should be ratntned as deposited. Another kind of foundation is the Tubular foundation, vvhich has been successfully used both in Europe and A:tnerica ; it consists of large cylinders tnade of cast iron which are filled with concrete and rubble rnasonry. In the construction of the centre pier of the Albert bridge, at Saltash, on the Connvall rail- way, a wrought iron cylinder, 37 feet in dian1eter and 90 feet long, \Vas sunk through n1ud and sand to solid rock. The tnud and shells which filled the cotnparttnents into which it was divid{~d were ren1oved by n1ean~~~of air and water purnps. ''SPECIAL\ PROFITABLE VACATION WORK.
