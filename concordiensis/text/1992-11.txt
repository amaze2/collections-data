DISCUSSION AT \TOWN METriNG\ ON SOCIAL ISSUES By Veroniea Rogers Associate News Editor A week ago today there was a \Town Meeting\ held ill Memorial Chapel. The topics of discussion were the social policy, the location of Chet's~ professor's expectations of students, and other issues directly involving the student body. The panel w.as comprised of President Hun~ Dean Mammola, Dean Alford~ Dean Underwood, and members of the Student Forum. The audience was filled wi.tlt students, faculty, amd administrati<>n. President Hull spoke first, bringing up the social polic~. He noted that the administration's awareness of problems that existed last year was a main reason that the already existing social policy was more strictly enforced this year. He als<> mentioned the fear amongst the faculty that students didn't seem to be putting as much effort into classes as might be expected. President Hull stated that a change had to be made in order for the faculty to feel more confident about student performance. Alex Sklavos, Stude11t Forum President, brought up the discussion over the location for Chet's. Recently there has been some disagreement about fmding the best place to house Chet's. Although the Student Form originally elected to place Chet's in the College Center, some Forum members now believe that the Rathskellar might be a better location. . The biggest concern with moving Chet's to the Rathskellar is safety. The ceiling to the Rathskellar is quite low, and because it is underground it is prone to floods during rainstorms. Chet's staff thinks that the bar should stay at the College Center so it can have a chance to prosper. It should not have been expected that Chet's would be a huge success right away; it needs time to build up a reputation. President Hull agreed that Chet's should stay in the College Center specifically for the safety reasons. President Hull mentioned tile student body's desire to have more social alternatives. He stated tllat diversity of options is essential, and that the administration wants to act on student's suggestions for social alternatives. So far, the Gym hours have been extended, and the weekend movie can now be seen on Mondays too. An idea that may be implemented soon is the sponsoring of dry parties in fraternity houses. Money would have to be raised to hire entertainment and buy extra food. The administration stresses that they appreciate suggestions. but students must take into consideration that the campus space is limited. Dean Underwood changed the subject by introducing the conflict professors are having with some students. He stated tllat although across the board Union students work hard, specifically there are extreme variations of academic performance from student to student. The students who faculty are concerned with are those who cut many classes, or come to class with hangovers, or seem to be putting less effort into their work. By enforcing the social policy, which states there will be no parties during the week, the administration hopes that students will come to class more prepared and motivated. Some of the audience stated that the library needs to be renovated in order for it to be more conducive to studying. The school is hoping to work on renovating and expanding the library, but there are other priorities that must be attended to before the library can be fixed. Back on the social issue, there was a question of societal influence on college students conti11oed on pg. 3 by David Levine Associate News Editor Brian Holloway, a former defensive lineman for the New England Patriots, delivered an inspirational speech to students interested in assisting the cleanup in the wake of Hurricane Andrew. The speech took place in Upper Class Dining Hall on November 3 at 11:30 a.m. Holloway was introduced by David Mulholland, the coordinator of Union's relief effort. Mulholland described Holloway as a man with a \big frame (6'7\ 307 pounds), and · an incredibly big heart.\ Holloway's family had been involved in charitable services, his grandfather co-founded the United Negro College Fund in the 1930s. Holloway described his involvement in community service at the beginning of his appeal. He has been involved in the Special Olympics, and has had input in the New York State Division of Youth. Holloway described how although he had \lived a dream\ by !!laying in the National Football League, and being selected to the pro bowl four times, that the most important work he did during his playing career was his community service involvement. Holloway felt that playing football had left him with an incomplete experience. He set up the first College Degree Completion ·Program for College Athletics during his rookie year in the N .F .L. · Holloway spoke at over 225 high schools in Massachusetts dwing his career, explaining to the students how involvement in their communi ties \c()uld make a difference.\ Holloway recalled his visit ;to tenninally ill children, and how it helped t() shape his ;perspective on the .importance of community i1rvolvement. He discussed hoVI the nurses were concerned tllat he might act improperly .around the children. The children responded well to Holloway's 'Carefree style, and. he recollects how good he felt when he was able to bring srn iles to the faces of the childre11. Holloway showed the rest of ;the country how he could lead individuals to chan table cau.ses in the wake of t11e Challenger ·disaster of 1986. Holloway . said that, like a 1<>1 of otller Americans, he questioned \Who was going to complete the dream?\ Holl<Jway wanted to become inv<Jlved in a .program that woald encourage st11dents to pursue tl1eir dreams, a.nd in a sense \to complete the mission\ left unf11lfi1Jed by the e:xplosion of Challe11ger. Holloway organized an auction. The auction, whose sale items were donated by members of the N.F.L., raised $110,000 for the Challenger F<>undation. He remembers having convinced U.S. A. Today to run a full page .advertisement publicizing the .auction at no charge. The editors, who wanted $65.000 to mn the advertisement. were persuaded by H()lloway to publish it gratis. Holloway llad expressed t() the editors their obligation \t() all people holding on to hopes a.nd dreams.\ The Foundation. wllich was a fledgling ()rganization in 1986, now has a $52 million endowment. Holloway encouraged st!ldents to become involved in the relief effort to Homestead. He guaranteed that after volUilteering and serving in the ,effort that \You will look at experiences differently,\ and that \Your life will never take on such a meaning (as it did volunteering).\ Holloway dramatized the significance of the impact that joining the effort would have on students by saying involved students would be making \A date with destiny.\ The former football player informed the students that all tile hard work that they put in at school is nothing compa1ed to the .struggles of victims of Hurricane Andrew. Holloway infonned students that there might \)e a time in -their lives when they wiH require another individual to comfort and assist them in the continued on pg. 2

NEWS PROFESSOR MARTEN RECEIVES GRANT TO CONDUCT SEMINARS by Alexis Leist Concordiensis Staff Professor Marten, a member of ,the Union College English Department, has been granted over seventy thousand dollars to conduct a seminar for high school teachers. The grant was awarded by the National Photo by Dave Cho Endowment of Humanities (NEH), which sponsors th~se seminars in order to provide high school teachers with advanced studies of humanities teJ<ts. The process by which seminar directors are. chQsen is .. very selective. Candidates must send in an application and are chos-en on the basis of their seminar proposals, record as a tea.cher and scholar, and the capacity of the institution wher-e tlte seminar will be held. Ollce tile NEH has chosen a director. information regarding the semin!lF is sent to sixty tho·usand hjgh schools across the country. High school teacllers must apply to get a place in the seminar and are provided with a stipend for travel and living expenses. There are only fifteen spots available in the seminar. Participants will be chosen by Professor Marten, a colle:ague from the Union Engliish Department, and a high school teacher. ~he seminar will take place for ftve weeks during the summer. The group will meet four days a week for ~two hours. The teachers are considered faculty and live with each other. The course provides a chance for these teachers to take part in energetic conversation among peers. It is an atmosphere of learning and discovering. Professor Marten's seminar focuses on fo11r novels by Joseph Conrad: Lord Jim, the Secret Agent, Nostromo, and Under We-stern Eye-s. In these books. Marten plans to explore the search for commitment in a world that often seems with(;)ut meaning. In Lord Jim, the seminar will focus 011 Conrad's notion of artistic and philosophic truth and will consider matters such as; the notion of individual choices, attitude towards loyalty, friendshiJ>, and duty, and his experiments with descriptive and symbolic language in order to reveal the truth. In the NostroltUJ, a novel of political revolution in Latin America, the relationship of idealism to :;kepticism, national interests to material interests, and commitment to· betrayal will be hi~hlighted. Members will discuss Conrad's despair towards the modern world in the Secret Agent, and the ~practical a~d moral ramifications of gudt and redemption in Under Western Eyes.

One of the already e~isting is Chefs. There has been much debate about its location and its environment. Because we feel this .is an important decision that every student should be involved in, we as a Forum have provided Town Meetings as an outlet for input from the campus community. Participants at both meetings provided many suggestions that we explored. Howev:er, we have found that its present location is best, given its pl.ll]Klse. Chet's was created by the S tu<lent Forum to provide students, faculty, and administration with a common place to gather. The central feature continues to be entertainment, not alcohol consumption. Chet's has something to offer everyone. and now that we [the Student Forum and administratoos] have agreed upon its present location. we can concentrate on improving what ~lready exists. Suggestions are always welreme! We believe Chel's can work~ Last Wednesday, the Senior Class was host to a Seni()r Bash at Chet's:. One hundred and sixty .. five seniors showed up for the free food, D.J .• and cash bar. The seniors we spoke to afterward did enjoy the :Bash {including those 25% who are not yet 21), proving that Chet's can offer a positive social alternative. Student Forum held another Town Meeting last Thursday. Although student atten<lance was down from the last meeting, we did have a small number of administrators and faculty present. We would like to thank those faculty members who showed their dedication to campus concerns. The topi_cs we discussed ranged from SOCial to academic issues. It was a wonderful opportunity to bear the concerns and expectations each side has regarding the future of Union College. We cannot expect to make impr&vements if we do not take tbe opportunity to voice them constructively. Student Forum meetings focus on many important issues. We are representing your voice to ~h.e administration. However, It ts important that we know your concerns if we are to advocate change. . Please attend your class meetings, speak with your representatives, and attend Student Forum Meetings. Our last meeting of the term will be held Monday the 9th, at 6:30 in CC409. Run-offs for Fresltman Class Representatives will be held Friday. Please Vote! Congratulations to the new representatives! HOLLOWAY Fiji Hosts Haunted House for Charity SPEECH continued from pg. 1 same manner that they are being asked to assist victims of th.e storm. He stated that \It will be a person that holds yow hand that will make the difference.\ Holloway concluded with an excerpt from a speech from John Fitzgerald Kennedy : \If you do not care, and do not try, you will harbor the results of indifference; A world that would be better if you cared and tried.\ The audience was made aware of how much Brian Holloway cares. In the auction that he orchestrated he sold every trophy and awar~ he h~d ever 1·eceived, includmg hts Super Bowl ring. David Mulholland and Brian Holloway encouraged college students. Union students in particular, to volunteer some of their time to help fellow Americans in need. VOTE ON FRIDAY by Caroline Paine Concordiensis Staff On October 29 the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity house was transformed into a residence of ghosts, mummies and gllouls for the fraternity's second an11ual haunted house with tbe local branch of Big Brothe.rs}Big Sisters. All Union students participating in the Big Brothers/Big Sisters program in Schellectady were invited to attend with their little \brothers\ and \sisters.\ The eveni11g's festivities, which lasted from 4 to 7 pm, included a barbecue.style dinner, games, costllmes, grab bags and of course a chance to tour the mysteriously haunted upstairs suits. Tile little \brothers\ and \sisters 1 \ accompanied by their bigger counter parts, sampled the scary and super natural on the second and third floors of Fiji. Stories were told ~f a certaim Union pre-medtcal student who died from a work over ]()lad, was mummified and walks the donn halls. His dead body reamed the house along with a giant gorilla and two zombies. In the bathroom the famou; \Psycho\ shower scene wa& w118Cted and in another room a mad scientist ' . . preformed btzarre operations. Everyone: agr~ed ~at all the rooms were frightenmg but the most frightening was the \Psycho\ shower. \I'~ so scared, I'm shivering~\ admitted Jasmine Ruiz, a fourth grade student at Pleasa11t Valley Elementary Scho()l, after experiencing the haunted house, 1 'Tbe bathmom was definitely the best.\ J &e Saltz bart, of Phi Gamma Delta, collaborated with the Union st1.1dent coordinator of Big Brothei'S/Big Sisters, Jerry Juliano, to organize the event. The evenittg's objective we~s to create the best possible time for tlle little \brotherS\' and \sisters.\ \We enjoy being involved with the community and llelping the little guys <>ut \ S altzbart reflected while se~ing marshmallow pumpkin candies to the \little guys,\ \But we want to let other houses ,get involved too.\ The Big Brother/Big Sisters program at Union needs more people to be involved. \A lot of people want to do it but never follow through,\ said Juliano. \We need new people and we need more of them to follow through on their interest.\ The program serves the big \'brothers\ and \sisters\ as well as the children. \It is a social alternative,\ observed Aaron Epstein of Phi Gamma Delta, \You can take your little brother or sister out instead of 'going 011t' on campus. These things [Like the haunted house] are good to come to so you can meet everyone.\ Everyone who met at Fiji for the haunted house seemed to have a great time. Rlliz summed up the spirit of tile evening when she exclaimed~ \I had a really fun time.\

November 5, 1992 Page 3 PROFESSOR FRIED LEADS ECONOMICS RESEARCH by Christoph Ringwald Concordiensis Staff Stim11lated by eight faculty development workshops given by the e~onomics department over the ~past two years Economics Professor Hal Fried has researched the efficiency and evaluated the perfonnance ofproduclion units. · With the help of Union College Professors, Suthathip Y aisaw arng and Eshragh Motohar and Professor Knox Lovell <if the University of North Carolina. Professor Fried explored the characteristics of hospital mergers, evaluated the effective11ess of the United States economy, and examined the performance of credit unions. Professor Fried's work involved analyzing the inputs and outputs of a Decision- · Making Unit, also :known as a DMU. A credit union is an example of a DMU. With the information about a J?MU's i11puts and outputs, lmear programming techniques were used to establish and calculate a \best practice frontier .. \ According to Professor Fried, a \best practice frontier\ i<lentifies DMUs that are one hundied per cent efficient in the sense that they obtain maximum output for given inputs. DMUs are also measured quantitatively. While efficient DMUs receive a score of 1, all inefficient DMU's are given a score greater than 1. A score of 1.2. for exrunple, means that . . . Photo by 1f a fiml were to operate at optimal efficiency, it could produce 20 per cent more of all its outputs without any increase in inputs. \Once efficiency scores have been identified for a sample of production units, it is interesting to attempt to explain variations in efficiency. To what extent is inefficiency due to government regulations. geographic location . . . ' umomzation, or management philosophy?,\ questioned Professor Fried. Alongside Professor Lovell , Professor Fried applied his methodology to credit unions. Professors Lovell and Fried analyzed and calculated the efficiency of 894 7 credit unions in the United States. In general, the level of inefficiency of United States credit unions is about 20 per cent, which is similar to what other researchers have found for banks. The goal of the research is to identify the most efficient credit unions and have them serve as role models for improving the perlonnance of less efficient DMUs. Professor Fried's research has had the effect of encouraging students to do similar studies. Seniors Darren Dahl and Donna Ashton are applying Professor Fried's methodology in their research papers. Dahl is examini~g the performance of major league baseball teams and Ashton is comparing the efficiency of rice .production in Japan and the United States. Meanwhile, Senior Eric Cressman explored the macroeconomic perfonnance of the United States' economy and Senior Craig Randall examined the performance of local real estate firms. Finally, Senior Dave Robison identified credit unions that serve the interests of the borrowers as well as savers. NEWS TOWN MEETING t!Oiltinued from pg. 1 a.nd why drinking is a social alternative. Most people seemed to believe that students d:rlnk to relieve tension, and diinking is accepted by society as a means to relax, The argument at Union is that the stu<lents have taken it to an extreme. Whatever images of <Jr,inking that society projects, most kids think it is acceptable to party hard often. Thor Benander stated that the major problem with Union is tllat the school is not unified. Freshman come to Union and besides Orientation, they have noreal guidance or knowledge of what's available to them. S~udents find it easy to dt,s~<Jver Fraternity parties and m~ny freshman fr.el that there is n<Jt much else to do besides going to these parties. Be!iander said that Union was too ~pathetic, and to fight this stigma there needs to be a change in the way students are introduced to college life, be~inning in freshman year. 7his year, there was a fresbman camping trip that preceded Freshman Orientation. It was a great success for the participants, with one freshman . from the audience saying that r the !poople she met on the trip 1 all bonded together. President ! H11ll stated that he believed that after a few years of developing the camping trip il should become more popular. It is hoped that it will be helpful to freshman who can use guidance during the hard transition from high school to college. Another idea to help freshman was to start a big brother/big sister program. This program w()uld take volunteer upperclassmen and place tllem with a freshman. The upperclassman would be tllere as an advisor and a friend from the beginning to give freshman \sibling\ guidance and insight into what is ahead. If freshmen feel as though they have more knowledge and direction right from the start, tlley might be more willing to get involved and make it a better and more unified i11stitution. Although the meeting cllanged locations from Memorial Chapel to the R athskellar (courtesy of President Hull). the issues that were discussed during the previous hour and a half continued. It appears that the current dilemmas facing Union will have no definite end, but (hey can be dealt with if students continue to attend meetings and voice not only opinions, but ideas that could make Union a better school.

N ovembe1 5, 1992 Page 5 NEWS ANALYSIS CLINTON WINS by Jim Polites News Anlllysis Editor On Monday~ President Bush traveled throtJgh six states {encompassin~ about 1,650 miles) in an increasingly desperate attempt to dose the eight point lead enjoyed by his Democratic cllallenget. Bill Clinton's schedule was even more 'chaotic- within a 29 hour period he logged 4,100 miles :between Philadelphia and Denver, furiouSly driving home his message of' change. Ross Perot meanwhile, chose to let television commercials do his last minute campaigning. Such is the nattJFe of a race that has produced striking contrast, intrigue, and surprise. As we alllmow by now, Bill Clinton from Arkansas is the country's Presi!lent-elect. My feeling about the election on Tuesday at the outset was one of ambivalence. Was Clinton's lead going tO- hold? Would President Bu~h's late surge continue? Co11ld Ross Perot really make a difference- even if it was in voter turnout? Well as the returns trickled in .from around the nation, it became clear tftat 1992 would not serve as the theater for the greatest comeback in Presidential race history. Perhaps in an attempt to keep peQple glued to their televisiolls early on, the networks re.ported President Bush holding a 43%-41% l~d in the popular vote. Unfortunately only 2% of the precincts ,in the entire country had been tabulated. Quickly though. Clinton was pronounced the winner in West Virginia (no surprise there). New Hampshire, Vermont, and Georgia. The latter three were states that had come to be known as Republican staples of support, yet this time around they no doubt provided ominous signs of failure to the GOP. These feelings were confiimed when the next set of returns came to light- Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Jersey, Maryland, Massachosetts, Missouri, Connecticut, Maine, -and Washington, D.C. all voted Democrat and the rout was on. In the :race's infant stages, Mr.Bush could only lay claim to Dan Q11ayle's home state of Indiana, South Carolina. Oklahoma, and V il'ginia. By this point though, the electoral college count read 239 - 46 (with 27Qneeded to win). The Clinton/Gore team had effectively severed Republican strongholds in the South and suburbia- their electoral plan was carried out to perfection. Something interesting to note is that in the last 60 years, incumbent Presidents had been defeated just twice before. Both Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Carter (and now Bush) had been ousted thanks to their service during economic deterioration. It is now up to Bill Clinton to prove that a Democrat can revive our struggling economy rather than perpetuating the misery. All of the students on this campus are used to the Reagan/Bush years as they have presided over the United States for three terms now- over a recession in the early 1980's, anather one now. the fall of Communism, the Gulf War, and much else. Indicative of polls everywhere though, the MTV generation (18-24) was calling for change. On Election Day, half the voters in this age group were going to cast their ballots for Clinton while just 30% intended to vote for the reelection of the President. I think this trend was. probably the most col!fageous of all, for we were all just toddlers the last time a Democrat was popularly elected to occupy the White Ho:use. We have heard the ho~ror stories of Jimmy Carter's reign as Chief Executive, bu~ with the Republicans finding few answers for a domestic age.nda, it was indeed a time to- try something new. Reuters Having said that, it is obvious that Americans perceive our situation as needing someone new to lead us toward the 21st century. Thus,. people opted for the voice of change rather than that of experience. Rather than second-guessing, let us make certain that we hold President- elect Clinton accountable for the types of programs and investment stimulation he has promised. George Bush maintained throughout the past year that the gridl()cked, Democratic Congress was to blame for much of the nation's ill fortune. Mr. Clinton will not be able to levy such charges- in this sense his job is a bit more difficult. Before wrapping up I rnusl mention something about Ross Perot. He gave a great number of otherwise disenfranchised people in this country reason ---. ~--------- .------ •·- ·--- -~------------------- My intent here is certllinly not to belittle tbe accomplishments of o~()rge Bush- nothing could be fmher from the truth. He has served the United States admiraiJiy as an tepresentative, ambassador, CIA Chief. Vice President .. and President. Mr. Bush was instrumental in pushing changes that have surfaced around the world and he still holds the modern record for popularity immedi:ately following his leadership d11ring the Persian Gulf Crisis. And yes, all of us can go tolled at night knowing that the threat of nuclear war has been greatly diminished. We- and our f11ture families- owe George Busb an enormous debt of gratitude. to participate in 1992- whether it was by volunteering for his campaign corps or simply by voting. The turnout for this election was predicted to be high, and as Dan Rather said on CBS Tuesday,\everybody wins when a majority of the people vote.\ That message is clear indeed.

ARTS and ENTERTAINMENT N overnJ)e:r 5, 1992 Page 6 Free to Be You and Me by Carrie Sherman Arts Editor On Sunday morning, at a brunch for parents weekend, an? on Monday evening, Mountebanks put on a production entitled, \Free to Be You and Me.\ This show was directed by Thor Benander and all of the sets, costumes , music and actin was done by .. students (with the exception of one actor). (I had to include Thor's name because he is pretty much the only person in this school who ever writes articles for the arts page.) The program was made up of a series of short skits, so11gs and poems read and perfonned by one or more students. I attended the Monday evening show and was both surprised and pleased to see what a large crowd there was for the performance. Personally, I thought this program was perfectly timed. I have started to encounter the eighth week blues. I think most of you can relate. The weather is horrible, tO() much work, too little time, no parties( or a limited number), very little money in the bank account. Basically, we want to get out of here. Maybe I'm just a pessimist and life really isn't so bad here at U.C., but tb.at's how I've been feeling. So now lUI get back to the point, Free Body Workshops at Union Courtesy of Arts Department A consortium of 6() local body workers, dancers, process oriented psychotherapists, dance therapists, message therapists and artists are hosting 7 Master Innovators in the field of body-mind research. Each educator specializes in a different technique. but all are committed to advanced learning about the body through experiential practices. The individual workshops (some are half day, some are full day) are scheduled at a rate of o11e per month and have a limited enrollment. The workshops are taking place at Union College, Performing Arts Department.

Going' mto Old Chapel sitting down with your friends and listening to \Glad to have a Friend Like You\ \Puff Hre Magic Dragon\ and hearing poems about the girl who was too sick to go to school until she realized it was Saturday, and the tale of Dudley Pipin definitely brought me back, made me smile and laugh. However, in the Dudley Pipin skit there was a little reality kick when the pr.incipal(Prof. Scullion) asked Dudley if he wanted a Marlboro. One key aspect of goiag back to the childhood was sitting on the floor. How often do you go to a play and sit Oil the floor? How often did y-ou do this when you were seven. I think for this hour I alm()st felt like I was seven, and I liked it . I didn't think about rny thesis or my resume or anyt1Jing. I just sat back and found myself knowing the words to these silly poems and wishing I was young again. The singing, acting, and recitals in the performance were all very well done. I must complement Mountebanks 011 a great performance and for the opportunity to allow me and others to escape Union life while at Union for a short time.

Cindarella story.\ \Na na na ml na.\ ''River'' Quiet but Pow:erful by Thor Alexander Benander Arts Writer Robert Redford delights us with his newest creation, A River Runs Through lt, the moving story (.)f the Maclaine family of rural Montana during the first half of the twentieth century. The story takes its audience from the childbood of Norman and Paul Maclaine to their entrance into sooiety as men. Without boring us, Redford runs through twenty five years of their lives, highlighting the seldom seen rites of manhood to accentuate their growth process. By the end, we relate to the characters, connecting them with our own families, our own friends, and our own fears. Tom Ske:rrit (Top Gzm) leads the cast as the morally staunch Presbyterian Minister and head of the Maclaine hou:Sehold. His views are cast in stone, and his well-directed performance sets the stage for the two boys. The central character is Norman, played by Craig 'Sheffer. A difficult rol'e to master, :lle pulls it off without losing his character, a distinctioll which is a credit to both his acting ability and the control of Redford, the Director. The part of his :rebellious younger brother is played by Brad Pitt, .(Thelma and Louise), who is quite possibly the biggest superstar prospect around. Besides being incredibly handsome, he has an easy acting style, which draws women to him and yet does not alienate men. He utilizes :hhis to its fullest in River, 'O.IItlining the rise and fall of a simple country boy from the back woods. I have never been a fan .of tisb.ing, so I was initially taken aback by the previews which featured scenes of fly fishing.

November 5, 1992 Pag~ 7 BUSINESS· and FINANCE STEMPEL QUITS AS HEAD OF ·GENERAL MOTORS ·by Shields Day Business Editor \Today I informed the GM board of directors that I was resigning as chairman and c,h.ie.f executive officer, effective immediately, .and that I would serve at the pleast:tre of the board until a successor could be named . . . \ These were the parting words from General Motors' chairman and chief executive officer Robert C. Stempel. The surprise announcement came last Monday as one of the most powerful men in Detroit abdicated his throne. This is the second time in six montils that General Motors has had a major shakeup in their hierarchy. Stempel took over the position last spring when the previous head of GM quit in a move similar to George Stempel's. Both General Motors' employees as well as the press were caught completely off guard by this surprise change of officers. This impromptu movement by Stempel will certainly lead to many long meetings as GM scrambles to put their company back together again. Stempel's short term at the helm of one of America's largest companies has many employee!; worried about their jobs. Since the upper level mana'2ement will be going through a rigorous transformation, all GM workers are worried about what will happen to them. Mally feel that Stempel was never really given a fair ch~ce as the head of GM. Since his induction into his position, the recession has Hot had a very dramatic change. Stempel has only been in a position to things for two years, which is hardly enough time to revamp a compapy that has been floundering for over seven years. He never really got a chance to test out the full power of his office. Workers liked Stempel because he was one of the few men at his position who received a training in engineering. He is one of very few at his level that is as much a car enthusiast as he is a businessman. Magazine and television commercials are boasting claims of.a strengthening in the United States auto industry. American cars are supposedly being built better and stronger than they have been for the ,past twenty years. After being h.umbled by the Japanese auto industry for so long. the U.S. is showing impressive signs of rebuilding. GM's best asset at the moment is their Saturn line of cars. This particular line of \ cars is considered to be at the same level of many European and Japanese cars. The question still remains, how can General Motors get rid of their top man when everything seems to be on track for a strong U.S. recovery in the auto industry? One problem is the lack of positive quarterly sales results over the past four quarters. Unfortunately, it seems that the outside directors may be THURSDAY, missing the point. They may be looking only at the bottom line and not taking into account the potential the next few years may have to offer. Stempel was very concerned with employee content. One of his major contfibutions to the company was a 3.35 billion dollar program that was designed to imp:rove jobs and income security. This program, when put alongside three quarterly 'losses in a row, have not brou~ht much. money back into the Detroit based firm. One reason for the second change in six months may be due to the fact that G M keeps putting their own men into the top positions. G M may be better off by hiring someone from outside the firm to come in and run the company. This way the new head will not have any qualms about firing another head officer if necessary. This is one of the major complaints H. Ross Perot had . during his brief involvement with GM a few years hack. It will take quite a while for investors to regain their confidence in GM stock once again. Even the appointment of their new head - when G M assigns one - should not have too great an effect on the price of GM. Look for GM stock to hover around its current price of 22 1/4 or possibly slip down a few more points.· Recovery may not come around for three to four months unless there is a dramatic increase in GM car and truck sales. NOVEMBER 5, 1992, 7:00 PM COLLEGE CENTER AUDITORIUM Sponsored by the Latin American Studies Program; tire General Education Board; Pili Beta Kappa; the History, Political Science and Mod(!m Languages Departments; ALAS. Money and the Market by Gary Chase J3usiness Staff Pre-election jitters seemed to ease, and the market made some significant gains this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied late Monday and the average reached 3244. Tuesday's market chose not to react to the surprisingly good economic report that gross domestic ,product had grown 2.7% in the third quarter. Rumors of president Bush's gain in the polls sent Wed11esday's market on a mild rally and the average finished at 3251. Thursday, the Dow lost 5 points to close at 3246. Friday's market, after several bad economic reports, sent the Dow reeling to 3226 for a 20 point loss. 1'be bond market spent anotller week in uncertain territory. The benchmark of the bond market, the thirty year treasury posted a modest gain for tile week. This could also be due to the gains Bush posted in the I>Olls last week. It's about on Tuesday afternoon. John Schachnovsky (of Schach Talk fame) and myself are sadly watching George Bush's reign as president of the United States come quickly to an end. At this point, the election appears to be lost. Therefore, I have decided to focus on the impact that a Clinton win will have on the tond market and why we've all heard that bonds are suffering on reports of Clinton's decisive margins in the JlOns. The simple fact is that the bond market is a slave to interest rates and inflation. The general sentiment on Wall Street is that Clinton will increase deficit spending giving a spark to inflation and interest rates. (Gee, I wonder why? Maybe it's because his plan, as stated, could not possibly provide the spark to the economy tllat he claims it will withOut increasing the deficit which he vows to reduce.) How does a rise in inflation and interest rates translate into bad new:s for the bond market? First let me explain how a bond works. When a bond is purcbased, the investor has essentially lent money to whoeverb.e purchased the bond Concordiensis and get a Grasp on the Campus from. Bonds have a stated tenn to maturity. At maturity, the bondholder must be paid the face value of the bond. The face value is usually in thousand dollar increments. Bonds are not always bought at face value because of another important characteristic called the coupon rate. The coupon rate is a peFcentage of face value that will be paid yearly to the bondholder as interest. For example, since the market interest rates are now at about 7.65% for 30-year instruments, a bond with a face value of $1,000 and a 1()% coupon rate would be worth $1,162.19. The premium in price is due to the fact that the bond is paying more in interest than one could receive elsewhere in the market. Therefore, investors are willing t() pay more than face value for the bond. This inverse relationship between interest rates a11d bond prices is the reason that bondholders fear a rise in interest rates·. The other factor at work is that of inflation. If you owe money, the best thing that could happen is a rise in inflation beca11se the payments that you make, although the amounts are the same, are worth less thaD. they were when you took out your loan. While inflation is good for the issuers of bonds, bondholders can be severely hurt. These fears are btJrdens on the bond market now and will not be alleviated until Clinton has been in office for several months and investors have had a chance to assess the implications of his policies. Personally, I do not tbink interest rates will rise significantly. Yes, Clinton's policies might put some upward pressure on interest rates and inflation, but with the economy recovering so slowly it will be difficult for prices to rise. Another influence that will help keep interest rates low is the irnpact of Ross Perot's presidential candidacy. Perot has made everyone keenly aware that rising interest rates can have a very detrimental effect on the budget deficit. That paranoia would put any president, including Bill Clinton, under tremendous political pressure to keep interest rates low.

• SCIENCE and HEALTH November 5, lm Page 8 Anorexia and Bulemia A Look into Co~mmon Eating Disorders Courtesy of Americun College Health Services Our society's image of \'perfection\ is made evident to aU of us on a daily basis, especially when it comes to appearances. Advertising, movies, and all other media colltinuously dictaty to us how it is we should look- especially when it comes to our bodies. As a result, most Americans believe that th,inner is better. 1'his image, however, can result in people becoming so obsessed with their bodies that their weight and. dieting S\lccess become the measure of their self esteem, and they consequently develop an eating disorder. Thinking that eating is the cause and result of many of their problems, they become trapped in· a vicious cycle of repeated, ritualistic, and rigid behavior focused on food. The most common eating disorders include anorexia nervosa (self-starvation) and bulimia (bingeing and pllrging). Some experts also consider compulsive overeating an eating disorder. Anorexics are often thin to the point of emaciation, but are afraid to gain weight. They may have symptoms caused by severe weight loss: dry skin and !lair, cold hands and feet, general· weakness, constipation an<! digestive problems, inso-imi1a, · and amenorrhea :(loss of menstrual periocls). As the weight loss proJlresses, more severe problems may develop such as h1creased susceptibility to infections, st~ess fractures~ ketosis (severe chemical1 i~nbalances), and weaknesses <>f the heart muscle that can le:ad to death. Bulimics mBy be of average or slightly above average weight:, usually do most of their bin,geing and purging secretly, and have rapid weight gain;S ;and losses. They purge tllmugh self- induced vomitiqg, abusing laxatives and diuretics, fasting, or ovef exercising, and are subjec•t tc medical problems cause4 by their purging methodS: as well as their eating habits. Medical problems include (Onstipation and digestive disorders, dehydration, se\o'ere dental problems, a11d muscle weakness. As bulimia progresses, ulcc:rs and life- threatening heart . irregularities may develop. Many anore::xics may periodically binge and purge like bulimics. They suffer from a com1Ji11ation of anorexic an~ bulimic symptoms. Compulsive ov-ereaters are Health care reform: ,oo we need it?

If tlley become severely obese, t~eir problems can progress to osteoarthritis and life-tb:reatening disorders such as lleart and gall bladder disease~ and diabetes. People with eating disorders spend a lot of time thinking about eating, food, weigllt, and body image- they count md recount the calories in tlleir meals, weigh themselves many times a day, and ]Jlace themselves on severely restricted diets, regardless of their weight. Th~y <>]ten \feel fat\ when their weight is normal or abnonnally low, or feel uncomfortable after consuming a normal sized or small meaL Generally, they characterize foods as \good\ or ''bad,\ and make judgne.11ts about themselves based on how well they control what they eat. Believing that others are also judging them based on their co11tr~l of food, they frequently feel anxious eating whe11 )le<>ple are around. Cult111al and psychological issues, Jlersonality traits, and learn~<! behavior all cuntribute to eating disorders. In addition, some people may have biochemical imbalances that make them prone to these disorders. Again, .American culture encourages people to base self worth on body and shape. At the same time, food is often used as a somce of love and comfort, 311d eating is an important part of social events. The resulting confusion can lead to conflict about wily atld when to eat. Alth,oug.h men are increasingly susceptible to this confusion, women are especially vulnerable because traditionally a woman's physical appearance is viewed as very important in attracting a partller. People with eati,ng disorders are often subject to depression, a:nxiety, and low self-esteem. They generally are perfectionists who feel inadequ~te, ashamed and guilty when they don't measure up to their own standards- standards that are often unrealistic and based on rigid black/wllite, either/or thinking. An eating disorder is also a coping · skill used to rechannel, avoid, or forget emotions- anger, sadness, anxiety, or even joy- that feel · threatening. This behavior ·- -----~-------·-------- may be learned from family or peers. Often, a parent of someone wit h. an eating disorder abuses food, alcohol, or other dltrgs .. A few people can step their ·eating disorder by themselves and never have rel~pses. But, · because ~many factors contribute to these disorders, mqst people need help. The most successful treatments usually combine several forms of therapy, possibly including: behavior modification; individual, group, and family psychother~py; and participation in self-help groups: Hospitalization may be necessary for people whose syrn:p,toms are particularly severe, and drug therapy may oo useful for any underlying long-term depression and anxiety. In addition, many people with eating disordei>& benefit from education a:bo11t their basic nutritional needs in conjunction with other forms of help.

··November 5, 1992 Pag_e 9 SCIENCE and HEALTH NICOTINE: DRUG OF CHOICE, OR DRUG OF DEATI-1? by :Bruno Benzaquin Contributing Writer Nexuo coffee, tobacco is the most widely used drug in the world. The total global consumption of tobacco per year amounts to 10 million pounds, which in turn is converted to 3 tril'lion cigarettes. Although smoking is on the decrease, it is still the predominant preventable cause of death in the world. lronically, it is estimated that the health costs associated with smoking amounts slightly less what is collected from its taxation. Tobacco was the gift of the New World to European civilization in 1492. In exchange, this civilization gave the New World, syphilis, measles and small pox!! The term tobacco originates from the fact that the first samples sent to Europe came from the small island of Tobago. Nicotine, the active ingredient in tobacco, is named after Jean Nicot, the man who introduced it to France. For most of its initial history tobacco was smoked in pipes. However, in the 18th century it was introduced as snuff, originally a medicinal drug which was attributed to cure many diseases. At the time of the American Revolution, snuff was associated with British aristocracy. and as a fonn of protest people took to chewing tobacco. As late as 1950, up to half of the tobacco used in the U.S. was chewed. Cigarettes originated in Spain, but their usf'. did not become popular until the Crimean war. TwCJ factors are responsible for the widespread use of cigarettes and thus to its detrimental health effects. Cigarettes became machine made and thu~ cheap and highly ava:dable. In addition, a new curing process gave tobacco a milder taste, th:is allowed smokers to inbale, thus bringing smoke directly into ·the lungs. . Although there are over 1300 different chemicals in the smoke of cigarettes, it is quite clear that nicotine is the compound associated with the short term health effects of cigarettes. Nicotine has a powerful effect on the central nervous !;ystem. At pure dosages of 60 mg it will cause death by suffocation. Nicotine tends indeed to paralyze ~ the musCles associated with respiration, because it bl()cks the cholirgenic system that normally activates these muscles. At lower doses Nicotine still has CQ;nsiderable ill-effects on the respiratory and the cardiovascular systems. Nicotine tends to increase the systemic blood pressure because it stimulates the release of epinephrine (adrenaline) which in turn results in an increase in heart rate and blood pressure. It is interesting to note that at low levels of nicotine tile smoker feels stimulated while at high levels the smoker achieves a total state of relaxation. Thus by altering the amount inhaled one can achieve the desrredlevelofarousru. It is estimated th;at at least half a million deaths occur directly because ·Of smoking. The greatest risk associated with heart disease, it pmmotes the release of adrenaline and the presence of carbon monoxide is also detrimental because CO binds to hemoglobin, decreases the amount of oxygen present in the body and makes the heart work harder. In addition. cigarettes contain a large number of carcinogenic compounds such as nitrosatnines. This explains why, 30% of all cancer deaths are associated with the use of cigarettes. There is also st:rong evidence that smoking affects the development of a fetus. Babies born to smokers usually display a lower weight at birth and during the firSt year of life. Nicotine can also be transferred through a molher's milk. Other health effects associated with smoking include: 1) Chronic bronchitis and emphysema, 2) gastrointestinal ulcers, 3) reduced levels of vitamin C and 4) increased wrinkling of the face. The best answer to the health problems associated with smoking is to break the habit. Since 1964, 30 million people have managed to give up the habit in North America (let's not hope that they managed to do that by dying!)

After wrestling witb fact and fiction, deliberating over the choices to be made,. and becoming desperate and frustrated, the people have decided to vote the incumbent president, George Bush, out of office. They have replaced him with the young, southern democrat~ Bill Clinton, who has never stopped touting \Change\ as his primary goal as president. Now, the American people must decide what this change will actually do to, or for, the country. First. take into consideration that the United States is fairing the international recession quite well \YLhen compared to all of the other industrialized countries. It is even doing favorably in regards to the Japanese economy. Our country is experiencing the smallest unemployment rate in the past few years, and GDP has claimed an impressive gain within the last quarter. Also, if the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is ratified, then the largest free-trade bloc in the world would be created, resulting in impressive growth rates for all countries involved. However, these facts do not prescribe a positive public opinion of the economy. In fact, many people claim that the U.S. economy is still headed downhill. One must understand that there are always huge problems confronting a country with such monetary and military power as ours. With only one twentieth of the world's population, America has the largest economy in the world. She also controls the largest military. making her the unchallenged leader of international politics. Clinton's buzzword \Change\ is inevitable no matter who takes office. The qualification voters should have considered most heavily is: who has the power to effectively lead big business into its nex.t phase of evolution? This should have been the voter's primary decision, as it is business that leads most other aspects of the economy into the future. However, we have made our decision, now we must live with the consequences, be they good or bad.

Just when you thought all hope was lost. .. This week's topic borders on the serious, I don't know how many 'Bathroom Wdls in Academic Halls' articles one can read. But, I'll do wbat I can to be sure you <lo not get hopelessly bored ami restless halfway through. I know that c oncordiensi s articles are always intriguing, so I will try to keep in line with your expectations. This past week, I re~eived some distressi~g advice from a woman whom I very much admire. I was tellin~ this person about an article I had read by a radical feminist philosopher named Joyce Trebilcot. I grant that Trebilcot is a bit extreme, even for my taste (she is what we 'in the know' call a separatist), but I thought she h:ad some interesting things to say. She questions why we women should have to follow rules we had no part in making. How can we ever consider ourselves equals and get rid of the 'victim comple:x ~ if we are forever rule foll()wers and never rule makers? For example, she points out that the way in which peoJlle do philosophy is the Euro-centric, male dominated method, 'hard' philosophy. If women do not pursue academics in this 'hard' sort of way, them they h:ave no hope of survival. Why is this the right way to do philosophy, or pursue any other scholarly or social endeavor? Well, because the rule makers, namely, men, said so. In my ideal world this would not be the way things worked. . I would do philosophy the way · I wanted to do it, and get away with it. But, I have no chance · of realizing my ideal world in my lifetime; and yes. that's too damn bad for me. r know what you're thinking; ·~oh., cry tne? riv.!r Mirriam. Just deal.\ But. l don't know if anyone at this stage in life could or would accept 'because I said so' as a legitimate reason to do or not to do anything. I know that it never worked when my parents used it; although, for some strange reason, they still try. (But parent logic is beyond me.) Maybe the big bad male dominated world thinks it can win me over by regulating my thought processes. This is still not really my problem. My problem is the advice I received from this person whom I respect. She told me she felt uncomfortable with people who do not wish to do things the way they are supposed to be done. I was told to tolerate, deal with, and suck up to the system; if I wanted the rewards distributed by men, I had to play by their rules. Most disturbing was that 1 was told that not wanting to play by the rules meant that I was taking the easy way out, doing 'soft' philosophy. I did not want to do tough reading and library research, but, rather, wanted to write stories, read easy material, and would not be doing 'real' philosophy. So, I am angry and frustrated that this is the way the real world works. Women can not encourage other women's creative endeavors if it means radical change, essentially, rule breaking. I understand this advice and do accept the truth of it, for the moment. There are, indeed, some rules that are necessary to ifisure the smooth running of a great democracy such as ours; these rules are gender, class, sexual preference, and race blind. For example, I must use a number two pencil when I take a standardized test, this is a rule. Regardless of the bias inherent in the tests, this number two pencil rule does not discriminate. I must not drink soda in the studio of WRUC; if I do, I will get in BIG trouble. Maybe if the people who run the station were my best friends, I wouldn't have to worry. But, they're not, and they don't care who you are. I must also, to quote George Bush, \never ever, ever, ever'' (intellectual joke) give the people at the Skellar -- my beloved home away from home ·- the wrong slip at the wrong time. I have done this before, and it really causes a stir. But, then there are these other rules, the rules that break me and subordinate my visions of myself as a strong, independent, thinking woman to those of popular male culture. Camille Paglia was on 60 Minutes the other night. She scared me. I acknowledge and agree with her that .a woman must have the right to choose. No, not pro-choice in the sense in which we are all so accustomed, but a different kind of freedom .. of choice for women. She argues that women should be allowed the choice of career or homemaker and not made to feel bad or' guilty about choosi11g either one. This is true, but first we must have a real, legitimate choice. What choice do I have now? I can be inv<>lved in academia, and play by male rules; or, I can stay home and take care of children and live up to the accepted rnale created female stereotypes. This is not cboice. It's like Henry Ford who said (and rm not sure if he put it in ex.actl y these words) \Sure. you can have that car in any color you like, as long as its black.\ Well, I can do ailything I want, as long as it's okay with the people who made the rules. I know the woman who inspired this article could not say to me, \go ahead, screw the system,\ with a clear· conscience and think she was giving me sound advice for my future. This is what upsets me; this is what angers rne. She could not tell me to Jlursue that path that I felt was right for me because it would not get me very far. How can I change this? If anyone has .any ideas, olease let me know. tl 'VI c c tl ( \ s a v p { - f \ r t s s C< pl Sl ki a' w I S< 01 ft: tt S( tt c• rt tc e: e: 0 C1

CHET'S Where To Put The Pub .?' t? •••• Concordiensis Blasted To the Editor: Last week, when I went to the town meeting, Rita Staph, who is in charge of running Chets, spoke on behalf of Chets. She talked about ilow the .students and management could make Chets a better place. That is to say, how we could make it just like any other bar we would go to. Mrs. Staph said that the function of Chets is to create, or at :least help create, responsible drinkers out of us (the presupposition being that Union students are not responsible drinkers, which may or may not be true) and at the same time have a great time. Now, of course, these two goals are compatible, but when is the last time any lull: tried to assert these two goals simultaneously? I always thQught a bar was supposed to be outside the realm of educating its patrons. Mrs. Staph also construes Chets to be a \'business;\ a business that needs time to grow, she says, Personally, I think this is a delusion (or an illusion) on Mrs. Staph's part. Cbets doesn't need time to grow, its conceptual framework needs to change. A couple of weeks ago, Chets had a party called the \Wild Thing.\ It was supposed to be a huge ordeal and Union had the potential to win some kind of nat~onal prize. When I went down to ·Chets very few people were even there. I don't know what excuses were given for this on the part of Chets • management. Perhaps some thought the lack of students. was due to a lack of advertisement. Maybe others blamed it on other parties on campus. The truth is, at least in my opinion, going to a party ·Called the \Wild Thing\ just does not sound appealing. In fact it sounds down righ·t ·\cheesy.\ This is not the way to lure students into Chets! 'This brings me to my next point: \How to lure students into Chets.\ When I went to England on a term abroad last year, they had these .things called \public h<>uses\ or Pubs. These bars have just an incredible atmosphere for socializing, drinking, etc. I liked being there and I wanted to be there. Unfortunately, the same does not apply for me (as well as many others) to Chets. I know this has been said many times before, but it is true, Chets simply does not have the characteristics of a bar. There is, however, a place on the college grounds that is just like a Pub and it is called the Rathskellar. Now I realize that I am being up.cooperative for Mrs. Staph who said we should ··work with what we have,\ but here me out. · I sincerely believe that people would go to the Skellar to drink and socialize, there is no doubt in my mind. The question is \why then, don't we move Union Town Meeting: A To the Editor: Having just returned from my first Union town meeting I wanted to make several points regarding the topic of the day. First, I was really prolld of the spirit and concern that students, faculty, and administrators brought to the issue of \campus culture\: the mi:x of academics and social life. These people --their good ideas and good intentions-- will make a positive difference. Second, to paraphrase two student speakers, I wish more members of the Union community had attended. I've yet to meet a student or pmfessor who did not hold strong views on the subject of campus culture and, following frorn my point above, progress will be marked all the more successfully and quickly when we work together. Finally, to put the issue in context but not let Union off the book. colleges and universities across the nation are struggling with issues related to academic Chets to the Rathskellar?\ Well, at the town meeting we were offered two specific answers, both given by Mrs. Staph. The first was that the last time Mrs. Staph was in charge of a .party at the Skellar, she was \scared\ that it was getting out of control. The only thing I can infer from this is that she thinks all future gatherings in the Skellar will result in some uncontroable frenzy. This is one reason for not having Chets in the Skellar, according to Mrs. Staph. My query, then, is why don't we find someone or some people who will not be \scared\ and will be able to handle the job? The other reason offered was that the Skellar floods when it rains and, therefore, unsafe. Why is it so hard for some people to realize that if you are worried about Chets flooding when it rains you simply do not OPEN CHETS THAT NIGHT! Personally, I think there are other, more covert, reasons for not moving Chets which I will not try to profess. For some reason I think this letter was written in vain. Unfortunately, I imagine Chets staying right where it is (as well as staying sterile). But, if Mrs. Staph thinks Chets just needs \time to grow,\ I sympathetically hope she, as well as the adminstration, have a lot of time on their hands. Respe<rtfully submitted Eric D. Handelman '93 Beginning performance and student lifestyle. In my opinion this painful-but-necessary dialog is more a reflection of an era we are living than a set of challenges unique to Union. Let's not miss the opportunity to· make a real, positive difference here though. Jt can be fun, too. Sincerely, Dan Lundqu,st - To the Editor: Dear Sir: Upon receiving my copy of the Concordiensis this· week I was g.ri pped with outrage. First, I want to address the \Securtiy Problems From a Personal Standpoint\ piece. Obviously. the author truly bas a \Securtiy\ problem; his qualm had nothing to do with security as we know it. To begin, the wri.ter's whiny article states \The Lamont House pruking lot has been the scene of quite a few crimes.,; If this person knew this, than why did he risk his precious car stereo and radar detector to the scum that prey on such ignorance? My advice: A. Buy a stereo that is removable. B. Take radar detector out of car. C. Leave car back in Connecticut. Furthermore, the \big bucks\ - \I'm (reaUy my parents) are spending -$-$-$ (fill in the amount) to come to Union\ argument falls into l.he category of the banal. Regardless of the staggering sum that is extorted from our coffers annually, there is no place on earth where one can pragmatically say that \ ... We should have some sort of guarantee for the safety of our personal items\. Union is not an insurance agency; it is a learning institution. An automobile is a privilege not an inalienable right. Next, I wish to turn to Erin O'Neil and Doug Bartell's \Kinky Candid Concordi Quips\. To begin with we must look to the track record of this silly column. All term Ms. O'Neil's creative flashes have been nothing but psycho-babble and sadly this week was no exception. Frankly, this article was nothing more than a flirtation between the above Write for Concordiensis persons recorded for our reading pleasure. While it must have been fantastic for the participants, I am not interested in this string of slang filled sweet nothings. In the column it is revealed that \Vibrators take four double D's\. Clearly the autho~r must have been riding it at the time of this draft because that is the only rational explanation for this waste of newsprint. Ms. O'Neil, you have been given an opportunity to create something of substance for the paper, yet you continually come up with drivel. Instead of publishing the blow by blow of your latest hook up for the next week, please rise to the occasion and write something cohesive. It would be a welcome change to an audience weary of lackluster idiocy. Last, I wish to voice an opinion about Mr. Bartell's poetry: Stop printing it. This is a newspaper, not a creative journal; Mr. Bartell must find another outlet for his passion, namely a creative writing class. Thi.s would give him time to polish his pieces and weed out the garbage. Currently, we, the Teaders arc forced into this position, and we arc exhausted. It saddens me to sec the level of mediocrity that the C oncordiensis routinely lets into print. Rather than. \playing newspaper\ do it right. You have a big budget and a good talent pool: Please tap into it and get this paper on the road to respectability.

FEATURES • November 5, 1992 Page 12 Weekend In Rio D.ass Seaman Features Editor Bra2i/ Term Abroad A year .ago, I don't think I ever could have imagined that I. Dass Seaman, would be in Rio de Ja11eiro. Neither could Claudia. Sam. Christa or Nadine, my faithful traveling companions ... but there we were, sitting on an overnight bus, waking up[ to a beautiful pink and p-urple sunrise in Rio. We weFe immediately taken as foreigners. an observation proven when a taxi kindly offered to take us to our hotel. When we arrived at our hotel, he said we owed him extra money for the baggage. Baggage?! He definitely took us as suckers and foreigners. Our little hotel, the Ipanema Inn was located not even a block away from those famous beaches, and nothing could deter our thoughts from being there. We duded ourselves up in our American bikinis and loaded up on sunblock, on our, shall we say, sunde:prived bodies. (You see we are actually living in Sao Paulo which so far has been cold and rainy 99% of the time. The only color you can get there is from the brown layer of pollution.) Only a few short hours after arriving in Rio, we were at the beach. The scenery was breathtaking, but not half as exciting as seeing every woman wearing butt-floss (\fio dental\ in Potugese). Welcome to the wonderful world of the wedgie woman. Inspired by this \new\ fashion , we all went :to buy our own Rio bildnis at lpanema's \Bum B11m bikini boutique.\ I'm sorry to say that we didn't go balls-Indy and buy butt floss. We settled for \Asa Deltas\ the 3/4 ass- suit. As I looked in the mirror and looked at my Asa ~elta, I couldn't help but think of Mel Brooks in Space Balls: \Nobody told me my ass was that big! II Rest assured. I was told that fat or skinny, everyone wore bikinis in Rio- no matter what they looked like. Back on the beacll tanning (oh! color me golden) in my new (almost to the nakedness of birthday) s·uit., I was exposing parts of my body that have never seen the sunlight. There was a· line of four sunny- side up white butts in a row (That was us!). A Kodak moment indeed! We were greasy Union godde!!ses with pools of sweat accumulating in our belly buttons. God. we were hot I mean it was hot. I don't know what it is about beaches, but I kept on getHng sand all over my oody. No matter how hard I tried to stay on my 2x2 towel. sand would wind up somewhere - like my foreltead. Then it would stick to the suntan lotion. Ikky- sandy-sandy- sticky. A Dass pet peeve. Not to mention that everyone who walked by intentionally kicked up a little sand on me, snickered and said \Bunda branca Americana!\ (American white butt). The next day we were at the A NOTE FROM UNION IN CHINA Ni hao from China!' Don't wony, no top ten list on why China is better than Union. Although from the news we've been getting about the new social policies it sounds like we're making out better here with no drinking age an <I smooth beer. However~ we do miss some things: clean bathrooms with toilets and food without rocks and hair being two of the most obvious. The food has definitely been different. From the turtle that was served at the first banquet to the appetizing rice watered soup that is served every breakfast there has been no lack of interesting things to consume. We are all very impressed with our group for being willing to try new and unusual things. Usually Myong and Kevin are willing to try · anything first. Jen and Celio just save their appetite for Sunday mornings Western breakfast buffet at the Jinling Hotel, on which occasion they easily out-eat the guys. Sandy,. who is th.e only vegetarian in our grO\Jp, is happy as long as she can get her \green stuff.\ The group has been frequently adventuring around China. Our trip to the Yellow Mountain gave us an eight hour workout on the poor- mao's stairmaster. However, we reaped the rewards of our workout when we got the chance to see the spectacular sunrise from the top of the mountain. The Great Wall was a stroll in the park after the Yellow Mountain climb. Walking around the Forbidden City gave some of those in t.he group greater insight into tlte history ·and culture of Chin~. Some members of the group, however, thoughtthatit should have been called \The Boring City.\ After all the touring, we have come to think of Nanjing as our home in China, the place where we park our bikes (that is, those of us who still have bikes). Chinese class has been fun for the six of us who have never studied it before. Teachers who go through lessons at warp speed without speaking any English make it quite interesting. Aside from language class, we ail take an elective of our choice. For example: Barry is painfully mastering the art of numb- chucks, Don and Nayana are trying to find volu11teers for their new found skills of acupuncture, Toby md James beach again. Sam. Claudia and I were just beginning to doze off when something went terribly amiss. I felt a thumping on the sand, I heard screaming hoards of people (the enW:e beach) began picking up · their things and runnir.,g. Pa11ic! Mass hysteria! Everyone was dearing the beach fast. Little .girls crying, mothers running, men taking off without their wives and children. It was a scene straig;htout of \Jaws\. We didn't know what was going on nor did we know how to ask people what was going on. 'Claudia attempted o ask a girl and partially understood her answer. Something about \gun\ and \gunshot II. All I coul<l imagine was my parents watching ·the evening news. \A man opened fire today in Rio mortally wounding three large .. ended American college students.\ · We had been warned that Rio was dangerous, but that was (to put it politely), quite a cultural experience. Instilled with fear, paranoia ran through my veins as I walked around the streets of Rio. especially when I was carry-ing something valuable- like a camera. I hated looking like a tourist,(i.e. an easy victim), but when I wanted to take pictures, carrying a camera says \'Hey! Take it! Its free!\ I resorted to wearing my camera around my neck, and let it dangle under . my shirt. Pe()ple thought I was some exb.ibitionistic masturbator whell I kept reaching my hand down my shirt .

If .someone looked at ' me funny, I'd say in a Swartzeneger voice: \No it's not a tumor, it's a camera, Ya.\ We were never hasted in Rio, (thank God), but Christa and Nadine did see some guy get pul:led off of the street and pushed into a car. Two other men proceeded to beat the man into hamburger meat. That was it. Our trip to Rio wasn't only limited to daytime excitement. We made the effort to explore some of the night life. There was a great bar located a block away and we spent adequate time absorbing the culture and consuming some \cervejas.\ We became amused with the concept that no one in the bar spoke English. Obscene words flew from our mouths as we giggled, thinking that we could actually say such things in public. We abruptly silenced when the guy next to us asked \Where are you from?\ in perfect English. Many Brazilian men fell to the feet of these Union beauties that night. \Marry me\ \Just one kiss\ \I love you\ were common phrases of- admonishment. Turning them down we settled for a less vocally threatening crowd of young men. Young indeed! They turned out to be sixteen. Robbing the Brazilian cradle-of those baby boys! We hung out with them after the bar at the beach and Random Quotes from members of our group: Nayana Anne: \Oh ... My ... God!

Features obviously hasn't fulfilled the expectations and demands· of a few individuals and therefore they want me to make it different \There shouldn't be creative writing in a newspaper! Newspapers are for news!\ Well I have some news for my critics- features is here to stay. More than that, it is here to stay as is. I started writing for features last spring and when Dass Seaman went away on term abroad I was elevated to the lofty position ·Of Features Editor. It was at that point that I realized that I had no clue Get as to what a feature exactly was. Is it supposed to be funny, (;Ute, informative, or creative! Do 1 address topics satirically, traditionaHy, or from a unique point of view? What does the reader expect when reading a features article? What do I expect when reading a features. article? I rea1ly wasn't sure about any of this until this past weekend when I attended a national conferenc.e of college newspapers. More than 500 colleges and universities attended, some bringing witfi them examples of their publications. I piCked up a few of these and immediately turned to their features pages. I was expecting to find things similar to what we have here in our Concordiensis features sections. How wrong I was. There were articles about chess and homecoming and Joe Blow who survived tragedy to become successful. There were stories about various faculty members as well as other human interest stuff. That was it. \Look at your section Doug, can't you see that it's different\ was the ensuing statement from the powers that be. I looked and indeed I did see that our features section was very much different than the features sections of other ·schools. For instance: The Moraine Valley Glacier has \The Student Trustee Spotlight\ while we have Cara Soifer and Andrea Heffner relating experiences on campus and talking about projects like We Care About U Schenectady. The Evangel College Spotlight has a concert review in it's features section. We have Erin M. O'Neil's sassy quips. The University of Wisconsin~s Stoutonia has in it's features section a gripping article about daylight savings time. Ours merely contains Uncle Edna. The Western Kentucky Herald has a stirring article about a student who put his tuition on a credit card and had to (gasp!) pay interest. All I could find in the Concordiensis Stratton has a lower price for anyone pursuing a higher education. $24 midweek. $29 weekends. $34 holidays. So you can save $10 every day but holidays (when you'll still save $5), and you'll also get up to 92 exciting trails, a 12-passenger gondola, plus _all the extracur!'icular fun you can handle.

But I ask you, loyal readers, does that mean it is worse? Does that mean that we here at Concordiensis features shoul<l be asked to conform simply because we have overstepped the traditional bounds of features writing? True, we are different from the Herald's feature section or from the Stoutonia's but I suggest that by being different we are better. We are a better section because we have not let ourselves be constrained by normal topics and points of view. We are better than other featUI'es sections because we give Union College a chance to take a break from the bleak realities of the surrounding sections. The reality of being different has allowed me the chance to better evaluate my position, and finally, after 10 weeks as Features Editor, I realize what . the Concordiensis Eeatures section is. Features, my friend~. are any articles that would never. ever, be on the front page of The New York Times. As a rule, features :allows the writer to take a normal story in an abnormal dir'ection. Features allows evel)'clay news to become interesti n~ views and flOn-fiction realities to shine. Features provides an outlet fot relating life to the reader: via fiction or humor~ satire or science fiction. poetry or farce. Features is all that is written to be informationally interesting. Laughed at?- maybe. Thought provoking? -maybe. Reflective of society?-maybe. Human interest? -maybe. Interesting?- always. We don't have to cllange our style or our attitucle simply because we aren't like other papers. Maybe other papers should change their- styles because they aren't like us.

As I look back on October 31st, I find that many interesting costumes were worn. So I have taken the great pains to figure out to whom the best costume award should go to. I have tallied up hundreds of votes, opinions, and letters, and with great effort I threw out the lot of them and made the pick myself. I would now like to present THE BEST COSTUME AWARD to ... West Dining!!! Yes, that wonderful freshman, sorry, first- year student, hangout was almost unrecognizable on the night of Halloween, which coincidentally fell on parents weekend. What a surprise to find an ambiance that was somewhat conducive toward sophisticated mastication. Among the nice tablecloths, jack o' lanterns, candy corn, hot cider. cornstalks, costumed workers and extra courteous management, students and parents ate. I almost walked . out of there thinking that I was in the wrong place. As I passed the fried clams and other fried food to get to the silverware, I was greeted by a lady who wished me a good meal. Then I saw the food!! lt was not only filling, and edible, which West is not normally anyway, but it was actually designed to look good! I had some squash/pumpkin thing carved into a star and filled with peas, candied tomatoes, and that hen thing that has been served each day since Halloween. Talk about a scare! I couldn't remember where I was! 'This is West? I mean a worker in a mouse costume was walking amongst the tables and giving refills of coffee! A friend of mine got up to put his tray away, and was told to sit down because someone else would come and take it away for him! · What a clever costume. Imagine, this is the same place that I eat in every day. Of course West got all decked out because it was Halloween, it had nothing to do with all those parents milling around. Yeah right! What is the deal here? I don't mind West getting all prettied up, but it should do this to make it more enjoyable for the students who eat there, not to cover up or disguise what it really is like. I FAST FOOD REVIEW: MCDONALD'S by Tad Lee Concordiensis Staff This week I will review McDonald's. Everyone in the world has probably been to McDonald's; it's even a favorite of Bill Clinton's. However, I have eaten too many meals, and spent too much money there to pass up the opportunity to write about a place which has had so much influence and impact upon my life. Two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun could possibly be the greatest construction of a hamburger the world has ever known. The Big Mac has been around since the early days of Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald's. It can be messy, and thus difficult to eat in the car, but it satisfies like nothing else. The Quarter Pounder with Cheese is another favorite, however the burger's taste can really come through if there is not enough ketchup etc. on it. This can be·bad. That's what makes the Big Mac such a safe, consistent .choice. The McChicken is pretty good, but doesn't compare to BK's, and the Fillet-o-Fish is--well, I've never had one of those. Chicken McNuggets can· be good. Again, their chicken does not compare to BK's, but McNuggets are okay if you're in the mood. The sauces are excellent. especially sweet and sour and mustard and barbecue. It's o~ay to ask for all three. However, there is a science to eating McNuggets which can . help you live longer: First: Take a small bite out of the nugget, and keep the piece in your mouth. Do not chew. Second: Look at the remaining two-thirds in your hand. If it\is red, purple, or any color other than white, throw out the piece in your hand and carefully remove the piece from your mouth, so as not to let it touch your tongue. This is known as a foul McNugget, and is not good. I would say that at least one out of six and two out of nine will be foul nuggets, so keep the above process in the back of your mind when eating them. The fries, as everyone knows are the greatest in the world when they are hot. Although they usually are, if the fries are not hot, ask for a new batch. The employees know the value of hot fries and will almost always give you a new order of them if you ask. Best deals right now are the \#3\ which is a Quarter Pounder with Cheese, Fries and Coke, and the Big Mac Deal, which also includes fries and a Coke for approximately $2.99. Service, cleanliness and clientele are both superior to BK's. McDonald's is also conveniently located near Union Beverage and Kern Cleaners-- eight and a half stars out of ten. normally have relatively few complaints about West. But disguising itself to make H seem like the decor and variety of food is always gFeat is wrong. Getting all revved up for a special occasion is one thing, but sending the parents a misleading picture of bow students eat is another. This epitomizes the college as a whole. Parents weekend was great, there were performances by various clubs, brunches, talks, and functions, but doesn't correctly depict how we students live our college lives. Why not have more of these events on weekends other than those that are \special\. Or better yet, why don't we just invite alumni and parents to come to Union every weekend.

Ma:y be I'm mis:sing something. College is a lot more than academics, as we all know. It is a place to learn about yourself, find yourself, if you will. It ts also a time to meet new people, try new things, and in tum learn from those experiences. I don't think vou learn much about a pcr~on rrom a random hook-up, except ma:ybc the color or their sheets, or the secret place ,\·here the\ haw a birthmark.

I ' \ .. . \-- ELECTIONS FRESHMAN The Student Forum held an election. on Friday~ October 30 for one senior class representative position and three freshman class representatives. Ned Walley was elected Senior Class Secretary. Setb Brown was elected Freshman Class President. lt is the policy of the Election Board that a person must receive 30% of the vote to gain a position. Since only Mr. Brown was able to achieve this and there was such a large split wit:b remaining votes, the Forum wiU hold a runoff. The Election Board selected all candidates who received 23% of the votes to continue on. Beth Decker, Richard Fuerst, Steve Lapinski, Michael Rand, Carol Monte, and Ron Elfenbein are the six candidates that will be in the running on Friday. BETH DECKER I. Beth Decker, am running for Freshman Class Representative on the basis that I know I have what it takes to effectively represent the class of 1996. Amidst student discontent with many of my High School's policies, I was instrumental in forming a group to a.) discuss problems in the school and b.) meet with administration to develop and institute new policies. I feel this experience, along with tbe responsibility and leadership abilities learned through my extensive involvement with school organizations will aid in my efforts to represent our class. This experience is particularly important now, amidst the wave of student discontent that has swept over the Union Campus in reaction to the new Social Policy. We have four more years here at Union and we can not spend them dissatisfied with tile social life. Administration took away a major part of tile social life and an outlet for stress and anxiety here at Union when they banned mid- week fraternity parties. Tbe only way to change this policy is to put pressure on tile Student Affairs Council to review and modify the policy, and if elected this is what I fully intend to do. We need to find a compromise that will satisfy · students needs for a social life and calm administration's worries over alcohol related accidents and academic standing. When I say \we\, I do mean you and I, because I need your suggestions to best represent 011r class. rm easy to approach and will always be willing to listen. If you want a represen1ative that is willing to work hard and take a stand for what we believe in, I feel I sb.ol.lld be your choice. RICHARD FUERST As freshmen representative, stJJdent interests would be my nomber one priority. First, I would like to work with the student body and the administration to improve the current social policy which cwtails certain activities during the week and also to voice other ideas and concerns that you. the student might have to · improve other aspects of campus life. Students here do a commendable job with community service. However, truere could be more in-volvement that could lead to a better feeling of achievement amd a more positive feeling from the surrounding community. Not only would Union be synonymous with ootstanding academics but also with a strong feeling of social commitment to the people of Schenectady. 0111 challenges should be addJessed through a willing and knowledgeable re.presentati ve who will echo t:h e opinions of the freshmen class! Vote RICH FUERST for freshmen representative!! STEVE LAPINSKI My name is Steve Lapinski, · and I'm running.· for the position of Freshman Class Representative. In this poosition, my goal is to improve tlle conditions at Union, both academically and socially. As fresbman, we are all unfamiliar wi!th the way this school works. Therefore, boasting a list of past accomplishments an~ qualifications would be Novembers, 1992 Page 18 CLASS RUNOFF irrelevant. What the Freshman Class needs is a representative who · will effectiV'ely communicate with his or her peers, the administration, and the Student Forum. I believe it is ill).por.tant to voice the opinions, ideas, and complaints of the Freshman Class, as well as to keep them informed about what is happening in Student Forum. It is essential that each member of the class has a say in regards to the issues that will greatly affect them throughout their years at Union. By being an active and vocal representative I wiU make this possible. On Friday, Vote Sl'EVE LAPINSKI for Freshman Class Representative. MICHAEL RAND As freshmen we are the new, young students on campus who probably have a lot of great ideas but very little influence and power to follow through witb those ideas. It is necessary for our class to be as cohesive as possible so that the little power we have can be heard throughout school. Not only do we need a representative who is outgoing and· responsive to the wants and desires of our class, but we also need someone who is willing to speak up in student government meetings and be our voice. Since coming to Union I have heard from the upper classmen how the social life has become so much worse in comparison to how it use to be. I took offense when I saw the . T-shirt, \I went to Union before it sucked, transfer while you can.\ It would be very hard to reverse the rules, but I can assure you that I will work my hardest to assure you that no new rules are added restricting our social lives. I also think that it would be very useful if the entire class was aware of went on in the student government meetings. I plan on tssumg news letters updating the freshman class of all the issues covered that concern them. This way no one is left in the dark. All in all, the real issue right now is who will do the best job representing us. I feel that I can do that. Thank you, CAROL MONTE My ~n~e is C~ol M~nte and I'm running for Freshman Representative. I feel that students should have more of a say and be more involved in administralive p<:t'licies. Students should know about changes that the administration .makes before they are implemented. Some of the policies which I think are importanrinclude the grading system. social policies and student ac1ivities. I have had three years of experience representing my class in high school, and I served as President of the Student Council for one year. I will make sure that every member of our class can easily contact me whenever he or she has any ideas or suggestions. I am a very determined and enthusiastic person and I feel that I would do the best job in representing our class. the Class of 1996! RON ELFENBEIN FRESHMEN FEWER THAN 200 VOTED LAST WEEK VOTE ON FRIDAY My name is Ron Elfenbein and I am from Rye Brook, New York. I am .seeking election to the position of Freshman Representative. I have served as Presidemt of my high school class for two years in a row and Secretary for one year. During that time my class managed to raise the most money in recent histt<>ry. We also planned and ran a trip to Boston, a prom, a carnival, and graduation. I feel that I can make a positive impact on our school environment, by listening to you and bringing your ideas to realization. I feel that I posses the necessary qualities to be a good leader: honesty, integrity, steadfastness, and experience. If elected, I will listen to all suggestions brought forward by anyone, and do what I can for them. For example~ I have witnessed an overwhelming dissatisfaction with the current social policy changes. Similarly, I have seen a tremendous disconte:ntment witll the food served in the freshman dinning hall, .as well as with the plastic ami paper utensils used periodically. The utensils should all be reusable~ including those used at Dutch Hollow. This school is in need of a more active recycling program, as the one we currently have is most ineffective. We need more recycling bins throughout campus and the buildings, including living areas. There should be at least one bin on each floor of the dormitories, in order to encourage recycling. As a representative, I will do all I can to make the necessary adjustments in order to please the most people. I will also do my best to make our school CAMPUS SAFETY 1.

In addition, the Steelers have beaten Houston t'Wiice so if the two teams ended the season with identic a 1 records Pittsburgh would win th~ division. Incredibly enough, the San Diego Chargers are the AF~'s hottest team, winning 4 str~1g?t games after losing thetr frrst 4.

Now on to the conference which still knows how to play the game like the great teams of the past: the NFC. The Dallas Cowboys, at 7-1 are the team to beat and you can not say enough .good things about the whole organization. Owner Jerry Jones and coach Jimmy Johnson have taken the Cowboys from a 1-15 team three years ago, to the best in the NFL. Since 1990, the Cowboys have made 32 trades, most in the NFL. They have drafted well, dealed well, and now have a team with an average age of 25 years. Only two players remain from the Tom Landry era. Dallas defeated their main rivals, the Philadelphia Eagles this Sunday for their 11th straight home victory in Texas Stadium, the Dome with a huge, square hole in the roof so God can look down on his favorite football team. The d~f~nse has been fabulous only gtvmg up 189 yards to the Eagles. Troy Aikman has been excellent, hitting receivers Michael Irvin, Kelvin Martin and tight end Jay Novacek with great accuracy. Running back Emmitt Smith has dominated opposing defenses and leads the league in rushing yards after picking his way through the fiersome Eagle defense for 163 on Sunday. The Eagles had not given up Kansas City was beaten 20-3 at home by the Steelers last we~k and Denverr bas proved then lack of corn(letency with 30-0 and 34-3 losses to Philadelphia and Washington 100 yards to a runner in 54 respectively.

I had barely lffiade it to the starting line willefl the race started. The pace: was furious from the start with Will Rawstron and Chris Bangs leading the way. I decided to suck wheel behind my main man Greg (Wetrn()re) and save energy until my hast lap surge. I looked around and found myself towards tile back trying to figure out whtO were these guys up front. The mudhole forced us into single file with Rawstron and Bamgs powering right through the Logs. Unfortunately, ttlle guys in front of us fell and a gap. developed. We fi11ished the ftrst lap six second~ behind the leaders in 3:64. A quick calculation reve.aled that we were doing the :~ mile course at 18 miles pe.r !lour - on mountain bikes! My lungs and legs were burnimg when Greg decided to bridge tile gap. I tried to follow bll!t couldn't. Anyway, I'd h~td my fill of mud spit out by his back wheel. The second lap saw Rawstron fly thrr()ugh in 6:01 followed by Greg three seconds behind and Tom Duckett on his wheel. Bangs had faded to fourth. By the third lap I had expected the mudhole to be more like soup, but the sun had come to our aid and dried it enough so that we now had a hard packed ribbon of single track. Unfortunately, by now the shake and bake in the logs was starting to foam up traces of beer in my brain. I looked around and found company as we made only half the obstacles before saving face with a secure foot plant. Back at tile front Rawstron continued to expand his lead while Greg and Duckett were getting their first taste of the bonk. These riders, clad in their nice lycra shorts and tights, were passed by an apparition suited in baggy sweat pants and top. Chris Gelston had been ridding a steady pace when he surprised the duo and reeled in second place by the fourth lap. He would go on to stretCh his lead over third and fourth, finally Hampton's 138 rushing yards and Jeff Hostetler's 2 TD passes to raise their record to a respectable 4-4. The Giant defense was excellent and Washington's only points came on an 84-yard punt return by Brian Mitchell for a touchdown. The Giants have won ~n Chicago and in Washington, nearly came back to beat Dallas, and would be a playoff contender except for one thing: they're not in the AFC. The rest of the NFC contenders are the Vikings and Bears who feast on their weaker Central division opponents, and the 49ers and Saints of the West. New Orleans has quietly posted a 6- 2 record to tie for the division lead with the 'niners. San Francisco looked dominant at 6-1 until their unexplainable loss to Phoenix this week 24- 14. The 49ers are certainly a strong team, but do not deserve the same respect as the Cowboys since their wins have been against the likes of the Jets, Rams, Falcons, Giants, Patriots, etc .. The Vikings are a suprising force at 6-2 after impressively beating the Bears on Monday night ... .It will certainly be an exciting home stretch towards the playoffs in both conferences. Dallas looks like the strongest contender from the NFC but by no means do they have an easy ride. Which team will fight its way out of the mediocre AFC? Will it be the Steelers? The Bills? Miami? Houston? Whichever team it is, the NFC representative will be licking i~s chops come S uperbow I time: and for good reason- the AFC rep. may be in for a first class massacre. What other prediction can be made then NFC team over AFC team in a bloodbath. finishing in 16:08. Rawstron was clearly tne strongest rider as he sprinted in with a Lime of 15:20. His average - 18 miles per hour, mud and all. Tom Duckett had a clean run through the mudhole in the last lap to give him the edge for third place in 16: 15. Duckett was also a member of the winning three rider team, Almost Phi Delta Theta, Which included fifth and sixth place finishers Chris Bangs and Kevin Allison. I eventually slowed to my usual 12 miles per hour and finished well back. After the race there was a short awards ceremony and we shared stories of our mishaps and what-ifs. All things considered, the race was lots of fun and very safe thanks to the maqy course marshals. I certainly hope that the Cycling Club holds the race again next year and that they open it up to the general public. That way I can get my cousin J. T. and buddy Ned from Durango to join me in the team competition. SPORTS chach alk by John Schachnovsky 'Concordiensis Staff As my favorite boxing ring announcer Michael Buffer always says ... \Let's get ready to rumble!!\ That's right, this weekend marks the second year of division one ice hockey here at Union College. The rink looks great, the team seems to be coming together, and everything seems to be in place for a great hockey season. Well. .. everything except support. That's right we are apathetic. I know this is the last thing that we all want to here, but it is true. Last year was not the greatest showing in the history of fan support...not even close. I know you all went to a lot of the games. I know you all supported the team as much as humanly possible. Well...that is not eno11gh. I am not saying that I was the San Diego Chicken, but 1 did my fair share of support for the Skating Dutchman. Looking back on last season brings back memories of the opposing teams fans dominating of the Achilles rink airwaves. For example, against Cornell it seemed like we were drubbed out of our own rink ... that is ridiculous. The problem could be lack of knowledge. I personally thought Union had pretty smart sports fans, I could have been wrong. So I will give the Union community some tips on being a fan of Division 1 ice hockey: 1. When tile team comes on the ice, get up and cheer, don't just look around to see who is coming 1n fashionably late ... well if you IVanL to do that at least stand up and clap while you're doing ·it. 2. When the rcf~rces make a bad call, yell at th~m ... that is what they get paid for. 3. When we SC()fe ... It IS a good thing, so be happy and cheer. 4. If fans of the other team start cheering, it is our job as fans to try and cheer louder to protect the lt(]me icc advantage ... so dc)[]'t sit and think how netlt the other teams cheers are. 5. I know how stupid we all feel when we VICar Union apparel to sporting events, but for big time hockc)' it .has been considered accept.able. So if you own it...try and wear it. 6. By all means ~upport the team throughout the season. I know how easy it is to come to the first few. The test is who is here during the homestretch of the season. This was just a small selection of advice on how to be an educated Division I hockey fan. The fact is, our team is doing all itcan to be a Division 1 hockey team, it is our job as fans to l>c Division 1 hockey fans. La&l year was our time as rookies, by now we should be crafty veterans. Former Union Coach Football Dies By Rick Morgan Co-Sper(S Editar Tom Cahill, who spent five years as head coach of the Union College Dutchmen, died this past Thursday of a heart attack. He was 73 years old. In his years at Union, he compiled a record of 12-27-1. Current Union coach John Audino was one of many who was shocked by Cahill's death. \I knew him and talked to him on several occasions \ said Audino. \He was one ~f the nicest people I've met in coaching.\ Audino said he regretted that his cu11ent team did not get to know Cahill. \I was hoping the opportunity came when I could have presented him to the team,\ Audino s£t'd. \lfccl badly becall!~e it never came about.\ Cahill begam coaching back in 1959, and £Ol his first head coaching j()b in 1966 when Paul Dietzel suddenly resigned over <tl South Carolina. Cahill coached the West Point Cadets. in 1966 to an impressive 8-2, inducting an incredible 11-0 shutout over the Nittany Lio11s of Penn State in Joe Paterno's first year there. He received the 1966 Coach of the Y~Car by the American Football Coaches and the Football Writers and Touchdown «:: lub of Washington, D.C. He will be sorely missed by all those that remembered him as a coach, as well as loving husband ami father.

<llnttnlrbirnsis November 5, 1992 Pa 20 The Fall Gettysburg by Dagan La Corte Assoc. Sports Editor For the second week in a row the Dutchmen were victorious as they beat Gettysburg 43-7, before a home crowd of 3.400. Quarterback Scott Newton received his second victory in as many starts. Gettysburg came into the game with a record of S-2, while Union's record was 4-3. During the first quarter neither team was able to get on the 'score board. Late m the first quarter the Dutchmen led a drive which culminated 36 seconds into the second quarter; when Scott Newton connected with senior Jerry Walker on a 4-yard touchdown pass. With 4:08 left in the quarter Gettysburg fumbled the ball on their own 20-yard line. Dutchman Scott Mcintyre recovered the ball, and Union was in excellent scoring position. On first down, Newton threw a pass which was intended for Gene Ray. Both Ray and the Gettysburg defender went up for the ball, but Ray was> able to out leap him and grab the ball before the defender was able to intercept it. The reception gave the Dutchmen a 14-0 lead, which they took into the locker room. After the initial kickoff the offense of Gettysburg was able to march down tbe field, and eventually score a touchdown. The Dutchmen wouldn't let Gettysburg get back into the game. On the ensuing kickoff, Chris Irving returned the ball 4-yards, and on the next play again ran the ball up- the-middle, for a 63-yard touchdown and a 21-7 lead. Unbn's offense refused to have mercy, and on the kickoff · Dutchman Matt Schmitter recovered the ball as a result of an on sides kick. On the resulting possession Dutchman Chad LaBonte ran the ball for 31-yard.s and a 28-7lead. Gettysburg was threatening to score with first down on Union's 19-yard line but they fumbled the ball, and Dutchman Peter Simmons recovered. In the fourth quarter, the Dutchmen added to their sizable lead. Five minutes into First Muckster Mash • lS by Greg Tomac Contrib. Writer Eleven o'clock came awfully early this past Sunday, November 1st. I was jarred awake by a phone call from my cronies over at the Union Cycling Club. A reminder, they said, that the mountain bike race would start in thirty minutes. Now, I don't want you to think that I sleep my life away on weekends; but, you see, I was doing some serious training the night before. I had stayed up until 3:0() am watching tapes of the 1992 Tour de France and interspersing this mental training with a mean game of beer pong. Right about 11:01 am I was having second thoughts about the beer pong. I quickly mounted my mudmobile and was treated to a beautiful sunny day- so much for weather predictions of cold rain. At the starting line I had expected a small mob of thirty to fifty riders ready to do battle. It was surprising that with all the campus advertising {ie. my previous masterpiece) and the great weather only ten riders were waiting at the starting line. There, I was glad to find free warm doughnuts and hot chocolate greeting my unbreakfasted body. Minutes before 11:30, the race director instructed us to take a warm up lap. I felt a bit tight riding along North Lane and Terrace Lane. We turned onto the grassy area between Richmond and the visitor's parking lot heading downhill towards the Seward Place entrance. It was here that, as I crossed the gravel' road, I noticed what once used to be a small rut had been transformed into a wheel swallowing gully. As I laid on my back I promised myself - no more pong games. Mter retrieving my front wheel I continued on the quarter Scott Newton threw - a touchdown pass to Brad Srundage which tied the Union record of 4-touchdown passes in a single game. On the next play, captain David Flynn successfully scored th.e two point conversion which extended Union's lead to 36-7. Gettysburg was threatening to score after receiver N otarfrancesco caught a 41-yard pass; but on the next play Dutchman Kevin Weedmark intercepted ·the ball and ran it back 29-yards. The Dutchmen were unable to score on the following possession; when Gettysburg regained possesion they immediately fumbled the ball, and Dutchman Matt Schmitter recovered it. This gave Union first and goal on the Gettysburg 7-yard line. On third down ·David Flynn ran the ball in for a touchdown and a Dutchmen 43-7lead. The Dutchmen held Gettysburg for the remaining portion of the game, and were able to capture a lapsided victory of 43-7. The victory raised Unions recored to 5-3. The final game of the season comes next Saturday at Rochester Great Fun the reconnaissance mission. The Club had marked off with yellow tape a nice trail along the trees framing the lot. I powered up the short hill next to Fero House and followed the dirt trail behind Jackson's Gardens. Here I met upon a message painted in red -- Welcome to Hell. And there it was. The loop had never been mentioned in any of the ads but it was cle.ar which section had given the race its name. It sent us through tllis black sludge in the maintenance area behind the gardens. In the loop, we had to go between these two dumpsters single file, then bunny hop a bump and squeeze between two trees before ·being treated to a bone jarring gauntlet of logs. After exiting the mudhole we continued on the dirt road towards the Nott Street entrance and turned right onto pavement leading us to the College Center. Ct'ntinued on Pd9 Cowboys Rise Above NFLPack By HalPoret Co-Sports Editor As the first half of the NFL season comes to an end, each division is ·stiH up for grabs. By this potnt last season, Washington and Buffalo were clearly on a collision course for th.e Super Bowl. But who can we project for the title game this year? Parity runs deep through the ranks of the NFL and only the Dallas Cowboys have really shown us the talent and execution of a Superbowl squad. As we look back at the last few weeks, we have mostly seen the fall of potential juggernauts and the surprising rise of those we had already counted out.

Each contestant was judged in four areas: deliverance, creativity, coherence, and substance. Andelman's topic was: \Beware of the man who goes to cocktail parties not to drinl:. but to listen.\ Andelman gave a humorous rendition of a party at Union College and noted that a lot of people at parties try to act like they know everything.

This only serves to create more barriers in allowing women and minorities to contribute all they can to society. As a history professor, he sees the root of the problem in the need to tell an ace urate story of history, and also to understand it. After this. tbe next logical step would be to create policies which serve to break down existing barriers and allow everyone to contribute to society. The United Negro College Fund strives to emphasize the importance of education for African-Americans as they continue to compose an increasingly large part of the work force. Gray's reason for leaving Congress, he said. was to make sure that \the intellectual doorway was opened to allow everyone to get an education.\ His goal today is to open this \doorway\ even further. He is excited by the progress that has already been made. Gray said that the groups which many people consider to be \disadvantaged\ - women and minorities - will make up 85% of the work force by the turn of the century.

NEWS November 12,1992, Page 2 RACISM IS PRESENT Stopping the Spread of Hepatitis B IN AMERICAN EDUCATION by Veronica ;Rogers Associate New.s Editor Racism is alive and well in today's society. There are misconceptions that racism is not as common a _Froblem as it used to be. Howe-ver, it is still evident, and exists as one of the main prolilems our educators are trying to eradicate. . In an effort to combat racism at Union, Warithu-Deen Umar was invited to speak Tuesday Nov. 3rd. Umar is the Ministerial Program Coordinator for the New York State Department of Correctional Service. Umar spoke on Racism ill American. Education, an area,that a lot of people would not consider having much tn do with racism. Umar's point was that racism is there, b11t it is often unintentionally presented. Umar stated tllat it was important for pecple to be open-minded and objective when discussing racism. He said that in order to abolish racism the effort Ius to begin right at · the roots. The dictionary is one of the basics. Umar stated that the definition of racism is racist in it self. The other roots of racism go back in history to the development of America. As this year is the five-hundredth anniversary of Columbus \discovering America\ the debate over the v!flidity o.f Columbus's claim is ia full effect. The speaker wanted to dispel the myths perpet11ated by history books and classes that Columbus discovered America. The struggle over the fact that Columbus did not discover America is being directed toward the ed.uc~ttion of children. Teachers sl!ould no longer praise Columl>us as the discoverer of America; Columbus Day is a complete fallacy. The distortion of tile facts. is always possible considering its documentation in history books. Through media, books, and education the desecration of supposedly \weaker\ races throughout history lias been subconsciously accepted. Umar termed it as 'subliminal seduction.' The educational system in the United States continues on a path of stere()typing particular races. Umar believes that education tod:ty is a corrosive .system; a m~Yority cf blacks are educated with a disadvantage. They go through the system acquiring values that categorize them as a11 inferior race, regardless of whether or not this is the intention of the educators. He says that educatiom is a powerful tool. Whether or not people notice the influence of years of negative conditioning, Human suffering: The least and most A new study ranks 141 countries by a human suffering index. The index includes 10 measures of human welfare related to economics, health and nutrition, education, communications and governing, .Here are the five worst am:ibest countries and their index number. 1 = Least suffering 93 = Most suffering 3canada 21\iether:;=Jiands __ , ! 1 Denmark 2Belgiu r 3Switzerland r891-laiti 89sud~ SOURCE: 189 Afghanistan I 92somalia Population Crisis Committee J.3Mozambique EDITING & \VOUD PROCESSING Dissertations - Theses - Term Papc rs Desktop Publishing Resumes & Curricula Vitae -·Laser Printing-- --Plain l'aper FAX Scrv icc-- --Pcrsoual SccrcLarial Services-- TUTORING Spanish Language & Literature Lalin Lauguagc & Literature Linguistics Close to Union College Fast & Efficient Service 374-8850 WRITE FOR NEWS ' I l it does exist. Umar gave a profound example of an oppressive, yet unnoticed scenario. The projects that house many low income families are n()t only apartments, but they are prisons. They are congested, and uniform in construction. In many cities there are bars on the windows. The speaker stated. that people develop behavioral problems from scenarios such as the one described. The oppressed :become hardened to their lifestyle and they are no longer feaxful of violence and crime. Umar states that they already feel dead, the gociety makes them feel that way. What can be done to fight the continuing racism in American education? Teachers and other ,educators have to 'be aware of .the subtle values ,that they are institling in their very impressionable stu <Ients. Society must realize just because many people say that racism isn't as prominent, it does not mean that it is still in so many aspects of American culture. Right from 1he beginning of the education process, Umar expressed, there needs to be a . change in direction. The subtle and not so subtle racist tendencies that sodety continues to uphold need to be eliminated. -William Gray: continued from page 1 have high grades and a good high school record, than the door of opportunity is probably opened for them already. \My job,\ he stated, \is to take lumps of coal and make them into diamonds.\ This is a very profound thought from a man who realizes the importance of creating a work force for men and women .of all races. College campuses are the focus Cennrtesy of Cramer ~ ickson Basford A 11ationwide program was unveiled to help protect college students from the highly contagi()US hepatitis B virus. The program was presented to college >editors attending the Associ;atted Collegiate :Press (ACP) C()nference in Chicago. The Hepatitis B Campus Prevention Program, sponsored by the National Foundation for Infectious Disease (NFID), includesMTV -style posters and educaticrnal brochures, a tollo free hortbne and participation by Dr. Ruth Westheimer.

Duma, M.D., Ph.d .• executive. director of NIFD. \Since ruepatitis B is prevalent among y01ung adults and one- third of those infected don't even kllow how they contracted the disease, all college students should consider vaccination, because anyone can get hepatitis '}),\ College graduate Wendy Marx fell! into a coma and almost dJed from hepatitis B, just fi v·e months after graduating from D11ke Universiiy. In the case of Marx, and one-third of those infected,. the source of the hepatitis B infection remains unknowa. After two liver transplamt:s and a difficult recovery,. Marx urges young people to get vaccinated against hepatitis E. · \I alm01sl died from. hepatitis B, a disease I'd barely heard of before, alld my life has been permanently changed because of it. I certainly didn't know that there was a vaccine to prevent thjs infection,\ says Marx, now 25 and working in San Fran,cisco. \I hope my experierl(;:e teaches others to protect themselves by learning about this disease and the importance of vaccination.\ Despite efforts by the U.S. Public Health Service to reduce the spread of hepatitis B through vaccination, the nation's rate of infection has doubled in the past decade, with cases among heterosexual young adults up 77 percent. Fourteen Americans die every day from hepatitis-B related cirrhosis and liver cancer~ despite the availability of safe and effective vaccines to prevent infections. More than one-third of the 300,000 Americans infected each year with hepatitis B are college-aged or young adults, based on Centers for Disease Control (CDC) figures. The American Coilege Health Association (ACHA) believes that vaccinating college students against hepatitis B will help prevent the spread of the virus. \Vaccination of college students provides an excellent opportunity to prevent a substantial num1,>er of hepatitis. B infections,\ says MarJeanne Collins, M.D., Chair of the Vaccine Preventable Diseases Committee of ACHA. \ACHA has a policy statement which recommends required vaccination for all health professional students. It also strongly urges that all college students be considered for vaccination, with special attention given to high-risk groups~ including those who may be sexually active.\ The Hepatitis B Campus Prevention Program is part of a national educational campaign against hepatitis B. which involves celebrities, sports figures, government and medical authorities. Other elements of the program include television and radio public service announcements, transit advertising and partnerships with numerous National Basketball Association · (NB A) and National Football League (NFL) teams.

NEWS ANALYSIS November 12,1992, Page 4 Wrapping Election '92 by Jim Polites News Analysis Editor Now that it has been over a week since Bill Clinton's rousing Presidential victory, this is the perfect time to devote some space. to the myriad of statewide elections and issues across the United States that were decided on November 3. For George Bush, his task is to 'mop up', tie in loose ends, and plan for his departure from the White House. President-elect Clinton must focus his attention on putting together a transition team that will make his sojourn from the Arkansas governor's mansion to 1600 Pennsylvania A venue a smooth one. But back to the local contests and referenda. In the Senate, many of the candidates up for reelection this year withstood the anti-incumbent sentiment stemming from the country's economic woes. The Democrats gained just one seat in Congress' Upper House, two short of tbe elusive 60-seat majority that would have granted them the power to block Republica.n filibuster (delay tactics). Most noteworthy of all newcomers to the Senate is Carol Moseley Braun {D-Illinois), the first black female voted to Congress- ever.. She will be joined by Democrats Dianne Feinstein and Barbara ltoxer, who claimed two open seats in California, and otll!ers. I think it's herutening to see that 1tbe voting ,!)()pulation is taking a crack at 1tanishing the lilly- white, ma1le-dominated Ccmgress that ~e have aH gr<>wn accustomeod. All told, there are a record number of women and minontles com:posing the 103rd Collgress- let us :hope this is a trend that will .continue to reflect the nation~sdiversity. I was especial! y .pleased by the initiative to limit terms of office in Congress in 14 states: .Mizona, Arkansa.s, California, Hori<la. Michigam, Missouri, Mo,ntana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, OJ:egon, South Dakota, Washington, and Wyoming. If there's something wrrong with Washington,, D.C. today it'~ the presence of aging, career politicians who have lost touch with their constituents. Rather than posing as an home state advocate in Congress, far too many representatives today look for the quickest way to get reelected. If the Senate alld House are going to fulfill their design as lawmaking bodies for the people, at least ensure that constant streams of fresh ideas are flowing. You will have a hard time convincing me that 70-year old congressmen with ten terms ofoffice behind them are attuned to the changing, intricate issues of today's population. The United States as a whole ·voted overwhelmingly . for tile generational ticket of Clinton/Gore, the same mandate should be made for the legislative branches if that's the direction we're moving. Now I'd just like to wrap up my personal feelings on tile Presidential election. I was a 'soft' Clinton voter, meaning that while I didn't believe everything he was promising, I did think that he was the best choice of the three. Some GOP dieha-ds on television and here Oil campus tried convincing me that things in America couldn't get any worse, and to cast my ballot for Geor:ge Bush. Well such a stance in my mind would be hypocritical. I- like everyone in this C()untry- am looking forwa1d to better economic times. The fact is, it was Mr. Bush wh.o presided over the 'credit crud' prosperity of the 1980's as Vice-President then President, then watched helplessly as our economy stumbled and fell. Voting Bush back to office would have been akill to excusing his domestic futility- I couldn't bring myself to do that. Second, I believe that the Democrats simply ran a much better organized campaign. Right fr(}m their inspiring National Convention in New York City to Election Day, the challengers knew they had to focus the race on our tough economic and social times- this was how they were going to break the 12-year GOP reign. On the flip side, the Do you have confidence in Bill Clint()n with respect to Do~mestic Policy Foreign Policy Republican efforts were both poorly timed and ill construed. The President wa:ited until Clinton hao· amassed a 20- something point lead before firing back at the challengers. When Republicans finally responded, they chose to rely on the party's most conservative members- individuals like Pat Robertson. There was also the focus on family values, a platform issue that I still don't completely comprehend. I doubt very much that the skilled laborers out of work in this country want to bear a lecture ()n how to raise their children. In short, the Democrats correctly calculated what the U.S. population deemed important in 1992. The Republicans relied on experience and lost. George Bush said of the election, with class and dignity, that \the people have spoken, and we respect the majesty of the democratic system.\ What he was saying is that the ball is now in your hands, Bill Clinton, do with it what you can. Let us wait and see what happens. No 21% Yes 25% Unsure· ... ,,; ..

November 12, 1992, Page 5 200% French Wine Tariff Expected to Start December 5 by Shields Day Busin~ss Editor By now almost everyone has heard about the 200% tariff that will he imposed on 'French wine. This tariff is expected to go into effect in less than one month (December 5) unless the United S~tes and the European Economic Community (EEC) can settle their differences. _As time draws nearer and nearer for the advent of the EEC more and more problems are quickly arising. First, the EEC had to contend with Denmark and its salvos of withdrawal which erupted earlier this year. Now the EEC must deal with outside nations taxing the EEC~ s products. The EEC was fonned to help nations. inside the community trade With one another without international trade barriers. This will let countries produce more of their staple crops because there will be no trade tariffs or international taxes inside ~e EEC. In the process of settmg up this international conglomerate, however, the EEC and its founders have offended many nations. The dispute between the EEC and the United States began because the United States was angry at the EEC- for heavily subsidizing their soybean and other oilseed farmers. According to United States authorities,. United States :>oybean fa:ttmers are losing as much as one billion dollars each year because of the EEC subsidies. I11 order to compensate for the one :billion dollar IDss, the United States will impose a tariff on all white wines, canola oil, a:nd wheat gluten coming out of the European Economic Commu11ity. Not sul]>risingly, the EEC quickly retaliated by claiming they wotJld match any tariffs · imposed by the Unite-d States. Although the United' States is not angry at France in particular, the Freneh are the ones w llo will be hurt the most The tariffs were directed mainly at the most popular, most well known French wines. The 200% tariff will transform a $15 bottle of wine into a $45 bottle of wine .by imposing a $30 dollar tariff. At this astoundingly lligh price, pr?~ably even the big,gest af1c10nados of Fre11ch wine win fmd alternative substitutes. In the states, importers are pulling every string they can grab hold of to get French white wine into their wareh0uses. In anticipation of the likely tariff, importers want to get as many bottles of wine in undel' the wire as they- possibly can. President-elect Bill Clinton has his first major dilemma. Profile of a Baby Boomer .· ·. Baby B<;x>rl'!ers, ne~y on.e-third of the U.S.population a00 the largest · generation m Amencan history, are_headint:~ in1o middle age.:- . Who they ar~ This predicament will test both his intemational and economic skills. Businessman - and politicians alike are anxious to see how Clinton will handle this problem. After Clinton stated that he was going to be tough on the Japanese, it will be interesting to see how he will handle the EEC which has the potential to grow as strong as Japan in just a short few years. Is it possible that the Bush administration is sending its last message out to the European Economic Community? France. which is one of the strongest economic nations in the community, can handle a loss in their wine sector much better than most smaller nations could. France is so big that they have many sectors of their economy to fall back on if one is temporarily stunted. Many of the other nations in the EEC are not so lucky. If one of the smaller nations, such as Denmark were to loose a sizable portio~ of their economy due to plans t'xecuted by the EEC, they would suffer terribly. Could it be th.at the U.S. is sending a warmng to EEC nations that they better make sure they ~now what they are getting mto before January 1, 1993?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average began the wee~ with a 35 point rally looking forward to the election outcome. . Some expected a cont?tu~d rise on Tuesday with contmumg news of Clinton's le~ds. However, profit-taking stifled any further rally and the Dow eased to 3252. Late Wednesday, computer guided selling caused the Dow to fall ~o 3223 on worries -of rising mterest rates. On Thursday, the Dow recovered to 3243 and held to 3240 Jhrough the close , of trading on Friday. Things were not so good in the bond market. Yields on the 30 year treasury jumped from y.65% «;> 7.76%. Though this Jump m1ght seem small, it is ~onsidered major among mvestors and traders. Yield and price of a bond are inversely related so prices fell for bondholders. Nothing really exciting has happened in the stock and bond markets this week. That is probably because the market is anxiously awaiting the details of President-elect Bill Clinton's economic plans. We can be sure that when he takes office, every statement he makes will ~ave some kmd of impact as mvestors try to detetmine what the implications of his different policies will be for the stock and bond markets. One thing that has come of the election results is the strengthening of the dollar due to rising interest rates. The recent rise in U.S. interest rates due to fears of inflation under a democratic president is primarily responsible for the ~ump in the dollar. Rising mterest rates strengthen a country's currency by making deposits held in that currency attractive relative to deposits held in other currencies. Investors try to purchase the currency and the buying pressure pushes the currency's value up. There has also been renewed hope that Germany's Bundesbank will lower its key lending rates and allow further gains for the dollar. Al.l in _all things are pretty passiVe m the markets. If tradition holds, the month of December will remain passive .. This season especially because it is an election year.

Quite a short, yet complex explanation for Richard Paper, the main character in best selling author ,Donna Tartt's, first novel, The Secret History. At age 28, Tartt has produced a work which, when pl~ced in one's hands. is impossible to put down until completed. Murder, mystery, wit and Greek all combined into this literary \classic\. Ricllm-d and his brainy friends are students of on eccentric classics professor (not your everyday Prof. Scott Scullion), who insists that his students take only his curriculum. For me to tell you anything more about the book, simply would not do it justice. This book is a must read for anyone wanting to keep their mind running and their head in the coll'ege atmosphere while on winter break. This, of course, would be an excellent time to read the book, as you would not have to blow off any classes wanting to finish it. Glamour magazine quotes, \The secret History pulses like a telltale heart on steroid.\ Time says the book \offers the zest of the author's energy and the pleasure of seeing a young mind tackle classic forms.\ And the president of Knopf publishers claims, \The book has an energy like few I have read in recent memory.\ Tartt, a graduate of Bennington College, has joined aad probably sur.passed the ranks .of other young intellectual authors like Easton EUis, Jay McLerey and Jill Eisenstadt. Tartt has received acclaim from authors and critics all across the country while .on a promotional tour of the U.S. Ms. Tartt wHl be in Schenectady at the Open Door Bookstore on Jay Street on Thursday Night December 3, 1992. The Secret History is available now and highly recommended by myself for $23, less 15% while on the NY Times BestseUer List. Have your copy signed by the author, if in the area, or remember to keep this one in mind while sunning on the beaches in Mexico or wherever else your Winter Break might take you.

A concert by Tbe Ellen Sinopoli Dance Company, Inc., Resident Dance Company of the Empire Center at the Egg, Albany, NY, will be presented at the Skidmore College Field House Dance Theater, on November l3 and14. Last year's sold out Skidmore concerts received enthusiastic acclaim for choreographic craft, diverse musicality and technical challenge. Two new works by Ms. Sinopoli, the company's Artistic Director, will be premiered. Symbiosis, a six minute duet set to the enticing rhythms of Sergio Mendes and Carmen Alice, will be performed by company members, Kim En gel and Michelle Reagan. Ghost Crossing, a solo danced by Karen Knerr, presents the ancestor who waits and remembers. Also in the program will be Bein' Cool, premiered last spring during Ms. Sinopoli's participation in the series, Making Dances: New Works b) independent choreographers. Set to ''Blue Seven\ of the Sonny Rollins Quartet, Bein' Cool explores the improvisational world of the jazz musician. Juxtaposed into the visual of the dancer's realm, one sees the creative· virtuosity of the individuals : gradually woven into a: rollicking ensemble of physicality and exuberance. Performances at the Skidmore Concert are scheduled for &PM. Tickets are $10 for general admission and $8 for senior citizens and children under 12.

The characters are ~tat well developed, leaving several loose ends untied and others too neatly resolved. Wesley Snipes, an actor of substantial .ability, takes the helm in the role of John Cutter. Gimme a break. Already, the name is· cheezy. \Oh no! Here comes big bad John Cutter.\ Wbatever happened to the names like Harry Palmer, simple, but driven to meaning b' actors like Michael Caine? Anyway, Cotter has left the high-tech, high-tension security business after the tragiC murder of his wife in a grocery store holdup. WON'T Of course, Cutter feels responsible for her death and resigns himself to teaching safety techniques to airline stewardesses. In a bizarre turn of events, he accepts a job as head of security for a major airline, and on his flight out to California the plane is hijacked by the most feared terrorist in the world. Cutter must figure out a way to save the passengers, outwit the genius terrorist \Rayne\ (ridiculously known as the Rayne of terror'), and flirt with the leggy stewardess within the span of ninety minutes. Snipes does his best with a script jam packed with one liners that miss. He bas been trying to break free from the label of \Black Actor\ placed on him by .parts in New Jack City, Junsle Fever, and White Men Can't Jump, but this SOAR probably wasn't the right pick. I'm looking forward to his next movie, whatever it may be. Jllst not this. Bruce Payne, who plays the villain Rayne, is a sensational actor, and his demented vehemence keeps the movie going. I still liked him better in Pyrates, though. This movie is still somewhat enjoyable. though, despite the shabby package. If you want some action. this has plenty. It's blatantly predictable, but so was Rocky V, and everybody seemed to like that.

November 12,1992, Page 7 ARTS and ENTERTAINMENT Goliath on 74th Street vs. the Woman Who Loved Vegetables l>y Carrie Sherman Arts Editor Playwright and Actress Alice Eve Cohen will be coming to Proctor's Too on Friday November 20th and Saturday November 21st.. Ms. Cohen will be performing a piece entitled, Goliath on 74th Street vs. the Woman who Loyed Vegetables. Goliath is a modern myth based around the biblical story of David and Goliath. Ms. Cohen will present this solo performance which is a comedy about a woman living in New York who is seeking some tranquillity form her fast paced life. The New York Times described her performance, \(Cohen) evokes a supernatural spirit world in which everything has supernatural resonance.\ Cohen describes her owll performance as simple, direct, and to the point. Ms. Cohen has pe:tiormed ORPHANS Courtesy of Roadshow Productions \ORPHANS\ by Lyle KessLer opens November 16 at the Maureen Stapleton Theatre at Hadson Valley Community College and runs through November 22, Monday through Satur<lay shows are at 8:00PM, Sunday's show is at 3:00PM. Directed by Doug deLisle, \ORPHANS\ features Christopher Foster as Treat, a street smart punk; Robert Weidert as Phillip, his recl\lsive, illiterate brother; Paul Richer as Harold, the mysterious mobster whom Treat kidnaps. . Set Design is by David Bunce, costume design by Jenniver Sparano, lighting design by Richard Jones, and sound design by Barbara Breedlove. The stage manager is Steve O'Connor. \ORPHANS\ is a tale of two almost feral youths on the edge of society and the man who \tames\ them. From their old, decaying house in Philadelphia, the orphaned brothers hold the world at bay-- emotionally and physically. From this den, Treat darts out like a wild animal into the civilized world to mug and steal. Phillip, his younger 9rother, remains beh.ind, convinced by Treat that if he ventures out of the house, he'll have allergic reactions and die. In this dysfuntional, closed- off world, Treat is king. completely dominating his brother. But he makes a mistake-- he allows the outside world to come in in tbe form of a drunken, dapper gangster, Harold--and his life, and Phillip's are irretrievably changed. Playwright Lyle Kessler has speculated that his play elicits such str()ng responses because it's about connecting with others, about sustenance, about finding love unexpectedly under the oddest of circumstances: \The three characters all have something missing,\ Kessler says. \The play evokes a yearning. I think, for something long gone. It taps into some kind of basic longing.\ · \ORPHANS\was produced, originally, in Los Angeles in 1983. Steppenwolf Theatre Company's artistic director, Gary Sinise, read \ORPHANS\ and produced it in a much- changed version at the company's Chicago Theater where the now landmark production won brilliant notices.

SCIENCE and HEALTH OUT OF CONDOMS??'? BIR1H CONTR,QL ALTERNATIVES ------~------------- By Eileen Colkin Science Ediitor Everyone likes to have sex. Period. It's a natural human function and provides us with a means of continuing our species. Not to mention that it can feel pretty . good. However, many people our age don't generally engage in sexual activity in order to reproduce, so science has given us the wonderful gift of contraception which allows us to enjoy the physical aspects of intercourse without the possibility of pregnancy. Different contraceptives work in different ways, some by blocking the sperm from reaching the egg or by killing sperm, some by keeping the egg from being released each month, and others by changing the lining of the uterus so that pregnancy does not occur. One of the most widely used and highly effective methods of contraception is the birth control pill, or oral contraceptive. The pill contains hormones that closely resemble those a woman's body produces naturally. By taking the pill at the same time every day, the woman prevents her ovary from releasi'ng an egg that could otherwise been fertilized. In terms of effectiveness, one in three hundred taking the pill will become pregnant. There are both negative and positive side effects to the pill. On the lighter side, periods may become more regular, and the risk of cancer may be lessened. However, negative side effects may include nausea. spotting, missed periods, headaches, and mood changes. The contrac~ptive implant, also kn~wn as NORPLANT, also c<Jntains a hormone similar to what a woman's body pmduces. It prevents pregnancy by preventing ovulation as well as causing changes in tfle cervical mucus and in the' lining of the uterus. With NORPLANT, six. match- sized, soft rubber tubes that contain hormones are placed beneath the skin of the upper arm in a minor surgical procedure using local anesthesia. The implants provide birth control for up to 5 years. They are an effective means of birth control because they require no work on the woman's part after they have been inserted. They can be removed when a woman wishes to stop using them, or replaced with new implants after 5 years. Removal requires another surgical procedure. Some side ·effects for NORPLANT include irregular menstrual cycle for the first 6 months with longer periotls. spotting or skipped periods, headaches. and possible weight gain. The intrauterine device, or IUD, is a small plastic device containing copper or hormones that is inserted and left inside the uterus. The presence of the IUD in the uterus creates a reaction that prevents fertilization of the egg in the tubes or attachment of the fertilized egg to the wall of the uterus. The HJD is not recommended to women who have not had any children. The risk of pelvic infection, which can cause infertility, is higher with an IUD for women who are not in stable relationships with only one partner. Tile barrier methods of contraception include the diaphragm, cervical cap, condom, vaginal sponge, and spermicidal creams, jellies, and foams. Tile diaphragm is a round rubber dome that fits inside the woman's vagina and covers her. cervix, and the cervical cap is a small rubber cup that fits ()ver the cervix and stays in place by suction. Both must be individually fitted by a medical professional~ a:nd are inserted prior to intercGurse. There is a slight danger of Toxic Shock Synd.J()me, and needs to be accompanied by a spermicide. We all pretty much know what the contiom is and how it works. However, it is important to keep in mind that, used alene, the condom is not lOOo/o effective. They can break~ fall off, etc. Therefore it i.s recommended tllat condoms be accompanied by a spermicide, which can be a foam, creme or suppository applied or inserted int:<:J the vagina prior to intercours.e. If a woman uses a spermicide and her partner a quality condom, pregnancy chances are reduced to }(}r 2 in 100. In choosing a method of contracepti()n, several factors need to be taken into account, such as how important it is to a void pregnancy~ how safe tbe method is, how well the chosen method suits the individual's:. lifestyle and sexual habits, and the personal preferences of the couple. Althougll it may be burdensome and annoying, contraception is necessary for people wh() are enjoying a healthy seJC life, yet don't wish to become pregna11t. Obviously, there are several methods avililable, so check it out now before you or your partner ends up with a bigger problem thm you intended! Tired of dorm laundry rooms?

You can raise your blood cholesterol level by eating too much food rich in saturated fatty acid such as animal fat and palm, palm kernal, and coconut oils. High cholesterol can cause build up in the inner lining of blood vessels and eventually block the blood flow. The block can lead to a heart attack. Thus, the American Heart Association suggests you limit total fat intake to Jess than 30 percent of your daily calories and saturated fats to less than 10 percent. These 12 tips will help: 1: Switch from whole milk to milk that's 1 percent fat or less. 2: Read labels on food, noting the grams and kinds of fat. 3: Switch. from butter to margarine with no more than two grams of saturated fat per tablespoon, and use butter- flavored granules. 4: Switch. to low fat salad .dressing and low fat mayonnaise. 5: Avoid fried fouds. 6: Eat five or more fruits or fruit juices and vegetables a day. 7: Switch to low fat or fat free cheeses. 8: Eat only lean cuts of red meat, remove the skin from poultry before it's cooked and cat fislt often. 9: Eat more bread, cereal, rice, and pasta. 10: Eat low fat breakfast items such as cereal. English muffins, bagels, and whole grain bread rolls. ll: Eat low fat ice milk, sherbert, and other low fat desserts. 12: Switch to polyunsaturated and monounsaturated oils such as canola, corn, safflower, sesame, soybean, sunflower and olive oil, and usc non- stick vegetable cooking spray. Trying all 12 tips at once is not the best way for everybody. The AHA suggests taking a step at a time so that the new habits can more easily become permanent. Call the American Heart Association at l-800-AHA- USA 1 for these and dozens of other tips to help make your heart healthier. GOOD LUCK ON FINALS!

Malicious criticism can never ha~e such an effec:t. At Concordiensis, we welcome constructive criticism. We furthermore encourage .those students who believe thllt they can help :to improve the paper to join the staff and help to implement thl.eir ideas. In their Letter to the Editor (O:mcordiensis Blasted), appearing in the November 5 issue of C0oncordiensis, James Rawstron and Ted Geilen hurl malicious criticism at the wrritiags of several Concordiensis staff members · as well as at the pllper as a whole. [f Concordiensi:s is tile \mediocre\ newspaper that the critics believe it to be, 1his is a reflection on the mediocrity of the stu.dent body l!_t Union College. Union students are characterized by the administration and the faculty as being generally apathetic. A note to our critics : What have you done to improve the ne-wspaper? Abs(I;)lutely nothing. You are the typical apathetic st11dent who levies wllimsical, unfounded complaints for the sake of being a complainer. Concordiensis staff members, if nothing else, cannot be clllssified as ap3thetic. A statement about the dedication of Olncordiensis staff members is needed. Union College is one of tile few institutio11s that does not offer compensation for those st11dents who spenod countless hours providing a newspaper for the st11dents at their ctOllege. Staff members receive no course credits for their efforts. a fact that was found astounding by editors of other college new spapers. Yet, staff members consistently work all night Tuesday to produce the paper. 1 am not saying that they. she>uld be shielded from constructive criticism, but malicious cri.ticism is not called for. Tbe complaints were, in part, founded on the myth that Concordiensis ha:.s a big budget. Our budget barely covers the C()St of printing,. and the equipment that we use would be C()nsidered archaic, even for a high school newspaper. Get the facts straight. Pulblish:ing a newspaper without the support of the student body is not easy.

I would first like to point out that this, to my knowledge, is tile first we at Concordiensis have ever heard from such fine literary critics. Although both gentleme-n proudly signed their \'93\ at the close of their article, 1 wonder as to .the effectiveness of exposing their graduaticn date. Seeing as neither cf their names have appeared on the pages of our newspaper before, it seems to me that James and Ted are exactly the \whiny\ stereotype they so attacked in their own article. If you both feel so strongly as to the :poor quality of Concordiensis, please go right ahead and produce something that you believe measures up. Concordiensis is your paper. Your ability to criticize something that is entirely open to your improvement amazes me. If I may quote ... \Ms. O'Neil, you have been given an opportunity to create something of substance for the paper, yet you continually come up with clrivel.\ Mr. Rawstron and Mr. G~ilen, you also have been given this opportunity. It apopears to me that Ms. O'Neil's so-called \drivel\, takes a lot more time and effort than your insulting letter to the editor. Please, if you have something to live up to your definition of \substance\, we'd be happy to print it. · Finally, I'd like to point out that Mr. Rawstron and Mr. Geilen, are in no way \forced\ to \weed out\' Mr. Bartell's \garbage.\ Feel free to put the paper down or better yet turn the page. No ene is asking you to be their literary critics. The Concordiensis is by the students, for the students. Stop considering it your given right to be entertained. If you dislike it, try to involve yourself by producing something you do like rather than sitting back and complaining abo11t the efforts of everybody else. SLEEPING BEAUTY IS A BIG FAT LIE l>y Amy Cypres Contribu{ing Writer Since this will be the last of my series for a while, I figured I'd leave something worth contemplating. I must begin with the admission that the answer to this question is a mystery to me, so if any one out there knows, tell me. Two friends and 1 were sitting in the Skellar recently, discussing that age old question: Can men and women be friends? I must hasten to add, that this topic was raised in response tile 'poll that appeared in last week's Concordensis. While- they concluded that I had enough opinions to enlighten the reading public on this matter, I'm still not quite sure on where ·I come down on such a quandary. Although, if I had to choose, I'm inclined to agree with Harry (of When He Met Sally fame) who concllJded in his infi11ite wisdom, that no, because \that sex thing always gets in tile way\. And so It does, even in same sex relationships, presuming a heterosexual orientation, the attraction factor exists. But thanks to society, that dynamic becomes suppressed, surfacing in the accepted displays of emotional intimacy. (As a personal note, 1 for one am grateful, it's conf11sing enough dealing with all of this with the opposite gender.) So, now what? I think it's only prudent to examine the many definitions of 'friend'. Webster's Dicticnary says, \One that seeks tile society or welfare of another whom he holds in affection, respect or esteem or whose companionship arnd :personality are pleasurable: an intimate associate especially when other than a lover or a relative\. Greek society said that \philia\ or friendship, is not based on an emotional intimacy, but comprised of a more political loyalty, defending one's allies, and harming one;s enemies. In my experience, (and as always, that's all I'm qualified to speak from) the definition differs according to gender. For men, frieAdship often encompasses sex, or a physical relationship. The choice of whether to act upon this is irrelevant, because, regardless of the occurrence of the event, you can remain friends. So yes;, it is possible for men and women to be friends, sex is a fringe benefit. But for women, myself and other women I know, it's more clear cut. A · friend is a friend, existing only on the emotional level. Once you have a physical relationship, the dynamics change, you're no longer- just friends. The fairy tale still exists. Even the most cynical among us, clings to the expectation that this action turns that male into a knight in shining armor. To quote a friend of mine,\Turning that terrestrial being into a celestial being.\ Why this confusion? Society's rules are still in play. Just look around, every children's story and Hollywood megahit (think Pretty Woman, not Die Hard) enforces the myth. May btl both parties need to reexamine their part in the perpetuation of this model. I don't know. AU I do know is that until we figure it out, the question will remain unanswered. - s { \ 1 1 l

November 12, 1992, Page 11 LETTERS Insecurities about Union Security Greek Philanthropists To the Editor: With recent safety problem's both on and off the Union campus, one would think that securily would be improved or at least increased. ;f am referring to numerous accounts of vanda:tism towards automobiles parked on campus, as well as the recent attack of a Union female on Gillespie Street. After these events occurred, it would be logical for Union's security team to take more precautions to ,insure the safety of an· students. Unfortunately, the security team has n(!)t recognized the fact that their efforts are not .providing sufficient safety to the Union community, but rather they themselves are promoting an unsafe environment. My accusations of their neglect are backed by recent events during which the Union College security officers failed to respond in an acceptable manner. For example, this past Saturday night (November 7, 1992) I took the carnpus security shuttle from University Place to Nott Street at approximately 9:30 P.M .. Instead of being picked up by the shuttle van, I was met by an officer in a white security car. This officer was unfamiliar with Union's ~am pus as well as local streets. I had to direct him to Nott Street because he stated that he was new and was unfamiliar with the area. This ignorance is simply unacceptable as it increases security's response time to possible emergencies, thereby putting student's safety at risk. As w,ell as having staff members who have yet to familiarize themselves with the U nicm community, the security team is also at fault for not responding to student's calls. This past Sunday evening (November 8, 1992) I called security from the college center and asked for access to the Arts buildi~g. Because art classes require many hours of work outside of class time, professors put their students on an access list which enables them to enter specific rooms inside the building. This particular evening, all three doors to the buiilding were locked, which caused me to call secmity. After finding my name on the access list, the attending officer told me to wait at the back door of the building for the officer to arrive. I left the college center and went to wait behind the arts building where I did so for 45 minutes. At 7:30 at night, this area is deserted, fairly dark, and not a safe place for an individual to wait by herself. I had decided to stop waiting after 45 minutes in the cold weather when a suspicious stranger emerged from behind the building. He approached me, as1ced for a cigarette, and proceeded to keep me company during the delay. Since this stranger's presence was undesirable, I headed for my parked car and proceeded to e.scape an uncomfortable situation. Once again, security not only neglected to ensure my safety, but they also jeopardized my well-being. Events such as these may seem minimal, but they are just two unrelated situations where security failed to meet my needs as a student. These occurrences took place over the course of two days. and I wonder how many other people have had their individual problems recently with the Union security team. Overall, the security officers employed by Union College do provide a fairly safe environment for students, but I feel that there are many creases in the system which must be ironed out. Their response .time should be decreased and their availability should be unlimited. Student's safety should be a priority and not something that should be put at risk. If this means an increase in staff members tban that is an issue which must be addressed; or maybe the cunent security officers should spend less time ticketing harmless cars and more time patrolling the campus and it's surrounding area .. Sincerely, Pamela Leinson '93 Public· Speaking Committee Commended To the Editor: The students who plan the Public Speaking Competition deserve praise. Not only have they successfully maintained one of the most important student-initiated efforts in the past ten years, but they have also shown both flexibility and sensitivity to other campus concerns. Through a blunder in Office of Campus Schedulin~. the \finals\ for the Public Speaking Competition were scheduled last Wednesday at the same time as the Bicentennial Lecture delivered by William H. Gray. The student organizes were asked if it were possible to move the time of their event. They quickly and graciously agreed .to delay the \finals\ to 9:30 p.m. so that interested students and faculty could attend both events. On behalf of the Bicentennial Steering Committee, l commend the group for their \standing and delivering\ on this accommodation. And I recommend to all students and faculty alike that they attend the \fmals\ in fut11re years--it's a stimulating and fun event. YoursTruly Byron A. ~ichols Co-Chair,Bicentennial Steering Comm. 1' <> the Editor: I admit that my positive opinion of Greek Organizations Freshman year was due to the social opportunities one gained by being a member. Even tllroughout my sophomore year when I participated in philanthropic events my sorority sponsored, I still felt as if they were just another t'meeting\ the sisters had to atte11d. It was only last week that I realized the real importance of community service and the contributions Greeks make to Schenectady. A requirement was made by our National Council for each sister to complete five hours of community service by the end .of Fall term. I thought about th,is and wondered when I, along with the rest of the sisters, would fit five hours of volunteer work into our schedules. My attitude was not positive and the five hours simply remained as another . item on my list of things to do. Finally, two sisters and I completed the hours at Coats for Kids last Thursday. Walking into the downtown Schenectady building where Coats for Kids is held, I felt as if tile next few hours would be similar to other volunteered hous such as the ones I have spellt tutoring grammar school chi:l<lren. My expectations quickly changed as I descended into the dingy basement where old coats hung waiting to be picked up and brought home. In the next few hours I encountered a part of the community that I thought I wollld never be so closely exposed to. The customers ranged from Caucasian to Hispanic and from babies to adults. No matter what age or race. thoagh, they all l1ad the same looks of hope on their faces. This was one of their only opvortunities at receiving a warm coat for the winter. Mter they would leave, I was told from another volunteer about some of ~he Lives these people lead. One woman's husband jus~ k r, hrr after thirty years, with three kids and a lower class apartment in a dangerous part of town. Others were simply struggling and always would. They all remained so mew hat friendly, though, saying thank you, aud asking for help when needed in finding a size. The worst part was seeing the innocent children and knowing they did not have any idea Gf the hard times ahead they would face. My friends a11d I had tht:: same feelings whcll we lcfl. We discussed how different our lives were from the people we had just encountered, and how the scope of our problem~ seemed to dwindle at that moment. We were bo{)rn into a safe environment a11d wer~ given a fair share of our needs. We thought abotu ,going back to our warm, comf{)rtabk, dorm rooms, and tllc sccurit)l we would feel when we g()l there. Most importantly, we thought about our future and how many opportuni tics we would have, opportunitic~ these people know tllcy will never be given. What I thought would lJc just another few howrs turned out to be a lcarniag experience - one I will remember. If I did not have the pressure from my sorority I doubt I WOllld have offered my time. Tllis is wh)l Greek organizations remain, and one of the reasons wlly they were founded. rhat is tlle reason I am writing 11Jis letter- I wanted to make sure the purposes of Greek organizations wew not overlooked by the reputation they are sometimes given of being only a social organization. Sincerely Melissa Affronti '94 Social Policy at Union Brought Under Attack Thanks From AI the Dog To the Editor: I normally like to maintain a low profile on most issues and indeed, this is my first letter to the editor ever, but I think it is important to take a moment out of an otherwise solidly packed working day to make a few comments on the new social policy here at Union. Being a senior arid grad11ating in June after a 4 year period of some fairly tumultuous and unpopular changes in Union, I think it is important to draw the line and make it clear as to just how far the administration should go in trying to shape and mold the lives of the students at Union. In last week's Concordiensis, it was stated that the reason for enforcing the social policy was to get students to become more serious as students and to try to induce strong study habits throughout the student body. It is feared by faculty and administration alike that students appropriate far too much time to socializing than to academic work. Therefore, it would only seem logical to impede the students' ability to socialize in order to implement this change, right? Nothing could be further from the truth! By making this statement, the administration has chosen to act as baby-sitters or absentee parents to all of the young adults studying here. It may be surprizing to be informed that there are no babies here who need to be told what to do and how to do it. Regardless of how faculty and administration feel about the performance of students as a whole or on an individual basis, neither of them would be acting appropriately to tell thestudents how to divide their time between their social lives and academics. It is NOT the responsibility of the administration to tell students how and when to study; nor are they correct in making the assumption that students need to be watched over like children and be dictated proper academic behavior. Rather, their responsibility is to run the college and ensure that Union is the best ed11cational institution it can possibly be, having a solid yet well-rounded program to fit the needs of its students. And yes, well- rounded does include the opportunity for students to interact on more tllan a purely academic basis: socializing plays an important and integral role in the development of young adults in the college age bracket. It is not for the administration to say how or how much time students should spend socializing. There are far more important issues to be dealt with when running a college. If a student cannot be serious enough to be responsible for the· workload expected of college students, he or she does not belong in college. It is up to the individual student to find the right balance between work and play and to be successful in his or her college career. So please, Union College administrators. and all other powers that be, treat students as the young, responsible ad11lts that they are trying to become. Do not turn the fut11re of Union onto the dismal path towards a bo()kworm monastery. Instead, treat the students with the respect owed to young ad11lts striving to make their mark in the world. Perhaps, if you follow this simple priilciple, the students will bee orne the thriving successes vo11 would like them to be. Sincerely, Mike Morin '93 To the Editor: We wish to tbank the members of the Union College community for opening their hearts and wallets. Last Thursday, Al the Dog was the victim of a hit and run accident on campus. His injuries were serious, a collapsed lunj5. bruised heart, and a broken leg. The medical expenses incurre<l ·for treating AI exceeded $650. :Through the generosity of the ·Union College community we were able to raise $433 in an effort to cover these costs. A 1 the Dog is now we II on his way to a full recovery. Thanks again.

FEATURES Bookstore Racket Chris Keegan Contributing Writer In the late Nineteenth Century and the early Twentieth Century, binionaires like Vanderbilt, Rockefeller. and J.P. Morgan ran monopolies that controlled the vertical and horizontal aspects of our economy and posed the power we now only read about in Danielle Steele novels. These \great\ trust owners were able to fix their prices and wages in such a manner as to make profits in one year that could now buy Manhattan. But then came the anti-trust acts and slowly but surely these monopolies were disassembled even though these wealthy families continued to be wealthy. Yet, the word monopoly does not just simply apply to a game played world wide for the last few decades. it applies to a business, for example, which exists right here on Union College's illustrious campus. Yes, to those who have not yet received their bill for books and supplies during this fall term, it is the Union College Book Store that has manifested itself in t~~ !~age of a greedy tiger, devouring the innocent students who are unable to purchase·' their supplies elsewhere. The book store has sole control of Union's academic supplies, therefore making it possible for the store to raise the prices to a \satisfactory\ level. But the exploitation only begins here, it continues in its scandalous handling of used books. When a student sells a book back, he or she will receive a smaU fraction of what the book originally cost. The book store then sells these used books for slightly less than a new book but much than what the previous owner received in monetary compensation. Those students in the Academic Opportunity Program, your cries will be voiced here, for the book store has manipulated these students into ~elieving that their $150.00 book store credit limit will be sufficient in providing them with essentials for the classroom. But all Union students know that, as is the case with everything of monetary value on this campus, the books needed for one term well exceed $150.00. The students in the A.O.P. have, on the whole, much less available fu!l~. for extra costs during a t{mn here at Union, probably less than would the average Union student. Most of the students in this program have incredible academic talent, and aH, as is the case with every Union student, have awesome potential. But can these, or any students, fulfill their potential with the added stress of having to accumulate anywhere between $100.00 and , $250.00 a term for books? Why can't the Union College Administration arrange for all the books to be bought by Union , then stored in a facility, and sold to the students for much less the present price? The students may then have to endure not receiving money at the end of the term, and by sacrificing this just simply give the books back in order to assure future students the ability to buy books for a highly depreciated pJjce. If the students chose to keep their books they could do so on the condition that they pay the regular full price to the book store. This is not the only alternative, but it is one many that needs to be researched in order to solve the problem of the book store's iron hand control of the students academic economy. l --. ~---- ~-------- ... ~----- -·---- ~- u-------- --- S U .R V E Y - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - '1!1' - - - - - ..... - - - - - - - - - - ll y J c r r (f r c c 11 Would you frequent Chet's more often if it were in a Skellar-like astmosp.here?

November 12,1992, Page 12 Nothing To Do But Compl~in by Brianna Patnode Concordiensis Staff \Uuhh there is NOTHING to do here except go to parties and drink, and now we can h(jfdly do that.\ If I had a dollar for every time that I have heard this, I could almost p~y for my next tuition payment.

I, in · fact, have been pretty appalled . by this at times. Instead of complaining, I decided to look for other thi1ngs to do. Surprisingly they do exist. For one thing, there have been at least two rock concerts that I know about. Yothu Yindi, and Livingston Taylor both gave performances here this fall. The sad thing is., that at least · half of the three to four hundred in attendance were not Union students. If you claim that there is nothing to do, perhaps you ·'haven't been looking carefully enough. Another prime example of nonw participation on Union students' part was the three week residency of the Bread and Puppet Theater group. Their performances required a minimum of thirty or forty people. There were only a handtul of Union students who helped out ( four or five of which were theater work study students.) The rest of the participants were Professors, local elementary and high school students and their parents. Where were all the complainers? .

The possibilities are endless, Enjoy. .. FAST FOOD REVIEW The Golden House by Tad Lee Concordiensis Staff I think in the past four years I've tried every Chinese food restaurant in Schenectady. It . was not until this year that I found one that I consistently like. Golden House, located ri~ht near Price Chopper is the best I've had in this area. No, it doesn't compare to your favorite place at home, but it Feally is pretty good. I am yet to have anythmg at Golden House that I really didn't like. For appetizers, the steamed dumplings, egg rolls, and chicken fingers have all been consistently good. The pork fried rice is excellent, although the rice is yellow (it's supposed to be). Wooton and hot and sour soups are good, but often not hot by the .time it's delivered. Make sure if you order the soup that you have a microwave handy. You also have to ask for a spoon. The beef with broccoli, the chicken with broccoli, and the pepper steak with onions are all good. If you want something a little different from those types of dishes, try the sweet and sour chicken or the sesame chicken. Both are particularly good: I'd stay away from the cashew chicken, th.ough. I'd also stay away from the seafood. I don't have a reason other than I still don't trust seafood from places that aren't located near an ocean. I've also seen their shrimp and decided it would be in my best interest not to par.take. If you're a gambling person, by all means order it. The best thing to do is order from the special combination platters, located in the bottom right corner of the menu. There are about fifteen choices and all include pork or chicken fried rice and an egg roll. The prices are also much better than if you ordered everything individually. As mentioned previously, Golden House delivers; usually in about forty-five minutes. They give you free fortune cookies and lots of duck sauce (in ·packets, though). Sodas are seventy-five cents and the total m11st be at least ten dollars for them to deliver. Expect to spend about that if you get a combination thing and an appetizer and soda.. I've tried Number One Chinese, Four Seasons, Fai Mai, Mandarin Station and Hunan Wok. Golden Honse is co:nsistently the best, and they also take checks. Beautiful.

Nove~ber 12, 1992, Page 13 FEATURES A NEW LIGHT SHED ON THANKSGIVING by Cara Soifer Lifestyles Editor When we think about the holiday Thanksgiving, we recall the paper Pilgrims and feathered turkeys and Indians made in 5th gmde art class. In elementary school, we learned what happened in 1620 when the people of Plymouth settled in New England. Our textbooks illustrated the Pilgrims and the native inhabitants trading peacefully. and then showed how our ancestors heroically civilized the natives. This biased, racist view gave us the same narrow, misleading education that we received about Christopher Columbus' voyage. But fortunately the next generations will leave elementary school with a fuller understanding of what really occurred between the Europeans and the Native Americans, and a more realistic concept of what Americans really 'celebrate' on that last Thursday every November. What about us though? Do ~y of us even realize what a reservation is, besides being the thanks Native Americans got for trying to be hospitable? Have people taken time to learn about the other cultures surrounding us? One · anonymous Sophomore asked sincerely, upon hearing the topic of this article, \so do they speak English or what?\ The ignorance pouring out from his question infuriated me, so much that I found it hard to even write, having no clue where to even begin informing people of Native American lifestyles. Of course I am not a textbook, tourguide or encyclopedia. Instead I was just lucky enough to interact with Native American people this summer. Spending time on two reservations, the Hopi in Oraibi, Arizona and the Havasupai Reservation in Supai, Arizona, I found both places struggling to stay self- sufficient, while holding onto the traditions of their culture. But with keeping up with the times, a painful struggle between traditional values and those of modern society has by Christian Glover Contributing Writer This article was inspired by the feature article in last week's Concordiensis written by Erin O'Neil. I'm not exactly sure why, but for as long as I've been here at Union College, the concept of dating has never seemed to exist. Ever since I was a freshman I have never felt that the students who attend Union felt comfortable with just casual dating. And now as a junior, when I look back on my social life at Union as a whole, I wonder why I have never asked a girl out on a date. I used to go on dates in high school, and I usually go on a few when I'm home for arisen. On the Havasupai Reservation, tourism is their sole source of income. They are constantly influenced by the Anglos (wbat. they call white tourists) alld others who travel to the bottom of the Grand canyon, the Supai's home. The Havasupai are very unusual in that their landscape attracts visitors from aU over the world, while most reservations probably feel very excluded from the rest of society. The orange and red canyon walls confine the Havasupai, while the Havasu river flows from their village to meet the Colorado river perpendicularly. Along •the way., three ,tremendous water falls create massive pools and springs of blue-green water. The water's exotic colors, the natural whirlpOols and lush green trees make this part of the desert look more like a tropical island. S<J its obvious why so many tourists undertake the 7 mile hike down the caynon, under a tortuous Arizona sun, to fmd the reservation. But the majority never interact with the · Havasupai, people of the blue- green waters. The group I was travelling in helped set up and serve at the banquets held over one weekend at the reservation, to celebrate the annual Peach festival. The festival brings in needed money, frem visitors attracted by the pow wows and rodeo shows special to the weekend. Besides for money, the village deems the weekend important to help re-instill pride in their people, The elder Havasupai, as well as the ones on Hopi reservation. spoke to us about their efforts to get the young people in their community more involved in their traditional cultllre. It is mostly the teenagers who are breaking away from their past. thinking they must change in order to become mainstream, average Americans. Yet as they do this, alcohol, pregnacy, marriage and early divorce are prevalent problems. Its scary to think this 1s the lifestyle we are projecting to them. I 4idn't get to talk with many teenagers. They kept a <JiStance, no d(O)ubtfully because they saw 'us as 'rich do· gooders.' Eut the little kids jumped at !fJJe chance to play with us, amc:iGus to receive as much atte!ltion as possible. My 10 year old friend Tiffany, told me her is mom 24 years old and already divorced. My friend Chris, also 10, has already tried. ~ocaine, but didn't like it, so st~IJped. His father is now in j~il for selling the drug. These tw~ lcids are the future for their peoJ>le. How much of an interest we take in learning from them will sllape how they will peFceive themselves. The elders offeFed their hospitality to our group basically for this reason. Tber want to show their childre11 their culture is worth holdirtg onto. During cw stay at Havasu, the Havasup~i also allowed us to participate in one of the few traditional ceremonies they stiU practice, the sweat ceremony. This includes sitting in a dug out, cave-lilce hut, with about five other pe()ple, in complete darkness.. You spend 15 minutes in i11tense heat, given off by hot co!lls. As you drip with sweat fr(}m every pore, a leader usually prays and then gives everyone a chance to share their thoughts. The pwpose is to d.eanse your body of all impurities, both physical and spiritual Leaving the sweat lodge, y-ou sink into the stream feet away, where the water washes and cools you off. Its impo~sible not to feel completely :refreshed and rejuvenated. The Havas11pai, and Native Americans as~ whole, believe in the intimate relationship between thee' earth and the mortal being. Mother Earth nourishes us, as we care for her. The sweat lodge signifies the cycle of life rooted in this relationship. The beautiful, ancient belief teaches all to be more careful and respectful towards our provider. This is very lol>sely what Thanksgivi11g meant in 1621, when Govemor Bradford declared a day- to \celebrate the harvest, [and]tllank the Lord for his Goodness\(Applebaum T k · · , 1984.) But he also declared a thanksgiving \with political intentions, [and] extended an invitation to the neighboring Indians to share in the harvest feast and regale and impress them\ {Applebaum, Thanksgiving.) Alt the trouble started when our relationship with the Native Americans was based on politics, rather than on an equal friendship. And now as we sit down at our tables, we forget about the consequences of our ancestors' actions, which took the Native Americans' land, giving us the food we eat today. But we can't ignore the issues which surround the day's history. The Native Americans living on reservations are our equals, and deserve our respect and efforts to become as aware of their culture and traditions as they are of ours. Stilll, the day means much more to all of us; the footballl games, reunions and vacations are thougtht of by most way before its historical principles are remembered. So,. there's little need to feel guilty abo11t enjoying the holiday. I for one, will be having seconds of the sweet potato-marshmellow casserole, and at least two slices of pumpkin pie. This November 26, maybe sotne will enjoy their turkey and stuffing a little less because it s 'Thanksgiving Day' and a little more because its just a good, home-cooked meal. Veronir..q Rogers and I pose by the Havasu Falls with other members of our group this summer. A Social Alternative the summer. So why haven't I ever gone on a date at Union? This bas puzzled me for quite some time. What is it about this college that makes it uncomfortable for students to casually date? The idea of dating is a beautiful one and I think it would be a lot of fun to try here. Tllink about it ... A guy and a girl are interested in one another. Nothing that stops them from sleeping at night or eating at meals, b11t a cute and fun attraction that.makes them both wonder. They don't know each other well, but they always seem to have fun when they bump into each other at a fraternity. So they go out on a date. Thatis right • they go out on a date. This is nothing serious. 1' here is no commitme11t. It is just something casual. Something fun. Sometbin.g else. They can go to a movice, or dinner, or for ice cream, or.all of them. They could simpl:y go for a walk. But they go. someplace besides a fraternity, the College Center, or the library {The library seerrts to be a good place to socialize these days, doesn't it?). Wbile they are out on this date they talk. They laugh. They get to know each other. Not as a. sister here, or a brother there, or the c·aptain of dog crap, btJt as people. lsn't that beautiful1 So why doe.sn't this happen here? Why cion't students just date? One cause for the absence of student dating may be the school's size. You may not know it. Perhaps you haven't experienced it, but Union is a small school. I used to love this when I was a freshman, but I'm not so sure anymore. Union is the kind of place where everyone knows your life better than you do. So if you date at Union most likely someone will find out, and then someone else will hear about it, and soon enough everyone knows that you're the one who goes on dates. Wouldn't that be terrible! I think I would have to transfer if the students of Union College discovered I was a ·dater. Now just for fun let's imagine that dating at Union was no big deal and if people knew you went on dates it wouldn't matter. Would it be a major campus event to go out on a date'? I think not. Another reason no one dates here may be because of the intimate scene found at Union's infamous fraternity parties. Let me first say that I find fraternity parties to be amazing and a great place to enjoy the company of your friends. I can't wait until I'm 21 so I can drink at one. But it seems that a goal of a lot of students who attend these festive events is to find someone to \hook up\ with. I don't really find hooking up repulsive. If two people want to, by all means do so. However, I do think continued on the next page

Practice hard. Better yet, call me, we'll practice together. Dear Uncle Edna, I have pet chamelions (their names I can't revetll). Lately I've had dreams whef'e my pets Glover cont. there is way too much pressure on this campus randomly stumble upon someone and try to talk them into bed. Again hook ups are fine and they can make funny stories, but they're definitely not the ()nly way to get to know someone. It may be S cbenectady Maybe there is just n<lwhere to take someone. Maybe the ten week term is not Io11g enough to find a date. Maybe we're poor college students who can't afford it. I may be wrong about this one. but the fact that this is the most conservative and closed- minded place I've ·ever been in may also contribute to the uneasiness of casual dating. Maybe the smallness of the school, the Greek system that exists here, the many traditions Union has, and all the unmentioned pressures dropped upon your shoulders here make it hard to maintain a secure, open mind. Whatever the causes may be, I can honestly say that I've never seen so many basket cases in and I are running for our lives Erin M. O'Neil \Oh God,\ I thought to myself,. \What will I wear?

Help. -Bucket Dear Bucket, First off, I think it says somewhere in the student handbook that \no man shall b~ing his 'lizard' anywhere near an all girls dorm\. That means that security is probably chasing you. That fact that you have several of these 'chamelians' is probably just a figment of your falic imagination. Don't we all wish that we had more than one 'pet'. And Oh! If they could talk! Dream on.

SPORTS November 12, 1992, Page 18 Knicks Have Eyes on the Prize Nets Step Out of K11icks Shadow By Hal Poret Co\Sports Edit.or New York Knick President Dave Cheocketts has done the best thing he could possibly have . done for tlle franchise. He has hired Pat Riley and has let him do whatever he wants. And where has it gotten the Knicks? They are now serious co11tenders'. First, i,n a 3-way dea'l involving the Orlando Magic. the Knicks obtained Charles Smith, Doc Rivers and BO> Kimble from the L.A.. Clippers for guard Mark Jac~son and a #1 draft pick. Smit& is loaded with potential and has scored 18.4 points per game. So far Smith has broken the hearts of Clipper fans, but it is still a fabulous deal for Riley wllo can probably get Smith tG reach his all-star potentiaJ:. Kimble who starred f()f Loyola. Marymount with the late Harlk Gathers also has potential, and. Doc Rivers' keen sellse of cowt awareness will be a welcome addition to the Knick: backcourt. The Kn.icks have also aquired the outside shooting that they S() desperately needed. In obtaining Rolando Blackman from Dallas, they have themselves ll 4-tirne all-star who is a prolific: scorer and a respected outside shooter. The Mavericks let tile 33 year old star go to make room for drafte.e Jimmy Jackson from 011io State. Blackman missed the whole preseason with back spasms, which is a major concern, but when he retwns healthy he will be a great addition. The Knicks also traded a 2nd round pick to the T-Wolves for swingman Tony Cambell who has scored 19.3 points per game over the last two seasons. Cambell along with first round draft pick Hubert Davis of North Carolina will help Blackman to add the respect on the perimeter that the Knicks need to fi:ee-up Patrick Ewing inside. This leaves the Knicks as a serious threat to the Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference. Remember that the Knicks tenacious defense wore out the Bulls in the playoffs last year and stretched Cl1icago to a seventh game before succumbing in a close loss in Chicago. Now the Knicks are much improved but they have lost two key factors that helped them with the Bulls. Gerald Wilkins, whose defense drove Jordan crazy and held his shooting percentage under 45% has signed with Cleveland as a free agent. No one will miss his wild, out of control drives to the hoop but his loss on defense may hurt. In addition, forward Xavier McDaniel has left New York and has signed with the Celtics. Tho;ugh the Knicks are stocked with strong forwards now, McDaniel really stepped up in the playoffs and added strong scoring and rebounding. But if you are a Knick fan, I would not be t0 worried ab01ut his loss, as ne was virtu!llly non-existant By .Rich Morgan Co-Sports Editor dur~ng the regular season, and It had been some time forwards Ctuules Oakley and • since the New Jersey Nets had Anthony Mason can easily take '· made any noise in the NBA care of tlle ~rebounding.

WL.ll The Nets are finally ready first two games of this season., , : t<> take a leap out from behind Anderson, the Nets definitely have ·the potential to make huge dent in ~their schedule. Furthermore, Cmatian Drazen Petrovic who ·led the Nets last year with his intensity and abiiity to score the important field goals, will be frred up as the season gets underway. Finally, as if Daly wasn't enough to keep the team together, the Nets this week signed ex-Pist()n Rick Mahom as a backup player. Since he played four seasons under Coach Daly, his transition into the Nets ·rotation will be that much easier. His leadership and experience is something the Nets could really use on their road to the playoffs (Mahom is 34 years old and has played 11 full seasons in the NBA). One of the teams biggest challe11ges will come when they face their ever- growing rivals, the Knicks. Last seasons series was won by the Knickeroockers, 3-2, but the Nets w<>Ill the last two games en route to the playoffs. They hope ~e continue that streak this season.

Both are excellent atllletes and promise to play weU for Unicn this season. Now onto the: freshman. After watching the first game., it is clear that Coach Delventhal and tile Hockey staff deserve a lot (}f credit for their recruiting j.ab. Chris Sears who playe<l junior hockey with Jays&n Flowers scored his first Union g<>al Saturday playing on a line with Flowers and Albert. Union's Ryan Alaspa, who lllso got his first Union goal aga.inst Army, is a great addition of talent to . Union. Ala spa has played. junior hockey in :Marquette, Detroit, Kalam~zoo and Dubuque. Iowa and has competed against tile likes of Eric Lindros. Ryan was tile lOth leading SC()rer in tile United States Hock:ey Leag11e scoring 31 goals lUld 35 assists' in 4 7 games for Kalamaz<lo after already playing for t11e Detroit Junior Red Wings. Alaspa also scored 4 goals aiJd 8 assists in 9 playoff games for the Dubuque Saints. Scott Boyd, a former teammate of Goulet on the Calgary Royals of the Alberta Junior Hockey League, is a speedy defenseman who will add to tl1e defense. Boyd was named defememan ofl the year for Calgmy scoring 40 points in 55 games. Goulet helped .recruit his former teammate and Boyd played very well with Goulet in Union's opener. Reid Simonton, another defensernan from the Calgary area showed great ability against Army, and will add strength and excellent puck- handling to Union's defense. Brad Kukko's aggressi~-e style of offense and checking playing with Kevin Darby and Alex Vallee was another important factor Saturday night. Brad assisted on 2 goals against Army. Kukko played for the Thunder Bay Flyers and Vallee comes from the Wexford Raiders to Union. Jon MacDonald, Craig Provancal and Chris Hancock are the rest of the forwards. On defense. freshman Shane Holunga who scored 36 points for the Weyburn Red Wings of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League last year will play along side Steele. Shane played very well against Army in a game in which more spectators attended than live in nis home town of Snow Lake in Manitoba. Another major point of interest is the reunion of two of the three Darby brothers at Union. Well, it's not 1eally a reunion since brothers Keith and Kevin never actually played together in highschool. Keith and brother Craig Darby were linemates at Albany Academy, but Keith was still on the junior varsity team whe11 Kevin gradmated. Craig is now a star at Providence College of the H()ckt:y East division. Kevin tra11sferred to Unio11 from .AJmy and played very well against 'his old teammates scoring his first Union goal ill the third :period helping Union's comeback attempt. Kevin is a]u,nior but has only one year of elligibility left. As anyone who bothered to stay for Union's exciting 3rcl period comeback can see, this is a to11gh team with a lot of talent and guts. What they need now is support. Why is it that all of ollf le:ague wins carne ()II the ro-ad last year. Unfortunately, it because of the pressure the team feels at horne from fans wbo0 boo or leave the game or yell to switch goalies when we are down.

Come out and support Union Hockey! by John Schachnovsky 'Concbrdiensis Staff For those of you who read my article last year that was in full support of Magic Johnson. this article will seem a tad llypocritical. The past couple .of weeks the real Magic Johnson has shown his true f!lce to the American people, and I for one am appalled by what I have seen these days. Magic, as many of you know has the mv virus that causes AIDS. He had retired fmm basketball only to come back 1llis year for a whopping 14 million dollars. This past week amid rumblings from many' NBA players. Magic retired once again.

November 12, 1992, Page 19 by Dagan La Corte Assoc. Sports Editor I:t is fitting that this weeks Athlete of The Week is a member of the Rochester- playoff-spoiling Dutchmen football squad. Chad La Bonte is a junior running back on the Dutchmen football team. In last weeks outing against Rochester, La :Bonte scored both Dutchmen touchdowns. The passes which were 68 and 29-yards respectively accounted for all of Union's 14-points. Not only did LaBonte receive both touchdown passes, but he was also responsible for receiving seven of the nine passes completed by quarterback Scott Newton. Those passes added up to 124 of Union's totall65-passing yards. La Bonte is a third year varsity member from West Hartford Connecticut. DUTCHMEN AVENGE 1990 DEBT TO ROCHESTER by Dagan La Corte Assoc. Sports Editor The football season came to a close Saturday, as the Dutchmen were victorious over Rochester 14-10. By defeating the Y ellowjackets, the Dutchmen ended Rochester's undefeated season, as well as their post season hopes. The outing marked Union's third straight win under quarterback Scott Newton. Despite straight losses to Dickinson, Albany State, and RPI, Union came on strong in the past month to fmish the season with a record of6-3. Rochester took the lead in the first quarter on a 26- yard field goal. The Dutchmen came back in the second quarter when junior Chad La Bonte caught a 68-yard pass from quarterback Scott Newton. Rochester refused to let the Dutchmen get the better of them, as they regained the lead later in the quarter, on a 28-yard run by Yellowjacket Hurd. Union went into the · fourth quarter down 10-7. Early in the final quarter, Newton again connected with LaBonte, this time on a 29-. yard pass. The Dutchmen defense refused to let Rochester back into the game. Late in the fourth quarter Chris Trevisani picked off a Rochester pass. With 1:58left in the game, Rochester's hopes ·were ended when a pass intended for a Y ellowjacket receiver was picked off by defensive back Kevin Weedmark. Although the season didn't see Union's usual dominance, it did show that the team could come back after three straight losses to end the season on a high note. Water Polo Competes in Mid-Atlantic Championships by Lee Sehachter Staff Writer The Union water polo team recently qualified for the Mid-Atlantic Conference Water Polo Championships with a dazzling 5-1-1 record in the regular season. Union was therefore seeded second in the Northern Division for this postseason tournament, which took place at Kutztown State University. The tournament promised to be a challenging one indeed. The challenge began immediately upon arrival at Kutztown, whell tile team learned that their first competitor wa.s to be Georgetown University. On top of the difficulty of playing a big-name school in the first round, the team had to adjust to a different style of reffing by Southern Division referees- a stricter style in which more fouls and kickouts were called. Union had trouble adjusting early. The starters were Sven Zabka, Chris Yousey. Scott Bowden, Dave Robison, and Dave Lunianski, as well as freshman Seth Sealfon, who stepped up to take a starting position for the ftrst time. Out of the five experienced starters, only three remained at the end of the first half. Bowden and Yousey each got three quick kickouts and were ejected from the game. Union also set the League record for kickouts in the game with 16, as well as for the three-game tournament with 38. Union fought valiantly against Georgetown but was unable to come away with the victory. Union had beaten Colgate during the regular season but had a tougher time with them at Kutztown. So, after a close loss to Colgate, which, just as against Georgetown, involved many kickouts and a tough workout, the team was set to play against Kutztown. It was a close game, with the score staying in Union's favor for the first half of the game and then teetering back and forth during the second half. With the score tied at 14 with under a minute left in the game, Bowden scored to put the Dutchmen up 15-14. The defense and goalie Dmitri Konan held off Kutztown's last major offensive attempt to hold on to win by that score. This victory made Union sixth out of twenty teams in the Mid-Atlantic Conference for the season. This includes teams like Georgetown, Maryland, Virginia, and Penn. It was a very successful season overall, with strong defense all around being the most important reason. Other important factors were the goalscoring of Y ousey, SPORTS Swim Team Off to a Great Start by Lee Schacbter S~aff Writer This past weekend, Union's men's and women's swim teams each pat:ticipated in a relay meet held here at Union. There were seven teams in all on the men's side: Union, RPI, Hartwick, Coast Guard,. Albany, Vassar, and New Paltz. Coast G11ard did not send their wome11\s team, so Skidmore was the seventh team on the women\'s side. Both Union teams swam very well, especially for tllis early in the season, and the: results showed it. The men.,s team came in third as the women's team took first. The women's te~m was very impressive indeed. In seven different relay e\ents the women took first ill every single one, and tlien took third and fourth in tile one- meter diving with the two diving teams of Natash~ Zabka and Kristy Holbrook, 1t11d Lisa Hall and Amy Laoophere. Zabka and Holbrook took first in the three-meter coml)etition. With seven different e\ents and three to four swimmers in each event, the team dem()nstrated great upfront strength ~nd great depth in achieving first in every relay. Julie Ben:ker, Jenn Terrell, Liz McL~ughlin. Jonatha Meade, Jenn Allaire, Anne Rozwadowski, Kelly Bevan, Jenn Baldwin, and Natasha Zabka were e~tch part of at least two different winning relays. In :all, 14 different swimmers we:re part of a first place relay in this meet for the women's team. With eleven freshmen and only two seniors, Be11ker and Holbrook, on the tea.m this year, the women's swim team appears to be a very strong team that will keep ,getting stronger. There are two returning swimmers, :Benker ancf Bevan, who qualified for nationals last year. On: top of that, every returning swimmer on the team scored at the state championships last season. The returning swimmers are: Benker, Bevan, Terrell, Baldwin, Kristy Campbell. Holbrook, Rozwadowski, Zabka, and Erica Saltz. The freshmen are: Allaire, Jenn Davidson, Julie Davis., Hall, Eri Hayashi, Julie Ivartyi, Liz Kussy, Lamphere. McLaughlin, Meade, a11d Karen Peppiatt. Coach Bassett and the team are expecting that the mix of experienced vete~s and Lunianski, and Geoff Wolfe, the leadership of Sven Zabka and Dave Robison, Scott Bowden's sprinting. and passing, Dmitri Kanan's goaltending, and stmng help from the bench. Tln.nks to young, talented freshmen will be a winning combination throughout the season. The men's team swam a very fine meet as well. They finished third overall behind Coast Guard, which is not in Union's division. and Hartwick, last year's state champion. The success in this meet came, as it had with the women's team, from great upfront strength and also great depth. The A relays in every event averaged better than third place over the whole meet. This included nothing lower than a fourth place relay. The B relays took first in all of their relays except for two in which they took second. In the diving event, senior Dave Robison and sophomore Matt Baumgartner teamed up to take first place. Sixteen different swimmers, including seven freshmen, swam in at least one A relay. Most of the team swam better than they did at this time last year, and some swimmers swam faster than at any time last season. In an exclusive interview with Coach Bassett, I asked her which of the relays did best. She responded, \Well I think that.... they ali did great! .. That pretty much summed up the meet. The men's team seems to have gotten off to a very good start and with the lineup they've got for this season, it appears that it will only get better. There are only three seniors, Cliff Shaw, Sven Zabka, and Dave Robison, and nine freshmen: John Fitzgerald, Tsuyoshi (Kobi) Kobayashi, Martin Logan, Dave Lunianski, Chris Riley, Dave Saad, Brian Scholl. Seth Sealfon, and Matt Woodrow. The returning swimmers arc: Matt Baumgartner, Scott Bowden, James Ernst, Adam Horst. Bill Humphreys, Robbie Johnson, Luke Payne, Drew Pirich, Chip Quarrier, Joe Saltzbart, Lee Schachter, Adam Stein, Geoff Wolfe, and Chris Yousey. This is a much bigger and much improved team from last year, and it seems that each swimmer is multitalented. This team is prime for a great season. Both teams will start their respective dual meet seasons this weekend at Rochester. It promises to be an exciting beginning to a fantastic season. So if you see a swimmer on campus, be sure to wish him/her luck and remember to come on out and support the team all season long! coach Mark Walsh for giving support, direction, and good coaching to the team. Congratulations to the entire water polo team and good luck in the swim season!

Hockey Preview IIOCKEY By Hal Poret Co- Sports Editor Union's Skating Dutchmen opened their 1992-93 hockey se:ason on Saturday with a tomgh 6-5 loss to Army at A~hilles Rink. They have lost their 4th all-time leading scorer Craig Ferraro to graduation. Ferraro along with the five other graduating forwards accounted for 54 of the 82 goals scored by Union last season and were responsible for half of Union's 214 points. In addition, defenseman Greg Eccleston has left the team leaving only one senior, Captain Greg Steele. But for all of you who did not attend Union's home opener or did not stay past the first period, there i~ something you should lrnow: This is a very talented a11d gutsy team. This is only Union's second season in I>ivision I hockey and this yt\ar's freshman class is the fi.rst to be strictly recruited for Division I. Last year's squac managed three wins and a tie p1aying in a strange new world of hockey where the average a1:tendance viewing them jumped from 1516 to 2150 at lliome and 1008 to 2741 on the road, including crowds of 4000 ai Vermont and 3800 at RPI. B11t with the experience that much of the current team has te> share with a talented f1eshman class, the dutchmen a:re on their way to becoming a f~rce in the ECAC (though do not expect immediate res11lts). 1'o prepare you students for tllis season of Union hockey, liere is a summary of the points of interest on the team. Defensman Greg Steele has found himself thrust into a position of leadership, as the only senior on a very young team. Last year Steele had four points in 18 games on a team dominated by seniors, but his aggressive play and toughness in the comers on defense will help shore up a new and solid Union defense. Also returning from last year and playing on Union's first scoring line are Chris Albert and Jayson Flowers. Both come from Nepean, Odtario which also produced all-time Union scoring leader Terry Cambell and the third leading scorer Gil Egan. Albert led all freshman in scoring last season with 5 goals and 9 assists. Chris scored a short-handed goal and added 2 assists against Army. Flowers has scored 16 goals and 25 assists in his first two seasons. Both Albert and Flowers are returning bigger, stronger and faster than last year and it was evident in their play on Saturday. Jeff Jiampetti a tough, gritty scorer also returns after scoring 13 goals and 17 assists in his first 2 seasons at Union. With a year of Division I experience under their belts, these forwards along with returners Gary Edmands, Corey Holbrough, Keith Darby. Jon Quint and a much improved Steve Battiston will provide an aggressive offense while helping the new freshman to adjust. On defense, Dean Goulet returns after scoring 1 goal and assisting on 6 others last season. Goulet, an aggressive hard-hitting defenseman will be a leader on defense. In addition, Matt Kelley, a quick defender who motored through Army's an unassisted short handed had 5 points last year and was defense and shot the puck goal.

But Coach Delventhal is waiting for one to get hot and that goalie will probably get the nod to be the regular starter. Last season, Mike Gallant performed excellently for the most part, but had very bad luck. Gallant saved 42 of 45 shots in his · debut against Brown last season only to lose 3-1. Later in the season, Gallant kept Union in a tight 3-3 game against Brown on the road before giving up a powerplay goal with 1:31 remaining. Gallant, a butterfly style goal- tender, stopped 86.6 % of the shots he faced last year, and despite his record, performed very well. Luigi Villa, Union's stand-up goal-tender was also fabulous last season, and was the winning goal tender for .all of Union's victories. Villa saved 86.3% of the shots be faced last season and recorded wins at Dartmouth 2-1, at Cornell 6-4, and at home against non-league opponent Concordia 10 ... 3. Villa also shocked the Yale fans holding them to a 5-5 tie with Union.
