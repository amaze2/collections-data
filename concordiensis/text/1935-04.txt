Eisenbud, '35, in assembly Wednesday. The two hundred and fifty speak- ers he has heard during his college course, sa1d Mr. Eisenbud, have dea.lt with every subject imaginable, but speeches on the social order have become increasingly frequent and prominent. In view of the pres- ent economic situation such a trend is not astonishing, he added, for men have come to realize that the young-er generation will be most affected by any change which is to occur. It is astounding, he stated, that we have left unheeded the advice to \put aside our youth\ and turn to more serious activities in govern- ment and economics. Even The Concorcliensis, Mr. Eisenbud ac- cused, could not take time from \plaguing the honorary societies\ to attend to the \'less important' matter\ of participation in the na- tional student anti-war strike. A student organization which would keep the student in touch with the political and economic tendencies of the age is sorely needed, h·~ continued. By a waken- ing the student to the demands of the times, such a.n organization would accomplish much toward so- cial reform. The 1935 season has been the most active in recent years of the glee club owing to the efforts of Donald C. Hawkes, manager. In the past three months the c! ub has sung in Albany, Amsterdam, El- mira, Binghamton, Oneonta, Cort- land, Endicott, New York, Phila- delphia:, State College, Pa., and Pittsburgh, besides five radio ap- pearances, including one over a network embracing eight N. B. C. stations in the East and Middle West. In two weeks the club will give its last concerts of the year. It is scheduled to sing in Albany on April 27, and in Canajoharie the following night. a--- Installments on Tuition And Dormitory Rent Due Monday The third installment of tuition and dormitory rent is· due and should be paid at the Comptroller's office on Monday, April 15.

Four Spalding's Artistry PIe a ses Audience Violinist's Program Is Chosen· Well; Chorus Performance !Is .Sincere, Intelligent By TONY SHARPE We have just returned from the Spalding-Thursday Club Concert and want .to say first of all, for the benefit of the Civic Music Associa- ti~m. that we were more than pleased. We'd Uke to congratulate Mr. Spalding for not playing down to .Schenectady his program was ex· ceptiona1ly well-chosen. The a udi- ence's reaction was the usual thun-. derous applause although in thi.- case it was justified. It was tuo bad that the attendance was not larger but then, we suspect that they are all saving up :!!or a good wrestling match. 1t would be di.fficult fOl' us to ex- press a pr-eference as to Mr. Spald- ing's selections but we name Chaus- son's 'Poeme' simply because it gave us so much pleasure for so great a length of time. Ne~t would come the Ravel 'Piece en Forme d'Habanera' and then the Tartini Sonata. Even the encored, espe- cially the Brahms Intermezzo, were worthy of Mr. Spalding's genius and a credit to hi::; performance. Unlike so many violinists who are little more than technicians Mr. Spalding had a happy mixture of both facility and expression. His tone was smooth, hts technique without fault. His mutation notes were as clear and soft as a bell and his low notrs as dramatic and throbbing as a vox humana. It will he a long time, we fear, before we hear another such artist as Mr. Spalding. It is most refreshing to hear a violinist who seems to enjoy his work so thoroughly and more than profitable even to a concert· calloused audience like Schenec· tady. The Thursday Club need have no qualms about appearing with Spaldings since their creditable per- forrnll.nr<> !•lHN'' th..,m in th<' l1igh ..• THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, APRIL 12, 1:935 Prize Debate Contest Is Open to AH Classes D .. : r·.z·ver o.f D ...... · Nott's Three.- Wheeled• Colonel Green.

Gokhman, First Secre- tary of the Soviet Embassy at Washington. D. C., at dinner in the Hotel New \Ve~ton. For over three hours the group discussed infor- mally many phases of Soviet inter- nal and foreign policy. Extremely well informed and an intet·esting personality, Mt·. Gokhman gave the Union rep!Psentatives a multitude of suggestions and facts concerning the 1'\oviPt Union which enabled them later to intelligently present the Soviet viewpoint. Mr. Gokh- man consented to talk to the Union delegation at the invitation of Dr. Mooely, who wus a clo:;e friend of his while the latter was studying and teaching in Moscow a few years ago. Peace~Strilu'> The first plenary ::>ession of the Assembly on Friday morning was ch<:na·ctel\ized by an exciting move- ment for the adjoUI·nment of the Assembly so· that the delegates from the numerous colleges could parUcipate in the Anti- ·war strike tt Columbia G\nivetsity at 11 )'clock. The Union representatives were greatly opposed to such an action, and lead the opposition to defeat the motion. After a speech by Rankine Hinman'35, chairman of the Union delegation, the suggestion was voted down amid such ap- plause. The committee metings ·began at 2 o'clock Friday afternoon and terminated shortly after 5 o'clock. Here the representatives of the na- tions considered the following three problems: yorld economic planning in agriculture, limitation of the traf- fic in arms, and the revision of Article XVI of the League Covenant.

In reality, it is these that conscientious olJjectors must fight against. The menace of war lies in those that wish it, not so much iH the institution itse'lf. War never starts of its o\m accord, humans and nations start it. Wa1· is a menace only as long as there are those who deride its opponents and attempt to suppress them. The work of the students who aim to pre- serve peace should lie in the :direction of edu- cation. A ::; tudent strike is only an explosion, the effects of which do not last for any great length of time. The most logical way of pl'e· I set\Ving some part of its forc'e is by carrying on the campaign through the distribution of information, by using the same method-s as the jingoists.

High Percentage On Fliday last throughout the land, There gathered together a student band Who said that they would strike that day, And howled for peace in every way. Down with the capitalists, some cried, Who rr.ade us fight on the other side. We will not wage their dirty war..- As they shall dictate on foreign shores. The United States is self-sufficient, independent and most efficient. We need not trade with foreign sounds When the rest of the world with strife resounds. We have enough of corn and wheat .To give our people what they must eat; And with our enormous national wealth We can stand alone and keep in health. Tn ehort we all will refuse to battle When Mars' sword in its sheath may rattle Except to defend our own fair nation From aggressive wars and forQign invasion. So thus the youthful zealots ranted And cries for peace in chorus chanted, Fz·om soap boxes and assembly rostrums To tho:3e who came to drink in their nostrums. Now we are In accord for peace, And hope and pray that wars will cease. But we are for studying the implica- tions That arise from these bom-bastic demonstrations. Should we all swear we would not war Save against an ag-gressor to our own shore, Then ipso facto we of course im.ply During foreign war to stand pass- ively 'by And see our ships and national• destroyed, Or by embargoes make our com- merce void, Which we once did so with dis- astrous results In 1807 to avoid British insults. And since our then refusing their ;rage They took our trade bag and bag- gage. And this is one of the disastrous blows That comes when we let others ste-r: on our toes. By such a policy we would also con- fess We were unwilling to air our na- tionals' distress, Who might be a-broad in time of duress And suffer harm from our passive- ness. Thus for such reasons we are agreed That blindly following these paci· fists' lead Would entail our firm and strong support Of policies and ideas of a dangerous sort. MUSIC By TONY SHARPE Those of you who appreciate modern music must have enjoyed last Sunday's organ J'eeital. Even though the Stations of the Cross might have seemed too highbrow for a fit:st hearing, there was enough 'program' music to com- pensate for it. Not to be hig.hbrow, w:e thin-k that the Dupre numbers a·re some of the most magnificent things ever writ- cen for or,g-an. The Dukas and An- drienne numbers were our first hearing but we hope not our last. l'he organ never sounded better and neither did Dr. Tidrriarsh so the recital was the tops. We still remember the Thur-sday Club Concert with appropriate tingles, as the finest bit of cho1·al work we've heard in the Capitol district this yeat·-to say nothing of Mr. Spaulding, Grandpa Carnegie's ·gift has ar- rived and if we have to unpack many more records we're going to cUrn into a Plano Concerto our- self. We'd much rather be a Sym- phony, though. The new Capehart will do everything but gri-nd coffee and tried tci simulate that even by chewing· off hunks of Beethoven's ninth .at its premiere performance. However, at this writing things are well under control and the patient is on the road to recovery.

Middlesex Notes Friday's anti-war strike was quite satisfying to these of us who be- lieve that students in colleges can do something about the world's con- dition. The 125,000 students who struck, and the thousands of their sympathizers are laughed off now because of their youth, but in a very few years they will be voters and a force to reckon with. .. . . Borrowing rifles, machine guns and iight artillery from the ROTC, many Harvard students made fun of their more serious brethren in goose-stepping parades. Prominent in the agitation agRinst the strike was the Michael Collins Chowder and Marching club, formed to in- ject a spirit of levity into student affairs. But other colleges took it less lig-htly. Los An~<eles police beat up. accmding to the papers, two gil·ls, still in their 'teens, who had ventured to express their vpinions on wnr·. two more were ex- pelled from Hunter College, and some from the University of Chi- cag-o. The horrors that Sherwood Eddy reported take place in war can sometimes -be duplicated in peace time, it seems. * * * Our neighbor, Skidmore, took it all very seriously. They marched with posters decorated with such little sentiments as \Stiffle Rifles, Make Them Trifles\ all over Sara- toga, and they even wore them to dinner Friday night. * * * Americana-The Pennsylvania Birth Control Federation offering an award of fifty dollars to that class of Bryn Mawr College, which ten years after graduation has the most children per graduate. * * • Even poets are succumbing to the disastt·ous American habit of or- ganization.

SCP.~I'INIZING THE STRIKE Great derision from \patriots\ and \con- servatives\ gTeeted the student anti-war strikers upon their demonstration Friday.

George Clark seems to have about the best control of the three available, and it may be that Coach H .. tfield will give him the nod when the tim-e comes. On the other hand, Jim Loomis, also a veteran from 1934, has plenty of speed and has more than proved his wizardry against opposing batsmen in pra:c- tice sessions this spring. If he does not get the assignment, he will be seen in left field. Jim is doing some of the best hitting on the squad and it will take a cagey pitcher to slip one by Loomis. Guy Griswold who turned in an enviable record last year, is the third choice for pitcher. He will probably see some action on the mound though he is liable to concern himself mainly with the shortstop position. He bas taken longer than the others in rounding into form and is still quite erratic. He is a fairly good hitter, however, and is certain of being in the line-up. Besides McDowell in the outfield are Loomis and Captain Ralph Semerad, while AI Stevenson, with a year's experience behind him, will catch. Ralph has continued his heavy hitting and will be a perma- nent fixture in center field, while either Loomis or Griswold may b.e seen in left. Coach Hatfield also has Paul Ca~npbell, Ray Barbaga- letta, and Doug Lambeth to fill in the fielding post should the occa- sion arise.

An armed Germany menaces France and her inter-ests in Eastern Europe. Hence, M.

This small central Eu- ropean state under the Schussnig regime has boldly announced that 13he must have a larger army. Since the other nations have apparently not objected, Austria has revived a Hapsburg custom of having a day set aside for great military review. The precariooo situation of Austria next to Germany probably causes her some alarm. \ • * Soviet Union. The U. S. S. R. is u~doubte~lly for international peace. D1p!omat1C representativ.es have constantly advocated the making of the United States draft treaty for the control of arms more stringent. Recently France signed a security pac~ with the Soviet Union obvious- l;y- mmed at German .re-arming poli- mes.

The Book Corner By JAMES BREWSTER, Librarian The Union Collection (continued) FDllowing UJ comes the class which is probably the best known and the most used of any in the col- lection, UM, Student Publications. The earliest of these which we know about was the \Pastime edited by John Howard Payne in 1807. The llhrary has no copy of any of the issues; but Mr. Willis T. Hanson possesses the only known complete file. Many of these publi- cations like the \Floriad\ (1811) the three series of the \Parthenon'; (1832, 1847, 1851) and the \Union College Magazine\ (1860-1875) were of high literary character; but there were many others, generally published anonymously and dying after one or two issues . .After read- ing some of these it is quite under- standable why the editors did not give their names. Scurrilous is a mild description of some of these sheets. A favorite in-door sport of the students of the 1830's and 40's appears to have been to see how much dirt they could throw at rival factions, the fraternities and, of course, the faculty. semi-weekly and seven years later a weekly. Then for two years, 1916 and 1917, it was a tri-weekly; but this was evidently too often and after the war it became a semi- weekly. The files of this magazine reflect as. no other publication can, the changes which have taken place in college life during the last 58 years. The \Garnet\ was also founded in 1877 and has had a continuous ex- istence since that date. The first few number were published by the Senior Class and were quite modest volumes compared with the elabor- ate present day volumes. Sons of alumni get a big \kick\ out of look- ing through back numbers and see- ing what their fathers looked like in their undergraduate days. The photographs which made up such a large part of the \Garnet\ become with the passing years a pictorial history of the college.

At last u vote has been taken on the proposed changes in the nomination and election of the Student Council. Fol\ months the verbal fireworks which this question has aroused kept us awake at student body meet- ings. Even while the matte1· was buried in committee it was important enough to be the subj.ect of conversation. We are almost son·y now that it seems to be settled. Even 1Ir. Stroebel has failed us. He said, \No matter what happens, let's forget ab0ut it.\ The meeting yestm·day was notewm'thy for the complete absence of arg·uments on either side. To be sure, there were not very many arguments before, but the summariz- ing speeches of both factions had faded to mere opinion and half-hearted invective. 1\Ir. Stroebel said, \There is,\ and referred to autocrats. Mr. Semerad said \There isn't,\ and referred to demagogues. The battle seems to be won by the com- promise plan of reapportionment and closed, but more abundant, nominations. This plan received 138 votes to 116 for the propo-sed system of open direct election. But this is not a majority, for 28 cast their ballots for maintaining the status quo. Thus, with 282 votes cast, the leading plan was four voted short of a majority. J,egally to amend the constitution of the Student Council, a two-thirds vote of the council must be supported \by a majority of those present at a regular student body meeting.\ Of course, the 28 who voted to continue the present system would probably have favored the compromise plan rather than direct election. Technically, the question is not decided until another vote is taken between the two leading plans. Practically, this opens up an opportunity for Mr. Stroebel and his left wingers to rally their forces and perhaps to win. Over half the student body did not attend the meeting. Their votes are un- known. Will Mr. Stroebel \forget about it\? Or will he seize this technicality and demand another vote? Perhaps the fireworks ar.e not over yet.

Friday mom- ing in assembly members of the newly or- ganized Social Problems Forum took their constitutional right seriously and circulated among the students copies of a petition to the President of the United States request- ing that the naval maneuvers this summer not be held near Japan. At first glance the object of this petition seems to be a rather remote grievance for Union students to get excited about. Probably a lot of students think a naval manoeuver is some species of sea-serpent. We can readily understand students petitioning the dean for an extra holiday but to see some of them interested enough in a national problem to appeal to the President about it, is a rare spectacle in Union College. Like anything else that is new and dif- Goebbels also complimented der Feuhrel' on his masterly dialogue with the British peace salesmen, Simon and Eden. The Germans did not like that at first.

The response, according to News-Week, brought the most amusing copy that a metropolitan paper has printed in many a day. Ely Culbertson led the biggest bore contest, although by last Mon- day William Randolph Hearst had cut his lead to 28 votes. Nicholas Murray Butler stood third; Rudy Valee, fourth; and Barbara Hutton Mdivani, fifth. After-dinner speak- ers and social leaders caused trouble behind scenes. They pestered Post editors to keep their names out of the contest. Some time this week the bores will receive their :prizes. No. 1 will get a complete set of Gertrude Steins' works; No. 2, the \Combined An- nual Reports of the World War Foreign Debt -commission with Additional Information Regarding Foreign Debts Due the United States, for the Fiscal Years 1922- 1923-1924-1925 and 1926.\ Third prize: a s·econd hand copy of the 1925 Congressional Directory.

The depression has forced many factory owners to study every possible method of cutting costs. Two im- portant items in the operating ex- penses of a factory are power costs and taxes. As long as they saw no alternative, factory owners paid their share of the ever increasing tax burden, During the past few years owners have been studying the possibility of moving their plants to the coun- tt·y to take advantage of cheap sites and low taxes. Low cost power de- velopments have accelerated the movement to the country until at present the factory towns are frant- ically resisting a movement which has already developed an alarming momentum. Just as the workers fought a losing battle against the machine in the industrial revolu- tion, it may now be the plight of the city to see its most valuable elements caught up in relentless movement of industry to the cheap sites in all sections of the country In New England, textile factories have left their former locations in towns to find new sites in the less developed sections of the region. Some companies have moved their factories to cheaper sites in the southern states. Many .towns have taken steps to prevent the de- parture of industries by legislative action. Every student of engineering and industry should realize the serious- ness of the situation from the point of view of the city and should also study the reasons for industry's country-ward movement. If the government continues in its pro- gram of cheap power development, a rapidly increasing decentraliza- tion of industry can be expected, As long as there are real economies to be effected by moving factories from the city to the country, any efforts· of the towns to prevent such movement will be futile. It may be that the city will in this case pay the price of progress.

Both pitchers allowed but one -base on balls. Union Bunches Hits The heavy batting of the Union team started in the fifth frame when Brown reached first base on an error. Ernie had earlier smashed out a long triple but was left on the base when his team- mates failed to bring him home. Dave Cadwallader came through with a nice single to advance Brown to third, and then stole second when Galdrich, visiting shortstop, cut the invaders throw short to prevent Brown from scor- ing. AI Stevenson then cracked a timely double to center field to bring both Brown and Cadwal111.der home with the first Union runs of the 1935 campaign. The sixth in- ning also found runners on the :bases by virtue of Griswold's single and stolen base, to put the Garnet pitcher on second. He went to third on Jacobson's error and came home on Loomis' single through the infield. Loomis also stole second and advanced to third on Jacob- son's passed ball. He later came home on a long fly to left field by Ernie Brown to end Union's scor- ing for the day. Moser Hits Triple Stevens came baclt at the Dutch- men in the first of the sixth when Moser, visiting captain and center fielder who• had missed the train in Hoboken and was late for the game, made his first appearance against Griswold and greeted the Union hurler with a long triple to the fence in left center field. Stein- metz then came to the plate and scored the first run for the visitors by poling a long fly to center field which allowed Moser to score after the catch. Reichard singled but was put out while trying to steal se.cond, and Baksa popped to Fiore for the third out, quickly dispens- ing with the uprising. Grant Smith had little difficulty in taking .the high hurdles event and carne .back to repeat in the low hurdles. :Bill Endicott showed his heels t<J his competitors when he f.lashed ·down the 100-yard stretch in lO:G and finished the 220-yard dash in 24.6.

Jacobson went to second on a long fly to Loomis by Taranto, got to third on Gald- · rich's grounder to Reed and came home when Reed threw the ball over Clark's head allowing Gald- rich to go to second.

Car- roll, director of the Mountebanks and instructor in English, was ap- proved on April 23 by the Curricu- lum Committee, it was announced today by Dean Charles F. F. Garis. The course, listed as an upper-class elective, is scheduled to meet next year on Tuesday and Thursday aft- ernoons, 1:30 to 3:30, in the :Mounte- banks theatre. Officially the new course is de- scribed as follows: \A laboratory course in the interpretation of drama. Principles of acting, speak- ing voice, diction and bearing, di- recting, scene designing, stage light- ing and ·mechanics, make-up, and play-writing, taught by their prac- tical application in: the theatre. Attention will be directed toward historical as well as modern styles of dramatic presentati<m, illustrat- ed by plays given before invited audiences.\ Unique Type of Study The treatment of the course in play production will necessarily differ from that of other courses in the college. The course will take place on the stage, in the workshop, c r in whatever part of the Mounte- banks theatre that particular prob- lems require. The work will be undertaken with complete informality and will, in fact, consist of the sam.e sort of activity as is carried on by The Mountebanks. There will be three differences, however, said Mr. Car- roll, in an interview: Although emphasis will be given to the particular talents of the in- dividual student, he will be expected to become fantiliar with all the various departments of stage pro- duction, and the effective use of the speaking voice. He will try his hand at acting, directing, scene de- signing, painting, stage lighting, carpentry, make-up, and also play- writing.

Co unci I Sancticns Nomination System Plan Submitted for Insuring Student With College As Beneficiary The Loomis-Wa.ldron-Norlh nom- ination procedure, lacking hy four votes the requisite majority in its first consideration, received formal sanction and approval yesterday at a special meeting of the student body, and -was adopted immediately after by the Student Council with a two-thirds majority. This plan, which in addition to re- distributing nominations for the of- ficers to include twenty-four seniors fifteen juniors, and twelve sopho- mores, p10vidcs for the abolition of cm ryovets and the same re-appor- tionment as advocated by Stroebel. This new system of nominations will be inaugu1ated when the Stu- dent Council selects a slate for next years sopohmore, junior, and senior boards, supplanting the old ar- rangement that called for a class representation on a 10-3-2 basis. At the close of this meeting, Wil- liam vValdron announced that a plan had been submitted to the stu- council according to which the stu- dent body would insure one or more of its members chosen at random for a twenty year period with Un- ion College as the beneficiary. The premiums would be paid from the student tax, and the principal, when due, would be turned over to the college for whatever improvements might be necessary at the time. Waldron announced that this plan would be formally presented to the student body for discussion May 2. He asked that students consider the advisability of this action and. such details as the amount of insurance and number of policies necessary.

Mrs. Mortimer F. Sayre has pain ted out that the disappearance of this sign represents a substantial less to the College Women's Club who have gponsored the series of art exhibits throughout the year, and is of little value to its present possessor. \If some college boy has taken the sign for a prank,\ said Mrs. Sayre, \the club would deeply appreciate its return.\ \We were fortunate in getting se- cond class cabins,\ he said, \for many people were forced to return in the steerage.\ Aslted about his hobbies, Mr. Crowell said that if he had any it was hiking. He also likes tennis, although he ha.s .not played very much recently. As a place of resi- dence he prefers the country and liked especially Waynesburg, Penn- sylvania, which Is located in a rug- ged patt of that state, abounding in steep hills and deep vallles, and which was connected only by a narrow guage railroad with Wash- ington, Pennsylvania.

Sophomores In Vital l'osts The vital positions, ranging from fir;,t defense to second attack, on tbe field <ue caut:~:ng the Union mentor tl::e most worry. With a group of sophomoz e.s playing sev- eral of the central places on the :;quacl, t!te driving part of the team is weak. The inexperienced first and second defensemen, the center, a:.ld the first and second attackmen are as yet untried by many battles, Coach Harkness finds h<Jpe, how- ever, in .the thought that a squad is being built for next year that will ~ake for a strong lacrosse year at Union. Ken Tompltins, veteran of the frosh squad last year w.ho has shown improvement despite his in- experience, will prob8Jbly start as goalie tomorrow afternoon. Cra-bib Thomas, a newcomer to the squad this yq..r, will also see action in the cage, h'owever. Agius At Point At the point position will be Joe Agius, who is exnec;ted to turn in his best work on the lacrosse team this year. He wll fill the place left vacant by Sozz Waldron. McNaib will be his running mate at the cover-post. Dicl;; Kennedy, playing for his first year with the varsity, will be seen in the first defense place. His n:ate will be Don Liffiton, one of Union's ground gainers on the foo·t- ball te!Lm l~;~.st fall, at tile second de· fcnse post. Botll, men are new, but are coming players. Fraser, Veteran of Last l;ear Elliott Fraser, veteran of last year's campaign, will play center. Ken MacMurray will sta1t at the first attack position. At the second attack will be Hal Vandecar, small but shifty offensive man who play- ed with the yearlings in 1934, Two of t'1e strongest positions on the squad are being talten care of l;ly Jack .Smith and Hugo Bergman in the out-home a,nd in-home posts, respectively.

The follow- ing day he broke his own Western Conference record, made the day before, with a soaring heave of 161 ft. and 7% in. Amateur Champ Hawley and Wold Leading Frosh Tennis Candidates College champion Fritz Hawley and Johnny Wold are head and shoulders a:bove the rest of the field in the race for berths on the freshman: tennis team which opens its schedule on May 10 at Albany Academ)•. Stan Kollin and Bob Van Nutdstnmd have been showing the be<>t foun of the rest of the squad and will probably draw the other ~ingl£>s and doubles n~sign­ rn.cnt.> on the four-nJUn t\am of rucq uet-wiel der8. The form that Hawley and Wold have shown on both the indoor and outdoor courts has caused varsity mentor Bill Aydl'lotte to smile, for he is waitmg to have their ticr·vices ror the varsity campaign~ of 1936, 1937 and 1038. Of thP two player,;, vVold is perhaps the steadier and can be counted upon for more con- sLstent performance;;. On the other hant~ Hawley, who can hand any- one m college a lacing in five sets. has to overcome his fault of slow st.?-rting J:Jefore he can exepect to wm. :r_natches against really stiff op- poslbon. Both Wold and Hawley have played for several campaigns cgainst strong preparatory school netmen; the former played with Taft School and the latter with the Kent School aggregation. Kollin and Van Nordstrand, who are lacking in experience, have ideal frames for tennis players. Both are taller and more rangy than the two frosh stars, and with proper training can. easily develop Into outstanding court performers to support the Garnet's future ten- nis casts. They are: built solidly and have, like Hawley and Wold, plenty- of endurance. Five SOFTBALL RULES 1.

Ru~nne1s cannot leave base until baH has passed batter_ Times in the mile run and both the low and high hurdles have been low in the Garnet trials and Wil- liams should place one, two in all of these events. McVeigh shuffles around the oval in 4:41, which is enough to take the mile tomorrow. In the last time trials Brockwehl turned in his best time of the year when he finished slightly under 4:45. Hewitt wnl ·be the other Union miler while \Velles, and Chapman will run with McVeigh. The high hurdles will be another stumbling block for the home boys. Lamberton, hurdler extraordinary, has ·been setting a fast clip in both the lows and the highs. In the lat- ter he has broken the tape at 15.9. The best Clark Shields h!l.'l shown has been a little over 16.5. Joe Milano will also run in the low hurdle event with Mal Arny in the highs. a fine looking squad which he ex- pects will turn in a much better record than last year's men. Ralph Thatcher and Phil Little, two men who have had quite some experience on the .golf course are ranking men on the squad, h~ving made good records in the practice matches on the Mohawk course. Coach VVilford H. Ketz came to Union in H31 to take charge of the varsity t~·ack and eros~ country teams. During his first vear -in thi~ capacity the cross countt .. ,. team de- feated Colgate 23 to 32, R. P. I. 23 to 32, and C. 'C. N. Y. 15 to 40, In the Middle .Atlantic State Intercol- legiate meet the Union harriers took third place, Since this begin- ning Bill has :oeen turning out win- ning teams every year. At Soldiers' Field in Chicago, on June 9, he surpassed hi.s previous efforts with a heave of 163 ft. 8 in. in the National Collegiate Track and Field Championshipa to gain possession of the American Ama- teur record. At this time Coach Ketz was recognized as one of the leading hammer throwers in the country_ In Boston, on July 1, he qualified for the final Olympic try- out with a throw less than 160 feet. When J:;e performed this feat he was. Western Conference Champ, National Intercollegiate Champion, and holdei' of all hammer records at Michigan. Speaking of the re- sults of the final Olympic trials a Detroit paper states that \the big- gest upsets occurred in the ham- mer throw, which saw three favor- ites fail to qualify-Wright of Cor- nell, Eastern Intercollegiate Cham- pion; Wilford Ketz of Michigan, Big Ten Champion;-- Caskey, a former champ led the qualifiers with a heave of 162 ft. 9% in.\ UNION COLLEGE Basted() in Two-Mile Run Ed Bastedo, captain of next fall's cross country team, has an excel- lent chance to win the two-mile run. He has already cut more than ten seconds from his best time of last year. Gregory, Williams, has the best opportunity to defeat Bastedo. He has completed the distance in 10:26.6, six seconds slower than Bastedo. Gildo Mirate and: Bob North will complete the Union runmers while Stanwood and McVeigh will be entered for the Purple team. Prospects for taking four of the six field events seem to be in favor of Union. Leon Naguszewski, in the discus throw and shot put, has shown up well durin:g the past two weeks and should come through in one of the events. Chuck Krull and Joe Milano are also entered in these two phases of the track meet.

Olympie Prospect As the 1928 track season progress- ed Bill Ketz slowly built up an en- viable reputation. .As time for the Olympic tl'ials at Boston clrew near he was mentioned by leading papers as an Olympic prospect. In an exhibition at the Drake relays on April 28, he whirled the iron ball through the air for 158 feet 9 inches. During practice he was now reaching- over 160 feet. At the Ohio State meet on May 5, he set a new dual meet record with a heave of 160 feet 3% inches. This thi\OIV also outdistanced the Big '.fen :record. The following week the i1·usky Michigan fleldman threw the hammer 160 ft. lOin. in a meet with Jv.llnnesota for a new Ferry Field record. At the end of May, Bill travelled with a select group of his teammates to Evan- ston, Ill. to take part in the West- ern Confnrence Track and Field Meet. In the first days of compe- tition he brQJte a fifteen year record in the hatnmer throw by a mighty The trials were called for eleven in the morning but the officials had forgotten to brin!; a 1ape with them. Rain had left the field in poor condition and due to the large r.umber of entrees (more than thirty were at the trials) over an hour transpired between throws. It is not surprising that under such circumstances many of the leading hammer throwers in the country were unable to qualify. Receives Ca.ptaincy Bill's disappointment at failing to make the Olympic Team was molli- fied by being chosen to lead the 1929 Wolverine track team. During this season he continued to break records and with such m-en as Ed- die Tolan, sprint man deluxe, the Michigan team had a good season. Against Iowa, Ketz broke the only record of the day with a throw of 165 ft. 10 in. the longest throw he had made in competition up to this time, In the Minnesota Meet, be- sides winning the hammer, he heaved the javelin for 170 feet to take first in that event. At the Big Ten Conference Meet he was third in individual scoring. winning his .specialty, and also talting third in the javelin with a 177 ft. 9 in. throw. Upon graduation he became as- sistant to his former coach and also took up law at the Michigan Law School. Besides his activity on the track team, Bill was end on the football team, center on the quintet, pitched for the nine, and received his bachelor of law degree. Captain Mal Griffing will be un- able to take part in the meet to- morrow because of a pulled tendon · received during ·practice Tuesday. Mal Arny will enter the high jump and Van Wert the pole vault in Griffing's place. Emery Burton, jumping in both the high and pole vault, has the edge on Dissell and Ellis, star men of the William's team in these events. Burton has been clearing twelve feet consist- ently in the vault since he has change·d to a new hold and Coach Ketz is confident that he will reach thirteen feet before the ehd of the season. Hughes will also jump in the highs. Lamberton and Jack Bloom have the edge over the rest of the field in the javelin throw. Lamberton has put the shaft out an even hundred feet while Bloom has eclipsed this •bY four inches. Alex Brzostawski has been close behind Bloom all year and should place in the first three. Bloom, Burton, and Hirst are entered in the broad jump for Union with Anderson, Ballard, Robart and Dissell the eligible men for the visitors. Bloom has been plowing up the sawdust pit with jumps well over twenty feet and with first class competi- tion showed, •be able to increase his leaps.

Dr. Soclcman, in speaking on the subject \Moral::; in u Machme Age,\: gave four paradoxe:; to illustrate the point that while the machine. has made us more independent in spirit, it has made u:; increasingly interdependent in fact. Lessens Moral Control \The machine age has given us an emphasis on the machine control and a decreased emphasis on man's human or moral control.\ Before the introduction of mahines :man did not need much government or much religion, because man was the complete master of his own destiny, continued Dr. Sockman. The machine, while giving man more leisure time by performing most of his manual labor, also made it much harder for him to lead his· own life. A new economic en vi ron- ment which a man failed to recog· nize, soon led to \the rise of the machine and the fall of man.\ \The machine has made life easier physically, and by the same fact, harder morally.\ Man, not realizing the value of the study of literature and the fine arts, waster all of his new leisure time. Unlike the exhausted farmer or blacksmith of fifty years ago, man today comes home from work with an abund· ance of excess energy, which he futilely tries to burn in some pas· time, such as attending a movie. Once we learn to devote our leisur-e time to more worthwhile pursuits, we will see a much higher moral standard. Dr. Sockman said. Continuing his illustrations, Dr. Sockman stated \The machine age has given us larger social idealism and- less desire to practice it.\ !\iocial Separation \The machine has brought u.s. together physically and, ·bY the same fact, often further apart so- cially.\ The larger units of busi· ness and increased difficulty in de- veloping our sense of hone3ty and good fellowship tend to makr us ever ready to trick those whom we would not think of defrauding wrr~ we in personal contact with them. The very unifying forces of all the aids to closer communication have also made us more awat e of out· difference~ in economic, :;;ucial, .anu 1 racial levels. This iucnnu:;eu awate-1 ness ha., brought about tension, especially in thickly populated centers where many races and creeds are found. \Our greatest social task is o;ome- how to create a brotherhood sr>hit that can bridge these social chasm!;; i as the machine had bridged our geographical space,\ declared D1·. Sackman in conclusion. In sp~ak!ng of thC' \waywctnin.ess of youth,\ he said that it is in re- ality \a sort of mond awlHV<.liLl ne.ss: they have good impul~es but they have not been drilled into graceful or effpcti\\ <·XJ,r•'·\ion of them.\ -as they say at the Beaux Arts-just ?loin Red and Black down on the farm-Brick Reel and Black-in Higgins' American Drawing Inks.

Gage Assistant Issue Editors Norman Stewart Richal'd Passenger Tuesday, April 30, 1935 ON THE JOB The tax committee set a memorable prece- dent yesterday morning when they presented a questionnaire to the student body covering all phases of the tax situation. One of the potential evils of the present blanket tax arrangement is the possibility that a defunct activity may continue to re- ceive an appropriation out of all proportion to its usefulness, merely because of the inertia of the tax administrators. The appointment of a student tax com- mittee last year was the first step toward achieving a flexible, up-to--the-minute stu- dent tax. The questionnaire in student body meeting yeste1·day shows that the committee iR on the jou. A similar check-up of student opinion on tax allotments should be made every year.

The charge is substantially true. In most college gTaduates, the only visible result of their college education is a superficial polite- ne:ss (from the fraternity house), some fa- cility in subject matte1·, (from professors and textbooks), and the ability to make a little pre-digested thought go a long way This, say the reformers, is what our costly educational system is coming to I Colleges should instill Culture in their students! And they sit down amid dignified applause. But the speech makers do not stop to de- fine Culture very carefully.

Coming out from obscurity after three years, the team travelled to Clinton Saturday and returned with a 6 to 3 victory. Since the Hamil- tonians had a reputed strong team the long-waited victory of the Gar- net team was all the sweeter. Although Captain Bob Langer was the only veteran representing ·the 'Union team, they were success- ful in four of the six individual matches and took two of the three doubles. Captain Dick McGovern of the home team provided the most opposition for the visitors winning his individual match and then pair- ing with Sabine to defeat Langer and Art Sherin. Newcomers Make Good Three newcomers to the varsity tear.o made good in their first inter- collegiate match. Monroe Froelich, Ken Brown, and Phil Little won in both their individual games and in the foresomes. With these mm. ·to depend on for the remaind:lr of the season, Coach Phil Stanley has high hopes of making a showing good enough to erase forever the defeats of the past two years. Ralph Thatcher, another recruit to the team, lost a close match to Ed- wards, one up. He came back in the four-ball competition, howevc:Jr, and with Little defeated Edwards and Massoth, 2 and L Although par for the course was ~. McGovern was the only player to approach this low figure. He was the outstanding performer of the day 'by a number of strokes.

The end of the. last event gave the Purple team the victory by ten .points, the final score being 68'4 to 57%. Burton St:ai·s Emery Burton, versatile junior, took the scoring honors of the day by virtue of three first places. In the pole vault he smashed the old college record of 12 feet 3% inc~es with a vault of 12 ft. 1()1}2 in. Bur- ton continued his splendid perform- ance in the broad jump with a leap of 20 ft. 11 ~2 in. and called it a day when he· scored five more points in the high jump with the bar measuring 5 ft. Blh in. The visitors were too strong for the Garnet team in the low and· high hmdles taking one, two in both events. Clark Shields placed third for Union. Sherman Hirst came through in the 10(). and 200- yard dashes to take two seconds. Jack Glen was off with the gun in the latter event and came in a close third to Hirst. 440 Provides Thrill The quarter-mile run was proib- lbly the best race of the day. Vi Frye1· took the lead at tlle first turn closely followed by the rest of the field. At the second turn he was passed by Wood of Williams who kept the lead during the far stretch. Rounding the last turn Jack Ross came up on the outside and passed Wood at the last stretch. As Wood faltered for an instance Fryer came up on the 'inside and placed second behind Ross. Jerry Neumann ran a fast 880 and finish- ed in the fore with Wood and Ross behind him. Jerry stepped the half in 2:07.6.
