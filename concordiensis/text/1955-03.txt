An Unadvisable Switch lf the Faculty Council decision is put into effect, \Greek Week,\ better and more appt·opriately known as \Hell Week,\ will take place next year during the first week of the second semester. This move by the FacuHy Council was undoubtedly made With the best of motives; but when all factors involved are taken into consideration, we feel it was a poor one. The faculty has undoubtedly decided upon this change for the same reason that it has limited the time allowed for fonnal rushing to the beginning of the semester. With work just getting under way, and no exams to worry about, the feeHng is that if books have to be put aside for awhile, the beginning of the semester is the best time. We don't think, however, that the faculty has seriously con~;~idered the effects that this move would produce in crip- pling the pledge training program of most fraternHies. In time consjderation alone, five weeks cut out of the 15 weeks now available for pledge training is a tremendous reduction. Consider the effect a similar reduction on the length of a college semester would have. In addition, the national organ- ization of many fratemities requires a pledge period longer than a part of on-e semester. . . . And he s on five cut wattnlng! Tulips and Chimneys FRlDAY.

This move by the Faculty Council was undoubtedly made with the Lest of motives; but when all factors involved are tal<en into consideration, we feel it was a poor one. The faculty ha!'l undoubtedly decided U!Hlil this change for the same reason that it has limited the time al'lowed for formal rushing to tl1 e beginning of the semester. vYith work just getting under \.Yay, ami no exams to ·wmTy about, the feeling is that if books have to be put aside for awhile, the beginning of the seniester is the best time. We don't think, however. that the faculty has seriously considered the effects that this move would pl'Oduce in crip- pling the pledge training program of most fraternities. In time consideration alone, five weel<s cut out of the 15 weeks now available for plE'dge tl·aining is a tremendous reduction. Consider the effect a similar reduction on the length of a college semester would have.

So great was the departure in design of the new Bell System wire spring relay as com- pared with conventional relays that it posed a major undertaking for development en- gineers at Western Electric, the manufac- turing and s4pply unit of the Bell System. Indeed, il was an .undertaking that called for new m!lchines and n~w methods be- cause none was available to do the job. Longer life, higher operating speed, lower power consumption. and lower man- ufacturing cost were sonj.e .of the advan·· tages promised by the new relay design. Engineers reasoned that a lower manufac- • I. SUP.PLY MAGAZINE 2; CLIP WIRE EI>IDS 3. CONTACT TAPE SUPPlY 4. WELD CONTACTS 5. CONTACT TAPf SUPPW 6. DRIVE UNI.T '1, SIZE CONTACTS 8.

Single Wire Comb with Percussion Welded Contactr, Wire Spring Relay Designed. by Bell Telephcme Labqratoriils One of the products of this reasoning is pictured at the top of this page. This bat- .tery of equipment, developed by Western Electric product engineers, <;onstitutes one phase of wire spring relay manufacture, which automatically performs several separate op- erations. Its function begins after one of the fimda- mental. elements of the new relay has been fabri- cated. This element, known as a \comb \ consists of a multiplicity of small diamett)r wires i~ parallel ar- ray imbedded for part of their iength in molded phenol plastic. These molded elements, of which there are. two types used in the new relay, are delivered to this line .of machine tmits in magazines. By fully auto- rnat~c means they itre. removed fi'om the magazine, can1ed by a reciprocating conveyor through each· .of the several processes and, when completed\ p1aced into another magazine to aWait further as- sembly. BetWeen the first and final magazine the auto- matic battery of equipment does the following One type of \comb\ element is shown at top while a com\ pleted wire spring r(!lay is below. The small blocks of metal on the ends of the wires are cut from a ·composite tape dur- ing the al!lomatic n~ultiple perc1,1ssion welding operntion, \Contact conditions\ are determined by ·the code of relny being marmfact'/lrgd ami may vary greatly. operations: clips wire ends, attaches palladium con· tacts to Wire. ends by means of percussion welding; sizes contacts, forms terminal, tension bends wires,. fiuxe~;~ Clnd tins terminals. . .M;ost remarkable of all is the fact tbat tf:!js is a precision operation throughOut. For example, the smatl bide~ contacts, which are percussion welded to the tips of wires of one type. of '!comb;'' must be located on the same plane across the twelve co11 .. tact positions to within a tolerance ·of ± .00.2''.

Meister's letter,. printed elsewhere on this page; raises several questions in regard to the purposes and con- duct of \Greek Week.\ It is to be hoped that the two exam- ples he cites are not illustrative of a general campus rule. Whether universal or not, however, they do point out a theory prevalent among some houses: that extreme pressure of a physical and mental natu1·e is the only way to produce a class and fraternal spirit among their pledges. It seems strange that these groups adopt such techniques to do the same job that other houses accomplish simply, and just as effectively, through constructive work about the house and orientation meetings. If the cases Meister describes are com- mon, they best illustrate the need for strong regulation, pre- , ferably by the HPC, of \Greek Week,\ with the eventual aim being the direction of this misguided energy toward worthwhile campus and community projects.

I can !lissure you that no member of the Council is a sadistic dema~ gogue who derives pleasure from sitting in chapel with the power to punish a fellow student. In fact, as evidenced by Mr. Rocco's letter artd the comments of other Council members, the feelings are quite the opposite. The Student CounciPs wish was not to strike fear into the heart of each student, but rather to get him tn realize that he is do- ing something wrong. And in this I feel we were successful, as evi- denced by the amount of student feeling that has been aroused. It does not seem possible to me, t'hat once the men of our college realize they are unnecessarily breaking rules of common decency, they Wil!. continue· to do so. Respectfully yours; Alan G.

Toke a univenity-sponsored four via TWA lhis •ummer ana earn Full co//eg• credit wlii/e you lrav• I The necessity for facuL.. ~la1-y increases was again ~ey­ noted this week with the rise in tuition for the incoming Class of '59, and the adding of a $50 Incidental Fee to all student's expenses. Talk of late has centered on the possi- bilities of campus expansion to accommodate a future stu- dent body of 1200. In line with this idea, have come plans foe a new library, and eventually, a new arts building and dormitory. We think that the school is overstepping itself in even considering such plans. To make feasible what Presi- dent Davidson terms in his letter to the parents of Union students as \the best education which our American civiliza- tion can provide,\ it is necessary to maintain an excellent fac- ulty. This can only be done by paying these men wages in fine with their ability and needs. As such, raising the scale of our faculty's pay to levels in accord with schools whose equals we profess to be academically, is of the utmost im- portance. It transcends all needs for expansion, for what are shiny new buildings without the best minds to direct students thoughts in them. We strongly urge the Adminis~ tration and the Board of Trustees to t<:tke first things first, and consider those who teach us, before the places they teach us in. Some of the issues concerning which we should like to have stu- dent opinion are: <ll Intercollegiate program. The sports now included, too many or too few? Which ones would you add, or drop? The cali- ber of competition, satisfactory or not? Number of students partici- pating, too few or too many? ('2) Intramural program. What im- provements in sports offered, or in scheduiing? Would you favor add. ing a league of Class B intran:;>ural team;s in order to bring more stu- dents into the program? (3) Phys- icaJ education requirement. W'hat should its aims ·and methods be? Alnount of emp·hasis to be given to body-building, learning of athletic skills !and what ones?), apprecia- tion of sports a:s a spectator:'~tc. ~ Would you favor a second year of \carry-over\ sports (such as golf, tennis, badminton, handball; etc.) on a compuJsory basis?

Low all~inclusive prices with TWA's economical An Important Facet Though we may feel that we have won a partial victory in the controversy over chapels, the most important facet of the situation has yet to be settled. The so-called \spy system\ that only resulted in scapegoats is now a thing of the past, and Delphic moderation of Friday chapels promises better audience response, but the question of chapel quality remains to be settled. Ea1·Iier this year, the idea of abolish- ing chapel met a resounding veto. Thus we are presented with a structure that will be with us for some time to come, and it is only through the voicing of the many complaints that are heard on campus as to the nature of the programs, that we can hope to impl'Ove them. The attention given Pro- fessor Larrabee's talk this Tuesday was ample indication that Union students will respond to a worthwhile, if not challeng- ing, program. The complai~ts mentioned above, as o~tlined in a constructive manner, might well be made the subJect of an inquirv by a student-faculty committee which would pre- sent suggestions to the Administration as to a possible fu- ture path for the assembly system. If we are to have these weekday chapels, and a program of evening lectures, an area which has been unusually sparse this year, we should strive toward making them better. It must be remembered that it is possible to dial out a poor radio or television program, but there are only so mahy poor chapel programs that a student can dial out; bemore he faces a $10 fine. J.

For one answer, 31-year·old P. H. Alspach, Manager of Manufacturing Development at G.E., is exploring automation. Automation: Continuous Automatic: Production Automation is a way of manufactw'ing based on the continuous-flow concept. Products will be made, inspected, assembled, tested, and packaged by a series of integrated rna· chines in one uninterrupted flow. As industry evolves toward greater automation, more workmen will become skilled machine spe- cialists or maintenance experts able to con- trol complete systems. Phil Alspach and the men under him now draft layouts for automatic systems, tackle the engineering problem!! involved, design automation equipme;nt, and even build some. 23,000 College Graduates at G.E. This is a big and important job. Alspach was readied for it in a careful, step•by-step pro· gram of development. Like Alspach, each of G.E.'s 23,000 college-graduate employees is given his chance to grow, to find the work he does best, and to realize his full potential. For General Electric has long believed this: When fresh young minds are given freedom to make progress, e.verybody helle:fits- the individual, the company, and the country.

A Reluctant Farewell A twenty year era in Union's history slipped out of existence last Septembet· although no one knew it at the time. Freshman Camp will be remembered by more than 2,000 alumni, however, as the first highlight of their four years at Union. Almost against our will, we must agree that the administration has made the right move in ending the era. We sar \against our will\ because as participants in the camp program ourselves, we find it difficult to speak of it without a cet•tain degree ()f nostalgia. Objectively, however, we feel that certain desirable q1:1alities of Freshman Camp will be lost. The atmosphere of the camp cannot be recaptured. When a bunch of fellows grow to know each other in a sort of \back-woQds\ setting, a spirit is generated which cannot be matched at the college itself. Friendships are made with tent-mates which may prove permanent. The student be- comes associated with freshmen other than those in his im- mediate section of the dorm. Hazing- by upper class counsellors creates unity and class spirit. Talks with faculty members give the student an opportunity to meet his instructors on a basis of informality not attainable on the campus. Last, but hardly least, is the memorable trek up the 1\lount Everest of Lake George, Buck Mountain. On the other hand, the Teasons for elimination of the camp are valid. As enrollment increases and more students are una:ble to attend the camp, the camp vs. non-camp split in the freshman class will be exaggerated. It would be unfair to exclude any freshman who wants to attend. The Administration has made the right move in re- placing FI·eshman Camp with a positive orientation program. With a week's time to work in, we hope that much college lore will be included in the program. A college with an his- torical background as ricl1 as Union's has much to g·ain in passing on this tradition. Fresh men should also be familiar- ized with the campus itself, an opportunity not presented at Freshman Camp. We feel that class spirit will be cut down, but that school spirit will g1·ow. One feature of Freshman Camp which !'lhould be con- tinued is the upper class counsellor. No one can help a stu- dent get adjusted to college life as well as someone who is experiencing it himself. The ratio of one upperclassman to seven or eight freshmen should be maintained. Perhaps a counsellor could be given cha1·ge or a four room IJlock in the dorm, instead of a tent. An extra bed might even be put in one of the rooms for the counsellor. This would continue to make possible those before-bed bull sessions at which time a freshman picks up many small details a:IJout college life which later prove invaluable. Activity leaders would certainly play an even large1· pa1t in an on-campus orientation program than they do at Fresh- man Camp. The traditional Activities Smoker could take place during orientation. Perhaps a sp€cified time could be set aside, similar to the periods at Freshman Camp, devoted to familiarizing the entering classmen with the courses they will take, during which the freshmen could also visit the sev- eral activities they might be interested in. The possibility also exists of expanding fraternity tours to include all houses, instead of a sampling of them. Perhaps the biggest advantage of campus orientation is that all freshmen would be included in it, and all would have the opportunity to sta1i out on an equal basis. Fresh- man Camp will not soon be forgotten, but with proper organ- ization and planning, Orientation Week could prove a much greater asset in the long ru11. E. S. L. Faculty Salary Levels Take five of the wealthiest Ivy League colleges-Harvard, Ya1e, Cornell, Columbia, Pennsylvania. The average of the salaries they pay a ful1 professor is $10,000. (Harvard and Columbia pull t·he avera:ge up.) Take five ()f the natl()n's largest state universities ~ Illinois, Mich- igan, Wisc()nsin, Washington, Cali- fornia. The average of the salaries theY' pay a. full professor is $9,085. Take five well-known smaller col- leges, all of high aca<lemlc stand- ing-Garleton, Mills, Pomona, Reed; Wabash. The average of the salar- ies they pay a full profess()r is $6,385. by a special advisory committee, at least fifty, four-year, accredited colleges and universitiE's will be offered grants by the foundation t()wa.rd hi:g'her faculty ~:alarl€'5. De- pending on its own financial stand- ln:g, the selected school will be re- quired t() match each $1 from the foundation with $1, $2 or $3 in \new\ money raised from other sources. It may use the foundation money only as a pennant.>nt endow- ment-that is, only the interest may be spent on increasing salaries. The school may contribute its share either as an end()wment of its own or by equivalent cash outlays an- nually. Tulips and Chimneys By Edward Cloos, Jr. It doesn't take long to become old at . Union. Last year this column first occurred as an en- thttslastlc and somewhat radical venttlre. We fostered. \avant garde\ intellectualism, and even tried to be at least a. sl!ep ahead ·Of campus mental somnambulism ourself, it Vloa.s, alas, to no avail. Now we, poor self, grow old and 1•eactionary too. We r:evolted against much of our Great Heritage, and generally seemed nothing to like; but the future lool,ed encouraging-it does still, .but it seems so very far away. Now we find ourself reac- tionary. New buildings, grand ath- letics rubble removal, and indi- vidual new custorrs all meet 'VIith our disapproval. Though the plan for a New Library is as imagin- ative as Jules Verne'·s farn()US boat, we think it is all practical a.s a sub- way to Skidmore-or even Jess likely, the Nott Memorial library. We've shed our last tear over ''Dutchrn~n·s Villa's'' demise, an·d the colossus called Field House is much too .big for us to comment on. We've given up. Hence forth we shalt ·but .comment on our won- der of the extraordinary projects \hich are certain to follow so bold a beginning, Make no mistal!e about it, w·e were prepared for almost anything when \Ve first come to Union; the \avant garde\ admissions office \as responsible for this. Almost anything, but not quite. Who could ever dream he might see a \new tradition'• founded a:t a great old school? Thrilling! We, humbly and sincerely, offer up our last dollar in tribute to the Second Annual Tuition Increase. Though It mode.Stly masks itself as an \lnc.idental Fee,\ it Is a tuition inc:r.ease In the classic manner of mo:n,ey. We think that this is a good solution to the pro'blem of ob- taining good young teachers. If the students IV>'•ant teachers, then they should be the ones to pay. We have fewer than 100 trustees and these are essentially very busy people; there seems no reason 1why they sho\lld be ~;~.sked to raise money from 'the obscure places othet' · colleges d() when our cao::•pus is brimming with wealthy students who have ever longed to do more to support the school. 'rhis is an efficient and realistic approach. lt is much more dl..fficult to incr.ease the return from the endo·wment than it is to increase the :tuition. It Is a waste of time to do tl).ipg~ the more difficu.lt way for time is money anc:l so time wasted is money wasted and money wasted is a tuiti()n increase. Despite the many virtues of the plan, It has one serious dmwlnuc.k; if the current policy of increMing .tuition by one half ()f the previous Increase Is maintained then it will theoretically be possL'ble to reach an Increase of $200. This puzzles rr.e. An dncrease of say $3.13 such as we would have in a very few years from no-w seems ()f very little value, but to upset the new tra\11- tion would be even more unthink- able. On the other hand, if the concurrent plan of Increasing tuition for entering freshzr: an by $100 is continued-and this seems the more practical, for :upperclass increases ·will shrink smaller than the p~nny-and assuming the col- lege 'is good for at least another 160 years, it is easily seen that the tuition o-f freshmen would be over 16 thousand dollars. This may be high, even for Union. This column ·has no solution, :we rwere just won- dering. On Council Affairs By George Zervas I am writing this coiumn, partly at the request of the Concordiensis editor to inform the student body of the business the Student Coun- cil is transacting, and partly to :pre- sent our viewpoint on the recent chapel contro\·ersy. I believe that much of the indignation which has ari:st'n is d.U<' to lack of understand- wg or wformatlon as to VI hat the puqw:;es and objectives of the Stu· dent Council are. The Student Council is the voice of the student body of Union. Its job is to present the wishes and dt.>mands of the student body to the faculty and administra~ion of the college. An accompanymg re- sponsibility of tl'ie Council is to main ta:in • student morale, tradi- tions, and conduct. Because of the increasing deterioration of conduct in .chapel .to'ilmd the end ()f last semester, the Council deci?ed to take action and came Up· wrth .the greatly criticized plan fo~ punrsb- i ng objectionable beha.vror. The Council's action may not have been the best solution to the problem, but at least it recognized the situ~ ation and took soo:•e steps to cor- rect it. The problem. was brought to the attention of everyone con- cerned. Thanks to Professor Sven Peterson, a more reasonable solu- tion has been reached. The re- sponsibHity is n<Yw placed squarely upon the student. Now the chapel markers may withhold credits at theil' discretion, a much more mat- ture approach to the problem. Furthermore, Student Council mem- bers are relieved from acting as \spies Now students 'Will team they have had credits withheld when credit lists are posted. At any rate the problem has been ·re- cognized and machinery set up to punish flagrant offenders. The stndent ·body is to be compli· rnented for its vastly improved con- duct this semester, whether the reason is a better quality of pro- grams, Concordiensis publicity, or Stndent Council action. The job ahead of the Council is to insure the continuation of a variety ()f In- teresting, improved chapel pro- grams. Any suggestions in this di- reatlon will be appreciated. · non-member schools in the area. The Council will discuss the p()S- $ibitity of joining the NSA at its ,next meeting. The most cuxrent problem before the Student Council Is a revision of the election system so as to en- courage a greater turnout of voters and to encourage more interest in student government. The admlnis- t.ratlon places a great deal of re- sponsibility upon the student body here at Union. The best way to maintain this confidence is by electing students who are sincerely Interested in effective student gov- ernment. The Election Como:1ttee of the Student Council is .consider- ing various plans sueh as introduc- tion of candidates to their respec- tive classes In separate chapel pro- grarr: s, a special election issue of the ConC<lrdlensis, speeches by can- didates ()Ver WRUC, and un1imited publicity facilities. As a first step I should like to invite any student!! interested hi running for next year's Student Council to attend any and all of the remaining Coun- cil meetings before elections. Class officer elections will be held the first ·week follo.wing Spring Vaca- tion, and Student Council elections the second. Theref()re any inter- ested students should attend to see how the Council operates and per- haps get ideas on improving t:~tu­ dent government. In the following weeks I shall attempt to outline the main accom- plishments of the .Student Council this year, and its plans for the ba!, ance of the semester. HOIW>ever, no student government can ·be effec- tive !Without the cooperation and backing of the student body. If there Is something you 'WIOUld lik:e to see the Council undertake, bring it to the attention of one of your c)a.ss representatives or come to the meetings yourself. The Coun- cil's only excuse for existence is to -carry out the wi11 _of the majority of the student body.

We think that this is a good solution to the proolem of ob- taining good young teachers. If the students \\ant teachers, thr>n the1' should be the ones to pay. we· have fewer than 100 trustees and these arc essentially very busy pt•ople; there seems no reason \\hy thev should be asked to Iaise mo~ey from the obscure places other college; do \\·hen our can pus is IJrimming with wealthy studt:nts \\ ho have L'Yer longed to do more to support the school. This is an pffieient and l'Nllistic ap!'roach. It is n .uch n ore difficult to increase the return from the E'ndo·\\ ment than it is to increase the tuition. It is a \\ astc of time to do things the more difl'icu'lt '\\·ay for time is monE'Y and so time \\ asted is mone}· \'astt'd and nwney wasted 1s a tuition increase. Dl'~pite the many virtues of the plan. It has one serious drawback; if the current policy of incrl!asing tuition by one half of the previous inL'l'PRSP is maintained then it \'ill theoretically be possible to reach an increase of $200. This puzz1Ps n e. An incrl,ase of say $3.13 such as Wp \'ould have in a very few vears from ne>w seems of ve1-y little ~·alue, but to upset the new tradi- tion would be even more unthlnk- a'ble. On the other hand, if the c<lncurrenl plcl.n of Increasing tuition for pntPrlng freshn an by $100 is continued- and this seen.s thl' more practical, for upperclass increases will shrink smaller than the ).;enny and assuming the col- lege is good for at least another 160 year·~. it Is easily seE'n that the \'\',•. humulr and sinct>tel~·. offpr tuition of freshmen would be over up uur last dollar m tnbute to the• 16 thousand dollars.

Mr. Jones is quite convincing in ihis portrayal of the simple yet sharp-eyed janHor.

For example ... w·hen a new teal estate develo?ment is in the planning stage, Jim fi.gures how much tele· phone equipment it will need when it reaches its full growth. His esti- mate is based on his knowledge of the equipment's potential plus fore- casts provided him o:f the area's rate of development. He then makes a . complete report that becomes the basis of plans for the future .. Jim can take a look at his own future, too. In telephone eugineering he can see a great many opportunities opening up in the next five years ..• ten years. He can pick the one he wants and start working toward it. Jim gt•a•luated from Northwestern University as an E~E., class of 1952. His progress since then is typical of college men who have chosen telephome cat•eers.

4 Variety Of Ails Produced Daily In College Infirmary By Michael Pincus How many students get sick at Union? Well, last yea.:r, feur thousand and five (yes, 4,005) people made use of the College Infirmary on the second floor of Silliman Hall. The fact that quite a few people• have coine down with the topic, why doesn~t some campus typical wilater colds and oth- activity try to round up a television • · . ' t d set? There's very ·little to do in ers w1th th~ Vl~Us, promp ~ the Infh·mary. the Concordiensrs to look aht- I.f you should ever have an emer- tle further into the situation .. gency case, try calling the Infirm- The present ••proprietor\ is Dr. Robert L. Raleigh, the third fuJlc time physician to bP. employed by Union. Chief room-renter is Mrs. Eleanor Sarnacki, . a very nice woman whom most of us have met at one time or another since at ye olde Union. Of courst>, there are the part-time desk clerks - stu-· dents who stay overnight or over- weekend, depending - Webb Tay- lor, Ed Konis, Ron Stevens, and Frank Micarell!. Part-Time Doctors Before January of 1947, there was no real Infirmary at Union. The two part-time doctors - Drs. Clowe and Rourke - used the Trophy Room in the Gym for their office. There were no beds, so if you happened to be sick, you. had to use your own bed. At the be- ginning of 1947, the Administration broke down and turned the present space over to Dr. Wagner, a full time physician. After he left, Dr. Clowe returned, along with a Dr. H)lmphrey, again as part-time men. Dr. Arony, who. left last year, was the second full-time doctor, and Dr. Raleigh is the third. At present, the Infirmary con- tains seven very comfortable hos- pital beds - the kind that jack up at either end. It is very well equipped, not only with pills, but with a great variety of large, threatening machines. There are plans for a face-lifting over the summer to provide better service. This reporter, after a six-day stay t:here this year, has only one com- plaint to register - other than 'getting bored. The food is sent up from the Weost College Cafeteria, and by the time it reaches the pa- tients, it is not very warm. Per- haps the new plans provide a solu- tion for this problem. This year, about fifty people a day go to the Infirmary for various rE.'a;sons. To date, there have been sixty-four bed patients, including four appendix cases. There is no set requirement to bt• put in bed, so no advice ca.n be given if you want a rest. Before you can be re- leased, however, you must have a normal temperature for twenty-four hours. Re-cently, there has bcc!l an epidemic of the \virus which varies from gastric to hEad. This same \disease\ forced the shut- down of rr.a.n:v schools In the Syra- cuse area earlier this year. ''I Want An ExeuseH Mrs. Samacki, who has been with the Infirmary since 1946, told your reporter that the most common· complaint of the students is, \I want an excuse!\ However, it is not as easy as that. The rules state that you must call in before you miss you1· class, and that you must go to the InfirmaTy for a cheek-up, if pos:siUe. Both the doctor and the nurse feel that al- most any case that is bad enough to remain in bed belongs in the Infirmary. On the whole, accord- ing to Mrs. Sa.rnacki, everyone is pretty good about reporting in. Perhaps the most interesting tim>e is the four or five days sunound- ing Prom Weekends. All day Fri- day and Saturday, the Infirmary Is empty. Come Monday morning, however, the place Is flooded with students with gastric-alcoholic \dis- eases,\-hangovers to use the lay- man's language. Incidentally, such an illneSs is not honored, for rather • obvious rea;sons. I If this reporter may draw on his own experience for a few lines, he suggests that everybody visit ' friends or even casual acquaint- ances when the latter are bed rid- I den. It can get awfully lonesome in there. And while on the same ary fkst. If Dr. Raleigh cannot be reached, the night attendant wil) recommend a local doctor, or will call Ellis to warn them that you are going there. Students are on duty every nig'ht from five \Inti! eLght the next morning. And on weekends, a student is there fro-m. one o'clock Saturday afternoon un- til the following Monday morning.

It has always been the desire of the Campus Chest committee to al· low any student to designate where his gift should be given. Last year $110 were allocated by special re- quest. The size of the student donations varied from il to $10.· The average donation was about $2.15 with only 370 studt>nts ·parti- cipating In the fund raising. In ad- dition to student gifts, the fac\Uity contributed a sizeable sum to bring. the entire 1954 total up to $1156. Intramural Director Art Law- rence announced that a swim- ming meet will be held on March 24th and 25th, the re-sults of which will count in the final intramural standings.
