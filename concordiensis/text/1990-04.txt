CONCORDJENSJS, April 19, 1990 Page 3 Phi Gamma Delta Put On Social Probation By MATT LANNI On April 13, 1990, Dean Alford b.eld a meeting with the president of Phi Gamma Delta, Jay Freeland, and announced that Phi Gamma Delta was to be put on social probation effective April 16. The social probation is nonreviewable, and will last until the second week of fall term. It wiU only be lifted after a review that \will consider whether you [Phi Gamma Delta] have lived up to tltc terms of probation-- no social events with alcohol-- and wb.ether you made it a priority to encourage prudent and legal use of alcohol, both among brothers and the community at large.\ In a letter given to Freelanl\l during the meeting, two causes were cited for the probation. First, someone from Physical Plant saw students unloading kegs from a student activities van at 8:30 a.m. April 11; and secondly, it was done while Phi Gamma Delta was already on a two-week probation for having an um:egistered party during winter term. \A group of 21-year-olds coHected money to buy kegs for themselves,\ explains Freeland of the incident. \The group used the van and deceived the administration by saying that they were using the van to move a couch.\ Union Hosts Research Conference Continued from page 1 in the arts, engineering, the humanities, mathematics and computer science, management and business, natural sciences, and social sciences. research on the computer generation and display of fractals at IBM, on \The Fractal Cosmos: From Obscure Mathematical Monsters to Mountains and Music\ at 2 p.m. on April 20 in Memorial Chapel; The main speakers will be as follows: --Juan Williams, ,writer for The Washington Post Magazine and author of the PBS documentary \Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years, 1954-1965,\ on \Eyes on the Prize: Civil Rights Right Now\ at 7 p.m. on April 20 at Desmond Americana, Colonie; --Helen Caldicott, pedia- trician, author and former president of Physicians for Social Responsibility, oa \Prescription for an Ailing Planet\ at 11 a.m. April 19 in Memorial Chapel; --Roald Hoffmanp the John A.

Survey Yields Disturbing Results By ANDREW SEEWALD Editor-in- Chief and MICHAEL SILB ER'TSTEIN Even at one of the most highly competitive colleges in the United States, students are paying little attention to the world around them. This was the finding of a Concordiensis telephone survey cond11cted this week. So, at a time when the rest of the world is reaching new heights in political awareness and activism~ the students of Union Colleg~ appear to be regressing. For most of its history, the United States could thrive even while in isolation from the rest of the world, but the growing perception now is that success without world integration is impossible. F()r almost aU of the survey que:stions, most of the respondent~ could not name prominent leaders of either the .. United States or foreign countries. For example, only 29% could name James Baker as the Secretary of State. This is especially disturbing because not llnly was Baker part of the Reagan administraLion, but he also managed President Bush's election campaign. Addition- ally. Baker has remained in the news while visiting nations that have undergone great changes in recent times. Ninety-three pefcent named Margaret Thatcheras the Prime Min.ister of England but, closer to :home, only 12% could iderntify Brian Mwlroney as the Prirnc Minsitcr of Canada. This, despite Mr. Bush's recent meetings with Mr. Mulroney .. Pctrllaps evoen more disappointing i:s that 41% cotild not name Fidel Castro, wh10 has been ill his position for three decades .as the dictator of Cuba. DUEtoNCUR In reaction to the survey, one professor in the political science department at Union said that the lack of awareness in tile United States was dangerous and would ultimately prove costly. He did nut express surprise at the results, and said that if most Americans were given blank maps of the world, they would not be able to fill in the names of 20 counlries. The professor also said that in a country like the Soviet Union, where there is a great thirst for political freedom and information, most students probably have greater know- ledge of world politics than their American counterparts, this despite being deprived of such information for a long time. More detailed results of the survey will be reported in next week's edition of Concordiensis.

John Secretary of State Gail S. Shaffer has urged .college students who will be spending their summer vacation at home to consider participating in the Department of State's ombudsman intership in the program's regional office in Albany. Interns may earn possible credits for helping Secr.etary Shaffer's regional repre- sentatives administer Governor Cuomo's Ombudsman Program across the state. The program, initiated by executive order in 1983, helps citizens with questions or problems they're having with state govetrunent. Such assistance includes handling telephone inquiries, making contact with state agencies on the client's behalf, preparation of draft respqnses to letters referred for state agency follow-ups, research and occasional on -site inSJ)CCtions. They will also work closely with the offices of the governor, and secretary of state researching issues, planning speakers, organizing com- munity outreach progra1ns an\! participating in a speaker and training series. Shaffer especially urged parents of students attending school out of town to alert their children about the upcoming opportunity. \Since · the_ internships are part time, students can earn credits and still hold a payi11g job,\ Shaffer noted. Students, or their parents, interested in learning more about internship availabilities may call either the local office in Alpany at (518) 473-7290, or the toll~free ombudsman hotline at 1-800-828-2338. group.

Page 6 CONCOR~l.ENSJS, April l!J~ 1990 FEATURES Forty-Eight H,ours A Day RJ CARL R. FRIEDRICH, JR I just cracked open a new pencil from a new box in my desk drawer. You've got to have extra, just in case. In my case, there are about twenty or so. Behind me, Ted Koppel just introduced the theme of the night-\Prcnatal Care For Babies,\ or lack thereof. A documentary, if I know Ted Koppel, which will undoubted- ly make the nighunare of abortion seem almost feasible. Almost. I wasn't going to drink tonight, but now I'm glad I did. Wilose kidding whom? Third night in the last four I think, but at least tonight I can hold the pencil. I've got this neat bottle of a '66 wine which is slowly gaining that 'Bohemian Look,' caked in varying shades of wax. Someday some girl might see the boule, m1d think it's pretty cool, aft~r I take her to dinner. But whose kidding whom? I'm almost glad I bypassed the 'social hub' tonight, and sauced all alone. All too ridiculous, as I didn't have the courage to even pretend for all the fading hopefuls, not tonight. All the while, on T.V., that great information somrce, a woman just gave birth, high on crack. Miscr;tblc peasants.

Mr. Mihalyi said that he~ · along with many otter intellectuals and . writers, initially supported the Communist party ih F{ungary,. a11d shared its ideological commitment to eq_uality am<Jng a:l1 classes of people. Howe\er when the leadership began to construct the framework of the emerging Communist state, it became clear to Mr. Mihalyi and other intellectuals tlla:t Hungary would fall far short of achieving eq11ality. 'The: Communist leadership. instead. was suspending their country along the road to tilat ideological goal:, claiming that a dictatorship, and its tool of censorship, were necessary for a time to make 'the transition to full equality .. Mr. Millalyi said he and his fellow writers experienced a strong sense of Take Back The Night D . . ' the Communist. state contrasted so sharply with its earlier rhetoric. Many talented writers, Mr. Mihaly! said. were forced to take jqbs writing propaganda .for the state; or else. these ·positions were so lucrative that many promising poets and fiction writers gave up their art in exchange for economic and social security. Mr. Mihalyi said that in es$ence, he was only lucky :to avoid being. pressed into this kind of service, which forced writers to say what they did not believe. The Communist government, bowing to popular demand, did allow some works of literature to escape the censor and be published on a small scale; often 5()0 copies or fewer would be printed. A miniature, half-underground society of intellectuals survived, and its membership cards were the recent, uncensored works of art published by the government and certain private presses. However, Mr. Mihalyi felt that the regime still silenced most artists in Hungary, as in all other Communist ·countries, and that li~rature has suffered a loss which cannot be repaired.

Unfortunately, this newspaper will have to take the place of most of the students here who have taken the break from classes as a chance to getaway. Many have left simply because they did not feel invited to remain. One administrator is reported tCJ having encouraged Union students to graciously excuse themselves; their company is not wanted, thank you very much. It is not as if this administrator was betraying a great secret. In fact it seemed as if the conference was what was bei11g kept a secret. One would have imagined that the publicity commensurate to such a prestigious gathering would have been overwhelming to the point of :nausea. The only invitation Union students were given t{) attend the seminars came in our mailboxes last week, and they bad the appearance of obligatory tokens half meant to remind us to verify our travel arrangements. So to th.:>se of you who are visiting the campus, here's hoping you enjoy yourself and requesting you to t$e some notes and leave them behind so that we can find ·out what we missed. while we were away. Get Up, Stand Up!!· To the members of the student body: F'ot the past four years Union College has been neglecting the rights of the student body. Decisions have ~n made without ~gard to the student interests and wants ·and we, as the members of the Union eommunity, have not made a sound. Tme, there is a Student Govemm.ent, the Inter- Fraternity Council and Panhellenic Council whQ try 1D protect the interests of· the students; and yet, there has been minimal response from the administration. It is time that we, as a solid student body, raise our voices to let the administtation understand what is happening to our college. As students, we are the heart and soul of Union. We entrust our present resources and future success to the well-being of our college;.-' We receive an education, both in and out of the classroom which we trust is worth our commitment. Therefore, we have the right and must take an active part in decisions placed upon us, as the beneficiaries of a Union degree. Our credentials begin here! Why do we quietly sit back and complain amongst friends when our Camp Union is snatched away from us? There is no denying that the Spring Fling turned into a beer fest, but to take it away from us with no compromise, is simply the administration acting as a dictatorship. There was no discussion for compromise or an attempt by the administration and student body w come to a realistic plan to curb drinking at the long standing event. It was snatched away from us, placed in the books as a memory, and it's gone. Why do we not take an active role wh:en the administration decides to remove Delta Chi, Delta Upsilon, and Beta Theta Pi from Union grounds? True, the brothers of Delta Chi attempted to gain Letters to the Editor do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the Edito1lal Board. All Letters To The Editor Must Be Typed,. Double Spaced' And Submitted To The Concordiensis Office by 4:00 P.M. On The Tuesday Preceding Weekly Issuance ef Concordiensis. Anonymous Letters And Those Over Five Hundred Words Will Not Be Accepted. g.rounds w··it·II the administration by ob~ning over 1,000 signatures from the students in an effort to sway the administration. The administtation tumed.a deaf ear. Furthermore, Delta Chi was removed from Raymond House so tha1 the administration could move more people into the dorms. Yet, this year, Raymond I!ouse is under balf filled, and . many of the residents were unhappy living there. Similarly, the administration is removing Beta for reasons that were, in large put, the fault of the administration themselves. Finally. Delta Upsilon's attempt at purchasing a House off campus was 'halted when the administration undennined the .sale and purchased the house themselves. Why do we not make a sound when the administration organizes· registraticn which makes it many times - impossible for Seniors to gain the courses required for graduation? Why do w~remain quiet when there is n() parking for the student body and ridiculous yellow tickets are placed on our cars? Why do we sit in. classrooms which are many times poorly ventilated? Why do we sit in a :sterile college center with nc name? Why are we being forced to find '\altemaUl sooial aotivides\ when nooe are being offered by the school? (One can only play .so much Arkanoid .• ) Why do we tolerate the administration's · lack of ~ction concerning the needs and concerns of the minority studentS? The list could go ·on. I am sure that there are various complaints that each individual has for the school. Yet, we have neglected to take advantage of the representative bodies that are-offered to us and student needs and. rights have gone virtually unnoticed. It is ti111e that we raise our voices and make some changes in ·our favor. Let us come together as a unit, a single voice t() air our complaints and sugges~ions. We must keep Union a place which we feel good about. Changes must be made fot us. to be able to .leave Union with a good feeling, not a bitter one. Please keep your eyes open for various meetings regarding .an organized protest. They did it at Berkeley, at Kent, and at Brandeis. Let's do it here. PROTEST UNION! SHOOT THE PUC!

It is time that we, as a solid student body, raise our voices to let the administration understand what is happening to our college. As students, we are the heart and soul of Union. We entrust our present resources and future success to the well-being of our college. We receive an education, both in and out of the classroom which we trust is worth our commitment. Therefore, we have the right and must take an active part in decisions placed upon us, as the beneficiaries of a Union degree. Our cred.entials begin here! Why do we quietly sit back and complain amongst friends when our Camp Union is snatched away from us? There is no denying that the Spring Fling turned into a beer fest, but to take it away from us with no compromise, is simply the administration acting as a dictatorship. There was no discussion for compromise or an attempt by the administration and student body to come to a realistic plan to curb drinking at the long standing event. It was snatched away from us, placed in the books as a memory, and it's gone. Why do we not take an active role when the admmistration decides to remove Delta Chi, Delta Upsilon, and Beta Theta Pi from Union grounds? True, the brothers of Delta Chi attempted to gain Letters to tbe Editor do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the Editorial Board. All Letters To The Editor Must Be Typed, Double Spaced And Submitted To The Concordiensis Office by 4:00 P.M. On The Tuesday Preceding VVeekly Issuance of Concordiensis. Anonymous Letters And Those Over Five Hundred Words Will Not Be Accepted. grounds with the administration 'by obtaining over 1 ,0(;)0 sig:natures from the students in an effort to sway the admi11istration. The administtation tumed a deaf ear. Furthermore, Delta Chi was removed .from Raymond House so that the admjmistration could move more pe.,gple into the dorms. Yet, this year. Raymond Hou:Se is under hal'f filled, and 1nany of the Iesidents were 1111:happy living there. Simlila.rly. the administration is removing Beta for reasollls that were, in large part, the fault of the administratio11 themselves. Finally, Delta Upsilon's attempt at purcl!asing a House off campus was halted when the administratioa undermined the sale and p1uchased the house themselve:s. Why do we not make a sound when th-e administration organizes registration which makes it nnany times impossible for Seniors to gain the courses required for graduation?

(If this is so, why don't Security and Escort simply allow access only to solitary· female· students?) However, an1>ther problem within both the Secur'ity and Escort services exists, which I will illustrate with a couple of examples fr()m my own ·experiences. On one occasi<>ll, I called the Escort servic:e, asking to be picked up at Richmond and driven to the -computer center. It was around '11:30 p.m. I was told that I wo11ld be picked up the parkiug lot behind Richmond. I ended up standing alone in .the dark parking lot . surrounded <>n two sides by Schenectady for over half an. hour before tb.e -van pulled in. The point is that in calling the escortseiVic:e I was actually put in greatel.\' danger than the danger I was attempting to avoid. First ()f all, there are many lights surrounding the main part of the campos around the Nott Melllorial. Quite a few students can be seen passing across it at most times. Further, it is an open area with mrny emergency boxes, few spaces for possible attackers to hide, and plenty of space to see who's around and to run for b.elp if it should become nece~ary. However. in a dark parking: lot, a solitary student is isolated. There are cais behind which attackers might hide, attd there are no emergency ph()nes nearby. Another incident involved a time when 1 stayed in the library until midnight. When I called for a ride. Security told me a·~ would be there in a few miputes, and hal'!g up. I stood in the rear .glass-walled . hallway. expecting a security officer tQ escort me to the car. After over half an li.our of waiting, I called again. .and was tQld to wait in tbe puking lot in front of the tennis,col111S for my ride. I did not like standing atone in the ®k parking lot for fifteen minutes waiting for the security car. Tile nearest emergency phone was on the other side Qf the Hlllllanities building. This is Scbel'lectady, not a small country village. Assaults are reported in the Gazette enough to warrant concern. In these instances, among others, the Security and Escort services increased rather .than decreased danger. I realize that these experiences:~ _only . a sma11 sample. However, beca11se of them an<l others, t have frequently chosen to wa1k alone across cam.JttiS after 11:00 p.m. This is 11ot only quicker {it only talces five minutes), but actually safer. I am in no way cp11demning the Security or Esc()rt systems. Security, in particular. provides valuable services to students. The problem I havedesc:ribed is due to a flaw in the system. J{owever; it can easily be remedied. I suggest that the Security and Escort services cease to force solitary stude11ts to wait in dangerous places for prolonged periods. of time. Instead, when no road exists near the entrance of a building, the student should be told to wait inside the building near a door, arid the driver s.llould get out of the vehicl<e when it finally arrives and escort the student to it.

That's according to Lovell A. Jones, Ph.D., author of Minorities and Cancer and one of the founders of National Minority Cancer Awareness Week (this year April 15-21). While the smoking-canc.er link is common knowledge, the role of diet in cancer is now better · known and is significant. According to Dr. Jones' book, as many as 70 percent of .cancer deaths may be associated with diet. Two of the most prevalent, breast cancer and colon cancer, have been strongly linked to a diet high in fat and low in fiber. Dr. Jones says that blacks eat more fat, especially animal fat, and less fiber than whites, and recommends specific dietary changes. New Medical Text Focuses Exclusively On Geriatric Healtheare There are more Americans over the age of 65 than under 25. This age group uses 30 percent of all healthcare resources and that number is expected to increase to 50 percent by the year 2030. The \graying of America\ will create a greater demand for physicians specializb1g in geriatric care and greater understanding of the special needs of the geriatric pati.ent by the heaLth care commmity as a whole. In response, a leading pharmaceutical company is publisl!ing a new medical tex.t on geriatric medicitte.

The history of science and techncil<>gy in the United States is an impressive one, and we need to ensure its conti11ued succe:!ls into the 21st cent11ry. One way to f11rther .this aim is by pmmoting scientific and technological awareness during Nati()nal Science & TechEology Week, April 22- 28, 1~90. Integral to. the success of National Science· & .!fechnology Week (NSTW) 1990 is participation at every level: federal, state, local, and individ11al. NSTW is the petfect time to invite members of Congress, state government officials, business leaders, and others responsible for policy decisions to your campus to meet and see for themselves both the students and the professionals who teach them and who work to make science and technology such a vital part of all ofour lives. communicate enthusiasm for science and technology to a variety of audiences. NSTW activities can engender strong support for science and technology education, training, and research. Your public information office will receive a separate mailing that provides general information about NSTW, with suggestions for specific ways to celebrate this worthwhile program; we hope you will give these plans your full endorsement. Thank you for your interest and support ofNSTW.

DC ~OI'itl Dear Col1league: The National Science Foundation celebrates its 40th anniversary in 1990, providing an ideal opportunity to focus on the important role played by science and technology in the economic health and overall well-being of our nation. The history of science and technology in the United States is an impressive one, and we need to ensure its continued success into the 21 st century. One way to further this aim is by promoting scientific and technological awareness during National Science & Technology Week, April 22- 28, 1990. Integral to the success of National Science- & Technology Week (NSTW) 1990 is participation at every level: federal, state, local, and individuaL NSTW is the perfect time to invite members of Congress, state government officials, business leaders, and others responsible for policy decisions to your campus to meet a11d see for themselves both the students and the professionals who teach them and who work to make science and technology such a vital part of all of our lives. We hope that institutions such as yours will participate by developing creative events that personalize and communicate enthusiasm for science and technology to a variety of audiences. NSTW activities can engender strong support for science and technology education, training, and research. Your public information office will receive a separate mailing that provides general information about NSTW, with suggestions for specific ways to celebrate this worthwhile program; we hope you will give these plans your full endorsement. Thank you for y<Jur interest and support of NSTW. Sincerely. Erich Bloch.

By ANDY BRAVER Sports Editor Thougll I would like not to believe it,. the baseball season has begun. It's not that I don't like baseball. I'm just sick of it. Sick of the owners, the players, the salaries,. the lockout, and just the controversy. Sick of Donald Fehr, Chuck O'Connor, George Steinbrenner. and even Brent Musbutger (though we don't have to deal · witll him broadcasting it for a while). But since the season is already here, I guess I should enlighten the readers and fans with another e.dition of my famous predictions and thoughts about the season which is already upon us. - Barring a repeat of injury problems or other self- destructive behavior, Oakland's Jose Canseco could dtive in 150 runs with Rickey Henderson and Carney Landford hitting in front of him. - Kansas City's Mark Davis may lead the league ill saves, but Seattle's Mike Scltooler and Califomia's Bryan Harvey won't be far behind. - Players likely to be traded before June 1 are Calif()mia's Kirk McCaskill, the Y 3nkee's Luis Po Ionia . and Lance McCullers, Mil waukee's: Rob Deer, Boston's Lee Smith and Marty Barrett, Kansas City's Steve Farr, and Seattle's Jeffrey Leonard- .. By the end of the season, people will be talking about the Yankee's Roberto Kelly, Boston's Ellis Burks, Toronto's Kelly Grq_ber, and California's Oevon White as the emerging · superstars ·of the 1990s. - No managers will be fired. · Well, that probably won't be · : true, but one manager who · won;t be fired is Bucky Dent. His grasp ,on the most volatile position in all of sports will be strong enough to hold him for the et1lire season because i George Steinbrenner will be preoccupied with dodging investigators. - One of the tluee-million- dollar,men, California's Mark Langston, will have a solid year (ab!>ut 17-9), butlle won't even be the best pitcher on the Angels' staff this year. Chuck Finley will win 20 games and will be the best leftlia11der in the league. - New additions who will have a significant impact on their new teams: Laogston, Mark Davis, Boston catcher Tony Pena, and the Yankee's pitchers Pasqucl Perez and Tim Leary. - New .additions who will be disappointments: Boston reliever Jeff Reardon, Cleveland first baseman Keith Hernandez, Detroit first baseman Cecil Fielder and outfielder Lloyd Moseby, and Royals righthander Stonn Davis. - Cleveland catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. will have a very good season, but Milwaukt:r. outfielder Greg Vaughn will be the A.L. ~ookie of the Year. - If George Steinbrenner is suspended (please, please, please), I will personally organile a movement from the wildlydelirious Yankee fans to hold a Howard Spira Day at Yankee Stadium. - Milwaukee's Ted Higuera and Detroit's Jack Morris, limited by injuries last season when they combined for 15 victories, will each win at least 15 games this season. -New York's Dave Winfield, who missed all of last season becallse. of a back injury, will regaiR his old form, hitting around .285, and will help keep the Yankees in contention until their pitchers finally come back to earth and realize they are terrible. - Pl~yers on the decline will inclllde such names as Detroit's Alan Trammell, Kansas City's George Brett, Toronto's Mike Flanagan, Oakland's Dave Henderson and Minnesota's Gary Gaetti . And most importantly - Not one single baseball fa'l in America will say, at any , point in the season, \Gee I wonder bow Donald Fehr and Chuck O'Connor are doing?\ or \I've been trying to figure out whicll players are going to be in that top 17% and become eligible for salary arbitration.\ Now for those of you who actually know baseball and have made it through tbe article to this point, you have probably noticed that I neglected to mention the National League. I did so for pers<Jnal reasons. and believe me, it wasn't because I don't know lhe league well enough to make stupid predictions about it. I just didn't think it was worth mentioning that other league, the one where pitchers actually HIT. Sounds cra~y, doesn't it?!? (I'm just kidding .. There wasn't enough room for me to make a fool of myself writing about the H.L. as well as the A.L., so I didn't. Sorry!} ...

Union· F.ield Ev·ents Dominate ·williams' Meet Training in Schenectady May Have Helped in Overcoming Inclement Weather By M:EG PARSONS Saturday, April 14 was a crisp clear day in Williamstown, Massachusetts. But aever fear, the usual cloud cover rolled in late in the meet making for more familiar conditions;. The Union women were., howeve~, undaunted by the change in the weather. The standout performances were by the lJnion throwers. In the shotput relay, senior Beth Jewett, sophomore AHx Goldschmidt, and freshman Lori Simkins placed frrst with a combin~d thmw of 99'8 1/4 feet. This distance made a new meet record at Williams. The same three women. along with senior co-captain Alison Williams. racked up yet another first place fu the discus with a combined throw of 283 feet On tbe track, the runners als_o enjoyed a saccessful day. In the relays, the 4x200 team of Joy Grillon, Cyndi Hunter, Christia~a Agahiu, and· Claudiann Mapp placed third overall. The 4xl00 team, which consiste-d of Rika Poor. Hunter, Meg Parsons. and Denise Saunders, ran a good race with a time of 53.65. The distance medley team consisting of Williams, Hunter, Parsons, and Dawn Harrington, gained another third place for Union. The 4x400 meter relay was a fast one, coming very close to a third place fiu.ish with the team of Williams, Hanter, Parsons and Poor. In the open events, junior co-captain Meg Parsons placed fifth overall in the 400 meters, and qualified for the New York State Championships. Freshman Joy Grillon also had a good race t11nning a personal record of 68.1 seconds. In the 100 meters sophomore sprinters Denise Saunders and Claudiann Mapp ran personal liecords, and Saunders came away from the race with another third place finish. In the 800 meters, Rika Poor ran a quick race~ also scoring a third place finish for Union,. Freshman Dawn \Easter Bunny\ Harrington ran well despite a prolonged cold.

Australian Pediatrician Opens NCUR News Analysis By DANIEL J.. KENIRY The National Conference on Undergraduate Research opened on Thursday, April 19 in Memorial Chapel with an opening address by Dr. Helen Caldicott, an Australian pediatrician. The Chapel was filled with visiting 1.111dergraduates and faculty and a small number of Union students and faculty. In just ever an hour. Dr. Caldicou delivered an extremist harangue that was certainly inappropriate In the winter of 1989 Siena College e:xperienced an outbreak of measles, and now Union faces that same threat. Twenty-five cas.es were discovered there, and an emergency vaccination site was arranged. While Union awaits the results of the blood tests, plans have been developed by the Dean of Students office in conjunction with th.e Schenectady Health Depart- ment, the New York State Health Department and the 'Union College Health Services for a similar emergency vaccination unit. As of Tuesday, only two possible . cases have emerged on ·camp~s. All those who bave been ·in immediate contact witlt these students have been contacted and given the necessary vaccination. It is necessary to wait five to seven days after the rash develops before a J)roper blood test ean be taken. A proper test may be registered today, and the school will know the results by late tonight or tomorrow morning. In the event that these cases test positively for measles, it · is imperative that all members of the college community born after 1957 adhere to the plan developed for this emergency. All those students, graduate students, faculty, and staff who fall into this category must go to the designated vaccination New President Focus Of Crosstalk • 1 for a research occasion. She did not justify her remarks with any scholarly data, and did not even prepare a speech specifically for the occasion. Her commentary before students visiting our College has been recorded on videotape, and I will attempt a summary in lhis space. (If there is debate about the accuracy of my I notes, I would urge that her address be recorded and published for the campus community.) It is important to create a public record on this address, because of the nature of it. As one reads Dr. Caldicott's remarks, keep in mind that this is not a joke, that this was an academic lecture, and that she received a furious standing ovation. By JAY FREELAND News Editor This past Tuesday, in Upper Class Dining hall, a Crosstalk was held with the topic., \What should be the priori!ies ·of the next President of Union?\ The forum was opened by Professor Sorum of the. -Classics Department and included brief statements by Andy Sal'em (IFC President). Ben Auslander (on Students and Governance), Tim Sams (multi-cultm-al), and Erika Studint (on co- education). Professor Sorum (also on the Search Committee) opened by stating that the faculty and the student body are the two most important components of the College. She stated that the new president should be \bright energetic and open to the community. He should be a leader on campus, and most importantly, he or she should be an accomplished individual in his or her current occupation.\ First to speak was B~n Auslander. In his opinion. students and g()vemance do belong together. He suggested that the College; sponsor a talk on this subjec:t in order to bring out better interaction ()U caf!lpus. He condoned crosstalks, St11dent Forum on the road. and student involvement in faculty selections. However, one of his primary sugges:tions was that each club or organization on campus have a faculty advisor · for outside guidwlce. Andy Salem was the next to speak. The newly elected IFC President stated the positive aspects of Gteek life; and tile fact that we \lleed to know tile viewpoint of the new President on Greeks befcre he or slle enters the College.\ Salem also stated the need for better communication. between tile Greek system l.lnd the faculty and administration. Salem stated that \tlle three Greek organizations who have lost their housing. lost it by their own fault,\ a;nd that \his primary goal fol' the Greeks is to ke~p in control and· not screw up.\ Tim Sarns spoke on the multi-cultural viewpoint of electi11g a new president.

Elliot Well, Earth Day has come and gone, and I cannot say it was very climatic (pardon the pun). Maybe it was that I expected too much, was too hopeful of all the possibilities it brought with it. I guess I expected some sweeping event, like Theodore Roosevelt's creation of the national parks. Unfortunately, the \awareness\ which I gained was a slightly different one than aU tile fruit loops intye-dyes offered• In the past week !leading up to Eartfu Day, I happened upon some disturbing rea.lities. ·To any Green, these observations wou:ld :appear as promising as the Massachusetts Miracle to an economist.

This sounded great, but one couldn't help to remember tllat, while many of these companies may be sincere, the real motivation behind these people is to enhanc.e business. A true concern for the planet wouldn't have a root in monetary economics. l guess pressure is one way to get your point across, if not message. Another ruffling of my feat!Jers carne when I was lied to by my All-American McDonald's. The New York · Times reported that McD was using the recycling symbol on products which are, in fact, not recyclable. The article went on . . • unfortunately the awareness I gained was a slightly different one tbam all the fruit loops i·n tye-dyes offered. to quote a representative of the company as being \embarrassed\.

Of course they made available the McDonaldis and the Environment pamphlet, which tried to convince me that ' the polystyrene packages (resembling styrofoam to humans) is biodegradable. I swallowed my butger a little easier than that. Earth Day fell even further in my eyes concerning the lack of respect organizing groups played to the various righHo- life groups. It seems a contradiction to me-to rightly proJ)ose a preservation of the planet, while at the same time cutting off the hand which can make that change happen.

Continued 'from page 1 organization, and delivered quite poorly. Her speaking style ju.nbled words t()gether without clear sentences. Generally speaking, she discussed what she believed to be the greatest threats. to the planet: overpopulatio11, ozone depletion and global warming, pollution, and n\lclear weapons. Each point was argued with a sense of unparalleled urgency. a t<Jne of moral superiority, and an elitism that favors the higher- education establishment. On the issu.e of overpopulation, Dr. Caldicott argued that China has \educated and coerced people into llaving one baby\ and this has \worked quite well.\ She mentioned that infanticide is practiced in China, and its victims are usually females. Since males produce more sperm per ejaculate and females only one egg and have a nine month gestation period, Dr. Cald:icott argued that \females are more appropriate for the planet than males.\ Conceding tilat the West does not have an overpopulation prol>.lem, she said th~ Chinese have \a model that we must follow\ because for the West to not do so would be \seen as racism.'' Dr. Caldicott opposes most religions on the grou11ds that they are patriarchal She claimed that the \Muslim religion has an inapproprite response\ to these problems. compared Moslem breeding patterns that she had witllessed in India to rabbits, and called them \a plague of children.\ Second, Catholicism was inappropriate to take a stand against abortion and contraception. (At this point in her talk, several undergraduate students walked out in protest and one heckled her. Visibly flustered, she continued.) \As a biologist, we are an egocentric and ethnocentric species ... \ she said, arguing that humms have evolved as a warlike species. We now \threaten otusel ves and threaten to de!;:troy our fellow creatures.\ She favors the IU-486, the Fre11ch-made abortion pill. Also, she tossed out the idea of putting contraceptives in tile world water supply along with aphrodisiacs .to \keep everyone happy.\ If the earth were then left to other spec:ie.s, she questioned whether tllat. would be bad. . Dr. Caldicott described the problem of ozone depletion, noted that the ozone hole is growing over Alaska, md that there is a high incidence of skin cancer. CFC {chloro flouro-carbons in refrigerators, aerosol sprays, etc.) pr<Jduction should be stopped immediately, in her judgement Dr. Caldicott then described the greenhouse effect theory and noted its possible: effects on the pl:anet. She atwcked the Bush administradon for procrastination on the issue, stating that tbe U.S. is the largest producer of C~2 in the world. To reverse the trend, we should think of not using clothes G.ryers and using less electricity. Also, \cars are now obsolete\ according to Dr. Caldicott. The Chinese, Who \all have bikes now ... and soon will want refrigem.tors and cars; that will ensure global warming.\ Other nations try to emulate us. and as \we're well educated~\ so the West should take the first step and reverse this trend. FinaUy, Dr. Caldicott argued that W'hen she was younger. her family did not have :a refrigerator and she \didn't suffer from refrigerator deprivation as a girl ... She lll'ged' the elimillati()n of Brazil's foreign debt to save the rain forest, and mentioned other \inappropriate\ and wasteful items such as napkins, tampons~ disposable diapers, tea bags, and any sort of plasticware. Dr~ Caldicott said \When I was a child, we didn't have plastics and we didn't suffer ,plastic deprivation~\ She pleaded that we all learn to grow our own food. She then stated that she was simply planting ideas in her talk and did -not have time to go into deptll, and that she must apologize for that. Dr. Caldicott hoped that \we're all educated enough to know that nucleal\ power is not the solution\ to energy problems. She opposes nuclear power because of the possible negative health impact, and argues for U.S. government funding into energy altemati ves. Also, a law should be passed in the U.S. that mandates solar power in all buildings in the country. To deal with the nuclear threat to the planet, college students should \go to the steps of the Congress. chain themselves to the fence and fast until death until Bush goes to Moscow.\ George Bush represents the military- industrial complex and the American people must \turn the U.S. back to its origins.\ Every audience she speaks to does not believe they live in a true democrarcy, and each audience she meets tells her the corporations run all governments. In America, we must get back to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and \make the President the President of the people and not the President of the corporations.\ Lithuanian independence threatens G()rbachev's hold on power in the USSR, and hence the world's chances for peace. \Allowing Lithuania to secede from the USSR is like California becoming communist,\ .she concluded. Dr. Caldicott's concluding ' sentence was as follows: \It's time people who were scientifically and. medically liter:ate were elected to the Coligress. so we had truly educated people running the country.\ · In the question and answer period, Dr. Caldicott argued that we should not trust any corporation that is reforming its environmental policies. In response to a question that she was attacking American notions of individual freedom, she argued that the earth is dying: and \we've got to love the planet mare than our individual liberty.;' Another question addressed the logic in her argument that life on earth and individual quality of life should be respected and yet not the life of the unborn. Dr. Caldicott, in a frenzy, again mentioned Catholics' beliefs about .abortion, and raised three points: if laws are passed against abortion, rich women will have them and poor women will die; no child shoald be brought into the world unwanted; and, the earth is dying already and \babies are medically contraindicative to the health of the planet.\ Finally. she argued that humans are no more special than elephants, lions, and tigers. In response to a final question on g.enetic engineering, she said that she was \ambivalent about it\ but was <:onvinced that \the Pentagon and the military are using it for evil. ' 1 I feel that the committee owe& the campus a justification for the selection of this speaker. The members of the Union College program committee that chose the major speakers for the NCUR conference were: Lawrence Hollander, Profe§.S()r of Electrical Engineering and Computer Stience and Dean of Engineering; Joan Krejci,. Associate Dean of Graduate and Continuing Studies; James McCord, A~sociate Proiessor of English; Bryon Nichols, Associate Professor of Political Science; Susan Niefield, As.sociate Professol' of Mathematic:s; David Peak, Professor ofPhysics and Chair of the Deputment; Christina Sorum, Professor of CUI.ssics and Chair of the Department; Hilary Tann, Ass<Jciate Professor of the Arts; Thomas Werner, Professor of Chemistry .a:ild , Chair of the Department The thoughtful student who left campus for the weekend (as the admini:stration clearly wanted us to do) is left to speculate 011 the degreee to which Union was embarrassed by this address. From the standpointof ~pus debate,. it is important that the College encourage controversial and thought-provoking speakers. But this selection, .by a ccmmittee ()f faculty and administrators, makes it clear that the College has little interest in a respon ~ible standard ofpllblic discourse. In such a debate, respect for opposing races, religions,. and belief stystems should be emphasized. If there is one major questiem we should all be forced to grapple with as a result of this disastrous episode, it is: this: why does ottr campus require lcony extremists for intellectual stimulation? \Broaden your horizons\ and \become edu~ated\ in College, they aU opinw.

We live in a rcapitalist world and therefore must understand the other cultures.\ Erika Studint spoke last ,concerning: the co-educational Y.~iewpoint~ at Union. Studint questioned whether or not the Co1lege has achieved the level of co-edQcation desired as we approach· the twentieth anniversary of admitting women to Union. She stated tllat safety was a primary concern for females at the College and that the new president could help by ' 8 ditecting more funds towards ~ervices such as escorts.\ Studint also stated concerns mver the fact that in recent yrears, the percentage of female .professors with tenure only illcreased from 14% to 16%. Following the statements by tl!ese people, the floor was tllen Qpened to the audience of nearly 100 students, professors and administrators. The primary concerns raised involved Greek life and student i!lteracti(}n with the administration. One student suggested the point that several decisions in the past year have b(l~en made with the \administration going behind <llll\ backs.\ He cited the recent approval of the calendar for next year. A pol·l in a February is:sue of Concordiensis cited tb.at over 9()% of the student b<Jdy opposed the new calendar. Ben Auslander addressed the C()ncerns by stating that the scllool.has a tendency to make vezy \reactionary policies rather tllam anticipatory,\ and that \students need to get out of the aiJath~tic cycle of non- in-volvement\ that currently ex:ists.

FEATURES Do Men and Women Realty Speak Different Languages? By JONATHAN KRAMER, PllD. and DIANE DUNAWAY Courtesy of Woman Magazine Men and women often attach different meanings to the same words, phrases, and actions. They infer different meanings based on their personality styles, points of view, and conditioning. Sometimes it seems that men and women speak different languages! Because of this, men have illu!;ions about women that are long on fantasy and short on reality. These male illusions are often based on male- oriented material, which is often the foldout girl of men's magazines. Tilese stereotypes are the \:real\ women, the desirable women according to male fantasies, even though (as any : l'JomaB'I def!nitioq , SOON I'll call you soon. Two to three days. Two weeks to never.

Despite their innaccuracy, however, these fantasies, :and other equally false notions, supply mucltof a young man's practicai se:x education. And because there is .so little realistic daota 'beyond these fantasy wa.men or locker-room talk, men often apply this iuformatioil to women in general. Of c<>ur.se, the more experience a. man has with women, tlte nl()re he realizes how inaccurate his stereotwes are. He c<>tltillues to keep tb.ese illusions,. however, at least iJri part, becawe be lacks anytlting more relia1>1e with which to replace tbem. Aml since male culture generally won't permit a man to aclnowledge that he doesn't know .how to relate to a woman, pa:tticularly :how to make love to a woman, he isn't even free to seek out more accurate information. These illusions continue to be reinforced by society and sometimes even by those women wh<> lost track of .their own needs and, for whatever reason. att~mpt to fulfill this male fantasy (and often emf up angry and more frustrated because their needs are then completely lllltl1et).

H Because men llave diffi<:ulty THE WRITING NEW CENTER S·EEKS TUTORS The Writing Center is looking for several new tutors for 1990- . 91. Students can pick up applications at the CeAter on the second floor of Whitaker House. Tutors work about 8-1 0 hours each week in the afternoon a11d evenings. Being an English major is not a prerequisite. Some .of the most capable tutors over the last six years have come from a variety of disciplines. While tutors must be good writers and interested in the writing process, they need other talents as well-tact, patience, maturity, and sensitivity. \The job requires initial and ongoing training,\ says Director Margaret Wadehra. \W ask tutors to do some reading over the summer, participate in several training sessions before the term begins in September, and attend weekly s1aff meetings during the year.\ Anyone who would like further information should call Margaret Wadehra or Assistant Director Sandy Longley text. 6058. The deadline for applications is M.ay 1st. The interviewing process will immediately follow; expressing tender emotions and know so little about what women find romantic. this ritual takes tile place of personalexpression. Illusion No. 2 Wome11 Are Impossible to Please \No matter how much I try to show her I 'love her, it's never enough. I go to work, I bring home my paycheck, l don't run around with other women. I spend time with the kids, I remember her birthday and our .anniversary, and I try to keep my bad moods to- myself. What more does the woman want? I tell her that I love her; at least, sometimes I tell her.[ gues~ sbe 1 d like mere hand-hol4ing, .b.ut I'm not the hand-holding kind of guy. Anyway .. no matter how much I do, there's always the sense that she's not .satisfied. Why doesn't anything please her?\ This problem stems from the erroneotls belief that w6men are unpredictable and impossiMe to please. Illusion. No. 3 Having Sex ,is the Best l~ay to Make Us BBtb Fe.el Good \After we argue. the thing I want m()st of aU is f()r us to make love so that we can feel happy together again. Sex makes me forget the fight and helps pu.t it in the past. But a lot of the: time after a fight, she gets even angrier if I want to make us feel hetter by making love. She says tbat it isn't the point. But why isn't it? Why does she want t(} prolong the fight? I don't understand that ~-' all.\ Since sex is ()fie of the few areas in which m:en are allowed to express emotion. it's often the flrst way a man will think of to express tenderness. It is also an easy way to feel good. A. man wm assume that sex is the vvay 1o make her feel good as vvell. He is completely confused when he discovers that a}th{)ugh it may make her feel goocl. this physical sen£atiell isn't what is most impo-rtallt to her. Also, when a COtiJ}le fights, making love doesn't u~ually confront the problem for her. IHusion No. 4 Da,ily Stresses Shouldn't Dimhtislt Her Sexuality Any More Than It Does Mine \l work hard all day, and when I ~ome home at night, I'd like to make love with. her, but aU t()D l()ften, she complains . that .she\s too tired. It doesn't make any sense. I've worked hard all '!lay, but I'm still interested in sex. If she cared abollt me in the same way that I cue sbout her, she would want to m.ake love too. Illusion No. 5 W (t.Dtell Have Difficulty Saying What They Mean ao.d Are Often Hard to Understand \Wome.ll never seem. to say what they mean. Half the time, they doo't get to the point, and the other half, they are too inationa:l ~bout things and talk on an.d ~n without saying anytliing~ ?Sometimes, I can't figure out what it was she was trying to tell me. During an argumellt,. it's even worse. I try to be calm and stick to the facts., b11t that makes her even madder.''

FEAT'lJRES What· Do - U · Have To Say? · By MARY ELLEN WING, Photography Editor Was there enough publicity about NCUR? I was dissapointed that I knew nothing of what was going on. There were a good number of Union .students who bad: put a lot of work into the conference, it would have been good to support them. Unfortunately, the school made it almost impossible to find out about it.. 1 was involved because of AV and saw mMY wonderful speakers deliver papers to empty rooms. So much of the research was brilliant and entertaining, b11t the organizers assumed Union students wotildn't care to learn. I went to some of the lectures despite the schoors lack of encouragement and was insulted that I was made to feel unwelcome.

Also men and women often don•t share the same meaning attributed t() gestures and words. This leads to the assumption that women are simply unable to communicate clearly. Illusion No. 6 If She Looks Sexy, Sme Feels Sexy \My wife atid I went to a party last week. She spent the whole day getting fixed up, and she looked terrific in a dres:s that showed that everything she has was in all tile right places. But when we got home, she said she was exhausted. She took off her m!lkeup and went to sleep. How can women be so hot to go one minute and so cold the next?\ This comes from the false belief that if a woman looks sexy and exoeites a man s,exually~ ~ the.n. . slle is experiencing sexual feelings: meaning, if slle looks sexy, she must feel .sexy; if she's exciting to a man. she must be excited too. In essence. he projects his ex:.citelnent onto her. Then when she doesn't react the way he anticipates he feels confuesd or even angry. Illusion No. 7 Just Being Together Should BE Enough For Her As It Is For Me. \I care a lot about her, and I really like it when we're together. I don't care if we go the whole night without sayirlg a word, but ju!;t being together in the same ro()m is -satisfyi11g in itself.Why isn't she happy just being with me\l\ Since it's s;o difficult for many men to relate verbally, they have their need for intimacy satisfied by simply being togeth~r in· the same toom, often without so m:uch as word being exchanged. He is surprised when a woman seems to feel that he doesn't care about her or that he doesn't want to spend time with her. Illusion No. 8 Women Are Too Emotional \Women are amazing; my wife will cry over anything. Can't a woman get a grip on herself?\ Since male training teaches men that emotions are generally bad, not to be expressed or even felt, men not only have a difficult time dealing with women's emotions, but they also have no way of understanding them. Therefore men often simply reject women's emotions (and this part of her) as strange and unattractive. What To Do Begin by trying tQ communicate with him on his terms. Listen to how much he actually talks; how much of his conversation is just relating for the sake of it and how much is used for ~onveying information? With men who speak entirely in informational terms, you wiU need to be more informational yourself. With meli who do some talking simply for the sake of relating, tllen you can also do more of the same. Remember to keep his point of view in mind and to realize how he will interpret what you say through the use of his male values. Some men feel more comfortable talkjng about personal· and emotional things when under the cover of darkness. Let him get used to communicating more intimately in as safe an environment as you can create. Keep in mind that men and women may be different; one -Jonathan Bymum person is not necessarily better than the other. Alth(mgh there is definite value in maintaining our differences, we need to com pehend and use these differences in order to advance our relationships. The truth is that male communication differs greatly from female comm11nication. Mea will stick to the facts. Men tend to avoid discussion of personal problems because it reveals weakness. Consequently, when women want to talk to solve an issue, men would rather get to the point, not discuss the emotions but focus on coming up with a rational solution. His style of few words also allows him to maintain his annored distance and emotional anesthesia. The limited talking lets him avoid emotion while simply conveying information and logic. Since neither men nor women usually grasp this underlying difference in their use of .language, it creates problems that are often never addressed or resolved; the misunderstanding is so deep and so confusin.g for both parties that they never even begin to sort it out. It's frightening to think of how many relationships have undoubtedly been derailed by these misunderstandings. If suc;h misunderstandings happen often enough, the co1.1ple may end up furious at each other without any hope of discovering the true source of the difficulty . If a man and woman are to have a good relationship, they must learn to talk to-- and nndetstand~- each other. Copyright 1990 by Jonathan Kramer, Ph.D., and Diane Dunaway.

The special thanks from Mitterand were not appreciated either, since Qaddafi reooains the boss of the Abu Nidal group.

Forget Atlanta and peanut farmers. The 'Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic is the original Georgia, where Turkish armies traversed th.e mountins in attempts to extend the Turkey to the norther Caucasus. Having sought Russian protection from invaders, Georgia has remained a Soviet Republic since 1925. Its unspoiled beauty makes it a popular tourist baven. A vto Gigineishvili, a Soviet student Who attended Union last year, recently hosted his old International House roommate in Georgia. At Sheremetyevo. Airport in Moscow, amongst ominous rows of Aeroflot planes bearing the Soviet flag~ Avto waited to welcome his American guest. The two friends spent a night in the outskirts of Moscow, admiring the scenery. After a three~hour Aeroflot flight, the two friends arrived in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. Tbilisi is loc!lted in a valley amongst tbe Caucus Mountains. Towering mountains surr()und the city, and have virtually .protected it from Tur.ldsh invasions. An old castle, situated on a cliff overlooking the: city, reminds tourists and natives about Georgia's ancient past. The solid metal Mother of Georgia stands high atop the mountains which neighb()r downtown Tbilisi. In one band, she holds a bowl of wine for Georgia's friends; in her other hand, she commands a Iarge sword for Georgia's enemies. Wine and swords are rather popular in Grorgia. Shopping \An old castle, situated on a cliff OPerlook ing the city, reminds tourists and natives about Georgia's andent past.\ in Tbilisi Square, a large business district, a tol:!fist will find a wide ramge of drinking hams (from g()ats) and many sharpened swords and daggers.

Many churches exhibit old Georgian writing that is indecipherable for even mod~rn-day native Georgians! Monasteries are hidden near little mountain valleys, and many castles remain intact. Near the Turkish border lies the hidden city of Vardzia, an interconnecting series of over 400 rooms located within a mou11tainside. During periods of war, the Georgian kings and queens would retreat to V ardzia wHh their courts. Invading Turkish armies were unable to locate Vardzia, for only two caves lead into the city. Toda)', toursits may tour old Vardzia, alth()ugh several earthquakes have destroyed half of the ancient city. Recently, the Georgia11 Soccer Federation formed to promote matches amongst the various regions of the republic. The First Georgian National -Soccer Tournament began in late March, boasting teams from remote villages across the Caucasus. Opening matches were played in Thilisi stadium, where baseball is not too popular. For those Union students accustomed to playing tennis, there are always free courts availabl;e at the gymnasium in downtown Tbilisi. Trivia 1. Where~s the Gum Department Store? 2.

The special thanks from Mitterand were not appreciated eitller, since Qaddafi remains the boss of the Abu Nidal gr<Jup. As far as the European community is concerned, France is no longer held in esteem. British press qualified the government's behavior as being a form of \international hypocrisy.\ Once a great nation, one of the leaders of Europe, Fran.ce is now through its accommodations with terrorist regimes and its willingness to make concessions to L:ybia-a pawn into criminals hands. Some indulgent people may ask, '\'What should tbe President have done?\ For the safety of humanity instead of seeking aberrant adjustments with terrorists, he should have helped in their overthrow.

Forget Atlanta and peanut farmers. The Georgian S<Jviet Socialist Republic is ~he original Georgia, where 'Turkish armies traversed the mountins in attempts to e)(tend the Turkey to the norther Caucasus. Having sougllt Russian protection from invaders, Georgia has remained a Soviet Republic since 1925. Its unspoiled beatlty makes it a popular touristha\Ven. A vto Gigineisllvili, a Soviet student who attended Union last year, recently hosted his old Internati(}nal House roommate i:n Georgia. At Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow, amongst ominous rows of Aerotlotplanes bearing the Soviet flag, t\.vto waited to welcome his A.merican guest. The two friends spent a night in the outskirts of Moscow, admiring the sc~nery. After a three-hour Aeroflot flight, the two friends ll!lived in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. Tbilisi is loc;at~d in a valley amongst the Caucus Mountains. Towering mountains surround the city, and have virtually protected it from Turkish invasions. An old castle, situated on a cliff overlooking the city, reminds tourists and natives about Georgia's ancient past. The solid rnetal Mother of Georgia stands high atop the mountains which neighbor downtown Tbi:lisi. In one hand, she h.,lds a bowl of wine for Georgia's friends; in her other hand, she commands a large sword for Georgia's enemies. Wine and swords are rtlthcr popular in Georgia. Shopjping \An old castle, situated on a cliff overlooking the city, reminds tourrists and natives about Georgia's ancient past.\ in Tbilisi Square, a large business district, a tourist will find a wide range of dri11king horns (from goats) and many sharpened swords and daggers. With Georgia's many fine vineyards, drinking wine from large horns has become a pastime. Hearty moumtain villagers are even insultted if visitors do not join them in a toast \to mighty Geor.gia.\ Handmade swords and daggers have become Georgian national symbols. International By Aime Simon Georgia's history dates back Lo the thi~rd and fourth centuries. Many churches exhibit old Georgian writing that is indecipherable for even modem-day native Georgians! Monasteries arc hidden ncar little mountain valleys, and many castles remain intact. Near the Turkish border lies the hidden city of Vardzia, an interconnecting series of over 400 rooms located within a mountainside. During periods of war, the Georgian kings and q ucens would retreat to V ardz ia with their courts. Invading Turkish armies were unable to locate Vardz:ia, for only two caves lead into the city. Today, toursits may tour old Vardzia, although several earthquakes have destroyed half of the ancient city. Recently, the Georgian Soccer Federation formed to promote matches amongst the various regions of the republic. The First Georgian National Soccer Tournament began in late March, boasting teams from remote villages across the Caucasus. Opening matches were played in Tbilisi stadium, where baseball is not too popular. For those Union students accustomed to playing tennis, there are always free courts availabl;e at the gym nasi urn in downtown Tbilisi. Trivia 1. Where's the Gum Department Store? 2.

CONCORDJENSlS, April 26, 1,90 Page 13 -~ The Other Side ofNCUR To the Etitor: COn$rUulations go oat. to the Unioll.COllege community for an e::xcellent jeb at NCOR. I worked for the Audio .. Visual depart111eont and it receh,ed nothjllg \)ut :good reports. The speak-ers l heard were eJC.ce-ptional. I heard similar report~ from almost everyone eise I ~[J():ke ro. It's tOo bac.J that Unioll sudents weren't acmally invited. How· can Union claim that it's C()nrerned with academics when it urges its student body to avt>icl the undergraduate event .of the year, especially when k is being held on Union's campus? This is absoltlte hypocrisy. Initi+tlly it was because the college. was worried about its parking problem. I wandered 3I:'cn,md West:, Fox~Davidson, and Ricbmo11d parking lots, atound 10 AM, and there were enough spaces to park a large number of ca.rs, In fact the lots were barely !llalf full. Additionally the NCUR presenters and professois were bussed ill from their hct-els. The College didn't -even need the space. . Allotller possible reas()n was that tlu College didn't have enou_gh classroom capacity. I ran all the audio\'visual equi:prnent for the arts' presen'tations. Admittedly the preserltations weren't empty, present, There was plenty of room for. interested students to enjoy interesting, but unpopulated lectures. MQst students took advantage of the long weekend and went away. That is perfectly acceptable. However if the college encouraged even one student to not attend NCUR then it is not living up to the academic objectives it promised us when we enrolled here. If Union had encouraged student attendance_, how many - students would have actually attended? Two, thousand? That 18. unlikely. There was plenty of room for the few hundred that may have attended. Union didn't even publish a schedule of the events so Union students could attend desired lectures. Additionally the College charged Union students to attend speakers that the visiting students, their professors. and our own professors got into for free. Union. claims it is an outstanding liberal arts institution that strives for academic excellence. How can it make these claims if it encourages its students not to participate in the educational opportunities of the national undergraduate conference? How can a faculty member attend these events and discourage students from doing the same? but ther-e was room for more How can the administration people. 1 was told that a claim they deserve to be rated student-from New Mexico gave among. the top schools in the a tall md one person showed nation and yet actively up.

Even the faculty members who were interested in giving schedules to their students were told that they were not provided for unregistered faculty. Although it is unfortunate that nothing :can be done about this past weekend, maybe awareness of this .situation will prevent it from happening when Union has the chance to .host similar events .. Amy Schachnovsky '90 Newsflash: Campus Undergrads Retreat To the Editor: Ask the average student what went on at Union this past weekend in relation to NCUR and they will probably know very little. For those of you Who don't know, NCUR does not stand ·for \Newsflash Campus Undergrads Retreat\ It is the National Conference for Undergraduate Research which Union had the honor to host. Unfortunately it seems Union students were purposefully ~glee ted. We are greatly disappointed with the organizers of this event.. From an educational standpoint, our needs were overlooked. The barest minimum was done in informing the:-student body of what would be happening during NCUR. Therefore the impression given is they were not anxious to have the majority of students involved in the conference. The organizers were proclaiming to do us a favor by giving us an \ac[ldemic n}Cess.\ In reality they needed our classrooms (tllese are our classrooms are,n't they?) to accommodate the g()Q or so visitors. · It seems that those 1n charge do not give the students credit for having a desire to pursue educational interests. Had we been informed about the academic opportunities, more students would !lave stayed for the conference. To compound the problem. information was anything but readily available for those students who were fortunate enough to blow what was g<1ing on. We want tile school to involve itself in tbe outside academic .community and feel it's important to do so. However. this should only be done when the student's best interests ltave been put first and foremost. We are curious as to the primary focus of Union's administration. Is it to make a good impression on the outside world or to educate its srudent body? Would it be presumptuous to assume -that this monumental event, this feather in Union's cap worn solely by the administration, will be used to enhance the future reputation of Union College'? Unfortunately this i:s a farce. The reality is that the majority of Union's students were not even made aware' of the educational opportunities available, and thus were not present.

The Other Side of NCUR To the Editor: Congratulations go out to the Union College comm11nity for 811 exceUent job at NCUR. I worked for the Audio-Visual department and it received nothi11g but good reports. The speakers I heard v~lere exceptional. I heard similar repor1s fmm almost everyone else I spoke to. It's too bad that Union students weren't actually invited. H€>'w can Union claim that it's ccncerned with academics whell it nrges its student OOdy to a\Void the undergradt~ate event of the year, especially when it is being held on Uni()n's campus? This is absolUte hypocrisy. Initially it was because the college was worried about its parking problem. I wandered around West, Fox-Davidson, and Rich.mond parking lots, around 10 AM, and there were enough spaces to park a large n11mber of cars. In fact the lots were barely half full. Additionally the NCUR presenters and professors were bussed in from their hotels. The College didn't evell need the space. A11other possible reason was that the College didn't have enough classroom capacity. I ran all the audio-visual equipment for the arts' presentations. Admittedly the presentations weren't empty, but there was room for more people. I was told that a student from New Mexico gave a talk and one person showed up. Can you imagine coming to give a talk all the way from New Mexico and having one person show up? I bet lie was extremely happy with tile fact that Union students were told that they were unwelcome for his presentation. I went by some rooms in Humanities and there were at most five people present. There was plenty ()f room for. interested students tOt enjoy interesting, but unpopulated lectures. Most students took advantage of the lbng weekend and went away. That is perfectly acceptable. However if the college encouraged eve11 one student to not attend NCUR then it is not living U}l to the academic objectives it promised us when we enrolled here. If Union had encouraged student attendance, how many students would have actually attended? Two thousand? That is unlikely. There was plenty of room for the few hundred that may have attended. Union didn't even publish a schedule of the events so Union students could attend desired lectures. Additionally the College charged Union students to attend speakers that the visiting students, their professors, and our own professors got into fOtr free. Union claims it is ar1 outstanding liberal arts institution that strives f()r academic excellence. How em it make these •:.:!aims if it encourages its students not to participate in the educational opportunities of the natio11al undergraduate conference? H<Jw can a faculty member atten.d these events and discourag:e students from doing the same? How can the administration claim they deserve to be rate<! among the top schools in the nation and yet actively discourage educational opportunities among their students. Who really lost? vr e did. l saw what the rest of yo-u missed. If you didn't do anything this weekend y~u missed a lot. Sincerely, Michael 0. Schtllitz Come to Union's COFFEEHOUSE This Friday and Every Friday 7:30- 10:30 p.m. CC 302 Enjoy gourmet coffee, tea, homebaked pastries. Live Music and Lots of Atmosphere! All Welcome! CONCORDIENSIS, April 26, 1990 Page 13 LETTERS Union Obstructs Campus Participation 'To the Editor: This .past weekend dwing the NCUR I was one member of the Union community that chose to stay on campus. As a student who lives outside the New England area, it was not worth traveling a great distance for four days. I was very curious to see what the National Conference on Undergraduate Research was all about. However I found attending presentations to be impossible due to the lack of printed materials available to anyone who was not a registered participant. Although I expressed my interest to members of the \committee I was rudely discouraged from attending anything. For a school that constantly questions our academic inclinations, I find it hard to believe that I was unable to supvort some of our most promising fellow students. Even the f2culty members who were interested in giving schedules to their students were told that they were not provided for unregistered faculty. Although it is unfortunate that nothing can be done about this past weekend, maybe awareness of this situation will prevent it from happening when Union has the chance to host similar events. Amy Schachnovsky '90 Newsflash: Campus Undergrads Retreat To the Editor: Ask the average student what went on at Union this past weekend in relation to NCUR and they will probably know very little. For those of you who don't know, NCUR does not stand for \Newsflash Campus Undergrads Retreat\ It is the National Conference for Undergraduate Research which Union had the honor to host. Unfortunately it seems Union students were purposefully neglected We are greatly disappointed with tile organizers of this event. From an educational standpoint, our needs were overlooked. The barest mtmmum was done in informing the student body of what would be happening during NCUR. Therefore the impression given is they were not anxious to have the majority of students involved in the conference. The organizers were proclaiming to do us a favor by giving us an \academic recess.\ In reality they needed our classrooms (these are our classrooms aren't they?) to accommodate the 800 or so visitors. [t seems that those in charge do not give the students credit for having a desire to pursue educational interests. Had we been informed about the academic opportunities, more students would have stayed for the conference. To compound the problem, information was anything but readily available for those students who were fortunate enough to know what was going on. We want the school to involve itself in the outside academic community and feel it's important to do so. However, this should only be done whea the student's best interests have been put first and foremost. We are curious as to the primary focus of Union's administration. Is it to make a good impression on the outside world or to educate its student body? Would it be presumptuous to assume that this monumental event, this feather in Union's cap wom solely by the administration, will be used to enhance the future reputation of Union C()lJege? Unfortunately this is a farce. The reality is that the majority of Union's students were not even made aware of the educational opportuni tics available, and thus were not present. With deepest regrets, Nancy Feiwel '90 Michael Tremante '90 Presidential Candidate: Dr. James W.

·- ... Page 14 CONCORDIENSJS, April 26, 1990 LETTERS Time to Shoot the PUC! To the Editor: With the advent of the Protest Union Committee, it is time to move beyond simply complaining to taking some form af action. To mount a protest one must have not only a cause, but the means by which to act upon that cause. Dissenters at Union are notorious for impulsively embracing causes while neglecting to devise means to address those causes. If the newly formed Protest Union Committee is willing to act as a catalyst for student action, and has sound methods by which to execute that action, then they will gain the support of the Unicn student body. If not, PUC is wasting everyone's time and Concordiensis' space. If the student body is serious about change on campus, a simple declaration of that desire is insufficent. The students must realize that action is currently the only available method. Petitions and surveys have proved futile in gaining even a semblance of dialogue with the administration. The examples are well-known (Delta Chi, the calendar, etc.). The time bas come for the student body to put up or shut up. There are methods available to the students if the student body. as a whol~. is wilting to sacrifice for the betterment of the community. Labor provided by Union students,. both paid and voluntru;y, is imperative to the functioning of tile College. Students are essential to the college as resident advisors, orientation advisors, gatesmen, llosts to prospective students, and all work study positions (library, mailroom, food service, etc.). We provide a great deal of free and inexpensive labor to the school. Union cculd not function properly without these students. A total student boycott of these: services would greatly impede the operation of the college andrould jeopardize the f11ture of thls institution. Who woulq give tours to prospectives? Wllo would monitor the pro-:per functioning of all dormitories? Who would coordinate freshman orientation? Willo would put the books on the: shelves, sort the mail, or he:lp prepare and serve all meals? The college cannot aff()rd to pay competitive wages to non- Union students to perform the same services. The goal of a student boycott would not be: to harm the :college. Rather, such an action would be intended tc establish a permanent and sincere dialogue between the students and the administration. Students must understand that tlle administration makes policy for the well-being of the institution. These policies may or may not be of benyfit to students who are attending the college when these policies are instituted. The administration must also realize that students deserve an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to the policy making process ... Currently, no such opportunity for the students exists. Threatening such action is not enough. If real change is desired, students must sacrifice through this or a similar form of protest. Letters, banners, and other feeble attempts. at protest are absolutely useless. If students are unwilling to sacrifice then they must resign themselves to the degenerating state of affairs. A ])rotest of this nature requires effective leadership. This job is tailor- made for the Protest Union Committee. The opportunity for change is within reach of a llllified student body. If PUC is serious, it is up to them to stirnulte. unify, and direct the Union student body. Do Something Or Shut Up, Michael 0. Schulitz '90 Christos J. Nikolis '90 The Degeneration of the Generation To the E(iitor: Your eliitorial, \1660's or 1990's\ (A]lril 20), all too ~Well reflects tlte attitudes that 11ave led to the ~ystematic decayr of traditional Western society, epitomize-d by the United States. lllst as the 17th certt\lcy brought ex_temal controls tc the extreme, tl\e 1990s will Sl)['ely continue the pattern of tile recent pe1st and bring the gr<>ss abuse of personal freedom to the same emd. The disappearance of the traditional American famil~ is a direct result of extretne individualism. No longer is allegiail'()e ta anyonf b\lt number 011e deemed impOJt:ant. or prudellt. Career goals md individt11);l priorities h.ave overtake11 the priority of fa!llily and commanity as the gree1te:st good. Tile- concept of objec.tive societal11orms that have s.anely and morally guided this c<>ulltry for over 100 years has J)een replaced by one of t()tal subjecti\V.ity with regad. to what is :rigbt, and what is wrong. Under the guise ()f personal freedom and progte:ss for the illdividual, Americans have collv-inced themselves tllat . each ht.dividual has tlte authority to .determine his value systems, and tll~t responsil)le government and established .religious groups ought not to impo.se such objective morality. This attitude has resUlted in a gener~tio:n of soon to be adults, the majority of wbom have been raised dirctionless, only concerned with themselves and the immediate futtU\e. Without the family structure there is no, guidance~ no one to look to but adults who fail to find the answers to their own problems, letalone their children's. The lack of positive influence has resulted in a loss . of identity that affects all Americans. The violence of abortion and n1pe, the despair of suicide and drug abus~. the confusion of homelessness and te:en pregnancy, the pain of divorce and abandonment, and the physical .abuse of women and children are all resultant of a society wandering in darkness, guided by those preaching not community, but rights oJ individuals at the expense of others, whether they be old or young, men or women, born or unborn. Ultimately, nothing will change until America stops telling itself what it wants to hear and wakes up to the stark reality of what is.

Sincerely, Kirk Bleemer Threat -Letter Incites Rage To .the Editors: I recently (4/10) received the enclosed letter in my mailbox. I fmd this treatment of students unforgivable. I attended Union so I could get a more personal treatment than I would at a larger school. I am. not attending_- Union so Dwight Wolf can threaten me. Yes, I'm late in registering! So you're going to throw out a senior. Of course not, bu.t the letter certainly implies that you will. The carbon copy to my parents that will probably arrive after Atpil 13th (the registration deadline) will certainly he something scary to read.\ How would you like to receive mail saying that your son is being kicked out of college in his senior year? I personally think that Dwight S. Wolf owes an apology to every student, and every parent that received this letter. Since I am gong to be an alumnus as of this June, I will certainly rememl:u~r this letter when I am asked· for contributions. Gene Spagnuolo This letter was received by Mr. Spagnuolo, Dear Non,..;Registrant: The deadlne for registration for the Spring Term 19&9-90 was Friday, April 6. As of this morning you had not registered. We can only as.sume that you bave decided not to attend Union this term but if this is not the case you must formally register in my office no later than Friday, April 13. If you do not register by that date we will remove you from any courses for which you preregistered, rem:ove you from the June grad·uation list and administratively drop you from the College for the term. You should be aware that if you do consider yourself a student this term, until you have regjstered we will not, nor have we so far, certified you as a student for the Spring term. This includes certifications for student loans and financial aid as well as for intercollegiate athletic participation. Finally, late registration carries with it a fine (as specified in the 1989-90 Academic Register).of $25.00. Please take care of this matter inimediately. Sincerely, Dwight S. Wolf R~gistrar Allilyone interested m joining ttJhe Parents Weekend Committee Sigm up in tlllle Dea c1 Students Offiico .. To the Editors: I will preface my remarks with the statement that I do not normally respond to letters to the -editor because they represent ;fhe voice and opinion of the people and every one of us is entitled to our opinion. However, the April 19th edition of the Concordiensis carried a letter .to the editor regarding the Student Escort Service which, in my opinion, mentioned a dat:~gerous course of aCtion. The titled lead to this letter was Escort: The W()rse of Two Evils. First I would like to publicly apologize to Miss Monfasani for the two aberrations in escon service that she endured. Admittedly a half~hour wait for sen'ice is abnormally long and is not the norm. Escort service req11ests are usually completed within 10-15 minutes and many are completed sooner. During the calendar year 1989 the student operated escort service fulfilled 5. 787 requests for service. This number does not represent the actual numbers of students carried because the norm is that on each escort there are multiples of persons who are escorted. For the first three months of this year the escort service has fulfilled 4,801 requests for se.r.vice. I welcome all comments regarding campus safety sew-ices. If the Campus Safety Department is to continue servicing the campus community in an effective way I must know when problems occur so that I can look for corrective solutions. I would encourage members of the campus community to contact the Campus Safety Department immediately· whenever you are confronted with a situation tbat you feel was inappmpriate... ask for the shift supervisor, If the supervisor is not immediately available, leave your name and number and the supervisor will return your call. Further, you may call the Administrative Offices and ask to speak with the..director or assistant director anytime between 8 a.m.-4 p.m .• Monday-Friday. If you have called for an escort and it does not arrive within a reasonable time {15 minutes maximum), please recall. No system is perfect and human error or other problems may occur. The core of my concern with Miss Monfasani's letter is her statement: \I have frequently chosen to walk alone across campus after 11.p.m. This is not only quicker (it only takes five minutes), but actually safer.\ I respect Miss Monfasani's right to her opinion and her choices, but, I must emphasize that in the interests of safety, it is not a wise choice to walk alone! And, I do not recommend such a practice to anyone. Miss Mcnfansani suggested some ways to improve the escort service and I appreciate her ideas. I agree with her that it is not wise to advise students to wait in a parking lot for the escort service. This advice is not standard operating procedure and we will instruct our student and staff operators not to issue such directions. Students who are awaiting arrival of the escort service should remain in the building and, if possible, observe from a window for the arrival of the escort van. The van operator will sound the horn, to announce arrival, and will wait for you to come out of the building. Regarding the suggestion that the van driver get out of the escort van to walk to buildings to escort the student to the yan ... such a procedure, while meritorious, would actually create greater time lag in response to service ~nests and make response times even longer. We are looking at certain areas, like the all-night study, to,devise a better way to get the student to the escort van. In these special cases, where the van cannot get close enough to the buildings, the van driver will be insll'Ucted to go to the building to esccrt the student to the van, or these requests will be handled by the security officers. Miss Monfasani further suggested that the escort service be limited to solitary females only. While this idea appears creditable and .would certainly limit the service requests, others who would be affected by such a limiting factor would have objections. Indeed. we have had criticism in the past regarding such limits. Students have requested GREEK VOLLEYBALL TOURNAMENT!!! May 25-27 that the operators not ask any qualifying questions regarding their requests for an escort as they have looked on such a practice as selective and arbitrary. We have acceded to this procedure because this is what the student community requested. When a person calls for an escort there are no qualifying questions-- just an inquiry of where you are and where you are going-- and the escort driver is dispatched. The escort service is currently operated by students under the direction and supervision of the Campus Safety Department. The service has a dedicated telephon.e number, X- 6386, which is on-line f.rom 8 p.m.-1 a.m., Sundays through Thursdays and 8 p.m.-3 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. The telephone operater and the van driver are usually students. The Campus Safety Department fulfills requests for services outside of these hours and also augments the regular service hours during high request times. The currentescort service has provided a positive service to the campus community. We will continue our efforts to self-evaluate and to listen to constructive criticism to improve. We also ask the community to assist us in our effort to serve you by your ()wn self-evaluation. Many times the escort service is abused. This service is provided as a safety measure ... not a creature comfort. Many requests are needless tax.i rides by groups moving from one social gathering to another and others are avoiding unpleasant weather conditions. We can truly reduce escort response time if the abuses are stopped! To do this we need your understanding and cooperation ... Are yo11 willing to do this? Every time the escort service is used improperly you deprive one of your peers who is relying on the service for their safety. The choice is yours... Do you want to work together for a safe campus? Respectfully, Paul F. Mantica Assistant Director Campus Operations Campus Safety and Security On Fiji's Sand Volleyball Court BE THERE!

Tile lilting \PlJatoah\ contrasted with the not-so-lilting \Russian Autumn Heart\ shows this sChizophrenia. Mus-ically, The Church remain tight as they have always been, with slow, sprawliog guitars complementing the down-to· earth rhythm section. On the faster songs, like \Transient\ and \Russian Autumn B_eart\ it tends to get .clumsy (\City\)~ The single release \Metropolis\ shows how much the· grollp has matured, despite-wandering the,if separate ways. Anyone who can couple a bright guitar fill with a chorus about the Holocaust and get away with it can do most anything. This is a new~ Church. All of their paisley. psychedelic influences have vanished (picked up by the magnificent Manchester band, The Stone Roses) and jn it's place stands a group that isn't a group. All in all, a change to be monitored on the next album.

With the bases loaded The Union College softball team is currently 8-6 this season after an intense week in which they played eight games. After a slow start and some terrible weather, the team ran off a 5-game winning streak to rescue their record and prove that they are a competitive team. The first of the eight games was a 6-1 victory over visiting Utica Tech. Union scored four runs in the 5th inning on a 2- run double by pitcher Sarah Dudzik. Roselle Eisma had one hit, one RBI, two stolen bases, and scored two runs. Robin Romer added two hits, stole a base, and scored a run of her own. On the mound, Dudzik struck out five. The next day the team defeated Si~na College, 8-6. Union's 4-run 4th inning included an RBI ~: ngle by Romer. three Siena errors, and Theresa Sanchez's single and stolen base which blew the game open and pushed the score from 4-3 to 8-3. Romer added another hit later in the game. The team then travelled to Oneonta to play on bogland. They overcame the wet field and rallied back to win ill extra innings, 10-7. Jean Lopata had two hits, Romer, Sanchez, Kathy Lawliss and Eisma all contributed a hit. Lawliss led the team with two RBis while Dudzik, Sanchez and Lopata Union then defeated New Paltz, 6-3. Again, Lopata .hit well with a double and two RB.Js. Cathy Marshall also had two RB.Is, while Romer had one. Lawliss led the team with two hits, and Sanchez and Mtrshall had one each. After a long awaited day off, the team travelled to Hamilton, wllere they split a doubleheader. Union lost the fiJst game, 2-0. Although the fielding was clean, the team's bats were slow. However, the team came back to win the second game, 4-2. Pitcher Sarah Dudzik had a no-hitter for 6-2/3 innings. Lawliss saw a :J()t of action at shortstop and had a good fielding day while getting two hits-- one of which w:~s a 5th inning double adding an RBI. Eisma had three stolen bases and scored two runs. Kirn Twombly added two hits ofher own and scored a run as welL D11dzik had a single and a 4th inning double, and Romer had an RBI single in the 7th. This past Monday, Union suffered a tough loss to Skidmore, losing by a 9-3 score. One inning of errors and walks gave the advantage. and eventually the game, to Slddmore. 'Tuesday, the team rallied back with two runs in the bottom of the 7th inning to defeat RPI, 2-1. Lawliss hit a shot to left field and, after an error, ended up on third. Romer then drove in Lawliss to tie the SPORTSWEEK Thursday, 4/26 Men's Lax at Skidmore Softball at Binghamton Friday, 4/27 Baseball vs Hamilton (2) Softball at St. Rose Golf at Williams wffrinity Saturday, 4/28 Baseball vs. St. Lawrence (2) Men's Lax vs. Colgate Men's Tennis at Hartwick Track at Hartwick Sunday, 4/29 Golf at Hartwick lnvy Monday, 4/30 Softball vs. Albany Men's Tennis vs. Albany Golf - Hartwick lnvy Tuesday, 5/1 Baseball vs. Hartwick Women's Lax vs. Hartwiclc JV Women's lax vs Hartwick Wednesday, 5/2 Men's Lax at Albany Support The Dutchmen: 3:30 3:00 1:00 5:00 1:00 1:00 2:00 1:00 12:00 3:30 3:30 3:00 6:00 7:30 3:30 WEAR WOODEN SHOES and nobody out, Kim Twombly ·hit a 1-1 .pitch to right field to drive in the g~e­ winning run. Dudzik pitched well giving up only five hits, striking out five and walking one. Can.finued from page 24 left field for a bases cleari:Qg triple. Pat Secchiaroli then came to the plate and singled in J()bnsonto take a 4-llead. In the second inning Albany sciatched up another run while the Union d¢fense began to settle in~ Deke Lincoln made a diving play on a shot to third base and Albany remained quiet. In the botton'& of the inning Bill Brundige .got his second hit of the game, a don:ble. and two, batters later Dek:e Lincoln singled him in. Lincoln went on to score also, f()llow:lng Mario DeLotetto's second hit of the game. Following a run in the third for Albany, Union held a 6-3 lead which remained until the seventh inning. Albany posted a rally in the 8e'Venth and tied the score at six stealing on a horrendous call by ·the .second base umpire. Union turned away Albany in the t()p of the tenth and Johnson led off the bottom of the inning with a walk. With one out, the Albany ca~cher made an ettant throw down to . first in an attempt to pic]c off Johnson. By the time the ball was picked up by the right fielder, Johnson was sliding into third base. MaFk Callahan then laid down a perfect squeeze bunt and Union came away with the victory, 7-6. Over the past week, many players have shone on the field. Twombly's game-winning hit is one example. Sophomore Sarah Dudzik has pitched to every batter in every game. Lawliss had a very consistent week in the field and in the batter's box. Eisma has played a solid center field, robbing many opposing batters of hits. Romer threw out all batters who attempted to steal and played tough behind the plate. Lopata has come through in the clutch with big hits. The double play against Skidmore (from Lawliss to Lopata to Marshall) shows how well the team works together. Romer and Eisma have combined for 24 stolen bases-- Eisma is 12- 14 and Romer was not thrown out, going a perfect 12-12. . . rums each, which lasted until the tenth.

The Channel You Ju.st.Can't Chan.ge By ANDY BRAVER Sports Editor The National Football League held its annual college draft this past Sunday u1cJ Monday, and ESPN covered its f'lrst 6-1/2 hours live Sunday aftern.oon. What might seeiil the biggest non-event in television sports to moS1 observers is something whi<:h many football fans long. for. They watch it, and watch it, and keep watching it, and they don't see any crunching hits or long bombs. The draft has developeed a loyal cult following, playi11g off the ht~ge popularity of the NFL and the strong publicity and sharp :production by ES?N, which has been televising the draftsince 1980. For the all-sports cable network, as well as the NFL, the draft has become a valuable property. The NFL charged ESPN a fee of $250,0()0 to televise the event this year, and a similar fee for last year's TV rights. Prior to that, the draft rights were given by the NFL to ESPN for free. When ESPN took the air Sunday afternoon, it had a lineup which included eight commentators: regular anchors Chris Berman and Robin Roberts, former NFL players Joe Th.eisrnann and 'Tom Jackson~ scouting expert M~l Kiper, inside tipster Fred Edelstein, veteran analy~t Beano Cook and <S,porL~ Illustrated> reporter Pa11l Zimmerman. It also had Hve reports from seven locatio11s around the country, includin~ the -draft headquarters of tb.e Atlanta Falcons, Dallas Cowboys, Seattle Seahawk:s and Green Bay Packers. Tb~y tated players by position, gave continuous updates ()f tile round-.by-round picks, aad revie.wed most of the picks in the first two rounds as tbey occured. There were also several special segments, including an analysis of former Saa Francisco coach Bill Walslt's draft success with the 49ers~ the impact of col'lege underclassmen on this year's draft and how a team prepares for the draft. ESPN reporter · Jimtny Roberts spent the day at Spindler's Lounge in Scrant()n, PA, a restaurant owned by George Spindler, fatller of University of Pittsbaugh defensive tackle Marc Spindler, wh() was projected to go lligh in the draft. He did, but IlOt high enough. Spindler was selected by the Detroit Lions in the third round, minutes after ESPN's live coverage ended. Despite all of the manpower and money NFL teams spend in perparation, the dtaft is a guessing game that intrigues team personnel, athletes, and fans alike. And ESPN plays directly into the guessing game. Two years ago, ESPN was so certain that running back Thurman Thomas of Oklahoma State would be a high pick that it dispatched reporter Andrea Kremer to Thomas' home in Missouri for what was expected. to be a post- selection interview early in the broadcast. But Thomas didn't go until midway through the second round-- the Bills made him the 40th pick overall-- and Kremer wound up sitting idle most of the day. Jimmy Roberts was not sitting idle on Sunday (he interviewed Marc Spindler about four times), but he was sitting. and waiting all afternoon. ESPN's ratings for the draft coverage have steadily increased over the years. The NFL cooperated two years ago when they moved the first day of the draft from Tuesday to Sunday in order to increase the audience of fans watching from home. One reason for the increased popularity of ESPN's telecast is the vicarious experience it provides for football fans. It is the one day every football fan gets to become the general manager and coach of their favorite team. They get to agree or disagree with every selection made in determining the future of \their\' franchise. But to get to that point of agreement or criticism takes a long afternoon of avid draft watching. There is a fifteen minute quagmire between picks in the frrst round, and it seems much longer than that because the moment of truth, the selection of a player, takes only a few second to complete. To sit, and watch,' and listen, and ponder along with the ESPN commentators takes a strong will and an avid love for the game of football. You want desperately to hit the fast- forward buttoll, or at least put on a tape of a game from last season just so you can see a football in the air and hear the crack of a helmet hitting pads: You feel like you have to oo something. But yoll can't. Yo11 watch. And wait. And realize that the NFL and ESPN have you at their fingertips. And wait. r

Baseball Team Ba.ck On Right Track B-, MARK ZIMMERMAN Sports Editor The baseball team put a mini-slump bellind ~hem and began the new week with a big victory over Albany State on a squeeze bunt in the bottom of the tenth inning. The team began the season by winning four of it& first five, but then dropped three of its next four to give them a 5-4 record. Over the past week, Union faced three tough squads. St. Rose handed tile Dutchmen a 14-1 loss. However, St. Rose is a Division I power with a scholarship program and a very deep bench. While there were few highlights for the Union, Joe Mauro went two for three and Dave Dingman pitched four innings, striking out four and walking none. Union's next opponent, North Adams was also a quality team tllat is considered among the elite in Division III. Union was in the game most of the way and was trailing 7-5 before 'North Adams put it away with three additional runs. Offensively, Mike Johnson was two for four with two RBis, Deke Lincoln was three for five and Mario DiLoretto was two for four with one RBI and two runs I \ J... <a 0 Union 10 Union 6 Hami~on 2 Union 4 Skidmore 9 Union 2 St. Rose 14 North Adams 1 0 Middlebury 6 Union 10 Union 7 Skidmore 8 scored. The Dutchmen travelled to Middlebury over the weekend and split a doublehead~r. Neither team played exceptionally well. Mark Callahan pitched a five hitter but the Dutchmen struggled defensively and lost by a score of 6-3. In the second game, Union trounced the Panthers, 10-0. It was the team·s first shutout of the season. Marco Mancuso pitched a three hitter giving up only one walk while striking out four. Offensively, the Dutchmen had 11 hits and 10 walks. Bobby Anderson and Craig Bronder were each two for four with two RBis and one run scored, respectively. Mike Johnson was two for three with two RBis and two runs scored. This past Tuesday, Union beat Albany, 7-6, in ten innings and improved their record to 6-4. The teamjumped out in front early. sending nine men to the plate in the first inning and scoring four runs. The big blow came after Bill Brundige and Joe Mauro singled and Mario DiLoretto walked to load the bases.

Union, well aware of its need for wins. came out strong right from the beginning. John Keller. Union's leading scorer, opened up the scoring with a superb individual effort. About half- way through the first period, RPI tie-d up the game on a bounce shot from 10 yards out. With about one minute left in the first quarter Scott Daniels cut to his right, beat his defender. and bounced a bard shot by the goalie from about 15 yards out. In the second quarter,. Tim Fisher set up tile play from behind the net as he passed the ball to Daniels in the high slot. Daniels fired a quick release past the goalie for his sec<Jnd goal of the game. RPI followed up with a score late in the half. Freshman goalie Bill VanOrder made a big save at the end of the h.alf to keep the game at 3-2. Union pulled away in the third quarter. Nathan Fitch assisted on Keller's second goal of the game. Once again RPI tried to stay in the game as they tallied to make it 4-3. Union came right back off the face-off and started up field. Daniels penetrated the defense with his pass to Fitch. Fitch flipped it back to Alan Fleischer who one timed into the open net to cap off a beautiful team effort. Fitch controlled the play again as he fed Jon Gargiulo streaking in on t.4e wing. Gargiulo fired it into the lower left comer. Union opened up the game even more as Denny Baldwin picked up a loose ball and shot 1t to the far post past the goalie to make it 7-3. In the fourth quarter, RPI cut the lead with a couple of goals, but Union held firm as Tim Fisher iced the game with an excellent individual effort. Union had come away with an 8-6 victory, but more importantly a victory over their leading Capital Cup rival. Union is looking to win its fifth consecutive Capital Cup as they are 2-0 in the standings. Union controlled the tempo right from the outset. Their zone defense continually frustrated the RPI attackers as they were not able to get many quality chances from in close. Steve Garnett, Mike Richardson, Pat Lawson, and Joe Goethe all played .solid defense and were there to break up several potential chances. Although they only scored eight goals, the Union offense played: an excellent game; The RPI goalie kept his team in the game single-handedly as he came up with 20 saves. Coach Priore was very ])leased with his team's overall e:ffcrt as they played consistent and controlled the game. Union's record 11ow stands at 6-3. In previous games. Union got a solid effort as they beat Hartwick. Siena, Rochester~ and St. Lawrence. Union was locked in a tight match with Mi<Wlebury as they went into overtime. Middlebury :prevailed - wit!J. only 18 sec:Onds left in the ()Vertime period. This past week, Union lost to Williams. The squad bouncedb~k with a · win over Hamilton. The remaining games against Skidmore. Colgate;, and Albany are important gartnes if Union is to advance to J>QSt,-season play. Junior .goalie Brian Lucey is scheduled to start on Thursday against ~kidmore and Sat11rday's home ~arne against Colgate. The bulk of the. scoring this season has been .provided by Junior John Keller. Through these fust nine games he has scored 26 goals and 22 assists for 48 points. He is extremely effective as he co11trols tbe play and darats in fr()nt for some quality chances. Freshman Nathan Fitch has added 33 points and Junior Alan Fleischer has put-op 13 points. Senior Captains Steve Garnett and Nick Baratoff are hoping to lead Union to an ECAC berth. 5 Football Players Receive All-American Honors By ANDY BRAVER Sports Editor Five members of the 1989 Union football team were voted All-Americans earlier this week.

In response to the student protest, President Stephen Webber agreed to establish task forces to assess the school's judicial process. and to advise him on racial issues on campus. The two white students were punished for altering a h11nting regulations sign to read. \Hunting Season on all Niggers,\ and displaying it in their dormitory.

The two smdents Marxism And The American Professor By JOHN P. ROCHE Distributed by Collegiate Network To say there are more Marxists at an annual meeting of the American Sociological Association than there are now in Eastern Europe is merely to utter a truism. But the closer you look at the views of these self-styled American radicals, the more you have to wonder about two crucial questions. First, what precisely do they mean when they call themselves \Marxists\? Second, what has led them to worship at the shrine of a minor 19th century economic and social thinker? When I was young in the late 1930s and first entered into rhetorical combat with Marxists, one thing could surely be said: these characters had read Marx and read him closely. Nevertheless, they managed to disagree about most things. There was a basic consensus· on one item, however; Marx (as Engles put it 1883 speaking at Marx's grave) was the Charles Darwin of social science, the man who had discovered the fundamental laws of historical change. These laws doomed the capitalist to destruction as inexorably as Darwin's \survival of fittest\ prescription doomed the dinosaurs. This vision w~ not based on personal anirrwsity-- after all, Marx and Engels had nothing but praise for the capitalist mission in. the Manifesto - but rather on the belief that history vvas a script in five acts which human decision could in no way alter or rewrite.

Page 4 CONCORDIENSlS, April 12, 199lJ FEATURES Where Are We Going? BY SUZANNE SHAKER Features Editor It is inevitable that all institutions must change. In gene.ral most of us are resistant to change and see it in a negative light. Union College is just one of many institutions that over the years has tried to improve itself, academically, socially and economically. Yet for all of us who are part of this college community, Union is not simply a statistic, h is not just one of many changing institutions, Union is our school, it is our home away from home, it is a very crucial four years of our life, it is our investment, it holds the key to our future. Therefore it is important for all nf us to stop and ask, where are we going? What is in store for us? Are we following a path that is leading us in the right direction? We are all very concerned with our own personal futures, but how concerned are we for the future of Union once we move on and leave Union behind? Although Union will not be the center of our lives once we graduate, most of us will always feel a sense of attachment to Union and it will always remain important to us. It seems as though Union is slowly losing a great deal of its tradition. Changes that the administration considers necessary and/or beneficial are gradually chipping away at those elements which are uniquely characteristic of Union. Although we all refer to the College Center as Carnegie to those who lrnew Union during the days of the original Carnegie th.is new .building. doesn't even come close. The charm and beauty of the old b1:1ilding's architecture has been replace by a much more impersonal modem design. The original pub, which was adorned with. Tiffany lamps and mahogany tables has been replaced by the e~tremely ordinary and bland Dutch Hollow. In a sense I feel cheated, never having had the chance to experience such a special aspect of Union. Let us hope that the same is not in store for the Nott Memorial. Structurally the old Carnegie was on its last legs, which is why it finally had to be destroyed. My question is why couldn't the new College Center have been constructed to resemble the old, but well loved Carnegie as much as possible? Presently the Nott is in very poor condition. We walk by it today and see the wooden structwe that has been erected to support its crumbling foundation after part of .the building collapsed this past summer. It is obvious that the Nott is in dire need of restoration. But until the Nott is restored Union will not be able to take full advantage of this incredible structure.

The warm color of the buildings, probably from pollution, and its location add to the exitement of seeing it. The Acropolis (hill) sticks right up in the air from the city below as does the monastery (Lykavittos) on another hill within Athens. the men in the Mayor's office. There was plenty of space and mirrors ami there was a large bathroom with modern plumbing whicll is always welcomed. Roula enj()yed watching the girts getting r.eady f~r the concert and gave h~r opinion on hair styles when asked. We trooped back t() the hall in time for the concert and tllis audience was fantastic~ They were already revved by tb.e time they got to the Hall. We could tell that it was g€>ing to be one of those great nights when nothing was going to go wrong. And so it was! . (5) The next day we fenied across the \Jaws of Coril)th\ ~ bus and all, and disembarked on the north sliore of the Corinthian gulf. The scenery is spectacular with the gulf itself, ~:' ruins. Nobody was very enthus,iastic as we are somewhat tired and we've seen many ruills,but Hugh bellows, \Follow me.\ So we do and instead of beading downhill to ruins we cr()ssed the road to the Kasta1ian Spring. Now we're talking. This is the place. These are the \Delphic waters.\ This. is Wliere Pythia and her s·uppliants underwent purification before approaching the oracl'e. Fitzhugh Ludlow has been here. We can feel his presence. We gather around the spot and J()hn, our Alum, leads us in song and an \Ode to Old Union\ echoes throughout the valley. \It bring the tears to me eyes,\ as once. an old Irishman exclaimed. It was a wonderful moment on the trip. Hugh ~:xclaims, \The alma The bus contained fifteen students (two would join us at JFK.) one Cllair, one Alumnus, one assistant, one pianist, and three camp followers. Our journey would take us to Athens, Crete and the Peloponnesus. Five concerts were scbeduled, several unplanned concerts occurred, innumerable rehearsals took place, archeological sites and museums were visited, and celebratory post-concert feasts were experienced. Dancing, wine-tasting, mopeding, women, men, and all kinds of exotica were encountered on tllis trip. (2) The first concert in Crete was scheuled for 9:00. It was held in a basilica which is now used for non-religious purposes. It was a huge space compared to the Helleni&tic Society Hall, but the sound was rich here as well. A very large audience turned out for this performance and afterwards we were &11 guests of the Cultural Officer of Iraklion, Mr. Thoulgherakis, at a dinner in a nearby restaurant named appropriately enough, The Knossos. The local chorus joined the dignitaries and there were many toasts of appreciation to the \maestro\, (Hugh) and to Mr. T. and Jennifer, our trusty leader, presented Mr. T with a Union College plate. The local chorus sang some songs and we sang some songs and the wine flowed, the food flowed and a fine time was had by all. road to Epidaurus where the theatre, built in 4th century B.C., is still in very good shape. The legend is acoustical. If a coin is dropped center stage it can be heard clearly in the very last seat of the auditorium and we learned that this was true. Hugh bade that the choir sing at this historic site and they did and it was wonderful. We could hear every word perfectly even though we were way up in the \cheap\ seats. The view from the theatre is mindboggling. You look over hills and valleys. the smell of pine is in the air and the air itself is very crisp and clean. The choir sang the Union College alma mater. The audience of tourists loved the show. They clapped for more. Our group sang several selections including America, the Beautiful and Anna and David sang the duet from Mozart's Don Giovanni. (4) The next day we journeyed to a resort town on the Corinthian gulf. We arrived at the Hotel Florida and we were their first guests of the season! They had just opened the hotel that morning, the pool was still being filled with water. Some of us rushed into the small town nearby for lunch (the hotel wasn't ready yet) and enjoyed one of the best meals of our whole Grecian visit. The seafood was fresh, the bread was fresh, the wine was very good, even the potatoes were fresh and good. We have a concert this evening in Egion.

The concert is to be held in a restored building around the comer. It is the center of all the arts activity of the town and we could hear a band rehearsing upstairs. The hall is very nice, newly painted, and two beautiful crystal chandeliers, donated by some of the wealthier residents of the town, dominate the hall. The town looks quite prosperous. Once again, Hugh is pleased with the sound. We are having good luck with acoustics on this trip. We returned to the Town Hall where the women were to the hillsides, the Venetian fortifications, the white houses dotting the shore and clustered al'()und small bays~ We head for Delphi. We have an appOintment witb the Orac:le, but by the time we get there he is out to luncll. Nevertheless we enjoyed the site, the Temple of Apollo, the Stadium, the theatte-- all piled up on this steep hillside-- wllat an engineering feat that must have been. We visited the mt~seum and saw one of the best statues encountered on trus trip~ .. The Charioteer. He is definitely worth the trip. He was all shiny gold polislled bronze in his original state, but he still looked good even though the bronze is now green. They keep digging 11p m()re pieces.

By RENATE THIERMANN With the .relection on the question of wh() needs poetry nowadays anyway, German poel Geertje PoU!Sh-Suhr began her poetry reading on Friday, March 8, which-- judging from the audience's very positive reaction-~ certainly was not designed to answer that question in the negative. sentimentalism on the one hand and witty ircmy on the other hand that is highly typical of German romanticism. It is the allusion to and the transformation of the traditional German literary heritage such as fairy tales. folk songs, and the classic type of Naturlyrik as proposed by Goethe and his followers that Potash-S uhr takes as point of departure for ma11y of her poems which juxtapose this cultural heritage against modem twentieth century urban life in America and.elsewhere. such themes as unhappy love, the difficult relationship towards her mother, the problems .of getting older and her reaction to the threat of nuclear war. This Week in the Wor·ld Potash-Suhr, who was born in Germany. but studied in Switzerland and has lived in Chicago for nearly 20 years now, had started writing poems after having comp-leted her doctoral thesis on German romanticist poet Heinrich Heine. Heine's influence can be traced in the intricately woven texture of her poems which display that curious mixture of melancholy. even But her theme.s are not confined to the contrast between America .lllld Europe, urban life versus ru:rallife, city versus nature. Instead, Potash- Suhr revealed a lot of .her own experiences, feelings, and anxieties when dwelling upon What was particularly attracting to the audience during the reading was Mrs. Potash-Suhr's impressive and lively way of commenting upon her own poems, which often show complex syntactic and metaphorical patterns. The 'personal touch' of her frank, vivid, but nonetlleless humorous comments which were at times spiced with amusing self-irony made her reading a really special event. We can only hope that she will not stick to what she claimed was her future prospective now that she is already W()rking on her second novel: namely, no more writing poetry.

'. Page 8 INTERNA'TIONAL FEATURES Rev. Coffin S s Out By DAVID SHERMAN Last Sunday at eight o'clock, a near capacity crowd gathered in Memorial Chapel to hear the Reverend William Sloan Coffin speak on uPeace and Sccial Justice\. Rev. Coffin set a humorous yet realistic tone for the evening at the start of his speech. He told the audience he thought it was kind of them to let him speak at Union, \considering mcst of our graduates are part of the problem\. Combining his wit and insightful vision, Rev. Coffin spoke on the problems which the world will have to face in the coming decade, and the solution to these proNems. The first part of the Reverend's speech focused on the disappearing ideals in American society. He asked how Americans hold on to \ their ideals at a time when we have been taught to place our own happiness and success before the well being of cur fellow men. Telling his listeners that, \Education kills by degree,\ he said that students come to college with both ambition and ideals, however, eventually the student places ideology aside in order to pursue ambition and the thirty thousand dollar a year salary which the student desires. Rev. Coffin claimed this is because \What the United States promotes as its belief and what it rewards are two different things.\ \The winds of change were blowing in gale force, and in a good directione\ The second subject of Rev. Coffin's speech was \new politics in a new world\. Here, Rev. Coffin's discourse became one of optimism. He affirmed his belief that humans could face the challenges that lay before them and succeed in creating a better world. Yet, along with this optimism, were words of warning about the impending doom the world faces if we fail to deal responsibly with the problems the human race has created for itself. N<M SE.l H\.~~ ... CRU~I-/ING llEMo<..nAc~ IS NOT SOMlTHINC:. t APDRO'IE Of 8VT W£ c4N .sm1. oe. FRr£tll)5 crw'r we? Rev. Coffin stated that \The winds of change were blowing in gale force, and in a. good direction.\ He sighted the pro- democracy movements which have swept across Eastern Europe, the free elections in Nicaragua, and the liberation of Nelson Mandela as reasons for being optimistic that our:' world is moving in a positive direction. But, he also warned that \Solutions cause problems.\ With the world changing so rapidly, the United States must alter its policies in order to help with these changes. According to Rev. Coffin, \This new world is in need of new politics.\ While President Bush claims to be \cautious nat reckless\ Rev. Coffin accused him of being \recklessly cautious\. He declared that the cold war was over and that, \It is time to vote out the Cold war warriors\ explaining to his audience that the only country to win the Cold War was Japan. The time has come for America to adjust its view .of the world and start to live up to its professed ideals. The speaker then began to espouse the need for the United States to view the world as a whole, and not as separate nations with unrelated interests. Problems such as the hazards of disappearing rain forests in Brazil, nuclear meltdowns and nuclear winters, affect all humans on earth.. Rev. Coffin warned that if the world powers do not alter their Japanese Language and Culture at Susquehanna University · From July 23 to August 15, 1990, Susquehanna University, at Selinsgrove, PA •. will off~r an intensive program in Japanese language and culture.

If the United States does not make the first move, other countries will continue to stockpile nuclear and chemical weapons as well as pollute tlte earth. . The final major problem which Rev. Coffin sighted was the \tragically persistent poverty\ which most of ·the world's population endures. He noted the ever widening gap between the rich and poor. stating that while one third ·Of the world is wealthy the other twoJhirds of the warld lives in poverty. Rev. Coffin declareg that these problems can be_ solved if the nations of the world: surrender some of their autonomy so that the United Nations can be stronger and more effective and if these nations redirect funds from their defense budgets toward the ecological and economical troubles which the world is facing. Rev. Coffin asserted that while the United States spends 150 billion dollars annually on defense in Europe alone, it would only take 77 billion dollars annually over a period of ten yem:s to reforest the earth, stop soil erosion, increase energy production and create affordable, renewable energy. A stronger United Nations would be able to enforce the laws that would have to be created before these changes can occur. Governments of the first world \fear the poor more than pi.ty them'' William Coffin accused the current world leadership as being \more concerned with disorder than with injustice.\ He said that the governments of the first world \fear the poor more than pity th.em.'; If change is to come about these attitudes must be altered. We must recognize that the world we live in belongs to all of us and that as Rev. Coffin said, ttJustice is an idea whose time has come.\ The Union community owes thanks to S.P.A.A., the Office of the President, the Campus Protestant Ministry, the Student Forum, the Student Activities Office, the History and Economics Departments, the LE.F.,. and the First Reformed Church for making Rev. Coffin's inspiring visit possible. On Tuesday, April 17, 1990, the Modern Languages Department will sponsor a lecture entitled \Glasnost\ and perestroika in literature\ by Professor Yurii Tomashevskii, a visiting scholar from the Soviet Union. The lecture will take place at 4:30 p.m. in the. Musi~ room. of Schaffer Libracy and will be deltvered m Russtan with a parallel translation by Dr. Linda Scatton of SUNY-Albany. · Professor Tomashevskii is a graduate of the School of Journalism at Moscow State University, a member of the Writers' Union, and a teacher in the modern literature section of the Gorky Institute of W or!d :l(iteratu;re in Moscow. He is the Soviet Unton s leading expert on Mikhail Zoshchenko (a Russian satirical writer ·extremely popular in the 1920s and 193~s w~o~ . together with Anna ~m~tova, felt ~he rron fiSt of Soviet repress1on 1n the mtd-1940s) .. Profes.sor Tomashevsk:i:i is currently heavily involved in preserving Zoshchenko:s archive and literary heritage. In his lecture he wlll concentrate on the return of earlier omissions from the Soviet literary scene an~ the appearance of new na~es and books. He will also touch upon the question of Socialist Realism: was there really ever any such thing? It promises to be a fascinating lecture. All are cordially welcome.

The professors, Frank Wicks and C. Subba Reddy, both of Niskayuna, will do energy conservation and generation research and keep track of research developments in heat- transfer technology related to the cooling of electric power equipment. This is the first research contract th.e College has received from the coFpOration, accotding to Frank Milillo, chairman of the Mechanical Engineering Department. The professors are working on several engineering projects that they have proposed to Niagara Mohawk for possible funding under the contract. Wicks currently is involved in three projects: the development of a more en.ergy- efficient hybrid vehicle powered by natural gas, steam and electricity; the testing of a manufacturer's claims for a new heaL exchanger; and a natural- gas-powered air conditioning system that combines compression and absorption methods of cooling. Wicks said that the vehicle project is aimed at extending the distance the vehicle can tra'lel per unit of natural gas, thereby remedying the too- frequent refuelings that have been a problem with natural- gas-powered vehicles. Exhaust heat would be used to generate steam power to help run the vehicle. An electric motor would kick in to assist when the engine faces peak demands, but energy would be recovered by batteries when the vehicle is stopped or going downhill. He said he expects the air conditioning system to be twice as fuel efficient as electrical systems and to use no electricity, thereby reducing the traditionally high demand for electricity during the cooling season. In the project, Wicks is continuing work on an air conditioner he already has patented. Reddy is working on solar- powered wind turhinc for the generation of electricity. He said the turbine would be driven by rising hot air heated by sunlight. He also is doing research on the running of internal combustion engines with·out cooling systems as a method of increasing their efficiencies and with exhaust-driven turbinesas an additional.power source. Reddy said advances in materials manufacturing have created materials that are able to withstand higher temperatures. Operating the engines at higher tempertures automatically will increase their efficiency, he said. In addition, the hotter exhaust gases could be used to drive a turbine. Wicks and Reddy will be expected to publish the results of their research. A number of students are fulfilling their senic;r mechanical engineering project requirement by assisting the professors.

Page 12 CONCORDIENSIS, April 12~ 1990 dtllttfJlrhirttsis ----Founded at Union College 1877--- Would We Have Killed Ceaucescu? As students in Europe and Asia are on the vanguard of social and political change around the world, we can only be thankful that the totalitarian dictatorships were not waiting for Union College students. to overturn them. In casual conversation, it is taken for granted that Union students are apathetic. Political issues that affect everyone are almost never discussed, to the point that they seem to be unnoticed. It is disheartening when a political science professor tells his students that they have to read a newspaper, and yet this actually happens. One does not expect that Union students will have a great impact on world events, but soon we will be Union graduates, and if we do not have an impact, then who will? The College offers numerous opportunities for its students to become involved with, or at least aware of, outside events, and yet participation is often alarmingly low. Last Sunday at Memorial Chapel, Reverend Willian1 Sloan Coffin spoke about what each of us can do to help the planet. It was an entertaining speech, and, whether you agreed with him or not, he undoubtedly addressed issues which affect each of us. The attendance figure of about 600 is impressive, but the fact remains that only about one-third of those were Union students. There was no shortage of publicity for the event, as posters and other notices had decorated the campus weeks in advance. No one can possibly say that they are not aware of when Minerva hours are, they are every Thursday, usually in the College Center auditorium. For example, this Thursday morning, there was a lecture on \Hobbes's Ambiguous Politics,\ which no doubt had great relevance to the crisis situation currently in Lithuania. At the time of publication, we do not know what the turnout for the discussion will have been, but judging by past lectures~ we can guess that seating was not a problem. This past Tuesday, Gabor Mahalyi, a Hungarian journalist, had lunch with the Concordiensis staff as part of his week-long visit to Union. In the course of our conversation, Mr. Mahalyi asked about the degree of activism on the Union campus. We were embarrassed to report that, unlike in his native Hungary, student activism is almost nonexistent. It is not necessary for us to overthrow our government, but it would be nice if we all knew who was in it. More Than Just Tractor Pulls There is actually a lot to do in the Capital District. Every week, dozens of pieces of mail pour into the Concordiensis mailbox., describing and promoting events taking place in the area. It is the job of our staff to select and print those events that they feel might most appeal to the Union community. There are countless numbers of rallies, seminars, special speakers, concerts, plays and various other activities in Albany and the area that surrounds. It might not be New York or Boston. but if you take the time, you will see that there is more to see than just Vooreon the transforming monster truck. LETTERS Date Rape Victims Have Other Options To the Editors: I am writing in response to your recent editorial concerning date rape. In your commentary, a controversial Albany date rape trial was linked to a recent situation on campus in which a woman made an anonymous accusation against a fellow student. Your editorial did injustice to the victims of this horrendous crime. Rape is a crime of vtolence which degrades its victims. \Date\ rape is even more traumatic than· \stranger\ rape because the attacker is someone the woman knows and trusts. It is very hard for a woman to accept the fact that an acquaintance, perhaps even a boyfriend, could violate her body and her trust. The betrayal . that date rape represents can lead to an initial denial by the victim that she was raped. It can take weeks or even months for the woman to admit to herself that what occurred was rape. Another important aspect of date rape is the physical evidence that a crime has been committed. Unless the attacker used excessive force, there would be no physical manifestations of violence such as cuts or bruises. Likewise, unless the victim ·receives medical attention immediately after the attack there will be no gynecological evidence that intercourse has occurred. If a woman comes forward and says Letters to the Editor do not necessarily reflect the • • OplDIODS of the Editorial Board. she has beea the victim of date rape, :she sheuld not be criticized because there is no physic~l evidence or because she did n()t act immediately. Most ~rape victims do not report tile attack because of the stigma. that our society has attached tc rape and . rape victims. A victim who comes forwar<t should be praised for her co1m1ge, not criticized. The eW:torial also urged the Unioru woman to identify herself so that the Admi11istration could take action .. She should do what is best for her own situation, no matter wllat her friends, the AdmLilis.tl'ation or the Conc()rdy thinks she should do. It is imiJortant for her to Jmow that th.'(1i:e are several courses of action !lvaaable to her. She can go to tile Dean in person and he will corLtinue his inquiry into tile incident. She can report tile event to the Schelll~tady police and press criminal charges against her attack:e1. The woman can also seek tC()un.seling, either from the College's Counseling Cente1 .or Planned Parenthood's Rape Crisis Service. B.oth of these ~ervices can further advise her about her options and help her to <:ome to tenns with the rape. Wllether or not she chooses to take .action against her rapist, the woman should consider receiving counseling. Rape is a very traumatic experience and the recovery period can be quite lengthy. Co:unseling can help the victim come to terms with her rape and begin to rebuild her life. National statistics show that 25% of all college women will be the victims of rape or attempted rape by the time they graduate. We would like to believe that Union is immune from such events, but it is not. As students we can do something to change this. The male students must realize that a woman's body is her own. Unless she explicitly agrees to intercourse, he cannot assume that she is willing; any action he takes based upon this assumption is rape. women must understand that if they say \NO\ and men force them · to have sex it is rape; the fact that the attacker is someone you know does not make it any less of a crime. If URion students can accept these facts, date rape has a chance to disappear from our campus. Sincerely, Mary Jo Conley '90 For The Women's Union ~-~--------~-----.

Page 12 CONCORDIENSIS, April 12, l!J90 <ltnnrorbirttsis LETTERS ----Founded at Union College 1877--- Date Rape Victims Have Other Options Would We Have Killed Ceaucescu? As students in Europe and Asia are on the vanguard of social and political change around the world, we can only be thankful that the totalitarian dictatorships were not waiting for Union College students to overturn them. In casual conversation, it is taken for granted that Union students are apathetic. Political issues that affect everyone are almost never discussed, to the point that they seem to be unnoticed. It is disheartening when a political science professor tells his students that they have to read a newspaper, and yet this actually happens. One does not expect that Union students will have a great impact on world events, but soon we will be Union graduates, and if we do not have an impact, then who will? The College offers numerous opportunities for its students to become involved with, or at least aware of, outside events, and yet participation is often alarmingly low. Last Sunday at Memorial Chapel, Reverend William Sloan Coffin spoke about what each of us can do to help the planet. It was an entertaining speech, and, whether you agreed with him or not, he undoubtedly addressed issues which affect each of us. The attendance figure of about 600 is impressive, but the fact remains that only about one-third of those were Union students. There was no shortage of publicity for the event, as posters and other notices had decorated the campus weeks in advance. No one can possibly say that they are not aware of when Minerva hours are, they are every Thursday, usually in the College Center auditorium. For example, this Thursday morning, there was a lecture on \Hobbes's Ambiguous Politics,\ which no doubt had great relevance to the crisis situation currently in Lithuania. At the time of publication, we do not know what the turnout for the discussion will have been, but judging by past lectures, we can guess that seating was not a problem. This past Tuesday, Gabor Mahalyi, a Hungarian journalist, had lunch with the Concordiensis staff as part of his week-long visit to Union. In the course of our conversation, Mr. Mahalyi asked about the degree of activism on the Union campus. We were embarrassed to report that, unlike in his native Hungary, student activism is almost nonexistent. It is not necessary for us to overthrow our government, but it would be nice if we all knew who was in it. More Than Just Tractor Pulls There is actually a lot to do in the Capital District. Every week, dozens of pieces of mail pour into the Concordiensis mailbox, describing and promoting events taking place in the area. It is the job of our staff to select and print those events that they feel might most appeal to the Union community. There are countless numbers of rallies, seminars, special speakers, concerts. plays and various other activities in Albany and the area that surrounds. It might DOt be New York or Boston, but if you take the time, you will see that there is more to see than just Vooreon the transforming monster truck. To the Editors: I am writing in response to your recent editorial concerning date rape. In your commentary, a controversial Albany date rape trial was linked to a recent situation on campus in which a woman made an anonymous accusation against a fellow student. Your editorial did injustice to the victims of this horrendous crime. Rape is a crime of violence which degrades its victims. \Date\ rape is even more traumatic than· \stranger\ rape because the attacker is someone the woman knows and trusts. It is very hard for a woman to accept the fact that an acquaintance, perhaps even a boyfriend, could violate her body and her trust. The betrayal that date rape represents can lead to an initial denial by the victim that she was raped. It can take weeks or even months for the woman to admit to herself that what occurred was rape. Another important aspect of date rape is the physical evidence that a crime has been committed. Unless the attacker used excessive force, there would be no physical manifestations of violence such as cuts or bruises. Likewise, unless the victim receives medical attention immediately after the attack there will be no gynecological evidence that intercourse has occurred. If a woman comes forward and says Letters to the Editor do not necessarily reflect the • • OpllllODS of the Editorial Board.

Most rape victims do not report the attack because of the stig~:na that our society has attached to rape and rape victims. A victim who comes forward should he praised for her courage, not criticized. The editorial also urged the Union woman to identify herself so that the Administration could take action. She should do what is best for her own situation, no matter what her friends, the Administration or the Concordy thinks she should do. It is important for her to know that there are several courses of action available to her. She can go to the Dean in person and he will continue his inquiry into the incident. She can report the event to the Schenectady police and press criminal charges against her attacker. The woman can also seek counseling, either from the College's Counseling Center or Planned Parenthood's Rape Crisis Service. Both of these services can further advise her about her options and help her to come to terms with the rape. Whether or not she chooses to take action against Associare Acbrdmtl! Business Manager Subscription Marulger Honorary Faculty Advisor · her rapist, the woman should consider receiving cmmseling. Rape is a very traumatic experience and the recovery period can be quite lengthy. Counseling can help the victim come to terms with her rape and begin to rebuild her life. National statistics show that 25% of all coUege women wUI be the vktims of rape or attempted rape by the time they graduate. W e wonld like to believe that Union is imm·une from such events, but it is not. As students we can do some1hing to change this. The male students must realize that a woman's body is her own. Unless she explicitly agrees to intercourse, he cannot assume that she is willing; any action he takes based upon this assumption is rape. Women must understand that if they say \NO\ and men force them to have sex it is rape; the fact that the attacker is someone you know does not make it any less of a crime. If Union students can accept these facts, date rape has a chance to disappear from our campus. Sincerely, Mary Jo Conley '90 For The Women's Union Laurel Alessio SllZalltie Glass Pamela Haber c.

To the Editor: After reading Brad Mondschein's leue.-, \Bigotry Like Blindness ~ But Less Colorful'' {Concordiensis, March 8, p. 12), one is forced to ask some· soul-searching questions. His letter states: \The recent wave of bigotry and ignorance on this campus is appalling.\ What wave? What bigotry? What on earth is he talking about? Mr. Mondschein cites no real-life, specific incidents or events to justify his claim. \The articles written in various publications on campus show a stn~ng resentment among the white majority of the campus of the strides that minorities are making in the United States.\ A claim is surely invalid when an author does not r~fer to articles and writers by name but instead attacks what he perceives to be a \recent wave.\ Unless the People's Daily World is on your weekly reading list, there are only two regular campus publications. How can Mr. Mondschein expect the campus to take his assertion of a \wave of bigotry\ seriously without a citation, or any kind of proof at aU? Without justification, Mr. Mondschein has accused the white students on campus of being bigoted and resentful of minori~y students. This is an outrage. It appears that Mr. Mondschein is. attempting to make an argument in favor of affirmative action for racial minorities at Union College. Instead of making a constructive case for the program, he derides its critics, calling them \bigoted and short-sighted\ and noting that they live in \an empty and dark place of hatred.\ It is true that perhaps some in this nation oppose affirmative action because of racism. If anyone were to assert such an argument in our debate (which I believe no one would do) their opinion would be appropriately denounced. But there are some who oppose affirmative action because· they ~ --_.:' - :·-;, .. believe it is an improper or ineffective way to fight racial discrimination, and it is simply not in the best interest of the nation or the College. It is absurd, intellectually shallow, injurious to campus debate, and damaging lo one's own stated gods of vigoriously opposing racial discrimination - to assert that one who opposes affirmative action is automatically a racist. This, in my view, is counterproductive to the cause of racial justice in America. Mr. Mondschein asks: \What should be done with these people (those who oppose Mr. Mondschein) to stop the bigotry before it spreads into the next generation? The first solution is to kill them. No, that is too good: they should suffer.\ I refuse to accept the notion that the author is tossing out an outrageous idea to stir debate; indeed, what kind of intelligible discussion could result from such a preposterous statement? He makes the case, in public and in print with his name signed to it, for violence against individuals who do not share his views on the treatment of minorities in America- generically lumped together as \bigots.\ Mr. Mondschein does not stop at violence. For this could include breaking shop windows or forcibly relocating those whom he believes to be bigots. He goes further and states that they do not deserve to live. One wonders what method will be used to exterminate these perceived \bigots.\ A bigot is one who clings blindly and intolerantly to a single view, usually contrary to facts that stand against that view. This may or may not apply to racism. Bigotry is more commonly demonstrated by an individual who adheres to a single opinion and asserts there is no other course - or, in the extreme case, that dissenters do not have a right to live. Mr. Mondschein presents no evidence of bigotry surrounding opponents of affirmative action at Union to justify his claim of a \wave of . :~ ,__, -~· ... ~- .. bigotry\ on this campus. Finally, Mr. Mondschein gives up on the cause of education. \The second solution is to educate them (the bigots). No, they are uneducable (sic) by this point.\ Most agree that the solution to racial discrimination, 'along with firm legal penalties and enforcement of legislation, is education. This was the whole point of the de-segregation movement; exposure to people ofdifferent races would el\iminate prejudice. Again, perhaps Mr. Mondscbein was pl!esenting some sort of comedy by these points. I refuse to tolerate writers who think cute sarcasm is a meaningful vehicle for ideas. Public discourse should not exist to satisfy Mr. Mondschein's desire for amusement. What really frightens me is the present level of campus debate, and this is just one example. For those of us who participate regularly, let us pledge to keep our work intellectual and academic at all times. and create a moral force that will ostracize those idealogues who seek to utter simple profanities at one another in print. Of course one has the right to call another a racist, a communist, a homophobe, or another churlish label. No one disputes this. But who cares? Is it too much to ask that we lise above personal animosities and emotions to debate issues based upon their merits and facts? Cordially, Daniel J.

Page '14 LETTERS Has Beta Been Treated Unfairly? S,tudent Forum Lends an Ear To the Editor: -\ftcr conducting interviews this past week with Beta Theta Pi, Dean Alford, Dean Wood, Paul Mantica \the head of ;.;ecunty), and Tom SIJlythc i the head of the physical plant), it has become apparent that the school administration is just as rcsponsibl~ for the condition of Maxcy House as the brothers of Beta Theta Pi. The brothers of Beta have blatantly neglected Maxcy House. 11hey have admittedly caused thousands of dollars of damage to the cosmetic appearance of the house. However, the underlying reasons for boarding up Maxcy House are not cosmetic ones. According to the school administration, Maxcy House is now \structurally unsound\ to house students. The major problems being a corroding fire escape, rotting wood, cracking concrete, and roof problems. These are all problems which have arisen from failure of the school to properly repair surfacing structural problems over the past several years. According to Dean Alford, since he has been Dean of Students (three years) there has been an on-going debate as to \whether or not it was worth investing the money to Maxcy House.\ The brothers at Beta feel tbat the school has unjustly let the house deteriorate, possibly in an effort to abolish the fraternity from the Union Campus. Dean Alford contends that the closing. of Maxcy House is \not a circuitous effort on behalf of the administration to rid the DID YOU KNOW: school of another fraternity.\ However. he does admit that the school \did not invest the money\ over the past few years w repair the house. Granted, it is the school's prerogative to allocate funds as they sec fiL But the fact that they let Maxcy House deteriorate wllilc procrastinating over the investment decision arguably appears to be a shady policy. Take the fire escape issue, for instance. According to Dean Alford, \the straw that broke the camel's back\ was the routine fire inspection in August, \which determined it was time for the school to make a decision.\ Under normal procedure, after the· initial inspection of the house, the list of hazards is prioritized in order of importance by the security officer. It is then passed to the Deans' and Physical Plant offices for action. The greatest structural danger on the report is the \severely corroded fire escape\ which was \not attached to the building in a secure manner.\ As hazardous as this sounds, it was not repaired until over spring break. Over twenty- seven weeks later. When asked for reasons justifying the oolay' Tom Smythe (Head of the Physical Plant) replied, \Things are prioritized in order of importance.\ Undoubtedly a lame excuse for a potentially tragic situation. The Betas are quick to back this up with the fact that the porches and concrete walkways have barely been touched in years. The Brothers of Beta Theta Pi have a valid argument that should be heard. They feel that they are being pushed aside after many years of residence in Maxcy House. They are also frustrated by the fact that there ls no evidence that a structural analysis by a professional group has even been conducted on the building. Also, the Betas have not been given a professional written estimate on costs for repairs, simply \ball park figures\ from the school administration. The eviction of Beta as a group(according to the Dean of Residence Life) for the Union Campus has topped the list of grievances with the administration, which was re- cent:ly discussed at the last Inter- Fratemity Council meeting. It seems that the administration's failure to respectfully communicate with the .student body on a number of issues is sparking hints of possibly conducting an organized protest. Another issue which has surfaced in next year's s-chedule change. A recent student-conducted survey resulted in over ninety-five percent of those responding not in favor of the schedule change. The Inter-Fraternity Council realizes that fraternities \dig their own graves,\ but it also hopes that the Union administration is not playing follow-the-leader by adhering to the national anti-fraternity trend. It appears this may be true. A campus once proud of its fraternities now has even erased them from its alumni news listing. Sincerely, Andrew J.

Dean Alford contends that the closing of Maxcy House is \not a circuitous effort on behalf of the administration to rid the DID YOU KNOW: ... --------------·----··---·------- l -----------------·-------- . . !:. ·.\ ._~'. ~.'r. l11.., dt ·l .. \ cldlll P I iL.d \1;.··,,·: itfl\h,· ,h'll'!'idUll' .\hli_· :'r'''-Ta~llllJllll~ •l\ ,·r :11,, :n\c\inlcnt dc.:r-;ron an;uahiy ;,ippcars to he J shady policy. \'akc the fire escape tssuc, for instance. According to Dean Alford. \the straw that broke the camel's back\ was the routine fire inspection in August, \which determined it was time for the school to make a decision.\ Under normal procedure, after the initial inspection of the house, the list of hazards is prioritized in order of importance by the security officer. It is then passed to the Deans' and Physical Plant offices for action. The greatest structural danger on the report is the \severely corroded fire escape\ which was \not attached to the building in a secure manner.\ As hazardous as this sounds, it was not repaired until over spring break. Over twenty- seven weeks later. When asked for reasons justifying the delay, Tom Smythe (Head of the Physical Plant) replied, \Things are prioritized in order of importance.\ Undoubtedly a lame excuse for a potentially tragic situation. The Betas are quick to back this up with the fact that the porches and concrete walkways have barely been touched in years. The Brothers of Beta Theta Pi llave a valid argument that should be heard. They feel that . ,, ''· \. ' t ' ) i!

It seems that the administration's failure to respectfully communicate with the student body on a number of issues is sparking hints of possibly conducting an organized protest. Another issue which has surfaced in next year's schedule change. A recent student-conducted survey resulted in over ninety-five percent of those responding not in favor of the schedule change. The Inter-Fraternity Council realizes tllat fraternities \dig their own graves,\ but it also hopes that the Union administration is not playing follow-the-leader by adhering to tbe national anti-fraternity trend. It appears this may be true. A campus once proud of its fraternities now has even erased them from its alumni news listing. Sincerely, Andrew J.

This is a question which Nati()nal Hockey League President John Zeigler and the League's Board of Governors must answer beforethey lose total control of their game. It is obvious that they have already lost control of their playets. 'They are also on the brink of losing control of their dedic2ted (and in some cases fanatic) fans. Changes have to · be made before the bea11tiful game of hockey is scarred irrepl.Uably. Last Thursday's divisional playoff game between the New York Rangers and their bitter rivals, the New York Islanders, is a prime example of the anarcb.y which reigns on and off of the ice. It is also an example of how the memory of a well...:played, tough, and truly exciting game can quickly be swept aside and replaced with that of a violent and ugly · example of a sport with no integrity. Before the Rangers' James Patrick checked the Islanders' Pat LaFontaine with under two minutes to play in the tb.ird period in the first game of the best of seven series with the Rangers clinging to a 2·1 lead, the league would have lleen thrilled t.0 offer this game as an example of how the sport ·of hockey can be exciting, · physical, and non-viole!IL. But all of that changed when the head of the smaller LaFolltaine collided with the shoulder of the bigger Patrick. LaFo11taine fell hard to the ice, his head bouncing twice off of the unforgiving surface. While Lhe Island.ers and their coacb, AI Arbour, watched their best player lay motionless on the ice, they knew two tltings. First, their chances of winning the series without the man who accounred for about one...:tllird of their offense were slim. Second, the hit which forced LaFontaine to be carried from the ice on a stretcher wearing a neck restraint was a legal one, and there was reall'~ no question about it The Islanders still had a game to finish. one whicb, they would not concede--,.until only tw<> seconds remained. Arbour pulled his skilled players <>ff of the ice and replaced thern with his big skaters, who have reputations of being physical players, or more specifically, good fighters. Rangers coach Roger Neilson did t11e same. He could not afford to take the chance of having .one of the Islanders' physical p·layers \:being physkal\ with one of his skilled playeFs. But Neilson wanted his team to have no part in a brawl, so he had his }Jlayers line up as far fr:om the face off as they were allowed. However, it didntt matter to Ken Baumgartaer and Mick Vukota where the Rangers lined up. When the puck was dropped, the Islander goons (what other word~ can be used to describe players who have no need for a stick while on the ice, unless they are hitting other players with them?) skated right at the Rangers players and started to punch. The ensuing brawl lasted over five minutes. These Islander ;players got what they deserved-Vukota received a ten game suspension without pay, while Baumgartner received a one game suspension. Arbour was fined $5,000 out of his own pocket, and the organization was fined an additional $25,000. But all concerned parties knew what the consequences were going to be before Lhey took their actions. Obviously the fines and suspensions were not enough C>f a deterrent to keep this ugly incident from occllJTing. An incident just as ugly occurred in the disgusf,cd and Islander (fan, player, relative, broadcaster, whatever) hating crowd of Madison Square Garden. As the game ended and the television broadcasting crews were attempting to leave the Garden, an angry mob of Ranger fans threatened Islander broadcasters Jlggs McDonald and Ed WestphaL If not for the quick arrival of Ranger color commentator John Davidson, who escorted the two frightened 'Islander lovers' away from the mob, the scene could have been as bad as that on the ice just a few minutes befo-re. The final blow, however, was another dealt to LaFontaine. As his ambulance was leaving The Garden, a swarm of Ranger fans surrounded the vehicle. They began to bang on the doors and shake it, and wouid not let it :{lass. It took a group of police officers to break up the 'gathering' and allow the ambulance to ta:ke LaFontaine to the hospital. These terrible incidents occurred beca11se of a legal body check near the end of a close game. 1'he Islanders lost their best player and felt they should retaliate. They did. Now it is time for Zeigler and the NHL's Board <if Governors to do some retaliating of their own. Do something, anything, to end this mad11ess and restore order to the game of hockey and its fans.

Results ll:Y ANDREW SEEWALD Editor .. in· Chief and MICHAEL SILBERTSTEIN Even at one of the most highly competitive colleges in the United States, students are paying little attention to the world around them. This was the findin.g of a Ccmcordiensis telephone Sl.Uvey conducted this week. So, at a time when the rest of the world is reaching new heights in political awareness and activism, the students of Union College appear to be regressing. For most of its history, the United States could thrive even while in isolation from the rest. of the world, but the growing IJerce.ption now is that success without world integration is impossible. For almost aH of . the .survey questions. most of tile respondents could not name · prominent leaders of either the United States or foreign countries. For example, only 29% could name James Baker as the Secretary of State. This is especially disturbing because . not only was Baker part of the . Reagan administration, but he also managed President Bush's election campaign. Addition- aJly, Baker has remained in the news while visiting nations that have undergone great changes in recent times. Ninety-three percent named Margaret Thatcher as the Prime Minister of England but, closer to home. only 12% could · identify Brian Mulroney as the Prime Minsiter of Canada. This, despite Mr. Bush's recent meetings with Mr. Mulroney. Perhaps even more disappointing is that 41% could not name Fidel Castro. who has been in his position for three decades as the dictator of Cuba.

In reaction to the survey, one professor in tbe ·political science department at Union said that the lack of awareness in the United States was dangerous and would ultimately prove costly. He did not express swprise at Lhe results, and said that if most Americans were given blank maps of the world, they would not be able to fill in the names of 20 countries. The professor also said that in a. country like Lhe Soviet Union. where there is a great thirst for political freedom and information, most students probably have greater know- ledge of world politics than their American counterparts, this despite being deprived of such information for a long time. More detailed results of the survey will be reported in ne1{.t week's edition of Concordiensis. ·· · ·· .'-RAYI*ISK.ELLARwill be opea1 on·a··SASH·ONIN BASIS . ...••..• ·\o··- - .. •·•·. ~A'ItliDA::G.t~AY~lt:m,~~ ... ~~~,ll~JJ.Al;t.,. -.:.- -11IANX YOU . •, .• ., ,:-,
