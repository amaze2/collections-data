He also accepted the position of Commissioner for the erection of a new city hall for Newark, and :Cotnrnis- sioner· of the sinking fund of that city. The Ship building Company's muddle was adj.udicated by him, and it was he who ap- pointed his friend, former U. S. Senator .Jatnes Smith, receiver. He had more recently handled the Northern Securities case in vari· ous form$, and on May 9, was to have heard the case of Harriman and the Equitable Se- curities a.gainst the distributing scheme .of the Northern Securities. l'he sugar combination and the so-called whiskey trust and most other big combinations came before him at one .time or another relative to various questions. . ' Judge Kirkpatrick owned large amounts of real estate in Newark and in various places. His fortune was rated at several millions. He was twice married. His first wife was Alice C. Condit, and his second wife Louisa Howell who survives him. He also leaves ' six children. He was a charter member of the Essex Club, of Newark, a tnember of the Essex County Country club and the Reform club of New York city. '63-- The library recently received a copy of '' Early Bibles in America,'' Ed. 3., by Rev. John Wright, D. D., Rector of St. Paul's church, St. Paul, Minn. The Library also has a copy of the third edition of the Saur Bible published at Germantown, '76, which was presented by Dr. Wdght. It is of interest a.s being the first Bible printed in America in, a European language. Nearly all the copies of this edition were destroyed by the British troops when they occupied Germantown in 1776, as they used the paper for cartridges for their.fire arms, and also converted it into litter for their horses.

GLOBE HOTEL, ALBANY.-Actv. Some of the delegadons are very large. Yale, for instance, including her sub-freshtnen, had over roo rnen at Northfield lastyear. Harvard, Princeton, Columbia Cornell, etc., not quite so many, while Brown, \Vesleyan and vVi:lliams had even more in proportion to their nutnbers. The outline of the Conference consists in P1atforrn 1\1eetings by l\Ir. Robert E. Speer, New York City; Rev. Anson Phelps Stokes, jr., Yale; Rev. Chas. Cuthbert Hall, D. D. New York; Rev. G. J\.. Johnston H.oss, Cambridge, England; Prof. R. A. Falconer, Halifax, N. S.; lVIr. John R. lVIott and others.; in Bibl~e Study Courses u.nder 11r. W. D. Murray, New York City; Mr. L. H. lVIiller, Princeton University; , Prof. H. M. 1\'ory McGill University; Mr. Thornton B. Penfield, New York City; Prof. R. A. Falconer and Mr. C. C. lVlichener ; in ,, :rv1ission Studies under J. L. Barton, D. D·, ' Boston, and John Willis Baer of New York ; and Life Work n1eetings held at sunset on Round Top hill. The expenses during the period are not heavy. Accornmodati:>ns may be secured at the North- field Seminary buildings for $r 2 for the entire stay : at Camp Northfield, which is open all summer, for $4.oo to $s.oo per week; and at ''The Northfield,'' a first class mountain hotel where n1any of the students entertain their rel- atives and friends. Reduced railway rates and limited opportunities for work further lesson the cost of attending the Conference. The gathering is strictly a student movernent, orig- inated by then1, and managed by the1n, and it is the earnest ·wish that every college and pre- paratory school in the East will be represent- e.d there this summer.

Moving day was :eelebrated on May 2nd with the usual pomp. After chapel services, ., when the faculty had withdrawn, the seniors took charg-e. After giving the class yell the members tnarched around the chapel and, singing tl1e 1904 song, escorted first the junior then in succession the sophotnores and the freshmen to the seats .Jeft vacant for them re- spectively by their up -moving predecessors. 'The students then fonned in line, and, headed by the seniors, who appeared for the first time in cap and govvn, v-isited the various class rootns, honoring eacl,l waiting professot· with a song appropriate to the occasion. All un- wary professors found out of doors \Vere promptly surrounded and held prisoners until a speech had been obtained. The ceren1onies were concluded by a visit to the idol in the rear of vVashburne Hall, where, to the accom- paniment of doss yells and college songs, freshmen and sopho:rnores united in painting the idol white in token that their feuds were past.

The 1905 Garnet, after the sundry yet nor- mal tribulations, which every annual must pass through before being published, appeared on Saturday last. It may be said to begin with that it gives no evidence of having gone through any hardships either tnaterial or men- tal. • The volume is very appropriately dedicated to Dean Fiero of the Albany Law Department of the University. The most striking feature of the annual is probably the lTniversity character. The Junior '' Medics \ have individual picture in- serts. The space given to the different de- partments in Albany and the quality of the material is especially to be con1mended. From an artistic point of view the Garnet is a n1arked success. rfhe Art Editor certainly did himself credit and th.e other drawings are well executed and engraved. The Literary Editor is to be congratulated on the amount and quality of the material he secured and the aptness of the ''grinds.\ For the Bnsiness l\1anager one silent prayer is uttered. '93-Henry A. VanAlstyne ts to be ap- pointed State Engineer. I \ /'03---Samuel B. Howe, jr., expects to he s1tuated in Plainfield, N.

INTERCLASS TRACK MEET. 1,he interclass track n1eet for se:lectin tr a \,:) tean1 to cornpete in the Trinity n1eet this Sat- urday was held on the College Oval last Fri- day afternoon. The absence of Captain Ray- tnond, 'os and \Valdron, 'o6, was felt and had they been present the class scores would un- ! doubtedly stand differently. The Sopho1nor·es won the n1eet, the Seniors and :Fresh 1nen tied fur second piace, and the Juniors came in last. Closson, 'o6, threw the hamn1er 1. o ft. over the college record. rrhe events were as follows: 100 yard dash--\Von by Paln1.er, 'o4; Von- Danneaburg, 'o6, second; Patton, 'os, third. rfime, I I seconds.

Union's nine defeated the Hatnilton teatn last Saturday afternoon on the campus by a decisive gan1e of 10-4. The game was a pretty one to watch tho' the Garnet's big lead in the first few innings left tittle doubt as to the out- cotne. I-Iagar's ho1ne run in the first inning rat:her disconcerted the players fron1 Clinton and thev never whollv recovered until the sev- ~ ~ e11 th, when, by a series of well placed hits, they brought in three runs. One of the n1ost sensa- tional plays seen on the cam pus in a long \V bile was 0' Brien's double play to Bradley. Fie caught a white hot liner vvith cowboy w·hiskers 011 it and played it to second in a twinkling. I-le pitched a pretty gatne and earned all the support he got. R.obinson covered right field well and bc-1.tted in good fonn, making two base hits out of three chances. \Jack\ l\lahar muffed a high fly which got zig-zagging in the wind but otherwise played a steady gan1e. For Harnilton, Bramley played a good hard game and Judd on first base was '' steady as a stone wall in Georgia.'' 1-Iavens, who began the twn·ling, was substituted by Soper in the si:xth inning.
