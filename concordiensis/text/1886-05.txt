W ILL sotne one explain to us why the stu- dents cling to the custo1n of -vvearing dress suits at Con1mencen1ent? For our part we can see no reason for doing so except that it is cus- tolnary. They are by no n1eans suited to lend con~posure to a speaker, and, as for looks, we think that for entertaintnents of such. charaCter :as Cotn,tnencetn~nt exercises, which are entirely literary, an~ not so~ial< they are entirely out of place. The Senior class would do a good deed ifthey rejected this absurd custom. We have no personal interest in the n1atter, nor do we wish to deprive any one of the oppor- tunity of letting twenty dress suits to t-vventy Sepiors, but this matter has appeared to us as a splendid opportunity for reforni. . f70NSIDERABLE refleCtion over the result \9 of this tenn's study .of \ Christian Eviden~ ces\ has given rise to son1e doubt concerning the advantages of the study as a required subject in the course. We fully understand Hickok's argutnent for co1npulsory religious education, and willingly acknowledge the benefit of a careful study of the subjett, yet we cannot help thinking that it has , been of little value to the class this vear. It . ~ is a study, in our opinion, which is cornplete in itself, and has no further influence like the other philosophical subjeCts of the course. More than ~ that, if the debasing of the religious notions of : the class is an injury we think the subjeCt has · been quite injurious. It is our opinion that this subjeCt could be better reserved for the Theological school and sotne other substituted. I T seerns ahnost a waste of titne to call attention to sotne needed ilnprovetnents. They are so self evident that any atnount of discussion would not 1nake their necessity rnore apparent. Yet knowing this, we cannot, help speaking, about · our need of a Professor in Political Science and History. Hitherto the work in political subjects has been thrown upon professors already crowded with work, 1nuch to their inconvenience, and

THE CONCORDIENSIS. certainly to their disadvantage of an extensive and thorough study of any subjeB:. . In regat~d to history, as the students of late years well know, we have had no regular in- struCtion in history for tnany years, and what little we have had, being thrown in for the sole purpose, evidently, of tnaking up the fifteen hours, has been very carelessly taught. There are no subjects 1nore interesting or of rnore universal application in after iife, and it is a great n1isfortune that we have no regular pro- fessor. We think we voice the sentiments of the stu- dent when we say that no action. of the trustees would be rnore acceptable than the filling of the chair of history with an able 1nan. A S an~ther Cotntnencetne~t is just at hand, we desue to call the attention of students to an i1nportai1t tnatter-that of staying- in town during Cotntnencement week. Son1e of us think that we have fully discharged our duty as soon as we have finished our last exatnination paper ; V{e eat a hasty dinner and run to catch the first train that goes toward hotne. A few of us tna y have such arrangetnents for the sun11ner as will not perrnit us to retnain here, but rnany of those who leave early could stay if they wished. After you have been absent fron1 horne a whole tenn, surely your friends, even if there be a sweetheart an1ong thern, can wait a few days longer; the meeting will be all the svveeter, and you will have had the pleasure and satisfaction of seeing Cotntnencernent. We do not have a large nutn- ber of students, and if our ranks are thinned out by the loss of one here and there, our appearance will not be very itnposing at the very tilne when the College ought to appear at its best. The graduating class this year is not nurnerically large, and it is itnportant that son1e of the want of array on the stage be balanced by an increased ntunber of students in the audience. By show- ing our own intetest in the exercises of the week we can tnake the last college days of eighty-six more mernorable and also inspire in the people down town a greater interest in Con11nencement week and in the college itself. I T is always pleasant to bring up piCtures of the past, and especially when they show how fully our hopes have been realized. Although at the beginning of the year a stnaH class entered UNION, yet instead of her p1~ospecrs being clouded the brightest anticipation~ h;:1ve been realized. .. l\Jl students have been the n1ore earnest in itn- proving then1selves in all departtnents. Never before has such interest been. felt bv .I young tnen of our country in the study of their own language. The advance of Atnerican vvorks, the annihilation of that conternptuous question : \ Who ever reads A1nerican books,\ all these tend to encourage young 111en to seek influence as writers. But a greater incen- tive is seen in the desire to wield effectually that mighty weapon, the pen. In a country like our own, where the hun1.ble lad· of to-day rnay be- corne the dignified President of to-tnorrow, and the tattered frock of the fanner's boy gives place to the graceful toga of the Statestnan, what as- piring youth would despise the aid of that ever burning torch, which tnay gild by its light the bright and golden future. '' Of all the arts in which the wise excel, Natures chief masterpiece is writing welL\ To the student of the present age, to hin1 ready and willing to battle in the cause of truth, a broad field of usefulness lies open, where he n1ay win laurels which crown only the truly great. 1'he world regards to-day with greater venera- tion the spirit exetnplified in a Wilberforce, than the atnbitious and insatiable desire of a Napoleon. We are assetnbled fron1 different portions of- our country to lay the groundwork of an educa- tion-to n1ould the character-to strengthen our n1ental faculties. A few years only and we sepa- rate, each to carry to higher seats of learning the principles already acquired, and fro1n thence still higher, till we con1e forth fully anned and prepared to fill the vacancies caused by the loss of those etninent persons who are through con- tending in the broad arena of life ; and using aright the talent we there possess, standing up boldly in the defense of truth, we will cause every word and aCtion to be a true index to our charaCter. * l ' ...

An Age of Monuments.· The hero dies ; but the tones of the bell have scarcely relapsed into silence, the long tnoutnful procession has scarcely been disbanded, when the sculptor's chisel is heard ringing on the tnarble. .l\. n1onu1nent of colossal proportions rises to the dead, to which throughout future ages will flock thousands of curious adtnirers. In this respeCt, then, the hero of this age of sculptured brass and chiseled· tnarble is tnore blessed than the hero of early history. It has always, it is true, been the custo1n of tnen to de- vise son~e visible, tangible etnbletn of the invisi- ble, spit·it-like glory that crowned the tnan of genius when alive; but in the fonnative periods of each nation's history, in the ages that prece- ded the Pyratnids, the Parthenon, ParliatDent Building and the Capitol at Albany, when life was a struggle rather than a pleasure, sublin1e rather than beautiful, when there were giants -------------·-~--·------- and demi-gods to contend with and not lnnnan flesh only, 1nen lived in deeds rather than in tnarble. Hotner filled all Greece with tnusic, and his songs have echoed down all ages, but his tnontunent is still virgin 1narble covered by the earth. We have nothing, however, to say against our custotn of erecring 1nassive n1onu1nents. Who will say that our nation should not thus give evi- dence of its gratitude to its heroes and scholars, or even that any tnan, if he pleases should not raise a tnost splendid tnetnorial to a n1ost hun1- ble friend, even if future generations adn1i re the tnarble but can find no other record of hin~ whose natne is inscribed thereon ? But such tributes • are beautiful, nothing rnore. They show the glory of the sculptor, not the glory of the Master Artist who created the hero or the friend. Neither is their effect on the tninds of observers so 1nuch to tnake heroes or friends as to 1nake sculptors. The youth who gazes upon a statue of Washington will probably be inspired not so 1nuch to in1itate the life of Washington as to chisel out a sin1ilar statue ; or, if his ardor kin- dles a little brighter, he will desire to be a Wash- ington in order that he also rnay have a statue ereCted to his tnetnory rather than that he tnay earn the title of ''Father of his Country.\ The fact is that no one who did not raise to hin1self an itntnaterial tnonutnent in the hearts of his countrytnen before he died was ever honored with a tnaterial one after death, and that no one who had no higher tnotive for aCtion than the attainrnent of the tnaterial1no.nu1nent ever won it. Across the gateway to every such life you can see written, \Vanity Oblivion.\ Monutnents do not, therefore, reproduce glory. There does not live a sculptor who can fashion a Detnosthenes with such divine attributes that the observer n1oved by the eloquence of the 1narble tongue or by the fire of the tnarble eye, will exclaitn, \Let us fight King Philip.\ He can fashion no bust of Cicero that will expel a Cataline from the city of Washington, no bust of Cresar that will send to our Congress the tnessage, ''I catne, I saw, I conquered.\ These heroes do,

So THE :coNCORDIENSIS. -- ----~---~ indeed, exert even to day a 1nighty influence, but it is· altogether in other tnonutnents than those of rnarble and brass. In conclusion, therefore, I would say, 1et us erect to our tnighty dead as many and as costly monutnents as we please ; let us place thetn where the thousands will see and adtnire thetn ;· but do not let us trust to such influences for ·our future he1~oes. For if w-e do, the con'ling gene- rations wHl not be heroes but hero-worshipers. P. H. C. ---------------~-~----~~--~==~~========== Civil Service Reform vs. the Spoil System. The subject upon which we purpose to write is one that has. long beet; held up to the eyes of the Atnerican people. Perhaps as tnuch prin- ter's ink and paper have lately been -consumed in the discussion of this as of any other probletn in Atnerican politics, and in such a tnanner that when we exatnine this stack of printed 1natter which has grown in geotnetrical ratio as the years have passed by, we can find neither head nor tail to it, so various the standpoints from which writers have looked at the question, and so diverse the opinions advanced, warped by personal interest and party bias. It is not our purpose. however, to bring order out of chaos, to reconcile confliCting statetnents, or to say which opinion is correct:, which incorreCt. That is a task left for heads tnore thoroughly skilled. in the science of government. As the tenn civil service is capable of variot_ls applications, it tnay not be superfluous to define it. In a broad sense, it includes all the offices in the gift of the people frotn the presidency to the coroner. In its tnore litnited signification, in the signification in which I believe it is\' ~~?W generally used in political circles and the one in which we use it in this paper, it applies only to certain appointive offices, as custo1n-house offices and post-offices. We have reached a day in the political his- tory of our nation when the great question which detennines a tnan's course· of action in a particu- iar instance is not. Is it right? Is it for the bene- fit of the whole country? but, is it expedient? Will tny personal ain1s be thereby protnoted ? It · . is a fact:, not universally, I atn happy to say,. but a-las, too generaliy true, that unalloyed selfishness is the n1ains,pring of aCtion in our public Inen. 'Conscious that in a republican fonn of govern- ,m.ent their success is detern1ined by the nut-nber of votes they can cotntnand, they do not hesitate to 1n inister to that satne passion in others which · rules thetn, na1nely, selfi-shness. If you will do anything to advance my interests, I \Vill not for- g~t yours ; when I attain to ·power, you shall have a share in the gifts at tny disposal. Hence there is often a silent understanding, not to say a verbal or written agreetnent, between a politi- cal tnagnate and his zealous supporters that when the prize is gained there shall be a division of the ''spoils.'' It is this ''gratitude\ on the part of a leader for services rendered, and not, I firmly believe, a burning love for party or a conscien- tious adherence to its princi pies that has led to this extraordinary and sotnewhat alanning tnethod of besto·wing civil service offices. It is this that has rendered refonn necessary, and it is this that is to-day the tnost powerful enetny of refonn. Now civil service refonn and ''spoil system\ are thus diametrically opposed. The one seeks to fill the appointive offices by tnen who have given untnistakable evidence of their ability and honesty in such reasonable tests as tnay be ap- plied to thetn; the other places the keys of po- sitions of honor and influence into the hands of favorites, regardless of either ability or honesty; the one would recognize tnerjt and encourage honest and honorable efforts to attain distinCtion and power, the other would not only give un-- bridled license to avarice and atnbition but also hold out a golden prize for cunning and intrigue. So patent has this. fact beco1ne that patriotic citi- zens have seen the necessity of preventing n1en in chief places frotn using certain offices for per- sonal ends; they believe that all offices are pub- lic trusts, and that therefore the people may de- tnand that they tnay be filled by the best n1en ; they have detennined that a candidate shall not buy support, and that those who espouse a cause shall do so fro1n principle and not because they expect the \spoils.\ The laws of civil service refonn not only inscribed on the statute-books, ....

The 220 yard dash was handsotnel y won by Culver in 27 seconds, a good distance before Ashton, '87. Hawkes, '87, Voorhees and Whalen, '89, ap- peared in the half-rnile run. Whalen set the pace and kept the lead until two-thirds of the distance was accon1plished, when Ashton took a long lead, only to relinquish it in turn to Voor- hees, who by a n1agnificent spurt closed the long gap between himself and Hawkes, and proved an easy winner in 2 tninutes and 27Yz seconds.

The interest of the day was centered upon the final heat of the roo yard dash. Ashton and Randall were given a handicap of two yards. Culver had several feet the best of the start and held the lead for half the distance when Turn- bull can1e to the front and won in ro% seconds. The result of this race was a surprise to tnany, inasn1uch as Turnbull's speed had never been tested, and he had entered the· race without the least training. The standing broad jtunp was won by Lan- don, '86, with Little, '88, second ; distance: 9 feet 4 inches. I Landon also won the running hop, skip and jtunp ; distance 39 feet and 9 inches. This was the sixth event won by Landon, who is beyond doubt the best all-around athlete in college. The hurdle race brought out three tnen ; it was won by Culver in r 7% seconds, with Dil- linghatn second. Lewis was rnaking a good race but fell. Two pairs entered the three-legged race, which was won by Hawkes and Ashton, '87, in 7% seconds, beating the Union College record.

At last, ho\vever, the gmne began -with the visitors at the bat-they suc- ceeded in getting one 1nan across the honl.e- plate-and then gave way to the Union nine.

HARVARD.- Twenty-five tnen have signified their intention of trying for the Harvard foot-ball teatn next fall. The temn prom'ises to be unu- sually strong behind the rush line. It is not generally known that the Crz'mson is printed in its own office, and that two coinposi- tors are c1nployed by the paper throughout the college }'ear. 1-Iarvard has applied for re- adn1ission to the Inter-Collegiate Foot-ball League, and has been accepted.

The Seniors of the College of the City of New York are not tnarked this year in their recitations.
