Most of the n1en vvho had positions on the tea tn 1ast year were on hand at the beginning of the season and were very effective in breaking in the new n1en. The 'varsity early n1an.ifested unusual strength on the rush line and the work of the b::tcks \Vas much stronger than last year. Con- siJerable gain has been made over previous ycJ.rs in the interference and it was acknovvl- edged by opposing tea,ms that this interference w:1s the great feature of the team \Vork. The scientific accuracy and perfectness with which this feature of the gan1e was executed has en- abled runs of sixty, seventy and ninety yards to be n1ade by our half backs. The rapid advance of the teatn in strength WJ.s to a large extent due to the opposition furnished thetn by the scrub eleven, which was con1posed of sotne very good players. T'hey carne out day after day, giving the 'varsity excellent practice, anJ \\·ere largely instru- tnental in bringing the pennant to lT nion.

When Gregory entered Union with the class of '94, he had never seen a gan1e of foot ball and knew nothing about its rules. I-f e very soon manifested an interest in the sport and \\'as one of the first rnen in the class to don a suit. l-Ie evinced his enthusidsn1 and love for the ga.n1e by his faithfulness in appearing· on the can1pus day after day for practice. I-I e was, on account of his build and weight looked upon as a de- sirable acquisition anJ in his Freshm3n year --·------- filled the position of right half-back, as sub- stitute, playing the position in several itn- por:tant games. In the Sophomore year he was n1ade a regutar member of the eleven, play,in:g in his old p1lace \vhich he has since held. At the c:lose of the season of '93, Mr. Gregory vvas chosen to captain the teatn this year,,, and the result of the season is indica- tive of the good work done by the captain and the confidence placed in him by the n1e:mbers of the tean1. Captain Gregory had three years of vigorous training before his . election to the ctptaincy, and was fully conl- petent to assun1e the duties of that responsible office. There was an overflow of rna~crial fron~ ~vhich to sc:lect n1en to fill the vacant positions and l\'ir. Gregory displayed good judgnacnt ia filling the vacancies vvith the rigb.t n1en. 11 c has been constantly on the watch for weak p::>,ints in the tean1 and very quick in ren1edying tl~en1. Captain Gregory h:1s, by his presence, i nspircd the n1en and succeeded in brin-yin£! forth the excellent D '-\' teaul which has won pennant nun1bcr three, and has adn1irably upheld the foot ball reputa- tion of 0 ld Union. l\I r.

The morning had uecn dull and gloorny but about noon the sun, breaking through, scattered the c~ouds and n1ade the afternoon an ideal one for playing and \Vit- nessing a game of foot ball. The tean1, ac- cornpanied by the coachers, tnanager, assist- ant manager and a large delegation of stu- dents, \vent over to Albany early in the rnorn- . ing ·where they rnade the Delavan their head- q Marters. All the east-bound tnorning trains carried students and their friends tovvard the scene of the conflict, bu.t a majority of the students and a large number of Schenectady people \Vere conveyed to Albany by the I :33 train, and fron1 Albany they were taken to the ball grounds by a D. & H. special. \Vhen the Union tearn reached the grounds there ·were fully three thousand people present and before the first-half was finished this number \Vas in- creased by rnore than a thousand. The gar- net \Vas abundantly displayed by the crowd and especially by the ladies, ·who in various \Vays manifested their \veakness for the gar- net and its defender.3. As the team ran on the field for a little practice they \vere greeted by the Union '' Hika,\ given again and again by their admirers, inspiring hope and courage in the hearts of the n1en who had recently vvon the intercollegiate champ:onship of N e\v York State. Very soon the Dartmouth tean1 ap- peared on the field and it becan1e painfully evident to the vast throng that the \Vearers of the green were much superior in weight at least and \vould not have much trouble to keep the garnet from scoring. The Union men did not, however, lose courage, and \vent into the gan1e as though they meant business, and at one tin1e in the first half it looked as though they tnight score, but this they \Vere unable to do although they played a very good game. The yell \Vas given on one side of the field and then on the other but the en- couragement afforded did not avail as the men frorn Hanover were heavier and n1ore scien- tific.

What about the pennant ? \tVhy_, the pennant is ours. Well, ·what kind of a pennant is ours ? Why, the pennant of the New York State Intercollegiate Foot Ball League, vvhich car- ries with it the championship of the Nevv York League. We have been asked very num·erously of late, \when is· that 'Concordy' coming out?'' We are not surprised that the students are becmming itnpatient. We are in the same frame of mind. Of course, THE CoKCORDI- ENSIS must keep pace with the college spirit and enthusiasrn n1anifested by the students when the team \Von the championship. To do this v1e decided to issue a foot ball number, containing cuts of the team, manager and Our foot ball team has covered itself with giory and won for Union pennant number three and chan1pionship of the N,ew York State Intercollegiate League. 1'he garnet has triumphed on the foot ball field three con- secutive seasons, and we are proud of our record. Union ran up a score of one hun- dred and thirty-six points while her. oppo- nents were tryin.g to make a tonch-do\vn. 1'he score \vould have been much larger if llarnilton had played foot baU instead of cra\vling off the field in such a disgraceful manner. All honor to our sturdy foot ball men and the n1anager. The game \vith the Rochester team \vas de- void of one feature which has in forn1er years been very prominent and disagreeable. , The Union teatn always dreaded the Rochester game on account of the fistic propensities of the members of the Rochester tearn and their disposition to dispute rulings and raise a row in general if possible. This year the ·men catne back to Union and expressed then1- sel ves as agreeably surprised, and particularly pleased \Vith the way in which the Rochester tnen played the game. A marked difference \vas n1anifest between this and former games and it seerns as though Rochester_ and Hamil- ton had exchanged places. \ One of the boys of '93 \ has sent Prof. Truax a check for $roo to be expended in additions to the library of books required by the English departrnent.

TH-REE PICTURES THAT ARE lURNED TOWt~R D THE WALL. I. Far away beyond the glamor of a city and its strife There's a qaiet little college on the hill. Where a strong foot ball eleven used to play as if tlle lite Of Han1ilton depended on their skill. Not a shadow ever seemed to cloud the brightness of their hope, And they thought defeat couid 11e'er their team ilil~fa:ll; But they left the hill one morning with Old Union's men to cope, And Old Union turned their picture to the walt And they boasted of their prowess which in this case they allowed Half an hour to beat Old Union woof and \varp. But they packed their little knapsacks, silently they stole away; For against Old Union they had failed to score at all ; And the only recollection of the team so blithe and gay, Is their picture vdth its face to\vard the wall. IV. REFRAIN. They have laid away each token of three teams who'll ne'er return, Every color, every en1blern that they wore; And Old Union wonders often if for foot ball they still yearn, If they long to n1ee'.: the garnet on the battlefield once more. But no tidings ever rea:..h us that their life or lot may be, And we sometimes think they're gone beyond recall; Wh1le a tender recollection sometin1es con1es to check our glee Of three pictures with their faces to the wall. LAST REFRAIN. There are three names never spoken ; many college sports are broken ; There are just three teams that're missing from the gridiron, that is all ; Ther~ i~ just· a memory living to alma maters unfor- gtvtng, And three pictures that are turned to\vard the wall.
