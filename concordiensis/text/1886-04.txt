W HA: ~as becotne of the Lawn Tennis As- sociation. vVhere tennis playing is so uni- versal as at Union there ought to be a nurnber of good players. Why could not a series of rnatches be arranged to play for the charnpionship of the College? W E think the literary societies are tnoving in the right direCtion by arranging for the re- rnoval of their libraries to the College ~ibrary. The advantages of such an arrangetnent vvere set forth in this paper several 1nonths ago. We would advise careful consideration, however, be- fore the societies give up the privileges now pos- sessed by the Inetnbers, for undoubtedly the libraries are one of the strongest features of the societies. T HE instructor in \ cat-ology\ seetns to have little regard for public health in leaving the subjects of that delightful study around the col- lege buildings to decotnpose as they 1nay. It seems that cotntnon decency would detnand that these retnains be re1novecl, and con1n1on sense would tell anyone that these san1e retnains rnight be a fertile source of disease. 'THE stand taken by Rochester University, on being expelled frotn the State Inter-colle- giate Base Ball League, is honorable and worthy of the highest con11nendation. The Rochester boys were indignant on being expelled, but in- stead of getting their backs up and retnaining ITIUtn they have paid up their debts, and now propose to show the collegiate world that Roch- ester has not lett the diatnond by any tneans. There seen1s now no reason why Rochester should not be re-instated at once. A FTER two years trial of the plan of closing college work at one o'clock in the afternoon, we think it is still a debatable question whether it is for the best interests of the students to con- tinue it. To be sure there is tnore titne for the student, but it is a question whether it is used profitably or not. Especially in wann weather there is little studying done in the afternoon. Under the old plan the hours intervening be- tween recitations were hours of solid work, but there was another advantage in that the students had an opportunity to digest their work so to speak. As it is now a Senior going into Chris- tian Evidences, Hist. of Civilization, Hist. of Phil. and Law LeB:ures, .with only one interven- ing hour, is liable to have a very poor notion of the work in all of thetn. If a larger nutnber of eleCtives are allowed another year we shall have to resun1e the old plan any way.

66 THE CONCORDIENSIS: O UR attention has been drawn during the past week to the evident confliction a n1ong the various college organizations. So1ne arrange- n1ent should be n1ade itnn1ediate:l_y to avoid this. Sotne of the students are n1en1 hers of tb.e Base Ball teatn, Glee Club and Athletic Association. All of then1 deserve their attention and support, but no one of then1 should denJ.and their whole titne. For exan1ple,. one week there was clash- ing between the Glee Club and Base Ball which 1night have been avoided if those in control of the ''nine\ and the Glee Club had endeavored to n1ake son1e arrange1nents for it. Another thing -vve would call attention to is, that the '• nine\ ought not to entirely tnonopo- lize the catnpus. T-vvo hours ought to be enough for praCtice. The \ nine\ is for the college as well as by the college, and if the students in gene- ral wish to play they should have an oppor- tunity. We are not blatning or criticising anybody, but these things ought to l1e a1nicably and satis- faCtorily arranged. I T is with regret that we announce the resigna- tion of Mr. I. P. Johnson fro111 the editorial board. Mr. Johnson has filled the position of business editor in a tnost creditable 111anner. Mr. f-I. W. Mc1VIillen has been elected to fill the vacancy. COMMUNICATIONS. MR. EDITOR- In an editorial in the March nutnher of your paper, after justly con1111ending the activity of the College authorities, the state- Inent is tnade, '' now, if the trustees -vvoulcl hurry up and elect a President, vve 'd sing,\ etc. This seen1s to irnply one of two assertions: First, that we have not a President at present, or, second, that it ·would be for the best interests of the Colleg-e to have another one. vVe desire to take exceptions to both of then1. Like state- lnents have been recklessly ancl frequently 1nade by the Alb,~ny Argus, Saratogian, the [Jnion and Star of this city, and other papers in this vicinity. Let us see vvhat the faCts will show. In your editorial you call attention to the nutner- ous i1nprovetnents, all of which is true, but -as we understand it the in1provetn;ents, particuhirly in regard to the library and repairs to the build- ings and grounds are due tnainly to our Presi- dent. In the rnanagernent of College affairs the President has shown hitnself very efficient, nor has he negleCted the College work, his leCtures to Seniors this tenn on U. S. Constitution have been pronounced by capable critics who have visited then1, very able. As every one who is acquainted with the true state of a:Aiirs here, vvill adn1it what is n1ost necessary for Union at present is a capable and thorough business tnan as President., and we have yet to hear a denial of the present incutn- bent's ability in this direCtion. More than that vVe VP,nture to assert that it vvould be very diffi- cult to obtain a bettei· one. The President is always alert to the internal as vvell as the external manageJnent of the Col- lege ii1terests, and yet with rare good sense is satisfied to leave the lesser n1atters to the faculty. Frotn this taCt, possibly, tnay arise the cotntnon cry of'' Faculty rule and no President,\ and con- sequently the tnistake of the nevvspapers and the public. With these faCts in 1nind it seerns evident that a change at present is undesirable for two rea~ sons. First, It would be very difficult, indeed, to do better; and, second, in the present inlpor- tant stage in the progress of the College a tnis- take in the seleCtion of a President would be talatnitous in its consequences. When the College is firn1ly placed financially it will be titne enough to eleCt a new President, and any error then would not be so injurious. We trust that the trustees are of th1s opinion, and if not, we cannot see ho\\r they can think otherwise when fully infonned of the true state of affilirs. To return to our original statetnent, the as- sertion that we haven't a President is certainly \vrong, and the assertion that vve need a change can only be true on the hypothesis that Union is soun<l financially, and then it is only doubt- ful.

It has long been n1y atnbition to witness a shipwreck. Frotn bei11g at first a 1nere whitn, this desire grew finally to be the controlling in- fluence of tny life. Titne and titue again have I crossed the ocean l in the tnost unsea. worthy vessel I could find. I-Iow eagerly I watched the barotneter, and with what a thrill of glee I hniled the signs of an ap- proaching stonn ! When the rest of the passengers \Verc hud- dled in frightened grou1~s below, I ren1ained on deck, exulting in the how 1 of the hurricane and the rush of the 1:olling waters. But only disappointrnent attended n1e. Safely, , through vvind and wave, the ship would strug- gle, and finally cast anchor in her intended ha- ven. Defeat, instead of discouraging n1e, n1a~c stronger the desire which had becon1e the pas- sion of 1n y life. Finally a brilliant thought struck n1e-if a vessel vvonld not sink otherwise why could not I sink her? I did not ponder long over this, for fron1 the tnon1ent the idea arose I adopted it. But the details vvere yet to be arranged: and to thetn I devoted all the powers .of a well dis- ciplined 1nind. Finally aU was ready, and on a foggy, Intuky n1orning I joined the throng of passengers upon the deck of the Cunard steatn- ship, Oregon. In n1y hand I carried a carpet-bag. None kne\V the terrible agent it contained. It -vvas dynat1;1ite. I carried th~ carpet-bag carefully clown to n1y state-roorn, stored it safely avvay and returned to the deck. It had been 111 y intention to sink the stean1er in 1nid-ocean, but' I IeaTnecl that, owing to her being constructed in con1part1nents it \vould he irnpossible to do so. }~Ience I detennined to ~nvait until vve neared the .A .. n1erican coast, at which tin1e, I was infonned, the doors connect- ing the con1parttnents vvould be thrown open. I thoroughly enjoyed the voyage, n1y approach- ing triun1ph so cxhilcrateclmy feelings that they bubbled over in all kincls of exuberant conceits, and I vvas unanin1ously voted by all on board to be the life and soul of the party. llovv ditler- ently they would have felt had they known of n1y secret intention. .r\_t last the titne arrived. It was early n1orning. I-Iolding in on~ hand n1y carpet-bag, in the other a brick, I stole up the cabin stairs and looked cautiously out of the door. Thcrt! was a heavy, bluish 1nist resting

68 THE CONCORDIENSIS. upon the water, rnaking a beautiful n1orning for a shipwreck. There was no one near tne. Soft- ly I crept to the vessel's side, a backward glance assured 1ne that I was unwatched. Carefully, \' by tneans of a sn1all rope, I lowered the carpet- bag ahnost to the water's edge. Then firn1ly graspi;ng the brick, I took sure aitn and hurled it downward. The shot was good. The valise was struck. A terrific explosion ensued. The ship tre1nbled frotn the awful shock. She was doo1ned. It is needless to describe the hurried r~sh on deck, the confusion, the rescue by boats and the grand final plunge. The whole scene is vividly hnpressed upon tny n1e1nory, and will never be effaced. It was the atnbition of 1ny ,life-a genuine shipwreck. N. M. R. \Filling.\ Three pages of copy wanted ! Holy sn1oke ! And where was it to con1e fro1n? With a dazed sort of feeling and a very downcast, dis- couraged air the poor, lonely editor wandered towards the hill and tried to colleCt his thoughts. lie found this no easier, however, than collect- ing subscriptions, for the satne old reason was very apparent-there wasn't anything to collect ! Reaching. his rootn he seated hitnself on the coal hod, bowed his hot, flushed face in his hand. 'Twas the first titne that hand had held a flush for 1nany weeks, and yet it availed hitn nothing. With a stuck-in-exatnination feeling in his breast the editor bitterly soliloquized on his unhappy lot. How honorable, pro1nir.ent and lucrative was his position. Nothing to do but to superintend a hard-working, syste1natic board of sub-editors ; to look over and cotntnend their numerous tnanuscripts and to hold thetn in check lest they should write too much. Here were three pages yet to be filled, but he dared not ask for help frotn his colleagues for Jear the strain on their productive powers would be too great. But how was he to fill up that yawning chas1n of three thousand words? Ah! there was the rub. Just then he seetned to hear a voice that can1e from an indescribable so1newhere, a voice soft ------------------------------- and low,. full of comfort and syn1pathy. \B:e not disheartened, 0 thou of little editorial ca- pacity,\ said the voice. \Better days will cotne. What 1natters it if thou hast three pages to fill, a chapel oration, long past due, to write, daily recitations to prepare, con11nencetnent essays to crib and lectures to sleep through? Be of good cheer. I repeat, bettet days will co1ne -days when thou shalt be free fr01n christian evidences, when chapel orations shall he past, when chapel attendance itself shall be as a tale that is told. Re1nernber what distinction is therein as the head of so widely recognized and influential a sheet as the CoNCORDIENSIS. Do you re1nen1ber Credmon? how he wandered out atnong the oxen in the stables? How the spirit co1nmanded hitn to sing and he sang as few have sung since. All thou lackest is inspira- tion, and that I will give thee. Here is the thetne and\- ''Well, old Sarchastn ! going over to Perk?\ yelled another voice that startled the editor from his n1usings. \No I'1n n~t go- ing over to Perk,\ growled he. \What did , you wake me up for, you blatned thing? I was drean1ing.\ \Why didn't you tell me you were asleep, ugliness; how do you suppose I knew you were dreatning ?\ rejoined the other. ''Well, how could I tell you I was asleep when I was asleep, and how did I know I was asleep till I woke up, and after I woke up I wasn't asleep, was I?\ said the editor ; but he talked to etnpty space for the other was gone, and the place knew hitn no n1ore. Then he counted up his words and found he had written only about enough for one colutnn. But he hadn't any 111ore titne, so he locked up his 1nanuscript, cleaned his nails, put on his chtnn's new neck- tie and started for the recitation room. In the Algebra class last tenn the professor tliatked out an exa1nple upon the board and the answer obtained was zero. One of the stu- dents, who had n't attetnpted to do it, said : '' Professor, that is the sa1ne answer I got.\ Upon further investigation it was found the stu- dent obtained a 1nark of zero, and so the whole thing was squared, or rather zeroed.

It was a wann, bright day in April, and I had started out in the country for a little run. I an'l quite an enthusiast in athletics, and it has always been the height of tny atnbition to be- coJne a noted runner. I had chosen an unused road for tny dai'ly running course for two rea- sons. It was sn1ooth and quite level, and I wished to avoid tneeting anyone. You know a running costutne is quite an abbreviated one, so to speak, and it is quite embarrassing to tneet one of the fair sex while so arrayed. Well, this afternoon I had gone about three- quarters of a n'lile when I saw, in a stnall piece of woods. near the road, a young lady apparent- ly sear.ching for flowers-arbutus, I prestuned. With her was a dog-a big dog. I saw the dog. The dog saw rne. I say he saw tne, for he took a bee line straight towards tne, and to all appearances thought I was some new kind of game. Now, I like clogs-nice dogs ; but this was a vulgar, vicious looking dog, and, naturally, when I saw him cotning I increased tny space and purposed to retnove tnyself fro1n the proxi1nity of so ugly looking a brute. I heard the young lady call: \Here Dash, cotne back! Dash! Dash ! cotne right back here !\ That rather scared tne for she acted frightened, and besides that Dash didn't '' cotne back.\ Then I thought of all the people who had been bitten by dogs and had died fron1 hydrophobia ; thought of Pasteur, of 1ny unprottted calves, wished for tny class cane, and all the while that cursed dog gaining on tne at every jurnp. I had quite a start of the dog, and if I hadn't aCted so like a confounded ninny I n1ight have stopped, got a club and beaten off Dash, and besides that, I rather thought he would stop after a short dis- tance. But no; he was no hundred-yards Dash, or even a two-twenty ; in all probability he could keep that pace for a n1ile or two, and I was getting tired. Just then the road turned and went around by the other side of the woods, and Dash's mistress lost sight of us. I was get- ting desperate, and as the only tneans of escape tnade for a high rail fence and 1nounted the top rail just as the ugly brute rushed up. He n1ade

THE CONCORDIENSIS. one jun1p at n1e but couldn't reach n1e, so he just stood and glared at n1e. I ·waited a levv n1inutes hoping that he would go away, and all the while praying that his tnistress wouldn't con1e up and find n1e in this ridiculous predic- atnent. Then I tried coaxing, but every tin1e I tried to n1ake any advances or to clin1b down off the fence he would show his teeth, grow 1 and con1e for tne. Here was a pretty state of afElirs. Treed on a rail fence by an ugly clog. Wouldn't that tickle the fellows if they heard of it? I tried to pull out a stake so that I n1ight have sotne- thing for protecrion. But no; I couldn't. Then I looked for stones on the other side of the fence. Not a_ stone was in sight. The only thing to be done was to sit there ancl wait for release. It was getting late, and presently the sun went down. This seetn to have son1e effeCt on Dash., or else he was getting hungry, for· he gave 1ne one terrible don't-you-dare-n1ove look, shook hitnself, and then started off on a little trot and was soon out of sight. That evening, while calling, I 1net Miss Mary Burrows, a rather pretty young lady and a very good coversationalist. I noticed she wore son1e arbutus, and upon asking her where she found it she exclai1ned: ''A little way out in the country, and 0, Mr. West, I had such a funny adventure.\ _._.L\nd then she related just \vhat I have told you, only fron1 a different point of view. It's queer how funny things appear to sotne people, while to others they don't see111 funny at all. Miss Burrows laughed very heart- ily as she told how that ugly Dash chased that student up the road, and though I tried to laugh with her I couldn't feel tickled the least bit. \tVhen she asked n1e if I kne\i\' who that fellow could be I very graciously lied, and said no. I 1net Miss Burrows quite frequently after that and, in fact, becan1e quite ena1nored with her. Sotne way or other she tnanaged to n1en- tion th::tt horrible adventure with the clog, and I was kept in terror all the while for fear that she would find out who that fellow was. Well, our field day cmne off in May, and I entered several events and, with tny custo1nary luck, was badly beaten. Miss Burrows was present at the gan1es and see1ned quite surprised to see n1e running. '··• Why, Mr. West,'' she said after the gatnes, \I didn't know you \iVere a runner.\ \0 yes!'' I replied, \I run quite a considerable; that is, I have practiced quite a considerable; I used to run up through the woods nearly every afternoon.'' No sooner had I said this than I saw that if she could put two and two together and 1nake fou-r that I had let the cat right out of the bag. Of course she would rerne111be 1 • that afternoon when she was after arbutus, and taking that day's adventuTe, together with the fact that I used to run up there afternoons she, 'Yith a wornan's capacity foT jurnping at conclusions, would naturally con- clude that I was the young 1nan whotn Dash had chased .. I noticed that she s1niled at sotne- thing, and of course that vvas what she wa:s s1niling at. Soon after that day the Juniors gave a b~tll. I took Miss Burrows, and was as attentive as possible. While we were seated at an open window resting and enjoying ourselves a JunioT who1n I hated, and vvho also V\-ras partial to Miss Burrows, catne up and claitned her for the next nutnber. She apparently unwilling to leave tne alone introduced n1e to a n~iddle aged gentle- n1an-Major Price-and then whirled awa:y with Cowan. Well, the Major and I becan1e great friends itntnediately, and he began to re- late his experiences for the last twenty years. I wasn't in good hutnor to see Cowan waltzing with Miss Burrows and couldn't help looking ugly and watching the1n all the while. I won- dered what she was saying to hin1. I saw her look towards us once and stnile. Then she told Cowan so1nething and they both looked over there and aCtually grinned. What could she be telling hi111? Great guns ! Had she told hi tn that dog story? She n1ust have for he looked itntnensely tickled and evidently considered it a good joke. Now it would be all over college and I would be the laughing stock of all. AU this while the 1najor had been firing aw[iy at me and I hadn't heard a word he had said. I wasn't in the best of hu1nor that night when we started for hotne. Miss Burrows noticed it, evidently, for she ren1arked : ''You n1usn't n1 ind that little occurrence, Mr. West. I - \ \' )t. ¥ ~~ ·-

She didn't laugh a bit and declared she never thought of such a thing as n1y being the unfortunate runner. She bas never told anyone about it, and when. we stood by that identical rail fence one June afternoon and watched the sun set, a little scene was enaCted which is a far better the111e for a stoxy than 111 y first encounter vvith Dash ; a scene which I have good cause to retnernber; a scene jn which certain declara- tions were 1nade by which Miss Burrows becmne Mrs. West and Dash and I becarne good friends. ----------------- ----- -M -- Spring.

By a vote of the College, given at a recent college rneeting, lYiadison U ni vcrsity vvas ad- tnitted in the Inter-Collegiate Athletic Associ- ation. Prof. Truax spent his vacation in \Tirginia. He left before the end of the tern1, but his different classes, however, found he had left his exan1in.ation papers. The bricks in front of the donnitorics are being taken up and replaced by sod. This, with the tnany other itnprovetnents, n1akes the colleges look very inviting and cleanly. A running track a sixth of a n1ile in circuit has been laicl out in the vacant field back of the Powers building. The track is ten feet vvide, has two straight sides and a good hundred yards course. Instructor C. vV. Van Dervcer super- intended the work. On April zd, a portion of the class of '89 sal- lied forth vvith \plugs\ and canes and paraded the principal streets of the city.

The Mechanicville JJ£ercurv contains .... the following report: The concert and social entertaintnent given under the auspices of the Ladies' Aid society at the.Methodist Episcopal church last evening was a pronounced success. A large audience was . present to hear the Union College Glee club, of ' fifteen tne1nbers, and nearly every selection pre- sented was heartily applauded. The college boys sang well, and a nutnber of then1 have ex- ceptionally fine voices. The efforts ofBrennan, Funnan, Randall, Culver and Dillinghatn were especially well received. After the concert everybody was invited to the church parlors, where the ladies served ice crPam and cake, and where the social festivities lasted until a late hour.. The college boys~fterwards went out on a serenading tour. They passed under our own window but di~ not lift theit voices in song, as they were intent upon seren.ading the acadetny young ladies. The entertain1nent netted the Ladies' Aid society about $5o above all expenses. Cremation. The Freshtnen, agreeable to an old custon1, cremated their algebra on the last day of last terrn. The night V{as wann and pleasant, which had the effect of bringing out an unusu- ally large crowd. The Freslunen had a cotn- paratively easy ti1ne and tnade a successful \elitn- ination\ of their arch enen1y \Robinson.'' The start was. tnade frotn No. \four and fron1 there they rnoved along the college grove road to the residence of Hanson, vvhere their coffin was hidden ; frotn there they proceeded down town where an extended line of tnarch was indulged in. Large crowds of people were assetnbled all alC?ng the tnarch, and the ''townies\ refrained frotn their usual salutes of eggs and decayed fruit. Not so with the Soph01nores, for when the Freshtnen entered the grounds a perfect volley of eggs, etc., awaited thetn, at which tin1e, also, a hose of water was turned upon the line of white clothed fonns, but the streatn neither drowned anyone nor did the coffin float off; but undaunted by the flood the Freshtnen proceeded to the centre of the catnpus, where a large fire was 1nade and their complete pro- gratntne carried out. At about two o'clock the class disbanded, all conscious that a hard day's work had been accotnplished, and all thankful that it had been so successful and that no one was hurt. We are glad to see that there has been a growing tendency atnong Sophon1ore classes to let Fresh1nen have a cremation, undisturbed, and no doubt if the disagreetnent had not occurred, just before the cretnation, between the two classes, the class of '88 would have turned in with '89 and helped them. j . ..,r

The season was opened by a gatne between the Sophotnores and Freshn1.en on the I zth. Both nines played well, but the Freshtnen were viCtorious. The follovving is the score by in- . n1ngs: '88-1 '89-1 7 8 3 4 0 0 0-II O-I3 The second ga1ne for the class chan1pionship of the Yates cup was played on the I 7th, by the Seniors and Juniors. The gan1e was character- ized b.y good batting and poor fielding. The . score IS: '86-6 '87-6 I 2 2 I 0 0 3-I2\ 0-9 The third ga tne took place on the I 9th be- tween the Juniors and Freshtnen. The Freshtnen played a good gatne and are regarded as the con1ing cl!arnpions. The score is: '87--2 I I 0 O--· 4 '89--5 2 I 4 O-I2 The fourth gatne between the Seniors and Sophon1ores was begun on the 28th, but was ,_. called at the end of the second inning on account of rain. The score at that titne was 9 and 2 in favor of the Seniors. In all probability the schedule of class gatnes will be carried out cotnpletely for the first titne in a ntunber of years. This is as it should be, and the direCtors are to be cointnended for their energy. The \Varsity.\ Spaulding's bats and balls are used this year instead of Reach's. Two lan1entably weak points in the nine are the batting and base running. In the Troy garne there were only three base hits, and Dar- win was left on third base three titnes. It is hardly good n1anners or policy during a ball gatne for the students to tnonopolize the seats provided for speCtators. It doesn't look well to see the seats occupied by students while the walk is filled with ladies for whotn there are no seats. Besides, we must ren1.e1nber that those who pay to see a g-arne are not likely to cotne twice if they receive no better accon1n1o- dations than standing T00 m. Let the students provide their own seats a..nd leave the benches to the outside speCtators. I1nproven1ents are the onler of the day, but so far have been entirely ootJ. fined to south college. About a dozen students were engaged during vacation in painting the sections, the chapel and the blue gate. New steps are also being put in front of the seCtion doo1·s. The \Varsity\ played its first gatne on the 21st with the ScheneCtady Citys. Up to the seventh inning the gan1e was a good exhibition of ball playing, but in that inning the Citys be- cc-nne too fatniliar with McDonald's curves and batted thetn all over the field. The Cit~ys are a strong nine and heavy hitters. The college nine played a fair ga1ne, but did not show up as well as was expected. '['he new tnen showed the need of experience.
