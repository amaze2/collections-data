The letter to the editor which appears on this pa.g•' toclay was as much nf a surprise to as as it pn>lmbly is to most of the campus. a lid apparently. to the Administration. \\' e <tl'e ashanwcl to say that the situation de- scribed tlH·rein went as unnoticed by this Hewspapel· as it llitl by enryoBe ebe. Cmnpus cynics will laugh at it as thL'Y do at every- thing· el~e t[mt toUClll'S upon sul.Jjecb of a serious nature. The fault, then, does nt t !'est with the Psi l\s the Anministration or ~·ou or I, but can be laid dirPctly to a current of feeling which must UL' thru\\\ll away when the nation b at war.

Aftet· he had found that out, -- ----0 And yet, as the writer of the letter appm·- eutly does, we feel that the situation is in reality a very sad reflection upon the attitude of the college in general toward the war. Dur- i·ng the years between World War I and the cuneut conflict, there was built up in the minds of America'~ youth a distaste-~·es. even a fear for a whole series of practices which came to be lmown a~ \flag waving.\ While the youth of other nations was being taught that the individual was merely part of the nation, that the destiny of that indi- vidual was Ullswerving· loyalty to the state, whate\'er it mig-ht cost, American youth was learning that America had elitered the last war because she was duped by p1·opagandists It seems to us that the duty of keeping the national emblem waving above a colleg;e cam- pus rests squarely with the Administration. With all the uncertainty which exists over the length of dUl'ation for any given student in Union College these days, any anangement such as the one which has been in effect for the past two years would only bring about a recurrance of the present problem. Beyond this, it would seem probable that a college employee, whose actual \job\ it was to take care of the flag, would be capable of doing a \.Jetter job of it than would the student volun- teer, no matter how conscientious.

Also, we take without a mmmm· the numerous ·words of c1·iticism which come our way. \\'e try only to explain the difficulties under which we m·e forced to worl<, hope that the critics will un- derstand, and go back to our job, hoping that we may be able to avoid the same mistake next time. story announcing the nate of the December graduation and pertinent particulars was never given to the college newspaper. It was pro\.Jably too much to expect that we would get it in time for last Thm·sday's paper, for after all, it was then only two days old. But we do not think it was too much to expect that we should be given the story for this issue. But we weren't. We got our material from one of the city newspapers which car- ried it late last week.

But Robert Bishop, for he is the fellow whom everyone has seen at some time or other with a flag tucked under his arm going to or coming from the North College Dormitory, for two solid years voluntarily kept up this I tedious job of putting up the flag 1 and taking it down ao;ain. every 1 day, whethet· it was nice we!lther I or 10 degrees below zero. Few havP: been thankful for th's <ervice. · which even under plain peaceful conditions should be an unceasing dut1 to the campus, but which in: wartime attains a position of dire ' must. I This incident and all that is con- nected with it would have never i r·eached the public if Robert Bishop would remain the eternal student at Umon. But he is graduating: this December and in view of that ' fact saw it fit to seek eomebodv els~ to take ovPr the flagpole ger~­ ice for him. He found two fresh- men who seemed to agree and actu- ally did hoist the flag for about ten da) s. But then the usual human element set in, and a gradual de- crease in ftag appearances occm·1·ed Therefore, if someone notices that the story which we carry on our front page today conceming the December granuation is a little more than a week late, and is thereby g-iven toward criticism of our ne\vs-gathering system, we will follow our usaal course, ex- cept that we will explain our difficulties in this instance in advance of the criticism. ThE' g lad to g-ive them to you,\ and we take this which eventually resulted in the utter disappearance of said flag advice without retort and with only a whim- sical smile. \People\ just don't seem to be of the same mind. But remember, we're not complaining·. We're just explaining. THE ALUMNI VIEW Thi:; wa\ to be expected. because I doubt whether among the present 700 fellow~ at Union ther<> is one who has B·ishop's sense of rc:J;>r.nsi- bility and persistence. But what a .. ,azes me is that the Administration again showed no signs of perturbance and took no 'let ion. A. member of the Class of X89.J. called the other day and asked that the follo\ving ques- tion be put to the Student Body which has been expressing itself so heartily against the proposal to change the location of the Idol: FinallY, la~t Saturcta·r I got IT\' \c:msus belli\ to star·t this letter rolling, which \ had felt like writ- This, and we have suspected this all along, ing more than once befor~.

Brooklyn Poly in Final Meet Bill Ketz's cross-country team goes after its fifth win of the sea- son in its last meet with Breuklyn Poly this Satuz·day morning over the Van Co1utlandt Pa·rk 5 mile cour·se. The Gaz net run·ners a·re not expected to be extended in clearing the final hm d.le tc.) an undefeated season. In viPw of the toHgh counw which his men will have to cover this week, Bill Ketz.has been driving his runner:1 this week. The prospect for a clean r·ec·ord thi~ season. which is quite a change from last year when the squad won only one meet, is so l1Par th\t KPtz doPsn't want t.o take any chances. Brooklyn Poly took a 15-4() shel- laclling from CC~Y several weeks ago, and CCNY defea tPd RPI last week by 27-28. The only other check on Poly's squad is the time in which they have run thC' course. The scot es of the YeJ.lowjacl,ets to date i·nclude a 25-0 win over De- pauw in the opener, a 30-0 win over W. and J., a 14-0 conquest of RPI, the 6-0 loss to Amherst, a 33-0 win over Hamilton, a•nd finally a 41-0 shellacking to Allegheny. Jack Newton (26) gets a pat oil the ·back from Cliff Platt (96) just after catching Hal Enstice's pass for the- Garnet's first touc'hdown last week. Other Union players seen are Bartlett (82), Carroll (44), Howard (87) and May (49). Ketz will count on Captain Chuck Snell, Jim Quinlan, Art Highland, Clayton Long, and Jules Viglielmo to finish close together and the team balance is expected to give the Dutchmen victory even though Poly may have improved its time. Powerful Offense ----a Rochester has a powerful offense built around Jim Secrest, left half, who has scored 7'8 points this sea- son to put him in the number 1 spot in the Ea.stern scoring race. He has scored 48 points alone in the last two games. At right haJ.f the De- Groot men have Frank Walter who is an eq.ually good runner. Co-Cap- tain and fullback Moose Kramer, who caused the Dutchmen no end of trouble last year in the Yellow- jackets 19-6 triumph here, may give the Garnet a lot of trouble because he is !'. powerful plunger.

Grid ·Champions ~~~~yd~a~!:a~f pc;:_~i~ed w~!!er•al Available ______ _ White, Messenger, Cooch Are First-Day Track Wins The Rivermen have a strong line as well. At the ends they have Chuck Carman, who won honorable mention last year, and Walt Mene- gazzi, who is fully as good a wing. Jack Forsyth and Greg Thomas, a pair of 200 lb. tackles, have been towers of strength in the River- men's line this year. Mcmroe Cole and Jack Gair are slated to be at the guards, and Bill Moir, a Sche- nectady lad, who is a good defen- sive player will start at center. Lawrence will start his regular lineup with Cliff Platt and Johnny Newton at the wings, Bill Hill and Bill Howar at the tackles, Harvey Kayne and Dick Hoffman at the guards, Ken Sharpe at center, Reg- gie Carrol at quarterback, Bob Bartlett and Leroy Siegel at the halfbacks, and Hal Enstice at full- back. Chet Marvin may start at right half if Siegel's injury does not heal suf.ficiently to allow him to start. The Garnet has held long sessions. A powerful Williams College eleven handed the Dutchmen their first loss of the season last Satur·- day before an attendance of 5,000 per sons by the scare of 41-15. It was not an easy win by any means for the Purple as the Dutchmen came from behind and threatened to take the lead with but six min- utes to play remaining in the game. Superlative Blocking The Ephmen put on one of the finest exhibitions of blocking seen on Alexander Field in many years as they mowed down the Garnet secondary time and time again. Their line opened up holes for their big backs, Bill Orr, Pat Higgins, and Bill Schmidt, and their passing attack was also eifective, despite the fflct that four passes to men in the clear were dropped. The Dutchmen were outmanned physically in this contest. and as time wore on late in the game the reserve power of the Purple began to tell, but only after the Dutchmen !Continued on Page 41 Kappa Nu fraternity successfully defended its intra-mural touch foot- ball championship when it defeated Kappa Sigma ·fraternity, 14-0.

A few mo- ments later, Sy Meisel scored when he took a lateral pass from Bud Herman near the Kappa Sigma goal line after Herman had intercepted a Kappa Sigma pass on the 25.

In five short years, Union hns come to take fo-r granted that there would be an lnterfraten~ity Ball each aatumn. Yet many of the CHion men who dance tonight are very much aware of the probability that this will be the last dance of its kind for the duration. November, 1938-Union was well into its college year. Mrs. Roosevelt and Rexford Tugwell paid a visit to the Yale of the l.lo- hawk and the headlines of The Concordiensis acclaimed the fact with pride. The football team, with sophomore stat·s like l\lel'lin Brockmyer, Freddie Patrie and a fellow nam- ed Hamme1·strom leading the way, had just lost to v\'illiams and tied \' ermont and was pointing to its clash with Hamilton. The J.\Iountebanks were trying to forget their pro- duction of Elmer Rice's \Adding ;\lachine.\ Dorothy Canfield Fisher looked in on a tea given by Burges Johnson (in her honor, of course) and the Student Council was deep in a debate over the financial problems of the colleg·e band. A fire in the \Vashbmn Hall workshop of the :.\Iountebanks' theati·e caused $1S,OOO wo1'th of damage. A Union-inspired group of Capitol Distl'ict college students formed an organization which protested the brutal outrages being committed by the National Socialist Party in Germany and which was to raise funds for the resettlement of refugees from that coun- try. A group of men sat around a table in Munich and affixed their names to a piece of paper while America rejoiced in the name of World Peace and \Vent back to its favorite fall pastime-watching the New Yol'l< Yank- ees beat the Chicag·o Cubs in the Wol'ld Sel'ies. High spot of the fall season to most Union men in 1938 was, of course, the first Inter- fmtemity Ball. European troubles were so \'eQ· far away. A. Hitler was sharing the headlines with :\I. Hallet. That was five years ago. November, 19-12-Times have chang-ed. Things m·e still happening on the campus, but they're all ting-ed \vith anti-climax. The football team has lost to Williams and wiii \\'ind up a good season against Hamilton to- morrow, led, as in '38, by sophomores and, as a reminder of the times, freshmen. l\Irs. Roosevelt is visiting soldiers in England, not students at Union. Sam Hammerstrom is in the Navy and Nels Nitchrnan in the Coast Guard. The fact that the Yankees lost a World Series was news, to be sure, but Amer- ica was beginning to believe that the time for play had gone. A. Hitler has made a name for himself. Times have changed. But :i.\Ial Ha!Iet is back. As the Dance Com- mittee's choice, he has been the subject of no little amount of criticism. But he's here, and he's doing his part to give the college one last weekend. And here's our wish that it will be, in every respect possible, a typical \Union Weekend;\ that it will contain every bit as much enjoyment and romance and recreation as did the other four. So, before the cold, gray dawn of Monday moming blinds our bler.,ry, sleep-laden eyes, let's afford l\Iinerva one last smile. It'll be a long, long time before she smiles again. A stew of meat, car10ts, etc., plus 1 fl'w \well cooked\ potatoes and tea-bre:ld rounded out the evening meal. C1edit for the quality of the >tew was given to all, for at some time or other evet·ybody had Pluck 1 hand in it to \give it a tesl\. After dinner, speeches were made and the rest of the evening was spent in singing \the songs we love ~o well\. The Vassar girls, getting tired of such \kid stuff\ took a healthy plunge in the shimmering depths of the lake, much to the horror of all onlookers>. Your obse1·ver now pitched his little tent and \snuggled\ up in a little indentation and off into the land of nod. Rain broke loose about \half past\ and continued until about \quarter after\ with little suffering on the part of those who had migrated to the bottom of the sleeping bags in true outing club style. The sun broke through finally, accompanied by loud clattering of tin plates, in- dicating that breakfast was \on\. Your reporter still slept, so did not \suffer\ the oatmeal with the less fortunate \clubbers\. The day was gpent by the more ambitious ones scaling local cliffs and hurling huge boulders into the \foaming brine\. Those inclined to the quieter things in life spent their time yodeling -to the nearby cliffs and receiving echoes in return. We left the island, Rollar in name, and with a shong tail wind prodding us along, reached Bolton Landing late Sunday afternoon amid sprinkles of rain, so ending a most enjoyable and, on the part of some, a most profitable weekend tl'ip. FIFTY CANDLES The Union men on hand included Jack Schulz '43, Edward Knight '45, J. Clark Alberts '44, Gerald Dudley '46, Dick Schwindeman '43, Robert Haigh '44, Gerhard Leubner '43, Rawley Hickman '46, John Du- ford '43, Robert Breiling '44, Wally MacMillan '43, Ronald Macomber '43, Rex Moon '44, Pete Firra '45, Robert Brockhurst '45, Lansing Rosekrans '45, and Bud Farmer Back in 1890, fourteen young college stu- dents struggled by horse and buggy and trains to our campus from Clinton, New York, where, before a group of curious spec- tators, they battled with a group of Union- ites on Library Field in the first football game between these now archaic rivals- Union and Hamilton. The fact that they braved the elements and struggled through the mire to see who could push a potato shaped ball across the other's goal line on that memorable day, made it possible for these two colleges to compete year afte1· year, until today the series between the two teams is the longest continuous one in New York State. Tomorrow's game completes what has been anything but a mediocre season for the Dutchmen. Union men have watched a team that showed more than even the optimists thought possible in September. They have lost two games by tremendous scores, but don't forget who those teams we1·e. Don't forget, either, what happened when Union '45. played Vermont and R. P. I. It's been a good Chaperones included Gil Harlow year, and tomorrow's victory will make it and Mr. and Mrs. R. o. Swaim. ---0 complete.

Forty-four \'test women\ are on the job now, and others will report each week until the quota (I sol is reached. The girls will make computations, chart graphs, and cali- brate fine instruments for use in the machine- tool industry. :VI iss \\irginia Frey (U. of Michigan), one oi the 12 women in the country who re- ceived engineering degrees this year, is the only graduate engineer in the group. How- ever, each of the others has majored in either rna thematics or physics and has re- ceived training in both. Although no one expects these girls to become full-ffedged engineers, most of them will be given t:he Company's famous \test\ course. HI-YO, SILVERI BROTHER, can you spare a dime? Manufacturers don't really need it yet, but they are using more and more silver as other metals become increasingly difficult to get. G-E engineers, for example, are using silver in the manufacture of elec- tric apparatus in order to conserve tin, cop- per, and other scarce materials. There is now at least a little of the pre- cious metal in almost every motor, genera- tor, transformer, and other piece of equip- ment built by General Electric for the war. In many cases the use of silver adds to the cost -a consideration secondary to pro- duction at present. In these instances, its use is probably temporary. But in current-carrying contacts and in brazing alloys, the use of silver results in an improvement in quality sufficient to justify the greater cost. For these purposes, silver will very likely be used in even greater quantities after the war. General Electric Company, Schenectady, N. Y. G:ENERALfl ELECTR~~

SORRY, SUE We have said before, and will prolmbl~· say again, that the lot of a college editor today is not of the happiest. Indeed, when we strike out with a drowning· man's strokes for a st1·aw of humor, we seem fated to drag into our whirlpool some innocent individual with whom we have no quarrel and no particular connection. Although we've never been at all incensed at Sue Cohen, she has by coincidence been the butt of two of our attempts at humor. Apparently we've made her angry, and if we have, we're sorry. At any rate, by way of retribution, \Ve'll let you read what she wrote to us, and wish her the best of luck with her sarcasm, to appear, we presume, in print on Friday.

Ho\v- ever, there must have been a slip-up some- place as I never received the invitation to the festivities to which I was welcomed. This oversight hurts me deeply, but I am sure I shall manage to rise a\;Jove it. We noticed as we wrote the social news thi:;- week that many of our younger mem- bers attended your \big weekend\. In writ- ing up said column, any resemblance to sar- casm is purely intentional. Sincerely, Sue Cohen, Skidmore Hall PHI BET A KAPPA On all too many of us, the announcement that five men have been elected to Phi Beta Kappa will make very little impression. Even in days of peace, Phi Bete keys gain very little popular acclaim, and this acclaim is less- ened in these times of war. Whatever their accomplishment may mean to the five men who will soon be the possess- ors of Phi Bete keys in the da~'S to come, we are certain that it will mean this, at least: they have succeeded in what they set out to do when they came to Union College, and they have done \Vhat they did better than anyone else could. They have every l'eason to be proud of the honor with which they have been vested. And Union College has every reason to be proud of them. if I'd worked while I was here\ carries very little weight with us. Included in a man'.s ability in any line, and probably its most im- portant component, is his desire to do the job well, called by psychologists \motiva- tion.\ lf the motivation is absent, the man does not possess the \ability\, in any sense of the word, in our opinion. And that moti- vation, we suspect, is one of the most impor- tant factors in success for anyone, in civilian or in military life. The army or the navy or the marines will not hand a commission to . anyone who dangles a Phi Beta Kappa Key, i but they will most certainly reward an indi- 1 vidual for many of the same characteristics for which he was given that key. And so, to \the five\ whom we have known and watched at work, and most cer- The old phrase ··r could have been Phi Bete tainly envied, our congratulations. -~ .. -- ------- UCRS Monday 7:00-lo'red Waring 7:15-FO!· Your Enjoyment 7:30-Campus News 7:41}--H.
