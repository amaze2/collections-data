FATHER OES-TERREICHER Father Oesterreicher will speak£fr-------------- at tlie April meeting on Monday, April 14 at 7:30P.M. in Hale House. New officers will be elected at the same meeting, He will also speak at the Tuesday chapel program and will conduct a Newman Class in Bailey Hall 107 at 4:30 P. M. Tuesday afternoon. The Father was born of Jewish parents in Austria in 1904. Under the influence of Newman's De- velopment of Ohristian Doctrine, he entered the Catholic Church while a medical student at the University of Vienna. He then studied theology at the Univer- sities of Graz and Vienna, where he received · the Licentiate, and ordained a priest in 1927. In 1934, Father Oesterreicher founded the Opus Sancti Pauli, an institute. presenting Judaism as a question· of God. He was also edi- tor of Die Erfuellung (T'he Ful- fillment>, a bi-monthly review handling the same matter. After two narrow escapes from the Ges- tapo, once in Austria and once in France, he came to the United States in 1940. In New Yo-rk he held vari- ous parish assignments. His first curacy was at the Church of As- sumption and his last at Old St. Peter's, the mother-church of the Archdiocese of New York. He has also been Research Brofessor of Sacred Theology at Manhatten- ville College and is an associate editor of WoGrship as well as a member of the Catholic Theolog- (Continue<l on Page 4) Disobeying Rules At Jazz Concert Angers Davidson The Australian Jazz Ql.\lntet concert ·on Saturday !Light of Spring Prom Weekend, April 26, will be a trial to determine wheth- er jazz concerts may be held in Memor'ial Chapel in the future. President Carter Davidson made this announcement to the Con- cordiensis following a letter dated March 31, 195S, which sta.ted that as a result of unfavorable student conduct at the Errol Garner con- cert held in Memorial Chapel on Saturday, March 22, \no further jazz concerts can be held in the Chapel.\ Davidson adde<l a p-ostscript to his letter on April 9 which stated: \In view of the hard work of the sponsoring Committee, and our contract for the concert of April 26, (however), it has been decided to hold this eve11t in the Chapel. The committee will try to perfect some .controls with the help of the Fire and Pollee de- partments so that future ja~ con- certs can be held here. 'I'he April 26 concert will be the test.\ In his letter, Prexy referred to the fact that following the con- cert there were many beer bot- tles, glasses, peanut sh.ells and cigar and cigarette butts all over the seats and floors. He contin- ued: \We have made It dear to groups sponsoring suoli concerts in the past that unless they could control smoking and drlnlting in the Chapel we would have to ban such concerts in the i'ut11re. It is obvious tliat such concerts are giving the College a ·bad reputa- tion and this is an improp-er use of the College ChapeL\ Lawrence Kahn, Chairrnan of the Garner Concert, told the Om~ cordiensls, \I was shoclted to learn of the smoking at the con~ cert.\ The concert was nonetheless a financial success. Approximately 1,400 people attended the ooncert, and about $700 was netted. The profit will be applied to tile Jun- ior Prom. ---·o-- Changes Noted In Class Meetings An important change in dates for class election meetings has been noted by Don May, Chair- man of the Student Council Ele<:- tion Committee, The Junior Class will meet in Memorial Chapel at noon, Wed- nesday, April 16, whtle the So- phomore Class will hold Its meet~ ing on Thursday, April 17.

Policy Starting with this issue, editorials in the Conco1·diensis will not be initialed. The views expressed in this space represent the combined opinions of the senior members of the editorial boa:rd. Greater responsibility is inherent in such a program. Some, who before wel'e restrained by the knowledge that their writing would be initialed, now face no such barrier. It is up to the present and future members of the Concord· iensis to see that a level of good-taste is maintained so that a return to initialed editorials is not made necessary, Class Day Traditions; Resighted And Relived Each senior by this time is look- ing forward to the pleasantries of graduation weekend, the culmin- ation of a 4 or 5 year sojourn at Union. Among the 'inelange of planned activities for that week- end in early June is one that is rather colorful and enchanting. Class Day is its name. This Sen- iOI' farewell ex:ercise fairly drips in a heavy coating of tradition, a commodity that seems to be high- ly sought after at Union College. The 1958 Offioors And what comprises the tradl· tion in Class Day? Well, the very names of the Class Day Officers should·ee· self explanatory. The various roles and their officers for this June Uth are: Ivy Orator, Simeo Gallo; Pipe Orator, William Wintersteen; Keeper of the Jug, Robert Sullivan; Class 'Marshals, William Cole and John Erasure; Historian, John Glass; Chaplain, David Horton; Prophet, Richard Murcott; Songleader, Sheldon French; and Poet, Robert Schoen- feil1. Gerald DePass, President of the Senior Class, wlll offic'iate at the ceremonies. tr.ates the changing quality of Class Day. The officers in the first recog- nizeable Class Day were Presi- dent, Orator, Poet. Valedictorian, Historian, Prophet, Secretary, Marshal, and two Aids. By com- parison with this year's list we see that important innovations have been added. Perhaps the most fundamental and necessary of these changes to keep the g1amour of the Day has been the addition of the Keeper of the Jug, a sort of self-styled bartender. But that is how tradition is pre- served at., Union! ---o--- The National Students Associa- tion has made available to Union College students the facilities of their Educational Travel Pro- gram for summer travel to Eu- rope. Interested students are urged to contact Gene Cassidy, N.S.A. representative on campus, for details. Surprisingly low cut facilities are available to students for this tour. It is not necessary, how- ever, to become inv(}ived In a tour in order to avail oneself of the assistance offered. News Item: President Carter Davidson announ<!ed that the AJQ c~nce>r.t wo-uld be a trial. Trial The prime function of Memorial Chapel is to serve . as a sanctuary. We are in complete accord with the a<il'- • ministration in feeling that this sanctual'Y is desecrated when alcoholic beverages and cigarettes a..re used within its walls. We feel, however, that the decision to condemn the · entire student body because of the' irresponsibility or indiscretion of a few is unfortunate. Thel'e are always members of a society who will break the law if they are • allowed to remain. unpunished. It is unfair to punish the many because of the immature few. In the past, student conduct at major weekends has been less than praiseworthy. Conduct at the jazz con- certs held in Chapel has been improving~ however. We therefore hope that at the Australian Jazz Quintet con- cert on Saturday evening of Prom weekend, student behavior will be irreproachable. Banning jazz from the Chapel should be. used only as a last resort, however. We believe that with proper education throughout the yeal'..t and with proper policing at the concerts, undesirable conduct in the Chapel can . be eliminated. The Administration has made itself pe1·fectly clear that the forthcoming concert will be a test to determine whether future jazz programs are to be held in the Chapel. In the light of what has happened in recent years, their point is understandable. Yet the Adminis- tration's ruling that henceforth every jazz concert to be held on campus will be a trial on wllich the fate of following concerts hinges is unfair. Projecting ip.to the future, what will happen should this concert, and the next few, all remain decorus? We feel then that the rule should be rescinded. If the students of Union College can prove that they know'.the conduct becoming to a chapel, by exhibiting this conduct at a series of concerts, we then hope that should a situation arise where a few people should smoke or drink in Chapel, action will be taken against them as individuals, and not against tile College com- munity as a whole. We would like to take this opportunity to enter an open plea to all those attending the neJCt few concerts, moreover, that proper conduct may be maintained, so that the future of jazz concerts in Mem()rial Chapel will be assured, and not remain on -a concert to concert basis. But beyond the exotic names of the officers, the exact history and origins of Class Day are vague.

It's a vare chance tostudy.advanced engi:neering and get full pay at the same time. These \students\ are .guided by a teaching staff of top Western Electric engineers, outside ·experts and professors frotn leading universities. They're learning the latest technical developm.ents .•• boning up on everythin:g from maaufacturing processes to com- puter applications. When the program reaches its ·peak,. some 2,000 to 3,()0() West- ern Electric engineers VliU attend each year ..• studying ih. an atmos- phere as close to a university grad- uate school as is practical for industry. This engineering \oniversity:\ was born because of the ever- increasing complexity of Western Electric's job as the m~nlifactur­ ing and supply unit of the Bell Telephone System. Today W. E. engineers are right in the middle of exciting fields like microwave radio relay, electronic .switching and automation. Graduate engi- neering training is designed to spur their development and advance· mellt throughout their .careers. Besides ·taking part in the Grad- uate Engineering Training Pro- .grarn, engineers are eligible for our Tuition Refund Plan for after hours study at nearby colleges.

Social Code Review The reg-ulations governing social conduct at Union are archaic and virtually unenforceable. With a major party weekend approaching, we feel that the rules should be re- examined. In the areas concerning the presence of female visi- tors above the first floor of the dormitories or fraternity houses especially, the regulations m·e inadequate and un- realistic. The penalty for the aforementioned violations of the social code is a possible expulsion. We believe that eng-aging in these practices is neither unreasona'ble nor immoral; therefore they should not be classified as illeg-al. Union is often compared in many respects with other institutions, such as Amherst or Hamilton. Yet the social rules at these colleges, and at other schools comparable to Union as far as size, and academic and social standards are concemed, make the Union social code seem extremely outmoded. • At Amherst, for example, female visitors are per- mitted in the upper stories of fraternity houses on week- day nights until 9 P.~I. On Fridays and Sundays the time is extended until 11 :30, and on Saturdays until 12:30. At Hamilton, RPI and Tufts recent rule changes have estab- lished that women may be in the dormitories at specified times during- the day. By initiating such codes these schools have shown a trust in the student body to act with discretion and with conduct becoming to mature, intelligent men. At Union, on the other hand, students, especially independents who in many cases have not even a ground floor to entertain a girl, are severely punished if they are caught with a girl on the second floor of the campus living- quarters. That the present rules of social conduct are so loosely enforced, moreover, adds stl'ength to the conviction that Union's rules are outmoded. The situation bears a more than a faint resemblance to Prohibition days, when the reg- ulations concerning alcoholic beverages were ridiculed even by the officials whose duty it was to enforce them_ The College Bulletin reads: \Today ... students will find Union College rich in traditions, but young in spirit, vigorous in its approach to the problems of today and tomorrow, and ready and able to serve its students by preparing them for usefulness il'l the mod~rn world.\ Vigoumess in academic matters alone is not the answer to the problems of today and tomon-ow. We feel that a reorganization of Union's social code, along more modern lines, will add a truer ring to the words of the College Bulletin. \ l l , ••• a poem as ove y as a ••• '58's ·Quest For Jobs By Melvin S~ Einh9rn Indicative of economic reces- sion .is a lack of jobs. Many theorists are trying to account for it, to suggest solutions and to predict its outcome. The current J:eccsslon is being felt nationally. Sales are reduced. Manufacturing lessens accordingly. Personnel is fired. The future is unsure. Jobs Are Few ln the face of this, Uni\On's seni0r Class is anticipating graduation. Last commencement saw all but a f~'I.'V seniors .securing jobs .prior to graduation. According to Mrs. Helen Bonlen, Administrative As- sistant under Henry J. Swanker, Director of Placement (who was in conference when we ·called), mnny mt>mhers of the Class of 1958 will be unable to get jobs upon receiving their diplomas. With the cutback in aval.lable positions, employers have become excessively selective. The usual procedure of personal interviews, arranged through the Placement Bureau, will assist fewer students as fewer companies are sending recruiters to evaluate potential employees. Employers are look- ing for long-term candidates. Men who have completed mili- tary service cop .first considera- tion. Personality and ·grades are relegated to a slightly less prom- inent position In the scheme of :(avorable attributes. Many men are seeking the mlli'- tat·y as a solution. While fulfill- ing their obligation, they are ac- quiring a security factor, which wiU facilitate obtaining desirable work after their release. Some Union College ·seniors are going to companies which are not interviewing applicants here. Re- sults on this account often turn up in justifiable success. For ex- ample, employer and employee become thoroughly familiar with each ·other before obligations are made, and more permanent rela- tionships are logically antici- pated. But this is only an acci- dentally favorable influence on a wholly unfavorable situation. Recession Larger P1·oblem The problem of placement;, is part of a larger problem, that of economic instability. When top- level solution of the recession GOmes about, alleviation of de- pendent difficulties wm concur. We learn by suffering. Let us hope we learn.

It may take a little searching, ·~;but . , it is often well worth the ef- fort. On Sunday, The Woman's Allia-nce of the All Souls UI:Iit- arian Church presented a re- cital of Eliza- bethan and Ba- r.oque music. Featured were the Union College Recorder Ensem- .ble, a quartet, and a sin!l'er of ·ballads accompanied on lute. The Recorder Ensem'bl'e (con- taining such ·cam~us luminaries as Dean Huntley, Professors HainebaC')l, Peterson, Girdner and :Fried, and ably aided by students Mordecai Braunstein, and Edward Prager) ·opened the program with three trios by Dufay, a fifteenth century composer, . The gremp was a bit cold at the start. It was not till they launched into thei-r second piece, a suite of Cor- ell'i's, that their ha;rmonles be- came coherent. Bach is Reflective The recorder is a moody instru- ment. It lends itself well to haunting minor melodies. The Ensemble was most effective on a group of three Eng'lish ·ballads, which were excellently suited to these attri'butes. The Recorder Ensemble con- cluded its portion ·of the program with three Bach Chorals. Bach sounds strang.e on recorder. Rather than liorcefu'l, it 'is reflec-· tive; rather than brlight, it is sad.

I- FOR OVER bO YEARS \. I Doubtless you have all noticed the sudden disappearance of some once conspicuously large and old trees from campus. Perhaps you have been one of the many who have commented on the unimagi- native manner in which our late- ly 'noble elms have been cut (\brush\ style) as close to the roots as modern power equipment would permit. If it has seemed that rhyme and reason are ab- sent, and that Union is soon to be a treeless campus, may I suggest that you trust the judgment of many interested experts, and learn the facts which Introduce rationality to our seemingly dras- tic clipping. Amel\lcan Elm Stricl1en Almost all of the trees that have been removed thus far are American Elm trees, stricken with the Dutch Elm disease. The fungus that causes the trees to die is carried by a beetle. For the botanically or zoologically minded, the beetle is the Scolytus Multiferatus. This interesting in- sPct breeds only in the bark of dead elm trees. In the first two weeks of May, it manages to in- flict the elm with the fungus dis- ease it carries. Dr. William Winne, professor and acting chairman of the Bi- ology department, informs us that the way in which the disease spreads is through the roots of elms that are growing close to- gether. The roots intertwine, and the fungus is passed from one in- fected tree to another. Of course the beetle's mobility helps to ac- ciunt for the wide-spread occur- ence of the disease in the North- east. Several hypotheses have been offered by Dr. Winne to explain By Melvyn Schnall why the Dutch Elm disease will probably not mean the complete infectitm and death of the Elm tree. There may be, on the one hand; certain strains of the Elm tree which are resistant to the The famous N ott EI:m pictured above feU victim to Dutch Ebn disease and was cut do.wn In 1937, aft.Pr apJllroximat.Ply 300 yeru·s on the campus. fungus. Second1y, sundry weather conditions may ultimately kill off the beetles, at least in certain parts of the country. As a third, almost deJ:Jperate hope, the fung\1!> may undergo mutation, and lose its present noxious nature. One tree expert suggests replacing dis- . eased elms with more elms, see- ing the ultimate development of an Elm. strain completely resist- ant to the disease. .Perhaps the most promising means of preserving the Ameri- can Elm comes from man's own scientific approach to the prob- lem. Although chemical warfare against the fungus has thus far proved ·relatively ineffective, new Ideas may come along. Union plans to use sprays this spring in order to stop the bug in its (em- bryonic} tracks. So far, however, the most fruit- ful approach to the problem has been the removal of diseased trees, especially When they are located near other Elms. The trees removed are burne4,.-i:i:nme- diately in the city dump, and no wood from them is used for regu- lar firewood. Huntley, Harlow Interested The problem of control of the Dutch elm disease is one in which many people are interested. Our own Garden Committee on campus, under the chairmanship of Dr. Gilbert Harlow, is one in- tensely interested ,group. Dr. C. William Huntley is very illterest- ed in trees and has followed the development of the disease and its control very closely. A. ladies' gar- den society in Schenectady do- hated some money to the college, part of which was used to pur- chase a power saw for the swift removal of dead Elms. Of course, Nevertheless, there is something we oa.n do to show our respect for freedom and democracy. We can, as our forefathers d·id and as stu- dents all over the world do, write letters, hold meetings and stage demonstrations. We can show the world that people 'in this coun- try do not fully back our govern- ment's support of fascist nations . We can show the world that Un- ited States' ·students are not po\ litical zombies. Union College students once made the radical proposal to in- itiate Greek Letter fraternities on campus. Now is the time for Un'ion College students to take another radical step, to actively sup.port the cause of freedom. If any one 'is interested in form- ing a student organization for democratic action, please contact me. our very active and enthusiastic grounds committee has worked hard on the problem. It seems now that one <>f the big questions facing U,nion, tree- wise, is that of what trees to choose for replacement purposes. The most popular so- far have been the •:Ash, Red Maple, Sugar Maple, and Tulip. Others have been tried, for example the ~el­ tov!,l. treee, wh!eh is supposed to be nearest to the IDlm. The Zel- tova is sort of an il).appr.opriate mixture of tree- and bush, and is a poor substitute. Those who know trees are doing some deep thinking about planting at Union, with great consideration for the future, and with some new plans regarding landscaping on ca:mpus. In the meantime, we will have to bear the wo-ui;lds to the cam- pus, and await the growth of the new generation of trees. 268 STATE STREET- SCHENECTADY, N.Y.

So next time you 11ela:x:, at home or friendly tavern, treat your thirst to the bright; .taste in beer-that's Genesee I place. Whet•her or not the •bats- man hits the · ball, he is permlitted to ~run but i-s never under . any · . compulsion tq d · o this. · Fa:r more •common ways of put- ting a man out are: 1. by bowling him (.i.e. the ibowler hits the wickets with the ball in his orig- inai delivery) ; 2. by catching the baN after having touched the · bat but ·before it tQIUches the ground. (Any memher of the fielding side can d,o th-is) ; or 3. :Oy being L.RW. (where the · batsman stops . a ball either accidentally or otherwise from hitting the wickets with any part of his body ot.her thall, his hands. L.B.W. stands for leg be- fore wicket). The main task of the bowler is of course to get the batsmen out witfu - as few runs scored against his team as JWsslble. T()- acbleve this, the bowler attempts to present the ball iil as difficWt a hitting pns'ition as possible, but by still trying to llit the wlclcets. He can try this in various ways such as Sheer spet>d, spin a.nd accuracy. In bowling a bali, a. bowler is allowed to ta.ke a long a run as he wants but it not al- lowed to flex his arm during ~­ ijvery Of the ball (i.e. he must not throw tlie ball at aJJ).
