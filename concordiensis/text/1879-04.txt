JusT as we go to press· \ve have to record that \that fence,\ so facetiously ref erred to by our contributor, ~' Randon1,\ has ''gone to that burn whence no fence returns.\ The in1mediate cause of the disappearance seetns to have been some mischievous students. \V e can hard I y believe that this was done so much with any rnalicious intent as with the hope that the old fence might be replaced by one 1nore worthy of our grounds. Yet, be justified and deserves hearty conde In na- tion by all \V ho like good order. All under- handed attetnpts to gain even good ends are unn1anly and \vrong. But the thing is done,. ho\vever n1uch to be regretted, and cannot be undone. We hear that a ne\v 'Wire fence is soon to be built. \V e trust that the report is true.

'fHE NE\V catalogue of the college is an improven1ent on the one published last year. It has the merit of stating the truth,. a n1erit vvhich n1any college catalogues do not possess. Fe\v things are held out as in- ducements that are not living facts, capable of being realized by all \V ho enter Union College. The faculty-roll, as published, pre- sents only the names of those professors . \V hose instruction n1a y be had in actual class- room \vork. T'he feature most to be re- marked is the ne\v curriculum. We cannot discuss all the changes that have been made, but only a fe\v of the n1ore important. Chen1istry will hereafter en1brace one term's work instead of t\vo as forn1erly. This is peculiarly gratifying to us inasmuch as it is a change \Ve insisted upon in a forn1er issue.
