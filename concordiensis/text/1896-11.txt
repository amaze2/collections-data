The banquet of the Freshrnan class was held on the·evening of election day, Nov. 3, at Hotel Edison. The Freshmen had succeeded in keeping the date secret until the afternoon of the banquet, and them the Sophon1ores made an attetnpt to lock up one or two of the class, but tl1:ey were un·su:ccessful, for a date had been chosen when mqst of the Sophs were away, and the few that were here evidently thought it best not to inter- fere. At half past nine, the Freshtnen, to the num- . her of twenty-nine, and thirteen upper classtnen entered the dining hall. After discussing a fine menu, the toasbnaster, Williatn Dewey Loucks, welcomed the tnembers of the class of '97 and '98, and announced a fine list of toasts which were responded to as follows : . 1900, Paul J.

The third foot baH game of the Starin Cup series was played on the catnpus Wednesday afternoon between the Juniors and Sophomores and resulted in a victory for the Juniors by a score of I 2 too.

Editor of The Concordiensis :- The question has be.en asked. .again and again, \Why does Union not win a game at foot ball?\ One u1ight ask with equal propriety,. \Why do not Union's orators and ·debators win?\ The most general answer to the former question is: Because the team is: not strong enough. The latter question has not been honored with a definite answer, nor even soberly considered. We are all tired criti- cising and being criticised, but how can we expect to avoid either unless we remove the cause. This can be done. We have two organizPd foot ball teams. and their rivalry is mutually beneficial as far as it goes. We have also literary society orators, fraternity orators, and class orators. But can it be said that their influence upon each other is mutually help- ful? Decidedly not. Very few fraternity speak- ers ever hear a literary society debate, and when speaking before the class we have no incentive to do our best. To what fact is our present weakness due? The answer is evident-lack of concentration. There is an abundance of power, but it is not developed because of the lack of organization and system and therefore, a lack of interest. There is no friendly rivalry among the ·different factions. A. great many think that even our prize de bating has degenerated into a lottery. Experience proves that when the fraterniti.es flourish the literary societies die. and the converse must follow as a necessary corollary. Now we give the English department credit for all its original ideas, but ,we venture to say that when five,hours a week of debating is regularly required the literary pro- grams of the fraternities will be reduced to a minimum, and the yawning literary societies will drop into a Rip Van Winkle nap. Why does not . Old Union concentrate and systematize her powers in the shape of a reg- ular organized course in elocution and public speaking; under a competent instructor ? Is it consistent with our history and dignity to allow prep-school undergraduates to attend our annual commencement exercises and criticise our stage performers? It is bad enough to hear everybody criticising the judges. It is true Union has sent forth an occasional representative in this line of whom she may well be proud. But this success was due to natural genius, plus individual effort, often assisted by outside tutoring. Will the trustees and faculty, while they are agitating reforms, not come to our rescue in this important .department and change chaos into an .intelligent system? A STUDENT. Union won in a one sided game of foot ball with the Brownies of Amsterdam on Saturday afternoon, by a score of r8 to 6. Two twenty minute halves were played, and to say that the game was exciting would be expressing it mildly. The only touchdown tnade by Arnster .. dam was scored on a fluke, when Stover secured the ball and touched it behind the line, after having made the most brilliant run of the day. Crichton rnade three touchdowns for Union., and Griswold one, Goetz kicked only one goal. During the game Spencer Warnick, fullback on the Amsterdam team, had his co liar bone dislocated. UNION 18.

BURROWs, PRINTER AND BINDER, SCHENECTADY, N.Y. THE article headed Union's Orators and printed elsewhere in this paper, touches upon a very im- portant branch of collegiate work. An instructor in elocution would be a desirable addition to the faculty. ... \Student however, must remember that the faculty has already been increased in late yea,rs far beyond what it was formerly. THE STUDENTS of this college have been requested r~peatedly to come out on the campus and practice foot ball against the 'varsity. Once more is this request repeated. The football team needs your hearty cooperation to enable them to win the games yet to be played. Saturday we Ineet Rutgers. A large delegation should accom- pany the teain to Albany, and by loud and hearty cheering, urge the players on to certain victory. THE CoLLEGE Hill Golf Club has played several excellent games this fall. Within the present organization there are several who may eventually become crack players. There is suffi.eient material among the students together· with the present club, to form an excellent team. It has been suggested that the College Hill Glu b might be sufficiently strengthened by next spring to war-· rant their meeting a golf .club from ~orne _ot~er: institution. The suggestion is tin1ely, and a little agitation may bring about the desired result. IT IS hardly necessary to say that the students of Union helped to raise the shout of victory which resounded throughout the length and breadth of this country on the morning of Nov.em- ber 4th. We should not have been worthy of the name of students had we done otherwise. We should not have maintained the honor and repu- tation of our venerable institution, which for more than a century has pointed out the path of honor to each succeeding generation, had other than the name McKinley burst frorn our throats in long and loud huzzas. Union is loyal. Union is patriotic, so is every college in this broa<J. land of ours. Wil~iam J en~ nings Bryan heard the shout of the McKinley cohorts not alone fron1 farm and factory, but from the school house, the college and the university.· The derisive hika's with which the sons of \Old Eli\ greeted the boy orator of the Platte, have found an answering shout in every institution of learning in America. The yell of the student has r.everberated throughout hill and dale. from bouse top to chimney top. · The farmer has heard it, the merchant has hea:r.d it and Bryan bas. heard it.· .And all have joined in the long loud shout. ''We want McKinley,\ and we got him. . . Edito1· of The Concordiensis :- Allow n1e to correct an error in your report of the remarks made by President Rayu1ond in con- nection with his account of the sesquicentennial exercises at Princeton. You say that Dr. Ray- mond; referring to Union, said '' the faculty must get together, work together and pull together.\ What Dr. Raymond said was in subst~nce':. That all in whose hands the interests of the col}ege lie, trustees, alumni, faculty and students, should \ get together, stay together and pull together.\ · A MEMBER OF THE FACULTY. The editor of THE CoNCORDIENSIS xegrets exceedingly that through the careless wording of an article which appeared in the last issue of this paper, it was m.ade to appear as though there was a lack of hannony a.n1ong the n1embers of the faculty. We, all of us know that such a condition of things does not exist. It would indeed, be hard to find a faculty of which the members are more in accord with each other than at present exists at Union. The editor of THE CONCORDlENSlS returns thanks to the members of the faculty who kindly call our attention to a bad blunder, ; i ~ . ' .

THE Junior class have ·decided to hold their ' annual protnenade on Novetnber zoth. The·. · CoNCORDIENSIS desires to call special attention · to the large dances which are frotn time to time given under the auspices of the various classes. These social events forn1. an ·important patf of the social life of the student while he is in college. · · They furnish a tneans by which he may come in touch with the society of the town, and it is always to the advantage of the student to have a fair number of acquaintances in the city. It is also equally as pleasant for the towns people to know the character of the student body which is in their tnidst. The running expenses of these large dances are necessarily corisicH~1::able. · If they are properly patronized however, the ex- pense falls lightly on the individual, if n6t, the committee has to shoulder both the expen,se aJ?d the labor. We therefore, urge every student-to stand by his clas\ his college and by .his 'fellow students and patronize one of the tnost enJoyable events of the college year.

The students of Union visited Albany '' en masse\ and the well known Hikah of victory as it rose from a hundred throats gladdened the hearts of the many old alurnni who had found ~ back seats on the grand stand. Frotn one of the upper tiers of the grand stand Judge D. Cady Herrick watched with interest Union's gains through Rutgers' line. Not far off was seated General Amasa J. Parkc:=-r and Ex-Mayor Manning of Albany. Prof. Robinson and Prof. HaHes of the Albany High School, Professors Buck, M'osher, Opdyke, Russell Greenman and tnany other loyal friends of Old Union were there. .. It was a few minutes after three when the Rutgers team trotted out on the field and began the preliminary practice. In a few n1inutes Union follow.ed and received great applause. It was easy to judge of the size of the two college teams during this prelirn.inary practice. The Rutgers team was heavier, but they lacked the snap and activity that was at once shown by the wearers of the garnet, and which during the whole game characterized the teatn work and individual plays of the Union men. Every Union man played a fast gatne, and all are to be congratulated on the brilliant way the team showed up~ On the opening of the game Union guarded the south goal. Haddow put the ball in play for Rutgers. Stnith dropped on the ball on the 30-yard line. Five yards were gained when Thomas was sent through the line for an equal dis.tance. Crichton and Palmer made large \' gains then Griswoid carried the hall ahead for· five yards. Crichton then discovered a hole , in the center of the Rutgers line and dodged l past the players for a gain of ten yards. · G.ris- : wold went· around Rutgers end. Paimer· then · carried the ball dangerously near the Rutgers line. Here Rutgers called tim·e. ·After a breathing spell the tean1s resutned playing and ~Griswold was pushed around the left tackle and over Rutgers' line for a touchdown. At this · point the referee was slow in announcing U nio.n's touchdown and the ball was removed before he noticed the place where the touchdown had been made. No position could then be obtained from which a goal could be kicked, and a decision of no goal was rendered. Rutgers kicked'off and sent the ball to the side lines on each attempt. This gave the kick off to Union.~ The feature of the game dur~ng the remainder of the half was Palmer's tackling. Union's captain did great work here, and twice individually 1 prevented Rutgers fron1 making 'long runs. Union advanced the ball to within· ten yards of the New Jersey player's goal, every· ma'n was playing fast and a touchdown seemed assured for Union when timeke_eper Parrott of Rutgers called titne. His time was one tninute ahead of tirnekeeper Vroom.an~s, Union '98. In order to avoid dispute the faster time was allowed. 1\'he score at the end of the half stood, Union 4, Rutgers o. . . , At the opening of the second half Ho~ie sent .. the ball to Rutgers' five yard line. Haddow caught the ball and returned it twelve yards., Mason and Ryno did some fast playing for Rutgers and with the aid of the urn pire's. de- cision for oft:.side play, Rutgers worked the ball down to the center of the field. Union then obtained the ball on a fumble by ,Rutgers. Griswold was then played around the right. end for gains of five and t~n yards. The ball was advanced to the fifteen yard line by a series of fast plays and brilliant team work. Here the \

Drury then made a ten yard gain for '· Rutg~rs .. After another gain of five yards the Rutgers tnen appeared exhausted and lost the ball on four downs. Union carried the ball bv ol :; a series of plays about the center and around the ·ends to within a few inches of Rutgers line. Crichton made a touchdown and Hoxie kicked goal. Union again carried the baH to within a few yards of Rutgers goal. Rutgers won the ball on downs and kicked to the centre of the ' field. · The ball was then passed to Hoxie who attempted to regain the lost ground by a punted ·. ball. The ball was held by Union on the 4o-yard line when time was called. SUMMARY. UNION 10. POSITIONS. RUTGERS 0. Thatcher ............ left end ..............

Conover,. 4 FoUowing the chapel exercises Friday lnorn- ing, Nov. 6, Dr. Ray1nond· gave an interesting talk on the issues of the recent catnf aign. He said that the .great question of the cam- paign was not sHver. The attack upon the Supreme Court of the United States, the rais- ing of sectional and class strife, and the ques- tions concerning crvH service were of greater moment. 'I'he Supreme Court is the great bulwark of American Hberty and it tnust not be made the tool of the dominant party. Civil service is one of the tuost important advances in modern civilization. The strife between state and nation was settled long ago and any attempt to revive it is certain to result disastl,ouslv. Sectional and class strife \' is equivalent to putting the ax at the root of our national life, for a house divided against itself can not stand. He ·closed his interesting retnarks with an ap- peal to Union College students that they might always be supporters of truth, honor and justice in the politics of our Republic. .. The members of the Junior class have elected the following officers : President, Emmott Howd, Schenectady, N. Y.; Vice-President, . Rollin A. Kilpatrick, Troy; .Secretary, Edward Stevens, Brooklyn; Treasurer, Chas. G. Mc- Mullen, Schenectady; Senior Marshal, Geo. B. Stanwix, Alba my; Junior Marshal, Gilbert W. Crissey, Troy. The Seniors enjoyed a bang_ uet tendered them by their officers, on the 28th of last month. Chas. H. Richardson, of San Francisco, Cal., presided as toastmaster, and many excellent toasts were responded to. The officers for the Freshman class follow : Hale, 2 Jacobs, 0 This makes the second victory for the college team. There will be another contest Saturday, President, Rupert W. Ford, Mt.

The Schenectady Alumni Association held an important meeting in the law office of Edwin C. Angle, Friday evening, Nov. 6. A resolution was adopted providing for the construction .of an enclosed athletic field with a grand stand and ,other modern improvements. Such a field would cost between $1500 and $2ooo, and it is believed that it would stimulate athletics, increase local interest in them and thus do away with the annual financial deficit. It is proposed to use the field back of Prof. T. W. Wright's residence between Union Avenue and the College Grove. Horatio G. Gl;en and Frank ,Cooper were appointed tne,mbers of a central committee of five with power to appoint the remaining mem- bers. Hon. Everett Smith was made treasurer of the committee. Sub-committees will be appointed from each class frotn 1875 to 1895, and each class will be asked to contribute at least $5o toward the fund. persoQals.

BURROWs, PRINTER AND BINDER, SCHENECTADY, N.Y. IT IS not necessary for us to enter into a detailed criticism of the Union-Rutgers foot ball game. The victory belongs to the Union players by right of their superior merit. The result shows what ·may be accomplished by hard and persistent effort. The 'victory unde1· the depressing in- ftu.ences ·which accompanied the formation of a team this se·ason, is sufficien-t cause for jollification. Now that Union's luck has turned, let the good work go on.· SOME time ago it was 1·umored that there was a ~ project on foot to construct a. new athletic field. Nothing definite was done in this matter, how- ever, until a few .days a,go. A meeting of tbe loc;tl alumni was called and the project was laid before them. An account of this meeting appears elsewhere in this paper. The promoter or pro- m.oters of this project could not have hit upon a more. feasible plan for .stintulating the athletic spirit which exists in college today. There ar~ many reasons why Union should have a well con- structed and properly equipped athletic field. We understand that one of the principle reasons ad- vanced for furthering the projec-t was the assuunp- tion that a fair amount of revenue could be ob- tained if there were suitable accommodations for the :students and the general public. who without doubt would patronize the garnes and other atbletic sports. Aside from this consideration, w hieh is indeed an important one, is the fact, that any 1novement on. the part of the alumni in this direction would result in an iminedia.te response on the part of the students. A greater and more earnest manifestation of college spirit, which is the necessary accompaniment of successful athletic contests, would be the inevitable result . Editor of The C&ncordiensis:- . : Letter writing is evidently all the vogue and criticisin is the order of the day. But I wish, with your permission to use valuable space, to criticise a critic, the ''student\ who wrote last week of ''Union's Orators.\ Surely enough, we lack con- centration in the oratorical sphere, but what has that to do with the fact that many believe our ''prize de bating has degenerated into a lottery'? \ I wager the majority of the ''many\ are those who have not had sufficient manliness to stand defeat. And -what is this \experience\ that ''proves that when the fraternities flourish the literary societies die, and the converse must follow as a necessary corollary?\ Surely, Mr. Editor, not the e;xperien~e taught by history, nor ye:t. pardon me, by co1nn1on sense. And I may observe further, that while it n1ay not be consistent with ''the dignity of Old Union to allow prep-school undergraduates to criticise our commencement orators,\ prep-school undergraduates _f;lhall con- tinue forever, as in the past, to criticise the alumni of prep-schools, just as college undergraduates shall continue forever, I suppose, to criticise -the alun1ni of our colleges-however unworthily in either case. In closing. I -would say, that my intention bas been, not to slight the ideas advanced by the \student but rather to criticise criticism. In short. when a man has been dreadfully sick for a nun1ber of years and is rapidly convalescing, don't continue to pour rank physic clown his throat. Take hin1 out for a ride now and then; pat him gently on the back; smile upon him and speak pleasant words. A STUDENT Too. ''The sick 1nan\ Inentioned in the above letter, we are glad to be infonned, ·'is rapidly con- valescing.\ Bis treatment has been n1ost elabo- rate; co1nprising, as. it has, almost everything froin amputation to massage. And now a new physician appears with recommendations for the patient's health that cannot but meet with the approval of every well-disposed student in college. Much indeed needs yet to be accomplished in this renaissance through which the co1lege is passing, but every suggestion need not be adorned by a rosette of growls.

Only three of · last year's varsity players returned, no coach or captain had been chosen, new faculty rules governed the selection of players, and the schedule of gatnes was incornplete. Under these discouragements the college spirit of the student body failed to rneet the etnergency. 1~he chief requisite for a gqod team is plenty of practice. The student body of the college should furnish this. It is absolutely in1possible for a team of new players to make a good show- ing against other tea1ns of high standing without the necessary training on the horne campus. Every player tnust learn to be active, cool, plucky, and thoroughly acquainted witl1 the proper play at the deciding tnoment. This year the varsity \vas forced to obtain 1ts chief training in gatnes with other teams. The student body failed to n1eet the den1and for a large scrub and the first experience gained was accon1panied by defeat. As the work of the teatn becatne tnore organized, through Captain Palmer's efforts and the coaching of ''Father\ Brown, our prospects brightened. Our closing success n1ay cause us to look for- ward to a new season when the harvest of this year's experience may be reaped by future wearers of the garnet. The laurels of the first gatne were won by the Laureates of 1\'roy. Individual work was a feature of Union's playing. Team work was lacking. Score-Laureate 14, Union o. Hobart, next, played Union on the catnpus. Hobart won this game through Case, captain, who made precisely the correct play at a critical n1o1nent for his teatn. No Union player was on hand to hinder hin1. If Union had kicked a goal the score would have been tied. Score-Hobart 6, Union 4· In another week Union had developed better team work. Although the Laureates were still stronger, Union held the score down in her second garne with this tearn. Score-· Laureate 6, Union o. In the annual gatne with West Point, the team of the rnilitary academy doubled the score of last year. Score-· West Point 44• Union o. The last Saturday in October was tnarked by a victory for Union over the Atnsterdam teatn. The game belonged to Union from the time of the first kick off' to the call of tirne in the second half. Score-Union 18, Atnsterdarn 6. The final gatne of the season was played against Rutgers. By this tin1e Union's team had developed good team work which was used with telling eftect against the Rutgers line. Frotn the sunny oval of Ridgefield, Union bore away the laurels of a gatne rnarked by a scarcity of errors and by cool and quick playing. Score-Union ro, Rutgers o. At this tirne it seems quite proper to say a few words concerning the rnen who have worked so faithfully for Union during the past season. Too n1uch credit cannot be given to Capt. Palrner. Probably no one except the tean1, really knows how hard he bas worked for Union during this season. Three .Years' playing on the teatn has n1ade hitn an expert and his work at left tackle in the Rutgers gan1e was the fe~tture of the day. But his labor was not confined to playing well. With very adverse circun1stances, a discouraged tea1n and sotnetirnes hardly any scrub and little student support, the last part of the season he was so ill that he could harcl1y walk. His untiring activity and ceaseless per- severance were alone enough to 1nake a success- ful season. Beardsley and Crissie did excellent work at right tackle, and with this year's experience will

2 THE OO,NOORDIENSIS. n1ake strong players next season. If any tackling was to be done they were sure to be there. Ptice and Thatcher, both new men, were efficient ends and it was not their fault if any one got by them. Thomas, who had been a substitute for two years, made the team this time, and his great size made him a forrnidable opponent at left guard. Blodgett at right guard never had much to say, but he was always in the right place when the ball was in play. A player of great abi,lity and unbounded pluck ; he will be a 'Sore loss to the team. '•Trout\ Bookhout was the heaviest man: on the team and nobody got through the centre if he could prevent it, which he ahnost invariably did. Stnith, who was a substitute last year, de- serves especial mention for his work as quarter- back. Crichton, who played both right and left half back, made more touchdownR than ·any other man on the teatn. He was unfortunate in being hurt in almost every game but he was a star player for all that. Grotz, who played three years on the U. C. I. team, Griswold, ex-captain of the A.M. C. team, and Jones, who was a substitute last year, were hard earnest players and did all they could to make the team a success. Hoxie, at full back, was one of the best men on the team and was only too glad to kick a goal if someone would make a touchdown. Cooper~ the captain of the scrub, Mallery, Williatns, Pearse, Wilson and Cotton deserve much credit for their work as substitutes. Nov. zo.-Junior Promenade .. Nov. zr.-Daniel Sully.

The fifth c1ass foot ball ga:tne was played on the can1pus Monday afternoon. The game was exciting throughout. An unusually large num- ber of students witnessed the contest and all de- clared it to be the best garne of the season. The victory for the Seniors was due to the weight of their line and superior teatn work. At the end of the second half the Sophomores had a good opportunity to score. They were within three yards of the Seniors goal and in- stead of \bucking\ the line the ball was passed back for a drop kick from the field. The ball passed outside the goal posts and, before another line up, titne was called. O'Neill, Williams and Cooper did good work for the Seniors, while Fisk and WiLson made gocd gains and tackles for the Sophomores. The tearns lined up as follows: SENIORS 8. POSITIONS. SOPHOMORES 0.

THE annual promenade which is given under the auspices of the Junior clas:q takes place Friday evening of this week. rrHE CoNCORDIENSIS urges every student to attend. Your support is wanted both by your presence and your money. If you don't care to dance you n1ay contribute by buying one of the spectator's tickets. You. ce-rtainly would be well repaid as there are few 1nore delightful scenes than that of a large college dance. CLASS spirit is a good thing when it is weU directed, as it then leads to a greater d~velopinent of college spirit. College spirit is essential to the success of all the undertakings of the under- graduates. If there is no college spirit the foot ball, track, and base ball teams will gain few victories. Theywill be but the sickly representa- tives of an inanimate listless aggregation. There- fore, if you love your college, turn out with your class and enter the contests for supremacy. If you cannot enter the gaines yourself urge another to do so, and fan not to lend your voice in loud and lusty cheers. Just as you cheer for your class so will you cheer for your college. Who are the main stay of Union's alumni today? They are the 1nen whose cheer for their class was only out- done by their cheer for ahna mater. THERE seems to be an impression among so1ne of the studeuts that the foot ball teain disbanded on account of so1ne disagreen1ent between the manag.em,ent and the players. Such a re- port found its way into the papers and has furnished material for gossip, among those who were either too l,azy to verify the report or pre- ferred to aid in its circulation. The facts of the case are, that the team disbanded because of the inability .of some of the players to continue the violent :exercise which the game requires, and the lack of efficient. substitutes to take their places. There was but one more regular game to play and that was with the Rensselaer Polytechnic team which was to have occurred on Nov. 21. A game had been arranged with the Laureate tearn a few days before it was decided to dis band. As two games had been played with this team, it was not in1portant, under the circumstances, that the third engagement should be fulfilled. The best of spirit exists between the players, the rnanagemen t and the coach ;and final action was not taken until the necessities of the case demanded it. IT APPEARS as though Union's prospects for a new athletic field are fairly bright. A large num- ber of the alurnni have become interested and as a consequence the question has taken a definite form. We can say with a fair degree of certainty that we are going to have a new field. The question of its future location is an ilnportant one. It involves in a large degree the success or failure of the undertaking. Not alone should it be con- sidered from a financial standpoint either re- garding construction or the acquirement .of future revenues. It is of prin1ary hnportance that such a field should be in harmony with the general plan of the college .grounds. The original design of Union College calls for a strict adherence to the idea of semetry which at present predominates. We understand that a cornpetent authority on landscape architecture, who was called here by the college authorities. placed a prospective athlet~c field at the rear of the college tract in the large field on the north side of Prof. T. 'V. Wright's house. Such a disposition of our future athletic field was probably n1ade in conformity to some general design and without doubt would have its advantages. As regards this matter THE OoN- CORDIENSIS, without any desire to criticise, suggests the consideration of the pasture which lies directly in front of the present can1pus as a ~He for such a :field. Would not the pasture fulfill n1any if not all of the requiren1ents for an up-to-date athletic :field? Would it not be as well to transfer the cows from the lower pasture to the rear lot as the reverse plan which is at present entertained?

THE CONCORbtENStS. Jr.r MAY not be cornpatible with our position in the journalistic world to remark upon the tendency which son1e of our conten1poraries in the newspaper fraternity have for assailing Union College upon every opportunity which presents itself. We re.fer particularly to one of the daily papers of Albany. We have also noticed the san1e inclination in times past on the part of one of the Amsterdam news- papers. Even the Schenectady papers are often lax in their support. As the exponent of the undergraduates of Union College THE OoNCORDIENSIS has,. in the past, pre- served a clignifled sHence,. recognizing its inability to reach through its columns that class of people for which these articles were intended. It is sufficient to say that in aln1ost every instance during the past four years, such articles, as have appeared in the pape1·s in question have been either an untrue or a gt·eatly exagerated state- ment of the facts, and when an atterupt at ci·iti- cism has been made, it has always taken the fonn of sarcastic conunent which influences nobody but rather belittles the newspaper in the eyes of all right thinking people. We are inclined to believe that the source of these articles lies rnainly with the repoi·torial de- partrnent uf these papers and not with the rnanage- ment Union Ool10ge is an educational institution which opens its doors to all classes and ldnds of ruen. It has a large scholarship endowment, and has in times past and is at present furnishing a collegiate education to a large number of students from Albany, Amsterdarn and the surrounding towns free from the regular tuition. A generous effort on the part of these news- papers to further the interests of the institution rather than to snap at the hand that feeds and caresses V\rould be far more dignified in news- papers which are supposedly seeking the good of the community at large.
