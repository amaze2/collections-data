--------------- -----------· No.5· VoL. XII. UNION COLLEGE, FEBRUARY, r889. --~·------~--------------- ---------------------------· - LITERARY. Me.morabilia of Tayler Lewis. In the long list of intellectuai1 and scholarly tnen who have been instructcrs in Union College, occurs the nan1e of Tavler Lewis. To the w student of to-day, and even to a nun1ber of the present Faculty, he is n1erely a tradition, although but twelve years have passed away since his death. Dr. Lewis was a student frotn the pure love of study. l-Ie was a digger into books, and a scribbler on books and about books, frotn the titne he learned his letters at his n1otber's knee, to the close of his long, and studious and busy life. The 'tenn scholiast, in its fullest sense, applied to hin1. The fruit of all these years of unceasing study, was given to the world by his own pen, before he died, but n1any getns of thought lie hidden in tnanuscript volun1es, that have never been seen except by students of classic and oriental lore, or by friends who have occasionally visited . ~ the library where he worked, and where the books he loved, and tnarked with n1any a note, lie lonesorne upon the shelves-the n1aster-spirit gone. The brief fragtnent which vve give to the pages of THE CoNCORDIENSIS, is taken frotn one of these voltunes of Biblical annotations. It is nun1bered two hundred and forty seven, and is one of the briefest. Son1e of these notes coin- prise a large nutnber of pages, and there are nearly five hundred. 'I'hey have no special regularity ; the passages selected for 1neditation are taken frotn nearly every book of the Old and New Testatnent; 1nany are chosen frotn Books of the Bible but seldon1 read or preached fi·orn. They are interspersed vvith quotations fron1 the ..._.L\.rahic, Syriac and I Iebre\v in great profusion, and, on this account, it has seetned a difficult task to even atten1pt a publication of therm. Dr. Le·wis, doubtless, never contc In- plated their publication. They vvere the pasti1n e .of hours, when, in total deafness, he turned fron1 the soJitude of a present life, to cotnn1une vviith the sch.olars of a buried past. His love for the Classics was intense. He would not listen to a lo-vveTing of this departlnent in our Colleges, a:nd wrote n1uch that was published during his life~ in defence of his vieVtrs-and his earnest, religious soul found great delight in seeking out the true tneaning of every blind passage of the word or God., by diving to its roots in the beautiful itnagery of the Oriental tongues. The closing lines of the n1editation which '\ve offer, are a translation by Dr. Lewis fron1 the Syriac. In the original n1anuscript~ he h~ts written thetn first in the Syriac type, and after- \.Yard translated thetn. It is a pleasure to us, to bring, in this \Nay befo1·e the students of to-da.-y, a picture, however in1pedect, of a Christian scholar who lived <tnd died atnong the classic shades of dear Olcl Union, and who loved the college with an honest and devoted love. M. L. P. Outer Darkness. The nature and origin of this strange and fear- ful expression, which occurs in Matthew VIII I z, have been sought in Rabbinical and Classical allusions. But the n1eaning and reason ofthe phrase seen1 to cotne directly out of the vivid itnagery of the contzxt in1n1ediately above: '~ And n1any shall con1e fron1 the East and frotn the West, and shall sit down in the banq~tet vvitl1 Ahraha 111, and Isaac and Jacob in the ki ngdotn of heaven, and the sons of the kingdon1 sha 11 be cast into outer dar'lcness.\ It is the intense darkness, as contrasted ·with the intense light of the \vedding feast, vvhich

The Eastern churches were fond of this figure of the briHiantly lighted banquet hall, or rnarriage feast, and it is often found in the hynn1s of the Officiurn Feriale Ecclessiae Syrorun1. 1'here is a very beautiful ex£unple of it; (probctbly fron1 St. Ephrain1), page 8, line 12, (sn1nll edition Rotne r 855.) It is the cotnnlencetnent of one of their alphabetical cantitenas. Brethren, arise, your lamps prepare, For lo! the bridegroom draweth nigh. He hath n1.ade for his saints a dwelling fair, In the mystical Eden, built on high. The Cltamber of L/ght stands open wide, And harps of glory are sounding the.re; Enraptured to m·eet him, they stand by his side, \Vho have waited long, till their Lord appeat·. TAYLER LEWIS. ===========-=-=-=-=--==-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-==--=--=--=--=--=---=---=---=-~-=-· .::::--- Advantages of Smaller Colleges. 1\!Iuch is being said of the superior advantages of large colleges. We find the illustrious head of one of our greatest eastern institutions tnivel- ing in the west, and exhorting the people to send their sons to the large unive1 sities of the east, dilating on the superiority of these in the educa- tion of young 111 en. The An1erican systen1 of nun1erous stnall colleges, which has grown out of the nature of things, son1e are inclined to raH at, and the n1an1n1oth universities of Europe are pointed out ns n1odels toward which we ought to strive. It raises the suspicion in one's tnind that that these are people who are attracted by whatever is foreign, and have not a sufficient appreciation for what is the natural, healthy and progressive outgrowth of their ovvn progressive country. Setting aside the causes which has produced the Atnerican systern-causes of which V\ 7 e l11HY \Yell feel proud-let us exa1nine the advantages of s1nall colleges as con1pared with large ones. Which js the better to attend, a college that has unward of a thousand students or one of a few J.. hundred? First as to the tnoral advantages. No one can question that a young n1an is exposed to less dangers in one of the sn1aller institutions. In Arnerica the sn1nll colleges are generally situated in retired places which do not holcl out so tnany alluring :_:tttractions to go wrong as places of larger growth. Students of extrerne wealth are not ntnnerous and therefore all the evil influences which they exert are absent. These n1en in- variably give a powerful exarnple and stin~ul us to dissipation ~nd excess, tnaking riotous living even fashionable. Moreover they have no in- tention of getting a solid education, tnerely wish- ing to have a good tin1e and live high, thus working a two-fold injury by en1 bittering the life of a sensitive rnan of rnoderate n1eans, who cannot afford to have everything he wishes, and .J by contatninating, so to speak, the atrnosphere of a seat of learning, which ought only to tend to inspire a love of knowledge. Many of the young 1nen have allowances of fron1 three to ten thousand a year. It seen1s incredible that there are such foolish parents in the world. Any student, even if he were a saint on entering college, with so 1nuch n1oney would leave a veritable vvreck. After all 1nost young 1nen are alike. It depen_ds tnuch on opportunities and environrnent whether thev are to be '' fast or ., slow.\ The fast n1en of a college are princi- pally those that have plenty ot n1oney; the straight n1en those that have barely enough to pay expenses. N ovv at s1nall colleges the dan- gers are less ; and even if a student has 1noney his en viron1nent is such that he is not led into the extr:1vagance he would indulge in at larger institutions. He is not thrown in with so tnan y reckless youths whose pernicious exan1ple he is sure to etnulate. College 1nen aTe full of the fire of youth ; easily lead, liable especially to do as the ''rest of the boys\ do. Weighing all the facts it is an obvious truth that a sturdy, sober n1anhood is surer to be developed at a srnall college. Here one 1nay follow a caln1er and quieter pursuit of kno\Yledge without either the hubbub of too 1nuch social indulgence, or, what is lately becotning as serious a 1natter, over excite1nent in athletic sports. There is no doubt that at large colleges legiti- n1ate recreations are s01netiines pursued to a point injurious to studies. All students should be encouraged to take part in athletic sports. It is absolutely essential for a prope1· education. The golden n1ean in 1nental and physical developn1ent n1ust be followed, other-

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 73 ----~----~~---------------~~--~------------~------~--~----~------~---------- ---- ---- ---------------- -------- --- ------ wise a rnan's life will be a failure. But herein l ing that intitnate contact between the students an<l experienced professors so characteristic of stnaU colleges. In large institutions a student rnay be fortunate enough to fonn a friendship with a congenial profes~or. For we learn ho-vv the tnind of Robert Elsrnere was influenced by the Oxford professors ; and indeed, we n1ight add, that our great Atnerican colleges are not entireiy free fro1n such influences, Agnosticisn1 and Atheistn seetns to increase in thern directlv - ---- lies the trouble. A student of an athletic turn of tn1nd, on entering such colleges as Harvard, 1 ... ale or Princeton, is both surprised and fas- cinated by the intense interest he finds existing in athletics, and the great honors attached to superioTity in any of its branches. He sees that some ofhis fellow students have achieved even a national reputation and are the idols of the colleg~. Having great faith in his physical prowess he i'S caught in the whirlpool. I-Iis eagerness for study is blinded by the glarnour of athletic greatness, for indeed he finds class honors considered insignificant con1pared with those of the field. Now in such cases it is clearly itnpossible to get a good education. All energy and titne are devoted to the atnbition to suceeed in atbietics. The action recently taken hy the Board of Overseers at Harvard shows that the college authorities are -vvaking up to these truths. At sruail colleges the case is entirely different. Excitetnent in athletics never becon1e abnorn1al, but the golden tnean, we think, is 1nore nearly and rnore uniforn1ly preserved. The professors, n1orever, in stnall colleges can have a greater n1oral force. There being a close personal acquaintance between the pro- fessoTs and students, a chance is afforded for whatever is good, noble or energetic 1n the character of any professor being cotnn1unicated to the student or assiduously en1ulated by hitn. A strong and good character in a professor is, in son1e respects, wasted in a large college. The students do not '' rub against \ hitn enough. But where such a personality can exert itself by direct and constant intercourse the effect is won- derful and far-reaching. A young tnan in college is not too old for what are called youth- ful iin pTessions, and the influence of a teacher n1ay ta1\.e a great part in n1oulding his life. M·an.y an alun1nus can trace a strong trait in his character to contact with a professor in his long passed college days. We wonder at the wann loyalty sotnetirnes displayed by old graduates to theil· fonner tutors and guides, but we tnay find in this' the explanation. Now we do not affirn1 that the influence of a professor's character in a large college is entirely elitninated; but we do insist thflt there is want- ~ as their grovvth. However, special friend:ships he tnass of students cannot enjoy. They tnust be content with a fonnal lecture in the class- roorn and perhaps not even a nod ·Of recognition in tl11e streets. For where a professor has several hundred in a class he cannot be expected to becotne personally acquainted with all of then1. And the abler and rnore powerful a teacher is, the larger his classes, and hence the tnore re- tnoved he will be fron1 the students. But the tnost serious point, if true, is the cotnplaint that a rnan does not get into the recitation rootn of a real professor until about the third year. The instruction of Freshrnen and Sophotnores is done ahnost wholly by tutors. Novv in stnaller colleges this is not the case. A student finds hirnself in the hands of experienced tnen \'Tho con11nand his highest respect. He is not \ lost in the crowd,\ but finds hitnself under the strict surveillance and d1.ily attention of the professors. l-Ie will be required to get up on his feet every day and recite before the class. He will have his views criticised and hear those of his cla::,s- tnates. It is needless to dwell upon the benefits occurring fron1 this strict and constant attention. It is just the sort of drill that young tnen need. To learn to think upon their feet, to give a care- ful daily preparation to their studies, and due attention in the recitation rootn. Such care is only possible where the students are not nutnerous. After all the selection of a college is a n1.atter of very serious itnport. Reputation is in favor of the large ones, but wise people are beginning to see tnore clearly the advantages of the others, to such an extent that sotne of our stnall colleges that have set a litnit are becotning en1barrassed with nun1bers. It does not seetn at all likelv ., that vve shaH soon have uniYcrsities in the United

After reading TaE CoNCORDIENsrs, I reflected, that a retniniscence of tny coHege days, tnight be of interest to its readers. It was n1y fortune to be a student at Union, itT the latter part of the '' roaring forties..\ The g·old deposits in ·Cali- fornia had then just been discovered, and the 1nen \Vho now rejoice in the sobrz~qu.et of Forty- 1Zi7ters, were then just pbnning ho\v to get to the golden sands of the Sacratnento. Those were ~tirring tin1es, and Old Union was a power in the land. Herfaculty was distingui~hed \there were giants in the land h1 those· days.\ Dr. Nott, her venerable president, was then in the vigor of a ripe old age, not yet itnpaired. Titne had not withered his intellect; nor had the tongue that deplored the death of Han1ilton, lost any of its eloquence. His discourses in the Presbyterian, and in· the old Dutch church in Schenectady, were always grand, always delight- ful. Kain1s Ele1nents was taught by hitn to the Seniors. It was his delight, and to listen to his cotntnents on the text, \Vas to sit at the feet of Plato. His influence over the students \vas wonderful. The chair of Mathetnatics was filled by Isaac W. Jackson, one of nature's noblen1en. He \Vas a lover of his art, and a plain, kind, unassun1ing n1an. At this titne he was a sufferer fn>n1 dyspepsia, and used to work a great deal in his no\v farnous garden. I can still see, in n1y 1nind's eye, Capt. Jack, as the boys called hin1 (front his 111ilitary antecedents) vvith his scuffie hoe, or pruning shears, at work along the borders of the walks, or pruning his shrub- bery, as he appeared when I was taking a walk through his gan]en. He was as r~ady to show off the curious or interesting properties of his plants, as to ex:plain in the class roon1 how the asyn1ptotes of the hyperbo'la constantly approach the curve, but never n1eet it ; or the develop- Inent of the Binon1ial Theore1n. l-Ie used to . take n1e into h,is study, ~nd prescribe son1e ren1edy for n1y tninor aihnents, ·which was usually .. -- ~--~----~- efficient. I loved hin1 as a father. Hi~ son· '·' Eill,\ as we used to call hitn, was a lnechani- cal genius. He had, with his own hands chiefly, built a tniniature steatn engine which he set up irr the garden, on the high bank near the brook · flowing through the garden. Williarn Jackson and I were pupils together at the old Lycetun, a college. gran11nar school, kept in a queer Octagonal brick building, on Union street, Schenectady. I suppose it is gone long since. In 1849 or r85o, Prof. Tayler Lewis, hecan1e a n1ernber of the faculty of Union- College. He was a profound scholar and ~ finn believer in classical training, and thought the drill of the Latin fonns and syntax was one of the best tnethoc.ls of cultivating the intellect. lie thought that the etytnology of a language and its history -vvas a key to the history of the people using the language, and were useful studies, that philology was as i1nportant a science as any, for a liberal education. He instructed in Greek arid Hebrew languages, in \Vhich he felt great interest, and was able to innoculate his classes with his own enthusiastn in these studies. He organized a Gr1eek Testatnent class, which n1et on Sunday evenings to study and expound the Greek text of the Gospels; these tneetings, were very instruc- tive and interesting to those not religiously inclined, as well as to those who were so .. Prof. Robert Proudfit was closing his long career as Professor of Greek, in I 849· He was a venerable and good old tnan, and beloved of his pupils even if they did call hin1 '' Old Prosso.\ He has long since crossed the river. Prof. Williatn M. Gillespie was then the n1an at (Jnion who initiated the students into the n1ysteries of the difterential calculus and Bou- charlats Analytic l\1echanics, but he n1ore par- ticularly instruct~d in Mechanical drawing, surveying land, the art of building roads and bridges, canals and railroads, and topography and geodesic surveying etc., fron1 which latter 1nentioned arts, he was dubbed \ Old Geodesy.'' He was a sn1all sized tnan, awkward and un- graceful in his bearing, and had a lisp or itn- pecHnJent in his speech, and besides he -vvas not popular with the students of that titne, yet despite all these defects he was·a fine teacher, a thorough instructor, and one whose services the students

He was one of the youngest of the faculty. All these professors were pains- taking and faithful instructors, w·ho conscien- tious! y did their duty. I roo1ned at No. 13 South College, Dr. Nott's section, front roo111, fourth floor. At the close of the day when its labors \Vere finished, the chapel bells rang for evening prayer, the students issued frotn their various se.ctions, and gathered in the chapel. After pra)rers they dis- persed to their roorns or went down into the city, as they pleased, and a profound quiet reigned throughout the halls of the great buildings and grounds. Fron1 the \vindow of tny roon1 at the close of the autut11nal days, after evening prayers, I have enjoyed sunset views, that hnunt n1e still. 1'o the west where the l\!Iohawk breaks through the Glenville hills, is a beautiful gorge, in ·vvhich the auturnn sun sets, gilding the blue hi lis and clouds with cri111~on and gold. Often have I sat on n1y windovv-sill and enjoyed the 111agnificence of the scene, until unconscionsly I fell into a reverie which lasted till darkness set in ancl let do\vn the curtain. Often the President at this hour would drive ' up under 111y winclovv in his three-vvrheelecl go- cart, on his return frotn .the city, get out and go into his office, which vvas directly under n1y rootn, on the first floor. Besides the blue hills and the Mohavvk, there \vas the canal with its tcetning boats creeping along slo·wly, and there also the railroads, vvith the rapidly rnoving trains, and the city, and the Loc01noti ve \vorks, and the fi,elcls and pastures and the college ter- race all in easv vievv. No doubt the occu- pant of roon1 No. I 3 South College, 111ay still see the Glenville hills blue in the distance, and the gorge \vhere the 1\tfohavvk breaks through, and the purple and golden sunset of autun1n, and the terrace, and the city, and pasture and rail- road, fro1n his winclo\v, as I saw then1 years ago, but not so the venerable President and his three-\vheeled huggy, they are gone into the unreturning past. The canal, the pasture and the cmnpus are still there, hnt the occupants of those two old grey structures are gone-all gone. The Senior class of r85o nun1bered ro4, that of 1849 nutnhered 140, n1ost ofVtrhotn graduated. Those were glorious days for Old Union. The Philon1athean and Adelphic societies '\vere then strong and influential bodies. I was a Philo- n1athean and vvas proud of it. One hundred n1etnhers or upwards thronged her halls in those days. One ht111c~red n1en, the flower of Union as she then was, vvas a literary and intellectual _body, whose sessions vvere not vain, it was a force in the cause of culture. 'fhe debates, the essays, to say nothing of the poen1s, \vere often really excellent. The eloquence of Me Coy, lVloore, Pettibone, Buckland, Hand, Powers, Thotnpson, Jackson, and others rang through her halls with soul stirring effect. I learn with regret that the Philo1nathean, older than Union even, is going into a decline. Without the Philo1nathean and Adelphic, what can Union be? There was then no baseoall or foot-ball ; the dutn b-bells, horizontal bar or trapeze, with \valk- ing, supplied the physical exercise. The mnuse- nlents and recreations vvere intellectual, rather than physical. Engineering fLirnishecl exercise, through its field operations.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. - - ~ - -~- --- - - -- - - - - - ---- --- -- Sotne classes turn out a great nu1nber of distinguished n1en, others but few. The class of r85o will probably have to depend on the fact, that they graduated exactly in the n~iddle of the nineteenth century for distinction. As it now appears that is the only thing that fortune has favored thetn with,. for distinction. But few have achieved notoriety, yet the class of r85o was a good one, probably fully up to the average. Rabbi J. Buckland V\rbo graduated at the head of the class, died young, and full of · protnise, others died early in foreign lands. My recollections of n1y classtnates are exceedingly pleasant. For a long tin1e at recitation, sat at n1y side Delavan De Long. He was very n1odest, quiet and unasstuning, and always ac- quitted hitnself \vith credit. There seetned to be a natural attraction between us, and yet I have never seen or heard frotn hir11 since we separated on cotnnJencetnent day r85o. On tny other side, often sat Alexander Ennis, a good student, a little wild sotnetitnes, and he relished fun tnore than he did a tough passage in the Oedipus Tyrannis, yet he ranked well and was well read. Both Ennis and Daniel J .. Darrow were wann friends of n1ine, and we often studied together; but I have heard notbi ng fro1n then1 all these years. Soon after graduation I catne to the South and have had tny hotne on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, that will account for knowing so little of tny classtnates in after years. Henry Gardiner, another elasstnate, becatne a civil engineer in after years, and built railroads in Iowa and Dakota ; finally he went to California, and died at Merced in 1885 or r886, as I was inforn1ed. John D. Stuart of Schenectady, another friend and classtnate, <died soon after graduation, in 1853 at Canton, Miss. I nursed hitn in his last illness, closed his dying eyes, and assisted at his burial. He sleeps in the quiet. cetnetery at Canton, along with sotne of Mississippi's tnost illustrious sons. To tnention all 1ny class1nates would far exceed the li1nits of this. sketch. A day or two preceding the Cotntnencen~ent of I 85o, a ntunber of our class received notices, _ that on the next day at a stated hour, the New York Alpha of the Phi Beta I<:appa society ---------- would tneet in the Senior chapel, in South Colonade, and invited thetn to be present on the occasion. A,t the appointed hour they went, a?d were invited into a roon1 adjoining th~ chapel, where were Prof. Gillespie, a few other professors of Union, and sorne strangers to whotn they vvere introduced, after which Prof. Gillespie as tnaster of ceretnonies, expounded the virtues of philosophy and various other tnystical things, known only to the wise, and only fully under- stood by the initiates of the if? B K after which he invested then1 with a tnystical key, and told then1 they were full Hedged ''Phi Betas.\ Then their heads touched the stars. On the next day was Con11nencetnent at Union, and the class of 1850 separated never to tneet again. WAKEMAN W. EDWARDS. Greyfriars.

And look that thou make them after their pattern which was shewed thee in the 1\Iount.-E~'<Jodus xxv: 40· The fatniliar history or ancient Israel is always interesting, always instructi ve,-interesting as a story of life-instructive as a perpetual sytnbol of spiritual truth. The central person is God. The central sytnbol is his dwelling place-the tabernacle. Around that structure sin1ple, beautiful, in1pressive, gathers the interest of the '' chosen people \ in every age. It stands always in the tnidst of the catnp, the visible token of a present ] ehovah. All of its history is significant and no part tnore so than the story of its construction, a single feature of which we study this Inorning. . Our text brings before us the awful grandeur of the cloud enveloped thount, where the I-Iebrew leader tnet the Hebrew's God. It leads us to the Inount~ not upon it, for into the secret of that tnajestic presence vve tnay not penetrate.

THE CON!CORDIENSIS. 77 ========--=---=---=-=- --=--=--- -=--=--=----:- __ ..----o.:~---:-::--:---;----- - ----------- thick darkness of the sulTOUti.ding cloud. We can only say that there '' God rnade known his ways unto Moses ;\ there Mosessotnehow learned directly sotnething of the 1nind and will of the ''Holy One of Israel,'' and a partofthe revelation was the pattern of the tabernacle which through all succeeding ages should be ca1led or should typify God's house. Thus the tabernacle prac- tically began as a plan in the tnind of God's servant. He saw the structure cotnplete before the first board was fitted to its so~ket. In brieflv . ~ developing this thought we shall for the 1nost part follow the lines which others have laid down. We are aU builders and every wise builder plans before he oor1structs. A.H best work is after a pattern. '' 'The pictur~ flashes its beauty into the artist's own tnind before it lives upon the canvass. The poet's soul is first filled with the song he afterwards sings to others.\ This is a general law. Natund growth is but the outworking of a hidden pattern. The very fonn of a tree is 1nysteriously foreshadowed in the seed. Nature builds everv shrub and flower o.J after a n1odel. External causes tna v prevent ., ... perfection in the visible result, but the invisible pattern is perfect. And so the ideal is alvvays the true point of departure. When we look at hun1an life we find the great vvant to be of pattern. Men fail for the n1ost part through indefiniteness. They work but do not build, or they build but only disjointedly. As a 1-ule the heart n1ust inspire the hands, but the head n1ust direct thetn. Earnestness 1nay be defeated by aitnlessness. The trouble with n1any is not that they fail to reach their ideals but that they fail to have ide~ls worth reaching. The world of htnnanity is full of wasted energy. Take almost any n1an whose life is calle.d a failure, and it is true that the san1e atnount of thought and energy, directed along son1e one line, according to sotne w~ll defined p:nrpose, would have brought success. Achievetnent is often not a question of willing- ness, nor of ability, nor of work, but of plan. There is a vast diffetence between the prospects of a young tnan who has chosen his life work, who begins by knowing what he is to do, and the prospects of another who begins by doing · contentedly anything that turns up. The one cotntnands his energies to a definite end. The other finds his energies cornn:'lancled to ever changeable ends. The one lays his course and sails for one port, tacking against heachvinds. The other sails for anywhere, shifting his course with every shifting breeze. T 1 h:e one builds. The other sitnply piles up stones. This age is replete with counsel for young 1nen. 'They have 1nore sermons and books directed towards then1 than any other class in . the connnunity. Alrnost all the advice in the line of specific duties 1night be left unsaid, if only this principle were actually cotn- tnunicated. Begin life with a worthy purpose. Fix your plan before you build. Settle definitely what you are to live for and then live for it with all your God-given energies. Back of all best efforts lies a cotnprehensive purpose. Before the visible tabernacle is the invisible pattern. Accotnpanyingthis principle,-purpose before action, plan before structure,-and fanning n fact its 1nost essential feature, is this further truth expressed in God's 1nessage to Moses. The purpose and plan tnust be of God. \Look that thou 1nake then1 after their pattern which was shewed thee in the- Mount.\ 1\tfoses took God's idea and vvrought it out. So does every n1an who builds best, who builds well. This truth 'helps us to the solution of the probletn of hun1an life. It ilnplies n1an's ever conscious relationship to G,od, the dependence of the creature upon his Creator. When we speak of our divine nature we appeal directly to soul consciousness. Not fron1 the external Word alone do we gain our knowledge of spiritual sonship. Frotn within cotnes the assertion of a spit:itual nature and a spiritual inheritance. Through all the long centuries~ over all the broad earth n1en have known and felt the dignity and worth of their essential being. And ever present with this assurance has been the longing for a worthy life. \What nn1st \Ne do that we tnay work the works of God\ is an universal cry. \ Lord what will thou have tne to do? \ is the instinctive prayer of every soul aroused to a sense of the Divine Presence. So that we only assert a truth to which your noblest self responds, when we say : Your plan of life, my brother, to be worthy and right, n1u:,t be begotten

Only as you consciously accept his thought, adopt his purpose, follow his will can you feel that your energies are directed to their true end, that the pattern of your life ternple is all that it can be, all that it should be. Divinely comtnissioned rnen working out God's thoughts, these are tl1e worthies of earth. Ahraha1n's life was planned for hin1 fron1 the tin1e he left'' Ur of the Chaldees.'' Moses was an apparent failure until he saw the ~' Burning Bush \ and began to deliver Israel in God's way. Joshua was leader because he was Ie.d. He could con11nand successfully the hosts of the Lord, because he was hitnself cotntuanded by the Lord of Hosts. The anci~ent prophets were above kings for they spake for the King of J(rngs. Paul's sublin1e career began with a present he would be diflerent. You 1nust have heroic conditions before you can have heroes. As one has said, \A thousand unrecorded patriots helped to 1nake Washington. A tho~l­ sand l:overs of libertv contributed to Lincoln.\ ,.J \Ve recognize then the principle that character and especial! y unwonted character is the result of rnany separate agencies. Without doubt the streatn that ,is broadest and deepest is fed by the n1ost tributaries, but sonze one thing n1ay deter- 111ine, does detennine the course of the streatn, and it is the (Erection given to the confluent energies of a tnan that fixes his place in history. The strean1 wltich in its strong,. quiet flow enriches the earth and blesses n1.an, if sent another way tnight be only a foatning, destrtlc- tive torrent, or still another n1ight lose itself in the sands. Greatness tnisdi'rected is greatness lost. Torrents are interesting but n1en live along the great rivers. Niagara attracts for a day, but the Mississippi teeds for a lifetin1e. It is not povver but power applied that the -vvorld finally re1Ue1nbers, Sublin1e ain1s tnake the itntnortal nan1es. Now there was a volun1e about this n1an Paul that would have been a 1nighty force whatever course his life had taken. He was large-brained, large-hearted. He had an itnperious will. He was a tnan to leave a record, but vvhat that record should be was detern1ined not by his in- , \ heavenly vision.\ Perhaps our thought can- not be better illustrated than by a fuller reference to this n1an Paul. We never turn toward hin1 'vithout being both interested and aroused. What Paul was, -vvhat Paul did have detern1ined the destinies of en1pires. I do not think it can be questioned that 1nore than any other n1an Paul has n1oulded the history of these nine- teen centuries. Luther led the Refonna- tion but Paul led Luther. N ovv -vvhat gaYe Paul this con1n1anding influence? The roots of every lite run out on aU sides. A thou- sand energies contribute to tnake each individual. We classify all forces under two tenns ''Heredity\ and '~ Environt11ent,\ but think what they in1ply. Heredity hrings down to the present thP qualities of ancestors long asleep. Environn1ent n1eans hotne, books, teachers, friends, chance acquaintances., nature, every- thing tl1at touches life to-day. God's law is developt:nent. fie uses existing Inaterials. There are fe\v absolutely creative acts. When God \Vants a great n1an he grows hitp. The \big trees \ of the Y osetnite are no 111ore special creations than the '' sage busl1 \ of the prairie. They only indicate difterent seed genns, unfold- ing under different conditions ofclituate and soil. So every n1an of towering ability is n1ade so heritance nor by his education but by a single event early in his career. That event he calls as a \ heavenly vision.\ It -vvas a revelation of a new Lord of his life-the cotn- n1unica6on of a St1bli1ne and holy purpose. It can1e to hin1 frorn above. It was not originally his thought, but ·God's thought which he ac- cepted. It was a coinnlatH.l vvhich he obeyed. \ I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to 1nake thee both a 1ninister and a witness of those th.ings which thou hast seen and of those things in which I will appear unto thee delivering thee fron1 the people and frotn the Gentiles unto w hotn now I send thee, to open their eyes, to turn thetn fi·orn darln1ess to light and frorn the power of Satan unto God.\ .naturally.

He nitnply catne under a new con- ~

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 79 trol. A purpose unknown before took posses- sion of that strong personality which had gradually been developed frorn his childhood in Jars.us of Cilicia. Paul was an enthusiast by nature not by grace, by his first birth not by his second birth. That rnade bin~ an enthusiast for Christ rather than against hitn. He was a logician by inheritance and trai1~ing not by con- version. That turned his logic for Christ instead of against hin1. He was learned by hard study not by the descent of the Spirit. That sanctified his wisdo1n. The new Paul was the old Saul svvayed by a new love. His essential greatness all grevv out of his obedience to the '' heavenly vision\ his whole hearted acceptance of a divine purpose, a pattern \shewed unto him.\ In its practical1neaning this· truth says to you,. : n1y brother, Ask what is the noblest course you can follow. Ask your ovvn soul. Ask God. Be not content until you have adopted in tnind and heart, as your own, the life of highest ser- vice of which you are capable, nntil you feel that living this life, yon can say vvhen the day of · accounting co1nes, \ Behold, I tnacle it after the pattern she-vved unto tne.\ If you still ask what is this noblest life, this divine pattern? We answer, the law of helpfulness is the supretne lavv of life as revealed in the Gospel, the c1itnax of all those outward requiren1ents by which God \vould 111nke tnan like hi1nself. '' The end of the con~tnandrnent is love.\ ''Love is the fulfilling of the law.\ In the light of this truth, Pope's oft repeated and oft applauded saying, \An honest tnan is the noblest work of God,\ needs to be tnodified. He n1ay have been once but is not now. Re- quirenlents change with the grovvth of kno\\v- ledge. Every new stage of developtnents de- tuands a new fonn of excellence. There \vas a titne when the conditions of earth and air could . . . \ support vegetation only. They changed and the lower fonns of anitnal Hfe appeared. Changed still tnore, until now they support tnan. A sculptor works one way \vhen he begins upon a block of 1narble and quite another way when finishing the statue. The ·figure in the rough is the best he can do vvith his heavy chisel but not the best he can do \vith his finer tools. So God has certain laws for the beginning of tnoral developn1ent and other iaws for its c<nnpletion. Character in the rough is the best product of certain requiretnents, but not of the higher obligations. So \Ve say there n1ay have been a titne in the progress of hutnanity vvhen an honest tnan was the noblest work of God, but it is not true now. The higher req uiren1ents of the Gospel detnand higher living, honest living and son1ething itnore. To better understand this let us in1agine a savage developing tovvard Christian civilization. As a savage he is law less or the only law he knows is desire. What he wants he gets if he can. The rnanner of getting is of no concern. The only question is one of ability. Might tnakes Right. If he wants another's suit ofbeacls and feathers he takes it. If he wants his scalp he takes that. His law library consists of a single sentence, '' Follow your desire.\ He is his own legislature, police force and judiciary. This n1akes hi1n savage and so a savage. N O\Y if he is to be civilized, the first nevv lavv \vill be one of restraint. He 1nust be taught the equality of others' rights. When he would pnt out his hand to untether a pony he covets he n1ust find another hand laid upon his, the hand of con1- tnand, \ Thou shalt not steal.\ When he vvould raise his ton1ahawk, he tnust hear another voice b€side his own desire, \ thou shalt not kill.\ To get this principle of others' rights into the savage brain is tedious work. His 1noral eyes open slowly. At first he steals a little less than he wishes and thinks it virtue, like the colored Christian vvho rose in a ~outhern prayer tneeting to thank the Lord for helping hi1n overcotne ten1ptation. He had taken only a pair of shoes when he n1ight have taken a fine pair of boots. This is real virtue for one just etnerging fro1n barbarisn1. But as the ne\v lavv continues its working~ he takes less and less, until at last he recognizes the absolute equality of rights and is established in the practice of'' not stealing \ \ not killing.'' He ernerges frotn his state of sa\~age lawlessness, an honest tnan, a peaceable citizen. The law of restraint, the first necessary law, has done its best and he is its noblest \vork. It is a telling proof of the native savagery hiding under apparent civilization that to-day

Israel was put into school, the pritnary school of virtue, where the first lesson was. \what not to do.,., A hard lesson to learn and all the discipline of tvvo thousand years of Jewislt history -vvas needed to enforce the lesson. Then in the '' fulness of titnes '' Christ catne to introduce by precept and Returning to our brother, the savage, under p-t~ocess of civilization the question cornes : Has he reached the perfection of 111anhood, when, under the law of Fepression, he has tnade it ' a l~abit or principie of life, to keep his hands out of another 1nan's pocl<et ancl away frorn his tlno:at? Is the highest virtue in not doing VVI'o.ag? Let us adtnit it is high virtue, higher th·an rnultitudes attain unto, but surely not the highest. A new ~aw 111eets the rnan who has graduated fro1n the school of restraint, the law of constraint. It suggests: You take nothing that belongs to another. Ought you not to give to another son1ething that belongs to yourself. He .has no right to it save the right of nee\.!. \_\':ou are honest with hitn now be generous toward hitn. It seeks to add to honesty bel pful- ness, to brotherly respect, brotherly kindness, to justice, tnercy. Th.e new law, like the old, gets at first hut a feeble grip on the life. The 1nan gi,res a little at first and his heart glo\vs with a seNse of virtue. Then as he grows under the law the needs of others as well as their rights· rise higher in his regard, until they are abreast of h~i~s own and even 111ount above the1n, for he wiU deny hitnself for another's sake, and there he stands a nobler n1an than before, generous as wen as honest, good as well as righteous, the noblest work of God, for there is no higher l'aw of li£e known to n1ortals than the law of loving self sacrifice, the law ordained of hitn who catne frotn Heaven \not to be 1ninistered unto but to tninister and to give his life a ransotn for tnany.\ ln. this illustration we have really traced the history of the hutnan race· Whatever our opinion of the theory of evolution, _we adn1it the historic developn1.ent of 1nan fro1n pri1neval savage1·y. The further back we go in the Bible the ~neat~er we get to barbadstn until we cotne upon. the flarn ing sword at the gate of the lost Eden.. Beyond that all is 1nystery, but on this . side ~11 is clear. 1,he race to which God began to reveal hitnself in the days of Abrahan1 was exarnple the higher principle of usefulness, to teach tnen the larger lesson of \what to do.\ He built upon the law and the prophets. He left the law of restraint as God gave it, only · enlarging its scope so as to include thoughts and secret purposes as well as act_s. He had corn- paratively little to say about'' negative '' virtues. This lesson had already been taught. His mission was to lead tnen higher. Read his. precepts. \Love your enetnies\ not tnerely refrain fron1 injuring thetn. \Bless thetn that curse you,\ not tnerely keep fron1 cursing in return. '' Do good to the1n that hate you and pray for then1 that despitefully use you and persecute you.\ Thus he carried duty forward frotn the sphere of \ not doing,\ to that of'' doing.\ Think of his parables. The priest and the Levite were proba- bly honest n1en and did not owe a Ron1an penny to the poor rnan by the wayside, and so coolly passed hitn by. Neither did the Satnaritan owe hitn anything, but he went to hi1n, helped hitn and spent 111oney for hin1. Christ points to that Smnaritan and turns to the world saying, '' Go thou and do like- wise.\ Be tnore than honest. Be helpful. That other tnan whose '' fields brought forth bountifully, so that he rnust needs tear down his barns and build greater,'' was ar:. honest tnan. He sin1ply gathered what was his own. No n1ortal could accuse hitn of unrighteousness be- cause he was rich. But becau.se he proposed the selfish enjoyrnent of his riches saying, \ Soul thou hast tnuch goods laid up for 1nany years, take thine ease, eat, drink and be n1erry,\ God said '' thou fool, thisw night thy soul shall be re- quired of thee, then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided ?\ Christ represents that sentence as pronounced against an honest

That is the light of n1en, the light of truth in which we chil- dren of light are to walk. It was all a sacrifice upon the altar of our hurnanity. \ He was rich yet for our sakes becatne poor.'' \ I-Ie was wounded for our transgressions,\ \ He died the just for the unjust,\ '' He went about doing good,'' \ He catne not to be n1inistered unto hut to tninister.'' By that life and death, was the highest law of God proclairned in tenns which all can understand, and with an en1phasis which should startle tnortals out of the cornplacency of · self-centered living. As God separated one fatnily out of the world to teach thetn the pri111ary law of restraint, so Christ separated twelve ~1nen to teach then1. the higher law of usefulness. The object of nll his training was to tnake thetn servants, hi~ servants and hutnanity's servants for his sake. They did not like the lesson. They lem·ned it slowly. Aln1ost to the hour of his death they quarreUed - as to who should be greatest. Then he answered, '' He that would be greatest an1ong you let hin1 be your 1ninister and he that would be chiefest a1nong you let hin1 be the servant of all.\ They learned slowly but they learned \vell and at last vvent forth by their lives and inspired precepts to repeat the lesson of unselfish helpfulness to all the world. While thus indicating the progress of lawfro111 the Old Testatnent to the new, trotn Moses to Christ, I would not iinply that the higher obli- gation of service was unknown in the Jewish Econotny. Many of the tnost itnpressive, utter- ances of Scripture concerning helpfulness are found in the \law and the prophets.\ I sirnply 1nean to assert the root principle of each dispen- sation. The Jewish Econotny was centripetal in its general influence, the Christian centrifugal. The one was ordained to establish righteousness, the other to diffuse righteousness. The one vvas etnploye~ in laying the foundations of upright character, the other in building the ten1ple of Godlike love and beneficence. That Christ's teaching was distinctive is apparent frotn a single sentence, \ Bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law ·of Christ.\ This then, rny brother, is the worthy purpose revealed frotn Heaven:, \the pattern sh~evved unto you~\ a Christ-~ike ~ife of loving service. It tells you to enter other lives to b1ess then1, to gain know!redge, not for the sake of personal advancetnent, but for great usefulness in the vvorld. It bids y<>u tnark each day of your student life with the charitv that ~' suffereth ~ o/ long and is kind.\ In alJ this we do r1ot forget what ,tnust ever be the inspiration of such a Hfe, whole-hearted subn1ission to Christ as your personal Saviour, your Lord and your God. Looking again at our text we find a further truth. The revelation of the pattern was given upon. the n1ount when :Wioses was aJone with God. So it is always upon \the Mount\ vvhen separated for a titne fron1 the plain of daily living that we receive our hightest inspiration. The rush of the \\Vorld's life 1nakes on1y the thund~r tones God's voice audible. We do not hear, we cannot hea1· until startled into silence ! and then the voice that startles us appeals to our fears. For every personal revelation the F~1ther of our spirits calls us apart to bitnself. A subli1ne purpose is not fo nned atnid the conten- tions and rivalries of the surging tntlltitudes though they be the Israel of God. There hun1an plans fill the 1nind to the exclusion of the divine plan. We becotne absorl>ed in the questions of a day, the struggle fot popular prizes. Upon the plain there is no sweep of vision, no sufficient cotnprehension of the extent and glory of life, and so Gc d calls us one by one upon the n1ount. In various ways the separation is effected, the solitude of the soul secured. One is taken up into the thick darkness ofbereaven1entwhere the cloud of grief shuts out the fonner world of un- worthy an1bitions. With another the\ Mount\ is the \ holy hill of Zion='' God's chosen place of n1eeting his children. Ia the soletnn silence of the sanctuary 1nan ~scapes frotn the confusing, distracting, despiritualizing influence of daily life upon the plain. In other ways, nt other titnes, in other places is the pattern given, but always on the \J\.tiount '' above the confusion of the catnp, and always rn the .solitude of the divine presence. This suggests the purpose for \vhich this <hly has been instituted. You are asked to lay ~ls~ide

82 THE CONCO,RDIENSIS. your usual duties, that here or in the retire1nent of your own roon1 you n~ay star1d i~1ce to face with God and nsk, \For what an1 I living? For what should I live?\ To-day, n1y brother, settle the question of your 1nission in the world. Listen to God. Speak to God. Choose Hitn as your Master whose life your soul sees is clivi ne. And now we teach a Hnal truth. While the '' pattern \ \Vas.., given upon the Mount, the ''tabernacle\ was built upon the plain. Fron1 the solitude of the divine presence Moses can1e down to the turn1oil of the Jewish n1ultitude and there wrought out the divine purpose and plan. So we always build and n1nst build upon the plain. rrhe Mount is only for instructions and inspiration. Gladly would we remain. Like Peter, in the glory of the Transfiguration we say, \ Let us 111ake here a tabernacle;' but we wist not \Vhat we say. We never build in our hours of spiritual exaltation and heavenly con1- tnunion. Then we only get our pattern, we see the divine work we 1nust do an1id the pressure and confusion of \vorldly surrounding~. It 1nust have bee·n a fearful contrast for Moses to cotn.e fro111 the silence and holiness of the Mount to the idolatrous clan1or of the valley where he found the people worshipping the golden calf. Yet in that valley, a1nong that people and by their aid vvas he to build the dwelling place of the spiritual Jehovah. And so our return frorn the place of heavenly con1n1union to the world of. sin and selfishness, the worlcl that bows before the golden in1age, is often a severe shock to our new and holy purposes. \.,.. et in the rnidst of the idola- trous world, under oftin1es depressing conditions, are we to live out the life of spirituality and luunble service, shown unto us fron1 above. Our work, n1y brother, our heaven-directed work, is in the \Vorld and for the world. It is holy living in the 111idst of unholy influences, unselfish living in the n1idst of hard-hearted covetousness, a life of faith an1id the scoffs of unbelief. Thrice did God warn Moses as though he knew the perverting tendency of the plain, q Look that thou 1nake then1 after thek pattern shewed unto thee on the Mount.\ And so are we ever cautioned. l(eep the divine standard hefore your eyes. Hold to the purpose you gained when alone vvith God. A single thought n1ore for our encourage- Inent. When Moses left the solitude of God's presence, he did not [eave God's presence, for there upon the plain wtts the cloudy pillar before the can1p. So always God is near us, God is with us,. This is the new narne of God; Itn111anueL 1'hrough daily, hourly fellowship with Christ, we gain the streJ?.gth and wisdon1 needed for Christ-like 1'iving. He who shows us ···the pattern helps us to build. He who ·inspires a worthy purpose aids in its fulfilhnent. He who tneets us upon the Mount abides with us upon the plain. - ----------- -~---- - ·- ---~----- ·--- - Clippings. -The Harvard College base-ball tean1 cleared $z,soo last year. -It is n1n1ored that Chicago University is to be re-established. -Noyes has been elected captain of the Yale nine, to succeed Stagg. -l,.. ale has no chair of Gen11an, and no regu- lar professor of Gennan. -Pao Yun, President of Pekin College, IS translating Shakespeare into Chinese. -·A curious custorn at Haverford, Pa., is to require each student to care for a bed of flowers. -The Cornell students are forbiddei1 by the authorities at Ithaca giving their yell on the street. -Four colleges in the United State.A have daily papers: Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Cornell. -England has only one college paper edited by undergraduates, the Review, vvhich is pub- lished at Oxford. -Nineteen thousand dollars in prizes and the incorne of $r8o,ooo in scholarships are annually given at Atnherst. · -.-A Western college has a father and son in the graduating class, the father being 65 years old nncl the s_on 24-. -Dartn1outh's \vinter recess is longer than

It speaks well for the increased interest in literary 1natters on the part of the students. It was Isaac Barrow, who, two centuries ago, se1id: -' The reading of books, what is it but conversing with the wisest rnen of all ages and all countries, who thereby cotntnunicate to us their 1nost deliberate thoughts, choicest notions, and ~est inyentions, couched in good expression, and digested in exact 1nethod.\ The thought of the above, that only by thorough and careful reading can we ac- quaint ourselves with the story of the 1nental developtnent of the race, is as true to-day as it was when Issac Barrow lived and wrote. A chi1nerical doctrine is that which is held by n1ost students, the doctrine that success in a prize contest rneans si1nply the obtaining ofthe visible end, i. e. a prize. If W:e n1ay be pennitted to express an opinion it is, that no student who works and works honestly in_ a prize contest of a thoroughly literary character need despair of success, for even if the offered reward. 1nay not fall to his lot, he has nevertheless obtained a prize far n1ore useful and enduring in the added wisdon1 and 1nental cultur-e which tnust be his fron1 a careful study of the lights of literature. * * * WE regret that what we said above of the essay contests cannot be tnade general. At this writing, the list of con1petitors for the Veeder exten1poraneous stage is not rnore than one-half con1pleted. Aside fron1 the pecuniary value of the prize, courtesy at least to the gentlernan who has so kindly offered it ought to protnpt those who possibly can to see to it that the conditions of its giving be tnet with. * * * THE CoNCORDIENsrs is in. receipt of an invi- tation fron1 the Union CoUege Alun1ni Associa- tion of the Northwest to their annual dinner to be held at the Hotel Richelieu, Chicago, on the 28th inst. A full account of this dinner and of the n1eeting preceeding it will be given in our March issue. One sentence in the invitation we wish to quote, it is, '' Let there be a 111eeting worthy of the Northw-estern Ahunni, for the purpose of united congraiulatt\oJzs.\ We sincerely hope that congratulations wiU not be the only fruits of the tneeting, yet without the least grain of bitterness in our criticisn1 -vve fear that this has too often been the outcotne of such gatherings in the past. 'vV e would not for an instant doubt the loyalty of Union's sons in theW est, thev are n1any ·and influential, yet fron1 . ~ the West, Union has always drawn the fewest ~tudents. If our alu1nni, who are 1nen1bers of the association of the Northwest, have not sons to educate, 1night they not use their influence with their friends and neighbors who have sons about going east for an education, infonning thetn that Union College, an institution of no tnean repute, is \still existing at Schenectady. Let us hope that substantial aid for the college will be the result of this tneeting.
