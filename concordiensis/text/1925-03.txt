A COMMUNICATION To the Editor of the Concordiensis: There is reason to believe that a misunder~tanding exists on the part of the fraternities, not members of the i Interfraternity Council. as to their/ eligibility in connection with the inter- fraternity wrestling and relay compe- titions which started last Saturday af- ternoon. To make clear the intramural ath- letic program, I am writing to say that all activities conducted by the Depart- ment of Physical t'\aining and Ath- :etics are always open to al'l under- graduates, fraternity groups or clu·bs, and all the fraternities and clubs. are' urged to enter teams in the wrestling matches and relay races. The first annual Union College In- door Championships in boxing and wrestling which are scheduled for Tuesday night, March 31, is an inter- class and individual championship, which should not be confused with the interfraternity program.

Then, after a lengthy delay, arrangen1ents were made where- by a rink might be constructed at Cen- tral park. This was finally accomp- lished and practice begun, only a short time before the opening game. The hardships connected with holding practice at a place more than a mile remote from the gymnasium are ab-. vions, and yet a squad of 20 or more men were on hand every day, ready and anxious to work in spite of the n~any obstacles.

When the squad returned, following a short midyear respite, they found that the weather man had entirely de- prived them of tl'teir fi.nk; and that the college, through the medium of the mid-year \housecleaning had render- ed ineligible three of their star per- formers, including Captain Storrs Bishop. With six games still to be played, and no chance for practice, Manager Frank Long sought to can- ·cel the remainder of the schedule. Amnerst, Syracuse; Middlebury, Will~ iams, and R. P.

To this day he doesn't know. which parent or aunt or uncle paid most of hi! school and college bills. Buthedoesknow that he can never repay those obligations created, except by insuring ample money for the education of his own two children. So he has recently arranged en- dow!llent policies for both, to mature at the beginning of each school and college year. He believes that his children will moregenuinelyappreci;tte their education by paying for it out of their own funds.
