During the past two years Union's Musical .Association has attained a position among the best organizations of its kind in the country. In every town and city \vhere our musical clubs have given concerts they have been enthusias- tically received, splendidly entertained and well comn1,ended by the press. The prospects for good clubs this year are excellent. The association has lost very few members since last year and has gained 111 uch good material from the fresh1nan class. Mr. Joseph O'Neil,,Med. '97, to whom so much is due for the past success of the 0rganization, has again consented to act as leader of the Mandolin club. The Glee club has also secured a 1nost capable director in Mr. Frank MacMahon, whose work with that club last year was so highly commended. The Banjo club at its first tneeting; Monday even~ ing, chose Mr. Clarence Stewart, I 900, to act as leader. Mr. Stewart played with that club last year and clearly sho\ved the ability necessary for the office to which he has been elected. With such leaders as these the quality of music that will be offered by the clubs is certain to be of the finest. Although the tnariagement has made no definite dates for this season's concerts, it has decided upon the places to be visited and the approximate times that the trips are to be taken~ The first concert will be given in Schenectady at the Van Curler during the latter part of this tenn, then Albany, Atnsterdatn, Johnstown and Saratoga will be visjtt.:ld during the winter term ; and the season will be closed by an e:xtended trip during Easter vacation~ All that is necessary to insure the success of the Musical Association's plans is the hearty support of the students, which should be given freely and gladly to an organization that does so much to advance the interests of Old Union. . ceommittees of tl)e faculty for ,J·8g6-'97· Education-Professors Ripton, Whitehorne, Wells, Truax, Patterson, Landreth and Perkins and Instructor Bennett.

2 THE CONCORDIENSIS. Golf ~lub. The golf club is a feature of the college sports that has been developed almost entirely by the faculty. The club has been reorganized and the faculty nO'W cordially extend an associate n1em- bership to all students or others who are interested in golf. A match game was played on Saturday with a picked team of golfers frotn the General Electric Company. Rotneling and Bishop did the best work for the General Electric team, while Professors Hale and Daly excelled for the college. The score : Union College-Perkins, o; Hale, 8; Lin- hart, 3; Daly, ro; Edwards, o; Pepper, 5· Total, 26. General Electric-Romeling, 8 ; Ondaw, o ; Davis, o ; Williatns, o ; Bishop, 6 ; Green, o. Total, 14. Several other match games will be played during the fall. The officers of the club are : President, Professor Hale ; secretary, Doctor Linhart; treasurer, Professor Edwards. Y. fT\. \. fL fiotes. The prospects for theY. M. C. A. years of 1896-' 97 are very bright. The association has already gained over twenty new members, and the whole work is in a prosperous condition. The reception for new students, held at the house of Dr. Raymond, Friday evening, Sept. Sept 18, was one of the most successful in the histol'y of Y. M. C. A. work at Union. A large nutnber of new students availed themselves of the opportunity of becoming better acquainted with each other, with the upper class men and the faculty. The singing of college songs by a number of the glee club which were present lent enjoyment to the occasion and everybody present passed a profitable and enjoyable even- . n1ng. Mr. Fred S. Goodman, assistant state secre- tary of New York will be at Union, Saturday and Sunuay, Oct. 3 and 4, and will speak to the students Sunday P. J\1. in the chapel. flmus~meQts at tl]~ VaQ \urler.

George J. Sweetland was elected captain last fall but did not return this year. Louis F ~ O'Neil was elected captain of the track team, Wednesday afternoon. It was a good selection as Louis is an enthusiastic athlete and fully qualified for the position. At a recent meeting of the executive cotn- mittee of the Princeton University Athletic Association, the following resolution was adop- ted: ~'No tnan who has attended recitations or lectures in any other college or university shall be eligible to represent Princeton in any'branch of intercollegiate sports unless he has been a bona fide student in Princeton one full collegiate year.\ This _ _rule will bar out Kilpatrick and Cregan, who left Union to enter Princeton this fall, frotn all the intercollegiate events of the year. Preparations are being made to hold a Handi- cap Tennis Tournatnent very shortly. There are many fellows in college who have enjoyed the game, and among these are some expert players. A large number of entries are expec- ted, and the tournament will be both interesting and exciting. The committee of arrangements consists of Fuller, '97, Campbell, '97, Hoxie, '98, Merriman, '98, Hinman, '99 and C. D. Stewart, I 900. Dr. John Dever, med.

THE Musical Association has had its first re- hearsals and reports bright prospects for good clubs this year. We are glad to hear that so im- portant a student organization has· such a hright outlook for a successful season, and feel assured · that with the hearty support of the student body the plans of the manage1nent for an extended trip ·during Easter vacation will be realized. · THE class of '98 is entitled to six members on THE CoNCORDIENSIS staff of assistant editors. At present there are but four. If there are any other members of the class who wish to cornpete for the positions of Editor-in-Chief or Literary Editor they rnust send in their names immediately. The class of '99 is also entitled to six representa- tives; at present there are three vacancies. CHANGES are to be made in the College Library. The faculty have taken the matter into thought- ful consideration and decided that sonJ.ething must be done. There truly is much room for im- provement as THE CoNCORDIENSIS has from time to time pointed out, and we hope that while the faculty are giving their attention to this rnost im- portant part of the college that they will not stop short of an entire new system. It is a change that must be made sooner or later. Why not make it now? IT IS customary to renovate the various build- ings of the college during the sununer months. The students are away then and the work can be carried on to better ad vantage. The gymnasium seems to have been left entirely as it was last June. A few days work during the sumrner tnonths would have placed the lockers in good repair. At present there are only a few of them. which can be used. The doors to many of them have been broken and in some instances entirely torn from the hinges. About five of them are so they can be locked. Unless so1nething is done it is only a question of a few months before the gyrnnasiun1 will become as useful to the student as is the bowling alley at the present time. UNION CoLLEGE, Sept. 27, '96. To The Ooncordiensis : I read the article in last week's CoNCORDIENSIS regarding library rules and also the editorial written upon the same subject. As you said, the entire library system should be revised. There is one point however upon which you did not touch and which could be remedied imn1ediately. . I re· fer to the time of opening the library. Within the last ten days I have gone to the library five or six times in t.he morning and found the door locked. I 1nay have gone too early, but on two occasions it was nearly ten o'clock. .At one time I looked through the window and saw the lib:carian sitting at his desk, yet the door was locked and he would not come and open it. It seems to me that of all the departrnents of the college, there is none which should be made more open than the library. Eight o'clock is none to early to unlock the door. There are n1any students. who have a vacant hour innnediately after chapel. They could spend that time profi. ta bly in the library. STlJDENT. The above letter touches upon a point concern- ing the library managen1ent which could be easily rectified. The faculty in the past have never re- fused to consider the requests of the students when it was in their power to do so. THE CoN- CORDIENSIS also urges the early opening of the library. IT IS the duty of every Christian student to ally himself with the Christian work of the college. That we are students of Union College implies, that we are perfor1ning the duties that devolve upon us as students. If we are Christians ought it not to hnply that we are perfonning the duties that Christ has assigned to us. There is no place in life where a n1an can better put his Christianity into practice than in college. Nowhere are the opportunities greater, nowhere the reward so great. And if a man does not do this work in college, is it reasonable to suppose that he will when he leaves college? It is not necessary that a student should devote himself entirely to in- tellectual pursuits and r6ligious work and neglect that portion of.a college life which is so essential to a well developed man. Christianity stands for activity and interest in college sports and college affairs, and THE CoNCORDLENSIS believes that the Y. M. C. A. stands for college spirit and college enthusiasm. The new students especially are needed in the work, and the development that comes from such work may benefit you.

.. THE CONOORDIENSIS. 5 From t~e ~xe ~a f]Qes. Princeton has changed its name fron1 college . to university. The freshtnan class of Lehigh University numbers I 18 members, a small gain over last year. At a meeting of the Sophomore class at Uni- versity of North Carolina, resolutions were adopted abolishing hazing. Lacrosse is being agitated at Leland Stanford University this year. There are strong indica- tions that a team will be formed. At Harvard the athletic committee has ap- pointed an instructor in baseball. Ali students who so desire may learn the game. Fifty-four thousand dollars were spent at Yale last year on athletics. Of this $Io,coo was sub- scribed by the under-graduates and the remain- der was raised chiefly by the proceeds of base ball and foot hall games.- The Oneontan. This compares favorably with Union.

The Concordiensis. VoL. XX. UNION COLLEGE, OCTOBER 7, 1896. No.3. Tt}e DebatiQ~ 8oeieties. Every college student should be able on. leav- ing the halls of Old Union to express lu mself clearly and forcibly upon his feet. The art. of exte 1 nporaneous speaking and argutnentatlve debate is not alone useful but absolutely neces- sary in all the professions. It is as itnportant for a physician or business 1nan to be a@le to make a clear and concise statement of an issue as for the lawyer or preacher. It was for this end that Union's two debating societies wen~ founded a century ago and it was this high purpose that has kept the1n alive and full of vigor during the many years of the college's existance. The advantages of mem- bership in the Philomathean and Adelphic societies were never better than today. The rootns occupied by the Philotnatheans in South college and those of the Adelphics in North college are large and attractive. Debates are held each week which embrace the political and international questions of the day. During the winter terrr1 two prizes of $5o each are offered in joint debate, one for the best address by an individual debater and the other to the soctetv procuring the greater nutnber of points. Both societies have reorganized and will by the end of the vveek have .begun the first of the series of debates that will aid in the preparation for the contest.

The annual fall athletic meet of Union College will take place at the Driving Park, Saturday afternoon, October 24. All entries must be in by noon, Oct. 21. The time of the meet is not far distant and there iR very little training being done. Every tnan in college, who. is physically able, ought to be out on the track or in the gymnasium every day training for soLne event. Very few men now in college possess a lead in any event, so every one has a fair show of winning a prize. An hour's training every day until the tneet will put a man in fair condition, and every tnan in college can spare that much time. Even if a man does not win a prize the exercise tha~ he will get from training will be a benefit. The freshmen especially, ought to take a principal part in these events and show the college what material they have in the athletic line. Cotne out and join in the cross-country runs. They are held twice a week under the direction of Captain O'Neil '97 and notices are always found post~d on the bulletin board giving full information relating to thetn. Don't wait until you are asked to take part, but if you can do anything at all, come out and show your college spirit. There will be fourteen events, and first, second and third prizes will be given. The prizes will be silk badges suitably inscribe~. Beside the regular events there will be a re_lay race between the classes, and Hild, '98, will try to lower the college two tnile bicycle record, paced by a tandem.

The opening gam~e of the foot ball season was played last Saturday with the Laureates of • Troy and resulted in a score of 14 to o in favor of the visitors. Although there were· many good individual plays made by Union there was • a notioeable lack of team work. In two in- stances if tnen had been backed up properly Union would nave kept the ball. Still, a very good game was played considering the disad- vantages under which the team has labored and better work can be expected in the future. Owing to a base ball game at the driving park · ·~the atten~ance was light, hut the players were ' cheered by the presence of many of their fair friends and sympathizers. Twenty tninute halves were played. Hoxie kicked off and Thacher got the ball but 20 yards were lost. Union was forced down the field but regained the ball on their zo-y.ard line, when Crichton gained 10 yards around the end and a series of rushes 'brought the ball vvithin five yards of Laureates goal. Here the Laureates made a strong stand and got the ball on downs ; then the pigskin was given to Phil. Draper, who in two beautiful runs rnade a touchdown. Aldrich failed to kick a goal. In the tetnainder of the half Union won and lost the ball alternately and time was called with the ball in Union's posses- sion. Score, 4-o. In the second half the Laureates started with a long kick, Draper caught the ball and carried it nearly to the goal when Mc-Chesney made a touchdown, and Aldrich kicked the goal. Hoxie kicked off again and caught the ball on a return kick, but the Laureates gained ground with monotonous regula..-ity nearly to the goal. The ball was kicked back to the centre of the field but was lost and the Laureates pushed Union toward the goal and Draper scored a touchdown. Aldrich failed to kick a goal and time was called before either side could again score. Su1nn1ary: UNION. POSI'.FION'S. LA..UREA.TiES. Price ............. right end ........

r. .. , --~. -:·.· 'rHE CON,OORDlE.NSIS. 3 The Freshman class at the medical this year is probably the largest in the history of the in- stitution. The Juniors and Seniors are both back in large nutnbers and many new meu are not yet registered. When all are in, there is no · doubt that the unusually large number of students of la,st year will be greatly augmented~ From the present outlook our football eleven will be the pride of the college. We have much excellent raw tnaterial besides many old players including Bennett, the o-ld varsity centre. The men are in active training and taking good care of thetnselves. Charley Weaver, who knows what an athlete needs be~ter than any man in Albany, has charge of the training table. No eleven could ask for a better hustler as captain and manager than Billy Griswold. ''Gris\ has arranged a schedule of games which, consider ... ing that this is the first tearr1 that the ''Medics\ have ever put on the gridiron, is highly gratify- ing. The season will be opened next Saturday with R. P. L at Ridgefield, while on the foUow- ing Wednesday the men go to Schenectady to fight for honors on the old campus. If possible a gatne with CorneH will be played here. The Junior class held a meeting. Tuesday afternoon in the chapel and elected the follow- ing officers : President, Thomas A. Crichton ; vice-.president, Roger Sinclair ; . secretary, Ar- lington H. Mallery ; treasurer, Peter Nelson; toasttnaster, Donald J. H uttorr ; base ball manager, William J. Whipple; foot ball manager, Willis Merriman ; manager of track athletics, Orrin G. Cox ; prophet, Harvey R. Hover; business manager of THE CoNCORDI- ENSis., Charles J. Vrooman. Com,mittees were appointed as follows: Class banquet, Turner, Hild, Haviland ; class cut, Mattison, Cullen ; to draw up resolutions protesting against debating, Avery, Swan, Merriman. The freshman class also had a meeting Tues- day afternoon at which W m. Sage was. elected captain of the class foot ball team, and the fol- lowing committee was appointed to arrange for a class banquet, Harold S. Kirby, N ewtnan Walbridge and John H. Cook. A unique class pin was adopted, it being a representation of the \ Idol \ bearing the inscription, U. 1900. J. N. White, '94, of An1sterdam, N. Y., is attending the Albany Law School. Guernsey, '99, was one of the aids in the Republican parade Friday night. George. Dann of Walton, class of'96 at Union. College has been secured for under Professor at Delaware Academy next year. Mr. Dann stood second in his class.- ... Stamford Mirror. Phil. Draper, who played full back for Wil- liams last year and is now playing on the Lau- reate team, spent Sunday with his cousin, E. E. Draper, '97. The members of the athletic team during the past week have been taking cross-country runs, prelitninary to work on the track. Saturday tnorning a run of about six miles was taken. At the annual games of the Canadian An1ateur Athletic Association, Charles Kilpatrick won the 88o-yard run against A. W. Gifford, the local champion. The Canuck was only four feet behind Kilpatrick last year and consequently he had tnany backers. Charlie won by 12 yards in 2 m. 3-5 sec~ Ftl]leties. At the college n1eeting held Friday morning, Oct. 2, Orrin G. Cox '98 was unanimously elected to the office of assistant tnanager of track athletics. Cox is well qualified for the position and will fulfill its duties in a most creditable manner. Last years' base ball team held a meeting last Thursday afternoon and choose Charles Par- sons '98 for captain of this years' nine. Charley is a cool, clear headed ball twister and will 1nake ·a good captain.

BURHOWs, PRINTER AND BINDER, SCHENECTADY, N.Y. IT wAS stated in last weeks CoNCORDIENSIS that the Junior c~ass was entitled to six represent- atives on the staff of this paper. This was a tnis- take. By referring to· the ru-les governing the publication of the paper it was found that the Junior class was allowed three representative and the Sophon1ore · class five. There are but two vacancies and these are to be filled from the Sophomore class. Five will be chosen from the present Freshman class to constitute the reporto- . rial staff next year. A LARGE number of young.ladies were on the campus last Saturday watching the foot _ball game. It is needless to say that their presence is a great source of encouragement to the foot ball players. Pride, if nothing more, will spur the .men on to greater effort when they are present. THE CoNCORDIENSIS suggests that some seats be placed along the side lines on the terrace side of the campus and that they be reserved for the young ladies who attend future games. SEVERAL editorials have been written hereto· fore regarding the college library. They have been directed against the present system which appears to the CoNCORDIENSIS to be entirely in- adequate. We wish in the present issue to direct our criticiS:m upon the students themselves. There are all sorts and conditions of men in this institu- tion. There is the indi:fferen t man, the selfish n1an,, the noisy man, the sly and crafty man, and there has in times past been the thief among us. He may be here now. A.ll are brought together at different tin1es in the college library. Individual characteristics are n1ost prominently displayed in the reading room and alcoves. The indifferent man walks noisly into the library, pulls down the books and rarely repiaces them properly upon the shelves. T.b.e selfish man occupies two and some- times three chairs. His feet are heavy and he Reeds a chair,'f>or each one of thein. The noisy man thinks that all the students are anxious to hear him study. He comes to the library not for his own good but for the good of others(?). The sly and crafty man is also a selfish man. He is certainly the \American Hog \ Several books may have been assigned by some professor for refer\\ ance. 'l'be sly and crafty man is the first to reach the library. He takes all the assigned books and though he can read but one at a time, he holds the others in his lap. If he has not finished when the hour is up, he takes his book and hides it in some remote corner of the library or takes it out under his coat. How are the other students going to read the assigned book ? He doesn't , care so long as, he can read it himself. rrhen comes the thief. He is a literary thief. He is anxious to acquire a library of his <?Wn. He looks about the shelves an determines what books he wishes. Last year he stole an entire encyclopedia. The donar of these books watched them disappear one by one. :Bryce's American Commonwealth in two volumns next disappeared. The thief evidently wished duplicate copies or there were duplicate thieves as three sets of this work were stolen one after the other as soon as they were replaced . This is a brief description of the abuse of the college library. Such a condition of things has existed in the past. Is it to conti11ue to exist in the future? THE CoNCORDIENSIS has ·entered upon this discussion of the library for the -benefit of the students and we call upon the students to aid us. We wish to call attention particularly to the selfish man, the noisy man and the crafty man. And if possible to catch the thief. THE CoNCORDIENSIS has an efficient staff of detectives and every one of these violators of right and decency will be exposed in the colun1ns of this paper. ' ).

A little care in this rnatt~r on the students pa1·t will greatly benefit the c?llege publications and will also please our ad vert1sers. THE Musical Association of the college bas entered upon its work with a fa1r prospect of future success. The students should not hesitate to aid them in every way possible. The associa- tion rarely calls upon then1 for financial aid and they always give n1uch 1nore in return., in the way of entertain1uent, than they receive from the students. · TbP work of organization: the neces sary practice which devolves upon those who have given up their time to this organization. and the nature of the pastiine itself are all points in its favor and should coutmand the heartiest support of every student.

A close and exciting game of foot ball was played by the horne team against !:!,g.bart College on the campus last Saturday. The score was Hobart 6, Unio~ as it. favors the visitors it does not reveal the superior team work and general good playing that was doq.e. by Captain Palmer's men. The game was called at 3 o'clock, a half hour after the scheduled tirne. 'rhe delay being caused by the refusal of Hobart's captain to call Lyon from the field,. who had been protested by Captain Paltner on the grounds that he knew the signals of the Union teatn, he having played on Union's scrub up to within a week before this gatne. Upon the decision of Prof. Patterson, Pres- ident of the Athletic Advisory ·Board, Lyon left the field. Time being called, Hobart· put the ball in play by a ki~k off· to Union's 45-yar~ line. Sweetla:nd followed the ball and gained it on a fumble for Hobart. The vis.itors made a gain of five yards; three downs followed without gains when the ball was passed to Sweethind for a kick. Sweetland fumbled and Thomas fell on the ball, tnaldng a gain of 10 yards. for. Union. Crichton carried the ball over the catnpus for 20 yards on two plays through Robarts line. Union had gained 1 o more yards whert ·the ball rested on Hobart's five )'ard line and a touchdown for Union se.etned a$sured. AU: attempt was made to carry the ball around Hobart'.s .left end but failed. On the ne:xt d()wn the ball fell clear of the heap, but was quickly covered by Case. No Union man covered Case and the alert player seeing his opportunity dashed off down the field with the ball a.nd scored a touchdown for Hobart. Carr kicked goal. Hoxie kicked off for Union. Hobart kept the ball in Union's field until time was called. Hoxie kicked off for Union in the second half. Hobart returned the ball to the centre of the field. Union· made successive plays through Hobart's line and around the end and finally by brilliant team work pushed Crichton over the line for a touchdown. No goal.

Representatives from the fa~ulties of five of the principle colleges in central New York met in Syracuse on Wednesday, Oct. 7, and a per- rnanent organization was form<ed. union was represented by Prof. Patterson. The others present were Profs. W. R. Terret and W. H. Squires of Hatnilton, W. P. Durfee of Hobrt:rt, Frank Sn1alley of Syracuse, W. H. Crawshaw of Colgate, and George M. Forbes of Rochester. At r 2 :30 P. M. Prof. T'erret called the meeting to order: Prof. Frank Smalley of Syracuse was made chairman and Prof. Durfee of Hobart' secretary. President Stryker of Hamilton had issued the call for the tneeting in order to reorganize college athletics. With this end in view an hour was spent in discussing the relation of college athletics to college life, what ratio sports and study should bear to each other and what restriction would be best to make athletics a success. Prof. Patterson of Union, Prof. Smalley of Syracuse and Prof. Terret of Hamilton had made a thorough study of college athletics and they spoke of the results of investigations as to the rnethods in various other colleges in the country. Resolutions were formulated that will be sub- mitted to the f~culties of the several colleges and universities for adoption, as follows : Resolved, That no student shall be allowed to play on any team which represents his \College who is not a bona fide student of that institution. A bona fide student is one who is in full stand- ing, pursuing a regular course leading to a de- gree, or is taking at least fifteen hours a week. No student shall be con~idered in full standing who has more than two conditions. No student shall be allowed to represent in athletic contests any college or university who shall directly or inditectly receive any pecuniat-y consideration for that purpose. A permanent organization was formed with Prof. Frank Smalley as president and Prof. Durfee, sectetary. A call will be issued by Secretary Durfee for a convention of the six colleges to form an organization which shall hold contests in base ball, foot ball, track ath- letics, tennis and any other college sports. Each college will be represented by one metnher of the faculty, one undergt~aduate student and one alun1nus. This convention will be held within two months at a time and place to be named by I the secretary of the faculty organization. 8op~omor~s vs. 8eQiors. The first of the series of class foot ball games was played on the campus Wednesday afternoon between the Sophomores and Seniors. It was the most closely contested gatne that has taken place on the campus for some thne. Class spirit was at fever heat and men on the side lines were kept in a state of excitement from the titne the game was called until the end, as neither team was able to score. Fifteen minute halves were played. Prof. Bennett and Dr. Linhart acted as referee and umpire. Cooper and Pearse did the best playing for the Seniors, and Wiley, Sylvester and Beards- ley did excellent work for the Sophomores. The line up was as follows: SOPHOMOR.ES, 0. POSITIONS. SENIORS, 0.

.~· . '· _:,··, THE CONCORDIENSIS. 3 ft fl\. ~. v~. fl. p. I. The fool ball season was .opened at Ridgefield last Saturday by a closely contested gatne be- tween the R. P. L of Troy and the Medical 'College tearn. The attendance was rather light but a large crowd of enthusiastic students were present and by their cheeting encouraged the p~ayers to put forth their best efforts. Tbe Medicals have had great difficulty in ob- tainin.g practic'€, as the faculty insist upon their attendance at all lectures and have refused to al:lovv any extra time for practice. Their lack . of team work was quite evident, although con- sidering their limited practice their gatne was very creditable. The visitors have had better training but with the exception of Capt. R'anney showed none of the brilliant individual playing of Capt. ,Griswold, Mack and Delehanty. Capt. Griswold won the toss and chose the kick off'. Delehanty punted for 40 yards, Ran- ney securing the ball and carrying it I 2 yards befot·e being downed. Rensselaer by repeated gains advanced the ball 15 yards mo1·e when they lost it on downs. Here the ball changed hands several times without any material gains. At this point in the game Delehanty was in- jured and replaced by Coleman. R. P. I. got the ball and gradually forced it to the Medics 10 yard line. Here the boys took a brace and gained the ball on four downs. They received :five yards for offside play and thea Griswold and Callanan advanced the ball to the 25 yard line when thne was calle9. ln the second half Jan sen returned R. P. I.'s kick off', but by some good runs the ball was brought back to the Medics 8 yard line. Hold- ing hard the Medicals gained the ball and realizing that if they were to score they must do so at once their play quickened and they plunged through the R. P. I. line for 5 and 8 yard gains until time was called with the ball in the center of the field, neither side having scored. The line up follows. A.M. 0. POSITIONS. R. P. I.

Since the above described game the Medical College teatn has been disbanded, as they could not find the time for sufficient practice to pre- pare them for the schedule of games which had been arranged. Y. Jn. ~. JL J'iotes. The Rev. J. C. Knox of Rotterdam, a grad- uate of Union College, preached in the College Chapel last Sunday afternoon. He chose for his tf.!xt, \'Ye must wod{. the works of God while it is day, for the night co1neth when no rnan can work.\ The religious service on Sunday, Oct. 4, was conducted by Mr. Fred S. Goodrnan, state sec- retary of New York. Mr. Goodman said that he would attempt to answer the question; ''Why should every Christian student in Union College join the Young M·en's Christian Association,\ and in short talk set forth a clear argument in proof of his point. Mr. Goodtnan spoke in the First Presbyterian Church on Sunday evening. The regular Y. M. C. A. prayer meetings are held in theY. M. C. A. rootns every Tues- day evening frorn 7 until 7 :45.

THE question is asked: Why don't the Union College foot ball team win some garnes ?\ It is very easy to answer this question and in doing so we address ourselves direc~ly to the questioner. The reason is, because you don't come out on the foot ball field every afternoon and help to form a good strong \scrub\ to oppose the \varsity.\ Nothing but the hardest kind of practice will over- come those little points of imperfection which makes a team of good players unreliable at the critical moinent. Class garnes are a good thing if they are re- garded in their proper light. Mr. Starin did not present to the college the cup, which is known as ·the Starin Cup, for the purpose of fostering a strong class spirit. It was given because it was thought that it would be a means of bringing out a ''scrub\ and possibly of developing some new material. The primary object was for the benefit of the ·\varsity\ and every man who plays on a class. tearn and who does not play on the \scrub'' is not doing. that which is for the best interests of this branch of athletics. EVERY coHege student should be able on leaving the halls of Old Union to express him'Se~lf clearly and forcibly upon his feet. The art of extempo- raneous .speaking and argumentative debate is not alone useful but absolutely necessary in all the professions. It is as important for a physician or business man to be able to make a clear :and con- cise statement of an issue as for the lawyer or preacher.-· ·CONCORDIENSIS of Oct. 7. NEW YoRK, Oct .. 9, '96. THE CoNCORDIENSIS, Box. 213, Schenectady, N.Y. MESSRS. EDITORS: Your No. 3 of October 7th, is received. Its first p~ragraph of nine lines pleases me decidedly. The three points included in it are ·Correct and are well stated. Whatever may conflict with tll~ realization of the first point should be removed. if practicable. The item in '' class notes\ as to the appointment by the Junior's of '' a committee to draw up resolutions protesting against debating'' is a surprise, and suggests that there ntust be some obstruction in the way of excessive demands upon the time and endurance of the students. If it be really so, then it becomes a question of th~ survival of the fittest. If it be in the curri~ulum, it is unfortunate, for it is presumable that those who are responsible for that, performed the duty with all possible care and circumspection, includ- ing due regard for the importance of this very matter of debating. I hope the report of the committee will appear in the next issue of THE CoNCORDIENSIS, that the reason for the protest be known. Unless there is a substantial rf\ason, the proposed protest would seem to be unwise. As well might men needing food p1·otest against meats, or men learning to swim against a bath, or rnf\n needing exercise, against a proper gymnastic training, or open air locomotion. If it be a choice between the time required for practice in the banjo club, for instance, or any other pastime, and that necessary for a due prepa- ration for a debate, it ought not to require ·much deliberation to determine which should yield to the other. Illustrations are continually being. foi~ced upon the public attention, and some very conspicuous ones lately, of the great ad vantage enjoyed by those who are able ''to express themselves early and forcibly upon their feet.\ It is indeed, in these days, an \absolutely necessary 1 ' accomplish· ment to all who would aspire to ·a successful career in almost any life calling. S lJBSCRIBER .. The above letter calls for no editorial criticism. It is an .able exposition of a most important branch of education. It is the expressed opinion of one, to whom experience in a practical business life, has taught the value of free and easy speech'. l' ·:' ' ' ' . ' . . I. ! ' ' I '

N,ever in the history of the institution has tennis commanded such interest and brought fourth so much enthusiasm as was manifested during the past week at the college courts. Up\\·ards of 24 rnen entered in the singles. The handicaps being very liberal, kept the scratch tnen busy overcoming the big odds of the limit men. Much new material was brought out and should be developed. It is proposed to hold another tournament in May, to select a man to represent ''Union'' at the intercollegiate tourna- ment at Ne-w Haven, in October. In the singles it was necessary to play a prelitninary round. After the second round the contestants were narrowed down to C. Stewart, 1900, scratch, W. A. Ca1npbell, '97, scratch, D. L. Wood, '97, (owed 40), E. S. Pildain, '97, (owed 15). Catnpbell defeated Stewart, and Pildain defeated Wood. The finals were played off Saturday morning, and after a very exciting match, Can1pbell '97, succeeded in defeating Pildain, '97, 6-2, 6-z, 6-2. 'I:'his gives the championship to W. A.

The first two college associations were founded at the University of Virginia and the University of Mi·chigan, in the year 1858. During the next twenty years about 25 associations were formed in the United States and Canada. These however, were entirely independent, and it was not until 1877 that the students representing twenty-one colleges met at Louisville and organ- ized an intercollegiate department of inter- national work. The following table will indicate the progress of the work~ Q In 1877 26 associations, I ,300 members. \ 1882 174 '' 8,5oo '' '' 1887 258 \ 5 '' 13, 00 \ r892 410 '' 27,000 \ '' I895 475 \ 30,000 \ The tnovement is represented in not only the United States and Canada, but also in Japan, China, India, Chili and many other parts of the earth, making the moven1ent more extensive in its scope than any other college organization. Out of the numerous achievements of the move- tnent, we note that over 30,000 men have been won for Jesus Christ through its influence, that between ten and fifteen thousand men are en- gaged in Association Bible study, that over 34,000 men have given their lives to the Christ- ian ministry, and that the movement has united into one great brotherhood, the most powerful that the world has ever known, the Christian , College Men of the United States and Canada. The \..,. oung Men's Christian Association has the three-fold object of-- I. Helping to unite the Christian men of the college world. 2. Establishing and promoting the religion of Christ in the lives of college tnen. 3· Equipping and sending leadet·s forth to extend the Kingdotn of God throughout the earth. It is well for us as metnbers of the Young Men's Christian Association to remember that we are not an independent organization, but rather a unit in a great brotherhood, whose in- fluence extends through every college of itn- portance in our country, JlH]ior promeQade. About this time every year the students begin to think of their social pleasures and yearn for a dance. To tneet this want the Junior class has always held a series of hops, hut this year it has been decided instead to hold a prnm:enade · on N overnber 20, in the Van Curler. These college dances are atnong the most enjoyable events of the year and well deserve the generous , patronage which they always receive from the students and the society people of Schenectady and neigh boring cities. The comrnittee in charge of the '' Protn.\ is as follows: P. Bertrau1 Yates, ~ig-ma Phi ; Charles Parsons, Kappa Alpha ; Fred W. Hild, Delta Phi; Ralph Bradford, Chi Psi; Charles J. Vroon1an~ Psi Upsilon; Perley P. Sheehan, Alpha Delta Phi; Harvey J. Hover, Delta Up- , silon ; Allen Andrews, Beta Theta Pi ; Francis E. Cullen, Phi Delta Theta; Walter N. Swann, Phi Gan1n1a Delta; and Donald J. Hutton, Delta Kappa Epsilon. The committee has held ' its preliminary meetings and the sub-con1mittees have been appointed to arrange the detai~s of the affair, which they promise wtll be perfect in every particular. Obituary. Hugh W. McClellan died at his home in Chatham, Columbia County, N.Y., on. Sunday afternoon, Oct. I I, of heart difficulty. He was horn in Schodack, Rensselaer County, Dec. 2, I 82o, of distinguished ancestry. Mr. McClellan · was graduated from Union College in the class of 1839 and in 1842 he was admit1ed to the bar. He was in active practice until 1856 when he retnoved to Albany. Ten years later he returned to Chatham and about a year after was elected county judge and surrogate for four years and· then re-elected for a term of six years. He represented Columbia County in the assembly at the last session and at the time of. his death was the Democratic candidate for congress frotn the nineteenth district. ' I I . I , . ! .. ·

'The Laureate team was weak from the loss of . Phil Draper, the fa1nous back, and the game sho-wed that Union h~d developed better team play than V\rhen defeated by the Laureates two weeks ago. Every inch of ground was fiercely contested and in the first half ne·ither side was able to score. But the Trojans were heavier and their strength told in the second half when they forced the Union team down the field for the one touchdown of the game. Hoxie kicked off for Union in the first half ', and the hall was held on the 20 yard line. Neither s.ide gained any great advantage ov.er the other and the ball repeatedly changed from Union to Laureate or from Laureate to Union on four downs. Union pushed the ball as far a:s Laureates 5 yard line, but lost it on downs. Laureate then 1·egained her lost territory and had carried the ball to th€ .middle of the field when time was called. In. the second half Laureate kicked the ball to Union's 25 yard line. Union returned the ball for 15 yards. Laureate then gained pos&ession of the ball and kept it in Union's territory during the half. Laureate played through the center and around the ends. Laureate futnbled the ball on Union's 5 yard line and Stnith fell on it for the college tea1n. The ball was returned on account of alleged interference. U p.ion gained the ball on four downs but lost it again. After two downs Laureate forced Aldrich over the line for a touchdown. Sleicher kicked goal. For two minutes more the ga1ne continued with the ball in the center of the field. The teams lined up as follows : Sulnm.ar'y: UNION, 0. POSITIONS. LAUREATE, 6.

A large number of enthusiastic Republicans occupied the chapel on Monday afternoon to listen to the reports of committees and officers upon the work done thus far in the inte:rests of sound money by the League of College Re- publican Clubs. Chainnan Bond of the New York division of ·college clubs will send a prominent speaker to make an address before the club prior to election. By a thorough can- vass of the classes the following results were announced: There are 34 Republicans in the Senior class, 8 Democrats, 2 Prohibitionists and I Indepen- dent. J uniors-36 Republicans, I 5 Democrats and 2 Prohibitionists. Sophotnore-44 Republicans, 8~ Detnocrats and 2 undecided. Freshmen-41 Republic~ns, 13 Democrats, 3 Prohibitionists and 3 Independents. The results of this canvass and the good will of the Republicans of the college will be com- municated to WilliainM.ci<.inley,Jr., Republican nominee for President. The club eiected Paul Canfield, '97, treasurer, and Frank McMillan, '98, vice-president, who will succeed to the office of president of the club in the fall of '97 · The following cotntnittee was appointed to consult with the county con1mittees regarding the payment of the railroad expenses of those students who return to their hon1es to vote, Canfield, '97, Utter, '98, Vander Veer, ;99, and Tinning, 1900. Prof. Stoller officiated at chapel exercises last week during the absence of the president and dean.

BURROWs, PRINTER AND BINDER, SCHEN,ECTADY, N.Y. DR. R.AYMOND has finally decided that Union shall have no foot ball garne on Thanksgiving Day. The president's decision is irrevocable and in all probability eternal so far as Union is concerned. It is indeed high time that a change should be in- stituted. The old fashioned Tbanksgiving·dinner has of late years been postpon,ed to such a late hour, that dyspepsia and nightmare .have greatly increased. The price of turkeys, they say, has fallen materially, an on account of the great Thanksgiving foo.t hall gaines. But far worse, hundreds of people have of late years forgotten the Thanksgiving service which for over a ·century has heen held .at 11 o'clock. They have hurried away to be in time to see the game. The effect on the players the·mselves ha;s been demoralizing. They have become man eaters instead of turkey eaters as in the good old days. It is no _use to argue that Thanl{sgiving day is not a day of Divine appointment. Time honored custom con- dem.ns it .. And our puritan. ·ancesters, w·hy have they not risen in their graves at such a sacrilege? You may do as you wish Y:aJ:e, Harvard, Prince- ton. Pensylvania, Cornell, and . a few hundred others, but Union declares against it. No rnore foot ball for us. We prefer the turkey and cran- berry sauce which our grandmother knows so well how to prepare to the heathenish foot ball games ·of these modern times. \ THE action of the faculty in sending Prof. Pat- terson to Syracuse two weeks ago to represent Union in a movement among the colleges of this state for the purpose of purifying college athletics has raised the question among the students as to whether or not it is advisable for this ·college to again ally itself wWh other institutions and revive the old New York State Athletic Association. It may be well to state here that the meeting which was reported in the lastOONCORDIE'NSIS was purely a mov·emement of the faculties of the several colleges, and in no way does it bind the students as to what colleges they shall compete with in the future. In other words, there was no attem,pt to form a league as it has heretofore existed. By carefully feeling the student pulse in regard ta suc\b a revival, the OONCORDIENSIS is pr.epa:r.ed to say positively that as far as the students are aoncerned, there is not the slightest desiTe to unite with other colleges of this state in any athletic league or association. Some of the older students are very much opposed to it at present. They too well remember t1te treatment they received by tbe former association at its convention held in the spring of ''95. There are other reasons equally as important why UBion ·should not at present unite with any New York State .Athletic Associa- tion. A few years may serv~ to soft en the rernem- brances of recent years, and when the last class graduates from Union which was here wh~n the old leagne was in existence, then. and not until then, should the proposition be entertained. WHERE is the remedv? ol For nearly four weeks THE CoNCORDIENSIS has been patiently awaiting an opportunity to record a victory for the Union Foot Ball ·T'eam. Fate, however, seen1·s to be against the Union players. They say, 'everybo,dy says. that U nio.n, .so far as foot ball goes, has played the better games. We know it, but what we '\JVant is the score. Without the score there is no victory. It may he well to extend our observations ~to the other branches of college athletics. The new regitne as regards eligi:hility to any .athl.e.tic team, is in full force~ and frotn recent action of the Athletic Board we believe that there will be no devjating fron1 the course laid out last spring . The new requirements do not appear to be over severe. They should not have paralyzed every branch of our college athletics. Such, however, seems to have been the effect so far. Last spring, base ball flatted out completely. Track athletics wete but little better. This season an eatne·st effort has been n1ade to revi-ve the college spirit whi~h in times past was !'

A mass meeting of the students was rJ:eld tast week to take action with 1:egard to the con- tinuan.ce or abolition of the foot ball tean1. After hearing the facts from Capt. Griswold· it was deemed wise to disband~ The faculty, although itnportuned very frequently, to allow an hour each day which might b.e used for practice, flatly refused to ,do so, and the result was that the rnetnhers of the team had to cut their le.ctures in order to practice. So1ne were unwilling to do this and other.received notice that they were in danger of losing their stan:ding ii'l their classes. So the only alternative seen1ed to be to give up the idea of a Medical foot ball team and if the \fiends\ were to play at all to p1ay with the Varsity at Schenectady .. This Capt. Griswold has been doing for the past week. The Freshn1en have fortned a quiz class in Anato1ny and tneet in the Atnpitheatre every Saturday selecting quiz masters from the class. :Per so Qals ..

The Conc,ord iensis. VoL. XX. UNION COLLEGE, OCTOBER 2·8, 1896. No.6. In 1mediately following the . chapel exercises last Tuesday tnorning, Dr. Rayn1ond gave an interesting description of the sesquicentennial exercises of Ptinceton which he attended last week. In the course of his retnarks, Dr. Raytnond said that when he visited Princeton in his undergraduate daJS, she was far inferior to Union. Her buildings were fewer and s1naller and she was lacking in equipn1ent. But within the last score of years she has risen to a position of enviable etninence. Dr. Raytnond asked a ntan well acquainted with her history what he deen1ed to be the prime factor in this unpre- cedented growth of an institution. The reply was, '' Suprem,e devotion to Princeton in pre- b d - \ ference to any other rnan or o y ot men. At this celebration for the first thne in the history of Arneri'ca., the holders of honorary de- grees \Vore hoods significant of them. The closing exercises of the celebration were held Thursday rq_orning, at which titne the natne of the institution was formally changed frotn H The College of New Jersey\ to \Princeton University.\ In the procession irntnediately preceeding the exercises, Dr. Raymond, presi- dent of Union University, walked with Dr. Carter, president of Williams College, and it is a particularly interesting fact, that the fonner wore a hood significant of the degree which had been conferred upon him by Williams College while the latter wore a hood significant of the degree conferred upon hitn by Union U ni- versity. Dr. Raytnond further stated that what was necessary for the future prosperity of Union is the ernest co-operation of the trustees, faculty, alumni and students. If we can get one 1nan to put a few thousand dollars in brick and lnortar on this, the n1ost beautiful campus in Atnerica, [applause J others will follow his example. The students tnust cease criticising and praise their alma 1nater. The faculty must get together, work together and pull together. 1'he president closed with a feV\r remarks about athletics and the present library system. Some necessary changes will be made in the athletic system at the next meeting of the athletic board. The faculty have devised a new plan for the management of the college library, but deem it wise not to make it known until the students have tnade their suggestions. A n1eeting was then held at which the chair- man, Frey, '97, was empowered to appoint a con1.mittee consisting of two frotn each of the upper classes and one fron1. each of the lower classes to confer with the library comtnittee of the faculty concerning changes in the library tnanagetnent. Y. fn. ~. fL tfotes. The Rev. Dr. H. Graham of the State Street Methodist Church spoke in the chapel Sunday afternoon. Dr. Grahatn chose as the subject of his talk Prov. 8 : I 7 : I ( wisdotn) love them that love rne; and those that seek me early shall find me. He said that the Hebrew word for wisdon1 in the original is the big word in Hebrew Religion and Philosophy, and that it includes all that is good for a man to attain, and that it included a good education, good morals and a good religion. In reply to the question, \How are we to get wisdotn?\ Dr. Graham quoted the latter part of the verse and sai~, that if he could get the young 1nen to realize to some extent the importance of seeking .religious ttuth as well as education while in college, he would have accomplished a great deal. The Bible classes will meet for organization this week preparatory for the work of the year. We are pleased to notice an increased interest and attendance at the prayer meetings this year. We believe that .God's hand is with the Y. M. C. A. and especially our own association.

Wednesday, Oct. 21, a still alarn1 called part of the fire department to the p r L1 house on college hill, where a stnall blaze in one of the upper sleeping rooms was quickly extinguished. It seems that as early as ten o'clock in the morning, the housekeeper noticed smoke issuing frotn cracks about the window casings in the parlor and room directly above. Prof. Land- reth was called in, and promptly tnade a thorough seatch, but was unable to discover the origin of the fire. As the stnoke had ceased to appear he ascribed the cause to be a newly started fire in the furnace. He left positive in- structions to be called if the smoke was again noticed. At one o'clock, just as the Phi Gam's were sitting down to dinner, one of the fellows was sent up stairs to see if there were any more signs of s·moke. As he entered the upper .rootn he found that it was filled with stnoke, and he quickly informed the <?ther fellows. R. D. Fuller, '97, then rode down to Hartley's anfl· telephoned to Van Vranken Hose, which re- sponded promptly. The firemen, after cutting holes in the wood work, both of the parlor and room above, found that the fire was ·caused by a defective grate in the latter roon1. A streatn of water was then thrown between the partitions and the fire was quickly extinguished. The only damage done was the soaking of the ceiling and floors with water. All the furniture had been retnoved before the arrival of the firetnen . . The estirnated loss is about $Ioo which is covered by insurance. The foot ball team met with defeat Saturday at the hands of the West Point Cadets at West Point. Union is not in the same class as West Point and the defeat was ap.ticipated, but the score against the team was so large as to be disheartening. West Point scored a touchdown directly the game opened and held the ball nearly all the first half, scoring 28 points. Union tnade sotne good plays around the ends but was unable to gain very much. In the second half Connor ran sixty yards and made a touchdown. Sixteen points were scored in the second half. The line up and sun1mary are as follows : WEST POINT, 44. POSITIONS. UNION, 0.

THE CONCORDIENSIS bas received a number of letters which endeavor to answer the question that headed an editorial which appeared in the last issue of this paper. Lack of space forbids us · to print all of thern in this issue. We have, how- ever, selected two which are I'epresentative. Such editorial criticism as we have ventured to make upon tl1em was prompted by the letters them- selves. SCHENECTADY, N. Y., October 23, '96. THE CONCORDIENSIS:- In reply to the question: ''Where is the rmnedy?\ which beaded an editorial that appeared in the last OONCORDIENSIS, I would say, that you have lost sight of the main point in the athletic con- troversy. You are complaining of the re1nedy which the faculty has instituted for the improve- ment of far greater ills than that of an unsuccess- ful foot ball team. No one relishes a dose of castor oil,· and that is what athletics at Union has recently received . Naturally there is a little re- bellion at the severity of the dose. Be patient and all will be well in a few short months. ALUMNUS. The above con1munication, while so1newhat in- direct, is not at aU ambigious. The writer, how- ever, appears to be over anxious to '' stand by \ the faculty. He either did not appreciate the spirit of the editorial which appeared last week or he must be very careless in his reading. If not, he would have noticed the sentences: \The new requirements do not appear to be over severe. They should not have paralyzed every branch of our college athletics.\ These two sentences clearry show our position in reference to the action taken by the faculty. What we ar~ looking for and what \Alumnus\ did not answer, is a reply to the question: ''Where is the l'ernedy ?\ SCHENECTADY, N. Y., Oct. 25, 1896. To the Edito1~ of The Concordiensis: SIR:- Athletics have certainly been more or less ha·mpered by the action taken by the Athletic Committee last June. It seems to rne, however, that things would not have been so bad if the gyn1nastic instructor of this college had taken an active part in the revision. Had he done so I think that we could have had base ball last spring and perhaps there would have been no misunder- standing. I always supposed the duty of a gymnastic pro- fessor was; first, the supflrvision of all the athletic interests of a college; second, the care and mana- gement of the gymnasium, its apparatus and all the subsidiary apartments; third the develope- ment of all the athletic material in the college for the benefit of the individual and the advancement of college athletics in general. I ntay be wrong in n1y conceptions. They are, however, based upon the knowledge that such a condition of things as enurnerated above exists in other colle.g-es. I would like to ask one question. Why is not Dr. Linhart chairn1an of the Athletic Boar·d . JUNIOR. THE OONCORDIENSIS is obliged to confess its in- ability to answer the question which concludes thP above letter. Perhaps so rue one who is better informed can do it for us. ~THIS is the last issue of THE CONCORDIENSIS which will be published before Novernber 3. We have restrained ourselves from taking part in the political controversy and 11ewspa.per discussion, not because we failed to appreciate its in1portance but because it did not appear to co rue within the realn1 of collegiate journalism. It appears to us as being n1ore in accordance with our position as a reflector rather than a moulder of opinion that we should point out son1e of the primary principles of Deruocratic government and urge our fellow students to the strict perforruance of them as their inost sacred duty as citizens of this republic. The grand principles of a Republican for1n of govern- ment are based upon the assumption that the rule = ( i E I c l t ~ I E 1. I c r: v d s c a '< . I: v d . 11 tl p 1-.

' · .. of the majority shall be the rule of the honest, the intellig·en t and the patriotic. We, therefore, urge every student who has reached his majority, to allow nothin:g to i.n.terfere with this Inost im- portant ·duty .of citizenship, and to cast his ballot on Tuesday next where, in his judgment of the issues .a,t stake, it will be for the best interests of the n.atien in its hour of peril. Our position as students, notwithstanding our youth .and inexperience, places upon us an added respensibiHty from ·which the ignorant and un- educated are e:xernpt. If there is any one an1ong us w.bo is indifferent to the exig.encies of the present political situation, and who so far for- sw,ears his citizenship as to neglect to take ad· vanta.ge of the recesR which has been granted us, and fails ·through sirnple neglect to cast his ballot where it shaH be counted, such a one deserves the condemnation of all loyal citizens. Mann, ex-'99, was on the h,ill last week. Fitzjames, ex-'98, is studying law at Amster- datn. • 1900 has adopted as class colors garnet and navy blue. Kli pphahn, 1900, is sick at the Ellis Hospital with typhoid fever. Bolts seemed to be in order on Friday, the day of the Athletic Meet. Mattison, '98, is confined to his room by a severe attack of quinsy. Dr. Raymond preached at the Tabernacle church in New York, Sunday, Oct: 25. Winterberg, 1900, is laid up with a sprained ankle., the result of a fall in the gymnasium. Instructor Opdyke, accompanied by Kruesi, , '98, visited Williams College last Saturday. Mr. and Mrs. Fuller of Waterford were visit- ing their son, Raytnond D. Fuller, '97, last week. Barbour, e:x-'98, was on the hill last W ednes- ?ay · He has been with a state surveying party 111 the Adirondacks all summer. At a meeting of the Freshrnan class held in the chemical laboratory, Oct. 16, F. M. Davis was elected track athletic tnanager. ~resident Frey of the Senior class has ap- pointed as the Senior ball committee, Williatn A. Johnston, Frank Little and Jatnes Wingate. The faculty has granted the request of the students for a bolt on the Monday before election, but has refused to grant one for the Wednesday following. Harri\s L .. Cooke, '94, of Cooperstown, was the guest of college friends last week. I-Iild, '98, was one of the starters in the zo- mile road· race under the auspices of the Mo- hawk wheeltnen Saturday, Oct. 24, but on the second n1ile his rear tire was punctured and he was forced to withdraw.
