The occasion \Vas such that, both from the nature of it and from the character ot those present, one was -led to suppose that everybody had a feeling of respect for everybody else ; at all events for the speaker. But during the. first ten minutes of the speech every rule of respect and decent courtesy was disregarded by a certain element present and some demonstra- tions continued for a longer tirne.
