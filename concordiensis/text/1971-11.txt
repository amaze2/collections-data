But because of uncertainties the comm1ss1on issued two growth studies: 1. Based on past growth rates, it predicts enrollment will hit 13.5 million by 1980 and. climb to 17.4 million by the year 2000. 2. Noting changes in the labor market for college degree holders and a reduced birth rate, it says enrollment may 'reach only 16 million by the turn of the century with 12.5 million by 1980. Dr. Clark Kerr,- commission chairman, explained to a news conference the current enrollment of 8.1 million would rise sharply in the 1970's, shrink a little in the 1980's, and then increase heavily again in the final decade of the 20th century. The commission described this as a go-stop-go cycle, and expressed concer'n for the expected slowdown or decline in the 1980s. \That decade may present.

The live band and free beer were enjoyed by all in the newly refurnished lounge, located in Davidson's lobby. With most of the furniture tetumed, the party was the ideal way of reminding students of the purpose of a dormitory lounge, and should also help to discourage confiscation of the chairs, tables and sofas in the future. Parties such as the one held last Friday night highlight the importance and the value of having a lQtinge in a dormitory and increase the genera~ awareness of a \oommunal feeling'\ among donn inhabitants, something that has been absent (at least in Davidson) since the 1969 World Series. - While, perhaps, it was not as glamorous as Richmond's Third Floor cocktail party last year, the Davidson thing was one good way of finding out who lives in the dorm, and a convenient source of rest and relaxation. The event pointed rather strongly however, to the increasing need for a Student Center where parties such as this one might be held with the benefit of better facilities and atmosphere. However, for the time being, the next time there is a ·lounge party, bring a guest and a glass and just pretend you're in Carnegie ... independents can have fun, too. :...:;; Records! 8 Track Tapes!

Hunger Preuails, Bangia Desh lioes by MURRAY GROSSMAN Israel is currently facing a series of internal problems which will assume greater proportions should genuine .peace be reached in the Middle East, Amos Elon, an Israeli journalist charged in a speech here Tuesday. Elon, addressing an audience of .200 students and members of the local community gathered in SS016, discussed the problems brewing within Israeli society. According to Elon, author of The Israelis: Founders and Sons, the ethnic, economic, political, environmental and religious problems now facing Israelis come as a great shock to world observers, due to a stereotyped image of Israel as being a Utopian society, united in its effort against the Arabs. The fact is, he asserted, there are differences among Israelis, and they can be potentially dangerons.

Despite the fact that he called Israel one of the world's most egalitarian societies, he cited \pockets of poverty and pockets of wealth\ caused by the \natural affinities among members of different groups.\ There exists, Elon said, a polarity between the Eastern European Jews in Israel, and those who migrated to fsrael from the Orient. This situation, he charged, is an effect of israel;s nature as an \immigration society\ which produces the egalitarian qualities as well as the ethnic affinities. · The second problem cited by Elon was political. He noted a \political hardening of the arteries which comes with age\ as · being characteristic in the Israeli parliament. This symbolizes the lack of vitality possessed by the Zionist movement of the early 1950's. While the Zionists feared that Israel would become just another country, lacking the distinction of being \the Jewish State,\ the current political scene envelops many factions, each with its own goals for the State of Israel. The religious situation in Israel is another source of internal unrest, said Elon. He cited the fact that interreligious marriages are not performed by the state as a \violation of civil liberties.\ How!;!ver, the fact is that the religious problem also holds political implications for the varwus religious groups are represented in political p~rtie~. The primary source of tens10n ts between the Hasidic (traditional} and the less \religious\ Jewish groups. Asserting that Israel must now be accepted as an industrial nation, Elon discussed the serious environmental crises she must now face, including pollution of the water. ~eaches and air. Hand-in-hand With the industrial development, said Elon, has been the maturity Israel has attained in terms of its self-image and self-assurance. According to Elon, however, the true indication of contemporary Israeli thought is not found among the politicians or the military officials. He described an acute sense of tragedy shared by the young Israeli writers and poets and minimized the accuracy of the world image of the alleged military pride of the Israeli people. The sense of tragedy, he said, is the true reaction to the stx-day war of 1967, and the \true tenure of the country evades the political scientist.\ Elon concluded by answering critics who charge that the internal pressures will ~:!ar lsrael apart once peace comes to .the Middle East by optimistically predicting that the proBlems can certainly be overcome. \W~ile there is bigotry and antagonism between the social forces, there is no discrimination,\ he said. could very easily starve). 3.

Continued from Page I cause a religious eruption m Hindu India. The Indian government is, however, covertly supporting Bangia Desh. They are providing military aid, and the troop presence on the border is tying up Punjabi (West Pakistanis) · ; ·troops who would otherwise be hunting down the liberation forces. The liberation movement is alive and well in Bangia Desh, according to Mr. Di wan, although the press accounts in the United States are negligible. There were bombings in Dacca three days ago. He predicts victory for the liber; tion forces within six months. In addition, there is increasing widespread support in West Pakistan for Bangia Desh. There are, however, two governments supporting the reactionary Punjabis - the United States and China. Although ten other capitalist governments in the consortium agreed to support Pakistan economically, they have halted their support due to the present conflict. The United States perseveres. China, on the other hand, is playing power- politics and stabbing their Naxalite supporters in the back. Other factors are that the supply lines for supporting troops in Bangia Desh are too long, the Punjabis do not speak the language, they do not know the territory, and a tall Punjabi is easily distinguishable from the short Bangali. All in all, even without overwhelming Union College interest Bangia Desh does persevere. Fatalistically. The Chinese attitude to this whole area of the world is very interesting and revealing. In the part of Bengal which remained in India after the 1947 colonial partition, there are a number of political factions fighting for control. Most of these are socialist-anarchist groups, although the area is being governed by a socialist bureaucracy. The most powerful of these was the Naxalite faction, a Maoist-oriented revolutionary group. In India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Iran, and the Far East, the word \Mao\ was synonymous with revolution. But with the People's Republic's backing of the Ceylonese government versus the Naxalites there, the Bengalese Naxalites' prestige, respect, and power in the area began to ebb. Now with the Chinese support of Punjabi West Pakistan, the Naxalites are non-existent. Mao no longer signifies revolution with a popular connotation. One might compare China's politics with those of Stalin in his treatment of Mao in 1927. At that time, Mao was urged to unite his relatively small band with the Kuomintang. With Stalin's aid, however, the Kuomintang and Chiang veritably killed off all the Socialists in a huge purge. Your one dollar will keep a refugee alive for 30 days, but barely alive on about a handful of rice each day. (Keep giving money though don't let yourself play God and decide that death is better than life - let them decide not to eat if they want to.) One thing often forgotten, in the face of so many political dilemmas, is the feeling of the Bengalis. According to Galbraith in last Sunday's New York Times, there aren't very many men in the refugee camps. They ate all fighting within and for Bangia Desh. The quest for liberation does continue, both strongly and emotionally. Their homes, which they have chosen. are at stake. A majority of refugees in India ptesently will return once the West Pakistanis have left. Those who remain in India will find life hard, due to the absence of jobs and land, and due to religious conflicts. The Indian government, contrary to official reports, is making plans for absorbing some of the refugees. In the four Indian states where most of the refugees now are, life is exceedingly hard for all. In the remaining states, there bas only been a slight increase in taxation. No one knows what will happen in the future. Mr. Diwan's feelings were fatalistic. He was fairly positive on the prospect of victory for Bangia Desh, but no one knows for sure. I would like to apologize for my slanted point of view and for the inadequacy of words which cannot truly express the situation in India and Bangia Desh, nor express my emotions.

There are. however, two governments supporting the reactionary Punjaois the United States and China. Although ten other capitalist governments in the consortium agreed to support Pakistan economically, they have ha !ted their support due to the present conflict. The United States perseveres. China, on the other hand. is playing power- politics and stahoing their \!axalite supporters in the back. Other factors are that the suppl) lines for supporting troops in Bangia Desh are too long, the Punjabis do not speak the language, they do not know the territory, and a tall Punjabi is easily distinguishable from the short Bangali. All in all. even without overwhelming Union College interest Bangia Desh does persevere. Fatalistically. The Chinese attitude to this whole area of the world is very interesting and revealing. In the part of Bengal which remained in India after the 1947 colonial partition, there are a number of political factions fighting for controL Most of these arc socialist-anarchist group~. although the area 1s being governed b) a socialist hureaucracy _ The most powerful of these was the Naxalite faction, a Maoist-oriented revolutionary group. In India. Pakistan, Ceylon. Iran. and the Far East. the word \Mao\ was synonymous with revolution. But with the People's Republic's backing of the Ceylonese government versus the Naxalites there, the Bengalese Naxalites' prestige. respect, and power in the area began to ebb. Now with the Chinese support of Punjabi West Pakistan, the Naxalites are non-existent. Mao no longer signifies revolution with a popular connotation. One might compare China's politics with those of Stalin in his treatment of Mao in 1927. At that time, Mao was urged to unite his relatively small band with the Kuomintang. With Stalin's aid, however, the Kuomintang and Chiang veritably killed off all the Socialists in a huge purge. Your one dollar will keep a refugee alive for 30 days, but barely alive on about a handful of rice each day. (Keep giving money though don't let yourself play God and decide that death is better than life - let them decide not to eat if they want to.) One thing often forgotten, in the face of so many political dilemmas, is the feeling of the Bengalis. According to Galbraith m last Sunday's New York Times, there aren't very many men in the refugee camp~. They are all fighting within and for Bangia Desh. The quest for liberation does continue, both strongly and emotionally. Their homes. which they have chosen. are at stake. A majority of refugees in India presently will return once the West Pakistanis have left. Those who remain in India will find life hard, due to the absence of jobs and land, and due to religious conflicts. The Indian government, contrary to official reports, is making plans for absorbing some of the refugees. In the four Indian states where most of the refugees now are, life is exceedingly hard for all. In the remaining states, there has only been a slight increase in taxation. No one knows what will happen in the future. Mr. Diwan's feelings were fatalistic. He was fairly positive on the prospect of victory for Bangia Desh, but no one knows for sure. I would like to apologize for my slanted point of view and for the inadequacy of words which cannot truly express the situation in India and Bangia Desh, nor express my emotions. Put yourself in their places ... \It•s rammg outside today. What'll I do now ... \ music, and contemporary dramatic composers. It gives the impression of a counterpoint to the play; that is, it both works with the play and sets off its own moods at different times. At each performance there will be a Ii ve 12-piece orchestra consisting of J.VE Soccer by FRANK DeLUCIA Disappointing bookend performances with Albany State best epitomized Union's 1971 junior varsity soccer season. The Dutchmen last Tuesday again lost to State 5-2 through a series of defensive lapses. Union led in the first quarter 1-0 behind a strong wind advantage and a well-placed kick by John Walker. But, as in football, play changes direction at the end of each quarter, and the Danes capitalized with a gusty show of their own, scoring three goals in the second period. Forward Paul Cerratto made it an interesting 3-2 ballgame with a third period score, but then SUNY A pulled away. The Garnet JV s compiled a 2-5 season mark with a comparatively young squad. To be complemented on fine performances this year are Tony O'Conner, Steve Conley, Tom Baca, Pete Citarella, and Mark Whittlesey. Commenting on the grant, President Harold C. Martin said, \It is indeed gratifying to receive a corporate gift of this size and we are grateful to the Eastman Kodak Company for sharing our faith in the quality of the academic program at Uruon.\ A major fund raising project in the college development program has been the $7 million Science- Engineering Center on the campus - which was dedicated last May and is expected to be in full use by this winter. Union was one of five private colleges and universities in the country to receive a major capital gift from Kodak this year. More than 250 educational institutions received grants this year in the company's overall program. Current Union development goals in the fund raising pmgrarn are an addition to the Schaffer Library and the renovation of an existing campus building into a long needed college center. Scholarship funds are also being sought.

The Union College Big Brother and Big Sister Program needs volunteers to work with youngsters in Schenectady who need adult guidance and adult companionship. The student is involved with the youngster on a one-to-one basis and provides the youngster with the guidance and companionship which the youngster does not usually receive at home and at school. This experience is very enlightening and rewarding for the student, but more importantly, the youngster gains immensely through this relationship.

To The Students As chainnan of the Committee on Comprehensive Education (CED Board) it is my .responsibility to present to the Committee for their consideration a suitable curriculum in Comp. Ed. for 1972-73'. I would like the stUdent body to participate actively, in the generation of new courses in Comp. Ed. for next year. Here's how to do it: I. Think .up a topic or a theme which you believe could be worked up as a Comp. Ed. course. Identify the area of the pregrartl into which your t:ourse would fit (Option in Center Il, Disputed Questions, etc.) 2. Discuss the idea with other students. Try to estimate the number of'students who would elect the course (say with a given professor or with any ,professor). Is there wide interest in such a course? 3. Select a professor who you think could and would teach the course. If in doubt, check with me at this point for .assistance. 4. Approach the \selected professor\ with your course proposal. By this time you should have expanded your initial ideas at least to outline form, including suggested text books. 5. Alternatively (to 4), come to see me with the course outline and I will approach the appropriate professor with your proposaL 6. Formal initiation of new course proposals must be made by the professor. He knows the procedure. General guidelines for Comp. Ed. courses can be found in \Comprehensive Educ;ttion- 1970\ a report on file in the library and in many professors' files. However, I would like to emphasize the fact that the Comp. Ed. Board will probably reject new courses which: (I) have little or no academic or intellectual content, or (2) are more suitable to a particular discipline than to Comp. Ed. New courses which would require major capital investment need administrative approval and should be discussed with me. This is your opportunity to contribute to curriculum development in its initial stages. There is, of course, no guarantee that the course will be ultimately taught as you envisioned it; the final form of the course depends on the professor. Finally, I would be happy to answer any questions on this matter or to discuss any ideas with you in their formative stage. H. E.

Defensive halfback Mike Goldberger is \one of the best pass defenders in the east,\ according to third-year Panther coach John Anderson, who had directed his freshmen-laden team to its first winning season in 23 years. Only seven of the 22 Garnet who started in the St. Lawrence game remain at their original positions.

Bobby Mitchell scored both touchdowns last WL:ek.

Lauver will start at quarterback, with Jerry Cuffey ready for full-time duty at end. Meanwhile, Mitchell's status is unknown after he hurt his knee in practice this week. What else is new'? Through it aU, Coach Everling has acquired a keen sense of humor. He deserves the coach of the year award. or at least a purple heart. for fielding a team each week. \We're the only school in the country that uses a split end at quarterback and a quarterback at split end,\ said he.

You are a loud mouth.\ Hartford's number 83 did just that at the conclusion of his team's hard-fought 3-2 victory last Tuesday. . Hartf?rd was certainly the best soccer team to appear on Daley Field this. year, and they proved it with their second half rally that upped their number of wins in 1971 to I 0. The .red-and-white team displayed precision pa<..sing, hustle, and aggression, an? they were the most physical team tb.:: Garnet has faced. ~n fact, their ~tyle of play - numerous trips, flying elbows, and sohd. body. ch~ckmg and pushing~ was downright dirty. The Garnet ret~hated .m kmd, and the referees had to call too many ·direct kicks, on mfractwns outside the penalty zone. It made for a sloppy, if not exciting, game. .But Hartford did. pl~y some good soccer. Their defense always c~1sply repelled Omon s second half offensive thrusts, and they discovered the Garnet's patented corner kick play. · On those kicks, co-captain Art Fraser floats the ball out in front of the far goal post, and springy fullback Sandy Wilder races into the crowd to head the ball into the net. It has worked once this year When Hartford realized this strategy, they put one defender rlght on top of ~andy on ~very Union corner kick. And Sandy repeatedly found h1mself on hts ass before the ball even reached the play in front of the net, much to the disgust of the Garnet players. Hartford's most flagrantly bad playing came on the direct kicks. The rules ~t~ted. that the defenders must be at least ten yards from the ball when 1t Is.ki~ked. The visitors, unfortunately, couldn't count too well. On .. U~wn s last desperate direct kick, with just over a minute to play m th~ game, Hartford again lined up too close to the ball and only slowly heeded the referee's calls to move. . A shouting. match between everjone on the field and a little not-so- fnendly pushmg among the players resulted. 'The refs then issued an unsportsmanlike conduct warning on the entire Hartford team but it really made no difference. ' ..

However, there must be a world police force to create these The decision was finalized last Thursday night after Allison obtained the support of President Harold C. Martin and Dean of Students Edward J. Malloy. Interviewed Monday, Allison stated that not only were the c;heerleaders \offending\ a sizable segment of the football game fans, but they were also \not serving the purpose of cheerleading.\ According to the first year Athletic Director, the function of a cheerleader is to \stir up and arouse the student body to get them behind the team on the field.\ Maintaining that the Flying Dutchmen were not doi:o.g this, Allison also cited their \questionable antics and indiscriminate use of the English language.\ \We have a responsibility to our guests and paying fans to see that they enjoy themselves as much as possible and are not offended. Our cheerleaders were ridiculing the other fans and teams to the point of embarrassment,\ said Allison. He continued that the cheerleaders were \out of bounds\ and \all through,\ in light of their performance this year. The issue has qeen a \rolling stone\ for this entire season, statecl the Athletic Director. He had spoken to the cheerleaderS at the beginning of the season and told them what he thought their purpose · was; they agreed to abide by his philosophy. But incidents at the Hobart game on October 23 led to the specific ban on the cheerleaders, when Hobart fans witnessed the cheerleaders' perfol'ntance and complained. · Until this year, the Union bench had been located on the east side of Alexander Field, in A th •t f s • t L conditions and ensure their . u . ·. orl y 0 .

But in September, Coach Gerry Everling requested that llis bench be moved to the west side, closer to the press box. Athletic Director Allison consented, and a problem arose, since fans of the visiting team who wished to sit behind their team's bench were now sitting among the Union students. At half time of the Hobart game, for which 100 seats behind the Hobart bench were reserved for Hobart spectators, two women approached Coach Allison, who described them as \alarmed and concerned.\ They asked him if he was aware of what the cheerleaders were doing - \that they were heaping so much abuse on the Hobart girl cheerleaders that the girls no:ul~Jc.nqtperform.\ -Th~ :A'11ltlfilic· Director came Cootinu~d on, Page 3 This coming Thursday, November ·H, at 8:00 p.m. in Social Science 016, the International Relations Club will sponsor a lecture by Harold J.

Author of two novels, The :BaDad of Dingus MeGee (film was made from it and is grossing % of a million dollars) and Going Down, he has, unfortunately, had bad reviews from critics. However, according to Prof. Gada, Going Down is a \rather impressive'' work following in the traditions of Faulkner and Joyce. There are also overtones in his work of the man to whom the book is dedicated, Malcolm Lowry. Lowry also is a writer not very well known. Going Down is being sold at the bookstore in a hard cover edition.

In The Dark We at Concordiensis find ourselves in a most peculiar predicament. With a large and eager photography staff, and with three competent photo editors, we are unable to print any of the pictures taken by our photographers. The simple reason is that, with all the construction, renovation and relocation going on here, we have been prevented from establishing a permanent darkroom. Our darkroom in the old Electrical Engineering Building had to be vacated when renovations began there last year. We left with assurance from Professor Richard B. Russ, Chairm<l\l of the Department of Electrical Engineering, that we ; ·ould be able to return. However, the plumbing lines were accidentally removed, rendering it useless as a darkroom. These plans were carried out without the .consent of Professor Russ, who has worked with us toward finding another location. We are currently using a darkroom in the Science Center, but were supposed to vacate last week, because a professor needs the room for his personal use. So, we are tentatively planning to move into a darkroom in Silliman Hall this week. Most importantly, however, we would like to extend our sincere thanks to Professor Russ, for his continuing efforts on our behalf, and -for his concern that this problem be quickly solved. All dog owners should be advised that their four-footed friends are no longer welcome in the Rathskeller.

In The Dark We at Concordiensis find ourselves in a most peculiar predicament. With a large and eager photography staff, and with three competent photo editors, we are unable to print any of the pictures taken by our photographers. The simple reason IS that, with all the construction, renovation and relocation going on here, we have been prevented from establishing a permanent darkroom. Our darkroom in the old Electrical Engineering Building had to be vacated when renovations began there last year. We left with assurance from Professor Richard B. Russ, Chairm'-'., of the Department of Electrical Engineering, that we ·ould be able to return. However, the plumbing lines wer~· accidentally removed, rendering it useless as a darkroom. These plans were carried out without the consent of Professor Russ, who has worked with us toward finding another location. We are currently using a darkroom in the Science Center, but were supposed to vacate last week, because a professor needs the room for his personal use. So, we are tentatively planning to move into a darkroom in Silliman Hall this week. Most importantly, however, we would like to extend our sincere thanks to Professor Russ, for his continuing efforts on our behalf, and for his concern that this problem be quickly solved. All dog owners should be advised that their four-footed friends are no longer welcome in the Rathskeller. The local health code demands that any establishment which sells or serves food be free of dogs and other small beasts. If you want to come in and play, please park your pooch outside. * * * * Winter Term student bills will be mailed approximately November 15 or 16, with payment required by December 13, 1971. The time required for processing payments in order to release registration paperwork mandates the deadline indicated since secretarial personnel have six holiday days off between the end of the Fall Term and January 2. As the Fall Term was the first time the pre-billing process was used, no late fees were charged if bills were paid by registration. A late payment fee of $10 will be assessed on all bills not paid by December 13. NO TEMPORARY LOANS WILL BE ISSUED. Students will not be permitted to register for the Winter Term unless financial obligations have been cleared. As a matter of interest, 87 percent of the students' bills had been paid by the September 3 deadline in the fall. * * * * We have a serious problem of seating for visitors and guests of the visiting team. Generally, when we are visitors at a · school we are given the entire side of the field for our fans. Next year we hope to be able to do this at Union by increasing the seating capacity on the North side (Union side) of Alexander Field. Our immediate problem, . however, is for the upcoming Hamilton game. I would very much like to turn over the twelve tier bleachers on the South side (behind Hamilton's bench) for Hamilton faculty, alumni, parents and guests. To alleviate the situation for our students, I have opened up 480 seats in the reserved (North) stands. I would very much appreciate your thoughts on this pressing matter. To tile Editor: I have submitted an application for permission to teach an introductory Italian course during the Winter term. If this application is to stand any chance ef approval by the Curricular Affairs Committee, I must demonstrate that a sufficient number of students have a genuine interest in the course. Accordingly, I ask all stl!ldents who would definitely enroll in such a course, or who would strongly consider enrolling, to leave a sheet witl!l their names, addresses, and an indication of the degree of their interest with Mrs. Werner or Mrs. Gleason (the Hl!lmanities Building secretaries) before 10:30 a.m., Wednesday, November 10. (Later submissions probably cannat be forwarded to the Committee in time.) If taught, the course will attempt to provide a rudimentary working knowledge of the language. I should stress that no advancea courses are contemplated (although students who wish to do so may elect to continue their studies at one of the Consortium school~.) Even a large response will not guarantee the Committee's approval, but it is almost certain that the proposal will be rejected or withdrawn - if the response is small. To the Editor: Sincerely, Frank Gado Letters to the Editor do have a way of getting things done. Unlike a good argument or a debate, however, they only cover one side of the issue. Robert Hertel's \Case of the Stolen Wallet\ got something done. It prompted another letter to the Editor. His letter was long. He has a We have been on a few wild goose chases around this campus before. They did have a guy there when we arrived. An accomplice Bob and his friends knew that this one did not have the wallet. Now all we have to do is scare him into goirng and getting the wallet or in to revealing someone's name. He only has 20 or 30 sympathizers standing around. The other 270 were inside. Seems also that during that 40 minute wait one of the security had gone to the Rathskeller trying to locate one or more of the \Utica Boys.\ We have to change our clothes in the Security Office before going home which we had done on the night in question. That is how come security (2) had to change hats. Somehow I think I'd rather stop a guy in the act of stealing my wallet than to let him steal it and then chase him into a group of 300 friends to retrieve it. Kind of like going into a . beehive to find the one that stung you. The townies have probably gotten the word. Doors are unlocked, cars are unlocked and if they are locked, just knock.

Page 4 CONCORD/EN SIS, November 9, J971 Concordy Sports --, \ ~--------~--------------------~~~----~~~~--~~~------------~ Garnet Gridders Stun 6-1 Middlebury 21-1-2 \ byLEAPIN David slung his shot at the mighty Goliath, and Union's paper-thin football team overcame the fat Middlebury Panthers, 21-12, in their first Vermont appearance in 20 years. Thus, the Panthers ended thei~ successJul 6-2 season on a sour note, and the Garnet upped their record to 3-5. Up for the stri.\ggle was Garnet fullback AI Albano, who gained 131 yards in 28 carries, more than half the yardage he had previously amassed this season. The Dutchmen totaled 212 yards rushing, with the big defensive effort holding the surprisingly inept Middlebury attack to 53 yards rushing in 36 carries and to 188 yards passing on a poor 15;. for-51 completion mark. ·Gary Lauver directed the Union offense, with regular quarterback Bobby Mitchell figuring only on the three · successful extra points. Lauver was one for seven passing· and had two tosses intercepted. But the Garnet did not 1 down its faithful, who occupied a large sectiqn of the otherwise.: hostile stands and were thrilled by the major upset victory. Llnebacker Tracy Rich, who ironically was to be the only Dutchman injured on the day, gave his. team the right idea. He blocked an early Panther punt giving Union possession on the Middlebury 14. After a five-yard penalty, the Dutchmen scored in five plays as from two yards out, Albano became only the si:xlh Garnet gridder to score this season. Still in the first quarter, Pete Keller picked up the cue and raced 46 yards with his interception to the Panther 43. Subsequently, Bruce Mathias went ten yards into paydirt for a comfortable 14-0 lead, and so it stood at half time. with WOODY Here it is, gang, the picture that the rest of the country has seen before it is officially released to the V\Col community. Yes, indeed, that is co-captain Gary Morris of the football team, and it's probably the last time he smiled before the end of the Middlebury game. And those pretty ladies that \man\ the training room are probably more well-known in Chicago, Baltimore, Boston, and to the readers of Sports Illustrated than they are at UCol. For your information, they are Heidi Steger, Kathy Kelley, and Julie Thalen, and the photo is an Associated Press wirephoto that was picked up by many newspapers and SI. An original story and a different photo had previously run in the Schenectady Gazette. (You didn't think a Concordy photographer took it, did you?) Now maybe more people will recognize old UCol's name when you mention it. You'll have to admit that the Garnet's reputation is minimal, so let's think about what builds a reputation. Athletics. A college whose athletic teams perform well gets loads of publicity and builds a large reputation for itself. Combine that with the exercise that athletics provides, and now you know why sports plays such an important role in college life. When some alum reads how well the old school is doing athletically, his feeling of pride grows, and he might even be willing to give a little more money (cynical, isn't it?). But that isn't happening at Union. Footb,all - the all time BIG sport - is having yet another losing season, and over the past decade, Gamet gridders have posted only two winning years. Beyond football, there is only one hope on the Union athletic scene - a scene that offers a dilapidated gym and but eleven intercollegiate sports. The hope is basketball. Two years ago, the record was 7-15, but last season, in an amazing turnabout that brought SRO crowds of 3000 to Memorial Fieldhouse, the hoopsters ran to an 18-3 record. And now Union is out to make a name for itsc> 1 f in basketball, and maybe then it will be able to compete with RPI hockey and Siena basketball for more Capital District publicity. After that, and with a little more help from Sports Illustratedt Union may become better known in collegiate athletics and then acquire a larger reputation. The Dutchmen may yet go bigtime, and a win in the ~raditional clash with Hamilton will salvage this football season. The winless Continentals have lost 7 this year and have been outscored 282-59. The Garnet will be favored, but remember that Hamilton took a 2-5 record into last year's game with a 5-3 Union team and won. Then, there's the Middlebury game last Saturday ... MiddlebtJry's only threat in the first half came on a faked field goal attempt that Mike Raab would have blocked. But the Panthers failed to pick up the first d?wn on the pl~y. Midway through the third period, Albano led Union on a 60-yard game-clinching drive with a 27 yatd run and his second touchdown from the three. especially when both two-point pass attempts failed. The key to the twelve Panther points rested with halfback Frank Cooper. He caught Pete Mackey's deflected one-yard pass for the first six, late in the third stanza. After a so .. yard reception of a Doug Cramphin aerial, Cooper agai-n scored from the one, this time on the ground in the fourth quarter. didn't have to rain, for the Garnet had nothing to lose and efficiently made a gain of it. On S!l,turd~y. Hamilton hits Daley Feild in its 76th meeting with Union. By virtue ·of its two upset wins in the 1969 and '70 finales, the winleSs Continentals hold a 33-.,30-12 edge, and that will not rest easily on Garnet minds as they prepare to kick the Continentals can. The game starts at 1:30, and it'll be your Two countering touchd·owns But no one could take this one last chance to see the walking by the Panthers were for naught, away from . the Dutchmen. It wounded work wonders. Soccer Beats SUNYA, Ties All-time Win Record by MARTY BERMAN Co-captain Paul Martini and Art Fraser combined to score the lone goal late in the third qu;:irter to give the Union College soccer team a hard-fought 1.:0 victory· over the Great Danes of· Albany State. The triumph gave this year's squad a final record of 6-3- 1, equaling the all-time Union record for number of victories in a season. The goal was scored by Martini on a breakaway with 1:26 to go in the third quarter. The junior from Winchester, Mass., ran under a high lob pass from Fraser, literally exploded past the defense with an amazing The victory over Albany marked the last game for three graduating seniors on the squad - Fraser, Dusty Richards, and Ita Turret.· Richards and Turret wiU be missed as the diminutive sparkplugs ·of the forward li~e and halfbacks respectively. Richards finished the campaign with six goals and three assists, while Turret had one goal and two assists. Not enough can be said on why Fraser will be missed, since besides being the team's offense, he was also its class. The other goal scorers for the . Dutchmen this year were Mattini with three, anq Dick Samuels, Sandy Wilder, and Bobby Bernhardt, all with one each. Bernhardt also had four assists to go with his lone marker. Looking back on the season, the Colgate upset had to be the highlight. But although the Dutchmen showed a lot of soccer skill and even a semblance of soccer savvy, they are not of the NCAA caliber quite yet, as evidenced by the losses to RPI, Middlebury, and' Hartford. One tends to believe the team will not reach post-season tournament level for at least two years, or at least untii the young defense matures and the graduating offense is replaced. burst of speed, beat the opposing H . • 2 d s goali~ to the ball heading in front ·arrlers, . n . l.n. i · tat. e. ·M·.ee-t·, of him, and then calmly rolled . . , .· . . . . . . . the ball into the empty net, · · breaking the scoreless deadlock. Be·st Season s·ln•ce 1958 It was Martini's third goal of · the campaign. The assist was Fraser's seventh of the season and fl.lls out an impressive tally sheet for the senior. Although he had only one assist in the last two games of his Union career, he still finished the 1971 campaign with nine goals and seven assists, a single season record. The Garnet was a vastly superior team, but the game was so close due to the extraordinarily great play on the part of the Great Dane goalie, William De Graff. He was by far the best goalie Union faced this year, as his diving and leaping antics repeatedly thwarted· Garnet scoring drives.· Union goalies Jim Sletteland and Paul Miller proved to be De Grofrs match, as they registered the Garnet's second shutout of the year. They received great help on defense from Olaf Neilsen and Rob Grossman, both freshmen, and of course, the sophomore sensation, Sandy Wilder. The Dutchmen also . received unexpected help from the Albany State star winger Michael Demetrios, who constantly dribbled too much and refused to pass, costing his team some possible scores and causing dissension on his squad's forward line. The wind and cold played a big factor in the game, often causing ragged play and keeping the teams far from \up for playing soccer.\ The Dutchmen seemed lackadasical through much of the afternoon, whereas they were so fired up against Hartford. by MINNER The Union College cross country team nearly shocked the cross country experts around the state Saturday but fell just 9 points short of victory. The 15 team small college State Meet, held at Frear Park's 4.63 mile course in Troy, was won by Hamilton's squad with 85 points, compared to 94 for the Garnet. Rochester finished 3rd with 128 points. Other team finishes were RPI-llth, 225 points; Alfred-13th,. 290 points; and St. Lawrence'-14th, 349 points. Ex-Garnet coach Ron Coleman's pre-race comments on Union's excellent chances to capture the meet went unheeded until the results proved him right. Union's 2nd place finish, combined with their 6-2 dual meet record, marks the best overall cross country performance since 1958. The harriers also continued the Garnet habit of placing 2nd in State Meets. The 1971 indoor track team was runner-up to Cortland last Winter, while the outdoor squad was bridesmaid to Buffalo in the spring. \I had· to be · elated,\ said rookie coach Chris Gentile, \but there was just a little bit of disappointment because we were so, so close.\ Turning in their best races of the year were John Kearney and Bryant Moeckel. A strong one- two punch all season, Kearney, placing 4th, and Moeckel, placing 5th, turned the tables on Hamilton's strong duo of Marc Peuron and Ken Judsen, who placed 6th and 9th, respectively. Kearney, timed in 25:31, and Moeckel, 25:33, were both beaten in a previous dual meet by the Hamilton teammates; Peuron was timed in 25:35, Saturday, while Judsen clocked a 25:46. Tim McCabe was third for the Garnet, placing 20th in 26;14; Dave Rice, 31st in 26:39 and Jim Johnson, 34th in 26:49, rounded out the Garnet scoring. The Dutchmen-Continental race was so close that if it had been scored as a dual meet (that is, disregarding all other runners), Hamilton would have eked out a 27-28 win. The big factor in the Hamilton win was their 5th man, Vito Stellato, in 29th place, who edged out the Garnet's 4th and 5th men, Rice and Johnson. The State Meet concluded the season for all the runners except Kearney, who will be competing individually in the IC4A's this weekend in New York City. It was a fine year for the squad, ·and next year looms favorable with only Moeckel and Rice graduating. · · Track. * * * * The Indoor Track Team will be having a meeting, Tuesday, November 16th at 4:30 in the BLOCK \U\ Room.

Senate Hears Committee Discussion Of Discipline byBARBARA McDONALD Tuesday's Senate meeting primarily dealt with the occurrences last spring with specifi:c references to the penalties delivered to those · students sentenced by the Discip!line Committee. The members of the ·Discipline . Committee of last year were invited to attend this meeting. The members who appeared were: Prof. Russ, Prof. Nelson, Mrs. Walbeck, Prof. Ludwig, ·Prof. Bristol, Bill Adams, Marty Sherman, Don Clarey, and GerrY. Hyman. .-·. · Monetary fines'; were arrived upon as a suitable penalty after careful consideration of other . alternatives. Such things a..s expulsion, probation of two kinds, general and disciplinary, and money were specifically mentioned by the members of the committee. In some cases, both a fine and a probation were levied upon the guilty individual. Alterations Announced For Selective Serv,ice The Selective SerVice System recently released a list of . significant changes in their Regulations which will affect young men facing the draft process in the future. The changes will supplement the amendments to the Selective Service Act Which were recently signed into law by the President.· The regulation changes are expected to become effective throughout the more than 4,000 local draft boards in early 'December. Prior to their effective· date, interested persons may submit their written views on the prospective Regulations to the Director of Selective Service. . One of the major ch~nges concerns 2-S student defennents. Undergraduate college stud!;!nts who were not enrolled on a full- time basis and making satisfactory progress toward a baccalaureate degree during the regular 1970-71 academic year will not qualify for 2-S deferments. The Regulations also will set similar criteria for students in junior colleges, trade and technical schools, and apprenticeship programs. .. The.. establishn).ent .of. a new . classification - 1-H - also is one of the significant items in the long list of changes. This classification will be an administrative holding category, and men in Class 1-H will have inactive files and will not be considered for induction unless they are reclassified 1-A. Beginning with the 1972 prime selection group, a 1-H cutoff number will be set and with a few exceptions, men with lottery numbers above the cutoff number will remain or be placed in Class 1-H for their period of prime exposure to the draft. A decided emphasis was placed on the fact that there was no . pressure from the administration on the members of the committees in their arrival at their decisions. However, the committee could not charge anyone. In fact, the administration brings charges a~ainst the individuals which it feels have- transgressed the rules. Many ·cases were dismissed by the committee because there was no case: no evidence, and no one willing to testify against others. The members admitted knowing .. that people they knew had participated in some way in the disturbances, but participants in the occupation had to be let free because there was no evidence presented nor was there any ·· ch~rge levied against them. Technically, they could not be ruled upon. Decisions on fines depended upon things known concerning the degree of involvement, leadership, and length of occupation. Many factors were .takl;ln jntq Q.opsid~ration .. There was no set formula fbr fines. And, most importantly, when students of the campus community consider this issue, the human element involved in making decisions must be incorporated. Evidence that was presented was very different in each case .. The whole procedure was an expensive one: at least $3,000 was the estimated cost plus 70 hours in a 7 to 10 day period for all committee members especially difficult since i the hearings were held during finals week. flexible program, including independent reading, is provided for those majors who wish to specialize in areas where there are no course offerings. Penal System Dis.cussed By The new Regulations also will establish time limits for personal appearances. Each registrant will be entitled to such time for his personal appearance with his local board as is reasonably necessary for a fair presentation of his claim. Normally, 15 Minutes will be deemed adequate for this purpose. He also will be allowed to bring up to three witnesses to the meeting. The same criteria will pertain to a registrant who elects to meet with his appeal board, except that he will not have the right to bring witnesses. The Senate thanks the members of the committee for spending time to discuss th•e actions taken last spring. An interesting question raised 1s what it will mean to the future. Presently majors are required to take three courses above the basic or 12 level in Russian or Chinese. The department may be re-evaluating the number of language courses required, · according to Associate Professor Robert Sharlet, director of the program. Professor Sharlet assumed the directorship of the program from Associate Professor Charles Gati, now on leave at Columbia University. Professor Gati was the prime mover behind the Comparative Communist Studies program, which was formally launched in the Fall of 1970. The program was designed to shift the emphasis from area studies to comparing communist countries to see ctqss-national pattetns. Drawing together members of the Political Science, History and · Modern Language departments, Professor Gati was able to form the department and the courses in the curriculum. Currently there are seven faculty members in the department. Within the coUege there are nine students majoring in Comparative Communist Berman ln Lecture Here Last night, ifarold T. Berman, Profess~r of Law at Harvard, discussed mechanisms of Soviet Law, in a lecture sponsored by the International Relations Club. Acknowledged as an expert in this field, Berman gave a very detailed picture of the Soviet judicial system and related several anecdotes from his own experiences in Russia in 1961-62. The central theme of his discourse was the 'educational role of Soviet Law. He pointed out that in the Soviet Union, tJ:o-e burden of deciding innocence or guilt, as well as of passing sentence is placed on the jury. In the past 50 years, though, there has been a trend toward the more active role of the judge in determining the outcome of legal proceedings. In this system, the criminal is stripped of rationalization in order to transform his guilt into shame. Here, Berman · mentioned, one sees the roles of parent and child in the system. In this respect, the Soviet courts go to great lengths to drive home the social and moral implications of the case. As a former president of the Soviet Supreme Court remarked, the most important function of the Soviet Court is \the fundamental remaking of the conscience of the people.\ There are several differences between the Soviet system and our own, Berman explained. The most important of these is the \comrade's court,\ an informal tribunal of the accused's peers, friends, and neighbors that issues warnings, reprimands and fines. Also about one-third of the tribunal of the judges are women, in comparison to the male dominance in United States' Courts. The winner of last issue's Guess Who contest, Peter R. Brayton, . '72, correctly identified Miss Mary EUzabetb Wemple, in a picture taken from the 1960 issue of the GARNET. The pieture in the issue before last was of Joseph T. Marras; currently Director of Student Aid. Students with specific questions should see Mrs. Wemple in the Registrar's Office. The next senate meeting will be Tuesday, November 16, at 7:00p.m. in Humanities 115. The Social Committee presents Edgar Winter's White Trash in concert tonight, November 12 at 8:30 p.m. in MemoriaiChapei.Theconcert is sponsored as part of Fall Weekend. The tickets are $3 for Union Students and $4 for aU others. Remscheid Will Speak On Meaning Of Stelnmetz Car Emil Remscheid, who was laboratory assistant to Dr. Charles P. Steinmetz, will discuss the history and personal meaning of the Steinmetz car on Tuesday, November 16 at 7:30. p.m. in Social Sciences 016. Remscheid worked as a laboratory assistant to the famous . General ' Electric genius in the early 1920's, and he has accumulated many little-known facts and stories about the great Steinmetz. Steinmetz' car is being restored by the Union College Student Branch of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and will be placed on permanent display in the future Albany Mall Museum when the renovation is completed. At this early stage in the project, Remscheid's talk will provide a pleasant motivation for all who are interested in the restoration of this historic vehicle.

Bruce Allison, and College President Harold C. Martin. It seems that. the issue underlying the ban of cheerleaders from the Hamilton Game tomorrow is really a question of freedom of speech vs. offending the football spectators. While it is easy to understand that parents and alumni, especially of the visiting teams, would be offended by th.e Union cheers, and it is not beyond question that some of the cheers are distasteful, it also stands to reason that banning the cheerleaders .from the Hamilton game is the easy way out of the situation. It is true that the college has the responsibility to see that its guests are not offended by the students, but it must also be realized that Union College does not represent \the big time\ in football, or in anything else for that matter, and there should be certain things that our cheerleaders can get away with saying. The college should be responsible, too, for permitting its own students to enjoy the football games which, for most, are attended for social, rather than athletic reasons, anyway. In the past, the administrative policy seems to have been one of restraint. concerning censorship of campus organizations, so the action against the cheerleaders seems quite drastic. It is hoped, however, that the subsequent meetings between the cheerleaders and the powers that be result in something less than a total compromise on the part of the cheerleaders. This, of course, carries the implication that total compromise can he avoided only if the administration refrains from demanding such a settlement. The cheerleaders are currently planning to revise their style of cheerleading to one which lies somewhere between thei1· current style and the traditional football cheers. Possibly such a revision could be designed to include coeds who obviously did not fit in with the current trends. To the Editor: There will be a panel discussion on race and racism in : Memorial Chapel on Monday, November 15 at 11:30 a.m. This program is of student origin and the panel members are Union students.

John Perlstein * * >It *I Dear Editor: i Immediately upon returning to my floor after the Student Senate Meeting of November 9, 1971, I distributed the Drug Committee's questionnaire td the inhabitants of tny floor. It O'nfy took a couple hours for a small group of students to form in the hall, who were rather upset over 'the questionnaire, · by its vagueness, its offensiveness, and its seemingly total uselessness. the informal floor meeting was adjourned after deciding to meet again the next night to discuss possible action our floor could take on (or against) this r' • • questionnrure, and after my promise to attempt to get someone of authority, preferably a member of the Drug Committee to attend the meeting. Dave Robbins and Bob Ditter, both Drug Committee members, both i~volved with the 'q}lestionnaire were kind enough to attend our meeting. Many of our questions were answered; many were not. Some of us will now fill out and tum in a questionnaire; some still will not. But because Mr. Ditter and Mr. Robbins were honest in their answers of our _questions, and in their participation in our discussion, most of us now understand why the questionnaire was needed in the first place, and why it is in the form it is. On behlaf of the residents of this floor I would like to thank Dave Robbins and Bob Ditter for attending our floor meeting and contributing as they did; and I would also like to urge all who have not already done so to complete and turn in one of the Drug Committee's questionnaires.

He very solemnly brought up the fact that pornography will automatically lead impressionable youth down the road to perversion and how ane reading would make an otherwise decent youth .go out and kill, rape, raise mayhem, and even grow his hair long.

Unfortunately, when I am bombarded with the likes of Fellini, when events come and go leaving a trail of confusion, I cannot say that I have enjoyed the work. So it must be said although not unequivocally: about Mr. Barry Smith's first major production here, Ondine. The superficial story line of the play is a fairy tale-like romance between a knight and water nymph (Ondine). It alone is cliche. However, by the end of the ftrst act, it becomes clear that we will not be subjected to three hours of Hans Christian Anderson. Interplay between Ondine and an omniscient figure, Old One, leads us to a level of predestination; on which the rest of the play must be viewed. Hopelessly, Ondine fights her inevitable schooling· in the cruel real world, as humans have 'miSmanaged it, unti\l . ultimately. her lover dies and Old One forces· het to see that she never could have known him or how she \should have loved him.\ Not so carefully interwoven within are elements of satire, existentialism and the supernatural so that one gets the impression that he is witness to a play that is \Jack of all themes~ master of none.\ Allow me to stress, in my own ambiguous\ way, that the interpretation of this play can hardly be considered something hard and fast and, above all,rnust not be surmized as simple success or failure. Its scope is that vast. Specifically, certain elements of the production and individuals merit ~ecognition.

Steve Kronish the knight von Wittenstein: makes a sterling performance as someone torn between what he should do and what his emotions dictate. The stoic countenance of Kathy van Oort as the lady Bertha, adds credence to the knight's confusion, when at last he must decide to abandon Ondine. As the most impressive performer of the evening, Thot;n~ Hord, . J?Ortraying the ommsctent Old One, Mr. Hord is stro~g but compassionate, ternbly -effective but not domineering. Ondine has six more performances left and warrants a full house at each. Its faults lies not in the production, but rather in the presumptuous work by Giraudoux. Needless to say, the smut pedler is taken to court. The outcome is as unpredictable as that in a Perry Mason courtroom scene. It ends by urging us down- home, decent, upstanding citizens to do the same to destroy the festering sore (shot of pizza) in our community. Join the CDL in its ftght against smut! Go to it, CDL!

I plus the proverbial cash.\ At last, the Bullets pawned off their precious problem - the Pearl. · Monroe's dissatisfaction with Baltimore began last summer, when a racial disturbance erupted at a high school game at which the Pearl was a spectator. He tried to calm things down. When he left the arena, he was assaulted by the policemen in the parking lot. Subsequently, Monroe was arrested and charged with second-degree assault of an officer. Though the charge was dropped, the incident did not rest easy on the superstar's mind. Unfortunately, the Bullets bungled a bundle of abundant backcourt talent, giving Kevin Loughery and Fred Carter to the 76ers for guard Archie Clark, on the day before Earl Monroe·went AWOL. Due to a misunderstanding and a general lack of communication between Clark, his lawyer, and the Bullets, it was three days before Archie decided to play for Baltimore. Recognizing the cause of this mixup, Clark then fired his lawyer. In those three games, the Bullet backcourt consisted of hardship rookie, Phil Chenier, who did a creditable job by scoring 29 points in one .game, and Gary Zeller, who did not.

So what else can be in the air but Union.College basketball? A Thursday afternoon telephone call to the office of WGY radio program director Don Brown confirmed that WGY will carry Union College basketball games this winter~ The rumor that circulated campus for nearly a month is now fact. Union had originally contacted WGY with the option of carrying UCol hoop, and the delay came as the radio station contracted enough advertisers. A schedule will be released soon, and either thirteen or fourteen · games will be carried. WGY has a. piior commitment to air the ex-champion New York Knickerbockers and can only broadcast those Union games that do not conflict with the Knicks. \Contact\ radio show host Steve Fitz and TV ~ewscaster Bill Duffy will do the broadcasting. . The home season opens December I with the University of Bridgeport, a tough new opponent, and the presence of the .. games on the radio - another big publicity gain for UCol - may not be the only new feature this year. Remember that a winning team was last year's innovation. A small group of students is now trying to produce a basketball program for this season to replace the roster sheets distributed free in previous years. The basketball program, as now conceived, would cost 25¢ and would be a smaller version of the Block U footbaU program. The twelve pages would include team rosters, photographs, statistics, and outlooks for the various games. Six issues would be published to cover the ten home games, and the students involved are now engaged in selling advertising space. One-third of the space has already been filled, but the students will not yet predict a total success. I wish them well, since it is a good effort to help promote interest in what should be a fine basketball team. Four of last year's starters - Jim Tedisco, Tom Bacher,. Mike Doyle, and Geoff Walker - are returning, and they will be complemented by four strong sophomores - Bill Carmody, Tom Combs, Herb Riechenbachf and Chuck Abba. The element of surprise will not be with this year's team, but the stronger squad will make it more difficuit for Union's opponents, all of whom will be gunning for upsets. this year. · Another season with only 3 losses?

White Supremacy- Backlash Racism by STU NESLIN In a convocation yesterday at Memorial Chapel, attended by fewer than fifty people, a panel of students participated in a dialogue on Race and Racism. The panel, moderated by Henry Smith III '70, included Howard Kritzer, Mark Coven, Paul VanCamp, Thomas Watts, Estelle Cooke, Bill Adams, Vincent Foster, and Donald Jones. They discussed some of the causes of racism and the means necessary to end it. Mr. Smith spoke of racism as a disease, keeping the country divided through fear, and preventing blacks and whites from knowing each other. Bill Adams '73 noted that the attitude of white supremacy has led to a backlash racism. • Mark Coven, maintaining that racism here at Union stems from paternalistic attitudes and \attitudinal racism,\ gave two examples of hasty generalizations .· __ , _, , .

Finally we were given a glimpse onto the positive side this past week with an almost definite commitment from John Lindsay, Mayor of New York, to the effect that he is considering making a bid in the primaries. Lindsay accepted the resignation of Richard Aurelio from his job as deputy mayor and appointed him his Campaign Chief. This is not to be confused with campaign manager, as there is, as of now, no campaign to manage. Lindsay is receiving a lot of attention in the national press of late. Doubtless this is owing to the \Charisma'' of which he is said · to possess an overabundance. Regardless of a person's preference in political candidates, Lindsay's style and wit are certainly welcome in the election arena. A brief sampling of the Lindsay style can be shown in thi!l remark that he made before the National Democratic Committee. \This he said, .. is the first time . I have spoken before any members of the Democratic National Committee since 1 became a Democrat and rescued New York City from five and a half years of Republican tyranny.\ Neeiiless to say, this remark was met with instant .laughter. One finds.the question of whether his campaign will be met with. th~ same response to be a very obvwus one. The answer to this isn't known to anyone, not even Dick Aurelio, boy wonder. * * * * Turning to the Republican side of the fence the news of late has been of an interesting, but more or less nebulous nature. Most of it centers around that hero of middle America, Spiro Agnew. Last week, Agnew found himself at a dinner sitting next to his boss (7). What else could he say but that he sincerely hoped that Dick Nixon would make the ultimate sacrifice, giving up a . lucrative law practice in New York, and make a bid for the Presidential nomination. On the . surface this remark is just what should be expected of a Vice President talking about his chief executive. However, a mention of Agnew's willingness to tun with Nixon cannot be found anywhere. An article that appear-ed in this Sunday's New York Times magazine section :developed· a decent case that Agnew is fairly unhappy with the position of Vice President as Nixon views it. Perhaps all of this talk about a fight in the ranks. to replace Agnew is premature. Then~ might not be any Agnew around to be fought. All of which brings up the question of who will take his place: Have you noticed that there are a lot of questions in politics that can't be answered? Well, here's another one. \' \' * \' Washington, D.C. . The Senate Judiciary Committee has put off, at least until late thi~ ~eek any action on recommendmg William Rehnquist and Lewis Powell to the full Senate for consideration of their appointments to the Supreme Court. Hearings were concluded earlier this week though, and it seems that Mr. Powell, described by many analysts as a Distinguished Conservative, will be unanimously endorsed by all sixteen of the Committee members, while Mr. Rehnquist will not fare as well.

Of Racism: What Does It Re:ally Mean-What Can We Do? by BOB DITTER I have just come from a pan~l discussion held in Memorial Chapel ·on the topic of race and racism. As is usual I had at least a few thoughts on the topic which might or might not be valuable to the discussion. As is also usual I kept most of the thoughts to myself, a behavioral manifestation which I believe I share with many other members of Union College, students and faculty alike. The fact that there· are many members of the colleg~ community who do not interact in more than a superficial way, as I believe is true, says something which I think eventually becomes pertinent to the discussion of race and racism at Union College. The sparse turnout to the discussion also may say something about the condition of the college community, but hopefully more than merely that the people on this campus are apathetic. My point is not to castigate the Union community · for not attending the talk. That I leave to the cynics. Exploring reasons as to how the small turn out might be a component of the problem of \racism\, however, and exploring other such components without an accusing finger, is my point. I have used· the word \racism\ in the preceding sentence in quotes. That is because I am never sure that the term has been very well defined and consequently, whether I am talking about the same thing which someone else is talking about in reference to \racism.\ In an effort to get at \racism many people seem to use the \we-are- all-slaves-to-the-same-system\ approach. The line of thinking is that we are all at odds with each other because we've been socialized that way and because the rich people in this country benefit from keeping those of us in the middle class divided. I do not necessarily disagree with these points if for no other reason than I am not sure whether I comprehend them completely. I find that life is a load of details, and there are simply too many details in all of American society for me to say and-interact-as-human-beings\ theory. ln effect what I am saying is that I prefer to take the micro- approach: I believe that racism is part of a larger problem that we as individuals have in interacting with other individuals as a result of the egocentric nature of the human organism. All human beings react instinctively as well as intuitively. Often there is a great disagreement over which reactions we have control over and which ones are inherent. I believe that I:mmans have more control over their actions than they care to admit. How does this relate to the problem of racism? If I am ever to understand anyone, I must come to grips with my egocentered self. If I observe how I act and react, then use my knowledge to modify my behavior, I am taking definite steps to free myself from the \slavery\ to which I referred earlier. If I cannot learn to get to know other people as a result of my not being able to get over my egocentricity (by not being able to submit myself to the details of their situation), then I am certainly not going to be able to get to know someone of whom I have preconceived notions and fears and expectations. l will suffer not only from an inability to identify with his situation, but I will probably end up reacting to my fears and preconceived notions of the person rather than the person himself. In the same line of thought, if I stay away from people because I do not know how to get to know them and how to let them get to know me, then I am certainly going to avoid a person of another race if I have preconceived fears of members of that race (which when commonly held we call stereotypes). Steve Stills makes an observation which may be pertinent here - \a self made man is truly shallow ... \ Self made men might be shallow because they interact with themselves instead of with others. People might appear to remain ••racists\ because they fail to know and be known by others. _ that my meager little brain has grabbed onto the concept of the \system.\ I cannot fathom the \system.\ It is too general and all encompassing. It is also used as a scapegoat. Let me attack the problem this way - I believe that systems are made up of people and that we as individuals (rather than a mysterious group of rich people) perpetrate systems. This is why I say that the thought that the \system\ is the root ·of all of our problems is a scapegoat. If we are going to change any system, it is we who are going 'to have to change first. I suppose that in place of the\we-are-all-siavesMto the-same-evil-system\ argument I am substituting the \we-are-all- slayes-to-the-way-we-develop- If my conception of racism is not clear at this point then let me offer this attempt at a definition. I believe racism is the failure of individuals to experience each others' situations and points of view - a failure to see the world from another set of eyes. The difference between \racism\ and other failures of human interaction is that there is often a higher level of pre- (and usually mis-) conceptions to which the individuals react. One therefore need not be of a different race to be \racist\ towards a person. My final point is that mv urging to have us concentrate on what makes us behave as we do begins with an admission of my own - my ·tendency to keep my thoughts to myself is a part d the perpetration of what I call Continued on Page 3

The Logical Choice For '72: Split Three Indications are that, once again, the prospect of a calendar change is waiting in the wings, for formal action some time this year. It is most unlikely that any change will be made which requires major curricular revision, which means that the only alternative to the present calendar seems to be the split-three. This would entail beginning classes the second week of September, with the first term exams being over before Thanksgiving recess. After a four or five day intersession, we would return for winter term, which would be interrupted after the first three weeks, for Christmas vacation. The conclusion of winter exams would come some time late in February. After intersession, the spring term would begin around the beginning of March and end the third week in May. The advantages of this plan are obvious. First, it can ·be carried out with little or no curricular revision. Second, it would finally· align Union's schedule with the scheduled vacations of many other colleges in the country. Third, it would improve the chances for Union students to obtain summer employment; now, our classes end two to three weeks after those at most other institutions. The opponents of split-three seem to believe that. it would be unhealthy or unwise to split the winter term, but this is really a minor consideration in view of the advantages of the plan. Split-three is the logical choice for next year, and deserves at least a one-year trial period. It is hoped that the faculty and administration will soon opt for this choice. To the Editor: Please let me state my position on make-up exams as this subject has been recently broached in your columns. Basically, I feel make-up exams are unfair, to students and faculty. It seems to me unfair to give some students a longer time to study for exams than the majority of the class has, and this is what make-up exams do. It also seems unfair to ask an instructor to write two separate exams, unless a studer• has been kept away from class by circumstances beyond his control. Thank you. Sincerely yours, Harry L. Gracey Chairman - L.S.S. years at Union. My congratulations to Mr. Smith and the Mountebanks.

Teams CONCORDIENS/8; November 16, 1971 Page 3 Expert Panel Issues Slate by MIKE MESEROLE It's that time of year once again when the venerable sages of the collegiate gridiron begin coming out with their All- America football picks. In ~he next few Weeks we can be sure of seeing pigskin glitter squads by the dozens as picked by the so- called experts, who do most of their scouting over the television. We can also be reasonably sure that most of these all-star teams will be exactly the same. Not to be left on the sideli<Des holding the Gatorade, the Fun & Games Department, as in the past, has some All-America selections of its own. However, • these selections, known as the Irregular All-America Team (Reg. U.S. Pat. Off.), are not your conventional All-America fare. The Irregular Team choices are decided upon every autumn by the Fun & Games Dept's college football award presentation wing, the Anomalous All- America Foundation, Inc. (AAAF), a body of scholarly grid wits and half-wits whose· membership, ranging from out of work song writers in New York to unemployed aeronautical engineers in Seattle, spans the country. With plenty of time on their hands, the Locker Room Irregulars, as they like to call themselves, see every college player in the nation and judge talent not only on how they play, but how they sound.

The 1971 Irregular Team As a tittmg gesture this year, The AAAF has drawn up an anniversary All-Time Irregular Team to complement its 1971 All- America squad. Loaded -with returning All- Irregulars from last season, the 1971 team, nevertheless, has some sensational new personalities.

W es Unseld is third in rebounding, which he has done after his off- season surgery, and the all-new backcourt is strong too, with Jack Marin and Archie Clark, backed up by mighty Mike Riordan and Phil Chenier. Cleveland has the services of Butch Beard, out of the service, and will soon have Austin Carr as well, but defense is non- existent.. The Cavaliers had two men in this week's NBA statistics: Charlie Davis, another guard from Wake Forest, is eighth in free-throw shooting, and Bobby Washington was seventh in assists but was cut to make room for Beard.

In a reply to a question by Howard Kritzer '73 about where to start in the battle against racism Adams suggested that each 'student start with his immediate contacts, using an interpersonal effort to change racist attitudes.

Page 4 CONCORDIENSIS, November 16, 1971 Concordy Sports Garnet Upset By Winless Hamilton, 12 -lO It was supposed to be a low- scoring Garnet win, 'but Coach Gerry Everling forgot to read the script, and Hamilton perpetuated its habitual hex, humbling Union once again in the season finale. The 12-10 loss left the Dutchmen at 3-6, which is all Everling has to show for his creditable initial season. The Garnet · attempt to sandwich its five-game nightmare with four wins by triumphing over the Continentals went by the boards, and a questionable call by the coach sealed that sour fate. The first time Union faced a fourth-down-and-six situation was after 1:42 had elapsed in the opening quarter of play. Starting Continental quarterback Mark Rice had · already becl. Sp(JI)J, f/Uiit incapacitated on the game's first series of downs, as the feared Dutchmen defense forced him tc fumble on a busted play. The ball rested on the Hamilton ten yard line after a Garnet first down was nullified by an offsides penalty. At this point, coach Everling decided to grab a quick three- point lead, which his kicker, Bobby Mitchell, provided from the 16, Seeing his first serious action :111 year, Hamilton freshman quarterback Bob Winters directed his offense on a 64- yard drive in ten plays, scoring himself on an 11-yard jaunt. The PAT went haywire and the Continentals led, 6-3. But after a Union punt, Hamilton failed to crack the Visit To Foxboro with WOODY This could only happen in New England. Since no one wants to build a football stadium in a city of over 600,000 people, build that stadium next to a race track beside a simple, four lane, undivided highway, some 25 miles from the city. That stadium which everyone wanted but no one could build is located in Foxboro, Massachusetts, and its proximity to the highway is like that of a stadium placed on Route 7 east of Latham. This stadium is the home of the New England Patriots, and last Sunday, the Patriots defeated the Buffalo Bills there 38-33, in a real old AFL football game. Jim Plunkett threw. four touchdown passes to four different receivers, and how the winless Bills were able to score 33 points is beyond me. Their defense registered six points by recovering a Carl Garrett fumble in the Patriots' end zone, and Ike Hill ran a punt back for a touchdown, but the Patriots also scored on a punt that Roland Moss blocked and ran in._. How good was a Patriot defense that allowed 33 points? It held O.J. Simpson to 60 yards rushing and no pass receptions. Over 57,000 football fans watched from the benches of Schaefer Stadium, a single deck, bowlish-shaped, concrete edifice that features real seats only in the expensive boxes in the lower third of the seats. rhe rest of the fans sit on the open benches. Pro football fans are merely older than the UCol fans; beyond that, there is little difference. They drink as much and pay as little attention to the cheerleaders - but the cheerleaders are pom-pom girls at Foxboro. Because of the limited highway access to the stadium, most of the fans arrive an hour or more before the game. On Sunday, half an hour before game time, a large yellow truck resembling the kind used to repair street lights rambled onto the sidelines near the Patriot bench. The PA system dutifully informed the crowd that \The Patriots welcome the staff of Life magazine which is here to photograph for a future issue. We thank you for your cooperation.\ The response was an overwhelming chorus of boos. Here was a truck parked on the sideline directly in front of the stands, and when the arm with the photographers' sling was raised into the air, our view from halfway up the stands was blocked. \Move that goddamn truck,\ hollered the fans, and wrappers and beer cans began to fly out of the stands. When the photographers turned to take pictures of the crowd, sea of middle fingers met them. The Flying Dutchmen would have been proud. But were these belligerent fans? Hardly. They paid good money to see a professional football game, and the management had no right to place the truck where it did. An ugly situation would have developed if the truck had not been moved before the kickoff. • The paying fans come first - it's their money, but even the fans make mistakes. The Patriots have installed screens behind the goalposts to catch balls kicked through the uprights, but the nets are not permanent. Ushers raise them right before the kicks just as you would raise a flag up a flag pole. Those fans that tried to hold down the nets in order to allow the balls to sail into the stands and cause a small riot among the scrambling spectators were wrong. Fans pay their money and expect to have an unobstructed view of the field; they should not expect souvenir footballs .. Ten lost footbaUs on Sunday would cost nearly 200 dollars. And if those fans are lucky, they see a hell of a wide-open and exciting football game. Having the Patriots win makes it an even better visit to Foxboro. Garnet wall on a fourth..and-one. Alternating quarterbacks Gary Lauver, who started, and Mitchell then led the Dutchmen 68 yards in 11 plays. Fullback AI Albano crashed through for the final ten. Albano picked up 53 yards in 13 carries before bein.g mysteriously banished from play shortly after halftime. His loss was offset by a fine return to action by Curtis Rowe. Near the end of the opening period came a second fourth .. and- six. for the Garnet, from the Continental 8 this time. Here, Gerry Everling looked at the 10-6 score and visi<;>ns of an unheard- of Union romp may have raced through his mind, for he sent Mitchell in to pass rather than kick. No less than three Hamilton defenders batted down the aerial, and that was that. Continental linebacker Andy. Sopchak was the individual star of the contest. His interception of . a deflected Lauver pass on the Dutchmen 42led to a one-yard score by halfback John Beck. Of the 168 Hamilton rushing yards, Beck had 141 in .31 carries. After Beck's touchdown, Garnet linebacker Kevin Coughlan made what should have been the key play in a 13-12 win, blocki11g the extra-point attempt. Later in the second stanza, Sopchak blocked two consecutive Union punts. Not only was punter Jilll Niver slow in getting his attempted boomers off, but he set up only 12 yards from scrimmage instead of the standard. 15. Sopchak's first block came on a fourth•and-six (what else~) near midfield. His second gave the Corttinentals the ball at the Dutchmen one yard line, where the defense was super once more in thwarting thtee line thrusts and a final, desperate sweep. Linebackers Coughlan, tom Anacker, and Howie Benedict were superb throughout the day. · The second half of the game was a frustrating one for Everling, for the Garnet, and for ·their fans. With l09 seconds showing i11 the third period, Mitchell kicked a 32-yard field goal attempt about 52 yards, 'but it went just wide to the right. ·It certainly became obvious after a stretch that Everling was using Lauver to engineer the running plays and Mitchell to throw. At one point, this was so transparent that Lauver's looping 30-yard toss found Geoff Walker ten yards from his nearest defender, who unfortupately happened to be the safety downfield in position to make a touchdown-saving tackle. In the end, though, Mitchell won out and had his squad in fine field position for an easy win with less than two minutes to go. Halfback Bruce Mathias took Mitchell's screen pass 36 yards, and the fans were up. But Mitchell's pass from the 1'9 landed in the arms of defensive halfback Ross Peters . Fearless, . Belated NBA Predictions Union walked off the field having been upset for the third straight year, two coming in the friendly confines of Alexander Field, by a weak Hamilton Continental contingent. Wait till next year! Hoop.lked O·n WGY byLEAPIN Unlike football or baseball, standings are relatively unimportant in basketball;. it is the so-called \second season,\ the playoffs, that count, as proven dramatically by last year's NBA Baltimore Bullets. With that in mind, I ignore the extraneous exercise of exacting predictions but will attempt to pinpoint qualifiers for the playoffs. In the NBA, the top two teams from the four divisions fill eight berths, and in the Atlantic Division, one of three good teams must be eliminated. It won't be the Knicks, despite present gloomy implications, because Earl Monroe, in conjunction with Clyde Frazier, will be tearing up the league within a month, Reed or no Reed. The Boston Celtics raced off to a 10-l start before dropping four straight, but the improved play of center Dave Cowens and guard Jo Jo White plus the durability of superstar J,ohn Havlicek is more than the talent- thin Philadelphia 76ers can handle~ That myth about the impeccability of Celtic GM Red Auerbach as a scout went by the boards with last year's first- round selection of Clarence Glover in the draft. Meanwhile, Philadelphia has superstar Billy \The Kid\ Cunningham and a wealth of could-be's (Loughery, Carter, Washington) and has-beens (Greer, Jackson) and, barring further injuries to the Knicks or · to Mr. Cowens, should wind up third in this struggle. A much-improved Buffalo squad is still weak. Union fans may remember the Braves' local Randy Smith, who poured in 45 points in a New York - New Jersey regional tournament game last season, and is now third among the league shooters in field goal accuracy. Elmore Smith (no relation) is a 7-footer who is fourth in rebounding and will form the nucleus of Buffalo's future winning teams, but two forwards are needed to go along with the Smiths and Walt Hazzard, acquired cheaply from Atlanta. Cincinnati~s b1g two-game winning skein propelled the Royals into first place in the Central Division with a 5-7 mark, but they won't stay there for long. Bob Cousy, beleagured coach, threatened to fine centers Darrell Imhoff and Luther Rackley if they let Celtic Cowens 1 intimidate them again, then traded away guard Norm Van Lier:, a fine ball-handler, for another weak center, Jim Fox.

Health Research Center Established It was an11ounced that a research center for students and professionals interr=sted' in the health services field .has been established at the college. Jorgensen represents area hospital administrators. A seminar on health problems- held at the college ~ast spring led to the development of the center which was established recently by Union's Board of Trustees. The college is currently offering three courses related to health under the auspices of the center. They are: Health Economics, Health Planning and a Health Studies Seminar. by PHYLLIS EDELMAN Emil Remscheid, lab assistant to the late Or. Charles Steinmetz_, recalled the life and times of this famous former Union College professor. The lecture, held at 7:30. p.m. last Tuesday, was sponsored by, the IEEE. Dr. Steinmetz, a native of Germany, was born in Breslow in 1865~ After receiving his primary education there and attending the University of Breslow, he left for Switzerland in 1888. There he attended the Polytechnical I:nstitute of Zurich, studying mathematics and chemistry. ln Switzerland he met a young American who invited him to America. Accepting the invitation, Or. Steinmetz went to Yonkers, New York where he 'found employment with a Mr. Ecklemeyer who owned an electrical factory that manufactured motors. Here he worked in the drafting room, designing alternating current motors. It was there that he developed the Theory of Hysteresis which helped }lim in designing these motors. Ecklemeyer's plant later became part of General Electric, and Steinm.et?: became a member of the company. lie came to Schenectady in 1894 to work for General Electric. In 1902 Harvard conferred a Master of Arts degree on Dr. Steinmetz. The following year Union College bestowed upon Steinmetz a doctorate in The Health S(udies Center will be a part of Union's Institute of Administratiol\ and Management and will be run in cooperation with the- Schenectady County Medical ~ociety. the Albany Medical College. the Hospital Association of New York Stat( and other health professionals in the Capital District. The center's activities will be focused on aspects of health care service including the study of problems such as facility design, the technolom of the field, experimental' facilities, training of personnel, 11taff planning and management.

On Environmental Conce·rns Over last weekend, several members of the Schenectady Protect Your Environment Club (PYE) led youth group seminars held at the Emmanuel Baptist Church. The church was the site for a convention of over 300 high school juniors and seniors from the Baptist churcbes of New York State. The convention theme was \Alive in a World\ with an emphasis on participating in that world. The PYE participants led discussions on the broad topic of environmental action, then dealt with their specific concerns. The setn!nar chairmen Were: Paul Connors (Open Space and Recreation: 'The New Conservation), Chris . Nielsen (Wildlife Exploited) and tom Lundquist (Recycling: Programs and Problems). In the, a,fternoon, the interested students were taken to Ynion for a demonstration of water sampling technig,ue. The detergent test on the Hans Groot's Kill was run by Todd .Rana and .

From then on Steinmetz was referred to as ~\the Doctor.\ In 1912, Dr. Steinmetz added rooms to his lab, home and greenhouse on Wendell Ave. It was at this time Remscheid became his lab assistant. Remscheid's · tasks were to maintain order in the lab,. make sure that the instruments were well calibrated, and assist the one or two· test men in the lab. According to Remscheid', Dr. Steinmetz was most productive from 1912 until his death in 1923. Included among his many accomplishments during this time was a professorship at Union College. and positions as Chief Consulting Engineer of General Electric, President of the Board of Education in Schenectady and President of the Common Council of Schenectady, as well as authorship of nine textbooks on electrical engineering, and lectures on countless subjects. Mr. Remscheid noted that Steinmetz's interest in electric autos began in 1906 when he purchased a Stanley Steamer. He drove this car only once, for when making a rlght turn he forgot to turn the wheel back and found hims_elf and the ca~: wrapped around a tree. Corp. The costs for the truck in terms of electricity were less than the food for a single ho[se doing .the ~>a me work. Works by Dr. Steinmetz include \Notes on the Theory of Oscillating Currents\ written in 1896. At that time little was known about !llternating current, and· Steinmetz wished to correct whatever misunderstanding.s there were. In 1909 Steinmetz delivered a lecture concerning the \Psychological Effect of Radiation,\ in which he pointed out the harmful effects of ultra- violet light and X-rays. In an article in the Ladies Home Journal of August, 1915, Dr. Steinmetz predicted the day when heating and cooking would be done electrically. He also forecast the invention of the television. He foresaw the day when the motion picture and talking machine would be perfectly synchronized. . . \' . The Detroit Electric Auto owned by SteinmetZ is currently on campus. The car, located in Scotia and identified by Mr. Remscheid and Mafjorie Hayden, Dr. Steinmetz's grandchild, is being overhauled by Union College students. Valued at $4,000 in 1915, the car would be worth (in good condition) approximately $30,000 today. The most outstanding feature of the car was thl;lt it could be driven from both the front and back seats. Mr. Remscheid's comment upon seeing the car in its present condition was, \It's a lot different than it was.\ At a conference for American Student Electrical Engineers in 1915 Dr. Steinmetz met Thomas Edison. Edison offered to give Steinmetz .. Edison batteries\ if he would buy a Detroit Electric Auto made by Anderson Electric of Detroit. Steinmetz complied with this and Remscheid was given charge of caring for the car, It was his job to keep the parts well lubricated, the· battery The Right to Life charged, the electric contacts Committee of our Area maintained, and the controller (presently organizing out of arm, which regulated the speed, Elanson, N.Y.) extends an clean. invitation to the girls at Union Dr. Steinmetz was also College who believe in the responsible for the unique Right to Life. construction of the Dade Electric November 20th in Albany, Auto.

Under terms of the will, half the gross estate goes to his widow. His extensive collections of master drawings and Greek and Etruscan antiquities were left to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, of which he was a former treasurer and vice president. Other specific bequests were made to St. Thomas Church in New York, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, the Episcopal Church, the American Academy in Rome, the Pierpont Morgan Library, and the Archeological Institute of America, as well as to individual relatives and friends. . Union College was left $100,000 and named as the ultimate residuary beneficiary of the remaining half of the estate after specific bequests have been deducted. Mrs. Baker retains life use of the residual estate. Money received by the college beyond the initial bequest is to be used for endowment in general support of teaching, with a sum set aside to endow a Professorship in Fine Arts in memory of Mr. Baker's first wife, the late May I. C. Baker. No estimate has yet been made of the value of the estate.

To the Editor: Recent letters to the editor, as well as Coneordy editorials, point to the feelings of frustration and impotence that many students and some faculty are experiencing. This frustration cannot be ascribed simply to mit.ldle-of-the-territ blues or senior slump; it is the symptom of a disease, namely a pronounced lack of strong, dynamic administrative leadership on this .~am pus. Increased theft. and poor mai I delivery are not the issues here. Any institution has some shortcomings, and the inconveniences that plague students here would be present in some form or other at whatever college they attended. What is more disturbing is the prevalent attitude of disinterest shown by the administrators on .this campus; choose the path of least resistance regardless of the implications, preserve the status quo when possible, deal with problems when confronted by them, but do not attempt to anticipate them. It would be foolish to expect those in the Administration Building or in Old Gym Hall to come up with sol~tions that ar.e instant. Yet, one might expect to see a responsiveness, an esprit de corps, that is completely missing. The long-term prospects for Union may not be stable, necessitating major attention on the part of our administrators. However, even more urgent is attention to the short-term prospects, the Un~on that exists day-to-day. Obviously, it is far easier to criticize than to attempt to change. There is, and always will be, a definite ga,p between the Union that is and the Union that could be. Many of the criticisms voiced above would be invalid if we were merely one more arm of the monolithic state university system. Union, hpwever, can be an alternative to such a system. We have always been an institution that has offered a higll degree of quality in our programs. In the period of development that we are facing now, can Union afford less? - Name wlthheld by request. • • • • To the Editor: The advantages of the split- three academic calendar advocated by Mr. Snitkoff boil down to an improved possibility of obtaining a summer job; nothing more. The single disadvantage cited as .. really a minor consideration\ deserves scrutiny. A midterm vacation of sizeable duration as that inherent in the split-three concept is a significant detriment to beneficial continuity of material assimilation. The student wilt forget a good deal over this midterm break, creating a two step forward, one step back approach to education. More important, a vacation between terms fulfills the stringent definition of a vacation such that it allows the student freedom to pursue any activities he desires and affords him .the opportunity for absolute relaxation via a transitory escape to such diverse pursuits. A midterm vacation fails to satisfy in these respects. One of Union's prize advantages over high school (think back) is that here we need not have our vacations destroyed by school work and impending exams. I strongly urge all underclassmen to consider whether they desire a Christma!l vacation of freedom, or of servitude to academic obligations in fact and/ or in conscience. Dale E.

Y .U ., for years a basketball power, dropped its entire athletic pr.ogram. Also, last year the University of Buffalo. dropped its 'football program. Deletions such as these are not healthy for the college environment. Athletics benefit the college community in many ways. Many good students are drawn to· their respective colleges because of the athletic opportunities they will find there. Of course, this benefits the student who desires to engage in a sport but it also benefits the college. If a college · wants to attract a certain type or individual student the athletic program can be a major gambit. Schools also retain much support from alumni who are interested in sports. Sp.orts events are often the reason for returning to the college and they attract support from enthusiastic alumni who are either pleased With or hopeful for a successful team. Finally, the school- is benefited by public recognition of athletic feats. The college becomes of interest to the outside community whether it be local, regional or national and thusly, · important to the community. Sports obviously benefit the student participant. Many students, in addition to their studies, have a strong interest and desire to prove and improve their physical abilities. Sports are an important factor in the building of the character; this is an important function of the collegiate experience and is, therefore, good. Also, sports benefit the . non.;participant student. Athletic events prQvide diversion for the bulk of the college community. And this diversion is welcome Whether it comes during the Week or on Saturday. Sports are important to student life. N.Y.U. and the University of Buffalo must have a number of discontented students because of the actions taken by their respective administrations. Sports play a large enough role at Union to affect a substantial number of ''tudents, faculty and alumni. If the economic situation at ~Union worsens, some austerity must be introduced. But it is our ~incere hope that if this situation occurs \ the athletic programs will be ' retained at their full strength due to their significant benefit to our community.

RPI Group To Perform Award-Winning Drama The RPI Players will present Archibald Macleish's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama in verse \J.R\ on Dec. 3, 4, 10, 11 at the 15th Street Lounge on the campus, across from the old Troy Armory. The Players, fresh from ten straight sellout performances; have once again found an able and experienced director. Jack Natkin, a doctoral student in co~munications at RPI, has directed for seven years at Michigan Technical University and acted in more than.lOO'plays. Performanc,;es are at 8:30 p.m,., and tickets at $1.50 each are available at the RPI student union and by telephone at 270- 6503 or 271-7096. Archibald MacLeish was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1959 for \J.B.\ It first was presented April 22, 1958 by the Yale University School of Drama at their theater. MacLeish, writing in the New York Times, said of J.B. that he had constructed a \modern play inside the ancient majesty of the Book of Job.\ \Job's search, like ours, was for meaning of his afflictions - the loss of his children, the loss of everything he possessed, the loss of his wife's kindness, who turned upon him in his agony with those ineradicable words, surely the most dreadful ever spoken by wife to husband: •curse God and die!\' MacLeish wrote. The setting of J.R is a circus tent, but the action in the ring is the series of tragedies in the life of an affluent, contented banker known as J.B. and his family. Around the ring and above in the ramps and 'platforms which at times represent middle and upper Heaven, two popcorn vendors · playing the Devil and God observe and, in many cases, believe they are manipulating the forces acting on the family. traditional theater torms.

J.B.'s children are killed, his bank is lost and his flesh seared in a nuclear holocaust, yet, like Job; he will not curse God. The interactiQn is on three levels -- J;B. and his family, Nickles and Zuss with J.B., and God upon all characters. God, of course, never physically appears on stage.

The book, published by Educatio~al Testing Service with the support of a $55,000 grant from the Henry Luce Foundation of New York City, contains information on programs and services tailored for minority-group students, now under- represented in the nation's graduate and professional schools. All information is provided by the 900 schools included in the book. For example, each entry describes a school's admissions standards, fee waiver and financial aid programs, and any fellowshi:p programs for Blacks or other minority groups. If a school actively recruits students from minority groups, that fact is indicated. Some schools also give the percentage of such students currently enrolled in their institution. Plans call for distributing more than 17,000 · copies of the book free of charge during the coming academic year to Black, Mexican American, and Puerto Rican students and student organi:t;ation, to libraries, and to college and graduate school counselors. Graduate and Professional School Opportunities for Minority Students w~s first published two years ago by the Harvard-Yale-Columbia Intensive Summer Studies Program to improve communications between minority groups and graduate-level institutions.

Page 6 CONCORDIENS/S, November 19, 1971 Shearling seat covers are the newest fad seen on college campuses across the country. Students can choose from a variety of with-it colors and patterns to add style and comfort to their cars. ' In addition to creating a super look, the shearlings are extremely comfortable. Race car drivers and jet pilots have tested them and find that they relieve fatigue and provide comfort during long hours at the wheel. The unique qualities of the wool sheading niake them warm in winter and cool in summer. The shearlings are also weather resistant and durable so students can bring in beach sand and football mud without worrying about damaging the luxurious, soft feel and look. Designed to fit all bucket and bench seats, they attach to the car seat with fine leather harnesses. Off the seat, the shearling doubles as a rug, blanket or throw. For the student who is interested in functional luxury for his auto, shearling car seats offer a definite plus . .................................................................. ~ ....................... . .

Characteristically not brooding and always realistic, Coach Scanlon relayed the importance of training in all sports and particularly in a team sport such as basketball, dependent on precision and coordination. Lack Frosh Hoop .... of enough practice is therefore the team's ftrst disadvantage. Tony Bangs, Kevin Crawford, Mitch Kahn, Greg Luntz, Bill Underhill, and Don Zee are battling for. starting positions at the guards. Jack Comerford should start in one corner, and Marc Czajkowski, Joe Ketmey, Rich Maisano, and Barry Roff are contending for the other spot. Star Charlie Gugliotta will start at center, backed up by Bob Pfifferling. It should be noted that Union plays many junior varsity teams, which will contain sophomores and sometimes, juniors. Since Union will use only fteshmen, here is the squad's second disadvantage. Sorry Friends - Yout favorite Union College newspaper CONCORDIENSIS begins its Thanksgiving vacation after this issue.

The Knicks suffer from the same problem as the Mets, Jets, and 76ers. All four champs have been unable to repeat. It has been said that a second crown is tougher to attain than the first.

Their only addition is Jazzie Cazzie Russell, for whom they gave Jerry Lucas, and even a healthy Nate the Great Thurmond will not be enough to overcome LA and . meet their three closest rivals in ability. Their opening-round opponent, the second-place Pacific Division finisher, will probably be Seattle. Meanwhile, Los Angeles and Chicago will be hitting heads, These four are superior to all Eastern Conference teams with the exception of New York. The Lakers can spoil things, both for Milwaukee and New York.

I:Je thmks h1s team thts year has \the best overall talent\ Umon has ever s~en - it is \20 percent better than last year, but the schedule 1s also 20 percent tougher.\ The coach estimates that l7 or 18 of his team's 22 opponents will be able to use freshmen - Union cannot·- and \that is a wild card.\ A lot of talent will be available to the Garnet's opposition, and the Garnet will not be able to match it. · An 18-3 record is a difficult one to match and co~sequently, Walters is only \cautiously optimisti~\ on ~mon'~ ch~~ces this year. So that Garnet fans will not tmmedm~ely expect anot~er season with only three losses, Walters 1s careful to detrul the problems his team faces this year. Size and back court depth are those problems. This will be an \exciting t~am\ an~ will fea~ure \more outside shooting than last year, accordmg to the coach, but the starting front c~mrt may only average 6'3\. Tom Combs, at 6'4\ is the team gtant. So. Union will run a lot. But to have more than one s~bstitute at the guard positions, Walters will have to go to h1s reserves at forward and find some swing men. ~inc~ ~1. Westbrook did not return to college and Gene Qm~k Is _mJured., only Joe! Roslyn, sparingly used last year, is b.ehmd J1m Tedtsco and Btll Carmody as fulltime guards. The· coach sees his team as one with ''a lot of offensive answers, but we are going to have to have tougher defense. The good teams play good defense.\ In the last two weeks of pre-season practice before the .Pome opener on December 1 - a pre-season practice which was cut short ?Y two '.\eeks due to another NESCAC ruling Walters satd he will spend \75 percent of the time on defense.

An unprecedented string of injuries and the loss of four freshmen, via a NESCAC rule, for the final three games of the season, contributed to the team's disappointing 3-6 record.

Co-captain Pete Kellet, a defensive back, co-captain Gary Morris, a defensive tackle, punter Jim Niver, halfback Larry Bloom, and guard Bill Simson were the only seniors on the 1971 team.

Pace II Is Successful by TOM LUNDQUIST The Schenectady Protect Your Environment · Club (PYE) recently aided in the most successful PACE II recycling project to date. The monthly PACE II projects offer county- wide recycling stations which collect cans, paper., glass and rags. The Union Coilege site, which was manned by PYE and Linton High's Survival, collected . over 14 tons of paper, 4 tons of glass and 3 tons of cans on the November 20 date.' The next collection date is tentatively scheduled for January. Meanwhile, the on-campus recycling program for paper ahd cans continues to run. This program will be terminated for the term on this Thursday, December 2. This will allow time for the site captains to clean up the stations and deliver the materials before exams begin. PYE is hopeful to continue both recycling projects during the winter term. strengths i:n order to take opponents by surprise. But it appears that the youthful second-year coach is genuinely concerned about the bad luck which has plagued his team so far. \I'm not at all optimistic,\ Walters reports. \We're going to need our best effort yet, and even it may not be enough.\ Ankle sprains have been the chief culprit among the injuries,_ sidelining sophomore guard Bill. Carmody and so ph forward Tom Combs probably until after the holiday recess. The 5-1.0 Carmody, who led the Union frosh to a 13-3 mark last year, was to replace Dave Shames this season as Jim Tedisco's backcourt mate. His loss nearly wipes out Union's backcourt strength and Combs' loss will severely hamper the Garnet's flexibility in the front court. Junior center Tom Bacher, who averaged 16 points a game last season in Union's 18-3 performance, has also been hobbled by ankle problems. He will play tomorrow night against Bridgeport, but his speed, agility, and aggressiveness will be handicapped. \Torn will be going at about 50 percent,\ estimates the coach. It is no surprise, then, that Walters is \very discouraged\ with the outlook for the beginning of this season. Union's Well- publici:z:ed lack of height. will be even more of a problem because of the injuries, now that the Garnet's bench· strength has been sapped. Normally an aggressive, pressing tearn on defense, the Dutchmen will now have to be cautious, laying back to avoid more injury problems and the further manpower difficulties that excessive fouling will cause. Walters is especially worried about tomorrow night's opponent, Bridgeport's Purple Knights. Already the Knights are rated contenders for a New England NCAA college. division tournament berth. Bridgeport is big and physically strong, boasting 6-7 Bill Callan and 6-6 Mike Mulvihill up front. Callan averaged Continued on Page 4 Film-Makin.g To Be Offered Next Term Unio.n Graduate Will Act As Instructor Bob Thurber is ·a graduate of the New York University School of Film.

Has Leapil1 Leiderman ever taken a course. in, organizational psyehology? Apparently not, because who is: ·he· to criticize another person's right to be himself? I Prof. Harry Gracey has that right - to be himself and to conduct his Sociology 10 cJass in whatever manner he wants. To deny Prof. Gracey -· or anyone else iii the world - the right to be himself shows eminent disrespect for another person's rights and is an authoritarian posture. · Leapin Leiderman also has a right to be himself, and in seeking courses at Union, he should be able to find professors ~hose style of management within the classroom fits his ewn ideas. The fault ..is not with Prof. Gracey - and fault even lies with Leiderman for his ever criticizing the professor - but the fault is with the Union College organizational structure which does not properly inform the students of the managerial styles of professors in their various classes. This problem would. have been avoided ~ an incompatible pair of professor and student would never come together - if the student-run and College-sanctioned Linebacker course evaluation report was properly prepared. The professor's knowledge of the course material, the level of the course, and if the course is a gut are irrelevant factors. The professor's style within the classroom - how does he run and teach the course? - is important, for a person cannot enjoy a course if he does not get along with the professor's style. Once this managerial information is available, then no- student can ever criticize a profes.sor for his attendance and make~up exam policies. In fact, Prof. Gracey would then be justified if he popped Leapin Leiderman in the mouth. We'll never get anywhere if we can't respect another person's right to be hi~self. Peter Pause Restaurant 535 Nott Street - G.S.B. ·ro the Editor: It is no secret that the college and just about everybody else in this country is on a program to eliminate unnecessary spending. Corners are being cut whenever and wherever possible in order to save money. I think the powers that be at Union will admit to such ·a program. It seems that, in light of such economizing, a policy has been adapted that is tetribly unfair to the student. Without any consultation with the student body as to possible alternatives, it is now required that all bills be paid to the school twenty days_ before the start of the Winter • Term. Setting aside the particular cases where a loan or other aid is available mily at the fitst C)[. the year, it . is in;tportant to understapd how much this policy is costing the student in interest. With the understanding that not every student pays the college $800, let's assume the tuition to average at $500 ·per student. Also assume that the enrollment is 1700. That means the college is collecting about · $850,000 for Winter · Tertn; tuition. At an annual interest · rate of 5%, $850,000 Will· eain :about $42,000 per year, $3,001l per month. This means that by having $850;000 available for 20 days, the college has a potential income of $2,000, at the expense of the students. I am not implying that the college is · intentionally taking advantage of the student in order to save money, nor am I implying that the: college has enacted· t~s .policy to make money. But if this is not the case, why does the comptroller refuse to accept a post dated check without charging a late fee? This will eliminate excessive amounts of money at re~tration, as does· the present twenty day before-the,.. fact .payment does. And if a 'post dated check is not acceptable, surely there must be other alternatives to the unfair policy which now exists. Don l<'rancotino 'fo the Editor: Mter reading Mr. Leiderman's articles on the pro basketball scene, it appears that his insight of the game is limited, his sources poor,. but, for ·f! paper of the Concordy's stature, seemingly adequate. However, in the Novemb~t 19th issue, Mr. Leidennan has let his mind \leap\ right out of all sensibility. It would also seem apparent that thel\e are several alarming discrepancies within the artiCle. · First of all, the so-called \name-switch\ of Kareem Abdul Jabbar from Lew Alcindor ~nnot be compared with that of Muhammed Ali from C~ssius Clay. If Mr. Leidennan had attempted to do a minimum of research, he would have discovered that the· former name- switch was as a result of a legitimate three-year religious indoctrination, whereas the latter name,..switch (so unpopular with the media) is of · questionable religious value. The distinction here must he made between the Moslem faith aqd the sometinie• political Black Muslim movement:·· Sports ·IIJufl.trated writer- Peter Carry's quote . referring to Milwaukee as .. the greatest team ever\ was taken. out of context. Although the tide of the article was ''The Best Team ....,... Ever,\ had Mr. ~iderman once again done his homework properly aild taken the time and trouble to read the article, he would have found that not only Mr: Carry, but also a number of playerS and coaches referred only to the possibility ·of Milwaukee's becoming the }?est team ever: The majority of opinions, backed by conclusive ·statistics clearly show that ·the 1964-65 Boston Celtics are currently regarded as the best team ever. ·In order for Milwaukee to clai-m this distinction, Mr. Carry points out (via former Celtic great K.C. Jones) that the Bucks need a con~ist~ntly scoring· forward to complement Jabbar at center and Oscar Robertson at guard. Mr. Carry's article is full of \ifs\ • and \maybes.\ - The question at hand is not which team was (or is) the greatest team ever, but rather y which team wiU be this season's NBA champions. Unfortunately, we've all heard year after year that dispite this injury or despite that weakness, ''the Lakers are better than ever.\ Any team with as many individual stars in its. lineup at one time, as Los Ap_geles has had for a couple of years, cannot win · it al1. Th.e moment Wilt Chamberlain steps onto a CO!lft .the entire offense must be centered around his- whims and desires, or else be won't play. With tile departure of Elgin Baylor, the takers lose one of their stars,. but this won't make th!ngs any easier for them. Sure, they're good ......,_ good for only third place in 1971•72 betllnd Golden State and Seattle. Finally, Mr. Leidertnan's ·~two possibilities\ in. the playoffs are completely . contradictory. His first possibility, suggesting a Milwaukee victory . over · the l;.akers in the semi,.f1nals ancl tbe . :Bucks' eventual loss . ~o the,~ K,nicks in th~ )'i:fials,,. i~ .£lfl~il~\ unfou.nde~; ~h~•ng so,, oQY:lQ.\IS.i~r t influ~nced'by ffis biased love for the New Yoi'ker5 '<Wait \Clyde\ Fr~iier;' E~rl nthe Pearl\ Monroe, ''Tricky'; Dick Barnett, Dean \the Dream\ Meminger, and formerly Dave ••the Rave\ Stallworth). His second possibility clearly contradicts. his first, when he states tha~ he feels Los Angeles, . after defeating Milwaukee, could dribble right past his belo-ved KniCks.

Page 4 CONCORDIENSIS, Nov. 30, 1971 Concordy Sports ABA Puzzle: Can Utah's Basketball ·opens Tomorrow _Night Stars Upend The Big A? by L.I!:APJN A semblance of order and ultimate parity with the NBA lurk on the horizon for the still- abysmal ABA. Four teams would play .500 ball in the established league; they are the only ones above that figure in the ABA. The other seven are from two to five games below even as they knock each other off and lose to the Big Four. Squires are no better than second- best. Doug Mee is getting old and Jim Eakins is a weak, though efficient, center. backcourt, but New York, too, needs the strong big man. Occupying the East basement are the Carolina Cougars, who may be the best of the worst. Joe Caldwell has not played yet, Larry Miller is another of the ABA's fine forwards, and Jim McDaniel is a strong seven- footer. The Cougars may become a contender, but not, this year anyway, a winner. Continued from Page 1 double figures in both scoring and rebounding last season, and is one of· seven returning lettermen su·engthening the Knights. Al Fischer, 5' 10\ captain, averaged 20 points. a game last year and is termed an \inspirational leader\ for Bridgeport. I could play guard for Kentucky, •but the Colonels, 15-6, are sure to capture the Eastern title with their unstoppable fmecourt trio. Artis Gilmore is to the junior league as Kareem Abdul Jabbar is to the NBA. Dan lssel is back at home at forward and is the league's top scorer, and his mate, Cincy Powell, fits right in with the two young superstars. The rest of the East Division .reeks. Pittsburgh, seeking a switch to New Haven or out west, has already shifted most of its roster, retaining star forward John Brisker and Dave Lattin of NBA and ijarlem Globetrotter fan.:te. The Garnet will counter with a Hneup averagi:Q.S just a shade over six feet per man, and showing no starter over 6-3. Bacher, 6-3 Mike Doyle, and 6-3 Geoff Walker will get the nod up front, with senior co~captain Tedisco teaming With 6-2 NYU transfer Chuck Abba, a converted forward, in the backcourt. Name-changing has caught on, and the former Warren Armstrong, best of The Floridians (their official name), is now· Warren Jabali. An ·indication of just how poor his team is, however, is that starting center .Craig Raymond is a Philadelphia castoff, and the 76ers certainly are not top-heavy with good pivotmen. The defending champion Utah Stars head the West. They have a well-balanced squad that is , weakest at center, if\Zelmo Beaty can be considered weak. Willie Wise is an unsung star, as good as professional forward as any. With him is Glen Combs, distant cousin of Union's own Tom and a 20-point scorer in his own right. The guards, Ron Boone an4 Jimmy Jones, are solid. All-American Tedisco, as everyone knows by now, is expe~tea to lead the Dutchmen once again this season. He has already broken every scoring and assist re~ord on the Dutchmen books after only two seasons of Var$ity play. The 5- 7 sensation averaged 24.5last year and 29.6 as a sophomore. Virginia's guard-forward duo \ of Charlie Scott and hot-shot rookie Julius Erving gets half Of the team's points, with the former averaging well over 30. There is minimal support and the The New York Nets have been relying too heavily ·on Rick Barry, who can still hit 30-plus per game. John Roche and Billy Melchionni, top assist man in the loop; comprise a promising The only ·question: can they stop the Big A, Artis Gilmore? The. · Pacets J:iave to be considered the weakest of the Big Four. Mel Daniels is no better than Beaty and Rick Mount hasn't shown his Purdue form. lndia\na Councilman Roger Brown doubles as another great ABA forward.

Walters, the Middlebury coach two years ·ago, would like to follow up last year's come from behind 71-70 Union win with another Gamet triumph. Season's Greetings with WOODY Some thoughts for the impending holiday season in this final issue of the term as you all scrub lip for finals next week and a Merry Christmas. No scrubbing will be allowed, however, tomorrow night, as THE basketball team opens up its season against the tough Purple Knights of the University of Bridgeport. Anything but a sellout crowd will be a disappointment - that means over 2200 in the Field House, otherwise known as the Black Hole of Schenectady, one of the diim,nest place~ ever known for playing and viewing basketball. The college announces the Field House capacity as 3500, but a check of the bleachers that will be in use tomorrow night, with the assistance of good old Don (whom you'll watch sweeping the Field House floor), revealed only 2200 seats, and not even Don, who is in charge of putting up the bleachers, can explain the discrepancy. lhe game, which will prove how well .an under-manned Union team can cope with a team of Bridgeport's size and experience, goes off at 8 P.M., and a large crowd will gather early, both in anticipation of the game and to snatch up the 520 game programs that will be on sale for 25¢ 'apiece. Students are obviously admitted free, so bring a quarter if you come early. * * * * The Downtown Athletic Club did not send me a Reisman Trophy ballet, but if it had, my vote would have gone to Ed Marinaro, no questions asked. That Marinaro lost to Pat Sullivan of Auburn - which I used to think was a city in Ma·ine or New York- is probably a little Southern Strategy in reveFse. Real prejudice existed against Marinaro for his being a football player from the north and east, and an Ivy Leaguer to boot. The man who set major college season' and career rushing records led the balloting in the eastern, midwestern, and western regions, but I'm sure every southern sportswriter automatically voted for Sullivan rather than some damn yankee. But since the announcement of the award on ABC on Thanksgiving night was so pathetic, it was only fitting that Sullivan won the 1971 Reisman. * * * * Contrary to the headline in the last issue, it is Jack Comerford who will start at forward on the freshman basketball team. * * * * Don't you think it's time we stopped standing up for the National Anthem before certain professional and collegiate athletic events? The ••tradition\ is inconsistent, since it is done before all football games but not at college basketball and baseball .games, and it only began 30 years ago, during World War II. * \' * * The Boston Celtics could win the NBA playoffs if they had a new coach;.it's ••too late\ for Tommy Heinsohn. The New York Rangers will fade before the season is oVer - there's just no way the Rangers could win - and if the Boston Bruins learned their lesson from Montreal last year, they'll win the Stanley Cup next May. * * * * Peace be with you. Former Eastern League standout and' West Texas State gteat Siminie Hill, a 6-7 forward, ran into an impeneterable brick wall called the Chicago Bulls and jumped leagues to join Dallas. The an\omalous-\\' Lenny Chappell coinbines with the even more anonymous Jones trio, Rich, Steve, atid Callis-to make the Chaps losers, however. It has been suggested that Memphis center Gerald Govan change his name. The publicity would be terrific. \Tonite the Memphis Pros, with Lew Alcindor, meet. .. \ The end result wold regrettably be the same - enough said. Second-year man Ralph Simpson has become Denver's leading scorer, Which is a big deal. Another was the one that made Alex Hannum the president, GM, and coach of the Rockets. Now, Alex has a big headache.; · Happy Leap· Year to the ABA ~uJd everyone else~ It will be his first appearance in Middlebury's Memorial Fieldhouse since le~:wing the Vermont school after the 1969-70 season. The Panthers, however, will not be pushovers -. especially if the Dutchmen come off a rough game with Bridgeport. Middlebury finished last year with three ~tr~ght ~ins ard. a 13-12 record, the best at the school in more. dian a decade. Rick Hayes, at 6-2, returns at forward and 6\'6 Russ Chapel starts at center. 6-0 sophomore· guard AI Turn~r ·is the top returning Pantner scorer, while Freshman Dave Pentkowski, a'lso 6-0, is being counted on to buoy the Middlebury attack. Bridgeport, Middlebury, and many of Union's qt4er oppauents a:re looking to higlily promising freshman recruits for help this season. The Gamet~ however, is prohibited from using first year players by the New England Small· College Athletic Conference {NESCAC). Walters is :understandably upset· at the NESCAC: ruling, but .he is most concerned about the schedule his team must play this winter. It seems that just about every one of the Garnet's opponents is improved, especially local foes RPI; Albany State, and Siena. Both the Bridgeport and Middlebury games will be broadcast live over WGY radio, 810 on the AM dial. At last - the bigti~~!
