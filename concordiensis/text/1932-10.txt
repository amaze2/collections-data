TRADITIONAL PARADE AT GAMES IS BANNED At the regular meeting of the Student Council, held on Wednes- day evening in the Faculty room of the Administration building, the Council decided to do away with freshman demonstrations between halves of football games. The un- announced change led to a great deal of speculation among the up- perclassmen at the Wesleyan game Saturday. Three new committees were ap- pointed: A dance committee con- sisting of Higgine, Dearstyne, Tur- ner, Garison and Waldron ~ ap- pointed to see that the dance regu- lations passed last :year are carried out. The other two committees form- ed Wednesday night were a com- mittee on blazere :for the council. and a committee to advance any suggestio~s to Thoe Concordiensis which are offered to the co\lncil for t}le improvement of the paper. •

J. Katzberg Reporters for this issue R. Diamond J. Rosen C. Hathaway IN RECOGN'ITION 'rhere is published elsewhere in this issue a 1im;mcial report of the department of athletics. Up9n careful study many · striking ex!l.mples .of better management and supervisi0n a!\e notice- able, Professor J'. Harold Wittner is the first head of tne athletic department. who has been able to ·conduct the department successfully. He~tvy loss- es . were realized every year, previous to the ap- pointment of Professor Wittner as head of the de- part:rnent. The athletic department realized a profit of $5,~8.06 for the ftSC:Jil year ending Ju}y :JQ, 1932; . This profit is not a result of any reliu<Jtion in \fa«ilities equipment, or materials. Many improve- \ID.ents have been brought about as a result of the effiCient maJ:).agement of Professor Wittner. New bleachers were placed on Alexander field this year at a cost of $5,226.44. 'J1b.is much needed improve- ment was brought about, mainly throug-h the ef- forts of Professor Wittner. The athletic department has made arrange- ments to have two outdoor handball courts built on the south side of the gymnasium. These courts will be of wooden construction over a concrete base. The department of athletics, under Professor Wittner, has increased it's personnel, .e11uip.ment, and facilities, at the same thne accruing a profit. This innovation if? un};leralded in precedence and is indicative of the better superv·lsion and control of the depa·rtment under it's competent head, Professor Wittner. WHO SHOULD GO TO COLLEGE? Dean Max McConn, of Lehigh University, in the September issue of The Parents' Magazine, sets forth in bold -type what is becoming recog- nized more and more as a fact, namely that \it has become apparent that oU:r .colleges, as they are, are by no means good places for every boy and girl.\ The dean, to distinguish college material from what is not, has adopted a series of seven tests or analyses, which taken as a whole, ma.y prove trustworthy. Eut first .of all, he demands that the youngster be \in some fair degree definitely bookish.\ The tests he uses as evidence are.: , 1. Has,the student an Intelligence quotient of 120 on the Binet-Stanford Test? . 2. Is the student up with his age-g!\ade 7 (A boy or girl who finishes high school at eighteen is a fair college risk.) · 3. Can the student read rapidly with under- standing? 4. Does the student possess a full vocabu- lary? 5. Does the prospective college student show some prediction far the use of dictionaries, ency- clopedias, and the like? 6. Does the prospective student sincerely want to learn more about many things? ln other words, has he numerous intellectual inte!\est? 7. Does the student exhibit a fairly high de- gree of self-mastery? If the answers to. ali these questions are yes, then, twcording to Dr. McConn, that person may be fairly assui'ed that he or she is fairly well-fit for college. But educators, at the risk or cutting down enrollment at their institutions, are recog- ni;ling that colleges are not for every boy and girl, and that \for a considerable majo.rity they are very bad places. They offer, to one pa.rticulal' type, worthwhile opportunities; to all other types TilE CONCORDIENSIS, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1932 THE BOUNDING 'BROOK Just a word ·in appraisal a1 the .strategic move in abolishing that idiotic rnarch,. that high- school d·isplay, that juvenile perfo0rmance w:hich the Union College freshmen have ·c.arried on be- tween the halves of ·our home football games :for so many years. A great many so-and-sos have that certain feeling that U:trion just can't carry on with so many traditions slipping to extinctioq, yea, utter extinction, that I think a 'traditon com- mittee should be. nominated, to meet under the Nott Elm once a week, for .the. sole purpose of sUpplanting these wise old pract-ices with new, more subtle ideas of pungent w-it, ·etc. Now for some sensible views on -the sub3ect It seems to me that when one has been at college for a few years one should have. learned how to be amused and how to take more intel'est in the cheering and more than that in the band (which, by .the way, p;ractices mast assic;luousiy, two and three times a week} and their new hats, (aren•t they a scream). Why, under old s·ol, does a:q un- organized :lot of youngsters amusE the so-and-so herd, e~peciaHy when these freshmen feel much abashed and awkward, (find we ·something wo-rse than an awkward freshman.!) and w.ho, my .. fine fat sophomore friends, a:t:e such a s0-and-so lot. younger than you are! * * * * A great dance, Indee:t,.at the' Psi U House ·sat- urday, the only trouble being that it had to fi.nish by eight bells..

S., J.r. they offer virtl,tally nothing and nmch worse than nothing, namely frustration and discouragement.\ Every college man or woman may profit by examining this list of criteria, and apply it to themselves. The results may be astounding. ~M. ]3. M. CLASS ELECTIONS Class elections were held yesterday with ·a, surprisingly small number of men taking the time to go to the polls to vote. Approximately 60 seniors voted for the officers of that class.. This is about one-third .of the class of 175 men. The other 125 men either weren't in- terested enough to go to the polls, or the belief that the presence of underhanded voting woUld make a single vote unimportant, caused a feeling of disinterestedness. As long as such ;3. small :pro.portion of .any class -is represented in the voting-, deals will exist because of the small number of votes necessary for election to an office. Elsewhere in this column is printed an excerpt from the R. P. I. paper. This ed-itorial shows that the spirit at Union football games ]s nearly nil. The same thing may· be said: of the entire undergraduate spirit at Union. This lack of spi:rit is not confined to football games. It represen.ts the undergraduate sentiment toward aU athletics. class elections, undergraduate publications, club ·organizations and all other channels of und·er• graduate activity in extra-curricular affairs. SOUR That's a funny heading for this. editorial, but it applies without contradiction to .t1J.at small mi:n- ority of the student body who do nothing but complain of the records of our tea~ns and criticb:e the efforts of the men on the teams, their man- aging and coaching. Fifty .per cent of this minority never see our teams play. The other half go to the games in the same spirit that the old Romans went to the arena, during the early Christian era. Is th.Js the Rensselaer Spirit? Last. year, during the Union :f()otball game a small group of Rensselaer supporters equaled, and at times thunder.ed down the \()lume of Union cheering. Regardless of whether the team !()St. or gained ground, they re~eived encouraging sup- port from the side lines. That suppol't is tc:io often missing at our games, particularly at home. The men on the field may never hear those cheers in the heat of the game, but ,to an outsider they are an indication of either an enthusiastic body of men who have pride in, and a sincere af- fection f(}r the name of R,ensselaer,. or a group of sour undergraduates who 3!re dying .of dead rot from the inside. You chronical knocker::;, if you won't S!J.Y a good word for the teams, do,n't say anything at all. If you can't cure yourl)elf of dissatisfaction don't drip the germs of your disease al,hong the freshman and uncontamih::j.ted upperclassmen, its contageous, especially to the frosh, for they wont be immune untiJ they }rave' been here long enough to catch the· proper scho.ol spirit, Instead, prac- tice an esprit de corps, that will measure up to the true ·spirit of Rensselaer. Tllere is none higher nor finer. Rensselaer Polytechnic. Pointing the way to the ,adverttsed brand Many a \sa:Ie'' made by advertising has gone to a competitor because the purchaser did not know where to buy the advertised brand. Tele- phone men evolved a plan to make it easy to find. They created a. \Where to Buy It\ service in the classified telephone directory. There- beneath the advertised trade marks..,_ Buick, Goodrich, RCA Victor, General Electric and many others now list authorized local dealers. Thus telephone men complete the chain between advertiser and consumer -increase the effectiveness of advertis:.. ing ~ help manufacturers and dealers to increase sales-help consumers to get what they want! Because they apply vision to subscribers' prob- lems, Bell System men continually increase the value of telephone serv-ice.

Rosen G. Melinette C. ll:~thaway M. Berger DEALS AND IDEALS Last Wednesday evening the chief topic of discusslon at the Student Council meeting was the conduct of the class elections. Elver since the nominations had been made and announced, the campus l!ad teemed .. with rumors of impending \deals\ an>d political agreements. As it was, the councilman in charge of the polls were under in- struction to keep a sharp look-out for evidences of \deals.'' The senior class cast its ballots with- out the slightest indication of fraud, and the sop- homore class after a careful scrutiny was ab- solved. There were, however, definite proofs that the junior class election had been tampered with by camp11s politicians. When tb,e tellers found that over twenty bal- lots of the class of 1934 were identical, and that a score or so more C()l'responded with the exception of a sing1e name or two, the ba;llots were care- fully put aside. ThE Student Council, after exam- ining the suspected votes, then questioned the candidates whose names were on the ballots. Without a. dissenting voice the councilmen agreed that there was all the evidence of a \deal.'' Just how far the candidates were implicated could not be determined, but their feeble explanations were not at all convincing. The Council decided to temper jmstice with mercy, and ordered a new slate no111.inated, and a new election. No names will be 'barred from nominations, but all voters will be rE()Uired to sign tbeir ballots. No action will be taken against the men wh.o have been suspected upon this occasion, but in the future stringent measures will be applied to pre- vent anyo-ne :implicated in a \deal\ from holding any position of trust or importance on the campus. It is indeed a sad state of affairs when the shadiest .<Jf political tactics can be disguised be- hind an excuse of rivl'!-lry between on and off- campus m_en, when the Union students are divided into two :factions each seeking to stab the other in the pae-:k. This sentiment of rancor is carefully and arti:tleially kept alive and nourished by insid- ious propaganda and whispering campaigns among tlle alumni and undergraduates alike. For the majol.\ part of the college year the fraternities work together harmoniously, but with the coming· of rushing season and the advent of class elec- tions, nun who are boon com:Panions and bosom friends s\Iddenly begin to iook with suspicion and distrust !l.t their e:rstwhile associates. This is a strange ~~;nomaly in a small college like Union where br~therhood and friendUness should pre- vail. Way do we strive to inculcate into our freshmen a feeling ,of amity by practically forcing them to greet other undergraduates if we are to nullify all our effo1ts to promote comradeship by an insidious rivalry between off-campus and on- campus n::J.en? Let .iJs. as intelligent Union mer1 cease this childish bickering between factions. There are reasons why one fraternity or group Should be mo11e friendly with some groups than with others, but there is not tlte slightest excuse for insisting; that a :f~w fraternities are natural and avowed enemies ,tJf any other houses eitber on or off the campus. • The present, Student Council has taken a lenient view of the whole unfortunate affair, but it has determined to exert its utmost J!Owers THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1932 THROUGH Y.HE. KEYHOLE Fatigued and weary, that is how [ :feel at present. Why, simply because I have J>een r.un- ning down au clues as to wher·e .and in what direc- tion the Gossip family went. About •to give up, in utter dispair, I discovered Mr. GossiJ>· right in our own library doing some :research work. Yes ind:eed, he was busily eng,aged with \Life~' and \Vanit.y Fair.\ Final·ly t was successfully able to divert his 'studious pursu;;~.;rrce and he beg~n to act in the :familar role. The Phi Delts got a great thrin ,last Saturday afternoon during the fo.otball ga;mr,. Yes, they saw Bus Dill tear through the Wesleyan line and scamper off for a 50-yard run and place. M:r, Pig's garment in a position for a touchdown. On Sun- day night ,the same group of feUows were •given the scare of their lives. Messrs .. Dill, Higgins and Caye escaped probably certain ,death as the resq1t of an automobile accident on the Sarat..oga..;Sche- nectady rDad. They were escorting home several students from an \Institution\ north of .b,ere when their prog,ress was impeded.

Listen yo'll fellows, all t can say is I'm glad you're all well, but for goodness sake, .. thiuk of the gate rece~pts, here at Union. I was informed that a prominent professor accompanied by his wife were guests of the Beta Theta Pi Bouse a few nights ago. The. professor's wife was relating how strangely built and large shouldered the German girls are. Also. that they thought .that she was a. bag of bones. lM!r. Sutter from the head of the table, replied, \Why that is indeed very true, I couid have told you so!' '['hat conversati<>n was up Sutter's ailey aUright. From the positon which I occupied up in the bleachers last Saturday I thought that those two hard ,playing warriors Finch at center ·a,nd Seme- rad at quarter played a great game. L:at.er when I had the opportunity to hear the opinion of the crowd I was convinced that they Played> very well. For a cha;nge l thought the same way the crowd did. Deals, deals, a few more deals and I suppose that crowd might have been able to ,get all four aces in the deck. Why of course I'm not referring to the bridge game last night. Didn't you know that the .Junior class elections have been declarecl very, v:ery, and thrice I say very dishonest? Yes indeed, the Student Council has put on the Sher- lock Holmes outfit and boY they have the .spot light on the right gang. I'm afraid the light is too hot for any of the politicans to play with. Say if that .gang of politicians gai~ed pro~inence they would probably seek a professorship .for one of thE'ir favorites. Do you .recall the trite phrase, \or die in. the attempt?\ Well, in this ease they died befare they could attempt to act. The au- topsy should reveal startling data. President Day expressed the opinion that it would be a fine thing if all of the fraternities were represerthld in that great old Interfraternity Coun- cil some day. You know I was just reealling how many more years Niagara will continue to fall. -Tee Pee. to punish.. those who seek to bring about a repeti- tion of this senseless strife. Let us hope that there will be no opportunity for the council t() intervene in either c.ff-campus and on-campus riv-alry or the conduct of class elections. Let us learn from our mistakes and strive to avoid any reeurrence of the disastrous events of this past weeik. ~Thomas :J. Wade. THE INTEBliRATERNITY COUNClL The Jnterfraternity Council has d~seended in- to a position of unimportance. The meetings have developed into a number of \bull sessions,'' accomplishing little, if any good. Ali;h.ougb the members support the council by their attendance, practically no constructive work is ac-c()mplished. The most important task before -the cc.uncil last yaar and again this year was an<l js the prob- lem of rushing. After many weak attempts to es- tablish a uniform system of rushing, the r.esults were nil~ Various plans were proposed,, .but none of these were adequate enough in their scope to obtain the complete support of the representative houses. ... Systems of rushing are used at other colleges which have proved satisfactory, but 'tltere is ,an apparent. lack of initiative here. No one has of- fered a plan :which is able to obtain \the support of the ~tud~nt body, Other colleges have the same obstacles to. face as are present at Union, and they are faced and worked ,upon to the satis- faction of everyone. The Interfraternity .councU adopt-ed a .set of dance rules last spring. These rules are satisfac- tory from a theoretical standpoint, b:td they have never been enforced. Tb•S is due to no· otner rea. son thatl' the lack of abUity on the part of the council. The council recently . was presen:ted with a plan of co-operative buying among the· fraternities. Although the plan offered a possible means ot economl:z:irtg, the council shunned the res}JtJnsibil~ ity of carrying through the plan or :rejecting it, by the aJlpointment of the Steward's douncil, This is only one of ,tnany evidences of it's vvel).kne~s and lack of Jlower.

The Student Council was elected by undergraduates, to regulate. student affairs. The Council is representative and democratic, in spite of anything that may be sai«!l' to the contrary. ~fter a .careful investigation of the junior cla,ss elections, the entire Council was convinced by conclusiv~ evidence of the existence of a deal. qnly. after a complete investigation, which includ- eCl testimony by upper . class . members of the I1ouses in valved, were accusations made. Upon bein,g brought before the Student Council to ans~ wet the charge placed upon them, the <J,CCUS~ed naturally denied all guilt or participation in the crini~.. Their testimony was weak and uncon- vin~ing hi the face of the existing evidence. As ·a .result, in pursuance of the responsibility JYlaced. Upon it by the student body, in the adop- tien of its constitution, the Council decided upon the punishment for these men guilty of using un- .fair mean.s of gaining class offices. Realizing the embarrasing positions into which these men would be placed, the Council de- cided to be as lenient as posr:;ible, by not publiciz- ing the names and houses of the men involved. The smallest punishment possible was placed up- on the men, namely the elimination of their names from any class offices. The Student Council was founded to promote undergraduate <~,uthority, and to act as a med.ilJm of arriving at undergraduate e:111pression in deal- ings with the administration. This responsibility has been placed in the hands of the Council, and if it is to function prQPerly and for the best inter- ests of all undergraduates, action such as has jt,\;;i been taken, must be supported and enforced by the student oo~y, if Union is to have a stable form of undergraduate government. SEATING AT FOOTBALL GAMES There hav:e been several criticisms voiced by the students in regard to the way ~he football game ~was ·Conducted last Saturday, l:mt one fa(lt that should be brought to the attentjort of the under- graduates, as well as to the administration, is that the new seating ::~.rrangement ·that has been creat- ed is wholly inadequate and un&.uccessful. This is true not only from .the point .of view of the students, but also the visitors who attend the games. Those of the undergraduate body who have enough interest· in the Union games to lend their support by sitting in the cheering section and helping ·the team along find themselves crowd- ed and uncomfortable. The space reserved for the students is niueh too limited even for those who do come. The tax which the student pays at his registration is the monetary basis without which the athietic events at the college would be con- ducted with a serious financial loss. Certainly the tax is of sufficient amount that the Jlayer should receive as good a seat as· the v-isitors. It is true, of course, that a student may .ex- change his pass book for a teserved seat ticket, but this results in a .scattering of the undergrad- uates that is far from being conducive to a strong, spirited cheering section. It is difficult for the cheerleaders to secure the co-operation of the THE CONCORDfENSIS, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1932 YE BD.UN:DING BROOKE Heavens~What: an a·mount of data concern· ing campus functions there is? .A Student Bodv meeting yesterday morning provided us. witia enough i.nformation to carry on fitrent conversa- tion fer weeks. However, let us ·first touch a cou- • , pl<.> of matters, the former being of grea;t impor- · tance. · On Friday evening, ·Oct0ber 28th, the night be- fo.Pe the Williams game .theve· is to be a pep meet\ ing at the Plaza theater~that is if the s,tudent boay w.m be O\lt to back it up,~and there is no reason why it 'shouldn't, 'as l'a!'lt years' rally was very successful unti~ Ruth Chatterton was fiashel'l on· tl).e SGreen . in a very unfortUnate role, causing siUy little .a:t:~.tics and twitters from those ,of the student body vyho simply couldn't restrai'n them- ~:?elves, 'l'his yE;lar, however, the Pl'az·a theater ha:J guaranteed a: mo.re ap;pvopriate picture,· \All· American,\· with Richard Arlen. and twenty .AU- American~ players; i'Bcludl:ng son1e bird by the name of Booth. The band~God bless 'em-wm piay two symphonies thru-0ut; the Glee club will sing a few college songs; there wHl be :a cheer :E01• the team, captain and coach; no, speeches, but a good .snappy meeting with plenty of spirit which will be foHowE)d by a .fine· picture~au of which WiU be for the paltry sm;:n of fifteep· cents~or so! Please think this over and we cart discuss, it next week. * * * * Poor Bill Ketz is down in the cooler with no one ,to bail him out, for .giving dope to the Colgate cross country team last :Saturday. Reports are that they dropped in on >the Phi Delts for a few rubbers of bridge on their way out-Some ,of them are said to ha¥e attended the Skidmore tea-dance. One got ,Jost and. was reported to have been seen milking a cow in a field near Poughkeepsie, whi-le anothet finished third in a meet over at R. P. I.! However, we must congratulate Ernie Capelle and his team for their tine victory, and also Uncl'e Bill Ketz :who Ketz them into condition to win so de- cisevely. * * * * N@W for the campus deals-Some remarks sounded as though they might have been emitted f·rom the mouth of a two-year old child, but I sup- pose al'lowances alWays have to be made. \Baa• Baa-naughty Student Coundl can't pu,nish me for making deals. ·because there isn't anything in the ninety-fifth amendment in the constitution of the year thre~ which gives them permission to castigate us for making deals-Baa-Baa.\ Now, of course, I don't know, and I reaHy shouldn't venture, but doesn't that id:ea sound a trifle mor- onic? \Vox Populi\ is all right with me, but when a vox like that speaks I oftEn wonder h0w it is let in the doors. It seems to In€ that the Student Council is comprised of enough brains to carry out most ben!)ficially, the necessary business of the student body as a wh0le, and not for an indi- vidual group, or for a fraternity; and why, so help me, do we have to listen to such idiotic cracks when all that is wanted by the Student Council and many others is the a:]:)olition of deals, and they have the power to abolish it as they see fit, if it is not for the goo.d of the students, confine your deal- ings to cards. * * * * Another amusing subject brought up yester- day morning was the question of the Social Tax. Our round-faced editor-in-chief exchanged hrs ideas in a very friendly manner with those of Bob Murray. Our editor-in-cn.ief with the round face looked at the matter in a colle.ctive financial way~(he would)-Bob Murray in a collective un- financial way-If they had voted on the tax, and everybody came, I was a~ready to put in my bid for a booth in the far north east corner of the downstairs bath room, or .perhaps .we might have been able to work a deal and been offered half of the swbnming p.ool! Bob's impression was that ninety million people, no less, would attend the function, and would be dancing in the handball room, around the building, on the field and even in the lockers. On the other hand, a seven dollar bill lool\:s pretty large at the end of May-ask Dick Forbes about it! * * * * Next week your columbist will prl)mise you some amusing yarn;S, as he expects to go to Mon- treal over the week-E;md, if somebody doesn't go back on him.

Considering the question fro~ the point of view of those who visit the g•ames or .are brought by somE of the students, it is most disconcerting and irritating to have the .first <;lUa:r.ter of the con- test practically ruined by the persistent demand<; of usb.ers to the students seated unrightfully in the reserv~d section, \Where's your stub?\ It is little won<ter that with :;;tudents, ushers, and late arrivals blocking clear vision of the spectators, the athletic department has a diffkult time sell- ing reserved seat tickets. Anyone whe pays the am~ount required for such a seat should have the guarantee .of a comfortable p.osit~on. If the seci;ioh for the students was enlarged so that there would be plenty of voom foil all who wished to sit in the cheering sectio.n, and if the students 'WOUld then refrain from taking posses- sion of the seats which are seld to visitors as re- served seats, the present condition would ~e great-- ly ameliorated. ~D.c.w.

The score was 12-0. Perhaps the Un.ion eontingen.t iH jast siow in· getting uRder way. In 1931' the first two contests were totally unpromising for t'he Union teairo:, but in \the end the season prov:ed highly profitable. Just at present, what is most needed on the Union combimatian i,s a leader,· a first-class driv:er, who will extract every hidden ounce of power from the baekfield. Coach Hatfield ha:s been trying every possible combin- ation, hoping that such a leader ' wil'l turn up. Garn.et :faJ.l£1'.l~t .!:Q.t~rcept!l~. The passing game, which dur.ing the scrimmage session prov-ed high- ly effectiv:e, failed utterly on Satur- day. The Garnet backfield at- tempted 16 throws amd completed only five, none of them for start- ling gains. Frequently the Am- herst safety men intercepted Un- ion passes. Amherst, on the other band, attempted nine passes, com- pleting feur, one of which netted them their fi:rst touchdown. Captain Cadigan, who starred for the Bay Staters; threw a leng pass to Curtis, an end, who ran about ten yards for a score. This was the feature play of the con- test. Cadigan led both combina- tions in ground-gaining. He car- ried the ball 21 times and gained 58 yards. Arn.herst gained a total of 234 yards through the line and' 37 yards in the air. Union netted 51 yards by rushing and 22 yards by passing. The summary: LE LT LG c RG RT AMHERST UNION Moses _______________ Finegan Feinberg ------------ WaldrGn Skiles __________________ Singl.:.

F'our Music By RANKINE HINMAN On.e of the new hymns tried last Friday was written to mustc from Mendelsohn's \Songs \Without Words.\ These exquisite numbers, which were written to help restore ptano-forte to its proper rank, are among the most popular of Mendel- sohll's work, possibly to his detrJ- ment, for many people ose sight of his greater works, such as the Eli- Jah and St. Paul oratories, and con- sider these graceful, finished do- mestic pieces to be the measure of his ability. However it is to these song:s, written with such themes as \Con.solation\ and \Certainty that he owes the love which the English peoples have for him. Next Friday Professor Tidmarsh will play the Dance Macabre of Saint-Saens, which was on Sunday's prog:ram. At the Sunday morning service the choir sang as the invocation the Bacb chorale, \Now Let Every 'I:'ongue Adore Thee,\ from the can- tata, \Sleepers Awaks,\ using Dr. A. T. Davison's arrangement for the Harvard Glee Club. When last year Dr .. Norwood heard the choir sing \Jerusalem he was so im- pressed with the beauty and glory of tbe work that he requested his choir at St. Bartholomew's to use it, \Jerusalem set to music by C. Hubert Parry, is from William Blake's \Prophetic Books.\ The Cleveland Symphony Or- chestra is appearing in Albany, De- cember 1st, under the auspices of the Albany Civic Music associa- tion. Students procuring member- shills in the local body (student dues are two-dollars and a half) will therefore be able to hear this body-- without additional expense, as memberships are good in any city where Civic Music exists. The As- s<>ciation will bring a symphony orchestra for one of the three local concerts provided the membership does not drop below that of last year. We were delighted with the sing- ing of varsity songs during the g-arne Saturday and heard many favorable comments in the West stands, but could not help wishing there could have been more pep and enthusiasm in them. The Alma Mater sounded like a dismal hymn. Students are wont to criticize the band, but that body at least looks colorful. Both band and singing were an improvement over the Wesleyan game, however. Let's hope for a still better showing when: Williams comes. I Easy ntt t4e fyes ] 000 The Union backs who try to wade through the left side of the Hobart line next Saturday are go- ing te find themselves up to their knees in vowels and consonants. For they will be met by three men whose last names average ten let- ters each: Trumbatore, end, Ehren- feld, tackle, and Foehrenbach, guard. What a chore for the line- up typesetters! In baseball box scoves those lads would soon be- come Tr'b't're, Eh'f'ld, and Fo'n'b'- ch. 000 Some strange things have come out of the depression, Watch Princeton's freshman football team, for instance. So many upperclass- men are said to have failed to re- turn to college that one hundred extra freshmen are admitted. Now among the extra hundred there just happen to be a startling numb~r of pre}l school stars who might othei- wise have found the examination bars, too high to hurdle. ..And so, said Uncle Wiggly ..•• 000 Believe it or not, Kansas has on its varsity team this fall a pair of twin brothers named Ham- mer, and nicknamed Trip and Sledge. On place-kicks, if you are interested, it is Sledge who holds the ball, while Trip kicks it. 000 When Marquette players want water, they get it quicker than any other footballers in the wide, wide world. For the pail is toted.. by none other than the dusky Ralph (Olympic Rabbit) Metcalfe, a stlldent, but not a football player, at M:a1·quette. It isn't a lack of heft, for Ralph weighs 180. But his world-beating sprinting-legs are too v-aluable to risk on the gridiron. And since everyone around Mar- quette games asks after Ralph, he serves the team as No. 1 water boy. 000 \Student Disguised as Cow Cros:ses Russian Frontier,\ says an THE CONCORDIENSIS, TUESDAY, OCTOBER U, 1932 item from Vilno, Poland.

UNION STUDENT NEWS SERVICE With the sphere of jobs offered college stu- dents by town 1llerchants narrowing down to an abstract pciint, we enthusiastically greet the new~ ly .organized Union Students News Serv:ice which will solicit su:bscriptions and distribute periodicals on the campus. We hope that comparable organ- izations to handle such services as laundry, tailor, floweTs, and dance music, win be formed on the -campus so that permanent jobs will be .available fcrr ambitious students who want to \work their way through.\ The idea of student co,..operative orgahizati'ons is not new. Such colleges· as Cornell and Prince- ton have had .them for more than 25 years. .Last month Mr. Enzer studied the system at Conell wlrere a new building was purchased by the stu- dent co-op. He has adopted some of the things done at Cornell to Union College. The success of the Union Student News Service will determine whether or not student organizations will be in- augurated to handle the other types of service on the campus. In giving permission to use a portion of SUll- man hall as headquarters for the U.S.N. S., Dean Garis has provided it with the necessary physical facilities. This will probably encourage the for\' mation of the other types. of co-op organizations on the ·campus. We believe that students should receive some of the revenue from the large business given to dealers. The co-op is mutually advantageous to both students and dealers because it will give more intel'ligent service to the students them- selves, some revenue to others, and offer an or- ganized means of promotlon of business among· the students for the dealers repvesented. l ' THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 14, 1932 Peeping Thru the Key·hole Seen while strolling:-Severa.l varsity men to~ether.

A year's test of Chica,go's e~per'i!nentai depar- ture 'has brought g:ra.ti£:ying e:q>eriences and re- sults.

The health authorities of the institution give t:hem a bette.r physical .rat- ing. That th.e old ·instructional and examination system wasted time for SOI:l.le students has been demonstrated by the fact that in the last year fourteen passed one or more of tne CJomprehensive examinations without taking the courses which led up to them. One gratifying evidence of student interest is to be ;found in the fact that although attendance at classes is no longer required, regularity in at- tendance has not suffered.

F'vur THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, OCTOBER }4;, 1932 Four Teams Compete Tomorrow; Three Here FOOTBALL TEAM TO MEEJ ROBART AWAY Garnet Will Oppose Strong Geneva Outfit in First Visit- ing Game of Season The Union Col- lege eleven left this afternoon for Geneva, N. Y., where it will in- vade the Hobart gridiron tomor- row afternoon in its first visiting conte~t of the year. The Garnet team will stop overnight at Syracuse, getting in- to 'Geneva early on Saturday. Hobart is not by any means the easy opponent which it has been rated f()r the past four years. The little Geneva combination held a powerful N. Y. U. team to a 33-0 count this year. Last yea.:r; the Un- ion team trounced the Hobart elev- en by the same score~ Last week Hobart .played a 13-13 tie with Ken- yon College. Five letter men will start against Union tomorrow. Sam Seader,. captain, will this year be seen at fuilback. He played end last year. George Harer, one of the most val- uable backfield cogs in this year's machine, played fullback last sea- son. · He now is stationed at half- back. Clack and Gilman, two lines- men, are also veterans. J:;tussell :Saker, quarterback, was drawn from ,iast year's frosh combination. Changes in Union Line Coach Hatfield has put his squad through an unusually strenuous week. He scrimmaged the team three · successive days and was lucky to get away with few injur- ies. As a result of the past week's experiments, he has made one or two slight changes in the line. Gerry Barnett, who has been sta- tioned at tackle, wiH be seen in the center of the line tomorrow. Clark Prather will play tackle with Don Moulton. Tefft will start again at guard with J\cheson on the other side of the line. Finch, sophomore center, may, how.ever, take one of the guard posts. Mur- ray, who has been on the injured list, will play end with Finegan as his running mate.

Si.v In the Mail (Continued from page 5) by the founder himself. Thus why condem a system which never has been tested in modern times? '.L'hird: The author has compared personality to machinery and has made the stupendous declaratian that \religion is doomed if . . . . \ He forgets that John Watson's school is practically forgotten, that human nature has changed very little, if any, in two thousand years, and that the Christian church (particularly the Roman Catholic, of which I am not a mem- ber) has been constantly proving that a literal interpretation of the Bible in regard to living is the soundest guide to living. Fcmrth: Fundamental Christian- ity will not \fail to gain the regard of college men.\ The editorial writer can not 1be blamed for hold- ing the opinion he does because he has no doubt seen nothing but so- called modernistic Christianity in practice, 0r rather in an attempt at practice. Several students on the campus can testify to the pragma- tism of their Christian faith by changed lives. How many philos- ophies have ever been accountable for changing numberless lives from the disillutionment of life as a ·mere existence to the pulsating, joyful living for others as set forth in the scriptures? Fifth: Religion, as known by the average college man, may be the \science of life,\ but true Christian- ity is the science of living. The principles propounded by Jesus Christ must be experienced in life before they can be judged. If every student were to experience this new life, there would be no \de- crease in religious activities in American colleges.\ The modern theologian cannot check this de- crease because lives are changed from within. The modernist has a social doctrine to preach; the fundamentalist has a personal doc- trine. The majority of Union under- graduates will recall Mr. Machen's address to the student body last March and Will .. verify the state- ment that he was one of- the most 'enthusiastically received speakers .of the past year.: The aim of the 'League of Evangelical Students is to propound and defend the doc- trines set forth in the Scriptures. This necessarily cannot be well done through the mail but requires personal discussion. The Union ·chapter is desirous of ineetin~ all '\t'udents who are interested in this '!!ttJ>ject, pro. ·o~ cion. · Othniel A., Pendleton, Jr., '33 FRATERNITY PROBLEM A fraternity problem that often causes.distress to chapter members .is that of the Friday quizzes and ; exams which usually follow the day after meeting night. Although tha -administration has co-operated with the campus groups by making Thursday nigllt clear so that no activities will conflict with meet- ings, the fact that these Friday ex- aminations still' ~onti~ue make the night a poor one from the student's point of view. Because of Union's Monday-Fri- day system it is almost inevitable that quizzes and the majority of exams fall on Friday or else at the end of the Tuesday-Thursday-Sat- urday sessions. Therefore both Thursday and Friday nights are inconvenient. Then, to keep the meeting placed approximately in the middle of the school week (which seems to have been one of the reasons for select- ing Thursday as fraternity night), Wednesday is the best possibility. It precedes a day which is usually free from examinations and does not necessitate much shifting of Wednesday night activities. Considering the other possibili- ties leaves Tuesday night out, since on that evening several club meet- ings and the like are scheduled. Monday night is a common lecture night and conflicts with debating, among other things. In the final analysis, accordingly, Wednesday night is the most con- venient for students, activities, ancl administration alike (that is, as far as I can ascertain.) For that rea- son I suggest consideration by the various fraternities of the feasibil- ity of holding meetings on that night with the ultimate idea of bringing the matter before the Stu- dent Council. J. SAIDEL, '33. At Whittier College there is an annual affair called a Sunbeam Party. Classes are called off, shirts come off too, and the prize goes to the fellow with the reddest hide. THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, OCTOBRR 14, 1932 Chess Club To Meet Other CoUege Teams The Chess club held its first meeting of the year Tuesday even- mg in the library of the General Engineerh1g Building. George Dun· can, president of the club, an- nounced the plans for the coming year. A team will be formed to meet the chess teams of neighbor- ing colleges and societies. It will be remembered that the Union team made its debut last year by defeating the R. P. I. team, 5 to 3. An hmovation thi£ year will be chess classes for the instniCtion of the beginners and advanced players. Any student wishing to learn the game is invited to attend t11e meetings held on the second, and fourth Tuesdays of the month.

Painter Reporters. Contributing to this Issue: C. Hathaway R. Diamond K. Young G. Melinette C. Thomas THE PRESIDENTIAL POLL The first week's results of the presidential poll show that Hoover has a very noticeable lead for the presidency, from tli.e point of view of Union men. It is also shown by the results, that very few of the students of Union college will take the time to fill out the poll pu.blished in last week's issue of The Concordiensis, and turn it in to the paper~ There is a distinct lack of ipterest shown at Union in regard to affairs of this nature. The same is true of the spirit shown in clubs and meetings. This certainly reflects upon the collegP. and its student body. No one has taken the initiative to form a po- litical club, in spite of the fact that the national committees will supply all necessary materials, including speakers. Notice was sent out at Wes- leyan :for all men interested in joining a \Hoover for President\ club, to meet last Monday. As a result of this, more than 150 rnen joined the club. A \Thomas for President\ club is also being formed there with Norman Thomas as one of the speakers. What is there about the undergraduate spirit here at Union which smothers any enthusiasm which might be inherent within its members? Perhaps there isn't any spirit to be smothered. UNIO:N TAiffiS THE LEAD We are glad to see that the administration at Union has set a national precedent by establish- ing a .four-year course in foreign languages for technic:H students~ This innovation was brought about so that engineers might retain their knowledge of the foreign language, which they wish to elect, be- yond the time taken in study. It has been the custom at Union, like most other colleges, to re- quire a technical student te take one year of a foreign language for five hours a week. With this system, the engineer usually labors through the year of study, to nearly completely forget it by the time of graduation. Engineers who enter the foreign field will find this especially beneficial. They will leave college with a fair knowledge of a foreign lang- uage, To remove the possibility of extra work, the administration has changed the course from five hours to a single hour per week. Many technical schools do not include any foreign language in their curriculum. The fac- ulty at Union believes that a foreign language will be of added value to the student after grad~ uation, from an engineering as well as a cultural point of view. OUR BAND The band is no longer an eyesore at feotball games. There was a time, not so many years ago, when many wished that the band would be abol- ished from Union's extra-curricular activities. The band is now a credit to the college, thanks to the tireless efforts of Professor Male. It now boasts of nearly fifty members, and can be heard practicing on any Monday night. It K. A. Ki;ppleby, wha is generally :\mown around the eampus 3$ \Kippy;\ and is the Kap's dawg, has !Lost his license, ·and if anyone should cha.nce upon it while erring about grounds or other places,, J. W. Bonnell, who is sort. of a god- fathe~:\ to the above mentioned canine, would greatly appr\eciate it if that one would ·return the lost article to the Kap Lodge-to:Ute de suite- as Kippy is more or less on bounds until he re- ceives his little number back. \'' * * * As for ·eollege activities: ·There appears to ibe a very scaitty amount of tattle. The Glee club still boasts ·Of about :seventy head and has a tine repertoire of appeaHng music on which it is work- ing most assiduously three. and four times a week. The choir sounds better than it has ·for three or four years, because it has :fj.naUy dawned upoh a few of the ehoristers that watching and listening to what Pr()f. Tidmarsh has to say does helP to bring about .more favorable results, The Mounte- banks have already started work on their Decem- ber producU.on and, shauld have it in :fine shape with six weeks' of rehearsals. Bus Park:er would have been about as useful at a checker match as he was last s·aturday at Hobart. Owing to a rack of equipment and man- agerial strategy, Parker arrived at the field with sponges plastered around his neck for shoulder guards, and his trousers looked as though they might have been a comfortable size for Mitzi Green. Whe:n he ·came in the game as. end, the Hobart team gave up all hope exclaiming, \What next? The managers?\ * * \' * Last week the campus was graced by the un- called-for ap:pea:cance of five or six feminine tie artists, who actual·lY came around to the :various houses for the purpese of selling ties. They were horrible look]ng (yes, yes, the ties), with the ex- ·Orbitant priee of one dollar tacked onto each purchase. The only trouble of it was that after the boys c&nvinced the travelling saJ'esw:omen that they thought the display was. no less than rotten, the :fair maidens persisted in hanging around for a: half day more. * * * * We picke-d up a copy of the Wesleyan Argus the other day and were amused by a story tell- ing of the exploits of seven Wesleyanites who conducted an evening service at a nearby chur.ch. Despite the fact that one member of the congre- gation fainted, the service went off well. This might serve as a new field of activity for the Evangeli.cal League. It might be well, however for a follow-up squad of pre-meds. to go along with the boys. H. W. S., .JR. has a large repertoire .of college songs as weU as many spirited marches. The unif&rms of the band look very neat and help to give visitors a good impression af the college. More men are ahxious to compete for positions, which is conducive to the greater ability of its membe-rs. It no longer has to take as members any man who has ever owned or can borrow an instrument, but is able to choose among the m()st versatile muHcians for its mem- bership. THE CASE FOR MODERATION \Pass\ and \fail\ are relatively meaningless words to stu-dent \Number One\ as another school year is hitting its stride. Social life goes its merry whirl, hectic days of rushing, and rush- ing parties come and go,. and the professor be- • comes the tyrant who expects his course to be done .above all other, and more important, con- siderations. Student \N.iJ.mber Two;\ somewhat more ex- perienced, allows himself to be persuaded, t~ de- sert the .path of learning, promising inwardly to make up for til.e breach at some early date, albeit realizing that the date in mind may not mater- ialize. Finally, in the great minority, comes student \Number Three,\ who has come to Syracuse Uni- versity to attain a cultural background, and who means to have- it despite all other sacri:fices he may be required to make. The fallacy- in each of the three types is evi- dent after slight consideration. \Number One,\ finds that social 'life interferes with his studies, and promptly drops the studies without any at- tempt to salve his conscience. \Number Two\ student soft-soap.s himseif into believing that he is capable of cramming the work of week~ i~to one night. Student \Number Three'.' sets 1ns aim in life, and makes every effort to attain it, sacri- ficing pleasures, outside interests, and invaluab~e experience in wending his \narrow\ wa~. This student loses out too, forgetting that moderation is one .of the main virtues in life. -SYRACUSE DAILY ORANGE. Desert air is wet • • • by comparison·!

Four l Music By RANKINE HINMAN --------..-.....----- Those whG had their radio dials turned to W.JZ or WEAL Sunday evening from. 6-7 P. M., were fortu- nate in hearing a very perfect ren- dition of Dvorak's, the New World Symphony by the Cleveland Sym- phony orchestra; the last two movements were by far the best portion of thoe program. In the face of cE-rtain cr.iticism, your colu:tnmst. states his poreference for Rudolf Ringwald, who conducted, to Niko- lai Sololov. Two more pvograms will be give-n at the same hour, next Sunday and one week from Sunday. We are glad that Professor Tid- marsh is giving us medern music as well as the acknowledged mas- terpieces; Each, Beethoven, Wag- ner were experimental and not at first appreciatecl; many of our con- temporary composers deserve to be heard. We may net enjoy or un- derstand miLch of the new music upoll first hearing it; we notice that when Stokowski presented Werner Josten's symphonic poe1n, \Jungle over three-quarters of his audience departed before the sec- ond playing,; and we also notice that at the next concert over 25 per cent remained for its repetition and at the third concert a treme'1- dous ovation compelled him to re- peat the wor':k. The anthem at Sunday chapel, \Ye Watche1·s and Ye Holy Ones\ was an interesting example of the stirring effects that can be procur- ed by having- the tenors and bases singing against each Gther. The first part was a canen; Professor T1d:marsh made the second part, arranged for unison singing, anti- phonal. We nete taat the only American composition to draw an enthusias- tic response at the Internationai Festival of Venice, in September, was Gershwin's piano concerto in F a number very similar in style t~ the \Rhapsody in Blue.\ \Tr.e robust final movement, with its contagious rhythmic vitality an,l exuberant. youthful dynamism was one of the most rousing suc- cesses of the Festival,\ writes Ray- mond Hall. 000 Nothing niggardly about the Boston Sunda.y Herald. They gave the score as Unien 52, Hobart 6. Maybe that was before Hobart de- manded a recuunt?

Professor CAMPAIGN SIDELIGHT An interesting sidelight in the presidential campaign is the news that James Roosevelt, father of Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt, was a Union graduate in the da13s of 1847 with the degree of A.B. and later that of .A.M. He was a mem- ber of the Delta Phi fraternity. After graduation Mr. Roosevelt became actively engaged in coal and railway interests. He was vice-president of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Co .. , and later was also connected with hospital an~ charity ass.ociations. The father of the presidential candidate died in 1900, his last add:r;ess being Hyde Park, N.Y. ~~~ I \President Hoover has stood The Republican party, declared Hale was also I'elated to Edward ' adamant against undue curr~ncy Professor Wainger, maintains the Everett and Harriet Beecher Stowe. inflation such as has been advo- policy of \keep the government out In addition to his literary and THE CONCORDIENSIS PRESIDENTIAL POLL (Continued on page 3) . of b{isiness, while the Democratic scholarly work, Dr. Hale had an party points out that \the govern- active interest in many things.

Hathaway ON POLITICS Nearly half of the student body has cast bal- lots for The Concordiensis presidential straw bal- lot. Hoover has a very decided lead over the other candidates, but more- than this fact is shown by the poll. It is shown by the poll that the greater part of Union College is interested in the government of the country, and in its leaders. The enthusiasm shown by the supposed pres- entation of the three platforms in assembly is in- dicative of the interest which is being taken by undergraduates in the political questions of the day. The status of politics is slowly changing- in America. The soap box orator, with his meaning- less words, has _disappeared, as a result of the gradual education of the American people. People are beginning to make a more complete study of parties and .platforms, rath.er than accept orator's praises without question. Soap box oratory is being supplanted by the presentation of facts, and political leaders realize the futility of temporary enthusiasm as a result of a great strain upon the emotions. Instead, methods of education are used, as a more perma- nent means of recruiting men and women into the parties. The position of esteem and respect to which many of our political leaders have l'isen is indi- cative of the ri:;;ing r~l;lpect for poli:Uc:o itself. It is a profession and can be one of the noblest professio;ns of man. College men are the ones to elevate politics from the position of unrespect to that of com- plete respect. Not until men of learning take an active interest in politics and endeavor to remove the corruption, will it be changed. Men active in politics in England are gener- ally looked upon as the leading- men of the coun- try, while in .America, anyone who takes more than a passive interest in a party is believed to have some ulterior motive by which a position is to be secured or money to lle received. This feeling of disrespect for politicians is the result o:f the sentiments caused by the actions of a few men who have taken advantage of the re- sponsibilities placed upon them by the electorate, and have sought personal gain rather than social benefit. Honor has been placed at a low price and the dollar has ruled. When college men place their personal honor and public respect above that of their pocketbook, politics will . be raised from the plane of sloth and corruption into which it has descended, and will be operated for the beneflts of mankind, rather than for unfair personal gains. CONCERNING MEETING NIGHT The Concordiensi$ recently published a timely and interesting letter which pointed out the dis- advantages of allowing Tbm·sday night to con- tinue as the official fraternity meeting night on the campus. There seems to have been much dis- cussion aroused by this letter among fraternity men. Some seem favorably inclined to allow the time to remain unchanged, others are just as posi-• tively convinced that Wednesday night is the bet- THE. C.ONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, OCTOBER, 21, 1932 Peeping Thru. The KeJho.le One would think th:at the college buildings wm·e on fire to observe the crowd, pushing, fight- ing and shoving thek way out at nine-fifty on Tuesday, \Wednesday and 'Thursday mornings. Something drastic happened, everyone really and truly wanted to ,go to. chapel. A stranger told me, that he had neve·r seen such a ·spirit before. That's right, I agreed, the ne:xt t-ime you see the satne spirit exhibited will be in October 1936. The· mark- kers had three easy days, all places were .occu- pied. It is shameful to have to mention this but there are certain individuals who have very little sense af app·reciatfon :f!o·r fi.ner things. What I am trying to hring out, ;is that duPing the political speeches. af t):lose three fine men, two or three supposedly intelligent people persisted in carry'- ing on their own idiotic and most distuFbing con- versation. Only the angry looks of those who were more poUte could bring an end to their self- ishness: and impoliteness. Those members of the faculty responsible for the th:ree very entloya:oie and ·interesting chapel sessions shou<ld feel very :proud. Jack Dearstyne· has been the victim of either a recent graduate of a barber's college in the West Indies or a former gardener who: has taken up the barber profession. Perhaps f.t is the latest hair cut fashion but I am inclined to think that Jack has a .fine case: of justifiable hamicide. Get this, a Cottage an .Saratoga Lake, at $1€10 for the winter season. The fallowing attractions are listed: Gaod ice, fishing, fine (dear hunting) in the vicinity, a huge fireplace, four bedrooms, ·comfortable furnishings, (launges, leather ·chai·rs, etc.), kitchenette, and an oil burner. Most .impor- tant of all a :general stoue is situated only three hundred yards away. Here one can purchase ginger a:le, White Rock, and Lime Rickies, and I suppose other trivial necessities. This little store is just the place to hav;e in the neighborhood be- cause one neve,r knows when guests might arrive. Ah, in reference to the ;aame cottage a little bird just chirped out a message. When translated it revealed that a ·certain trio of gentlemen from one of our leading fraternity houses have recognized the advantages offered by this winter l1,aven. I understand that they are in the act of signing on the dotted line. Just the place to spend the week-ends after a busy week on th.e books. Senator .Judge of the ]?hi Delta 'l'heta House rushed to Albany yesterday to· purchase needy articles for his wardrobe Which he is ta:ki11,g with him to the Army-Yale .game on Saturday. Just a few things, opera hat, shirts, ties, Chesterfields, derby, (Oh 'tis a beauty, a two by five). I don't believe it but somebody said that he even looked at a fur coat. I wonder where the Senator had been the night before. The .R. P. I. game is only a few hours away and as usual tonight we can expect \briHiant engi- neers\ to visit our campus with their red paint and childish capers. Too bad the Idol is not alive. I have been informed of three cases of roy- alty right here in our own college, Prince Oleson, Count Radoyevlch, and Baron Barna. The Baron, I understand, has recently been elevated from his former title of count by the Phi Delts. As a friendly warning or advice, if any partic- ular group of :fellows decide to :vie with cops of Troy, they better maltreat and bruise them in a brutal mam1er. Why? Because they will be charg- ed with such procedure anyway. -TEE PEE. ter ti:mt;l ;far the Q:teeting;:;. Reg~r4less of P!lrs.:m<~.l opinion in the matter, it is evident. that enough interest has been aroused by tl::ie question to war- rant some immediate consideration by the proper body. It is an obvious fact that with the present system of Mon.day-Wednesday-Friday classes, many of the undergraduates find themselves faced with an exam on Friday, the last day of classes in the week for that group. Similarly, on Sat- urday, many members. of the faculty like to give exams in the Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday group of classes. This results in many difficulties facing the stl!-dent if any time is taken out of either Thurs- day or Friday night. It is not the actual time taken for the meeting that results in little study- ing being accomplished in most cases, but the time is so placed that most of the evening is broken up. Monday and Tuesday .evenings are concerned with club meetings and other college activities. This leaves open Wednesday evening wh·ich is favorably placed in the middle of the week and conflicts with very few .af the extra-curricular ac- tivities and a minimum number of the regular weekly exams or hour tests. The Interfraternity Council seems to be the most logical body to bring up tl)is matter official- ly. In this meeting each fraternity wiU be able to express its own opinian by means of its repre- sentatives. This will also offer the council an ex- cellent opportun.:lty to accomplish some definite work. Should a vote on the proposed change re- sult in the fraternities still favoring Thursday as the time for meeting, nothing will have been lost and new arrangements might be made with the faculty regarding the holding of tests on days other than Friday. -D.C.W ..

Downes Freshmen To Meet Rensselaer Year lings WILL BE TESTED TOMORROW Although Union has, during the past 31 clashes. with R. P. I. amass- ed a majority of the V·ictories, a fierce partisan spirit has always per- · vaded the gridiron. Tomorrow the ·Garnet eleven will face the acid test. Will that punch remain? To subdue the Engineers it will be necessary to bring forth the last atom of knowledge which has been imparted during the practice . sessions. To this the ~ea.m. must add a. ftghtiiH5 attitude, a fierce desue to win. Football' history will be made tomorrow. But we hope that the afterma.th of former years will be absent. The typical attitude of years. past, tile \rah-rah\ college boy spirit must be condemned. Incidents · such as the Idol smashing of 1919 -which caused a five-year rupture are remnan-ts of this spirit.

Six On Tuesday morning a profes- sor came down from Bailey hall , to add11ess the student body ir:. chapel. His subject was \The Democratic Platform,\ which I have enclosed in quotation marks not only beca1:1se it is the title of the speech but also because the title is as mythical as the Swi~s' Navy. The professor was evident~ ly trying to disprove :Professor Cummins rema;rks of the previous day. Not only was the attempt un- succesful but by its very content strengthened Professor Cummins' contention that our political cam- paign are but a huge circus. After a brief introductory· state- 1 ment 'by President Day to the effect that after hearing \The Socialist, Platform\ from Professor Cum- mins he didn't suppose that it made much difference whether 1 Professor Wainger spoke about the' Republican or Democratic plat- form, the fiezy little sage from Bailey hall arose and assured Dr. Day and the student body that they would see a difference be- tween the two parties before he had finished. One can scarcely berate Professor Wainger for fail- ing in this for the remark was one of levity and I assume was not ' to be taken seriously. Professor Wainger's first mistak!:'' was his attack on Socialism. In the course of his remarks on this subject he stated that socialism meant a lack of private enterprise. It sounded very well as it echoed throughout the hall, but our Eng- lish pro:flessor didn't seem to have time to pause and show the truth of his statement for I suspect that if he really understands socialism he knows in his own mind that in ' the last analysis social control does not crush private enterprise. Mr. Wainger followed up the previous remark with the announcement that the American people see too much in individual initiative to ac· cept socialism. How much indi- vidual initiative has Professor Wainger noted during the past thr·ee years? The professor-politic- ian continued his harangue by pro- claiming that a Socialistic vote of ]lrotest was a vote thrown away. Thus anyone has the right to infer, have they not, Professor Wainger, that a Democratic vote in protest against the Republican administra- tion is also a vote thrown away? In concluding his weak rebuttal the gentleman admitted that dur- ing brief moments of pessimism he had turned to socialism. The Eng- lish professor might well remain a ])essimist. The passing of time found Mr. Wainger, wan but game, singing the praises of the Democratic party. His resonant voice boomed out with the startling announce- ment that a Democratic adminis- tration would provide economic se- curity, a statement which he con- cluded with a vague \by whatever means possible.\ His pathos was commendable as he came forward -with an illustration about a man burdened by a mortgage on his hom~ and then proceeded to orate about \economic justice\ and \a new deal to the forgotten man.\ His efforts were rewarded by a po- little ripple of laughter which swept over the audience and even the faces of some members of the guillible freshman class were wreathed in smiles of disbelief. Perhaps the highlight of Mr. Wain- ger's talk was the omission of any reference to .Jeffersonian Democ- racy, an omission which prevented a comic monologue from meta- morphosing into a burlesque. Final- ly the professor approached the cli- max with the assertion that the Republican party was the party of big business. What the gentleman from the English department ne- glected to do was to contrast the representatives of the two parties, the Republican nominee as the puppet for the Mellon-National City-Standard Oil group and the Democratic nominee as the mar- ionette of the Raskob-DuPont-Gen- eral Motors aggregation. Obviously one can scarcely expect to hear constructive criticism in every political address. One has a right to expect, however, intelli- gent criticism of party policy and sincere reasoning in behalf of th~ party which the speaker is advo- cating and that is just what the student body didn't get on Wednes- day morning. In conclusion, Pro- fessor Wainger is to be applauded for his temerity in attempting the subject of \The Democratic Plat- THE.

The Republican candidate amassed 4~4 votes, receiving about 100 votes from each of the classes and 15 from the faculty. A comparison between early returns and the final results shows a slackening in the stampede for Hoover among the classes, while the faculty made a complete swing to the present pres- ident, raising him from tie for sec- ond place to first choice. Deduc- tions as to what the influence of the three mid-week chapel speeches was on the straw vote must in any case be quite uncertain; but it ap- pears from these results that tbe speaker for the Republican party convinced more of th.e senior. claaJ and of the faculty than of the lower classes who are reputed to be of inferior intelligence and wisdom. Roosevelt Makes Gain Governor Roosevelt, more than douoling his previous total, made a gain of 68 votes to bring his total to 132, or 20 percent of the whole vote. The sharp gain in the pro- portion of votes cast for the New York governor appears most in tha underclasse8, who before the mid- week chapel speeches had seemed quite opposed to the Democratic candidate; it is generally known that the lower classes are easily in- fluenced by impassioned and fiery oratory. Norman Thomas, the Socialist candidate, made the least gains in the closing poll, and in the close race. with Roosevelt, he fell from six voted behind in the early re- turns to 41 votes behind the Demc-. cratic nominee in the :finals. Thomas obtained .L3 percent of the total ballots, the largest number- af .the 91 votes for the candidat~: of the intellectuals coming from the junior class.

Featherstonhaugh M. Berger G. Melinette R. Diamond C. Hathaway SOIREE The problem of Soiree_is again to be faced by the student body. It was not held last year, due to the economic conditions of the time. The ques- tion confronting everyone at the present time is whether or not the times have changed since last fall. It is better to let the politicians argue about this, but it is up to every student, as an individ- ual, to think about Soiree. There was discussion last year about the Jun- ior Prom. It was only as a result of very good management and the closest of economizing that the dance was a success. The questio11 remains whether or not enough students would support the Soiree to make it a success. The Soiree has never been as well attended as has Prom, and it is the belief of many on the campus, that there are not enough students will- ing to go to the dance to make it a financial suc- cess. It would be better to abolish the Soiree this year rather than to sponsor the dance at a loss. If this were passed in Student Body meeting on Monday morning, Dean Garis has said that it would be possible to have the Thanskgiving week- end, in its stead. This also is .conditional, in that we would not be allowed to have the Saturday of the Rochester game as a holiday. The difference is that we would have one and one-half days va- cation instead of two Saturdays. There are a number of students who would like to go home for Thanskgiving, but would be unable. to do so unless we have the Friday and Saturday vacation. It will 'Qe a definite benefit for these men, as well as for otht=)rs who wish to go out of town for the week-end. PROFJ!)SSIONALISM IN THE BAND Bill McGeehan in his daily column in the New York Herald Tribune took a stand on the exis- tence of professionals in college bands, distinctly referring to members of the Columbia band whom he ~new had been hired for football games. Numerous investigations have been mad'e to discover professional football players, who were playing with amateur teams. Athletic scholar., ships have been discussed and the problem now arises as to the possibilities of \music scholar- ships.\ It is believed by some tnat there were men in the Union band last Saturday who are not under- graduates at Union College. This is just as great a breach i.n college amateurism, as would be the THE CONCORDIE.NSIS, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1932 . Zounds! !

COMPARATIVE SCORES The Garnet eleven proved itsel~ in it's admir- able victory O'ler the Engineers on Saturday af- ternoon. There was much enthusiasm shown at the game by the Union fans, and the gridders won a well-deserved victory. Upon comparing the scores made by our re- maining opponents, Union is favored :to win .over Williams. Rochester, and Hamilton. Tllis remains to be seen, but a similar case which occurred last year is worth nothi.g. The Garnet went to Clinton last year, a de- cided favorite to defeat Hamilton College. Every- one was positive .that nothing could prevent our eleven from adding another laq:tel to it's record. The results showed that Hamilton could boast of a moral victory over our supposedly stronger team. The same incid!'lnt is possible this year 1 unless everyone realizes that up.sets are possible and that a game is not won until the last whistle has blown. Let's back our team to the very end and real- ize that games are not won py comparative scores, but by real hard work and practice. :> Political.

For the first half of the contest Union looked as though it would fall before the smashing attacks of the Cherry and White backfield.· Several times the Trojans penetrat- ed deep into Union territory. Early in the opening period they we:ve inside the ten-yard line but lacked the necessary scoring punch. For. the remainder of the first period Union's goal was .in danger. In the second period the Garnet began to make a better showing. During this portion of the clash the ball see-sawed back and forth practically in the center of the field with neither team gaining a netice- al:>le advantage. Garnet Takes the Offensive two passes, R. P. I. regaining the ball on downs. Dain took the ball down to the seven-yard mark a few minutes later on a double laterai but once again the Garnet combination lack- ed the driving power. Two plunges failed to gain and a trick lateral resulted in a five-yard loss as the Trojans smothered Semerad. On. the fourth down a long pass failed to net a score. Union Scores in Final Feriod UNION'S FRESHMEN· OVERWHELM RlVALS A strong offensive attack gave the Union freshman football team a 19 to 0 victory over the Rensse- laer Polytechnic Institute frosh in the preliminary to the varsity con- test at Troy last Saturday. The Garnet freshmen were su- perior in all departments of play. The passing attack and line de- fense of the Cherry and White frosh failed to daunt the visitors. A total of thirteen first downs were piled up by Union, while the best R. P. I. could do was to score two. After a succession of line plunges the Garnet frosh went down the field from the 30-yard line for a touchdown. Woodruff carried the ball over from the ten-yard marker. The extra point was scored on a pass from Milano to DiLallo. The remainder of the period was a ser- ies of penalties and fumbles. The quarter ended with the ball at mid- field in R. P. I.'s possession. Pass Scores Touchdown During the second quarter the teams were forced to kick consist- ently. The third quarter again found Union in a position to score. A long pass from Krull to Wood- ruff brought the pigskin to the R. P. I. seven-yard line. Krull's pass to Lavorgna scored the sec- ond touchdown. The kick. for ex- tra point was blocked. In the last quarter Woodruff car- ried the ball through the oppon- ent's line several times to place the ball in a scoring position. He plunged through the line for the third Garnet score.

Not man; ... untH this. fall, when the Crim son squad which numbered clos to 100 players unmercifully drub ·bed the Buffalo eleven whos squad could be barely composer into two full outfits. And theJ the howl arose. The Yale \News' decried this practice and ev.en tb Harvard \Crimson\ put in a1 apologetic word or two. Since then several of the small er schools have reeogni~ed tb futility of the process. UniOJ was a pioneer in the movemeni This season she banished ,th' · powerful Columbia eleven freE her schedule and sUbstituted tl-:• Wesleyan team, an aggregatio1 nea.rer her own strength. Middle bucy, however, feeling that a wel filled purse was worth a sounr beating, avidly snapped at th opportunity which the Union re tirement offered. Swartbm.ore, under Dr. 'E.i'ranJ· Ayedelotte, has assimilated thr Union doctrine and has .given 1.11 her annual contest with thr mighty Pennsylvania combina tion. Although. no official wol'c has ,been passed, it is supposer' · that Swarthmore will, in 193:1 take the place .of the weak Ho : bart team which w-ill be dropper' · from the Garnet schedule. In his address at the National .

8im Music By RANKINE HINMAN The weekly organ recitals have alway~ been inbued with a wonder- ful spirit, but seldom more so than last Sunday; the remembrance which Dr. Hale has left us seemed. to inspire not only Professor Tid- marsh but those for whom he play- ed. We will long remember lal>t Sunday's two services. The first appearance of our new,- ly enlarged Glee club was marke4 by the same unusually excellent enunciation which has become a characteristic of the group's workj. This growing recognition of the importance of the word~ of vocal works is expressed not enly by mo:re emphasis being placed on per- fect diction bu~ also by the stead- ily increasing desire on the part of the American concert-goer to hear works in English rather than in French, Italian, or German.; an unM fair handicap to which our native singers have long been subjected , is thus rapidly being removed. Our efforts to ~eplace Arthur Herner, who began this column last year but is now studying. at Columbia University, call to mmd a story told by A. F. Haas, vice- president of the National Broad- casting Company, at a recent din- ner. Upon the death of Meyerbeer, his nephew, a young composer, wrote an In Memoriam, which be presented to Rossinni with the re- quest that he criticize it very frank- ly. After glancing over it the lat- ter replied, \It were better bad y<'ltt died, my boy, and Meyerbeer had written the In Men;10riam.\ Although we personally felt the chimes were more effective at even- tide and would like to hear them again played at 6 o'clock, we are glad that they are used before chapel when the student body is out on the campus and many more can enjoy them. The chimes, which were given the college in 1926 by the class of 1922, are composed ~ of eleven French semi-bells; as there are only two which correspond to the black keys of the piano transpo- sition for the chimes is restricted to those songs which have a range not over one octave and which aFe written is one of three keys. Dr. Richmond, who is a great admil'er of carillon music and was influential in having the bells at Union, had many songs arranged for the set; Don Nitchman, who plays the chimes, has transposed many of our college and fraternity songs so that now the best of those which can be used are avaH- able. Saturday was the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of Leopold Damrosch, the father of Walter Damrosch. A Prussian by birth, Leopold settled his home in Amer- ica and was responsible for many of the developments of the musical culture that was then in its in- fancy here. He founded the ora- torio and symphonic societies and established German opera at th~ Metropolitan.

Painter MONTHLY EXAMINATIONS With exam.inations taking place now, a ques- tion. arises as to the possibility ef conducting the mcatbly examinations upon a systematic basis. ·students are confronted with the necessity of tak- in.g two or three examinations on the same day, -wl!icb. makes a complete revlew impossible .for all courses. If the faculty would establish some definite schedule whereby the periodical examination;,; coulld be scheduled at such a time as not to make it nEleessary for a student to take two or three or even four examinations on the same day, better preparation would be possible and the scholastic .average of the college would be raised. There is no reason, other than laxity or pro- . cr-astination on the part of the faculty members, for a situation to exist such as prevails at the present time at Union and in many other schools. If it is impossible for the entire faculty to develop a sc.hedule whereby a man would not be compelled to ta.He more than one examination in a single day~ there is no reason why this could not be done within the departments, so as to alleviate the ne- cess;ity for cramming on the part of the under- gradu.ate, which in itself is not only detrimental to the student, but to the scholastic average of the college. Under the present indefinite and haphazard metihod of conducting examinations without re- gard for other examinations which occur on the same day, the student is required to step from <>ne class room, where he may have taken an ex- ?-D!in?tion covering a months work in French, to anoth.er class where he immediately may have to chang~ his trend of thought to that of economics, political science, or biology. This complete transition cannot be established iil t:he ten minutes between classes and does not :allow ,the student to give an accurate representa- tion. of his knowledge, which is unfair to the stu- dent and to the profe:11sor. We hope that the faculty will see fit to take som.e a-ction upon this pressing situation and at- tem;pt to arrive at a system whereby some plan ()r a.rrange:ment can be worked out. <JO:MPETITIQN VERSUS GATE RECEIPTS We recently read that Swarthmore has dis- continued its usual game with Penn State and that Williams will no longer play Columbia. These two ex~mples follow the decision of Union last :year in dropping Columbia from our schedule. The sole purpose in booking a team such as ·Columbia is obvious. Anyone could correctly pre- -dict the outcome of the game beyond a question of doubt. A game with a school such as Union or Williams is a \set-up\ for Columbia, intended to giv.e the Blue and White one hour of practice against a weaker eleven. A matter of three thou- sand d()llars is incidential as compared to fhe enormous gate receipts of a game held at Baker flel<l. A guarantee such as can be offered by these larg-er schools can go a long way toward financing the athletic budget of a school as small as Union, Swarthmore, or Williams, and upon immediate xeckoning appears as an easy way of putting ath- leth:: departments on the blue side of financial re- ports. · · There is, however, another point of view worthy of consideration. Union was one of the :first small colleges to place sportsmanship above gate receipts, in spite of the inevitable monetary loss. ., THE CONCORDIENSIS~ FRIDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1932 P.eeping Thru the KeJ:hole Oh, Oh, I was. i:n a -difficult p•redicament this week, Mr. and Mrs. Gossip and Gos-sipy .Jr. start- ed early this weelt for the Yale-Dartmouth -game and left me in the lurch. However I rec.ruited a few \demon snipers\ .and here are the :latest items of interest. Dean Ellery's organic chem,istry class (of three) is quite interested in alcohol and I don't think it is for chemical reasons either. Ah, tht:> Dean scared the, \.Uttle hoodlums/' when he told them· that iso-propy (my tongue somersaulted that time) had .four times the efFect on tae men- ta} attitude as Ol'd'inary alcohol. WB,ich reminds me too that the Chemistry department ra·il out of alcohol the other day; that 'a :bootlegger offered his wares for a little more ,tham twenty-seven cents a gallon; .promised delivery immedia:tely; thus saving the department a si'l{ months wait. My, how trans'Poi·tation fa,el.Jities aid one. Alden Stanton sauntered up to the \Northern Institution\ the other night in sea;rch of a date, (special attention to that word se8Jrch). Ele went to one of the main halls and ided four different parties each emiting the little phrase, \Sorry old dea:t\ I really must study.\ ·The ,last one asked him, if he would like a bli'nd date? \Why really e·r-don't be ridiculous-all the women I know here.\ The v-ital questions to be ,considered ar.a (a)· the new \fuller-brush hair,cut\ (b) the Hoover .button, or, (c) the studies. What a blow, (I ~ust shudder at the accuracy our Republican boss at Union to.Ok on the chin: last Monday night, can't you imagine the deli- cate little phrases that ran through. Congress- man Crewther 1 s mind when he saw his audience? Why 1 I'm positive it is true-yes· of course--There was a handful (one, two, three, four, five). I'd like to suggest a band wagon instead of :buttons. At last I got this one straight. Oh, this is rich: Mohawk Country Day Sch~ol played the Troy Country Day School two weegs ago. One of the Troy boys was .supposed to have made a false move (It was only a supposition too) which brought ONE PROTEST f~om the side lines, it came from none other than ~the brilliant radio announcer WARREN MUNSON, (now it gets good). He threatens the you.ngster. You can't get away with that stuff over here. Game ends, MUNSON walks out on the field to make good his threat; George Codman .(the moon face) la- crosse manager and Stan Mewer. the Beta, join the youngster's side. Both pull the dapper an- nouncer back tw:o or three times but he would not behave himself. The only alternative was to clip Munson's antenna and send him out of the Phi Delt yard. The player could have settled it, but his girl was with him, and quite confidentially she doesn't like fights. The m0ral-radio an- nouncers hold tongue when at football games un- accompanied by equipment. Did you know-Lee Tracy graduated from Union, the Great Dain enters the locker room- Woof, Woof, Coach Hatfield has been ill for four days, Ed Fitz wore plus twelves with red stock- ings at the game last Saturday. the Winter Cot- tage contract was signed for twenty dollars less this week, the informal house warming takes place Saturday night. A certain group from a prominent fratern.ity plan to .spe·ad Hallowen'en night at the Old Orchard Inn on the outskirts of Schenectady, it is an awful dive and can probably be purchased for ten dollars. Senator Judge from the Northern Country had to. leave his car in front of the New York .A. C. last week-end be- cause he lost the .key and. aU the Cadillac stock rooms were closed on Sunday. On Monday he bought three keys. Tom Acheson went on one ()f those famous geology field trips the other day and because of an unforunate accident he is now minus one pant leg just below the knee of the suit with the red stripe. Yes indeed, Bay Hutton, that great, con- genial chap at the Delta Phi house who sleeps more than any other Union man got out his shear!:! and played the role of a tailor. Dear, dear, the Troy cops made two grave errors last weelt-end at the R. P. I. game. The firsf one-Chief Funston accompanied by two dis- tinguished citizens were ordered from their posi- tions, between the press box and the Union bench. Later the cop was informed .of h:is error and he tried to apologize in a most sheepish manner. \Wouldn't it have been just a sca-reem if ·the Chief muttered, \Y:ou weasel wait until you come to my town.\ But, he didn't. The second error, President Day asked a cop to make three bi&' huskies who were obstructing the view, to move into some other section. rt is not certain but perhaps the cop was very interested in the game. Here is hoping that hy this time tomorrow night we will have the Purple Guernsey by the horns. Question-Mark, tonig'ht Luke.? What did he do'? Don't be so du:rnb, I am not referring to a human being. ~Tee Pee. There always were a few who kindled the hope that some day the small <lollege, such as our own, would upset the \dope\ by turning the tables on the stronger rated team, such as was the case this year when little Bates won a moral victory over Yale by holding them to a scereless tie. The Carnegie Bulletin, number 23, reads, \The deflation of American football has begiui.\ Small colleges are beginning to realize the fallacy of playing lar&'e schools far out of their own class, in spite of the financial loss, an.d, as a result, keen- er competition is brought abolLt. People are dropping the mythical David and Goliath attitude as applied to tlollege football and are beginning to realize the .absurdity of small teams' attempting to combat opponents which arc entirely out of their class.

Tour Prof. Enslow States Socialists' Position (Continued from page 1) cessary to induce activity, they point out that there are many other reasons why men work, e. g., love of congenial work, fear of unem- ployment, desire for power, desire for public approval and recognition, loyalty to one's family and group. They believe that by education to a better set of moral values, people will work at least as willingly ancl as well for the state as for private employers. Socialists do not believe in the equal distribution of all praperty and the abalition of all private ownersh·ip. They do believe tha;t honest, willing men should not be forced, through no fault of their own, to beggary, starvation, and warse in a country which is a verit- able cornucopia of material plenty. Space will not permit a detailed , statement of the Socialist pl<J-n for achieving their program. It is a fact that many of their suggestions are approved by many leaders of thought in the fields of economics, seciology, and government, and that many of these scholars are themselves Socialists. Certainly Socialism need not apologize for such men as John Dewey and Paul H. Douglas, to name only two. Public Ownership It is well known that an impor- tant element in the Socialist pro- ~ram is the public ownership and operation of essential industries, such as railroads, and other public utilities. They ask democratic con- trol of natural resources and their development for public good rather than their exploitation for private profit. They also ask federal relief for unemployment; unemployment insurance; old age, health, and ma- ternity pensions; six-hour day and five-day week, in order to spread the benefits of advancing technol- ogy; abolition of child labor; great- er governmental operations in the banking business; adherence to the World Court and the League of Nations; abandonment of all for- eign military intervention; prohibi- tion of munition sales to foreign powers; cancellation t>f war debts; decreased taxes on farm property with heavier taxes on large in- comes. inheritances, excess profits, etc.; legislation guaranteeing free speech, press, and assembly; direct election of President and Vice- President, and many other highly desirable things. Faculty Lampoons Political Parties (Continued from page 1) his lapels and button holes (there had been rumors he was not an American!); gave his promise to support the platform of his party w-hich offered to restore liquor, re- duce taxation, reduce armaments but maintain an adequate army and navy, help the farmer, balance the budget. Ligon, on the other hand, with many literary figures of speech that were punctuated with his cam- paign laugh, promised to support his party's platform which offered to restore liquor, reduce taxation, reduce armaments but maintain an adequate army and navy, help the farmer, balance the budget. Cast BaDots The audience cheered each speak- er's every phrase, and even \how- ever's\ and \but's\ received a cheer. Then the audience, blind- folded, cast their ballots: They pinned a tail on either an elephant (Republicans) or on a donkey whose eyes had a pleading, simper- ing look, [the caricatures of both parties as well as interesting politi- cal cartoons were the work of Mrs. Augustus Fox and they will be sold at the Faculty Woman's Club bookstore, November 28-December 3, for the benefit of the student loan fund.] · Then there was dancing, drink- ing of a special cider in the back yard, and coffee-for those who wanted it. Music was furnished by a radio-phonograph combination (name omitted: advertising). It was generally agreed that it was a sw~ll barn party and will be continued as long as Charley Male has empty space in his many barns, on the Troy road. Dean Garis, ftressed in his- usual costume, and Mrs. Garis, dressed in a \nighty\ and holding a candle (to guide the faculty over the dark spots) chaperoned the light hearted intellectuals durin&' the festivities last night.
