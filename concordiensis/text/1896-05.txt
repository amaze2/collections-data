The Govern- lnent too takes pains to ste that the sn1allest fragtnent is preserved. This was perhaps as much the case during the reign of the Popes as it is now, and accounts for the enonnous num- ber of inscriptions on exhibition in the museutns, and in the great hall, called the Galleria Lapidaria, of the Vatican. In the latter place the collection nun1bers sooo, and is arranged along; the walls of the gallery in such a way as to be easily accessible to the student. Not only pagan life, but that of the early Christians also is pictured to us on these tnonutnents of stone and rnarble. Many of them have been taken frorn the catacombs-those subterranean pas- sages and charnbers, where the follo\vers of the new religion bui It their altars and chapels and laid away their dead. Much that is interesting connected with the life and thought of the first three centuries of our era has con1e down to us in full detail through the n1.eans of carvings and epitaphs preserved in these underground tun- nels, which encircle the city of the Cresars, as one n1ay say, for n1iles. Ancient custotns did not cease with the advent of christianity, and epigraphical writing continued to be practised on the soil of Italy until the time of the Middle Age; nor has it ever wholly lost its vogue,-and although n1ost of the inscriptions in the cata- cotnbs have been retnoyed to the tnuseums in Rome, yet a sufficient number still remain in these abodes of the dead to render it worth' the while of the archreologist to take students thither and to accept pecuniary compensation for de- .. live1·i ng special lectures on the subject within the cetneteries themselves. This being the case, I have been very glad of the opportunity to accornpany the tnetnbers of the Atnerican school to three of the most itnportant of these under- ground galleries, in order to listen to the in- structions of a gentleman natned Marucchi, whose life has been devoted to a study of the subject, anrl whon1 we rnust not confuse with the ordinary '' guide .. \ But I do not watil t even to suggest that the greatest good to be g-ot frorn a visit to Rotne is a chance to study inscriptions, or to see the catacotnbs. Rotne J~s not a large city. At the present day it is ,tnor.e populous than it has been for centuries, and yet the nutrtber of its in- habitants does not exceed fi.ve hundred thousand, and is less than the population of Naples. It is not to be cotnpared in 1~espect to size or the beauty of its buildings with Paris or London or Berlin or even New York. To the casual ob- server there is little a.bout it that is very stt·ildng -at least when viewed:, so to speak, frotn the outside. Take a cab and drive through the city frotn end to end-if a city that is nearly round can be said to have .an end, -and then tnake the circuit of the town, lteeph~g within the Aurelian walls. Do this (it ~an be accomplished in a single n1orning), and you will observe that the buildings or other objects that appear to he of particular itnportatlce ate con1parativeiy few in nutnber. The eye will be attracted by St. Peter's and by one or two of the other great basilicas. The attention will also be itn- rnediately arrested by the ~Castle of St. Angelo . (Hadrian's Ton1b), the Pantheon, the Q!.uinal, three or four of the palaces of the old Italian fan1ilies, one or two()[ the obelisks, the arches of Constantine and Titus, the Piazza del Popolo, the piazza and buildings on the Capitoline Hill, the Colosseum, the t-uins of the palaces of the Cresars on the Palatine, the Borghese gardens, the recently excavated Forutn Romanutn, the Colutnns of Trajan and of Marcus Aurelius, one or two of the city gates, the retnains of the aqueducts, and the Bank of Italy in the Via Nazionale. These, if not all, are a majority of the objects that atagLance would seem itnportant to the stranger, and the n1.unber is a small one, if compared with a corresponding list that tnight · be made for ahnost a:.ny one of the larger cities of Europe. Wherei11 then does the interest con- sist, that we all feel in Rome ? For it is not to the student of antiqttity only that Ro1ne is at- tractive.

An object which the tnetnbers of the party kept in view, apart fron:1 the ple-asure of riding their bicycles and of spending a day in the country, was to satisfy their curiosity respecting two sites, either of which, there is reason to believe, n1ay have been the place once occupied by the hon1e an<l fann presented to Horace by the Minister Nor is Rotne a difficult spot to reach.

Raytnond thanked Mr. Pul:len w.ith a pleasing Mr. Pullen in his lecture dwelt upon the ' nurnerous v.oluntary slaves to self, passion, and · the appetites in our every day life. He drew a . cleverly outlined rnoral throughout his whole , discussion and left his hearers to benefit by it . wherever it applied. He said in part: '' To-day it is the pride of : the Atnerican citizen that no slave is held in bondag-e throughout the length and breadth of · our land. In one sen'3e this is true, but in . another sense it is false. We have atnong us n1any voluntary slaves. The voluntary slave forges his own shackles or penn its others to govern him. He rarely pennits others to etnancipate him. The first slave to be considered is the busi- ness slave. Our nation is distinguished as de- voted to trade. We force ourselves to slavery ~nd although the shackles of the business slave are gold, that 1netal enters deeper into the heart than iron or steel. The slave to business has no leisure fur any of the enjoy1nents of life, no leisure to read aught but financial lists of trade, no leisure for the happiness of hotne or friendly intercourse. Many rnen rnake gods of their appetites. Food and stimulants subjugate reason. Lust is a n1ost dishonorable slavery. Slaves of fear are cowards. Continually fearing evil they have no pleasure in life and by titn idity they court disaster. The fear of public opinion tnake those whose tnotives are pure and honest forego giving unbiased opinions.

OuR next issue will not appear until June 3, in- stea<:l of the regular time on May 27. We Inake this change owing to the Senior exau1inations which corne the 'veek of the 27th and during which the editors will be rushed with other worlc IN ouR last issue we very foolishly n1ade a pass- ing reinark concerning 'Villiarns' athletics. After due consideration of the n1atter it seerns that. such a remark was uncalled for and unnecessary, and as Willian1s appears to be trying to do the just thing by Union, we do not consider it at all out of place to say that the reinark was Inade with no intention of again stirring up ill-feeling. JUDGING fron1 his letters Professor Ashn1ore's inte1·est in Union while abr•oad seen1s always to increase. The students and THE CONCORDIENSIS owe much to the Professor for his interest and the kindness he has shown us by making it possible to read and enjoy his rnost de1ightful lBtters con- cerning Rome and the work of the student the1·e. In our· next issue we hope to present another · letter of his concerning the Olyrnpie· ga.rnes at which he was a spectator. I i' IS to be regretted that there was not a large-r attendance of the students at the Junio1· Pronl- enade on May L The dance was one €)f the best ever given at the college, and the -coru;mittee in charge of it should have been support€d by the student body. All such affairs are college institu- tions and depend upon the student body for sup- port.. If that -support is not given, faUuTe is the result. We do not n1ean to infer that the Proul- enade was a faiiure-it w:as a great success in every way but financially-but there was a decided falling off in the attendance frou1 atuong college 1.nen .. With. the· exception of the Corn1nenceu.~:ent ball there will be no more college dances this year, but we hope next fall when the J uniot· hops are again begun that the students will recognize that those hops will not be a success without their co- operation. THE Union College Sunnner School, which is to be held at Saratoga Springs during July and August,. ought to be very successful. Saratoga is trying hard to Tegain the reputation she once heltl, and to do this she has ousted the ga.n1bling ele1nent and is now trying to draw the:re instead intellectual and cultured people. The S umn1er School is under the direct supervision of Union CoUege\ however, but Saratoga is doing all she can to advertise and draw students to it. The class of students the school will draw will pl·ob- ably be of the very best and it should in_ so1ne de- gree serve as a sort of feeder for the co1:lege. The wo1·k -wHl be just the same as is done h.ere and will be credited to those who later enter col!l€ge. The faculty will spare no efforts to 1nake ,tlte school a success, and granting the number of scholars will be as large as is anticipated, good resuJts ought to be the reward for their work. WITHOUT the hearty co-operation of the alu.mni no university nor college can secure the best pos- sible resu It~, and this applies to Union as strictly as to a great 1nany other institutions if not more so. The aluinni of Union, as a whole, do not take the interest in the college that they should, nor do they render the college the aid which. Inany of them are fully able to do. Is not this lack of

Refi\oval Bills Defeat((d. ·The Union College 1'en1oval bills, which were before the Assembly, were defeated at the after- noon session on April 29, by a vote of 98 to I 6. The bills ha(l once before been reported favor- ably, but were recomtnitted to the cities cotn- . mittee for a further hearing, by a vote of 78 to 20 on the motion of Mr. Winne, the Schenec- tady Assernblyn1an. This was supposed to kill the bills, but the Albanians who \tvere interested in the scherne, 111anaged to get the bills once more before the Assen1hly, through the rules· COlTinlittee. vVhen the vote was taken the bills were defeated by a larger n1ajority than was secured to recotntnit tbem. out .and son1e interestin.gexperin::}ents\vere tnade.
