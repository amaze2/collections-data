Speaking on \Wind Water, and Waves,\ Dr. Langmuir described his experiments at Lake George where he has been studying temperatures, currents, and other phenomena.

Haigh Several times a year the campus is forced to cope \Vit1l a mass of unverifiallle and etToneous propaganda. Some of these rumors have theiJ· suurces from the feeble brains of practical jokers, who try t() give the impres- sion that the1.r have an \in but the major- ity are handed down from the riches of the past. The present squabble over the validity of the vote on the new \functional\ consti- tution is a good example of the latter case. In the g'Ood old days, when the Terrace Council w~ts the student govet·ning- agency, there was a quaint rule based on the age old idea of fresh1nan inequality. Then each first year man was envisioned by his superior brethren as being- cloaked in a suit of abso- lute ignorance-unable to exercbe the privi- lege of voting wisely. \Vhen \l.loving-Up Day\ arrived on the college calendar, the lowly frosh ·were finally vested with the right of manhood suffrage. When this autocratic regime was thrown out in 1932 and the Student Council vested with the power of student g·ove1·nment, the student body hailed this democratic renova- tion with a series of ''hips\ and a few \hoo- rahs\ added for good measure. In keeping with this enthusiastic t·eception, the Coun- cil went \to bat\ for freshman rights. On ;\lay 1.

If Mr. Bundgus and Me:;sers Healthy Animal will' take time to J·etlect on the bogies of government which they have sincexely believed in, they will see the, inadequacies of an indefinite and unparliamentary constitution which year by year has lost the clarity of outline which seemed so bright and effective under' br:lliant leadership in 1932. We have need of a constitution that will eliminate a., much a~ possible that shoddy thinking which is so typical of college men. Mr. Bundgus xaved and. tanted a few weeks ago about the great delay in put-: ting the constitution through the Council. Now, alter the groundwork has been laid for what we hope wrll be efficient gove.rnment, he ask.s for a delay and appeals to a long over looked rule, one which is still unincmporated in the written Ja,w of the undergrad- uate body, in order to make sure the new constitu- tion has been \legally\ passed. The Council agxees that it has erred in not giving the fit:~ttmen an upportun·ity to vote, for such i,; their right according to a resoluHon passed in April, 1932, after the present constitution had been formulated.

In reality French foreign policy is mme firmly tied to the tail of the British tabby.

TRACKMEN LOSE Taking only two first places <itit- right, although it tied for two others, the track team bowed be- fore a supetior Colgate team 85-41. Ernest Bodenstab, competing in his first varsity meet, captured a :first place when he threw the discus 119 feet, 5lh inches, to w'in the event. Bob Hayner, who ran the 120 yard high hurdles in 16.2 won the only other first place for Union of the afternoon. Captain Win Day and Harry Myers tied for first places in the pole vault and high jump, respectively. Union was particulaty weak in the running events. The Red Raid- ers swept the 100, 220, and 440 events. No Union man finished bet- ter than fourth ip any of these three events. John Fisher took a thlr d in the 880-yard run to pt event a C~l­ gate sweep in that event. B1ll Hawkes and Joe Annesse had to be content with second places in the two-mile and one-mile events, re- spectively. Dick Hancock of Col- gate ran the former in the fast time of 9:52. Bob Hayner followed Frank of Colgate across the finish line in the 220-yard hurdles to take a second in that event. BASEBALL SQUAD DROPS RAGGED GAME Failing to take advantage of the many opportunities offered it, the baseball team lost a poorly played game to Haverford, 13-~. Tl;e score of the game was 8-8 gomg mto the ninth innin)S,' but the Pennsylvan-ia tearn staged a ft ve run 1 ally to put the game on ice. . Union had men on base rn every inning. but:· railed to capitalize on this. Several time.s Union men were caught napping off base and w~re thrown out, and on one occasiOn ran into a double play. AI Mould started on the mound for Union but was relieved in t-he fourth Inning -when he allowed four runs. Bob Han.st>n then took the hill and was followed three innings later by Chet Robinsno. Walks were frequent durin.g the game, with Union drawing 11 fr·ee trips while the Garnet pitchers were giving out nine. RAWLEY, D\WORE LOSE The defeat C>f Fritz Hawley and Marve Dwore in doubles by Buskey and O'Keefe of :Middlebury was a great upset in the tennis match with Middlebury which the Panthers an- nexed 5-4. Thi.s marked the first time In 11 matche,s that Hawley and Dwor·e have been beaten in doubles. STICKME::N DEFEATED Union's lacrosse team. dropped its second consecutive 11 to 3 game in two weeks, a strong Stevens Tech team turning the trick at Hoboken on Saturday. Stevens jumped to an early lead, tallying sLx goals in the first quar- ter to Union's one, and was never in danger from then on. Hanna and Spann had l>oth registered for Stevens before Myron Stillman took a pass behi:nd the Engineer's goal, rounded the \horn\ and toss- ed in the Garnet's first point in 8:03. This ended the scoring for the Dutchmen until 10 minutes of the third period bad elapsed, when Captain Joe Paul sank another one for Union, and. tb.en duplicated this feat less than t-wC> minutes later. Stevens, held scoreless in the sec- ond period, scored three goals in the third, and two in the fourth Despite the tact that he was closely checked throughout the game, Joe Pa.ul's two goals gave him a tie fm sc<Jring honort;; with Shonsly, Spann, Magrath, Hanna, and Rockwell, an of Stevens.

Pag.e Four Icy Arctic Will Be Setting for Pr&m Hot Music To Emanate F1·om Icebergs as Penquins Guard Gates The style of decoration to bc used at this· year's Junior PTon> is the exclusive propertr of the Prom Com·mittee, it was revealed today. In order to restrain other colleges fz·om ushtg this set-up, the Jun.iur Pt:om Committee ·has copyrighted its Arctic setting, whtch therefore cannot ·be· used on any other campus until next ~ear. The gymnasium has u·aveled northward, figuratively speaking, from Persian gardens in 1936 via ship decks in 1937 to the Arctic regions i'n 1938. Igloos will be used for prom booths, with penguins in full dress acting as dom·men. A.s ice-blue sky with fleecy cl..,uds · drifting by will covN the ceUing, while the bandstand will take the form of an iceberg, with the musi- cians seated on different levels.: The porch will be flooded with. col- ored lights, sen•ing as a resting place for the dancers.

More recently they have come to realize that this was scarely gen- erous, or perhaps even fair, to those excellent fraternities which had shown public usefulness and con- tinuing vigor in their properties off the campus in Schenectady. It has therefore come to be their policy to welcome other fraternity houses that might add to the residential spirit on the campus. During the past winter, an alumnus architect, Edward P. Foster, Jr., of the class of 1931, worked out a careful study of the northeast quarter of the campus lying beyond Han.s Grott's Kill. Mr. Foster ha.s indicated the placement of new fraternity houses in that region; these would not simply complete Lenox Road as a street, but would be .scattered with garden-like irregularity in the grove and be served by a special driveway to be taken in flom the northeast corner.

The tipecial election was held to allow freshmen to express their opinion following the vote of last week when the thtee upperclasses voted and the class of '41, through an etcror on the part of the student council. was not ailowed to ca.ot its ballot. The Union College chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha wHl build a new fraternity house, designed in French Colonial . style, in the new Fraternity Quadrangle, officials of the local chapter announced recently. The new house will be in the shape of a block \U covering a ground area of 70 ft. X 34 ft. on the knoll at Lenox Road, across the brook from the Delta Phi house. The structure will contain two • • I wings, connected by a section Spring Night D ' . ate which is recessed 9 feet in from · . the frolllt.

Vendors peddling their wares to the audience, han.dlebar mustaches, and the villian R.ob·ert Furman, pursuing the .beautiful ·heroines, as the hero, Henry Clay, rushes to the rescue, will take the spectators bacl-. to the good old days of the turn of the century. The play, directed by Edward Carroll in an authenti-c atmosphere which even permits the audience to boo the villain, is the first pro- duction. of its kind ever to be: pre- sented by the Mountebanks and promises to be a roaring success. Performances will be presented this weekend as well as on the eve of prom next Friday night for the benefit of prom goers. The settings for the plot will move from a \lowly basement\ and North River wharf to the classy surroundings ·Df \an elegant boudoir.\ Even a taste Qf the bur- lesque will be included when little George Conover, together with lanky Furman, combine to present a real touch of the old strip tea.se. Not only will the play itself be reproduced exactly as was its first presentation when it was given in the New York Theatre in August of 1867, but between the ads, the villian and hero will give forth with song and dance specialties. :rickets may be reserved by apply- tng at the News Bure.au in Silli- man Hall. Published by Council After Meeting Tuesday, May 3--At the meeting of the Interfraternity Council to- night, plans were made to take over the sponsorship of the annual Spring Night Song Fest, and Rob- ert Denzler, chairman of the coun- cil, announced that the date: for this contest, because of other events scheduled for May 11, has been changed to Thursday night, May 26. The two additional cups to be awarded as prizes from the coun- cil will be made at that time also. The silver cup, presented by the college Music Department, was won last year by the Delta Upsilon fra- telnity. Three houses now have won the cup two times each: Delta Upsilon, Psi Upsilon, and Kappa Alpha. The cup passes into the per- manent possession of the fraternity winning it three times; so this year competition will be espesially keen. Several fraternities have already signified their intention of entering the contest, including Delta Upsilon, Alpha Delta Phi, Psi Upsilon, Kappa Sigma, and Theta Delta Chi. All· others are urged to compete. Each fraternity entering the Sing, which will inaugurate the Junior Week festivities, will be asked to sing two songs. The first must be a college song chosen from these four: Come Now to the Campus, The Terrace Song, The Dutchrn.an Song, and It's Union's Ga.me. The second will be a fraternity song. Plan Service Society MJ.·s. Fox to Advise Mrs. Dixon R~·an Fox has grac- iously consented to act in an ad- visory capacity in assisting with the interior furnishings and decor- ations, as well a.s witn the outside planting of shrubs and trees, said ua.ternlty officials. The basement floor in the left or south wing will contain a chapter room, 32 !t. x 24 ft., opening into a billiard room. The right wing will mclude a servant's apartment, consisting of a living room. and two smaller rooms. Tne basement will also co111tain oil heating units and air-conditioning apparatus which will provide a complete change of air every 6 minutes. Re- fr·igerated rooms will be installed here also for preservation of large quantities of food. 'l:he main entrance will lead into a fo~·er, 20 feet wide, opening into a 32 ft. x 24 ft. living room, di- rectly above the chapter room. The north wing will contain the dining room and kitchen, which latter will be installed with the latest electrical equipment. A memorial library, to be furnished by one of the faculty and the wife of a deceased alumnus, will be lo- cated on this floor, as well as clothes rooms, telephones and toi- let facilities. To Have Suites 'l'he seconcl and third floors will be identical: each will contain 3 large suites of bedrooms and study rooms, and 2 smaller suites for studies and guest accommodations. Bathrooms on these floors will be ectuipped with glass-enclosed showers. Indirect illumination will be used throughout the study rooms, with lighting fixtures around the ceiling mouldings. \Several fraternities have shown a lively interest in these new plans, but the first to consider itself ready to take advantage of it is Lambda Chi Alpha. I understand the gen- tlemen of that fraternity are now readY to announce their plans and certainly no one welcomes their ad- vent to the college more enthusia.s- tically than do those connected with the college administration. Lambda Chi Alpha has aroused and sustain- ed no little adwirl!-tion in the fra- ternity world for its extraordinary suc<!ess in rapidly extending over the country after its foundation in 1909. It established more than 80 chapters and yet, so far as I know, it has lost none; it has shown both strength and wisdom in it.s national management. Our own chapter, dur- ing more than a score of years of active contribution to our campus life, has. grown in vitality, particu- larly within 1·ecent times, and it is most gratifying to see it ready to assume the burden and acquire the convenience of placement on the \CURSES I AM FOILED AGAIN,\ MUTTERS THE VILLAINOUS BYKE Plans are under way for an all- college honorary service society, the members of which will function in the capacity of a reception commit- tee to greet visiting athletic teams and to guide vistors around the campus.

The proposed \Garnet Key\ here at Union would: have the sophomore candidates performing the actual duties, the juniors being the regular members, and the seniors having honorary membership· The Inter- fraternitY Council will supervise OI).iy the formation of this society, after which it will function as a regular honorary college organiza- tion.

Morris Fitzgerald, Jr. DITTO Most Honored and Distinguished Editor: For a ve1 y, very long while, it has been the p1 i vilege of my dis- tinguished ancestors to humbly serve Union students and their ·fa- thers' fathers. Now we beg that every consideration be offered to our honorable and ancient race. We beg that the undistinguished Take- uchi be unceremoniously excused from his service as speaker. <Of Very Fine Chinese Laundry, Thank You.l LIBRARY SMOKESTACK In the fall of 1863 Mark Twain, having won his spurs as all-around nose-thumbing feature writer for the Virginia City Enterprise, came to San Francisco to try his luck. He was immediately dubbed \The Vlashoe Giant,\ and for three years until his departure to the East, he contributed raw, zestful articles to the San Francisco Golden Era, the liveliest literary sheet west of New York. These atticles-such exploits as \Those Blasted Children,\ \The Lick House Ball\ and \The Keary Street Ghost Story\-have been brought together and edited by Franklin :walker in a collection called The Washoe Giant of San FI·ancisco. The volume is a choice item among a group of rare and lim- ited editions which our librarian has been quietly gathering in. In these early sketches Mark Twain is not subtle, not brilliant, but he is tough and lush - an untrimmed Hemingway. You should read about the prize-fight in which a man takes out his opponent's left lung and smacks his (the opponent's) face with it. It was Van Wyck Brook's thesis in The Ordeal of 1\'lark Twain that this original strength and fire was weakened by Mark's marriage Into the Langdon family of Elmira, New Yorl~, and his consequent surrender to the proprieties of entrenched up- per-class respectability. With this theory Max: Eastman takes sharp issue in his remarkable article \Mark Twain's Elmira\ in the May Harper's. Max Eastman's family grew up with the Langdon family; as a boy Eastman himself knew Mark; and he knows whereof he is talking. \For my part,\ he con- cludes, \having grown up In the very same environment, and her <Mrs. Clemens) family among my dear friends, I think that the Elmira Influence was a vitally liberating one to Mark Twain, and that he actively, and with judgment as well as joy, observed it.\ There are several musts for the energetic reader among recent pub- lications; notably: M·a.rjorie Kinnan Rawlings' fresh and lyrical novel 'The Yearling, Lewis Mumford's The Culture o:f Cities, Harriet Monroe's D1·.

It was a good telephone, but it could he connected with only a part of the Bell System's 250,000 telephones in the country at that time. Service was slow and expensive. Year by year this strange looking telephone, with a more modern transmitter and receiver substituted from time to time, grew in useful· ness as the Bell System grew longet· in reach- shm\ter in time needed for making connections -higher in quality of service-lower in cost.

' \All policies are dictated by 'force,\· continued Dr. Schumann, . ,:\and the American conception of , :isolationism versus col·lective secur- ;ity has been rendered obsolete .by ! ·the power politics of present day !!Europe.\ We must take a realistic ! attitude in formulating om foreign · policy, and be prepared .to face the' Fascist menace In the future. No Immediate War WhHe he didn't .forsee .America engaging in war in the immediate future, Dr. Schumann declared that in the event of a Fascist triumph in An·ows indicates approximate siw O·i' new Lambda Chi Alpha house. · EuFope over a possible democratic coalition, America could· not longer be in a position to maintain a non- aggtessive policy and would have to go to war should any combina- · tion of England, France, or Russia go down in defeat. For the present, the United States should strive to promote the policy ·of reciprocal trade agreements and work for the betterment of inter- ·national economic conditions. He· declared that any coope1ation be· .tween the democracies involving the United States was impossible at present because of the knaves in control of the British government and the fools in the French. He also declared that the neutrality policy of the United States was aiding the rebels in Spain and the Japanese in their conquest of China since by not ~elling arms to the weaker .forces we were indirectlY working to defeat them and assisting then .fascist enemies.

Lewis Tuesday, May 10, 1938 YE OLDE WINDBAGGE Every few days some conscientious stu- dent is troubled with the problem of where his eleven dollar student tax goes. Perhaps he questions the usefulness of some tax-sup- ported activity. lie may even feel that he is not getting his money's worth. This same man will flaunt the corrupt practices of a certain activitj' or argue that another should be dropped as a tax-supported organ- ization to anyone who will spare a few moments to listen. But when this same per- son is given an opportunity to place his grievances befo1·e the Tax Committee, he is too busy playing cards, drinking some of the amber fluid, or enjoying the latest Dick Dare movie at his favorite picture house to attend an insipid tax hearing. Last evening- the Tax Committee held an open meeting in the Old Chapel for the ex- press purpose of sampling student opinion on whether the budg·ets of the various tax supported activities should be cut or raised next year. Exactly five membe1·s of the stu- dent body attended. To say the meeting was a farce, as far as giving the committee any- thing constructive to work with, is putting it mildly. It was a flop. Yet tomorrow, Mr. Campus Critic -will be out voicing his heart- felt grievances. Since all student activities have been co- ordinated under the supervision of Dr. Wil- liam W. Bennett, the cost of running these activities has been decreased and the tax suppmting mm·€ functions, which cost less to run. At one time, each student paid $46 per year, and the $36,000 was used to maintain .seven student activities. Now under the cen- tralized control of the coordinator, each stu- dent is taxed o11ly $11, and the $8,800 raised finances the operations of thirteen organiza- tions. Howeve1·, .all these attractive reduc-' tions should not give us that comfortable feeling that comes when everything has been done that can. There is still room for im- provement. Undoubtedly- the student tax will be raised to $12 n€xt year. This is not an espe- cially alarming- fact in itself; but the ques- tion naturaHy arises-is this raise neces- student body.

Two years ago Helmer L. Webb took over the position of librarian in a college library that was physically 1·un down. Moreover, it held a position in the mind of the average student comparable to its physical position. Since that time, with the funds at his com- mand, Mr. Webb has begun the Herculean task of reorganization of the library, in its physical aspects and in its system of staff organization. Mr. Webo and his assistants have suc- ceeded very well in their task, despite the caustic criticisms which point to the con- trary and despite financial handicaps. But, they have not .succeeded in winning over that lethargic, slowwitted organism, the stu- dent mind. That part of the collegiate an- atomy has been reluctant to give up its most joyous pass time, that of criticising institu- tions which have at some time in some way met with their disapproval. It is tru.e that the Union College Library is not all that might be desired in its mater- ial set-up. There are many books, maga- zines, mechanical facilities, etc. that are to be desired. However, it seems that they will not be forthcoming until there is an increase in the endowment of the college. A goodly sum .of the $4,000,000 goal of the adminis- tration is to be devoted to the college library. There is one thing that the average stu- dent has overlooked in his enthusiasm for criticism. That is the willingness and the helpfulness which the staff of the library manif.est at all times. They are ever ready and willing to extend themselves to the best of their by no means meagre ability to aid the members of the student body in re- search, in preparing material for r.egulat· class papers, or in merely looking for a book for class assignment or pleasure reading. Let us show OUl' appreciation to the li- brat-y staff by increased use of the library and by our abiding by its rules. C. M. F. Sam'! Goldwyn, a movie pioneer, recently steamed into the Big Town's harbor and proclaimed that Hollywood was spending too much money for its pictures and wasn't achieving the proper results. Thus, having carried coals to Newcastle, Sam left New York for the film capital, apparently with the inten- tion of remedying the situation. But some time before he visited Europe <in other words, before too many Cooks spoiled this tine !:>roth of a bye'), he produced an expensiv~ lit- tle number called The Adventures of 1\larco Polo. This feature does :Vhat Cecil B. DeMille has been try- mg to do for years, with varying degrees of success. Its story is simple enough for a five-year-old mind to grasp and its action has a universal appeal. Even the lovers of subtler techniques of film pro- duction can't help admiring the sw:ep ~nd opulence of this picture, which 1s anything but one of the Goldwyn follies. Marco Polo, as you probably know, was a thirteenth century mer- chant traveler who wrote a book about his trip to China. Some folks have been so unkind as to intimate that Marco wasn't too honest about his descriptions, but there is no doubt that he did tell Europeans of numerous Eastern phenomena of which they had never before heard. The Hollywood Polo is not more ro- mantic than the real one was. The cast of the Goldwyn produc- tion is unifor•mly excellent. Gary Cooper leaves his trade mark on Marco; Basil Rathbone is villainous as Ahmet; Alan Hale makes a re- but Kaidu; Ernest Truex is amus- ing in a minor role, and George Barbier plays the Great Khan Sigrid, gentlemen, is very nice. · The second feature would be Torchy Blane in Pa.nama. Paul Kelly and Lola Lane replace Bar- ton MacLane and Glenda Farrell in the familiar roles. We can't imagine why, unless someone want- ed Tom Kennedy to steal the show -which he does.

Geer had a 73 on the par 71 green, while Foster Brown, Van Ladd, and Ben Lord were far- superior masters over their respec- tive opponents. Captain Fritz Hawley was the cole Dutchman to suffer a setback against Vermont in the campus match Friday, but not befme put- ting up stubborn opposition in three sets. Mould, Mound Star 'The Yellowjackets capitalized on Union's very weak show In the 100 and 220-yard dash events and in the discus throw, in Saturday's meet on Alexander Field, .its stellar showing in the hurdles events by Bob Hayner, in the half-mile and mile runs by Joe Annese, and the fast jogging by Bill Hawkes in the two-mile jaunt, just falling short of victory. But lanky Al Mould went to the mound for the Dutchmen shortly afterwards and gave an excellent demonstration in upsetting the fa- vored Rochester baseball team. Every Union player contributed at least one single in the 13-hit attack. It was Union's ability to hit with. men on bases that proved to be the, deciding factor, since Mould also yielded the same number· of hits. Bob Feldman and Fred Patrie, Union's slugging duo, were aug- mented by Charley Brocknel 's steady hitting prowess. Bob Geisler, Rochester's cleanup man, who poked a long home run through the centerfield fence, led the Yellow- jacket attack. Paul Scl)res 10 Goals Union's potentia.! All-American la- crosse nominee, Captain Joe Paul, had a gala field day over the week- end caging four goals Friday against Colgate in Union's unsuc- cessful attack, but pacing the Gar- net stickmen to their first season victory against R. ~· I. ~atur?ay with six points, besides dtsplaymg his usual headup game both times.

CAROL BRUCE Rainy Weather Predicted By Campus Prophets Rain, rain, go away. Should the predictions of the campus we'l,ther prophets be any judge . this will be the theme song of the weekend. Tom the cop, man on the beat, in a statement to The Concordiensis expressed his opinion that \from the appear- ance of all present conditions there will be rain Friday and possibly Saturday.\ Dr. Frederick Bronner has a similar belief concerning the ac- tivities of the weather man. When asked for his prediction Bronner replied \rain lots of rain, with inte1 mit tent thunder and flashes of lightning. And it will probably turn to snow on Saturday hight.\ At a late hour last night Prof. E. S. C. Smith, able meter- ologlst of the college who sup- plied last year's prom weather report, could not be reached for a statement of his view of the situation. Dr. Morgan was chairman of the boar·d of directors for the Tennessee Valley Authority until the recent controversy in which he resigned. He was president of Antioch Col- lege and is one of the country's leading engineers, especially in the field of flood control. He handled more than fifty large flood control projects in fifteen different states before he became chairman of the T. V. A. In an address last October at Union College, Dr. Morgan said that the \T. V. A. is an effort to experimentally develop some de- sirable methods of social organiza- tion in America-including the uni- fied development of a great river system for all purposes, navigation. llaod control, power, recreation, fisheries, and industi·ial water sup\ ply.\ Prom Commit tee Completes Pla;ns for· Junior Weekend \College faruities and students should and do derive the continuing cooperation of proved leaders in our varied national life, who can ·bring to colleg-iate discussions the counsels of direct experience,\ said President Fox. \The eleven Hon- orary Fellows of Union College, moved by the highest philanthropy, are thus bestowing a benefit upon their institution which is beyond price.\ ---o,--- Dr. Graves Awards Scl'oli To State !Library Bead Dr. Frank P.

Logi- cally then we are to put that in- formation and insight which we can acquire from the study of the past to bear on our present pfob- lems. Mr. Hamilton, however, has given up any thought that there is a logical histori~al pattern.

Now that the old constitution has been formally thrown out, both the critics and the proponents of the new constitution should forget their minoi' differences and work to get her toward a common goal-tha. t of picking the best possil>le men for the positions on the new Council. The old constitution failed principally be- cause it failed to represent the student ·body-. Its pet·sonnel was made up mostly of men, who had earned a name for themselves on the athletic field. These men were capable of handling athletic problems, but when they were forced to consider the renovation of a college publication or the feasibility of a student concert series, they were literally stumped. Under the present system,. where every tax-supported activity is repr.esented, there will be an expert in nearly every field that the Student CoUJ~cil has jurisdictio-n over. However, it is mandatory that we elect the men who are best qualified for the posi- tions, and not those who are the most pop- In a recent fire at school all my new summer gowns were de- stroyed.

The installation of marine reduction-gears on the U. S. S. \Neptune a naval collier, marked the beginning of such propulsion for large vessels. 'This installation was made by Westinghouse in 1912. 2m Three kinds of heat are supplied by the \Corox\ surface units of a Westinghouse electric range- radiated heat, conducted heat, and convected heat. 3m George Westinghouse introduced the Parsons steam turbine to the U. S. in 1899, and built the first com- mercial turbine generator units. 4. The seven major types of rectifiers are: (1) Hot- cathode, vacuum; (2) Hot-cathode, gas-filled; (3) Dissimilar electrodes; (4) Mercury arc; (5) Electro- lytic; (6) Dry electronic; and (7) Mechanical. Sm HEUSLER, an alloy of copper, manganese and alu- minum, none of which is ferromagnetic, is itself ferromagnetic. 6. The electrified portions of the Pennsylvania Railroad use 11,000 volt alternating current, pioneered by Westinghouse. 7 • Westinghouse Station KFKX, at Hastings, Neb., was the world's first commercial \repeating\ broad- casting station. 8. The electrification in 1905, by Westinghouse, of the main rolls at the Edgar Thomson Works of the Carnegie Steel Company was· the first of its kind to be accomplished. 9. The, Westinghouse lighting of the World's Columbian Exposition, held at Chicago in 1893, was the first large-scale display of incandescent lighting ever seen. 10. A stedlamp is a tubular glass lamp containing inert gas and mercury vapor which emits ultra-violet rays lethal to bacteria when it ,is excited by an electric discharge. It was deveioped in the Westinghouse Lamp Division laboratories at Bloomfield, N. J. This completes the series of \Electrical Quiz\ questions and answers which have been published by Westinghouse to create a broader interest in electricity among college students.

Basketball Captain Schultz prepared for Union at Nott Terrace High School where he was als{) president of his class for two years. At the close of Union's past .basket ball season he was elect- ed captain of the 1938-39 season. He entered Union in the fall of 1934 and sickne.s.s during the following summer prevented him from re- turning that fall. He re-entered as a sophomore in 1936. The new senior president has played on the Union court squad for two years. During the first he played a forward po:;ition opposite former· captain Teddy Podbielski and liniohcd second to the Pod•bicl- ski in the .scoring race. This past year he was switched to a guard post and was fifth highest scorer. Dur·ing hi,; freshman year, Schultz played on the yearling football squad at a: halfbaclt post.

As our forefathers progressed in the eyes of the college, they 1·etained their class spirit by doing things.

The facts are not generally known but the La- Follette Ci vii Libel ties Committee has brought some .startling evidence to light If you are unfamiliar as to the llature of the N. A. M., take a course ill S. S. 3. There you will learn what the N. A. M. is supposed to be. According to our pt ofe.ssors, the N. A. M. is an organization to give manufactm·ers a first hand knowl- edge of bU:Sines.; conditiolls in the various parts of the country. The connotation is that mat ket condi- tions and production factors are the topics of tnterest. But the Civil Lib- erties .investigation has shown that the labOI organizations are the prin- cipal target of the N. A M. The court records of the Commit- tee read like a series of gangster Lales. Bombs, thugs, and murders fill the pages, Seldom will the !ead- ~r see such a record of oppression and intimidation. And the whole pol- icy is directed against labor. One of the principle weapons used against labor organizations is the labor spy, who, by internal espio- nage in the union, breaks the organ- ization and labor's moral. Great de- tective agencie.s furnish men to the N. A. M.; one spy organization, the Col poration's Auxiliary, was paid $76,411.81 by Chrysler Cmp. in the year 1935. Now the law is that a corporation must report to the S. E. C. all payments to ally orgalli- zation which exceed $20,000.00. To evade the statute the Chrysler Corp made itt3 payment to four separate uummy companies which are con- trolled by the Corporation's Auxi- liat y. The en tit e shady deal was originated by Chtysler for the pur- pose of destroying labor mg-aniza- tion. And the N. A. M. was the body th10ugh which Chrysler dealt with the gyp organization. Don't think that this concern is alone in its attempt to sabotage la- bor movements by industrial espio- nage. There are many other cot- porations that do equally under- handed work. The Chrysler Cor- poration ·has merely been singled out as a typical example. Just for the sake of impartiality a few more cancer ns that bought the services of spy agencies will be named. They are: Goodyear Tire and H.ubber Co., Firestone Tire alld Rubber Co., Quaker Oats Co., and the Imperial Electric Co. All these corporations art; situated in the city of Akron, Ohw; they are all members of the Employer's Association of Akron which is in tum a member of the N.A. M. No~ in. the face of such employet o.rg-amzahon and coPrcion, is it po.s- stblc to sa:y- that employers and la- bor can stand on equal terms when the latter is not orgallized? Cer- tainly it would seem that the great weight of bargaining power lays with the employer groups, In fact it might be said that the power' is dictatorial. Under the law., the right of la.bor to organize is Ullchallellged. But here we have a powerful organiza- tion of manufacturers whose pri- mary aim i.s to prevellt labor from forming unions. That policy is in itself, conkary to a federal law.' Do you still think that employer and labor have equal rights, as you a1e taught by the colltrolled press?

Old Union BY BILL KETZ In 1893 Union defeated Amster- dam in a tightJy,played baseball game, 3 to 4. On July 9, 1864 these two teams had played at Amster- dam in what was Union's second organized game of baseball. The score of that contest was 27 to 19 in favor of the Dutchmen. In 1913 Dill,. the pitcher, and Ackley, the catcher were co-captains; after a flawles~ performance a strong Wil- liams team went down to defeat, 4 to 3. This was the first defeat of Williams in baseball since 1927. Our golf team in 1933 was quite weak, winning but two matches. Williams administered the worst de- feat of the season when it tri- umphed 9 to 0. In 193!} we defeated Colgate, 4% to 1¥... In 1928 after losing to Colum- bia, C. C. N. Y., and Williams in the first three tennis matches of the year the team defeated Hamilton by the shutout score of 6 to 0. In 1935 the tennis team lost a close match to Middlebury, 5 to 4. This team managed to win but one match, defeating Colgate easily, 7 to 2. Though the other six matches were lost the only bad defeat hap- pened when Amherst trounced us in the first match of the season, 6 to 0.

It seems to me that President Fox and the trusteC's of the college have made a definite political move in naming two outstanding opponents of the national administration to high honor and rank in the Union College body, The Union-Star last Saturday noted, with childish glee, that the recent nominations by Union College were indeed protests n gain.st the Roo«evelt and liberal doctrines. I do not question he1 e the per- >onal integ-!'ity of Vandenbe1g or· A. E. Morgan. They are undoubtedly WC'II-qua lifted to instzuct young men a,nd to give a word of cautious 3nd mature advice. Equally certain, the link of 1Jn ion College with men of thh; ilk dubs this instiution the 1 e- pub!ication stronghcld of the north. In the next election Maine, Ver- mont and northern New York will I savP the coun\r y.

Using mainly for his examples scientific courses, he expressed the wish that each field of study would have more direct telationship to evety other one. That is his con- ception of true education. Dr. Langmuir also commented on the fact that the attitude that Union takes in its Honmary Fellow sys- tem is a step in the right direc- tion. The faculty pte.sented to Dr. Langmuir an illuminated scroll bearing the legend: \To Dt.

While ()th e1· institutions of higher learning aTe refusing radicals the right to speak to their impressionable :;tudents and taking an active lHll't in advocating economic boycotts a.gainst the fascist countries of Europe and Asia, t:nion has stood aloof and refused to take sides. Nationally known political rig- ures with unsavoury backgrounds and be- liefs have been welcomed he1·e; but to our knowledge, Union has not been. pa1tial to these ra.dicals--all political faiths have been propounded here at one time or anothe1·. Ii seems that the administration has acted wisely in not tr;-.·ing to influence ou1· political faiths; l.Jut instead h<es provided us with the mea.ns of hearing advocates of the major be- liefs, and then dmwing our own conclusions as to tht:-ir t•elative me1·its. When Senator Arthur \·andenberg and )-lr. A. E. 1Iorgan were appomted llononu·y Chancellor and I !ononny Fellow l'espec- tively, we believed that there was no ulterior reason for this action. Because both Mr. Van<lenl.Jerg and :\lr. :\!organ are supposedly \anti-New Dealers,\ it does not necessari!S follow that Union College is a Hepubliean THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, MAY 20, 1938 would have done rnuch better to praise tl~em !'or striking .such a balance. The posts of HonGl'<ll'Y Chancellor and llon0rat·y Fellows usually are given to 1nen who have something to offer us education- ally. The;-.· are broHght here l.Jy the college to stimulate us intel,lectuaBy. As long- a:s the men <tppointed are of a high intellectual caliul'e, we have no just complaint. Our pl'im- m·y interest in them is with what they s.ay and not to what political pmty they belong. After all, it is poor psychology to bite the hand that feeds you. THE '\HAVES\ vs. THE \HAVE~NOTS\ All h istol'y could IJe explained in a single phr·ase-a conthtaa;l struggle between the \haves\ and ''have-n.ots\. The repe1·cussions from the class elections is of the same hue. The gl'Oups that gained their eRds through smmt \deals\ are satisfied; but the other groups, who could not 01ganize quite as ef- fectively, have attacked the ''ins\ because of their so-called unscmpulous practices. As Colgate had had a similm· hypocl'itieal uprising, we would like tu take this oppOI'- tunit;-.· to reprint an editorial that r·ecently appea1·ed in The Colgate l\laroon, which of- fel'l'<l a plausible solution to the whole ques- tion. Ht'ad It-and 'Writf' Wht•n the A. T. 0'\ went White Hat, another one of these political frenzies shook the Colgate campus. About once a year something like that nudges the student body out of its coma of acceptance a.nd starts it caliing r.ames again.

ML D.

Since its in- stitution in 1878 it has been the in- tent O·f the college to choose as the ineum;bent each year some man eminent in the life and thought of his count,·y, The writer asks as to one, \How is he linked with Un- ion?\ and liltewise inq-ui-res as to the other':; \affiliation with. Union College.\ It will be reaHzed, I hope, that previous connection with the col-lege ha:; not genera-lly ·been considered as beariag 011 avail- ability. On the long list I can see but a few in whose cases such a circumstance could have weig-hed in the selection: a half dozen alum- ni in sixty years; Bishop Henty C. PoHer, wh<J was a ·b1·othel' of the late pt·esident; and Dr. Irving Langmuir, who is a much-appreci- ated nei-ghbor. Determined to halt any unseemly tendency in the policy of the trus- tees he a.'lks, \Are these men chosen ma-inl-y as a pu.blicity stunt?\ The answer is, No. Neither are the names of Honorary Chancellors and Hm10rary Fell-ows \drawn out of a hat.\ Senator Van- denberg's appointment was not made as a rebu·ke to the Interna- tional Relations Club, but, rather, on other grounds. It was thought that he was an eminPnt American, whom the college constituency would be glad to hear. Dr. A. E. Morgan, the writer· says, \might ·be a-n authority on flood-control, he might ·be an ex- college president, but will you kindly infm·m us why he was at Colgute, editor ur-on editor has lamented the fact chosen to be an honorary fellow?\ that \ditty\ politics existed upon the campus.

It is \dirty\ in one sense, but not dirty engineer but also an interesting man with a high degree of public spirit. Mr. D.

I once played with the idea of suggesting that the seniors partici· pate in the choice of the Honorary Chancellor, but I was dissuaded from it, on practical grounds, by a number of the Student Council.

Page Four THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, MAY 20, 1938 CULLS ·FROM THE PRESS W-r: we: e much attracted by the etl ucational .fabric which Dr•. James Brya.n ~ Conant, president of Har- vard U-nive1·sity wants to weave .at .J:-Iarvar tl Univet sity. H:e sees four dominant thi·eads tn Amet·ican life wltieh should be blencled and mer-ged at the univer·:,;ity mill. First he c·tleo t!Le tlllet~cu uf -in\ullectual athotocracy typified by the young sons whose fami.\ies have had lead- tn.g p<Hls Hl the oucial, cultural and t·eug-rotls development of the coun- u·y. '!.hen comes am;ther thread ot ecom>mtc power and wealth typt- Ited 'by the scions of the powerful llld\Istl-ial families. To these u u e:ach of blue ar·e to ·be added a two mot·e of democratic origin ... one repre>'entmg the latent intel- lectual power of the nm.sses and the uthet ttll' ma\\. it,L\If which needs 1 to be educa.ted ltberally and br•oadly. 1< or sa-Ke of cleser tptwn we wtU ~<J:ll tlle»e laot tw,; threads red. The -lir;;;t three grCJups mentioned will be t·h<' leader·s ot the nation, tor ,[hem the pt ofe:;oimw:l schools will b~ en Jar ged in function. The po<Jt' but intelt·igent student will be ti nanced •by a s!trling scale of schol- arships tu be regulated by the I amount of mcmey we can earn or' recerve from hio family. The last 1 gruup. the mass, will receive the b 10auening and liber·atmg collegu':te t 1<at n rng to lit them for a fuller hfe wtth no vocational motive in the background .... This last group is to be accepted a:; a concession to the J ac ksunian princtple for· educa- t ioa for all. The one pht ase that caught our intc>rest was that the.se group~ were to :be blendeu \in the proper pro- portions\ so that neither red or blue would dominate but that thE' whole would present a dull crim- ,.;oa true Harvarrl products .... In br·oaching his plan fur schol- Ht·~ hip,; Dt. Conant took full cog- nizance .of the evils way to which the scholarship-giving game had decended .... He t'emarked that tlltee per cent of the people in the cotintry were making $5,000 or bet- ter and 20 per cent wete making $2,()00 ot more. _ .. Out of this grou.p per:sumable come the 11 per cent of the- youth in the countt·y who at- tend coll~ge .... His purpose is to gu beyond this group to r·ecruit the intellectual talent into that un- touched and unexploited 80 percent. Th-e scholar:;hip in the new sen:;e wil I bring them in .... The difftculty has been that all the colleges have been fishing in the same small pond to enroll students and ha. ve offered scholar:>hips to un- der-serving and wealthy :;tudents as an inducement to choose one cul- lel':e rather than another ... - A c~llege offers a scholarship to a prorninen t st-udent because it feels he might be a dr·awing carrl for other boys in his home town .... It might offer scholat \hips to nth- let es t not entirely undefensible) for their earning power in intercol- legiate competition. Dr. Conant would give a new meaning to scholarship. He hopes to give t·enai,;sance to the old Jc>f- fersoaian plan to train the intel- lectually elite drawn fr·om all eco- n()Jnic levels and allow them to as- sume places as leaders of a stUtdy democracy.

Chemistry (\e Ing Eleven n~en were The Potter pot trait Is a copy made by Adrian Lamb of a con- tempomry painting done by Sully in Philadelphia in 1831. This i,; the gift of the Potter· family. Alonzo Potter, ati well as his de- acendants, has played an impor- tant part in the history of Union. He was a son-in-law of Dr. Elipha- let Nott and at one time a mem- ber of our faculty. Later as Bishop of Pennsylvania in the Protestant Episcopal Church he attained dis- tinction, and throughout his whole life was devoted to his college. Dr. Er·n~t A. Hauser·. associate professor of Chemical Engineering at the Ma;;sachusetts In~titute of Technology and noted colloidal ex- pert, :opol\e Wednesday evening in the Buttetfleld Chemistry Labora- tory on the topic \Modern Aspects in ihe Th<'ory of Gel Structures.\ Dr. Hauser primarily made con- tributions substantiating older· the- ories. especially the Bound Water Theory of Emuh•ions. In hi;; dis- cussion of this theory he brought up two others. both closely related to this topic the Micellular Theoty and .the Emulsion Theory. \I do not wish to rlisprove any t·xisting theories,\ he affirmed, \but I desire to show that we have sys- tems which gel mat·velously and cannot be explained by present hypotheses.\ In his address Dr. Ha u~er stressed the wot\l\ of such men as L'sher· and Dr·. Hammocker of Holland. Dr. Hauser announced the appli- cation of the centerfuge in the ob- taining- of gel stt uctures composed of particles of unifor·m size.

The portrait of John Howard Payne was painted by a Cleveland artist, A. M. Willard, from a daguerreotype. The owne1·, C. H. Brainard, placed it on sale in a Boston gallery where it was pur· chased by friends of Payne's niece. Mrs. E. E. Luquer, and was given her as a Christmas present in 1882. Colonel Luquer ha.s been a valued friend of the college since 1911 when he took part in the exercises dedicating the John How- ard Payne Gal<'way. On that oc- casion he spoke on the circum- stances which led to the writing of \Home Sweet Home,'' and shared with the late Professor George Baker and Alma Gluclt the main roles in the exercises.

In the event of -rain, the contest will take place on Friday, May 27. The Sing' gives Union's fraternities, which have been practicing college and fraternity songs throughout the year, an opportunity to perform publicly in competition for a num- ber of awards. Each fraternity will be asked to sing two songs. The fi-rst must be a college song selected from the following: The Terrace Song, Come Now to the Campus, The Dutch· man Song, and It's Union's Game. The second will be a fraternity song. All the groups competing will open the contest by singing in unison the college song, If You Want to Go to Union, and will close .the competition with the Alma Mater. Announce Judges The judges will be Dr. Elmer Tidmarsh, Director of Music; Pro- fessor Charles Male, Director of the Band; and Professor Warren Taylor, Chapel Organist. First place award will be a sil- ver cup, donated by the music de- partment of the college. This cup becomes the permanent possession of the fraternity which wins it three times. Three houses have each won it two times thus far: Delta Upsilon, last year's winner; Psi Upsilon, and Kappa. Alpha. Since any of these fraternities may retire the cup this year, competi- tion is unusually keen. Second and third place awards will be en- graved silver cigarette boxes, pre- sented by the Interfraternity Council, sponsor of the Sing. Several fraternities have already indicated their intention of enter- ing the Song Contest. These in- clude Alpha. Delta Phi, Delta Upsilon, Kappa Alpha, Kappa Sigma, Phi Gamma Delta, Theta Delta Chi, and Psi Upsilon. All fraternities are urged to enter and those wishing to do so should notify Carl Trahman at the Kappa Sigma House by Tuesday, May 24.

That diB- ~ipline may be voluntary but is 1one the less sever·e. The totalitar- mn :;tales have evolved an effec- tive, and in some ways admirable, discipline because they know that undisciplined minds cannot form a strong society. \A system that aims at personal .fl·eedom must in practice put all that einpha.sis on personal ·respon- sibility, and on producing minds that can take it.

The Commencement hines articles dealing or campus affairs with lection of literary and materiaL issue com- with local a good se- intellectual Last Junior Garnet Praised By Critic By HE:N,RY M. SEIDER The 1939 Gamet, edited by T. D. 0. Stevenson, which appeared on the campus Wednesday, rep- resents a tremendous improve- ment over past years in external appearance, features, and general malte-up, and an equally note- worthy decline in pictorial merit. It is unfortunate that a very fine book, dedicated to a very fine man, Alumni Secr,etary Charles N. Wal- dron, should reveal on its first pages the fuzziest images of Dr. Waldron which modern photo- graphical ingenuity could devise. Class, .fraternity, organization and individual pictures in general share that much-lamented tenden- cy toward obliteration. A photo- graph of the 1937 lacrosse team looks like a post-impressionistic painting of scrambled eggs. The bloated countenance of J. Law- rence Hennessey, '38. nestling monstrously among a crowd of small thirty-niners, unfortunately appears in excellent focus. The \local'' material includes \Uncle Willy Remembers,\ inter- esting anecdotes of life at Union told in an in.teresting fashion. Mr. Mulvey includes the \hitherto un- known\ facts regarding the recent Concordy Carouse fiasco. Skidmore Lore Recorded Jabie's \And All Points Nm th\ records Skidmore lore for posterity and will raise a lot of eyebrows. It should help Union lads ·in find- ing their way around the wilds. of Saratoga. \The Balance Sheet,\ columnar comment on happenings at Union is terse and positive in its opin- tion. The author spares the feel- ings of none in remarking on the Mohawk Drama Festival and other campus matters; we cannot ap- prove of his anonymity much as we like his comment. On the literary side of the ledger we have \Pandora's Box\ by Tony Sharpe who is probably the best writer on the campus. His short story contains some very lively dialogue. Henry M. Seider's wit and learn- ing are much in evidence in his \When the Muses Got Kicked in the Pants,\ a discussion of the wmld's worst poetry.\ Modern Sketch Presentoo \Boys Don't C1y'' is a sketch written in the modern tradition. It has no plot; its purpose is to stimulate the imagination and stir the sympathies of the reader. Per- haps Albert Mould's Julian will get a tear from some reader but here's one boy who couldn't cry over him. The academic procession was usheted into the chapel by Andre\v Dryburgh, \28 present exchange s~udent from St. Andrews. and John S. \Void, '3R, Union's Pxchange student last year, The Glee Club then sang .. Now, Let Every Son Adore Thee,\ by Bach. Professed Harold A. Larrabee in- troduced Dr. Willis R. Whitney, of the Board of Trustees, who charged Dr. Fox with the power to make the award. In making the presenta- tion, Dr. Fox commented upon the very high esteem in which Dr. Irvine is held in this country and in Scotland, and of the friendly re- lations between the two colleges. Irvine Responds Dr. Irvine acknowledged the de- gree, declaring that he was no longer merely a friend of Union College, but now a member of the college. He att1 ibuted the gn~wth of the academic bond between Union and St. Andrews to the fact' that each college is trying to do the same thing, in the same way, that they both have a romantic. setting, history, and that they both came into being in times of tribu- lation for their own countries. He then told of the events pro- ceeding the address of Sir James' Barrie on the occasion of his elec- tion as honorary rector of St. An- drews last year. Barrie's address was upon the virtue of courage, which he lllustrated by the letter of the explorer, Captain Scott, writ- ten to him as Scott was making a futile attempt to return from the South Pole. Dl'. Irvine closed with an ex- hortation to the students to seek the reward C>f the intellectual search for truth. ---0·--- Sinister Events Disturb Peace; Professor Flees A certain physics professor, fresh fwm hi,; tr·iumph in \One People,\ was wandering along ·in front of the physics labom- tory last Friday night, enjoying the fresh night air and pon- dering the weighty problems to be considered in classes the next morning, when a strange sight met his eyes. A:s he approached the Kappa Alpha Gate, long since locked for the night, a young lady came catapulting over the ten- foot fence. She was followed in quick succession by two more damsels, and a moment later three students cIa m be red across. Aghast at this unprecedented occurrence, the startled pro- fessor turned and dashed away, shaking his head and mutter- ing imprecations upon the dis- turbers of the peace. Local Bagpipers Serenade Irvine By JOHN LEWIS Alm~ander Merriman, '38, \stole the show\ when. they innovated a .bi- cycle act before taking the ros- trum to sing their \Alouette\ songs. To the strains of a special accompaniment, written around the whole ceremony, by Hugh H. Sharpe jr, '38. Mulvey and Mer!\i- man, garbed in caps and gowns, entered the Chapel on bicycles and rode up the two side aisles, turned around and came back down, then rode up the center aisle, parked their vehicles, and took the rostiUm. While they wet·e making their tour of the Chapel they tipped their caps to everyone assembled. New Terrace Council \Tapped\ While next yeai\'s senior clas·s marched, around the chapel, the Terrace Council waited on the ros- trum for its prey. The future sophomores and juniors waited with abaited· breath for the \tap- pingping\ of the new Council. A.fter the present junim·s had cil·- cled the chapel several times, Wil\ !iam Hawkes, '38, leaped from. the rostrum and \tapped\ Lon H. Bal'- ringer. Then Robert Hayner was tapped by Joseph Paul; Frederick W. Hequembourg, by Carl R. Trahman; David B. Miller, by John S. Wold; Benjamin Rathbun, by Frederick B. Hawley;•William T. Thomas, by Hyman A. Enzer; and David L. Yunich, by Winter- ton Day. The cover, puffed out and grainy, is the finest one I've ever seen on a U. C. publication. Page decora- ticC1s and general format are very appealillg and in excellent taste. rhe accounts of fraternities and activities are uniformly well writ- ten. while several pages of \Life at Union\ pictures, scattered throughout the book, provide that always sought-for human interest. We would go about half way with Louis C. Maples in his protest against \Fonetic Speling.\ But when he starts talking about \de- cently educated\ men and spelling Ieformers who are a \personal offence\ and a \dange•·ous nui- sance\ we would leave him right there. Sophomores Elect New Class Officers It was not a Nott Terrace v\c- tory parade that roused Union stu- dents from lethargic !lingering over term papers at nine o'clock Wednesday evening but the ba;g- pipe and drum corps of the local post of British Empire War Vet- erans of America marching across the campus to the strains of \Chorie Choly Teri Bus\ to sere- nade Sir James Irvine, Principal of St. Andrew's University, at the ·Fox residence.
