Zeitler, '24 Saturday, Arpril 1, 1922 STUDENT ELECTIONS Increasing dissatisfaction with the results o{ student elections, especially during the past few years, and general condemnation of the manner in which many important matters of business are \rail- roaded'' through student body and class meetings through intention, impatience and lack of time, certainly indicate that steps should be taken to so amend tl1e constitution oi the student body that the sup- posed ev•ils are corrected. In justice to all concerned, it must be said that the present condition of aHairs may be blamed to no organiza- tion, 110 individual. It is simply the working out of things in the shop <>i time-the bitter result o:[ good intentions functioning im- perfectly-. H: is too much to expect that several hundred students, who have sat through several hottrs of classes and attended chapel-many of them without sleep the previous night and with little or no break- 1 fast; oth.ers with their mind fixed unconsciously but surely on the J next meal or an aiternoon engage·ment-it is quite too much to ex- pect that these men will pause any great length oi time for a serious cons!<le!'ation o:[ student business, even though it directy eHects them. Add to the majority of interested studenl:!s, the inevitable sullen dissatisfied and disinterested minority, existing under similar condi-j tions a.s their more numerous brethern-. there are further grounds for election mistakes and political errors. Combine the two groups mentioned with a third-\lob'byists\ who -would :force their .previously understood affairs through without I general recognition by the student body of what is being put across -and the setting oi the average student meetings and election is complete. This does not begin to take into consideration the numer- ous other influences which may have a direct bearing on the arffair. Slight changes in the constitution should work wonders. In the :first place, as far as election to oHice is concerned, the present di:f- ficulties may be remedied by making student body and class meet- ings a primary or caucus :for a later election. Members of the assem- blage should be given every opportunity to make nominations from the floor-as many as they desire-and no office should be awarded with~ut competition between at least two candidates. When the nominations have been made and approved, they should be posted by the secretary on the college bulletin board for at least one week .and should also be given mention in the press. .At the end oi the week and upon a publicly designated day, a voting booth should be opened to all students interested in the elec- tion. Voting should by by secret printed ballot and conducted under the supervision of trustworthy and capable inspectors, appointed to the position from sufficiently extensive sources to prevent any possi- bility oi :illegal or untoward action. The results should be announc- ed by means o:f the bulletin board, the press and at the ensuing meet- ing{):[ the interested unit-class or student body. the r•eoord tlhat had :been est'ablisllled' in , nation. the Ol'~mpilc Games.

But only recently has science really explained the electrical phenomena of the thunderstorm. Dr. C. P. Steinmetz expounds this theory. Rain- drops retain on their surfaces electrical charges, given off by the sun and other incandescent bodies. In falling, raindrops combine, but their surfaces do not increase in proportion. Hence, the electrical pressure grows rapidly, Finally it reaches the limit the air can stand and the lightning flash results. And now we have artificial lightning. One million volts of elec.tricity-approximately one fiftieth of the voltage in a lightning flash-have been sent success~ fully over a transmission line in the General Engineer~ ing Laboratory of the General Electric Company. This is nearly five times the voltage ever before placed on a transmission line. Much valuable knowledge of high voltage phenom- ena-essential for extending long distance trans- mission-was acquired from these tests. Engineers now see the potential power in remote mountain streams serving in industries hundreds of miles away. Man-made lightning was the result of ungrudging and patient experimentation by the same engineers who first sent 15,000 volts over a long distance thirty years ago. \ Keeping everlastingly at it brings success.\ It is difficult to forecast what the results of the next thirty years may be.

The election was held last Saturday afternoon, in the trophy room of the gymnasium, all \U\ and \aUa\ men, being eligible to vote. During his prep school days, at Geneva High School, Simmons was the star court performer, and captain of the powerful red and black quintet in his Senior year at that institution. Later he played on a fast Navy team, enlisting in Akron, where his home I is at present. In his freshman year, \Simmie\ led the fastest yearling quintet that Union has ever boasted of.

The statement may be challenged, but both types are pleasing ' ly displayed by student workers in the first annual chemistry show held in the Butterfield Memorial Laboratory building this week. The \\.'OJ;k of the students in preparing such a display is commendable, for it bespeaks an interest in a chosen profession and a desire to accom-. , plish results along definite lines, which should ever be encouraged.

The r<tlpid develop- ment of- t'he science at this time made new apparatus and equipment impera- tive. Pmfessor Perkins ;pleaded ·w·ith President Potter that the need:s of the laboratory were great. \The prindpa:l needs are water and gas\ he wrote .to <the president. 1 'Water is now all pumped 'by hand~Gas is almost iru- dispei1sible. Its aibsence stamps the ; ' ., ' I ;! It was only a few years ago that a group of students gathered j: one noon in what was then the woods near the electrical laboratory, to witness the turning of the first sod for the Butterfield chemical laboratory building. Dean Ellery handled the shovel which un- earthed the way to the foundation and promised in a short following a-ddress, that the clay meant the beginning o:f a new era in the chemis- try at Union. How he has accomplished the agenda proposed that tley in the woods, amid the splutter of campus-made fireworks and ;tb-e .cheers of enthusiastic students, is today revealed 111 more than nne way, but very tangibly in the chemical exposition. FINCHLEY At\NNOUNCES Every student on the campus should make an earnest endeavor to Yisit the show this week and to see the results of the labors o1 fel- ow students and of scientists in the world outside. No other science tuday possesses the putency of chemistry fo make or to mar the {u- tnre of civilization ,to cause peace or war, to build or to destroy. It 1& well to be informed as to what is being done along scientific lines, and. the d.isplay this week affords good opportunity.

The chemistry department i The future expansion of the work of the Department of Chemistry at the Colle.ge will lbe along ldnes of original research, a normal re- S·UJlt of its past. A gradual, constant growth over a period of years is oHe of the best assurances of continued a,dvance. The future of any movement that 'has taken a long time to develop is frequently best understood from its his- tory. It took fourteen years for the introduction and development in the curricula of the co1lege of fundamental chemistry co·urses. A course leading to the Bachelors' Degree in Chemistry was the natural outcome. Such a eourse re·quir,es opportunity for resear·ch work on the part of candidates for that degree, since these are the days of constructive chemistry, rather than of analytical chemistry. That does not mean that there are no new problems for the ana:ly- tica! chemist. There will always be such and every chemical curriculum will include analytical chemistry. It does mean that the im.portant prob- lems for ind11st-ry and for human life in general demand constructive chemists .. Hence, students in 'the modern chemistry course must train to do research work in the science. Tha,t explains why U~1ion has a re- search department in chemistry already well started.

This was Union's first opportunity to show the stuff and there never was ally doubt of her superior . ball playing. The college team touch- ed the opposing pitchers good and fre- quent while the e nion pitchers were finding no trouble in striking them out. Coach \Vittner had a truly wonder- ful opportunit:y to see his talent in action. Eighteen men were registered as playing for Union and only the fact that the rest were taking stick exams kept the number down. £\reryone that \Yas in uniform had a chance to per- form and it is evident a wealth of ma- terial is available.

The new committee feels that certaia minor features can be improved and more time s·hould be left for ac- tivities not under the control of the committee itself. One of the minor changes under consideration is the moving of the events of Alumni Night to the morning of Alumni Day. At the close of the procession the classes will adjourn to Alexander Field where class stunts, undergraduate singing, etc., will be held prior to the Alumni luncheon. All of the undergraduate classes have appointed stunt committees to \vork up the performances to be given in June. On the senior committee are Horning, Tude, Hale, and Collins. The junior committee consists of De Lima, Lenz, Strain, Naylon and Hortsman. Schroedel, Cross, Sheehan and Scham- berger form the iOPhomorc committeP while the frosh are represented by Crocker, Cramer and Shapiro.

Fortenbaugh, Jr. '23 Tuesday, April 11, 1922 ONE LAST WORD It is with genuine regTet that the retiring board of The Con- corcliensis presents, this, the final issue uncler its direction, for the year just passecl has been one of much happiness and service. The regrl.'t is tempered, howeYer, by the knmxledge that the new hoard is capa!Jk awl amhiti()us uf carrying· out the policies which ha,·e mark- ed the paper since its beginning ancl of publishing a ne\vs sheet which will in eHry ·n-ay do creclit to the college. To them should be g·iven the earnest support of every student, coupled with the maintenance of an interest which shall assure for it a leading place among the many campus actidties. It would he altogether unjust should the retiring board fail to thank the student body fur the hearty support given ancl the interest shown during the past year. \Vithout such signs of endorsement on the part of the students, the publication of a paper would be a dreary task ancl unpleasant. \Nith it, the work is lightened because the feeling is obtained that the paper is doing real service. The retiring hoarcl feels that its efiorts cluring the year· have been \Yorthy ancl that any improvements in the paper have been nut- eel \\·ith appreciation. The \\'ay has not been smooth nor the task easy. The hoard has made enemies; they arc appreciated for they incncase endeavor. The board has made friends; they are enjoyed f(Jr they make life more livable. But in every effort, goocl or ill as may have been the resnlt, the hoard has endeavored to act for the greater glory of the college ancl to present a newspaper that worthily represents Union.

Heavy paper outside-secure foil wrapping inside and the revenue stamp over the end to seal the pack- age and keep it air-tight. And note this! There's nothing flashy about the Camel package. No extra wrappings that do not improve the smoke. Not a cent of needless expense that must come out of the quality of the tobacco. Camels wonderful and exclusive Quality wins on merit alone. Because, men smoke Camels who want the taste and fragrance of the finest tobaccos, expertly blended.

This was the e 1 e v at o r installation. When they needed elevators in keeping with this structure of white Hungarian marble and sandstone, there was only one firm considered-the international firm of Otis. Two passenger elevators wei'e supplied, and in those days they were used by th.e Emper- or, members of the .Royal Household, and guests. That was more than twenty years ago.

The Brooklyn Poly game, which was to have been played Saturday was called off OH account of rain. The N. Y. U. contest was the first of the sea·son for the Garnet team, whereas it was the former's sixth, and the Union nine plainh showed the lack of experience and organization. In the first seven innings Union was ahle to obtain only two hits off Platt, the Violet twirler. Heidorf, who started on the mound for the Garnet pitched eight innings, when he ·was relieved by Baker. The Union team was weak be- hind the bat owing to the illness of catcher Dold who was UllaJble to play. Palmer, who filled in behind the plate was at a disadvantage due to water on the knee. Columbia easily scored and won a loosely played, one-sided affair. Baker, who was Coach Wittner's selection, was unable to hold the hard hitting New Yorkers.

'e ct . 1 * * * * * The ne1Y editors clo not enter upon their duties with trepidation I and prayer. Our predecessors have instructed us thoroughly ancl, well: the gratitude of the staff can best he shown by worthy en- 1 clcavor. The Concorcliensis board accepts its new responsibilities 1 with the promise to keep constantly in mind the best interests of Un- i ion college, <mel \\'ith the belief that criticism is the foundation of irn-! provement and achievement. Bttt to he more definite in policy, there are three ideals \\'hich The Conconliensis ,,·ill recognize as paramount. The ennmcration of these will suffice for an introduction. I First. this is a XE\YSPAPER. If an item is not of general and, immcdiatl' interl':->t ThL· C()nconliensis \\·ill not carry it. Cuntrarily. this paper shall ha\·e failed if any pertinent article of new informati011l is omittcd. The staff \\·ill continue the policy of the retiring lward, I helie1·ing- that. \number of stories, not length, make a ne\Yspaper. /\; news story is of value :\0\V. :\ little something is better than no· i tl1ing. Print only what you know.\ Second. this is a COLLEGE :\'E\VSPAPER. I i ! Being a college i I puhlic<ltion, a high standard of literary production is to be expected 1 and reason<1hlv recjttired. The ])o;;ucl of editors does not holrl it irn- 1 - I po::;sible to write news grammatically. Stylistic excellency will be 1 demanded of reporters. The DICTIONARY, GRAM.YIAR ancl: I~f-TETORTC are the tools of a newspaper man. Our ambition is so! elcYated as to include the approbation of the English department. I Third. tl1i s is YOUR COLLEGE >JEVISPAPER. On the I g·rouncl of this fact, the student body owes its co-operation. The I boarcl of editors is under no misapprehension as to its position-this paper is not a creator but a purveyor of student opinion. This board clemanrls ancl neecls assistance in order that our endeavor may he worthy of UNION college. The Concordiensis is regarded as there- flection. uf the college and students. As long as it continues to be a genuine reflection, there need be no fear that it will be criticized as nnworthy. Which will next year's captain wear? I.

This is no affront to underclassmen. Years of steady plugging must go before you can handle the man-sized responsibility of running a team. That this is just, seniors will be the first to assert. They haveseenhow wellit worksforteamandcol- lege. Then let the seniors l{eep this point of view, for soon they wiU find how closely the principle applies to themselves in the business world. Captains of industry are not made overnight. Don't expect to step into a managership right awuy. Before you can lead, you've got to serve in the ranks awhile. This is best for your organization and. best for you. The time and energy you put in working up from the bottom. taking the bitter with the sweet, getting the upperhand over your job, will stand you in good stead when you have won through to executive position. \Vhen you have learned how to handle detail work, you can begin intelli'gently to direet other men to do it, and thus free yourself for creative planning.

ON CHOOSING ELECTIVES Did· you ever see a blind baseball team listening to a lecture by a deaf mute on the value of \Thermodynamics?\ Certainly not- there is no congruity to such a picture. Its·incoherency makes it im- possible of educated credence. But you have seen the college student who selected his electives without any regard for their cohesion and many times, even without a thorough kno\'dedge of what the sub- ject consisted. It is perfectly possible for any junior or senior to elect a course -which would include Greek, Biology, Calculus, Elementary Argu- mentation, and The Bible. Most men, however, would not select Greek or Calculus because those subjects have the reputation o{ be- ing clifiicul t. It is a regretab le fact that so little attention is p aiel by the undergraduates to the selection of their elective subjects. Every man has experienced the desire to change one or ~ore of his studies. There is plenty of evidence to the fact that students either select their courses by the trial and error method or have a misconception of what is included in certain electives. It is not to be reasonably expected that real work can be done in 1 a course which commands no inter-est from the student. Careful selection from advance information is the only panacea for lack o{ attentive interest. Know what is included in the subject you elect. I The college catalogue is pubhshed for the purpose of consnltaion. In, it you will iincl an outline of every course. Don't jump to the conclu-! sion that metaphysics is. a ·c-ourse in harp playing by Dr. Richmond., Further, all electives should be chosen with some definite pur- pose in view. Classes should be macle to associate themselves, so that the benefits dcrind from each may dovetail into some really worth -while whole. Rag tags of information have no market valne. There must be some coherence and direction to knowledge to g·ive it a prac- tical dollar and cents quotation. Perhaps the strongest argument from the standpoint of the student is that coherence of electives makes for less work. STUDENT BODY SUPPORT The Concorcliensis may be a purveyor and not a creator of the attitude -of the student body, but it is the hope of the editors that the attitude of the student body will be better evidenced than it was last Saturday, during the baseball game with Lehigh. In that disastrous fifth inning, one might have expected the disinterested spectator to lean' the bleachers or .at least to cease his cheers. Bttt there is l-ittle excuse for the depreciating attitude the student body assumed when the team was being \licked\ properly. The editors know that it is \old stuff'' to criticise the student body {or not showing the proper spirit and that such criticism is to l'ncourage the appelation \bromide\. But matters are coming to ti. pretty state of affairs when the members of a team come and request that the student body be \razzed\ for their poor support o:C a team. ::\ o one is more conscious oi the attitude o£ the student body than the player himself, especially when that spirit is demonstrated by leaving the bleechers. There is no question but that the baseball team representing the college is the best to be collected :from the ma- terial at college. Not to support that team, is to be ashamed oi your- self.

It's the best packing science has devised to keep cigarettes fresh and full flavored for your taste. Heavy paper outside-secure foil wra:pping inside and the revenue stamp over the end to seal the pack- age and keep it .air-tight. And note this! There's nothing flashy about the Camel package. No extra wrappings that do not improve the smoke. Not a cent of needless expense that must come out of the quality of the tobacco. Camels wonderful and exclusive Quality wins on merit alone. Because, men smoke Camels who want the taste and fragrance of the finest tobaccos, expertly blended. Men smoke Camels for Camels smooth, refreshing mildness and their freedom from ciga,- retty aftertaste. Camels are made for men who think for them- selves. R. J.
