Farrell said that he would show what Christianity's place has been, is at present, and should be, in world progress. The discussion is designed to be of interest to any church goer. He will point out what he believes should be our views on religion and on esthetic subjects. Asked if he thought the graduate body has the right atti- tude at present, he replied: \Yes they have the right attitude, but they need discussion and guidance on certain points.\ This forum follows those of Dr. Ernest M. Ligon who spoke on The Psychology <Jf Prayer,\ ancl Dr. Burges Johnson, who spoke Friday on \The Ethics of The Press.\ The remainder of the dis- cussions are as follows: Dr. George Danton; \Some Phases of Religion in China,\ March 18; Dr. Joseph Doty, \The Oxford Group Move- ment,\ April 13. '!\he use of minimum scenery, cross beams of light, and masks in a play like TilE' Crier, which is a mystical treatment of the 'Eternal triangle', is very fitting, for it more or Jess anesthetiZNl the sense of sight and allows one to concen- trate on the blank verse of the di- alogue. The masks employed in Tl1e Criel' were well concieved, Van Gogh would have l'eveled in the crude peasant types. The confine- ments of a mask did not prevent the actors from enunciating clear- ly and entoning their expressions. There was, however, no excuse for not using a modification of the fa.lsetto voice in the female roles; Maurice Maeterlinck once had the desire to write a play about an old man sitting on. his door•step thinlung. Richau:l Rowley in his J>ab at BaHyauchlls comes uncom- fortably close to Maeterlinck's ideal.

Doig Tuesday, March 3, 1936 EXPEDITION TO THE CAPITOL 'l'he departure of a large group of students to the public hearing on the Nunan Bill in Albany this uftemoon eli llW.JIOes a campaign \Vhich has been as exciting· as it was inten- sive. Neve1· has the student oody been so actively interested in any single question which was 110t of pmely local import. Al- though many members of the delegation at- tending the hearing \Venl more \to se(' t lw show\ than because of a bm·ning sense of justice, it is safe to :;ay that the great ma- jority of the Union College stndent oody are at least pas.sively opposed to the proposed loyalty oath law. A distinctive feature of this aftemtwn't\ expedition to beard the legislative lion in his den, is the minority group. who at·e g-oing- along· too, bearing their rival petition. Vnion will probably be the only college at the hear- ing having representatives for both sides of the question. This gToup has done much to enliven the campaign against the bill as far as the Union campm; was concemed. They gave the official committee their baptism of fi!·e before the real test came. And evet·y- thing seems to indicate that they will reap a bountiful harvest of publicity this after- noon. The minority committee, however, has been careful to make clear th.e logical intri- cacies of their position: they- are not so much in favor of the Nunan Bill as they are op- posed to the opposition to it. This is a fine point-too fine, we are inclined to think, for the average legislative mind. Indeed, om dim but tenacious recollections of plane ge- ometry make their precise position hazy even to us. We go to Albany to tell the legislatu1·e they are opposed to students' going to Al- bany to tell the legislature? The case for the opponents of the Nunan Bill has been persuasively su:nmJed up in the statement which Richard Snyder, spokesman for the delegation, will deliver and defend. How the Education Committee of the leg-is- lature will act remains to be seen. But one thing is certain, if the bill is recommended by the committee the fig-ht against the bill will not stop. We will continue to contest the measure to the last ditch.

M. G. A. forum Friday nig-ht. Both men pre- sented different aspects of the same prob- lem: the effect of mechanization and over- specialization.

The least important charg·e ag·ainst mod- em joumalism 1:::> that newspapers are cor- t·upted by owners with selfish interests. ac- cording to Dr. Johnson. This belief would seem to be one exception, at least, to the opinion voiced by the ex-president. Placing- more emphasis on the fact that the public now demands entertainment ahead of infor- mation, Dr. Johnson's inference again seems to bear out the charge of Dr. Richmond. As a result of having all his desires satisfied by a touch of the proverbial button, man ha.s become apathetic, and has lost interest in everything but himself. He would be amused. Beyond that, his intellect has been ground up in the cogs. With the disappearence of the individual newspaper owner who felt personally respon- sible for what \vas printed in his paper, there has arrived the utterly impersonal syndicate. This idea appears to fit perfectly the theme: \As the mechanics of life have become more complex and confusing, individuality has di- minished and self-respect with it, for it i-s hard to keep his self-respect when he is lost.\ So the two men who have devoted their lives to a study of their fellow men sounded a warning- and offered a little advice.

All but Dr. Farrell, Plummer, and Steven.son are Schenectadians. Admittance to Sigma Xi .is not based primarily upon a scholarship average, but upon promise of inves- tigative ability and distinctive work on soine field of pure or applied sci- ence. Dr. Farrell, here since 1932, was educated at Lebanon Valley College and at Harvard, where he was awarded his Ph. D. In 1931 he at- tended the University of Munich on a Rockefeller Foundation Fellow· ship in the International Bureau of Research. He is a member of the American Mathematical Society, and has read several papers before meetings of that group. Dul\ing the war, Dr. Farrell served as a private in the infantry. Howe, a physicist, is a resident of Scotia, and a graduate of the Hali· fax: County Academy. Tytko, a graduate of the Mont Pleasant High School, is a student in the mathematics and science courses.

Bob Madi- gan's haymaker left, pr·oved a bit too much. for the gaine Tony' N ar- dacci, ;3-lthough he also htJ.d a hard punch and showed plenty of fight. Jack Nott displa.yed as much knowiedge of boxing as anyone in the ring in completely outclassing his opponent of the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, Ralph Denton. However, Ralph could not be knocked out, and after falling down several times in the first two rounds, came back much stronger In the final .stanza. Phi lLittle used his left to good advantage in continuously pushing the fight. for three rounds against Earl Sanderson in the 165-175 pound class. Phil almost !mocked himself o-ut in the thii'd round when he ran intO< earl's bowed head, but he recuperated in time to gain the decisio-n. Jalte Amazon, with two first round knoclw.uts to his credit, had little difficulty gaining a de- eision over Henry Clay in the light heavyweight class, for the Kappa Alpha boxer lacked aggression and bowed his head too often. One of tbe best bouts of the eve- ning was the welterweight contest between Bill Reynolds and Harry Myers. Both men came out swing- ing in the first :r·ound, but Bill's supet•ior left soon had the cross- country star groggy and after two knockdo--wns, was barely saved by the bell on a third. In the second round Myers looked refreshed, but after two hard punches on the chin he hit the canvas with a bang and many thought he was there to stay. :a;owever, aftet' taking a count of nine, and then having his shoe string tied, he finished out the round with plenty of vigor.

FOlll' Union Represeats Rumania at Model League Assembi! Six Union Students Delegates To Weekend Sessions Held at Vassar Many Colleges Attend Numerous Committee Meet· ings Feature Annual Assem- bly Opened Last Night Three principal questions are be- ing discussed and acted upon at the Model League of Nations As- sembly in a three-day session which began last night at Vassar College. Most hotly contested subject on the agenda wiH probably be eco- nomic .sanctions. The committee on this touchy question, headed by William Duvel, of Lafayette, chairman, and John Hall, '36, of Union, rapporteur, anticipates a bitter struggle framing a program which will be acceptable to all the \nations\ represented at the mock international assembly. International Assistance Other questions which are ·being deliberated today and tomorrow by students from 31 colleges through- out the Middle Atlantic States are: equable distribution of the wo1•lds raw materials, and means of pro- viding technical assistance to un· developed countries. The Union delegation, represent- ing Rumania, consists of John Hall and Casimer Rusczkowski, on the committee on economic sanc- tions; Richard Snyder and Carle- ton Ganison, committee on raw materials; and Van Trumbull and John Wold. technical assistance. William Leonard and Averill \!tewart will attend the sessions as unofficial observers, and Dr. How- ard M. Smyth is faculty advisor of the delegation. The Union men left yesterday afternoon by automobile, and will return from Poughkeepsie tomor- row night. The Model Assembly was opened officially at a meeting of all the 240 delegates held in the Vassar College Students' Building last night, when Prof. Charles G. Fenwick, of Bryn Mawr, spolte. But the real work of the conven- tion began this morning with the first Plenary Ses,;ion of the Assem- bly. This session was devoted to reports and elections necessary to launch the committee work, and to the official adoption of the agenda.

Nat Holman, who will be the speaker at Union's ninth annual · Eloci< \L'\ dinner, would be among the roll of Union alumni and a classmate of Hal Wittner, had he bad the funds with which to go to college, it was learned yesterday. The Union director of athletics is The Club held a meeting last Thursda:> night, at which time the committees were announced. The dance committee consists of: Charles Da:ly, '38, chairman; Larry Hennessey '38; Nelson Foot '36; Lee Theisen '37. The floor committee consists of: William Parsons '36; Theodore Wilmont '36; Lee Daven- port '37; Bradley Plummer '36. The chapemns will be: Dr. and Mrs. Frede1ick C. Schmidt, Dr. and Mrs. Howard Smyth, and Dr. and Mrs. Philip Stanley. The Pyramid Club is the· only neutral social organization at Un- ion. While the fraternity men are fortunate in their social opportun- ities, the neutrals are somewhat lacking in this 1 espect, and it is the Py!'amid Club's aim to remedy this situation. The neutral dance, sponsored by the Pyramid Club for the past few years, is one· event designed to help the neutrals' so- cial program. But this is the first year that the dance has gone un· der the club name. The membership of the Pyramid Club has increased marl<edly in the past year. RecentlY eight new members weze initiated. They we1e. Lee Davenpoi't '37, Frank Nolte '39, Harold Howe '36, Vilmar Bose '3<l, Charles Stinard '36, Hemy Seider '38, Woodrow Wilson '38, and Lee Th.eisen '37. The club be- lieves that its social progzam will be greatly enhanced by the in- creased membership. Tickets for the dance may be ob· tained from any member of the Pyramid Club or from the News Bureau. particularly happy over the choice of speaker this year not only be- cause he played with Holman while in high school, but because, he says, Holman typifies the finest type of gentleman-athlete, and especially because Holman is credited with being chiefly t esponsible for the development of the game of basket- ball as it is played today. He is mted as one of the greatest playez·s of all time and his C. C. N. Y. teams IIa. ve consistently been among the best quintets. It was while glowing with the ex- ploits of Holman that Hal Wittner told how he and Holman had de- cided to attend Union College.

Captlllin Hovey of the visiting mechanics outscored the Union men for high sum of the night, sinking six from the field and one free toss•. Beginning Is Close At the start of the hard fought game, it looked as if once again we were to see a reversal of form on the part of the Troymen. After seven minutes, however, they gave way before the Garnet and never headed them. Union scored first ·on one of the best executed plays of the evening. ·Soz Waldron after a fast ·brea:k, got a long heave away to Podbielski, which the latter flipped in with one of his now famous left-handed tosses. Center Smith tallied immediately after- ward on a .play from the tap. The game tightened up and see- sawed back and forth with first one tea,m maintaining a point lead and then the other. Two free tosses .put the visitors in the fore, 11 to 8, but Milano sank two long ones to place Union in front 12 to 11, which lead was never afterward overcome tby the fighting Trojans.

The home team then ·began to settle down to serious scoring and ran up a 26 to 13 score with four minutes of the half left to play, At this point Coach Nels Nitchman put his all-senior five on the hard wood court. With this combina- tion the score continued to mount up until a 33 to 17 lead had been obtained at half time. The senior five staged some of the best floor- work seen this year and the pass- ing of Milano and Waldron was beyond reproac·h. Bill Brandow got a .big hand by running rings around his tall opponent and out- witted him on spin shots on two occasions.

Eleven varsity batterymen, led by co-captains Stevenson and Griswold, and seven frosh .prospects have started work, with the outfield and infield men due to begin tossing the ball around on Friday afternoon. Five lettermen, who seem likely to comprise the .battery and every infield post except shortstop, are returning from last year's nine. Stevenson is slated to assume back- stop duties, with Ladd leading Denton and Schrade for the relief .position. Griswold will probably be number one on the tossing staff, although there seems to be plenty of material in LaJDJ'beth, Greulioit, Pearse, Ward, Warner, and Waters. Waters and Greulich, who toiled for the freshmen last year, seem to ·l>e most .promising to relieve Gris- wold, althoug.h the others have shown ability and it is too early to make any ·decisions. Ernie Brown at first, Mike Fiore at second and Dave Cadwallader at third, all lettermen, seem to be fixtures in the infiled, with the shortstop post yet to be fllled. Tom Palmatier and Phil Duchscherer will probably fight. it out for this key position. Two outfielders will ·be needed to take the places of Semerad and Loomis, and Hatfield will have Marotta, Greulich, Waters and Ladd to choose from, A stiff, ten-game schedule faces the Dutchmen, with Rochester • lHE NEW DENTISTRY One of the high lights of the contest came when Phil Duch-. scheret' took a fast pass from Pod-· bielski right after the tap and rung the bell with a tricky one-handed toss for his first score of the year. A mad house game began with the ball passing from one team to the other and with both fives exhaust- ed from running back and forth the length of the court. One min- ute to play and the seniors came back to end the game. R. P. I. sc01·ed a basket and it looked as if the Garnet graduates-to-be would be outscox·ed in those remaining seconds. Guy Griswold, however, had two foul shots awarded him with but two seconds to go and successfully made them both, end- ing the game, the basketball ca- reers of five men, and the last contest of the season.

Two games with Syracuse will be played, one here and one away, as is also the case with the first opponent. The schedule follows: April 18, Roch- estel', away; 2, Middle·bury, here; 25, Stevens, away; 28, Syracuse, a way. May 8, Syracuse, here; 9, Trinity, away; 16, Hamilton, here; 23, Rochester, 'here; 30, Mass .. State, here; June 6, alumni, here. The frosh seem to have some talent on their hurling staff, a ·laclt of which was very noticeable last year, and the prospects for a good season look bright. Dolby Jones and ''Spanky\ Halpet-n are the two outstanding pitchers at this d:ate, although Vanderbilt, Fox and Murphy are likely to come along fast. Only two catchers have turned out, Yunich and Roickle, so it seems that there won't be much c·ompetltion in that department. A six .game schedule seems prob- able for the yearlings, who had to be satisfied with only a couple last year. The first encounter is with Green Mt. Junior College at Poultney, Vt. on April 26. Then follows Albany High at Albany on the 28th, Green Mt . .College here on May 9, and Albany High here on May 13.

Behind the mask of games and activities, meetings and clcdions, there is still a surprising amount of study going- on its quiet way. Students cotlle to col- lege to study and to learn, and for many, the outward forms of college life are of sec- ondary importance. You who have been named to occupy the position of honor at your gmduation exer:- cises are living proof of this fact. The college is proud of your achievements and is happy to offer you this final recogni- tion, the last .and highest which it can give. SOCIAL OPPORTUNITIE~ One of the· perennial proLlems at L'uion College has been the lack of social opportuni- tie·S for independent students. Fraternities have dominated the social life of the campus for the naturalt·eason that they have had the facilities for holding dances and other social functions. The independents have had none. M01~eover, social functions need a more or less unified group to sponsor and support them. The fraternities are admirably organ- ized to carry on .social activities. There is First aml most important is the building of Hale House ana the refu:mishing of SilHman HalL The dining· room ill Hale House wiU be an excellent place to hold banquets and dances.

With. the co-operation of Mrs. Henry T. Moore, wife of the pt·esident of Skidmore Colleg~e, a series of tea dances are being held, alternately at Union and at Skidmore. The men invited include both fraternity members and independents. A ty:pical cross-section of the college, reg-ardl.ess of affiliation. Mrs. Fox has proved a charming a:nd generous hostess. He1· parties have been very successful, and their success shows ill some deg1~ee how much social affairs like this are needed. The Pyramid Club is .an organization of independent students with a long- and hon- orable histm-y. It has had a continuous existence longet· than serne of the fraternity chapter on the campus. Its aim is to broaden the .social opportunities of unaffili- ated students. Although it has been han- dicapped by the absence .of proper facilities, the clu.b has made the best of a hard job by holding occasional dances away from the campus. TommTO'W night the P'yeamid Club is danc- ing· at the Hotel Van Curler. It is its first dance of the year and pt·emises to be well at- tended. With good music, smooth floor, and pretty girls, what more eould one ask? We recommend it for that Saturday night date.

Mr. Honiltel claimed that this situation has resulted in part from the fact, since the \\'ar, vir- tually all agt·eements to keep the peace have also guaranteed a status quo in which some nations have, rightly or w10ngly, fe!.t they were at a per·manent political anu economic disadvantage whic·h en- dangered their very existence. PI·o- fessor Lm'rabee pointed out, how- ever, that all such imagined gric\'- ances are not necessanly just, es- pecially the impcl\ialh;tic ambitions of dictato1·s. Mr. Sn:,-der suggested that a <.'ei·- tain core of jutJt gdevances, how- ever, vastly aided the natiunalbtic dictators in coming to po\Vel' in the first place; anti that the \wealthy\ powers ought to tal1e steps to redress these just p·iev- ances. \The League of Nations,'\ he ::;tated \has been mistakenly re- gm·ded as primarily an agency fn1 keeping the map of Europe un- changed.

The economic interpretation of history, Dr. Fox said, may furnish an explanation for most of man's actions, but it is not applicable in every instance.

Doig Friday, March 20, 1936 THE LOW-DOWN ON THE A. S. U. TILe imminent formati0n of a chapte1· of the American Student Union on the campus has been viewed with ~1larm from several llllmter.s, even befoTe the organization has begun to function. An Albany newspaper, one of a chain of papers which has always ti·ied to squelch any movement with the faintest whiff of a ting-e of libemlism, has published an a1·ticle saying that U11ion College was be- ing invaded by radicals. President Fox showed his customary tact and broadmindedness in a statement printed in the same mticle. He suspended judgment on the A S. U. itself fol\ Jack of evidence. But he affirmed the right of students to ex- press theil\ opinions, and said, in effect, that he would not clamp down on any one g-roup of ::;tudents just uecause he disagreed with them. The facts of the ease are these: The A. S. U. is composed of students all over the coun- try of all political creeds, who are united on certain non-political issues, the prevention of war, the achievement of economic secm·ity, freedom of speech and education, and equality of opportunity regardless of race differences. Hundreds of student groups and religious bodies have professed the same views. .But the American Student Union is or- ganized to do something- about their intellec- tual convictions. It is a pressure group, try- ing to achieve. its ends through education, legislative lobbies, and the swaying of public opinion. It uses the weapons of the reaction- ary forces, the vested interests, and th.e second-rate Napoleons it is trying to combat. As for the Union students who are organ- izing a chapter, they were members in spirit three weeks ago when they went to Albany to make a spirited protest against the Nunan Bill. And we believe they were inspired more by the Skidmore delegation which attended the A. S. U. conference at Hamilton Colleg·e, than they were by the representatives of the national committee. soft mud underfoot. Down in Jackson's gat•- Dr. Fox- -<standing on one foot).

MAN OF INTEGIRITY At the Block \U\ dinner l\tlonday night, P1·ofes::->m· J. Harold Wittner made a f'tate- ment w·hich deserves to he repeated in black and white and preserved in the college rec- ords: \This strikes me as being a particularly fitting ucca::;ion,\ said Mr. Wittner, \to ex- l}ress publicly appt·eciation to one of our offi- cial family who is severing his connections with Union at the end of the college yeal'. \His devotion to his duties and his co- openttion with the policies of the college have been exemplary, and so I say to Elliott Hat- field, that I sincerely hope that his future ef- forts, no matter in what field of endeavor, meet with the fullest measure of success of which he is so richly deserving.\ With this sentiment The Concordiensis is in hearty accord. We value Mr. Hatfield as a friend, aud admire him as a man of auility and integrity. He has made many enemies, but that is natural in his position. A coach without enemies would have to have the tact of a diplomat and the shrewdness of a poli- tician, as \vel! as the ability of a coach. lllr. Hatfield has always refused to over- emphasize ::;ports. In ::;pite of his position he has maintained a sane perspective toward himself and his work. A football game was a game, and never a battle of the century. The hysterical, do-or-die attitude was dis- tasteful to him. We admire this intellectual honesty. We feel that a. great many of the student body, und all of those who knew him well, will be 80l'l\Y to see him leave Union this summer, und will l'emem!Jel· him with respect. COOPERATION The Lusiness staff has struggled along· for quite some time, getting ads that help to make possible each issue of the Concordi- ensis. l\lany tedious hours spent in dummy- ing the ads avail the business manager naug·ht unless the readers, in this case pri- marily students, will patronize those mer- paper. · tice.

This is the second meet of the year with the Red Raiders, the Garnet winning the first en- counter by the close score of 9-8. Colgate has had more e:xperience than the Dutchmen and a hard- fought match is anticipated. H0w- ever, last week's meets with Nor- wich and Hamilton have condi- tioned the von Forstmeyer charges and they are set to end their schedule with a victory. .At Satur- day's meet the head judge will be Mr. Whenig of Wisconsin. Fifth Meet The meet with the Western New Yorker·s is the fifth meet of a most successful season, the record to date showing three wins against one loss. The schedule has been a difficult one, the Garnet having de- feated by slim margins teams that have encountered colleges where fencing is a reeognized sport and where much time is spent perfect- ing the ancient art. This record brings to the fore the question of fencing being made a minor sport, the answer to which query seems to merit much consideration. Since the arrival of Mr. von Forstmeyer an active interest has been taken in the spm:t which he has fostered. Two years ago the Union swords- men entered intercollegiate compe- tition and since then have acquit- ted themselves and their college nobly. Both Mr. von Forstmeyer and the members of the squad have worked hard and credit should be especially extended to the coach who has generously given his time and efforts.

Other potential players re- porting ·to Ceach Stanley were Wil- son, Gordon, Wiberley, Waldron, Truex, Field and Clark. In view of such an abundance of material, the Union swingers should be every bit as strong if not stronger than they were last season when they gar'Ilered five out of seven meets. Of the men returning from last year, Thatcher, Froelich and Little are rated highest, although as far as handicap goes, none can be rated much above the other.

For hundreds of years, tobaccos were selected- and grada· tions in :flavor secured-by the roughest sort o-f rule of thumb methods. Hence, one of tile most important innovations made by tile Research Department was provision fCJr chemical analysis of selected tobacco s~unples before purchase: the resulting re- ports offer the professional buyer an accu· rate guide and reinforce his e:xpert judg. ment based on the senses of sight, smell, and touch.

Hi::; letter follows: \I wish there was a way for you to convey to the boys who attended the Block U dinner thrill I enjo~·ed in getting that telegram of greetings. It made me feel close to the crowd, and the message was greatly app!c- ciated.\ Block U Dinners, accepted as an institution of long-standing tradition by the undergraduate of today, are in reality a com- paratively recent innovation.

Senator J\.Iac:.JaLoe is one of the leaders of the senate who has actively suppot·ted the loyalty oath bill for teachers and students. Dr. Fox and the faculty have publicly urged the repeal of the first of these measures, the Ives Law; and the student loyalty oath bill was opposed by a large numbee of the stu- dent body. That Senator .i\IacNaboe has been invited to speak here in spite of this opposition to sorne of his vie\vs indicates Dr. Fox's belief in the open-mindedness of the student body. We believe that his sul'mise 1s correct. The student body will listen with respect to a man who holds opinions contt·ary to theit· own. We can learn from oue opponents. And we may be pe!'suaded to change our minds. Who knows? METAMORPHOSIS Inquisitive students who from time to time during the last four months have wandered down past the Old Chapel, ducked under the scaffolding, stepped over the lwick piles and picked their way through the assorted de- bris to watch the workmen chang-e South Colonnade into Hale House, have become aware of a mon\entous fact: the work is nearly completed. No longer is the walk blocked by ladders and trucks and piles of lumber. The debrLs is being cleared away. The idly curious are not permitted to go inside any more to watch the wo1·krnen. Trucks have been bringing bun- dles of curtains, crated furniture, and rugs. Sleepy old South Colonnade!

Made by Cosmo- politan, the Hearst unit of Warner Brothers, the film was not expected to be a box-office success becau£e it lacked what is loosely termed appeal. But large audienees at the State theater were typical of thE' reception it is getting thr:>ughout the country. Why is thit> pi<J·~urc, which has been Given shamefully little publicity, being so well-liked? Biographical movies ar•J, in .the first place, likely to be barily writ- ten. There is so much materbi in the course of any man's life, that to edit this mass, make it dramatic, coherent, and yet signi'icant of what the man stood for, or had ac- complished, is a tremendous task, calling for high skill and artistry, such as is beyond most scoenario hacks. The choir seems to be taken for granted. We seldom pay attention to it as something other than part of the service. Earlier in the year, this space was devoted to some ob- servations on music and r·eligion, and it is unnecessary to repeat. There remains the quartet. Slowly and unobtrusively they rehearse. When they do appear in chapel in the future it must be remembered that they are amateurs devoting their leisure to the study of difficult music. From that point alone it will be seen that they are doing a valuable piece of work. But the main thing to remember in connection with each of these organizations is that they love the work they do. What more can be asked of them. \The Life of Louis Pasteur\ scores its first factor for success by being written in just sucn a man- ner. It is illuminating to ell. unine the method. The problem of ReJec- tion is met by emphasil!;in!; thre•~ phases of Pasteur's life and work. that includes Laughton. :Muni's Taken in natural chronology they Pasteur is not a job of ading, it are: his occupation with child-bed is Pasteur.

In 1920 these two teams stacked up against each other and went at it in real old fashioned style. At the end of the 26th inning the umpire decided that it was far too dark for two teams to be playing base- ball and so called the game with the score knotted at one all. Brook- lyn made nine safe blows while Boston collected a total of 15 hits. One remarkable feature of the :game was that whereas two catch- ers were used by both teams, the starting pitchers were in there throwing their arms out at the gong. The playing time--the long- est on record-was three hours and ~minutes. When we get up into the home- run competition we naturally find George H. Ruth at the peak. For 11 years the \Babe\ socked the old ---0·--- Weeks Best Editorial apple\ over da cathedral\ with at 'least forty homers each year.

In answer to this statement, Mrs. Popltin points out that the activities of youth, direct· ed at the creation of a world with less slums, less unemploytnen t, more equal distribution of the comforts of life, more sch<Jols, greater economic security, are di- rected at the very roots of crime, Furthermore, participation by youth in such activities is evidence of an aroused social consciousness, which is the anithesis of crime. 193'7 Explaining that the curse ·Of our own time is public indifference to such problems as those with which students and other young people concern themselves, Mrs. P()pkin states that the interest of youth in them is something very much worth cultivation. Such activity is natural for the younger genera- tion, just as -anti-war and woman suffrage movements of two- de· cades back proved to be ·natural and of great value. To fail t() rec· ognize youth expression is just as foolhardy as to take it too seri- ously. Youth feels that it cannot wait until later in life to :ma.lte itself heard. It feels that certain problems must be met immediately and that later may be too late. Perhaps that viewpoint Ia of great- er value than many of us suspect. -Colsa.te :Mal'oon. ,S. R. Cohen, R.

IN THE MAIL To the Editor: It seems that with an attempt go- ing on on the campus to form a chapter of· the American Stu~ent Union at Union, students who mtght be induced to j<>in the organization should consider all phases of the so.ciety-the nature of its leader- ship. and its possible effect on the c()Jiege. After a. determined effort to obtain information on the inner · \soul\ of the A. S. U., we have dis- covered that information on the society is extremely scarce, that it's existence, (since last Christmas time), is too short to give it a defin- ite .reputation; and worst of all, that members of the organization here know little about the society outside of the stated t>latform. Started as a merger-reorganization of the Student League for Indus- trial Democracy an out-and-out radical organization, and the ~a­ tiona! Student League, a sociahst organization of long standing, the Union ha.s acquired as its leaders many of the same leaders and l>ractically the same objectives of the old organizations.

Among the pitch.,rs of yet;- terday's game, Coach Lawrence turned in the best performance, although Halpern, Way, and Stew- al't showed fine control and seem destined to bear the brunt of the tossing burden. Jone:>, :somewhat at a loss ye.sterday as to just where tll.e plate lay, may a;,;sume an outfield position, for his two hits proved his ability in that line. <:omenzo and Miller al::;o hit fm· two safeties apiece while Myers and Lubansky garnered one each to account for the yearling's eight blows. Contwy at flr.st, Myers at second, Lubansky at shott, and Comenzo or Amazon at third, look like the best infield combination, and Yunlch has the backstopping ~ituation well in hand. The out· field consists at the present of Jones, Thomas, and Miller, al- though there may be changes in that department. With a little coaching by the able Mr. Lawrence, who by the way, popped up in his chance at the plate B,gainst Guy Griswold, the team should come along and do at least as well as the unfortunate outfit of last yea1·. Games to Continue Practice will continue outdoors from now on, with several practice games between the vp.rsity and frosh scheduled fot• each week. Until the soggy pa1·t of the field clears up, all playing will be car- ried on at the south end, which, although somewhat rough for a diamond, nevertheless is the best available space for the candidates. The varsity will come back early from Spring vacation to get in good condition for . the opening game three weeks from tomorrow at Rochester. The cubs will not start their season until a week later when they engage the Green Mt. Junior College at Poultney, Vt., .so will have plenty of time to develop. All in all, about forty play&s took part in Thursday's game, in· eluding Art Lawrence in the 1•ole of pitcher and Mr. Hatfield in the umpire's box. About 12 innings were played altogether, and dark- ness was the cause for finally stop- ping play. The sun and unsecure footing make it rathet· treacherous to retrieve fly balls in the outfield, and Billy Thomas and Joe Marotta put on a short comedy skit when- ever they went aftet· one. Besides the times already men· tioned Himt has a marlt of 24.1 in the 200 meters, closely followed by Bill Endicott, Jerry Neumann. Jack Ross, Leon Saiewitz, and Vi Fryer. In the 400 mete1·s run Ross is leading the field in 54.8, with Wally Hughes and Warren Gam- mons close on his heels for honors. The 400 meter run is approximately 8 feet shorter than the usual 440 yard run. Ross again came through in the . 880 yard r·un with Ed Bastedo, Gammons and Neumann within three seconds of Ross' 2:07 2. Bas- tedo i,; continuing his previous good mile and two mlle running and recently did the shorter dis- tance in 4:49.5. His mnning mate, Neumann has a 4:57 mark for the rest to shoot at. Ross, Bob North and Hany Myers are in the five minute class to date with the !irst named having an edge on his two rivals.

Em hrus reach- ed 12' 3\ in the pole vault while Nag has put the shot out 41' 10\ and hurled the disou!l 134 .feet.

U., meeting in Silliman Hall yesterday at 3:30 decided to carry on an in- vestigation into all sources to ob- tain information on the cloudy or uncertain aspectc; of the American Student Union and other national ::Jtudent organizations as well. Contrasting the dirth of definite facts about the American Student Union with the openness of infor- mation from similar society, the National Student Federation, Pres- ton Reed brought before the group the •basis for doubt concerning the background and inner nature of the union. It was decided, as a re- sult of discussion, to request and assemble facts about the society, from all kinds of sources. Van Trumbull, chairman of the A. S. U., stated that the union would continue its activities with- out seeking to defend itself until adequate information has been col- lected. At a previous meeting Thursday afternoon, the Union chapter of the American Student Union held its second meeting at which defin- ite organization got under way. Van Vechten Trumbull and Leslie PaJfrath, the temporary chairman and secretary respectively, were voted unanimously by the fifteen members present to continue their positions.

Anony- mous D~nor feted the students and friends of the college at a dinner, announcing the open- ino- of Hale !louse. In the white, wainscoted w:lls of the dining hall the guests feasted on a sumptuous meal which betrayed the same tasteful touch of the anonymous donor. Nothing was lacking· as course after course wus served on the polished mahogany tables. Even the monogramed match packets, to be found at every tum, displclyed the fine taste of the master designer. After Dr. Fox's v,·ell chosen words in thanks to i\Ir. Anonymous Donor, the guests thronged to the student and faculty lounges, marvelling at the opulence of harmonious colors and at the luxuriant furnishings. Throughout the new commons nothing has been spared. The latest books can be picked up from the bookcases and a, remarkable set of Spy prints grace the green papered walls of the faculty room. l\Iany antique pieces which decorate the seve1·ul rooms and halls are studies of art in themselves, while the whole is a masterpiece of eighteenth century English architecture, refined by American ::;implicit_y·, worthy only of its eminent cre- atm·. There was considerable speculation as to how long the :::;tudents could refrain from vandalizing and destroying the priceless fur- nishings. Time will only tell. But we sin- cerely believe that all Union men will conduct therm;elves properly in action, word and ap- pearance while in the confines of the Hale House. From the day it opens, April 13, until the cullegc remains nu more, we will pay homagt:' to :\lr. Anonylllous Dunur by the proper and respectful use of his munificent gift.

However insofar as the revision is still ex- perimental the administration will be able to smooth out these paradoxes.

For the former the course has been raised to a. cultural level to provide them with a rounded education. This step is com- parable to that taken sometime ago in Phy- 8ics 2. The student in the social .sciences has not in many eases the technical inclinations which these highly scientific courses de- mand. Fu1thermore his academic studies re- quire extensive reading, prohibiting the long hom~s which must ordinarily be spent in lab- oratory work. In eliminating the highly spe- cialized and technical parts of Biology, the administration has arranged the course so that the stud.ents in the divisions of Social Studies and Language and Literature will discuss the biological theories which may throw lig·ht on social problems. RlTPP()RT YOUR TEAMS Every sunny afternoon g-reat throngs of persons can be seen around Alexander Field or the Library Field, attentively watching the teams e11gaged in practice. Thus far the athletes have performed credibly and should carry themselves off with honor in the en- suing spring season. That the teams should arouse such early interest, we hope, i8 an indication that dur- ing- the playing season they will receive the same spirited support. The :players derive satisfaction in performing· bef(}l'e enthusiaS'- tic crowds and it is theii· just dessert, for the arduous hours of training, that their .pleasures be satisfied. If the attendance at games is g-ood, rest assu1·ed that the results will be proportionately g'()Od. A reviewer, tresh from having eeen a picture, has to write a piece of determinate length in which he reports back. to his readers just what his reactions to that picture are. Naturally, they also want to know what th.e pictUre is about. But then, nothing would be so bor- ing as to have to read a p1•ecis of the plot accompanied by the bald statement, \It was good,\ or, \It was bad.\ And so the reviewer tries to let you see why he feels the way he does about the film. To accom- plish that, one is forced to take apart his felings and by a feat of rationalysis <to coin a word) put upon paper in a more or less con- nected sequence whatever is the result. And yet with this realization, the reviewer cannot say that he wao not amused. He was for the mo- ment. The hang-over effect was one of having been fed to satiety <Jnly. to find that the feeling came fl\om · a gaseous bloating. Child ActJ·esses Schenectady has mercifully been spared of late the peregrinations of that extraordinary child, Shirley Temple, The basis of this column's objections to her lies in the tawdry sentimentalities which are visited upon her in the guise of stories. Nothing will be done about it, .for she is earning too much as she is, and the public awarded her the dis- tinction of most popular actress of 1935. The reason for this minor digres~ sion above is the current Proctor's film, \Wife Versus Secretary.\ That completely unsubtle title tells you practically the whole story, and the first reaction of the beholder is, why was the picture made at all; that same thing has been done so often. Well, we can get around that one by calling it a variation on a Other children brighten the hori- theme, and on the principle that it zon, however.

There are the elements. Loy is a past adept at being the female fac- tor in conjugal bliss, Gable busies himself at being a completely like· able fellow, ancl Harlow is sex, no matter how much understated. Mr. Gable never for an instant ceases loving his wife, Miss Loy never ceases loving her husband. Miss Harlow, we sus]Ject, loves her boss but nobly conceals it. What is the result? Metw-Goldwyn-Mayer expends much money, everyone acts to the top of his .bent, and the audience llkes it. ... So on an entertainment basis the film rates high. It will make much money at the box-office. Audiences will be momentarily impressed. And the whole thing will be forgotten within a few weeks. In a final estimate we must con- clude that het·e is an example, an excellent one, of the abliity of the motion picture industry, to manu· facture a sleek, well ordered, piece of goods from nothing at all.

Society has -been made throug-h the countles::J sacrifices of numer- ous n1en and women, explained Dl'. McCrea. It has been through the unselfishness af mothers who have guided erring footsteps and at the cost of time and effort of those outside the immediate ken of a per- son that \self-made\ can become a possibility. The sacrifice of a flask of water brought to King David from Beth· lehem by three men at the risk of their lives a\ a symbol of gratitude was chosen by Dr. Cavert as the text for his sermon. Two attitudes in life, he said. were shown by the recognition by Davis of the great chance his men took just to carry out an almost childish desire when the enemy was a-lmost upon them. It shGws on one hand how one may take as a mat- ter of cou1·se all the things which he has but which have been made possible only through the gt·eatest sacrifice::J; and in the other, how even the simple~! comforts a1•e brought to one only by the g1·eatpst diffic-ulty. --- -o--- Outing Club I.ecture Arthur Shorey of the State Con- servation Department will speak tomol'row evening to the Outing Club at 8:00 p. m. in the Geology Laboratory.
