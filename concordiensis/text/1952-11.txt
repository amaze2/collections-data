Page_Six Friday, November 7, 1952 Kalikuke's Have a Fine Old History at Union NYC Cops Pinch E. Nott· Recent Investigations by the So- ciology Department of. Union Col- lege have revealed that Persus Plo- toe!pkin Kalikuke, a member of the class of '53, is the heir to an· amazing family tradition. Sir.ce revolutionary days, Kalikulte men have been Union men, and their women have been very happy about this, the report says. P. P., as he is called by his friends, is unawed by this aristocratic tradition, how- ever, ;tnd he remair.s a moronic, lascivious, untruthful, lazy, unre- generate, louse. The earliest Kalikuke, of whom we have any record, was \Ole Charlie\ . Kalikuke, .an . ox-dt·o\·er during the war of Independence. His patriotism and courage are at- tested to by the many legends which still circulate through the north woods about \that jerk Kali- lmke.\ One famous incident, which the farmers hold in particular esteem, occured during during the Batie of Freeman's Farm (Skid- more) . when · . one . of . the . oxen hitched to a twelve-pounder died. With selfish devotion, \Ole Charlie\ · asked to be hitched in its place and managed to get the gun lost In a swamp due to his inability to understand the drover's commands. In spite of this, h~> lilted thE> job. and remained \in harness\ until the end of the war. •'Ole Charlie\ Kalilwke at an unspecified occupation in New York City. Thus P.P. stands in a famous line. We are proud to have him at Union, and we hope that he may become the first of his famous family to receive a degree. His marks are good. In questior.ing Prof B- about this, he attri- buted P.P.'s success to the fact that, \I'm afraid of the little son of a b-h.'' And like old Batch Ka!ikuke, we wish P.P. well. We hope, in the old tradition, that his sons will \go to Union\ as their fathers did, ther~>by maintaining Union College as 11 school. like the I bathroom, where \The Family Goes.\ Not seemed to ·be undisturbed about his plight. He was over- heard to muter \There's not a Judge in New York City that money can't buy. We are proud to announc-e the Grand Opening of the FRANCE SNACK BAR on Monday •.

M. ~--------------------------------------~ There is some discussion as to who the female progenitor of the line was; some say it was a Cretin Indian Squaw named Mushmush, while other maintain it was a big white ox named Babe. Be this as it may, it must be admitted the mistake occured and that it has been occuring with amazing fre- quency ever since. \Ole Charlie\ finally passed away in 1829, fit- tingly enough, in a position of great historical emin·ence, being the first man to die in New York State's new Hospital for the Crim- inally Insane. ~lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll~ = ::.=.:: ~- , The next Kalikuke in this great line was \Ole Charlie's\ son, Jude, who entered Union College on Sep- tember 9, 1807 under the spor.sor- ship of a Balley Scholarship. He was forcibly removed from the Col- lege grounds on Oct. 29th, 1807, by the Sheriff of Schenectady, and was bung on Nov. 7th. In spite of this he managed to do his part in carrying on the family line, even while an \ur.dergraduate at Un:ion. The detailed family history of the HalikultPs became obscure after Jude, but we do have some broad outlines available from the soci- ology department. During the in- tervening years it is estimated that although it has cost the govern- ment of New Y orlt State over eight million dollars to support· the male members of the Kalikuke family, that the females have been prac- tically self sufficient. In this re- spect, it is t>stimated that 643 of these girls were petty thieves, 78 were embezzlers, 113 w~>re jack- rollers, and 1,692 were-a.h, had no visible means of support. In spite of this rather gloomy record, it has been recently ascer- tained that some of the girls have achieved success in this generation.

Adding to this ·elixir of eliteness we have one each from Bryn Mawr and Wellesley. Kappa Nu, with its legion of members, garnered the mest dates, 39. They also tied with Phi Sigma Delta as the house having the most Skidmore dates. They each have 8. The effects of the deferred rushing program can be seen in the frosh response. Their dates, included with, and inseparable from, upperclass independents, cannot num- ber over 25, since there are only 31 independent dates listed. The young women who will grace this campus. this weekend come from varied and sometimes distant places. One fair damsel from Nassau, the British West Indies, seems to cap the duke as a prom traveler.

LOve in Bloom Late in 1942, Adolf Hitler, fore- seeing the overthrow of the Third Reich plus his subsequent mar- riage with Eva Braun, began draft- ing plans for an elopement and South American honeymoon with his propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels. Hermann Goering, jilted by Goebbels ar:d seething with un- reasoning jealousy, plotted Hitler's death by bombing. This attempt, as our readers know, failed. Meanwhile, Adolf and Joseph, thrilled by the prospect of many more years together, arranged with Juan and Eva Peron to take them in for a few yea-rs. The Perons agreed, and Joseph immediately began drafting plans for the sub- marine which would speed them to sunny Argentina. Imagine thl! horror! These world d~spots, hands bloodied with blood, were going to frolic in the sun together, while many American sweethearts were being kept apart. (For this story, see I WAS A MALE WAR- BRIDE). But that is not all. Here in the United States, Harry S. Truman, foreseeing his term of office as president, and wanting to get away from Bess and Margaret (who had just disgraced herself with that Durante fell<>w), beran drafting plans for escape. Hear- ing that Hitler and Goebbels were also vacationing in South America, he decided to join them, for he had heard that they were person- able fellow, as long as one took care not to mention politics. The Lockheed people quickly made up. a copy of his .personal plane, and Harry took off to join his hosts, leaving his twin brother, a nation- ally-kr.own shirt manfacturer, to double for him. No one was the wiser. Adolph, Joe Go to RPI Our operatives, two of whom wete killed by cobras on this as- signment, lost track of the deadly three until late last month. It is now known definitely that they are alive and in this country! These men, who were swallowed up by the South American jur gles, have come back from an eight year ex- ile. What were they doing in those eight years? What evil plans were they hatching? And why are they !n this country now? We are go- mg to answer those startling ques- tings now! It has been discovered that Tru- man was devoting six hours a day during his exile to practicing his piano playing. Hitler was taking voice lessons, and Goebbels was polishing up old tap routines. So todav, now, you can see this sen- sational team, on tour this month at advanre prices. Harry, Joe, and Dolph will play the RPI field house with their South-American rhythms and native German ·humor next Tuesday. Don't miss them! They're sensational! • MODERN TRIANGLE A 80 y . ..

Last Saturday the Garnet gridders easily topped Haverford, 25-6. ------\?>, Hamilton enters tomorrow's game C Ch t I wit!:). a 3-2-1 record. They opened amp · US . es their season with wins over B:ook- lyn and Wagner, before droppmg a F d G I squeaker to Swa · rthmore. They · un· oa then beat Haverford and tied Ho- . bart. Last weekend they were I $3 0 00 trounced by Rochester 33-6. On S comparati\'C scores the gam<> should ' to be a tossup. Although Union's The Campus Chest today announced that it will spon- · sor a drive starting l\Ion- day in an attempt to raise money for seven national and international organizations. The September collection was delayed this year in order to give the students more time to study the proposed plan. It has been decided by the fund con:mittee, headed by Richard Hoffman, that the money collected I am pleased to learn that the Campus Chest Committee has decided to campaign for funds during the latter half of No- vember, for Thanksgiving, with all it implies, should suggest why students should have their own fund through which to sup- port the important charitable enterprises Of our day. The habit of thoughtful giving-estab- lished in college might well be more important to future careers than any course in the curriculwn. Dr. Carter Davidson loss to Rochester was by only 27- 14, the Continentals, tied Hobart who beat us 13-6 and ripped Haver- ford by about the sam<> margin as the Dutchmen. Gumerloek Is Back · Leading the Hamilton squad, which runs out of the \T'' forma- tion, are quarterback and passer Ron Seaman and Captain Dick Gumerlock, a 160 pound scatback, w.ho has carried the brunt of the Hamilton offense in the last two games between the schools. The Continentals play a wide open · brand of football replete with pitchouts, wide sweeps and an em- phasis on passing. The Jones coached club also sports a heavy aggressive line and on the whole uses a two-platoon system. Last year's game was a thriller · which saw Union score three touch- downs in the first eight minutes of the third period to wipe out an early 20-0 Hamilton lead. The Con- tinentals, however, fought back and their 32-20 win spoiled a Union prom weekend. The year before also saw a fine game with Union coming on to win in the last few minutes. Tomorrow's encounter figures to be fully as exciting as these last two meetings. This, and other evidence gives credence to the daim that WRUC was tlie first regularly. scheduled broadcasting station in the United States and possibly in the entire world. · The information garnered from the Union College arc:ttives conclusively proving this pQint has been released to the press. ;No other radio station has as yet challeng!')d the claim. advertising income of a publication · There are to be a minimum of two to be distributed among the Senior h . alf hour. chapels a week; On!; this year will be distributed almost J3oard.

Chapel Disinterred Letters to the· Editor Claims Union College Needs a \Renaissance\ To the Editor of Concordiensis: After making an abortive at- tempt at studying for a test in our own college libt·ary, I came to the realization that Union College of- fers very little to the student body in the way of adequate facilities for study, and, as a matter of fact, adequate facilities for anything. The drive is heavily endorsed by the· Student Council and the mem\ bers have pledged their support and .cooperation. I hope this will serve to impress upon students the need to examine the drive and its significance on the Union campus. We of the Student Council hope that every student will contribute. Une need only to take a look at the drab appearance of the build- mgs, stt in the classrooms, stroll tht·ough the library, or go into the gymnasium, just to mention a few. Certainly, a school with the aca- demic reputation which Union pos- sesses, and the financial position it enjoys warrants a better consider- ation be given the student body. One sometimes wonders if the col- lege program exists for the benefit of the students oi• the greater glori- fication of the college name, and added publicity for certain mem- bers of the board of trustees. John Moses Student Council President \VRUC Manager Thanks Concordy for Publicity To the Editor of Concordlensis: I should like to take this oppor- tunity to extend to you our sincere gratitude for your assistance in the promotion of our Thirty-second An- niversary.

Through your brilliant· campaign y o u . have returned ~orne semblance · of dignity to Arn- e ric an politics.· You c-ertainly did talk sense to the American people and their sion was not, am sure, a diation of you, Senator· • McCar- thy notwithstanding. You were up against a popular and attractive national hero who waged almost as brilliant a campaign as you did. Factors were at work-factors big- ger than either you or General Eisenhower. Your speeches and comments wiU form part of American poli- tical literature, much as the speeches of Henry \lVallace and Wendell Willkie have. You reo eeived the votes of twenty-six mil· lion people, more than any de· feated candidate in# history and more than most elected candidates. You were more brilliant and you again. If you made any spea;k- ing tours through the eastern par.t of the country during 1953 and I were not in Korea or some other distant corner of the world, you could count on one ardent 1istei1er and many others I am sure. There are many, I among them, who do not agl'ee with every one of your views on specific issues; In gen- eral, though, Jet me repeat my tre- mendous respect for you as a sincere and brilliant man. Very sincerely yours, Eliot Loshalt P.S.-In line with my suggestion about a speaking trip through the eastern United States, I can think of no one whom I would rather hear speak at the Union College Commencement Exercises this June than you. It would be tre- mendous publicity .for the school'- sorely needed publicity I might add, and a great learning experi- ence for us who must sit through Graduation. ~-~o~-- Octavo Singers to Appear on Campus The Octavo Singers, a mixed choral group of 85, will present a program of three serious works to- night in Memorial Chapel. The Schenectady group will be under the direction of Mr. Gordon Mason. The Student Council this week gave its stamp of ap- proval to a recommendation which, i~ adopte?, would see radical change in both the chapel pomt reqmrements and the daily chapel system in its entirety. In suggesting this change to the Committee on Student Affairs and Relations, the sse claimed to be motivated by two factors: (1) student discontent with the number of chapel points they have to accumulate, and (2) the poor quality of some of the chapel programs. I think it is about time the col- lege took stock of what it offers the student body and the affect upon student morale. Perhaps what Union needs is a renaissance of her . own, an enlightened atti- tude, Avrom Gold '54 SC Lends Support to Campus Chest Campaign Last year, we sent letters to your Student Council president asking him for your school's support in our attempt to save Champlain College. Now that this· idea is im- possible, we arc campaigning for the relocation of Champlain College. Again, we'd like to call upon your school for aid, but in a different manner. On the week- end of November twenty-first, twenty-second, and twenty-third, our College is presenting \The Champlain Mysteria\ weekend featuring The Crystal Ball on Sat- urday night November 22, 1952. The Crystal Ball stars Charlie Spivak and his orchestra. The price is $5.50 for the dance and weekend. Other activities scheduled will- be a bon-fire rally on Friday night followed by a Monte Carlo night. On Saturday we plan to have the following: a float parade, guest speakers to speak on the reloca- tion of our College, a barbecue, and then the semi-formal dance. On Sunday we are planning a musical concert followed by a tea dance. All of this for $5.50. gracious in concession of defeat than at any other time during the campaign. I agree with you--it ·does hurt too much to laugh and you are too old to cry. This, how- ever, is a time neither for laugh- ing nor for crying. It is a. time, rather, for a sober realization of the huge tacl{ facing our new president and the importance of your active cooperation with him. You not only represent the politi- cal ideas of millions of Americans but are the leader of the still very strong Democratic Party. Your voice must continue to be heard on the political scene. I enjoyed your wit and gift for language during the campaign and your Ho9per rating is, I am sure, very high. I would like to hear Included on the program will be Cherubini's Mass, \Te :Oeum\ _by Verdi, and \Song of Destiny\ by Brahms. Accompanying the group will be Duncan Gillespie at the organ with Jeanette Odasz on the piano. The Octavo Singers, who special- ize in the presentation. of .large oratorios have scheduled Handel's \Messiah\ for early next year. The group presents three programs a year. Student tickets are priced at $.60 and adult tickets $1.50. We question the sagacity of the Student Council's move for a variety of reasons. First of these is that John Moses, Student Council president, conducted an opinion \poll\ when there were less than 200 present. We were in attendance at that Chapel session and, caught off-guard by Mr. Moses, we replied to his query that we advocated a change in the chapel procedure. Given time to consider the problem, if it is a problem, we have decided that we were \Hong in back- ing a change. Why do we think it is folly to change? The answer to this is bound up almost entirely with student motivation. Assumincr that the student wants the daily chapel system improved~ let us consider why he does. Therein lies the raison d'etre for the chapel program. We fail to see that students do anything very constructive around here. (e.g. the apathetic situation which has every activity leading a hand-to-mouth existence). What the students probably want, but lack the courage to say, is that they don't want to go to chapel at all; as a matter of fact, the student doesn't want to do much of anything. The long and loud cry that the students are supposedly uttering about the quality of chapel programs is hardly founded in fact. In the first place, the requirements are selective enough-attendance at half of the weekly chapels is enough to guarantee the thirty points required each term. None of the chapel series have been all bad, the only group which has shown consistency along this line is the Student Council sponsored chapels on Mondays. For three weeks now, there have been no scheduled speakers at Monday Chapel programs. Last Monday, chapel was dismissed because the band reneged at the last minute. However, the two programs previous to that were not filled due to negligence only. All this makes the Student Council's stand seem rather hypocriticaL Certainly Jay Cohn, in charge of the Monday Chapels for the SC last year, managed to find a speaker or provide a program of some sort. If any of the assemblies have been \lousy\ they have been those of the Student Council. One should clean up in his own 'back yard before he starts to criticize his neighbor's. How pressing, on the other hand, is the question over the number of required chapels? For several years, the Concordiensis fought for a modification of the chapel system, receiving a smattering of success, (i.e. no eighth term points) but whatever this publication achieved it did so without much help from the student body. To the Editor of Concordiensis: November 17-22 is Campus Chest week here at Union. The idea be- hind Campus Chest is to save the students money and inconvenience by having one on-campus collection for important charities rather than having 15 or 20 organizations so- licit him. The idea behind asking the stu- dent support at this time instead of registration in September is that it is felt that more information could be given to the student at this time concerning the nature of the Campus Chest. I would like' to extend an open invitation to you and the student body of your College to attend our weekend and add to its success. Richard M.

If the Committee on Student Affairs and Relations was to ignore the SC proposal (to halve the number of chapel programs, lengthen their times and also cut the number of points required in half), we feel they would be right in doing so because with each addition the student receives to his freedom, he conespondingly increases his abuse to said freedom.

Further analysis points out to us that this attempt on the part of the SC to take the students' part is sheer folly. What the students seem to want is a complete withdrawal from any responsibility whatsoever. The only thing that the student will do voluntarily is something which will lead to a lessening of his responsibilities. The \we don't need chapel\ philosophy has spread to the activities. How long this escapist ideology will last, we can't tell. We certainly can't condone the Student Council's part in giving this withdrawal philosophy an impetus. The stu- dents themselves would do much better if they used some of this escapist energy in along more constructive lines. -J. J. c.

Letters to the Editor Labels Concordiensis The \Minority Leader\ To the Editor of Concordiensis: 1t seems as if the Concordiensis has become the minority leader on campus, fi·rst supporting Stevenson, and now the continuation of the present chapel system.· In last week's editorial, you covered the facts pretty well, but you failed to read between the lines. First you complain that there were only 200 students present at the chapel in question and there- fore no conclusion could be made as to student opinion. What you failed to met;tion, was that those present voted overwhelmingly by a ratio of 15-1 against the present chapel system. You also attack the Student Council for its failure to give suit- able chapel programs over the past three weeks. Isn't that argument enough that there is at least one chapel a week that could ,be omitted? I'll .£0 along with you that the Tuesday and Thursday chapel programs up to now have been good. However, now that the election is past and the talks of students that traveled abroad have been completed, as has happened in the past, we are going to be doomed to a series of boring lec- tures by anybody that 0 the college can find. By next semester the college will be digging into the bottom of the barrel. There is oDJy one solution to this Former Editor Writes On Rushing Phiiosophy To the Editor of Concordiensis: I have just received my most re• cent copy of the Concordirmsis t!ated October 31, and I realize full well that the delay must be ·due to a slow-down in the Pony Express to this isolated outpost of same eight million souls. And when the East River freezes over i.t's liable to get even worse. I trust, however, that this note will reach you before what I have to say is antiquated-and, indeed, that the problem has not already been resolved by more recent de- velopments \on the hill.\ I inter.ded to write you several weeks ago, as a former editor con- demninf the political choice of a successor and pointing out the basic fault of an editor attempting to present his own biased views as the paper's on such a controversial subject as a presidential eelction. But I waited until I was more secure and now I can safely say \You supported a loser.\ '- --------------------------------··problem, and that is the one which Richard Loeber suggested. Let's The problem I would really like to discuss is rushing, which seems to have bePn a rr.ajor source of irritation on campus all year. I was deeply distressed to read in your columns the bitter invectives against the deferred pledging sys- tem by many campus citizens and I take it ·as a certain indication that the entire program has been misinterpreted by the students, in- cluding the IFC. What was designed as a solution to the overly-compressed, cut- throat technique formerly em- ployed seems to have degenerated into a \Don't fraternize wfth the freshmen\ campaign. Nothing was farther from the minds of the pro- ponents of deferred pledging when we pushed for its adoption last year, and nothing is more incon- sistent with the Union philosophy of \friendship\ than a ruling pre- venting the freshmen from spealt- ing to anyone about anything they want. Problem of Publications Last week we proposed to the Student Council that a committee be set up to investigate the need for, and the expediency of, reinstitution of the publications cut system. Our proposal, as recommended by the Publications Board, was motivated by an affirmative attitude toward both the necessity and the practicality. Our sentiments on this mat- ter coincide with those of the leaders of other student tax supported publications, they being the editors of the Ga,rnet and The IDOL. To know what the publications cut system is we must consider the whole financial background of on-campus pub- lications, as well as a brief history of the cut plan itself. When the three student publications make out their budgets in the spring, they estimate how much the paper, magazine or book will cost, that is the gross expense. Then an esti- mate is made as to the amount of advertisement income the publication can derive within the coming year. The differ- ence between the gross expense and the advertising intake is th amount of student tax funds which the publication is alloted. Under the cu1J- system, the advertising income was not all diverted to lessen the expense of the publication. Instead, part of the ad money went back to the paper's staff, being divided among the members of the senior board according to the amount of effort that they had shown during the year. As most of the student body knows, this form of re- muneration has been absent, but as many don't know, the system was abolished only slightly over four years ago, in the . spring of 1948. Of more than passing interest is the fact that the cut system was done away with when the enrollment was approximately 1500 students. Now with the student population (undergraduate) num- bering less than 1000 students, we feel the need for the re- installation of remuneration for publications leaders is press- ing. The incentive system is inadequate, and as a result the staffs of the publication are undermanned, and the publica- tions themselves often lack the quality one would expect from a school of Union's caliber. Back in 1948, when the Student Council removed the cut system, there were more than a few outcries from members of the publications of that day. The effects of the with- drawal have tal;:en a gradual toll, until today almost all of the work is done by a beleaguered few. Tracing the effects, we can see one that was immediate. In 1948, soon after the withdrawal, the editor of the Garnet resigned for reasons which he didn't care to disclose, general- ly interpreted as his reaction to the withdrawal of the cut fund. More concrete results can be seen with the IDOL which went into a literary limbo for a year, because that \college spirit\ which the SC had assured everyone would be satisfactory tumed out .to be of a very nebulous nature. In the past, under the cut system, editors served for a cme year term. With this publication that term usually covered a yearly stretch from April to April. The entire senior board usually underwent a revision at this time, and they didn't have to worry about successors. A realization that one will share in a sizeable plum certainly spurs one to greater achievement. If our convictions are that we need the cut system, we are equally convinced that it is practical. At the present time there is but one member of the paper, yearbook or magazine that receives any money whatsoever. He is the businss manager, (as well as the members of his staff to a lesser extent) and his reward is a commission on sales. The expediency of reincarnation of the cut system is bound up with the idea of how important the publications are to campus. The IDOL disappeared, but returned. In the same sense, it could happen to the Concordiensis and the Garnet. They too would return, but possibly this trend might be endless. Incentive seems to be of a very fleeting nature, coming and going as the winds. If we are to have healthy, self-perpetuating publications, ones of which the students and the college itself can be proud, then we urge the Student Council to again ad.opt the publications cut system.· -J.

Co-Eds Want Union Men To Move to N orthwestet·n To the Editor of Concordiensis: After browsing through a copy of ~our journalistic en~eavors, we arnved at the followmg conclu- sion: Union men are afflicted with a strange disease, which, if allowed to spread, will return our civiliza- tion to the age of cavemen. As this would be rather inconvenient, due to the short hair styles of most girls and the fact that cloth- ing apparel is apparently here to stay, we recommend the exile of Union to Saudi-Arabia for a cure. If this is not possible because of lack of transportation or the in- ability of Unionites to pass the immigration requirements of Saudi- Arabia, (Is this possible?) we sug- gest the relocation of Union-pre- ferably to the Northwestern cam- pus where we might try to do our little bit for you poor boys. \ As you might suspect this is a selfish motive! The ratio of men to women at Northwestern Uni- versity is one !!.I1d on!)-l;ll).lf tg one, and, really, it is most unsatisfac- tory ~hen op.e is reduced to going out wtth half a man, We believe this situation would be remedied were Union relocated here. If neither situation is pleasing to you, there are always little liver pills-or anything, please! A few Northwestern cO-eds The philosophy behind the orig- inal plan-or at least my inter- pretation of it-was to place rush- ing during the first term on a more informal basis. Formal rush- ing, including invitations to par- ties, etc., was to be limited to cer- tain days as prescribed by the IFC and was to include blanket invi- tations by all the fraternities to all the freshmen. The idea, of course, was to allow the first year men full use of the social program and to let them see all the houses, if they so desired. Naturally, such an informal pro- gram would und_oubtedly result in certain fresh becoming more friendly with some fraternity men than with others. But certainly this is not unfair rushing practice. It is, instead, merely the free choice of friends by free men on a free college campus. The idea behind improving the rushing sys- tem, in addition to taking the be- ginning-of-the-year pressure off the neophytes, was to make the final choice of a fraternity by a freshman the result of a natural friendship and not of sicky-sweet rushing practices. No fraternity can pull the wool over the eyes of a freshman for an entire sem- ester. It would be almost suicidal to try. But the new system can- not be given a fair chance unless friendships are allowed to develop naturally. The important thing', after all, is that fraternities and freshmen are happy with their mutual choices. I still feel that Union men are mature enough to work out rush- ing problems informally, given. a whole semester without silly re- strictive rulings by a scared IFC. If deferred rushing to to mean \Keep away from the freshmen,\ then it would be best for all con- cerned to go back to slapping pins on the first year men on the trains, before they even reach Schenectady in the fall. .Jay N.
