Sixty thousand dollars was added by the Board of Trustees to $275,000 collected by the alumni committee. Dr. Carter Davidson, Union Col- lege President, stated that the firm of McKim, Mead and White of New York had completed blue- prints for the structure but that increased costs of materials had brought the price for the athletic plant close to th.e half mi11ion dol- lar mark. \By making changes in materials used,\ Dr. Davidson explained, \we hope the cost can be pared to the original estimate. He added that the construction will not start until all the necessary funds are on hand, no matter what the final cost is.\ Dr. Davidson stated that among the reasons for holding up the construction of the edifice was \a considerable amount in uncollected ,pledges.\ $25,000 'Uncollected ·.,;\ honor of being host at this meeting.'

The sp01·ts staff of your University newspaper is dreadfully overworked and unless new talent can be gleaned from the underclassmen we may have to fold up this part of the journal and turn it over to a group desiring to publish old chen:listry reports.\ This bit of information was taken from \The Campus,\ weekly newspaper at the University of Rocheste1·. It more than faintly resembles the situatwn facing the activities at Union_ We are not ones to curse, but in the face of the present apathetic situation, an epithet certainly seems in orde1·. Let's take a look at the record. Last year at this time there we1·e the same loud cries, and those verbal blasts are as applicable now as they were then. Only a few freshmen have joined the ranks of the same tired few who wearily put the activities to bed last June. Are the so-called \major\ activities much better off? The :Mountebanks are back and, we hope, functional. But a careful look reveals some of the old faces who always end up with the lion's share of the work. WRUC, undoubtedly in the best shape of all of the Union student-directed enter- prises, was late going on the air Sunday evening, and Mon- day night stopped broadcasting before the scheduled time because there was no one willing to work any longer_ \All the hair of all the freshmen should be cut,\ was the statement attributed to Pro:fessoJ' F. L. Bron- ner, the sage of Bailey Hall, 15 years ago, ~his was at a time when-as no-w-a group of idealists with no e:s:perienc-e in the care a1;1d feeding of freshmen, had forced the tempor~:~:.ry dissolution of the Sophomore Dis<!ipline Committee. Sophomores spent a harrowing September and October back in 1937 as a large and spirited fresh- mart class nrt-ually took ove1· the running of the college. With no Discipline Co.rurnittee to check their excesses, the neophytes took to painting sophomores instead of the Idol, inter-rupti'llg meetings of the Student Council with intricate alarm systens and exploding stench bombs under •tzppm·class bleachers at football gam-€s. Eventually, H:Je Student Cour.cil of 1937 moved to quell the uprisinrs by arraigning si:x freshman trouble- makers and sentencing four of them to have t11eir locks shorn in the college barbershop. which was then run by a.pre-Iaw student. The frosh were duly trimmed and with- in. a few hnus \dinks'' <beanies) began to be t•Esurrected from waste baskets and dresser drawers. Sopho- mores crawle-d <mt of their hiding places and the Student Council held an orderly, uninterrupted meeting. President 'DiKon Ryan F-ox made the lofty •Obse-rvation to a Concordy reporter that ''Cornplete trimming of the head o-r half the head' would attract too much attention oif the campus. On the other hand, I can imagine a special .tonsure that would have full meaning on campus and would not be too conspicuous outside. I believe we are on the right track .. ,\ ¥ ... l{o Not all of the entering class has been cutting up on the campus. One of the newest Dutchmen was reading the latest issue of \Scienti- fic American\ in the living room o-f Thompson Ball at Skidmore last Saturday night ... w.hen a young lady flounced in, noticed him, and queried, \Are you looking for Cyn?\ With unusual presence of mind and considerable dignity, our hero re- plied, \Oh no!

On Student Awareness Now that the World Series is over, a disgustingly lai•ge number of Uni<Jn students will revert to their on-campus w·orld of security. The need for awareness on the Union campus is a matter which has been discussed often before in the columns of Concordiensis. · Last year, a noteworthy step was taken oy Concordien- sis to give impetus to this awakening to world affairs. The symposium method-student discussion of American poli- tics and foreign policy-was initiated by the last previous editor, Donald E. Schwartz. We of C()ncordiensis feel that these symposia had some effect <Jn students' thinking he1·e at Union.College, and we hope their significance was of a lasting nature. H{}wever, we do not intend to stop there. We shall con- tinue these student seminars in newsprint, with the first panel of the year next week. The series of Chapel lectures on the coming election seems to signify that there are like sentiments among faculty members on this subject. Professor Harold A. Lar- rabee, the lead off speaker last Tuesday, cautioned that Union Collegoe students should be capable of \mature poli- tical discussions.'' If the faeulty took the first step toward improving student interest this semester, Concordiensis wants to keep the ball rolling. The IDOL magazine is testing campus opinions with. its polls on the election; however, awareness is more than \Writing your preference in the presidential election on a piece of paper which is handed to you as you enter Memoria] Chapel. For an election year, our \Letters to the Editor\ de- partment has been quite barren. Perhaps we are partly to blame· for this. This editorial and the symposium of next week an intended to stimulate interest. They are a means to an end. You will not be reading expert analyses of the candidates and their pl'ograms, rather you will dis- C!Over that these are classmates of yours who are far less reticent, and willing to take advantage of the freedom of speech which America provides. In politics and world affairs, like in football, America h.as bred too many \Monday morning quarterbacks.\ The great majority of the Union College student population is not eligible to vote next month. However, they .can eme1·ge .from theh· \g()nfalon bubble\ to speak their mind. If the students are capable of discussing the poli- tical problem dearly, then the ·Concordiensis, as a rep- l'€sentative of the students, should also take a stand. In offering our choice to you, the students, we hope to en- oourage you to do some thinking of your own. Although. some of the more stereotyped among you consider the student newspaper as a melting pot of your own opinions, we must certainly disagree. If we we1'e to concur in this idea, the Concordiensis would not only be the compound ()f very few opinions, but we would also have been the backer of every losing Republican presidential candidate since 1932. For the last two decades at least, the students here h~ve shown an overwhelming Republican sentiment. The proof of this is to be found in polls con- ducted by b()th. Concordiensis, and our sister. publication, The IDOL. In backing- Adlai E. Steven~on for President of thoe United States, we do so not only because we feel the neces- sity of making a stand, but also because he is a man who has brought int~llect back into the limelight as a qualifica- tion for President of the United States. We offer you. Adlai E. Stevenson as a symbol of order and rationality in times that are full of disorder. Matthew Arnold's phase, ''sick hurry and divided aims\ is the best characte1'ization ·of the American political scene that we lmow. We are certain that in supporting Adlai E. Steven- SOil for the office of President of the United States, we are backing the man who will serve his country best. This is not a year :fol' \fair weather\ adherents. We invite you, the students, to speak up. -J. J. c. Because we dot believe that the program as it is now being handled will fulfill its intrinsic purpose, we cannot agree that the present ru1es are satisfactory. As the rules now stand, the deferred rushing pr0gram will do nothing but postpone the chaos 0f \blitzkreig rushing\ for or.e semester. Why? Why can't we eliminate the confusion completely? The tools are in Ollr hands in the guise of a PROPERLY conducted deferred rushing p1·ogram. We would like, therefore, to ]Hopose the followinp,· modi- fications in the program: a) Freshmen will' have the right to talk to fraternity men at any time on any subject. b) No freshmen Inay be invited to any meals, smokers or other fraternity functions, either on or ·off campus during the first semester. c) No freshmen will be allowed in any fraternity house after 6:00 P.M. in the evening except on Saturday when they may remain until twelve. The deferred rushing system is definitely a: good sys- t~m. Why, therefore must it be made inefficit>nt by an absurd set of rules concerning- freshman-upperclassmen relationships? We believe that if these modifications were instituted, then the enth·e system would operate to the utmost satisfaction -of all concerned. We hope that all of you will think intelligentlv about this critical problem, and then, when you have made your decision, whichever way you decide, we hope you will make your views known. One very satisfactory method of voic- ing your opinion is to write a short letter to the editor ·)f the Concordiensis. Loet us hear what you have tr. say! If you agree with our opinions on this issue we will do our utmost to have the rules changed and to make the deferred rushing program wh.at it ought to be-an efficient aHd workable system. -Pete1· Adler For Your Information FRIDAY, OCT. 10: Daily Assem- bly, Recital, Dr. E.

Letter to the Editor To the Editor of Concordiensis: I would like to make a plea to the owners of the various dogs that inhabit the campus to keep their pets out of chapel if they can't keep them quiet. There is nothing inherently wrong in let- ting- these canine denizens attend chapel; !deed they seem to enjoy chapel far more than many of the students, However; I would like to point out that it is extremely discour- teous to the speakers to allow dogs to trot across the stage, to bark to light and to jump on the guests: The impressions these people form about Union are· important both in terms of the students that win come here. in , the future and in tertns of dollars.

Yet I feel I ,ought to come to some conclusion as to which candidate, major ·or minor, is the most de- sirable, or rather, the least unde- sirable. ManY people, it seems to me, are faced with this problem in and almost election. It peculiar of our .political system that we _ make compromises on the partY or \smoke-ftll'ed room\ level rathet• than on ·the national level. When we nominate a national .candidate, we are sacrificing some of our in- terests for the sake of most of them. As a result we Americans get relatively stable governments but we must pay the price .of chaos~ ing, often times, between the les~e.l' of two evils. Whatever the politi- cal theory involved may be, we have General Eisenhower and Governor Stevenson as the major choices. Let us eliminate the minor party candidates qn ,the grounds that in our two party system, a vote for a minor party is at best a protest vote and we are seeking a meaningful as well as a \right\ vote. The issue which has dominated the campaign as much as any other is that .of so-called \cap- tivity\. I feel that it is a real issue because if we decide for Eisen- hower we are deciding in favor of other men such as Senators McCarthy, Bricker, and E;e~, Gov- ernors Dewey and Adams, a11d Messers Dulles and Hoover. Steven- son on the other hand· represents the likes of Senators McCarran and Byrd, and, of course, :President Truman. The record of th~?se other Republicans is one of opposition to Point Four, Atlantic Pa.ct, ant;li Marshall Plan, opp()sition. to Price> wage, and rent controls, .favoritism, toward Taft-Hartley. While Mc- Carran and Byrd have usually sided with the Republicans ·on these key issues, Mr. Truman has favored· his own Point F9ur pro- gram, Atlantic Pact, Marsha;ll Plan, and controls, while vigor- ousiy opposing Taft-Hartley. Thus, we can· expect from Governor Stevenson a general contjtiuation of the Truman foreign. :;tnd dome!l- tic policy, ·while we can look for Genera-l Eisenhower to oppose most· ·of Truman's .policies.

The General has come out. for no Federa:l FEPC while the Gov- ·ernor has favored a Federal FEl\C with most of the real .power of execution in the hands of -the states. Again the candidates differ sharply on Federal control of the .tidelands oil territory. Ike wants state control while Adlai favors Federa:l control. On both of these important issues, my sentiments lie with Stevenson.

Consisting of two but seniors, Eliot Loshak and John Moses; one Junior, Richard Hoff- man under the chairmanship of Herbert Rie, and advised by Mr. Wilford Ketz, this committee of the Student Council has absolute power to apportion funds on cam- pus. The members are sel~cted by the Council with the Junwr sue- . ceeding as chairman in his senior year. Sources of lnc<>me The tax committee det•ives its income from the following sources. rhe twenty dollar tax levied upon the students constitutes the maJor •ourcc of the income. 'I'he re- mainder is secured by taxing in- come of concessions at athletic events and indirectly through the advert~sing in the school pub~ica­ tions. The total income derived, from thest' methods supplies the tax committee with a budget of about $19 000. The tax committee acts inde~endently in allocating its funds to the student activities. These allocations are administered annually on the basis of the Com- mittee's evaluation of budget re- ports submitted by the various ac- tivities. The committee is respon- sible for all its actions to the Stu- dent Council. The function of this committee is tu spend the,, studt•nt's mor.ey in th~ best manner possible. All club surpluses revert back into the treasury of the cotnmittee. Pub- lications receive over 40% of the ~ommittPe's allocations. Those or- rranizations which at the present time receive their income from the committee are: The Union College Band Concordiensis, Freshman.

With all the major tal- ents and teach- ing facilities con- cen.trated so heavily ol!-e area, it is not difficult to perceive why so little theatre activity t~l~es place in the smaller commumtle~ around the country. Americans might make the mis- take in thinking that this is ~he way it always has been, and that there is no other road for an essen- tially sick industry to take .. No doubt the resident free enterprisers among us will wish to smite me hip and thigh for mentioning that America is peculiar in respect ~o theatre; that is, they arc alo~e ln housing the profession as a pnv~te industry, not to be interfered wtth. The usual form of these theatt·es, and one which has been almost completely eliminated from the American scene, is the re?ertory company, presenting a certain num· ber of plays alternately and chang- ing these productions individual~y as their popularity warrants It. The repertory theatre -is also peculiar to us in that it maintains a resident company of ~ctors, a practice which we have reJected as a nation. The result of these mov~s is obvious to us all: the theatr~ IS unknown in many areas, the IIl'_l- petus to work in the theatre . IS little because of the constant In- security, and talent that could. be devoted to this form of expresslOn is oftimes never realized.

Perhaps you've heard something about the transistor-a tiny and mechanically simple elec- tronic device based on an entirely new prin- ciple. It can do many things a vacuum tube can do-yet its greatest possibilities may lie in ap- plications where vacuum tubes have not been used. A few years ago this revolutionary device was invented and experimentally made by scien- tists at Bell Telephone Laboratories. Today, several types of fr-ansistors are in production at Western Elechit!-manufacturing unit of the Bell System. This didn't just happen! Its manufacture is the result of a lot of teamwork by Western Electric engineers of varied skills and training. Transistors are unim\pressive looking little 'things, but don't let that fool you! The most delicate metallurgical and manufacturing skills The 2A Transistor IIJustratad Is designed to flt a plug-In socket. In one use In tho Boll Systom, ribbon leads art employed as shown above, are required in their production. In one type of transistor there are three thin adjacent regions of germanium, each region containing chemical elements in ex:act quantities, the whole unit being no larger than the head of a match! Suit- able leads, or wires, must be positioned in proper relation to these layers with utmost accuracy, using microscopes and oscilloscopes. Transistors can do many things: transform radio energy for driving a telephone receiver or loudspeaker-amplify weak signals-generate a-c current-convert a-c to d-e-respond to light-increase, decrease or halt the flow of current. Small and rugged, they're going to work today in the Bell System and in varied types of' military equipment. • Quantity producing these nilghty mites-with laboratory precision-is typical of many for- ward-looking engineering projects at Western Electric.

By Mr. Ketz's own admission, two hundred freshmen will be unable to attend the Sage exchange on Homecoming Weekend, With house parties having been declared closed that weekend, these freshmen, if they do have dates, might just as well send their girls home after the football game. The rules on transportation, for the most part, border on the ridi- culous. A good percentage of the freshmen rely on the upperclass- men for their transportation to Skidmore an<l Sage, as there is no other practical way of getting there and back. Now this privilege is denied them. I, for one, would feel morally incapable Of kicking a hitch-hiker out of my car if I discovered that he were a fresh- man.

Dates, needless to say, are a'n in- tegral part of college life. Yet, the present rules lead the freshman to three relatively poor alternatives: (1)-to compete with the fraternity men for dates, where heretofore, he was aided by them in getting dates; (2)-to get dates through the in- dependent organizations on cam- The whole rushing program is, at present, quite unsatisfactory. Perbaps next year the faults In it will be brought into even sharper focus and we will remove this un- deserved burden from the fresh- man's shoulders and return to a program which will allow him to do all his studying and still main- tain contact with the fr~ternities. Are we now to regard the fresh- men as virtual intruders here, or shall we take them in, as indeed we should, as brothers under the Last week we published a story concerning new rushing reshictions IJassed by the Interfraternity Council. This a1iicle caused considerable furore, both in the freshmen class and among members of the Council. The way that the IFC has withdrawn social privileges from the members of the class of 1956 is really larcenous, and the frosh h·e is certainly justified. The rancor among the IFC members is an entirely different thing. A poll of a sizeable C1 1 oss-section of the members reveals 'Considerable contradictory claims. Can the freshmen ride with fraternity men to and from the locale of girls colleges or home towns, or can't they? The only point agreed on is that frosh cannot attend tomor- row's houseparties. One IFC member has told us, and from the recent action we do not doubt him, that the Council meetings are the biggest comedy of errors ever enacted on .this campus. We have our own pet opinions on the way that fra.ter.nity r.epresentatives m·e.selected. Our concept is that every mem- ber of the house takes the Stanford-Binet I.Q. test, and the member of the fraternity who gets the lowest sc0re is then the IFC delegate. In an editorial \Wl~itten for this publication last spring we recommended that deferred rushing be delayed for one year. It wasn't, and the result is· both a befuddled fresh.mart class and, it seems, an equally befuddled IFC. Defe1'red rushing is having more gestation pains than the mother of quintuplets. If the Interfratemity. Council persists in treatiJlg frosh and fraternity men as callow youths whose only desire is to subvert the i'ushing rules, it will Qn}y undennine the deferred rushing program.

IS space 1 · By Lola Stendig Colleagues, I've been asked• to present a thesis on the cranial• and caudal l).spects of the Homos ( N o t e : the name not propose imply a lack of hetero - activity.) These Homos are generally pecul- iar to mankind because the come from proud old tion in the hinter l a nds the excelsior state. show a great .preponderance of brisHed shaven heads, grey trous- ered legs, and white shod .feet. The eyes of the Unioniensus (shortened to Union Man for the sake of brevity) have, through a 'long series of mutations become .en- larged and bulging, <over \ogglea- tion\ of female types). On.e• ob- serves restless appendages, and a facial expression bordering on th..e submoronic. Physically the Union Man is concerned with gustatory pleasures, being most often found at the lower regions of a •local pub, Let us now proceed to a verbal dissection of cerebral acti¥ities. A student at an institution of higher learning must, of necessit)\ rely to a certain. degree on audio- visual aids. Our specimen is .no different. His reading matter is diverse, ranging from \Hopalon-g Hamilton\ to \Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies.\ This is light reading matter. To indulge the more- astute tastes we have the matchless prose· of Miss Windsor and Mr. Spillane. The Union Man does not neglect the mediu:rns of radio or television, either. Both are classified among his major inter- ests. Gangbusters, Horrible Hate Tales, Inner Sanctum, and Coagu- lated Plasma at Midnight are ·only a few of the educational pre>grams he favors. Unioniensis' .study habits are no less unique than his other char- acteristics. Notes are taken in Chapel with blunt pencils on the backs of racing forms and on ·old' chapel programs (for the collector's items), His courses are varied: Cheap Drunk 101 (Organic Chem- istry, the· study of alcohols), Eix- ing Tickets 202 (Political Scien.ce), Sexology 303 <Embryology), etc. Now we may proceed to the most Important phase of Union- iensus' life cycle-his de!l-li:hg with women. One may study this most typical form of behavior at ·its best in the house party. I·f .the Union Man has a blind date (the most obvious pun shall not be forth- coming) varied shrieks, moans, and strangled exclamations of dismay are audible. Our sli·bject then fairly ignores his date; proceeds to im~ bibe a bit too free)y and, in gen- eral, plays the :vole of the court fool to the hilt. If, on the other hand, he is dated to a \·real doll\' he will proceed to drag, push, pull; maul, squeeze, and ·in general, mis- handle the young woman 1,m<ler the sacred banner of the d~tnce, or pure love. At last, as· a price for the punishment l;l,e has inflicted on the poor female, he must relinquish his fraternity .pin or his honor. Here, dear colleagues, you have Unioniensus Ho)nos, a creatur-e native to Schenectady regions. It dwelis in the confines of the \cam- pus\ for a period of four ~ears after which it migrates to parts unknown and unheard of, at tP,e expense of the United States Gov- ernment. ---·o--- Placement News The first Placement panel of the season will be held Monday, Oc- tober 2(}, at 7:45 p.m., in the Oid Chapel.

To make some 1200 products and product lines the Company operates 71 plants. Most require steam and electric generation, water supply ·and treat- ment, heat exchangers, piping sys- tems and related. services. The de- sigirlng of these poWel' plants, their erection and operation axe all in the hands of engineers, the great majority being mechanical engineers • But this is not the most interest- ing thing about power work here. What challenges the highest skilhiof the engineer at Du Pont.is the wealth of original problems constantly aris- ing .. Power requirements vary enor- mously, not only from plant to plant but from time to time. Process operating pressures may . range from over 15,000 psi. to 2 mm of mercury, electrical requirements George s. Mahaffey, B.S. in M.:E., Penn State '52 (right), B.S. Norling, RB- i».

This powerhouse for a nylon plant at Martinsville, Va., was clesignell by Du Pont engin!!ers. It houses two 135,000 lb./hr. boilers and two 7,500 KW extraction turbine generators. from as low as 7,000 to higher than 1 milli,on KWH;day, and tempera- tures from -'360° to over 3,500°F. Here are examples·of' recent \off- the-beaten-path\ power problems. 1. A plant using natural gas as its basic fuel produces a waste oil of variable hy- dro~rbon composjtiqn @d a waste gas with only 110 Btutcu, ft.

At another plant 20,000 gpm of cool- ingwai;erwereto be drawn from a nearby river. Since the water level fluctuated 40 feet bl;ltween normal and :fiood stages, it was necessary to evaluate.several plans for pi.mlp-houl'!e constructions against cooling towers. The engineers installed a.unique pump hous.e who,se ·submerged vertical pumps operate even when the structure is entirely under water. Aside from design and construc- tion, Du Pont mechanical engineers concern themselves with such related subjects as economic evabJations, equipment selection, heat balances, load calculations, waste heat boilers. For example, where viuious process. temperatures from 300° to 600°F. were reqllited, Dowtherm was selected as the· supply medium at the rate of 35 million Btu/hr. The engineers installed a central system for primary supply because it calculated to be more economical than separately located vaporizers. On the operationai sine, M.E.'s supervise the supply of power and services. They establish perfbrmance standards artd analyze equipment for results, cost and maintenance • Edward W, Garrison (right) M.S. in M.E., California Tech '47, and Byron R.

Davis stuck with Dolan for almost three miles but Dick proved to have the most endurance and crossed the finish line with a five second edge. His time. as 20:31, was just twt'nty sccor.ds off the course record. Veteran cross country men Gari Clough and Don Stack finished in a dead heat to talle third and fourth place for Union. Stack, who is only a freshman, did amaz- ingly well. Cross country mer.tor Wilfred Ketz has hopes that Staclt may develop into another Dolan. Four-th for the Garnet was Eliot Schechter. Eliot, although a sopho- more, is running his first year of cross country. Other l'nion men out of the first ten to finish were Jan Walker. LPs Sobin, and Ed Konis. The team's only weakness is the lack of a fifth man of the quality of the first four. This situation may be rt'medied with a few more weells of work since freshman· Frank Magliato, just out for the club, has shown up very well in praetices. 1. Dolan, Union ............ 20:31 2.

Government Chair The income from the fur.d will be used for the following two pur- poses: A Robert Porter Patterson Endowed Professorship of Ameri- can Government at Union; and en- dowed scholarships for undergradu- ate study in preparation for careers of public service, fellowships for graduate study, and ir.ternships in municipal. state, and federal gov- ernment offices. In announcing the establishment of the fund Mr. Watson stated, \Robert Patterson firmly believed that government should be admin- istered by men of integrity and character, who placed. duty to country second only to duty to God. An appropriate memorial to Rob- ert Patterson compels considera- tion of those ideals which he con- sidered vital and important.\' The endowed scholarships will exten.d the opportunity to qualified young men to get an undergradu- ate education regardless of the fin- ancial condition of their families. Class of 191Z Mr. Patterson graduated from Union College in the class of 1912. While a student here, he compiled a brilliant academic record and was prominent In extracurricular activities. A member of Phi Delta Theta fraternity, Patterson was on the debating team and the Con- cordiensis. In his senior year he was head manager for the basket- ball team. His sudden death in a plane crash on January 22, 1952, was a severe blow to the entire country and especially to those connected with Union College who were honored to consider him an alumnus. Watson Heads Committee Many proming,nt names appear on the sponsoring committee headed by Mr. Watson. These In- clude, Norman Cousins, Editor of the Saturday Review of Literature; Oswald D. Heck, Speaker of the State Assembly; Irving M, Ives and Herbert A. Lehman, United States Senators; Robert Lovett, Secretary of Defense, who worked with Pat- terson during World Wa.J! II; Ferd- inand Pecora, New York State Supreme Court Justice; Spyros- P. Skouras, President of Twentieth Century Fox; Herbei't Bayard Swope, Tr!l!Mnn·er oj' Freedom House; and Mr. Patterson's law partners, Chauncey Belknap and Vanderbilt Webb. The Trustees of the Fund are looking forward to continuing don- ations to broaden the scope of the Memorial as an everlasting tribute to a great American-Robert Por- ter Patterson. ---0•--- Frosh Beat Sophs In Rivalry Contest With the final event of the Frosh-Soph Rivalry Week being cancelled, the point totals showed that the freshmen had swamped their rivals by a score of 220 to 90. Tug of War ()ff The freshmen didn't have a chance to drag the f\Ophomores through the \brook that bounds\ however, as the traditional tug of war which usually highlights the week's activities had to be called off because no one was able to find a rope that would not break. The 1\:tcGlone Plaque which Is awarded to the Winning ela~s was established in 1950 by the Class of 1951 In honor of a popular mem- ber of the class, J. Clifford Mc-- Glone. McGlone was .killed in an automobile ac~ident while return- ing to Union from the Hamilton football game in November of 1949.

Major League Politics To the Editor of Concordien.sis: It was with the gre-at es satis- faction that I read your editorial endorsing tht' candidacy of Adlai Stevenson fcH· president. Congratu- lations to the Cor.c01·diensis for taking a stand on this rne>st im- portant issue of the yem·. For over a year, the Concordi- t•nsis has urgt>d students to give S<'t·ious attention to questions of national importance. Throu.gh th<:' medi·um of persuasion, various poir.ts of viPw havP been pt'esented atterr.ptinf2: to convince stud€nts to adhPre to a particular vie'wpoint, or at the least, to give independent thought to the matter. The logical conclusion of this position is for the newspaper itself to co mit it- self in its editorial column. :as long- as opposing points of vievv, such as appeared in your presidential symposium, are published. Your decision to commit: your- self is surpassed only by the wis- dom of your choice, For a long time Union has needed an antidote to the outdated, deathly conserva- tiv<' views of the IDOL. .As long long as Tip Tower has felt the necessity of expressing hhnself as the leading conservative spol1esman on campus, it was essential for the Concordiensis to countel\ these opinions. This you have dont> ef- fectively and courageollsly. Best of luck in yom ambitious ventures. Donald E. Sci:nvartz '52 As for upperclassmen who have C'ars and live in the same town as some of the freshmen, it is stupid and impractical not to give these frosh a ride, if not to share ex- penses, just fo1• the sake of com- panionship, I think the IFC is defeating its own purpose in making such ab- surd rules-the division between the freshmen and the upperclass· men is growing greater rather than focusing on the point--February 8, 1953. There is a growing resent- ment, on the part of the frosh, to- wards the Interfraternity Council. Are they going to tum about or will they be caught behind the eight ball? D. Lloyd Martin '56 Criticizes Sarcasm of Sage Ex!Cl1ange Column The Concordiensis is an old and venet·able institution on this cam- pus, and I for one hate to see its high standing lowered. I refer to an article by Miss Lola Stendig of Russell Sage College. Miss Stendig's article contained nothing but a collection of \wise guy\ comments, petty gripes and outright false- hoods. I have been hearing these com- plaints about football game dates and blind dates for some years. The standard retort is; girls, if you don't like us, don't date :.ts. I consider that a very good reply. The purpose of this letter, Mr. In the height of a political cam- paign, we are often apt to lose sight of issues •. which could con-··· ceivably trans- : cend the cam- ·· paign itself importance. the 1952 editibn, the only ate made capital of one such issue is Vin- cent Hallinan, of the Progressive Party .. The issu.e to which I rerer is, of course, that of peace and, more specifically, peace in Korea. While I agree with neither the Progressive Party solution to this or other problems, nor the general philosophy of the New York State branch of the Progressives~ the ALP, it seems to me that the ALP has served one of the functions of a third party-to call attention to an important problem which is not being given its full due by eithet' of the major parties. The issue of peace is probably; the one which should concern Union men most because if it is not solved, we may all find ourselves wielding g.uns and grenades rather than slide rules or scalpels. :{. Iii :f. This peace issue is not one which you are for or against, for we must assume that every sane per- son is sincerely opposed to wa1>. The question remains of how peace is going to be achieved. The first thing that must be done, it seerrs to me, is to alter our basic phil- osophy concerning the Soviet Union. If we continue to tre~t the R . 5 as a band of Huros mtent usstan ld mmun- upon making the war a co istic empirP, Wl' are sure to have war with them sooner or later. But I suggest that it is not only possible but probable that the Rus- siar.s at'e just as eager for peace and the finer things of life as we at·e. Russian youths of collegE' B;f e are undoubtedly concerned wrth many of the same problems that we are here at Union-women, careprs pass;n\ exams. Thus, on this ch~nce th;t the Russians sir:- cerelv want pPRCe, l<>t us decide our foreign policy accordingly. :{. '£. If. Specifically, we should not con- tinue to build up our armed forces. We should not, on the other hand, suddenly deplete our armies be- cause of the obvious economic ef- fects and because of the possibility of our having to resort to armed force. We should cor.tinue to send economic aid to all countries which need it, even Russian-dominated countries, for men with full stom- achs will be much less prone to fight than men who a;re starving. We ought to publicize ourselves as what we claim to be, humani- tarians and lovers of peace. Most vital of all is our home front acti- vity. We must work actively for peace. Peace is· not something which can be achieved passively but rather a condition like prosperity which requires positive action. Let us not label all peace movements as red and even if they are red our reaction ought to be let's show them that we can work just as .hard for peace as t;lley can. Our editorial cohort and political adversary, the im- perturbable Mr. Walter Tower of the IDOL magazine has criticized what he terms, \Our after thought editorial\ sup- porting Adlai Stevenson for the Presidency. We are not certain whether :\lr. Tower, whose loyalty to Eisenhower borders on the chauvinistic, deserves an answer, but we shall give him one anyway. Editor, is not to start a verbal battle with Miss Stendig. It's pur- pGse is to point out that articles which say nothing should not be given space. Her column made statements that have been said at least a hundred times bef0ra and was written solely for the purpose of being cleverly and indiscrim- inately sarcastic. Well, Mr. Editor, it's time for me to get back to my comic boolts !\Outlines of Physical Chemistry\) so I'll call it quits. Engravings Jn This Issue Are By We suppose, unlike the broad suppositions of the IDOL editor of course, that said editor wants some comments on the stands that our candidate Govemor Stevenson has taken. It is hard to say much for Adlai, since he has said so much, so well himself. There's a great deal at sta1{e in this election, but we certainly differ with the Republicans in what we consider the essential problems are. On the home front we rate the matters most pressing as Civil Rights, Taft-Hartley and inflation. Foreign policy is completely bound up with Com- munism. Here discussion should center around aid to Europe, Asian policy and Korea. Dems Not Alone in Guilt Most of you, since the campus populace is ovel·-..vhelm- ingly in favor of Eisenhower, will wonde.r \vhy corruption, the hysterical battlecry of the Republican party, was not included. We answer that political momlity doesn't split on party lines; to say that misconduct in office comes and goes with a Democratic administration is ridiculous. To get back to the enigmas which we consider the most weighty in this election year, let us see what our candi- date Governor Stevenson has to say about them. On Civil Rights he favors state initiation of programs to bring· about equal opportunity for education, employment and decent living conditions. His platform also proposes, \federal legislation-particularly . . . when states fail to act and inequalities of treatment persist.'' The Horatio Alger-like dream of Americans-equality, received its greatest setback with the passing of the Taft- Hartley Law. Stevenson wants the Taft-Hartley law scrapped for what he calls one \consistent with our demo- cratic practices.\ Inflation is a fear second only to Communism among the American people. The Republican promise that America be \taken off the \war economy\ is a paragon of naivete. With virtual Universal l\Ii:litary Training, a necessity, and the Korean situation, another necessity, this country will not soon come off the war standard. On the lowering of taxes, Stevenson has said, \I don't like taxes. But . . . we must spend to be safe and taxes are better than inflation.\ Appeasement Means \Final Disaster\ . The ubiquitous danger of Soviet Communism is the primary reason for a strong foreign policy. The Governor knows that appeasement leads only to \final disaster\. On aid to Europe, Stevenson has stated, \Our mission is the prevention, not just the survival of a major war . _ . \ The Korean conflict, he has termed, \A long step toward build- ing a security system in Asia\. Perhaps overlooked by the short-sighted Republican platform builders, Asia is certainly the arena for the balance of power in the East. We must convince the Asiatics, claims Stevenson, that \communist imperialism is not liberation but a more deadly enemy of normal aspira- tions for 'freedom and social justice than colonialism.\ What we like about Gov. Stevenson's campaign to date, viewing it in retrospect. is that it is free from compromise. The1·e have been no changing of horses in the middle of the stream, as the Republicans have dO'ne on farm parity sup- port. Tl1e Governor made no promises, because the Ameri- can people have been sold down the river too many times by candidates' promises. The Stevenson campaign started on a high plane and has remained there. Eisenhower, on the other h.and, has been dragged down by the barnacles of political alliances. He speaks in platitudes while Stevenson speaks the eloquent truth. Basically, Adlai is a major leaguer: Eisenho\ver is not. -J. J. c. Charles Sute~:, '54 Editor's Notp: You may be right.

An.other of Mr, Bradkin's pro- posals was that he and the ma- jority of the freshman cla.ss was opposed to the administrative regu- lation prohibiting freshmen from maintaining cars on campus, In regard to this point, the Council went on record as favol'in.g the administration's rule for the first semester, but it also felt that this rule was unnecessary during a man's second term on campus. A recommendation to this effect will be presented by the Council to the Committee on Student Relations. Albert Barsamian, President of th'e Freshman Class, reported that the freshmen were definitely in favor of the deferred rushin$ pro- gram. A motion was passed re- questing that the Freshman Coun\ ell, headed by Mr. Barsamian, take an actual poll of the class regard- ing their opinions in this matter.

The Necessity of Prom Support This fall bids to the Gridiron Ball are offered at $7.20. To many of you this price may1 seem a bi1(. exorbitant, and maybe you are right. However, the fact remains that Union College needs a fall dance, and without student support this dance cannot exist. We don't like to pay $7.20 for a prom ducat, but our sympathy is with James Hoffman who is directing the affair for the IFC with a mimmum of gratitude and a maximum of worries. Fall proms have never been rousing financial successes, and this one promises to be the biggest flop since the unveiling of the Idol. Let us see what are the headaches of Mr. Hoffman and his confreres. At this time last year, pledging 'had been completed and the frosh were at least mildly participant in campus social circles. This year, with deferred rushing, there are no pledges, and it follows, no places for the frosh to house their dates, save boarding houses and a few faculty homes. When last year, many freshmen turned out to attend their first college prom, this year whatever incentive they might have had has been stymied by a plethora of inex- pediencies. Perhaps this is not really so bad for the fresh- men, for an immediate head-long entrance into the social whirlwind might have rather drastic effect on their studies. However, it does leave the present IFC prom committee high and dry, and leaves doubt in one's mind if the fall proms at Union are destined to remain with us very long. Since prom attendance for freshmen is so impractical, the upperclassmen must attend in greater numbers if fall proms are not to fall by the wayside. Of course, it is ex- ceedingly difficult to reason with the upperclassman that his $7.20 is essential to the prom's success. He immediately assumes an \I don't care\ other-guyish attitude that doesn't help Mr. Hoffman and associates one bit. We may have painted a picture a bit too maudlin of a social affair which is supposed to reflect campus gaiety, but no matter how one perceives this riddle he can't escape that prom tickets are $7.20; no we can't subvert the tax; and yes, we do expect you to attend. There is only one alternative to the problem. You eithe1· pay your money and go to the prom or you don't go to the prom, because you don't care whether there are any more fall dances or not. Well, if you don't care this year, chances are next year will be too late. -J. J. c. Another Four Year Exile In four days the most publicized presidential campaign in America's history will come to an end. If increased registration is any criterion the voting· populace will num- ber about 63,000,000 people. Who are these people? The 11,000,000 more than went to the polls fom years ago. That is what everyone wants to know. Some of them are undoubtedly voting for the first time, others are those who felt that the mediocrity of the candidates in 1948 didn't necessitate their vote. Whoever they are, this is the very group which places any predic- tion on this election's outcome on very untenable ground. The Republicans hope that this group is the legion of voters who stayed away and probably cost Tom Dewey the election four years ago. The Democrats claim, and the sta- tistics bear them out, that these are the lower class and minority voters who have. been attracted to the polls by the incessant campaign to increase registration. Natura11y the Dems should expect to corner the majority of these voters, the tendency for the party to split along class lines giving some credence to this expectancy. · We think that the Democrats are right. We also think that the Democrats will win this election. We'll give Ste-venson about 283 electoral votes and about 53% of the popular vote. Win or lose, we'll be back in this same corner next Friday. Twenty years is\ a long political exile, but four years mo1·e won't hurt much. -J. J. c.

He con- fesses to .being confused by the new issues in' this campaign an hesitantly alludes victory \if'' \but\ ''and maybe.\ What is confusing Mr. Bean has been most excellently summarized by Roscoe Drummond, chief of the Washington News Bureau of the Christian Science Monitor. !Octo- ber 27): \There are so mar.y factors in this election which simply can't be measured. Such as these: The incalcuable influence of In- creased registration. The fact that some 7,000.000 'new voters' will be going to the polls for the first time. The probability that this year the nctt ion will r~<'ord thP hir g-e~t popu- lar vote in history. The increase is estimated from 10.000.000 to 15,· 000,000 over 1948. The effect of the women's vote which for the first time will ex- ceed the male vote and probably bv at least 2,000,000. ·The fact that some of the most ir.fluential issues seem more emo- tional than arguable-lil'e the Ko- rean War and the high cost of living. And, finally, the impact of Gen- et\al Eisenhower's personality-his prestige as a war hero and his non-political popularity-on the voting.\ The two biggest factors here are Ike's personality and the increased registration. The Republicans glow when they see the General appeal- ing to the masses-a war hero come home to save the country- and by far and away the most popular figure in the campaign. The Democratl3 fpel that the GPn- erai has compromised with reac- tion and the nation will not accept it. But privately they doubt if even Ike can in two months destroy his own reputation which has been tc>n years in the making. Only 48,833,000 voted in 1948. The tr inimum total this year is 55-58.· 000.000. It could go as high as 63,000,000. 74.810,000 are registered so far. A normal big vote d·raws itself larg·eJy from new voters, la- bor, and minority groups which have voted overwhelmingly Demo- cratic in the past. But what does an abnormally large vote indicate? Does it mean a censure vote which could be havoc to the Democrats? Or is it just a strong affirmation to iJCsure the present administra- tion? There are three general ways to analyze the voting populace and this time each yields a different result. Firstly by trying to prediet the vote statewise-that is how will Florida, Ohio. Mississippi, etc. go. Assuming H.S.T. won this way overwhelmingly in '48 without the South it seems sure to be Steven- ~nn. Secondly, one tries to predict by groups, i.e. labor, farm vote, South, Negroes, etc. Here, because the average person lands in more than one group, and because of the dif- ficulty in adding the result up you end in a stalemate. Finally, there is the method of trying to feel the nation's pulse, catch the wind of .public opinion, etc. This is done by interviews, ob- serving the proportion of letters to the editors, watching the crowds at campaign trains, etc. By this means Ike emerges the victor. Who can tell? I may be duck- ing the issue by not coming out and outrightly .predicting; but I fpc] better when I read in the cited Drummond article that George Gallup, the top polLster of all, with all his methods and data was pri- vately going around to the news- paper men to find out who they felt was going to win.

But though they are having a bad year, the Williams gridders will still be favored over the Dutch- men. The only team which they both met, Rochester, defeated the Garnet handily 27-14, while just eking out a win over the Ephman. Last Saturday's loss to Hobart will rank as one of the biggest heartbre;;~kers in the history of Union football. The first quarter saw a seesaw battle fought almost entirely on the ground.

High and low scores for a supposed Republican were +80 and -80 with +70 and -70 for Demo- crats. not have examined their own posi- tion on issues closely enough to find out to which party they really belong. or, secondly, that \liberal\ ol\ '\Young Turk\ sentiment among GOPhites has not yet been ade quately reflected in the voting rec ord of their party's Congressmen and Senators. According to the survey, the De1r. ocrats are .apparently in sub- stantial agreement with their party's congressional voting rec- ord, since 71% of the Democrats attained scores of 50 plus or better. On the other hand, only 9% of the young Republicar s agreed with their party's position on most is- sues. Only one out of 176 Repub- licans totally agreed with his party. At the other extreme, 36% of the Republicans disagreed with their party as much or more than they agreed with it, attaining scores of zero or below. One Republican totally disagreed with his party's stand. Independents Favor Dems Of 105 students who labeied themselves \independents 78 re- vealed a greater affinity for the Democratic voting record:, with 8 achieving \perfect\ plu.s 70 Demo- cratic party arreement scores. 23 of the independents inclined to- ward the Republican party stands wfth only 2 above +40; the high- est being +60. Four of those who considered themselves independents attained identi'cal Republican and Democratic scores thus apparently substantiating their own labels. Questioned as to the significar.ce of the results, Dr. Schmidt noted that a similar- pattern of Democratic solidarity is not likely to be ob- served south of the Mason-Dixon line. At the Johns Hopkins Uni- versity in Baltimore, Md. where he conducted similar studies two years ago, he discovered many low-scor- ing student Democrats who, he feels, rr.ay actually be Republice in sentiment but Democratic by reason of geogr-aphy, social pres- sures and environmental traditioll.S. Reasons For Low Score As to the reasons for the low score of Republicans at Union, Dr. Schmidt suggests that similar pres- sures may worlt on Republicans in this geographical region.
