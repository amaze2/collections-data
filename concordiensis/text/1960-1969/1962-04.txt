Emancipa- tion was not foremost in the minds of the leaders. Negro lib- i. eration was not a reality despite the 13th, 14th, and li>th Amend- ments to the Constitution. Counter Revolution The Negro was ab11ndoned and left landless and moneyless after Federal troops· were removed following the compromise deciding the outcome of the Hayes-Tilden election of 1887. A \Confederate counter-revo- lution\ drove them from the polls by the use of political mechina- · tions such as grandfather dauses and all-white primaries. Violence initiated by the Klu Klux Klan also kept them away. The Negro was made a sharecropper, and subject to police brutality and lynchings.

Hall, except the concession of holding off destruction of the building until the summer of '63, a very short term solu- tion. Under these circumstances, the Editorial Board of the Concordiensis goea on reeurd as opposing the present decision for the removal of Washbul'n Hall, and the reloca- tion of its offices all over campus. What is feared worse than the inconveniences that would ensue, is that relocation of\Washburn's present occupants in Old Gym will not be •!temporary,\ as is designated by the College. The Lan- guage department has been \temporarily\ housed in its old converted army barracks since El\7. the same being true for the AFROTC prest>ntly in \DewL·y Hall.\ No one knows how long math has been serving an alien citizenship in the General Engineering building. The expensive and difficult job of relocating WRUC with all its power lines in Old Gym only adds to the perma- nency of the new location, especially with Math, Geology, Language, and AFROTC all having priority on new con- structions, none of which have yet been planned. As for the theater, we fear it will suffer a long period of exile. If our entreaties are useless, and next fall must wit- nesl'l. .the loss of Washburn, we offer a more suitable re- ariangement. Since the second floor of Old Gym is·to go to th.e Admissions Department and Dean Pollod, why not devote the entire first floor to the AFROTC '? This leaves the way clear for the removal of Dewey Hall as was prom- ised in last summer's newsletter. The r.ctivities could then be rehoused in Nott Memorial. Along the sides of the first floor is sufficient room for the publications and WRUC. A simple ceiling would then suffice for providing a temporary art gallery or museum, as used to exist, on the second floor. The center of the first floor could be easily turned into either a theater in the round, lecture hall and meet- ing place for the IFC and SC, or into the Book Store, with the basement utilized as a stock room. This would leave the dome for storage or a theatPr, should the first floor be used for something else. :!. Dm•s he have the ability to work \\'.ith othe-rs, on all IPwls? 4.

This is pE>rhaps the· most mnazing ronrlushm. that a: stu- !dC'nt ean rh·aw from a four year C'X[Jnsun. To t<'arh in college a man must as a primary requisite be an independent thinkel'.

Under these circumstances, the Editorial Board of the Concordiensis goe3 ort record as opposing the present decision for the removal of Washburn Hall, and the reloca- tion of its offices all over campus. What is feared worse tha:.n the inconveniences thut would ensue, is that relocation ofWashburn's present occupants in Old Gym will not be •!temporary,\ as is designated by the College. The Lan- guage department has been \temporarily\ housed in its old converted army barracks since 1 !1 1~. the same being true for the AFROTC presently in \Dewt•y Hall.\ No one knows how long math has been serving an alien citizenship in the General :mngineering building.

As for the theater, we fear it will suffer a long period of e~ile. If our entreaties are useless, and next fall must wit- nesl3, .the loss of Washburn, we offer a more suitable re- ari~gement. Since the second floor of Old Gym is to go to th.e Admissions Department and Dean Pollock, why not devote the entire first floor to the AFROTC? This leaves the way clear for the removal of Dewey Hall as was prom- ised in last summer's newsletter. The 2.ctivities could then be rehoused in Nott Memorial. Along the sides of the first floor is sufficient room for the publications and WRUC. A simple ceiling would then suffice for providing a tempo.rary art gallery or museum, as used to exist, on the second floor. The center of the first floor could be easily turned intb either a theater in the round, lecture hall and meet- ing place for the IFC and SC. or into the }3ook Store, with the basement utilized as a stock room. This would leave the dome for storage or a theatPr, should the first floor be used for something else. ~onnan G.

E. 41 ( ON PI In this manner we have eliminated the noxious sight of Dewey Hall, relocated all the activities, and have made more appropriate use of the library than turning it into an administration building. With admissions moving into Old Gym, the present \Ad\ building is sufficiently spacious, and e'iminates the necessity of LuEdinv, a i arkinr, l(Jt in the center of campus. The \temporary\ quarters are thus more compatible wit.:1 their function (for it was not de- signed to be an office building) , and should suffice until a Stu-dent Union is \btdlt to accomodate ail tl1ese i'unctiens. We believe this compromise is both more equitable and practical than the onE' presently under discussion. Stated simply, our pr0blem. is this.

It is now the job of the student body to question, criticize, and vote on this legislation. It is not enough that students criticize Trustee and Administrative decisions, they must question just as critically motions passed by their Student Council. The most important Student Council legislation of the week, was the proposal for alterations in the Social Rules. They are not an attempt to encourage promiscuity on the campus, but an honest effort to exercise social respon~ibili­ ties and freedoms compatible with the academic ones. Un- ion students are not unruly high school freshmen, bu.t are weU aware of the social restraint and morality expected of them. The trustees rightly claim that .college is a place where the individual should \develop.\ This aim is in no way served by the presently childish social rules. K~ping the students and their dates in a public room under the watchful eye of the chaperone only fosters surrepticious activity, rather than adult responsibility. If anyone in the Adminl.stration or on the Board of Trustees thinks that students who haven't seen their girl friends for four weeks sitdemurely in the \public rooms\ talking to the <!hap- erones, is under a great misconception. Either they sneak upstairs, keep their dates off campus at a motel, or the \public rooms\ degenerate into disgusting \red light\' dis- triCts, with bodies strewn all over the floor like eattle. This is certainly not a healthy, student like, responsible, or gentlemanly atmosphere in which to entertain young ladies. The students will never develop the responsibility and maturity expected of them unless they are treated like gentlemen instead of bovine. We therefore urge the Trus- tees to consider the new proposals carefully, for they rep- resent a code of behavior, trust, and responsibility, neces- sary for, and more compatible with, the dignity and :social grace desired at Union. The new Social Bidding method also adopted this week by the Council was designed to prevent the reoccurance of the debacles that accompanied this year's Winter and Jazz Weekends. At that time the sponsors complained of in:suffi- cient time within which to plan their activities, and subse- quently modified their programs, or presented bogus bids entu·ely. The Council has attempted to rectify the situation by assigning each class a \weekend\ on a permanent basis. This solution however, is inadequate, and not the answer to the problem. In the past, some organizations have no sooner \won\ the bid to the \weekend\ than they have be- come lackadaisical in efforts. If this is the case after the group has competed for a bid, what will be the case when they have no competition to begin with? Competition breeds innovation and creativity, while in this case we've seen lack of competition to breed complacency. Under the new sys- tem, should an organization's bid be unacceptable; there is no other group ready to take its place with a bid of its own. We therefore recommend the continuation of the present metho.<J with two alterations. Firstly, the alteration already begun,~his semester, whereby a group loses its bid if it fails to make the necessary contracts, should be implemented on a permanent basis. Secondly, the bidding period should be moved back further from the actual weekend, to provide the final sponsor with at least seven weeks working time. This is more than sufficient, since most entertainers refuse to contract for a show earlier than seven weeks away any- way. Thus the sponsor has adequate working time, and the competition is maintained until all the contracts are signed and in accordance with the original bid. The third piece of legislation worth mentioning con- tains the new amendments to tl:le constitution to be pre~ sented to the Student BodY. for ratification at the April 26 meeting. These revisions offer nothing new, but an a<!cept- ance and legalization of the status quo. They are results of an investigation that revealed that many laws pre:sently in the constitution are no longer in effe<;t. Our only criti- cism, is that th$ Council has offered no reason for their choosing to \.repeal these laws, rather than trying to imple- ment them. We- hope an explanation will be forthco:m:lng at the Student Body meeting, for it is the duty of the CQuncil to explain its actions, as well as to legislate.

The exhibit of eight paint- ings and eight .pieces <Jf sculpture, now on display in Old Chapel, is significant in a .rouple of unex- pected ways.

Even the lesser- kil<lwn sculptot·s in the show pos- sess this inventive dynamism; U,rsula Forster's \BaU Playe1'sn is beautifully graceful and rhy- thmic, and shows how vital the modern sculptor can be within conventional limitations. But the most exciting piece in the whole exhibit .is \The Seasons,\ by Ken- neth Armitage, which is great sculptme in .every sense. Its bril- liant spatial' composition can be felt only by looking at the work from all sides' The act of moving at·ound it also makes one realize the tremendous power and unity of di.t•ection achieved by the bold- ly-jutting forms. This wotk alone would make Armitage one of the most significant modern sculptors. Tri-City Symphony .

The purpose of this letter is not to condemn, but rather to en· lighten the administration and the trustees to the needs and de- served rights of the Union Col· lege student body. Social Code Proposal is a step ' that will be o.f much importance and significance. The Social Code Proposal treats each student as a mature, rational thinking man at all times, instead of only when he is engaged in an academic pur- suit.

The student body of Union College is known and respected for being matUl'e men, using good judg. ment concerning any decisions Ol' actions. In this way and in many other ways, the U Ilion student is. very similar to the student of Harvard, W~sleyan, Yale, Am- herst, Williams, Dartmouth, Ham- ilton, and other schools of <lUI' :;~cademic requirements. The ad- ministration and trustees of these respective institutions have plac- ed an obligation ai!d a large de· gree of responsibilit;y for acting respectably and using good judg- ment upon each student. These students are accepted and treated as men. The immediate question racised to the administrati<Jn and trustees is, \Why is the Union student considered different, and regarded as being incapable of using this good judgment an.d act- ing in the manner e.::pected of young men?\ Union College has once again started to take the correct step ~:;:::;::~:;:::~::;::~:;:::::;:::;::~:;:::::;;:~;,:;::;:;:::;=:::;:::::;;:~;:=:;:::;;:~~ forward with progress as was ex- t ._.,_....... - - • _...? emplified by the Honors Program, { etc. It is not keeping its policy Down to Louis', let us go, closed and used only to maintain Let the Jager freely flow. the status quo.

The Social Code Proposal as un· animousiy passed by the Studen,t Council last Tuesday, April 17, and to be acted on by the IFC next Tuesday, is a big step in the 1•ight direction towards this rea:li- .;ation of acceptjng and t\'eating the Union College student as an individual, mature rnan who is capable of using sound rational judgment and is able to \con- duct himself iil accordance with the obligation placed upo)::l him to uphold his own personal dignity and the best interests of the Un- Ion College community.\ CI'ati<ln.

Back To Knott It is really enjoyable to witness the college on the move, repudiating its conservative, lethargic, stigma, and entering a phase of vitality and daring associated with the early Knott era. Dynamism oH the part of the faculty should result in dynamism on the part of the students. Towarqs this end we review with pleasure the announcements of the past two weeks, initiating an Honors Program, College Council, Co-ed classes, and the revision of Freshman His- tory. Letter To The Editor Old Coordinators never die, nor even do they fade away. At best they becQme senior back-benchers and only occasionally permit themselves the luxury of looking back. Do you realize now many ef them this small campus builds'! Gus Fox, BiH Bennett, Bill K<~tz. Sven Peterson, and myself- the last of a long line of mimn· bureaucrats-we taught durin1~ our co-ordinatorships- dedicated to a particular inheritance. A legacy that in student affairs we had no power except that of moral suasion, counsel, and personal in- fluence. Like the Boa·rd of Gov- ernors of the ·Federal Reset'\'e System, we depended more on in- formal convet·sation than on co- ercion. I believe all of us were convinced that in the area of stu- dent activities and student govem- ment, .this system worked admii·- ably both for the students and the college, Yet, when it be- came necessary to re-structw·e the administrative office of Wash~ burn Hail, President Davidson >lought to keep alive the instinct of this policy by instituting al- most at once his informal dinners. These have been, I think, most successfuL The discussions have been warm and .frank, and cr.;a- tive, but obviously these meethgs have reached only a small num- ber of students and faculty, and Tippicanoe is long way off from September to September. All these changes will go further in stimulating stu- dents than merely by osmosis of dynamism, for they all capitalize on student creativity, latent under the presently less demanding systems. In addition, they are designed tq; develop individuality and responsibility in participating stu~' dents. The Honors Program, with its emphasis on independ- ent research will serve at the main stimulus of student talents, while the College Council, it is hoped~ will generate responsibility on the part of the student government. To th:e Editor of Coneordiensis: Today I was helping the two faculty members who are in charge of the direction of the Un- ion College Theatre, The Mounte- banks. After observing one of the professors painting and the other performing janitor chores, all done du1·ing a regular class day, [ was sent to the ·new mainte- ance building to obtain several rtems necassary for the op- eration of the theatre.

FR-4\:-0183 Because of the great importance and power associated With the presidency of the student body, certain abilities are naturally prerequisites for the position. The new presi- d~nt must be able to lead the council without dominating it, while bringing creativity, maturity, and experience to its furtGtionings. The Con~ordiensis feels Lawton Morrison best fulfills these requir-ements. During his two year office as President of the Class of '63, and his attendant work on the student council, he not only gained valuable experience in campus responsibilities, but offered the campus~ demon- stration of fine leadership.
