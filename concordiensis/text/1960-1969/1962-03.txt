Al ~anguilliuno, :\ltuk 1 )blnzlll~Pr A Vestigial Organ In its present ultra-conservative form, the Interfra- ternity Council is a worthless organization. Its leadership is stagnant, and its membership is almost entirely oblivious to important matters concerning the body. Its two prime functions, to set down regulations for rushing and to carry them out, can easily be accomplished in a few short meet- ings placed strategically on the college calendar. If its present form continues, we strongly recommend that the IFC be either abolished or altered radically in the direction of a progressive, aware organization. The present attitude of the Interfraternity Council members can easily be seen from a close look at its last two meetings. Two weeks ago President Rappaport called for nominations for the offices of secretary and treasurer. Since only nine of the seventeen houses were represented, several of which were proxies, and since no one would nominate anyone else for an office, the elections were post- poned until last Tuesday's meeting. Again President Rappaport opened the floor to nominations for these seem- ingly responsible posts. Again apparently no one was will- ing to propose a nominee. Finally two candidates were nominated. In speaking for one of the nominees, a more enthusiastic member of the council told the body that he had only nominated this man because there were no other names proposed. Actually he did not really know his candi- date but had proposed him because he was seated next to him. After electing these two responsible officers, another house president asked that a list of the members be pub- lished because he really did not recognize anyone else there. After much more meaningless discussion, the meeting was finally adjourned forty minutes after it had begun. each freshmen to visit each house once, and the current coffee hours would give the freshmen a firm basis for choosing which fraternities to rush during the formal pe- riod second semester. These are jl!lSt a few new, progressive ideas which we believe merit judicious consideration from the house presi- dents. We believe all will contribute toward improving Un- ion's fraternity system. If the present Interfraternity Council is not equipped to deal with these problems, We urge that it be abolished immediately and a responsible governing body be formed. Concordy Praises We heartily applaud the preliminary task force report on an Honors Program. It has long been our editorial pol- icy to encourage the institution of such a program as soon as it is economically feasible. We sincerely hope that the Trustees will consider the program judiciously and see their way clear to put It into being within the very near future . Letters To The Ed.itor To the Editor of Concordiensis: Miss Santha Rama Rau was on campus Wednesday afternoon, and was invited to ha\\e a discus- . siori with a \spontaneous\ group of Union students in. Hale House lounge. After attending this dis- cusion, three issues arise: ( 1) . Miss Rama Rau was told this was a spontaneous student group. These writers question why the discussion was not pub- licized so that all interested students could have attended. The campus seetns much con- cerned with student apathy .,- perhaps if more that happened at Union (especially in terms of discussions with faculty and campus speakers was made public, the apparent apathy might not exist. Students at Union are not as disinterested as they are often characterized. It is the administration, public relations department or the fac- ulty that is responsible. (2) The meeting was harassed by the innumerable newspaper and radio vermin which were set upon this spontaneous group through the machinations of the publicity department .at Wells House. These gentlemen interrupted the meeting and at- tempted to guide it into areas which they felt were news- worthy. In the middle of the meeting, the newscaster from WGY set up a tap.e recorder and proceded to ask a series of completely inane questions. After the meeting was over, they, without any dignity or grace, detained Miss Rama Rau for another fifteen minutes dur- ing which she was supposed to have a moment of rest before attending the president's party. Union needs publicity-of that there is no doubt; but when the price is the complete disruption of student meetings and the dis- comfort of the guests one ques- tions whether we are not de- feating the purpose of having guests on campus. (3) The publicity sponsored by the Public Relations Department was in terms of local newspa- per, radio, and television. Do the PR people really feel such publicity within thP Tri-rity area is a direct advantage to the college? a trial basis. FUrthermore, at 1;10 time have we intended to make a profit on the receipts from any method of music presentation. The RathskeHer is presently using the facilities of WRUC. but not exclusively. We will continue to use the services of WRUC whenever we feel it appropt•iate, which is a considerable portion of the time that the 'Skeller is open. We would hope that the Ex:ecu- th·e Committee of WRUC could meet with the Music and Decot:a- tions Committee of the Rathskel- ler to gain a better understanding of what the 'Skeller wants in mu-· sica! prograJIUning. We wish to cooperate with WRUC in any way possible and we hope that no ill feelings will continue between these two important organiza- tions. Executive Committee of the Dutchman's Rathslteller. To the Editor of Concordiensis: A 1 o c a 1 fa mil y ce\ebrated Thanksgiving 1962 last July - four months early. They had the best of reasons. Their youngest child, a 6-year old son, had just I'elturned from an out-of-town hospital from a successful opera- tion that assured him a normal life expectancy. Doctors had warned his parents that without the operation to re- pair a hole in his heart, which pre- vented normal circulation of the blood, the child would have less than a year to live. To supply the heart-lung oxy- genation machine that took over the functions of the heart While the operation was in progress, the Red Cross regional blood center in Baltimore provided 11 pints of A Rh Negative blood. Eleven friends and neighbors of the fam- ily donated blood to the Red Cross here in Scheneetady in the little boy's name, so that the same quantity would oo available for others. Thus, gifts of blood, along with medical skill, made the little boy's victory over death possible. To this story could be added those of five other local young- sters, who since the inception of the program in 1952, have receiv- ed individually from 123 to 235 pints of blood! In fact, their lives over the past nine years have de- pended upon the generosity of dunon who have the particular type needed by these boys. These and many other cases are the reason why blood is so vitally lmd eontinually n~ded. .

In this direction the IFC had failed miserably. Its failure cer- tainly cannot be attributed to lack of opportunity for the IFC representatives who visited the National Interfratern- ity Conference last November reported several helpful sug- gestions e;u;ily applicable tn Union. These ideas, which would undoubtedly add considerably to the constructive value of fraternities on the campus, were presented to the IFC and were subsequently ignored. President Rappaport and the other delegates to the conference proposed that all seventE)en houses cooper~te in food buyirlg, that Hell Week be abolished and that the houses consider a new form of rushing under which freshmen would rush the houses in· stead of the present method. We feel all student discussions that are college sponsored should be publicized so that interested students can attend. Under no cir- cumstances should publicity inter- fere or interrupt any educational student discussion. If the Union College Publicity Department is interested in publicizing the col- lege, it certainly should expand its endeavors beyond the Tri-city area. If you were asked individually to contribute blood by any mem- · bet of these families we are cer- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~;~~~~~~~~ tain you would gladly respond to that request. Cooperative food buying, allowing a much more eco- nomic expenditure of funds, has been used successfully at many other schools. Considering the poor financial status of many of the houses on our campus, all would benefit substantially from such an arrangement. Hell Week, or more euphemistically Greek Week, is a base, sadistic ves- tige of a system antiquated at the end of the twenties. A college or Interfraternity Council endorsed Hell Week is a dark blot on Union's image and should be abolished at the earliest possible moment. Orientation week can be substi- tuted constructively by the houses to clean and paint, pre- paring the physical plant at the start of the year. A system under which the freshmen rush the fra- ternities would eliminate the useless system currently in effect. Formal rushing today can easily be compared to a stampede of a large herd of hungry buffalos. Time is wasted talking to uniaterested freshmen while time spent with interested freshmen is too short to really accomplish anything effective. The new system would eliminate thi~ waste and place the responsibility for rush on the shoulders of the freshmen where it rightfully belongs. Perhaps dur- ing the first semester a rotating mea:l system, allowing In short, we feel that Miss Rama · Rau was treated with lack of courtesy and consideration. This was done in the name of Union College. -Hal Davies '62 Ben Lamberton '62 To the Editor of Concordiensis: In reply to the WRUC Ex!)cu- tive Committee letter of Febru- ary 16, 1962, the Executive Com- mittee of the Dutchman's Rath- ske!lar would like to state their position on the apparent misun- derstanding between the two stu- dent organizations. It is not the intent of the Rath- skeller to totally exclude WRUC from broadcasting in the 'Skeller and to our knowledge this has not occ.urred. As part of our overall remodeling plan we are experi- menting with different types of music in the 'Skeller. The juke- box is one of these experiments and it was installed due to stu- dent requests. The Board is not convinced that this medium is to- tally satisfactory and would like to reiterate that it is currently on Why not participate in this pro- gram along with your fellow-stu- dents on March 5th and 6th and help us meet the needs of all hos- pital patients and remember \The Life You Sav:e May Be Your Own.'' -Bob Francello '64. To the Editor of Concordiensis: The appearance of the Union College magazine, Sy~posium, seems to present a problem of purpose which is yet to be re- solved. Is Symposium an attempt to publicize the college, i.e. pub- lic relations, or is its purpose to £·nllg.hten and inform? The first iss1-1e of the magazine shows the fallacy in seeking to serve both purposes. If Symposium is to be the col- lege clarion, then such a feature as \On Campus\ has its place. If it desires to be primarily a liter- at·y endeavor, then articles such as \Power & Policy\ and \Why G.o to the Moon?\ have their pur- pose. Attempts at both, however, ultimately must be unsuccessful.

M. His topic is \The Literary Unity of the Iliad.\ Two differing schools of opin- ion regarding the unity of the Iliad have developed over the past fifty years. The Separatists, on one hand, claim that this early epic, dating back to the eighth century, B. C., has some magni- ficent parts, but lacks the unty of the whole, due to the misplaced time sequences . and concurrent themes. The Unitarians, h<>w- ever, believe that the parts come to a mounting cli111ax, with excel- lently combined themes and stock scenes. Youman will defend the viewpoint of the latter school, and in addition to citing- the various books of the epic, will use the lin- guistics, archaeology, and oral verse of the period as evidence. To Compare Books The speaker will also touch up- on a comparison of the Odyssey and the Iliad. The martial and free-booty .spirit of the Iliad ac- cording to Youman, sets it apart from the \get plot of the Odyssey. The difference in spirit and style which marks these two poems leads the speak- er, while a Unitarian regarding the Iliad alone,. to condude that they were authored by different individuals . .

In Conclusion • • • Union is not a third rate college. lt is an, .. institution which has steadily advanced from a state of mediocrity during the beginning of the twentieth century to a position where it is approaching recognition as one of the finest small men's colleges in the country. We believe that Union's attempt to redefine its goals for the next ten years is a laudable undertaking. Consistent with this introspection, the Concordiensis has followed an editorial policy for the last year of criticism, not of praise. We have attempted to point up flaws which we see in the college's make up and to suggest constructive solutions to these problems, contributing, we hope, to the increasing perfection of the campus. This issue marks the retirement of the current editorial staff. Before the new staff takes over, we would like to remind the campus of the following problems which, we believe, merit serious consideration within the near future: 1) The Honors Program: The Faculty Council is to be complimented for taking the first concrete steps towards the implementation of the long awaited Honors Program. Until now, there has been inadequate opportunity for the superior student to make full use of his potential. We are extremely optimistic about the outcome of the program and sincerely hope the Trustees are financially able to ex- pand it to encompass the entire college by 1963. 2) Faculty Salaries: In order to make the most effec- tive use of the faculty, salaries must be raised and work load somewhat decreased. One of the primary causes for initial dissatisfaction with Union on the part of the stu- dents is the lack of creativity in the faculty in teaching many of the lowerclass offerings. We believe that there is a creative potential in our faculty as yet unexplored. If salaries are raised and work load decreased, the faculty will have more time to prepare their course materiaL No longer would many of the freshmen and sophomores be plagued by a large number of the faculty offering little beyond what is covered in the text. Instead the courses would be more stimulating to the student body through the incorporation of up-to-the-minute information in the field being studied or new facets of old ideas being explored in student-faculty discussion. 3) Lectures and Concerts: We were pleased by the proposed budget for next year's lectures and concerts program. An expansion of the current series to be com- posed of well known, competent lecturers and reknowned musicians will contribute significantly to reinforcing an interesting, intellectual environment on the campus in fu- ture years. It no doubt, will add immeasurably to the prestige of the college around the country. Consequently, we strongly urge that the Trustees approve it as soon as possible, preferably to be instituted for the next academic year. 4) Fraternities: In their current form fraternities are detrimental to the image which the college is trying to develop. They are a divisive force forming the foundation of anti-intellectualism rampant on the campus. At present; the IFC is worthless in solving the problems created by the fraternity system. In last week's column we made specific recommendations for improving fraternities. They were co- operative food buying, abolition of Hell Week, one hundred percent bidding, and a system of rushing having freshmen rush the houses. (Printed in this issue is our idea of a satisfactory rushing program which is currently being used at Williams. It would incorporate frosh rush, deferred rush; cooperative and one hundred per cent bidding.) 5) Student Union: The most important addition to Friday, Mar~;:h 9, 1962 Task force Report: the campus buildings and grounds is a student union to . · be built in the very near future. It must inco:roporate suffi- •. cient space to house all of the activities as well as providing :. meeting area for the stu.dent government groups. In addi- ' tion; the student union should contain facilities which would · • Fraternities· make joining a fraternity not socially necessary. Such a The Task Force on Fraternities t d u1 has held three lengthy meetings s u ent center wo d do much to bring together b@th fra- since the beginning of the current ternity men and independents, thus instilling a stronger sehoul year. Its charge is, \to de, tt h h 11 termirte, pursua:nt to the basic a ac · ment to t · e co ege instead. of to a fraternity.

The Col- lege has an obligation both to' its local chapters and to the sys- tem as a whole to impress fra- ternity members with the impor- tance of adapting to. new trends in educaHonal and social ideas. In the end, however, only the fra- ternities themselves can deter- mine whether the system will .play a more constructive role, whether what is valuabl~ in fra- ternities will be pi'eservetl or lost. The College is convinced that sucu a loss would be both needless and· unfortunate_ Believing that th€ best interests of the Colleges as an ed~cational institution coincide with the best interests of the fra, ternities and their individual members, Union College will make every reasonable effort to ,guide its chapters along paths most useful to themselves and to the College as a whole.\ 6) Social Rules: The social rules currently used by the college are an archaic remnant of the Victorian era. They make no prov·ision for the maturity normally credited to a twenty year old in circles other than Union College. We applaud the current Student Council attempt to re- write them and suggest that the administration and trus- tees seriously consider putting Union on the same level socially with many of the other colleges. We strongly believe that the above mentioned areas should be prime objectives of the growing, progressive, re- form element of the campus. We hope that trustees, faculty and administration take particular note -of these problems since they are the only ones in a position to rem- edy them. · Williams College: Rushing Rules The following is a reprint of 6.

The Rushing Week shall be Goals Established The 1,'ask Force has set for it- self the following goals: (1) De- termine the basic aims and ob- jectives of fraternities at Union ·College as an integral part of the College. As a first step in draw- ing up such aims and objectives, the lntel'fraternity Council has undertaken to survey the frater- nities and draw up a statement representing the thinking of the majority of fraternity men. A preliminary report has been re- ceived but it was not complete and further information is expected by February. (2) Draw up state- ments of responsibility of the Col- leg to the fraternity, fraternity to the College and the fraternity to its membership. Most discus- sion has centered around the statements of responsibility with particular reference to the re- sponsibility of the College to the fratet·nity. ln this connection, it was judged that the responsibility of the College faJls into four main areas: academic, social, fi- nancil and health and safety. Pre- sent policies and practices in these :four are·as have been re- viewed and additional programs will be proposed. One has been definitely agreed upon by the Task F-orce; that is, all chapter;> shaH be required to have a fac- ulty advisor, subject to the ap- proval -of the Dean of Students, and shall have specific functions to perl'orm with the chapter; shall make a- report each semester to the Dean of Students concerning the academic pro!!ress of the group and shall be given an an- nual honorarium of $50.00 {25.00 to be contributed by the frater- nity and $25;00 by the College,). The total cost to the College of this program will be $425.00 per year and. has as a precedent, ,the employment of two faculty couples to live in the regular dormitor- ies and serve as Counselors for the students of all dorms. Consid- eration has also been given to the possibility of requiring each fra- temity oto employ a social hostess to serve as a chaperone a.s well as a cDunsellor for .social pro- gramming. Two fraternities pre- sently employ a person in this capacity and it :has been judged to be a definite aid to the frater- nity in the conduct of its social activities. ·(3) Consider what new or renovated housing facilities will be needed by the fraternities and determine what operating fi- nancial and physical plant policies will be required over the next te11 years. It was suggested that Dr. Weaver, Mr. Usher and Dean Pol~ lock make a thorough study of present facilities and prepare a report for the Task Force setting forth expected neec\s. Reports have been compped for considera- tion by the Task Force on Frater- nty taxes, mortgages. and notes; dates of original construction and major renovations of present chapter houses; and fraternity-set occupancy figures. It is anticipa- ted that the survey of the exist- ing facilities will be undertaken very shortly in conjunction with the annual inspections of all fra- ternity houses. Addition!

This should definitely help bolster a more or less sagging school spirit pertaining to athletics. We stress the fact, however, that a one hundred per cent effort must be displayed by the forthcoming membership to set up a group that will insure efficiency and smoothness of operation. Help must also be forthcoming from the various c.oaches and other members of the college athletic department to give .assistance on the adminis- trative level as well as to exhibit their influence on the powers 'that be at Union in regards to policies conceminjJ sports. This can't be a half-hearted performance by any of the individuals involved, or the results of some twenty-odd years ago will reappear. Each and every man that has garnered a Block-U will belong to the society and each and every letter-winnel' must work to fulfill the purpose of the gi'OUp. It is imperative that everyone attend the meeting Monday evening and pledge his support to work actively for the group. If not, we advise Messrs. Maras, Cohen, et. al. to forget the whole thing. On the other hand, if cooperation: is assured, Union College athletics will distinctly benefit from the presence of such a body as the Block U Society.

One motion placed on the books during the last meet- Ing could go far towards rectifying the situation. By calling for the enlargement of the existing body by the addition of another representative from each house (preferably a sophomore or junior) it would remove the core of the trou- ble. To begin with, President Rapaport .could fill his vacant committees, while at the same time having a more vigorous and interested council to work with. It is then that th€ IFC could regain the reigns of its own affairs; it is then that proposals for new social rules f0r the fraternities will come from the IFC and not the SC; it is then that it will enjoy the pre~tige of its predecessors; it is then that it will regain the respect of the campus. It is on the way, f@r realization of one's defects is half the struggle. But the other half, doing something about it is the havder. We wish them luck in their attempt, and only hope they continue in the same manner demonstrated at the last meeting. Far East: Ye 01de Jazz Today By Tom Krehbiel In the world of jazz, at least, history seems 1;o run in cycles. We at'e now experiencing another \New Orleans Revival,\ a resurg- ence of interest in jazz styled aft- er the early dixieland which was the .starting point fot· all the jazz forms we know today. It is likely that the present revival is !great- \Y a result of a. grow.ing interest in the \good old days\ of The Yntouchables.

For all its faults it had one virtue: it provided the machinery by which the more creative and intellectual elements of the campus could be br.ought together in a m::\,nner of mutu~l stimulation. This is of vital need on the campus. Climate of Learning This is the first in a series of articles in which the Conco.rdien- sis will il'iVite members ~f the faculty and administmtion t~ write on a toiJic of their own ehoos- ing. The opinions !!Kpressed in these articles are those of the au- thor and .do not necessar.ily re- flect those of the Concordiensis. qedures and better house admin- istration. I have seen a new spirit in athletics which represents the best of Union, win or lose. know is exactly what we are hav- ing a revi:va•l of. Really there is no such thing as a New Orleans tradition. One first gets a hint of this by looking at the titles of early jazz tunes: The St. Louis Blues, The Memphis Bl'ues, The Arka11sas Blues. Very seldom is there a reference to the Crescent City. There are also statements by musicians who were around at the time. In referring to one of the early New Orleans jazzmen Duke Ellington announced, \Jelly Roll played piano like one of those high school teachers in Washington; as a matter of fact, high school teachers played bet- ter jazz. Among other things, his rhythm was unsteady; hut that's the kind of piano the West ' was geared up to.\ (\West\ meant New Orleans, Duke explained: \ln those days, there was no other West to speak of.\) Leonard Feather asked one of Ellington's early piano idols Willie \The Lion\ Smith about New Orlean's Let us continue on to the ex~ ponents of ea11ly jazz. Who was it that originally played jazz, and' who has given it its continuing momentum? Obv·iously the young Negro musician. Please don't mis· understand· me, I'm not advocat• ·ing a \Crow Jim\ racist theory. I'm just giving credit where .it's due. It was the Negro musician who started jazz as we know it, and he has continued to develop and nurture it throughout the years. Most of the major jazz ·innovations since the fotm's in- ception can be traced to a Negro source. I believe, therefore, that to find the most va·Iid, most vital, and most important type of jazz at any one time in history, one m1.1st seek out the youthful, searching Negro artist and his. music. Today we find Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, and Charles Mingus fitting into this category, not, I fear Louis A1·mstrong, Jonah Jones, Tyree Glenn, and the others of that ilk. In fact the percentage of Negro musicians playing classic jazz to- day is infinitesimal, and tllose who· do play thus are generally lool,<:- ing back with nostalgia at their first social security check. Dixie or pseudo-dixie jaz2; today is play-. ed by white musicians who are more closely related to the world of pop music than jazz for a valid contemporary form of jazz ,ex- pression. Changing Times A third, but perhaJ?S weaker, · argument for considermg classic jazz as past hist01;y rather than present reality is its relation to the prevailing state of the cul- ture. Jazz is first of all a music of and for the people, ~;eflecting the spirit of the times. Dixieland· is looked u~on as \happy\ music, played m ' happy\ times. Swing reflected the smoothly sophisti- cated tempo of the era. To fill this void we suggest the formulation of a \stu- dent colloquium\ modeled after its present faculty count- erpart. It would be comprised of a selected group of stu- dents meeting regularly for the presentation of papers. This group would in no way be limited to either the Engi- neering or Liberal Arts divisions, and would thus enhance a free exchange of ideas across our balanced, but divided campus. The need for selectivity would only be temporary. The honor of being selected would guarantee a member's at~ tt!ndance and active participation, so necessary for the organization's establishment. The method of selection is not as easy to define as the goals of the organization are. We offer two plans be- low, one emphasizing the more tangible prerequisite of academic achie\·ement, the other the more important nec- essity,. creativity. AI The Elliphalet Nott scholars elected at t:he begin- ning of the year present us with a ready made organization of tw~nty individuals who have proven their intellectual capabilities and maturity. With the proper organization and machinery, this easily definable group could be trans- formed into the \Student Colloquium.\ But this group has By Henry Ferguso11 \Master K'ung said, Hig·hest are those who are born wise.

Climate renaissance.\ In the short time I have been An Improvetnent Although the editorial column is often used as a vehi- cle of criticism, it can easily be tmnsformed into one of praise, should an occasion warrant it. This is such an oc- c;asion. The Inter-Fraternity-Council, criticized two weeks ago as an ineffectual, weak, and vestigial organ, is display- ing promising signs of recuperation. Its past meeting was devoted to self appraisal and re-evaluation by many of its members. Realizing that they .. are being bypa:;~sed on every turn, they called for a revitalization of the membership as well as more direct action in fraternity affairs presently being handled by other agencies. Both desires of the council are really identical. Com- at Union, I have seen inet\eilsing efforts made by the faculty to cre- ate a fine intellectual climate here. I have seen. some exception- ally talented new men added to the faculty and apply their talents to helping those who are not born wise. I have seen an expanded and invigorated Lectures and Concerts Committee turn its ef- forts to creating a stronger and more balanced out-of-class edu- cational program. I have seen curriculum strengthened an d adapted to new conditions in many departments. I have seen eager faculty members, administrators and trustees tackle a ·massive in- vestigation of the college in ord- er to make it a richer and better place. I have seen an i~nprove­ ment in the frate:r'flity system with more equitable rushing pro- AU of thi~;~ represents a college on the move, a community deter- mined to make itself better no matter what the opposition, no matter what or where the inertia, regardless of the deadwood and in spite of the ever-present mor- ticians ready and eager to bury the rotting corpse of Union Col· lege. Asian Studies Developing Of all the attitudes taken by the college with which I am fa- miliar, its helpful and interested stand on the expansion and de- velopment of oriental studies best demonstrates what is fine and fot•ward-marching in Union Col- lege. At the instance of Presi- dent Davidson, I was sent to take a year of post-doctoral study in Asian studies at Columbia and was helped in meeting expenses in a sumer-Iong tour and research in India and some of East Asia. Now, the college is backing the development of Asian studies in another way. Profesor Hainebach, Professor Riedel and I have been asked by the Administration to dream a little and to present a plan for 3 wider program than is offered in my two courses in Asian civiliza- tions. While this committee has not completed its final report and that i'eport has not been approved by the college, I believe it is safe to hint at some of its features in this column. Our idea, basically, is a two-pronged attack built-in ethnocentrism to make on the of the standard undergraduate curricu- lum. Orient to Orient On the one hand, we hope to expand Union's Asian, African, and Latin American offerings by a broad program .of cooperation and cross~registration with our neighboring institutions. Such a program would in the first in- stance include- an oriental lan- guage, probably Chinese. We feel that a language program is es- sential. We hope that students will be encouraged to go on with. it in graduate school, but even if they do not they will learn much of the Chinese culture and civilization through knowledge of the official language. Secondly, we cannot afford to offer a wider range of non-western courses by ourselves. We can, however, do so if we permit cross- registration in a jointly-conceived program of studies and if we provide bus transportation be· tween schools (I wager that a twice-weekly bus to Skidmore would more than pay fol' itself if fares were charged students who wished to go a:lopg just fm· the ride). On ~he other hand, we hope• to estabhsh a plan for general en- richment of the college life. We feel that faculty and students alike think too much of them- selves, their own cultm·e and in their ~wn way. If. we could bring to Umon a promment non-west- ern scholar who would teach pel'- haps only a single course, but who would be available for informal chats and bull-sessions during a year's stay, we could help. orient people to the Orient. Another idea is t'o hold a series of •colloquia o~ , _non-wes~el'~ topics led by VISitmg specmhsts. An expan(!ed lecture, concert and exhibition prograin would supplement. But .the biggest and best idea (Continued on Page 3) ]Jeing the birthplace of jazz. Willie replied, \It's the writers . . . talking about the bands on the Mississippi riverboats.

But it is my contention that what is now presented as New Orleans or T1:ad Jazz has not a great connection to the originai article, nor is it similar to most of the other jazz played at that time, even though the people who advocate this type of revivalist music call themselves \purists\ and contend that jazz in its pres- ent form has been corrupted and polluted. I readily admit that if a certain type of music is to be correctly called jazz, it must be true to its roots and have a link of some sort to the past. But what jazz has that link? To de- termine this, we must discover the characteristics of classic jazz with relation to its players, the times, and its general environ- ment. First of all, the music itself was advanc.ed, avant-garde. It had grown out of and beyond its ori- gins in the primitive folk music and the European polkas, march- es, and quadrilles of the time. It was, as Nick LaRocca of the \Original Dixieland J ass Band\ put it, \a rev<>lution in 4/4 time.\ !lleed we ask whether Kenny Ball 117 Mohawk Ave. SCOTIA, N. Y. The world today is a technical, complex, and often disturbing world. What could be more appro- priate than a Miles Davis sound- ing as if he were \a man walking on eggshells\ or a phrenetic Eric Dolphy .squeezing harsh words out of his bass clarinet ? Certainly not Armst1·ong or Nichols p&in- fully mimicking the success which · was theirs in the past. Joy in Creation As Andre Hodier explains in his dPfinite work Jazz: Its Evolu· tion and Essence, \ ... valid cre- ation occurs only when accom- panied by the joy of discovery.\ l doubt anyone can find that joy in the umpteenth dreary reading of \When the Saints ... \ by the Dukes, or in \Midnight in Mos· cow\ by Kenny Ball's British traddie laddies. There IS that joy in Louis Armstrong's 1926 t'ecordings with his Hot Five. An<l there is that joy, in Charlie Park- er's \Now's the Time\ which has a closer connection to' Satch~s ear•. ly triumphs than any of the ph.,i• lated dixie lapped up by so m;my undiscerning hearers.

Like Schneider, he also took fifth be- hind two men each from Colg11,te and Syracuse. The record board in this swim- ming pool is now almost Schneider claims four spots: individual medley, the 100 ward butterfly, and the 400 freestyle and medley relays. With the pro- fusion of good swimmers coming in next year, Kal can go after three records which in his :words are \fair game for the taking.\ These are the 200 yard butterfly, which he has already broken in practice, the 220, and 440. If he takes any one of these records, and holds the ones he already has, he will hold more records than any other swimmer in Union's history. Ed Ruth nOW holds the record, which Schneider has tied. During the s~mmer, Kal holds the position of head sailing in- structor in a camp in the Canad- ian North Woods. He also keeps in shape sw~mming. This con- stant emphasis on training should do him well in med school, where he will have little time for long training sessions, but a little time for hard bursts, which should keep him in just enough shape so that during 1965 he' can· train for the Maccabian games to be held that summer in Israel.

Why not? Here at Union, such nocturnal idolatry is an an~ cient and honorable tradition. Who could count the eminent men who once dunked the Idol In Du~ Pont? Lately, however, the tra~ dition seems to have extended it- self to the trees, walks, and park~ ing lots. This borders on vandal~ ism. Let's not deface our. ~am pus .

The re- cently published academic standings might serve as an example. Why were aU the fraternities listed while the Independents were not'?

Just because Independents are not affiliated, with a :l)a- terpity is no reason for them to lack a government and or~ ganization of their own. Colgate University has both fra~ ternities and \house plans.\ Should one desire to stay \in- dependent\ of any massive, greek lettered, highly secretive, and chauvinistic organization, he cah do so without running the risk of being ostraci:zed, ignored, or suffering a limited social life. There is absolutely no reason why a house plan, on a limited scale, cannot be implemented at Union. The basic. premise is simply being that any four or five men desiring to live together can do so simply by choosing· a block of rooms. These flexible blocks can then organize themselves under a house plan. The first requirement is a governing body, somewhat stronger than the Richmond Council. The Dormitory_ Coun~ cil as a whole is worthless since it governs the upperclass- men as well as the freshmen. But, should we divide the independents into \Houses \South College House,\ \Richmond House,\ etc, a governing body for each could act on its own accord to provide the entertainment, social life and organization (for inviting faculty members etc.)· present in the more tightly unified fraternities.

However, if a man can meet our quality standards and feels that he is really just beginning to learn ... and if he is ready to launch his career where learning is an important part of the job and where gradu- ate-level training on and off the job is encour- aged - we want and need him. At Western Electric, in addition to the nor- mal learning-while-doing, engineers are en- couraged to move oal1ead in their fields by sever- al types of eduqational programs. Western maintains its own full-time graduate engineer- ing training program, seven formal manage- ment courses, and a tuition refund plan for out-of-hours college study. This leamiug atmosphere is just one reason why a career at Western Electric is so stimu- lating. Of equal importance, however, is the nature of the work we do. Our new engineers are taking part in proje<-'ts that implement the whole mt of modern telephony, from high- speed sound trummission and solar cells to electtollic ~elephone offices and computer-con- tmlled production techniques. Sho'uld you join us now, you will be coming to Western Electric at one of the best times ih. the company's history. In the management area alone, several thousand supervisory jobs are expected to open up to W.E. people within the next 10 years. And_:our work of building communications equipment and systems be- comes increasingly challenging and impmtant as the communications needs of our nation and the world continue to increase. Challenging opporlunities exist now at Western Electric for eleclrical, mechanical, industrial, and chemi- cal engineers, as well as physical science, liberal arts, and business malors.
