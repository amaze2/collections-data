Hallowed Martian reflecting on the moral state of Union. THIS IS FOR REAL: THEY MEAN NO SEX! To the Editor (honest) : Please do not treat this letter lightly, as we, the writers, most certainly DO NOT. I am confid.ent, .that both you and I fully realize what this present \jet age,\ has contributed to the moral decay of increa'sing numbers of our youth, i.e., movies, television, music and fashions. Indications all point to a very possible, 20th Century, \Sodom and Gomorrah.\ We must never permit this to happen ... NEVER ... NEVER! What can be done ? ? ? ? To us, just everyday working people, here in Corning, New York, there is only one answer ..• FIGHT .•• FIGHT, and keep FIGHTING, until this evil is destroyed .. In our small way, we have decided to do the following, ( whjch I am sure will be laughed at, and ridiculed by many). However, we are dedicated and deter- mined, and perhaps, being Godfearing people that you are, as are we, you will help us. As an incentive to our youth, as something to be proud of, and look up to, we are founding a \NO SEX BEFOR,E MARRIAGE\ club, and. furnishing, for the small sum of $1.00, a lovely certificate, 8 by 11 and suitable for framing, showing membership in this club, with his or her name, or the name of a group, organization, etc., inscribed thereon. In addition, we are also furnishing buttons, and wall-et size cards. We are parents ourselves, and we regret the charge of $1.00, yet this is necessary to cover the costs of printing, postage and handling. We desire nothing for ourselves; save the realization that perhf\ps our small effort will, in some way, help guide our youth on the ·only true path to happiness and salv~tion .•• the path of righteousness. As I stated above, these certificates, we think, are very lovely, and in addi- tion to greatly aiding one's self in time of trial and temptation, you might as a special project, purchase these certificates in volume, and distribute them among many, for whatever amoWlt you would decide upon, giving the proceed's to your favorite charity. Please let us hear from you.

Yet, the Sl!leech of Dr. Martin tonight is an encourag- ing sign, an indication that the spirit will be one of en- lightened liberalism and progressive education. Money rnay not be the primary ingredient in provid- ing the environment necessary for the educational experi- ence, yet it would be foolish to underestimate its influence in facilitating it. But the danger always is that the money will become the primary object and the students secondary. We be- lieve we cam see this happening with the forced movement of students from off-campus living quarters to the new dorms. If we can judge by the statements concerning this present dr·ive, this danger will be avoided. The emphasis on increasing the endowment is the most significant of these signs. A college is only as strong as its students and faculty: a good administration can be good only in so far as it can obtain these two requisites. And money, for salaries and for scholarships, is an im- portant ingr-edient in this process. Considerably less important is the physical plant. Somewhat obsolete, Union's campus has been a pretty but inefficient house for learning. Its facilities are old and overcrowd-ed, and, in sorne cases, such as a student union, non.existent. The funds set aside for improving these areas of the college will be well-spent. In sh<Jrt, we see this as an attempt for greatness. We have often said in the past that Union stands on the crossroads with the path of mediocrity and the path of excellence before it. We hope that the entire college com- munity, including students, alumni, faculty, parents, and administration, will join hands in order to make the latter path the one finally taken.

DeWitt. • • Cont:nued from Page Liberal arts colleges are not l>et- ter for being small. ... In my lay- man's judgement, the thing that makes the difference is the quality of teaching, - plu·s an envir<Jn- ment that is conducive to both teaching and learning. It is these two things, in my opinion, which determine whether a college will send out young men with heads full of facts, - or will graduate men who have acquired the happy fae- ulty of thinking logically and sensi- bly. And it is these things which the liberal arts college can offer so well ...• Only some of the things college d,id for me can be precisely out- ltned ..•. but lMk at yourself_ I d()ubt there ar~ ten of you in this room who could say in truth you would have progressed to your pl\esent position had you quit school after high school graduation. And if you can't say this, it stands to reason that your coll(:)ge must share some of the cre<jit for the positions you now occupy. But further than this, I suggest that there are not 1~ of you in this audience who can say, in truth, you are not a better citizen and a better perso·n than you would have been had you not gone to college. . • . . If Union did have a part in build- mg not only you but your business profit and credit, I suggest tllat perhaps you, even a:s I have a11 <Jb· ligation to that college. C • , u • ampCJ11gn s fflfll or Benefic~iary To Be 1 he Endowment Tl~e following are excerpts fi•ont Ppes.•dent Harold C. Martin's speech krel<mg-off the fund-drive . Tonight _we officially begin something that Pl'O~lses to be the single ·biggest \~enture 111 the history of Union College. We prop0se to raise twelve and a half millions ·in the next three yea!'s · we propose to raise $30 million in the 'next ten years. There are three grounds of necessity: so:vency, competition and quality.. The formula for cxcell~nce is the same the w0rld over: enthusiasm, courage, hard work, good resources. We have a go?d deal of all four going for us. The ch1ef suppt:nts for the operating budget are two: tuition and endowment income .. We_ raise.d tuition this year; we shaH raise 1t agam two years from now· and again two years later. Our endow: m~nt inco~e last ,Year wa·s $1,160,838. Without _th1s ca~npa1gn, we might. reason- ably- .proJect an mcrease ef about $63,122, a year. f1•om that source. The gap be- tween. mcome and expense can be ]ess- e.ned m only three ways: (1) raising tui- tlOn mor~ frequently or more d1•astically; (2) cutting down on the quality of our program; or (3) adding to endowment. W ~ ma;y be able to effect some econ- omles-mdeed, we succeeded in dGing s~ Ja·st year-but no one here, I am sure ~vants to settle for cutting back on qual~ 1-ty. We must add to endowment. Endowment The capi~al campaign plan provides that two-th1rds of what it raises wiH go to endowmen·t: endowment for suppor>t of the central operating budget, whi{!h is what I have been talking about, essenti- Gl:lly endowment for the support of first- rate facu,J.ty; endowment to provide some schol~rly P?Si_tion~ through name-profes- sors:hlps, d1stmgUishe·d enough to bring temporary and permanent members of faculty _to our campus; endowment to underwnte new ventures aiter they have proved their value in an experimeiLtal stage, the point at which foundation sup- port often disappeal'S and even the best programs are likely to be droppe-d <Jr to die of undernourishment. The plan provides for a substantial in- crease .in the endowment for scholarhips. Unless we want to become a rich man's colle_g~, w)lich is certainly no part of our trad1t1on, we shall have to strengthen our s~ho.Jarship resources every time we raise tuition. This scholarship, expense is, at bottom, one of the most Important expenditures we make for quality. The campaign plan provides for addi- tions to our physical plant and to our teaching equipment. This is the most visible a.nd inevitably the most glamorous part of -the program. Our laboratories are forty, fifty, and sixty years old; they are over-crowded and inconvenient; they l't\e separated and therefore inetffident. We propose to tear down, .build, add on and renovate until we have a comp]e~ on the order of the campus development map. If we can get started on it next ~u.m:m~r and can _move through each step tn qmck successwn, we believe we can do all of what must be done for about· four million dollars. Co/lege Center The other immediate priority build- ing is a. College Center. Insid~ the present building of Andrew Carnegte Hat!, cha-nges in interior ar- rangement would convert the classrooms and ~ffiees and laboratories into 1 spa,ce for mee-tmg rooms an~ workroo>n fo'l~ various student activities. Here students and fac- ulty and alumni would find a bullding suitable for their common and separate purposes. Three more bu:ldings lie ahead of us in the immedia-te future. Our fine new l,'brary, 1 arp:ely the gift of one trustee, 1s already taxed for space; an addition extending east fr(}m the rear of it will cost at least a half-million d·ollars. Alumni gymnasium, buil.t 50 years ago is still an attractive and usable struc~ ture, but it is far too small for the needs of our student body and faculty-. We have a p~an for a gymnasium to lead off the front of the Field House. The fifth new structure needed i~ one for the arts-for music, for theatre, for the fine arts which toge-ther comprise rne department in our· present organiza- tion. Th_e third and fou~·th parts of our :plan prov1de for renovatlcms and f·or acguisi- tion of land. We should unquestionably preserve the oldest parts of our archi- tectural inheritance, as the tru.stees have been doing piece by piece for manv yeat's. _The last part_ - land-acquisition - brmgs me full c1rcle to the point from which I began. Wh.a.t we feel the greatest need for right now is land f.or playing fields. I~ runs against our own history and against the hi~s•tory of other institutions to think that Union College will be an en- ~erprise of the same shape tomorrow as 1t 1s today. I am convinced that none of us would want it to be so. And be:oause I am convinced of that I am also con- vil;ced ~ha.t t~n~ght, the opening. night of thrs thtrt)T-mllhon-dollar campa1gn is a great night for Union College.

2 Off-..Catnpus Aparttnents Set for January Demise Bavid B. Laird, director of resi- dence progxams, announced in an in- ter\'iew that aiL single Union stmlents who are not either working for their rooms or living with their families will be required to live either in col- lege residence halls or in coHege- affiliated fraternity houses next term. baird pointed out that this policy is an implementation of long-standing coll'ege policy. The difference next ter1n will be that ••rn the first time in many years Union will have the facilities to house all its students.\ Assignments Students currently residing off cam- campus will be ass.igned to rooms in Davidson Hall, which is due for com- pletion before January 3, and which wiH house 260 students. About a month later tesidents of North Col- lege will be moved to Fox Hall, which will hold 256 students. Residents of North College are generally angry at this announcement. They feel that the college should act with more di:spatch in getting them out of an admittedly temporary situation. They are, however, looking forward with great enthusiasm to moving into the new residence halls. Laird stated two reasons for mov- ing all students onto the campus be- fore transferring the North College residents. First, he cited the strong eommitment the coJilege has made to bring off-campus peo·ple onto the campus. This first re::tson is princi- pally a matter of policy. The second re3.son he cited is the practical re:\son that, \If we don't move those peo.ple in January, the hardships that would develop from some of these move;:; would be complicated and perhaps multiplied.\ He went on to say that i·t would be very difficult to move uhese people into the residenee halls in the middle of a term. Advantages Discussing the advantages of living on campus, Lait·d pointed out that \residen:e halls offer advantages that might not o•therwise be avaHabJe to off-campus students. He enumerated such advantages rs proximity to• the lihrar~· and clnss2·s and the greater tendency of students in residence halls to particip·ate in extra-currku- Iar activities. He said that dormi- tories offer a rare opportunity for students to study both singly and in groups.\ Union's policy is consistent with a natioll!al trend toward dormi- tory living. \Students with few ex- ceptions, would,\ according to Laird, \benefit educationally and so2ially by Varied Events Predict Fun For Fall Weekend Fall Weekend 1966 is upon us, and with it, a number of varied events to suit. every son of Union. On Friday evening, the Union College Stage Band and the Jazz Quintet will perform in Memorial Chapel. The con<!ert, the first this year, is scheduled to begin at 7:30, and is free to both Union 'Students and the general public. \Eight Mil~s High\ by the Byrds, and Miles Davis' \So What,\ are among the selections to be performed by the Quintet. Following the concert, many of the fraternities plan to hold house :parties. Nine brotherhoods will have open parties, with live bands and beer on tap. Many fraternities. though, in an effort to keep out troublemakers, l1ave decided that ·stags won't be welcome at the p·arties. Variety of Events On Saturday afternoon, we .are pitted against Alfred on the gridiron at 1:30, and then take on St. Lawrence at 2:30 in soccer. Follo\ving a break for dinner and perhaps a privat~ cocktail.party at one of t~e fraternities, the Jfour To~s will perform at 8:00 m Memorial Chapel. Accordmg to Larry Pedow1tz, Presi- dent of the Sophomore Class, the concert is sold out. «We would like to see all Union students wearing jackets and ties in the Chapel,\ Pedowitz added. After the concert, the fraternities will again open their doors. Fourteen houses plan open parties, with freshman and upperclass independents welcome to partake of the festivities. And lastly, a reminder for those that are interested: The Rathskellar w:iU be open until midnight on Friday, from 5:00 until TTiidnight on Saturday, and from 1:00 until midnight on Sunday. IFC Financially Adopts Greek Girl A young Greek girl, Soultana Kam- basakalis, was financiai'ly adopted by Union's Inter-Fraternity Council. The Save the Child Federation se- lected Soultana, and will help her ob- tain an education with funds con- tributed by the I.F.C. Childhood Tragedy Soultana comes from a farming family of seven whose total income is between $900 and $1,100 dollars per annum. In Greece, it cos\s ap- proJCima:tely $27 per month to send a student to secondary school. With- out help it would have been impos- sible fo; So.ultana to continue her schooling. The Director of the Greek Field Service, Mrs. Theodora J. Pan- to.s sa:w that it was essential for So~ltana to have the hope for the future, which learning could offer, be- cause the little girl had become des- pond·ent and introverted after a child- hood tragedy which necessitated the amputation of her left arm. All who were concemed hoped that the atmos- phere of a girls school, the separation from her past, and the opportunity to look ahead would bring new hope to Soultana. · Remarkable Progress In the most recent letter telling of Soultana's progress, Mrs. Pantos ex- tols the change in the girl's attitude as excepti01ual. Sh~ has maintained very high grades· and ha.s an excellent chance ·Of being acce{}ted at a colle-ge or universi-ty next year. SouJ.tana ex- pressed a .sincere desire to bec.ome \a student of higher education\ in a note of appreciation which the Council re- ceived recently. Can it still happen here? As long CIS Pres. Martian isn't awakened too often. being residents of the col·lege com- munity.\ Laird minimized tlte financial C()ll'- sideration involved in bringing stud- ents D'Thto the campus. He contended that, we would fill the new halls re- gardless of financial consider!lltions. The residence halls were not planned to make money for the C()llege, Students CUlTently residing o:ff cam-. pus will .shortly receive a lebter from Laird explaining procedures .to be followed in signing up for r()olus in Davidson Hall. They will be ex- pe~ted ·to chose their suitemates irom others currently living off-campus. North College residents will be mov- ed into Fox Hall as soon as it is completed. Two fraternities, Beta Theta Pi and Kappa Alpha, are to move into Da- vidson Hall on Janua:ry ~ if the;re jg room for them. Dean 0. Edward Pol- lock explained that while he would like to move them as soon as possi- ble, he is obligated to give those moving from off-campU:S priority. Ga .. n~l Sial~;~ November 14, 15, 16, and 17 have been scheduled fo1• shooting of senior pictures for the 1967 Garnet. The photography will be handled by Merin Studios, In~. of Philadelphia, Pa. One evening session will be scheduled if needed to accommodate those stud- ents who cannot attend a day seS:Sion. lVIerin Studios have promised special service to those seniors who want to order pictures for graduate school or as Christmas gifts. Merin Studios has previously contracted for year- book picture work at such schools as Boston University, Cornell and An- napolis. Pix at West Independent students must sign up for pictures at the Student Activities office by Tuesday, November 8. Fra- ternity members will be contacted at their houses. Pictures will be tal(en in the small dining room at West Co liege. Later announcements can be found in Concordiensi's RELAX!

The motiOn was tabled until the next meetmg. A suggestiOn was made by Grady Aronstamm that a survey be devised to look into ·student apathy and opinion. Further discussion was postponed. Da,lrymple Cites Need Before Sex For Thought By .BARRY NEWMAN Freshmen at Union College, as part of their orientation program, heard the Dil·ector of Studen.t Medical Ser\ vices a't Princeton University dis·cuss the problems of 'Sexual f:reed<>m for the single man in a required lecture Thursd.ay. Dr. Willard Dalrymple urged the students to thinl{ carefully aJbout the rnean1ng that prema1·ital sex holds fo:r them, calling sex \one of the most powerful forces in life\ and worthy of tempered consideration. Dalrymple st:rP\\'lerl the need for \'consistency in life.\ Most college students, lie ·said, are uncertain about the nature and meaning of sex, and may find them.seJves plunging into deep psychological distu:riJ.ances if they act without fully understanding their own convictions and mores. Sex as Psychology The physician for students at Prince- ton said sex is a psychological as well as a physical matter, and \psycho- logical health .cannot exist where the individual does not feel comfortable wi:th himself. To ignore such pat- terns is to court psy·ehological disas- ter.\ An article by Dalrymple appeared r3cently in the Princeton Quarterly trea:thg the subject of co:leg-iate sex. 0. Erlward Pol 1 ock, De,an of Students :1t Unicn, read the studv and asked the Ewt'·m to enlighten Union stud- ents c\J<ncerning misconcepti(}ns wh!ch frequently cause prob)ems. Frosh Eager Pollock said there is \an appalling lack of factual information concerning sex on tni.s campus. Freshmen are compelled ·to attend becaul'e their problem is the greatest, but I know many upper classmen need more fac- twal illiformatton/' The Freshmen were apparently eager to learn. They greeted Dalrym- ple \like a fo()~ball ,team\ with cheer·s, not simply aPplause. He refused, howeve1·, to \give any definite anSowers\ concerning the mor- ali-ty ·of pre-marital sex. He urged hi:s audience to read a good marriage manual, and dedde for themselves how to treat a deHcate moral problem. Most students, he said, feel pressured ·by the demands of their peers for demonstrations of sexual experience. The Princeton doctor discounted such unfounded demands, and asked stud- ents to follow their own \feelings and controls\ and ignore \prevailing behavior <>f others in their subcul- ture.\ Contraceptives Required Dalrymple said that if a studerrt finds he is emotionally capable of carrying on a rewarding e::x:tra-mari- tal re}a:tionship, he should inform him- self completely abowt contraception. \Sexual activity without the use ()f contraception,\ he said, \is irrespon- sih:e behavior because of the conse- quences of unwanted pregnancy.\ The co 1 lege health service, Dalrym- ple asserted, should provide students with birth cor:trol in:ormation, but should leave th.e obtaining of devices to the individual. \A college,\ he said, \doesn't have to provide a loca- tion for premarital sex, but sihould encourage thought on the matter.\ Dalrymple doubted that abortions wou d be legalized in the \foresee- able future\ in the United .States. He called them only a step away fr()rn infar.ticide. Mountebanks Tryout The Mountebanks, Union College's' theatrical society, will hold tcyouts on Monday and Tuesday, November 8th and 9th, for their first produc- tion of the season. Professor William Merriwether will direct Ben Johnaon's play, \The Alchemist.\ This comedy of manners will be perfor;ned during the week of FE>Jbru- ary 7-11.

Of these, Roosevelt and Adams have ~ittle chance of gaining more than protest votes, although m the case of the .former these may reach nearly to the mililon mark. Frank O'Connor has served as a lackluster member of the state legislature, since then reversing his stands on s~ver:U issues. He. has served as a highly competent D1stnct Attorney m Queens and an unassuming City Council President. Nothing in the record made in these offices suggest that the man has the capabilities to be New York's chief executive. In additio:p, his connections with the big city political bosses raises questions as to his freedom of action. Even without firm proof of what the connection is, the office he seeks is too imp~~n~ to take the chance that these g~n­ erally unsavory mdiVIduals will have any power over the governor's office. . . Gov~rnor Rockefeller has done a competent, if not !n- spmng, Job as governor during the past eight years. Most significant has been his work in higher education. Tile new campus at Albany State (and its transformation from a s~eepy teacher's colle~e to a high-powered modern univ~r­ sity! and the Regent s Scholar:ship program are eloquent testimony to his concern. His work in enacting slum clear- ance prop-ams, his willingness to take the unpopular st~nd of enactmg a broadbas~d tax (even if it was later than it sho~ld have peen) , attd his record of consistent wqrk · agamst the e~tremists in the national Republican Party also speak well for him. Several bfack spots mar his recorq, including his blat- anti~ partisan' handling of reapportionment and his s11pport of aid to parochial schools. But on the whole, his record has been progressive and a good one for New York. Concordiensis, therefore, endorses Nelson Rockefeller for governor. Fpr Congress During tQ.e sullltt)er a member of the Co~cordiensis staff interviewed Ricl\ard Conners, Democratic candidate . for Congress fl:'om the ~bany.Schenecta.dy district. As~ed what he had a,ccorq.plisijed during his long years in Alb.liny politics, he sa~d that aU credit must go to the Mayor. He could think of no acconj.plishments of his own. . ' Button is i a J~r ~erent sort of candidate.. EJJ:ecutive editor of the Albany TUnes-Union, he is an intelligent and articulate exponent of moderate Republicanism. . Albany h•s P,o~ a Republican representing it in ~n­ gress for ove~ fQrt~ years. During this time~ the Deroo- cratic party has built up a machine that is nearly invincible at the polls. The ~ach~e has also been impreyiou,a, to the winds of change. ~nd ~as shoWn itself totally lacking in the initiatives that might make Albany a livable city. In Washington, Conners would act, no doubt, as he has in Albany, obeying the voines that come from on high. Button would be an independent, voting his own conscience.· This is, we feel, a good basis of voting and Concord- iensis hereby endorses Daniel Button for Congre$. Thursday, November 3, 1966 Letters to the Editor Creak's Code To the Editor: Evet• since I come to Union I been t'eading the rag you call a newspaper and I sent a copy home to my mommy and even she said that it is not the s<>rt of decent literature that a fi.ne 19th century institution like Union is should be print- ing and she told me that I should tell you that I am not going to look at this cor- rupting rag which will turn my soul against itself and furthennore aga-inst aU that I hold dear and holy and saintly and pure and I would like you t{) know this because obviously you have not found the .chosen way because otherwise you couldn't want tl1ings like free press and freedom of opinion and go around telling people to violate wives and daugh- ters as being a generally immoral in- fluence on the young .and 'silly-putty of ~his here place which . will never regain rts sense of :honor until you and all you stand for are dl.'iven from the campus and burned at the stake where you will leam that you should never question the wisdom 'of the ages which has come down to us because the ancients knew what wa·s good and you don't so why don't you stop trying to make us think? Sincerely yours, E. Josh Creak Courageous Concordy To the Editor: In his letter to the editor last week, Ken Kobland states, referring to the edi- torial, \Something-\s Missing,\ \I would like to see some specific proposals to some of Union's basic problems.\ In the past year some of these prob- lems have been attacked and corrections in the forms of the new curriculum and .and ·social rnles instituted. But as the editorial says, \the effects of ,these chaPges are still inchoate.\ It •seems to me that in Union's lively and critical self- appraisal of itself, a prime institution on campus, which influences and controls much of student life, has been left un- tainted by this criticism and questioning. I refer to the fraternity system. Isn't it about time that President Mar- tin, Dean Lockwood, Dean PollQck and others of the administration, the faculty, and most important of all the student body-, undertake an objective apprai'sal of the desirability or undesirability of the frate~nity systems and its contributions and place in the ever-quickening and ever-changing pace of American society. An investigation into this semi~sacro­ scant and up to now \sovereign\ insti- tution i's clearly in order. The fact that two-thirds of Union's student bodv is as- sociated with some aspects of the fra- ternity system and many Qthers indirect- ly influenced by the attitudes which 1low from it justifies an inquiry into it. I think that the college as a whole in for- mulating its long range plan:;; ought to be asking itself, \If a suitable alternative to the fraternity could be found and planned fQr, would it lead t<> a more viable student Ii:t'e?\ Concurrently, an inquiry should be made into the inde- pendent's position at Union.

SHAKER VILLAGE SKI GROUP quiries, whatever the results, could pos- sibly bring to the attention of ~11 why \something's missing\ at Union College. At this time, I would also like to com- pliment the editor of the Concordiensis for his outstanding writing this year. The fact that hi's editorials have been at.. tacked, as Lance Polya states in a letter to him, does not diminish their quality, The fact that the editorials are not \.ju- dicious, meaningful, and truly refl.eetive of campus. feeling\ is probably true for some, but that fact does not diminish their quality, and the fact \that editorials are so swayed by one man's opinion, that they often lost their revelancy to l'eal campus issues and become merely a con- venient mechanism for the editor-in-chief to resound on his oiffieial views\ still does not diminish their usefulne'Ss. Could it be that th.e editor in showing so much courage in expressing his views is ahead of his time ? Or Gould tt be that Lance Polya and his peers are j11st expressing a symptom of why \Something's Miss- ing.\ Whatever the answer, the editor sees the need to raise hr).portant issues (and they a1·e important issues) to the atten- tion of Union's community. Any review board that is proposed can only stifle .the controversy, which even attaeker Polya sees as good, that our editor seeks to generate and from which the college will benefit. On the other hand, if a review board becomes a reality, no-t only will we be sacrificing freedom of speech, but also the spirit that made thl) . gains of the pa~t . Yell;r possible and alw the gains which will naturally folloW from it in the future. J obn Berger '68. Concordy Criticized To the Edito:r: Last spring, as an accepted applicant to Union, I received a notice informing me as to the Concordiensis' existence. In effect this note stated that the paper would \praise what was worthy and damn what needed to be damned.\ Al- though it has done much 0of the later it has failed to employ the former to ~ny great extent. This has been done for only two rea- sons that I can observe: 1) there is no~hiD;g praiseworthy .at Union, or 2) the edrtoi'!al board here possesses a warped perspective of this campus' life. Having now worked as a member of the sports staff for the past four weeks I think I can say that it m1.1-st be th~ latter. I ?ase this opinion upon my en- counter With both the editor-in-chief and the sports editor. Examples of the Concordy's criticism are known to all of us,. but few have seen the way in which the sports depart- ment has been mismanaied. After view- ing this I can understand why there was a request ·sent ou~ for reporters, and why few beckoned to xts call. There definitely should be a new attitude expressed in the paper to return it to the fame it once possessed. If, on the otherhand, the editors, upon reviewing their evaluations can still find nothing praiseworthy at Union, might I suggest that they consider transfering to another school more suited to their needs. Sincerely yours, Jonathan Sax '70 Candidate To the Editor: I ~ould like to introduce my-self as a candidate for the offiee of President of the Class of 1970. My purpose i.r:t writing this letter is to acquaint the freshman class with tnY goals. · In the coming year I would like to see the institution oif a newsletter for the das•s Q~ 1970; For a class to fnnction SlUe-. cessfully, knowledge of the actiVities O'f the student government is of prime im- po.rtanc~.

Some sharp tongues define \mugwump\ as a political animal with his ''mug\ on one side of the fence, his \wump\ on the other. Clearer heads claim it a stamp of independence. The definition and corporate stance Western Elec- tric takes is strictly nonpartisan. But nonpartisan as WE must be, we recog- nize that, to be an effective citizen, the indi- vidual must become a political partisan. And it means being more active than just showing up at the polls. So we do our best to encour- age our 170,000 people to express their political leanings ~ in what~ver direction. We do it by sponsoring a \Democracy in Action\ program that takes no sides, but explores all angles. WE people -white collar, blue collar - lead it. Long before elections, courses are given at WE locations. Back- ground subjects it;lclude such Soc. and Eco. considerations as -The Persistent Problem of Unemployment ... The Negro's Long Struggle ... America's Balance of Payments. Booklets are handed out that answer questions like: \How can I get started in politics? How can I use my talents to serve my party?\ Before elections, Back Your Party rallies are held. Bunting and posters hung. Politi- cians from both national patties are invited to speak. A dialogue develops. Thousands of WE people participate. It stirs up their political juices. Helps make thern better informed, ergo: better citizens.

REAL NEWS·· Pages 2 & 3 .. C.oncordy Sports Garnet Scare Favored Ephmen, 27-12; Face Alfred For Fall Weekend Sat. By LEN Sil\lON A supreme effort aH for naught? Not really. Though the Garnet football team saw its mark dip to 1-4-1 with a 27-12 loss to undefeated Williams, they showed them- selves to be a proud team, not willing to be written off under any circumstances. Saturday they face Alfred at home as part of the Fall Weekend festivities. The Ephmen ::;trolled onto Alexander Field as a 3 or 4 touchdo\\'n favorite on the strength uf their fine 3-0 n~nml. Hight frotn the opening kiek- off the Gamet \\'el'e flying high-battling for every inch. Amazingly the Garnet led at the h·alf, and tt-ailed by only 1 point going into the final period of play. Then, a Garnet team worn down by the heavier· and more frequently rested visitors, gave up 2 .Sl'ores a::; Williams put the game on ice. Early Score Coach Flood's charges seo1·ed the fit•st time they had the ball, taking the opening kickoff and driv- ing 80 yards for a !jcore. The running of Joe James who had 121 yards for the game, and sev- eral short passes from Bob Utecht to Sam Dill, sparked the drive. The score came when Jim Ramich entered the game fm· the first time and tossed a 21-yard TD pass to Joe Grabowski. The extra point by Chris Cassels split the uprights but a penalty nullified it, and the subsequent kick was a little wide. The WiHiams offense finally untt'acked itself and sustained a 61-yard touchdown drive, .scoring on a 24-yard fourth down pass fmm George Can- non to Bob Quinn. Mark Winick added the extra point and Williams led, 7-6. Moments later Union received a punt on their own 18 yard line and began an 82-yard drive. Keeping the ball on the ground, the Garnet drove to within a foot of p.aydirt where James dove over for the score. A 2-point conversion attempt failed, and the score stood at 12-7. On the ensuing kickoff Randy Dygert gral>bed Lhe ball and returned lt 80 yards. He appeared headed for a touchdown, bU!t .Steve Roehm caught up to him and drove him out of bounds at the 15. Don DeMichele then came up with the defensive gem of the game, picking off a pass and ending the threat. Thousands look on as wingback Joe Grabowski gets his fingers on ball in contest with Williams. Not to be denied by a single point again, as they had been by Hobart, the Dutchmen again drove deep into Williams territory. However a costly holding penalty hm-t the Garnet, forcing them to abandon their slow deliberate drive and try for long yardage plays. Williams took over on downs. easy, and meaningless score. Jim Dunn put the game on ice, scoring from the 2. The Union performance was nothing to be ashamed of, ·and Coach Flood's comment was, \I am pleased with the effort of the team. The thing that worries me is the people being happy with a loss.\ He cited the outstanding offensive play of James, Dinn, and Utecht, who improved his pass- ing tremendously, and a fine effort by the whole offen·sive line. Jim DeNitto, Don DeMichele, and Sam Dill played nearly 60 minutes of football.

Student Body Eager To Know Truth By DA~DY HAXDSOME Rumors were running rampant and spreading like wildfire over the Union Col- lege campus when word leaked out that the Dutchmen were going \big time\ in football. The consensus seems to he that it might occur in one of several forms. Fil·st, the Garnet might add such perennial Eastern grid powers to their schedule as Haverford or Worcester Poly as has been done recently by a:r~other Eastern p~wer­ house. Then too, there was word that P1·es1dent M·artin would ask for 16 million dollars for ath- letic scholarships. Also there was talk tha.t Uuion would try to lure such stars as Gary Behan, Terry Hanratty, Jim Seymour, Bill Bradley, Earl Mor- rall and Richmond Flowers to play foi' the Gar- net.' One of the stronger rumors _circulating was that V nion would try to get et.ther Ara P~r­ seghian, Bear Bryant, Duffy. Daugherty or Wil- liam Miller to coach here. Fmally the word was out that the Big Ten, in an effort to regain past glorie>~, would drop Ohio S1;.~te from tbe confer- ence and ask Union to join as a new member. This is ohviously an a~tempt to move past the h·y League> in football prestige. Seeki·ng to gain some in~ight into the issu~s, this reporter put the questiOn to the people m- volved, and x·eceived some startling and revealing answers. First, President Martin stated that there was no truth what-so-ever to the malicious gossip that he wanted a fund of 16 million dollar's for athletic endowments. In stating his rebuttal as such, he left the door open to the fact that he might want a diff~rent amou:nt. of aid. When. I questioned the .v!lrtous athletes !nvol~ed, surpris- ingly, and susplClously, they reJJhed With the same answer: \I am happy where I am and would never con·sider transfering!\ I then contacted Bear, Duffy, Ara, and B.M. to clear up the coaching question at Union. They all replied in the same way, purposely avoiding the issue by stating \Where's Union?\ I finally saw Messrs. Retz and Flood who stated: \There is no truth to· these rumors.\ Coach Flood added that there i'S no truth to the rumor that Union would accept a bid to the Finger Bowl. Since I had not asked anything about the \bowl\ issue, I could tell that this was a slip. It seems to me that the student body of Union deserves to know the answers. We want the truth. It is time for the people involved to give us the real facts. Do You Re1nentber This One? By SINISTER SU~DA Y These are the real facts of Union sports: The physical fitness tests are being revised. A student must now pass seven proficiency tests and score at least 450. Spastics and double-jointed in- dividuals are automaticaly eliminated. If. a stu- dent fails the tests, however, he can retalwte by administering a similar exam to the coaches .• If a majority of coaches and students flunk, phys1.cal education will be cancelled f-or that semester. R.O.T.C. will then be made compulsory. Union College admitted thirty-nine brawny damsels last year, hoping to put together a crack field hockey squad that would take down all small men's \jocks\ in the East. When two alumni i_n- terviewers were seduced, however, and one girl hit the admission director, the excitement petered out. Most of the girls went to Russell Sage where they, evidently, could get more of what they want.

Without this our talk is wasted,\ said Jonathan Pearson III, Union Col- lege's director of admissions recently. Implementing this idea, the adm'is- si()ns offices of Union, Skidmore, and RPI cooperated this week to sponsor a high school guidance counselot•s con. ference. The conference was attended by counse}Grs from schools throughout New England and the Midd~e Atlantic states. The counselors began arriving in S·aratoga Springs during late Tuesday • Tbey were· g-uests at a cocktail party given to Skidmore Pre·sid$nt J(Jseph P.alamountain, Jr. that e'Vening. The next rn 0:rnihg they toured the campus and met w'ith members of the college com.mun:lty. At Union Later they had a luncheon at Sche- nectady's Hotel Van Curler before go- ing . to Union. CocktaiLs were served at Dean Lockwood~s .horne from 6 to 7 p.m. fQli~wed by dinner at Hale House. Afterwards the counselors met with student groups from Union, Skidmore, and 'R.P .I. A ·similar program followed at R.P.I. Thursday aftexnoO'll. The pl'ogram was arranged .so that the couns.;>lors would spend about one half day on eaeh cam1ms. One dis- tinctive .feature of the program was a panel discusison by the counselors, Union students, and high school stu- dents about the various .aspects of th€ college. The Union students on the panel were Glenn Quittell, John Geer, Andy Kadak, J.Vlark Cullings, Hunter Louis, Benjamin Volinski, and George Gates. · A conference to acquaint high school guidance counselors with a college is not UJJique to Union.

Financial Motives· Denied For Dorms, By ALAN KLEIN Dale F. Timberlake, Comptroller, denied Tuesday that finances had !l role in the decision to move off-campus residents into Davidson Hall llefore residents of North College are mo\Ved. He stated, \To the best of my knowl- edge, the order in which. students are to be rnov:ed into the new dormitories i's based on the long-stand.ing coUege policy that s~udents are to live on t?e campus and 1s not hasoo on hancial considerations!' The .POlicy is to whic.h Timberlake referred is expressed by the repeated pronouncements of the colleg-e that all :students are to live on cam:pus, UJJle$s excljsed by the Dean of Students. It was in -order to impJe.ruent this policy that the new dormitories were built. g HHFA . \;_ ~ University Expansion Studied _The .dorn~i't6t-.J~ ~ere constru. cted w1th a rnortg~ msured by ,the Hous- ing and Home Finance Agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Develop-ment. The siiipul~tiorrs of the mortg~ge require that the HEFH- financeil buildings be occupied before the college assigns 'Students to other residenee halls. Ric:Qmofld House was built with a similar m()rtgage. Timberlake estimated that it would be seve:ral years bef01·e the new resi- dence hall~ are self-sustaining. He es- timated that for the period from Jan- uary t() June, 1967, the expenses of running- the buildings will be $158,589, .and that the income from the build- ings wi!l be $105,600. By CARL ENGLEHARDT This year will be a crucial one in deciding the future of Union Univer- ;u;y, wnich, aithoug-h a university on paper, is .something short of this, ~ .. :;A;~t. For many ;vears, Union University k·s been an ano:noly in that it does ;:pt conform to the usual close-knit structure characteristic of most uni- versities. Consisting 0:f the separated units of Albany :Medical Colle~e, Al- bany Law School, Albany School of }harmacy, The :Pudley Observatory and Union College; the University has a profes·s~onal· and graduate level en- rollment of o-ver six-hundred students. The seventeen gradlfate students on the Union ColJege :Qampus however, ar~ not ewsily distinguished as such. The inherent' lack of Wlity has lecj. to the (!OJ;ld1~ion whereby our profess'onal J}.r.ograms are almost en. tirely divorced ftQom the unified struc- tti~e which should constitt1te a healthy university. /nterrelajion of Fac11lties According t6 \Theodm·e D.

In Jan- uary ·af this year, the Northeastern New York Philharmonia, a profes- sional chamber o,rchestra of 17 mem- ·bers was formed. Both orchestras have already won high acclaim for tr.e ex- cellence of their performances and t!~e range of their repertoire. Prof. Curtis said recent~y that \for. mation of the stu·dent orchestra repre- :3ents .a unique experience for mu· ~icians of high schoQl and colleg-e age. For the profesisona.l orchestra p!.ayers in the ·area, the Pbilharmonia represents for the first time a season of continuous a.sso~iations in rehears- als and concerts on a scale that is ge'1uinely profeSisional.\ The college is contributing much to the support of these o•rchestras. The student orchestra :uses the -college's rehearsal rooms and profes~s;.onal of- fice staff.

The first paymen-t on this interest was made on Dctober 1, this y:ear. The next pay- ment fpr .an identical arnount is due April 1. 1967. Since the dormitories were n~t bringing in rent on Octoher 1, the (!ollege found it necessary to capitalize the first interest payment. 'This increased the \book cost\ of the buildings. In 1968 t.he college will be- gin pay-ments on the principal. Rent for a four-m.an .suite in Fox or DavidsO>n Hall is $15() ·per man per term. A ·single room costs $170 per term. If all 40 singles and 116 suites in the two halls are filled, the college should collect $59;000 in rent each term.

In addition to the regular re- hearsals of the two orchestras which are open to all students, the Glee Club, Madrigal singers, Brass Choir, and the W·oodwind Quintet all hold weekly rehears- als open to students. Federal Grant In May of this year the Col- onie Board of Education spon- sored an application for a grant from the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welf.are under Title III of the Elemen- tary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The approval of the $31,000 grant made possible the scheduling of 30 concerts in 11 surrounding counties for the two orchestras. This September the grant was approved. Young audiences will especi- dly enjoy having a full orches- tra of their own contemporaries, · while adult audiences should find the student orchestra equally exciting.

The equipment in them could operate unattended for ten years or so, but for a problem. The many electric motors in those offices needed lubrication at least once a year.

As yet, no organization has been chosen to distrihute the toys. \We're Surwey Shows.· High Grades Do Not Guarantee Success ('CPS)-There see111s to be no direct relationship between high grades in college and professional success in lat- er life, two recent studies indicate. Dr. Eli Ginzberg, a New York re- searcher, studied a group of Columbia UnivE>rsi.ty graduate students who had won fellowships to the schools betv.:een 1944 and 1950. Ginzberg's task was to find out how successful the 342 stu- dents had become 14, yearn after they completed their fellowships. Results of Findings That findings showed that those who had gr~duated from Cl)l]ege with hon- ors, who had won scholastic medals or who had been elected .to Phi Beta Kap- pa were more likely to be in the lower professional performance levels th.an students who had :not distinguished themselves while ill college. Another Survey In another survey-, a team orf Uni- vel·sity Utah profesors found that there is almost no relationship be- open for suggestions,\ Duto noted. \We'll choose an organization that is already repairing and' distributing toys, and they can distribute our toys with those that they have worked on.\ Any members of the college com- munity who would like to donate old toys, or do repair work in his spare time, should contact Mr. Duto at the Maintenance Building. With a reason- able amount of par,ti<lipation, this pr:oj- ect can become a rneaningful yearly goodwill effort, sponsored by the main.- tenance department, and sunported by the entire college community. tween the grades a medical stude:nt gets and his later performance. This finding's startled the leaqer of the research team, Dr. Phillip B. Price. He called it \a shocking finding to a medical educator like myself who has spent his professional life selecting applicants to medical school.\ • He added that the study caused htm to question the adequacy of grad~s not only in selecting tho~e who should be admitted ,to medical s<;hool but a:l• so in measuring a student's progress. Numerous Theories There are numerous theories at· tempting to explain these surpri'sing findings. The most com~on one af. firms that the over-emphasts on grades which begins when a student is in jUll- ior high school and continues through· out his academic career tends to de- stroy interest in learning for leal\ll- ing's sake .

., 4 lhursdcty, November 10, 1966 Thursday, i NEW ENGLAND FESTIVALS: CULTURE FOR THE SUMMER~ ' \ By ASHLEY DAVIS Summer in Schenectady proves the old saw: Go East, young music and drama lover. The Berkshires are covered with festivals, and Stratford, Connecticut and Marl- boro, Vermont have noted contributions in that field, too. Lenox, Mass. is the horne of the grandpappy of Music Festivals: Tanglewood, sum- mer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Situated on a magnificent 210 acre estate overlooking Lake Mah- keenac., the shell is a huge the- ater capable of seating over 6,000 people. The spacious }awns can seat many more. Under the able direction -of Erich Leinsdorf, the BSO pro- vides weekend concerts that an fine, if somE>what -cnnservative, program~ with excellent mu- sicianship. During the week, the festival offers performances of Jess popular music, and this is one of the strongest segments nf the entire program. The Berkshire Music: Barn, also in Lenox, and the nearby Jacob's Pillow in Lee provide othel.' forms ·of music. Tl1e former was the seat of Sunday night jazz and Satur- day afte-rnoon folk concerts. Among the perfo1mers were Josh White, .the Lovin' Spooniul, Dave Brubeck and The Byrds. Dance Festival Tl1e latter is the home of Ted Sha\vn's famous dance festival. Established on a shoestring in 1931, it has grown and pros- pered to such an extent that The ;.'<ew York Times called it one of \the most important o.f our na- tive cultural institutions.\ One of the most glittering musical festivals is the one at Marl·boro College. With artistic director Rudolf Serkin and with the services of Pablo Casals, Schmuel Ashkenazi (who also performed at Tanglewood), Jaime Laredo and Herman Busch, to name just a few, this Jazz Workshop: The First Set The Union Co.Iege Jazz Workshop prese.nted the Con- <'ert Jazz Band and the M.odern Jazz Ensemhle for its first con- cert of the season. The quintet played an exeel- lent set, with the musicians .performing well. All exhibited g!'eat emotion and skill. Special mention sh()uld be made -of trom- bonist Frank Darmiento's solo on \Green Dolphin Street,\ Mike Penna's lyrical bass solo on Miles Davis' tune \So What,\ and Ron Powell's sensitive d!'umming. Star Soloists The star Roloists, howevel', were tenm·ist Dirk Poccia and pianist Cliff Sa fane. Porria played excellently on all f<Jur ol' the quintet's numbers. He was especially good on \So What.\ During one part of his solo, the rhythm section dropped out, leaving Poccia on his own. The tenorist responded to the chal- lenge, by producing some Yery moving, lyrical musical lines in which he employed a crying- like s-ound tha.t resembled a human voice. Safane played exceptionally well. too. Like Poccia, his most impressive solo was on uso What.\ The pianist attacked the ·piano rather than playing it in the more conventional man- ner. Arll!ls and legs seemed to be flying everywhere. Single n01tes and \sheets of sound\ poured out of the piano in all sorts of assorted rhythms. Then th·e pianist broke up the audi- ence when he began to play \Hava Nagelah\ during his solo. The big band was the other featured group. I have to admit that I've never especially loved big bands and this band's per- formance didn't change my opin- ion. This is not to say that it didn't play well. Technically, it was very good to excellent. But what it lacked was depth. There was a dearth of feeling present in most of the band's perform- ance that may be due to a lack of familiarity with th~ charts, or the lack of band experience. Another problem was the ar- rangements which it played. Most of them sounded trite and corny. John Lewis' tune \Djan go\ was completely ruined. \Cookin\' by Ralph Mutchler was a series of worn into the ~Tound funky clichees. Admittedly it is difficult to find decent big band arl·.ange- r:ents, h:1t thE' point is that they can be had. Tad Dameron hJs written some excellent charts. So h-a.s Glenn Osser, €S- pecially his arrangeme!l!t of Dizzy Gillespie•s tune \Groovin' High.\ Lack of Soloists The Concert Jazz Band also showed a lack of good soloists. Except for an exc:el-lent solo hy T1·ombonist Frank Darmiento llll \C'ookin Tenor Dicl< Poe- cia on \Diggin and altoist Paul Kaprowski on \You're My Tllrill,\ the solos sounded me- chancial, stiff, and sometimes corny. Considering the f.act thrut Darmiento and Poccia will be graduating this year, the band hoo better find some good solo- ists. One can get ti-red of listen- ing to ensembles with an occa- sional lack-Ju~ter solo thrown in. One shouldn't get the im- pression, however, that bhe band is completely bad. On the con- trary, they have some very strong points going in theit· fa- voJ'. They have an excellent trombone secti-on and excellent musical techniques. An:d their cli·Uinrrter, Tony Woods,. shows great promise. He really drove the band during its ]>!lrform- ance and with a little more ex- perience, he really should he excellent. Poor Emceeing One last note about the band. It would be to their adva.ntag>e to find an announcer who knows what he is talking about. What passed for emceeing - Friday night bo1·dered on the ludicl'Ous. If therE' is any one thing which detracted from the concert, it was having the announcer come out on stage and put on his lit- tle hippy routine, when it was quite obvious that he didn't !-mow what was going on. Such behavior is reserved for teeny- boppers. It has no place at a serious concel't. The Union College Jazz Work- shop deserves much praioo for their efforts. If it was.n'l{; fo:r them, jazz would be complete!~ dead on this campus. Such a state would be a shame, for the c<Jmbination sponkinuity and emotional involvement of the music is very rarely found else- where. It would be nice to see a larger turnout at the group's next concert. Social Rules at Haverford The Student Council of Haver- ford College, Pennsylvania, an- nounced at the end of last month five proposals for changes in thE' student body's constitution. Two of the proposed changes deal with the organization and purpose of the campus Honor System. Under this system, which is based on proper con- duct, all students mus•t work collectively for campus decency. Conflict The proposed article for the enforcement of the Honor Sys- tem reads: \The student who be- Heves his actions to be in con- flict with the principles of re- sponsibility and respect inherent in the Honor System shall im- mediately discuss the matter with a member of the Students' Council. Should a s·tudent believe the actions of an()ther to be in conflict wtih the Honor System, he sh~ll immediately discruss the matter with the student con- cerned. If after discussion either student finds said action to be in possible conflict with the Honor System, the student whose -ac- tions are in question shall bring the matter to a member of Stu- dents' Council wihtin a week. After a week the responsdbility for bringing the matter to a member of Students' Council rests with each student awa1·e of the actions and involved in the discussions.\ ~Another proposal would elim- inate .all time limits with respect to women guests. It reads: \Specific time limits are incon- sistent with the principle of in- dividual responsibilty nherent in the Honor System. However, keeping a woman guest over- night may fail to show proper respect for the woman guest or the College community. There- fore, a!lY stJtdent who keeps a woman gueS!jf\ on campus over- night shall bring the matter to the attention -of a member of Students' Council. Regarding fornication, the Student Council, \feels that sex- ual intercourse is a -breach of the Honor System and therefore every act of sexual intercourse must be reported to Coun-cil as a posstble violation.\ T A 'Conseque to predict. tional and will ·be s~e ions were to the thrc Nam, an4 t-wa. defi,nit 'dent J·ohlii ahead, and possible l't One oi · local d-istl'i1 the Repu:br major defe Dan O'Cor history.

Thursday, November 10, 1966 :5 Button Upends Albany Machine In Startling Upset Two Rocketellers And Beagan Gain 111e Statehouse Ey (:ARI, FEIGENBAUM and ROBERT STOLZBERG 'Consequences of the 1966 ele:::tions are difficult to predict. Amid national trends, there are sec- tional and ,pcr!?onality currents whose influence will ,be s~en unly in later months. Various opin- ions were expressed across the nation in regard to the three m.ajor issues - con·serv~J,tism, Viet N am, anli White Backlash. Possibly the only t'W(} definite outcomes visible are (1) that Presi- 'dent J'Gh!l!=lOn's Great So~iety has a hard· time ahead, and ( 2) the Republioons. have a raft of possible l'resiuential candidates for 1968. conservatism, not necessarily linked with white supremacy, in the south and' west; and a strong backlash to legislation in the Seuth and va1·ied white backlash to Negro riots in the North. Mo1'e important to the Republicans as a pa1ty, was the large number of potential Presidential candidates for 1968. George Romney scored heav- ily in Michigan (CBS awarded him the state with exactly 00% of the vote in.) Charles Percy, .bene- fitting from white backlash and a tragic murder of hi's 21 year old daughter, has built up his stock for some candidate position in 1968. And Ronald Reagan crusherl Pat Brmvn, picking up his and conservatives' hopes for control of the 1968 Con- vention. There is still Nelson Rockefeller, if he wants to spend another 30 mHlion dollars in the effort, and Dick Nixon. The market for candi- dates is thus surfeited, and the big problem for the Republicans will be to pick the man to beat Johnson, if any one ean. The major issue of fo1'eign policy is that of Vietnam. Not many candidates had made it an essential issue, and thus much cannot be deter- mined. But it appears that there was not that much oppo·sltion to the way the Johnson admin- istration is carrying out the war. Joseph Resnik, of New York,. running in a Republican district, wcm in face of a strong GOP opponent and a Peace candidate. The only other instance of anr explicit attitude was in Oregon, where Mark Hat- field, a \dove beat his Democratic opponent for a senatorial seat. But two things must be con- sidered in this race. This is Wayne Morse's home state, and the people are proud of his stand. Sec- ondly and more impottantly the people of Oregon Situated on the West Coast, Oregon is in an ad- vantageous geographical position to reap ahy trade activities should East Asian affairs be set• tled or at least calmed down. To summarize the results of this 1966 election would be mainly to point out the increase of con- servative strength, outside of any party bounds, in spite of the rout of 1964. Vietnam has been a relatively quiet issue. Concern over inflation has not manifested itself yet, .but there is direct evi- dence of white backlash, in certain areas, due to Negro riots and civil rights legislation. The Re- publicans have gained in st1·ength considerably, and they, together with the Conservative Demo- crats, will make it very tough sleuding for any future Great Society legislation. And if they can make John~on look \bad\ enough, one of their big winner::; iu th\) 1966 election::; can ~hoot fur the moon in 19G8. . :~· ' ::. ·\ . .· . .. .-..-..w .... ~.w.<;oh•<.\o'o'_ •••• d,,,,,,n,, ,,,,, . One of the biggest surprises, occurred in the 11 local distl•ict, where Daniel Button, of New York, the Re·publican-Liberal candidate, inflicted the first 111ajor defeat the Albany Democratic machine of Dan O'Connell has suffered in its forty year history.

He said that he hoped that \the inspiration of restless and dissatisfied younger people of the area, in- cluding those who don't consider themselve~ per- manent 1~esidents,\ would aid in bringing good governmept to the area. Unofficial returns showed Button to have garn- ered nearly 100,000 votes to Conners' 85,000. In .Schenectady alone, the margin was 37,000 to 20,000. The most controversial amendment on the state !>,allot was that permitting a state lottery. Due primarily to 3~1 support in New York City, the constitutional prohibition wa's stricken. This was despite the opposition of many political leaders, including GoveThor Rockefeller. GOP Gains plays ·e ' S. Eliot's a The Republicans gained 46 House seats, 3 Sen- ate seats, and seven gubernatorial chairs. But the essential question i's how these gains will influ- ence future developments in both domestic and foreign affairs. the mur- Canter-· in the it doesn't l on the power of The two major domestic questions of the elec- tions were the revival of conservatism and the white back\lash. There is definite evidence that conservatism, among the Republican and Demo- n • cratic parties is increasing in force. and be- quality it 0 le experi- of Reagan won easily in California, and the Con- servative Party in New York threatened to take over the third place on the ballot from the Lib- ' erals. But there is no definite evidence of a na- tion-wide white backlash to recent Negm riot's and civil rights legislation. Progress Setback In the south, the progress and modernation re- cently noted has suffered some setbacks. Even if Lester Maddox loses, the only difference between him and his opponent, \Bo\ Calloway, i's a thin in Schen- ti f and hope you coat of urbane polish. Mrs. Wallace and Georgie continue to defy Alabama constitutional practices. But white supremacy was not victorious or com- plete throtighout the· South. In Maryland Spiro Agnew beat segregationist George Mahon€y. Win- throp Rockefeller beat Johnson in Arkansas. Wories oYer the back-lash in the North were prevelant in the urban areas which had exper- ienced riots, Yet, here too there is no conclu'Sive evidence. l;l.eagan, it is true, won with an implied · platform plank of cdosed housing and white back- las.h. But to what extent this plank attracted voters is not yet known. Many of his votes could have come fro!Xl people who were glad to see the ~ • Old Ranger finally disposed of. Percy b~at Paul Douglas in Illinoi's, and his votes must have been decided, in pa..1't, by the opposition .of recent riots in the Chicago area. s ere The Democrats dropped 10% of the usually strong Catholic votes in Cicero, an area plagued by dem- onstrations and riots. And another indication of a quasi back-lash was the defeat of the civilian review board in New York City. Tired of the crime in New York, and fearful that a: minority- oriented al)d minority-led board could only hinder p()lice. action, the people of New York voted .again'st the board already set up by Mayor John Lindsay. But in Massachusetts, Edward Brooke, a Negro candidate for Senate, won with great enthusiasm among the people. He is the third Negro Senator in the country, and the first except for recon- e~ , struction Mississippi. Thus, domestic_ develop- ments seem to indicate a general strengthening of The Four Tops shown in a relaxed mood, <:onfi- dent after their success at Union. By CARL ROSENSTOCK \Soul\ is a word you can't really put your finger on. . It's a word that mean's different things to different people. If you ·ask one musician wlrat it means, he'll shrug his sh(}ulders and tell you that it's just a feeling. About the only way :to define \soul\ is to say that it's that feeling y.ou get when you want to jump on the .seats and shout and sing along and you f·eel really moved and you sta1·t yellin \that's soul man, that's soul.\ And that is just what the Four Tops had Sattll'day night: SOUL! People were np on their seaJts, tlhey were singing along, they were dancing in the aisles. Everybody felt the rnll!sic and the beat. -- Feeling The sound of the Four Tops is the \Motown Sound.\ All their music, and the music of all the other Motown groups, comes from the Detroit mu- sic factories of Berry Gordy (the cat who owns the entire Motown. sound). The Tops, in an interview after the concert, said that they are very close to the other Motown groups, such as the Su- prem•es, the Temptations, Smokey Robins·on and the Miracles and Martha and the Vandellas. One of them said that \they all live together and work together, so they're real close.\ Mike Trouble Probably the only thing that marred th2 con- cert was the mike trouble and a note of thanks is due to the Roosters who suppjed the speakers so the concert could go on. The really great thing is the Tops didn't become upset and qui.t when the mike's went bad.

British Hypocrisy Reigns In Southern Rhodesia By L. 0. SANNEH ~omething very basic lies at the foot of the Rhodesia problem; it was no cosmic accident or the aberration of an incidental foreign policy. What, briefly, ha·s been Rhodesia's political his- tory that culminated in the historic UDI of No- vember 11, 1965? One fact clearly emerges, name- Ly that UDI (Unilateral Declaration of Independ- •;nce) was a logical outcome of previous. policies of the British Government. From the 1890's, after the suppression of the Ndebele Freedom Uprising by the immigrant whites of South Africa, the Africans were ruled as a conquered race. Then the white immigrants began to flock the country amund World War I. :By 1923, they had cornered the British Government into granting Southern Rhodesia the ominous status of 'self-government.' Just .as at the Vereeniging Peace conference of 1902, setting up the Union of South Africa., Brit- ain affected to quarantee African rights by in- si·sting on an \entrenched clause,\ so also in 1923 Britain theoretically retained the right to inter- vene in Southern Rhodesia whenever African rights were violated. What those rights were was ·anybody's'\'gu~ss-:' In 1961, an all white electorate was dished a Con- stitution by the then Conservative Government that allotted 65 'seats to the Legislature. Of these 15 were to be chosen by the African majority voting on a lower, restricted, and inferior elec- toral roll, separate from the white roll. In the first elections under the spooky constitutional de- vice, the Africans effectively boycotted the elec- tions. (There are four million .A:l;ricans, and 220,- 000 whites.) 'fhe white ext:remists, led by Mr. Winston Field, felt that the incumbent Prime Minister, Sir Edgar Whitefield, was too soft on the Africans. So the Rhodesian Front under Field took over control. Mr. Field was soon to be super- ceded l>y Ian Smith, a puppet of the still more militant white raci'sts. Scandalous Before we go on, a wol'd about the most scan- dalous and dubious political maneuver of modern times- the Federation of Rhodesia & Nyasaland, created in 1953. Its sole aim was to divert the robust economic energy of the then Northern Rho- desia to white-ruled Southern Rhodesia. The Kari- ba D.ain, for example, wa·s so constructed as to make Zambia vulnerable to Southern Rhodesia. The Kariba could have been built on Lake Nyasa, a much vaster body of water than Lake Kariba. when Britain forged the Federation, it did it behind the facade of \partnership and co-opera- tion\ between the races. At the time of the Fed- eration, the number of Afri~ans qualified to vote under Act 27 of 1951 had been curbed consider- ably by doubling the income qualification. Future le!fislation continued to herd the Africans into and 01ral areas, while improving urban centre~:. of white populations where Africans could be ad- mitted only by passes. Only 429 Africans, against 47,553 Euro_p~an~, could v_ote in 1953. Clearly, the case ~or Blitish mterventwn had not arisen. Afri- can rights had not been violated. None had been granted. Britain had conscientiously bequeathed the Afric!'lns to be ruled by the whites under the Conshtut10n of the Federation, which subordi- nated Native Admistration to the Local white Legislature. Law The Native Affairs Act of 1927 placed any known. form of . African leadership under white suzera.mty. Afncan Law became subservient to the white created courts. The local chiefs in no ~ay r~presentative af public opinion, were' set up m a b1-.annual capacity to \discuss\ African prob- lems. 'J}ley were in the pay (}f the white Legisla- ~ure, With the flagrant privilege of being political Impotents. One of the insurance policies the whites took out against possible African rule was to raise the level of literacy tests as voting qualification. They sought not only to stagger the rate of liter- acy amo;llg the Africans, but to see it in a down- ward spiral m,o~em~nt. To do this, out of a bud- get of 221fz m1lhon m 1950 they spent 2\h million on Africans in education, health, and agricultme the bulk of the money going into futile land de~ velopment schemes into which Africans were segregated. Swincl/e What comes out of lJDI is how difficult I have found .to .be moved by.the pathet~c self-prostration of .Br1tam, and a d1splay of mnocent surprise wh1.ch cooler heads could only call hypocrisy. The Umte~ States knew what w~s happening, and when It saw the tragedy shapmg up it began to egg Britai~ ~n to do something about it. Mr. G. Mennen W1lhams said UDI need not have hap- pene(i. Even hefore it did, Mr. Wilson; the \British\ Prime Minister, discounted the use of force abso- lutely, and in so doin·g removed even the threat of th~? ~se of fore~ ~o carry any weight \vith Mr. Ian Smith. _In poht1es th1s was suicide. And we shoul.d do ;v~th Mr .. Wilson what Roman Catholics d~t With SUICides, refuse to bury him-with foz·mal r1 es. f 9 'f f' 'f f V f\ f Y 'f f f f f I f 'f V t T t 'f ¥ t V t V t t 9 ¥ Y '¥\ ¥ 'Y V T Y y ¥ i W 't' TT c· 0 RELAX!

Business .1ianager Abolish ROTC The ideals of the military life are those of discipline and reverence for authority, for unthinking obedience to the orders of superiors and unquestioning acceptance of the right to use force to accomplish one's aims. The ideals of a liberal education a1:1e to further the questioning spirit of the individual, to stimulate him into trying to understand and reason, to use his mind rather than brute force. These ideals are incompatible. To the extent that one is fostered, the other is denied sustenance. And a liberal education is too fragile, too difficult, to foster to allow any- thing to enter the environment which might be deleterious to its growth. Concordiensis feels that the presence of Air Force ROTC on campus presents just such a danger. At present this danger does not seem very great, mani- fested mainly in people strutting around campus in their funny blue uniforms. But its effect is, nevertheless, real though subtle. Perhaps most dangerous is the potential it has to become less subtle. · It is an old story that democracies tend to deny their· democratic ideals to their citizens while engaged in war. We can see this in the present attacks on the rights of those who dare dissent from the American policy in Viet- nam. We can see it in its more virulent strains in the de- portations of the American-Japanese during World War II.· Union College should act now to ensure that this will not take place here. It should close its program in military· training as soon as is humanly possible. And it should do so not only because ROTC can act as an opening wedge to the dangers of militarism .. It should act because to do otherwise is to give its prestige, its in- fluence and its sanction to military training, to training that is antithetical to its educational goals. Union College, in· short, has no business fostering military training. A Way Out? Union College has a policy that it is and should be a \residential college.'' On tne basis of this policy, it is forc- ing a large number of students to move from the apart- ments they have been living in for the past three months and reestablish themselves in new dormitories. Yet, we wonder, is this the real reason? If so, why could not the college wait an extra six months to imple- ment it when it would be less inconvenience to students? It seems a fair conclusion that the real reason the .college is doing this is that it is not interested in absorbing any more of the financial loss than it has already taken. So the stu- dents are being forced to pay. They do not have to live in the dorms, merely pay for them. Be that as it may, Concordiensis disagrees with the philosophy implicit in the rules for off-campus living that nave been enunciated by the college. First, it seems that it is not necessary to have the entire student body (with the exception of the few com- muters and people who work for their room) living physi- cally on campus to have the concept of a residential college fulfilled. Mr. Laird's assertion in last week's Concordy linking participation in campus activities to living on cam- pus is at best a simple assertion, and it seems to have little sustenance in fact. For instance, of the top twelve people in this organi- zation and WRUC, the two largest and most influential campus activities, six live off-campus. This does not seem to indicate a lack of involvement, especially considering the greater numbers of on campus residents. In sum, the sense of community that is the real distinguishing mark of the residential college is not dependent upon where the student sleeps at night. Second, the college does not seem to recognize the need for a heterogenious student body. The advantages of on-campus living that Laird so eloquently speaks of are real and valuable for many students. And these students will voluntarily live in college housing. But many other students, students with real value to the college, neither enjoy nor gain from dormitory living. One need only look at Richmond House to see the sterility that pervades it. The new dorms are a vast improvement to· be sure, but cannot hope to meet the needs of every stu- dent. And those whose needs cannot be met by colleg housing should be given the option to live off if they so desire. Third, in allowing only students living at home or gaining all their housing costs from work, the college is oversimplifying the situation. Coilege housing is expensive. It is doubly so when the added costs of not having a kitch- en are figured in. It is unnecessary and unjust for the college to force the student, any student, to pay more for less. However, if the college, after all this, still feels that it cannot have living quarters standing vacant, there is a way out- how about tearing down the .prison-like build- ing known as Richmond House. This might be a start to- ward the new style of civilized living that President Martin has urged so frequently in the past. Thursd(:ly, November 10, 1966 Letters to the Editor Good Editorials To the Edit'()r: As a forme1· Union College student who transferred in part to get away fro~ petty squabbling, I have been interested in the recent storm on campus concerning Concordy editorial.s and the various pro- posals for an editGrial review board. Ap- pat·ently, \Personal• Propriety\ was a very good editorial, for it did its job: it made pe()ple think. I have always thought that editorials are supposed to take positions and state them forei.bly. A good editorial does this, a bad one does not. Of course, if a strong statement is made for one side of an issue, the other ·side is expected and encounged to get stirred up and reply. A good editorial makes people mad; it starts their minds working; -they begin, perha\})s for the fh'st time in their lives, to thinl1. A bad editorial does nobh- ing like this; it is as bland ·as cafeteria food, as thought-proovoking as a dull profes·sor. If that is --what a good editorial is sup- posed to do, then Concordy has nothing to be ashamed of. The resporuse surprised even a hardtened cynic like myself, who was long convinced that the Union com- muity could never be concerned about anything. Urlfortunately, however, people seem to have gotten ex0ited about the wrong time. Few addressed themselves to the issue. Thf.ost accused the newspaper of being \n()n-objective !}f being dirty, !}f corrupting our young women. These latter objections are, of course, irration- al, but the cry of non-obje0tivity needs to be met squarely. It has long been a p1•inciple of {)Ur society that truth rises out of contr()versy. Concordy has taken a strong stand on an issue. Th.e proper response for ,those who disagree is not to muzzle Concordy, ?ut rather to put forth their own 'opin- Ions. In that. way, and only in that ~y, ghaJ we be able to evaluate the merits of both sides. There have also been some noises about an editorial review hoard. As I under- stand it, advocates of the board cl-aim that Conco1·d:y editorials, using the word \we are in f·act personal s1tatements of the editor-in~ehief. A review board, it is claimed, would nat write editorial.s but would a:<ivise the editor-in-chef on their content. This business ·about the word \we\ seems a little ridiculous. There are hun- dreds of small-town papers in the United States with a staff of one and some- times a few more; the editor discusse.s his editorials with no one (except per- haps his wif-E), hut st:ll uses the word \we.\ I thin:k we should recognize the word \we\ fo1• what it is: a convention, an artifact not nece-ssarily representing a consensus ·of opinion. The most serious objection to the pro- posed board 'is its potential for prevent- ing the editorial from doing its job. I thmk it is to Union's advantage to have an independent student press, for the same reason that it is an advantage in the country at large. Independent jour- nal:sm can recognize no special interest and cater to no pressure gT()Up. Bu.t an editorial review· board w.ill, I think, con- stitute a built-in forum for special in- terests. It seems to be the board will always take ~•propriety\ into account. In other words, the administration members will not wish. to see published anYJthing that damages the name of the ·adminis- tration; the student go:vernmerut repre- sentatives will -wish to keep their names and orgaruization dean; and so on ad nauseum. In shm,t, it seems to me that a review board, no matter what its com- position, will be a damper on the !IJbility of editorial$ to spark consb·uotive con- troversy. And controversy is wha.t a de- mocracy needs to stay alive. I would like to say a brief word about the IFC's newsletter, specifically the comments made by Hunter Louis, the or- ganizatio:n's president. Now, Mr. Louis is a very bright young man, to whom I spoke several times 1ast year while covering stories concerning t:he IFC, but I think him mis•taken in his statemeJJ.t that \People who work for \lJ.e IFC news- paper will get experience in journalism, and this can give the. Pu.blica:ti0Jlls Selec- tions Committee a more dive11se field of candidates from whic·h to choose fu- ture editors of the Concordiensi•s.'' I dispute this theory for one main reason. The IFC publication cann()t by any stretch of the imagination ·be called \journalism.\ It will probably not appear more than once a month. It will cover only fraternity news and other events of interest to fraternity members. H will be mern:eographed, no.t :printed. lt may not have editorials. So its staff will have no experience meetin.g tight dead- lines; coverning general news, sports, or features; battling the pel.\sistent pro- duction headaches of a printed weekly news.paper; or writing .staterneiJ'ts of opinion. In other words, someone with experience on the IFC newspaper will be a:s qualified to be editor ·of Concordy as the pul>lisher of a church newsletter is to take over the New York Times (or even the Schenectay Gazette) . It is com- mon sense that a person must experience the \re·a:l thing\ and not a subs·'itute if he is to know how to do it. For that reas!}n, I agree with Dean Pollock that any effect of the publication on Concordy would, and should, be \incidental.\ Sincerely, Robert A. Fried A Better Concordy To the Editor': At the risk of being re·;..etitive, I think it is fairly obvious that Cancordiensis is being swamped W<th a aeluge o. criti- cism. Among other thing's, the nature of the criticism has included dissatjsfaction with the editorials, inadequate .coverage of campus news, and sports events, and the cliquishness of the newspapers' staff. I would like to offer some positive sug- gestions to the student body on how to make better the state of the Con- cordiensis. First, all improvements in the paper's must come from within, that is, be initiated by the Concordy staff.

'·· • 7 Ski Team Needs Help Union College will again be represented in inter-collegiate ski competition for the fourth consecutive year. Conceived by stu- dents in 1963, but denied funds by the ad- ministration, the ski team received financial support from the Student Tax Committee. Throughout that first year, the team lacked necessary coaching and equip-ment and so was unable to boast an impressive first year record. the Tax Committee for support. Operating with a modest budget and still working for its long sought recognition, last year's racers wiH again be training without a coach. Even without a coach, the team's chance of bringing home a tro- phy is well within reach. Last year, Union missed a third place, and a trophy, because a member of the team missed the start of his third jump and was disqualified. He had to wait for the jumping skis used by another member of the team on a previous jump-only three pairs for five men. Dedication Yet, the sec01nd y·ear, because of the dedication of these self-trained, self-styled competitors, the Athletic Department jncluded the men into its intercollegiate program. Unfortunately, no coach- ing and insufficient on~skis practice made meet viDtories only a dream. Last yea1.·, again with tlH! support of the AthJe,tic Department and holstered by a .strong freshman squad, the team compiled an impressive meet record in its drive to gain the long s-ought after varsity status that ski teams enjoy on many campuses (Cornell, Cortland, and Syracuse to mention only a few). The fifteen member team placed an overall fourth in its eight- tea,m league behind perennial leaders Paul Smiths, SymcuSie, and Cortland (all this without a coach, adequate equipment, or funds). No Svpport No .Recognition The college community has for too long been ignorant of its ski te-am. Surely the stamina to run one a mile cross country course at 20• above zero, the courage to plummet down a mountain side at 50 mph in order to earn a trophy for Union deserves more than a mere pat on the back (even that was seldo\m received). These men must not be made to feel inferior to the other inter-collegiate competitors. This has long been the case but the day is fast approaching when Union will have no recourse but to admit the slders into the ranks of lette1men. '70 Grid Power .. Never underestimate the powf)r of the Union' College freshman football team. After Rochester, with 14 players, was virtually driven six feet under 68-8, .by the '70 gridders, the -school decided to drop freshman foD'tball for the remainder of the sea·son. Th.is year, after a good .showing and much hard work, Union College refuses to support, let alone grant varsity status, to its ski team. Paradox- ically, the \golf team\ newly formed last year and totally untested, was given immediate varsity status. When it was learned that the Athletic Department's budget had been cut and so too the ski team funds, the team once again turned oto St. Lawrence, on the other hand, was honored to have Union on their schedule. When Rochester dropped the Larries, St. Lawrence filled the vac- ·• caney with the Garnet. The Garnet lost, 14-3. Are you discontented enough to work for G. E.? .~- . ,.

Bucking all the Varsity Hooters Upend Larries larry Mcfarlane scores on a penalty kick for varsity booters in 5-3 loss to Clarkson. ·----------- ---- By GARY PREVOST The varsity hooters used a strong defense Sat- urday and finally kicl<ed a pair of goals to end their season with a 2-1 victory -over St. Lawrence. Larry McFarlane kicked two goals for the Gar- net to give them their second victory of the year, against eight losse·s and a tie. McFarlane scored a goal in each of the first two periods after St. Lawrence had opened the s~or­ ing with a goal early in the first per-iod. The sec- ond half was scoreless as Union Goalie Toby Olson made several espel'ially fine saves, coming up with 18 in all. . Before this victory, Clarkson had extenrled the Garnet losing streak to seven with a 5-3 win on Daley Field Friday. Clarkson broke away fpom a 1-1 halftime deadlock with three third perioo goals to ice the game. Larry McFarlane scored two penalty kicl<s for Union and Dave Barton had the other tally. Coach Evans said he was as happy as a coach could be with a 2-8-1 record, citing th€ fine hus;tle of his entir<> te>am, especially center half Boh Seefried. odds the Celtics handled the 76ers like Cham- pions and beat them four game to one and went on to beat the Los Angeles Lakers for their eighth straight world championship. Showdown This year is goi·ng to be the year of the big showdown between Russell and Chamberlain, with both men leading the strongest teams ever as- sembled in the NBA, for the privilege of beoating the Western Division Champion for the league championship. At the time of this writing both teams have 8-1 records and have split twC> games between each other. I expect the::~e two teams to wipe out the rest of the league in order to beat each other. This could be the first year that two teams have won 60 games. No matter who wins, this definitely will be the greatest season the NBA has ever had. Other te:ams in the league to watch foi' are the strong and young New York Krricks who with rookh> Cazzie Ruo:;>tell have a very goN! rham•e of beating out Oscar Robertson's Cincinnati Roy- als for the third play-off position. If Elgin Baylor has t•ecovered from his knee injury and if Jerry West recovers from his leg injury, the Laker's will win the Western Division Title. Jf they don't t·ecover in time Rick Barry will definitely be close behind them with the San Francisco Warriors and he will lead them to the tftle. The Chicago Bulls lead in the West t~ght now, but watch them fade as the year's injuries hit their starters. St. Louis and Detroit will be battling for a playoff spot and Detroit just might ta:ke it, with a little help from mokie Dave Bing. Goats As all profesional leagues have their goats so does the NBA. Baseball has the Mets and the National Basketball Association has the Baltimore Bullets. Not only d(} they have no team and no coach, but they have no brains. Trading A.ll-Star Bailey Howell for Mel Counts was like trading Frank Robinson for Dick Stuart. And you can imagine what Stuart coud have done to the Orioles. Baltim(}re's chances of winning twenty games this year are about as good 11S those of Union winning three football games this year. 1966-1967 Predicted Final Standings: Eastern Division Western Division Boston Los Angeles Philadelphia San Fran.eiscry New York St. Louis Cincinnati Detroit Baltimore Chicago NBA Champion: Boston Photo by Dick Daniel Alfred's Mike Johnston is rcushed hard by Don DeMichele and Chris Cassels as he punts from deep in his own end zone.

Union was lead by sur:h steller per- formers as Pearce, Swan, Carl- son, and Syversion, each of whom rushed for over 50 yds., and the fine defensive teamwork of the line composed of Burton, Dwyer, Lynch, Monahan, and God.\rey that limited RPI to only 64 yds. on the ground, and kept cons~ant pressure on the quarterback, causing him to throw 3 interceptions, twiee to Muhly and once to Ciesinski.

Harrington said a mas.sive assault on poverty, thoroug-hly ex.plaim~d to the public, would end the general con- fusion which led to Republican vic- ! tories in last Tuesday's election. \!he Ot>her America\ The author of the highly influen- tial book ''The Other America,\ a prime force in the start . of the war on poverty dur.ing the Kennedy ad- minis•tration, accused President John- son of failing to prepare the peo.pl·e for the :uevolutionary ideas contained in legislation put before the last Con- gress. \lt was tragic that Johnson made the decision in his 1964 campaign to get the largest vqte instead of intro- ducing new ideas,\ Harrington said. \He defended this wisdom of the 1930's a,gainst Goldwater's wisdom of · the 189.0's, but di-d not defend the de- velopments of the 1960's.\ Public Is Surprised As a result of the administration's oversight, the public was surprised by the new departures. of the open hous- ing provision of the civil rights bill and the demonstration cities bill, ac- ,, , .·' cording to Harrington. \The Ameri- . can public was confused by the new ideas wanted a pauge, a\d therefore veer~d to the right,\ the author de- clared. \\ Harrington predicted that the im- mediate fttture will be more conserva- tive, but he envisioned renewed lib- eralism if \a concrete program for the abolition of poverty in the next decade\ is presented to the people. \The Federal Govemmerut\ Har- rington claimed, \has been subsidiz- ~ · , , ing the rich and the middle class at the expense of the poor and of the society as -a whole.\. ..

First, \What is the west- ern and what is the new western'?\ His answer was that the western has traditionally been the story of the confrontation between a European and an entirely alien person, the Indian. Confrontation As a resJ.Jlt of this confrontation, the European either becomes some- thing other than what he started at or annihilates the Indian, physically by war or spiritually by the Indian's conversion to Christianity. Fiedler'.s second question was, \Why did the Western decline into banality so quickly ?·\ This question he an- swers by saying that \the we&tern become southernized,\ meaning sen- timentalized and purified. Discussing what he called, \The Ue· :::;exing of the West,\ Fiedler pointed out that the Lewis and Clark Expedi- tion was made more pleasant to its parLicipants by ''all those hundreds of miles of Indian girls.\ Fiedler then went on to discuss ''the new westerner,\ which, he .said, was characterized by \parody pornogra- phy, camp and pap art.\ Writers in the new western include John Barth, Ken Kesey and David Markson, the latter a 1950 Union. graduate. The \new We·st\ discussed in the books by these authors is a \territory in our minds which we have never reached, but Fiedler contended ''the schizophrenics (such as Kesey) have pt·eceded us there. Our writers mu11t open the kind of dialogue with mad- men and with madness which they once had to enter with the inhabi- tants of the real West.\ Pollock Discusses Aspects of :Life On Can1pus By RICHARD BALAGUR \This is not coercion. Either they live on campus or ,go elsewhere. It is not a subject of ·argument.\ 0. Edward Po'llock, Dean .af Stud- ents, made this •statement in a Con- cordiensis interview 'lluesday while discussing th:e J·anuary :3 move of off- campus residents into Davidson Hall. He called it a long standing college policy to have all students live on campus. To implement this, the trus- tees have spent $4.3 million in build- ing the new dorms. \It is an integral pavt o:f the edu- cational .philosophy of U11ion to have students live in close J,Jroximity to each other and the educa·tional set- ting, other than just near classe.s.\ He cited Hamilton, Arnh.erst, Williams, Bowdoin .as being residential colleges similar in character to Union. Enforcing ·Policy Last May the college announced that all •students would have to live on campus and are now putting this policy into effect. When questioned about the announced intention of the college to move the students from North College into the new dorms before the off-campus resi>dents Pol- lock said we can make adjus.tmenrts on campus but can't ask landlords to extend leases to some indefinite time. He said he anticipated being able to move them (the North College resi- dents) into the new dorms but C.Quldn't meet the deadline because of -construc- tion delays. Room drawing dates for ·those .stud- ents living off-campus began yester- day. Students living off-campus will not be allowed to room with anyone from North College now but we will make adjustments when the other dorm is completed. Pollock said the new dorms are a great improvement over all the other college dorms. A great deal of stud- ent planning and work went into making these dorms as good as was practical. Plans were Jl1ade for de- ta!ls as small as the color and place- ment t>f hall lights and in,stallat;on of te\ephone lines. He also announced that s-tudents will be allowed to have refrigerators in the new dorms ''provided they aren't monsters.\ Each of the new dorms will have a Slil:all efficiency kitchen off the main lounge. '!'his is to enaole students to m.ake coffee or other food f.or .their use or while en- tertaining. Other features of the new dorms are that each student vrill have his own armchair, 10 feet of bookshelves, oarpeted floors, floor lamps i? e~ch suite drapes, and a .sofa. L1ghtmg has been arranged so light from any- one .staying up late will not shine on roommates. 8ome walls are covered with vinyl so students m.ay put up pictures or other articles wilth scotch tape or adhesives.

Laird Explains Policy; Students Question Dorm. Advantages By RICHARD PATTERSON \'Union College has a long standing commitment to provide the intellec- tual and social benefits to be derived from membership in the campus com- munity. The college has therefore striven to maintain its status as a residential college,\ :David B. Laird, director of residence programs and assistant to the Dean of Students said in. explaining the college's emphasis on on-campus living, According to President Martin, \'The long range go-al' is to produce a residentia] institution as rapidly as JlOssi·ble. That is why new dormitories \Were built. Xn the short run, the col- lege hopes t~ reduce the financial loss it will ·suffer by getthlg students into them as soon as poss·ible. A Concordy poll .of off-campus and North College residents showed that :many questions remained in their :rniniLs..

Both motions received al- most unanimous approval. The first ·resolution, introduced by AI Ziegler '69 1 was stated as follows: \Be it resolved that the Student Coun- cil recommends that the All College Council revise· the current policy con- cerning off-campus housing so that juniors and seniors who desire to live oft' campus may do so.\ Considerable discussion followed the introduction of the motion in which several points were made, both pro and con. It was s-aid that Union Col- lege has traditionally been a residen- tial college following the custom of many small eastern school.s. Only re- cently, due to a shortage of college housing, have students been allowed to live off campus. In response to this remark it was stated that this is an archaic tradi:tion and ·ample grounds exist for eliminating it. The point was made for many stud- ents off campus accommodation are more economical tha·n living on cam- .... , .. !~·,, ·.\'' > '. S. C. Meeting with Pres. Benjamin Volinski and.

It is , CIJ.Hlll for all .persons. concerned with the announced housing arrange- ments for the second term. The purpose will be to solidify the , widely expressed, 'but disorgan- ' ized, discontent witlt the College's · allllounced room req11irements. pus, proviclipg an opportunity to save money on ooth room and board. Liv- ing on campus would mean a financial hardship ;for such students. Ziegler stated that individual needs of students should be considered and that several students find their needs fulfiJied off-campus rather -tih.an in the d()rmitory situation. In response to . the argu:m~nt that only ·those on cam- pus are part of the college commun- ity, he stated that the large number of students oft' campus that are vital parts of the community and the many th,a~ live in , the dorms woo never show thei·r faces except in class, proves that involvement is an indi· vidual decision not contingent upon where one liv-es. , .. Second Motion · The second motion, also introduced by Ziegler, read, \Be it resolved that, rega1'dless of whether the All Cohlege Council decides to change the iong term pO'licy concerning .aff-campus living, the· Student Council recom- mends that those currently living off- campus ·should not be required to m-qve on campus in the middle of the academic year and that North Cohlege residents and others in temporary housing situations .should have prior- ity into moving into the new dorms.\ This motion also provoked consider- able discussion. Several Council nt.embers pointed out the fact that many of those now living off campus are bound to full year contracts for their rooms. A move into campus housing would constitute a financial hardship for these students. It was also stated that once the new dormi- t()ries are CO!l1Pleted, the college is obligated ·to fill them, which woUld constitute :rn·oviqg all studenrts onto the campus. Several members also questioned the direction of the admin- istration, pointing out that plans for occupying the new dorms have been altered several times. ·· Both motions being passed, the recommendation stated in each reso- Continued on Page 4

He said Dean Pollock h~d completed a thorough examination of aH the possibilities •and had come to the conclusion .t]l:at to mC}ve the off- campus students on campus fi-rst is the wisest policy. Asked about his attitude toward the fraternity system, the President said, \It is neither Bad with a cap- ital B, nor Good with a capital G.\ The fraterni-ty system has changed over the years, he said, and may change again. He expects that in four or five years the fraternities at Union will drop from si:x:ty percent affilia- tion to fifty percent as total enroill- ment 1ises. The FacuHy Council has passed a pr()posal that WC}Uld establish a co- ;opet·ative progra.m between.

He said IDean Pollock had completed a thoroughexa.mination . ~ of aH the possibHities •and had .come to the conclusion that to move the off- campus students on carnp·us first is the wisest policy. Rathskeller To the charge that the P1:esident apparently wished to Ree]'l; the Union -' a.nan on campus as much as posible, as evident in his opening the :Rathskeller on Satul'day nights, Dr. MaFtin stated that provision of a place for students to relax on weekends was a primary '\ concern. He said that the complaint that there was no place to g-o with a date OR Saturday nights had come te his attention and for that reason he , .decided on extending the availability of this on-campus activ>ity. He re- marked that he feit the deei&ion to ab- andcm Saturday classes,. popular though it may be with students and Jf.aculty, helps to create an undesirable 'weekend vacuum. tertainment. The President noted that the $3,500 paid last spring for the Kingston Trio was almost one-third the average ·salary of a Uuion faculty member. Pragmatic As.ked about his attitude toward the fraternity system, .the President said, \It is nei,ther Bad with a cap- ital B, nor Good with a capital G.\ The fraternity system has changed over the years, he said, and may change again. He eX:pects that in fout· or five years the fraternities at Union wiU drop fr0m sixty percent affiHa- tion to fifty percent as total enroH~ ment rises. He also stated that moving the frat- ernities to the new dorms was an ef- fort to maintain them, not to do a- way with them. The financial gains and the superior accomodations the fraternities will obtain far overshadow any other consideration in the move. DUKE SCIEN..T.IST WIL,L LECTUR,E G.E., UnionSeek GRADProgram By NEIL S. KRAMER The Faculty Council has passed a proposal that would establish a co- operative program between Union College and the Manufacturing Prob- lems Analysis Program of the Gell.- eral Electric Company at Pittsfield, Mass., leading to the Master of Sci- ence in Industr1al Administration. It has also refen·ed to the Facu!Jty Com- mittee on Research a S'tatement on the \.pol.icies and procedures govern- ing research at Union CoHege.\ Purposes The purposes of this cooperative program were stated to be \to encour- age the professional personnel of the Manufacturing Functions of the Gen- 3ral Electric Businesses to continue their formal education and by so do- ing: A.

Members of the council disagreed on the definition and scope of \re- search\ and the role it would play in a faculty member's scholarly ac- ti-vities. Because of this disagree- ment, the proposal was referred to the Faculty Committee 0n Resea,rch, which was charged with improving the wording of the motion.

VITA Vitalizes Underdeveloped Nations By MARIO BLANCO Brazil has a new capital with superb architec- ture. At the same time the country has <Jnly one ,ioctor for every 2,700 people, 49% literacy, and a military dictatorship. Then there i::; little uruguay with 95% literacy anu the lllUi:lt ::;table, democratic and neutral goV- <!l\Illll~llt .iu the :;uuthern wnt.inent, quaJ,ities that gained her the name of \South American Switzer- land.\ However this educated country is on the ,·erge of economic bankruptcy. What is wrong with these South American '-'ountries? It is very hard to find an answer to thi!\ quE>~tion, fo1· it i!\ vrry rHffkult to ~nalyzC' and understand the problems of the developing na- tions of the world. This is especially valid for most Latin American countl'ies where there are many contrasts and paradoxes, a·s we have just seen. Natural Resources Most Latin American countries are extremely 1ich in natural retlourcetl. However, ::lome of them are in severe economic difficulties. Othertl have uot yet reached political tltability, and .are ::;trug- ~ling to find a government fair to all. What is then the problem? There has been much specula- tion and a number of theories to explain the rea- ,;ons why these countries have not been able to reach prosperity. A Moroccan woman prepares the mid-day meal on em inexpensive solar cooker developed by VITA volunteers. One of the most important pro-blems probably is the poor economic diversification of the great ma- joiity of the Latin American c_ountries. lt is. self- ~vident that most of these natiOns rely heavily, 1f not complet~ly, on the production and export of one or very few items. For example, we have Bolivia that live·s on its tin exports, and is the tthird largest producer in the world; Argentina with meat and cattle (4th in the world); Brazil ui.t.h .coffee ( lst in the world); Venezuela with <lil (3rd in the world); Chi'le with copper (3rd in the w<Jrld); Peru with fish and silver (1st and 2nd in the world respectively); and the list goes on. This dependence on the production of one item might have its advantages, but the disadvantages are far too clear. Small fluctuations in the inter- l1ational price of tin produce extremely magnified -effects on Bolivia's economy. In fact, when the \Yorld price went down in the early 50's, there was almost an economic catastrophe in this southern ~ountry. It is evident that such an economy leaves these ,•ountri-:><; in a very precarious position. It makes them far too dependent upon factors outside their -control. Furthermore, we have the fact that some <>f these countries, in an effort to maximize the output of an x product, neglect the creation of ~1ther industries, which would otherwise balance the economy. Thi\s sometimes reaches a point where every- -one seems to be obsessed with a problem and much eff01t is spent on rather impractical solu- tions. This sort of thing did happen in the Boliv- ian mining circles when pr<Jduction went down in .several mines. Large sums of money were spent to raise the output of some of those almost worn- out mining complexes, money that was badly needed by the rising and more promi::;ing oil in- dustry. Slow Industrialization Another evident problem is the low industrial- ization of mo·st Latin American countries. This along with the almost nil economic diversification leaves many of these developing eountries largely dependent upon the more advanced nations while their standard of living is kept low and rather static. For example, Bolivia, while one of the leading tin producers of the world, does not have even one large tin smelting plant. As a result, the price obtained for her tin is much lower than the one for pure tin bar'S. We can thu_<:: sPe that the installation of such plants would raise the na- tional income, besides 11rovidina- more w01·k and triggering a multiplier effect that would only stimulate the eeonomy f>f the country. 'fhy then have iqdustries not developed in these nations where raw materials are abundant, where rivers are large enough to generate huge amounts of power, and where there exist varied climate'S that give almost ideal conditions for the produc- tion of all kinds of agricultural goods? One answer is the lack of capital to buy ma- chinery, etc., although this does not represent an insurmountable obstacle. But the main problem is the shortage of qualified technicians, engineez•s and other prO>fesional people. And there is also a lack of previously accumulated technological data, library facilities, research centers. At the present time, several countries are making efforts to cor- rect this situation. However, this process does take several years and some countries have to stazt at the very .bottom of the scale, that is, by first eliminating illiteracy in order to make any progress in the creation of a modern technology. Immediate Solution Nevertheless, an immediate solution would be a \transfu\sion\ of technical information and ad- vice to these developing countries. This is pre- cisely the type of work that is being- done by VITA (Volunteers for International Technical As- sistance). · VITA, whose headquarters is in Sehenectady, is an oz·ganization of engineer's, scientists and other professional people who volunteer their free time to assist the developing nations in the solu- tion of technical problems of all kinds. VITA has presently 2000 members in the l!. S. and 47 other countries. Furthermore, VITA has direct relatin·ships with some technical Societies, surh as the Institute of Food Terhnologists and the American Society of Agricultural Engineers. All this plus the available technical literature pub- lished in the countries where technology is more advanced, represent a very rich source of tech- nical knowledge at the disposal of the less de- veloped countries. It can be used to find immed- iate or easier solutions to thousands of problems. These problems. range from the very simple, like how to make chalk, to the very complex, such as the trace and analysis of imprities in steel alloys. VITA also has a special interest in the encour- agement of small industries that raise the stand- ard of living of private dtizen•s, and it has been engaged in the solution of several problems in this area.

All these projects, when successfully completed, are a ·step forward towards a better.ment in the standard of living of a number of people in the 'short run, and the establishment of a more diversi- fied economy in the long run. Helping Peace Corps Another i1nportant feature is the a,ssistance VITA is giving- to Peace Corps volunteers in Latin America and elsewhere. Some of the PC volun- teers are fa~ed with problems they are incapable of solving by themselves, because they have not had the tec-lmical training or, more frequently, do not have the background information to solve a specific technical problem. In this ca·se, they sim- ply have t() send enough data to VITA. There will always be a VITA volunteer who is expert in the field of technology related to the problem. He supplies the PC volunteers with information and directions. Then, the men in the field have only to follow this advice to a~hieve, in most cases, a satisfactory solution. An example of this would be a greenhouse built by PCV and local citizens or a methan gas generator built with the advice of several VITA volunteers. Besides the technical information VITA supplies to the devel()ping nations, and the effectiveness of this type of assistance for international develop- ment, there is also another feature we must take into account. The requestor in the developing countries sincerely appreciate the interest in his problem of a person thousands O>f miles away, who does not even know him, and is motivated by a sincere desire to be useful to a fellow man in a Je·ss comfortable position than he is. I believe this is an important breakthrough in communication and understanding among peoples of different nations. VITA also represents the beginning of a suc- cessful exchange of technical information and spread of mo<lern technology to the developing nations of the W()rld. This can only lead to the improvement·of the living conditions of the people in these nation·s, for there are no barriers for sci- ence, and no mutter how complex or insurmount- able a problem looks, technology always reaches a point where it can be wived. Note. There has been lately a large increase in re- quests and !here is a neea of uol~nteers to help as model builders, translators, and for the editorial sec- tion. To volunteer you only have to call the local VITA offici'. 1377-7.150\. Thursday, November 17, 1966 Fraternity Role Is InFlux Mixed feelings are circulating concerning .fra- ternities throughout the United States. Many ., people (mostly fraternity alumni and relatives) favor G1·eek societies and consider them a bene- ficial pa1•t ·of campu'S life. On the other hand, many protest the secret organizati0ns as discriminatory or •as hampering studies. Wihile the existence of fraternities in the it• :pres- E'nt states at Union SPems unque·stionable (they're part of the college tradition), other scho<Jls are witnessing changes in the structure an{j :p()]ieies of their Greek societies. Moral Controversy A. moral controversy exist's between Bowd<>ili College and the campus chapter <Jf S.igma Nu. Althougn the particular chapter at Bowdo.~n is as ., well integrated as a,ny othet· campus house, it belongs to a national that openly supports dis- crimination. The Dean of the CoHege suggests that the Sigma Nu chapter either ·seek affilf.ation with another national or go local. Break With T tadition Recently at Saint LaWl·ence University, the brothers ()f Sigma Alpha Epsilon broke with tra- dition and allowed dates and guests to attend upperclassmen's pledging. Permission was granted to this chapter to open the formerly secret .pledg- ing ceremonies at a national convention of Sigma Alpha Ep·siJon. At Stanford University the question arises: \Is .a fraternity a fraternity if it doesn't lise the blackball?\ Indeed Beta ·Chi pulled a surprise move by abolishing its selective system of choos,.. ing- new members. The fraternity thus proken radically with tradition and is now open to .any- one connected with Stanf<Jrd University, includ- ing women, graduate students, and administrat- ors. Now onlv interest in house .activities and payment of the dues are the prerequisites for membership.

Mmw had sympathy however, with the financial aspects of the probl'em. Student:; :..md faculty felt that the administration has placed too much emphasis 'On the advan- tages of livir.g in rlorr1 !tories, neglecting the num ero1:1s advantages of off-campus living. Donald Abood Ed :te~· of the Idol, ]i\,es off-campus and feels \a's far as far as proposed benefits are ron- ce.J:·ned, 6ff-campus living is ::t better experience than on compus living.\ Dav~ Weiland, a resident advisor, feels that one of the advantages to off campus living; is that it acts as a \tran'sitional period between semi regimented living; and complete freedom.\ Another student said \It's beneficial for a .student to get some idea of what it's like to be living on ~is own while he still has the college to provide a great deal for him. Then when he graduates and IS com- pletely on his own, he will find it a lot easier.\ Besides acting as a transitional period, several other a4vantages were point~d out by those inter- viewed. M-alcolm Willh;on uf the Sociology department, sa1d \Off campus housmg has had a number of commenda;ble coneomitants (I'm not su1'e if they are consequences) for some students: better study conditions, better control o:ver thetr time, more mature social.and intepectuallife, etc. Thos~ in charge have not apparently successfully demonstrated that these Will prevail to the same degree m the new dormitories.\ A. Lack of Adequate Facilities Another student, living off campus, said, \Pre-s- ident Ma1tin has repeatedly emphasized the need to re'strict individual freedom in the dorm situa- tion eithet· by way uf regulation~ \~' >'udal pre~­ sure. There a·re certain students who value their individual freedom and if they can't have it in the dorms they should at least be allowed to :find it off campus.\ Another said, \Many of our most interesting and exci·ting students have lived .off campu'S in the past and it's a shame to force them to live a n•gulatcd t>xisl<>n<'<'. This eampus is sterile enough as it is, and foreing the entire stu- dent body to live under the same conditions will certainly not breed individuality.\ Thr followir:; ;s at: eva 1 :tr·':on rf the Drama Program by a meMber of the Afo:tr.teban~·'· \To !:H:~n;; the arL • ut of t::_·ir .peripheral state and incol>porate them as a major ;part of the Un- ion College program\ is, accDrding to Dean of the College, Theodm'e Lockwood, the major objec- ............................... , ............................... ·\\ ........ .., .............. \ ......................................................................... · .... co...-.........

Th.e angles of the lights can not o'e controlled. It is impossi- ble to light just one area of the stage and, equally impossible to light the stage without lighting part of the audience. With· the present dimmers, only very crude fading efl'e~ts are posible. Virtually nothing can be done with the present lighting system beyond simply lighting the stage. Better lighting systems are in use in almost every high school. Meriwether said that he has \never seen or heard of any other arena theater without an over- head grid.\ A grid (an overhead web of battens on which to hang lights) would improve the effic- iency and flexibility ·of . the lig-hting eighty per- cent. The other twenty ,percent would be provided by a new control board to replace the nearly forty year-old relic now in use. The two improve- ments would give the theater .100% operating efficiency wjthin its ·self-inflicted confines. I don't think this is too much to ask. Consultants Called that this was entirely feasible. Even if this large investment is put off (as it apparently has been) there is no logical reason why an overhead grid can not be put in the theater. Over a yea;r ag;o, Anthony Hoadley, professor emeritus of Civil Engineering designed a grid that would have come to a total cost, including construction and installment, of only $1600. Over a pe1iod of five years, an annual cost of $320 to- wards an 80% betterment of the theater. I think that sum could be fitted into the Union College million dollar plans without too large a ripple. T:P,ere are evidence)> now that the grid may be installed this year; I hope this .tirne they aren't empty promises. The grid has b!:len put off for a year and already has gone up in cost to $1728. More delays will merely mean more money. Plans When Dean Lockwood was asked what the plans were for improving the Nott Theater, he said that he was \aware of the difficulties\ (he has been for three years) and \no decision has been made. It is a question of what is urgent; we d() have the new engineering building to think about.\ Yes we do have the new engineering; building to think about, and no e,mphasis need be taken from the sciences or engineering'curriculum. But it is time the arts at Unicm College were brought to an equal level with the sciences and given not only as much verbal emphasis but as mu.ch mone- tary backing. Concern A major area of concem wa·s with the manner in which the college is creating a residential cam- pus. Most felt that coercion is not the \ideal way to do this.\ The concensus was that the college should attempt to make the campus as desirable a place to live as pos·sible. Forcing people to live on will not improve the campus any, and in fact, may very well detract from it, because those forced to rn1>ve on campus will start out with a feeling of dissatisfaction.\ Carl Rosenstock said \The idea of a residential campus i's a f~Jeling, and can't be legislated. Y()u don't have to have everyone living on campus to have the feeling of a residential cam.pus. In other words students living off campus can feel more closely connected with the campus than many liv- ing on.\ Many others expressed similar views. Art McCabe ·said, \You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink. People will learn no Jp.atter where they are if the want to.'' The proximity of most off campus living makes it possible for many students off campus to be as close to the center of camp1,1s as some of the dis- tant fraternities. For the most pa,rt, those who live further away have, access to cars. Financial considerations were brought up by those living off campus. Jan Werner, live~:; off campus and figures the extra cost for him will be $30 a month. Others gave comparable figures. This i's due to the cheaper rent off campus and the opportunity to cook one's meals. \The col- lege has made execptions only for those who are earning the complete cost of their room. What apout others who save a considerable amount without wm).dng for their rooms. For many stu- dents this will cause financial hardship.'' Another said, \The college is keeping itself out of financial difficulty by putting us into it.\ 'J.'here has been much speculation as to the reason that students are being forced to move on campus instead of being allowed to move on volun- tarily. Many attribute the coercion to financial re- asons. W alt~r Lowen, Chairman of the department of Mechanical Engineering, \believes in freedom but feels that economics might be the deciding fa-ctor in forcing students to move on!' However, he feels, \if eno.ugh students are in the dorms, don't move thQse off campus in.\ A prevalent' opinion was that, \If the college will lose a g-reat deal of money, then I guess they have to fill the dorms.\ Arbitrary Willia,m Merriwether, director of the Theater, said, \It's an arbitrary decision that has no justi. fication in. terms of educational needs, student needs, or social needs.\ Many expressed dismay at the fact that up until now there has been no su.bst;mtial student opposition.

Due to the bullt-~n disadvantages of the physical plan, it is :ssent~al that all pos- i · siblE! faetlities work at lOO~o effic1ency .. The pres- In the fall of 1964, ~>hartly after Meriwether first arrived on our campus, he suggested that lighting consultants bl.'\. called in to evaluate the Nott Theater's needs. 'fhls past summer, the con- sultants were called from the three top lighting companies in the country (Century. Clevel Broth- ers, and Lighting Electronics). All three echoed Meriwether's suggestions for improvements. They declared the control boatd not only totally ineffic· icnt, but unsafe to the point of being dangerous. The slightest short in the aged system could cause a damaging fi,re in the Memorial. They all reiterated his disbelief at the lack of an overhead grid, a system they deemed absolutely essential t() any arena theatre. 1n the five months since their reports, there seems to be little evidence of a decision. The new program ior the arts sounds wonder- ful on paper and the student interest is alive. But \the theater program i'S severely compromised by the inadequacies of the lighting system\ (]1oo- fessor Meriwether) and I might add, compromised by too frug;al an attitude on the whole. Flagrant There has been a flagrant failure to back up any sensible program in the theater. We want to ad, we have the manpower and a fine staff to lead us; all we need to produce rs a 1•eputable drama program at Union and the proper ·facilities. AnQther area of criticism is the method by which the administration is effecting the move baek on campus. Those living off ca:mpus are dis- sa-tisfied because they have to move back on .in the middle of the year and this causes great in- convenience. Al'so, many were forced to sign leases i:n order that tliey obtain apartm;ents and. these students might wind up paying rent for two places. Meanwhile, those living in North College and .other temporary conditions will have to stay there a month longer than they planned. S.amuel B.

Editor-in-Chief . ... Businrss D.1anager ·-----------------------------------------~ Force, Not Reason It is rare that an entire campus, especially one as apathetic as this one, becomes incensed about anything. But the administration's recent decisions have, to a great extent, united the campus. Most significant has been the passage of two resola- tions by the Student Council calling for change both in the general policy of a residential college and m the spe- cific Implementation of this policy. Both resolutions are exceedingly well-taken. At root of the whole problem is the question of what this college ought to be. '.L'his question must be answered before any specific administrative decree can be issued. The College has stated what it thinks the community sho1:1.ld be. A place where all students will center their entire existence. Yet it is shocking tnat the college has been extremely reluctant to enter into a fresh dialogue with stu-· dents on whether this policy is actually best for Union. h;specially shocking is LJavid Larrd's walking out on Concorctiensis interviewers as soon as questions concern- ing the philosophic underpinnings of the policy were raised. 11: ne fe1t incompetent to discuss such matters, or felt that someone higner up in the adminstration should be the one to do so, he shoUld have said so. But to simply refuse to discuss these matters is a sign of disrespect not only to this newspaper but to the student body it serves. lt is, furthermore, a highhanded disregard o! the duties of of- ncmls in a free society. At root, is the relationship of the student to the col- lege. When he graduates, he will be asked to contribute to support tne college. lt seems to us that he should do so because he is a member of the college community and this does not end even when he graduates and moves many Luousand of miles away. For membership in a community is a matter of mind, not of miles. The vegetable in the dormitories who goes to classes and does nothing else is not a full member of the community; the man who lives off-campus and is active in a wide range of campus activities is. We see little reason to believe that the man who is a junior or senior and decides to live in a private apartment is reducing his participation in the community any more than the professor who lives off campus is not a member of the community. For the fact remains, no matter what way the adminis- tration tries to cut it, that a college thrives on diversity, and one division is that of students who function better in dormiories and students who funcion better in private housing. We feel that it is a highly specious argument to say that the latter group do not add to the richness of the college community and should leave if they cannot adapt to dormitory living. Implied behind all of the college's talk is, of course, simple coercion: the student will like the administrators' decisions or lump them, either by unhappily bowing to them or by getting out. Either alternative leaves the col- lege a poorer place, for the reliance on force rather than reason is certainly the antithesis of what a college ought to be. There may be reason behind the administrations de- cisions concerning the forced occupancy of the new dormi- tories. Certainly the financial reasons are important. But we have not heard convincing arguments as to why the col- lege should want to be a purely residential college. And until this point is settled, the college will continue to find itself in possession of white elephans such as Davidson and Fox Halls. Dormitories can be filled voluntarily, but that involves effort. The advantages can be made more significant, the drawbacks lessened. But so long as the easier method of administrative dictuum is relied upon, the new day at Union that we are all looking forward to will never arrive. For the immediate problem, we suggest that off cam- pus students have priority in moving into the new dormit- ories if they so desire. Residents of temporary housing could then fill the remaining space. When Fox Hall opens, students still in temporary housing and those who had elected to stay off campus would have to enter. While not good, it is better than the present scheme. Saturday Night .At present, the man who does not like drama will never find anything except rock and roll parties or study- ing to accupy himself on campus on Saturday night. This, as President Martin has pointed out, needs rectification soon. Bailey Hall will s0on be vacated by its present occu- pants. Some of the room there,. or else,wnere if it can be found, should be turned into social faciliti~s. Installation of bowling alleys or pool tables is one possibility. Exten- sion of the movie series to somewhat more popular films, such as the foreign films which were the main fair on Fri- day nights two years ago, is another possibility. We hope that the administration and other organs of college, including the All College Council and the Student Council, will try to make Union a better place for a full life. Thursday, November 17, 1966 , Thursday, I Letters to the Editor Indignities To the Editor: For the past four years, I have been, off and on, a student at Union. During this time, I have been forced to suffer a var1ety of indigmties ut the hands of the college administration. .A short list wouH include Hving in West College, having my fraternity banned from cam- pus for less than adequate r,eason, and finally, <Onduring a year in Richmond where I discovered that an .upper class independent has fewer ·pri:v-'ileges than a ft·eshman. All this I ha-ve borne in silence, and even must giv.; some credit to the administration for attempting to rectify some of these pr<Jblems. The latest administrative decision, however, concerning residence in tl1e nerw dormi- tories, has pushed my pa.!ience to the limit. Last week I received a newsletter, as did everyone living off campus,. stating that aH students were ne>w being pro- vided with the opportunity te> become an integral part of the campus community, or else. I would like -to ask severa-l questions concerning this decision. For one, what about the confil'rned misan\ thropes and more independent MEN who, having- sampled this community, with- drew from it voluntarily, and have no desire to return? Apparently the ad- ministration has decided t.J1a.-t even the most mature upperclassman is no·t capa- ble of deciding what environment is best suited to his inte.Jlectual and social needs, In ano.ther vein, what .of the upper- classmen who are quite capable of pre- scribing their own moral codes ? There are some you know, despitE the protes- tations of the administration, and resent having the college regulatiol'ls foisted up- on them. I, for example, am old enough to vote for the president of the country, be responsible for any debts that I may incur, and even to choose a wife if I please, yet once on campus my sex life is to be governed by the college. This I re- gard a•s an inexcusable violation of my personal life, an area in which the col- lege has no right to interfh·e. Finally, I would ask in what .sense does campus life provide an atmosphere more approaching normali:ty than off- campus residence, as President Martin suggests? It has been my expe·rience that apartment life has provided much more meaninful contact with. reality than any to be found on campus. In fact, I would argue that campus life is one of the more gross distortions <Jf reality to be found. ln no way can the s·heltered and fraternal a.tmosphere of co!1ege liv- ing be compared with any other form social unit that a college g;m.duate will encounter. I would suggest that when the administration has finally created the intellectual and social community that they are working towards, that it complete the job by renaming the school \Utopia or perhaps \Oz and issue rose-colored glasses to all graduating seniors. Of course, the hardest fact to .swallow is the realization that writin.g this letter is a waste of time. When the adminis- tration makes a decision, well that's that. There is one consolation, however. No longer must the Union man wai.t till death to reach that great ivy campus in the .sky. Come January 3., it will be right here in Schene·ctady, whet;her we want it Ol' not. Bill Barnes '67 On or Off? To the Editor: Your latest editorial with. regard to housing was excellent. However, I think there are more specifie questiolls to ask of Dean Laird and the Administration. Simply asking if this policy of being a \residential college\ is the real reason for movinQ' e\·eryone ho:k on campus is not enough. .'!f Why mu.:;G residents of North College continue to suffer the inadequacies of that building when Davidson Jlall will be ready in January? Cet·tainl:v the stud- ents occupying apartments do not suffer. If they do, they may move. This is not true of a student residing in that pitiful building we call North College. It seems to me that Union is shirking its respon- sibility to the student when it fails to provide him with a decent place to study and sleep, much less entertain his parents and guests! Why must the residents of K-A., Beta, and Phi Gam continue to suffer the wretchedness that inhabits their physical plants when Davidson Hall will be ready for occupancy January 3, and Fox Hall ready a month or so aftenvard? It is certainly not a matter of choice. Sopho- mores and Juniors must live on c-ampus and there is no other place than in their houses in which they may reside. Again, students dwelling in apartments do not have this problem. Whii does Dean Laird contend that liv- ing on campus will enhance the pQissibil- ity of participating in campus activities? Does he not realize that th\=l majority of those living off-campus are Senior-s and that if they had wished to participate in college aCJtivities they would have done so by their senior year'? The implication that those who live off-camp·llS d·o not participate is false. I think t.he Con- cordiensis proved that in its I a&t edi- torial. A Senior who has experienced a yeai· or three months of apartment :living should not be forced to move back into a dormitory. In four years he has ma- tured, acquired likes ·and dislikes, made friends and enemies, .and more often than not, enjoyed his chosen way of life. Why should he be put in a position where,. for a second time in his college career, he ma,y have to contend with an- other pe1·son's likes or dislikes, another person's friends or enemies, or, for that matter, wiith another person? I for one, \neither enjoy nor gain from dormitory living.\ t knnw ·that if I am compelled to move into -a dormitory, I will not on-ly lose financially, as the Concordy pointed out, but I will also lose some of 'the indi- viduality whic;h I have acquired while 'living in a:n apartment. 1 will gain nothing by living in a dormitory for the second time, and I am sure that many other Seniors would reiterate this feel- ing. I think Dean Laird and the Ad- ministration should answer the argu- ments I have posed with something other than \it is •the policy of the College.\ My arguments, I think, are valid and deserve a reply. David L. Ankeles '67 ROTC etc. To the Editor: Now that you are presumably soothed to take exception to the editorials ap- pearing in the Nov. 10 issue, we wish to take execption to the editorials appear- ing simultaneously. Actually we find it hard to ·cred~t the editorial on ROTC-Union being threat- ened by the creeping dangers of militar- ism, indeed! Lt i·s havdly likely that ROTC could be so dangeroos, nor the Union student so •()btuse, as to make your assumptions valid. No one iJs be- ing forced to join the Air Force, or to accept its authority and tenets; no one even has to pay anv attention to its campus activities. ROTC does, however afford several students the opportun- ity of earning a commission while ob- taining a superior education to that a\ vailable at the service academies. In trampling on ROTC, the Concord- iensis violates bounds of taste and com- mon sense. These students are le.arning techniques of serving their country at a time when their servic~s are badly need- ed. It is nat the Concordy's place to impugn either their motives or ends, and cevtainly not in so drastic a manner. While we agree that students .should not be forced to live on campus, the man- ner in which the Concordiensis went about its suggestion of a remedy is ob- vious idiocy. To suggest the remodel- ment cxf Richmond House would be a wor.thy editorial subject, possibly of some effect. But to suggest its destruc-tion ma]{es the editorial merely ridiculous, and one more proof to the opponents of the paper of its irresponsibility. One would almost think that all the criticism had no effect whatsoever, the Conco1'diensis continues to dispense ut- ter garbage under the guise of informed editorial o.pinion. The Concordy has a responsibility to the campus to present ideas fresh and perceptive to dig where <>thers can not, to provide an insight useful and prevoca- tive. We ask, we hope for a considerable number of students, that the Concord- iensis live up to that ta.sk. Take heed l)f the criticism, gentlemen, it is well meant and may be of importance to the future of your publication!

I realize that no changes can be made fo:r the next party weekend which is only a week away, but I am sure all these things will be remediecj in.,$Jw!'!· D. Gregor ~elf.~~~!\:c68 Publications To the Editor: The controversy ove:r publicrutions has become an unlimited free-for-all for any student or groUJp needing a topic to fill · a lapse of c'onversation. Campus critics who need a scapegoat Jmve found eme in publications. Mention the Gonc-ordiensis and the immediate response is negative; irresponsible editorials, inaccurate re- portage of news, and a dosed staff. Criticism is the easiest thing in the worl'd. There is alway.s someone who can shOIW you where you have :failed. Liter- ary critics live by dissecting other men's efforts, yet, like the -majority of student letter writers condemning publications and the Concordiensis· in parti-cular, these critics .offer nothing original of their own. Criticism, in the public;ation controversy, that does not offer alterna- tive soluti-ons for improvement is mean- ingless. Editorial policy is the right of an edi- tor. Editorials are an expression of opin- ion, designed 1/o stimu:labe thought. Edi- toriais are a statement of belief. You cannot condemn a man for hi.s opinions, nor can you condemn, a publication on the basis of editorial policy. The Student Council recently delegated \ a c<Ommittee to investiga:te the problems involved with publica;tions, and selection of edi-tors. The purp•ose of this commit- tee is to find a suitable alterna,tive to .,, the Publications Selection Committee which will allow the individual pu-blica- tions to elect their editors. In doing this, .student government disinvolves it- '<~ self from the press. The editors of the three campus publications are currently drafting proposals which will have pro- visions for election of editors. The closed staff is a myth. Any stud- ent wishing to work on a publication may. But it is work. lt demands as much as twenty or thirty hours of time ~ week. It demands a belief in the publication itt and not merely a pas.sing interesi}. And it requires initiative and new ideas. Without ideas any publication b_ecomes stagnant. This year can be a good year for pub- lications if they are viewed with optim- ism. The Garnet promise.s to be an ex- cellent yearbook; the ne\'ltspaper has proven its ability with good articles and features; the Idol staff has been revital- ized and enlarged.

Give us a break! Andrew Kadak '67 Jazz Workshop To the Editor: This letter is written as an objec- tion to the concert review\Jazz Work- shop: The First Set,\ written by Rocky Topeka, and appearing in the Concor- diensi::; of Thursday, November io. My qualification for objecting is as a mem- ber of the Jazz Quintet, but not of the Concert Jazz Band. I therefore feel that I can critize what the Concert Jazz Band did. First, the comparison of the Band to the Quintet was foolish. The Quintet is more experienced on both an indiv- id-ual basis, and as a group. Second, the Workshop gr'Oups ·are not professional. They are all student run ..• with the purpose cxf giving people with little or no experience in Jazz a chance t() get involved with the art. Of neces- ity, the performances have rough spots. A school, like Union, doesn't have en- 'v\' ough experienced jazz musicians. Sure, University of Wisconsin, for e1-:ample, offers a full credit course in Stage Band in which the group performs original Stan Kenton arrangements. We, at Union just could not do this; there are-n't en- ough jazz men around. , The arrangements rnay hav~ been u \trite but better arrangements are hard to get, and it's harder to perforn1 them. If Mr. Topeka knows where there are better arrangements, we are open to his suggestions. , The article said, \The Band bet~er find some good soloists.'' We've scouiled the campus, and we've got th~ best ~.ow. In the Concert Band, two musrcans tiiied out for eYel'Y one position in the gro\Jip (and that's prety god). No, the Band wlon't be able to compare to the Quintet Oi'Yer all, but it will stiH ~e. a means of .e~lJO;Slire , for student musrc1ans to playn.l~' Jazz. And that's the point of a Jazz W.o;rlcshop. I am not objecting to a had rG;view- some of Mr. Topeka's criticism lis well taken. But the misguided position from which that review was writen, shows that the purpose of the Jazz Works4op has been misinterpreted. Again, the objective is the exposure of the greatest :Possible number of people to the writting, perfor- ming, and enjoyment of jazz, Mike Penna, '67 ' \ ~ 11 I• Likl big indi this thin pen· s wan resJ= \1 eno con idee cou: littll carl pac sup: to 1 witl 1 we'

Robert Benson, in his 'second year as swimming coach, is looking forward to heading a squad this year that is both solid and experienced with many returning mem- bers from the junior and senior classes. First Match Jan. 11 ·• Albbough the team's first match wiH not take place until January 11 when Union will face Wil- liams at home, Coach Benson is hoping that con- tinued workouts in practic~ ·sessions and the ex- tended season for 1966-7 should produce a strong effort by Union. The schedule this year includes • eleven meets, which could help the team to better last season's record of 6 wins and 3 los'Ses. 1ni-captains Serving as tri-cap!ains of the squad are three seniors; Paul Shields, Jame.s Mog'al, and c:hds Cassells. Shields is the hoider of three Uni()n swimming records as well as the holder of the state mark in the 200 yard individual medley in b0th 1965 and 1966. He expects to compete in tl1e shorter· freestyle events this season. Mogal is l10ping to swim the freestyle and the backstroke. Cassels will act as half of a diving duo of which the other member 1\TiH be Harvey Richmond, a sophomore. ,, for im- \'' • d alone. on our and of these ., onstruc- debate If o come par- large . .

It's trade-in time for tired old myths. Like the one about business. Especially big business. That it is beyond the rugged individualist's wildest daydream to enter this holy of holies because he'll lose some- thing that's very sacred -like his inde- pendence. Sure, it can happen. If a guy or gal wants to hide, or just get by, or not accept responsibility, or challenges. We're not omniscient enough or stupid enough to speak for all business, but at a company like Western Electric, bright ideas are not only welcome, they are en- couraged. And no door is shut. Create a little stir, go ahead, upset an old apple- cart (we replace shibboleths at a terrific pace - we have to as manufacturing and supply unit of the Bell System - in order to provide your Bell telephone company with equipment it needs to serve you.) There's an excitement in business. True, we're in it to make a profit, but working to find new and better ways to make things that help people c()rnmunicate is very re- warding and satisfying. Did you ever hear these wry words of Oliver Wendell Holmes? \Never trust a generality- not even this one.\ That's how we feel about the generality that claims you'll jllst become a little cog in a company like Western Electric. You might, of course, bnt if you consider your- self an individual now, odds are 10 to 1 that you'll keep yDur individuality. And cherish it. And watch it grow. Even at big, big Western Electric.

When ~leveland \Big Cat\ Williams stepped mto the l'Jng orr Monday, the people at the Hous- ton Astrodome were positive that their mighty, muscular hometown hoy would be just the man 'to defeat Casius Clav, alias Mohammed Ali, the heavyweight champion. The promoters had built this fight up so pe1~fectly that many lmowledge- able sports fans. were fooled into bel.feving the same thing. Mr. Ali had .different ideas. Goliath Cleveland Williams, a man who, in his mid- thirties, l()oks like a goliath, \was\ a good fighter. Prior to the dav he ·ran into a policeman\s bullet, he was considered one of the best punchers in the ring. After his accident, he appeared in two bouts and knocked out both opponents, looking as if the bullet wound had left no after effects. When WiHiams and his manager, Hugh Benbow, stepped toward the ring on Monday, both felt that Williams'· vower would ·be enough to counter Clay's speed. The fight .plan of Williams was to force Cll:)y toward the ropes, corner him there, and let him hav:e it. Clay's fight plan was to keep away fro·m the ropes, remain in the center, and try to let Williams have it. The Big Punch What surprised WiHiams as well as the public is that Clay not only has speed, but he also has the big pun.ch. Having knocked Williams down three times in the ·first and second rounds, tne referee ended the fight at 1:09 into the third round giving Clay a TKO. Cleveland Williams found out what Cassius Clay has been verbalizing for years: he is the greatest! He is the total fighter, with speed, strength, and an enormous ring savvy. There is no one at this time who can meet and match Clay in the ring. BY AL LEVI E:rnie Terrell will be the next man to find this out . As far as Cleveland Wiiliams ·is concerned, he was too old! Age was the factor in this fight; Wil'liams was too slow to move in either attack or retreat. The Big Cat just got caught. Prediction of the Week: Notre Dame 35, Afichigan State 17. Prevost Breaks Bowling Mark Gary Prevost's league record single of 258 and 631 triple paced Top's Bar to a 3-1 win over Sealtest in the Dutch Classic Bowling League last week. The three points moved Top's Bar back into first place by one game over Bernie's Mid-Hill Tavern. Jim Stratton added 555 for Top's while 'Tom Benedict's M3 was high ior Sealtest. Top's had the high team game and series for the week with 890 and 2447, respectively. Moffet's Triumphs Moffet's Liquor Store downed Bernie's Tavern three points to one behind Charlie Sullivan's 535 and Bob Erianne's 527. Ken Merchant was high for Bernie's with 563. Caruso's Bar took three points from Team #4 as Clayton Williamson scored 236-564 for the winners, while Paul Gerber had 212-539 for the losers. In the final match Teddy K's Tavern took four points from Vito's Boys. I,arry Martin had 515 for Teddy K's whi1e Ken Bousquet had 502 for Vito's. Martin Leader After 5 weeks of bowling Larry Martin is the individual average leader with 185 followed by Gary Prevost 184; Ken Merchant 181; Paul Ger- ber 180; and Jim Stratton 178.

Uni()n Pre .. Meds W()rk at Ellis ,page 3 Concordy Sports Campus Opinion On Housing Page7 Hatnilton Spills Garnet, 30-13; Utecht And Dill Click T~ice Bolstered by the return of seven letter men and several players from last year's fine freshman team, Coach El Evans hopes this year's cagers can improve on last Cagers Show Good Depth; Four Starters Returning Vo'l. 1 year's 8-13 record. The 1966 Union football team closed out a 30-13 loss to Hamilton. In a season loaded with disappointing season by absorbing a '· · costly injuries the Garnet won one, lost six, and tied one. Heading the list of returning starter'S is senior guard G1•eg Olson, who led the Gm·net in scor- jng last year \d!h a 14.:~ average. Another g·ood sta1ter from last year's team is 6'5\ junior Fitz Turner who was second in rebounding and third in scoring . .A.vevaging nine points a game, Fitz was named by his teammates as last year's most improve>d player. At Clinton, fumbles t<Jld the story as both teams fumbled four times 1 with Hamil~ ton recovering a118 muffs. The Continenta 1 .s rolled to a 12-0 lead in the first period as Garnet fttmbles set up two toucJtdown· passes by quarterback John Freedman. The first was .a 23 yarder to Bob Cady, and the ~econd a 10 yarder ~ ·\- Urbelis, Giancola Back The two other returning starters are senior g·uard Tom Urbelis and sen_ior g·uard-center R~n Giancola. Evans says Urbelts, who was fourth m scoring last year with a 8.1 average, is looking the best ~ince his freshman year. Giancola, trou- bled by a bad back last year is healthy for the first time in two y-ears. Also returning are junior lettermen Tad Knig-ht and 6'7\ fonvard Jim Der- rick. Knight figUl'es to be a strong utility man while Derrick should give the Garnet added re- bound s·trength. 'Completing the list of returning lettermen is juniut· Uill I'r<:!.scott who i:; at present nursing an injury. Stro11g Sophomore Support Backing up the veterans are a host of sopho- more::; who Coaeh Evans says can ~xpect to see plenty of action tl1is winter. Among the list: 6'2\ football ace Joe ,James; Clitf Feldman, 6'4\ for- ward; Warren :Mumford, 5'10\ guard; Don Ben- trovato, 6-f'Oot guard, who is very much in con- tention for a starting role; :Mike Chater, 6-2 for- ward; Jim Wilson, 6-2 guard; and 5-10 guard Art Cabe, a good jumper. Coach Evans is faced with what he considers too much depth, making it hard to find a first five. The Garne>t should hm·e rebounding strength but lack outside shooting-. Evans is having to do with- out four boys that he originally expected to have this year-Jim Wi.lliams, AI Hrdlicka, BiH Neidel and Bill Boehm. Williams, who transferred to Carleton College was a tough defensive player. Hrdlicka, Union's fifth highest ·scorer last year, is academically in€ligible this semeste1·. Boehm, a 6-5 center who had 47.6 field goal percentage lagt year, i;; lost to the cause with an jnjured ANNOUNCEMENT The Var'sity-Aiumni basketball game will be played at :l P.M. in the Memorial Field House Saturday. Returning for the alumni will be Dave Santos; Gary Br()wn, captain of the 1964-1965 rakers; John Pel ton, captain during the 1961-1962 season; Ed Tyndall; and Toby Lustin, who holds the Garnet rebounding rerorrl fot· a single season. Fitz Turner, last year's third leading scorer and most improved player, goes up for two. knee. The loss of N eidel to a year abroad hurts the most. Bill was Union's leading rebounder last year and finished second in scoring with a 14.0 a\·erage. No Important Schedule Changes There ure no g1·eat changes in scheduling this year, though the Christmas tom·nament has been dt·opped. The addition of ICHC teams, St. Law- rence and Clarkson, means that the Garnet will meet all its ICAC opponents this year. The tough- est opposition should be provided by Williams, Kings Point, Wesleyan, Trinity, and Rochester. The Garnet open their schedule with a home game on December 3 at 8:00 against Pratt. This year's cagers have the potential to be a winning team and barring injuries and the kind of luck experienced by the 1966 Garnet gridders they ·should give Coach Evans a successful season. Soph Matmen Strong; AI Baskous Returns Coa,ch Bruce Allison, who saw his gra:pplers win five while losing two last ~ear, fig me,; with u littl~ htd;. ;,~ ha;; th~ malt>rial lo go -;.;) or 8-:! this year. He'll haH lu ma.k<:! up thuugh for the lo;:;s of Cuptain Fryt•, who fini:;heJ last year with an unbeaten 7~0 t·ecurd. Frye who wrestlerl at 145 last sea·son, will be lost to the Garnet when he undergoes a shoulder operation this December. Optimism Otherwise, C'oarh Allison has reason for optimism. Thre<> lettermen who had winning sea- sons are bark. Ron Iannotti, who was 6-1 last ~·ear, is set for the 130-pound class. Dave Read, !i-~ last r<>a.r, w:JI go at I 60 or 1 67. And ilarry r·nrn- 1\'all, who wa,; ii-1·1 last S(':Js•>n, is ready for 177. The return of ~l'nior AI Bas- kous, who ha·sn't wrestled since he was undefeated as a fresh- man, plainly excites AHison. \Vrest.ling as a freshman for Cniun, he wun at the \Vest Point Pl1•be Tournament. Sophomores Strong This year's promising sopho- mores more than earned the \promising\ designation by their last year's performance. Frank D'Antuono, who will go at 123- 130, has the most modest record of the group, and he only lost onre last year. Unbeaten as freshmen were this group: Jeff Karzius, prob- ably going at 123; Tom Tripp, headed for either 145 or 152; and Ken Merz, on tap for 167- pound class. Asidl? froin the loss of Frye, the only problems Allison has to contend with are some tough opponents and nothing in the 191-pound and heavyweight classes. to BiH Pomel'Oy. Pomeroy scored three times and gained 91 yards rushing, earning the Ralph H. Hue Award as the outstanding player for Hamilton in the game. Jim Ramich took the honor fo1· the Garnet. Utecht Connects In the second quarter Bob Utec'ht hit Sam Dill with a 33 ya1·d scoring pass, and Chris Cas- sels' extra point closed the gap. to 12-7. However the Continentals fought back and went ahead 17-7 when Pomeroy dove in from the one, A Union drive stalled as the fi1•st half came to a close. Early in the second half a iumbled punt gave Hamilton excellent field position, and they took advantage of the break as John Effinger slashed into paydirt from three yards out. Union retal- ia~ed quickly as Utecht and Dill hooked up again, th1s time for 60 yards. The offen·sive duet con- tinued as Hami'lton drove for their final score early in the fin·al stanza, with Pomeroy going in from 4 yards away. The Garnet ]()st a great op- portunity when Ramich, havi:ng his best game since King's Point, returned a kickoff ·to the Con- tinental's 19 yard line. Four plays \Vent nowhere and Hammon t(}ok over, ending Union's last threat. Hamilton finished 4•3 f()r lihe season. Seven Seniors This marked the final collegiate football game for seven Garnet seniors, led by captains Bob Marshall and Jim Ramich. Others included Chris Cassels, Frank Darmiento, Jim · DeNitto, Doug Horan, and Steve Roehm. .Coach Flood called the season disap.pointing, at- tributing much of the trouhles to -costly injuries which forced the Garnet to start a. .different line for every game since Kings P()int. :He commended the team f.or getting up to beat a fine RPI team, which closed out its season by- defeating Hobart and Rochester. Also the attitude was excellent for Williams where we played an excellent game for three periods, trailing only by a single point to the heavily favored Ephmen. Next Year Bright Coach Flood looks forward to next year when he will have a host of returnirtg lettermen, and excellent help from this year's fr()sh..
