Through The Looking Glass Apparently those of us who always believed that the primary purpose of a college was to edl!l.cate, to provide an intellectual atmosphere conducive to learning, have been sorely disillusioned, or perhaps those of us who came to Union thinking we were attending a college in an attempt to acquire an education were blindly misled. Mr. Walter Hochuli in his preliminary task force report on admissions attempts to clear up these long-standing misconceptions. He tells us that the purpose of a college or, more precisely, of Union is definitely not to educate; rather it is to develop, February 9, 1 Zola's •'Nana.'' Reviewed By Peter Letcourt The screen ver~ion of Emile Volas• nineteenth century cla~sic Nana, is cm·ently featured at The Scotia Art Theater. This famous story of a capricious Parisien girl who captivates the noblest -of men and leads them to destruction is admirably portrayed by Mat·tine Carol and Charles Boyei·. All .the opulenee and splendor of the times that Zola wrote of, .the striking realism and aristocratic depravity, the drama and the in- trigUes, are ca·ptured in a .highly literary film stY,le. It is the type of .film that one sees •l'arely these days: it is out of context with modern l-ife and is encased in a classical framework, like an ol<~ Dutch masterpiece. Conventional Cinematography Being- accustomed rto the new avant garde ltrend of cinema, With piece of art, it is in ,my opinion a bUccessful and interesting film.

To carry this argument to its .---------_,....----------....--,......--, logical, but we hope erroneous, conclusion, Mr. HochuJi Task Force Report: its fragmentary, photo.gr.aphic style, it is diffi- cult for the con- temporary view- er to criticize a film such as Nana. The mod- e<rn intellect is not very adapt- able to litera- tut·e per se; .the This weekend the Overseas Press ·Club and National Srtudent Association are jointly sponsoring the third annual Student Editors Cot1ference. Last year, the Con• cordy was named th.e b~st weekly ct~llege newspaper in the field of international news interpreta- tion. Coucordy has. sent rthree rep- l'esentatives to thE' conference and :has again.entered the competition. suggests that Union is not a college. We acknowledge Mr. Hochuli's concern for attracting the well rounded student or striving for geographical dis- tribution as important considerations in college admis- sions; however, we do not believe that the educational ·program ought to be subordinated to these purposes. Ideal- ly, the college should cater to the student who is both academically and socially superior. Unfortunately, this is not always possible. We firmly believe that to maintain the academic standing which Union has achieved in the past, the student of below average intelligence who is a leader, acceptable by Mr. Hochuli's standards, should be unacceptable by Union'~ standards. We are pleased that Mr. Hochuli is not opposed \to superior students as such''; neither are _we. As a matter of fact, their contributions help stimulate an intellectual environment at the college which is stagnated by Mr. Hocl;mli's leaders. Eventually, these students will further the college's name through their achievements in science, in college teachj.ng and in writing. At the present time, Union is advancing academically; the college is on the verge of adopting a long awaited Honors Program. Concurrently, President Davidson has proposed a radically new and exciting calendar, which pro- vides unheard of opportunities in the educational field. To publish and adopt Mr. Hochuli's task force report would mean setting the college back twenty years. We are grad- ually approaching an academic reputation similar to Wil- liams and Amherst. Let us not sacrifice it for a collection of well-rounded dullards. Furthermore; at one point in Mr. Hochuli's report, he stresses the importance of accepting a larger percentage of preparatory school graduates. He goes so far as to suggest that since Union could not attract the top quarter of the prep school class, we must accept men from the second and third quarters. Just before this statement, he stressed that \applicants should receive the same consid- eration whether from public High Schools or from private Preparatory Schools\ ; this is an obvious paradox. Does Union accept public school graduates in the second and third quarters of the class? No! Again thep., Mr. F1ochuli proposes sacrificing intelligence for social position or par- ental endowments, a detrimental sacrifice in our eyes. Currently both faculty and administration are pre- paring alternate statements on adrrllilsions which will be submitted to Mr. Hochuli's task force next month. We urge that these glaring errors in the original be immed- iately corrected. Means And Ends For a campus and Student Council presently inter- ested in the question of apathy, we suggest that they re- adjust their sights to a more basic and important issue, ethics. Tom Kriehbiel on behalf of the Modern Jazz So- . ciety presented a bid to the Student Council for Jazz Week- end, fully aware that it could never be fulfilled. To support the bid and insure its acceptance, he promised that Colum- bia Records would record the concert and offer an album \Thelonious Monk at Union\ (or some such appropriate title). To compound the offense, Kriehbiel preambled the bid by protesting that the other groups were allowed to bid for the Jazz weekend in the first place, claiming that only the Modern Jazz Society had the College's interests at heart and not personal gain. It is hard to see ~ow hav- ing the college \at heart\ is best served by presenting a bogus bid in the hope of its being accepted, and then pre- senting the campus with entertainment it had not chosen. Though the \Society\ might feel their private choice is the wiser, do the ends justify the means? Ad1nissions Policy world of ballroms and ~ueling is a long way from Main (State) St It is necessary to realize that we are dealing with the film i·nter- The following is a reprint of the preliminary report of the Task Force Committee on Ad- missions. The chairman of the committee, 1\IIr. Walter C. Hochuli, emphasizes that it is but a first draft and thus is subject to re- ,·ision. The article does not nee· essarily represent the opiniotls of the Editors, and is printed here for the information of the college community. ---- The Admissions task for a col- lege or univel'Sity can be simple or complicated de:pending on the l'esults sought. An admission of- ficer has no real problem if he seeks to fill a class with superior or highly talented students only. He merely lists all the applicants with their school and college board grades and accepts those who have achieved the highest marks. This should guarantee a graduating class four years hence of top rated scholastic marvels who may have contributed little to the college or their fellow stu- dents who have found a comfort- able resting place .for four years. Much of this co11ld have been done at home or through an ex- tension course with perhaps al- most as satisfactory results. How- ever, this does not seem to be a satisfactory method. Dr. Lee A. Burbridge, President of California Institute of Technology, in speak- ing to this point in his commence- ment address to Union College on May 28, 1961, said in this con\ nection-\Our nation sorely needs the trained talents. of such stu- dents. But, even here, we must always keep in mind that our basic purpose is not to train tal- ented men to serve the state-but to give the individual student the opporttmity to reach the highest levels to which his own talents and ambition can take him. It is the tenet of a free society that when that is done to the maxi- mum ·extent the nation, too, will be stronger and will .prosper.\ There is a much more difficult method to recruit an entering class and we use it at Union Col~ lege. We seek a class made up of a cross section of American youth-some supe.l'ior-some a-v- erage and perhaps a few below average as far .as scholarship goes;:. We tt•y however to bring in young men who have the po- tential qualities that we feel are needed in today's world-le11.ders, doers and those with creatiye and imaginative ability but who, in the overall, will show to the world that our fine facult}' has devel- oped, not just superVIsed, a super- ior production in young America. Unopposed to Intellectuals We are not opposed to superior student as such. We need and seek a certain number· of this type in every class to set a chal- lenge for others to show what can be done and how to do it better. We seek the well~rounded, well balanced boy; the ·boy who does most things well and is outstand- ing in a few things. We seek the boy whose scholarship. is. average or better; who is .a participant in extra curricular activiti!ls; whose personality and character are good and who indicates he can contribute to the college ai).d his classmates QY his pt•esence. Union College wants the boy who Will be a credit as ah undergraduate and as an alumnus and who will make a contribution to society and to his community.

Un- fortunately, at the present moment this· charge is well founded. The atmosphere currently pervading the campus can be detrimental to the college's image in the future if it has not been already; this blatant weakness must not be neglected when reassessing Union's direction for the next ten years. Although discussed by most people in the col- lege community, few have made any constructive sugges- tions to combat it. Messrs. Carman, Curtis and illlman h.ave made a noteworthy contribution to the war against anti-intellectualism through their preliminary task force report on \Cultural and Educational Activities Outside the Classroom.'' The Concordiensis heartily applauds the expanded lec- ture program proposed in the task force report. We haye always advocated an increased budget for the Lectures and Concerts Coqunittee. Such an increase would permit con- tracting well known speakers who would both stimulate the creativity latent in our faculty and student body and provide an important device for publicizing the academic offerings of the college. Likewise, an improved concert program, featuring reknowned artists as well as the tri-city symphony, will introduce some semblance of culture into our present balanced yet sterile environment. We are very much intrigued by the proposed introduc- tion of a \Writer in Residence\ program. This system has been used successfully at other colleges for many years. It would bring to the campus men of stature such as C. P. Snow, currently writer in residence at Weslyan, or William Golding, spending the current academic year at one of the southern universities. Meetings which these men would have with students during their terms of residence would contribute imm~asurably to the educational experiences of impressionable minds while also adding substantially to the prestige of the college itself. Yet we question the prac- ticality of instituting a program which can only operate at a cost equal to the entire budget of the Lectures and Concerts Committee. · Messrs. Carman, Curtis and Ullmann are to be com- plimented for guiding Union in the direction of a healthy intellectual gruwlh. Their task force report d~serves care• ful consideration from the Trustees. We urge tbii,t the necessary increases pr0posed be granted at the earliest pm;siblf' moment. . Apathy At Honte Before the Student Council begins searching high and wide for student apathy, let them merely glance at some of the more prominent and conspicuous members of the campus; those found (occasionally) at IFC meetings. Last Tuesday two shortcomings became apparent when no member would nominate a fellow \house president\ for Secretary of the body. Either the \house presidents\ have little regard for each other, or the fact that only nine out of the seventeen were present, caused this difficulty. As a result, elections had to be postponed until the follow- ing meeting. Whether or not the council members care for each other is of little importance, but the fact that only nine saw fit to attend the meeting is not. President Rappaport, cog- nizant of the deplorable situation, attempted to rectify it by suggesting that fines would be levied jf members per- sisted in not attending meetings. Although this is one meth- od of combating the apathy, it is indeed an imma'ture one. It wuulJ: be wiser and mot·e mature to follow the lead of several other colleges and universities where it is felt that if studenls, or their representatives don't feel meetings are important, then they don't deserve a voice in campus affairs. In most of these campuses the councils have sub- sequently been disbanded.

Intrcduction of two concerts by the Tri-City S~mphony and two by outstand- ing chamber ~nsembles like the Juilliard Quartet and the Vienna Octet. The College is fortupate in having the Tri-City Symphony in the area and fm·tunate, too, in its assQciation with the Schenectady Museum, without whose :coopera- tion a comparable series would cost us three times as much as the present series~ An increased app1ropriation is needed, howe-ver, to :'provide more rehearsal time fot· the orchestra, to pay the ·ris- ing cost of guest chamber music ensembles, and to secure better• known guest SC)]oists to perform with the orchestra. It seems generally agreed that in the next decade Unh:m College will have to compete with a great- ly expanded and well-financed sys- tem of public higher education in New York State. One .of the least expensive ways in which the Col- lege can meet t!'1is challenge is to pt·ovide an outstanding pt•ogram of cultural and educational activi- ties outside the classroom. Such a program will help to create the kind of intellectual atmosphere found somewhat wanting at Union according to' the Middle States Evaluation Report of 1957. An o1,1tstanding program of lectures and coneerts will also enable Un- ion's friends to take pride in the fact that the- College attracts to its campus some of the most dis- tinguished men of our time. II. The All•College Program A. Lectures: ·1. Speakers at college convoca- tions, as distinct from others who from tjme to time speak to small groups on campus, ought to ful- fill these essential requirements: ( 1) they should speak on topics that will appeal to the whole Col• lege community, or at least to a large segment of it (specialized talks, no matter how distinguished, ought not to be a part of this all- college lecture Sel'ies); {2) they should be outstanding men in their field; and ( 3) if at all possible, they should be well known. With the exception of some men in pub- lic office who refuse to accept an honorarium, speakers of the kind desired charge from $300 to $1000, bring three or four such men to the College each semester at an average fee of $500. We have in mind men like Robert Frost, John Gunther, Norman Cousins, Thorn~ ton Wilder, James Conant, and Arnold Toynbee. Once we had an excellent lecture series, it would be easier to attraCJt other distin- guished speakers whose services probably could not be bought. Re- cently William Golding, well- known on campus because many students had read one of his nov- els for Freshman Orientation, spoke at a convocation and at- tracted a crowd that· overflowed the chapel. There is every reason to believe that a high,Jevel pro- gram would regularly achieve similar satisfactory results. Proposes Distinguished Visitors 2. We propose that, in addition, each year four distinguished visi- tors be brought to the campus for an extendE'rl petiod of from thr<\e days to a week or more. The av- enige honorarium for such a vis- it would be $1000. The visitors, of course, would normally be men drawn from a wide variety of fields. A:lthough we would ordi- nal'ily ask them to address a con~ vocation, their main purpose woul-d be to provide intellectual stimulation through a varfety of informal di~cussions with stu- ilPnt;;. Our survey of other col- 2. The musical life ·of the Col• lege would be greatly enriched if we could present at a convocation one major recitalist each year- someone like Rudolph Serkin or Isaac Stern. Such international- ly famous musicians would prob- ably be willing to' perform before a college audience for abo)lt $2000. 3. Approximately $ 2 0 0 0 is needed to support the remaining musical events in the College pro- gram. At present two small cham• her music concerts are .given each year. The demand has been such that this Serenade Series ought to be increased to four and improved. The College organ recital seties also needs more money if it is to offer first-rate organists. C. Films: The present series of ten Film Classics costs only $600. An in- crease to $750 is all that is needed to .provide an outstanqing series. D. Publicity: Campus publicity, primarily posters, will cost about $500. E. At·rangements: J.t has been the custom of the Lectures and Concerts Co]1lmlttee, whenever possible, to bring to- gether students and visiting lec- turers of musicians, U sally this has involved luncheon:s, dinners, and receptions at fraternity hous- es or Hale House paid for by the Committee. If guests are to re- main on campus for longer per- iods of time, appl'Q:ximately $1000 will be needed. F. Proposed Budget: 8 lectures per year at $600 4 vjsits per year at $1000 U.C.-Sehenectady Museum 1 major recital Othet: musical events (Serenade Series, -oi:'· gan recitals, etc.) lO films at $75 Publicity Arrangements $4000 $4000 $2000 $2000 $ 750 $1000 $100() TOTAL $16,250 This sum is slightly more than 0.5</o of the total Ci>llege budget. Since salaries for musicians~ hon- !)raria for lectures, and fooq :for dinners and receptions are likely to rise along with other dsts, it is recom~ended that ~ fixed per- centage of the College budget be appropriated rather t~n a fixed amount Of money.

Salisbury of the New Yol'!i 1~imes <\iscussed .the cunent liberalizu- ~ion· of restrictions in the U.S.S.R. Salisbury has just 1;eturned ftom Russia, and he recently w1·ote a series of articles fe>l' the Time~-; describing the .changE's in that country. Restdefions Rcmcved According to Salisbury, the most strildng chan!Fe has been the removal of restrictions· on the dis- patches filed by foreign con·es\ pondents. Previous. to last yea I', they had to submit all theii· arti- cl'es. to a Russian censor fot· clear- ance, often having articles chang- ed almost beyond recognition. Since PTemier Khrusche:v abolish- ed. this censorship, an entirely ditferen.t atmosphere has .prevail- ed in Moscow, Because of the new competition· between Western and Communist journalists for news, the Russian· press has adopted many of the worst chacacteristks of til~ Western press such !lS sen- sationalism and the printing of .rumors., Russia .Being- Westentized Although papers like :lsYestia have adopted the mrore unsavory aspects of western journulism, Salisbury still considers the change as a hopeful sign. He regards it as the start of the breaking down of the Puritanism of the tradi- tional Communist way of think- ing. Salisbury feels th~t the Westernizing of Russia will con- tinue as long as K:hruschev re- mains in power. Although Khruschev is now firmly entrenched in power, there always exists· the possibility that he will sruddenly die. In that case, Salisbury forsees a vast power, struggle between tbose who wish to continue the liberalization and those who feel that tht Khruschev doctrine r e pres e n t s a heresy against the Ma\rxist gospel as .preached by Lenin, Stalin, and Mao-Tse-Tung'. In this struggle; the balance of power will likely be held by the group of rising young bureaucrats who prese:ntly en- dorse the ideas of Khruschev hut who .in t'eality hold \'iews 'that at·e unknown to any obse1·vers. htlei'Pt'etation ·of Docb·ines The conflict between the Stal- inists and Khrusohev seems to this reporter to be ana,lygous to the ctinent reviva'l of the Radi- ral Right in the United States. Both the Uightists and the Stal- inists represent themselves as the ad~·ocates of .the true doctrine as revealed respectively· in the the Amet<ican Constit]ltion and the Communist Man i fe s t·o. Both gt•oups rega1:d the rulers of their country as appeasers who surrendering the count1·y .piece piece to the enemy, If either Rightists or the Stalinists contt,ol of their country, We can look forvmrd to the increased ·pos- sibility of nuclear war. Hope Remains It seems that our best hope for ~king an agreemnt with. the Rus~ia:ns .for world peace lies in the continuation· of the Khrusche:v approach in Russia. If we stem the tide of Communist advance in Africa and Asia by such method's ns the· operation in the Congo, the Russians wUl finally 1·each the conclusion that their Ideology is not in-vincible as they now seem to think it is. With the rise of a clamor among the Ru:?sian peo- ple for democratic reforms, the U.S.S.R. might eventually be Westemized enough to put an end to the struggle between it and the United States. Perhaps then all the countries could turn all their energies into a renewe-d cold war \vith Reci China. \Pas~ionate Summer\ the .wide- ly .proclaimed film triumph, will be featured this evening in E.

After completing Underwood's management, training program,· the men we choose will be assigned to sales and marketing work, mainly in the United States but in some cases over- seas. From this area they may progress to key management. positions, at a rate dictated by their individual performances.

The Swiss team, which will appear in the conflict-ridden world championships to be held in. Colerado next month, will 'tangle with a squad composed of · former college all-stars, many of whom still play cempetitively in · var·ious industrial leagues in this country and Canada. . The particulars concerning this special ice event reached our desk via a note from George H. Fox, a prominent local alumnus and an active pa1oticipant in campus and civic affaks~ George informs us that the contest is sponsored by the Troy Lions Club for the benefit of its aid to the blind and .sight con:servation program, a most worthy cause in any man's league. The Swiss play a fast-skating, wide open, little bodychecking of hockey, typical of the style of European puck-chasers, a contrast to the slower, tougher-checking Americans. We highly recommend the game to anyone interested in hockey, a dead- letter at Union College thes!'l days. It also provides a good show to chase away those Sunday-afternoon-after-Wint!=r Weekend blues, as well. While on the subject of hockey, we might answE'r those avid blade fans who are plugging for a re).iival of hockey at Union.

The Garnet matmen had their crease of more than 100 ballots the last election. ..: season recot•d levelled at 3-3 following a loss to undefeated Clarkson The m:dn consideration, is, of course, financial. T.he athletic budget as it stands right now could never bear the burden of such a program, and the chance of such a )luge increase in the athletic allottment is beyond reason. The expenses involved are staggering when one considers the .playing facilities alone. Outdoor rinks are highly unsatisfactory and installing ice in Memorial Field House is out of the question financial-ly . ..Add the costs, of equipment, upkeep, and the procurement of a skilled coach, and even the most fanatical booster~ of such an undertaking would abandon the project immed- iatel-y.

This disappointing record, however, is not indicative of the squads ac- tual potential. Several outstand- ing performances were made in losing efforts against formidable opponents such as Rochester and Vermon.

By Peter Lefcourt Soon to be showing in SchenEe~ tady is the exciting new Portu- guese film import, La Casada Infiel (The Unmade Bed). Tllis sensitive and engrossing film is an allegorical adaptatwn of a dra- matic poem by the famous Por- tuguese poet Fi'ay Luis de Leon, and it has been accl'aimed us a new dimension in film making. Caused Major Controversy , La Casada Infiel has caused a major controversy among film critics in Europe ai1d especially in he kills Julia in a fit of madness. The camera brings to light in a lyrical and sE!Ilsual style. the rich beauty of Leon's poem. There are sequences . of exceptional sen- sitivity and poetic splendor; es- pecially those of Manuel's mad- ness when the cam.era becomes purposely vague and surereaiistic. Also of note is a tremendous un- derwater scene where the camera follows Julia's sham baptism. Andrew Ac-ker. Gilbert Bell. Arnold Berkowitz. Brad Bockra.ber, Edward Brynes. Wayne Butler. J. c.

'A r€aS<>nable amount of this information will be. contained in the final report. Poetic Fantasy The film operates in the realm of poetic fantasy in a subtle and symbolic manner. Manuel, the hero, LS a modern day Saint Eli- vita who travels over the coun- tryside converting people with his mag1cal powers. Like the patron saint of Mancosa, Manuel is blind in both eyes and relies entriely on his smile to guide him. He is offered his sight back by a. beau- tiful peasant girl, Julia, on the conditiOn that he sacrifices his chastity to her. Manuel seeks the advice of an old hermit, Gu- tierre (Mordecai of Cadiz in the legend), who pleads with him to remain blind. The temptation of the saint drives him insane, and The splendid photography of Otega de FGalla has earned the film the award of \Most Inspir- ing Film\ at the Prague Film FestivaL Previously, d!l Falla ha:s distinguished himself with such films as El Amor Brujo (The Car- nation) 'and ~ La Alta de Dios (The Spoon of God). He has been quoted as saying this about La Casada Infiel: \I have attempted to capture some of the magni.:fi- cance of 'The Temptation of Saint Blivita' on the screen; it has been a difficult task. All I have :re- ceived for my efforts is a bushel of complaints and self-righteous moral judgments. It's the 'do- gooders' who are mucking up this world.'' By the way, do you have any idea of where the·center of U.S. population w~s in 1790 ?

It is not to be avoided. nor, cer- tainly ~vould yuu try to a\·oid it. Boys must grow into men. The \\'orld must move. You are glad to have your boy able to ~tart out under auspices so propitious as his may be. But vuu han• a right to certain fears, certain com- punctions·. in regard to the step your boy has taken. You han' a right to worry. though worry ne'er mended anvwrong. A thousand times has it been said that college is ·a new experience, occasionally. a dangerous experience for bovs. Xut knowing colleges, or the men in them, it may be vo~ mav distrust tlw unknown. That is perfectly na- tur~l. Cert:~inlv vour bov is \up against\ something new- new freedom. ;lt.'w rt•spo.nsibilities. new endeavors, and new cham·e:-;. Ht• i,.; perhap~ \on his own\ as he never has bee.n before. Therl'fore. it may be good here. editorially, to say a few things ab11Ut what eollege really is. and what college reallv is not. Then' are a great many fallacies about college. a great many more fallacies of an unpleasant nature. Fnr vt>ars the college man and the college atmos- phere haw been ridicuh•d by the public prints, and the public temper. Collegt' men have for years been considered deficient ineertain qunlities. extravagant in certain defeds. At one tinw thesl' aL·cusations and beliefs may have b€en grounded nn fact. though WL' personally doubt it greatly. That is what a mllege is: A college is a great hot-beci, enelusl•d in the sun-warmed glass of wisdom, for bringing into bloom the best that is in young manhood. Here--let us sa v at L'nion-is the sheltt>r. the cultivation, the under- standing. that ean and will develop to its utmost whatever best 11uality our son has. If he has it in him to grow up sturd~· and strong and fine, here he will do it. If he has it not. here he will be ::->helkred far more than in the out- side world. and sonw bloom nf worth may come with the shelter. t'nfort unatdy. weeds grow rankest in the best soil. But of L'uurst• vour son is not that weed; and further- mort>. that \\n·d and all thP othPrs are soon rotted out by l'areful gardeners. College puts fme things in a man's heart and in a man's way. College gives a man the four years of all his life that he will hPst remember. College does many other things. such as teaching a man Greek roots and the elec- tron thPoQ'. Bt•st of all eullege takes a man to itself, and makes him a real part uf a tradition. an insitution, a place and a naml' that have a human heart. Here are a few thing-s that college is not: College is nut a drinking dub. Collegl' is not a herd of simpering, flag-flapping lunatics. Collt>ge is nut a profaner prep school. Best of all. eollege is not a retreat for grinds. But it dm·s little good to tell you mothers what college is not. You will be far more interested in what it is, and that we an: glad to have been able-in part-to tell you. :Mothl•rs uf 1965. you needn't fear for your boy. -f~nU'ordiensi!>;, St'ptember 23, 1916 It ,.\in't ~ ecessarily So • • In atTord W!tll thl· fL·stive spirit rabid on campus, t hl' Corwordi .. n-.i.., has tried a new. or in many cases old, expNiment in Jollnmlism. sensationalism.

By Peter LefcoUl't Soon to ht• ~lwwi'!Lg in Sehenec- tady i::; the ex,·iting new l'ortu- gue,;e film im pol t, La ('as ada Infiel l Tlw C nntadl• lled). This sensitive and eng1 o,;sing film is an allegorical uda!JlaLon of a dra- matic poem by the famous Por- tuguese J11•et Fray Luis dt• LeuH, and it has lwc•Jl at·c:lainll'd a~ a new dimen,;ion in film making. Caused :\lajor Controve1·sy La Casada lnfid ha~ t'a\!lsed a major eontrovt>rs~· among film l'L·ities in Europe und espet•·ially in Lisbon w h e r e it was produced. Tht• Portuguese ehurch is up in a r m s against what it calls \the lieentiutls splattering of he kill~ Julia in a fit of madness. Th~ camera brings to light in a lyl'ital and ::;ensual styie the li rich beauty of Leon's poem. There are sequences of exceptional sen-~ sitivity and poetic splendor; es- pecially those of Manuel's mad- ness when the ca1nera become,; put pu:sely vague and surereali::;tic. Also of note is a tremPndous un- . derwate1· scene whel'e the eamem I follows Julia's sham baptism. 1 I don't care how much it SIHn' s - I'm n()t cancelling any classes. u n tram me led imagery and poetic depravi- .. l'E't·haps tlw most disappointing I a,;peet of tlw film is the way it f trPat,; Manw·l's c-apitulation. Hr~n· 1 t:·e allec;ory basl'd on Leon's poem ! l'IHI=<. Whereas Saint Blivita was ~· suppu,.;t•d to have smilt>d benignlv 1 at hi,; tormentors, Manuel l>€- t•onws active and adamant ami los<'s his ,;aint-lil<e composure. I I feel that this dE.'tral'ts from the integrity of the film and giws it ~ a cheap sc·nsationulism that does ' not mix with the poetry of tht· rest of the production.

A student who feels that his \F\ grade reflects other than \ap- propriate a c a d e rn i c criteria\ (achievement and proficiency in the subject) may petition the Academic Senate to have that grade re\iewed. The petition must be filed not later than the end of the regular semester following the semester in which the grade was received. Investigation Follows The case will then be investi- gated by the dean of the partic- ular college in which the student is enrolled. His findings will be reported to the Committee on Courses and Instruction and this ~ommittee will decide whether the failing grade was deserved or not. The \F\ grade may be changed to the grade \passed\ by the com- mittee, but units obtained in this way will not be counted in calcu- lating the student's grade point average. However, the student will not have to repeat the course. Creighton Case Cited This amendment may be used in instances like the Jim Creigh- ton case, which has been before the Academic Senate since lagt year. Creighton filed a petition claiming his \F\ grade received in military science last year was a punitive measure because he participated in an anti-compul- sory ROTC picket line while wear- ing an ROTC uniform. The congregation of a church in Dereham, England, was correct in reporting it smelled something \fishy.\ The odor came from a 13-pound pike the choirboy had hidden in the vestry for safekeeping .

The College Health Service should participate in a pro- gram of health education for students. The man whom Union Colege has chosen to honor on this Founder's Day is Henry Wager Halleck, class of 1836. Halleck en- tered Union as a lower Junior i'll May of 1834 and left after three very successful terms to enter the West Point Military Academy on July 1, 1835. He was made a 2nd Lieutenant in the Corps of Engi- neers in 1839 after graduaJting seeond in his class and for two years was a professor of chemis- try at West Point. In 1848, he was offered a professonhip in en- gine-ering- at the Lawrence Scien- tinr S~:hool of Harvard Univ8'l'sity which he declined. (Continued from Page 2) purpose and size, and with com- parable student activities and fi- nancial resources. We believe that one of the major attractions to prospective students and par-, ents in a small college, is atten- tion to the individual. The Health 1 Service play,; an important role I 8. It is strongly recommended that the College proceed with all deliberate speed to inaug- urate a plan for compulsory health and accident insurance for students. This will make it possible for each member of the student body to re- cein• approximately the same health benefits through the in such attention, providing a family due tor type of service that I 9. is available to students on both a 1 regular and emergency basis. I The meding of student health needs by the Health Service should haYC overriding priority in and planning for the future. Only after these requirements ha\'e been met to the best of the ability 1 of the College ,;houlJ there lx- any consideration of enlarging the II scope of the activities of the Health Scrvi(C Staff. The Ameri- 1 can college Health Association I recommend::; as an absolute mini-~ mum that one full-time physician be provided for no more than every 1,000 :~tudents. The antici- 1 pated enrollment of the College I within the next decade is 1200 to 1300 student:>. It is expected that j1o. this overload can be absorhed, but 1 any additional demands made of the Health Service will necessar- ily require additional staff and facilities. The Task Force has noted that in larger institution:> health serv- ice benefits and activities are fair- ly well standardized. No such standards have yet emerged in 1 smaller institutions, though the American College Health As- 11. soeiation is working toward this goal. The problems in smaller colleges are fundamentally the same as in larger institutions, and we have looked, therefore, to some of the larger colleges for guidance. We believe that it is possible for Union College to provide coverage for basic health needs such that compari- son with these other colleges will be very satisfactory. Recommendations 1. Recognizing the difficulties involved in composing a docu- ment such as the Basic As- sumptions, the Task Force feels that the omission of any reference to the health needs of students should be cor- rected. We suggest, there- fore, the addition of a state- ment to the effect that the College proposes to provide as healthful an em-ironment as , College. The Health Service should avoid, as far as possible, bill- ing extra charges for labora- tory tests, specialists fees and X-ray charges to par- ents. If, the cost to the col- lege of such essential medi- cal care exceeds the financial resources available to thE' Health Senke, it is suggf.'st· ed that a ceiling for such services in a given year be set and that this ceiling hl' carefully explained through information literature distri- buted by the Health ~rvice to students· and their parents. It is expected that the Col- lege Physician will exercise his judgment in specific cases. It is recognized that many colleges the size of Union do not employ even one full- time college physician, or pro,ide as much nursing care by registered nurse, but the Task Force is convinced that staffing of the Union College Health Service is absolutely minimal in view of what is being provided in health care on this campus. It is recommended that a to- tal of 6,000 or 7,500 sq. feet of space be made available to enable the Health Service to provide more adequately for the needs of students. This would include additional bed capacity, larger and more adequate examination and treatment facilities, space for isolation of contagious cases, and staff offices. The Task Force has had an opportunity to review in de- tail the health service plans of ofuree buildings which have been erected by colleges the size of Union in very recent years. These buildings, which · the Task Force considers po- tentially appropriate for the College, were put in service at Hobart and William Smith Colleges (Cost $95,000 with funds raised by subscriptions (Continued on Page 6) R!>signed in 1854 Halleck resigned from the army and settled in California in 1854. While still in the army, he was· on the commission to form and draw up a constitution for the State of California where he had set-ved as secretary of state un- der three territorial governors. In private life, Halleck was a Coun- sellor at Law in San Francisco, the president of the Pacific and Athn~ic Ra'ilroad, and an author of works on mining, military sci- ence, international law, and laws of warfare.
