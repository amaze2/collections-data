A•lvjsor A New Frontier The Lectures and Concerts Committee is to be con- gratulated on providing the campus with the outstanding lectures heard this semester. Yet there is still much to be desired. Although each individual speaker stimulated campus discussion, his influence waned quickly. What the campus needs is a prolonged period of stimulation, as would have been provided by either the Focus Program or the \All india Week\ project. Although the Focus Program has been described be- fore, few students are familiar with the \India Week,\ pro posal. Its purpose was to take an area of the world, India in this case, and invite a number of renowned speakers to lec- ture to the student body on the many aspects of its way of life: cultural, religious, intellectual, educational, social, and the like. The hope was not to rnake every student an expert on India, but to provide the campus as a whole with an insight into the lives of a people so remote from us in cus- tom and outlook as the Indians are. Unfortunately the program had to be dropped because of insufficient funds. The Student Council is in a position to alter this situ- ation considerably. The S.C. demonstrated through its strong support of the Focus Program its willingness to engage in an intellectual endeavor of this magnitude. It weN.t S() far as to raise the Sttldent Tax in order to guar- antee financial support for \Focus.\ If the Council would now take up the cause of the \India Week\ program, it could begin what might result in the greatest of Union's traditions. It already possesses the funds and potential leadership necessary for the task. A hybrid mixture of the Focus .Program and the \In- dia Week\ plan could be arranged, advanced research and planning being done by students under the direction of Faculty members prior to the actual week. Inherent in the plan is the possibility of inviting students from other schools to share 'this cultural experience with us, and so spread Union's reputation. Wh~teve:r the eventual shape of the program, its pos- sibilities of design are limitless and its potential value great. The Student Council should begin working closely with the Lectures nad Concerts Committee in an attempt to bring the as yet unfulfilled dreams of these two organi- zations to fruition. The Right Direction Jt'ratemities are not about to leave the Union College campus, hence the only constructive work that can be done is in helping to improve the present situation. No one r:e- alizes this more than Ken Payment, President of the Inter- fraternity Council. With the support of a more vigorous IFC than hal) been evidenced in the past, he is well on his way, and the fraternities on theirs, to eliminating some of the criticism now levied against them. This semester has evidenced an active interest by the fraternities in cultural and intellectual affairs, the area in which they've taken the most abuse. Phi Sigma Delta in- itiated this change with the institution of a facu1ty lecture, with an \honorarium\ going to the library fund in the faculty members name. Delta Chi followed their lead with the recent debate on the Sino-Indian conflict presided over by Professor Feguson of U,uion's History Department, and Mrs. Icharya of Skidmore £ollege. The most recent and potentially important step -however, indicating a broaden- ing of this interest, was demonstrated at the IFC meeting Tuesday evening. Payment brought forth the suggestion that the IFC sponsor a weli known lecturer in conjunction with the Lectures and Concerts Committee. To finance the venture they intend to .run Jazz Weekend ·as another minor prom, and use tij~,proceeds towards this end. <'- Should the ~C finally support this suggestion they would not only enhance the cllltural atmosphere at Union, but would gain new respect for fraternity life in general. Special Kind of Rhythm By Thomas Krehbiel There is one easily observable fact about jazz which has caused much consternation in the jazz world for the past sixty-five years: the overabundance of mem- bers of the Negro l'ace among the music's creators. The usual conclusions drawn from this bit of empiricai evidence are that jazz is a raciai music and that the.1'>legro race has a nat]:lral inclination for jazz.making. The purpose of this article is to . investigate more closely the val-idity of these con- clusions and, if possible, to pro- pose a more suitable solution to the problem. lf ability in jazz is, in truth, proportional to pigmentation, it should be very easy to pinpoint centers of jazz around the world. One would be the entire African Continent and another would be the Aust1·alian Bush. Contrary to this assumption we find that Jazz not only has not developed spon- taneously in these places, but l).as not even made any significant in- roads in these places after it was developed elsewhere. The place where jazz would hardly be ex- pected to flourish, according to the \black music\ theory, wou'ld be in Europe, least .of aH in the Scandanavian countries. The facts concerning this matter are just the opposite, however. Stan Getz and Oscar Pettiford, both major jazz figures, moved to Denmark to find a better atmosphere for living and playing. Trumpeter Benny Bailey has emigrated to Sweden where Harry Arnold leads his big band made up almost en- tirely of native Swedes. Bud Pow- ell, Lucky Thompson, Don Byas, and Kenny Clarke all now reside in France (the latter may be seen drumming in the recent movie Les Liasons Dangereuses. Of the above named musicians, approxi- mately seventy percent ar~ Ne- groes who felt more musical'ly at home among the Ofays in Europe than with their \little brothers\ in Africa. Having completed our survey of color as related to coolness, we properiy should tum to a cortsid- eration of the art-form itself. Jazz has three basic elements: melody, harmony, and rhythm. It would be pertinent to find the sources of each of these elements with re- spect to white or black origin. One of t·he first melodic devices recognizable as peculiar to jazz was fhe blue note. These resulted mainly from the inability of the Negro of years gone by to alter his musical thinking perfectly from the pentatonic scale to the European eight note scale used in the hymns taught him by the mis- sionaries. The important thing to notice here is that the European scale was the one used in the ear- ly blues and jazz, and that these forms resulted not from African melodic notions but from Euro- pean melodies modified when nee~ essary for ease in singing. Harmony in jazz is almost ex- dasively European. In African music even today wher:e natives have remained untouched by alien music; chords are produced only as accidental meeting points of different lines of melody. If one wants to hear some really jazz- like harmonies in pre-jazz music, one had best go to Bach and his contemporaries. Anyone who has the slightest working knowledge of music can demonstrate this to himself by playing in chord form the arpeggios which make up the first prelude from Bach's Well- Tempered Clavichord. Perhaps a better case can be made for the rhythmic influence of African music on jazz, but even here there are certain disparities. Jazz is a measured music and its structme depends upon fixed beats occurring in i'hythmic patterns. Af'rican drumming simply does not break down into a structured rhythmic music. Jazz rhythms are clo~er to olU world marches, quadrilles, and polkas. There is as much of the sound of jazz. (as Barry Ulanov states) in gypsy fiddling as in a corps of African drummers. Where does all of this leave us? we still appear to have the unan- (Contirtued on Page 4) Frats Publish Clauses The Board of Trustees Of tufts Cniversity last week ·passed a re,;ulution reql!iring frate!·nities and sororities with dis.criminatory clause,; to define these r!ausPs.

Despite the fact that this is a college newspaper, it is not the g.eneral policy of this column to comment on campus issues. One ~·eason for this is simply that there reaUy aren't that many cam- pus issues which are worth devot- ing twelve column inches to, something I've been trying to tell my editors fm: two years now. But more to the point is that curious perspective of history whkh makes today'S campus frenzy look Pl'etty picayune by press time. This wee'k, we will make an exception :for a special purpose ... that of praise. On Monday, the last morning. convocation of the first semester was held. I think it is obvious that the quality of convocations has risen immeasur- ably in the last four years. The speak~rs who ap- peared during the first semester form a sharp con- trast to the lecture offerings in my freshman year. Perhaps the newcomers to the college are not acquainted with the former sys- te:m, so I wil:l fill them in on s.ome background material. A Poor Show Four yeaTs ago, convocations were held twice a week and in the evenings at odd intervals. Each student was required to at- tend twenty of these little. gath- erings, but credits could also be garnered by attending the Film Qlassics Series and by .going to chap,el .on Sunday evenings. Most of the convocations were han- dled- by the ·dif:Eerent co-llege.:.ae- tivities with a prominent speaker thrown in amidst football team introducti0ns, singing pi·ograms, and everything else bu,t talking dogs. The effect of -this wide range .of quality was grudging attendance on the part of a stud- ent body only intent on getting their chapel credits.

Students ha~e rare- ly demonstrated any interest in college policy or any knowl- edge upon which to base~srich an interest. The college has fostered this situation b,)L thEf .secre~y, or rather lack of. explanation accompanying the ·majority of its decisions. This is true of both the Faculty and the Administration. The present situation is not detrimental when concern- ing financial policy or the like, for the student has both a limited view of the facts and inexperience in dealing with these matters. But this does not negate the value of an informed student body. At present the lack ·of information prevents the students from developing any real interest in campus affairs. This results iJ;l. the student's accepting the rules as being forced.~on hirn, rather than feeling he is intimately connected :~ith them, through sharing in a knowledge of their dewJopment. The Student Council may go far in alleviating this problem. At their meeting 'Tuesday night, it was announced that students had be.en iippointed to faculty committees. The potential benefits of this system. are many-fold. By a~tending faculty meetings the students have the oppor;. tunity to witness at first hand wnat is belrind new policy revision, and what a motion's passage implies. This seleCt group of students thus forms a chain of communication between the faculty and the 'Student body at large.

I was very distressed at this in- adequacy and set my mind worlc- ing to make this modest proposal to you. It appears to me tha:t there is no reason why the Ad- missions Dept. at Union could not consider our futUl'e incoming class- es on the basis of alphabetic;ll distribution. Let me elaborate on this point. In essence, this method of ad- mission would solve many of the present college problems. Firstly, it would eliminate the scandalous situation of favoritism which in- clines the college to be prejudiced in favor of the letter \S\. Such a disgrac~ should not !>e permitted to conlinue. We .advmtise our~ ;;;elves as a well-bahmced college, and if this plan is put into oper- ation we will fulfill our goal 100%. Secondly, this .proposal would eliminate those nasty rumors which have been floating around about ulterior motives and sur~ i'eptitious criteria which affect our present admission policy. For ex- ample, the letters \0\ and \X\ would insure at least two dozen Irish and Black Muslims in resi· dence at Union (We might see how well this plan worked in the recent presidential -election. There never was a president whose name began with ·\K\-nor with \N\ which explains the closeness of the balloting-anP, as exemplary of our democratic processes we must note it could have been a ;Katz or Kowalski as well who was the victor,) . Thb:dly, an a,dm~ssions_pplicy of this type would go a long way to solving our fraternity pr,oblern (if we concede one exists.)

AT PRATT & WHITNEY AIRCRAFT ..• YOUR EYES CAN BE ON THE STARS BUT YOUR FEET MUST BE ON THE GROUND The glamour and excitement of space age programs often obscure a fundamental fact. It is simpl)- that farsightedness must be coupled with sound, practical, down-to-earth engineering if goals an: to be attained. This is the philosophy upon which Pratt & Whitney Aircraft's position as a world leader in flight propulsion systems has been built. Almost four decades of solid engineering achievement at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft -can be credited to management's conviction that basic and applied research .is l!ssential to healthy progress. In addition to concentrated research and development efforts on advanced gas turbine and rocket engines, new and exciting effects are being explored in every field of aerospace, marine and industrial power application. The challenge of the future is indicated by current programs. Presently Pratt & Whitney Aircraft is exploring the areas of technical knowledge in magnetohydrodynamics ... thermionic and thermo- electric conversions ... hypersonic propulsion .. .fuel cells and nuclear power. (Author of \1 H'as a Teen-age Dwarf\ \The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis\ etc.) HIGH TEST, LOW TEST, NO TEST Just the other night I was saying to the little woman, \Do you think the importance of tests in American colleges is being overemphasized?\ (The little woman, incident!llly, is not, as you m~ght think, my wife. My wife is far from a .tittle woman. She is, in fact, almost se\~en feet high and heavily muscled. She is a full-blooded Chiricahua Apache and holds the world's hanuner-thro:w record.

But I digress. \Do you think the importance of tests in American colleges is being overemphasi;oed?\ I said the other nig}lt to the little woman, and then I said, \Yes Max, I do think the importance of tpsts in American colleges is being overemphasized.\ (As I have explained, the little woman does not speak, so when we have convetsations, I am forced to do IJoth parts.)

Will the world-so desperately in need of talent-eyer henefit from Gregor's great gifts? Alas, no .. He is in college to stay. But even more tragic for mankind is the caRe of Arina Livia Plurabelle. Anna Livia, a classmate of Gregor's, had no talent, no gifts, no brains,. n,o personality. All she had was a knack for taking tests. She would cram like crazy before a test, 1Ilways get a perfect score, and then premptly forget everytlling she had learned. Natui·ally, she graduated with\highest honors and degrees by the dozen, but the sad fact is that she left college no more educated, no more prepared to cupe with ·the world, than Y.·hen she entered.
