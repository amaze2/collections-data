During a twenty-five year career, he has played a conspicu~ ous role in every major davelopment in contemporary mueic. Getz was born in Philadelphia in 1927. At thirteen, he became a mem- ber of his Junior High School band playing bass, h-Msoon and finally sax- ophone. Two years later, he had acquired a mastery of the sax. By the time he was eighteen, he had played in such outstanding orchestras as those of Phil Harris, Stan ~enton, Jimmy Dorsey and Benny Goodman .. The latter main- tains that Getz is the finest tenor sax- ophonist of all time. Wi11s Poll For the next four years, Getz helped in forming the now legendary Four Brothers. It was during th.is time that he recorde~ his classic solo on ~! , \Early Autumn.' In 1949, he won his I first major poll as top tenor man of l the year . Having completed his \apprentice- ! ship,\ Getz proceeded to form his own •1 gl'OUps. The first Getz album, entitled i \The Long Island SoUI)d\ became a part of th.·e standard jazz repertoire. Getz, in his twenties, had become, ac~ a ,,according to Nat Hentofl', \One of the most vital influences in this country and in Eur(}pe. His tour of Sweden was a trillmph such as few musicians in any field have expelienced.'' In 1952 Getz recorded \M•oon:light in Vermont\ with Jimmy Smith. The record enjoyed a success seldom ac- corded any singl~ album. Despite great STAN GETZ wil1 bring his jazz quartet to Union College next week for a Sat- urday night Fall Weekend performance. advances in music technique, \Moon~ lig]J.t in Verm9nt'~ reta.ins its quality :a'S a timeless classic. Getz Wins GJ.'ammy ' 4 Desafinado,\ recorded by Getz with Charlie Byrd in 1962 was considered the \battle cry\ of th.e Bossa Nova \revolution\ in Am~rican popular mu- sic. The effects of \Desafinado\ was to maJte Bossa Nova standard in pop- ular music. Getz won the Grammy award for best solo performance of the year. He was nominated for eight other Grammy awards. Getz reacts to his public success in a simple way. \I am just a melody maker, I only try to make the most beautiful music I can. What I think ab(}ut really is what I always thought about . . . music the beauty of music.''

John Akar Finds Africa US Problem By Joe Mann There are \wind·s of change\ in con- temporary Africa, changes in the sta- tus of the African states and their peoples, according to John Akar, who spoke at Tuesday's convocation. For the most part, colonization is gone in Africa. This domination and exploitation, in Mr. Akar's word's, was \wrong stupid, and destructive.\ Al- though much advanced technology was introduced by the colonization proc- esses, other less desirable products, such as the color barrier and racial prejudice, came. Often, Africa is ac- cused of being technologically in the sa:me state today as it was ten years ago, a state which must be expected of newly-f1·eed colonies who are only beginning to determine their own af- fairs. The questions of \change and choice\ are visible all over Africa to- day. Change is occurring for the bet- ter, however, since foreign domination is behind and people are :realizing that they can decide their own fates. Mr. Akar noted that the periods of colonization were \traumatic experi- ences\ for Africans. After gaining in- dependence, the African states were faced with the problem of post-col- onial reorganization. The rate of change, too, is important. Mr. Akar said further that Afrieans were not \devils or angels,\ that they needed time and help to solve their problems. In roo'st parts of Africa, the prob- lems are less political than social and economic. Political problems, of course, cannot be neglected, but the conditions of impoverished Africans are more important. Trrbal loyalties, too, are still crucial. Continued on Page 5 Col. 3 Dean of ·the Faculty Th~odOl'e Loekwood indi<•ated this week his ron- cern for student participation in thesP mrutters, Sltating that the college will welcome a \proper.Jy handled\ sam- pling which wm provide a \tme re- fleetion\ of student feeling. The informa:tion gathered by thl· pqJl, the Dean said, would serve us a supplement to the judgments o.f de- partment heads and other faculty, and to the indiYidual instructor's t·ecord of scholarly achievement. Presently, classroom performance is not em·pha- sized. Improved Methods The survey will he an improveil \'er- sion of the one conducted last year by Concordiensi:.~. It wi.H probably be directed by the newspaper in co- operation with the Student Council and the administration, and will at- tempt a more complete and thorough- going analysis. The results will not be withheld from publication. Dean Lockwood be- lieves that a free dissemination of the results will reuuce \vinuictiYe\ repl.ie,; from students and increase the \re- sponsibili'ty\ of their answ~rs. The faculty committee which con- siders .promotions would in no way be bound by the results of the poll. The statistics, however, will allow the student to have some voice in the selection of his teachers. Administrations at several other schools have developed similar means of employing student ratings in their consideration of faculty for promo- tion. In the past two weeks, Yale and C.C.N.Y. have instituted such pro- grams. The increase in administrative in- terest in •teaching ability is an off- shoot of last year's tenure crisis in which strong objections were voiced against dismissal of good teachers on the basis o4' inadequate scho~arly pub- lication. , Prof. Rappaport Awarded Grant For Mitotic Studies Ephnten Rally .To Defeat Dutchnten By Robert A.

It was in those final minutes ·of the fourth quar~ ter that Williams launched a thunder- ing attack to overcome a thirteen point deficit. With Union ahead by two touch- down's, Williams scored after a pro· longed drive, narrowing the gap to 27-21. Deep in Williams territory with only four minrutes left, the Garnet punted. The runback was accompanied by a Union personal foul which placed the ball inside Garnet territory. A double reverse-the play Williams had used with great success all afternoon, -advanced the ball to the 40. Then with only two minutes left, the Eph- men started their double reverse again. Quarterback Cannon 1ateraled to half- back Wing who handed to Comfort. Suddenly, Comfort passed to End Pete Richard's who carried to the Garnet five. That was the backbreaking bomb. \Bread~and-butterman\ Wing crashed in for the score. Soule kicked the tie-breaker. Record Evened The would~be upset was the closest that Union has come to a triumph over Williams since the Garnet tri- umphed in 1956. The loss evened the Gamet record at three wins and three losses .. AI~hough William's seemed to out- class the Garnet when the Ephmen were functioning at their peak, the Garnet proved that they are no \breather\ on the Williams schedule. Quartevback Tom Hitchcock hit re- ceivers Sam Dill, George LaPorte and Marc Hurlbut for thirty passes, total- ing 322 yards. Both marks set new records. Hitchcock's 357 yards <total offense set ()ne of fourteen other record's. Senior end Hurlbut set a new ca- reer recoi·d in yards gained, receiving, as he sprinted 101 yards on comple- tions. His new total .of 800 yards SAM DILL caught two touchdown passes in Union's last minute loss to Williams College. gained beat Art Marshall's 757 yards set last season. Records Set Hurlbut•s 11 receptions extended his career record to 77. Wingback La~ Porte has caught 60 passes for 616 yards for the season, both seas'O•n records. Last season's star pass receiver Art Marshall still holds two records: Most touahdo-wn passes caught, seas·on ( 6) ; and most touchdown passes caught, career (7). LaPorte has five this sea~ son. Williams scored first in the ga.me that contrasted the 10th strongest run~ ning attack in the nation with the 8th strongest passing game. Wing went off-tackle for four yards midway through the first quarter for the initial tally. Then Hitchcoek fired five passes to LaPorte and gave to halfback Ramic:h straight ahead for three yards to cli- max an 11-play 85~yard Garnet drive. Second Period Wild Union scored twice more and Wil- liams once, in the wild second period. Both Garnet scores were on Hitcheock- . to-Dill pas·ses, first 10 yards, then five. Union claimed the initial score in the fourth period when Ramich plUllg- ed five yards for a touchdown to end a 99-2/3-yard drive, interrupted by a Williams interception followed by a fumble recovered by Union. Williams relied mostly on two plays throughout the game: One was a sim- ple pitch to Wing who went either Continued on Page 6, Col. 4 ,Festival Winds\ To Play The Festival Winds, a virtuoso wind group, will appear next week at a Union College convocation.

2 Friday, November 5, 1965 PEARSON V S. DIEFENBAKER: WHO CARES? By Robert Stolzberg lf there is one .thing that the Canadian voters agree on, it is that they do not w~nt :mother general election. But o1t Nvvember 8, the~; will l'n- gagt• oH the fifth in eight years. Tht• politicians are out trying t•J round up support, but all that is evident is a dearth of meaningful issues and a ple- thora of apathy. The issues which were de- Lattd twu and a half years ago are !tim dead ur dying. Tho: i:;sue uf the new flag has been resolved, and no one is propos- ing to revive it. Separitism has lost the a:bility to produee the passions it aroused in 1963., as the l'earsun government moved to give more independ- ence to the provinces. The election hoils down to a con- t0st of person::l!lities. Not a Leader bly pick up a few moo:e seats (it has . 17) and the Social Credit Party (now with 24 members) will probably suffer a slight drop. :But nothing very dramatic will be the re- sult. There may be heads rolling after the election. A Pearson victory, albeit a slim <>ne, would lead ta Diefenbaker's removal as Conservative leade·r. If done over his objections, it could .de- cisively .split an already dis- unified party. This would change the political landsca·pe significantly. If he resigns and the Tories can find a !pop- ular and attractive leader, it may mean a renaissance for the Conservative party, which has generaHy been the sec<~nd' 'to the Liberals. Pearson's Future If Pearson is succes.sful, he will undoubtedly be returned as Prime Ministe1·. There are l'rimtJ .MinisttJr PtJ<U~sun, the h~Qd of the LiLeral Party, came to oll'ice as the head of a coal- ition government. He had made his reputation as a diplo- mat, winninll.' the Nobel Peace l'rize for his work in settling the Arab-Israeli disputes of 1956. But he was not prepared for leadership. A diplomat, he tried t<J please everyone and did not assert himself. The re- sult was a succession of scan- dals which the Conservatives, under former P.M. John Dief- erubaker, have tried to make their major issue. Diefenbak- er, too, has not inspired any enthusiasm. Twice, since he lost power, members of his party have tried to remove him from party leader.ship. Al- though they were unsuccessf?l, these attempts have cost h1m stt-ength and prestige, while damaging party unity. Dimen- siou, a Canadian journal, stat- ed that \Lester Pearson must <\Ount a-s one of the least com- petent Prime Ministers Canada has had in recent times. He is ultimately responsuble for the half-baked measures that his ministers have been consistent- ly introducing to parliament . . . Because he laeks the cour- age and toughness required to LESTER PEARSON JOHN DIEFENBAKER many :rumors, however, that he would like to return to the academic world he left forty years ago. He wil'l pxobably, therefore, retire within two or three years. If he d;oes not succeed in winning a majority, it is possible that he will not continue. as leader Qf the Ltb- eral Party. He ha.s consistent- ly supported the Old G-uard of the party, and the younger men have grown restless under his leadership. Thus, we can ex- pect to see •a turnover in the leadership of both major par- ties, no matter who wins. One of these two men will probably emerge as Canada's Pr.ime Minister following Monday's general election. get rid of men who have ceased to be assets to the nation, he has surrounded himself with men who 'are incorrigiJble fum- blers and incompetents ..• Mr. Diefeil!baker was vain, vindic- tive, underhanded, ·suspicious, intolerant, indecisive, incon- sistent, and oppartunistic.\ Booming Economy Faced with the choice pl;e- sented .by these, it is n{);f; sur- prising that little eruthus iasm has deveLoped. Several fac- tors, however, are helping the Liberals. The economy is boom- mg, wheat sales to mainland China have brought prosperity to the plains, Quebec separatist activities are dormant, and the Conserva.tive opposition is in disarray.

Democratic Party, founded in 1961, may be disastrous to the Liberal·s. An average of thirty per cent of the electorate is undecided on how they will vote, accord~ng to most polls. This figure rises to forty per cent in the Liberal stronghold of Quebec. If these undecided voters, in disgust with the lead. ership of both major parties, desert for the NDP, it could significantly alter the compos- ibion of Parliament. Being to the left of the L1berals, it is likely that those are the votes they would take. It is true that only the NDP arouses any enthusiasm in the election. In the present Parliament, the Liberals have 129 seats out of 265. An effective majority is 134, counting the non-voting post of Speaker. The Liberals have generally had the support of six rto nine ,Social Creditists. But Pearson has publicly an- nounced that he would rather have another party win the el- ection than continue as a. minor- ity Prime Minister. He has also announced that he will call au- other election within 18 months if he is minority Prime Minis- ter again. This was met by catcalls. The insecurity of his position has made it impossi- ble for him to take, even if he wanted to, any strong unpopu- lar stands which might cost him any support. Some com- mentators have turned tJhis ar- gument around and .said that it forces him to listen to re- £orm g110ups, such as the NDP, and have attributed his ·basdc legislation, 'sucll as the Na- tional Labour Code <Jr the Con- 135 ERIE BOULEVARD Boulevard Bowl 32 AMF BOWLING LANES - Open 24 Hours Daily - SNACK BAR ON PREMISES FERRO PHARMACY 575 Nott Street Schenectady, N.

The interesti·ng question is: how in th·e world could anyone make a great 1novie using this idiotic situation for the central element of plot? The answer, is, of course, only if its stars are Gro- cho, Harpo and Chico Marx. The movie in question is Duck Soup. lt is beside the point to add that Duck S()up isn\t one of the Marx Brothers' very beSJt. movies; for the worst they 1. , migrut ever make would he better worth seeing than most things I can think of.

He is not, I suppose, one of the great comedians, but I can't think of anyone who has given me greater pleasure. My only ~:egret is that, so :Uu· as I have seen, he has never yet ·been in a posiJtion (not even on TV) to use everything I think he ha.s. Most good comedians, probably aU the great ones, require a very broad audience; Groucho, work:.ing with <extremely sophisticated wit rather than with comedy, has, I think, always been slowed and burdened J.Jy his audience. If yi}U have to choo.se between fun and brain's sake and fun :for fun's sal{e, I certainly prefer the latter, local ·brand. But beClause there is no sufficient .audience for the use of tile brain for fun's sake, I suspect tha:t we lose, in G1•oucho, the funniest sa;tirist of the century. The Plot? 'The on}y th,ings that seem to delay Freedonia's collapse are its enemies, Har!)o and Chico. Groucho is engaged in simultaneously making love to and insulting (as usual) ·the ·richest .lady in F1·eedonia. Harpo and ChiC1J enter l'rime Mini-ster Groucho's office one day armed to the teeth with alarm clocks, scissors for cu•tting Qff coat tails, cigar buctts and as·sort~d bells. Assigned to pry into the afiairs of Gl\oucho they begin by rolling a peanut stand under his window, making such a disturbance that to keep .them, quiet he makes Harpo his chauffeur, atppoints Chico secretary of war.

Grouch 0 calling for X-Rays and Har-pC> and Chico rushing in with the evening papers. Duck Soup is a typical Ma1•x Brothers farce. The 'most diffiicult kind of picture to make is a comedy.

They're as scarce a§l hen~s- t~.~~- (W•hy do people still insist on using this silly simile when even the rooster knows that the hen hasn't any teeth . . • and very little of anything else? ) If you haven't as yet seen Duck Soup on the Late Show. let me suggest that there could be no better way to spend a Friday night than going to EE 22 at seven or nine and tak- ing iot in.

To this end, the library has built up a large number of research aids, available primarily to the faculty. One Otf the m-o&t often used of such facilities is the College's association Vlith the State Hbrary at Albany, and the TWX SY'Stem of interlibrary com- !llunicati:on. Li~ed to the Sta.te library lJy means of a teletype, and, incidentally tu other libraries subscribing to this same service (such as the Library o.f Congress), any faculty member desirin\\ informatil}n or dl}cumentat.ion not avai'l- able at our <>wn library ·Can put in a :request for information to many libraries throughout -the country, and be assured <lf a speedy response. To fu.rther heigh- ten the efficiency of such loans, the college ma.intains a cout'ler servi-ce with the State Library, which allows for a speedy procuring- of sour-ces. l11ternatlonal Resources In the event that a researcher de- sires material to be found outside the United Sta-tes, the library is empowel'ed to hire bibliographic researchers in Ooth- er countries. Further, the libral'y is authorized to contract for the duJllica- tion ()f needed .source materials found by these researchers. While suc:h long- distance methods o.f research do not always yield results, it has been pointed out .by Mr. Tolan, head of the libl'al'Y'; that a little il1formation, at a cmcia1 stage jn research, is better than none. Along J;nuch the same vein, the trus- tees have pro'Vided the lihra:ry with a fund of money to be spent, if needed, on treatises, or other inf-ormative materials. In a:ddit~o.n, specia~ microfilm editions of required information, as well as other prepared, and normally unobta.ina.ble ma- terials, can be purchased with money from this same source. Interlibrary Loans The library has seve!:\al other means of aiding faculty research. The first of these is that of interlibrary loans, other than those associated with the TWX system. In this case, a faculty member, as well as a student seeking similar informa:tion, wo-uld merely fill out an interlibrary loan card and submit it to the librar-ian, who would make ap- the information. The second of these is the library's attempi to acquire a first class, and highly compxehensive, store of bibliographic materials which would allow a.ny researcher to quickly find whether his topic has been written about, and, if so, where to find it. Fin- ally, the library maintains six study carrels available only to researching pro- ~essors wlto need <to be near bibliograph- Ic, and textual, iTiformation while seek- ing, or compiling, data.

Since the area live perf~H·nwltc~s (at Roth:; fot· instance) are expen.tiive, the mu::;t practical way to get your jazz is through the many fine recording::;. availablt•. This entail:;, un- fortunately, an expense of time and money whic-h many low budgeted student,; find too extmvagant. :\1y purpose here then is to .offer ::<ome ~ugg-Pstions whil'h may hP hPlpful tn you in buil1J.iong your o\\'ll library of l\Pronl<•d jazz. The Considerations ... There are two things to consider in plunning your col- lection. First you Jnu::>t determine how much Y<·)U are willing to pay for your records, and then decide which 1·ecords to buy. Bofh these points are especially important to the stu- dent who doesn't know how to judge the relative values of record~d albums. He can save a good deal of money if he know's the best records to buy and the price to pay for them. Jt was a shrewd Scottish L'nion student \·ho computed thP cost of producing a record. WhL•n the goVl'l\llment exrise tax was taken off records la~t year, the price was lowered by four cents.. Since the tax \n1s ten percent of the manu- facturer's cost, he readily saw that the total cost of pro- ducing an. album was about forty cents. You however mu::;t pay five or six dollars for one. Despite the student discount you may get at one of the local music corners, you are still payll}g too much. As Professor Finkelstein wisely observed one day last year, \Anyone who pays the li:st price for anything is a damn fool.\ I don't know how true this is for \anything but it is certainly the .case in the record business. There are many places, especially in New York City, which offer dis- count p1ices. In Schenectady we have both \Two Guys\ and the \Big N.\ Both stores make the ·same reduction in price. They generally charge a dollar and a half less than the- price offered at the retail music stores. And although their selec- tions are by no means as various as at the music stores, they will be quite happy to order a.t no extra cost any record which is in pTint. Far and away, however, the best bargains I have found in this area were at the Lafayette Electronics Store in A·lbany. The Schenectady Lafayette store usually offers classical music at some reduction in p1·ice, hut does not ca1'l'Y jazz albums. However, the Albany sbore, which is quite conveniently located on route 5 (Central Avenue), does have a large selecticm of some of the best in jazz. I have bought. some records thete which I am sure the jazz critics wouid call label as \classics\ for the record low price of two dollars. Lafayette is able to do this beause they buy theiT albums in bulk from the distributor, and quite often the distributor sends them records which are very good. At any rate, the search for good buys is one of the pleasures of building a jazz collection. The collector would d-o well to investigate all the possible bargain stores in both Schenec- tady and in his home town. Consult Discographies The second point-which records to buy-is especially di<fficult to the student who doesn't know much about jazz. There are, of course, several different types of jazz (dixie- land, the blues, swing, bop, cool and modern), and certainly a good collection will include something of each. But since the jazz uninitiated is often unaware of these radically dif- fering types, his purchasing decisions are difficult ones to make. If he has the money, he might just buy 1·ecords at random and then after listening to them decide which style of jazz he prefers. He can learn by experience which albums to· buy; :but this is, of course, an expensive way of dQing it. The least expensive and pP.rhaps the wisest way to your selections is tl} consult the discographies of the many jazz books that Shaffer Library has. These discographies are com;posed of those records which jazz critics generally hold In high regard. Of Cl}urse they repl'esent some critic's per- sonal .opinion which may differ from yours, but they are nonetheless a good indiootion of what ts the best in jazz. Word of Warning One warning should be issued. Don't make the mistake of buyiing S\lbums merely because they are by a \big name.\ A good deal of jazz, especially modern jazz, is often difficult to enjoy. Musicians like Thelonius Monl{, Cecil Tayll}r, Charlie Mill!gus, and John ·Coltrane are producing exped- mental music. which is by the standards of tradition jazz \•vay Qut.\ This is not to say their music isn't good. On the contrary the music of Monk, for instance, is perhaps the only great thing that's happening on the jazz scene today. The point is that before you can truly appreciate Monk or the experimenters, you must know what ha's gone before. It would 'be best to stick to the names which will always rank high in j-azz history. Men like Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Lester Young, Benny Goodman, etc., have pro- duced music which should be a welcome addition to anyone's jazz collection. I can only suggest that you include these and other. top name's of traditional jazz in your record collection.

We were surprised to learn that some students object to this grand system which has effectively excluded sin from campus these many years, protected the righteous- ness of the Union man and perpetuated the image of the college in the monastic ideal. The social rules, the adminis- tration is proud to acknowledge, have eradicated every hint of illicit contact with females from campus, and have successfully cleansed the minds of Union men, transform- ing the pollution of their high school psyches into chaste, pure sterility before the end of the sophomore year. NevE-r, throughout his four· yPars of attendance here, does the student find himself alone with a woman, even for an instant. What a relief this is from the discomfort and virtual terror experienced by so many when left facing a female with no friends and fellow students in sight. Not once does the Union man undergo the shame and guilt of and cultural ~tmosphere of a ollege.

By J eft' Browne If you're going to the football game at Bowdoin tomorrow, dress warmly-it'.s i-n polar bear coun- try. It remains to be seen if the weather will be a factor as the Union College varsity football team travels into the depths ()of Maine to take on the Bowdoin Polar Bears in Brunswkk at 1:30 P.M. If you're not going to the game, the contest will be broad- cast over WRUC radio starting at 1:30. Bowdoin has the only team \L'nion ·will play this year whose line is not bigger than Un-. ion's. Coach Flood estimated that the lines are ahout the same size, hut conceded that the Polar Bear backfield may have a slight size advantage. Like> the Garnet, the Polar BPnrs rely hravily on passing. Qu:~rterh:-tck :\'Io Viens fires regu- brh· to AII-:!'Jew Eng-land end .Tim· MnrA11en. Viens has com- pleted 66 of 10 attempted p-asses, 30 of them to MacAllen. Balanced Oft'ense Th~ offense is balanced by a large amount of running, mostly by All-American candklate half- back Paul Soule, who holds the Bowdoin single-game rushing record. Soule has travelled 468 yards on 112 carries, and has scored 36 points this season. Bowdoin has a won-3, lost-4 record in a tough schedule of op- ponents, including Wesleyan, Am- herst, Williams, and Tufts. The Bears' decisive victory came early in October when they d!·enched Worcester Polytechnic Institute, 4018. In that game, quarterback Viens completed 12 of 13 passes, four of them good for touch- dovms. Meanwhile Soule set a per~wnal rareer mark with 101 yards rushing. The Polar Bears found them- selves at the other end of a lop- sided game two weeks ago when they faced Williams. The game PAUL WOODELL provides al· most all the pass protection for Hitchcock's passing attack. ended 42-13 despite outstanding ·efforts by Soule, who ran back a kick-off 84 yards :lior a touch- down. Union's football htstory with Bowdoin is more impressive than with any other school: The Gar- net ha;s never lost--tomorrow's encounter marks the first time the two teams have met.

(~ A forewarning of doom has 'been sent ft•om unknown sources concerning Fall Weekend. As a show of strength, all power was mysteriously shut oiJ for an extended length of time last Tuesday night. It was intended as a warning f()r Union students to be on their best behavior for Fall Weekend. If you think it was bad lo~;~ing all electrical power at the time we did, just think how terriblt> it would be if the lights wel'e to go ou.t at the fraternity parties just when the guys were getting to know their dates. That would be disaster. What a way to ruin a weekend! ~~ctually there was some controversy as to what really caused the blackout. While some attributed it to supernatu1·al causes, others gave more practical, scien.ittc explanatJons. Dr. Smedley Furd, Professor of Lightbulbs, stated, \The reason is simple. The entire ~ortheast is set up in a series circuit and all that happened was that someone blew a fuse somewhere.\ Niagai'a Quits Othet•s said that Xiagara Falls just got tired of being the \fall guy\ and stovped for awhile. The possibility of sabotage was discounted by the F.B.I. who ~;all' tha non~ wao; im,ohed. However, nobody investigated the possibility that somebody subotagt>d the F.B.I. High go\·ernment officials stated that they wert> in the dark about the whole thing. Freshmen in West College were glad about the whole. thing because they didn't ha\·e to look at the food that they were eating. The herd of Union students heading up to Slddmon• showed deep concern for the poor damst>ls who .might have. loo;;t the way back to their rooms. \Boy we'll really show them\ was the comment of one such altruist. One Fre~;hman wa~; relaxing during the blackout, content in the fact that he finally had a good ('Xcuse for not studying, when in walked his roommate with a candle which gave just enough light to read by. The student was all upset, muttering something about \Damned new-fangled inventions.\ The frenzy in Memorial Chapel promises to reach monstrous vroportions not unlike last Spring Weekend's Concert, pictured above. No More Dead Than Usual Contrary to what one might believe, the blackout in no way alfeeted action in the town of S<:henectady as it aft'ected such cities as New York and Boston. Schenectady was as usual: dead! A major disastrous result of the blackout was the fact that WRUC had to stop broadcasting for the duration of the blackout. This m.eant that the poor unfortunate Union students had to go .a whole three hours without hearing the \top 15.\ That only left thirty opportunities that day to hear them. HugePranlr Some viewed the blackout as a huge fraternity prank. It was reported tltat members of a certain fraternity were seen running around, frantically pulling plugs out. The blackout was a warning to students concerning bow the world was going to look to them on Sunday night. Perhaps someone was testing out what could be done to foul up big weekends. We'd better watch out the first time that rock- and-roll groups appear in Memorial Chapel. However all was not dark during the blackout. For once that guy next door wasn't blasting his reeord player and that guy with the electric guitar was rendered useless. Some, dissatisfied with their dates, were hoping that the same would happen during Fall Weekend, feeling that there's always a bright side to everything. Memorial Chapel will rock tonight as the music of Ian and Sylvia ex- plodes fr<>m the two singers' harps while the exotic strains of . the pre- .Gregorian madrigal engulfs the audi- ence in a wild, surging frenzy. Ian, who usually plays the clag horn will be making his harp debut in this 'performance. Administration of- ficial's have been pleading with the temperamental artist to leave the harp home. They fear that the initial shock of hearing two harps blasting at once might set off such an uproar among the uncontrollable throngs that the veritable pillars of Memorial Chapel could not w~thstand the hY'sterical ad- ulation over an expertly plucked pre- Gregorian madrigal. Stuck to Harp Ian,. h(}wever, stuck firmly to his harp and the administration has in- Campus Cop Reacts To Viet Crisis While shocked students stood help- lessly by, a member of the campus poliee force burned himself to death on Wednesday afternoon.

A curious group of students and professors began to march along with him. They circled the construction sight, and approached the workmen's fire in a gay mood. One biology professor sca;mpered back to his office for some marshmallows. At this point, the policeman, still puffing his kazoo, picked up a pro- fessor of religion in his arms and walked bolt-upright into the flames. The iJ'anicked professors ran scream- ing from the scene, while studsnts begged the charring cop to \put down\ the profess·or, whose terror made him appear to be enjoying the hideous ceremony.

As a show of strength, all power was mysteriously shut off for an extended length of tilne tas't Tuesday night. It was intended as a warning for Hnion students to be on :their best behavior for Fall Weekend. lf you think it was bad' losing all electrical powl'r at thl' timl' we did, just think how terrible it WO!Ild be if the lights wen to go out at the fraternitY' parties just when the !niY s· \'Wel'e getting to know their dates.

The p~ssibility of sabotage was discounted by the F.B.I. who satlL Hut' no,,e was im,olved. However, nobody investigated the possibility that somebody sa:htltagt-d the I•' .B-1'. High government officials stated that they were in the park about the whole thing. Freshmen in West College were glad about the whole thing beeause they didn't have to look at thefcoorl that they were eating. The herd of Union stud(;lnts heading uv to Skidmore s.h~'ved deep concern for the poor damsels who might have lost the way back !<» tll~ir rooms. \Boy we'll really show them\ was the comment of one such altnllist. One Fre;.;hman was re-lal'\'iRg during the blackout, content in tht> fact that he finally had a good excnse f~r not studying, .when in w~lked his roommate with a candle which gave just Clt-()llgh light to read by. The student was all upset, muttering something abuut \Damned new-fang}ed inventions.\ N\ o Kore Dead Than Usual Contrary to what one ntigh.t believe, the blackout in no way alfected action in the town of S<·henectady as it affected such cities as New York and :Boston. Schenectady was as usual: dead! ;A majl)r disas1;rous r~sult of the blackout was the fact that WRUC had to stop broadeasting. for the; .!htr:ation of the blaclmut. This meant that the poor, unfortunate Union stJJ,d.etds had to go .a whole three hours withtmt hearing the \top'15.'' that -only left thh·ty opportunities that day to hear them. HugePranl{ Some vie,ved the blac:k()out as a huge fraternity prank. It was reported that members «lf a certain fr~te-Tnity were seen running around, frantically pulling plugs out. The blackout was a. w-a.t\::ling to students concerning how the world was going to look to t~em on Sunda~.y night. Perhaps someone was testing out what could be done to foul up big \'e~kends. We'd ·better watch out the first time that rock- and-roll groups appear ill ~[etuorial Chapel. Itowevel' all was n~t duk during the blackout.

2 Friday, November 12, 1965 NEWS OF THE WEEK IN EDUCATION Bio Terror F rosh Disappears The Union College biology department has demonstrated that go,od teachers can also be · · excellent researche·rs. In a mass effort by the biology staff, a hu- man brain was removed from the living body of a human and kept alive for two wcek!-l in a :;pedally prepared tank. The brain ha::; !Jeen fitted ·with artificial ::;cnse organs which al- low it to hear, converse and see. It i::; being kept in Joe's work- shop to provide it with com- pany.

Spore Body ducing to order and meaning the matter of our acquirements; it i's making the objects of our knowledge subjeetively our own, or, to use a familiar word, it is a digestion of what we receive, into the substance of our previ- ous state of thought; and with- out this no enlargement is said to follow. We, at Union, will be faced with a great challenge and must, if we are not to fail, rise to meet it with all the piety of effort and renunciation we can muster. We cannot stand by and wait for the faculty to pump ideas into our heads. We will now have to think and 1 think dearly. Union Initiates By now it shGmld be clear to e\'eryone that the time of the two-semester calendar is at an end. Despite the fact that many colleges :have abandoned their tri-mester calendavs, Union has chosen to initiate a renovation of higher education never be- fore attempted. We must ad- mire college officials for their courage in embarking on this difficult task, the kind of cour- age exhibited by Eliphalet Nott when he first .put Union on the map.

Student Riot Leader Leftist ThP aftermaq;h of last week's sturlent riot hung like a shroud over campus last week as work- men were temporarily diverted ft·om the new construction to repair the General Engineering Building. President Martin issued a :<tatement condemning \th?se who beliE'W this sort of thmg is helpful to the educational procc::;,;,''. . . The Offtce of Student ActJ\'1- ties said that the number of Cnion students still in jail was ;..bout 50 or GO. Exact figures have nut bel'll rdeased by the police, the office sa:irl. The riot began last Tuesday durin!! an evening convocation. ~ ikolai Leftist, the speaker from the Berkeley campus of the University of California, \\'US speaking about the role of the humanities in the science- oriented world of today. \We need more humanities in the science-oriented world of to- day,\ he said. Suddenly he jumped off the stage anrl began to address the group of stud- ents, faculty, anrl administra- tion while screaming at the top o [ his I ungs. \l refuse to scream at you,\ he said, \but the engineers are ruining our world. Back to the arts:\ Brandish Slide-Ru!o:; With that he cried, \All those who are zealous for the arts, follow me!\ and stormed out of the building. He was followed by a group of chant- ing students. (The registrar's office later described this group as \99 per cent English ma- jors.\) The mob marched across Library Field to the General Engineering Building, where they were met by a small g-roup of engineering students brandishing slide rules. Leftist apparently picked up a stone and threw it at thP assemhleu engineers. Fwm here the records are uncertain as to exactly what happened. When police finished arresting the last of the r.ioters, Leftist had left the scene. Officials at the Berkley campus could offer no information about his where- abouts FERRO PHARMACY 575 N1ott Street Schenectady, N. Y. FR 7-0510 • FOUNTAIN SERVICE I I Informed sources in the ad- ministration indicate« that this would mean the tightening of student regulations enforce- ment. It was rumored that the campus police force was to be expanded from 3% rto 414. While no leaders of student organizations attempted to ex- cuse the rioters, the general feeling on campus seemed to be that their complaint was, in a sense, legitimate. The chairman of the Communilty Government Council said, \While we do not excuse the rioters, we feel tha,t their com- plaint was, in a sense, legitim- ate.\ The president of the council is a civil engineering major and hopes to attend law school in !the fall. One conservative member of the faculty said, \The whole thing is olwiously another at- tempt by the International Communist ronspiraey to pro- pagate free love and other left- ist propaganda among our col- lege youth.\ Ant1ther faculty member, who also refusrd to be idrntified, stated, \The whole thing coulrl be resolvPd if we just remembered Plato's words: 'Qu·e sera sera'.\ Fantasies Faery SpGcialist The other day we took Union college's newly appointed fac- ulty member, Dr. Roland B. Narthington, to lunch at the Van Dyke. Dr. Narthington, well kn<>wn for his thesis, \The Hole of the Faery Princess in the College Mind,\ will teach a new course next year dealing with fantasy and children's rhymes as a new way of look- ing at the modern world. The scholar was in Schenec- tady for a few days before re- turning to New York, where he is presently engag!Jrl in research on the embryonic guilt feelings possessed by the now antiquat- ed ogre. Nude Figurines We stood patiently waiting in the lobby while Dr. Narthing- ton scrutinized the rather in- triguing, black nude figurines mounted on the doors of the rest roo-ms. With a delighted grunt, he trotted over to us, beaming happily and gesturing wildly with his hands, pointing out t~t \those lovely little statuett~s\ were i.'epresentative of an African 'sub-culture in which he was extremely inter- ested. We nodded in polite ap- proval, and the hostess then showed us to a table overlook- ing the garden L. G. BALFOUR CO. CARL SORENSEN BADGES - RINGS - FAVORS JEWELRY LEATHER GIFTS STATIONERY - PROGRAMS CLUB PINS - KEYS MEDALS - TROPHIES Write or Call Fraternity Jewelers 729 South Crouse Ave. Syracuse, N.Y. 13~10 1:1 After we were seated and had or<lered a light lunch, we asked Dr. Narthington how he had be- come interested in the study of children's fantasies. He smiled at this and fingered the bridge of hi's nose where a huge pail: of tortise shell glasses rested. \Well essentially and rather pertinently - I might add - I have never grown up. Now this doesn't at all mean that I'm im- ~ture,\ he giggled, \In fact, I hke to think of myself as being quite advanced as a man of learning. But I have never lost a child's sensitivity for the a.b- stract. I have a definite feeling for that which Man cannot un- derstand or explain. Even now, as I sit here with J'OU gentle- men in such a beautiful and rather tangible place as this, I can dose my eyes,\ and he closed them and threw his head back, \And see Oberon soaring into the c. ouds leaving the mortal Earth below him.\ In the pause that followed, we weren't quite sure what we should do, because our noble friend had lapsed into another world and was lying back form- ing silent words with his lips and making a slight gurgling sound in his mouth. A few of the midday patrons were amus- edly glancing in our direction, and we could only attempt to revive our new acquaintance. Sitting Position \Dr. Narthington,\ we pl·od- ded, and suddenly he snapped back to a sitting position and smiled, completely unaware of his hypnotic performance the moment before. \Sir this morn- ing at the seminar (we had a .. table~talk concerning his recent and future work), you were P-is- cussing your thesis and how it related to our society, however it was never made clear how the college student fit in ... \ \Well he does fit in! Very much so·, in fact.\ \How?\ we w.anted to know- \Ah! The coLlege student is basically a child. His sense of values hasn't developed yet. His whole concept O<f the world is distorted, because he doesn't really see it. Think of him as being blind-a blind child. He is clutching for something that he can feel and be aware of. He is lonely; and he needs the help of those who understand his plight . . . why, juSit look at those wild parties where young men become drunk and y<>ung ladies are violated.\ We replied that we had witnessed a few of these atrocious scenes, but where do the faeries come in?, we asked. \A-ha the fae:ry. You see, the faery is but an abstraction, which represents frivia1ity and in<lecision to the child, or the college student--here they are one and the same. The college student identifies with it, and he accepts it as reality. The fairy is someone he can turn to in a time of need-something in the line of a god, as far a:s consolation is concerned.'' He wa;s now quite excited and jig- gled around in his seat, while wiping his glasses with the ta- ble cloth, as he stared around the room nearsightedly. \Fantasy is Insecurity\ 'But why teach college stu- dents nursery rhymes'!\ \To influence them, of course! If the student had a good back- ground in the study of fantasy and magic, he would not fall victim t(} the attacks of goblins and fairies. And therefore, he would wt be tempted to do all the silly things that he is us- ually pr<>ne to doing. What I am saying is, in fact, children sometimes do not even realize that they believe in fantasy. Fantasy is insecurity, a weak- ness of character.\ We sipped from our water glasses and li'S- tened attentively. \You see, if a student knew the basic tales and rhymes, he would have a built-in morality. Let's say a boy was temporarily under the influence of liquor, and was sitting high up on a balcony, uncertain of himself. Now, if he recalled the sad saga of Humpty Dumpty, he wouldn't be up there in the first place.\ We considered this a moment an<! realized that he might have a point indeed. The sociological implication's were suddenly over- whelming. Perhaps there is something to the strange ideas invented by this weird man who sat across the table from us. But the waitress had already set the food,.,6h the table, and Dr. Narthington was watching her retreating figure through his tremendous lelliSes. Comp Cals Octa-mester The final approv:al of the re- cently proposed octa-mester calendar has caused a great deal of dissenot around campus. The implementation of this new calendar in June of next year involves a sweeping revi- sion of curriculum and faculty duties. In the words of a col- lege spokesman: \The new cal- endar and curriculum revisions will put Union m a class by it- self among the natj.on's institu- tions of higher learning. We are embarking on a new fron- tier never even dreamt of by any other college or university. It is now, more than ever, up to Union to set the pace for the ,, REJOICE!! NOVEMBER 13 IS THE BIRTHDAY OF BOABDIL JOIN THE CENHBFV* * The Committee for the Establishment of National Holidays on the Birthdates of Famous Visagoths. I I The small group of students who witnes'sed the passage of tl_le new .plan were aghast and dismayed. Such a calendar would eliminate the usual Christmas and Easter vacation period·s, but students will be pleased to learn that they will now be off for Washington and Lincoln's Birthdays as well as that of ·sundry Uni<>n Worthies. There was an adde<l stipulation to the effect that classes may be cancelled in the event of the assa&sination of the President of the United States if such a catastrophe should occur dw'i.ng any mester other than the third or seventh which are already unduly loaded with holidays. It seems that the colleg-e has final- ly decided to impress upon the student body that their first ~usiness while attending Union 1s to learn as much as p·ossihle. Instead <>f accelerating existing co_urses, the All-College Com- nuttee has demded to increase t~e number of school days by fifty peT cent. This could mean that the final exams of the last octa-mester would end in early August. Covrse Changes When this plan is introduced m;xt year, many course changes w1ll re·sult. The present English 1 and History 10 requirements will be eliminated to make way for C<?~P!-'ehensive programs in the DlVISlons of Humanities and Sciences. Incipient freshman wilL be expected to take five mesters of study in· a c<>urse ~ombin_ing the studies of Eng- hsh, Hrstory, Modern Language Political Science and Home Ec~ anomies and four mesters of combined and intensified study of Mathematics, Mechanical Dra~ng, Chernisrtry, Biology Phys1cs and Bridge-Building~ For-The-Enlightened Layman In addition to these, .courses wili be offered in the Anthropologi- cal Implications of Modern Lit- erature, Art and Architecture in the Age of the H-Bomb and The Nature and Ground of Being. There will be no ad- vanced placement for entering fresohman in these three com\Ses unless permission is granted by the res~dent psycholog1st. .

Starting the first semester on June 12, three months ear- lier than last year, tfue revis- ion is intended to attract the intellectual elite from the rural areas who wish to utilize the spring season for farm activi- ties, such as breeding and oth- er groundwork. '69 for Fertilization Athough this revo.lutionary idea seems to be the hottest concept in education circles in years, there will he problems as well as assets in the new curriculum. Dean Knockonwood, Dean of students' wives, ex- claims, \Starting in '69 a new course in fertiliza.tion will be offered. In addilbion, the S\lm- mer weather will enable us to give advanced courses in bird- watching, lawn cultivation, and weed extermination in our presently seedy program in these fields.\ The Chairman of the Depart- ment of Admissions, Jonathan Piezon '34-5, is also excited about the change. He feels the admissions department will have a three-mooth advall- tage on all other schools with applications moved up three months. Mr. Piezon says, \our early -bird philosophy will catch students before their southern migration.\ Student reaction is gintoni- caliy mixed. Dating advan- tages are obvious with com- petition from the ivy schools all but extinct. However, some students claim dates will be likewise. Others complain that work, other than farming, will be difficu1t to procure, even with the background gained from the down-to-earth agricul- tural cou11ses. Breast-Sfroker Dean of Life, Dean Plowback, has expressed a great delight in the entiTe move. He feels that summer weekends will be greatly improved without the possibility of Skidmore dates. \Our classes have long been distracted by intercollegiate dating practices. Stavting wi-th '69 this problem will be grea;tly alleviated.

2 Friday, November 12, 1965 NEWS O.F ·T.HE WEEK IN EDUCATION Bio Terror F rosh Disappears The Union College biology department has demonstrated \' that g'ood tea·chers can also be excellent researchers. In a mass effort by the biolo!{y staff, a hu- n:tan brain was removed from the liv·ing- body of a human and kept alive for two weeks in a specially prepared tank. The brain has been fitted with a1·tificial sense organs which al- low it to hear, converse and see. 1t is being kept in Joe's work- shop to provide it with com- pany. \\'hen asked why mun• tests wenn't ocin~ t:ondl:ldet! with the braiu, D1.

We must ad- mire coHege officials for their courage in em-barking on this difficult task, the kind ·of cour- age exhibited by Eliphalet Nott when he first put Union on the map. Although class sizes will he inct·eased in many areas and Union's vacation periods won't coincide with 'those oo the resst of the nation's colleges, we should be thankful that, at last, we will be waf1:ed by the winds of -change. Farm Approach The Biology successes of th1s week have been partially s;tb- merg-ed in the sear7h f~r a ~ss­ ing F1·eshman, Irvm Snnphctty, who disappeared twG weeks a~o. The faculty has expres~ed 1ts concern, except for the. B10 p::o- fessors whc only snnle emg- ma;tica:fly when questioned on their views. Student Riot Leader leftist The aftermath of last week's student riot hung like a shroud over campus last we~k as. work- men were temporartly dtverted from the new constru~tion. to repair the General Engmeermg Ruilding. President Martin issued a statement condemning \th?se who believe this sort of thmg is helpful t(} the educational process.\ .. The Office of Student Actt\'I- ties said that the number of l'nion students still in jail was ahout fl(l or f)O. Exact figures have not heen released by the police, the office said. The riot began last Tuesday during- an evening convocation. Nihlai Leftist, the speaker from the Berkeley campus of the University of California, was speaking about the role or the humanities in the scie.nce- oriented world of today. \We need more humanities in the sdence-oriented world of to- day,\ he said. Suddenly he jumped off the stage and began to address the group of stud- ents farultv, and administra- tiCln' while ·screaming at the top of his lungs. \I refuse to scream at you,\ he said, \but the engineers are ruining our world. Ba·ck to the arts:\ Brandish Slide·Rufo:; With that l1c cried, ••All those who are zealous for the arts, follow me!\ and stormed out of the building. He was followed .by a group of chant- ing students. (The registrar's office later de·scribed this group as \9!) per cent English ma- jors.\) The mob marched across Library Field to the Geneml Engineering Building, where they were met by a small group of engineering stud~nts brandishing slide rules. Leftist apparently picked up a stone and threw it at the assembled engineers. From here the records are uncertain as to exactly what happened. When police finisohed arresting the last of the riotet·s, Leftist had left the scene. Officials at the Berkley ca.m·pus could .offer no information about his where- abouts FERRO PHARMACY 575 Nott Street Schenectady, N. Y. FR 7-0510 • FOUNTAIN SERVICE J Informed sources in the ad- ministration indicated that this would mean the tightening of student regulations enforce- ment. It was rumored that the campus police force was to be expanded from 3% >to 4l4. While no leaders of studEnt organizations attempted to -ex- ruse the rioters, the gene·ral feeling on campus seemed to be that their complaint was, in a sense, legitimate. The chairman of the Communilty Governmellt Council said, \While we do not excuse the rioters, we feel that their com- [}laint was, in a sense, legitim- ate.\ The president of the council is a civil engineering major and h·opes to attend law school in >the fall. One conservative member of the faculty said, \The whole thing is obdously another at- tempt by the International Communist conspit·acy to pr.t>· pagate free love and other left- ist propaganda among our col- lege youth.'' Ant>ther faculty member, who also refused to be identified, stated, \The whole thing could he resolved if we just remembered Plato'~ words; 'Que sera sera'.\ Fantasies faery Sp~cialist The other day we took Union college's newly appointed fac- ulty member, Dr. Roland B. ::-.Iarthington, to lunch at the Van Dyke. Dr. Narthington, \\·ell known for his thesis, \The H.ole of the Faery Princess in the College Mind,\ will teach a n,ew course next year dealing with fantasy and children•s rhymes as a new way of lo-ok- ing at the modern world.

With a delighted grunt, he trotted over to .us, beaming happily and gestur-mg wildly with his hands, poin~ng out tb\:t \those lovely httl~ statuetfts\ were representativ-e of an African 'sub-culture i:n which he was extremely inter- ested.

A few o,f the midday patroll!s were .amus- edly glancing in our direction, and we could ()nly attempt to revive our new acquaintance. Sitting Position \Dr. Nat•thington,\ we pl·od- ded, and suddenly he saapped back to a sitting position and smiled, completely u.naware of his hypnotic Jlel1'ormance th·e moment bef{)re. \Sir this mmn- in-g at the seminar (we had a.. table-talk concerning his l'ecent and future work), you were dis- cussing y()Ul' thesis and how it related to our s·oeiety, h()weve1· it was nev~r made clear how the college studell!t fit in ..• \ \Well he does fit in!

You seE:!, the fae1•y is hut an abstraction, which mpresents friviality and indecision to the child, or the college student-here they are one and the same. The college student identifies with it, and he accepts it as reality. The :fairy is s·omeone he can turn, to in a time of need-something- in the line of a god, as far as. <:oJ:Js<>lation is concerned.\ He was now quite excited and jig- gled around in his seat, while wi]ling his glasses with the ta- ble cloth. as he stared around the :room nearsightedly. ''Fantasy is Insecurity\ •Bnt why teach college stu- dellts nursery rhymes?\ \'l\o influe11ce them, of course!

The study was conducted after many freshmen had critici~ed the formal attire, 1·equired of those eating in the West College cafeteria. The data pointed out that the l., pressure of the tie against one's Adam's Apple not only provides extra comfort for the individual, hut forces the food down the gul- let, thus aiding in the early !)hases of digestion. The pres- sure exerted on the duodenum by a pl'()perly fitted sport jacket is invaluable in later digestive pro- > ~ r€sses. Stunning Besides the benefici-al physical effects of formal dining-, there are certain psychological 1·esults worth mentioning. It has been shown that digestion takes place best when the mind is re 1 axed. What better way is there to relflx than to wear a stunning sport jacket and tie? Furthermore, seeing one's friends beautifully dressed is such a stimulant to the heart that impro,per diges·~ion is yiJ•tually impossible.

The conclusion is that Un:ion is not giving some students sheepskins who have paid through the nose to get it. Now, we have finally reached the ultimate in metaphysica-l ultimation, and we can com- prehend the beauty of Dean Lockhead's solution. Let the student pay through the nose and give him his sheepskin.

The study was conducted after many freshmen had critici~ed the formal attire, required of those eating in the West College cafeteria. The data pointed out that the pres·sure of the tie against one's Adam's Apple not only provides extra comfort for the individual, but forces the food down the gul- let, thus aiding in the early phases of digestion. The pres- sure exerted on the du·odenum by a properly fitte.d sport jacket is invaluable in later dh;es·live pro- cesses. Stunning Besides the beneficial physical t>ffects of formal rlining, there are certain psychological results worth mentioning. It ha·s been shown that digestion takes place best .when the mind is re 1 axed.

So pt·emise A. is now that every Union student should get his sheepskin. Premise B. is that some Union students don't get their sheepskin.

Now, we have finally reached the ultimate i·n metaphysica-l ultimation, and we can com- prehend the beauty of Dean Lockhead's soluti-on. Let the student pay through the nose and give h-im his sheepskin. Eliminate the corru.pting influ- ences of lecherous old profes- sors and wicked girls from Russell's Oage. In this. way, old Union will solve all its prob- lems at one blow. In one sweep all our prohlems will be de- feated.

Thus, at the end of the war, many other schools across the nation took up .the idea of student mar-ches to prote'st significant issues. The point is clear, however, that all these are but a product of the seeds of discontent sown by motivated Union students since the school was founded. And yet, durin·g these last twenty years, many schools have used our very idea of the student protest but have given no credit to the institution Lhut fostered and nurtured this great movement in our country. In a final gesture of our inherent superiority, Union students have, during these twenty years, decide<! to protest against these newly born movements by failing to prote-st in any way. What to an outsider may seem to be \apathy\ on our campus, is in reality nothing less than the spirit of the entil-e sehool, carried about by every !;>tudent, and attesting to the true quality D'f the Union man as he announces his attitudes to the outside world.

The Uni001 College Glee Club and The Women's Glee Ch.1b of State University College at Oneon- ta presented the Mozart \Requiem in D Minor\ (K. 626). The joint group was as·sisted by members of the AI- baiiiY Symphony Orchestra, and four outstanding soloists highlighted the performance. The music itself is a thtilling wot·:k, but this does not guar- antee a good performance. If the en- semble is not capable of quality match- ing the comp()sition, the power of the musie would be lost and the concert would degenerate into an attempt. Wednesday evening's performance, however, w:a.s more than merely a good try. 'l'he meanings Mozart ex- pressed through this music were eas- ily recognizable.

Hewitt, chairman of Union's GMlogy Department has been elected to the position of President of the National Association of Geology Teachers. This associaJtion is an or- ganization comprised of 1700 geology and earth science teachers from all areas of the world. Dr. Hewitt's new posiltion of pres!- dent is preceded by a year of experi- ence as vice·president of the Natio~al Association. He was elected to off1ce at the association's annual meeting, held in Kans-as City, Mo., in conjunc- tion with the Geological Society of America. Dr. Hewitt has taught at L'nion since 1956. ·He was appointed chair- man of the Geology department in 1960 and received an associate pro- fess~rshi<p the following year. He did his undergraduate work at Harvard, and obtained a doctorate in paleontology and stratiography at Cornell. Small College Role Among the several books and pap- ers he has already written, Prof. Hewitt recently had an article pub- lished in the Jour:p.al Olf Geological Educati'Dn entitled \The Role of the Small College Geology Department in Geological Education\ which appeared in the O.ot. 1965 ilssue. Dr. Hewitt patticipates in addition- activities in h.is field, among them are his being a member of the House ~f Society Representatives of the Amert- can Geological I~stitate, S~g~a Xi, ·the American Institute of Mmmg and Metallurgical Engineers, and the Pal- eontological Society. w.hole was a total success. The joining of the two glee clubs created an impressively strong group; combiilling complementary tone-color, and we-ll disciplined perforrruance skills. The chorus sang in unison for the dUl'ation (}f \Dies !rae.'' The ex- ecution left little doubt that the voices of U1e two chvbs were extremely wel matched, yet when the music required it, the clubs could separate, each sing- ing in a style fitting the music. At one point, the altos and sopranos sang in &otto voice an-d alternated with the tenors and basses. The contrast be- tween the two w:as in perfect concord with the sense of the music.

Roat•ing back from their discouraging loss to Bowdoin, the Dutchmen trounc- ed Hamilton, 46-22, before an appreci- ative Fall Weekend crowd. The win, the first victory over the Continentals since 1956, brought the Garnet season record to 4-4 and tied the Union- Hamilton rivah·y at 29 wins apiece.

'I'he Llirector of Union's Glee Club masterfulJ.y p-re- pared the men, and conducted Wednesda.~'s per- formance with precision. It was most evident that the ensemble was very much under Mr. V/ils()on's .:ontrol. F1·om the beginning, each entrance was signaled, each dynamic approved, and part to part balance maintained. Fugue subjects a.ppea1·ed throughout the piece. Mr. WHson's intense in- fl.uence over the enti-re ensemble was an e'ssential factor, since music sense could be made on1y by the diredor timing entrances, tempo, and dyn!!.m- ics \\'hile the pieee was under way. Mr. WHson did in J'art, direct with assurity, signaNi ng each t•nt~·ance, bal-ancing the sections and thereby achieving maximum effectiveness of the group. It was a joy to watch and listen to his meHiHuous product. It is fortunate that such a fine chol'Us was assisted by quality professional musicians, slnce any others may have d~ne nothing but dett-act from the excellence. At t1mes the score called for breaks in the vocal parts and effective perform- ance depended on a solid orchestra backgTo\lnd. At other moments duplication of parts be!ween voices and instt·uments absolutely n-ecess1h .. ted quality from both sectors.

The coefficiency of the orchestra and solo- ists constructed an excellent frame'l.wnk for the joined chorus. Trombone Solo The third section, \Tuba Mirum,\ was opened by a trombone solo. It was identified in t:he lyrics that followed by no less than, \. • . the al!gel trumpet sounding\; and for some bars follmnng, a most beautiful duet evolved between the b·om- bonist, Mr. Alex Mastern, and U1e baritone solo- ist, Mr. James Billings.

Throughout the work, Mozart exhibits a close eot-rebtion between the music's range and C()olor, and the lyrics. During this third section, the tenor soloist and his accompanying trombone fell out of .time. However, the two dosed the gap so subtly tha·t most listeners were unaware of the !'law. , h .

For the pur- poses Qf this review I have selected a few of the paperbacks of modern poetry on sale. The New American Poetry The New American Poetry 1945-60 is not as it claims to be a representative selection of Amer- ican poetry in general. It does serve, however, as an interesting representative collection of Gins- berg, Corse, Creely and about forty other poets belonging to this one stra·in of contemporary verse. Each poet is allotted about ten pages, and the result is a great mass of very similar poems, with only a vet·y few items outstanding. The overall quality of the poetry is not ver-y high; profund·ity is lacking; there is a garbage ()f gimmicks and a great froth of insipid protest. As for the humour, it is on the whole rather heavy-handed, only Greg- ory Corso and Kenneth Koch emerging crerlitahly. * * * * * Becket's Poetry A fl).t· bette!' pu:hlication by GrO\'£' is their edition of Samuel Beckett's poems. Snmetimes his work is obscure in expression and content and remains so even after liberal annotation. At best best lrnown as a noveli·st and dramatist, Beckett is a poet in everything he writes: he restores mu- sicality to poetry. This is one of the few books of modern poetry whieh is worthy of really care- ful study .. * * * * Ferling hetti Of the New Dil'€ctions paperbacks, the now famous - or notorious - A Coney Island of the :\-lind is the most outstanding book. Too much has been said about Ferlinghctti's poetry already. As a slick entet'tainer he is consistently successful; as a social critic he is perceptive, but by no means impassioned; as a poet ·of lasting quality his posi\ tion is, to 'say the least, dubious. His work should be enjoyed before it becomes irrelevant. * * Bosquet's Poems A lesser known poet, Alain Bosquet, has been cursed with translators whose language is insensi- tive and whose treatment is spastic. Fortunately, the original French text .and the translation are placed side by side, hence one can judge the poetry without the nuisance of inelfectual intennediaries. The poems are uneven in quality. The 'Premier Testament' - how very Villon - has moments * Bone Thoughts The best of the Yale paperbacks available is George Starbuck's Bone Thoughts. Here is a poet with incisive exact language and expression, bit- ing criticism and ironic humotu; theJ:e is nothing ephemeral a:bout Starbuck. His 'Dreams on a warm Sabbath' and 'Elegy,' the final poem of the book, epitorlize the best in his 1vriting. His style is his ov:n - not aggressively original but very personal, genuine and human. * * :'; Manhattan Postures In contJ·ast, there is ·something tired about the poetry of 'Manhattan Pa:stures'. Sandra Hoch- man lacks freshness and inspiration in her Writ- ing and there is something dvab and anonym~us about most of the poems. Granted, there is some light relief, but nothing to leave a positive jm- presffion. * * Day Break Lastly, Peter Davison's The Breaking of the Day is unusual in that it is not harsh, nor angry, nor in any w.:ty aggressh·e. The overall mooq is wistful and gentle - a pleasant change. A ver-y fine deseripti ve ptlet with !ill e<~,r for lallg\Ulg~, Davison writes in a studied and beautifully con- trolled manner. He has no world-shattering tales to tell: he is a craftsman, not a pO<et. Stu I) f., Cu: T the f. plans .

The the Reverend ( { By Walgio E. Orwa The author, Walgio Elisha Orwa, is a sopho· mme at Union. Be attended Linton High School and makes his home on Rusinga Island, Kenya. One wonders in what way Prime Minister (,. Wilson of Great Britain is steering the wheel's. Of course, we mu·st not forgert that Ian Smith is clos- er culturally to Wilson than is. Joshua Mk{)mo. Further still, we must bear in mind that Smith c. is an Anglo-Saxon, while Mkomo is a .savage, can.i- bal, and uncivilized jungle-man. From the-se above- mentioned fact's, one has only to use his imagina- tion on Wilson's game. No one would doubt the fact that with Smith as the head {)f Rhodesia's 1 ' government, the Union Jack will con·tinue to fly in Rhodesia, and \God save the Queen\ will con- tinue to be the national anthem, both of which would be pleasing to Wilson. Even the queen her- <· self would actually not like to lose the voice of four million people asking God to save her. Black die of hunger? To what extent would shipment for the sake of humanitarianism reach? How do you determine such an issue? This leaves us with the impression that economic sanction is but a game. Then what? Country he said that Africa was ripe for revolution. He was right, for the l!evolution is there now and Red China may as well take advantage of the situation to extend her course. Russia may a·s well come in, but we know that there are differences between Russia and China. Perhaps when China goes in, Russia might sit by and see how the Asian giant is getting his way in the dark con- tinent; perhaps not. But this we kn.ow: none of the Mrican ·states would refuse China's offer, so China may as well come in. But what would happen if China comes in? It is well known that the U. S. would risk herself to support any government--even a government she would not normally support-to fight the threat for freedom in the free world. The Congo and Dominican Republic have proven this fact. So we may as well expect s,mith to get some sup- port to stand against communism, and he may very soon be a hero in Washington, London or Paris.

Of course this has been justified by- the action of the U. S. in Domin- ican Republic an-d later by the O.A.S. The Organ- ization of African Unity can also raise an army to fight against \Imperialism\ ,as the O.A.S. had done against communism. But two things remain in mind. The 0. A. S. has a great army, perhaps the greatest in the world today. But the O.A.U. has no army. 8ven if O.A.U. had an army, the Congo experience ha's shown it unwise to use such a force. The Africans lmow pretty well that Belgium is thel'e to offer soldiers to evacuate people, and the U. S. is there to supply humani- tarian planes. It is still too early for the African to forget what happened yesterday. So even if O.A.U. had an army, there is fear as to what would come from the West. Would Anglo- Saxons sit idle to see their brothers being slaughtered by eanibals for lunch, supper, and dinner? Would the act this time be ccmsidered different from Mau Mau? Is it really possible for one to believe that this time an African struggle would be con- sidered fight for freedom, or a fight for democracy rather than a savage, cannibalistic and uncivilized act of primitive natives? This time 'Who will be rescued? A1as then, who will come and deliver Africa from her dilemma? Along the street Mrican women cry; in the jungles chHdren roam without education. On the other side, in the cities, white women carry pistols: they hang them around the breasts, they hang them around their thighs. Their bed'S are warmed by pistols.

Is \If white and black cannot live to- (!,ether in Rhodesia, then by nature the white must go ... Jiinority will not rttle Africa.\ How about the U.N? Here France ha'S ab- stained from the first. She has termed the con- flict internal rat11er than international because it is not between one State and the other. Thi.s can be taken care of very well by telling Zambia to kindle the fire for the U.N. to extinguish. Here one wonders what the U.N. is f{)r-to cure instead of prevent? The world knows well that this is what the U.N. is waiting to do in the cal3e of Scmth Africa. It is a great dilemma. Smith is determined \blacks will never rule Rhoedesia in his life time.\ Mkomo says, \Minority will never rule Rhodesia.\ Smith appeals for white supremacy. Mkomo ap- peals for democracy. If white and black cannot live together in Rhodesia, then by nature the white must go. For those \Vh() love peace, it is a pity; for those who love segregation, it is a de- light. For those who fear and hate war, it is sad; for those who value war, it is a time to rejoice. For those who believe Africa is still not ready for self rule, it is happiness; for those who know Af. ricans can only prepare themselves in free coun- try, is heart-breaking. But as sad as it might sound, as happy as it might seem, war is there, death is there for the young ones, the females, and the innocents. All will be given to death. It might not be today; it might no-t be tomorrow, it might as well not be in Smith's time, but Smith's Independence means bloodshed in humble Africa. Mr. Hann 12 ministers , 1 insane.

Why is he hesi- '' ta:nt to net the ball ? Yes, Wilson has gone to Rhodesia. True, he has told. the press \I have come on business, and I do not need any publication.\ W-as. Wilson really on business or did Wilson go to Africa to blind the jungle-men? What was Wilson going to do in Rhodesia: he had told the world that Britain the dilemma would not use military force in the event of a reacti-cm of 11 c. unilateral .declaration of independence by Rho- desia.. So what happened? Smith declared his on her goods by the U. N.? Is it really possible to believe .that \Uncle Sam\ would accept eco- nomic sanction? Who is blind to doubt the fact that Uncle Sam's great heritage and prosperity lie on \Free enterpri'se? Is it actually realistic to think that Johnson's administration would order Ford or General Motors to stryp their investment in any case? At least if we want to accept such unrealistic view, we must first wait until an amendment repealing free enterprise ~s passed by Congre'ss, and we may as well forget that. So as one ponders over the Rhodesia dilemna, he comes to the conclusion that the U.N. is not of any help, or if there is any heLp, it is not clearly defined. What rem.ains? The big western powers in the U.N. sometimes listen with sympathy to Smith's call to defend the deteriorating democracy in Africa since the coming of her Independence.

Winter Solstice I) (, alization. it does seem to make sense in the case of an 'interdepartmental' major such as the one proposed. The American Studies major at Union i:s possible with- out the formation of ·an American Studies Department. Any departmental rear- rangement resulting from the new major would seem to make sense only if the present structure is administratively un- wieldly. It would appear that any de- partmental shuffle for the creation of a 1<'ine Arts or Humanities < epartment would cause so many individual instances of conflict that satisfactory resolution would be difficult. For instance, any drama teacher could be equally 'claimed' by the English Department or a Fine Arts/Humanities Department. What hap- pens? Any- decision would be arbitrary; rearrangement for l'earrangement's sake i·s only waSlted energy, especially a major can cut across departmental lines. who wanted to take a course in the sub- ject-since anyone has a choi-ce of over 20 terms of work outside his major- and eliminating philosophy (as it is taught now) would not eliminate much 'Fine Art' from a 'Fine Art' major.

Send one to someone in the Southern Hemisphe1·e and make them jealous. Send them to your friends and enemies, too. Currently proposed is a new major in r the field of the humanities. So far three plans have been submitted: Fine Arts Major . ( a) a fine arts major that would in- clude courses in music, art, crea- tive writing, and drama; What would be left if p-hilosophy was eliminated from plan 'b' would be plan 'a', which has the advarutage of offering l.l ( t o! b) a fine arts and phil()sophy major, thatt would include courses in plan 'a' plus courses in philosophy; and c) a hwnanities major that would include courses in p1ans 'a' and 'b' plus courses in humanities, relig- ion and classics. Also under considera-tion is a consolida- tion of several of the small~r departme!lts in humanities •a consolidatwn paralleling the plans for' course combinations in the new major. Overlapping Problems Appear For example to what department will a teacher of ~ creative writing course (pal't of the proposed new major) and an English Literature course (not a part of the prnposed new major) belong'? Or, where will a teacher of Shakespeare and Introductory English be-in the newly formed Department of Fine Arbs or the Department of English? Many mo1·e dilemmas could he cited. :but aH are really only ingj;ances of one obvious fact: the humanities •are inter-related. qne ?'f the problems, then:,. is actually th1s: 1f the various humamttes overlap what are the b<mnds of the humanities 'deyartments ?' Specifically, if any plan for the new major is adopted, how can t~ere be· a satisfactory Departmental readJustment? This has been the tone of several ob- jections raised iby members «_>f the ~ac­ uity· but from a student's pomt of v1ew thes~ seems to oo a little problem-the organization of departments seems to be largely for admi~strative purp?ses, while the organizatiOn of courses m a student's progr>am is not. Wh~le there \may be some argument over thts gener- Problems As for the new major, which plan is best is a good question. Plan 'c' has the disadvantage of becoming a dilettante major, where it would be possible to graduate with the required number of courses (12 terms) in the majqr, yet hardly rising above the introductory level. However, pl:an 'c' ex:poses the student to many different professors and points of view, something that plan 'b' and especially 'a' do not do. Plan 'b's' g·reaitest flaw lies in the fact that the Philosophy Department and the vari·ous arts departments have extremely differ· l#nt ·approaches to their courses: the 1-'hilosoi!hY Department gives courses that are highly a.naly,tical and critical in preparation for the atmosphere :found today in gJ.\adu®te schools of Philosophy. The other departments 1n plan 'b' ap- proach their C<>urses in an historical- appreci-ative manner. If ph.losophy com,se-s we1•e t() be an integral part of the new Fine Arts major, it would mean that there would have to be a.nother brand olf course offered by the department. Eliminating philosophy as a required part of a Fine Arts major would not put it out of reach of anyone a united, though varied, approach to the llfiL..r.M~·~I'IWI fine arts. However, plan 'a's' boig disadvantage is that the fine arts program would be taught by a few overworked men. A Fine Arts major would have little room for variety of teaC!hers in his courses, es- pecially if he i·s seriously concentrating in one area of the :fine arts. Right now there are two men to teach music, there is one man to teach art, there is nlFbody at all offering a creative writing class, and there are two men teaching courses in drama. If any plan hoping to offer an attractive Fine Arts program to pros- pective students is to he had, the cata- logue will have to show more personnel -small intimate departments are fine, hut infinitesimal, und€rstaffed ones are .not-otherwise a Fine Arts major is merely a gesture that will only succeed in disil'usioning the students tha.t enter Union because of it. A Fine Arts major is a good idea for Worthwhile ~~~~~~~~i~~=~~~~~~~~ a college that will not be able, in the future, to compete in many fields with ~~;;;~Iilli!~~-£.. the ever-expanding and richly endowed New York State Univet'&ity- System. But a Fine Arts program will only be worth- while if it Is properly equipped with teachers, courses and da,ssrooms (the last pointing out the fact that with all the new building going on .there has been no provision to repl.ace the crowded and dingy art studio). Pl\operly provided for, a Fine Arts program could amount to something; as a program that would cater to a certain kind of student and that would provide for close counseling, a Fine Arts program is worthwhile.

It is not the damage done that incenses me, it is the blatant disrespecl for themselves and property that is ap- palling-. When the State University planted a $400 charge in the laps of its students, the policy change was sharply con- demned and only grudgingly agreed to. Two weeks ago, in Canada, thousands of students marched on government buildings in vehement pr?test agains~. a prop?~ed ,}illder- mining of that sacred ediface c~lled free: ~mtlon. . And again, this week, the preserv~t1o~ of trutlonless h1~her education was declared an unfhnchmg goal of the Umver- sity of the City of New York. It is curious, in light of these facts, that anyone wo~d be willing to pay thousands of dollars for an education that could be obtained gratis from the state. But even when recognizing the worthwhile advantages of a private school it is astonishing that a hike in tuition costs of $300 - ne~rly the total amount charged by state schools in a year - should go totally unprotested and virtually unan- nounced at such an institution. Yet, this is precisely what has happened at Union. . . This year's catalog notes a $600 tmbon for each of three terms under the new calendar. The charge is now $750 for each of two terms. Such swelling of educational costs per student is made inevitable by soaring expenses and equally heavenly goals. Even Yale and Princeton have found it necessary to raise tuition and board fees for next year. A small college like Union, though, cannot hope to fare as easily under higher prices. Its prestigious name and exemplary faculty will not sustain the clamor to enter Union's gates while attractive opportunities are dangled before prospective students by universities expecting nearly nothing for their services. 'l'he implications of this rise point, rather, to a still greater weakening of the small private institution in its struggle to coexist with improved government financed higher education. Competition with state schools for out- standing students will be impaired as the public universi- ties enhance their facilities with tax dollars, offering a more versatile program at a price few scholarship pro- grams can equal. As we try to expand, charges will again· dilate, leaving, in the dust of galloping state schools, a college that is no longer exclusively for the intelligent, but exclusively for the rich. 'l'he administration is unquestionably aware of the consequences which frequent and sizeable tuition hikes foredoom. The large scale development project now in preparation confirms Union's belief that the tremendous bulk of support for the school should flow from contribu- tions, and not from an intensification of the strain on student budgets. j Rushing advances in publicly endowed free institutions will compel Union to shift a still more massive proportion II of student financing squarely on the shoulders of endow- ment income, scholarship funds and gifts, if we hope to 1 escape the spiraling damage of further sharp tuition in- creases. Georgia's Gra'Ve Governor S. Marvin Griffin may be a staunch segrega- tionist, but he wisely confines more unbridled pronounce- ments to sympathetic audiences. In the North, where he is confronted by antagonism in all quarters, a patriotic dissertation on the holy inspiration of our constitution and the pristine goodness of our founding fathers, spiked with an earthy drawl and robust wit, is as far as he is willing to go. It was not too long ago, we were told by the former Georgia governor this week, that a man who died in that great state would pass into the next world with nothing to remind him of his home except a hole in the ground. His coffin, his tombstone, and every stitch of his clothing came from the North. Today, all is changed. The people of the South manu- facture their own clothing, build their own coffins and quarry their own tombstones. If Griffin is a fair indicator, they are also digging their own graves. The governor, being a religious man, could not help bringing the devil into his talk. His devil, strangely enough, looks peculiarly like Lyndon Johnson, and his hell is the executive branch of the government. Griffin is a states righter to the Nth degree, and there is nothing he hates or fears more than federal intervention in Georgia's affairs. By now, though, the governor should realize that even if the Georgians who pass proudly into the next world. do not go to hell, a federal \hell\ is on its way to Georgia in full force. States righters would do well to buy a suit, made in Georgia, with two pairs of asbestos pants. I ended our conversation stating, \Up to this time, I had alw.ays thought you Matthew W. Katz, '67. ,Past Presen The Company's first engine, the Wasp, took to the air on May 5, 1926. Within a year the Wasp set its first world record and went on to smash existing records and set standards for both land and seaplanes for years to come, carrying airframes and pilots higher, farther, and faster than they had ever gone before. In recent years, planes powered by Pratt & Whitney Aircraft have gone on to set new standards of performance in much the same way as the Wasp had done in the 1920's. The 727 and DC\9 are indicative of the new family of short-to-medium range jetliners which are powered by the highly successfu I JTSD turbofan. Examples ol current military utilizations are the J58· powered Mach 3 YF-12A which recently established four world aviation records and the advanced TF30-powered F-111 variable· geometry fighter aircraft. and Future Take a look at the above chart; then a good long .look at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft-where technical careers offer exciting growth, continuing challenge, and lasting stability-where engineers and scientists are recog- nized as the major reason for the Company's con- tinued success. Engineers and scientists at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft are today exploring the ever-broadening avenues of energy conversion for every environment .•. all opening up new avenues of exploration in every field of aero- space, marine and industrial power application. The technical staff working on these programs, backed by Management's determination to provide the best and most advanced facilities and scientific apparatus, has already given the Company a firm foothold in the cur- rent land, sea, air and space programs so vital to our co.untry's future. The list of achievements amassed by our technical staff is a v.eritable list of firsts in the development of compact power plants, dating back to the first Wasp engine which lifted the United States to a position of world leadership in aviation. These engineering and scientific achieveme11ts have enabled the Company to obtain its current p()sition of leader· ship in fields such as gas turbines, liquid hydrogen technology and fuel cells. Should you join us, you'll be assigned early responsi- bility. You'll find the spread of Pratt & Whitney Aircraft's programs requires virtually every technical talent. You'll find opportunities for professional growth further en- hanced by our Corporation-financed Graduate Educa- tion Program. Your degree can be a BS, MS or PhD in: MECHANICAL • AERONAUTICAL • ELECTRICAL • CHEMICAL ENGINEERING • PHYSICS • CHEMISTRY • METALLURGY • CERAMICS • MATHEMATICS • ENGINEERING SCIENCE OR APPLIED MECHANICS.

The topic comes from a quotation by Aristophanes. This debate will be a parliamentary- style debate rather than a con- ventional American intercollegi- !llte type debate. In contrast to American de- bates which are rru?ely held be- fore an audience, parl-iamentary debates depend a grea,t deal on the presence and active partici- pation of the audience. The mem- bers of the audience will be given a chance to cross-examine and question the debaters on any issue raised in the debrute. Heckling and booing on the part Oif the audience will be permitted.

It now includes approximately 60,000 white and Negro members in 70 chapters t11roughout the country. The em- ' phasis in CORE is placed on small, disciplined groups who are trained to absorb violence with- out reaction. Through their ex- amples af nonviolent methods and -;ntegration, CORE hopes to ac- c·omplish the breakdown of legal barriers standing in t·he way of equality for the· races and to ere- \ ate, in Farmer's words, \a soc- iety of friends.\ For their nonviolent protests, CORE employs sit-ins and stand- ing-line demonstrations, the lat- ter involving waiting quietly in line at places ordinarily e1losed to Negroes. This type of non-violent action was in use for eighteen years, but did not reach its climax until 1961, when a Freedom Ride was staged in the south to test for di,scrimina- tion at bus terminal facilities used in interstate commerce. As the national director of CORE, Mr. Farmer not only plans projects , for CORE members, but also takes part in them himself. He was among the original Freedom Rid- ers when that movement first be- gan in the south. Rats in the North In a speech read for him in Washington by Floyd B. McKis- sick at a massive CORE meeting, Mr. Farmer said: \We will not stop until the dogs stop biting us in the south and the rats stop biting us in the north.\ At CORE's twenty-first national con- vention in June, 1963, Mr. Farmer also said: \No one can stop the demonstrations. The question is: Can we keep them orderly?

Student Council President .Jeff Ratner asked the representatives at last Tuesday's meeting to con- sider a letter from Mr. Gilbert Jones, Director of Public Affairs of the International Rescue Com- mittee. The letter proposes the adoption by the U11ion College student body of a Vietnamese child.

They attempt- ed to discover membership h'ends over the last three years,impact of organizations on the campus community, future of the many Union activities, and needs of or- ganizations in a student center. An attempt was also made to de· fine an activity. An activity was defined as an organization which receives student tax funds, is open to participation by all members of the student body, and is con- fined to student participation.
