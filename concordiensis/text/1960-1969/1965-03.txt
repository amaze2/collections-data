For 'the coming academic year, 1%5-61;, the aggregate increase in faeulty salaries is a smaller pereentage of the base pay than it was for the current year, 1964- 1965. ~lost of the damage was caused hy. the foam from a fi1·e exting- t1isher sprayed over some of the desks, chairs, and on the walls Plld eeiling. £ntry to the locked ~tudy was made through one of the sidl' windows.

The room IS now being repainted and several eeiling tiles will have to be re- placed. It is probable that the room will be ready for use by the end of the week, or early next week. This is the first occurrence of its kind, but unless students ~e­ spect the all-night study the priv- ilege of using 1t may have to be restricted or revoked. Otherwise, Weekend Success With the exception of the L~­ l,rary incident, Freshman Pre~I­ dcnt William Blumenthal consi~­ ·red the weekend programs a b1g .. uccess. He emphasized the fact that according to the Student Clln~titution, the major goal of ,·uch weekends is to proviae good entertainment. The Rooftop Singers highlight- ed Winter Weekend with a con- .:ert in Memorial Chapel on Sat- urday at 3:30. Fnday night's blanket concert in the Alumni Gymnasium fea- tured a U mon quartet and the Sherwoods, a Cornell singing group. Financial re!Jorts for weekend aetivitics have not yet been com- piled. Olivier Stars In Henry V The movie based on Shakes- peare's Henry V will be present- ed by the Lectures and Concerts Committee this evening in EE 22. The showings will begin at 7:00 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. respectively. The plot is primarily .concern~d with the battle of Agmcourt ~n which Henry tried to t:egam 1- rench territory he ~ons1d~::red English property. In order, to end tlte fighting, Henry mayr1ed .the french Princess, Kathenne. Henry was a popular ruler and lt•igned from 1413 to 1427. Olivier Production Henry V is the pro~uct of the talents of one man, .S1r Laurence Otivier, who produced, . duected and stan·ed in the mov1e. His p~:rformance, and the perform- ances of all the supporting play- ers was considered excellent by John Mason Brown of thod Satur- day Review of Literature. The to-stars are: Renee Asherson as Princess Katherine, Harcourt Willmms as Kmg Charles VI of France, Leslie Banks and Robert ~ewton. Filmed During W. W. II Hany Gide~nse By Paul Fi(lltde lla Dr. Harry Gideonse, President oi B!\ooklyn College, called for a redefini-tion of freedom in the Cnited States, and for the abandonment of the it!ea that fJe€dom is an American institu- tion at a lecture held Tuesday morning. Research Sole Criterion Howe•·er, with 145 different chapters, there have been 145 dif- ferent criteria for election to as- sociate membership. £ligibility for election to associate member- ship is now based solely on the research of undergraduates, which must appear in the form of a wl'itten report at least by Com- mencement Day. Thus only those who are taking Honors or 56 courses will normally, but not ex- clusively, be considered eligible. Students who have done research outside of the Honors or 56 pro- giams, may also he considered for elrgibiiity. Departure From Past Professor Craig noted, \it must be clearly understood that elec- tion to associate membership is no longer dependent on marks or gl'ade indices. Since this repre- sents a -significant departure from the criteria of the past, it should be understood by all.\ Associate Members Elected to the society were: Andrew F. Acker, III (Physics), Richard M. Aron (Math.), William C. Dunning (Math.), Bruce G. Fike (E.E.), Richard L. Fraioli (Pre-Med.), James G. Garrison (Chern.), Michael I. Goldberg (Chern.), William H. Havens (l'hys.), Herbert E. Holder, (Phys.), Harley E. Hurlburt (Phys.), Stephen J. Isser (Chern.), Joseph A. Keane (Phys.), Melvyn B. King (Psych.), and Ronald R. Kneipfer (E.E.).

AAUP to Protest Tlw current year's increment, according to Professor Henry Ferguson of the History Depart- ment, the President of Union's chapter of the AAUP, (the Ame~:­ ican Association of University Professor'S) is 7.5% of the aver- age salary for the previous aca- demic year, 1963-1964. The pro- posed increment for next y~r is considerably lower than this year's figure. Prof. Ferguson said that an AA UP meeting will be held to consider sending a reso- lution to the Board of Trustees and to the administration protest- ing this downward trend in salary increases. The membership of the AAUP chapter on campus, about 75 members of the faculty, will also consider sending a let- ter to President-Elect Martin urging him to make faculty sal- aries and teaching loads his first consideration when he assumes !1is post as !'resident of the Col- lege. Will Affect 1\'Iorale Ferguson feels that this de- crease in faculty salary increases . will have an adverse effect on faculty morale and will definitely weaken Union's ability to both obtain and keep excellent faculty members and compete with those colleges with which we have tra- Jitionally competed. Provost Lockwood stated that (Continued on Page 5) Philos Split In Montreal According to Gideonse, freedom is tak.en for granted in the Un!ted States. It h!J.s become a t1red word used without very ~uch thought and very often misu.n- del\stood. Gideonse cited the Sit- uation at Berkeley as an example. Tllere he said, both students, faculty and administration ap- pealed to freedom as if they were defending it. Yet each group had its o\i\'n conception of what free- rlon1 is. This, he thought, lllus- trated the fact that freedom m_ust be redcfinl'd r .. r eac'h generation.

A unique place to dine with old European Atmosphere Scholar-in-Residence Union's valiant search for a scholar~in-residence was dealt a swift, hard blow when it was revealed that Shelagh Delagney, the prime candidate for the posi- tion was no longer available. Al- though Miss Delagney did not disclose whether or not she was married, she did announce the birth of a nine-pound, six-ounce baby girl.

Subscription 1\lanager In Conclusion • • • Union College is in a time of change, of great hopei and great promise. But we feel impelled in this last look to sound a note of caution as to what can be expected from the future. Union College exists within a certain restricted frame- work-that of a small college. The most it can hope for is to make the best possible use of the space provided for it \\-ithin that ft·amework. This includes freedom to adjust cm·riculum to best fulfill its educational aims, freedom to experiment with various calendars in ordel' to makt> best use of the curl'iculum, and fre-edom to experiment with education on a tutorial IPvel to take best advantage of its small size. The limitations of Union's framework mean that the campus can never become a cultural center for the creative arts. It can never become a city within itself offering the many activities that a big university can offer. It cannot experiment with unusual guest speakers (unless convoca- tion credits are required) because there isn't the assurance of an audience that one has at the leading universities. It ' cannot get national publicity from its athletic teams be- 1 cause they too suffer from the limitations of a small college. When one comes right down to it tile only area in 1 which Union College can distinguish itself is in the busi- ness of educating people! And this must be made as imag- inative and exciting a process as is possible. The size of Union must be used as its source of strength. Its size 1 permits expt>rimt>ntation of the type big universities can't undertake. The key to all of this is the faculty-student ratio. It must be kept low. There is no room for a middle sized college-such an institution loses out on the benefits of both worlds. Thus the primary job of the administ;ration must be the recruitment and maintenance of a top notch faculty. For this, faculty salaries must soar-they must take pri· ority over everything else. Only by takiJ:lg immediate and drastic steps along these lines can the best possible future for Union College be realized. This year there has been a step away, rather than toward the goal of grade \A\ faculty salaries. The 5o/o increase is well below what must be provided. For the most part, the faculty we have now is a good one. It is not however the close knit, innovating body-that we need. Why can't the new men whom we have to ac- quire be people who dare to be different, who regard teach- ing students as the most vital part of their lives? If need be, they must be raided from other schools with lucrative offers. We suspect, having gotten a preview of the develop- ment program, that priorities list new buildings as hlgh as faculty salaries. Brandeis University drew national pub- licity some months ago by abandoning its plans for con- struction of new buildings, diverting the money to faculty salaries. It is not a disgrace to follow the lead of another institution when that lead is so vital to this college's fu- ture. We would rather have every bullding on this campus look like the Mode1·n Languages Building if this meant we , could have a faculty second to none. It has often been said that there is no heavier burden than a great potential. Union College has that potential , What it needs now is a man who will stop spending his time at Trustee's meetings explaining how pretty the cam- pus will look in ten years with the new development pro- gram in effect. It needs a man who is not afraid of trying any new plan proposed in order to lead the college to ful- fillment of its potential. · Letters· to the Editor To the Editor of Concordiensis: COMMENT ON THE IDOL BATTLE DIRECTED TO· WARDS CONCORD; AN IDOL-CONCORD Fearless, undaunted heroes warred Upon the bloodie·ss plain.· They fought with dull and blunted sword; Their sabers flashed inane.

S·ineerely, Joseph Musser, '66 To the Editor of Concordiensis: Re: Mr. Newman's letter: Thank you very much for tak- ing the time and interest to com- ment on WRUC's new format. Perhaps through this letter, I can help you to understall!d just what goes into ·setting up the prog1-am schedule for this student activity. WRUC is on the air seven days a week, eighteen hours a day. This in itself .is a feat that few college stathm:s can match. We program rock and roll as well as good populm· music, jazz and c:lassical. Those few people who li:sten to our classical music pro- grams have expressed their ap- proval and even though the audi- ence is negligible, we have no in- tention .of dropping it from the air. Last semester we pro- grammed two hours of rock and roll a week, at least one hour of classical a day, one to two hours of jazz a Jay and filled the re- maining time with good popular mu·sic. 'Cnder this format our li:stening audience was rather small and stution member::illip was low and hard to keep. This semester we have programmed a considerable amount of top 40 mu;;ic. The results: Station mem- bership has soared by almost 100 pet• cent (now the largest activ- ity on campus) and we are quick- ly becoming the number one sta- tion on campus. (Informal sm·- veys already taken show us only behind two others, both of which are twenty-four hour rock and mil outlets.) Many people have criticized us for not taking the lead in intro- ducing the so called \Superior\ type of programrnlng to the union market. Our answer to them is College Handbook The Publications Selection Com- mittee is now accepting applica- tions for the position of EDI- TOR OF THE UNION COLLEGE HANDBOOK. This publication will contain much of the material formerly contained in the Fresh- man Record and Freshman Hand- book. Certain vital sections of the catalogue will also be includ- ed. This is a new and important publication at Union and the edi- tor will be able to make a sig- nficant contribution to the Col- lege and particular the student body in arranging this new vol· ume. All interested students should pick up an application fonn at the Student Activities office and return the completed form by Marclt 8, 1965. tw0-fold. One, WRUC is a stu- dent activity and for that reason must program what the students wish to heat•. Thi's we do. We play all types of music and the l'atio of classical to rock is de- termined by the amount of stu- dents favoring each type of mu- sic. Actually the number of stu- dents who have shown interest in our classical programs does .not even justify the number of hours it now claims. Secondly, WRUC is a business. To stay on the air it must take in a tremendous amoun,t o·f advertis.ing. T0 get ad- vertising you have to have Hstell- ers. lt~s as simple as that. If Union College gave us four tho'll~ sand dollars. a year to o.pera.te the station then it would be a different story. We tried to give the campus your type of p1·ogramming fo·r <>ne semester (and never heard a word from you about it) .and it failed. It is a mistake we will not make again. If you do not care for what 90% of this cam- pus considers its favorite music, then your complaint is not with us but with the admissions de- partment. The program 'schedule printed in last week's Concordy lists many different types of pro- grams, all types of music. If you can not find anything there to suit you, may we then suggest the purchase <>f an FM radio or a good Hi-Fi. Richard Ferguson, Vice-President and Station Manager, WRUC To the Editor of Coneordiensis: As a student in Doctor C. H. Pearce~s Psychology lla class last semester, I was surprised that the course evalualtion poll re- sults were ·so low for tlus course. I do not feel that the resu.lts re- flected the feeLings of m<>st of the students in thi's course. I spoke to all the members I could who are now enrolled in the course and I found only three persons who had filled out the evaluation sheet. There were thirteen persons who had not filled it out. I gave the same poll to them that was given by the Cuncordy. Twelve students returned their rating to me and here are the results:· Prep·aration for class: th1'€e said this was not applicable, nine gave an average rating of 3.67. Lecturing ability: three said this was not applicable, nine gave an average rating of 3.22. Course value: twelve gave an average rating of 4.00. There were twenty-three stu- dents in this course last sem€ster and I would appreciate it if you used these results to express the opinion·s of the majority of the class, something which you evi- dently did not have before.

John- son's, T() the Editor of Concordiensis: I would like to add to your edi- torial eon0erning the Publications Selection Committee. This new appendage to the Union College campu's is about as necessary as an appendix, to my way of think- ing. First of all, the officers of a campus organization are the busi- ness of that organization and no- body else. In the second place, to suppose that a board, the major- ity of whose members are Ull- versed in publication will be able to make any positive contribution to the selection of editors, busi- nes's manager.'3, etc. is as silly as board'! As it is we have enough biased\ headhunters could decide whether the world is round or flat. Thirdly, the least they could do is get the fiasco o-ver in time for the new officers to get ex- perience. The Concol'dy is lucky, its fate is even now decided; but the Idol must wait 'til April. If the men .being trained don't get the job, we'll have a real fun thing on our hands next year. I am assured that the board wm ju:st approve the old editor's choice; why then have such a bo·ard? As it is, we have enough time~sponges on this campus for a dozen colleges. Then I hear that the board will prevent nepo- tism. I am not sure what th:s means. I would hope that the board has the intelligence to see that continued control of a pub- Friday, March 5, 1965 lication by members ·of any one fraternity means only that mem- bers of other fraternities lack the nece'ssary interest. No editor would want to destroy the organ- ization he has bui1t up by replac- ing himself with someone other than the most qualified. Lastly the boa.rd says it will enforce the choice of \responsi- ble\ leaders. I suspect that these are the words of men sold out to public relations. If we are con- cerned here with errors of ta:ste, I would say the least tastel-ess thing o-f all is the board itself; its existence is a slur on the charac- ters of the editors. Rodham E.

It has often been said that thf're is no heavier burden than a great potential. Union College has that potential. What it needs now is a man who will stop spending his time at Trustee's meetings explaining how pretty the cam- pus will look in ten years with the new development pro- gram in effect. It needs a man who is not afraid of trying any new plan proposed in order to lead the college to fu1- fillment of its potential.

His main theme was that en- gineering has not kept up with technology, has become conserva- tive and blurred at its boundaries, and must pass through a \critical period, a period of momentous change, a time for r·eappraisal, reorientation, adaptation and re- newal.\ End Extended Trip The Philos' success at McGill was better than it has been in the Iast few years. Although one two-man team did better last year, the team as a whole did bet- ter this year. The McGill trip was also the end point of a trip through Canada for Alon Jeffrey and Bob Stolzberg. The two had debated at Queen's University and the Royal Military College and won at both, but lost to Carleton College (Canada) due to the misstatement of the resolu- tion, and the subsequent aliena- tion of the audience. The Carle- ton debaters came in last at Mc- Gill. As a result of the trip, it is hoped that some Canadian schools might come down here for some future parliamentary debates. . . -:.~:·,. -.- .... .-··· True artistry is expressed in the brilliant fashion styling of every Keepsake diamond en- gagement ring.

Hamilton's record was boosted to 8-7 by the victory while Union's ·droppecl to 8-11, the first losing season in four years. , Coach Evans has now compiled a 20--20 record in his two years as varsity coach. This season for the Garnet has been one of both spirit ant! dissappointment. Lack- il1g height and a sharp outside shooter, the hustling quintet won In their most recent victory, the matmen overpowered their opponents, defeating them sound- ly hy the score of 18-11. While there were only two pins in the l•nth·e match, one by each team, the Dutchmen outclassed the Saxons to such an extent that thE-y were able to ~ecure a re- sounding victory without the five point maximum from a pin. Jan Wemer shows grim determination to hang on in match against their first four games by sheer Clarkson. ·determination and team effort. Improvement In their last three meets of the year, Coach Allison's men looked very strong. Battling a tough Clarkson squad at Umon on tne twentieth of last month, the Dutchmen almost pulled off an upset. They were in the meet up until the last match, and finally lost by the narrow margin of five points. Without the key loss ot Heavyweight John Werley due to an inJury, Union's chances of win- ning would have been greatly en- hanced. Following a loss to a very strong Colgate squad, the Garnet traveled to Alfred for their final meet of the year. With the strong showing of all the team members, especially Dale Schneider and R1ck Engles, the matmen powered. theh· way to their second victory of the season. Tomorrow the squad will of- ficially close out the year as they compete in the first I.C.A.C. wrestling tournament, here at Union. Participating and compet- ing against the Dutchmen will be Alfred, St.. Lawrence, R.P.l., Hobart, and Clarkson. The for- mat for the tournament will con- sist of competition in ten weight classes, ranging from 115 pounds to unlimited weight. A team trophy will be awarded to the winning team, in addition to which there will be the present- ment of individual medals to first and second place finishers in each weight class. Although R.P.I., whirh is undefeated this year in dual meet I.C.A.C. competition, is favored to win the team cham- pionship, there is hope for a strong Union showing_ The Dutchmen will be competing ag·ainst two teams thev have al- ready defeated in regular season competition and one whieh they came very close to beating.

Dismal Season Such a finish would be a most pleasing result to the nJ.atmen, who, thus far, have had a rather dismal season.

The freshmen clefeated Trinity, 50-44, and RPI, 66-29, t() finish the year with a 4~1 rec.ord. A number of frosh turned in fine performances, among them Dick Amesbury, Norm Dovberg, Fred Fagal, Joe Hunting, Paul Windt, and Dick Corrigan. The Dutchmen flni::;hed the year with a 5-5 recm·d. All that now remains is the New York State Championships at Syracuse today and tomorrow, and the EastPrn Intercollegiate Championships at Yale next Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Representing Union at the State's will be Phil Evans, Jim Garrison, Jeff Gow, Dick Heyman, Jim Mogal, Paul Shields, Dick Siers, and Chris Cassels, plus a lat·ge freshman contingent.

Trackmen Take Third Place In U of R Relays Tonight in the field house, at 7, Coach Ketz's trackmen will compete in a quadrangular meet v:i.th the University of Rochester, Cortland, and Hamilton. Last Saturday, the Dutchmen finished third in a field of eleven teams at Rochester, in the fourth annual University of Rochester Indoor Relays_ Coach Ketz was e'spec.ially pleased with his men's performance·s in the shotput. Paul Woodell captu1·ed first spot with a heave of 48'8\ John Monison third, 45'3¥.! \ and John Wilcox fourth, 45'1\ Wilcox's series was his best ever. In the pole vault, Bob Newbegin tGok third spot wi·th a jump of 11'6\. In the 8 lap sprint medley relay the Gar- net finished fourth, in a time of 4:06.3. Rochester won this event in 3:48.2. The Dutchmen placed fifth in the mile relay, in 3:45.4- Rochester again triumphed, in 3:38.2. Shot Put Strong Coach Ketz, in summing up hi's team's chances in tonight's meet, declared the squad to be thin in overall depth, but pointed out that it po~sessetl some \good quality\ in several events. The shot put, for instance, should be a union strong point, with Woodell, l\Iorrisun, and Wilcox. Gary :\!orris will ue t;nion's threat in tht: high jump, and Bob ~ewbegin will cany the L'nion colors in the pole vault, backed up by Clint Brcrwn. Bill Cassidy and ~eil Campman will broad jump for the Garnet, and AI Pan- off and John Peters will be the sprinters. Panoff will be seeing action for the first time since he pulled a muscle last year. The 600 is a Union weak spot. Ron Cherinko vdll run it instead of his usual event, the 1000. Bill Monfred and Neil Campman will handle the 1000. Dave Ring will run the mil.e, and will be join-ed by Bill Beavers in the two mile run. Frank Darmiento wil tackle the hurdles. This event will be stronger for Union when Ron Giam·,o]a, a high l'lchool record- setter, comQ's out for the team. According to the coach, there are few freshmen out, but those who are, are \good possibilities.\ After their first loss, they bounced back to beat St. Law- rence by 15 points. St. Lawrence later nosed out NCAA hopeful Rochester, 93-90. 6-3 at Intersession Before intersession the team boasted a 6-3 record. Whether it was the intersession layo:(f or the stronger competition the Garnet faced in the final games that led to their collapse, one can only speculate.

Jlle more game the rest of the ::;cason, an 81-77 decision over Pratt during Winter Weekend. That the Garnet won as many games as they did can only be aseribed to the desire to win shown by the starting team.

The competition within a conferen•ce generates interest and excitement for the losing teams as well as , for those in contention for the championship. TMs year's Ivy Le~gue .' race for supremacy in baske·tball is a prime example. Even though ' the battle between Princ·eton and Cornell on the final day of the i regular ·season was the deciding contest, the University of Penn- 1 sylvania, in third pla~e in the Ivy Le~gue, ~nd Yale, ~aving a poor . .,: season, both ,played Important parts m Prmceton's victory. · 1 With one week remaining on the schedule, Cornell was unde- feated In Ivy League competition. They had slipped past Princeton by one point in their first clash and had visions of nothing less than ·p: a tie for top honors. Then they played a mediocre Yale team at · Barton Hall on the Cornell Campus before a capacity crowd. The even ccmtest was between Yale's ability to move the ball, but lack of good 'shooting, and Cornell's good shooting, but poor ball handling. With twelve seeonds remaining in the game Cornell was behind by .l two points and had possession under Yale's backbo•ard. They failed to set up a shot and the final score was 71-69 in favor of Yale. Corne.ll Falters With games remaining against U of P and Princeton the follo'Y'.·- ing weekend, Cornell faced quite a task. Their los'S to U of P on l''riday made a Saturday night victo·ry over Princeton a necessity, but Bill Bradley was too much to handle for the Big Red and the \ favored Tigers were victorious, 107-84. The least inf.ormed basketball fan in the Ivy League knows this story, but if there were no official Ivy competition would he still be able to l'elate last week's happenings? 1 think not. The league competition is what creates the mtere'St and the following that the stuctents and the public give to the schools. ICAG or Bust In the formation of the Independent College Athletic Gonft1r- ence, Union has joined Alfred, St. Lawrence, Rensselaer, Hobart, and Clarkson in an attempt to create publicity and interest in the compe- , tition among the member schools. The first step of formation has been taken, but where is the follow up 7 No €fl'orts at :publicity seem to have been made at all. Which team is in first place in basketball compet1tion and what are the standings of the teams? 0 Although the ICAC does not meet the standards that had been envis1vneu uy tne proponents of the \Potted Ivy League,\ it does have tne possib1ftti~s for expansion. If, however, expansion is ever to be real,zed, much more must be done in the meantime to generate Interest m the conference. that made the first half of the season a success. Though not a particularly high scorer, Peskin was continually driving toward the basket, making opponents foul, and making key baskets to stop opponent's rallies. Tom Dr- bellis, although hampered ·bY a sore shoulder throughout the sea- son, provided the determination and go-go drive that brought the Garnet from behind in a 84-78 victory over R.P .I. In general, balance was the key to Union's victories. In their last game, four players scored in double figures. Hamilton high points of the game were Marty Goldberg's scoring his first lr 2 poi,nts of the season and Ross MacKinnon's 6 points and 5 re· bounds. Perhaps the loss can be ascribed to the many mi{)cues committed by the Garnet. But more important, it was related to the sheer exhaustion of the team that gave its greatest effort at all times against a far su:perio1 ~ competition. (AP)-The latest college bas- 1 ketball statistics released by the NCAA show that a good offense is letter than a strong defense. The top twelve squads offensively have won 80% of their games while the first dozen defensive specialists have won only 70%. MIAMI LEADS SCORING In the Hamilton game, the Continentals jumped off to an eady lead with five quick points by Ernstrom. They never re- lmquished that lead. Indeed, the Garnet never even got within 10 points after the first quarter.

Professors Nominate A student may be nominated for a fellowship by any faculty member of the school he is attending. After the nomination, he re- ceives an application for aid and an essay question he must answer. On the basis of these forms the directors of the Fel.lowship eliminate many of the nomin-eees, and invite the remaining group to an inter- view at Princeton. After these interviews are coneluded, the scholars who are to receive fellowships are chos-en. On our c-ampus, Professor Allen nominated Jay, and Professor Underwood nominated Rosen- bloom. Jay to Study History Jay intends to study Modern European Intellectual History. He has been admitted to Princeton and Columbia Universities, and is presently awaiting word from Harvard and Yale Universities. Dur- ing his Junior year, Jay studied abroad, attending the London School of Economics He plans to use the Wilson Fellowship during his first year of graduate work and the Danforth award during the re- ma:ining years. Oscar Ros-en-bloom is currently planning a career in Political Sci- enee, with emphasis on African Studies. He has received acceptance from Columbia University and is waiting for notice from Yale Uni- versity, his firsrt choice. During his Junior year he studied at the University of Edinburgh.

The Atomic Energy Commission, the Na- tiC?n!ll Ins.Mutes of H~alth, th~ National Aeronautics and Space Ad- mmis~ratton, the N atwnal Science Foundation and countless othel' agen~Ies support research ~m a large scale. Such research i's not restriCted to the natural SCiences. Recently there has been increas- mg support for research in the social sciences. Some have even pro- pose? the creation of a federal agency specifically charged with sup- portmg research in the humanities and social sciences. The future shape of our society wil be largely determined by the decisions gov- ernment agencies make on what kinds of research and development should be conducted and on what use should be made of the results of research. ~orne Words of AdvicP Some words of advice from one young mind to othet· young minds bent on a literary career: Do not make literature your life. To become a writer it is not nece·ssary to live for literature. It is necessary, however, to beeon1e a man or woman, as the case may be, first and then to express with. whatever means are at hand the force that drives you through this spinning world. It seems that there are now so very many young aspiring at·tists leaving school or not bothering to go at all, with Ginsburg and Salinger under their belts, heading towards the lofty palaces o.f lite1•ary stardom. One must develop one's mind and en- large one's scope if he is to even hope for success in this highly com- petitive area. A rich and exhaustive education in as many fields as po·ssible should prove an essential prut of tb.e writer's bag of tricks .. To be proud of the fact that one's works are not popular seerus a bit of inv'erted snobbery. A work of art is not created so that it may be put a'1·ay with mothballs in the attic. If one does not write fnr a public, nobody will ever read what one has produced because it has been written fot• one:;elf exclusively. A1·t i's not a means of ·self-gratification or self-expression entirely, but, rather, a process of self-to-someone else communication. Otherwise, it is WOl'thless ~1s art. To take no notice of the work of those who are writing in your times and who have written in the past is to ignore a large and Yital part of the world in which you live. The works of other writers may broaden one's Yisi:on, mar alert one to unthought of techniques, may provide something to rebel against. Imitation may aid the young writer in the discovery of his own idiom. This is not meant to encourage the up-Rimbaud-and-at-'em attitude that spurs on many- literary a~pirants. ~ o honest, mature writer can achieve unythilig- valuahle tht·ou~h mimicry unuless his purpo!'e is a comic or satiTic one. Writing and Reality Anything anyone says about wt·iting is just about as important as anything that anyone else may say. It is up to the writer to be a part of his 'n'iting and make his writing a part of the him that gives more of a meaning- to the collective human eonscioU'sness. It is up t() the reader not to be \taken\ by second-raters and to allow what is \'aluable to become a part of his little existence. A good piece of literature contributes something to reality. The course of history is irreversible. The world is never the same once a good piece of liter- ature is adde<l to it; it helps to shape and add significance to the universe.

The L'nited States contended that special aJlp ropriations, s11ch as those for the peace-keeping operations in the C.ongo and Cyprus, are. includPd under Article 19. The SoYiet L'nion and -France, taking the opposite position, refused to pay their assessnu11.ts for these opera- tions. In addition, these twe recaUitrant nations were in arrears for more than two years. Othe,r nations were also inareears. The United. States, long before the opening of the 19th session, began to pres·sure · those states which generally followed its lead to pay up. The pres-. ~ure was notably succegsful with such nations as the Republic of China and several Latin Amedcan nations. However, both France and the Soviet l7nion came to thl' 19th session still refusing to pay their arrears.

I'm very well acquainted, too, with ma.ttet•s diploma tical; I understand the pressure groups, conservative and radical; About all racial prejudice I'm teeming with a sheet of news, With many chee·rful facts about the way the Arabs treat the Jews .. - I'm very g-ood at compromise and unifying politics, I know the names of delegates whose policies appear to mix; In short, in matters vegetable, animal and mineral I am the very model of a Secretary-General. I know our mystic hi'story, from Syngman Rhee to Hammarskjold. I ponder hairy questions, whose solutions I am never told; I quote in elegiac;s all the crimes against Hungarians, And all come in in chorus like a meeting of Rotarians . I can tell undoubted delegates from hangers-on and phoney ones- They all come round with problem's, and the most of them are money ones; Then I can thump a shoe, of which I've heard the music's din afore, And wink at Mrs. Khrushchev from the best position in the floor ... Then I can wri-te to Washington in Babylonic cuneifonu, And type it up in triplicate, with all the copies uniform; In short, in matters vegetable, animal and mineral, I am the very model of a Secretary-General. In short, when I know what is meant by UNICEF and ECOSOC, When I can go outside without a fear of mortar or of rock; And when I can escape the dreadful Russian Kommissariat; When I have learnt what progress has been made in modem Germany; When I hear more from Texas than of Congole-se in harmony; In fact, when I hear anything of elemental unity I'll say the Secretariat is brilliant - with impunity ... For my p-eace maintaining fo1·ces, though they't·e plucky and adventury, Have never yet been paid for since the middle of the century; But still, in matters vegetable, animal and mineral I am the very model of a Secretary-General.

Fa\ ult.y .:\.dvi~tlr Condolence On behalf of the students of Union College the Concardiensis extends its sympathy to Professor Hugh Alan Nelson on the passing of his wife, Marjorie. Responsibility Concordiensis of Union College is not here to provide practical training in journalism for aspiring Horace Gree- leys. The newspaper is published on this campus for the distinct purpose of providing a source of information and a means of expression for the entire college community, particularly the students. No student newspaper is a private venture. On the contrary, each one has the uniquely public function of serving as a spokesman fo,r campus attitudes, ideas, and ideals. Thus, the Concordit'nsis cannot estrange itself from the campus and expect to continue serving in its capacity as a vital agency of the student body. We have a respon- sibility to the students, and over the years we have per- sistently tried not to shirk it. By the same token, however, the college community has a responsibility to its newspaper. Ideas must flow on a two way street if Concordiensis is to be successful in re- flecting the beliefs of those it serves. This is an academic community whose citizens are all immersed in higher learn- ing. and together we comprise a vibrant center of intel- lectual activity. The newspaper has the potential for uni- fying this activity and presenting it in more than a super- ficial, piecemeal manner, but it cannot do anything without the cooperation of more members of the faculty and the student body. We want to hear your ideas and we want to know your reactions. But most of all, we need your participation in the writing of this newspaper. Only when more than a handful contribute each week can Concordiensis validly express the thoughts of the collegiate mind. U.N.

It is no surprise that most uni- versity students are not aware of ICY, and it is even less surprising that, when they do hear of it, it becomes an object of cynical humor. Gratitude Professor William T. Winne is retiring as faculty ad- visor to Concordiensis after over three years of unflagging vitality and earnestness in the performance of his thank- less duties. The faculty advisor is everybodies' scapegoat. The students call him a censor, and the trustees upbraid him for each unbecoming phrase that devolves from a stu- dent's unkempt mind. But Professor Winne carried the burden with glee, and now that he has. served his term, it will not be easy for the next advisor to fill the void left in the Concordy office.

To The Editor of Conc()>rdiensis: Our coHege has t:he good for- tune to possess a spacious, beau- tiful campus. It is g:raced with lat·ge, grassy fields, ag;ed, majes- tic trees, and a babbling brook. However, large parts of the campus appear as r11s\tic as they must have in 1795.

The average peasant, who, as a group, comprises nearly three- fourths of the total population, has realized that the only way to advance his position and more im- portant, his son's position, in his society is through education. Yet, there is a certain cynicism pre- valent in the country. Many feel that they can never realize their goals and desires-that they will be frustrated in their hopes. Thus, despite a concern fo1· the achievement of material affluence, they lack the drive we often ex- pect to go along with these de- sires. \It becomes easy, but in- accurate,'' said Allen, \to label these people as lazy.

The concert is a regularly scheduled convocation. The concert is being presented with the support of the New York Council on the Arts, and tickets for the community will be available at the door. When the 1964-65 series wa·s announced by the 1\'Iuseum-College Music Committee last September, the third concert was to be on Ma1·ch. 10. However, conflicts be- yond control of Curtis and the Al- bany Symphony necessitated the change in date.

Several members of the Council recommended fur- thet· alterations in the awarding of points for participmtion in cam pas sp.orts and activities. Gary Morris, President '65, movetl to refer the report back to committee for completion of the changes and corrections; the motion passed.

'Is Reviewed By A.A.U.P. , The Union College chapter of I the Allll'l'iran Association of rn- iversity Professors met last Thursday, March 11, to discuss its response to the report of di- minished increases in faculty sal- aries this year. The rise in the faculty salary scale will drop to 5% for the academic year 1965- 66 from 7.5% for the current year. According to Henry Ferguson, President of the Union chapter, the Association voted to re-acti- vate rthe Committee on the Econ- omic Status of the Profession to study the sa'lary situation. This committee had been dormant for several years, since the salary scale had been rising satisfactor- ily in the eyes of the Associa- tion.

Rob- ert Francello of Sigma Chi brought up the fact that a $5.00 rushing card is umealistic. It was Francello's feeling that the cost of the rushing card should be high enough to just cover the expenses of the rushing booklet which is published each year. ·The remainder of the I.F.C.'s budget would come from an assessment of all houses at the beginning of each year. Tl1e present bal- ance in the treasury is $681.71. I.F.C. expenses eaeh year include $600 for the 1·ushing booklet, $400 for the National Interfraternity Conference, $75 for the adoption of an orphan. The council pass- ed the motion to finance the I.F.C. operations through an equal as- sessment of all houses at the be- ginning of each year. Blood Drive Lyn Parker spoke to the coun- cil about the campus blood drive for the Red Cross. A large tro- phy is awarded to the fraternity with rthe greatest percentage of members donating blood. Parker explained that anyone who do- nates his blood is able to draw 011 the Red Cross' blood bank if he ever needs blood in the future. If hlood is obtained from a com- mercial source, the Red Cross will make good for the blood which you use. Rushing Rules Jared Wolf presented the list of rushing rules for next year. The rules, except for minor re- visions, are the same as last year's. They were tabled until the next meeting. Dan Prigmore announced that the pledge presidents' council will be meeting soon to begin organ- izing the annual Help Day ac- tivities. He urged all houses to report the names of their pledge presidents.

Here indeed is a combination of childlike simplicity of thought and strangely cunsununate artistry of mood that rings truly like the fervent writ- ing of thirtcenth-c.:entury Cathulidsm. It may seem that I am shovel- ling this parallel on a little too thickly, but it must be remembered that while the humelinecl::; of one i;:; a bit too colored by romance, the rude directness of the other has been tainted by the nearness of social stigma. EmutionaBy, of course, the ::lpirituals are far from simple. Ther generally speak with an honest belief about u. golden and silvery material heaven, the ultimate land of milk and honey where all earth- ly travail and suffedng will be compensated for. It is a kind of speech that goes deeply into the roots of existence and exposes the utter nakedness, the stat'Ving: for happiness, the yearning for fulfill- ment of the human spirit. The strange mixture of pathos and piety in th\' spirtuals again suggests a strong kinship with medieval ecstasy. The spirituals show a remarkable kno.wledge of the Bible. Many Bible stories, particularly the more dramatic ones (such as the account's of Samson and Delilah, Daniel in the fiery furnace, David's fight \·ith Goliath and the slaying of Abel), might be con- strued as having symbolic significance for the Negro slave - his trials, his hope for eventual freedom. There are other themes, of course; for there are spirituals that concern death, warn against sin, are ·superstitious or vividly capture the melancholy. The Seculars The seculars, imbued with wit and irony, reveal many of the petty hardships and everyday concerns of their originators. There is neither the sharp imagery nor the sometimes-subtle rhythms of the spirituals or the blues here, but, rather, a simple and charming art of narratiYe CJUite similar to that of colonial ballads. The Blues f'omewhere a-long a dark, abandoned scar of a road, leading from a honky tonk ot· a cotton field m· a chain gang to that al'ea of the hu- man spil'it where despair and confusion with life's unreasonableness mingle, the blues wa·s born. There are happy blues, sad blues, talking blues, and just about any other kind of blues that one can imagine. For the most part, they arc entirely a personal matter, presenting one individual, caught in the unrelenting grip of circumstances, who relates those forces whieh act upon and drive him through this spin- ning world. The words of the blues singer provide a means of expres- sing th undefeatable human spirit in the face of adversity and the de- mand for frtedom as ,;omething concrete, to be won by defying bar- rier~ of Sl'gregation, pon-rty and hate. And this tells us whJ· the blues haYe rome to mean so much to P\'ople of all backgrounds and of all descent. If the blues are ever sad, it is not the sadness of surrender. It becomes, at last, an affirmation of the beautiful and terrible worth of the Earth. It grows into a p1·aise of what is and could be. It becomes an impassioned, coarse-strained praye1· and avowal of the human condition. The poetry of the blues is simple, direct, often filled with many fresh, particular and powerful images. Take, for instance, W. C. Handy's \St. Louis Woman:\ You ought to see dat stoYe~pipe brown of mine Lak he ov:n de Diamon' Joseph line; He'd make a cross-eyed woman go stone blind Blacker than midnight, teeth lak flags of truce, - Blackest man in de ·whole St. Loui·s (Blacker the beny - sweeter is de juice}. There is something warm, immediate, penetrating jn these lines - an essential quality that defies the most precise scholarly analysi·s. It is, of course, a little dangerous to talk about a group soul or a group temperment. Yet, the net average reaction of a people does suggest some ·sort of composite psychological portrait. The poetry of the spirituals, the seculars and the blues has provided a hardy and ·sensitive pronouncement of a certain outlook on life: a remark- able statement of an exploited, handicapped and illiterate class which ha·s added an important element to our national culture. ••••••••••••••vvwtti'tT STUDENT TRAVEL • College Tours • College Study Programs STUDENT & FACULTY GROUP TOURS Arranged at LOWEST PRICES Books Now open for Spring and Summer Vacations Schenectady Travel Bureau, Inc.

Friday, Mc;arch 19, 1965 Many New Nation~· Are Ruled By Single Parties By Alon Jeffrey Elections have held the spotlight in world politics during the past few weeks (except for minor disturbances in Selma, Ala.). The election is a very ha,ndy tool for both democrats and dictators. For 1 the democrat it becomes the voice of the people \\~ho thereby govern themselves. For the dictator, however, it becomes the tool by which he ju><tifies his rule. Example's of hoth the>;e type>; of elections have occurred within the !a>;·t few weeks. Nasset·'s \Landslide\ The Right Honorable Gatnul Abdul Nasser only managed to ~:ramer 99.99',(, of the vote in the elcdion recently held in the united Arab Republic. A ~ad, sad cununentary for a man running unop- 1 ' posed. While there n:l.ay well be no one of high enough stature to · run against Nasser, the .democl'atic nations of the world hardly have difficulty finding sumeone, just anyone, to run against the most popular man in the country. A far cheerier picture appem·ed in Chile recently. Here Presi- dent Edurado Frei, elected last fall, was able to present the voters with a refo.rm v:hich enabled hi's party to win control of the lower house. Until this past election, the lower house was deadlocked and had refused to act on the program which Frei presented. The uppet~ house is still in the hands of hostile parties, but the Frei govern- ment was given a greater number of Senators than it had previously had.

Disliked Doctors This column, however, is about som~thing that happened in the early fifties, when I was teaching the required eourse in American Civilization to senior engineers. The room was the fir>;t floor northeast ror11er of Bailey Hall, now fissioned into offices. Old-time desk-chairs grew weed-like from the con- crete floor on stout iron stems, Dnd iron joints held the parts firmly in pla('e. To hold my thirty Pnginf'rrs equallr firm in place, I had decided that morning to read them a chap- ter of Melville's White Jacket, the one in which the ship's doctor is shown amputating a sailor's leg. Judged by this passage at least, Melville had about as much admiration for doctors as had Moliere; and lest this allusion be lost, the admiration was not merely ab- sent; it was negative. The chap- ter includes some brilliant de- scription of the handsome young sailor lying on the butche1·'s block, his health and life in For three Generations •• c Those Who l(now. Have been recommending - HERSHEL By Prof. Carl Niemeyer the hands of the aged, desic- ~·ated surgeon, Cadwallader Cu- tic_le by name. The operation, ~1emg r>erformed on shipboard 111 the early nineteenth century, is done without anesthetics; the doctor lectures to the spec- tators while performing it, and (the sailor having failed to survive the ordeal), the doctor is able to announce a public autopsy for the next day. \He's Out\ I was rather proud of my reading of this passage, which I had discovered could be de- pended upon to draw some kind of response from the most leth- argic of hearers. Since that day, however, I have never read this chapter in public, despite its proven power, for on this occasion the results were rath- er more than I bargained for. The surgeon's efficient saw was rasping against bone, every de- tail made vivid by Melville's highly charged prose, when I looked up in the reading. My first impression was that one of the men in the back row had disappeared, and my first, idiot-like reaction was: how had he managed to escape? The question was speedily answered, when one of the remaining !wads in the back row, with a dispassion which may be pe- culiar to engineers but which, I suspect, is common to male youth generall~', said, \He's out.\ Indeed he was. And not only out. In slipping from his chair he had succeeded in strik- ing his forehead against some .non-moving, metallic pa1t ·of the ('hair in front of him. Bloor! oozed from a nasty gash. Although my experience in- dudes three years of teaching in the Chicago public sehoul sys- tem, fate has been kind to me in respect to classroom acci- dents. I had very little idea ·of what protocol demanded, al- though I did stop reading. I had an impression there were far too many people in the room, even though several were already on their way to the telephone. I seem to recall that the number at the Col- lege Health Service was re- ( Continued on Page 3) MAURICE B. WALTER Mauriue B. Granbart & Sons '\3 Union Graduates. in Graubart Family'' 166 JAY ST.

If these problems can be solved, there will no longer be 1 a need for the army to act as \.protector\ of democratic institutions and oust duly elected officials as it did to President Frondizi not long ago. The Justification of One-Party Rule There are many valid arguments for one-party or one-man rule in the developing nations of the world. Many, if not most, of the recently independent nations, as a result of their fo·rmer status as • colonies, do not have a real sense .of national identity· and sense of sacrifirr for the benefit of all which mu·st attend such a common nationality. A one-party rule, so the argument runs, enables the na- tion to ge>t on its feet as a nation. No ·longer does the tribe hold greater impot·tance for the individual. ' Similarly, the argument is presented that the tasks of moderni- zation are so overwhelming that without the unity of one-party gov- ernment, the nation would be bogged down in relentless parliamentary haggling. While this may well be true, there is considerable differ- ence between the institutionalized one-party rule of Ghana and the virtual one-party rule of the Congress p~J.rty ht India. By and large, the argument for one-p.arty rule loses its validity when faced with the example of Indfa. Here other pru·ties do conten(l. for Vl)tes, and t indeed as India moves farther from independence, the Congress party has almost consistently received a lower percentage of the total vote. On the other hand, in the countries like the UAR and Ghana, there is no chance for other parties to even contend for votes. There is no & choice. \Power Corru1>ts .. · .\ • Psalm and : for them to a few note: ing), the s means lax times, dul'ir ture, \Rom~ followed) I races to see uext bar fi1 friends, the had the dul ing out of I 1 with each • forty-plu8 n bert Ninth introduced other hand, the English lent, the 1 woodwinds : Strh For dynan first half o: little, if an ample, a pa, ther loud) v the other h (rather sof (Perhaps, •tb ilar treatme: er Music\ phony Gonet ter ).. In cor Q string workl While the argument for one-party rule suggests that India is a a real exception, it still loses its validity when faced with the well- known statement by Lord Actin, \Power corrupts, absolute power con•upts absolutely.\ The problem which the nation desiring demo- crrutic institutions and a democratic political enviro.nment faces is that there is almost no way to remove institutionalized one-party rule. Quite obviously it cannot be voted out. It is also obVious that a party which has for some time controlled a nation utterly and completely will not voluntarily give up this power. Hence, the natinn i•s faced .· with the barren choice of continued one-party rule or revolution. To ll a nation which is trying desperately to rise from the depths of pov- erty and illiteracy, the choice of t·evolution may well be the choice for extinction by greedy neighbors. It is also quite probable that, Berlioz and animated, if and were ex ing analysis ~ i formed wou purpose than try. Let it concentratim as in the case of Argentina, revolution will ·so disrupt the nation that it will take decades to even reach the level of development before the revolution. And again, as in the case nf Argentina, the spectre of the return of one-party or one-man rule may keep the nation in a non-democratic syndrome. There appears to be one answer which is itself almost incon- ceivable. The·se nations, if they value democracy, must tolerate the pai?fully slOIW development whi·ch might accompany democratic insti- tutiOn's. Yet the psychology of underdevelopment strongly mitigates 1 against this option. It may well be for this reason alone that the democratic nations of the West will be forced to continue foreign assistance for many years.

Pro- fessor Blodgett, one of the two editors of this new edition pointed out (irt an interview) what he considers the major contributions of the volume. It contains a large section of material which has either not yet been published or collected. previous concert performances, fulfilment of anticipation, and those stand:nrls of musical excel- lence dictated by my ear and mind. There was, indeed, much noise Tue-;day evening. Audience noise. Orchestra noise. Coughs from the hall intermingled ·with squeek- ing dadnet answers and um·uly mHsie stands (fortunately, I mig-ht add, no music was spilled). But, aside from these extraneous disturbances, like the scratches on a record, only two distinctly important areas seream for my t'riticism: (I caH them sectional ('ohesiveness and dynamic control, ul' the lack of same. Disuuity By sectional cohesiveness I mean the ability of groups or sec- tions of the orchestra to play as one; this involves not only play- . ing the same notes at the same time but also .shading them alike. The most flagrant violators were the strings. If an opportunity nrose, as it did in the middle of Psalm and Fugue by Hovhaness, for them to scrape violins or drop a few notes (if one was look- ing), the strings were by no means lax in this pursuit. At times, dul'ing the Berlioz Over- ture, \Roman Carnival,\ (which followed) I think that they held races to see who could get to the next bar first. Next, came our friends, the French horns, who had the dubious pleasure of be- ing out of tune and out of time , 1 with each other for the entire forty-plus minutes of the Schu- bert Ninth Symphony-and they introduced the work.

Since that time, there have been a number of new publications, yet none of them have adhered! strictly to that of 18!Y.2.

Sports Photograt>her Tenure And Torpor For the past few years tb'~ practice of perishing for not publishing has been disclaimed from Brooklyn to Berkeley as the sole cause of the distress in higher educa- tion. It is evidently believed that once college professor~ are rid of the pressure to print they will metamorphosize before the eyes of marvelling students from unbearable classroom bores into vibrant, colorful and intoxicatingly cre- ative teachers. We hate to shatter the fond hopes of such worthies as the part-time residents of New Haven, but speaking from practical experience, we at Union can say that the expiation of \publish or perish\ rules from our nation's campuses will not necessarily release a flood of imagination from the dry wells of certain faculty minds. Here at Union the ancient query \Is there a teacher on the faculty?\ remains agonizingly applicable in many areas despite the uniquely weak demands to publish, and the ex- tremely liberal provisions for obtaining tenure. Theoretic- ally, a member of the Yale faculty would rejoice to be teaching at Union. He would at last be allowed to trade his writer's cramp for chalk dust. He would teach and teach until he had whipped his students into a frenzy of intellectual fervor, and he would offer to them the best education conceivable. Realistically, however, he may be excited for the first few years like all young professors at Union, but onc-e he received tenure, and constructed a nice sturdy set of lecture notes, it would become inviting to settle down, relax, and await attrition. Not being forced to remain active through writing will not help the uncre- ative teach-er. The sad truth is that at Union, Professors never perish, they just fade away. College for the Masses Dean Lockwood's statement last week denouncing the bill which would extend the Regents Scholarship to bene- fit those who study out of state is shortsighted and nar- rowly conceived. The Regents program is designed to offer higher education at lower costs to bl'ight students. It is not designed to keep college bound students within the con- fines of their home state and away from other facilities which are willing to accept them and capable of instruct- ing them. The administration at Union College fails to realize that the immediate future is bringing with it the awesome burden of educating the masses in advanced disciplines. The burden will be carried by the government and not by private colleges alone. If this task is to be met effectively there must be extensive cooperation between individual states and institutions, with considerable aid from the federal government as well The Board of Regents estimated last week that dur- ing the next six years tb,e cost of expanding the physical plant of New York's public and private facilities for higher learning, to contend with surging enrollments, will exceed the value now placed on all universities and colleges in the state. The operating cost alone will be forced to rise more than $1 billion. By allowing Regents winners to leave the state, the enrollment will rise somewhat less explosively, and the facilities in New York will not be crushed under the tremendous demands of a population in need of educa- tion beyond high school. It will be difficult for Union to adjust to these changes, but when viewed from a position of detachment, an educational revolution seems inevitable, and turning away from the problem will not make it disappear.

John Ehrensperger When I arrived at the Union The main characteristic of the College campus last September, I average college student is the thought I could adapt myself to common field of interests which the. America_n college life very is a little limited. According to ~as1ly.

I t·a- ther have the feeling of hav- ing been thrown into a medium which is completely new to me. For this medium I expression is \the college society,\ because it is quite closed in its 'self and separated from the rest of the world. To show this I want to l-ist a few of my observations: Families Divided The boys and girls, who go to college are no longer members of their families; they are members of the. college society. They do not write much to their families They live on a campus which i~ separated from the rest of the world by more than a fence and a few gates. College boys usually date coUege girls. Other girls are usually called \townies \ and along with this expressi;n goes a neg-ath·e implication. There exists a college fashion. The col- l~g_e t·ules seem to replace the crv1l laws. A special rollege-se- curity-police is watching to see that these laws are fulfilled. If a student has a job aside from his studies he quite often gets it on campus. Will Never Merge I wanted to become an Ameri- can as much as possible. This means I wi·shed to become indis- tinguishable from the others. Now I think tha:t I 1 ll never merge com- pletely into the American college society, and I don't want to any more, On the other hand I am sure I could find some other place or 'society in this country where I could merge quite easily. This country is so large that you -can find everything. Whenever I get a chan.ce to have a look into the outside world, I always find new things, new ideas, different men- talities, new ways of living, other societies. All in all, I can say that, even if I don't merge completely into the college society, I am seeing a lot of things, and my year at Un- ion College ts turning out to be a very rich experience. ~EW BERKELY TE::-;SJQ::-; (Berkeley, Calif., March 18)- Tensions mounted again at the L'niversity of California when school officials banned the sale on campus of a controversial maga- zine containing obscenities.

Me- An old alumnus is disturbed as he reads what Unicm students are trying to do with the honor sys- tem. It appears that a large per- centage are in favor -of reinstitut- ing same. I am puzzled what mo- tivates these advocates. Where- fore this letter. My class was 1926. I entered Union in '22 under the honor sys- tem. I can tell you categorically that it wa·s a colossal failure in my time and, from what I could learn, it had been a failure for many years prior to my time. I can't, of course, give you any ex- act estimate of the percentage who violated the honor code, but 75% would be a conservative esti- mate. During exams we were packed so closely tc:Jgether that all one had to do to obtain un- authorized information was to turn one's head to the right or left and read his neighbor's paper. The teacher usua·lly left the class when the questions were given out and when he did there was a free for all. Some students were load- ed with crib notes, others with books which they consulted freely. Others consl'llted their neighbors who would oblige willingly, and still others left the class room for their fraternity houses where they finished their exams with the help of upper classmen or their books and notes. No one ever 'squealed'-only one was 'caught' and expelled. The result, as you might ex- pect, was a general lowering of scholarship in Union. Many re- lied on cribbing to get by entire- ly; others relied on <:ribbing to get good grades. Thi's state of affairs was particularly exasper- ating to those who studied hard and got their good grades honest- ly. They had to work like hell to keep up with those who cheated and set up a fa1se standard. I re- member one exam (it was Ger- man) for which I had tutored sev- eral students; in thi's exam I ob- tained a mode of 86; my 'pupils' were all in the 90's thanks to our honor system. The situation was so bad that the faculty felt compelled to do something about it; they did: they threw out the honor system in the 1924-1925 school year. This was the best thing that ever happened to Union. Thereafter, everybody had to study, including the ath- letes, to many of whom studying was a novelty. Apparently, proponents .of the honor system haven't consulted any of the old grads; I am sure they will all agree with the state- ments made above. So, why all .this non'sense about the return of the honor system ? Do you boys think for a moment your rp.oral tone is better than that of your <:ounterparts a gen- as an example. These days, pro- . miscui·ty is an accepted fact of '. college life; Union is no exception. Compared to your sexual athletes and nymphomaniacs, we led a monastic existence. I am ~ure you regard as 'square·s' those who '' preach sex decency; and you will continue to so regard them untif you are parents yourselves with 'teen age daughters spending • • week-ends at fraternity house·s. (Incidentally, I'm not a parent). So, gentlemen, -this is my story. If Union means anything to you, '·' give the matter more thought; consult the 'old timers'. My ad- vice to you is to drop the idea; it just doesn't work .

Chem Men Read Papers The tenth annual Intercolleg- iate Chemistry Symposium was held at the State University of New Y or~ at Albany on March 13, 1965. It wa·s sponsored by the Eastern New York section of the American Chemical Society. Rep- resenting Union were four sen- iors who were among thirteen students to present papers. Also present were students from Rus- sell Sage, Albany State, St. Rose, and R.P.I. The chemi:stry majors from Union were: James T. MacGregor, who discussed Acidity Functions for Aqueous Basic Solutions, and Stephen Joseph Isser, who spoke on Aspects of Cyclization Reac- tions of Aliphatic Methoxydeazo- detones. Richard Joseph Klimow- ski and James Carlton Garrison ~poke on. Analysis of Gold Cyan- ides via Polarography and Prep- aration and Study of Stable Ion Pairs respectively. Functions as Society The Symposium is conducted in the manner of a l?rofessional meeting, in order to give the stu- dents some idea of how profes- sional societies operate. The Un- ion men presented senior research problems which they had worked on as part of their Chemistry 56 program. The student talks were divided into four panels which followed registration and a welcoming lunch. The final event of the aft- emoon wa·s a lecture from the main speaker, Dr. Bernard Wun- derlich, who discussed Melting of Linear High Polymer Ct•ystals. Dr. Wunderlich is an Associate Pl'ofessor of Chemistry at R.P .I. He was educated at Goethe Uni- versity in Germany, and earned his Ph.D. in Chemistry at North- we-stern University in 1957. After the elections, President Nahmias announced forthcoming WRUC policy changes, especially with regard to the disc-jockeys and personalities that will get on the air next semester. Nah- mias said that since WRUC is now Union's largest student ac- tivity, \things will naturally have to be put on a competitive basis.\ He added that the station antici- pates a membership of over one hundred in the fall, since there will be very few losses because of graduation in June, and that. the Class of 1969 will surely turn out in record numbers, as did the Class of '68 this past semes• ter. Those wanting to broadcast on WRUC would have to prove themselves capable, efficient, and extremely listenable.

DICTATORS Page2 Concordy Sports WHITMAN PAGE3 Spring Squads Search for Successful Seasons Stickers Face Practice Meet By Howard A. Goldberg Every year with the first spring thaw, comes the mud and the Union lacrosse team. Because the mud has prior- ity to the practice field, the stickers have been alternating with the baseball team in using the screened-in infield in the field house. When head coach Bruce Allison gave the word for official work- out to begin last week, 31 turned out including 17 returning letter- men. Most of the aspirants had already been working out by them- ::;elves for a month, afraid of what would happen to them if the coach got to them first. Heading the list of returners is last year's entire attack of John Hann, who wa::J the leading scorer last year with 13 goals and 8 assist's, Jeff Schulteis, who had 5 goals and 4 assists, and Randy Westby, who had 13 goals and an assist. Bob DeMichele will again lead the defense with help from Tom :Vlorgan and goaLie Bob Dickman. The third defense position 'Nill probably go to Ray List but others in the scrap for the opening are John Brennan, Bob Marshall, Mike Modern, Vince Russo, and Bill Orford. , Experienced Midfield Coach AUi·son will have plenty of experienced talent running- his planned three midfields. Back for their final year in the Garnet and Grey are Victor Fazio, Steve Hopkins, and Larry Dittleman. :vlarc Hurlbut, George LaPorte, and Howie Wiedman are all back for their second year of the stick game. Wiedman was also a high. scorer last year, alternating between midfield and attack, with 13 goals and 6 assi·sts. Besides these, others fighting for the remaining midfield berths are Wally Baket·, Rich Clemens, Stuart Dym, Fred Hay, Brendan Hutchinson, Dana Jones, Bill Parry, Gary Raden, and Torn Spencer. Sophomores will be playing important roles in Coach Allison's plans for going undefeated. Lindley Parker, second high scorer with 21 points on last year's fre'shman team, will prohably be the fourth attackman. Ware Fuller, high scoring freshman last year, will be starting somewhere on the first three midfi·elds. Fuller is also an· excellent face off man. Facing off is probably one of the most under- rated techniques in lacrosse. Being able to come up with the face off con·sistently means that your team is taking possession of the ball and therefore will be in control of the g-ame. Scrimmages Planned When the bell rings for the opener agains·t Wesleyan on April 17, the varsity will not be lacking game practice, for Coach Allison has planned a full schedule of scrimmages over spring vacation. On Sunday and Monday of the vacation the Garnet will be at Lehigh University for two games. Returning after the Lehigh encounters to the Union campus to correct what mistakes they may make against Lehigh, they will close out the vacation w.ith games against Williams and Colgate on Friday and Saturday respectively. The following Wednesday the University of Massachusetts rolls in for a scrim- mage followed by a game with the Alumni on Saturday, April 10. Improvement on last year's 3-6 record is almost sure to come because of specific improvements whi·ch will ultimately produce more goals, a lack of which last year was a primary reason for the var- sit~·'s dismal record. Firstly, the varsity will have much mot·e game practice before its opener. Secondly, the 17 returning lettermen will be a solid nucleus for Coach Alli'son to build his team around. Last year's team was dominated by sophomores and the year of experience will un- doubtedly help them produce more goals. me Out: Cowboy's Corral By Andy Colb Along with all the press re-J weight, age, and class.

Good Field, No Hit Woodell, Ring, Newbegin Score By El'ic Singer With Spring officially due to-. morrow, Coach Art Lawrence's· varsity baseball squad has begun hustling. to get into shape for its opening on April 10 against King's Point, With seven re- turning lettermen forming a solid nucleus, the team appears to be fairly strong. · The pitching looks solid, with veteran seniors Gary Brown Frank D'Aillard, and Rick Crooke~ slated to do most of the hurling for the Garnet. Erown and Crookes are this year's co-cap- tains, and each is capable of hold- ing down an infield spot when not pitching. Brown is the team's regular shortstop, and Crookes plays first base when he is not pitching. Rounding out the infield, the Dutchmen have veteran Bruce Fike at second base, and Larry MacDonald at third. Handling the catching chores will either be Randy Kuhl, a recond year DAVE RING breaks tape as he wins his heat in the 1000 meter run. catcher, or Al Hrdlicka. Outfield Also Strong By Gary VanGraafeiland In the outfield Union also seems to be well supplied with talent. 'The Dukhmen find them- selves with three top men in Art Marshall, Greg Olson, and Rick Erdoes. Marshall will play first base when Crookes is pitching, and ready to fill in for him in the outfield will be Bob McAd- ams, who is also available :for in- field chores. The team finds itself with good depth in addition to a strong first line.

Netmen Open April 14 Vol. 94 By Jack Etkin With almost a month remaining ~ ~. · before the opening match against ! '·Ba Drew, Coach Beaudry is not at all certain of the pros:Pects for this i year's tennis team. Several ex- ~ ' p·erienced players plus an a:bun- ' dant number of sophomores indi- ' cate a successful team. Back from last year are George Masters, the number one player, Pete Walker,' number six, Rick Apter, number four; and Mark Unterberg. The top sophomore prospects are Chris Komisarjevsky, number one man~ on last year's fre'shmen team, Sandy Levine, Bill Danchuck, and ·Aaron Rutherford. Sophomore John Farnum, a good high school player who did not play last year, ~ is another sophomore hopeful. Schedule Unchanged The schedule is the same as last • year's with seven horne matches and five on the road. Besides Drew, the other opponent's are Harpur, Hartwick, Trinity, Stev- ~· ens, Hobart, RPI, Hamilton, Mid- dlebury, Vermont, Syracuse, and Rochester. Coach Beaudry feels that Vermont, Syracuse, and Ro- chester will be the toughest foes. • Practices this week have been limited by the damp weather. Continuing bad weather could severely hamper the chances for ~,> a successful season, since a young team requires a good deal of pre- season work. Coach Beaudry feels that this , year's freshmen should be strong- er than last year's. Armen .Man- asar and George Miller, both of whom played in high school, have been impressive in practice. u.

Spring practice dates? Absurd? They wanted me to scout for the Dallas Cowboys Football Club. There was a second request. They wanted me to list the names of player's whom I thought were pro material.

Only if high school coaches treat Evan's re- quest with sincerity can Union ob- tain athletes, with excellent grades, about whom I could, in the future, write to the Cowboys. If, however, high schools ignore Evan's requests or treat them as had originally intended to treat the Cowboy's letter, then athletics at Union will become a joke and all players will become draw- backs.
