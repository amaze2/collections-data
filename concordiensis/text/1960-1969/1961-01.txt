Blynken and Nod, Faculty Failures, which begins on page one of this· newspaper, is bound to imply certain comparisons in- volving Union's faculty. And so it should. But the sons of Union have little to fe~r, because by all odds, any objective examination would confirm the fact that the overall calibre of faculty at Un- ion has been historically, and continues to be, unquestion- ably superb. But there are always a few rotten apples in the bar- rel of knowledge and Union's faculty is no exception. Pro- fessors often cry out, justly, about the excesses of our society; the corruption, the conformity and the apathy which has regrettably become part of our culture. Facul- ty members, however, are themselves a part of our society (and an important part at that) and they are not always exempt from the very societal failures which they so vo- cally denounce. Not since the publication of Union's own \Beer for the Kittens\ (a \Peyton Place\ of pre-war Union College) have faculty failures been so graphically described as in Pr-ofessor Wheeler's \Wynken Blynken and Nod,\ and in the interests of accuracy, the Con- cordiensis would like to add a few faculty failures who inhabit Minerva's domain. Perhaps Union's Wynken is the professor who has written, or collabor-ated on a textbook, which his depart- ment is forced to use. Faculty salaries should be higher, we agree, but cheating a student by forcing him to use an inadequate text is a poor way to supplement one's earn· ings. 1 Blynken, Union style, might well be the professor who trudges into class, nine and a fraction minutes tardy and regularly conducts nothing more than an informal \bull\ session! and then has the audacity at regular intervals to complam about the fantastic opportunities he is passing up in private industry to remain a professor. Many of our professors themselves have been the vic- tims of Nod, wh() !U3es his more advanced students to col- lect and write material which will eventually be published under Prcfessor Nod's own byline. \Neither do J condemn thee: go, and sin no m.(.lre.\ c By Jonathan Throne I was very interested in the Linville and Riggen \'Letter to the Editor\ which ap11eared in the December 9th issue of the Concordiensis; for, this past sum- mer, I attended the university Menendez Pelayo in Santander, Spain, certainly Western Europe's strongest police state. If there were to be any \stigma of a po. lice state\ on a campus, would it not seem probable to exist in a greatest degree in the state of Su Excelencia Francisco Franco than in our democratic state? In Spain, true, there is an ·overt police state, a physical entity preventing freedom of ex- , pression against the government •and the Church. Nevertheless, in Spain there exists individuality, a natural individuality of such totality as to split Spain apart during the Civil War. It is a natural individualism that is not a movement and that needs no shibboleth. A person is not \an individualist.\ His ideas are not \ismed\ as they are here. Here we find the essence of the difference between control of the intellect in Spain and in the United States: in Spain, while there is not political f1·eedom thete is intellectual individualiszr: (i.e., if people can't ex:press their individualism, they at least think as individuals); in this country while there is political freedom there is intellectual conformity and a resultant dangerous lack of even the desire to express one- self. This campus reflects the condi- tion of· Schenectady, which has surrounded and all but engulfed us, and of the \dragon\ that has gained more than f(lothold on our campus. The dragon of con- formity and lethargy lives in every student who doesn't t.ake an interest in his own self-ex- pression, in professors who have lived so long under \the system\ as to be blind to its faults, and in \directors of the institution\ who \mean well' under archaic sta:nd!l:rd~. In some ways this \intellectual police state,\ naturaliy fostered by moneyed interests and other advocates of the status quo which abound at Union, is more danger- ous in the end than the overt po- lice state. For, while under the police state individualism broods, under our system individualism staggers and is overcome. The students and professors in this country have been cowed into a half-angry silence. Let me give you an example of censorship in Spain. I had a pro- fessor in Santander who was a poet. About nine years ago he wrote a poem on the death of his father, killed by Franco forces during the Civil War. No one could publish this poem in Spain, but ihe very fact that he composed this poem shows a re- belliousness, an attitude of con- troversy ali but lacking at Un- ion. And then again neither could a poem, article, or expose about Union be safely published on campus, i.e., without \commen- tar:y\ by controlling interests or the1r helpless law-enforcers. Thus 1 what is the result of this discussion 1 It appears to be that we deny ourselves intellectual freedom and controversy, and that a sort of \Generalissimo\ rules over Union to make sure that our intellect doesn't evolve into a · revolutionary state.

Great- · ly m. seniority's favor is the fact that Ift the .pas! !t l1as essentially functioned effiCiently. Most of all, OI![y a few valuable proposals have 'been presented that could ~ucce~:jsfully supplant the senior- lty sy,stem. Foundations are already trem:b· ling under such ingrained institu- tions as the filibuster and the se~iority system of promotion. It IS the latter of. these two which causes this colqmn to be written. An explanation is needed, for no ma~te:t;~ who argues over the s~mor1ty .system of Congress, 'he fmds the debate touchy, personal and enthusiastic. He also finds it mid-understood. rr:he. unwritten law concerning semori.ty states: The individual se!ving ()!1 a Congressional Com- mittee w1th the longest uninte- rupted service on that committee b~comes its chairman, providing h1s party is in the majority. This means that ability neces- sarily plays a secondary role to tenure in advancing in status. To be~in at the be_g;inning, each Senator or Representative begins accumulating Congressional \sen- iority points\ from the day he assumes office. When deemed worthy, the House and Senate's Co'!lmittee on Committees will assign a Congressman to serve on a committee. He then begins accumulating \committee senior- ity points.'' As the other mem- bers change committees or retire, the young Congressmen are moved up a notch. If two con- gressmen are appointed concur- rently to the same committee service in the Congress itseli p,rov~s ?f no ~alue. Congressional . semol'!ty . p_omts\ play no part m deternumng \committee sen- iority points.'' Therefore the s,um,total of points, as in \Bung- lmg (see previous column) are of no determinite value. ' Zybilk Bilked .The rank of the two new com- mittee members, chosen simul- taneously, is dei!ided in the odious manner known as alphabetical o~·de~. Consequently, Senator Zy- b!lk 1s ranked lower than Senator Aboob. 1'his is unfortunate Zy'- bilk is. extremely capable· and unquestionably deserves seniority over Aboob. • The merits of the seniority sys- tem are most frequently dis- cussed pertaining to Congression- al committee chairmen. It also plays a pru't in the selection of sub-committee heads and confer- ence com1nittee chairmen. Some say that a Congressman becomes the chairmen of a committee throu~h endurance rather than any Judicious criteria. . These Anti-seniority advocates cite many wealmesses of the sys- tem. Foremost, is the argument that committee chairmen may frequently be poorly qualified. Anothe~ fallacy is the uninterupt- ed sen,ce clause (unwritten but alw.ays used) which forces an ex- perienced congressman back to th~ starting .line should he have missed a session because of illness or advancement. The latter was tl1o ens~ (}f Alben Barkley, upon re-el.ertion as . U.S. Senator after serv1ce as VICe President. An- ?ther equally important assertion IS the fact that the seniority sys- tem ~ends to favor one geographic locahty m•er oth~l's, and frequent- ly represents a minority . ele- ment. Such is the case of the Southern Democrats and Mid- Western RepUblicans, who in past years have occupied more The most promising suggestion thus far presented, is the one proposing the selection of com- m}tte~ ,c'!lairmen by .party caucus With :majority vote ih closed bal- lot. O.thers have beB.n automatic rotation of chairmanships and se- lection by the majority leader of each :~louse. Also afoot are move- ments; to remove much of the power· now exercised by commit- tee chairmen. In the present day Congress, the committee chair- men c:an easily \make or break\ the back of a bill. Through his ~ff9rts ~e may kill it by holding 1t mdefmitely. ' Iniquities Ap))arent The iniquities of the seniority system have become increasingly apparent over the past few ~on.ths. They can be easily stud- lea m two specific case histories. 'l'he first pertains to the ap- parent dissatisfaction of many :f!:ouse,: members upon the eleva- tiOn of Representative Adam Cl~yt()n Powell to the chairman- ship <:~f the House Qommittee on Labor, Representative Powell has Ol:le of the poorest attendance recorC!.s {)f any congressman and J:as ft•eguently voted out of party line .. Still, if ~he seniority system contmues as 1t always has, Rep- resentative Powell will become. a c~mmittee chairman in the E1ghty-Seventh Congress. The1 other instance is more strikil1g. It concerns the control of the House Rules Committee. Much of this controversy will un- fold in the few days before this column goes to press. The liberal group: of the House of Repre- sentaUYes is maneuvering to con- tro! . the committee in order to fac.lhtate passage of liberal legis- latiOn, The Rules Committee de- cides upon the action taken on all bills proposed in the House. At this moment it is composed of twelve men-eight Democrats and four Republicans. A conserva- tive ~oalition of the-se four Re- publicans and twe> Southern Democmts has su~cessfully im- peded the processing of liberal proposals. As. of now the neck of Rep.resentative Wiliam M. Col- mer. of Mississippi, and second leadmg Democrat on the Com- mitte~, is on the block. He did not support President-elect Ken- nedy in the presidential campaign. Th1·ee days before this paper goes to press, it appears likely that Representative Colmer will be purged of his assiglllllent in fa- vo~ of a more liberal Democrat. This would give the liberal ele- ment the seven to five majority needed. to help pass their liberal propoaals. ~Only time will tell but at this moment it appear~ that the \great wall\ of the sen- iority system is finally beginning to crack.
