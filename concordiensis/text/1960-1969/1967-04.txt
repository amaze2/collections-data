STEERE, Convocation Speaker Botanist Discusses Arctic Life Dr. William C. Steere, director of the New York Botanical Gardens, dis- cused his experience on botanical re- search in the Artie last Tuesday when he delivered the annual Phi Beta Kappa lecture in Memorial Chapel. In his lecture, Steere discussed var- ious aspects of Arctid life and flora without going into detailed botanical descriptions. The lecture centered on descriptions of the area and t h e changmg n.odes of lifE) and have en- sued as a result of mljldern facilities built by the armed .-forces during W<Jrld War II and'after: The primary job of the Artie ¢~plorer used to be staying alive but it has now reached the point where the greatest hazard i& \eating one's own ~oolting.\ Many unusv.al problems a r e en- ctmntered as a result of the ex:teremly cold climate in some areas. Where the average temperature is below freezing the ground is frozen solid from a few feet to a thousand feet. If construction. is sta,rted upon this 'permafrost' without the proper in- sulation it' often ends up floating on a sea of mud. Steere end11d his P,iscussion with a look at the various types of animal life present irt the Artie region. Pre- sent in the region are animals rang- ing from grizzly bears, wolves, foxes, and mountain sheep ttl countless mo- sql,l'tnc-;. ·. Steere's lecture provided an inter- esting and compreli~nsive view of an area he explored at various times be- tween 1951 and 196ti when he was ass. ociated with the f\rtic Research Laboratory at Point Barorws in Alaska. Rubenstein, Amesbury Chosen ACC Delegates by RICHARD P~TTERSON, JR. Jim Rubenstein and Richard Ames- bury, both juniors, were elected to the All ~oHe_ge Council in the campus. elections Tuesday. Amesbury received 384 votes and Rubenstein received a total oi 328. The other candidates for the two seats were Gerald Grau ~68 and Richard Balagur '69. \... In one of the more disappointing turnouts of the elections, Steven Rit- terbush, with 88 votes was elected president of the class of '68. David J. Hourigan received 79 votes to cap- ture the vicepresidency. Bernard Co- hen was elected treasurer without op- IJOSition Because there was no offi- cial candidate for class secretary a special election will he held nex:t week to fill the post. Sophomore Officers Thomas Flynn was elected sopho- mQre. class pxesident with 116 votes. Wiltard- Gcu>dwin was. elected vice president with the· -same totaL · John Barber and Kenneth -·Merz;· -ru.nning unopposed, were elected secretary and treasurer, respectivelv The class of '70- elected Ross Fraser class president and Edwar.d Buzak vice president. Fraser received 120 votes and :auzak got 151t Arnold Dro- gen, candidate for secretary, and Jef- frey Knetz~r. candidate for treasurer, ran unopposed. In a po&t election interview, Jim Rubenstein explained why he ran for the ACC seat. \I ran because I think the ACC is the most important body on campus,\ he said, \because it brings together the students, faculty and administration. You can differen- tiate between a Student Council or a Tax Committee meeting where stu- de!ltS act on their own with no real notion whether their ideas will find support among the faculty and admin- istration. Tlle AC.C provides a forum for bringing questions directly before the faculty and administration.\ Involvement He cited his work on the Student Council, T~x: Committee, and publica- tions as q1,1alifications for his office. \Through my involvement,\ he said, \I think I understand student views and ani in a good position to be a good representative.\ Rubenstein proposed that the col- lege take the initiative in financially supporting campus activities. \Too much of tbe load now rests with the students, through the Tax Committee, to finance activities. He named the Ski Team, Sailing Club, Mountebanks, and the Film Society as examples of activities that should be college sup- ported. \I also think that the college should take the initiative in support· ing a different kind of weekend or social system, especiaUy for independ- ents. In general, the initiative on the campus comes from the students and not enough from the administration.\ Potential Amesbury described the ACC as \potentially str<Jng in many areas of the college,\ but pointed to a general apathy by the students toward tne student governing bodies. He felt that because the ACC and other gov- erning bodies had been ••less than dynamic,\ they stiH had to \prove themselves\ to the student body. Active in Student Council, the IFC Judicial Board, vatsity sports, and as president of his fraternity, Amesbury said he long hml been interested in college life, felt capable, and wanted to do his \part to help the college function.\. He df!fended the college's need to meet its financial obli-gations, but said that he favored allowing students with .proven financial need to live off campus if they so desire. Editor Comments Commenting · on the election of Rubenstein and Amesbury, Joseph Mann, Jr., Edit<Jr .of Concordiensis, said, \I think the candidates seriously neglected their responsibility to th~ student body by not making known their platforms and the reasons they felt qualified to run for-thiS' office.\ In reply to this -criticism, Ruben- stein stated that it was the responsi· bility of the ACC and the Student Council to make th.e views of the can- didates known. Amesbury replied that \if the :;;tudent body was really concerned, they would have demanded a platform.\ Frank McKim, Chairman of the Electi~>ns Committee, said he was pleased with the number o£ votes for the All College Council, but he point- ed out the \damn poor turnout in the junior class.\ · Saturday LSD Symposium Tripticket Set; No Leary By BARRY NEWMAN i Spocicl. from the Albany Times Union Union College prepared this week for a sober symp()sium on the merits of LSD with a knotty debate over whether to invite the high priest of tiLe hallucinQgen cult, D.;:. Timothy Leary. The Pre·Medical Society nip- ped the discussions and decided Wed· nesday not to ask for Dr. Leary's participation in the six hour session Saturday. The reason, according to the soci- ety's president and organ~er of the symposium, Earl Robinson, is that Leary's presence will be \too danger- ous.\ Robinson, a junior from Rome, N.

2 Spoonful & Project Feed Albany State On Friday, April 19, and Sun· day, April 21, the Lovin' Spoon· ful and Blues Project will ap- pear respectively at Albany State .. The Spoonful is compos- ed of John Sebastion, Zal Yan- ovsky, Steve :Boone, and Joe Butler. John plays the guitar, harmonica, and autoharp; Zal is the lead guitarist. Steve plays the electric bass. And Joe plays the drums. The Spoon~ul got their start at the Night Owl Cafe in Greenwich Village. However the job didn't last long, and they retreated t<> practice for two months and reemerged the smash they are now. Hits such as \Summer in the City,\ \Do You Believe in Magic,\ and \Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind\ have shown that the group has come into its own. The Blues Project is a hard group to categorize, for they aren't a pure rock group. They play a mixture of jazz, rhythm and blue, soul, as well as rock.

ACC To Survey Students, Residence Policy Questioned The All College Council de· cided at its !\larch. 30 meeting to conduct a random survey of Union students to determine student sentiment on the Col· lege residence P<>licy. The survey is a result of the Council's February 23rd decis- ion to review the r-esidency pol- icy of the College \with the aim of making a rep<>rt to the Board of Trustees.\ On March 30, at the Council's first meeting of the spring terrn, unanimous ap- proval was given to a survey c1uestionnairs :subject to minor improvements. It was resolved that, \In order to gain an ac- curate appraisal of student opin- ion of the residence policy, this survey has been d:tawn up and is being distributed to a group of randomly selected students,\ Drafting of the questionnaire was done by a special commit- tee, created at the ·February 23 Council meeting. Members of the drafting committee were Ed Downey and Mike Michalski. Various Opinions Wanted One hundred students ran- domly selected from the student body will receive questionnaires this week. Each of the nineteen questions contained on the ques- tion form deals with various as- pects of the residence policy. The questions call for opinions on such issues as the merits of the present resi~ence program, the abolition of the residence requirement, off-campus privi- leges for restricted students, such as juniors and seniors and e~pllnsion of the present sys- tem to improve facilities. Other questions concerned the possi- Tile PIPEMAN'S SMOME SHOP 262 Saratog~ Road MAYFAIR SHOPPING CENTER At the Sign of the Red Neon Pipe TUES. ttlru SAT.7 to 9 P.M. THURS.

Facult.Y advJ:;or A:rnold Bittleman asked J{obert Lowe. head ef the Third World, an avant-garde film group in the East Vtllage, to come and demon- strate film-making techmques. Lowe decided that instead of lectur- Ing ''in my Brooks Brothers ·suit,\ he would bnng me111bers of his \tribe'' and have a :Be-h1, a total creative experience, with the Union Workshop. What began late Saturuay night is better experienced than seen or described. It looked siLly to the unfortunate people who dropped by ~ott Memonal (the Workshop's headquarters) and laughed and left. Those who stayed the almost sleepless mght and d'ay were Impressed by the serious and meaningful occasiOn. Imaginary ,When the evening began, the Union gvoup confronted eight modishly dressed strangers. To break down reserve, Mr. Lowe pro- posed stringing beads; he assumed natural control of the 1ol10wmg events which the Third World had been planning for several weeks. Concentrating on imagery, Mr. Lowe asked everyone to rename themselves. \When you v;ere named, your parents d1d not know you. lVleditate and tell us in an image who you really are.'' Then everyone made a drawing of a tree, house, and road. Mr. Lowe asked each person to interpret h.is drawing using the road as a S,Ymbol of his path of life; the house as his soul, and the tree as his cosmos. The drawings are hung in the front hall of Nott Memorial. Third Worfd The Third World .finds that \the educational system falls down because people don't know how to tune their own instruments.\ Rather than see the subject through his eyes, Mr. Lowe taught ' students how to think and feel for themselves. Their twenty-four hour school was an event, not a \restricting inhibiting, institution.\ ln this vein, the group began chanting \Om Shanti\ (Om, the uni versal mystic syllable; Shanti, Hindu for peace).. Lowe's group be- lieves that chanting is natural and inherent. During th.e forty-five minute chorus, one Union student left because he could not stand \do.gma.\ He later return.ed .and began beating a tin wastebasket in time with finger cymbals, Indian drums, clarmet, and hand-clap· ping, Another student Q.ecscribed the chanting as an easy way to find release. All found the experience, \ecstatic.\ That's a terrible ------------~~----~-------~ 3 . ~r·~--r·· .,. ~ ~ erned bring politi- for pos- sent Fishman watches the filming of the old heating plant, di- by Prof. Meriweiher.

Claudio Canardi, a senior from Skidmore, films the imcge of tex- tures cmong the vines of Nott Memorial. Seve.ral Skidmore girls participated in the weekend. oriental dinner, eaten with. chopsticks after lessons by Masanori Oe, a Japanese Third Worlder. By dinnertime, the fil.Jn-making activities had attracted enough attention that passers-by f«>und themselves participating in ano.ther round of chanting. Then tile new movies, th~ \ru::;he.s were shown. The Workshop had trouble with light exposure, but it is perhaps fitting that one of its films-a Chaplinesque slapstick-came o.ut overexposed, jerky, and silent except for live accompaniment by · Safane on clarinet. T'he movie involves a chase by a \Kampus of a student around the library, the <!onstruction trailer near library, and the old K.A house. Other films ~n~ludecl panoramas of the campus around Nott Memorial, shots of vine~ and birds, and of other cameramen. The most successful, an arti~tic film show.ing a girl walking down a railroad track, was snot. ~brough and over a board fence. Group Image The impression that r-emains after the East Village g:roup left is similar to the image its organization has built in New· York City. A little more than a year ago, many of the p.et>ple who came last . weekend joined to renovate a buHding at 2 East Second Street and · 1 installed two working studios, a darkroom,and a r.ecording room. For $25.0() a month, an interested student can study film using 8, 16, and 35 milimeter equipment, with a crew and dev-eloping service. The instructors comprise. many backgrounds. R()bert Lowe teach· es film, with the help of his wife Esther. at C()lumbia Uni»ersity. Marvin Fishman, an ex-nevvspaperman and writer. has been with the group since its incepti()n as has everyone exceptiNg MasaMri Oe, a young Japanese sculptor and designer. Talented Artist Allen Daters, a welfare worker, i-s a very talented artist who- prefers to work alone. Mencho, the group mascot, attends every activity of the group~ Gr;w Henry, a girl who began at Skidmore College, graduated from Sarah Lawrence; she ·bas now convinced the State Board of E.dueation of the benefits of film-making for twelve year olds. She finds them most perceptive and hopes ''to make film-making as cheap as pencil and paper, and as available as music appreciation\ for y~mngsters. ) S~udents practice taking pictures of everything in sight, including pictures of each other taking pictures of each other. Third World goes be:yond the phHohophy of film-making, with religious intensity, to an iJJtense appreciation of life in general. The group has close ties with similar groups across the U.S. The united efforts of the New York groups will hold a Sweep-In on April 8th- a cleanup of the East Side, which is ignored by the city. On April 16th a Peace Be-In at the United Nations will take place to protest the war in Vietnam. An:57one interested in participating on either or both occasions mar call Third World at 212 GR-5-9745.

One of the New Yorkers said its effect was non-rational and non- logical, but not irrational or illogical. New Perspective A short meditation and some exercise in non-verbal communi- cation consisting of staring and touchir.g followed the chanting. Mr. Lowe described touch as the biggest Anglo-Saxon hangup. \Don't touch me,.\ he said, \is a common demand.\ The group then showed I' some of their films. Mr. Lowe felt his new students were sufficiently,:. acute to begin using the camera as an artistic tool. The chanting-'·' brought out, \fresh images of sight, sound, and silence. With :. cleansed minds the students can function as harmonious beings with · a new perspective.\ Third World Sunday, at dawn, fi:ming began. Twenty·four films were made, As the films came in, students developed them immediately. Short periods of leisure gave many people the chance to paint faces in v•aricus colors and designs. This provided a feeling of group unity and freedom of express;on. Third World provided a \thoughtfuL lunch\-unflavored boiled wild .rice served in a piece of cloth, \Viet- Cong style.\ Students made more t1lms that afternoon and had an - All photos courtesy of Ken B~usquet·. ·

Circulation Manager Pseudo- Elections Irresponsibility an.d unethical administration emerged as two alarming and salient features of the recent student elections. Another aspect, the failure to abide by a portion of the ACC charter, came forth &S a much less serious flaw in the procedures. The candidates who failed to- present their platforms to the entire student body before elections are patently irresponsible. When the newspaper and radio station can- not provide enough reporters to interview each candidate, it becomes the office-seeker's duty alone to make his views public. - Merely talking to petition signers and other available students does not fulfill this obligation. Letters to the editor or statements recorded on WRUC, however, cer- tainly seem to be genuine attempts to do so. The fact that only two ca.ndida.tes in this election ear- nestly attempted to reaeh the entire student population seems to indicate tha.t only these two had a fair grasp of their responsibilities, and that the-y alone took the cam- paign seriously. A problem not associated solely with this week's elec- tions-unethical administration-bas been consistently ig- nored by those who conduct the v-oting tabulations. No ser- ious election would ever :be called legitimate if candidates were allowed to count their own. votes. In the past. this. has sometimes been the case with eleetioilS at Union. The claim has been made that the Student Council, which conducts elections, cann&t find other stu-dents to count votes when its own members are involved in a cer- tain :tabulation. This position is absurd. It requires little imagination to realize that several other bodies, for ex- ample the Delphics, Gatesmen and various class officers. would be available for this task. If the Student Council :plans to conduct legitimate el- ections in the future, we hope that it will take steps to cor- rect its negligence. Finally, it was noted :;titer this week's elections that a section in the All College Coancil Charter calling for a review of prospective candidates for student seats on the ACC has been overlooked in the recent election and in the past. This section of the charter is a meaningless one which requires only that applicants for stud,ent candidacy \shall be reviewed by a student board consisting of the Student Body President, the Tax Committee Chairman, the IFC President and two seniors chosen :by the Student Body President.\ No mention is made as to whether the board can eliminate or recommend an applicant. If the section was originally included to insure that only qualified \applicants\ actually became candidates, then this screening of candidates, and the suggestion that some may be eliminated by the board, is a questionable practice. If the point was placed in the Charter merely as a vague and confusing attempt to evaluate candidates, then it has succeeded only in being an attempt. In either case, the ACC should immediately make a change in its charter. An oversight, even of this nature may convince many people that the ACC does. n.ot view itself seriously. Student Responsibility Letters. Active Leadership To the Editor: • • I would' like to present my- self as a candidate for 'Student · Council Representative of the class of ''70. This is a time of vast and significant change at Union. : What we as students do (or don't do) through our student government will determine in ~arge part the kind of college that the class of '80 finds here. I am concerned that we make . this a better college than we found it, and that our class · play an active role in bringing · this abont. If I ani elected to the Student Council, I wHl support propos- als and action which will keep Union moving forward. Specifi- cally. I support: (1) a wider, more organized social program for independ- . ents (especially on social week- ends) ( 2) a complete re-evaluation of the Camp. Ed. program with the possibility tlf making Comp. Ed, courses elective only (3) the institution of a \pass~ fail\ system of grades, in order , to remove unnecessary academic pressure from the student. (4) a Student Council which takes the initiative in both lead,. ing and responding to student opinions and demands (5) active, concerned leader- ship and representation for the Class of '70. Active in the International Relations Club, Glee Club, Dutch Classic Bowling League, and as Assistant News Editor of Con- cordiensis, I have been at the center of campus activity and opinion throughout the year. I am a political science major. My experience in student govern- ment reaches back to five years in high school student govern- ment, the last year as Student Council President. I want to put my concern and leadership ability to work for the good of our class. I seek the support of all the members of the Class of '70 in accom- plishing our goals. Thank you.

Will Arnie's Artny Prevail? The 1967 pro golf tour has already finished three months,. but when the pros • enter the dogwood forests of Augusta National Golf ClU:b for the Masters this week, golfers know that the goLfing year has really be- gun. G-o]jing fans are asking many questions a:bout the 1967 Mas- ters. Can Jack Nicklaus win an unprecedertted third straight green jacket? Can four-time winner, Arnold Palmer, win his first major title since 1964? Can 1966 Open champ, Billy Casper, further strengthen his claim to golf superstardom with his first Jlilaster,s? Can a relative un- known break the grip of golf's superstars on the Masters crown? Masters Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer have won seven of the last nine Masters' champion- ships with only Art Wall in 1959 and Gary Player in 1961, break- ing .the string. The record can be attributed to the character of the Augusta National course and the prestige of the event. Augusta, with its lush, wide fairways, provides a definite ad- vantage to the power hitters, and Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer are two of golf's longest drivers. The most important si11gle factor favoring the power hitters at Augusta is the length of the par fives. The ability of Palmer and Nicklaus to reach these holes in two shots, for easy birdies, has been an important factor in their victories. The extr-a distance that Nicklaus and Palmer gain off the tee allows well in 1966, setting an all-time PGA total money winning rec- ord with over $154,000. But in spite of the record, 1966 will go -down as the year \that Palm.er blew the Open.\ At San Fran- cisco Bill Casper came from seven shots back in the final !) holes to tie Arnie and win in ll playoff. With two victories a:JJd a first place standing on t:he money list, Palmer is off to a .good 1967 start, but he needs .a ma~or victory, like the Masters, to truly break his slump of t'he last couple of years. Thr~e-Timer Jack Nicklaus is a three-time Masters champion, winning in t963, 1965, and 1966. In 1965, Jack bFoke·the twelve\year scor- ing recotd of Ben Hogan with: a 17-umler .par total of 271 to win the Masters by a record nrne Strokes, and last year beat G~y Brewer .and Tommy Jacobs in a playoff. In 1966, in additi<>n to the Masters, Nicklaus W<lll the British Open, thus becomi:11g only the fourth golier to win the modern Grand Slam witll.in. a career. The others are Ben Hogan, Gene Sarazen, and Gary Player. Jack started quickly in 1967, winning the Crosl:JY clam- bake by five strokes,. but he b.as had driving problems of late which will have to be corrected if he is to win his third straig.ht Masters. Won Three Times his most recent win being at l)or-aU Open in early March. L<>llg-hitting Gay Brewer missed a si:x-foot putt on the 72nd green at ithe 1966 Masters which cost him the title, hut Gay finished the year fifth. on the money list and has played well in 1967, .winning at Pensecola two we~ks ago with a record 26· ·uiJder par for 72 holes. Large Number of Golfers E ecause of the large number of good golfers and the fickle- ness of golfing fortunes, it is very difficult to predict the win- ner of any one tournament. Tlle- winning golfer is usually one who drives accurately and has a \hct putter.\ There will be 83 of the world's greatest golfers at. Augusta this week but only a bandful have a chance ·tc;. win. A third-straight title br Nicklaus is unli~ely, so if you want to follow the winner your -best bet is with the Army.

However, Casper has nev· er played particularly well .at Augusta, his best finish being a fifth place tie in 1964. Casper isn't as long off the tee as Pale mer or Nicklaus, but his ability to hook the ball can pay off at .the Masters. :Bill has been ()ff th.e tour since January, due to allergy problems with sprays used on the Florida courses, where the pros played in Marcll~ His confidence is overwhelming, so he must be considered.

With the graduation of only one senior, Coach Benson has the option of relying on six lettermen. Among the return- ing lettermen are Brad Wheat- ley, last year's first singles play- er; Chris Komisajevsky, 1966 second man; and Sandy Levine. George Miller, Paul Haidak, and George Farnham. Undefeated Frosh The var.sity will also benefit from the undefeated frosh team of last year. This team was cap- ably led by Steve Karp, Jeff Kurzius, Len Duckworth, and Dave Best. Coach Benson ex- pects both Karp and Kurzius to challenge last year's top sin- gles and doubles players. Duck- worth and Best should provide needed strengthening in the lower singles and doubles posi- tions. Marty Berry, and Andy Blumenthal, both sophomores, should provide the needed depth. More Depth According to Coach Bob Ben- son, the team will have consid- erably more depth than in prev- ious years. He feels that this depth has promoted unusually fine team spirit and competi- tion. Coach Benson also said that th.e only shortcoming is the lack of a truly outstanding play- er, but that the team's depth would compensate for this. Tbe first match is on April 15, against Drew. The remaining schedule is as follows: April 22 (H) Rochester 2:00 April 25 (A) R.P.I.

Saturqay they face the alumm m a. final serimmage, before opening the regular season at Stevens on April ·15. The first home game Will be April 19 against Hobart. Allison's main problem seems to be !lack of. game experience,. espeC'ia1ly on defense. The rookie defensemen along with the rest of the squad, w1U get severe tests from each of the first two oppon- ents. Stevens is strong tnis year, as is H!Jbart, tJte ~nly. team to beat us last year. In fact, the States- men have never lost to the Garnet dur1n.g Allison s highly successful tenure. Much juagling is still possible in the starting tineup, especially a£ter performances versus the alumni, but this looks to be the way the Garnet will lineup to open versus S~evens: On att.ack, four juniors are slated to see most of the .acti!Jn. Probable s~arters are· ~ee Schmeder, Steve R1tterbus~, and Sam Dill, with Lynn Parker backing :them up. Schmeder and Rttterbush excelled on last year s 10-1 team, while Dill is in his first year of lacrosse. Ken Milne Ware Fuller and Dana ffones make up the first midfield line. The second line will probably be co'mprised of G~ry Raden, Jim Ramich, and Pete Brittin. Behind them will be Tad Knight, 1\'like Walsh, and Jim O'Neil. There will be a fourth line, made up of sophomores. The defense showing the least ex.per.ienc:e, is made up of Bob Marshall, Don DeMichele, and Larry Gillette. in the goal will be Ken Auerbach.

The contenders for the two pennants are not separated by much in the way of strengths and weak- nesses, With this in mind, here are my predictions for the Major League Baseball Se:;tson-1967: American League: 1) BALTIMORE: with continuing batting super- iority led by the Robinson boys, there is no rea- son other than ailments to their pitchers why they should not be repeaters. 2) MINNESOTA: strong as their 1965 pennant winning team; injuries hurt them last year; have a good crop of young pitchers. 3) DETROIT: Kaline and Co. are due for a good yeax; need starting pitchers. 4) CHICAGO: no threat in taking pennant; yet t~_ey 1P.'~ a _strong. club. 5) KANSAS CITY: the surprise team; have fine yollng pitchers yet no hitting. 6) CALIFORNIA: Angels lack in both pitching ancl batting; also lack in attitude. 7) CLEVELAND: will look str~ng in opening months but will fold as usual. 8) NEW YORK: a strong Mantle could not even begin to help them. 9) & 10) WASHINGTON & BOSTON: the~(;). tw~;> Clubs will have a big b.attle to see who is the worst team in the majors. National I..eague: 1) PITTSBURGH: a complete ball club; has all the essentials; got the best of the pre-season trades. 2) SAN FRANCISCO: pitchers Marichal and Perry and the hitting of Willy Mays makes them strong challengers. 3) PHILADELPHIA: a good team; maY be hurt by early spring training injuries. 4) ST. LOUIS: made gains in the off-season trad- ing; need pitching but a reasonable contender. - 5) ATLANTA: could be a strong. contender; THE HEI·GW.ING · SL!CKS FCBEE!U BlftriMEL THE they have the hitting and the pitching but they fl also have the worst manager in the majors. 6) CINCINNATi: will still feel the effects of two consecutive years of poor trades. 7) LOS ANGELES: with the retirement of Sandy went all hopes of a decent season. 8), 9), & 10) HOUSTON\ NEW YORK, & CHI· , CAGO: another scramble for obscurity. t ...... and mystic :P~ntl Grayson's predictions: Having sel'ectecl tile eventual pennant winners o sixth and ·fifth last year in a pre-season forecast, I thought I would live <>at my days quietly, apart from the baseball 'Wars.

Leary Cites Narcotic Effect of Conformity By RICHARD BALAGUR Despite the predictions of Rens- selaer County District Attorney M. Andrew Dwyer, who had attempted to bar Dr. Timothy Leary from ap- pearing at the RPI Field House last Saturday, the near capacity crowd was quiet and orderly. No demonstrations, either for or against the so-called high priest of the LSD cult, materialized. Speaking against the use of LSD was Dr. Ponald Louria, President of the New York Council on Drug Addic- tion. He cited statistics and studies to .show ·the potential dangers of the drug. Sat Cross-legged Leary, who described himself as a \spiritual prophet and part time holy man\ spoke for 45 niinutes sitting cross-legged before a burning candle in the darkened Field HQuse, mention- ing LSD only once in that time. He told the audience they must \drop out, turn ·on and then tune back in.\ Leary likened the world to a tele- vision studit;l, and called LSD a key to the news room ~ the only link with the ·~real•' world outside. Entrance int() the news room is condemned by the- \director\ (i.e. society), since th0ose w lio enter the news room do not pla.,ythe game, offenders are punished. i.sh.ed_ Sueh reactions to nonconformity are- pr-evalent throughout history Leary observed.

'I'he real narcotic in our society is conbrtnity, he stated. Comparing the r-e~'Vards of conformity to that received by. a heroin addict to \just keep that good: st-uff coming,\ Leary pretended to taJ\e the drug himself while de- scribi..ug society's benefits; \'Yoll're doing well in school, just keep it up, you'll get into a good col- leg:e, all you're in college now, oh you're grades are so good here's a Continued on Page 3 Geology Department Empties As-- Hall And Hewitt Leave .. . . . _ By ALAN KL~LN ~:boo Matthew Hall, Assistant Professor of Geology at Union has a~ounced his resignation to acce:pt a postion as assistant PrO.: fes~Or\ at the Univ~r:sity of _Massachusetts, With the previous resig- natiQn.. of Prof. Phil1p HeWitt, the geology- departmtmt here is com- pletely without professors for next year.

The proposal, put torth by jumor Michael 1\lichalski, sought to lengthen to 3 a.m. the hours in which women are allowed in men's dormitory rooms on weekends. It also contained a provision which wuuld institute new visiting hours from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays. ln presenting his proposal, Michal:- ski pomted out that tne present 1~ a.m. cunew on weett.encts was .. disad- vantageous\ to the students and \.ir- responsible\ on the part of the ad- mirustratwn. He stated that the pres- ent rule unpiles that the date .. is timshed' at 12, and at that time the student is forced to leave the ''healthy clean ;:~tmosphere\ of his room and find other places to continue his date. lVI:ichalski's attitude seemed to reflect prevailing student opinion, since a poll of some 550 students showed a vote of 70% seeking a change in the rules as they stand and approximatel:r 68% who felt that the 5 to 7 p.m. break in visiting hours should be re- moved. No Opposition At the meeting, no serious opposi- tion to the changes was posed. 0. Ed- ward Pollock, Dean of Students, com- plimented Union men on their ad- herence to the rules during the last year. He felt that students had been ·•uniformly good\ in carrying out the rules as they now stand. It was point- ed out, however, that a few Union students had voiced their interest in maintaining the 5 to7 p.m. ban on female visitors for the sake of pri· V~H\y. Hunter· Louis, Pre.:>ident of the In ter-Fraternity Council, and Dean Pol- lock decided on the desirability of bringing up the question of soci.al rule change at the next IFC meeting, since that body had not previously considered the matter this year. Dean Pollock noted that he knew of some fraternity men who might oppose such a change, but that these men were in the minority. A similar pro- posal for socjal rule change h.ad been overwhelmingly endorsed earlier by two other representative bodies, the UIC and the Student CounciL No Self-Limitation Another sign of student support for liberalizing the rules was found in the fact that no dormitory living units had voted to limit the visiting hours for their own section. Any dormittory unit may effect a restriction of social rules in their area if the majority of residents so desire. Benjamin Volinski, President of the All-College Council, stressed the fact that the council was under \no obli- gation\ to accept changes that niigbt be made in the proposal before the next meeting. He did l}Ot want to rush the matter through the ACC and pointed out that any possible changes would not be effected until, at the earliest, Spring Weekend . The question of trustee approval was brought up by one of the Coun cil members. Theodore Lockwood, Dean of the Faculty, explained, how· ever, that the trustees did not con- sider such a change to be a matter for them to act upon. He stated that this was \an administrative matter\ and that any changes within the pres- ent framework of social rules, such as the actual hours, were left entirely up to the college administration. It was decided that a final copy of the proposal should be printed up and made available to the council mem- bers before the next meeting. Presi- dent Volinskj said that the proposal would be considered again at the next meeting on April 20. At this time, the members will also examine the question of enforced on-campus hous- ing and the budget of the tax com· mittee. Sytnposiufll Pans LSD As Most Noxious Drug Dr. Malcolm Bowers, speaking to students at the LSD Symposium. By BARRY NEWMAN A panel of experts neither turned- on, tuned-in, nor dropped-out at the Union College LSD Symposium Sat- urday. Instead, the drug whose psy- chidelic potency has inspired an al- most religious following was politely put-down. \I just can't believe ~hat you need LSD to have significant social rela- tionships. I can't believe you need it to have moments of ecstasy to search for meaningfulness in life, or to try to do something about the admitted ills of our society.\ What Mrs. Helen Nowlis, Director of the Drug Education Project, does believe is that these \perfectly legi- timate needs\ can be satisfied in other ways-ways which can avoid the physical and psychological \risk\ of taking LSD. The impact of a hallucinogin like LSD upon the human system is large:. ly determined by the expectations o~ the person who uses it, and Mrs. Nowlis suggested, therefore, that an- other less harmful stimulus could produce the ·same effect if expecta- tions remained unchanged. Smokers of marijuana, as as people at cocktail parties, a \contact high\ simply from near others who act less This indicates, according to Mrs. Nowlis who is also Dean of Students at Rochester University, that alterna- tives exist not to the aims of drug users, but to the harmful chemical so far used to attain these aims. The panelists agreed that LSD, an--......' innocuous clear liquid, wa<> the most powerful, and perhaps the most po- · tentially dangerous of drugs. Trigger IJ/ness It is capable of stimulating a psy · chedelic, or mind manifesting, ex- perience, but it may also be the cause o~ \acute panic,\ or even \a drug triggered mental illness,\ a psychia- trist from the Yale Vniversity Schoo~ · of Medicine, Dr. Malcolm Bowers < maintained. · A representative· from the Federal Bureau of Dmg Abuse Control ·said there is \strong evidence\ of \some sort of organization moving into the sale of LSD.\ \LSD traffic is approaching com· ... petition with heroine,\ according to Larry Kerness, and is \being smug. gled into the United States from abroad.\ Demand To Be Happy Mrs. Nowlis insisted tl)at LSD would not be needed \if the youth of today would be ingenious and ere- , ative and demand to be happy without feeling guilty.\ The panel appeared before an au- dience of 200 in Union\s staid Me- morial Chapel at a symposium that chose to do . without Dr. Timothy Leary, the most publicized LSD advo- cate. Leary would have found little com- fort for his admiration of LSD, but his .recent support for communal liv- ing .to enhance human relaionships would have been welcomed. . - ' date is an uri]41own quantity,\ but he was quick to add, \Certainly we'll provide for the geology majors next year .. \ He was hesitant to speculate wheth- er the provision would be at Union or at another school in the area. He stated emP1Il1tically that both he and Profs. Hewitt and Hall are doing everything possible to stalf t11e de· partment.

A boy will use LSD after losing his girl friend, when a parent dies, or when the prospects are dim for mak- ing grade· in school. \These are things that can throw the life of a late adolescent into turmoil,\ Dr. Bowers said.

Ferguson cites three reasons for this problem: although WRUC will realize greater na- tional sales in the future by switching to the Ivy Network, $3000 worth of business could not be contracted because of legal entaglements; approxima- tely $2,000 expected to be de- rived from Saratoga, but for un- forseen difficulties, beyond the radio station's control, have prevented the soliciting of ad- vertisements in that area; and lastly, the General Electric stnke cost $30 million to Sche- nectady, and an indeterminate amount in ad1•ertising budgets were closed off by downtown merchants. Unavoidable Concordy's and WRUC's f)rob- lems seem to be mostly unavoid· able. But this does not alter the fact that the Tax Committee is faced with the problem of making up those deficits. Only e:xtremely profitable weekends appear to be able to prevent the Tax Committee from going into the red this year. Besides these individual prob- lems, Martin Pinson, chairman of the Tax Committee, feels there is a dual problem. This f1rst concerns the Tax Commit- tee, which must take care of so many organizations, and second- ly each individual organization that is not able to work within its own budget. He adds that since President Martin has come to Union, activities have blos- somed, but that the system of the Tax Committee has not ex- panded to meet these new needs. He suggests that certain activities should be run by the college as opposed to the Tax Committee. Pinson is also work- ing on a plan to revise the current Tax Committee system. Tran Van Dinh, Vietnamese .author and former Ambassador to the United States will speak en the topic, \A Vietnamese Looks at the War\ on Friday .April 14, at 4:30 in SS16. The tailt is sponsored by the Inter- mtional Relations Club and carries convocation credit. Active in Underground Tran Van Dinh was educated at Hanoi University and was active in the nationalist under- ground movement against the .French and the Japanese be· tween 1942 and 1945. He was chief of staff of the Lao-Viet liberation army between 1945 and 1948, and in 1951 joined the Vietnamese foreign service. From 1952-56 Dinh served at the Vietnamese embassy in Bangkok Between 1957 and 1963 he served in many p()si- tions including Vietnamese ob- server at the United Nations and at the Seato meetings before becoming acting ambassador to the United States in September, 1963. After the overthrow of Ngo Dinh Diem in November. 1963, he was transferred to the Vietnamese consulate in India where he served until he re- signed from the foreign service in 1964. In Washington Since resigning, Tran Van Dinh has lived in Washington, IJ. C., working as a co:umnist and a free lance VI-Titer. He has JJUblished a book on Vietnam- Nll Passenger on the River and l1as lectured in over 100 univer- sities and colleges in the United States. In addition to his convocation speech, Tran Van Dinh will be :meeting informally with stu- dents in Hale House on Friday 8t 2:30 and will speak at the Unitarian ·Church on Wendall .Avenue at 8:00. If a quorum of students ( 1 4 of Student Body i is present, a voice vote will be taken on the proposition and the results of it will be final. If a quorum is not presPnt, those students who are absent will ha\'e their votes register('d as YES and counted along with the Yotes of those' students· present. Thus, if a quorum is not present, the re- sult of the latter voting method will be final.

Acting- Ft>atures Editor '69 ................... -......... -_ ... _ ................ -........ Sports Editor Free Speech? Last week the administration voiced its disapproval of the proposed appearance of Timothy Leary on campus. This attitude was motivated by at least three considera- tions: first, Leary's appearance would disrupt the plan of the symposium, particularly since the panelists did not ex- pect him ; second, his opinions on LSD were purely emo- tional ones and any presentation of them here would be inconsistent with the symposium's. purpose and would not reveal any of his philosophy which was not already pub- lished; and third, his record seems to indicate that he is a sensational scientist of the type we should avoid. The administration's concern for the panelists was a valid and necessary cons.ideration. It was valid, however, only if Leary were invited to take part in the actual sym- posium; this was not necessarily the case si~ce it was more desirable that he speak apart from the panehsts. The other arguments appear specious, and even worse, suggest that the college may attempt to qualify \free speech\ whenever a controversial figure of this nature threatens to appear on campus. Leary's visit to Union would have offered stu- dents, \vithout a doubt, a valuable educational experience. This experience would have provided a basis from which students could judge for themselves whether Leary's views are emotional or not. The fa.ct that he might have said no more than he has already wl'itten should not have prevented his appearance before Union students. Many students, who have varying degrees of familiarity with Leary's views, desired to see him. To say that all of these students were simply looking for a sen.•:;ational character is an unfair generalization. Probably, some of them were. But is this a sufficient cause to deny· many more the opportunity for a beneficial exper- ience? Onf' of the most precious qualities of a college is that it supposedly provides an environment where new, different and sometimes \unacceptable\ ideas are exposed and evalu- ated. This quality is one which does not always oftenexist outside the intellectual community. Union College bears the responsibility of fostering this type of atmosphere. By ignoring the wishes and needs of a great number of stu- dents because of the questionable nature of a speaker, the college fails to fulfill the aforementioned duty and limits the experience-and ultimately the wisdom-of those it attempts to educate. Off Li'Ving The college housing policy is presently under study by members of the All-College Council. The policy, as it will apply next year, is blatantly unfair and does not provide a healthy atmosphere for learning and development. The administration's concept of a purely residential community assumes that all students will benefit, if not grow to love, the fraternity or dormitory environment. No matter how comfortable the new dormitories may be, this is simply not true. One cannot impose uniform living re- quirements upon 1300 changing, maturing, somewhat ill- verse individuals and naively expect that the overwhelm- ing majority will conform, adjust and profit from the ex- perience. The social rules have been a great step toward a \return to normalcy\ but they cannot provide the differ- ent atmosphere which many students require in order to live comfortably and study efficiently. The strict residential campus program which Union will begin to enforce next fall is unbefitting the institution. This policy restricts the students and dictates a way of living to them. The sense of community which the adminis- tration seeks certainly will not be engendered by for.cing the community members to live together. Granted, the ''dormitory experience\ may be valuable to many students throughout their undergraduate years. And surely it bene- tits the underclassmen. But it is unrealistic to deny that many upperclassmen come to realize that the dormitory or fraternity situation is unrewarding or perhaps repulsive to them; these people can function better in an off-campus environment and should not be denied the opportunity to do so. Finances obviously play an important role in determin- ing the housing policy. But in all fairness, why should students be at the mercy of an ever increasing student body and irregular changes in housing policy which allow off-campus living one year and demand that students re- turn the next? If the alternatives must be either a reason• able loss in revenue for the college or a decrease in educa- tional benefits to certain students, then the students must receive the consideration. Letters To The Editor Humiliating To The Editor: Is it merely constant conjunc- tion of events, or could there be a necessary connection be· tween the student body's desire to retain Mr. Foster and the administration's recent decision to change its mind and keep him. I'm very skeptical of the fact that the administration de- cided to listen to the Voice of the Student. The interesting phantasy which we seem to have been sold is that students can actually accomplish innovations regardless of administrative sanction. It reminds me of the young infant who sits in the front seat of the family automo- bile in his little car seat with the tiny plastic steering wheel and the red squeeze horn and actually believes that he is de- termining which direction the automobile is going. Scott Siegler '69 will find three similar, gory stories. And so the facts are preva· lent. Apparently those mem· bers of Psi U who threw eggs do not read the newspapers. I do not read them often either; the news has nothing new on Vietnam. Sincerely yours, Steve Draper Exhibition To The Editor: I was not surprised by the demonstration in front of the Nott Memorial, but, rather, by the absence of the American flag and reverend pictures of Washington and Lincoln.

As long as there was all individual thought.

The college administration tending to Dr. Leary Union's in· vitation, but he decided against this. Perhaps he thought that Leary would not contribute b the symposium or maybe he didn't agree with his viewpoint. Another explanation might be the fact that this president did not want to incur the wrath of the administration and there- fore hamper his chances for ad· mittance to medical schoo next year. This same fear of indirect college pressure was prevalent when it came to the signing of the petition for off-campus resi· dence for whomever desired it. Although many students agreed in principle with the .proposals of the petition, they would not give the full support of their .signature lest the college in· tervene unfavorably on their graduate school chances. This is unfortunate because it does no credit to the liberal tra- dition which the college pro· fesses to uphold, to the stu· dents, and to the college. Of course, one might argue that one's convictions should trans- cend any threat of punishment. And ideally this is true. But the realites of the 1960's and mod- ern American demand that graduate school is of the ut- most importance. And to some extent I can sympathize with anyone who protects his own in· terests first. I don't know whether the threat that I have been talking about is an illusion put by the college to protect its own inter- ests or has no truth whatsoever. Neverthless, this does not mat· ter. As long as Union's students preceive the existing state of affairs to be as they are, many are afraid to say what theY think. The college .should make an effort to clear up this sit· uation and to encourage more individualism in Union's stu- dents.

The Garnet are shooting for their third straight winning season, be- ing 15-2 in 1965 when they won the NCAA small col- lege Atlantic division title, and 7-5 last season. Heading the list of returnees is three year starter senior Greg Olson. Olson played centerfield on the 15-2 squad and was at first base last year. He will be at first again this season and will supply the team with solid lefthanded hitting. Joining Olson in the infield will be senior Bob McAdams at second and junior Dave Houri· gan at shortstop. McAdams was a .300 hitter last year while Hour- igan is a fine glove man and a long-ball hitter. Junior Don Duncan and sophomore Tom 1\iiller are bat- tling for the third base spot, left vacant by the graduation of last year's captain, Larry Mc- Donald. Leading Hitter Senior Bill Toth, last sea- son's leading hitter will be in left field but the rest of the outfield will be largely inex- perienced. Sophomore Mike Solomon has the inside track for the centerfield position while junior Ken Merchant and sophomore Bob Stankewicz are battling for the right field spot. Pitching will be a major prob- lem for the Dutchmen.

An import- ant factor in the season will be the ability of the sophomores to deliver at the bat. Hallenback will not be able to carry the pitching load alone so one of the remaining four must suc- cessfully move into a starting role if the Garnet are to have a winning season.

'BOUND IS BACK! For the third consecutive year, Union . College has been granted two full course scholarships to tne summer OUTWARD BOUND SCHOOLS (OBS) in the United States. The Outward Bound pro- gram is a unique experience, and is a challenge for young men with enough fortitude to confront new surroundings, elements of nature, deprivation, and, ultimately, themselves. This month Union College will select two students for the month-long courses at five locations in the United States. The Outward Bound concept began in Aberdovey, Wales, in re- sponse to the apparent submissiveness of young English sailors I whose ships had gone down at sea during WWII. The purpose of Outward Bound is best explained by the founder, Dr. Kurt Hahn: . \The purpose of Outward Bound is to protect youth against a declining civilization: the decline of physical fitness due to modern methods of locomotion, the decline of skill and care due to weakened tradition of craftsmanship 1 ~the decline of initiative due to spectatoritis, the decline of seu-discipline due to tran- quilizers, and the decline of compassion, which William Temple called 'spiritual death'.\ The profound success of the rustic pilot school led to widespread adoption of OBS in England and, eventually, in the U. S. Each school in the U. S. has an emphasis in the vehicle presenting chal- lenge to the individual: 1. Colorado OBS - Mountaineering and Survival 3. Hurricane Island (Me.) - Seamanship & Navigation 8. Minnesota OBS - Canoeing and Wilderness 4. Northwest (Ore.) OBS ~Mountaineering and Wilderness 5. North Carolina OBS - Mountain Rescue and Fire Control Further detailed information is available at the Student Activi- ties Office for your perusal. Anyone definitely interested who has summer time available and minimum physical requirements is en- couraged to write: (Union-OBS, cjo Dean Pollock, Dean of Students Office) expressing his interest and what he might expect from the experience.

The home opener is scheduled for Wednesday, against Hobart, the only team to defeato I <• the Garnet last year.

The second half featured a<:> more balanced eontest, as the Alumni managed to break through for three scores, while the varsity added eight more. Attack Strong Point 0 The team lost many top performers from last year's 10-1 team, , the Kelso Morrill Division champions who ranked number seven- teen in the nation. Inexperience is evident especially on defense, ! but the attack looks to be the strong point. Lack of any real compe 11 : tition could hurt the Garnet going into the opener with Stevens, as ' it will be the fifth contest of the season for the hosts.

US (Union-Skidmore), a group cre- t ated Thursday at a meeting of stu- dent government officials and news- paper editors, is readying a campaign to draw the two colleges, 22 miles apart, into closer cooperation. Aside from the geographic barrier, the students recognize that a number of factors will prevent full consoli- datnon in the foreseeable future. .,, Skidmore, for example, is building a $5 million campus near Saratoga Springs, and wil certainly not aban- don it for a move to Schenectady. Separate Graci School Nevertheless, the group does en- i vision using one campus as a coed graduate school someday, reserving the other for a coed undergraduate college. ,,, Exploratory talks are now under- way among administrators at the col- leges, according to Union's president Harold C. Martin, to discover means for integrating some activities. Possible areas of cooperation, Mar- tin said, include joint appointments, centralizec;Plibrary and computer serv- ices, and specialized courses for stu- ,\< dents at both schools. Mote Natural . ., From the student's point of view, · increased cooperation does not bring to mind computers, libraries and fac- ulty. For sprue, it would signify a wel- come respite from the isolated life sometimes associated with all-men's or all-women's colleges. of vice-president of the student body was formally established by a re- sounding maJority vote. Vtllinski then introduced the candidates for student body president, Ray Pike and Robert Winner. Both addressed the overflow crowd. Pike began by commenting that the stlldent council had just finished \an- other year.\ He said the council had not \done anything astounding, and I doubt if it ever will.\ He went on to criticize the various activities on cam- pus who have exceeded their budgets, and proposed that the Council super- vise such activities to see that they manage their funds more carefully. Revolution Referring to the social rules revolu· tion, Pike said he hopes the All Col- lege Council will pass the new liber- alizations, and he \looks forward to the eventual elimination of all social rules. The residential policy of the college seems to be to force students to live on campus. If that's the case, we'll have to take it and make it as good as possible,\ he said. The student body president, Pike noted, should act as a liaison between the student body and the faculty and administration, often in a moderating position, but always as a strong repre. sentative of student opinion. He cited his qualifications as his service as Freshman class presi- dent ('67), student council member, and Student Body President for a short time in 1965. Robert Winner prefaced his re- marks by promising to \give it to you straight. The need of the student gov- ernment as it stands now is urgent. It is not do or die; just do or dis- appear.\ He said that the student council \must act on the principle of respect between the various bodies on campus.\ This respect, he said, has broken down, and has to be re- built if the student council is to retain any significance on campus. Potentially Interested To effect this rebuilding, Winner called for the student council to \deal more directly with the student body\ than previously, and to be \more op- en.\ He also promised that, if elected, he would bring into the student gov· ernment \inactive but potentially in- terested people\ on campus. His major proposal was for the es- tablshment of an A.C.C. Joint Student· Faculty committee to \investigate the possibility of eliminating the grading system in whole or in part.\ He ob- served that the A.A.C. has \little-di- rection,\ and \is craving for dynamic leadership,\ but \has amazing poten- tial.\ Winner emphasized his contin- uing support for more liberal social rules, and their eventual elimination 1 \at least on weekends.\ He also calleu for more support for the artistic and cultural groups on campus. RAY PIKE ROBERT WINNER Sherry Hour The entire college community has been invited to a sherry hour tomorrow afternoon at 4:30 in Hale House Student Lounge. Financed by a grant from Dean Theodore Lockwood's office, the event has received \wide-spread support from students and faculty\ according to Robert Stolzberg, the program's co-ordinator. \Many people have recognized the need for greater contact among the vari- ous facets of the community,\ Stolzberg said. \If there is a good turn-out for this, it should go far to fulfill one of the basic premises of the small college-that there is more to the learning process than the passive reception of facts, that it must involve personal relation- ships.\ In addition to sherry, coffee and cookies will be served. By HAL ROSS selves. He noted that although all but \I challenge any student to come up with a better answer to the hous- ing problem.\ TlJ.ese were the words used by Student Body President Ben- jamin Volinski as he presented to the Concordiensis two comprehensive plans, residential housing and unlim- ited off-campus living, to S<Jlve the housing problem. Volinski's proposals, based upon a poll distributed to students selected at random thro11ghout the college, represent the two directions whicll. the college might take in the futuxe. The first, based upon the theory of the total residential college defines a series of conditions to make life in the residence halls more than \just bearable.\ These conditions are: con- tinuing liberalization of social rules, priority given t() the building of a Student Union, the institution of a House system of living for independ- ents, the renovation of North College in three sections lilce Bronner hou.se to further the €Stablishment of a House system, sandwich and ice cream vending machines in all residence halls, telephone eonnection outlets in all rooms in all r€sidence halls, elim- ination of rules limiting the size of refrigerators, a center for seniors to write their theses, encouragement of faculty socialization with students lly increased faculty :presence on campus. Alternative Volinski's second proposal is an alternative which he deems necessary should the school find it not possible to \go all the way\ in outfitting tlJ.e residence halls. This alternative C()ll· sists of two parts. The first would allow all Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors to live off campus if they so desire. The second. if complete free· dom for off campus living is not eco· nomically feasibl'C for the college, would allow all seniors to live off campus regardless of cost to the col- lege. These proposals represent the ex- pressed desires of those students who chose to answer ihe poll which was distributed by the All College Cou.n· cil last week. Th.ere were 100 copies of the questionnaire distributed, and 55 were eventually returned, with re- plies ranging in feeling from extreme sarcasm to deep sincerity. Evaluating the poll, Volinski found that the pnmary reason for desiring to live off camptls was that of social freedom. Most students were pro- foundly concerned with the concepts of individual freedom and maturity. Volinski Annoyed Although the h~using poll was con- sidered successftll as an indicator of student opinion, Volinsld expressed some annoyance at the fact that 45% of those who were asked to answel.\ the poll chose n()t to express them- six were dissatisfied with the present housir.,g policy, there was no consist- ent solution to the problem found throughout the questionnaires re- turned. Volinski has called for students to comment on his proposals. However, he said that the time for complaints has passed, and unless definitive pro· posals better than his own are sub- mitted, he will press for administra· tion approval of either of the plans called for by the analysis of the ACC poll. Button Criticizes Vietnam Bombing, Credibility Chasm By NEAL GORDON In an exclusve interview with Con- cordiensis Daniel Button, Republican Congressman from the tri-cities area, had much to say concerning national politics. He felt that the bombing in Vietnam should be stopped immedi· ately. Despite his opinion and the possibilities of a temporary truce on Buddha's birthday, May 23, he felt that a bombing-halt is unlike in the immediate future. A major complaint that he held concerning the administration's policy in Vietnam was President Johnson's lack of candor. There is a \great difficulty in finding out the truth\ he said. It is difficult to acctlrately crit· icize the methods of Johnson when there is such difficulty in finding out \what the policy is,\ and when \pub- lic discussions are equated with trea- ~on., Discusses Powell Button felt that the administration was \condoning deliberate attempts to mislead and falsify\ policy actions. To disc.)urage discusion of issues of the war is unfair to the American public's desire \to know on what basis to act.\ He felt that, \if the war effort deserves support then all attempts should be made to inform the public.\ Button was pessimisitic about Adam Clayton Powell's chances of being re- seated, despite Powell's overwhelm- ing victory in Harlem. He was dis- satisfied with the wording of the Rouse resolution refusing to seat Powell in the 90th Congress. He sup- JlOrted the ethics committee recom- mendations that Powell be fined forty- thousand dollars, be censured, but still be allowed to keep his seat, with loss of seniority.

Qver a mile of damp city streets overcast with smog and clouds of threatening rain the procession made its way. There were Quakers, there were Communists, marching, stopping at intervals to allow cross traffic to pass, singing and chanting peacefully. Veteran's groups led the march, followed by doctors, lawyers, an aca- demic profession, Negroes, pacifists, students, and a small number of hip- pies and \teeney hoppers.\ In their vast diversity the marchers held some things in common.

It also pointed to the \greatly increased educational level and degree of interest\ of these citi- zens, and asked the Con- stitutional Convention to give \the most serious, complete and sympathetic consideration\ to the lower voting age.

He would not speculate at this time on the chances of a Repub- lican Presidential victory in '68, only saying that all depends on the candidate and his platform. He is strongly opposed to the present draft system. When he spoke at R.P.I. two weeks ago he criticized the inadequately explored possibilities for a com- pletely voluntary system.

Bus Service US will also negotiate for reg- ularized bus service between the two schools similar to an ar- rangement between Amherst and Smith colleges. ':rhe group is preparing to circulate a com- mon weekly calendar, with the financial support. of the Skid- more chapter of the National Student Association. In the academic sphere, stu- dents hope to take advantage of strong departments at one school which may not exist at their own. In addition, by draw- ing from a combined student- body, professors are likely to find sufficient interest in spe- cialized areas, such as journal- ism, to teach otherwise unsched- uled courses. Co-ed RPI RPI and Russell Sage Col- leges whose social link parallels that of Union and Skidmore, have no official relationship along these lines. Few students take advantage of the opportun- ity to attend class at the other school. RPI, however, is developing a coed contingent of its own. Presently, 97 full time women students are working toward undergraduate or graduate de- grees, and living in their own wing of a college dormitory. HELP! Concordiensis can not meet its distribution requirements with its present staff.

WR UC-FM To Blast Over Tri-Cities A rea WR.UC Radio, Uni<>n's largest student activity, will expand into F.M., Within the next year. Bob Killian, Vice President of WRUC in charge of F.M. development announced recently. \'Ye've been W!>rk:ing hard during the past twelve months re· se.ar.chmg the techmcal and programming aspects of such a mo.ve,\ Ktllian told Concordiensis recently. \We are convinced that the Union Community can support such an activity and feel certain that Tri-Cities' reception ~f a fine arts F.M. station will prove gratifying.'' Th~ Board of Trustees approved the F.M. plan in essence late last sprmg. At that time, the Union Trustees insisted that .the cam- pus radio station incorporate itself as a separate corporation com- pletely owned by the college. This would remove the college's lia- bility, since any suit would be directed at the Union broadcasting group, an entity which owns nothing but its equipment. Investigating Committee Organized 3 S'kid:more And Albany Grant Liberal ·H~ours Curfews requiring Albany State University <!o-eds to be in their dormitories after specified llours have been abolished. Beginning Wednesday, April 19, women students, with the exception of freshmen, will be free to enter and leave their quarters at will, as long as they tell the college where they in- tend to go. At Skidmore College in Sara- toga Springs, senior-s have won elct.ensions of daily and weekend curfews, and students are hop- ing for eventual relaxation across all class levels. Skidmore Rules Skidmore weekday limit for remaining away from the dor- mitor:Y vvas raised to 12:30 p.m. for SEniors, and to 11:30 p.m. for all other women. Seniors may mw return as late as 2 a.m. P.riday and Saturday nights, while a 1 a.m. curb is retained for undenclassmen. Students at Russell Sage Col- lege are also asking for liber- aiizati()ns. A proposal to stretch the current weekday curfew of 11 p.m for seniors and 10 p.m. for the rest of the all women's school is under consid-eration by the Common Council,. a student-faculty group. At a ~umber of women's col· leges, including Bennington in Verrn0ont, curfews are minimal and m.en are permitted in the womea~s rooms. •I \o: \V:hen they reached the U.N. the :marchers heard the songs of Peter, Paul and Mary, and Dr. King proclaim in his Nobel ·:;Prize winning voice, the causes of Civil Rights and Peace were now <>ne.

Besides Killian, student members of the committee include Richard Ferguson, Dick Reingold, Tom Seem, Roger Miller 1 • ~ob :Douglas, Gary Abramson, Joe Mann, Marc Reubens, and Cliltord Safane.

As planned, the new F.M. station would broadcast through the atmosphere to the entire Schenectady-Troy-Albany area. The basic format of fine art, classical, jazz and folk music would be incorpor- ated in a format that would also include dramatic presentations, specially prepared lectures, rebroadcasts of some Union convoca- tions, and telephone discussion and interview shows. :·Foster To Return, \It is our hope,\ noted Vice-President Killian, \that WRUC·F.M. will serve a two fold pur-pose. Basically, it is designed to serve t:llose students who are not able to take advantage of WRUC-A.M. because they do not enjoy the contemporary music that is featured on Uni()n- Skidmore radio. We hope that the new station will pmvide a new avenue of faculty-student communication, since we intend to call on the talents of the entire Union community, professors and students alike. We also expect that the F.IVI. station will give Edu- cated people in the Tri-Cities a new awareness and appreciation of Union.\ Two Programs Pursues Doctorate There are two basic problems facing the planners of the new station. One js locating a frequency, and the other is financing for the fifty-thousand dollar OIJeration. By BILL BREIMAN Next year, Michael J. Foster, instructor in the Department of The new ~tation might be on the air by October or Novernbe:r of this year. ~·Philosophy, will be teaching at Union on a part-time basis. This Richard Reingold, newly elected President of the Union Ervad· arrangement, which Dean Lockwood, Dean of the Facultv, called. \a casting Group, summed u:p the planners' feelings when he noted, \ \all the Ivy League schools have free atmosphere stations. We're happy solution,\ is intended to allow Foster sufficient time to finish proud of WRUC-A.M. It is a highly successful student activity, and work on his doctoral degree. a much respected radio station among other campus and commer-cial . . , facilities. We are convinced that now is the right time to make this Last December, 1t was rumored that Foster s two-year contract move, in order to assure WRUC's continued service to the Union would. not be renewed. At the time, there was some stude:nt C()ncern Community.'' over the issue. Several letters published in Concordiensis, ex- \ pressed disappmval of the ad' ministration's action. R.eeent revelations show that many who protested were uni_n· forrned. Foster was never diS· missed, as many had claimed. Many students -were not aware that since early January, as Fos- Viet Envoy Calls Stand Absurd • ter .himself stated, \there was a good :possibility that I would be back\ Some may not have kno-wn the reasons the admin- . istraticn allowed Foster's con- tr-act to lapse. Tllere was 110 overt interest ever expressed by the Admil!-is· ' tration\' in deliberately keepmg the Department of Philosophy small and unimportant. Dean Martin Litcherman expressed \a \' hope\ that Union will have mor~ than a three-man depart- ment; ·by Septem.ber, 1968. Fos- ter's 'cmntract o:riginally failed ._ to be renewed, :not because the adlllinistration bad some per- sonal objection to Mr. Foster, but rather because Foster was not devoting ·sufficient time to 4 his doctoral work It has been the general policy of the college not to grant ten· , ure io professors who have not obtained their Ph.D.'s. Foster is working on nis doctoral de· gree at Princeton. Due to the small size of the pllilosophy de- t part:rnent here, he has been given a rather heavy and ardu- ouT <!Ollrse load; Opponents o:f the United States involvement in So11th Vietnam received tbe firm sup- port of Tran an Dinh, .former Ambassador to the United States from South Vietnam, speaking at Union Friday, April 14 . Tran called our position in South Vietnam \absurd.\ \'We say we fight there \to contain the Chinese, yet we kill the very people who kno-w how to control them. We ar-e fighting the wrong enemy.

Contrariness · fer, however, my sincere effGrts in that all matters Gf student interest wm be fully investigat· ed by the student leaders on campus. The ·oiTicc of Student Body President should be the source of dynamic initiative. I feel that I have the interest and the ability to give the stud- ent body good, solid leadership. As Freshman Class President (Class of '67), I conducted ~me of the biggest money-makmg Winter Weekeads on this cam- pus. We instituted the Sunday Brunch that year, which is now Saga policy. I served the Coun- cil actively my sophomore year and was elected Student Body President in the spring of '65. Unable to serve l1JY full term because of academic shortcom- ings, I attended other schools and served in the Coast Guard Reserves. Returning to Union as a sophomore in January, I have seen new potential in stud- ent affairs in the revised All College Council. When I was on the All College Council of '63-'64 it had no legislative pow- ers. I see this body now as being abl'e to deal with student affairs responsibly and authori- tatively. The Inter-Fraternity Council's actions last Tuesday have brought that body to the nadk of its career. It is, perbaps, fitting that a group which has done little in the past should face an important issue with its gaze firmly fi:xed in the wrong direction. The Council, representing an overemphasized, unfair, divisive, burdensome, superannuated, bigoted and diseased systeom of social societies on campus, has chosen to oppose the proposals of the Student Council and the Union Inter- residency Council and to substitute its own suggestions for cba.nge in the social rules. These suggestions seem to be aimed at preventing pr.o-btems within the fraternities on party weekends. They li:mit the freedom ·Of independent students severely and, if put into effect, will give fraternity social life the usual UJ>per hand. They are opposed to the desires of the ma- jority of Union students and should apply only to fraterni- ties, the very group that needs them most. If the Council means to assign these restrictions to fraternities only, then their intentions are good. If they mean to place them on the entire student body, then their a.itn is a questionable and undesirable one. The social regulations put into effect last year were a l>oon. to the student body. However, the regulations were m()re meaningful to the ind€pendents at Union than they we:re to the fraternity m<m. Previously, the independents had enjoyed no opportunities to entertain dates in their dormitories; fraternity men had many opportuntties for entertaining. The extension which students are seeking tbi~ year would give the independents social hours similar to those enjoyed by fraternities many times in the past. The proposal put forth by the lFC intimates strongly that that body fears the effects of liberal social rules on the popularity of fraternities. If students can experience healthy social conditions in their dormitories, then the glit- tering allure of fraternities may lose some of its gilt. I wish there were space here to go into detail in all of these matters, but I do feel that the All College Council through the UIC, the IFC, and the Student Council shouid deal with the following issues: The social rules should come up for liberaliza- tion as soon, as much, and as often as necessary. The resi- dence program must be evalu- ated with changing social rules in mind. The foreign student deserves better attention than he gets. Now is the time to set up an International House. The judicial system offers room for improvement. And then there are questions as to the future of Union as an academic institution. Do we want women? Set up a good grad school? Throw out class ranking? In- stitute the pass-fail system? The Student Council has been criticized of doing very little year after year in the past, and it will probably be criticiz- ed again next year. Criticism is good, but I would like to see The PIPEMAN'S SMOKE SHOP 262 Saratoga Road MAYFAIR SHOPPING CENTER AI the Sign of the Red Neon Pipe TUES. ihru SAT.7 to 9 P.M.

I intend to see that each member contributes the dyna- mLc participation he professed in the elections. Student Government can be responsible and responsive. r WC>Uld like the opportunity to see that it is. If you vote on 1\fonday, the 2 1 Hh, the chances are it will be.

This Campus has often been accused of being apathetic, and that the responsibility for this rests with the Student Body. This accusation is only partially true. The Student Council is also responsible since they rare- ly inform their constituents of what has occurred in the meet- ings; nor does the Council ac- tively seek the participation of the Student Body in Campus af- fairs.

Saturday the stickmen had traveled to Stevens and overwhelmed the Engineers, 11-4. Hobart continued its dominance over the Dutch- men, as Coach Bruce Allison has yet to de1eat the Statesmen. Last year they were the only team to dereat our outstandmg 10-1 squad. The Garnet fell .behind 2-0 eany m the tirst penod, as they looKed sluggish on the muddy 1ie1d. How· ever Steve Ritter oush broke through for an un- assisted goal late m the penod to cwse the gap. Finally beginning to jell and check solidly all over the field, the hosts scored twice in the second period to go ahead 3-2. Lee ::lchneider scored to tle it up, and R1tterbush added the Go-ahead goal, assisted by Schneider. Even Score ln the third period, the Statesmen scored once more to e\·en the score at 3-J, and set the stage for the wild and controversial final stanza. Halfway through the period Ritterbush scored again to put the JJutchmen ahead, 4-3. However, the goal was dtsauowed because the Garnet had one extra man on the field. This was brought to the attention of one oflic1al by the entire Hobart team. Despite not havmg realized the infraction earlier-, the official contended that he had noticed that Union was at full strength, but was not aware that they should have been m a one-man-down situation. If this truly was the case, the disal- lowance of the goal was correct. However the officials were unsure, and not in complete con· trol of the game throughout. Hobart then scored with less than two minutes to play to narrowly edge the Garnet, 4-3. Out· standing for the VIsitors was Mark Hanna, who scored t<.vo goals. He was also star quarterback for the Hobart footballers. Break to 4-0 Lead Saturday the stickmen broke to a 4-0 first quarter lead and soundly defeated Stevens, 11-4. Lee Schneider· and Steve Ritterbush led the scor· ing with three goals apiece. bam Dill and Ken l\Iilne added two apiece. Ware Fuller also tallied once for the Garnet. Coach Allison called it a good team e:ort and commended especially Sam Dill and Larry Gillette. ~ext opponents are Hamilton and Alfred, both away, on Saturday and Wednesday. Frosh Win At attack for the frosh were Frank Donnini, Bob Lange, and Pete Garrison. Midfielders, all of whom saw almost equal action, were Paul Wat- erfield, Ron Wall, Jim Sabella, Dick Swan, Steve Ciesinski, and Steve Bauer. The defense was made up of Kevin Monahan, Tom Godfrey, and Bill Dwyer. In the crease was Paul Buff. Garrison scored four times for the yearlings against Stevens and Sabella added two markers. Swan, Wall, and Hull had one goal apiece in the victorious de'but. Sports Shorts The Union tennis team, 0-9 last season, scored an impressive 5-0 Victory over Drew University in the Garnet's 1967 debut. The match was plagues by intermittent showers which eventually caused the three doubtes matches to be cancelled and left one slllgles match mcomplete.

With strong support from Bob Gill and Bill Pattison the team placed second overall, losing to Cor~ nell. In the first couple of heats, Union was at a disadvantage due to the fact that the boats and the course at Lake Cayuga were totally unfamiliar to our sailors. However, in the second half of the day Union swept by the second place Colgate team and narrowly missed beating Cornell due to a disqualification of a Union crew in the fifth heat.

The in· creased complexity and the con· troversial nature of tbis man's From our experience and con· tact with Bob Winner, we are fully aware of his qualifications to fulfill the present demands of the job and his unique creative ability to cope with the demands of the future. We have observed Bob as a member of the Student Council for the past two years. His continual effort and willing- ness to perform tasks to their greatest extent are obvious from his record alone. In all his par- ticipation Bob has always repre- sented the most perceptive view· point of future events in student government. Above all else, Bob has the desire and capability to project the Student Council and the All College Council into the leadership positions they need and deserve. For the above reasons we ac- tively support the candidacy of Robert Winner for Student Body President. Sincerely, Robert (Doc) Benjamin President, Class of '67 Morgan (Skip) Eames President, Class of '66 Yar gear f'or casua1ists.

By that time representatives are supp~s­ ed to have discused the matter w1th the fraternity rank and file. a _living unit has a house party per- mit. .A:t the regular Student Council meeting held this Tuesday a 7 man committee was formed to study the ACC request and work out a uhi- form proposal with the IFC and UIC. The UIC and IFC Presidents have asked house presidents and unit lead- ers to initiate discussion of the rules and report to them before the All Col- lege Council meeting so a uniform proposal can be drawn up. Debate Centers on Sat. Hours The debate on the new hours cen- tered on the extension of room dat- ing priviledges to 3 a.m. on weekends with the proposals of Sunday hours of -12;8 p.m. and weekday hours of 1-6 p.m. passing a straw vote quite easily. Debate on the weekend hours was inconclusive and the proposals wer.e sent back to the originating councils to be studied in light of the new problems raised by the ACC. In the debate over these proposals Mike Michalski and Jim Rubinstein ACC member elect, strongly favored the proposal of the UIC and the stu- dent council as supporting a \sound philosophy.'• <J: Edward Pollock, Dean of Stu- dents, strongly objected to the ex- t~nt of, all of the proposals as pos- sJbly \Imposmg upon the majority to a greater extent than is necessary.\ He also objected to an all male resi- dence not being such dwing the week. Union is, he stated, \still a col- lege and (I) hope we remain su.ch!' freedom .Rubinstein objected that to say on Sunday we should go back to lleing a college was a \mistake\ in drawing the lines at social rules. College should be \more of an institution to ex:press students feelings\ and should fostel' freedom rather than restraint upon campus • Led by uean Pollock, a number of faculty members commented on the desirability of protecting the rights of students not dating. Dean Pollock also commented that the presence of girls does not . set the right \atmos- phere\ for study, regardless of the fact that studying might be unlikely at that time. The Council also discussed the re- sults of the housing survey and the general college housing policy but reached no consensus on housing. By ROBERT STOLZBERG Special from the Union·Star ·•If you keep pushing a man into a corner and keep pushing and push· ing, then you don't have to ask me what is going to happen,\ Floyd Mc- Kissick told a packed house Monday night in response to a question con- concerning the outlook for violence in the Negro ghettos this summer. National Director of the Congress of Racial Equality, McKissick's topic was \Black Ghetto and Black Power.\ McKissick spoke of the split in American soCiety between the whites and blacks, pointing to a significant inability of the two to communicate. ··we live in two separate worlds, a black world and a white world, and each thinks differently from the other. So when two simple words come out of the ghetto-one black, and one power-it created an amazing stir.\ Nothing tllegitimate McKissick emphasized that thel'c was nothing surprising or illegitimate about the black community's desire to attain power, for \the people in the ghettos decided that they need power to determine their own course.\ This power must take several forms, he said. The first type of power is political power. \The black man has been taught to stay out of politics-it is dirty. Well, we have decided that it is a mighty clean process if you are going to affect you.r own f11ture,\ McKissick said in defendiM Martin Luther King's entTy into politics. Closely allied to political power is economic }lower, for McKissick sees the black people as \the only people in the capitalist system without any capital.\ \We have got to develop economic power by joint enterprises which will allow the lllack man to plan his own future.\ McKissick pointed to a co- operative in Mississippi as an example of success in this endeavor, but accused the national comm11nications media of ignoring these successes in favor of reports on violence and destruction. Pike Elected President; Aronsta·tnnt Gains VP Newly elected Student Body Officers, Grady Arons:lttmm, V.P. and Ray Pike, President. Missing is Robert Burwick, Secretary. :Raymond Pike, '69 piled up 441 votes to Junior Robert Winner's 290 votes to win re-election as Student C!>uncil President and All-College Council Chairman, in voting this past Monday. Pike had previously held the office of President briefly in Hl65 but left school because of academic diffi. culties. · Grady Aronstamm, '69 narrowly edged out Art McCabe, '69, for the newly created office ·Of Vice President as he tallied 335 votes to McCabe's 330, Robert Burwick, '70, running for Student Council Secretary, easily de- feated Alvin Levi 1 '69, 477 to 216. After the election Pike e>epressed his desire to improve communjcations between the student body and the stu- dent council. He would like to write a regular column for Concordiensis and have a show on WRUC to further communications. Pike stated he would ask Winner to return to his position as Chairman of the Constitutional Revision Com- mittee and find positions for McCabe and LevL Aronstamm stated he will press for a continued liberalization of social rules, more correspondence through the Concordiensis, and more activities and functions that cater to minority interests. Floyd McKissick speaking at Monday's Convocation The central point of the evening's speech was that the black man must develop a better image of himself. \Everything in this country which is good is called white and everything bad is called black/' McKissick said. 'The Negro has to uevelop respect for himself.'' His voice breaking with emotion, he declared that he considered the black man's attributes, whether phy- sical or cultural or otherwise to be worthwhile for themselves and re- fused to allow that they should be considered somehow inferior. Another point is the need for im- provement of t.he black man's posi- tion in society. \This country has not come far enough to respect the black man enough to let him have two words-black power. All the white man has to do is get born to get his constitutional rights. But the Negro who goes through college will, accord- ing to federal statisticsh earn $4,000 per year less than the w ite men who graduate with him and get the same degree.\ Racism But in the final analysis the black man's position in society is dependent on \racism-you can have all the laws you want, but it does not mean any- thing if the policeman who enforces them is a racist.\ Symbolic of the black man's plight is the status of his leadership. He defended Adam Clayton Powell, the Negro Congressman from Harlem who was recently excluded from the United States House of Representatives on charges of unethical conduct, saying \Adam is a symbol of the black man's place in this society. No one in Har- lem says tltat Powell is a perfect man. The people know what he is and what he does. :But Adam has fought for the little man and marched for him, both white and black and he has a glowing record of legislative accomplishments. In a question period after his pre- pared statement, McKissick said the policy of CORE is \non-violent-bnt that doesn't mean to give up the right of self-defense. I can't tell anyone to lay there and let someone beat him up. After you have turned both cheeks, then you pick up a two by four.'' Ivy Network Convention Hosted Here by WRUC WRUC, the Union College radio sta- tion, will host the Ivy Radio Network Convention tomorrow and Saturday. Almost 100 delegates from all the Ivy league schools, plus representatives from the other affiliate colleges, and observers from several other institu- tions will attend the two day confer- ence. Principle speaker at the annual af. fair wil be John Downey, a Vice Pres- ident of C.B.S. radio~ and General Manager of WCAU raaio in Philadel· phia. WCAU, under Mr. Downey's di- rection, has become one of America's most respected talk radio stations, A native of Hartford, Connecticut, Downey will deliver a major address at the Friday banquet. He will dis- cuss the problems of integrating a radio station and its format into the community it serves. Delegates from over sixteen differ- ent institutions will start to arrive at Union late Friday afternoon. A re- ception and registration will take place in Hale House Lounge, which will serve as convention headquarters during the two day affair from 4 :30 to 6:30. At 6:30 there will be a cock- tail hour at the Viking's Restaurant. followed by a banquet at 7:30 and Downey's address after the meal. Fri- day night, de~egates will be given tours of WRUC, and will have an op- portunity to discuss radio in Hale House. Delegates are being housed in unused rooms in Fox hall. Sales Organizations Saturday morning, delegates will at- tend seminars concerned with differ- ent aspects to broadcasting. Program- ming and sales talks will take up the morning sessions. Prominent radio per- sonnel, including Bill Sherwood, na- tional sales director of WTRY, will lead the discussion groups. There will be a buffet luncheon Saturday, fol- lowed by additional seminars and an Ivy Network board meeting. Delegates to tlie convention have been encouraged to stay for the Beach Boys concert to be held Saturday night. It's expected that about 60% of the almost one hundred delegates wil avail themselves of the planned concert. The Ivy Radio Network is the na- tional sales organization for its mem- ber stations. Last year, it billed al- most eighty thousand dollars which was dispersed among its member sta- tions. Until early last fall, the Net- work was composed exclusively of Ivy League colleges. The Network wished to expand, and looked for what it con- sidered the best stations at non-Ivy League institutions. Union, Williams, Colgate, Lehigh, Rutgers, and M.I.T. were offered network membership. At the first Ivy Board meeting, Union's Dick Ferguson was one of two affiliate representatives elected to the Board of Directors. Non·lvy School In past years, the Ivy convention has been held at different Ivy League schools. This year, l!nion, Williams, and Colgate arc planning the conven- tion. Dick Ferguson is General Chairman of the convention, and Bob Killian and Dick Reingold are c o o r d i n a t i n g WRUC's efforts in the planning. The banquet Friday night will mark the first year during which affiliate stations enjoyed membership privi- leges. \It is quite appropriate,\ noted Convention Chairman Ferguson, \that the banquet this year should be co- sponsored by three affiliate stations, and held at a non-Ivy campus. This six station expansion increased Ivy's potential audience by almost fifteen thousand students. The fact that the convention is being held at an affili- ate school, is testimony to the integral position of the affiliates in this former Ivy League club.'\ Notices Dance articulates feelings that elude words. The Skidmore Group invites yen to enjoy emotion caught in movement. Come see ow· songs, April 27, ~8 and 29, in Little Theatre, Regent Street, Saratoga Springs. The program begins at 8:00 P.M. Bring self and spirit, and leave your petmies home: admission is free, All places in North College Hotel have been filled. It will open at 4:30 p.lll. on Friday night. Men using the hotel Inttst bring the blanltet and pillow that they are providing when their dates arrive. Bed linen and a towel are provided.

How could this body be expected to effect a change in rules when the students themselves could not agree on an equitable ar- rangement? It is the duty of the students to insure that such an incongrous state of affairs does not again occur. Liberal- ization of weekend visiting hours should not be problem- atic to either fraternities or independents. In either case, a fraternity house or a dormitory living unit can vote to limit the visiting hours if they so desire. The inability of a few students to act reasponsibly under such liberalized conditions should not prohibit the vast majority of con- scientious men from enjoying the freedom they deserve. The administration, however, did not present a reason- able case against change by stating that the lack of many serious violations during the last year should not indicate that the students are acting responsibly. Such a stance, unless verifiable, is absurd. Furthermore, Dean Pollock's opinion that liberalization will lead to a less desirable college ''atmosphere\ is a purely one-sided consideration. The ability to entertain female guests more often will not necessarily induce a \party atmosphere\ at the school. If anything, it will produce healthier living conditions. Hail To The Chief Corcordiensis wishes to congratulate Ray Pike on his overwhelming victory last Monday night. We wish him, and the other newly elected officers, the best of luck dur- ing their administration. Mr. Pike's previous experience in student government and the opportunity to work with Benjamin Volinski throughout the remainder of this term should provide a solid foundation from which the presi- dent-elect can build his programs next Fall. The college is fortunate indeed that Mr. Volinski, a conscientious and thoughtful student leader, can provide the new adminis- tration with an insight into the workings of community government. Mr. Volinski's experience, during the first, difficult year under the new system, should be of great value to student government at Union. ---------------------------- Concordiensis regrets the error carried in last week's editorial concerning the candidates for Student Body Pres- ident. It was implied there that the newly elected presi- dent would take office this term. The president-elect will not assume his post until Fall, 1967. However, the president-elect's pre-election statement, broadcast by WRUC, distorted the editorial by calling it an \attack\ on the elections and by accusing the news- paper of being \out of touch\ with student government because the editorial assumed that the A CC was facing a \crisis.\ Hopefully, a re-reading of the editorial will point out that it was certainly not an \attack\ on anything. Further- more, no intimation of a \crisis\ was included. The ACC is obviously considering important .topics this term; such topics, however, do constitute a \crisis\ in themselves. Thursday, April 27., 1967 Letters To The Editor Non-Roma11tic US To The Editor: The organi.zers of 'Union- Skidmore' (US) disagree whole- heartedly with De.an Pollock's point of view towards the re- lationship between Union men and their lady friends, as ex- pressed in his remarks at the All College Coullctl meeting last week. It seems to US that he is only looking at this issue from the \date\ frame of refeTence. He denies both tlu ligelihood and the validity of .tH>n-romantic relationships between. men and women. ln his opp()sition to the proposed extens1uns of hours for women in Union men's rooms, Dean PolloC!k postulated that parietal homrs lead directly and exclusiVeLy to a party at- mosphere m residence l~aus and fraternity hours. US feels that Urnon men and their women friends are mature enough so tl1at their holtrs t()geth~r need not be exclusively limited to romanticizing . .And if Dea11 Pol- lock truly believes that Union men are mherently 'horny,' then the fault lies with the immatur- ity of Union, not its mea, Sincerely, Neil S. Kramer for US tunately, Concordy did not bother to do this, nor do I .feel WRUC gave the elections ade- quate coverage. There also remains the prob- lem of a limited n.umber of stu- dents who care to make use of their vote. If all students were to make as much effort to vote as the elections committee makes to get them to vote, then the turn out would be closer to 75<.;<, rather than the present 50%. Frank McKim Chairman, Student Council Elections Committee Non-Involvement To The Editor: One womlers why the average Union student does not care who arc to elect them. There ought to be a presentation of issues and aspirations. The popularity contest natm e of Union elections probably <muses qualified men to avotd running for office.

How Delta Chi ,, Thursday, April 27, 1967 On Crutches and Things Ibsen said if you stripped a m<m's v,ta• lie trom him, you left him nothing to believe. I don't want to take any.body's crutch which is why [ didn't take the notice in the Humani- ties Center from the bulletin board and throw it in a waste- basket. Instead I straightened it, leaving it hanging along with some beliefs. It is a smal·l awk· ward notice printed on yellow lined paper torn from an execu- tive pad, asking a big question: Union, Convent or College? As . far as I know it is stHl hanging. It's not the kind of question one gets rid of easily. After a hectic season of peace marching and be-in sand hom bs, it's comforting to know we can always return to old Union problems and burn some effigies on a local level. The effect is more immediate. Curfews Like the IFC controversy over social rule revision. A newspaper editorial can upset a lot of people. So can a pro- posal that advocates three o'clock curfews for independ- WANTED Banjo or folk singing group, plus piano player, td play evenings and weekends. Call HE 9 .. 5213 After 5:00 P.M. ents only on those weekends that houses are a:JIO\ved three o~clocks. What Mr_ L,ouis wanted was \an approacb. with modera- tion.\ The IFC proposal was in.tended to benefit the entire student body by allowing three o'clock privileges for dormitory students not presently having those privileges. \'The faculty,\ Louis said, asked for solid justi- fication for change if pushed for three o'clock .curfews every weekend. It seemed to the IFC that a proposal would stand a Letter chance of passing if we only ask for hour revisions on house party weekends.\ Myths But we've got our myths to support, so let's grab ho'ld of our vital lies and perpetrate the· feeling that the IFC is a selfish organization opposed to all that Union stands for and that the member organizations of the IFC are infiltrating independ- ent sections of dorm complexes in an attempt to suppress the minority. Union's own CIA. Un- fortunately it's not true. \The fact that increased social hours CAMPUS CLEANERS 527 NOTT ST. Opposite Union College 393-5472 for independents might or might not be detrimental to fratermty life and rushing policies was not. mentioned in the IFC dis- cussion,\ Louis said. Integrate It's to our credit that while the administration is doing its best to integrate an segments of the student body into a com- mttnity we still have eno~:~gh of our senses remaining to split into factions over a myth. It's something to think about. How we continue to divide under the pretense of unification. How we create our own isolated, aban- doned, and discriminaecl minor- ity out of a lie that anything Greek is unsound and oppres- sive. Bat then we have to kid our- selves once in a while. If you doH't keep the old illusions nothing constructive gets ac- complished. Like standing in New York with a middle finger raised over a Union placard. But I don't want to take any- body's crutch. So independents believe. Agitation will out. l. G.

Concordy BEACH BOYS TICKETS STILL AVAILABLE Sports IFC REVISITED Page3 E La &! GarnetNineNipsHamilton,· VARSITY TENNIS The Union College netmen won their second straight by beating RPI in a dramatic 5-4 match. The three hour event was finally decided when Chris Komiserjevsky and Brad Wheat- ley made a comeback victory to break the 4-4 match tie, and seal the victory. The victory was a complete surprise to the En· pineers, who had beaten the Garnet 9-0 last year, and in- sured Union of a much more successful season than last year's 0,9 record. Stickmen Triumph Twice By GARY PREVOST Tom Miller's single to right with the bases loaded and two out in the bottom of the ninth inning gave the Garnet nine a 3-2 decision over Hamilton at Alexander Field yesterday. Bob Hallenback went the distance lor the Garnet, scattering six hits. The outing was the Gar- net's first after five consecutive rainouts. The Continentals built up an early 2-0 lead on a two run single by Root in the third in- ning. The Garnet were held completely in check by Frosh Chet Suida, the Hamilton start- er, for the first six innings. The Garnet scored a run in the sev- enth on a single by Brian Girl- low, a walk to Bob McAdams and a run producing single by Greg Olson, who had three hits in the game. Winning Rally The Garnet began their game- winning rally in the ninth, when with one out Mike Solomon drew a walk. After McAdams forced Solomon, Olson delivered a sharp single to right sending .McAdams to third and taking second himself. Dave Hourigan was walked intentially to load the bases and then Bill Toth drew a very unintentional walk to tie the game and set the stage for Miller's game winning blow. The Garnet travel to Williams tomorrow and face Pratt Satur- day on Alexander Field at 2:00. They will then take on RPI here next Tuesday. By LEN SIMON The Garnet lacrosse team pushed its record to 3-1 with victories over Hamilton and Al- fred. They defeated the Con- tinentals 8-3 Saturday and squeaked by the Saxons 7-6 yes- terday. Saturday they will play the Tri-City Lacrosse Club at 10 A.M. At Alfred the Garnet had to rally from behind in the final period to take their third vic- tory. The first period was score- less, but the following stanza was loaded with action as the stickmen outscored Alfred 5-2. However, in the third period Al- fred completely dominated and scored four times while shutting out Union and forged into the lead 6-5. In the final period the Dutchmen found the range again to tie and go on to win 7-6. Steve Ritterbush scored twice and assisted on one other goal in leading the attack. Sam Dill also scored twice and Ware Ful- ler, Ken Milne, and Gary Raden added a goal apiece. Lee Schnieder, usually leading the scoring and playmaking along with Ritterbush, was held to only one assist by the Saxons. Keith Gregory scored three goa,ls for Alfred, now 1-1. Eager Gamet Saturday the stickmen had considerably more breathing room, but still needed a strong finish to whip Hamilton 8-3. The Continentals opened the scoring with the only goal of the first period, and ·the second quarter saw each team scoring once. Hamilton took a 2-1 lead into the second half but was out- scored 4-0 by the eager Garnet in the third quarter. The Dutch- men then finalized the decision with three more goals in the fourth quarter, against one by Hamilton. Lee Schnieder, Steve Ritterbush, Ken Milne, and Dana Jones each had two mark- ers for the Garnet. The freshman team, now 2-0 after a big victory over Hobart, travels to Siena tomorrow for their third contest. Yachtsmen Cop Second; Sail at Cornell May 5 For the second week in a row Union College's yachtmen ven- tured to Cornell's home waters at Lake Cayuga to take part in a Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association meet. The team placed second, behind Cornell and ahead of Clarkson, after display- ing an outstanding effort in the face of a great many disadvantages. It might well be said that Cornell's victory can be attributed entirely to their ability to keep their boats from swamping in the highly unfavorable conditions. Union, faced with unfamiliar boats in wind conditions that varied in intensity from no breeze to severe gusts with tornado warnings and in directions by sudden goo shifts, rallied gallantly after the first couple o£ heats. Jeff Fitter, with brilliant crew support, placed first in one race. The rest of the team, consisting of Commodore Bob Gill, Alan Miller, and Charlie King, also performed admirably. The Garnet will again compete at Cornell on May 5. Union's victory was the result of a well rounded and inspired team effort. Union had four vic- tories in the six singles matches including a come from behind victory by Jeff Kurzius at first singles and straight set wins by Brad Wheatley, Chris Komiser- jevsky, and Marty Berry, at third, fourth, and sixth singles respectively. 'I'he next match is away against Hobart on Saturday. If the Garnet can beat Hobart, their chances are excellent for the ICAC title.
