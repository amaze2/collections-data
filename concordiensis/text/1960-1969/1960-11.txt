Due to the na- tur·e of the p·rogram and the qual- ifications necessary for a student to be considered, the program will probably never be a large one, commented Lowen. There are .several students being considered presently, and there is a good possibility that one or mm·e of them wHI spend next year in Zur- ich.

Of those schools 'Surveyed, not including Union, four have al- rPady or will in all probability raise their tuition charges for the 1961-1962 acad<>mic year. Am- herst will raise tuition approxi- mately $100 and wom rent $25 !frot;n $275 to $300l. Clarkson has alreadv announced an increase Pquali~ing both science anrl engin- eering fees at $1,300, fifty dollars more than Union. Hamilton is expected to inl'rease its tuition to $1,300 with dorm rent remaining at $3.50 and a general fee of a·bout $100. Furthermore Lehigh has al- ready announced a tuition rise of $300, bringing their charges up to $1.400, and $150 more than Union. At this moment neither Cornell nor Haverford have announced a fiscal policy for the 1961-1962 year. Wesleyan, on th<> other hand, will retain its present fees but antici- pates an increase for the 1962- 1963 year. Although not mi,.ing tuition, Hobart will probably in- crease its general fee either $50 or $100. The other colleges con- sidered will in all likelihood re- tain their present schedule of fees. According to the figures pre· sented relating to dormitory rent, Union's $300 does not appear out of line, the overall range being lletween $270 and $350. Tlw admissions office suggested that •·the deal wouhl be to plan tuition increrrses two years in ad- vance.\ Consequently, a high school sE'ni or applying- for ad- mission would have an accurate statement of his expenses as a fr<>Rhman.

The increase, in the form of s<'ho!R.rships, loans or grants-in- aid, will be catried through suc- ceeding years, said he.

The following are paraphrased Finally, and closest to home is the state of New York. New York will support Kennedy with its de- cisive 45 votes. A New York vic- tory for Kennedy seems obvious, with only the size of his plurality in question. Many observers, how- ever, predict a closer New York race. I feel that Kennedy will sweep the great city itself by al- most one million votes. Kennedy will also win in Roch- ester, Buffalo, Schenectady, and of coUI,Se, Albany. But up-state, Kennedy and Nixon will slug it out. The traditionally Republi- can up-state vole will not decrease this lead sufficiently. Overall, I believe Kennedy will win in New York State by 500,000 to 750,000 votes. One week .before election, it appears that John F. Kenn<>dy will he the next Pt·esident of the United States. as the most basic re-statements or l:hanges now in effect: There may be only three \Prom Weekends\ a year, along with an additional night party with the approval of the Dean of Stu- dents. Men may not stay overnight in those fraternities which are housing their women, and must observe the various visiting hour;;. And that one such rule is that the men may be in these houses from 8 AM Saturday, until 3 AM Sunday on Prom Weekends. Men may at no time go above the first floor when their house is being occupied by women. The College does not encourage the use of alcoholic beverages at student social functions. Use is permitted upon proper noti- fication of the Dean of Stu- dents, but the abuse of such beverages \will not be condon- ed.\ All fraternity social functions extending beyond 8 PM must be properly chaperoned by either two couples or a social hostess. All social functions, both on and off campus, must be registered and approved by the Dean of Students. A newly formulated Committee on Fraternity Contro.J, compos- ed of the President of the Alum- ni Council, another member elected from the Council, a fac- ulty member, the IFC President, and the Dean of Students, shall hear charged violations of the Social Regulations. The above rules are not inclu- sive of the Social Regulations and should be merely taken as an illust·ration of the highlights of the program, .. I ,.: I j \ .. '.• ..

He is the features editor of the Conc.ordiensis and not a member of the sports staff of the paper. His article consists main- ly of conclusions and opinio)ls which, in normal newspapers, should be printed on the edi-torial page, as a letter to the ·editor, or not at all. Finally, the qualifica- tions of Mr. Lentchner as an ex- pert on soccer make the value of the article highly tdubious. His soccer experience consists of a rather obscure role on the fresh- man squad and ·one day on the varsity team.

What Mr. Lentchner criticizEs as the fullbacks and wings playing out of position was actually the strategy devised by Coach. Carl Witzel to contain Alex Guild. The success of the strategy is proven by the fact that Guild, an All- American for two years and a member of the United States team in the Pan-Am games, was held to one goal and one assist in the entire game. This is a mattEr of record which Mr. Lentchner could have checked before writing his article. Mr. Lentchner also deduces from this one game that the team lack- ed practice in ftindil.tnentil.ls. Again, if Mr. Lentchne!' had taken the trouble to find out the truth, he would have found that the team spent almost all of its time on basic drills and scrimmaged only five times in the six week season. Perhaps it can be said that. Mr. Lentchner's writing shows too much emphasis on generalizations instead of a good grasp 'Of the ABC's of responsible repo.rtlng. If .the article truly steiWned from Mr. Lentchner's concern for the state Q.f athletics at Union, we suggest that the!'e are more re- sponsible and more constructive ways for him to express his con- cern. The poor showing of the soccer team cannot be blamed on Coach Witzel, but s·hould ·be di- 1 rectly attributed to the prospec- tive soccer players who, as :I.'I:r. Lentchner, do not even :JJother to come out or quit during the sea- son. The publishing of fallacious, ill-considered, irresponsible and immature snap judgments such as Mr. Lentchner's will only increase the smug, apathetic attitude to- ward sports on campus ra.ther than serve t6 m{)tivate the poten- tial athletes to change conditions by contributing with their actions.

Some Interesting O·bservations on the election were made by Paul Winston, Chairman 'Of the Stu- dent Council Election Committee. He stated that the number of stu- dents voting in the election com- pared favorably with the records made by previous classes. How- ever, Winston emphasized that the turnout could have been greatly improved as only five out of thirty-nine commuters found time to vote, and 15 ROTC men did not make any attemrt to cast their ballots due ,o a meeting of their group. ---o--- George N.

He said th€ . Mausoleum has become a relig- ious shrine. There a1·e always long lines of Russians waiting to view the dead leaders. While Reid was in the Mausoleum, he viewed two weeping women. Both teams in tomorrow's fracas have made great cotllebaclts from a poor· '59 season. Hamilton had a 2-5 record last year; losing to such schools as King's Point, RPI, and Swarthmore. The only wins she scored were against Hobart (12-7), and last year's Union {14-0).

Bob Skloot, leading character. Immigration Investigated . Handlin, an authority on immi- gration, has w,ritten several books on the subject. For his first, Bos- f(}n's Immigrants, he received the American Historical Association Dunning Prize. Although his most recent book is Inunigratiun as a. Factor in Alnel'ican History (1959), his hest !mown work is The Uprooted for which he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1951. The Herald Tribune com- mented, \The Uprootf>.d concerns the personal human side of the flood of immigration ... \ In ad- dition to his many histories, he has contributed many articles dealing with educationa,l and his- torical subjects to well-known periodicals including \The Atlan- tic Monthly\ and \The New York Times Magazine.\ Cell Division Hypotheses Is Presented Raymond Rappaport, Jr., Associate Professor of Bi61- ogy, lectured oil division in animal cells last w ednesd.ay- to a joint meeting of Sigma Xi and the Pre-Medical Soci- ety.

According to the first hypothesis the surface is com- posed of the inner surface of the original cell, while the surface of the constricting ring cell is composed of the original surface of the cell which has thinned- out . Sch!esinger\s Influence Felt Handlin was born in Brooklyn in 1915. He gmduated from Brooklyn College in 1934. Later at Harvard University, he came under the influence of Professor Arthur M. Schlesinger. Handlin reminisced, \He directed my at- tentions to the subjects of' social history that have since occupied much of my attention.\ His doc- torate was a report on the \in- flux of immigrants into Boston In the late 18th and early 19th centuries with consideration to the society the immigrant found on arrival and the society he left behind.\ ---o,--- Tho Campus RE>Iigious Cbuucil o:f Union College will sponsor a book drive the \Veek of Nevem- bt>r 14-19..

This was done by placing the speci- men on a glass plate, placing beads on top and then inverting the apparatus which would then support the cell with a weight applying stress on the opposite end of the organism. In conclus.ion, Rappaport hinted that his work was inconsistent with the constvictin·g ring theory. However, he doubted if this con- clusion was the simple so.Jutlon.

About ten percent of all students fail' every year, especi- ally in the more difficult institu-' tions. Thus they need at least one more year to come to the finish of their pre-university edu- cation. When a pupil from a gymnas-; ium gets- to the ·end of his school,' he knows about as much as a· junior in an American college. An alumnus from a modern five, year grammar school has reached the !'eve! of a sophomore-a:t seven-'· teen or eignteen years of age.

Despite. the !ncreased financial burdens and humiliatmg hardships which these Victorian rules caused, the student body deserves co?~rat­ ulations on the maturity and restraint that they exh1b1ted. Particularly helpful in engendering this prudent atti- tude were the last-minute rule changes, which were the result of constructive cooperation between the Inter-Fra- ternity Council, the Alumni Inter-Fraternity Council, pean Pollock's office and the College Trustees. IFC President William Kirchg~sser and his Council are especially :vorthy of praise for their initiation of the program to modify the inequities which are inherent in the new rules. One of the trickiest and most perplexing problems raised by the combination of the new rushing rules and the new social rules was the dilemma faced by fraternity men who were homeless on prom weekend. When women occupy fraternity houses, sleeping on the first floor, in the basement and other segregated areas is prohibited under the present rules. In previous years, fraternity men sought acromodations in the dormitory quarters of their freshmen pledges, but this alternative became un- feasible with the advent of defeTred rushing. In addition to this enigma, which under the present rules will recur every fall weekend, a larger and more pressing problem clemly continues to exist. We predict that the unrealistic and archaically strin- gent social rules could J)]'ecipitate a future situation in which large numbers of fraternity men might be forced off campus to seek entertainment and sleeping; accomoda- tions in the community; with the associated problems in- volving driving, noise, and the jeopardy to coveted town- gown relations. To hope that the student body will continue to co- operate in situationS\ arising from the new rules is a laud- able thought, but problems should be faced squarely rather than circumvented. Election Elicits Entropy As a result of last night's freshmen elections, the Student Council Eleet.ions Committee has released a signi- ficant set of statistics regarding the effect of election apathy of a small group. While approximately 66 percent of the freshman class voted last night, (a figure compaeable to that of previous years) 34 out of 39 commuters neglected to cast their ballots. Similarly, lfl freshmen failed to vote because of their attendance at an ROTC exercise which was held con- currently with the election. The Elections Committee had forseen both these diffi- culties and had exerted substantial and well-directed ef- forts to inform commuters and airmen of the election and make provisions for them to vote before the regular election in the Dean of Student's Office. Had both groups voted, the percentage of freshman voter turnout would have increased to over 80 percent. Eternal v:igilance is the price of good student govern- ment. · Calendar Change Coveted A cursory perusal of the official college calendar marks January 2nd as the day on which classes resume following the Christmas recess. Students and faculty will there~ ore be compelled to travel back to Schenectady from vacations on New Yea1·s Day, traditionally a national holi- day. The Student Council might perform a thankful ser- v~c.e to the college col!lmunity by investigating the feasi- bility of a change lll the calendar to permit classes to begin a day later. the others attend day or evening Succeeding in these exams means courses twice or three times a a ticket for admission to a uni- week. versity, if you d:esire it.

The Ministry of Educa- tion grants subsidies to every kind of school and, although 1vatching how the money is spent, refrains from any direct interfer- ence. The government has no voice at all in the appointment of .teaching staff; school ·boards are completely free in the choice of educational appliances and methods; and only an independent body called the Educational Coun- cil can fix or criticize the stand- ard of any school. lor the finest in · ~•i IIIIIIIIIIIJIIIIIIUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIJ.;: , . ~L.

Edgar Curtis, head of the De- partment of Music, labeled Sing- her \One of the finest young bari- ton~s anywhere in the world.\· An American, Singher, has ap- peared with both the Paris and' Metropolitan Opera has made recordings with Radio Corporation of America,. and was a soloist with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Singher Sings Songs Mozart's \Overture to Don Gio- vani\ Will lbe the opening selec- tion; following, Singher will per- form two arias from Purcell's \Music for the Tempest.\ Then, the orchestra will present two numbers by Duparc. Three se- lections from \Dol'l Quichotte\ 'by Ravel, .one o.f which will be dedi- cated to Martial Singher, will 'be the final rendition before the in- termission. The second half of the pro- gram will open with Bartok's \Two Images\ which he wrote in 1910 when he was only twenty- eight. The first movement of this composition closely resem- ·bles Debussy's works. Bel:lioz's suite from ·\The Damnation o:f Faust'' will give a dimactic end to the program. Singhei' himself selected this suite ·because it is very infrequent that he can sing this number with the ac- companiment of an orchestra. The suite ends with the famous \Hung11-rian March.\ It is inter- esting to note that many of the numbers orjginated as literary works, for example, \Don Quixote\ and \Faust.\ ;Delta Upsilon will hold a re- ception, which will ·be open to the public, after the concert so that those who <!.re interested can meet Martial Singher. ---01--- Chapel Exhibits Late American Art A neW' art exhibit entitled \Recent American Art:Two will open November 20 and con- tinue through December 17 in the Old Chapel Gallery.

On October 24, 1952, station KDKA sent-a telegram to WRUC in which they claimed to be the first.

The first order of ·business was an announcement that Miss Mar· sha Van Cleve, representative from the World University Sel\'- vice, was to be a guest of th~ -col!e~ge the following day, and that a discussion would be held Wednesday night concerning sttt- dent awareness of national and international affairs. Chairman Gross expressed hc>pe that a large number would attend. One of .the more Unportant points of the evening was a mo- tion to petition the Faculty Coun- cil to call off clru;ses on Monday, January 2, so that students and faculty would not be forced to return to cam})us on New Year's Day as the schedule now de- mands. This motiun was passed and the petition will be sent too the Faculty Council whose next meeting is December 6. Increased Contact Requested Discussion was spurred when one of the new members of the council, Michael Gero asked if it would be possible to 'have more personal contact oetween frater- nity men and freshmen before rushing began. Mr. Kirchgasser stated that discussion groups had been considered, but that due to lack of interest the idea had been dropped temporarily. Kirchgasser anticipated that tQ.e idea might be revived if sufficient interest was generated in its behalf. Since ~t was felt that this was properly m the realm of the I.F.C., further discussion was brought to a close. It was announced that all Win- ter Prom bids would be due at the next Student Council Meeting.

The story concerns tw·o refugees from Poland who m.eet in Paris during 1940. Jacabowsky (Danny Kaye) is a wandering Jew who has spent his life keeping one jump ahead of the persecutions of Europe. The colonel is just the opposite. Be Is a pompous, hig'hborne professional soldier~ typically an ti15emetic. The two contrasting personal- ties have one thing in common, the desire to leave Paris before the Nazis arrive. Jacabowsky has a car, but doesn't lmow how to drive. The colonel can drive, but lacks a vehicle. Thus, the two make a practical alliance. The picture deals with the social con- sequences of this alliance. Freshn1nn!

A:hy architectural firm which proposes it thereby demon- strates an aesthetic bankruptcy which justifies dismissal from the college projects. The Nott Memorial is in itself a kind of , monstrosity, but it is an hon- . est piece Of work, and in- . terestingly enough, has taken its place among the histor- ical monuments of this part of the. country. The proposal that it be made to conform to t:he orig- inal Ramee plan of the campus merely reve:J.ls that the proposer understands neither architecture nor principles of historical de- , velopment. \Architectural integ- . rity\ does not mean that all buildings must be made to coil- form to the same pattern.

In general, the team looks good, but will have an uphill fight for a winning season. Wins over the University of Buffalo, the University of Rochester, and Buf- falo State are almost assured. Hamilton and RPI meets should be close, but Union has a good chance to win these also, especi- ally since Henry Kumf, coach of RPI's team, lost eight of his best swimmers last June, and Hamil- ton has never beaten Union in swimming. There is little chance against Williams and NYU, but only time wil! tell how the clashes between Turner's Torpedoes and King's Point, Wesleyan, and Trin- ity will turn out. If they are lucky, the team will end up with a 6-4 record. Fifteen men are signed up fo-r the frosh squad. Of these, seven show tremendous potential, while the others, as yet, have not had enough practice for anyone to evaluate them. Times which have been taken for some of these freshmen in their high school days are better than anyone has ever done at Union, especially in the breaststroke and <Jrawl. Some of the names to be remembered are Bowles, Dryer, Hollinger, Shnall, Rosen, and Bean. With the loss of Ed Ruth 1 John Lubetkin, and Jim MacDonald the team this year will not be of as high a quality as last, but spirit, potential, and hard work will make up for their loss.

He wanted a job in which he could work his way into man- agement via the engineering route. As he puts it, \I didn't want to stick with straight engi- neering all my life.\ After talking to eight other organizations Jim joined The Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph Company. He soon got the kind of action he was looking for. His first assignment: How best to improve widely scattered rural telephone service all over Colorado-a sticky engineering challenge. He was given a free hand to work out his own pro- cedures. His boss simply said, \Find the answer, Jim-and bring it back.\ Six months later, Jim turned m his recom- mendations. His plan was accepted. Next stop: Colorado Springs. Here Jim worked out a plan to expand telephone facilities for this burgeoning community. This plan, too, is now in operation. Today, at 24, Jim has an important role in planning where, how much, and wliat kind of telephone service is needed in the Denver area. Here's how Jim puts it: \We get tough assign- ments- but we also have the freedom to take hold and do a job. I think the future here is unlimited. If a man wants to do it-it's there to be done.\ If you're a guy ~ho can \Find the answer- and bring it back\ -you'll want to get' with a com- pany where you have the chance.

He added that actually the techniq.ues used this year have not differed as much throughout the season as has the increased ability of the team to properly handle them.
