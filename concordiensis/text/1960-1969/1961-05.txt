Feature Editor A Door Left Open According to the Trustees' statement of the Basic Aims of Union, \the College will remain relatively small in size, expanding only to a maximum enrollment of approximately 1,250 students during the next decade. Recognizing that dose relationships between students and teachers are per- haps the greatest advantage of the small college, Union College will continue to regard such relationships as an important part of the educational process, designing its educational programs in accordance with this principle.\ Union does not attempt to compete with the large re- nowned university. Basically each offers a different at- mosphere for learning. The large university offers a faculty of rcYerf'd scholars each of whom often teaches a lecture course crowded with hundreds of students. There is little personal contact between professor and student under these circumstances. The student becomes a num- ber on a seating chart rather than an individual with an actively inquisitive mind. Union's approach to education in the past has been to encourage a close student-faculty relationship on both an educational and a social plane. Without such an association Union's prime attraction for a high calibre student will have vanished. Unfortunately, looking over the course schedule for next semester, one can not help but notice several signif- icant changs. Many of these changes are in the direction of replacing the small, twenty student class with a large lecture section. History 10, a course required of all stu- dents except those enrolled in the engineering division, has been revised. Where one used to attend three one hour sessions per week in a class of twenty, now the student attends two large lecture hours per week supplemented only by one recitation period. Under this system of education, the learning process has been reversed from one of infor- mal lecture discussion to one of almost complete, imper- sonal formality, an atmosphere which disco.urages the natural questioning prevalent under the former system. This conversion is not limited to History 10; similar experi- ments are being tried in other Division II courses as well as in next year's English Literature course. Basically, the college is destroying Union's individuality. Following through in this direction, Union \Vill be forced to compete on the same level with t.he large university, but lacking the scholars of the university, she can not hope to be success- ful in this competition. In increasing the efficiency of teaching in th·is manner the college is avoiding what many consider its primary responsibility in planning, an immediate increase of faculty salary scales. Oie solution to the problem of increasing faculty salaries is to cut down the number of men on the faculty. Such a diminishing would be accomplished by in- stituting more lecture courses such as those al;JOve. According to a survey done by the American Associa- tion of University Professors, Union's salary scale did not compare favorbly with those at schools of the same size and of equal c>alibre. Amherst, Wesleyan, Haverford and Swarthmore each pay their staff an average of over $1000 more per year than Union. Williams' scale was about $600 above Union's for the 1960-1961 period. In many of these cases, not only is the salary higher but the teaching load lower. The average Union professor must carry a load of twelve teaching hours as opposed to nine at Swarthmore. If Union is going to continue to attract a superior faculty, this serious deficiency must be alleviated in the very near future. The answer to this problem ls not in diminishing the faculty, because it will only open Union to a field of com- petition where she must inevitably lose. I\Tor does the ;m- swer lie in dependence on increasing tuition: tuition has risen consistently over the last five years to its present peak of $1250 for next year. If Union is to remain as a small school characterized by aU which the term \small school\ connotes, the faculty must increase. With this increase must also come a rise in salary scales as well as a decrease in teaching load, thus permitting more avail- able time to work with individual students. The money to finance this must come from an outside source, and we believe should be the first aim of the Trustee Development Program. Starvation Diet f)ept.: A Lacuna Of Education · By Edward Sld~ot Can it be that education in AmE>rica is, in truth, stultifying to thP student? That educational methods, impede, 1:ather than im- proYe inteHectual growth -of its t·ecipients ~- The cultivation of the mind, its discipline and development, is the urgent charge· of education. From . kindergarten through secondary ~c:hool a stu- dent is a stu- dent because he is expected t.o be one. Free education is ob- ligatory. It is a positive func- tion of g~»vern­ by individual ::ltate::l. Each singulai· state places different emphasis on it.s duty; that of providing a stimulating and creat1ve atmosphere in -which the student can develop. But the state can only progress as far as its educational ideals permit. J t is truly unfortunate that must people leave secondary school or college almost as incom- plete as when they entered. 'I'hese people have read more books, and ubtamed a degree or two as :Proof. But it is questionable whether they have expanded thei..r ideals aml now possess the ability to utilize what they have learned. H they haven't, this too, at. least 111 part, must be the fault of the educational ::>ystem to which they lw. ve bt:en exposed. EducatiOn in the United States i:; geared to accomodate t.he aver- age. Ba::lrc foundations are spread over severaL years like peanut butter on a piece of bread. This peanut l.Jutter if of mediocre qual- Ity. lf one chooses, he may obtain more, for the true benefits lie in the little nuggets of peanuts in- discriminately dispersed through- out the product. As peanllt but- ter, education's value lies sus- pended in a sticky, fudge-like convenience. It has been :proven that the second grade is a repe- tition of the first, with fewer re- cesses. And so it goes. Someone has suggested that the average sixth grader could easily know as much, infOl'mation-wise, as the average eighth grader and con- ceivably be more inspired at the outset of his high school ~areer. It is interesting to observe that the New York City Board of Education, a pioneer in the \rapid advance\ system in Junior High School, is now conside1•ing the revision of .its program, ••Rapid advance,\ where three years of studies are condensed into two, may soon revert back to th.e orig- inal three, in a program of en- riched curriculum. For those who find a rliet of peanut butte1· indigestiWe, an adequate and perhaps superior substitute should be found. This ensuing indigestion is a serl.ous ailment; and usually those with its product, an intellectual ulcer, s'eldom know that they ue .suf- fering. This so-called disease has easily discernible symptoms. Eventually affecting the mind, its prolonged early stages are char- acterized by a slow deterioration of the mental tract attributable to a void of protein. In laymans terms, the individual just doesn't get enough to eat. What should have been fed to him in a com- paratively brief .period of time has been proportioned intc> minute doses. Too much peanut butter causes malnutrition. After the individual has been sparsely fed, with nourishment of little value, he enters the sec- ond, and more harmful cycle. It occurs somewhere arotmd col- lege age. At this state l1e is in- cessantly forced-fed with partic- ular and specific material. Rather than this being a cure for the rapidly ex:panding illness, it serves to promote it. This sup- posed remedy is at the opposite end of the continuum. Now the disease is specialized! What is all this meant to dem- onstrate? That most o:f the stu- dents who enter college are un- prepared. Specifically, early edu- cation serves us with too little i~for'?ation, and too little inspixa- twn m cons11quence. The merits of early education are too \few and far between\ to be truly bene· ficial. This system is incomplete because its material is incom- plete; Most students enter a col· lege with the very barest essen- tials. They are, so to spea;k, un- der-fed, although their intellec- tual digesti:ve systems can easily accomodate a more enriched diet. . Thus tile college or university IS compelled to take its entering class and feed it with requi11ed eourses. There are two reasons for this. The first is that each student must be somehow made the equal of his classmate by eating and processing identical information. The second motive is; that a mature and well-round- ed individual must possess some fundamental information with which to meet the world upon hiS grad\.tation. It seems that many colleges have misused these essential cour- ses. Ratl1er than afford a student some basic touchstones, and pre- sent him with the vita,l variety necessary in selecting his future profession, required courses are frequently uninspiring, wastefui-, and presented in a haphazaru manner. However, this is not the problem~s erux. What proceeds after those re- quired courses is almost always as stifling as early education is fruiltless. In college, one's diet is specialized. The irrefragable tre·nd is to become terribly pro- ficient in one field at the ex- pense of all others. It is the rare individual' who can be \versatile.\ Before he !mows a little about a lot, he must ·know a .Jot abot1t a little. So college produces super- ior mechanical engineers who have never heard of Chaucer. It produced \pre-meds\ who can name every bone in the shark, ):mt never have played a game oii ball. It frequently produces Shakespearian authorities who can not write a letter. So<1n after entering a college, a student must become a \master of one\. In sum, the non-college man may never have heard of nu- clear fission; but the college man may know only nuclear fission. We find we must swim before we can float. This is the perplexing fate of education. One .goes from an in- sufficient <liet, to one with a pre- ponderance of fats but no protein. It is the aim of education that should be re-examined. If it pro- poses t<> produce one-sided, in- complete results, it is fulfilling its aims well. If it is meant that a person should devote himself to but une endeavor, then it has been successful. But if education's pm·pose is to open new doors of interest, to discipline and develop a mind, to seed the intellect with countless opportunities, then it has had abortive results. What the educational market may well need is a \new ubiqui- tous comestible.\ CITY HALL LAUNDERETTE Do It Yourself Laundry Washers - 25c a week !Holds up lo 10 lbs.l large Dryers - 1 Oc for 10 min. 529 Liberty St. · Open 24 hours a day - 7 days a week !Holds up to 40 lbs.l PETER PAUSE Good Food At Price You Can Afford Opp. North College Gate O~EN· DAILY 7 a.m.-9 p.m. (Closed Sat,urday l The Acme Barber Shop Where Service is a Pleasure 509 UNION STREET Letter To.TheEditor To .the Editor of Concordiensis: In Professor Grave's course in the psychol0gy of the personality the student at the beg-inning of the first semester is confronted with an usual situation. He is told that there will be no assign- ments and no hour tests. His only task will be to ·develop his .conception of what the healthy personality is. He is instructed that the procec\ure will be that of the critical incident method in which the student selects from his daily experience incidents which, according to his own think- ing, illustrate the healthy per- sonality in operation. Incidents may be selected from boolts, movies, daily experience and e¥en other students' papers submitted ,in previous years. Consequently the student must conduct his own research. His attention is directed to the behavior of people within his experience and he is required to judge whether their behavior is healthy or not. After formu- lating his conception from the data present in his collection of incidents ·the student submits his conception of the healthy person- ality for a grade. It is shortly returned, graded, to him and he .is allowed to improve it and re• submit it as many times as he. wishes to attain a higher grade. In Professor Pearce's course the student is told eve.n less about what he is to do for the semester's work. Although the former is criticized, for his method, he per- sists in offering the opportunity for the mature student to really lem·n something through his own interest and initiative. I am convinced by my exper- ience in Professor Grave's course that the educational experiences which are most interesting -and best remembered are usually Down to Louis', let us go, Let the lager freely flow.

Y. Plenty! Consider the problem. Western Elec· tric manufactures the switching systems which connect some 60-million Bell telephones throughout the U. S. The average ca:U over today's elecb·omechanical system requires 420 relay operations. All together, this intercon· necting equipment makes up the heart of what is, in effect, the world's largest machine. That's where Western Electric and you come in. The switcWng equipment for this \machine\ involves an enormous manufactur- ing job carried on by our plants throughout the country. Because of the size and service requirements involved, we require quality standards far exceeding those of ordinary manufacturing. The size of this job presents an unusual challenge to the engineer who may save the Bell System many thousands of dollars by even a small cost-reduction step. While to day's switching calls .for a priority on engineering, tomorrow's will be even more exciting. For even now the revolutionary Elec- tronic Central Office is under fieiJ trial and promises to remake the world of telephony. Future Western Electric engineers, working closely with their counterparts at Be11 Tele- phone Laboratories, will concentrate heavily on developing manufacturing methods for this ECO equipment. Your Western Electric assignments may cover many of our other responsibilities as the woi-ld's leading comintn:iications manu- facturer. Perhaps you'll work on advances in microwave transmission, or even on satellite communications. Joining Western Electric may well be your right connection. Opporlunities exist for electrical, mechanical, indus- trial, civil and chemical engineers, as well as physical science, liberal arts,. and business majors. All qualified applicants will receive consideration far employment Without regard to race, creed, color, or national origin.

News ·Editor ....................... , .. Feature Editor The Lean Years ln place of the now defunct chapel credit system, the college instituted a system of ten Convocations per sem- ester. These convocations, both lectures and concErts, are scheduled each year by the Lectures and Concerts Com- mittee, a joint student-faculty venture. The Committee, however, is limited in its planning to a budget which is grossly inadequate for a campus of this size and calibre. At the present moment, the committee must schedule eight lectures for the coming year from a budget of $700. In selecting speakers, the committee has found several different types available for collegiate audiences. First, there is the lecturer who receives no honorarium: this catagory might include members of the Kennedy admin- istration. Next, one finds the professional speaker who normally is contracted through an agency. His fee is somewhere near $1500, a price which Union could never meet. Then there is the good academic speaker, who re- ceives a fee between $200 and $500. The committeE is only able to afford two people in this classification each year. The rest of Union's speakers are those who are neither pro- fessional nor particulariy good. The only other way the campus is able td hear a worthwhile lecture is if the guest happens to be in town for another engagement and kindly consents to deliver a short speech in conjunction with his visit, or if he is contracted for a specially endowed address, such as the Brackett Lecture. If the Committee's budget could be increased, they undoubtedly would be able to schedule more than two good lecturers each year. Then, not only would the program be more stimulating intellectually to the student body, but more of the well known speakers would be attractEd to- ward becoming part of a high quality series such as this. Closely related to improving the quality of visitors, would also be improving college prestige. -- Funds for the committee currently are appropriated by the administration. Requests by the committee to in- crease their budget have been met by answers that there is presently no place where money is available. We sug- gest that if the administration is not able to take action, the students do. Last Tuesday evening, the Student Coun\\ cil voted to raise the Student Activities fee from $11 to $13 per semester. With this inrrease of $4 per student each year. we strongly urge the Tax Committee to allocate $1 per student to the Lectures and Concerts Committee to help them improve the program for succeeding years. Furthermore, we firmly believe that the prime responsi- bility for providing a stimulating lecture series lies with the Trustees. Therefore, we suggest they seriously con- sider reapportioning their funds or finding an outside source of revenue which will shoulder their proper respon- sibility. The Party's Over \''he Student Council's Committee on the Development Program submitted their final report to the Trustees; it is based on a survE.'y, which they supposedly conducted, encompassing the entire student body. The recommenda- tions which the report contains (see page 1 ~ were repre- sented as a composite of these results. !'he report, however, h;; not representative of Union College ~tu('lf\nt~. Th(> fl~mpling of thoR€' questioned is in- CI.HHI,-)lt!le. A ~urvey which the Concord~ condu-ded re- vealed that only six of the fraternity houses on camp-us were consulted, nine definitely were not reached, and two were unsure. The Student Council should be a responsible group which represents the student body. Clearly, in this case, that responsibility has been misplaced. The Council and its leadership are at fault and should be censured. If the Council continues to operate in an irresponsible manner next year, . we feel that the selection system should be modified, to insure election on ability rather than on popularity. To 'fhe Class of ~61 !'he Concordiensis would like to take this opportunity to offer· its congratulations to the graduating class of 1961. We are confident your future accomplishments will be a credit to Union.

His extensive writ- ings, however, are limited to a rather small reading . public in America. At Union, his :!!laster- piece, Man~s Fate, one of the ma- .jor literary contributions of the century, is only on the reading list of the evening course in the Novel. One of the his earlier novels, The Royal Way, written in 1930, con- veys the basic tragic mood that is characteristic of all the author's work. In it, many of the funda- mentai problems in the literature of the last three decades are fore- shadowed. On reading this short nqvel, one may be particularly surprised by the extreme similar- ity between its central themes and those of the late Albert Cam• us' much mor·e well-known work, The Stranger, written a full dozen years later. Malraux once said, \Between the ages of eighteen and twenty, life is like a market where one buys values, not with money but with acts. The majority of men do not buy anything.\ The story of The Royal Way is con<!erned with a young man who leaves be- hind him the monotonous futility of European civilization for an adventurous life of action in the jungles of Cambodia in search of the deserted temples . of an ancient and once flourishing culture. On his journey, he meets Perken, an aging Danish adventurer under whose influence he falls. Perken too has a mission: to find a rival adventuret· who had long before abandoned the rest of humanity and lost himself in the jungle. The novel is the account of what hap- pens to the two men in this iso- lated world of vast tropical for- ests, swarming insect hordes, and barbaric tribal warriors. Though both reach their goal, their plans end ultimately in complete fail- ure. Perken falls on a poisoned sp1 {e, an • as t e young man his middle age pitted , against the looks on helplessly, he dies a slow:, progi'essive forces of his wife, · painful death from the horrible his children, and the world in infectious decay of gangrene. general.

Every choice he makes is ruled by the fear of his own wealmess; thus, he invariably chooses the course which will show that his decline has not yet begun. But Perken is overwhelmed by the sense that all choices are hollow and all victories empty, and that whatever he might accomplish would be swallowed up by the last inescapable rlefeat of death.

It depicts a d~mon­ stration, supposedly Communist insph·ed, by students protesting a meeting of the House Un-Ameri- can Activities Committees. Many of the students were arrested and subsequently acquitted when the actual facts came out in the court hearings. The following article is circulated in the 1\[ay 4, 1961 press release of the University Press service of which Concordy is a member. The University of California student accused of inciting last spring's demonstrations against the House Committee on Un- American Activities was found \not guilty\ by a San Francisco Superior Court jury late Wednes- day. The acquittal represents a ma- jor victory for student and adult groups throughout the country who have long insisted that both the Un-American Activities Com- mittee and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover have presep.ted distorted acc-ounts of the student protest. The trial of student Robert Meisenbach lasted slightly less than two weeks. The prosecution called three witnesses, induding the officer whom Meisenbach was alleged to have beaten. All thre~ of the witnesses, however, pre. sented contradictory accounts of thE' inrirlent. During final argu- ment~. DE-fense Council Chai·les Garry charged they had commit- ted \deliberabi perjury.'' Defense witnesses insisted not only that Meisenbach did not at- tacit the police officer, but that he had been brutally assaulted ,by law officers on the scene. Sixty-four California students were a!'l'ested in San Francisco last May 13, following a student. demonstration against the Un- American Activities Committee, which was then holding hearings in that city. All but Meisenbach were released within a few days. 'fhe jury, out for less than three hours, returned its acquittal saying that it had not been im- pressed with the divergent testi- mony of the prosecution wit- nesses. Some jurors said after- wards that their verdict was not. intended to condone the student. actions, nor was it intended to of- fer any cqmment . on the issue of the Committee's work. The Superior Court decision is particularly relevant to the cur- rent controversy over the Com- mittee-produced film \Operation Abolition\ which insists, in its sound track, \ ...

The fact is, however, that the demonstrators were almost en- tirely students who were peace- fully though noisily, protesting what they believed to have been the committee's unfair and un- -constitutional conduct and its re- fusal to admit them to the hear- ing room packed with friends of the committee. . The only violence shown in the film is that of the police in eject- ing many of the protesters from the Ctiy Hall. But every one of the sixty-four who were arrested .by the police has since been found innocent of wrongdoing by the courts.
