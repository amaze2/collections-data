The new design came from a study of . the growth of the college, its future plans, and its pres- ent needs. Also approved was the establishment of a Cur- ricular Affairs Committee which worked throughout the summer. The new desig-n provides for the creation of the post of Camp- trolled to assist in the financial management of the college. The Dean of the Faculty, Dr. Theo- dore Lockwood, will be given the title of Provost and will assume grevter control over the internal affairs of the college. The Presi- dent of the college will thereby be better enabled to fulfill his duties as the chief executive of- ficer and to represent the college . to alumni and the public.

Provisions in the foundation's original charter called for the dissolution of the corporation by 1964. Established in 1941 under terms of the will of the late Arthur Curtis James, the James Foundatiop had previ- ously awarded forty-two million dollars in gifts. Third Large Grant Union has already received two grants from the foundation. The first was a gift of fifty thousand dollars for use in building Schaf- fel' Library, compltted in 1961. The other, for the same amount, will be usPd in building the new humanities center, which is now in the planning stages. The Ford foundation has given the largest single grant to the college. This was a gift of $960,- 000 in 1956 and was also used to support faculty salaries. James Was Tycoon House Standings Are Announced Union College students return- ed to the college last week to find that last year's All Men's index was only a shade higher than the All Fraternity index, in- stead of the usual abyss that sep~ arates the two. The All Men's index stood at 2.422 or only 0.013 higher than the All Fraternity index. This is to be compared to the 0.123 difference recorded in June 1963. Senior Class High As usual the senior class (1964) had the highest collective index in June with a 2.719. The class of 1965 was next with a 2.555, followed by the class of '66 with 2.338. As usual the freshman class ( 1967) finished lowest with 2.209. The June grades repre- sent an increase over the Janu- ary grades for each class except the class of '67.

As our na:tion has in- neased in wealth, however, it has seemingly beg·un to ignore its pioneer past.

There is a great deal of the \spoiled child\ attitude in America today - an attitude which diminishes individual initiative and an attitude which is created 8olely by guaranteed welfare relief. l\loods Friday, September 25, 1964 Pro and Con: Senatorial Race by Alon Jeffrey • ,, .. New York voters will ba faced with a very serious decision this November. Upon the Senatorial race depends not only the represen- tatioll '.Jf New York, but also the political situation which makes the United States unique. Robert Kennedy, in challenging Senator Keat- rng, has made a frontal attack upon the party system which exist in the United States. Kennedy has thus far based his campaign almost solely upon the statement he has used to open many speeches - that he is carrying the torch for his martyred brother. He has made no mention of the type of representation which New York is getting in the Senate, except to congratulate Senator Kenneth Keating on his fine attend- ance record and his excellent stands on the problems confronting the nation. Voters are faced, therefore, with two candidates who es- pouse the same views. Why, then, is this battle of the utmost im- portance? Impact of Campaign The campaign is important :for New Yo~·k and the nation because a Kennedy victory portends the destruction of the type of political parties which have allowed Cong1'ess to debate and vote on their merit, regardless of the official position of the two most important parties. Non-programmatic, non-ideological pai,ties allow such liberal Republican Senators as Javits, Keating, and Kuchel to vote for Ul'ban renewal and urban transit, issues which some of their conservative party colleagues from rural states oppose. Destruction of Party System The blatant attempt of Robert Kennedy, running on his name G 0 I d Water S P. e 'a k S and not on the issues, to destroy the non-ideological nature of Ameri- :\Iedicare Cnnecessa.ry ' can political parties is dangerous.

How- ever, it must be noted that in the original and classical presentations of Hamlet the actors wore, and still wear Elizabethan costumes. Burton as Hamlet In Gielgud's production, Richard Burton is Hamlet and Hamlet is Richard Burton. Burton vividly projects his own personality into the character he is portraying as he infuses the prince with his mvn manner. He is a free and easy Hamlet, but .is at the same time ma- ture and calculating. His performance is sure to be unpopular with those who insist on never deviating- from precedent. It is a bold step to thro·w old gods out the window and invoke new ones from modern surroundings.

In this respect, \Burton's Hamlet\ is indeed a courageous and remarkable work, if not as pffective as the clas!'ical adaptations. Burton is pregnant with talent and his acting skill is the high point in what this writer bPlieves to be truly creative ·masterpiece. Eileen Herlie as Gertrude, Hume Cronyn as a lovable, albeit foolish Polonius, and Linria Marsh as Ophelia each give meaningful and memorable performances. Eleetronovision The mechanisms involved in Electronovision are foreign to this writer, but the effects that it produces are strikingly apparent. The image that is projected into the sct·een is quite similar to a television picture. However, probably by some means of light intensification, the viewer is gl'anted a much greater sense of immediacy with the action than is possible through television. Instead of having to strain to see the movements of actors on a far away platform, Electrono- vision enables one to mor.e readily abso1'b the atmosphere of a theatre production by flashing a hug.e picture onto a movie screen, without detracting from the mood of the proceedings. Moreover, the cinema- tographel' is able to concentrate on many camera angles as well as providing close-up of the performer.s . If one is not .bothered too much by innovation, there seems tn be no reason for not regarding \Burton's Hamlet\ as an inspired ·work of art. The release of other great works of the theatre for popular consumption, via the exciting medium of Electronovhdon. will add a new visto to the American cultural scene.

Assietant Copy Editor ........... Assistant Fl'atures Editor ''Hope Springs Eternal'~ The Union community has undergone many sweeping- chang-es over the summer, and althoug-h the finer details of the new system have yet to be worked out, what has been accomplished is much to the good. For the first time in our memory Union seems not only to have acknowledged the challenges that the growth of higher education present, but to have begun to respond to them. One has the feeling that the future, which was formerly regarded as a threat to entrenched Union tradi- tions, can now be r.egarded as a friendly place offering opportunities for educational growth and improvement. The new Centers for Humanities and Social Studies, and Science and Engineering, are each to have a separate Dean. These people should strengthen and augment the leadership available in academic areas and relieve the Di- vision heads of the necessity of being professional admin- istrators. We are gratified that curriculum examination and re- vision is finally under way in all areas of the college and are pleased that the Trustees have asked the Curricular Affairs Committee to have their final report in by the June meeting. The investigation of the present divisional and major course requirements answers a plea made last year by this paper. AFTER Union decides exactly what kind of general education it wishes to provide and AFTER the new re- quirements are set up, considerations about the best cal- endar to implement the program would be in order. But first the college needs to be clear on its purposes. The changes that havE> been and are being made are not panaceas for all that ails Union. There are many prob- lems that must still be met by the college, such as faculty load, class sizes (which this year have grown out of hand), etc. Also, the new system brings some fresh problems onto the scene such as the possible conflict of authority between the provost and the president, which is already bothering some faculty members. (This will be dealt with in this space at a later time). Though we have seen previous well intentioned \revo- lutionary plans\ such as the Davidson Calendar, fail to materialize, we look forward to the future with a feeling of optimism. We are impressed with the way Dean Lock- wood carefully reviewed the situation here during his first term and are equally impressed with the plans that he and John Haines worked on and subsequently put into effect. By his actions he seems to have demonstrated an aware- ness of what ails Union, of where education is going and most important, of how to ensure Union a prominent place in the future of education. It is largely due to his presence that we feel confident that this time it will be different. Monticello's Gain The loss of John Haines to Monticello College (of which he is now president) , was the most disappointing develop- ment of the summer. At this, a critical time in Union's history, his presence would have been a highly valuable asset. Few people have worked as hard as Mr. Haines to- wards the improvement of the college. We wish him the best of luck at his new post.

That seem~ ed a long time ag·o to me when in 1924 the society presented The Taming of the Shrew. I recall this especially, because as a Sophomore I must have been the only undergraduate considered masculine enough to play the part of Katherine. Of the perform- ance, at a downtown stock .. com- pany theater, I can only say, still with some blushes, that the ex- pensive costumes were hot and heavy.

In 1929, my first year as Direr- tor of the Mountebanks, under President Frank Parker Day and tht'ough the enthusiasm and en- ergy of Milton Enzer, and the late Professor Raymond M. Her- rick of the English Department, Hannah Hall was redesigned to accommodate a campus theatre. Here, and during my period of eleYen years as Director of the Mountebanks, we have not only perfot'med two plays of Ibsen, two of O'Neil, John Howard Payne's Clari and beside Shapespeare's Twelftb ~ight as mentioned in the article, also Hamlet in mod- eJ'l1 dress and Coriolanus in pseu- do Nazi-Facist costumes.I mention this not to criticize Baldassaro's article at all, but for the record nnd in behalf of a considerable number of our alumni who spent lots of time working of Shupe- speare from those who, like me, played female parts because girls were not permitted, as in the time of Shakespeare, to the fortunate ones who later could worship the Huthor along with some accom- plished and attractiYe females. I could equal Professor Kil- l;um'<; chagrin as told in his ar- ticle about the production of Oth- ello, but I shall resist an alum- nus's urge to reminisce when I realize that the period of time be- tween 1905 when the Mountebanks was founded, to 1929 when the campus theatL'e was established, was forgotten then quite as the later period from 1938 to now.And both of these exceed the period of Rip Van Winkle's fabulous sleep. The reason for this communica- tion is not merely to adjust a record, but to support and empha- size Mt·. Baldassaro's conclusion. A college which neglects the pro- duction of Shakespeare's plays, whatever fine plays it may give of Brecht, Albee, Pinter, or Wil- liams, is derelict in its duty to the language.

At the latter he served as Assistant to the President. In 1936 he was picked to become Prexy of Knox Colleg-e, Galesbl.lrg, Ill. It was this position he left in 1946 to succeed Dixon Ryan Fox as Pres- ident of Union Coll€ge. While at London, Davidson has been active in many educational organizations, among them the Carnegie Foundation for the Ad- \'ancement of Teaching, Associa- tion of Urban Universities, and the College Committee on the Disadvantaged. He helped found in 19~ the Empire State Founda- tion of Independent Liberal Arts Colleges and served as its first chairman. To Head College Group The Association of American Colleges is a fifty-year old group of 847 members, including Har- vard, Princeton, and Yale. fhe group's objective is to strengthen liberal education in America. The position he occupies was reor·gan- ized last year to give the Presi- dent considerably wider powers. Among the AAC's previous Presi- dents was Union College President Charles A. Richmond. eled to Raleigh, North Carolina last April to help in votet· regis• tration. One of the students re- C\ently described the trip as beino- quite successf1.1l in terms of th~ original purpose, and also said that it was quite an educational experience as well. This kind of approach-the attempt to aid peo- ple in helping themselves - is widely acknowledged as the best approach, in the campaign for civil rights. It gives those involved more insig·ht with respect to their problems, increases understanding among them, and thus tends to make their future efforts more fruitful. It establishes a firm basis from which to proceed. Past Activities Those students who attended last year's meetings of the Civil Rights Committee were, or be- came, aware of the importance of this approach. Several of them helped for a few hours a week in the activities of the Carver Com- munity Center. Those who tutor- ed students at a jtmior high school in Schenectady, realized the im- portance of creating in the stu- dents the desire to work hard for their own benefit. In addition to helping in voter registration, com- munity work, and tutoring, the Civil Rights Committee sponsored a Dizzy Gillespie concert on cam- pus in order to l'aise money for SNCC. This year the committee is planning to continue its activities in areas such as tutoring. We would also lil{e to give as much support as possible to voter regis- tration in Schenectady, Oct. 1, 2, and 3. Anyone interested in these fields should contact Professor Sherwood Fox in Bailey Hall, Howard Kaufman (407 Rich- mond), or Dan Scu1ly (410 Rich- mond). If you are interested in the ac- tivities of the Civil Rights Com- mittee, be sure to attend the meetings, which will be announc- ed by notices posted a 1 1out the rnmpus.

Howard Kaufman '67 Rocco • • (Continued from Page 1) Last Three Films • The last three films of the se- mester range from the recently acclaimed Freud, to the dynamic All The Kings Men, to the French comic-tragedy Shoot The Piano Player. The classic All The Kings Men tells the story of Willie Stark, a model demagogue and his rise to power through corrup- tion and vice. Shoot The Piano Player is cortsti•ucted like a \gangster\ pictui'e, except that a feeling of ominous tragedy per- vades through an apparently com- ic framework. Starring Susannah York and Montgomery Clift, Freud depicts the five most vital years of the famous Viennese doc- tor. Most movies on the schedule, and La Dolce Vita, not on the original schedule, will be shOW11 on Friday nights at 7 and 9 P.M. in E.E. 22.

Also, Cal- vin Schmidt, now Registrar of the college, will process all pro- grams and course changes with- out the necessity of consulting the Dean of the Faculty. The Curricular Affairs Commit- tee is wm·king in three major areas; the extent and intensity of whatever kind of genera:! edu- cation Union should provide is be- ing studied, particularly with re- spect to the effectiveness of di- visional course requirements. The number of courses required in the major field, along with their re- lationship to other required courses, is also under study. New Calendar Planned The third field of study in- volves the selection of the best, • • • most flexible academic calendar. The trimester, or 10-10-10 plan is being given serious considera~ tion; under it, students would take three courses during each trimester. The flexibility of such a calendar might allow profes- sm·s to spend one term on inde- pendent research. It is felt that the reorganiza- tion of the school and the new calendat• have significant· impli- cations for working out the prob- lems in faculty teaching loads. These problems are being viewed in the light of educational effec- tiveness as well as competition between colleges for qualified faculty. Also under considera- ~ion is the possibility of convert- mg as many lecture courses as possible to informal seminars in order to make education at Un- ion more comprehensive.
