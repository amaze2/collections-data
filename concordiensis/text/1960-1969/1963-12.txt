The comparison breaks down if car- ried too far, but it gives a o·ood picture of the importance ol' the bop movement to jazz today. Bop first gained public attention on 52nd Street, but the seeds were sown uptown at Minton's and Monroe's. Men like Dizzy Giiles- pie, Charlie Christian {who was playing guitar with Benny Good- man at the time), and Thelonious Monk were regular performers at these clubs in the early forties. Devised Variations The story goes that these men and others like Bud Powell, Char- lie and Kenny Clarke, got Krehbiel contain definite indications ·of the turn jazz was about to take. Bop did not come about at any one time and not by the efforts of any one man.. It was rather a development out of and a revolt against the big band style ·of the thirties. Conside1·ed Weird . In its ea1·Jy days, bop was con- Sidered very \far out,\ wierd and at best interesting. Today w~ can see it in perspective as the foun- tainhead of all our modern jazz forms, up to and even including the \new thing\ of Ornette Cole• man and othe!'s. In spite of a ban on recording imposed by the musicians' union, the Bop Revo- lution is very well documented on recordings. Many of these rec- ords are now available on inex- pensive labels.

It's a good tale, but pl'obably n o t any more ac- curate than the Parke1· sud- denly bei.ng struck with the thought of playing his solos us- ing higher intervals of the chords one December evening while jam- ming in a chili joint. Teddy Hill recalls that when Kenny Clarke was in his band in the thirties, he \kept playing those offbeats and little rhythmic tricks on the bass drum. I'd ask him, 'What is that kloop~m:op stuff?' . • • Later on we called it be-bop.\ Dizzy was thrown out of the Cab Cal- loway band after many complaints from Cab about his playing \that Chinese music.\ Charlie Parker's solos on his records with Jay Mc- Shann's Kansas City based band One of these records is the re- lease tmder Dizzy Gillespie's name on the Rondolette or Galaxy label. It may be purchased local- ly for about $1.25. Besides Dizzy this record features work by Charlie Parker, Dexter Gordon, Milt Jackson, and Sonny Stitt. It's quite an all-star package. An- other all-star package is Bar- onet's \Handful of Modern Jazz\ which features Charlie Parker, Dizzy, Miles Davis, Lucky Thomp- son, and AI Haig. Baronet has also released '\l'he Early Bird\ which featmes the Charlie Park- er Quintet with Miles Davis, Duke Jordan, Tommy Pottei', and Max Roach and the Charlie Parker Quartet with Erroll Garner, Red Callendar, and Doc West. Both these records contain classic per- formances from the early bop era and sell for less than $2.00 each. For examples of the jam sessions held at Minton's and Monroe's listen to \1941: Harlem Jazz ' Scene\ with work by Monk, Diz, Plans are well under way for this spring's graduation. The Senior Class is organizing Class Day, and the Admin- istration is probably starting to line up an Honorary Chan- cellor who will deliver the main graduation address. If this year is like those in the past, the Administration will find it quite difficult to find a well-known Honorary Chan- cellor who does not have other commitments on Gradua- tion Day. We suggest that a new approach be employed in selecting a graduation speaker. The Senior Class, since they are the ones who will be primarily exposed to the Honorary Chancellor, should have a voice in determining who he will be. We suggest that at a meeting the Senior Class draw up a list of ten persons they would like ot hear at graduation. The president of the college, upon receiv- ing the list, would contact the first person on it and would proceed down the list until he found someone willing to serve as Honorary Chancellor. If none of the ten .could find time to give the speech, the President could still ar- range for a speaker much in the manner he does now. There are two main advantages to selecting an Honor- ary Chancellor in this manner. First, the Senior Class would be able to better guarantee a speaker who was known to most of them and whom they would be inter- ested in hearing. Second, most speakers will be more likely to accept an invitation if they realize that the graduating class wants to hear them than if they know the invitation came about as the result of a decision by a few members of the administration andjor trustees. If the system works effectively, it could be expanded so that the position of Honorary Chancellor would assume the status that the Rector has at St. Andrews, our brother school in Scotland. There, the entire student body, with much ceremony and hilarity, elects a Rector who repre- sents the students in the inner councils of the University. Although the position is largely honorary, the Rector will sometimes carry a particular grievance of the students to the Administration. Some of the most eminent men in Britain have served as Rector, Sir Charles Snow having served last year, for example. The Honorary Chancellor could assume the same function here at Union. The Absent Audience Those who attended the concert by the Union-Skid- more Orchestra last Tuesday night will agree that the orchestra performed very capably. We thank the Admis- sions Department for admitting such competent musicians. Now, if they could only find some students who would have been interested enough to attend the concert. Clarification Needed The controversy concerning the bookstore has died down somewhat, probably only to flare up as soon as stu- dents have to buy their textbooks for the second semester. Much confusion still remains concerning the financial standing of the bookstore and where the profits, if any, go. We suggest that the financial statement of the bookstore from last year be released to the student body and per- haps be printed in Concordiensis. A similar controversy has recently arisen at Wesleyan and in an attempt to in- form the students of the true conditions of the bookstore an article appeared in the Wesleyan Argus detailing ex- actly how the bookstore operates along with a financial statement of the 'bookstore from last year. We see no reason why a similar course should not be followed at Union. It would seem most polite to just fo1·get that the art shew which. now exists in Old Chapel and m the N ott Memorial is eve!\ was, or will be. But yes' tl . . ' , 1ere are pamtmgs there, and yes, we really should say some- thing about them. . S~: Robert Nunnelly's \paint- mgs are absolutely conventional within what we now recog-nize as the New York School of Abstract Expressionism; what he is doing now was, twenty years ag-o, new and outstanding as orig-inal form and idea. Now it seems overdone somewhat tired, and in Mr. Nun~ ne!ly's case, well illustrative of a final stage in the history of a dying art movement. Still what is most objectionable in this show is not its form or medium. It is the complete lack of creativity or spontaneity within the form. It is basically boring; that is vvhy it is difficult to accept this show as art. tain depth of feeling, a combina- tion of colours and forms and a basic emotion. ' All these are lacking in the Nunnelly show. It is difficult to summate a show of this sort this one particularly, though h:U.dly because it is so basically blog- ness', because it i~ sterile, lying dead, flat, and unmteresting. . Gr~sping at any e:xcuse to dis- tmgmsh one work from another some viewers have noted that th~ sl:w.w. se~ms characterized by a dJvJswn m form, half being no- tabl.e for a direction which is horizontal, composed of works whos~ basic lines run from left to ~1ght, t~e other half being v~rtrc~l, havmg an up and down (hrectwn. This distinction unfor- ~unately pales when we soon real- Jze that the two are interchange- able, depe~ding solely upon the corner wh1ch Mr. Nunnelly has chosen for his signature. The wor~s ranging in the N ott Me- ;norial are larger than the ones (Continued on Page 6) ,..-.rry-r ..- Y'T\v T v T f f f Y T ¥ Y ¥ f f T T T ¥ ¥ ¥ 't ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ f v ¥ f T f T Y T Y Y f T '~ DIAMANTE'S Enjoy our Fine Home Cooked ltolian Food in Our Comfortable Dining Room OPP.

Gerald's work here consists of writing, testing and documenting computer programs - each one a different and exacting assignment. Also of great .interest to Gerald when he joined Western were the Company's numerous manage- ment courses and paid Tuition Refund Plan. He knows, too, that we'll need to fill thousands of su- pervisory positions within the next few years. And he's getting the solid experience needed to qualify. Right now, Gerald is working on a verification sub-system for maintaining production control. It consists of seven distinct computer programs that operate as one routine which performs the func· tion of tying together and verifying forecasted with actual customer orders. If you, like Gerald Bourland, set the highest standards for yourself, enjoy a challenge, and have the qualifications we're looking for -let's talk! Opportunities for fast-moving careers exist now for liberal arts, physical science and business majors, as well as for electrical, mechanical and industrial engineers.

Out of the~e stt·eams has come the greatest body of poets, play- wrights, novelists, and essayists that any section in the country has ever given forth.

Mr. White, whose initials stand •·--·---- -- -~-- --- --·\ for Terence Hanbury, has never 1 tried to play the l'O~e. of the sed.a~e Orchestra authOl'. Born of BntJsh parents 1n India, he went to Cheltenham Col- lege and Oxford. He says: \I like doing things, and I do them for their own sake, not for 'copy'. I do try to verify and master my statements like a scholar-i.e. be- fore saying that a knight in ar- ' mour was like a deep-sea diver, I had been down in the old-fash- ioned diving suit.\ His topic will he \The Pleasures of Learning.'' He states that it is \mostly about myself.\ \Luminous Fantasy\ Many well-known critics have praised his Wl'iting skill. Orville Prescott of the New York Times said of The Sword in The S'to)le that it is \a luminous fantasy and wild farce about Arthurian Eng- , \and, one of the few incontestable masterpieces of recent years.\ He was described in the Times of London as follows: \In three · fieltls of writing he particularly excells: he can draw living peo- ple; he can describe a landscape; and he can enter into the inner- ' most minds of birds and beasts.'' It is for talents such as these that he is considered one of the foremost living authors. Mr. White will talk with all in- terested students during the aft- ernoon in Hale House. To Join In Recital The Skidmore-Union Orchestra will open its second season on Tuesday evening at 8:30 P.M.\ in the Nott Memorial Auditor- ium. The concert will include· selections f1·om Vaughn Williams, Haydn and Handel. The orchestra is made up of over forty members who have been chosen from the best instru- mental talent at ·Skidmore and Union. The directors are Edgar Curtis and Francis Carver, pro- fessors of music at Union and Skidmore 1•espectively. Curtis and Carver have been alternating rehearsal sessions with the or- chestra~both men working with and conducting their own reper- toires. Brass and Woodwinds to Star In addition to the Skidmore- Union Orchestra, the Union Brass Choir and the Woodwind Quintet will play in the concert this Tues- day. The Woodwind Quintet, an , Federalists Feature Isley I ensemble recently organized by Mark Russo, will present the Di- vertimento No. 1 in B flat by Josef Haydn.

Isely is the Secretary Gen- eral of the World Committee of W m·ld Constitutional Convention. His topic will be how his organi- zation is attempting to achieve world government. Platform P1·esented Among the plans of the WCC are a world convention by 1965 eunsisting of an assembly of ap- pointed national delegates and a . second assembly of elected peo- . pies' delegates. A preparatory congress was held in September, 1963. To date, supporters of the world committee include: Attlee and Boyd-Orr of Britain, Faure of France, Niemoller and Max Born of Germany, Brock Chis- holm of Canada, Sparling, Mar- ,, tin Luther King, Sorokin, Rep. Multer and Stringfellow Barr of the L'nited States, the Prime Min- istet·s of Pakistan and Sierra Le- one, the President of Costa Rica and Queen Elizabeth of Belgium.

I see httle of more im 1 )ortance to om· country than full vecogn1t1on of the })lace of the artist.\ JOH:.--1 F. KE::-.!~EDY. It is an established fact that an important part of one's college education is acquired outside the classroom. The Student should and must, in his four years at Union, be exposed to the various expressions of the arts. Th~s includes the theatre, music of all types, modern and classi- cal forms of painting, motion pictures, etc. Facilities for the expression of these media, which could form the very heart of a college campus, are simply inadequate at Union. Tonight \Ballad of a Soldier,\ winner of the 1961 San Francisco Film Festival and the Cannes Film Festival, will be shown in EE 22. This ball, the only technically feasible place to show the film on campus, can't possibly accommodate all who wish to see it. The seating is uncomfortable, temperature conditions are impossible to control, and the hall is generally a liability to the best of films. In the last issue af Concordy it was pointed out that due to a lack of careful planning for the future, the dormi- tories on this campus were outmoded practically before they were finished. The same might be said of Memorial Field House. Although hindsight is considerably better than foresight, it seems to us that as long as the job was being done, a structure similar to R.P.I.'s field house would have been of considerably more value to the college. Al- though building costs would have been higher, the revenues obtained from renting it out to various Schenectady or- ganizations would have soon made up the deficit. In addi- tion it would have set up a cultural center for the whole Schenectady area, a center that would be in reach of every Union student, as well as being a source of revenue for the college. As it now stands, the field house (although admittedly due in part to the contractor•s negligence), is of little use except as a showcase for the second longest laminated beams in the world. One of the things that will most be missed about the late President is the climate of optimism and self-co·nfi- dence he brought to the nation. Contrast this with the general level of morale in the country in the last years of his predecessor's administration and you get an idea of the importance of creating a favorable climate in which to WO·rk. The same is true of a college campus. Here they who determine the policy of a school play an important role. They can create a favorable climate simply by letting the students and faculty know that they are concerned about them and that both their interests actually form a common interest. This is done in little ways - like putting the finishing touches on a theatre that could have been and can still be truly magnificent, instead of compromising at the final stage, making concessions grudgingly and not completing construction until the night before the per- formance. The Concm•dy has been arguing for years for a stu- dent Union. Such a building could serve as a movie house, art showcase and generally help to create a more favorable atmosphere on the campus. Union students must be given a chance to be more fully exposed to the arts during their stay here. Many will never get another chance. L.H. BOOKS TORE.

Friday, December 6, 1963 History Of Jazz: Swing Street Ey Tom On the cover of the book ac- companying Epic Records' recent set of reissued :performances from the swillg era is a photog1•aph of' the clubs on 52nd Street in New York City. On the marquees one can make out the names of Billy Eckstine, Jack Teagal'den,. Cole- man Hawkins, and Dizzy Gilles- pie. AU were appearing\ at dubs not more than one or two, doors apart. The names of the clubs are famous ,jn their own right too: The ·Onyx:, Three Deuces, .Timmy Ryan's, Club Downbeat. In the thirties and early forties 52nd Street was the mainline of jazz in New York, and 'therefore the mainline of jazz in the world. Lineups of musicians like that above were the 1·ule rather than the exception. Fifty-Second Street's jazz life began during Prohibition when many of the old brownstones housed Musicians often stopped by to talk, drink, a n d sometimes to play. When Repeal came in 1933 the speak- easies became clubs. The Onyx m o v e d across the street from its former loca- tion and the Fa- mous Door, Leon 21, and 18 op- ened up. In everything op- ened up. Wilder Hobson wrote: Krehbiel s: n~et set mentioned above (SN 6042). The set contains four LPs compl'ising sixty four sides orig- inally issued by Columbia, Bruns- wick, V ocalion, Okeh, and others during the heyday of 52nd Street. The set coxers the music from Teddy Bunn's Spirits of Rhythm to Dizzy Gillespie. Some of the select;ons are better jazz than others, but aU are good music. I find the first LP the most consist- ently high in quality. Eddie Con- don's recording of \The Eel\ fea- turing Bud F1·eeman's tenor is a gem, as is \We've G9t the Blues\ by the Spirits of Rhythm. It is also a pleasure to hear Stuff Smith ,fiddling away on two tunes. Jonah Jones is featured on the Stuff Smith sides playing the antithesis of the \muted jazz\ style he has adopted today. He wails! Other volumes feature Count Basie, Fats Waller, Billie Holi- day, Hot Lips Page, John Kirby, Art Tatum, Frankie Newton, Ted- dy Wilson, Bunny Berigan, J-ack Teagarden, and enough others to make this set as complete a rep- resentation of the 52nd Street scene as possible, and a good basic jazz collection in itself.

White Tells Of'Nevv Renaissance' Pleas For Support Mr. Isely also included a plea fot· financial su:pport. \Since we are not a tax-exempt organiza- tion, we are hoping that each per- son who signs a petition will make a contribution.\ Tliis, he explain- ed, would cover the expenses in- curred by delegates in traveling to the com·ention and in persuad- ing governments to ratify the world constitution once it has been written. By Barry Newman and AI Nahmias T. H. White, lecturer, poet, writer, and philosopher, spoke on the pleasures of life and the joys and importance of learning, at Tuesday's convocation. Professor Patrick Kilburn of the Department of English introduced him as, \a man of courage, enthusiasm, and curiosity to experience and learn.\ T. H. WliiTE Brttnches Scheduled By !\lark Kazowitz The class of 1967, in ordet• to solve the pet•ennial problem of Sunday meals, has instituted brunches on Sunday mornings. Beginning as a campaign pledge of presidential candidate, Lind- ley Parker, the idea was retained by the eventual winner, Ray Pika. The first brunch was held on the weekend before the Thanks- giving recess, although admit- tedly under experimental condi- tions. :Restricted to cold cereal, cocoa. doughnuts, coffee, and other unprepared foods, the meal proved very successful with 140 students taking part. White mentioned that in his travels and lectures at 35 colleges and universities in the U. S. he noticed what he calls a \new renaissance.\ This \new renais- sance\ of culture is characterized by the spending of large sums of money on cultural centers, librar- ies, bowling alleys, and swimming pools. In all of these, some type of learning can take place. He compared the U. S. millionaires who contribute to cultural facili- ties to the Medici of Renaissance Italy who became patrons of the arts. White mentioned that it made very little difference to him how these millionnaires amassed their fortunes, as long as they left a large portion of it to the arts. Subject Unimportant Mr. White also expounded upon his theory that learning how to swim can be as useful as learn- ing how to use a library. The fact that one is learning is the impor- tant element. The subject one is learning is of very little conse- quence, :providing that it adds to one's personal enjoyment of life. Mr. White told of his brief as- sociation with the Welsh actor Richard Burton and made several comparisons between his life and Burton's. Both he and Burton had had family crises during their childhoods and this, rather than destroying them, pr·ovided them with the incentive to achieve in their respective fields. White, who had been unprepared for his personal m·isis, was \handed the poison cup too soon.\ As an anti- dote for future crises, he decided to learn as much as possible in many different fields, in order to be prepared to any future dis- turbance in his life. Knowledge from Expe1ience YmasCarolin~ Union- Skidmore Join In Concert Success Yields Expansion On December 8 the menu was expanded to include French toast. The response expanded to 175 students, who were attracted by both the food and the low prices, which the Freshmen offered. Hop- ing to keep the interest in such an idea high, Pike announced that bacon and eggs will be served this Sunday. This was the beginning of White's 1·espect for learning, Real knowledge, however, cannot be found in books. According to White, a man can read a great many books on golf, but he will never be a good golfer unless he picks up a, golf club. Only in ex- periencing life can man truly learn. Opens Holiday This Sunday at 4:30 P.M. a. r>oncert will be presented in the Memorial Cha:pel. Performing in this concert will be the Union· College Brass Ensemble and Glee Club and the Russell Sage Glee Club. The Brass Ensemble will be conducted by Professor Edg·ar Curtis. The Union College Glee Club will be led by Professor Hugh Allen Wilson, and the Rus- sell Sage Glee Club will be con- . ducted by Mrs. Angela Fitzpat- . rick. In the evening at 7:30 P.M. . there will be a community carol ! sing also in the Memorial Chapel. This will be led by Dr. Elmer Tidmarsh, Professor Emeritus of . Music, who is the traditional con- i cluctor of this sing. Both of these 1 concerts will be open to the pub- lic. The concert and carol sing have become almost traditional · at Union, and they will probably he attended by :president David- son and many of the faculty families. In the past many peo- ple from the community have at- tended. The organist at the afternoon session will be Helen Henshaw, and the pianist will be Carmella Stenco. In the evening the or- ganist will be H. Wellington Stuart. Brass Ensemble Prices which have been set up ·are: milk, $.10 for the first glass and $.05 for each additional glass; · coffee, $.10 for an unlimited amount; doughnuts and sweet- rolls, $.<l8 a piece Ol' two for $.15; cold cet•eal, $.15; and French toast, $.10 a slice. The brunch is run completely by the Freshman Class, includ- ing cooking, ordering, and dish washing. The Saga Food Service makes all food available at cost prices, as well as allowing the Freshmen the complete unre- stricted use of the kitchen and dining 1•oom facilities, The food is cooked by a Freshman, who also cooks breakfast during the week. Pike estimates that be- tween six and nine students have helped out with the brunch, al- though with au expanded menu, (Continued on Page 4) White then told of several of the rewards to be gained from learning. Among these was the discovery of truth. He cited the example of the satisfaction de- rived from jigsaw puzzles. The person doing the :puzzle puts two pieces of the puzzle together and says, \they fit, it is true.\ Learning is Power Power is another pleasure of learning. White said that if he knew how to hit a golf ball so that it would always go into the hole, the other golfers would be afraid to play against him. This, combined with the money he would win from tournaments would give him powe1·. Lasting interest is another im- portant facet of learning. An old man, confined to a wheel chair, still has the knowledge he has gained throughout life. He can gain satisfaction solely by think- ing of this know ledge. Knowledge is Satisfying Ego gratification is a very im- portant as}Hlct of learning. Know- ing that you can do something well is very satisfying.
