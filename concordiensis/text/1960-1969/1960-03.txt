The shortage of qualified college teachers is one of the most crit- ical problems facing American education today. It is estimated that 3>0,00() new college teachers will be needed each year during the next decade to take care of the tidal· wave of college students expected in the sixtie,s. The Wood- row Wilson Fellowship Program was established in 1945 to recruit promising students for the college teaching· professicm and to suppo.rt them during their first year of graduate study. In 1957 the Pro- gram teceived a $24,500,00() grant from the Ford Foundation to in- crease the scope of its operations and to intensify its search for col- lege teachers.

To draW' a bad analogy, the film might he said to b.e a non-Holly- wood Farewell to A.rms. The lov- ers-in this case Cora, the beau- tiful French espionage agent and Bernard, the reluctant German army captain-are inextt-icably caught up in a complex war situ- ation~secret rock!ets, trenchcoats and air-raids supplying the neces- sary realism. Both, of course, suf- fer from a conflict of loyalties; and their love, which is unconvin- cing :from the first, moves tenu- ously along with the vicissitudes of the war. To continue the an- alogy, unlike Hemil)gway's lovers, who sail aW'ay to bli:ss and obscur- ity, they are cruelly- dealt with in the blaze of tragic irony that closes the picture. The paucity of dialogue is more· than made u,p. for by the constant flow of action: a factory is blown up, a machine gun fight is held in the woods at midnight (without AI •Capone), a covereq truck speeds· surreptitiously along a lonely French htgnway. All the in- gi·edients of the ba.ttered France of 1943 are present-even the little French boy facing the German miiitary propaganda. 'poster. !ndia' s \Middle Way\ Great Decisions --- 1960 By Pratap M. Rakshminarsu This Is anrt>ther in a seii.es of artl,eles relating to . the Great Decisions discussions held every Friday under the auspices otf the International Rel.ations Club. This week~s topic was \What Clhances, India's Middle Road?\ Mr. Ral{- sfuninarsn was last year's indian exolut.nge student, a.Il.d is current- ly residing- in Schenec1;ady. Much attention has been fo<!used recent·ly on India. The shocking epents of neighboring Tibet, fol- lowed by the aggressive acts of China in occupying latrge portions of Indtan tenitory has had a very disquieting effect on 'the rest of Asia in particular, and the free world in general. The recent visits of President Eisenhower, Chairman Khruschev and the forthcomipg visit of Premier Chou-En-Lai are keeping India constantly in the news. All this when viewed against the back- ground of Indian foreign policy of neutrality raises the questioil of ·this article, \What Chances, India's M·iddle Road?\ Severacl other nations of Asia and Mrica now emerging from colonial states have adopted mid- dle of the road foreign policies, and it would a:ppea:r that neu- tralism is gaining ground. The classical American al\gum~nt that \if one is not on our side, he must be agin us,\ becomes an inade- quate concept A world in which two groups of powerful nations stand .poised to blow themselves and the rest of the world out of existence, now seems modifie<l to include a third group of nations, committed to neither side and· desirous of living in peace, and benefitting from the :technological developments of both. 'l'liere are several r·ea;sons for India, being a prominent member of this third bloc, to follow this policy. The predominant reason is that lnd,ia does not wish to be a party to any atomic halocalist. The leaders of India are well awil:r'e of the great backwardness of their country technologically, and are strainil;tg their efforts to make one great leap forward to bring living stands up to decent levels. A stable and peaceful world is a prime ·requisite for ac- complishing this~ Another strong factor is that the basic pb.ilosophy or the aver- age Indian is neutralistic~ Indian history is rife with nuroerbus in- vasions and assaults ·On her bor- ders from the times of Alexan- der to that of the British. But India has absorbed and assimil- ated the effects of these military and cultura'l insertions and made them part of her own culture. As a result the Indian has learned to live and let live. The future of India's policy of n:on-involvment is very difficult to predict now. It is reasonable to assume, however, that Premier Chou-En,Lai's forthcoming visit will be an important milestone in India'S foreign policy. The Prem- ier is doing what no other leader of modern China has ever done before. He is leaving the safety of his borders to negotiate a very (Continued on Page 4l 1111111111111111~ Ill I IU Ill U 1111111111 IIIII 1111 IIIII I Ill I I 11111111111 I 11111111111'1~11 Dill IIIII THE RINGrS THE THING Now on Sale at The Book Store Pric:e $33.00 Including Tax rl I II Ill IIIII~IIBIII Ill 1111111:1111111 ~I 1111111 II Ill It I I Ill 11111111111111111111 1111111a 1111 11111111 ·------------------~-------· S C 0 T I A NOW THRU WED.

Members of the panel were, in addition to Baker, President Car- ter Davidson, Professor .Joseph Finkelstein, and Student Body President Edward Ruth. Finklestein Pessimistic Professor Baker was comment- ing on a statement by Professor Finkelstein that student conduct and interests as of late had been growing worse. Professor Finkel- stein believes that \the students generally are not happy, and the faculty is concerned as a result. But we cannot force changes upon students; instead, internal per- sonal changes must occur.\ The possibility of converting the old library into a fine arts center was brought up. President David- son said that the· Trustees are studying pro·posals along this line issued by the art department and a committee of interested students but that expense could be an im- portant factor. \In some cases it might be easier to erect a new building rather than remodel the old one,\ he observed. Also brought up was the remote possibility of a student union. President Davidson felt that if this were attempted at all it would be better to work on •Old Chapel, since the Rathskeller is in the same building, and the conversion of the high-ceilinged library for this purpose would be somewhat impractical. which will house Art Lawrence Received Enthusiastic Reviews and his family. and several stu- The Quartet's triumphal 1958 dents.

MAX ROACH One week from this Sat- urday, March 19, at 8:30 the Modern Jazz Society of Union College will present the Max Roach Quintet in concert. Memorial Chapel will resonate for the first time to the subtle and rhyth- mic sounds of one of the world's greatest jazz drum- mers and his group. Having only recently returned from a tour of Europe with a completely new organization, Max Roach will arrive on campus primed for an .in- spiring and timely concert. The present quintet is the lat- est in a long and outstanding list of sidemen which reads Uke a Whos' Who 'Of the great names in the world of jazz. Kenny Der- ham, Hank Mobley, Ramsey Lew- is, Clifford Brown, Richie Powell, and Sonny Rollins all made their debut or advanced their careers considerably through an associa- tion with the Max Roach combos which have flashed across the jazz scene in the last ten years. Max Roa<}h concluded one as- pect of his schooling in 1942. That same year he began a quest f()r knowledge that has motivated him to date. It has been a re- warding quest for Roach and for those who have followed his mu- sic. At seventeen years of age Roach finished his formal educa- tion and entered into the realm Morrison Proposes Morrison proposed, \Whereas: There are fundamental rights of law and justice that must jlrevail in all human relations, and w'bere- as; the non-violent constructive action of students protesting un- fair and discriminatory .practices is being unjustly suppressed throughout the South, and partic- ularly in Nashville, Tennessee, and further, Whereas; the strug- gle of these students is a struggle in which the whole nation is in- volved, therefore, be it Eesolved; that the Union College Student Council, realizing the need for a greater understanding of the total problem of human relations in the South, endorses the policy set forth by the United States Na- tional Student Association sup- . porting the right of Aznerican students to engage in non-violent pro.test of unfair discriminatory practices, and further be it Re- solved; that this same Student Council communicate to the prop- er government officials a state- ment of pre>test concerning the recent unjust arrests of students who have remained pns.sive in their response to the legal in- equities to which they hava been subjected.\ Is Passed Unanimously The motion was passed unanim- ously and it was further decided to send telegrams to Senators Gore and Kefauvet•, anr:l Mayor West, which would explain the Council's stand on the isslle. The telegrams stated, \In a reso- lution of March 8th, the Union College Student Council, repre- senting 1,000 st11dents l!a:s ex- pressed its concern over the flag- rant miscarriage of justice re- cently perpetrated by the .lnunicl- pal authorities of Nashville, Ten- nessee, against the students par- ticipating in non-violent demon- strations; and In view of the im- plications of such mis=rriages urges that the normal conduct of justice be immediately restored and faithfully adhered to.

An Awakening Council The initative shown by the Student <;:ouncil at its Tuesday meeting in drafting. a protest ~gamst Southern police methods dm·ing the s1t-down stnkes was a con;-- mendably significant. if unusual, exaJ?ple of l;~w'an aled ~tudent go\·ernment arose from tra~htlon~l d1smteres_t to take a firm and vocal stand on a natwnal1ssue. The tlme- 1;. and posith·e protest was startling: evidence tha~ at leas~ some students have been able to p1erce the Ivory Towei of campus lethargy and support the principles of law and justice. Tuesday night's laudable pt·ecedent should serve to encourao·e futme student governments to support the loft,\· principles of democratic action both on and off the College campus. . . . However as sugo-ested in a Concordiensts ed1torm.! last week. an' even st;onger stand might have ~een made against bigotry and int_oleyance ~ad the. Council also n:,- solved to support the prmciple of mtegratw? f?r a~l Amer- icans, a clause which was conspicuously m1ssmg m TueR- rlav's motion. · Another area in which the Council pro~ises to sc~re praiseworthy gains was revealed when Pr~s1dent Ruth m- formed the Council of a p1·oposed change m the f\.ss~mhly program. Vigorously supported by the Concot:dtensis fe>r manv vears the tentative program would be armed at _re- ducing. both' the number and the anxiety of accumulatmg Assembly credits. l\s a final act at one of this year's most positive Cou~cil meetings, a committee was formed to investiga~e what was termed \excessive\ traffic fines and the possl- bilitv of a student run traffic court. Student imposed dis- cipline for ·student lawlessness is a well est9:blished trad i- t ion at \Cnion. Traffic fines, however, remam as the lone area in which the undergraduate is entirely at the mercy of arbitrarv and very often unjust, administration action. It is hoped' that the new 'Traffic Committee will '?ork eonscientiously in an effort to strengthen student-admmls- tration relations on this long neglected problem. Building for the Future The tentative plans of a student-faculty committee for the proposed conversion of Nott Memorial Libra~y . into a Fine Arts Center appears to be a further step 1n the much heralded \intellectual renaissance\ which has embraced Union with encouraging, if sometimes unsteady, tenacity. The significance of this newly organized program is clearly threefold: it calls attention to the inadequacy of Fine Arts facilities at Union. embraces a practical plan for the conversion of a soon-to-be vacated building, and most important, vividly demonstrates the potential of what an interested and motivated student group can do for the imp1·ovement of the college. From a dream in the fertile mind of an altruistic undergraduate, the proposal gained the interest of a group of students and faculty who crystallized and expanded it into workable form. The formation of a Student Council Committee to investigate the plan was encouraging and implies the promise of what may well evolve into a fine example of Student-Faculty-Administration-Trustee co- operation which is so prominently stressed in Union's ideology. At this preliminary stage, members of the Engineer- ing and Humanities Faculty seem to agree that it is the most practieal and inexpensive of the proposals that have yet come forth for the N ott 1\femorial. Final decision by the Trustees, of course, awaits a more complete study by structural experts and :McKim, Mead and White, Official College Architects. While interest in the Fine Arts program has been expanded in reeent years by the addition of more Art and Music courses and of a distinguished and talented Fine Arts Faculty, physical facilities for the program have been long since surpassed in adequacy. Fine Arts students have been creating under this severe handicap since the blossoming of the progmm began several years ago. · The addition of equipm~mt for work in ceramics, graphics sculpture and music composing, practicing and listening chambers would demonstrably enhance the en- lightened academic growth which has characterized other areas of Union's curricula. Friday, ·March U, 1960 A Cinema Review ''Fr:uits of Summer\ By Peter M.

This weelt's topic was \Middle East- What Hope for Stability?\ The following article was recently puiJ.. li.s:hed in the ALBANY TIMES UNION. Professor Ri'edel is Chairman o~>f the Government De- partment. For centuries, Jerusalem has been, to many persons, the center, ot• hub, of civilization ·because it is the \holy city\ of three great religions. But if the \V\'heel of Jerusalem'' is one whose squeak disturbs the tranquility of many nations, it is not for the lack of oil, but rather its prox:imity to it. Stability, or the lack of it, in the Middle East must be consid- ered at several levels each some- what unrelated to others. As John S. Badeau points out in a recent Foreign Policy Bulletin, these levels are (1) int~rnal-that is within each state, <2) area-oom- munal-or the relationships of one middle-easteril state with an- other, and (3) global-in which the states of the eastern Medi- terranean play a role in the East- West struggle. Reputa.tioiilS Have Struggle Relatively untouched by west- ern industrial civilization fifty years ago, the populations of the .:.liddle East have struggl<'d in In· creasing turmoil since World War One. Before the partitioning of Palestine> and the creation of a national Jewish state (1947), the entire area was governed by the tenets of Moslem theocracy. Un- der the Turkish Empire, this meant local autonomy for the var- ious tribal units in their internal affairs. There was no need for knowledge of the concepts upon which national states were built -such as nationality circumscr1b- ed by definite political boundaries. Saudi Arabia long have consid- ered themselves natural leaders of any pan-Arab bloc, and they have prevailed on Jordan to fol- low their lead. The Saudi Arabs appear content with self enrich- ment- an objective that would not be furthered by involvement in war. To the nor·th, Iraq gave the western world quite a shock ·by withdrawing from the Baghdag Pact when Kassem came to power. Those observers who are inclined to see all ·international problems in \red\ or \white\ variously pre- dicted that Iraq would go com- munist or join the U.A.R. which they consider under Soviet influ- ence. At present Iraq apparently is on no one's side, bringing an- guish to her neighbors and the great powers with each turn of events. Iran Tied to Soviet Iran remains firmly allied to the anti-Soviet bloc, and there- fore at odds with her western neighbors. And insecure little Lebanon tries to get along with everybody, but asked for Ameri- can intervention when last she thought her borders wet•e threat- ened. Juliette's baby). Guariere, how- ever, warms to his role; and the comedy is delightfully complete. Father FlavoJ•s Film The trouble begins when Mon- sieur Guariere takes a politically calculated interest in his free- living daughter. .As her father soon finds out, there is no trace of the prude in Juliette; and he tries to rectify the situation be- foTe the ·inevitable scandal occurs. He decides that Juliette, living with her permissive mother, must be put under the watchful care of a governess. The governess, however, an runazing old• woman with some novel ideas about adolescent psychology, succeeds in removing any inhibitions that might be left. in Juliette. She selects a suitable mate for her patient, and the three of them go happily up to the hills for some appropriate therapy. Edwige Feuillere, playing the role of the dizzy mother with the SCOTIA ART THEATRE At the level most interesting to us, the Middle East is a battle- ground for economic and pollti- - cal warfare with the Societ Un· ion. But it is one on which neith· er seems amctous to intervene militarily . ·. . except by invita- tion. Neither the United States or the Soviet Union depend on Middle East oil, but control of that prec- ious commodity is a powerful economic weapon in world poli- tics. Until the opening of the Libyan ·oil fields last year mid- dle-eastern oil was critical to the western European economy, and therein lies the cause of the strug- gle. Israel Tied to U, S.

Martin, now on leave, in their research at Union. Their work is currently being supported by a National Institute of Health research grant. The study is based on the fact that certain paramecea release into their environment particles, which when acquired by other paramecea cause death. The ani- male releasing the deadly parti- cles are called \klllers and those affected by the particles are known as \sensitives.\ The par- ticles may show certain analogi-es to viruses. ---·a--- Registration f-or make-up tests to be~ given on Tuesday-Wednes- day, Mar{lh 22-23 must be com- pleted at the Office of the Re·gis- trar before 3:00 P.M.

The almost com- plete absence of a middle-class a generation ago made competi- tion for power largely a family affair. a major power. The importance of oil, pipelines, and the Suez Canal to western Europe form the basis of an adequate \black- mail\ scheme to offset any in- clination on the part of any mid- dle-eastern state permanently to choose sides as between Russia and the West. On the other .hand, communist-imperialism thrives on anti-colonial nationalism which is ~ currently in vogue in that area. PHIL ENGLEBARDT'S . LIQUOR STORE Po-pular -consent Governs Now, with the spread of educa- tion and opportunity to increas- ing numbers, the base of govern- ment has shifted to popular con- sent (not to be confused with democracy), and most middle- eastern governments will continue to rest on very shaky ground un- til the process of transition to the modern state system is com- plete. In the absence of a formal peace treaty, Mr. Nasser contendsthat a state of war continues to exist between the U.A.R. and Israel. This, in turn, is cited to bar use of the Suez Capal to Israel, and to any ships carrying cargo to or from Israel. Many observers have shown optimism over the absence of any large-scale .out- brealts between middle-eastern states, recent border incidents on the Israeli-Syrian border and Nasser's continual threats of to- tal annilation of Israei keep ten- sion high.

According to a statement by advocates of the conversion, \both the Art and Music programs at Union have been expanding rap- idly in the past few years, and the facilities provided for them have been woefully inadequate. Old Chapel, the major area pro- vided for the program, has been serving so many overlapping func- tions tha:t serious difficulties and confusions have resulted.\ I Facilities Limiting Proposed plans and statement of purpose of the advocate group follow in abridged form: \The contemplated conversion of the Nott Memorial Building into a Fine Arts Center would add to general campus facilities two large lecture halls (approximately 325 seats each). These halls would enable large Freshman and Sophomore courses to be taught, experimentally at least, in large (Conti9-ued on Page 6) 3 Curtis Work Gets Debut By RaJ:pih Palasek Last Tuesday evening's Seren- ade Concert had a special interest for the campus in that Professor Edgar Curtis conducted a success- ful premier of his own Concerto for String Orchestra and Organ. The concert got underway with J. S. Bach's Fifth Branden·burg Concerto, which set the mood of the evening by being performed as a \pops\ nun!'ber, Hugh Allen Wilson pulling out all stops as a theatrical sensationalist and virtuoso, giving the impression that he was carelessly thrashing about through the score, yet with the greatest accuracy. Mr. Wil- son was successively angry and sympathetic, ·but for the most part patient, contrasted with his boisterous (pz·ofane?) attitude to- wards the composition. He has ·said--Bach is bully fun, eh, wot? -and the audience has replied accordingly. Theme in the Organ The primary theme in Curtis's Concerto is stated in the organ amid the vacillating broken chords in the first violins, and th.en is restated in the succeeding strings. The middle section of this first movement is a rapid fugue, which is a natural for Wil- son, to whom the concerto is dedi- cated. This is turn, subsides to the initial subtelty, and the move- ment concludes. The second movement left us rather cold. It began well with two wonderfully lyric melodies, but what follows .is an obvious scientific and cal- culated form, which gives the effect of a reactionary movement to classicism. Having set out his principles very definitely in the second movement, Curtis proceeds to bur- lesque romanticism indiffidently. He has made the· incision, and is (Ccr.tinued on Page 4) The contemplated conversiotl has attracted attention and praise from many quarters of the cam- pus, to the extent that the Stu- dent Council createcl a Committee to study the plans at its Tuesday night meeting.

This is generally taken to mean prevention of conception by use of a pill.

Two of America's fore- most living wits, Ea.rry Golden and James ThurbeT, have happily consented to enhance the pages of th.e current issue of LIFE, now · on the newsstands. 1'h.e for- . mer mind has blessed us this time with a touch of h.i.s wisdom, while Mr. 'Th.urber is content to provide us with a scintillating sample of the humorous fruits his mind has born. A Golden Golden Harry Golden is the amaz- ing North Carolinian (via New York City) who h:::~s achieved the phenoll)enal in successfully running a news- ·.- .. paper called the Ca.t'olina Israelite for some 17 years .. Mr. Golden, who will be mal;:- ing an appearance at Union on March 21, has here shifted the direction of his reflections from seltzer to segregation. In a clear and fascinating style, Mr. Golden paints a pk ture of the implications of the current sit-down strikes, which had their inception in his home state, flavored with a welcome optimism, the very outlook that epitomizes all of Golden's philosophizing. · According to Harry, who shows the insider's insight, ~he ~outhern Negro's fight to gain psychological e(]:ualit.Y IS bemg conducted in a calm, sane and highly intelligent manner, and thus must eventually succeed. These are en- . couraging views coming from a sage observer. In this all too short article, LIFE has presented one of the wisest analyses to have been written by an American journalist on a very hot issue. The Mighty Mitty Scores Again . Jumt?ing from the soda to the sublim~, we have a qmck rr:v1ew of th~ career of James Thurber, the reportet·, ~artoomst, playwnght and the greatest working h.umoT- Ist of our day,\ who has recently hit the headlines once again with the opening of his play, The Thurber Carnival which is already plf1ying to standing room only. Thurbe1~ should be an old fnend to the college student as he is the creator of that fabulous warrior of the day-dreaming arena, Walter Middy, a perrenial visitor to benevolent Freshman English courses. . Alth<?ugh Thurber can only be at his best when :he's .giVen a l~ttle m?re elbow room than can be afforded by a composite article, _LIFE h~s succe~sf!lllY captured the flavor of the man m a series of ditties captioned the \~ar Shafts of 3; Veter~n Wit.\ He send a sample missile, for example, m the d1rection of one of his favorite foes, 'Yoinen.

Dealing with five main topics, housing, education, •higher educa- tion, jobs and traveling accom- modations, Dr. Marshall pointed out that a serious segregation problem exists in the north and advised Ms audience how they as· individuals could help to speed its abolition. \Be willing to stand up for the rights of your fellow- citizens-do not under any cir- cumstances tolerate social or oth- er discrimination in your pres- ence or to your knuwledge in your homes, schools, and organiza- tions.\ Summing up, Marshall called the northern problem an individ- ual one. \Segregation is segre- gation, •by law in the south, by custom in the north,\ he conclud- ed.

Spurred on by re- ports of the wonderful suc- cess of The Hidden Pei·sua- ders, LIFE has decided to sponser the applications of this dubious science to the upcoming presidential elec- tions. The Motivational Motive LIFE's motivational re- • search team- has approached the candidate issue with the hope of revealing to the reader not who Americans will be voting for next fall, but rather the image the American voter has of the ideal candidate and how the various hopefuls fit this pattern. The article is at first fascinating, later highly humorous, ·however finally frightening. The LIFE survey has depicted one facet of U. S. elec- tions very clea,:rly, the gross stupidity of ~he. Americ~n voting public. The deplorable state of pu·~hc mterest m politics in this country has long been a topic of deep_co~­ cern to analysts of American democracy, but rarely 1s 1t so clearly demonstrated as it has been in the LIFE story. One doesn't know whether to laugh or to cry when the motivational researcher tells us, \Many people do not know that Nixon is from California, and a good many are under the amazing impression that Eleanor Roosevelt is one of his strongest supporters.\ Another well-informed voter calmly states, \ 'Nixon is a wonderful, a very learned man, and he is. a fr~end C?f the lowest and poorest.' \ Nixon supporters,_ m usmg Ius recent traveling jaunts to logically prove he IS more than capable of handling. any f9reign _affai~s, commented. on his strength in the hne ef fire durmg h1s South American escapade thusly: \ 'Did he cry and whine and r1;1n back _ .to Ike?

His fondest memory dates back to his first varsity game for Hibbing Junior College, when he was 16 years old:- It occurred in a game against a team from Duluth, Minnesota, that was the odds-on favorite. In the final minutes of play Maras caught the game-winning pass and drove across for the final touch- down. The memory of picking himself up from the ground, in tears, is as fresh as a morning breeze. In his senior~ year he was elected team captain and was cited as an All-Conference selec- tion. At Duquesne University, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Maras captained the freshman grid squad. His receipt of the Weiss Award in 1938 culminated an out- standing collegiate career. The Weiss Award is bequeathed to the senior athlete compiling the high- est degree of achievement in aca- demics·and athletics. Dr. A. B. Wright, Dean Emer- itus of Duquesne University, re- calls that \As a student he was top man or close thereto in every course which he took. He mani- fested an early continuing interest in intellectual issues. Joe was also a top notch football player and he has been equally successful as a coach. I regard him as the ideal combination of teacher and ath- letic coach.\ Was Student Leader \Joe was an influential leader among his fellow students and his advice and action was always sen- sible. Without question he· is a. fine, honorable Christian gentle- man in the best sense of that term. He has been and should continue to be an effective leader of young athletes, hel,ping them ta advance themselves in character, 13cl!olarship, !1-l!<l athletic perform- ance.\ Maras recalls that he made the varsity in his sophomore year by being thrown out of a game against Kansas State. \The second game of the season I was in fol' only five minutes, during which time I stopped three running plays at my position for no gain. The guard (named Partner) who was supposed to blockl me became excited and threw a punch. I de- fended myself in kind and wound up on the bench for the rest of the game. The following week against Rice Institute, however, I found myself starting at tackle and played for 5() minutes. I held my position from then on.\ Played in Orange- Bowl Maras ,played on the top-flight Duquesne· team that defeated Mis- sissippi State, 13-12, in the :1.937 Orange Bow'l, but his greatest thrill came when he played 58 minutes in what is regarded as Duquesne's greatest athletic vie- tory. \I was a junior when we met the University of Pittsburgh, at the Pitt stadium. Duquesne de- feated the unscathed and Rose Bowl-bound Pittsburgh, 7-0, in a driving rainstorm, before a crowd of 70,000. Pitt went on to defeat the University of Washington in the Rose B[)Wl, We finished the season by defeating an undefeated University of \Marquette team by two touchdown, in what is regard- ed as one. of the most exciting and and a minor in social studies and English. Si.tbsequent to played center for the Pittsburgh Steelers, of the National Football League, for three years. While with the steelers he played against a former Union coach, Mel Hein, of the New York Giants. Maras feelts that \along with \Turk\ Ed- wards of the Washington Red- skins, I rate Mel Hein one of the greatest linemen I've ever seen perform.\ Served in Pacific From 1940-1943 Maras was em- ployed as an analytical chemist for the Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation. He also served as Operations Coordinator for the Guided .Missile Division of Ray- theon Manufacturing Cor,poration, of Bedford, Massachusetts, for foul' .summers. With the outbreak of the second World War, !Maras attended the Cornell University Deck Officers' School, prior to shipping out as gunnery and athletic offi<::er a}){Jard the USS Boston. 'The Bos- ton, a heavy cruiser engaged in the Pacific Theater, was attached to Admiral Halsey's famous Car- rier Taskl Force 58. Following his stint with the Navy, Maras joined the faculty of Champlain College, in Plattsburg, New York, as an assistant profes- sor of physical education and foot- ball \line coach. In 1948 he went to A.Inherst, where he was an as- sistant professor of physical edu- cation, head wrestling coach, and line , coach of football. \In my mind,\ Maras noted, \my stay at Amherst was the most .memorable aspect of my career. It will al- ways linger with me. This fact was instrumental in my deciding to come to Union.\ From. 1950-1957, ha was Assist- ant Football Coach and Freshman Wrestling Coach at Harvard Uni- versity. Called \Above Average\ Lloyd Jordan, prese'lltly Commis- sioner ·of the Southeastern Con- ference, recalled that \as an as- sistant to me at Amherst College . , . he did a wonderful job not only in the field of athletics, but in the college community as well. He is above the average in the academic field . . . and this en- l!!bled- him to not only gain the respect of the faculty members, but also to assist the players with problems of a non-athletic nature.\ Jordan's high praise is borne out by the fact that the presidents of Harvard and of Amherst per- sonally intervened and tried to in- duce Maras to stay on at their re- spective schools. Intervention for an assistant coach is almost un- known and is an accurate indica- tion of the estoom in which he is held by those that have known him. In 1958 Marras moved on to as- sume the position of associate. pro- fessor of physical education and line coach of football at Columbia University, where he is presently situated. ' Lloyd Jordan sums it all u,p in his description of !Maras. \Joe· Maras' Loyalty to his school, and to his team, is .above average in every way. No one 'has a greater capacity for work. His interest in fundamentals and details is ex- ceptional; his desire to excel is un- limited. Joe has the ablity to get the job done.\ Joseph T.

Joe Maras Will Replace Doyle As. Dutchmen Mentor This Fall By Leslie D. Marrus Joseph T. Maras will replace Keith Doyle in the posi- tion of head football coach this September, it was learned today from Wilford H. Ketz, Director of Athletics. Maras was appointed assistant~•>--------------­ professor of physical education and football coach for three years. After the expiration of his con- tract in three years time Maras will be eligible to receive tenure from the college, him a very fine head <Joach. I have the highest regard for him as a coach who has the respect of the players and can get the most out of them. This to me is the most important faculty in coaching.\ Is ••Sound Technician\ Captain A. G. Dibrell, District Intelligence Officer of the Third Naval District, related that the The decision to hire Maras is interpreted as a result of the gen- eral dissatisfaction with the qual- ity of performance of Union teams, including football, for the past ten years. Football standards of ex:.cellence .have fallen to such a \young men with whom he is low ebb that Amherst College was I associ8:te-d in the classroom and forced to discontinue an associa- as a;ssJStan~ fo?tbal! .coach have tion with Union this past season conf1denc~ m h1s ab1hty ~nd t~ey that dates back to 1894. ;espect him as a ~an w1th h1gh !deals and unswervrng adherence Poor Record Cited In the past ten years only five of Union's 11 teruns have gone un- defeated in at least half of their games. Football victories, for this same period, have been garnered in just about one-third of the games played. Student, faculty,'. and alumni sentiment as a result has tended toward the advocation of dropping football as a fall sport. The sports editor of the Rochester Calm'PUS Times suggested that Union dis- band its football team. after view- ing this past season's disasterous meeting of the two schools. Maras' appointm.ent was made with the attitude that if he couldn't produce a winning team in three years time the ;prophesies of the doom of Union football might just become actuality. Maras is, at the present time, an associate in physical education and line coach of football at Co- lumbia University, in New York City. He has had a great deal of experience in the fields of recruit- ing and alumni relations. In the past he has traveled extensively under the aegis of admissions of- fices, screening secondary school applicants and visiting alumni organizations to establish sound, functional and effective alumni relations. Maras Well Recommended Of the 48 high school and col- lege coaches who applied for the position of varsity football coach Maras was unquestionably con- sidered to be the outstanding can- didate. His years of fine experi- ence and his outstanding recom- mendations clinched his appoint- ment. Aldo T. Donelli; head football coach at Columbia, said, \I can- not but recommend him to<J high- ly as a person. He has always had the admiration and respect of faculty, alumni, and of the press.\ \He definitely has the qualities of leadership which would make to the rules of the game and <Jf good sportsmanship. He is a credit to Columbia in the class- room and on the playing field,\ Ralph J. Furey, Director of Athletics at Columbia, observed that, \Maras is an able coach, a sound technician and is extremely well liked by both boys and staff, and has a wide experience in the type of football which, shall we say, is amateur rather than 'semi- professional'.\ \Joe is a cultured gentleman,\ commented Kenneth F. Herrold, Profess()r of Education at Colum- bia. \He is cultured in the sense not only of being informed to a rather unusual degree for a foot- ball coach. but his concern with values, norms and standards is usually well developed. He is the kind of person who I believe could make a tremendous contribution to young men on the small col- lege campus.\ ' Stresses Studies As head football coach Maras will be faced with a difficult jo'b when he comes to the Union cam- pus next year. Even with the able assistance of a fine coaching staff, he will find the task of forming a strong football team from largely green and untried material to be far from easy. His enthusiasm and love for the game of football should be the deciding factors in his favor. In discussing his appointment as head football coach Maras stat- ed, \I have· fulfilled a life-long ambition in accepting this coach- ing position at Union.
