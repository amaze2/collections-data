Tidmarsh of Sche- nectady, noted organist and Pt·o- fessor Emeritus of Music will pre- sent au organ recital in Memorial Chapel this Sunday, October 9, at 4 P.M. The perforni.arrce will be the first in a series of seven recitals to be given th!s year. Highlighting Sunday's program will be the \Third Chorale\ by the contemporary Dutch organist Hendrick Andriessen. Tidlnarsh, who has served for several years as summ-er organist at the Amer- ican Cathedral in Paris, Ft·ance, recently played the work on the organ of Notre Dame Cathedral. The equipment consists of ear- phones, a record player and a - tape recorder. It will be available only to classes and not to individ- ual students. The set-up will be used by the music department to study vari- ous works outside of class, thus leaving more time for discussion. Edgar Curtis, Director and. Pro· fessor of Music, asserted i.hat \This was a very wonderful idea of Mr. Webb's to facilitate class- room work. In addition, the new facilities in the music department will enrich the opportunities, available in music classes.\ Comprising the remainder of the program will be the follow- ing: \Prelude and Fugue in F'; In the modern language depart- rby Dietrich Buxtehude, \Fantasia ment, students will be able to No. 1 in F Minor\ by Wolfang study \both visually and orally,\ Amadeus Mozart, \Liebestrauin\ accordili:g to Helmer Webb, Col- and \St. FranCis Walking on the lege Librarian.

This motion too was passed unanim- ously. Mr. Houlihan then sug- gested that in the interests of good taste the reporter from the Conco1·diensis should omil inform- ing the student body of this sec- tion of the meeting. No discus- sion followed. This suggestion also receh·ed unanimous approval. Finally, Student Council Chair- man Gary Gross proposed that the Council should give its ap- proval to the actions of the I.F.C. in its fight to change the new s·ocial rules, and encourage it to press the matter. The motion was passed. CounCil Supremacy Questioned Early in the evenin;; discussion began on approval of the Dormi- tory Council Constitution.

The Blank On Page One There is a l>lank space in the lead story on page one. lt is there because the Student Council wishes to forget what should have appeared in the blanl{ space in the lead story on page one. It is there because the Student Council believes that if ignored, controversy will clisa:ppear. A resolution \Vas introduced in the Student Council last Tuesday night. It was a basically sensible and sound resolution, concerned with tl1e integrity of student govern- ment at Union. It dealt in part with the recent hasty and ill-conceived introduction of new fraternity social rules to the campus. The Student Council, acting in haste ignited by fear, and without regard for generally accepted leg-islative pro- cedures, unanimously voted to reject the resolution without benefit of the customary discussion and debate. Immediately thereafter, and even more condemnable, the Council hysterically voted to strike the resolution, and the motion by which it was rejected, from the record. The Council, motivated by apprehension and mistrust, held the erroneous impression that if they ignored the resolution, it might somehow crawl up in a comer and die. Instead of meeting its prol>lems in a straig·htforward manner, the Council chose to avoid them. Rather than approach their campus responsibilities with intelligence and enlightenment, the Council chose the nefarious course of deceit. Chiefly responsible for this cowardly com·se of action was Senior class representative Peter Houlihan. For it was he who first rose to his feet to sponsor the motions recorded above. (But recoTded in no other publication. They will not appear in the Student Council minutes). The blank space in the lead story on page one will always be a conspicuous memorial to the void of reason that typified the Student Council last Tuesday night. The blank space in the lead story on page one will always . attest to the challenge which Tuesday's Council failed to meet. What Are You Afraid Of? -Of what (or of whom) was Mr. Houlihan and his lackies afraid when they chose their course of silence on Tuesday night? It is possible that they desire to keep their constituents ignorant of their activity (or lack of it)? Is it possible that they feared reaction by members of the college administration or by certain alumni groups? More probable is that they wished to exempt them- se'lves from involvement in campus controversy. Far safer, reasoned they, to remain stagnant than to aet. To \wait and see\ than to assume a positive stand. Poof :1.\lr. Houlihan! You're a lemon meringue pie! A Modest Proposal In order that the integi'ity of student government at Union be retained and strengthened, the Student Council is urged to seriously consider the foiiowing resolution: \Union College was a child of a new national democracy, and its organizational structure is today built upon the conYidi0n thnt hy living tog('fh('t' in a (]f'mO('l'afi(' ('oll.,g., UNION Guest House 1228 UNION ST.

There will be 8,000 supervism-y jobs filled from within the Western Elech'ic Company by college graduates in just the next ten years! How come? Because tl1ere's the kind of upward movement at Western Electric that spells executive opportunity. Young men in engineering and other professional work can choose between two paths of advancement~ one within their own technical field and one ~vithin over-a1! management. Your progress up-the-ladder to executive positions will be aided by a number of special programs. The annual company-wide person- nel survey helps select management prospects. This ties in with planned rotational develop- ment, including transfers between Bell Com- panies and experience in a wide variety of fields. Western Electric maintains its own full- time graduate engineering training program, seven formal management courses, and a tui- tion refund plan for college study. After joining Western Electric, you'll be planning prod .ction of a steady stream of communications products-electronic switch· ing, carrier, microwave and missile guidance systems and components such as transistors, diodes, ferrites, etc. Every day, engineers at om manufacturing plants are working to bring new developments of our associates at Bell Telephone Laboratories into practical reality.

Opening to a crowd estimated at over 3,000, Union played Alfred to a standoff in the first half, and then smashed through from be- hind for the win in the last half. A Union victory? H'rurnph! Impossible \Winless Wonders•• Triumph The upset triumph ilnded an 18- game winless span over three sea- sons during which time the Dutchmen had only a scoreless tie against Hobart to offset an . all-losing skein. During the second period the Garnet simply outplayed the \weary talent-thin\ visitors. Im- mediately upon Alfred's Johnny Shea scoring a 39 yat'd run for the first touchdown of the game, and big Dave Lucsic's extl'a point gave the visitors a 7-0 edge, Union opened up with Marquez, Jimmy Erceg, and Pete Burgwald greas- ing thru the Saxon line time and time again to set the stage for the Dutchmen's comeback. Garnet Booters Excel In 2-2 Hamilton Game By Skip Towl An artful display on how soccer should be played failed to break the 2-2 tie against Hamilton this nesday. The Garnet team played its best game yet under the leadership of co-captains • ~~~~n~i.~~i.Ted Smith, an.d Class Of 1964 Hamilton was first to tally by scoring a goal in the second quarter. The game was nip and tuck all the way, but the Union team missed their lucky breaks around Hamilton's goal area. It wasn't until the final minutes of the fourth quarter that soph- more Ed Lipton took advantage of an opportunity to score and then walked away from their goal leaving the score a 1-1 tie. The game went into a ten minute overtime with five minute halfs. The first half of the overtime, neither team scored, although the Dutchmen threatened many times. In the very beginning of the final half of the overtime Hamilton man,aged to wedge one between our defenses and into the nets. Persistently fighting hard up until the final minutes, the game reach- ed a second climax when soph- more Pat Dugan scored for Union. M()raek Lauded Bob Morack, senior, deserves a great deal of credit for the fine game he played. Hustling and fighting hard, he set the ideals for his teamates on the field. Bill Cohen played his usually out- standing game by -saving 22 shots to the 11 of ours stopped by Hamilton. Last Saturday, revenge caught· the Garnet soccer team off guard. Middlebury was out to recover the one loss that we marked on their almost perfect record last year. A 5-1 victory for them was their lesson to us. Four of their goal-s were scored in the first quarter. As soon as the leaky holes were patched, Union held them down to one more goal. Harvey Hayden scored his firl'lt goal of the sea- son in the final quarter. The final -score was 5-1. Coach Witzel attributes the Middlebury defeat to the lack of experience of the team; other-. wise he feels that this year's team has greater potential than last year's and hopes for better results. The fact that Middlebury defeated the Dartmouth soccer team eat>lier this sea-son consider- ably softened the blow of this defeat. ---o--- Season Union 6 Union 21 Scores Union Bates 21 Alfred 13 Rochester Rochester 14 ......... , Hamilton .6 Rochester 0 ..•. , •.. , . Hobart 6 Topples Sophs In 72-69 Win The Class of 1964 has served formal notice on the sophomore class, and informal notice on th~ entire student body, that basket- ball is oh the upswing 'On the Garnet Campus. The freshQ:Je:n scored a 72-69 upset win over the highly-favored sophomores. Superior control of the rebounds proved to be the difference as the freshmen took full advantage <>f their height superiority. Fresh- man Toby Lustig led the year- lings with 25 points and a lion's share of the rebounds. The 6'5\ eager was supported by Myles Arber who cpntribute<l 18 points and also helped out ably under the boards. Lew J.ones led both teams i:n scoring, hltting for 26 points, 16 of which came in the final quar- ter, as the sophomores made a determined come-back which fell short by three points. Dave Santos, high-scorer on last year's freshman squad, had 18 points, but sat out the last quarter. 13Q:X: &core; Freshmen Arber Sahr Lustig Maute Hollowaty Hyman Sophomores Santos Tyndall Frigo Finnegan Jones Prescott Goals 8 4 12 3 2 •I 33 ~ 6 4 () 13 1 31 Free 'fhrows 2 2 1 1 0 () 4 1 0 1 0 1 -----~-------- 1'ota.I Points 18 10 25 7 1 8 72 18 13 8 l 26 3 69 ·The Average Man The age-old conception that a.n BJthlete is an individual with less· academic .prowess than his fellow classmates has ·been proved a falsity at Sewanee.

Marquez then crashed through from the third. A pass attempt on the point- after touchdown was incomplete leaving Union on the short end of a 7-6 count, but the pattern which was to shape the end re- .sult already was apparent. Union took its second goal on a \spectacular\ sequence of plays, after holding on downs to take the ball on its own 42. A 22-yard pass from EaJes to Umscheid, followed, by a 12-y.ard burst by Tommy :Pike brought to the Al- fred 20. The ball was moved to the 17 by Marquez, and then heaved perfectly by Eales to the end zone. A hard running Um- scheid leaped, finget·s outstreched at the ball, caught it, and brought Union out a:head. Ea.Ies-Umaheid Sparkle It was one of the most spec- tacular ·catches in several seasons and stamps the Eales-Umsheid duo as a combination to watch. An eight-point TD-J?AT combin- ati'On was achieved when Brad Arthur, put in for the extra point, threw a perfect pass to Halfback Jack Sbrega. T·he Garnet now had a 14-7 lead. The hard hitting Union, squad earned its third goal with a quick- thinking 54-yard drive highlighted by Marquez, Burgwald, and Sbrega.

Feature Editor The Age of Enlightment The abundance of Letters to the Editor in this issue of the Concordiensis is only one indication of the awaken- ing- of student awareness which began to blossom on Union's campus just one year ago. Perceptive upperclassmen remember how the campus emerged from its traditional Ivory Tower of letharg:y to attain new heights of student enlightenment and legisla- tive accomplishment. A new and promising system of deferred rushing was instituted and the chapel program was revised. Through its elected representatives, the stu- dent body took firm and well informed stands on :ampus and national issues, ranging from the campus traffic prob- lem to the southern segregation sit-ins. The campus came alive with enel'getic discussion of the new Schaffer ~i­ brm·y, the possibility of converting the Nott Memorral into a Fine Arts Center and the disclaimer clause of the National Defense Education Act. A Dean of Students was appointed and the Trustees took a firm stand on the question of racial discrimination. Both the Student Council and the Inter Fraternity Council returned to campus this fall under an obligation to the student body to successfully continue the produc- tive trend established by last years student legislatures. The current attempts of the Inter Fraternity Council to deal with student grievances of the new fraternity social rules is a well directed step toward the fulfillment of that obligation. It is the obligation of the Student Council to educate itself to deal with controversal issues in a firm and pro- gressive manner. Wayne C.

Nixon and Senator John F. Kennedy !'net in the third of their nationally televised debates. Tbe meeting stood out princi- pall.Y becau:5e of the spunk of both candidates. Seasoned by two tele- vision performances, they display- ed airs of realization, intertwined with spirit and dynamics that were less noticeable in their prev- ious appearances. The elections, less than a month away, have prompted Senator Kennedy and Vice President Nixon to get down to specifics. Last night the main issues at hand were the proposed objectives concer-ning the United States pol- icy towards Quemoy and Matsu, agricultural and labor programs and our overseas prestige. Nixon Fears Appeasement Nixon implied that the United States must defend Quemoy and Matsu. He stated that acquiesing to Communist demands in this area would only be the fir-st rung on the ladder of appeasement. Kennedy, though in agreement with Nixon's basic premise, doubt- ed the practicality of their de- fense, with constant references to statements made by our foremost military leaders. Both candi- dates' statements, though individ- ually sotihd, when compared, are somewhat ·confusing. H all boils down to whic'h source the candi- dates choose to quote. However, this difference brings an interest- ing point to light. Whose word should the people of the United States accept; the reports sub- mitted by the greatest military authorities ·of the United States or the voting record of their elect- ed representatives? Ag\rlcuitural Policies ChaJienged with facts and figures pertaining to the farmer's income. He had originally stated: \Our agricul- tural program would cost America 1.5 billion dollar-s less than the present program while Nixon's would cost one billion dollars more even though it is merely a re- statement of Secretar-y of Agri- culture Benson's program.\ Impressive Figures Quoted Unfortunately, the figures quot- ed by both men may conceivably be too towering for the American public to grasp. The enormity of statements expressing fiscal policies in the billions are doubt- lessly imposing, not because of their merit but perhaps through simple sheer weight in numbers. This obsei.\Ver doesn't wish to deny their virtue, but feels that terms should be defined and expressed so that a population earning about one hundred dollars a week on the average can under-stand them. As for the candidates' perf-orm- ance, the difference was more marked than in their other two appear-ances. Neither hesitated to declal'e his opponent's sourees and information erroneous. It seemed obvious that during the course of last night's spectacular, both men attempted to foster images of themselves and wished, through these images, to prove that they and their policies are unique. Nixon fared better in accomplish- ing this end; he employed fewer statistics and more dogmatic gen- eralizations. The Republican can- didate seemed to be reaching for the vote of the feminine popula- tion by directing many of his statements towards them. Views Straightforward Kennedy was less personal. He was straightforward· in the sup- port of his views. However. he lacked the human quality that so many in his audience wanted to feel in him through association. The debate was certainly re- vealing. If scored by rounds, Nixon was slightly more impres- sive last night. However, these next few weeks ar-e a toss-up and we will certainly see the battle lines drawn with greater clarity. From now on it will be a free-for- all between the two contenders for the championship. ----•o--- OONOORI)IENSIS. nical society cannot be operated by helots. \Soviet rule has bestowed on science all the authority of which it deprived religion\-Edouard Herriott. \Culture in the popular sense, is still a magic word in the Soviet Union.

The art galleries arid theatres are always full, and the magnifi- cent collections and performances fully justify the expenditures of the government upon themto The Hermitage in Leningrad, for ex- ample, contains twenty-five Rem- brandts and fifty-one Picassos, as well as numerous Rubenses, Cezannes, Monets and Gaugins: with such a wealth of painting it must ranlt equally with the Louvre and the Vatican. This collection is almost mart:ched by the Tetrachkov Gallery in Mas- cow! 0J.\eativiby Muzzled Contemporary Soviet art, how- ever-, is quite depressing in ef- fect. The current dogma .of \soc- ialist r-ealism\ has muzzled the creative instincts of ihe ar-tist, and has produced only dry-as- dust representational and pl.'opa- gandist stuff which is conven- tionally \safe\ and bourgeois in inspiration-many of the nudes have neat little G-strings slipped over ihem. Abstract art is, of course, anathema and when I asked my guide in Leningr-ad for her opinion of Picasso s·h~ re- plied-\We admire him as a Com- munist, not as a painter.\ · I was ·fortunate to obtain tickets for both Borodin;s \Prince Igor\ and Prokofiev's ballet, \The Stony Flower,\ at the Bolshoi.

A bit old-fa.sh- icmed by contemporary western standards, perhaps, with every emphasis on the sqenic effects~ putting ()n a show~rather than on a blend of supreme music and acting. Education is Specialized Soviet education is intensely specialist. and hardly calculated to produce a well-rounded human being. This was very obvious in Public School No. 143 in Moscow, wher-e I taught English for a few days; the fourteen-year-old class were studying English novels taken only at the soJlhomore level in German and French Universi- ties. They were, of course, \Eng- lish\ specialists; but the same is true of other subjects. After school the Young Pion- eers (children 'belonging to the Communist youth organization) have what I can only term \di- rected recreation.\ In the Young Pioneers' Palaces and Research Stations they are allowed to pur- sue a hobby at advance level be it building a scooter-, or being taught chess by an expert of the standing of Tal, or talking poe- try with Marshak. In this way, they are kept off the streets- and what is more, they both bene- fit from and enjoy the instruc- tion. The same \scientific\ approach to education is evident also in the Universities and lieknilunns. Money is no barrier-the scien- tific section of the Lomonosov State University (the highest bl!ilding in Europe after the Eif- fel Tower) cost 750 million dol- lars alone; nor is the oft-l'epeated criticism that the Russians lavish all their- money ort one project valid, for the other uni,ersities Which I saw were quite adequate- ly, though not so lavishly, equip- ped.

A Sophomore government major, with a wealth of knowl- edge in world affairs at hand, he -proves himself to be an expert art critic. Art is an integral part of his- tory. Its evolution, throughout marty centuries, inscribed in countless volumes, will doubtlessly continue to be noted. Today, un- usual as it seems, international affairs encompasses two predom- inant schools of art. Both have great followings. Their beliefs emanate from two opposing coun- tries; the Union of Soviet Social- ist Republics, and the United States of America. are authentic with Russia's. My point is that there is art in foreign pol- icy. The strat- egy of the Un- ited States is painted differ- ently from that of Russia. She sculpts with dif- ferent materials. Her engravings when compared Artist in point: Uncle Sam. He is considerably older than Grand- ma Moses, and more difficult to recognize. Throughout the years • he has demonstrated a style mu;:h less consistent than hers. Supplites Costly Uncle Sam creates only with the finest of materials, his paints are by far the most expensive. His claim to distinction is that his supplies are the most costly. However, he doesn't know how to mix them. Th,e results are un- fortunate to behold. They lump and clot; and sometimes even run. The materials are thel'e, the di- rection isn 7 t. One hundred ninety years ago, Uncle Sam was struggling to >Cre- ate a name for himself. With intermitten~ periods of direetion he has painted; the evolving products leading farther and far- ther from the orig.inals. Pres- ently, both his canvasses and his sculptures are amorphous, aSsum- ing distinctiveness comparable to a London fog. The young novice struggling for direction is con- founded, for he cannot discern any outstanding characteristic. In this age, the young want to learn from the old, for the old have nothing to ·teach. It is sad- that Uncle Sam is a poor teacher. .More unfortunate, he is a noor student. Uncle Sam doesn't Jearn f·rom his contemporaries. He ig- nores the techniques they are des- perately trying to forge. In his self-righteous guidance program, he continues to paint and sculpt (Continued on Page 6) 0 TAKEAWAY MY SCHAEFER. ..

6 Pollock • 0 • (Continued from Page 1) ity chapters, and have In common with the College the goal that fraternities should demonstrate more fully their ability to make a positiv()_ contributi'on toward the broad educational objectives of this institution. Social Polleies Reviewed \Three committees were esta;b- lished by the Alumni H:<'C, one of which was a committee of fra- ternity social affairs. This com- mittee has had several meetings since last spring with the Dean of Students and carefully reviewed the social policies and regulations of the College. Out of these meet- ings came rec·ommendations upon which the revised College regula- tions were based. The recom- mendations were forwarded for approval through the Dean of Students to the members of the Committee on Fraternities and Student Life of the Board of Trustees. In the late summer the committee approved the revised regulations and they became the official regulations of the Col- lege to be enforced by the Dean of Students. The rules covered the following main aneas: Visiting hours for women, chaperones, when and w·here parties may be held, and registration and ap· prova) of social functi\Ons.

Discussion of the motion, how- ever, led to controversies includ- ing: how new members would be appointed to the court in fu- ture years; who would head the traffic court; and whether or not new fines should be imposed and old fines revised. During further discussion tt was decided that the Student Council President should appoint the members each year just as he ·does in the case of other commi,ttees. Under an amendment to the original plan, the quorum would consls.t of five members. At this point Doru3ld Crist, Sec- retary of the Council, stated: \It seems to me that many loopholes in the traffic committee's plan have been pointed out. Perhaps a little more formal report with more preparation could be sub- mitted at a later date.\ A motion was then made and carried to b3.ble Mr. Shapiro's report for two weeks. JIIIZZ Ooncert Set Other proposals at the meeting included a proposal by Norman Lavery to have a jazz c9ncert at Union on March 12, 1961. Lavery explained that the motion Wall being made at this time because many months adVl:J.nce notice is necessary to obtain top perform- ere such as Count Basie and the Four Freshmen. This motion was· unanimously carried. A report from the LF.C. pointed out that the trustees of the col- Iege have scheduled a meeting at the end of this month, and that the I.F.C. \hopes for a change in tlie social rules before prom weekend.\ A final motion Wi:J.S made by Paul Winston to ask the Dean and social calander committee to suspend classes on November 12, so that students can support Union at the Hamilton game.

He contended that the Republican administra· tion has moved us toward the brink of war. Presenting the U-2 incident as an example of \how not to go to the Summit,\ Wiley described the Eisenhower record as \a great step backward.\ He then contrasted the Democrats by describing their \new vigor and ideas.\ he met last December to deter- \Our country is first militarily, mine the type of project to be economically, scientifically, and undertaken.

'90, No .5 JlllZZ Concert Set Other proposals at the meeting included a proposal by Norman Lavery to have a jazz concert at Union on March 12, 1961. Lavery explained that the motion was being made at this time because many months adv.1nce notice is necessary to obtain top perform- ers such as Count Basie and the Four Freshmen. This motion was unanimously carried. A report from the I.F.C. pointed out that the trustees of the col- lege have scheduled a meeting at the end of this month, and that the I.I•'.C. \hopes for a change in the social rules before prom weekend.\ A final motion w.1s made by Paul Winston to a.sk the Dean and social calander committee to suspend elasses on November 12. so that students can support Union at the Hamilton game. This motion was also passed unanimously.

Shaw, Jd1'.!1 ~:mn: i A Printz of Fools The following editorial comment, indicative of the Southern point of view, appeared in the October 7, .1960 issue of the l\Iississippi Southern College Student Prmtz: \It was notable in the reading of over 30 campus news- papers from colleges over the US that the segregation issue did not receive the attention of one college news- paper editor. Our presumption of last year that the segre- O\ation \Sit In's\ were nothing but a fad was true. If their beliefs were sincere they would not decline to put pressure on who ever is conce1·ned in order to see them accomplished. It will be interesting to see what our Yan- kee cousins will be \fading\ at next.\ To the Editor of the Student Printz: The Editorial Board of the Concordiensis is quite dis- 'tressed by your inaccurate comment that \in the reading of over 30 campus ne'\vspapers ... the segregation issue\ was not mentioned .. Since the Student Printz receives this paper and ha.s, on several occasions in the recent past, re- printed material from the Concordiensis we are at a loss to understand how the Printz could have overlooked the following Concordy articles on the segregation issue: \Student Council adopts firm stand on racial equality,\ \Gov. Vandiver's Bill: An Appeal For Liberty\ \Dateline USA Student Reaction\ \The Southern Hope\ \Elect John G. <Crommelin, the Whiteman's Candidate\ \NSA Policy: Integration\ \Civil Rights Issue Affects Election\ With All Deliberate Speed\ \Segregation Analyzed-A New Per- spective?\ \Student Council Views Discriminatory Ac- tion\ \May it Please the Court-Discrimination Must Go\ \Student Council Sends Telegrams; Opposes Police Ac- tion\ \NSA Cites Recent Race Intolerances\ \Fraternities Deaffiliate\ \N. C. Negroes Defy South's Segregation\ and many other articles and editoiials. The Concordiensis, whose exchange list includes over twice the number of college newspapers that the Student Printz chose to read, is joined by scores of other college ptrblications in the fight against the bigotry and intoler- ance of segregation. , If the Student Printz presumes the fight against seg- regation to be a \Yankee fad\ then it logically follows that the struggle which led to the founding of our nation, and the endless battle for freedom and human dignity fought at Bunker Hill, Appomattox, Chateau-Thierry, Iwo Jima, and Korea must also be \Yankee fads.\ a The Editorial Board of the Concordiensis joins its col- leagues throughout the nation in extending a cordial invita- tion to the Editors of the Printz to enter the world of twentieth century journalism. R.S.V.P. Coming of Age At Union With the announcement on the front page of this newspaper of the schedule for next month's freshman elections, the Glass of 1964 passes into political pubescense. Once a carefree neophyte, the f1·eshman is about to cast off his beanie and become a full citizen of the college community. Recognition as an elector, however, implies a twofold responsibility which all freshmen must bear if Union's tra- . ditional form of student government is to survive success- fully. The freshman has a responsibility to his classmates to elect officers and representatives who are best qualified, without 1·egard to their social popularity. He has a further responsibility to himself, to become well informed and to achieve close communication \\-ith his representatives so that the aims of student government may be carried for- ward. The unhappy res.ults which accompany the neglect of these responsibilities may be viewed with predictable regu- larity every other Tuesday night in Hale House. With a handful of notable exceptions, the Student Council is a poorly informed body, additionally handicapped by the lack of general student body interest in its affairs.

The dissent- ing churches are, I am told, both more spit·itually and intelligent- ly alive. Five Year Plan Is Rage The economic rage in Russia at present is the latest Five Year Plan which, broadly speaking, is intended to push Soviet produc- tion figures above American av- erages. This may happen sooner, though not in the field of con- sumer goods than we may think; personally, I fail to see how the Russian standard of Jiving, how- ever, can ever eclipse the Ameri- can. To cite one example. My car in ~1oscow was a Moslnitch. am not denying that when I drove it I found it almost as good as the British equivalent; the sig- nificent point to me was that af- ter visiting the factory which pro- duced it, less than 240 are pro- duced per day. lThe Volkswag- en factory in Germany, with roughly the same labor force, pro- duces 2,000!). One need not look far for a reason for differential: the Moskvitch is made largely with pre-wat· Opel machinery filched from Germany in 1945 as part o,f war-preparations. Only in recent years are strenu- ous efforts being made to enable Russia to produce her own man- ufacturing plant. Industry has been modernized and decentral- Will the West ·be beaten? Per- haps. It depends how stupid W!l are ourselves. The battleground will cert.a;inly be in the under- developed and newly emergent na- tionalities; it will be a ·battle for minds and bellies. To view the Cold War only in military terms and potentials is disasterous; \containment\ of the Soviet Un- ion by a circle of nuclear bases worked well enough when the United States had total suprem- acy in atomic weapons-today it enables the Kremlin to choose the weakest point in the chain for its break-through-in Laos and Cuba. We shall not win by opposing any rigorous ideology to com- munism but by a healthy empiri- cism t'Owards the s.oi-disant neu- trals. An ideology of \freedom\ breeds suspicion among the small- er countries o.f the western alli- ance and neutrals alike; for \freedom\ I know to •have a to- tally d'lfferent meaning in India and Ghana. It is an evil thing we are fighting; but only when financial' aid becomes.,. truly al- truistic-since we believe in self- determination and national inde- pendence-and not a cash invest- ment as well, will results show. Otherwise we shall slip back into the world of sl<Jt-machine or- gies, picture-theatres and poach- ed-egg-on-chip palaces; of the bowler-hat which proves that all Englishmen are ultimately equal even if they cannot wear an Old School tie; of smug self-complac- ency and ostrichlsm.

Never in the history of soccer games played •against RPI has Union defeated the Engineers. Coach Witzel's hope;; were high ·and when Ted Smith scored the first point of the game it ap- peared that more than hope was with the Dutchmen. RPI tallied . three times in the second period 1 after Captain Smith had scored I ~ and then went on to lead the rest of the game for a fin3.l 3-1 : victory. I Post Winless Record I • The Union cross-country teams were both edged by their tradi- tional rivals, RPI, b:J.st Saturday. For the varsity it was their third straight loss as RPI squeaked out a 26-33 victory. The fresh- men dropped their second meet by the same spread of seven points, 25-32 . Union's Dick Giddings won in- dividual honors with a time of 28:40. Dave Huels and Bob Eng- lish were the only other Garnet runners to place in the first ten finishers. Huels finished fourth with 30:16, while English placed fifth with 30:20 . Ketz Comments Co.:wh Bill Ketz commented after the meet. \Over-all it was a very slow race. The meet was finished for Union when Wayne Laverty collapsed at the 2%. mile mark from lung congestion. At thi~ time Laverty was in the lead. Tom Finnegan turned his ankle in the swamp, but con- tinued on to finish. Huel.s and English both looked good. Eng- lish has definitely showed gre.:l.t improvement.\ Sophomore star quarterback Dave Eales passes over the heads of. the RPI defensemen, to end. Last week the Union team added two tie scores to its record I · which now stands four losse.s and I three tieR. The first gamE' ngainst .1 Syracuse resulted in a 1-1 tie. 1 Peter Bishko ~cored for Union in 1 the early part of the fjrst quarter · and it wasn't until the end of! the final quarter that Sy!'11CUSP 1 tallied on a corneF kick. The sec- ond game was played against Hobart last Saturday and proved HARVEY HAYDEN ln the freshman n1eet, RPI's Bob Cooke wa.s the. winner with a time of 16:35. Union's John Norm Lavery, for a short gain in last SatUil'dlay's Homecoming win over arch-rivals RPI. By Dave Thui'ston \One of these games we're going to have a little breathing room\ exhaled grid coach Joe Maras following his charges 14-7 victory over :RPI before a Homecoming crowd of some 4,000. It was a squeaker all the way, despite the fact that both eleve:ns registered goose-eggs on the • ·. _;~~~:~o~:~f. for the entire Cage Squad Starts Drills; In fact, all the scoring came in a hectic second period that saw RPI grab a 7-0 lead without the benefit ·Of a first down and the Dutchmen rebounding right back with a pair of quick touch- downs. The go ahead t:tlly came on a picture play from stanQ.out quarterback Dave Eales to the fleet Bob Holland. Following a damaging penalty that nullified a nifty 16 yard run by Bob Mar- quez, Eales uncorked a be,Jutiful spiral to Holland who caught the Engineer secondary napping. Basketballer Bob never broke stride as he hauled the pigskin in on the R.PI ten and breezed to paydirt in one of the prettiest plays seen on Alexander Field in many a Saturday. The Shoe Fit With this play, Union ~eg~ained the Dutchmen's shoes, symbolic of victory in the annual Union- RPI rivalry. The wooden shoes had been missing from the UC campus for three years, but the Garnet defensemen took to heart the old adage, \If the shoe fits \ The RPI offense fit the Maras- men perfectly and the Dutchmen wore it-right into the ground. The Engineers hit for only one first down in the first half and tallied but seven in the whole game. The Batchelors scored via ,a. blocked punt by John Wiatrow- ski that gave RPI the ball on the Union R Bob Keifer, who was n(}t slated to start, slashed off right tackle for· the score. Pete Widness booted the extra point and it was 7-0, RPI. Union scrambled back on the ensuing kickoff, scoring on a 48 yard drive following a 32 yard kickoff return by the versatile Mr. Eales. Despite glaringly in- efficient P•3..SS pFotection at times, Eales managed to connect on seven of 13 heaves good for 116 yards. A Well-Mixed Brew Outlook For '60 Uncertain Although the Garnet will not inaugurate the 1960- 1961 basketball season until e.ar-ly December, Coach Carl Witzel has his boys drilling for the difficult season ahead.

A spirited rua,y. Garnet might cause a few sur- to be more of a challenge for the Garnet. Cambell scored for Hobart in the few rem:Uning minutes of the first' quarter and it wasn't until the third quarter that Ed Lipton poked in a crisp wing shot from Bishko for Un- ion's first point. In the same quarter Lust scored for Hobart making the score 2-1 in favor of Hobart. In the final quarter, Abe Terpening, a sophomore, made an unassisted goal to tie up the game for .a final 2-2. Most of the teams that Union has played this year have peen experienced veterans such as is the makeup of the RPI and Middlebury soccer teams. Coach Wit;~el has been working with sixteen sophomores and seven upperclassmen this season. Need- less to say, inexperience has hindered the effectiveness of the team. As for the in- dividual makeup of the Garnet soccer ·team, men such as Abe Terpening have shown such tre- mendous improvement that their suppor.t on the team in years lo come will be an invaluable asset. Sepples placed second with 16:57. Peter Bishko also deserves a Other top Garnet finishers were great deal of credit for his con- Bill Irv.ine and Andy Warde who tinually fine performances on the placed fifth and sixth respec- fleld •and undoubtedly he, Pat tiV'ely. Dugan, Wyman, Harrison, and .Coach Ketz said abou,t the freshman team, \Sepples looked very good, Irvine showed great drive whi'le Warde, who ran with a broken bone in his foot, did well to finish sixth.\ Ed Lipton (all sophmores) will receive more recognition in time as they gain the necessary ex- perience to mold an undefeatable team. The next two games against Colgate and Trinity College are the most challenging on the schedule and even with .a. no win record to date, it wouldn't be surpnsmg if the experience- gaining sophmores marked vic- tory on their record. Sophomore quarterback Dave Eales was designated by the Eastern College Athletic Con- ference 1JS· the second choice for the Sophomore of the Week award. Dave played almost the entire· gatr.e in the 14-7 victory over RPI, and completed seven of 13 pas~es for 116 yards, including a 48 yarder for the winning coun- ter. Facing their worst season in 14 years, H<>bart's gridders drilled mercilessly this past week for a Parents Weekend contest with Union at GeneVI1.. The lineup, in the backfield at least, will bear little resemblance to the one that lost 13-0 to Alfred lli;St Saturday. Union has scored Rix touch- downs thus far this season, but Hobart still has only its lone one of the Rochester game. The Garnet, after never win- ning a gnme last yea!', has trimmed :both Alfred and RPI this season. On this basis, the Dutchmen should win over Ho- bart. • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • .. • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • 11 Hobnail Oxford a fresh approach in shirtings ...

Eales missed on two pa,sses but his third to Holland decided the ball game. Eales capped the 49 yard scoring effort With a fake hand.off and run for· the extra two points. From this point on, the game turned into a punting duel be- twe-en Union's Chuck Hanle an<l Rensselaer's Steve Horn.

President Davidson has pointed out that the reason for including. this restriction W.J.S that in pass- ing on the salaries of the faculty, Division Chairmen who are not also department chairmen are put in the embarrassing situa+ion of having to rule on fisral mat- ters concerning their academic su,perior'S. He indiolted that 5ince Division Chairmen serve a terrn of three years, no immediate ac- tion will be taken to force the resignation of present chairmen. Fur-thermore, if t h e faculty chooses to elect a chairman who is not also a department head, Davidson, will appoint another man from that division who does meet the qualifications laid down in this proposal but who wi'll only be called upon to vote in relation to the afore mentioned financial que.'ltions.

The show, con- sisting of thirty-five pieces, will he shown in Old Chapel from Oc- tober 29 to November 18. The purpose of thf' exhibit is to show that early Amet·ican art was original and never standard- ized under the prevalent European school of art .of that period. Sev- eral anonymous pieces, that were painted by eal'ly itinerent artists that will be shown, were termed by Wayne K. Nowak, Professor of Art, as curiosity pieces. Also included in the show are the paint- ing of Lewis Eilshemus and Al- bert Rider, both early American expressionist painters. Of local interest is a painting by Samuel Vedder, who spent his youth in Schenectady. He later became a renouned \Roman- tic painter\ in Euro·pe in the late nineteenth century. He is now being rediscove!'ed by art enthu- siasts and his pieces are quickly becoming collectors items. The b:,ow includes only original works of the period as opposed to the Victorian School of painting, which was prevalent at that time. Nowack feels that although the art is provincial, \it is, in its -own way sophisticated.\ This show of oil ·paintings and water colors is being shown in conjunction with a future show of modern .Ameri- can art in the twentieth century. ---0•--- Room rent of $75,00 fot· fresh meu and upperclassmen and the Board Fee of $110.00 for fresh'ml\n for the sc!'ond half of the cw·- r·ent Sellllester Will be payab1e at the business office between the dates, MO<nday_ October 31 and Saturday, November 5, inclusive during the hours of 8:3() a.!nr.- noou and from 2 jp.m.--t p.'llr.

A Better Place In Which To Drive The traffic court' proposal which was tabled by the Student Council at its last meeting on October 18 repl'e- sents the basis for an intelligent and workable attempt to alleviate the distressing state of Union's vehicular ills. An effective traffic court would consist of seven men who would judge the appeals of student automobilists, including those accused of illegal parking and speeding. The court would be a standing committee of the Student Council and members will be appointed by the President of the Student Body, as is the custom with all other com- mittees. The seven justices of the court constitute the Student Council Traffic Committee. This body has the additional responsibility of studying the long range aspects of the campus traffic problem, and making recommenda- tions to the Student Council whi()h would result in legisla- tion aimed at improving the general traffic situation. Membership of the court should be divided among the classes by the appointment of two sophomores, two juniors, and two seniors. The office of Chief Justice might rotate each semester. Any decision of the court cal'ries by implication the full backing of the Student Council. Errant student motorists could appeal their fines to the court, which would meet at two week intervals at a central campus location, such as Hanna Hall. The pro- ceedings would be conducted in accordance with generally accepted standards of modern day jurisprudence, and de- fendants should have the right to introduce evidence, cross-examine, or call upon wittnesses in their favor. Minutes of the court would be kept by a seGretary and a Concordiensis reporter would be present, but actual de- liberations should be confidential. The motion of October 18 provided for review by the Dean of Students, who could reverse a decision if in his opinion a miscarriage of justice had occurred. Similarly, a disgruntled student defendant could re-appeal his case to the Dean on the same basis. The inclusion of this clause in a motion to establish the court would, however, clearly contribute to the eventual demise of the court. Such a clause stril{eS at the very foundation of the court's exist- ance because it is a tacit admission that the court might easily, if unintentionally, evo'lve into a rubber stamp or- ganization. Since the court will be created by the Student Council and since it will be a standing committee of t}jat body it should obtain its full authority from the Council, and it is to the Council that any re-appeals should be di- rected. Although the possibility of a radar trap on Library Lane does not appear to be an imminent possibility to even the most apprehensive student traffic menace, effective student enforcement of traffic regulations would clearly 1·esult in an increased awareness of the campus traffic sit: uation .as well as the specific regulations and the conse- quences of their disregard. The traffic- court proposal should be regarded as a positive step forward in the tradition of responsibile stu- dent government and not as a mere Parkinsonian delega- tion of bureaucratic power and function.

Kermedy During the past 30 days the energetic young men and women of the Young Democratic Clubs of America and other branches of our campaign organization have been canvassing neighbor- hoods, campuses, farms and other living units throughout our nation. They have been engaged in a sus- tained effort to locate and regis- ter as many as possible of the 8 million young men and women who are eligible to vote for the first time in a Presidential elec- tion, and to find· and record on the poll bo()ks as many of the almost 40 million other Americans who have b~>en eligible for some- time, ·but who nonetheless have failed to vote. All reports to date indicate that this drive has been highly successful. Whiie it is our objective as Americans to see that every citi- zen exercises, and is given a chance to exercise, his precious privilege of casting an American ba:llot, it is to the first voters of the nation-those who are eligible to vote for the first time-that I wish to address a few words on this occasion. Vote Oast for F.D.R. Casting your first vote in a Presidential election is a great and memorable experience. I can well remember casting mine for FrankHn Delano Roosevelt in 1940. I am very proud of that vote, for F. D. R. was one of our na- tion's greatest Presidents, and his election in that year '\Vas instru- mental to the cause of Allied victory in one o,f the greatest struggles against tyranny the world has ever known. I know that you want to be able to re- member your first vote with the same pride and sense of import- ance. Today, the young men and women of America have a greater opportunity than ever before to help shape the course of human affairs, for the world is changing rapidly. The old era is ending. The old way will not do. All over the world a new gen- eration of leadership is emerging -new men to cope With new prob- lems and new opportunities. These younger men who are coming to power are n()t bound by the tradi- tions of the past, men who are not blinded by the old fears and hates and rivalries-but men of vigor and imagination who can cast off the old slogans and delu- sions and suspicions. Nations Emerge but a)so our unemployment; the r-evolution of farm production, which could bring the eventual elimination of hunger in the world, but Which so far has only Lrought disaster to the farm fam- ily; the revolution of our explod- ing urban populations which brings with it the problems .of overcJ>owded schools, urban blight, and crowded ·slums. There is the revolution in education, which sees more and more of our young people ·going to college, while 2/3 of the world's population still remains illiterate; the tremend- ously exciting revolution in space, which will soon carry man to other world::; undreamed of; and the· equally exciting and morally refreshing revolution for human -rights for all citizens here at home. ·we must start, in America, to pay a good deal more attention to our young people. We must start to plan much more system- atically to open up the channels· and to provide greater opportuni- -ties for each young American t<> develop his· own God-given talents to the fullest of his capacity and his initiative. Above all we must provide the kind of leadership which will challenge the very best that is within our young people, and will .guide them t<> the ex- ecution of the vital tasks which the common welfare of men on earth demands. Fo-r this reason, I have pro- posed a progra:m to create a new frontier of opportunity for young Americans by: Substantially expanding our rate of economic growth to pr<>vide -TIME I'H Take You down • • • To buy the W.edding Ring at Maurice B.

It as- sumes support by students and papers throughout the country, but as of now this has not been the case. While support has not been nil, it certainly has not achieved the encompassing heights it did in the past year. The possible rea,.ons for this lack of support are many, but it is doubtful that the answers ad- vanced by Southern papers are valid-thilt the sit-ins of last year wer.e a fad and that American students have grown tired of this new play-thing. It is more likely that .students movements of any kind must be underplayed at the start of any academic year due to immediate problems of the new vear. It would be expected that momentum would soon 'be in- creased as the year advances, and such seems to be thl' case as is evidenced in Atlanta.

They can use one of thier players as a messenger to take in signals be- fore each play, and/or they can rapidly alternate passing quarter- back.s with defensive or running quarterbacks. The substitute, whose first re- sponsibility is to tell the team what play it is to use next, is ·merely passing on a decision made by the coach, who may be sitting in the press box lhanipu- Iating his automata by teleJJhone.
