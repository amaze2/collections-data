Will Test . Our Mettle Says President Martin By PRESIDENT HAROLD C. MARTIN Five conditions will make the coming year at Union College a te'st of everyone's mettle. We will all S'llrvive, of course; and the11e is a good chance that this year wiLl yield as much in satisfaction as it requires in patience and ingenuity. Living with change is normal enough out in the world, and the college enclave can afford occasonally t() sacrifice its comparative orderliness ~ for the sake of getting a good deal done all at once. Silver Lining \' I ) f . The most ephemeral - and in some ways the most annoying - of the con- diti(>nS peculiar to this year has to do with housing. When the Trustees ap- proved enrollment projections ov:er two yeal.'s ago, they th(>Ught the new dormi- tories would be ready this Septernber. The strike of last summer stretched the prospect to late fall, and a series of shortages, especially of skilled labor, ha.s r! now pu\Shed it into winter. We plan now to occupy one of the two dormitor-y units aiter Christmas recess and the other a month or so later. In the mean time we shall be .crowded, some w.ill be camped in temporary college hous:ing, and a good many wiU have for.aged for quarters in the city. The silver lining is that Union men will be able for the next four months to swap stories oo pioneer hardship with the girls at Skidmore. ( \ The four other conditions are not temporary, and all are more important than crowded or inconvenient housing. These four will become a way of life here so quickly that everyone should savor their novelty while he can. A col- lege generation is short, and in three or four years there will be no one but faculty here to remember h{)W things were \in the old days.\ New Calendar !li First of the four in obviousness is the three-term calendar. From teachers' and students' point of view, the principal discovery about i<t, no matter how well the fact is known in advance, will be that ten weeks pass twice as fast as thirteen. Slow starters may just be getting steam up when final examina- tions show up down the track; moreover, there won't be any convenient mid- term grading way-station to r()use the sluggish and warn the unwary. The rush will be illusory, however, since the course load is forty percent lighter. That is the poittt of the change: more time to spend on fewer courses each term. The freshmen, starting without any history of another collegiate system, will have an advantage; perhaps we ought to invert the usual order of things and let them set up some how-to-study-harder-on-fewer-matters seminars for upperclassmen. Comp Eel Another continuing condition concerns Comprehensive Education. Of the making of new courses there i's no end, so the introduction of a spate o f new ones under an inclusive title may mean little or much. In one sense, the pro- gram in Comprehensive Education has already accomplished a good deal, even be f ore a single class in the program has met. The whole faculty body has in one way or another had its say about this program, and more · than a third have for some time been actively engaged in designing the courses. If the courses work as planned - and we believe they Will - the main change will be in the demand they make for direct and vigorous participation. They attack the single toughest problem in collegiate education - learning the language, the modQS of inquiry, the substantive and procedural tests of di-fferent disciplines. Simply talking about those matters will not elucidate them; they have to be wrestled with, and intellectual \vrestling is what we hope will most characteri ze the courses of this new program: each man a Jacob, and his dark angel the mysteries of a discipline unfamiliar to him. The third condition has to do with faculty and staff. There will be twenty- Continued on Page 2 F,ootball Fortunes: Davidson and Fox Houses as they looked a s h ort time ago. Summertime Is Building- Time By S. BISONE':ITE Union College is now drawing into the homestretch of the most ambitious building program in its his t ory. The two dormitories, two classroom buildings, and the steam plant cost over $ 7.6 million, inc r easing the value of the college plant, n ow valued at l3lightly under $11 million, by over two-thirds. The dassrooms buildings will house the Centers for Hum a ndties and the Social Scienc e s , and contain, besides classrooms, f a c u lty o f fice s, 'Small audi tor iu m , an d a ne w language lab. It is the first new academic build ing on campus since 1 9 26 wh en Bailey Hall was c omp le te d. The comp let ion of these two buildings and the colonade wh ich will c onne ct them to the library very nearly comp l etes t he o r igina l Ra m ee p l an for the cam pu s, first in the e ar ly l!fth century. Haze Days Memorobilia Dept. by Barry Newman When the c!ass of 1967 first unp acke d its regulation stu dy lamps an<l. busily set .about papering the wai:ls of West College cubbyholes with \ Playboy\ fold- outs, we WOO'e drippimg with iime-honored tr adi tion as much as any bun :: h o f freshmen. Some of us were eve11 · gun..,ho tradition. Everybody, f rom the admiss•ions officer - W'hoon we strove to butter-up at O'Ur interview - to the or1entattio-n counsellors :raved endlessly about things like Cheste.:r Avthur an d the Terrace Wall. It was pretty impressive to be a:t a college whose graying buildin g s lit erally oozed with gooey .ceremony and ancient ritual. Tradition But the class of '67 was probably more aware of tradition than any to :f()ll!O'W i!t, largely because of oQne practice in particular ·th. ·a t somehow surpassed a.ll others in ke ep ing the p ast a.live and school spiciJ t tingling.

Fr e shmen beanies we1 · e required to be worn aJt every oc ca. s · ion, a nd were expected t o be dU: tifully doffed whenever the humble wearer crossed p at hs with a man of superior rank .

The firs t is to become part of the public sy ste m of higher educ a tion , poss ibl y in a special ro le , &u c h a s o f an 'honors' college. The second is e·s- sentially to co n tirme the p re sen t co ur se as a private undergl'a du ate in - s t itu tio n, elimin a t ing, or a t le ast no t expanding, gr ad uate off ering .

This year's Floodmen will have a tough time matching last year's 4:-4 record. Hard-hit by graduation, it will be a relatively inexperienced ele1ren which will take to the field. Only seven sen- iors and eleven juniors are on the 43- man squad. Injuries further cloud the horizoQn. Losses Hurt Greatest loss was the quarterback TO'm Hitchcock who held every game, season and career passing reco:rd and ranked second nationally among small- college passers. George LaPorte and Marc Hurlburt, the former number one small college rec ei v . er, wer e Hitch- cock's fav()rite targets and their loss will also be hard to make 'llp. Paul Woodell, Fred Hay, Bob DeMichele and Tom Morgan al'so graduated. One unexpected loss cam e in the transfer of Jim Williams to Carleton College. Among the returning players, Jim Ramich and· · Bob M ars hall seem, likely to be among •the top players. Five-foot-nine, 190 pop.nd :Ramich will hold a berth as halfback. The only return i ng backfi e lder, he· may see two-way action before the y ear is out. He will probably g·et more of a chance ~ to run this year than in his two pre- viou s varsity ·s easons, because the l{)ss of Hitchcock will force the tea.m to stay on the gr ound mo r e th~ it has · · ~ :~· in the past. Last year Jim canied for 607 yards in 110 carrier, a 5.5 yard average, and picfl e d up 78 points in thhteen touchdown-s, 24th am0ong small-college runners. Quarterback Qf!estion Bob Marshall ha s tied up a spot at tac kle . At six-feet-one and 215 pound's, he is almost a sure bet to see a lot of action while going both ways. He has speed and stamina to last the full 60 minutes, both rm•e for a player his size. The big question mark is the quart- erback 'slot, with three candidates try- ing to fill Tom 's bi g shoes. Williams was expected to be the prime candi- date but now the n-ames are Bob Utecht and Frank Pizzica, both jun- i ors, and soph George Goth. Junior Sam Dill and Sophomor e Tom Oberst look like probable men of the line. Dill foll o ws a father and br othe r on th e Union gr idiro . n. He caught 16 passe s for 222 yards and three t.d! s last year. Oberst was a stand-out on last year's frosh te a m and seems to show the potential to be - com e one of the school's all-time line- men b ef ore he graduates. Near the Top Doug Horan will be the probable s tarting c en ter for the Garnet. Oth er top men on the team will include Chris Cassel's, Jim DeNitto and Frank Fusick. The team will probably d{) a lot more running than in the days of the mi g hty Tom. This seems to su it Coach Flood's style better than the passing game he has used to take ad- vantage of Hit chaook. Doug Horan, a senior, will hold down the Garnet offensive center post. Last year he was a tackle regular.

Greetings Concordiensis takes pleasure in welcoming the Class of '70 to the ranks of Union men. The first year of anything is usually the most difficult, but this is especially true _of co_llege. N.ow, both your potential for success and failure IS more rmportant th~n ever ·before. And the responsibility for them is, agam; more than ever before bourne wholly by you. Perhaps some of you will have the chance to get a McNamara Feno·wship - and then you. c~n become o1:1r Saigon Correspondent. But the vast maJority of you will finish your four years at Union. And you will help deter- mine the character of the school. It looks like it will be an exciting year. After over four years of study, of suggestions and motions ~nd re- scinded decisions, the college is getting a new c~t;nculum. It is a great improvement over the old one! proVl~mg both intensity and fleKibility that were not earlier available. W~en Dean Allen left in August fur a sabbatical year at the Harvard La;y Library, he left behind a memoraDd-u1n with one poignant plea: never again sho~ld the College change administration and curriculum in a single . year. Ap m all, I would say that the shock (}f that double change has been b~rne Wl\th comp_osur~ enough to reassure us ab<mt the manner of our living w.th change aga.m thts year.

By _penmt- tbg these chang4:ls, the trustees and adm1ru~tr~twn ,has expressed a collfidence, although somewhat limit.ed, .con- fidence ill the ability of the students to make their own moral decisions. We hope that this commitment to per- · sonal responsibility will be expanded during the coming term. ;~ The development of the Department ?f Arts; the de- velopment of the new All College Council, and the new dormitories all prffiage a new age at the college.• But behind all the new systems and new buildings and campaigns arid everything els~, · fhe essential building ma- terial of an . edug;ational institution is people. And this means -that you \.Vill be one of the key stones in the s~ru<:­ ture: if you prove yourselves to be sound, then the likeli- hood for success is immeasurably strengthened.

He was also the chairman of tile ne~ly created All-College Council. \I haven't even thought about it,\ Pinson said. \I'll have to see what happens at the meeting!' He pointed to a possible conflict of interest if he took the job due to his position as h€ad of the student tax: com- mittee. He is the only person on campus with experience on that committee. The constitution of .the st11dent body does not provide automatic elevation of the Gollneil secretary to the chair, although he must act as interim presiding- officer. Rather, the C()un.cil elects a new pre'sidellt :fron the student body who then takes office immediately and completes the re- mainder of the term of office. Tllis individual need not be a member ()f the Student CC>uncil itself. Pollock Uninvolved 0. Edward Pollock, Dean of Students, said that he fas not involved in making the decision of who become-s new student body president. \'I think it is extremely difficult to face the election ()f a new student body leader at this time, but it is some- thing which has to be faced.' Marshall UnaV'ailcb/e Bob Marshall, present secTe-i;ary of the Council, sa.id that he was not available to ·takl.'l the job, pointing to his commitments on campus, including his position as co- captain .of .the football team. Problems \The meeting of the S·tudent Council to e'ect the new president has not been set yet,\ Marshall said. When it does, any member will be allowed to nominate students for the post. Any other student in the college can attend the meeting, although they would need special permission of th·e Council in order to take part in the proceedings. \The Student Council i~ ill b:oubl'e,\ he said. \Al- though I'm secretary, there's just. 110 1vay I can take the job of chairman. \I didn't have any idea. that this could happen two years in a row.\ Among the problems of the new president, beside chair- ing the Council, are the selection of committee members and chairing the All-College Council. This is the first regu- lar year of tile latter organization, and the president might be able to greatly influence its future course.

GAMPED QUARTERS-As a result of the housing shortage many upperclcssme11 find themselves crowded 3 or 4 in o room. Sharp. Housing Squeeze Creates Room Shortage Union is facing its mo.st severe housing problems in many yea1•s. With an increa:se in the ;size of the Freshman class, and the new policy banning off c-ampus l-iving, there is a marked shori:age of li:ving space. Upperclass Crowding In North College upperclass aotu- dents are crowded three and four in a room. F:res•lunen are occupying West College, Riehmond House, and most of South Co;llege. All availa.ble space on and: off campus is being util- ized by .the College, attd students are no'W living in f{)rmer faculty apart- Ir).entf! on campus and in several fac- ulty homes throughout the city . Because of the furniture shortage orienta.tion counselors were unable to liv11 with their stu<lents this yeaT, and thtl' college has lu\d to bort•ow from outs'de sources. Some have been ac- quired from Skidmore. A large number of upperclassmen have been aU&wed to live off campus for the duration of the first term) but apartments have been diffi:ult to find. This is due to the fact that landlords are reluctant to rent for just ten weeks. No Leases Students are looking toward the completion of the new uppercl.ass resi- dences to allevi·:ate the problem. Ac- cording to David Laird, assi,stalit to the Dean of Students, the south build- ing should be r.eady for occupancy by the beginning of the Winter term, and the north building should be ready three to four weeks later. Those students now living oft' campus have been advised rtot to sign any leases, since they wiLl be requil'ed to move on campus when the new buildings are t•eady.

Until the age of 10 all English chi'ldren receive the same education. At 11 years all the children \sit\ what is known as the \11-Plus\ examination. On the basis of this examination the children are divided betwel•n two different type·s of secondary ::;chools. Those whe> pass the \11-Plus\ are sent on to the grammar school where they general'ly prepar:e fot· entrance to University. Those who 1ail the \11-Plus\ are sent on to Secondary Mod- ern Schools where they receive a gener-al educa- tion and are generally trained to take jobs at the rompletion of their education. System Criticized This system of dividing children on the b11sis of an examination taken at the tender age of eleve-n has come under severe criticism ·in recent years in England. Under the weight of this crit- icism there has been an attempt to eliminate the \11-Plus'' and to put all children into what are known as Comprehensive Schools. The ruguments against the \11-Plus\ have generally bee-n along the following line·s: It is extremely unfair to those children who are late intellectual develop- . Only the elite travel this road. ers; and it sets 1.1p unnecessary class distinction·s between the more and less intelligent strata of the society. The defenders of the present system, a)Tiong whom I am included, tend to argue that the system giveti ample opportunities to late in- tellectual. developers to move to the grammar school after passing Ordinary or \0\ level ex- aminations. These exams are generally taken at the age of 15 Ol' 16 and are really the compl~tion 01 tne .bnglish student's gener-al education. The defenders of the present system also arg-ue that by spHttin!{ tht: more intelligent children from the swwt·t· l)lll'~. llw l'cvel of education avail- able in tlw granm~ar sl'hooh rnakl'S it an ex- tn•mely meaningful l'dUl'ational experien!'e. Hy putting all our P,1:ight children into grammar ~;chool, these people argue, we are increasing the· ~erwral educational .le\'el of the entire society. Elite Education To a ce1•tain extent this attitude is typical ·Of the entire system of English education. There can be no doctbt that England's educational policy is one of elite education-nut elite in the sense of the rich ·l>ut elite in the sense of the intelligent. On the other han.ct, the .American educational sys- tem tends to be ·geared towards ma:ss education, and we should not be surprised, therefore, if the average American university .student is not on a par with the average English university student. One of the main reasons for this is that in America the high r;chool education tends to be •Considered as ex:tremely unimportant since most of our high school students go on to a university~ ln England, however, the secondary school is con- sidere(l to be tl1e place where the majority of the population receives the major part O!f its educa- tipn. The English university is generally re- ~rded as being e:xclttsively the domain of those high-calibre gl'am:rnat· school students who are sincerely interested in ed11cation. But mPst im- portant is the fact that the British econe>my is not structured so that it i:s difficult to get a good job without the benefits of a university education. Northeastern U. Examines Modern Morals Colleges and univet\sities across. the country are talking about the morals revolution on .the cam- pus, but one university is doing somethltl!g about it. Contemporary Views l\'ortheastem L'niversity recently announced publiration <'f a unique book which dirlcusses both contemporary student views and traditional social attitudes toward such controversial topics as col- lege cheating, dating and sexpal behavim, student freedoms and accompanying responsibilities, and challenges to ·student religious thought. . Thus the pressure on young people to· attend the university is not as great in England as it is i'n America, 'so the people who do attend the univer- sity in England are general'ly the pe!>ple who ,,. sincerely want to be there. I think probably half · the people in America';; universities would very much prefer to be somewhere else if they could obtain good jobs without a university degree. Serious View RerauRt> of the fact that the university is gen- {'rally a li orne for a rertain e·Jite stratum of Eng- lish society, the pre-univNsity education is taken seriou\ly.

Yet for the most part, their music is completely wi • thin traqition since they employ standard chord progressions · (although Dav i s has simplified 'j;hem, i.e. modal jazz) . .So ·both men can't be placed either in the new music or mainstream categories . They are transitional figures, the Ravels and Debussys of jazz. N(}W · that we have . some conception of :he new music, we will have a common point of reference for future articles, no matter how v ague ilt is. This ~big­ uity can't be helped, for the new music goes in so many directions. ln the remain i ng article-s of this series, we ;\ 11 examine some of the musicians play- ing the new music, and the strengths and \ · ea k nesses of the music.

Then mus1c has a more \new music feeltng\ than th a t of This is a step in the right direction. With the new . rules in effect, and the stricter enforcement of them, the program will lose some of the farcical nature that has characterized it in the past . Nevertheless, this is a start only and should not be considered to justify the present program. Improvement , in this case, is good but not sufficient. Last year we ran a series of exposes on parts of the gym program, mainly on the rampant evasion of any semblance of athletic activity and on what we considered the unjust deprivation of a student's right to graduate. Apparently the first of these has been taken care of with the closer supervision and the institution of more teaching of sports by the staff. It is unfortunate that the department decided that the only place they could cut their expenditures in light of a cut in appropriations was in the time that the pool could be kept open. This seems to be a false economy to us. More unfortunate is the total lack of reform of the elements that led to Daniel McLister's forced stay at Union last summer making up his gym credits. Beyond the basic argument of whether the college has an obligation to advance the student's physical fitness or not, it seems that a college which allows a student to miSs · all the convocations so long as he · can scrounge up the money to pay a fine should not make graduation condi- ' tiona! upon attending a quota of gym classes. We feel that Union College has a duty to - end this unnatural emphasis on the body beautiful. The question is not whether good physical · condition is worthwhile or not or even if every individual should be reasonably proficient in two or more sports. It is . not, even, a question of whether the college has some responsibility to aid the student in achieving these goals. The question raised by the curent gym program are, essentially, · two. First is whether they are mose effective in achieving their own goals. And second is whether the goals that the gym department has set are reasonable or . not. These columns will in future weeks deal with these two points.

Preliminary Grant Acting on a preliminary grant :fTom 0EO of $24,000, community and >block or2;anizations are being established in bh<l impoverished areas ()f thl;l city and county. An emp¥·asis i>S placed on demands of the poor ;themselves for prog-:ra.:ms most potentially helpful. Nardolillo believes that a major task o-f the poverty program is re- vealing to slum -residents <the myriad servkes already at their disposal. When ex:i.ii'lting resourees are in ca- p~city use, the anti-poverty agency w1ll detect the defects in quality, and so:ve operationaf problems. Above all, the aim of the Schenec- tady program, according to the di- rector, will be to bring anti-poverty work closer to the people who are to ·be se1•ved. s~henecotady's poverty profile has a distinctly different shape compared to that of Al-bany, where efforts to achieve a coordinated assault on blighted areas of the South End and Ar,bor Hill have met w~th r(}ugh go mg. Poverty in Schenectady is scatttered throughout secti.ons also amply popu- la.ted by middle class families. The ~st clensely deprived area, admin- istered by a neighborhood settlement house of the United Fund ca.lled Gar- ver Center, comprises less than !h:alf Continued on Page 2 With regard to student rights, Pres- ident Martin ·said \By law, students have no authority at all.\ The Presi- dent pointed to their position in col- leg~ as temporary, .mostly. under-aged residents, who receive the1r education \without paying full costs.'' Analogy in Thoreau Going on to explain \What vou live for;\ Dr. Martin drew on Thoreau. \To leam how to live well enough ·;that one wi}l not die full of regrets,\ · as the Prestdent quoted, is a common problem which may be solved in part at least, by the college experience. ' President Martin felt that in the . ,.,,presence of somewhat shaky stand- ards today, Union is making \an effort to turn the curious interplay of re- straint and privilege that marks the college in its academic governence to good use in governence of the pur- poses that are higher than academic.\ Continued on Page 2

The section is also the most thickly populated in Schenecl.ady, with 1:0,000 families, 825 of which earn less than $3,000 annually. The middle income element in the Carver area are not represe·ntative 1·emnants of escaped national groups. A sizable proportion are young and without il1itention of abandoning the neighborhood, accorc:ling to Jacque\ynn Hurley, a worker in the area on the SCAP staff. Housing in Schenectady, again in eontrast with more glaring ills in Albany, is less obviously delapidated. Most dwellings in the Caner area are one and two family homes. Rows of tenements and decaying walk-ups common in Albany's South End are unheard-of, and even in the center of the \target area\ substandard hous- ing stands along side solid structures. The poverty population as a whole is proportionately less than in Al- hany. Discounts /.ntervention In the year and a hal.f since the program's incept!on and incorpora- tion, Nardolillo states, relations with the Federal government have been extremely encouraging. He discounts labeling Federal guidelines for use of grants as ''interventi-on.\ The director agrees that the OEO shower.s the Schenectady agen~y. as all others, with paperwork, but always with a \positive reassuring\ intent. f-Ie comments that problems in Albsny stem from the city's ins-istance on \a more structured\' poverty program. The process of initiating a poverty program in any city is a slow one. Once a program is unde·rway, there is no means of predicting its effe·c·tive- ness withi·n a certain length of time. Schenectady's director hopes that s·ometime in the hazy future the slums will d:sappear and .literacy will ·improve. For the present, Nardolillo believes a successful poverty program will ;pl·ovide needed services for all the impoverished of the city. Th~ agency will involve itself in anythmg that will aid the poor. Building Program • In a meeting of the Union College Pre-Med Society Tuesday, President Ea:rl Robinson revealed a new opportunit:o,.- for interested students to work at Ellis Hospital in Schenectady. Mrs. Moffett, Head Nurse at Ellis, offered Union Pre-Med 13tudents posi- tions as orderlies and as aides. in the .operating room, emergency ward and P·SY- clliatric ward. Students will have an opportunity to obtain valuable experience in a joh at standard hospital pay. Fourteen of the forty students present signed up. Openings are still available. Mrs. Moffett emphasized that all F~tudents who have no previous hospital experience will receive two eight-hour training sessions which wirl be scheduled later. The hospi.tal Would like ev~ry student to work at lea~;:t eight hours a week. This program was the result of an offer made last year by Earl Robinson to Mr. Noyes,. Assistant Director of the Hospital. Mt•. Robinson hoped that there might be suitahle open·ings for part-time help. The Personnel Office re- sponded' this September and definite arrangements were made. Patholog·ists from Ellis Hospital will lecture later in the year. Club mem- bers may make a series of field trip's to the Ellis Pathology Ward and a fe.w medical schools where they can meet and talk with admission directors. The Society decided to place their Ubrary of medical catalogs in one of the conference rooms which will become the Pre-Med .Society Room. The Society has now begun plans for a Spring L.S.n Symposium featq.ring lectut·es on the subject by various experts. Danforth Grants Offered Inquiries a:bout the Danforth Grad- uate Feilowships, to be awarded in March, 1967, are invi.ted, according to Dean Theodore Lockwood, the local campus repreself•tative. The Fellowships, offered by the Danforth Foundation of St. Louis, Missouri, are open to men and women who are seniors or re~ent graduates of accred~ted colleges in the United States, who have serious inJterest in col.lege teaching as a career, and who plan to study for a Ph.D. in a field common to the undergraduate coEege, Applicants may be single or mar- ried, must be less than thirty years of age at the tlme of application, and may not have undertaken any grad- uate or professional stud·y beyond the baccalaureate. · Approximately 120 Fellowships wHI be awarded in Ma;rch, 1967- Candi- dates must be nominated by Liaison Officevs of their undergraduate in- st~tutions by November 1, 1966. The • • Foundation does not accept direct ap- plications for the Fellowships. Danf·orth Graduate Fellows are eligible for four ye!lrs of financial as• sistance, w:•th a maximum annufll living stipend of $2400 for single Fel- lows and $2950 :£or married Fellows, plus tuition and fees. Dependency allowances are available. Financial need is not a condition for considera- tion. · Danforth Fe!Iows may hold other fellowships such as Ford, Fulbright, National Sdence, Rhodes, Woodrow Wilson, etc., concurrently, and wm be Danforth Fellow without stipend until the o•ther awards lapse. The Danforth Folllldation was founded in 1927 by the late WiLliam H. Danforth, St. Louis businessman and philanthropist. The Fo<Jundation's primary aim is to strengthen edu.ca- tlon through programs of feHowships and workshop$, and through grants· to schools, college·s, univel'siJties and other educational agencies.

Science Dean Dean James Pahn.er for the Center o~ Science and ])}!Jgineering is, despite ~1s young age C>f thirty-six, a scien- tist and engineer with considerable breadth of knowledge. Himself an electrical engineer, he recently di- rected a Pl'Oject simulating ·the actions and decisions of two groups of twe:ve-year-old boys. The resear.·h- ers were able to predict with reason- able accuracy the responses of the two groups to certain stimula. Dean Palmer came to Union from the University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma, where he was professor and director of electrical engineering and the direotor of the Systems Re- aearch Center. He is oollltinuing as Project Director of ·the Oklahoma Re- search Institute. Before teaching at Oklahoma, Mr. Palmer wa:s Chief Engineer of the l\Iotor Vehicle and Illumina,tion Labor- atory at the 1;Jniversity of California at Berkley. He· has in the pas£!; been a consultant for McDonneH Aircraft Corporation and the Stree•ter-Amet Division of Goodman Industrie.s. Al- though stili a practicing consuJ.tart, he says ·that he h~s· not had enough time for consulting 'in th€ two months he has been a.t Union. Built Facvlty Dean Palmer stressed that his teaching and administrative dut:es :~1- wa.ys wme before his consulting pra.:- tice, but that consulting 'is a \n:ca way of keeping up.\ Government anj private industry use consultants to help with problems that they would like to solve rapidly. Consultants are also used to developing cpncepts. The dean's areas Qf special interest are electromagnetic field theory and a rather broad 11,relJ. calle..d systems. He is going to teach electr,om-agnetic theory next term .. .At the 'University of Oklahoma he taught at o<Jne time or anobher almost every course of~ fered by the Depal'ltment Qf Electrical Engineering there. He says tha-t his g:rea:test achieve- ment at Oklahoma was \le:;tving them with a fac.ul>ty that is second to none in ele:::trical enginee·ring re~ear.cll.\ Lives on Campus He sees the principal difference be- tween the &(!ience departments a.t Union and his depal'tmen<t at Okla- homa is the fact tha.t ev:ery man who enters a Union Science de,part~ell.~ has a good chance of graduatin'g in that department, as opposed to a fifty percen:t mortality rate in each science depar·tment at Oklahoma. When asked what caused him to rome to a· small college after so niany years at a large university, Dean Pa.lmer cited the fa\t that most large universities are broken Up into smaller manageable parts, so that the dif- ference is not really so great. He did Sltate, however, that he prefers sma:ll classes and added, \I think that the amount of information exchanged in a c'as·s of three hundred .students is absolutely zero.'' . Dean Palmer is a graduate of Ea.st- ern High School, Washington, D.C. He earned his Bachelor o.f Science l·n 1955 and his Master of Seience- degree · in 1957 from the Universdty of California in Berkley. His major for both <legree·s was ele·ctrical en~ gineering. He received his Doctor. of fh!losophy degree in 1963 from the l,;n'versity of Oklahoma \with ·a major in electrical engineering and minors in physics and mathematics. Lives on Campus Dean Palmer is married and has three ~ons, all of whom are enrolled in the; Schenectady Public Schools. His w:ffe is a registered nurse. The Palme~i> reside on campus at 17 Union AvenuE!. The !new dean is a member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engin~~ra, the American Ordnance Associ:Jtion, the American Society for Engine~nng Eduoat1on,. and the New York Academy -o:tr Science. He also belo)lg~ to .Sigmac Xi, Pi Fu Epsilon, and E·~!:l Kappa Nu.

The· new plant, which. con! tains 3 boilers one more than the present plant, has been bamshed to a less conspicuous spot on campus behind the language building. Present plans call for the old plant to be demolished by June 1, if the ·new facilities function correctly. Mr. Mcl!w.aine emphasized that all plans are subject to change, but that the college authorities hope to complete the work and al- leviate the housing shortage, as soon as possible. With the·se build- ings completed, if th~ college can secure the necessa_ry. funds, work may begin in the Sprmg of 1968 on another set of bu1ldmgs.

Martin then spoke on the pr·oblems of trust \in human affairs of corporate size.\ In an attempt to safeguard the new social rules from possible abuse on the three party wekend's, the President cal.ed ur:on Dean Pol- lock, the Pre.sident of the IFC, nnd the Chairman of the Stu- dent Tax Committee to \spread the activity\ of these weel<ends \over a larger number.\ He went on to defend the pro- hibition of two-wheeled vehicles on campus, enacted durilcg the sumer without student \wrest- Hng\ as a matter of public safe- ty ..

President Ma1tin also serious- ly questioned the value of fac- ulty evaluation polls and dis- el•aimed the \rights\ of stud.enrts to choose which of their tead'it: .. ers should gain tenure, tTik•-a. President noted that students lack the legal grounds to de- mand rights in the latter area and questioned their grounds in reason. A plan in which tenpl'le depended upon student approval would not be conducive to ob- taining or maintaining a satis- factory faculty. In regard to polls, the President felt that fa- culty might \become J.es:s than their best selves\ if worried too much by their popularity ra- tings.

Union Offers Students Varied Cantpus Groups . ~· The following· compilation describes a few of the many activities available tq the Union student. A brief description of their .plans and goals should acquaint the new student with their various functions on the Union campus. Moving Finger The Moving Finger, the campus organization designed to stimulate interest in the arts, moves intq its second year at Union with an expanded ,Schedule of activities and a hope :for greater student participation. Under the direction of Professor Curtis, the club has planned a diverse program ranging from poetry readings to performances by members of the Jazz Workshop. Arrangeme:rt,; have also been made for a cultural exchange with Skid\nore and Bennington. Tentative plans have been made to use the Rathskeller as the site for performances by folk singers, jazz combos, and other musicians on weekend nights. ·. Highlighting the first tetm''s schedule of eYents will hopefully be a visit by contemporary poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti to the Union Campus. A lecture by Comp. Ed. 10 Discusses Freedom And Authority The Union College Fresh1nan Commons Course in Humanities · ·- and Social Sciences (Comprehensive Education 10) will be launched this fall with \Freedom and Authority\ as its theme. Ten instruc- , tors from liberal arts (including the President and the Dean of Faculty) are each pUTsuing variations of this topic in their indi.v.id- . ual or joint ten-week sections. Their readings range from Ae·schylus ll.nd the Book of Job through Plato, St. Augustine, St. John, Sir Thomas More, Voltaire, Rousseau, Shelley, Thoreau, Mill, Carlyle, Dostoiev:ski, Nietzch¢, Lenin, Ortega y Gasset, Ernst ·Cassirer, Karl • Mannheiin, Reinhold Niebuhr, Kandinsky, Gide, Malraux, Camus, · and Sartre, to Genet and Mao Tse-Tung; in novels, :plays, essays, btography and autobiography; through description, analysis, satire, ahd polemic. , Comprehensive Plans In their ten-week course, freshmen will be writing between five apd ten short papers which the instructors will criticize individual- ).\• lx; since each instructor ordinarily will serve as his students' aca- p~mic adviser, all are being encouraged to have as much out-of- class contact as feasible. Instructors will make use of student pilpers in the course, ·along with discussion panel's of students and/_ · '· or faculty, readings <3-nd sociodl'ama, even \halJpenings.\ Other all--=\· \ campus events-plays, exhibits, movies, and so forth-will be a1'~ \. .:~< .. ranged or used as occasion warrants. ,, ~i' Outside Testimony '''l· -. Some of the instructors have planned their course together, and others will combine their classes at least part of the time; there \vill be use of expert testimony from other disciplines and other institutions. Four Commons Lectures will be given this fa!I for all students and faculty in the course, by pru:ticipating and other fac- ulty; one visitor to eampus coming to lecture will .stay a day or more to join in classes and in the informal d~scussion among the par~icipating faculty. With some robation of lectuiJers and instructors, the same theme of \Free.dom and Authority\ will be used in the wintef and s:p1ing terms of Comprehensive Education 10.

But what he 'has done to jazz is to do away with regu- lar and recurring chord ehanges. This g.ives the soloist a freerlo111 which is only limited by self imposition. New Jazz One must hear Ornette to really understand what the new jazz is all about. \Lonely Woman\ from one of Ornette's earlier albums entitled The Shape of Jazz to Come (Atlantic) is the altoist's most famGus performance. On this piece, Ornette produces a human-like sound from his instrument. The eff£'ct rreated is like a person talking to you. More about the alto and its players. There are others besides Ornette .who are cre- ating music on the alto. Men such as Marion Brown, John Tchicai, and Paul Allen, however, have fallen under ,Ornette's influence. This is not to ·say that they 1ue merely imitatrll's. They arc ~imply taking a fe\V of Ornette's ideas and are molding- them into their ow.n respeetive style.-.

The musician completely emerses himself in his music, and this reeling of involvement is conveyed to the listener . Eric Dolphy died two years ago. He was thirty six years old. (This is the Second in a Reries of Articles on the New Music.) Curtis Foresees v·ital Programs Professor Edgar Curtis, chairman of the newly organized Department of the Arts, said Monday that musie has lost much. of its appeal at Union by becoming too formal. He said the objective of the new Music Pro- gl·am is to make music \come alive as a vital part of the whole campus fo1· faculty .and students alike.\ . To realize this objective, a number of flhot·t, informal <•oncerts by the campus musical gToUps will be held at the lunch hour and at 4:45 during the year around the campus at conveni- ently located centers. . The College Orchestra, the Brass Choit·, and The Woodwind Quintet wil play a 10 concert toPr this re:u. The Glee Club, t .. e Dt.tch Pipers, aud the Football Band, all very active last year, have undergone the least change this year, due nctably, said :Prof. Curtis, to the exc::llenee and frequen<\y of their performances in the past. Th; Ja;,z Work- shop hopes to be competing soon wit'l the r tl'er musical groups for student attention and partici- pation. Those music courses offered reprcs(!nt a r~Yi,;­ ion in de!l'th of the music curricula in order to meet the needs of the new trimester s·1stem. A unique feature of tlhis plan is that any student taking mu·sic cout'ses will spend 1 hour p<>r· week per course listening to rehearsnJ.s of campu~ nm- si~al groups.

In an interview, he out- lined some of the Ideas he had and many of the responsibilitie·s incumbent in the office. Mr. Palmer stated that he wiU be involved with :the \articu:lation of the new curriculum'', and the development of intel'disciplinary programs. He defined these programs as those fields of study whieh do not come under the heading of a .partic- ular depa-rtment, but rather overlap two depart- ments. Among his other respon·sibilities are coOl·dina- tion of g.raduate, undergt•aduate and special pro- grams and the coordination of reseal'ch programs. He stated that at the moment there are only about three sponsored research projects, hut that 0thers Ul'e being planned. Faculty Recruitment The biggest problem facing the new dean, at the moment, is the recruitment of new farulty. Among replacements that have to be found,. is a replacement for Professor Clark, chairman of the Department of Biological Sciences, who is re- tiring at the end of the year. Dean Palmer noted that the Gentet· is having difficulty finding fully qualified faculty members. Among the plans for the future, Dean Palmer anticipates an increase in the amount o.f research activity, and the continued development of the evening g:raduate programs. He also expressed a hope that tht:J college would expand the entire g-raduate program, noting that thi's idea is pres- ently under (\Onsideration. · The Dean favors extension of the graduate p-rogram, and he stated that \the exisitence of graduate programs strengthens the undergradu- ate offerings.\ He stressed that this is hi's per- sonal opmton, and. that each of the· facu-lty mem- bers must decide for him~eolf if a ~l,l,\1 graduate program would str.engthen or hurt j;he college and its pre::;ent undergraduate offering::;. He felt, though, that the presence of a graquate •J program \lends an air of creativity, resea·rch in- tere•st and dedicration.\ i On Union College, itself, Dean Palmer's only comment was that \I am very iqJpt'essed by the , 1 intrinstc ability of the student bod.y.\ He con- · eluded by statmg that '\I .am looking forward to a very exciting year.\ ill ~· James Palmer, New Dean of Center II One bewild· I!' \I think tl Most guys classes.\ \The maj1 it was too s. >' to get to kn1 The above of freshmen thought eon1 .Many fre: ..maze of fa to uo:; too f: t' orlentation i week's time J ALBA~ Thea Jen: Ile:I1 :ladi ~ f?' ring . ., Pala: Tayl• t·ing SARA'.

My campaign is based on having been PaTliamentarian of the concil for the same runourut Sincerely yours, Willard S. Grant, '67 The present rules limit when women are allowed in the dormitories. We assume that the reason for this is not to limit discussion, the furthering of which was, and is, one .of the basic goals of the social rules. It seems a reasonable assumption, that these limits are to restrict opportunities for fornication. This newspaper neither advocates nor condemns forni- cation. We merely state that the decision on whether or not to engage in such behavior is higl>.Jy a personal matter. Consequently, the decision must, if it is to be meaningful, also be an individual decision. The college sh()uld not try to coerce the student in his decision in either direction. And this argument is equally valid for all other forms of activity which are essentially private and do not invade the rights of others. May I wish the best of for- tune to the new leaders and their round-Is for the challeng- ing months ahead. S:i:ncerely, Mor.gan F.

Thi·s work has· g: ven me some insight into the . pr<>blems whkh we mig(ht en~ counter in the first year of both of these innovations. Last year Mr. Ratner appoint. ed me to look into the possibili- ·ties of reform of the Student Council Strue~ure and its con- . stitution.

I communi, ~ated with Mr. Eal1'es th:s sum- Within this framework, we advocate a strengthened body of legislation to prohibit anti-social behavior which does infringe on the right~ of others. Women, for instance, should not be allowed in a dorm at any time if the room- mate desires her not to be. Obstreperous drunkenness should be banned whether the ubiquitous wristwatch reads 12 noon or 12 midnight. Time is not a pertinent factor. mer concerning the proposed changes, and we agreed on s•v- eral points. One of the most im- portant points of agreement was on the creation of the office o Volinski~s Views ·Student Council Com:nittee · Whip to acts as assi.stant execu- The conspiracy of silence, as Bernard Shaw called it, has surrounded this issue. It has shut off debate~ Dis- cussion has gone on and on, constantly circumventing the basic principles involved. We feel that the college should remove itself from this field of regulation. Students, acting within their liv- ing units, whether these units be dorrirltories or fraterni- ties, should be given full authority to devise their own regulations. Beyond these come the general regulations of the college concerning noise and such. Both should be fully enforced, because an unenforced law breeds con- tempt for law in general. But beyond this is the fact that the entire co:znmunity must take a stand on t!1e questions involved in the ques- tion of the propriety of the college placing restrictions on the privste and personal lives of the individuals who are students here. We challenge the student body and the administration, faculty and trustees, parents and alumni to take a stand. Only then can we build on the accomplish- ments of the past year. Student Council Four men have andounced their desire to become president of the student body. All are apparently moti- vated by sincere desires to serve the college.

Larries Whitewash DUt9hmen, 26-0, Ketzman Bolstered; Fi,rst Meet Oct. 12 Against Oneonta • '' 'J. \ Garnet Home Against Kings Point· Sat. Ta:king advantage of an inex.pex:ienced Garnet defen.si:ve unit, St. Lawt~ence scored four long touchdowns in blanking Union, 26-0, last Saturday. These four scoring plays accounted for half of the Larries' total yardage. St. Lawrence fullback Bob Rood burst through left tackle and went '72 yards for the gam.e's first tollchdown early in the first quarter. The conversion by quarter- back Metcalf was good and St. Lawrence led, 7.0. The lead meunted to 20-0 at the half as Met- calf hit Ticconi with a 25 yard touchdown pass, and Rood scored on his second long run of the day, a 76 yard run off left tackle. The final St. Lawrence seore came on a :30-yard run :by Mc- Feely midway through the last peridd. As the Iength of the touchdewn 1·uns indicated, the Un- ion defense suffered fr·om bad momenta1·y lapses. Union, although unable to score, mounted sev- eral long drives during the gamt:l. In the open- ing period aft.et· marching 72 yards on the steady running of Ramieh and James, t!fe'y'were stopped on a fourth down play at the one foot line. Later in the same period tailback Ji-m Ramich fielded a poor St. Lawrence punt and ran to the eight before being pllshed out of bounds. Howe•·er, two penalties ~et the Garnel back to the 27 where an iNtet·ception of' the Garnet's fi1·st pass attempt of the day ended the drive. Prior to Rood's sec- ond touchdown run the Garnet had mounted a fifteen play drive which was stopped on the LaiTies' 24. Late in the fourth quarter Union used fifteen plays to march to the La1Ties' 4 where the .drive was halted by the final gun. Throughout the day Union moved the ball well on the ground but was unable to break away for the .tong run m•. to:com- plete the important pa;ss. · . . ·•·· -•~· · , 1 Coach Flood was not overly discouvaged by the lopsided score, pointing out .. that.J;l.a~ch. an~ soph- omore fullback Joe James.were a:bl~ to gaiP.tt COll• ·sistently .through a very· hi~[.,.

Although the team will open away again·st Hamilton Saturday with five seniors, fifteen jun- iors, and SE:Venteen sophomores, Coach Evans is looking fonmrd to much more exciting play this season. For example, last year the squad lacked height at the halfback po~ition, this year no such problem has been encountered so far. In prac- tice, the boatmen have shown sharp passing and good midfield pusition play. Greg Olson, Jim Wilson and Larry Mae Farland, and Mark Wein- traub have been cited as a few of the soccer team's outstanding kicker's. Both Wilson and Weintraub are sophomores; MacFarland is a jun- ior, and Olson is a senior. Showing great poten- tial so far also are Sophomores Dave Barton, Dave Pattinas, and Mike Solomon. According to Coach Evans, the major weakness of the squad ap•pears to be the lack of depth in the front line. The team does have an adequate supply of halfbacks, fullbacks, and goalies thQugh. Attestmg to the team's great expected potential' is the fact that in a scrimmage with the Albany Italian Soccer Club, the squad scored more g()als in the first half than last year's soccer team scored in the whole year. Coach E•·ans hopes to better last year's record of :1-7 ~nd an average of only 1.2 goals per game. He believes that a strong effort in the opening g-an:e would play an important part in a drive for a winning season. It should also be noted that the soccer team is in need of. a fulltime manager to c;gver th€ scheciule of 7 home games and 4 away games. t.\ * :!\ \\A l'lSITY SOC'CER ~CHEDULE Octobt>r 1 Hamilton ............. away ii Oneonta .......................... home 7 Alfred ............................... home 12 Middlebury ........................ away IIi R.P.I. ............ home 19 Rochester .......................... home 22 Hobart .............................. away 25 Vermont ......................... .away 28 Tt·inity ..... ...... . .home November 4 Clarkson ................... .. . . ... home 5 St. Lawrence .................. home Frosh Hooters Face Northwoo,d Wed. The freshman soccer team will open its seven- game schedule next Wednesday with a h()me con- test against Northwood at 2:30. Thirty-seven f~·osh hooters began practice a week ago and have looked good ·so far. Aided by 33 candidates boasting previous ex- perience and 3 extra practices due to the cancel- lation of tomorrow's scheduled opener against Hamilton, C()ach Benson feels that this year's team has the potential to ma.tch the nne 5-1-3 record posted by last year's frosh squad. Since Co'!'ch Ben:son has staged only one intra-squad senmmage so far, he has not yet decided on a sta1ting lineup. However, he mentioned that c.:~n~er-fo:r;war(i Jim Jennings, center-half Brian G1llte, left fullback Steve Ferber, and right-half- back Bob Mac Kenzie have a good chance to start. Coach Benson rates this yem··s team high in speed and ballhandling which he feels could give the team the confidence to be a winner. Answer Fro~n Baltitnore To the Sports Editor: It was with great pleasure that Concordiensis' fabled mys- tic, Paul Grayson, misplaced those healthy heroes of the dia- mond, the Baltimore Orioles, in his predictions of the American League pennant race. The Orioles, better known as the finest club in baseball, found themselves with a .pennant on Opening Day; howe,ier, it took them up unt:l lasL week to make it official. With powerful hitting (the bast in the League) and with superb fielding, tht-y walked away with all the marbles. Four men a~e mu~t impurlJ.:tt in this lack oi' a pennant ra.e. They were Frank Robinson, Brooks Robinson, Luis Aparic'o, and John 'Boog' Powell. Be- tween them are divided the rea- sons the Orioles mauled the rest of the Lea3\ue including New York. Their timely hitting and flawless fielding advanced them into the rani(S of 'those far above mortal men.' Between them, they gathered over 380 runs hatted in, and a fielding percentage that will give each the Golden Glove Award. The only weak spot on the team is starting pit~hers. Due mostly to chronic injuries, the Orioles were able to set a record of least completed games by sta1ting pitchers on a pennant winning tearn. It was through a dynamic bullpen that the Birds were able to ca ptut·e many vic- tories. Ed Watt. Stu Miller, and Dick Hall must be credited with much of the team's success; their ability to rise to the oc- casion was an enormous assist. On~ cannot overlook the in- fluence of the Oriole's .manager, Hank Bauer. Bauer, an ex-Yan- kee, guided his flock of Bird.s with the brilliance of Don Shula (Baltimore Colt 'football coach). Having been Manager of the Year in 1964, 11e brought his ball club from its 2nd an4. 3rd place fini·shes in the pas.t two years to the pinnacle of baseball. His excellent performance has cer- tainly deserved him Mlanhger of the Year in 1966. . · But the key reason to Oriole victory celebrations this year has been the acquis1tion of !<~rank Robinson during the win- ter. Robinson · h;fs spal-ked this · ball club with his enormous bat, his. dynamic personaHty. He leads the League . in all depart- m~nts and wiU probably be the Triple Crown winner, the first In ten years. Most certainly, he will be the .. Most Valuable Player in the Leag:q~. AU in an, the Orioles, who are waiting to see who the. Na\!;t.q:qtl-1. League represen:tath~e will be,· are sure to win the World Series. In' five games, the Orioles will find the most prized trophy in profesisonal sports in the showcase at Memorial Sta- dium. Their bating power and fine relief-pitching will defeat any challenger.

These were blamed on the pres- sure of the opening .:~arne, the difficulty of th~ squ~d's sophom,ores,ii?-'adjusting t~ the g3;me sit- uation;· and the. numlier of veterans playmg un- familiar po·sitio\n:s on the defensive platoon. ·-Union goes into Saturday's home opened with Kh1gs Point; a derided underdog despite Kings Point's 48-8 beating at the hands of Temple last . Saturday. Kings Point di-splayed a good quarter- back in Hanford and also displayed some adept teceivers. Coach Flood is not planning any offensive changes for Saturday's game. Bob Utecht is st:ll the first string quarterback. In Saturday's game, Utecht attempted 12 passes and completed 2 fo1· a gain of 15 yards while sophomore 'George Goth attempted 17 and completed 5 for 40 yards. There may· be some c'hange·s in the defensive unit, but they· will not be decided upon until later in the week.
