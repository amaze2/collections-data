This measure raises annual tuition charges to a --:\'new high of $1400. I Both liberal arts and engineer- ing students are subject to the new tuition schedule. The Board has not yet decid·ed on inc1·eases fol' room, board charges and the general fee. COACH J.

Tuit- ion charges for the academic years 1955-58 were $800 for lib- eral arts and $900 for engineer- ing. In 1958-59 tuition was in- ~reased $200 by the Trustees, bringinl( the chargl'S up to $1000 and $1100 for liberal arts and engineering respectively. Tuition costs in 1960 were agnin in- creased, this time by $50. Last year, tuition was further hiked to $1250 for the presE'nt academic year. Examples of tuition at other eastern private'ly-endowed col- leges fo1· next year are: Am- herst-$1150, Wesleyan-$1400, J;,afayette- $1450, Bowdoin- $1500, Dartmouth-$1550, and Bmwn-$1600.

Barry 'VE'insteln Decision and Revision With the opening of the 1961-1962 academic year, Union College is about to enter into one of the most forma- lethargic student body in world trouble spots through. a weekend of seminars similar to Yale's Challenge Program. Ultimately, it shoufd kindle what small interest in world affairs lies deep within each of us and hopefully will result in an actively informed student body. A Jilrogram such as this, however, will not be successful :merely through the support of the faculty and administratim1. The final meas- ure of its success will come from its effect and support by the student body. Cause and Effect Each year about three hundr-ed freshmen enter the gates and ivy clad walls of Union and each year about 250 seniors gradua~e receiving· a degree and fond farewell. Though these are proba:bly the two most dramatic events of our college experience, they are not the most important. It is the four intervening years which make the academic experience a valuable and profitable one or a waste of time. In view of the recent world events-the frulling of the first of a series of thermo-nuclear bombs six weeks ago and of a light aircmft bver African marshland one week ago--we must, if only out of fear, review the purposes and the ef- fect qf our education. But to do this our education must have a purpose and our academic experiences must have an effect. This is the potentia.! of Union College, and it is we as students today who must decide upon the purpose, and we who must work for the effect. The world awaits our decision. tive years in its history. The Board of Trustees has set a .--------------------- ....... _._..., mode of introspection and revision through its eleven task forces, established to review and formulate a basic plan of the aims and direction of the College over the next decade. · In line with this spirit of introspection, we feel that several problems which were ~iscussed in this column last year mer·it further consideration by faculty, students and ad- ministration. They are as follows: 1) The Reading Period: An interval of one day be- tween classes and final examinations followed by only one week of exams does not allow sufficient time for any stu- dent to properly correlate a semester's work into a mean- ingful whole for eaC'll of five courses. If the students are to assimilate an integrated and meaningful education, the fa.t.:ulty must recognize the need for a reading period. 2) The Small College Tradition: Union is a small school and as such should not attempt to compete with a large university for it inevitably must lose. However, in this year's course schedule, several changes in the direc- tion of a university type education have been instituted. In several courses, one used to attend three one-hour ses- sions per week in a class of twenty; now the student at- tends two large lecture hours per week supplemented only by one recitation period. Under this system of education, the learning process has been reversed from one of in- formal lecture discussion to one of almost complete, im- personal formality, an atmosphere which discourages the natural questioning prevalent under the former system. In order to return to a small college tradition, changes such as the forementioned must cease, and those already made be returned to their proper perspective. 3) A High Quality Lecture Series: At the present moment, the Lectures and Concerts Committee must sched- ule eight lectures for the coming year from a budget of $700. If this budget could be increased, they undoubtedly would be able to. schedule a better lecture series each year. Then, not only would the program be more stimulat- ing intellectually to the student body, but more of the well known speakers would be attracted toward becoming a part of a high quality series such as this. Since the Trus- tees have not increased the budget, we have suggested that the Students take the initiative in improving the series by contributing toward it through Student Tax Funds. Poss- ibly once the Trustees see that student interest is present, they will assume their proper responsibility. 4 l An Honors Program: Since the demise of the three year, experimental, Extendible system, the college has offered no opportunity for the superior student to in- dependently go beyond material offered in the classroom. Although some may suggest that it is the curious student's perrogative to probe any and all topics which interest him, we strongly believe the college ought to provide a program which will bring these students to their full potential. Many other small schools have shouldered this responsibility through the institution of an Honors Program. 5 l Adequate Fire Prevention and Evacuation Pro- cedures: The lives of one . thousand students are in the hands of the colleg€ administration. At the present mo- ment these lives are not adequately protected, as evidenced by the chaotic evacuation of West College during last year's fire. We firmly believe that fire. drills are necessary to in- sure an orderly and complete emptying of any building in ~~L~i.n@rgency. Also ~el·dssar;-::::Cor complete protection is an 'automatic corlneclion ·'between the dormitory alarms . . . ~ . Davidson Reports: Far Eastern Education By Carter Davidson In December of 1960 Dr. Car- ter Davidson embarked on a tour of the Philippines and Formosa to evaluate the progress of the International l\1ass Education Movement. The IMEM is a pro- gram designed to promote adult education in such fields as liter- acy, agrifultural improvement, economic stability, and demo- cratic self-government. Upon his return, Dr. Davidson wrote se,·eral articles and was in· terviewed for the New York Sun- day Times Education Department. One of these articles appears in the current issue of the Reader's Digest Magazine and is quoted. below. Let field marshals of our for- eign aid program ponder Dr. Y. C., James Yen and his amazing- ly successful, and thoroughly tested, program for getting at the root of the pt•oblem of newly- developing countries. Members of our Peace Corps would also do well to study it intensively, spread it wherever they go. No other formula has beeu so conclusively tried and proved. Be- cause it enlists people's own aspi- rations and mobilizes their own private initiative for their own re- form, it is a dynamic force that utilizes resources s~arely tapped elsewhere. Already is has pro- duced in the Philippines what President Carlos Garcia recently called a \silent but glorious revo- lution.\ I first heard of Jimmy Yen shortly after World War I. The scion of an illustrious line of Chi- nese scholars, he had graduated from Yale in 1918, then worked as a sort of one-man Peace Corps among illiterate peasants in China's Tinghsien County. I knew that by 1936, through his Mass Education Movement, many millions of Chinese farmers and their families had learned to read and write. J was aware that a distinguished body of scholars had named him-along with AI· bert Einstein, Orville Wright, John Dewey and Henry Fol'd - one of our era's \ten most out- standing revolutionaries.\ In the Philippines last December my wife and I saw at first hand the meaning and dimensions of his \revolution.\ There are now 150 pilot villages of the Philippine Rural Recon- struction MoYement (PRRM), sparked by Jimmy Yen but mn by Filipines. I saw scores of vill- ages, formerly primitive and tumbledown, now transformed into healthy and properous com- munities. I saw thousands of people who had languished long in squalor, disheartened and dis- ease-ridden, now joyfu]ly accom- plishing their own uplift. Their pride in their achieve- ment was wondrous to witness. We found it difficult to get through the barrios (villages), with so many beaming villagers crowding around, eager to show us how they'd performed this miracle. The miracle of these villagers s:prings from thr!le p1inciples that Jimmy Yen considers .basic to any pro~ram for the underdeveloped: . First, the program must center Its effo1·ts. among the peasants, who comprise 70 to 90 percent of any undenlevelpped country's population. For here fester the discontents that invite commu- nism. Second, it must be a grass-roots ~ovement, indigenously led, in- digenously accvmpli,;hed, giving a challenge and a stake to every man, woman and youth. Third, it must work not piece- meal but simultaneously on all four of the major devils that plague C\\ery emerging people: pove~ty, disease, illiteracy, civic mertla. Communism's most effec- tive subversives, these must be exorcised before any lasting up- lift can be accomplished .. The story of Jimmy Yen's long and dauntless battle to exorcise them is one of the most inspit·- ing o~ our time. Jimmy Yen has ~ geni)JS for .ens;t~ring top men, mflammg their YISIOn. Soon after his an·ival in the l'hilippmes in 1?52 a number of prominent Fili- pmos agreed to guide the mo,·e- ment. Chairman was Dean Con- rado Benitez, the Philippines' best-known educational states- man. Cornelio Balmaceda, Secre- tary of Commerce in President Quirino's cabinet, severed all his other connections to become PRRM's executive head. Some of the nation's sharpest brains fol- lowed: ex-~ollege presidents and professors, healt~ and agriculture experts, eronom1sts and former government officials. All gave up higher-paying jobs. One problem was to find village workers to do\the grubby day-by- day barrio work. Yen asked \Why not in the college?\ ' \{immy they replied, \you don t kno.w our coll~ge kiqs. They \:ant white-collar JObs, big sala- ries.'' :'Let':=; find out,\ said. Jimmy. With his colleagues, he Circulated among the colleges. \You want your country to be great,\ he said to convocations of students. \But how can it be great with three fourths of its people im- poverished, more than half of them illiterate?\ He didn't make his plan sound easy. Rural-reconstruction work- ers must live with the banio people year around, win their con- fidence, share their d'aily life, he said. \Is that too much to ask of Filipino youth?\ Students responded eagerly. Soon, PRRM had 3000 volunteers. Of these, 200 were chosen for training: two months of tech- nical studies, one month of ap- prenticeship in a village, three months in a barrio. Of the 200 candidates, 75 survived the course. Today PRRM gets five time·s as many applicants as· it ean use. It costs less than $350 to train a worker; for maintain- ing him. in a bar1·io for a year, 1ess than $850.

Allen.has just returned to Union after spending a year teaching Bl\itisb History <1t the University of Aberdeen. He was, the first professor to participate in ,the new exchange program with Aberdeen, one of many' $Uch pl\ograms graciously made avail\ able by the college for its faculty. \Scottish youths are a year and a half to two years ahe•ad of tl;lei:~; American counterparts when they enter their .universities,\ states Professor Neal W. Allen, Jr., the first Union Colelge faculty mem.- ber to take part in a two way ex- change with Aberdeen College. Tl;le reason for this is that un- ,dergraduate ·e<lucation is more speci!dized in Sco,tland than in our country. For example, the student who. is working in his- tory, studies almost entirely . his- tory and related' subjects, such as poEtical science and economics. In .sharp contrast to this, Un- ion's 'liberal arts education em- phasizes a wide background of subjects and less experience in specialized courses. Scottish Classics Allen,. in comparing our educa- tions, also stressed the fact that a Scot from the northeastern part of the country, where Aberdeen is located, is a \classic Scot.\ \They're not very prone to in- formal discussion un.til you get to know them. They take their work very seriously.\ He described them as similm· in nature and outlook to the typical Yankee o·f northern New England. Like most other Scottish uni- versities, Aberdeen offers two un- dergraduate degrees: for th11ee years of study, the Ordinary, and after four years, the Honors. Allen feels that the ordinary is not as demanding in a formal sense as a bachelor's degree from Union or other similar American colleges. However, the Honors degree is nearly the equivalent of a good American university's master's degree. Merger Yields University King's College is the third old- est in Scotland, having been fuunded in 149::i. Maridchal Cvl- lege, founded a century later, is combined with it to form Aber- deen University. Students from northeastern Scotland, the Highlands, and the outer islands, including Shetland and Orkney, attend Aberdeen, ,, making it primarily a university . He pointed out that \It is not unusual to hear of a· boy who has come to the sity with a sack of oats to pay for his digs!'' Allen was accompanieQ. on trip to Scotland by his wife and their children, Rkhard, Marian, 16, Neal III, !1.4, and wai'd, 6.
