Expect Size Increase By David J. Volkman Dewey Hall Razed Jonathan Pearson III, Director of Admissions, has in- djcated that according to preliminary sig:ns next year's freshman class may be one of the largest and best in recent history. -----\ ~ The most promising indicator I seems to be an increase in a,ppli- : cations from superior students. 1 Whereas last year 550 were ac- 1 cepted, .this year 654 were ad- mitted. Along with these 200 were j put on the waiting list. Although there is no guarantee that these students will come to l\nion Pear- son stated that since there were so many more good students that it was diffieult to reject them. All departments increased its number of applicants except Engineering. W. H. AUDEN Auden Lectures W. H. Auden, one of the best known of the contemporary Brit- ish poets, spoke last Tuesday night in Memorial Chapel. In- troduced by Professor Carl Nei- meyer, Chairman of the English department, Auden did not con- fine himself to any one topic, but stated that he was just \going to chat.\ In essence, his chatting was an explanation and classification of the work of the poet. After brief- ly discussing the origin of the poetic arts, he attempted to de- scribe the relationship of poetry to the fine arts. Human endeavor may either be considered to be work or not to be work. Most poets, he explain- ed, are contented with their work and therefore do not actually con- sider it to be labor. It is this contentment with work that dis- tinguishes pleasure from labor. Every individual has a desire to reveal himself to others, ac- cording to Auden. The poet is no different and expresses him- self and his individuality through his art. A man's work is not only distinct from another's, but is, in a sense, also distinct from the author himself. Each piece reM fleets a new and unique part of the creator. Along with the possibilities of a better freshman class, the in- crease in the number of accept- ances also presents certain prob- lems. The increase poses the pos- sibility that the freshman class will he one of the higgest in Un- ion's history, possi·hiy getting as high as 350. Above Average Tea~ If any valid generalizations and comparisons can be made just from the acceptances, the teams of the Class of '67 should be bet- ter than average. The most :prom- ising sports seems to be basketball and swimming. Union has ac- cepted a starter on Linton's team, two first-stringers from James Madison in New York City, a team which is third among all city bas- ketball teams, and the second leading scorer from another city high school, Martin Van Buren. In· swimming, of the eleven men coach Turner has rated \A'' pros- peds Union has accepted eight. Pearson said that thesE;J boys are, on the whole, good students in addition to being athletes. \We haven't had,\ says Pearson, \these kind of basketball prospects in many years.\ In contmst to last year, the only team that does not look too hopeful is the football team. Counseling Program Begun Auden believes that fine arts and crafts such as carpentry are, contrary to opinion, essentially the same thing. Both the car}len- ter and the poet must create a definite work which meets cer- tain specifications. The end product, whether it is a cabinet or a sonnet, represents a success- ful, organized creation. Other developments- along the lines of admissions is a new pro- gram aimed at counseling the sons of alumni. Since its incep- tion and announcement the Ad- missions Department has received sixty requests about this new type of guidance program. The plan is two-fold. It is aimed at encour- aging more sons of alumni to ~orne to Union, an4 also. at help- mg place the sons of alumni in colleges other than Union. This service is open to all alumni who ha-ve sons over fourteen. It in- cludes bulletins indicating when V?rious tests are given and what tests should be taken. In addition it provides interviews and various college literature such as copies of the Idol and the Concordiensis. 8:30 Classes Maintained Pictured above are members of the grounds crew, busily engaged in removlng- the last traces of the ROTC inhabited Dewey Hall. A good poem, says Auden, is one that intensifies somet11ing that we believe. Whether or not a poem appears attractive to the reader depends upon the strength and competence of the author. Perhaps the most significant idea proposed was Auden's idea of the importance of originality in a lit- erary work. The ability to for- get originality and to concentrate on some subject interesting to the author himself is the secret of good Wl·iting. The excess empha- sis placed on originality is un~ called for and often harmful to the effect of the poem. .A.uden added that the most successful poets are those who are most in- terested in their subject. At the recent Faculty Council meeting a resolution was passed to continue the 8:30 morning classes until the fall of 1964. Both students and faculty had com- plained about the early eight o'clock classes that had been prev- iously decided upon. After 1964 the present schedule may have to be altered to fit the new b·i- semester calendar. The Faculty Council acted upon the issue of morning classes only after no ob- jections were raised by the Stud- ent Council. The noon-time hourly exams will be temporarily con- tinued throughout the next aca- demic year . Uni()tl College~s building . pJ:Q'....

It was also decided to eliminate the Tuesday, Thursday, and .Sat- urday 11:30 classes to anow time for convocations. The -change concerning the 11 :30 classes will go into effect in September, 1963. The move is the result of faculty complaints about the 11:30 con~ vocations. They dislike the sys- tem because of the diffi<:ulty of teaching the usual amount of ma- terial in the shortened period. HaJ;\der hit than the classes are the laboratories and the demon- st~:ation lectures. ( 0

Concordy Endorses: For the first time in recent years, Concordiensis is endorsing candidates for the offices of Class President and Student Council Representative. We feel that it is our obli- gation as a responsible campus publication to mae our views known to the student body on the qualifications of the candidates. In the past, Concordiensis bas only endorsed candi- dates for the office of Council President, feeling no neces- sity te evaluate the qualifications of individual Council members. However, the increased amo1:1nt of dissatisfac- tion with the Student Council's performance during the past years has made it necessary to select more interested and competent Student Council Representatives. If there is no change from the present method of electing Council members on the basis of a nebulous type of popularity, there is little reason to hope for an improved performance by the Council next year. Some of the members of the Student Council have recogni;z;ed the need for change in electoral procedure. At the last meeting, two amendments to the Student Body Constitution were introduced that would require a 2.0 index for all Council members and that would not allow any Council member to be elected if he had previously served and been expelled for lack of attendance. The Concordy candidate endorsements are intended to further assist those interested members of the Student Council and of the student body elect responsible representatives. Those candidates receiving endorsements have been chosen by a consultation of the Editorial Board of the Con- cordiensis with interested members of the Student Coun- cil. Special consideration has been given to the opinions of the Senior Council Representatives. The choices for Class Presidents will be stated this week, to be followed in the next two weeks by the selections for Council Representa- tives and for Council President and Secretary. L Class Presidents The Concordiensis supports Jeff Fulmer for reelection in the Junior Class. FuJ.:mer, who has been president of the Class of 1964 for three years, has served competently both on the Student Council and in organizing weekends for his class. Fulmer was running unopposed until yes- terday afternoon when Richard Berg announced his avail- ability as a write-in candidate. Although Berg's enthus- iasm and desire to provide the voters with an alternative are to be admired, his lack of previous experience makes it doubtful whether he could be a better president than Fulmer. Victor Fazio, President of the Sophomore Class, is running unopposed. He is completing his first term as president, having previously served as Council Representa- tive. In the opinion of the Editorial Board of the Concord- iensis, he is one of the ablest members .of the Student CounciL John Seifert, President of the Class of 1966, is run- ning against Nicholas Thines. Seifert has served ade- quately as president, organizing this past Winter Weekend and oft~~ serving ~s sole spokesman for his class at Stu.:. dent Council meetings. He has also initiated Nott News~ a freshman newsletter. Thines, while popular with many of his classmateS.(is lacking in experience in dealing With class and Council affairs.

Group Discussions Mrs. William Murphy, Presi- dent of the Faculty Wives Club, has pointed out that the club 1ltands ready and willing to ar- range such activities between the students and faculty members and their wives as the students might like. For instance, if a group of students were interested in spend- ing an evening discussing a par- ~iGular topic with certain pro- fessors and their wives, the club would be happy to try and ar- range it. The club would also arrange formal parties for the professors and students if it were requested. The initiative for these events must come from the students. The club does not wish ; to \meddle\ in any way in stud- ' ent affairs. Mrs. Finkelstein stated that any request will be met as far as possible. The purpose ·of the Faculty Wives Club as stated in their con- stitution is \to encourage associ- ations among women members of The club also sponsors a tea for Freshmen parents the first day of orientation week \To get them out of the boy's hair.\ Skellar Party Last November the club held a fund night in The Rathskellar. The party featured Julian Olf, the voice of Carter Da y;dson, and the answer machine program of Professors Nelson and Murphy: At that meeting students were kept out. At their next club meeting an elementary school teacher will demonstrate \New math\ teach- ing techniques with her 2nd grade class. The club also holds meetings \for intellectual advancement\ at which Professors speak on their specialties, and bring the wives up to date on vital topics of the times. Now, if the students want it, meetings for \intellec- tual advancement\ can be arrang- ed. Letters to the Editor To the Editor of Concordiensis: I am writing this letter to air my views and the views of the friends of Lincoln Mahacher. Line was a student in Union College, class of 1961. He was a brother of Phi Sigma Delta Fraternity and active in the college commun· ity. Above all, Line was well- liked and respected by all who knew him. Early in 1960 Line succumbed to leukemia. Soon after his death his friends estab- lished a fund in his memory. The proceeds of this fund we1·e event- ually donated towards \The Lin- coln Manacher Rare Book Room\ in ~he college's new Schaffer Li- brafly. The amount of the donation is not really important, but what is important is the fact that this room is now being partially used as an office for the lihra,l'ian, Mr. Tolan. The sponsors o:f tld-s fund donated this money on the premise that it would be used in good faith. The donors do not mind if the room is put to use, but we do mind when the use it is being put to is contrary to the nature of the original gift. When this money was donated no written agreement was signed-we had only the good word of the Boa1•d of Trustees and the Librarian, Mr. Webb. Mr. Tolan was given permission by the Board of Trustees to move his office into the \Rare Book ~oom.\ I have indicated to Mr. Tolan, President Davidson, and others concerned, that the donors are upset that the gift has not been used in good faith. Nothing has been done! Is Lincoln Mana- cher's memorial to be used as an office ? We do not wish to tie the hand~ of the college, but we do feel that our donation should have been used with the same honest intentions with which it was given. Om· hands. are tied-it is now up· to ~he students and the college ·community to make their opinions heard.

Jeff Fulmer, '64, defeated Richard Berg, '64, by a vote of 93-41 in a campaign that saw Berg use novel and spirited tactics. Victor Fazio, '65, running unopposed was re-elected President of next year's Junio!' class, and John Sei- fert, '66, was victorious over Nicholas Thines by a vote of 159-52.

Another candidate who is also worthy of serious attention is Jared Wolfe, presently the exchange student at St. Andrews.

He has been one of the best mem- bers of the present CounciL For the other four Council ·positions, Concordiensis sees five qualified candidates. They are Larry Dittleman, Tom DiCerbo, Phil Evans, Bill Mc- Govern, who is presently on the Council, and John Pe~ra. The sophomores will have the difficult task of choosmg from a surplus of qualified candidates. Letter to the Editor To the Editor of Concordiensis: At the last Student Council meeting it was proposed that it be necessary for a student to have maintained a minimum pve1·~an index of 2.0· before he could be 'a candidate for the office of Stud- ent Council Representative. This was amended so that an over-all 2.0 index would be needed in or- der for a student to run as Stud· ent Body President or Student ,Body Secretary, as well as Repre- sentative. This motion is to be voted on at the next Student Counci-l Meet- ing as .an amendment to·the .Stud- ent Body Constitution. If the Council passes it, it must still be ratified by a two-thirds v0te of the Student Body. Due to some apparent misunderstanding of the principles upon which this motion is based, I would like to clarify the reasot1s why it should be passed: 1) to insure that any student who is having trouble with his studies will not jeopardize them further by putting himself under the burden of a Council office· 2) to provide an indirect in~ centive to get good grades in order to join the Student CouncH; 3) to enhance the general im• pression of the Council in the eyes of the faculty and adminis- tration since members of the Council are in close contact with the latter two bodies; 4) to insure that \popular\ students who have little recourse to imagination, intellectual inter- est, or responsibility will have a check placed on their candidacy; 5) to enhance the dignity of the Student Council in the eyes of the Student Body; 6) to force a student to pro- vide a concrete credential as proof of a responsible outlook toward his undertakings, assuming that an over-a:II 2.0 index is a creden- tial of respo11sibility in ·the schooJis principal inte1>est: educa- tion. It is expected that respon- sibility in the field of scholastics will be carried over to partici- pation on the Student Council; 7) to p1·ovide a nominal schol- astic ·candidacy requirement in relation to the present all-men's index of approximately 2.4. 8) Assuming that a student has one, or even two, poor semesters, he wHI still have the opportunity to be a candidate fo:r a Student Councii ·Gffice since the 2.0 re- quirement must be an over-all index. If one assumes that the grades tend to get better in the upper class years '(or at least stay the same) then these \good\ grades are given greater consid- eration in determining the over- all index. Thus, \poor\ grades in the freshman year wilt count far less than \good\ grades in the upper class years. In short, the primary purpose of the Student Council is not only to efficiently co-ordinate, repre- sent, and sponsor student affairs, but to teach the Council members how to assume entrusted respon- sibilities. In all posts which re- quire maturity and a keen sense of responsibility, the candidates must display credentials of these qualities. Here at Union this is doubly true considering the care- ful scrutiny under which the stud- ents are kept. The orientation in which the Student Council now finds itself demands that the low- est common denomination of can- didacy credentials be responsibil- ity and intelligence. A 2.0 over- all index is certainly not too stringent a requirement to prove to the students that a candidate is capable of serving them well.

Folk Will Carlebach Singer Perform at Union Shlomo Carlebach, an outstand- ing musician and a unique per- sonality, will present a concert of folkmusic in Memorial Chapel this Sunday at 8:00 P.M. lV.h:. Carlebach is .a noted folksinger and guitarist. He has toured the U.S. and Canada, and has per- formed in London, Paris, Jeru- salem, and Rome. He has also put out a recording of a concert at the Village Gate. Unlike the majority of contem- porary entertainers to whom tl1e public glibly proffers the label ••folksinger,\ Carlebach has not corrupted his repertoire with commercial material designed to attract the unitiated listener whose interest does not extend beyond the realm of popular mu- sic. Although the wide acclaim which he has received has come from casual listeners as well as folk enthusiasts, his popularity is due to his exciting renditions, and not to any alteration of style or content for the benefit of the growing commercial folksong audience. His sincerity and dedi- cation combine with his unusual ability and taste and enable him to stir people unfamiliar with the Hebrew idiom in which he per- forms.

Clemens In Sunday's New York Times Magazine, there was a very inter- esting article about college mor- ality written by the editor of the education section. I feel that it has special applicability to Union whenever } 1·ead through the soc- ial i'Ules. It may be time to re- turn our social rules to the pages of Tennyson!s \Idy-Jls of the King\ and start anew. The chief rationale for the ex- istence of social rules lies in the concept of the in loco parentis con- tract, a sort of unwritten law or .agreement be- tween t)le coltege and the parents of students that the college act . as a substitute · · · parent. It is as- sumed by this that the college, in its mass legislation, must follow the same rules acceptable in soc- iety or in the world of the stud- ~nt's parents. Two faults creep m when such mass legislation is enacted. The college must make its rules as strict as those of the stdctest parent in order to fulfill its ethical ~esponsibility. This limitation is similar to that placed on literary censors who must gear tl1eip literary permissiveness to the !<>west common denominator the child. The second fa:!Iac~ crops up when we compare the moral mobility of a single set of parents with that of an institu- tion which mothers one thousand students. Concepts of proper be- havior can change with the par- ents of a single generation but a l~rge org~nization often' lags behmd the tunes because of its corporate clumsiness. The Times m·ticle makes the point that the freshman entering college today is often subjected to rules that wo.vld be considered ludicrous in high<- school society. The student is not at the mercy of his par- ents' morality, but that of a trus- tee a generation older than his parents are. Sign of Progress that are crumbling, and acres oi ]mtty-colored masking tape hold- : ing up bewildered-looking Ptay- ; mates of the Month. The oppor. • tunity of going· out into a fairly large city, picking an apartment, and making a solita1y go of it should not be depied ailyone. It . takes considerably more gump- tion than sluffing along at a fra- ternity house in the company of a group who are like you and will only reinfo1•ce your prejudices if' you let them. It seems rathe1· • silly to make off-campus living prohibited when so many live off campus now in a ·state of com-·· plete happiness without any re- cent reports of bacchic orgies or mass indecency. Periodical Revision If we must have social rules, · why not place the responsibHity of making them on the students themselves? To insure against the possibility of staleness, these . rules could be revised periodically , · as the feelings of the students change. It seems to me that rules, · made in this spirit would he the ' most likely to be obeyed, the most unhypocritical, and the most re- liable. The .present rules are fore honored in the breach than in the observance and simply serve as rather witty cocktail party talk when conversation bogs down. The understood ex-• istence of the in loco parentis agreement when it is not enf<Jrced is merely hypocritical on the part of the college and <>nly serves to 1 delude some parents who have no idea that they are sending their dear ones into our evil clutches. Finally, a realistic set of social rules would eliminate the nau-\' seating theatricals on the part of some students who must ham it up when they violate a rule no- body believes in anyway •. A littleJ. bit of honesty in this depa1•tment would go a long way toward re- turning Union to the province of reality. •,.

The Freshman representatives have had the poorest attendance record, have contributed the least to the Council's discussions, and have often been uninformed on the issues they have been voting on. Although the two incumbent Council members remaining on the ballot do have the potential to adequately represent their class, doubt remains if they desire to assert their leadership. The Concordiensis endorses John Beck- erman, David Braff, Forrest ' 4 Woody\ Bowman, Joel King, and Thomas Spencer for the Student Council. Dewey Hall is now leveled and signs of progre~s. are in the air. One giant step that this college can take would be to repudiate the substitute parent role in the catalogue, in writing, and state '!lJ?.equivocal!Y that it is not qual- Ified to wield the moral birch over one thousand students of varying backgrounds. This re- pudiation should take place not only in the social rules them- selves, but also in such doctrines as off-campus living. Nothing can entrench narrow-minded pro- vincialism like living in a fratern- --------------------------' ity for four years, and there are no civilized alternatives at Un- Ch Ph - Ps· E.· Cant pus Briefs The Dean's Team Presently it is possible for a student at Union College to be declared a N ott Scholar yet fail to be placed on Dean's List. This strange circumstance occurs because of the requirement that a student pass both Physical Train- ing and Convocation to make Dean's List.

The :J'nain problem is getting the students themselves to take an active in- terest in school planning and ac- tivities. He cites one example of this lack of interest as his dis- tribution of over 500 question- naires to the student body, of which only 4 were returned. An- other indication is that while 27 seniors ran for office last year only 9 ran this year. In spite of this, he believes that the student interest, however :low, is increas- ing. This, he understands to be due partially to the cove1•age WR UC radio gives to the Student Council meetings.

Advertising Manager Bflan Barefoot •6J Assistant ~pot·ts J<;ditor A New Era? In the recent Student Council elections, much was made of the individual candidates' desire to make the Coun- cil more responsive to the wishes of the student body, to increase the communication between the representatives and their constituents. With the results of the elections Monday night, we all looked forward to an \era of good feeling\ between the Council and the Student Body. It took exactly 24 hours for the Student Council to prove that this better relationship may indeed be difficult to achieve. At the Council meeting on Tuesday night, an Amend- ment to the Student Body Constitution that would require all candidates for the Student Council to maintain a 2.0 minimum index failed to receive the necessary two-thirds vote in order to go before the Student Body Meeting this morning. Whatever the merits of the proposal, and we be- lieve that this proposal did have some merit, the Student Council is acting extremely unwisely when it refuses to allow the Student Body to make the final decision on mat- ter'S of this nature. By taking the action they did, the Student Council is in effect saying to the Student Body that the Council, not the students of Union College, shall determine the qualifi- cations of their representatives. Whether or not the in- dividual members of the Council felt the Constitutional Amendment unwise, they owed their constituents the right to make the final judgment on the proposal. If as some members claimed, the overwhelming majority of the Stu- dent Body was opposed to the 2.0 requirement, surely the amendment would not receive the necessary two-thirds vote at the Student Body Meeting. Some representatives explained their negative votes by stating that if the Council passed the measure, it would be interpreted by most of the students as an endorsement of adoption. What has happened to all the grand promises about better communication between the Council members and their constituents? By explaining their votes to those who elected them, those Council members who did oppose the 2.0 requirement could undoubtedly have mustered the necessary one-third for defeat if there was even a fraction of the popular opposition that they cited. The new members of the Student Council have not yet taken their seats. Many of those who voted against the amendment will no longer be on the Council next year. It would indeed be appropriate for the newly electe.d mem- bers to follow their campaign promises and to attempt to make the Student Council into the dynamic organization it has not ·been in the past few years. Concordy Endorses: III Council President Both candidates for the office of Student Body Presi- dent have the ability to effectively lead the Student Coun- cil in taking a more active and responsible role in campus affairs. The work of Norman Lavery last year and Edward Skloot this year has placed the Council in a position where next year's president may finally be able to achieve greater accomplishments from the Council if he exerts the proper leadership. For this reason, it is important that the voters examine both candidates and their qualifications closely before making a decision for whom to vote. They must ask themselves what qualities next year's Student Body President should have. Should he be popular? a competent organizer? a person who is unafraid to speak his mind. and be candid at all times? a person who is able to manipulate various groups in order to gain results? The Editorial Board of.\'Sthe Concordiensis, having appraised what we consider to· be the important qualifications, endorses Lawton Mor- -rison for President of the Student Body.

Mr. Skloot has referred it to the CONCORDIEN- SIS for publication. Dear Ed: The members of the Board of Trustees of Union College have been informed of the petition from the students concerning the granting of tenure to Assistant Professor Danese, but they have decided that in view of all the circumstances in the case that they cannot change their earlier decision. As I told you in my letter which was published in the Concordien- sis, the Trustees feel very strong- ly that permanent tenw·e on the Faculty should be regarded as a \'ery highly tr(lasured privilege and not as a right. which is given to faculty members automatica:l· ly. They feel that only by the careful guarding of this privilege by the Board of Tmstees can the total quality of our faculty and educational program be strength- ened for the future. Cordially yours, Carter Davidson. President To the Editor of Concordiensis: Many students, faculty mem- bers. and alumni will feel sad when Washburn Hall is torn down. This building of unUsual form and architecture will leave behind many fond memories. Per- haps interest in its unique archi- tectural features will be stimu- lated by the article, by Paul V. Turner. '62, in the winter 1963 issue of Symposium. . Even though the building will disappear from the campus, its best features may be preserved for future generations by carry- ing· out the following suggestion: When the building is torn down, preserve intact, and number, each stone and brick in the collonnade front and back walls,. also its roof. These parts can then be reassem- bled, precisely as they are now, on a suitable all-weather founda- · tion elsewhere on campus. A perfect site would be in the glade north of the formal gardens and the brook in Jackson's Garden, the place which is sometimes used for picnics and which has a :fire- place in one corner. Placed in a curve at the northeast corner of this glade, the re-erected collon- . nade would fit naturally into the On Sunday, April 28, the Si- · landscape.

Friday, April 26, 1963 Dollar Diplomacy: It's Not What's Mint By J, C. Clemens Each day, all of us have the experience of spending or hand- ling money. The sight of the one- doHar bill is familiar to all of us. lt is so familiar that we never question why a one-dolla·r bill looks the way it does. For the purposes of this column, take out a one-dollar bill and imagi-ne that we are in the executive offices of the Bureau of Printing and En- graving. Two advertising layout men are .discussing plans for the first dollar bill. \ , . , Charlie, I was looking .at the rough layouts on this new bHl and, well, frankly, I was a little bothered by a few things. I'm not going to say too much about the spelling ... I figure that the copy boys can probably rough that out pretty well . , . No, Charlie, Washington has a 't-o-n,' not a 't-i-n' Yeah, well that's a minor point; we won't sweat that too much, but as far as the rest of the copy is ·concerned, I think, well, I feel that you've overworked the bas:c message. I noticed that you've got the word 'one' or the figure mentioned twenty-three times. The research boys worked that over and came up with an aver- age of 11.5 times perside or about .8 per square inch. Yeah, I know that this prevents people from making mistakes, but then again, you've got that big one written out on the back and that sort of hammers it home. I liked the way you worked those little ones into ·the webbing on the front ... that was clever . _ .• really sub- liminal. Well, we'll let that drop for now Oh yes, I meant to dis- cuss the copy on the front side. That 'Silver Certificate' at the top is catchy, but we gotta be careful here. They might get it mixed up with the Betty Crocker promotion for Rogers Silverplate in the \Heirloom\ pattern. Yeah, well they run the same kind of copy and they've got some boys over there that can beat us all hollow on filigrees and fine work . . . They used to make out the Life Magazine subscription pieces. Well, OK, if you want to try to beat them at their game, l·m wit)1 you. · ··Hey, listen, I really liked the portrart.

Mr. Carmen pointed out that the Public Relations department l works with a .limited amount of funds, and thus must use them in selective areas. It is the task of the administration to decide oo the magnitude of the publicity effort. Once this has been de- cided, the effort has to be con- centrated in those areas that will afford the best returns. 'iJ • Carmen feels that to blame his office for the lack o:f any \na- tional image\ is foolhardy and unjustified. He pointed out that '' . college public relations depart- ments have only been in existence for twenty or thirty years. Many colleges had national reputations .,. befm•e that-and Union has been in existence for a long, long:time. With the type of public rela- tions department set up h_er~, one c has to go on the assumptwnithat the cumulative effect of publicity steps aimed at selected tagets will contribute to building a. fa..v- orable image.

The simple fact is, however, that there is no 'dy- namite to be found on the Union campus.

The Concordlensis is dissatisfied with the faculty's lack of response to the questionnaires concerning Union's admission program and proposed Faculty Fellow . plan. In both cases less than thirty percent of those quened both- ered to reply. Although we realize that the faculty is over- burdened with work, the time required for a response would not have been too imposing. As part of the college community, a teacher has a responsibility to himself as well as to other faculty mem- bers to take an active interest in shaping the college's future. A considerable number have done so in the past, but a far larger percentage have decided all is lost and have given up. Perhaps the reasons for an acquiescence to the powerful tide of trustee rule are partially valid. No one can be expected to work for an unattainable goal. However, all goals are not automatically out of reach. !he first step toward progress· is always a statement of aims. Surely a clear expression of faculty opinion would have clarified its nebulous position and given guidance to the Admissions Office and Interfraternity Council. The conclusion to be drawn from our teachers' silence is that Mr. Pearson is not deaf as one faculty member claimed. On the contrary, we believe that there were only whimpers to be heard. It is time for those faculty mem- bers who are 'justifiably' inactive to reexamine their com- plaints that they are powerless and to contribute their needed voices for a better college. The Path Not Taken Tonight the Inter-Fraternity Council meets to elect officers for the coming year and to decide on next year's rushing rules. The IFC ·is under a tremendous obligation to insure continued intelligent leadership for the fraterni- ties and to draw up a list of sensible rushing rules accept- able to the majority of students, faculty, and administra- tion. If they fail in their tasks, the fraternities on the Union College campus will have taken one more step to- ward extinction. During the past year, President Payment and the lead- ership of the IFC have taken steps to try to improve the image of fraternities at Union. The weakening of Hell Week and the attempts toward better communication with the faculty have been two areas in which the IFC has acted. However, much remains to be done. The fraternities could and should attempt to improve the lot of the non- fraternity man, thus silencing those critics who state that fraernities are discriminatory in nature and have the en- viable position of existing without competition. A viable independent group would force fraternities to compete on their merits, would soften the blow of an individual being rejected from a house, and would allow the strongest ad- vocates of fraternalism to prove their claims of the joys of brotherhood by giving them a smaller but more select group of dedicated fraternity men to work with. The IFC may choose tonight to ignore its proper task. If it elects officers who feel no need to solve the many problems associated with the fraternity system, if it passes a set of rushing rules unpopular with the majority of stu- dents and in danger of veing vetoed by the faculty and administration, it may as well disband. Otherwise, it will become a body unrespected by the college community, a body whose attempts to legislate its own rules will be over- ruled by other cam pus powers. Art Review: The Student Salon By \Asher Sheppard\ The annual showing of the wo1'k done by Uni<m's art stud- ents has begun in the Old Chapel Gallery. The \Student Salon,\ showing the work of some seven- teen students using diverse styles and media, pro\·ides the best ~ho\' to be seen in Old Chapel this year. \David and Lisa'' Union's most striking talent, as seen from the show, is senior pre-medical student Robert Sher- win. Sherwin's large oil \Dav-id and Lisa\ effectively establishes the warmth and tenderness which characterized the love of David and Lisa as shown in the recent movie of that name. Sher- win's forms are suffused by- wa1•m yellows and oranges that express the budding loveliness of an adol- escent love that means still mo1·e because it is also the first bud- ding of David and Lisa as per- sona!ities. Their childishly en- twined forms are hardly more than ovaloid abstractions yet Sherwin has made them express the pride that comes from their love. Sherwin's brushwork gives to \David and Lisa\ the feeling of an awakening to the excite- ment of living in the world of sunlight and not the schizophren- ic's nightmare of shadow. Sher- win does this without the use of any obvious \rays of sunlight\ or the like. His ability to express himself without the easy symbols of inferior work makes his work stand out. He is also represented by a smaller oil which shows two ::;tanding figures in a geometrical abstraction. Again, Sherwin's use of color is natural. Strange Girl Alan Ros11er is exhi1biting a striking statuette in stained wood which he calls \Black Sensuality.\ He is effective in using the grain of the wood to help mold the shape of a nude female torso. I, for one, would find it instructive to see Rosner's model, strangely proportioned girl! Harold Nilsson is represented by two stark painti.ngs which re- semble the works of the Magical' Realists in their clarity. . Solid hands of colored skies lend sur- realistic elements. Nilsson's weird world is lonely, with only <;>ne object in the center of atten- tion and the suggestion that ev- erything else is off in the dist- ance. Tim Freeman affixed the hack- neyed title \In the Beginning\ to his large painting of, we are to presume, the Beginning. It is all very primordial, very red, and very dominated by a very symbol, a swirling crescent. Non-Swinging Mobiles The school of \Let's See What :Happens If I Do This\ is repre- sented by Richard Judelsehn's two mobiles. Mr. Judelsohn uses a number of shapes that I have never seen before.

It wrecked the sas~afm:- industry-Spain's principal source of I'evenue-n.nd reduced the nation to a second-class power. As a result, Spaniards were all forced to turn to bull fighting in ordE>r to keep body and soul together. Today, wherever you p,u in Spain-in 1\Iadrid, in Barcelona, in Toledo, in Cleveland -you will see bulls being fought. For many years the bulls have sought to arbitrate this long-standing dispute, but the ~paniards, a proud people who use nothing but Castile soap, have rejected all overtures. It is therefore nt>cessa1y for me to explain bull fighting to anyone who i,: going to Spain. It is also n,ecessary for me to say a few words about Marlboro Cigarettes because they pay me for writing this column, and they are inclined to pout if I ip;nore their product. In truth, it is no chore for me to sing the prnises of l\Iarlboro Cigarettes, for I am one who fairly swoons with delight when I come upon a cigarette which gives you the full, rich taste of good tobaccos plus the pme white Selectrate fil.ter, and Marlboro is the only smoke I have found that fulfilLs both requirements. Oh, what a piece of work is Marlboro! The flavor reaches you without stint or diminution. You, even as I, will find these statements to be happily true when once you light a l\Iarlhoro. l\Iarlboros come to you in soft pack or Flip- Top box, and are made only by the makers of Marlboro. But I digress. Let us return to bull fighting. Bulls are by natme bellicose creatureR who will keep fighting till the cows come home. Then they like to put on pipe and slippers and listen to the \Farm and Home Hour.\ However, the Spaniards will not nllow the bulls any surcease. They keep attacking the bull and making veronictLs-a corn meal pancake filled with ground meat. Bulls, being vegetarians, reject the veronicas and then, believe you me, the fur stn.r.ts to fly! To be perfectly honest, many Spaniards have grown weary of this incessant struggle n.nd have left their homeland. Co- lumlms, for example, took off in three little ships-the Patti, the l\laxene, and the Lnverric-and discovered Ohio. Magellan later discovered Columbw:;, Balboa also sailed to the New World, but he was silent on a peak in Darien, so it is difficult to krtow what he discovemd.
