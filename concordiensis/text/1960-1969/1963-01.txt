I j ' YOUR EYES CAN BE ON THE STARS BUT YOUR FEET MUST ·B·E ,gN THE GROUND The glamour and excitement of space a~e programs often obscure a fundamental fact. It is simp!) that farsightedness must be coupled with sound, practical, down-to-earth engineering if goals an: to be attained. This is the philosophy upon which Pratt & Whitney Aircraft's position as a \vorld leader in flight propulsion sytitems has been built. Almost four decades of solid engineering achievement at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft can be credited to management's conviction that basic and applied research is essential to healthy progress. In addition to concentrated research and developm~nt efforts on advanced gas turbine and rocket engines, new and exciting effects are being explored in every field of aerospace, madne and industrial power application. The challenge of the future is indicated by current programs. Presently Pratt & Whit·ney Aircraft is exploring th~ areas of technical knowledge in magnetohydrodynamics ... thermionic and thermo- electric conversions ... hypersonic fJropulsion ... fuel cells and nuclear power. If you have interests in common with us, if you look to the future but desire to take a down-to~earth approach to get there, investigate career opportunities at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft. ' . To help move tomorrow closer to today, we continually seek ambitious young engineers and scientists. Your de· gree? It can be a B.S., M.S. pr Ph.D. in: MECHANICAL o AERONAUTICAL • ELECTRICAL • CHEMICAL and NUCLEAR ENGINEERING • PHYSICS • CHI;:MISTRY o METALLURGY • CERAMICS • MATHEMATICS • ENGI· NEERING SCIENCE or APPLIED MECHANICS. The field still broadens. The challenge grows greater.

This corner was prepared early Wednesday evening to run nine inches of copy extolling the ~reat effort J?Ut forth by the Garnet basketball forces in their startmg upset v1ctory over the University of Vermont Tuesday evening. Then news c~me in to ~he effect that the Dutchmen had JUSt blown one to a medwcre Norwich i quintet that took a horrendous beating at the hands of the afore- mentioned Vermont five earlier in the year. Far from being out of character in relation to Minerva's athletic achievements for at least . the four years this repol'ter has been around, and no doubt many seasons prior, the loss came as no surprise to many of the jaded suppo~te~s round the q_aad. . . . . . A1mmg at no reprtsals of the basketball team,. we JUst use this example to display some of the wacky .goings on that never make varsity sporting events at Union dull'. Where else could you find a football team that was touted as the best in years drop seven of eight ball games of varying routs? Where else cou:ld you find a fight at a basketball game, and a relatively unspectacular one at that (unless you count the Patterson-Liston swoon), prompt a local sportswriter to mourn the utter lack of sportsmanship in this great and glorious land of ours, decrying that men like this represent our chances for \survival?\ Where else could you find a coach of a particular athletic team manage his charges with a psychology text book in one hand and a depth chart in the other? What other campus :boasts of such a large number Of potential athletes wa;tching from the sidelines, and doing the most griping about the teams they should be playing for? What other school can boast of possessing a costumed clov.'U of unknown species puffing leisurely ·on a ridiculous pipe at every home football game- What other athletic team in the country can equal the spectacle of a team member falling asleep on the bench and then toppling out of his seat, evoking the biggest cheer of the game'! What other college baseball team truthfully say it ;has had a player spiked - while coaching third base? Lack of space prohibits us from l·isting further embarrassments conjured up by the most imaginative, if not the most talented par- ticipants in intercollegiate athletics. Union may never rank number one in any national athletic polls, but remember this, for our size, we have to compare favorably in any all-star poll of any happen- ings.
