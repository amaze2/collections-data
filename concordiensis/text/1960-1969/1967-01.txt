Alsore] ected was a proposal callmg on the All College Council to publish the results of its votes. Under the n£'w election procedui'e, the editor-in-chief will be elected at a meeting of the entire staff .of Concordiensis. The Student Publication Selection Committee will no longer be invol'ved in the selection of the Concordiensis Editodn-Ohief. . In ot~er action, the Student Council defeated by a vote of i1 to 10, a reso- lutiOn which would have requested that the All-CoHege Council make public through a roll call vote all voting in that body and that the All-College Council reque~t that the trus~ees review their ,Present policy regarding disclosure of all financ1~] .figures pertment to student !Jfe.

Among these opponents was \Doc\ Benjamin, who capped his arguments. by saying that he really favored the propos~l but wanted a \good argument.\ A not£' of iron:~; was sounded when the Council refused to take a roll-eall vote on the resolutiOn calling for roll- call vote at All-College Council meetings. .

Mr. Srhelsinger is the author of the best·selling cloculnentary of the Kenned;y era, \A Thousand Days: John F.

Asia, Africa, Cuba, Moscow and Peking. Schelsinger recalls how Kennedy faced the domestic challenges of Civil Rights, the economy,. and the steel industry. From his position as special assistant to Pres. Kennedy Schlesinger observed and later recon- structed in his book the ldnd of man and politician, statesman and leader that Kennedy was. Professor's Soil Schlesinger was born in Columbus, Ohio i11 1917, the son of Arthur Schlesinger, noted historian. Young Schlesinger graduated summa cum laude from Harvard in 1938. He mar- ried in 1940, and now makes his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He and his wife have four children. He began his government career with the Office of War Industries in 1942.

He served on Adlai Stevenson's staff in the 1952 presidential cam- (. paign. Later he joined the Americans for Dem()cratic Action. A prize-winning author, some of his more famous books include: \The Age Of Jackson\ (Pulitzer Prize, 1945), \'The Gen.eral And The Presi- dent\ (1951), \The Crisis Of The Old Order\ (1951), \The Coming Of The New Deal\ (1958), and \A Thousand Days: Jolm F. Kennedy In The White House\· (.1965). ARTHUR SCHLESINGER Committee To By NEIL S. KRAMER An ad hoc committee on the future role and character of the college has been established to study the \lines of development that seem most prom- ising in light. of educational and so- cial developments throughout the country and the immediate area,\ ac- cording to Prof. Joseph B. Board, Jr., committeP chairman. Boal'd discussed an objective, schol- arly study that is to be made of Union to determine its present educational posture. All faculty members and a random sample of the student body will receive questionnaires from the ad hoc cqmmittee. Interested parties are heard in hearings, as yet unsched- u:ed. Report Due This Spring The committee's report, to be com- pleted this spring, will involve con- siderations of the size of the college, the extent to which a graduate pro- gram will be .pursued, and what areas will receive emphasis in the under- graduate program. In addition to Board, the committee consists of Profs. Niemeyer, Goble, and Hoffman; Associate Profs. Brun- graber, Jonas, Bick, Mercer, Lambert;. Housing Controversy Settled; Views On Dorm D:ecor Mixed Union Students relaxing in Nc.rth Wing of Davidson Hall. Inconveniences Are Cited By Dot~m ,Residents By JOHN C. ANES David Laird, Dii'ector of the Resi- dence Program, revealed importa11t policies on the new dormitories and noted a very bright future for the independent student as contrasted with several complaints launched b:y residents of the new structures. \Squatter's rights\ will prevail in Fox and Davidson Halls. Residents o:f a suite will have the prerogative o:f retaining it for ensuing years. Laird next commented on facilities for the independent student, There will be fairly large central lounges in each hall which when compliment- ed by access .to the inner court (ideally suited f(H spring and fall functions) should provide more than adequate room for the independen~ to carry out social activities. Each hall will also contain smali television and recreation rooms. No Moving Dates Yef It is felt that practically all of North College, Kappa Alpha, and Beta Theta Pi can be accommodated in Davidson Hall. Bronner House and the Nott Street residences will be moved into Fox Hall when completed. No rr.oving dates are available. When told that several students were critical of the furniture and the limited closet space, Laird invited student$ to compare Fox and Davicl- son with other iltstitutions' new fa- cilities and felt confident that they would be superior in some points and inferior in others. He contended the eomparison would be quite favorable. He pointed out that an active stu- dent committee was instrumental in the selection of fixtures and design. David Wieland, the head resident advisor of· Fox Hall commented that \the buildings were not completed when we moved in. Consequently many minor inconveniences existed 1vhich have now been rectified except for the installation of phones, which, due to a union dispute, has been de- 1ayed.\ ' \Technical Detoy\ According to Theodore 1\olcllwaine, Business Manager of the college, a \technical delay\ was the cause of the postponement and that barring \unforseen\ pro\blems the installation of a new phone cable will take place on February 18th, and -all pay phones and private phones where orders are pending will be in operation soon aft.· erward .. Any orders now received for private phones wiU. probably not be fi l:ed until after February 20th Weiland went on to comment that Davidso11 was \~! .re.sidence hall, not just an ordinary · dormitory;\ The sound-proofing has proved to be an aid to study. \No one can complain about the . desks, lighting and shelf space for hooks,\ he stated. At a random sampling of the new residents in Davidson, the following quotations ;were obtained: Continued on Page 2 Examine College Role and Mr. Ross. _ . \Any institution worth its salt i::; making a similar stlldy,\ said Board~ He cited Swarthmore and Haverford Colleges in Pennsylvania as examples. Character Research Beyond the students and faculty~ the library admi11istration and the four deans of the colle.e;e, a similar committee of trustees, the Industrial Administration De:Partment, the Ad- missions Office and the Character Research Project will be consulted. Board said that educational insti- tutions must keep in step with the social and technol<>gical changes oc- curring within our age, looking for- ward to the role of the college in the next two decades.

It tirst denied, then admitted financial motives for the policy.\ On Tuesday November 22, the· AU College Council met to consider a Stuclent Council Reso!ution recom- mending that the ACG revise the housing policy to permit juniors and seniors to live off campus if <they wished. The ACC noted that it could not change general college policies made by the Board of Trustees, but the ACC agreed to study the students' views and make a recommendation to the Board. Hardship Cases The ACC agreed that the m()ve on campus might cause a personal finan- cial hardship, and recommended that the administration assume an obliga- tion to alleviate these hardships. It became clear on December 1, however, that students living off campus would be allowed to remain there for the remainder of the aca- demic year. In a letter to the student body, Benjamin Volinski, Student Council President, said that due to unforseen construction delays, the new dormitories would not be com- pleted on schedule and thus the col- lege would not be able to ask stu- dents to move on campus in January. Due to the delays, only one wing of Davidson Hall would be ready, the letter said. Students living off campus could choose to remain off campus but would have first priority in mov- ing into the one wing ·Of Davidson Hall to. be completed. Regretted Decision In his letter, Volinski stated that this decision was \a matter of ex- treme regret to the coliege. The de- cision will mean not only a con- siderable financial loss to the college, but it may cause inconvenience to the students.\ Earlier in November, Dale F. Timberlake, Comptroller, statd that \to the best of my knowl- .~ edge, the order in which students are to be moved into the new dormitories is not based on financial consid- erations.\ \Professors At Large,\ a half-hour academic panel dis- cussion program with Prof. Patrick E. Kilburn as moder· ator, appears on WMHT, Chanel 17, each Friday night at 9:30 and each Sunday afterno<Jn .at 2:30. Prof, Kilburn describes the program as \a showcase for Capital Area faculty.\ He has had on • th.e. program members of the faculties of Union, RPI, Skidmore, Saint Rose, Siena, SUNY at Albany, and the Albany Law School. Timely Question Most recently, students received a m~tnorandum from Davjd B. Laird, Diredor of Residence Programs, in- brming them that the dates for the c~mpletion of Davidson Hall and Fox House were indefinite but that stu- 6'ents in North ·College could begin sig)ling for rooms in Davidson Hall on Monday, J2nuary 16. Residents of Bronner Hous<> a!ld 636-638 Nott St. will move into Fox House upon its completion. Eitch week one of the two faculty members discuss a topic with Prof. Kilburn w)li<!h he and WMHT producers feel has a wide and timely -interest. Since the program debuted on November 25, the topics have inCluded the Hungarian Revolution, pornography, literature and the movies, and the Catholic church. and birth coritrcl.

It first denied, then admitted financial motives for the policy.\ On Tuesday November 22, the All College Col:lncil met to consider a Student Cm:mcil Reso~ution recom- mending that the ACC revise the h('ntsing policy to permit juniors and is not based on fina:trcia'l consid· erations.\ 3 Kilburn Moderates ETV Show By ALAN KLEIN \Professors At Large,\ a half·hour academic panel dis- cttssion program with Prof. Patrick E. Kilburn as moder· a:tor, appears on WMHT, Chanel 17, each Friday night at 9:30 and e~ch Sunday afternoon at 2:30. Prof. Kilburn describes the program as \a showcase for Capital Area faculty.\ He has had on the program members of the faculties of Union, RPI, Skidmore, Saint Rose, Siena, SUNY at Albany, and the Albany Law School Timely Question A. Niemeyer and Granville Hicks, contributing Editor to the Saturday Review, wiU discuss the topic, \Who Are the Giants in American Literature?\ On Friday, January 20, the fotlowing Sunday, Union economics instructor Martin C. Gideonse will discuss \De Gaulle and the Gold Standard.\ Not Complacent 'Discussing the the advantages of tile program, Prof. Kilburn stated that \it encourage~ wider acquainta!).ce among faculty of V!lrious capital area colleges,\ and that this acquaintance \opens the way to more cooperation.\ Kilburn also enumerated several benefits which he personaHy derives fr()llJ his participation in the program: Wed· re matched seniors to live off campus id' they wished. The ACC noted that it could not change genera-l college policies t made by the Board .of Trustees, but the ACC agreed to study the students' views and make a recommendation to the Board. Most recently, students received a PJ,emorandum from David B. Laird, Director of Residence Programs, in- forming them that the dates for the completion of Davidson Hall and Fox House were indefinite but that stu- dents in North C()Hege could begin signing f0r rooms in Davidson HaH on Monday, January 16. Residents of Bronner HousE' and 636-638 Nott St. will move into Fox H0use upon its completion. Each week one of the two faculty members discuss a topic with Prof. Kilburn which he and WMHT producers feel has a wide and timely interest. Since the program debuted on November 25, the topics have included the Hungarian Revolution, pornography, literature and the movies, and the Catholic church and birth control. This Friday and Sunday, Union English Professor Carl \I've ex;panded my acquaintances,\ nnd \It's kept me from getting complacent.\ He said that his greatest diffificulty is \thinking of questions of general interest.\ first round first 366 matched matched on on Fri- 9:00p.m. d freshmen ' lists, and the match- on January 'I ' ( Hardship Cases The ACC agreed that the move o:n campus nl'ight cause a personal finan- cial hardship, and rec0mmended that the administration assume an obliga- tion to alleviate these hardships. It became clear on December 1, however, that stl:ldents living off campus would be allowed t0 remain there for the remainder 0f the aca- demic year. In a letter to the stu.dent body, Benjamin Volinski, Student Council President, said that due to unf@rseen construction delays, the new dormitories would n0t be com- pleted on schedule and thus the col- lege would UGt be able to ask stu- dents to move on campus in .January. Due to the delays, only one wing of Davidson Hall would be ready, the letter said. Students living off cam.pus c0uld choose to remain off campus but would have first priority in mov- ing into the one wing of Davidson Hall to be completed. Regretted Decision In his letter, Volinski stated that this decision was \a matter of ex- treme regret to the college. The de- cisian will mean not only a con- siderable financial loss t0 the college, but it may cause inconvenience tu the students.\ Earlier in November, Concordy Freed; Will Elect Editor Th• following is the text of the Studant Council bifl. reforming the pro- cedure for selecting the editor of Concordiensis. 1.

He remi- nisces over Pearl Harbor, the Lusitania, Franklin Roosevelt, John.Kennedy, and Magna Charta. His most valuable contribution to historical scholar- ship is tl;le observatiq_n that the American Revolu- tion \Was a turning point in our history.\ President Johnson evidently believes in the ideology ;·tl}at he and his colleagues have con- structed pas a guide for their policy-making.

We can meet the challenge, or we can turn away from it.\ Worthy of Soc- rates! His facility with mathematics is demon- strated as well. \At least two of every four vol- unteers in the war on poverty should be women.\ I , , ' '-- , .. ' '..., •,. , I Block Hat and Mustache In a voluminous six-page chapter modestly entitled \The Nature of the Communist 'Threat,\ President Johnson virtually ascribes to the Com- munist bloc a black hat and mustache. On The Gulf of Tonkin incident he writes \The world re- members-the world must never forget-that aggression unchallenged is aggression unleashed,\ whatever that means. Well, never fear for the United States \answered this aggression with ac- tion. America's C()Urse was not precipitate. Amer- ica's response was not without long provocation.\ The Cold War is· a conflict of good and evil in the eyes of our President. The United States is mere- ly concerned with the protection of freedom and good people: \ou.r aim in Vietnam, as in the rest of the world, is to help restore the peace and to re-establish a decent order.\ President Johnson's \book\ may not have got- ten rave reviews; but he was elected in 1964, And the illiterates may have played a large role in the election, though I doubt it. Mindful of his constituents, President Johnson has published an- other sugar-coated volume called \This America.\ This time he adds illustrations! The book is bas- ically a collection e£ fine photographs by Ken Heyman, but the ,text is drawn from the Presi- dent's naivete. \Our fate as a nation and our future as a people rest not upon one citizen but upon all our citizens\ proclaims the subheading to a picture of the most disgusting and disrepu- hble-looking people you've ever seen. ~ J-l7-6f> Jhft ._.xtw J:vJJ JJ(I/9F ''32 AMf BpV(~~!N~(};~A'~~~~g 11 •·• ~ /~-\;·.·./.

'Grotesqueries' of Lon Chaney ~ MakeFine·Filwt The Phantom of the Opera serves as the most ~.ll.,sttccess:ful vehicle for the multiform Lon Chaney's grotesqueries. However, after forty years, some viewers attending tne Memorial Chapel showing .at 7 and 9 p.m. tonight, may find it to be one of the funniest .films th.at Hollywood has turned out. t Many of tile scenes in the grim caverns un- der the Paris Opera have very real beauty and dramatic power in their composition, evoking genuine images o'f terror. Bizzarre little vig- •• nettes. such as the phantom's hand emerging from the waters to drag a victim to his doom, produce moments so delicious that one wishes for the good-old days when viUains· called a spade. a. spade. It may seem a hit too melodramatic for t' ttoday's ronn()isseur of the subtly-contrived mys- tery. It's a real treat, however,. for those who appreciate sundry torture chambers and the like. The story centers around ·Christine Dubois, ., ,an operatic understudy, who seems fated to go on understudying forever until befriended by Enrique Claudin. Passion t The plot sickens (sic) as we learn that Claudin has a vast but secret passion for Chris- tine. Claudin is fiFed from the orchestra and a pan of acid is thrown at him, starting him on his career ;as Phantom. Intent on furthering Christine's career, he puts his natural managerial talent to work to use his influence in getting her on the starting ·~ ,.team. He steals the master key to the opera ' house, slips a Mickey into Christine's rival's drink, sends poison .pen letters, strangles a so- prano and hel.' main, and then, in a show of sheer press agentry genius he decides to \pull strings,\ and saws .off a huge chandalier from its chain during the performance of an opera in which Christine's rival is singing. Although Ayn Rand would have been proud of this rugged fourth level thinking, the Surete (French FBI) felt that it was carrying civil disobedience a bit too far. Finally Composer Franz Liszt is called on to aid in bagging the cagey phantom. Needless to ,., ' sav, the Phantom's activities did not help to win · back his job. Vacation: s Th.

There is q. very 7librant~ creative segment of our society which is ignored previously stultifying limits and traditions in their fields to create new forms of art a!ld thinking. in mwic we have seen traditional cate- gories no longer applicable as various c(:)m- !Jinations lwtJe resulted in new intriguing forms. In art, we have the pop and op trends. Politics has seen the introd~ction of the New Left, a conrerned invol'oed movement that has ,~pread through college campuses. Social think· zng has been revamped by the use of LSD, marijuana, and other conscious expanding drugs. Mod olothing has become the rage. Andy Warhol's \underground\ films have received critical praise. Manifestations of the psycha- delic move.ment can be seen in the other forms mentioned. The Teeny Bopper, a new ad- dition to the evolutionary scale~ has been found. Greenwich Village outgrew itself and has spn:ad ,to the East Village. Student move- ments have become influential on the civil rights and anti-war issues. in short, something very definitely \is happening,\ and Concordiensis will present an in depth iuquiry into these and any re- lated fields. Articles will appear under the nebulou.s, if not dubious, title of \The New Scene.,, ·writers are needed to write on all phases of \The New Scene.\ No previous or future connection with the Concordiensis is required and it is hoped that pages of Con- cordy 11•ill be used for serious critical expres- sion by both students and faculty.

As the machinery of learning shrugged off a temporary hibernation and creaked and shivered 'J 1:.. into the second term last week, there · could be little doubt that a mind left out in the cold for twenty-one days will encounter ignition problems. For the student, and no one can lay claim to that status without yearn- ing perpetually for an end to school, the prospect_;pf three weeks off can easily blossomr-tnto a mirage of sum- mer. From;::lii'S' vantage point beneath two thouij'Ud unread pages, the va- cation ii:;a· vast oasis just beyond the torturing'· desert of two hour tests. Three · week:s is percisley long enough to be endless. Debriefing Whenever final exams close and vacation begins a distinct pattern of student behavior appears to be drawn. A three week: \debriefing\ proced1tre is followed in which the indivilual 1 ; .· student is reprogrammed for w6rth- less loafing. Tile process begins each time a free day is encountered, and can only be halteq ,with an inj~ctioiJt, to the sweet life, and overtures to his mordant intelligence can be as fruit- less for the Union faculty member as is the professorial coaxing of a treasured but frozen 1949 Pontiac. The stupified young man invariably arises from the table at the end of his last exam with a vague feeling of emptiness. His exams are over but momentum carries him back to the grind.

Len Simon, Secrecy The decision of the All College Council, supported by the Student Council, to maintain a general policy of secrecy bodes ill for the future of this college community. ·when this paper endorsed the concept of an All Col- lege Council, we envisaged a body which would lead, open- ly and courageously, public opinion. Now we are told that secrecy is the order of the day. This is, unfortunately, a common occurrence on this campus. Faculty meetings, which certainly bear vitally on student affairs, are not open to reporters or the public. The same is true of trustee meetings. And administrative decisions, such as in the McLister case last spring, are covered by a V€il of rumor and half-truth because no one will officially discuss them. We wonder what the purpose of all this secrecy is. Certainly, there will be times when secrecy is the order of the day. But this should be the exception and not the rule. What facts, what truths about Union are so damaging that they must be so strictly protected. We feel, and hope, that there are none. Rather, it seems that there is an unwilling- ness for all too many of the so-called leaders to stand on their record. Perhaps the most glaring example of this was the action of the ACC supporting administration's dormitory policy. The final statement did not, in any :manner, add any- thing new to the information earlier published in this news- paper. In particular, it ignored, with no explanation, the wishes of the student body as expressed in a petition call- ing for continued off-campus housing permission. It also failed to give any Indication of the individual positions taken by the members of the body. This is not beneficial to any segment of the college. To the students, purposely kept in the dark, it looks like a sell-out. For the All College Council, it is a blow to the confidence and respect of the general campus which is so necessary for its survival. And for the administration, it is the loss of what could be a meaningful mode of communi- cation from the students. In general, we feel that all meetings of the V'.l.rious groups on campus should be open to the press and the general public. Under special conditions, this might be re- versed, but it should be understood that this is the excep- tion. A certain amount of trust is, after all, the prime prerequisite for any community. Community The administration has called for the students to de- velop a sense of community. And the proposed method is to force all students not living at home or working for their room to live in college owned and operated dormi- tories. This is attacking the problem from the wrong end. No one, or at least few, would deny that this sense is de- sirable for a college such as Union. But~to associate phy- sical proximity with this sense of community is at best a tenuous proposition. The probable effect, in fact, of forcing students to live on campus will be to enbitter them. Certainly, state- ments such as that of Dean Pollock, which was re-iterated by others higher in the administration, that anyone who does not like the policy can leave, do not seem calculated to produce any great love for Union.'~ What is there for Union to gain by this.,pmicy? In the immediate future, finances will proba.}?ly predominate: with those huge and expensive dormitories sitting in Achilles Field, it is unlikely that the college will allow students· to live off-campus, no matter What the gains to the student. But with the steadily increasing size of the student body, the time will come when the choice must be faced whether to scrap the present residential ''policy or,to build new dormitories. Concordiensis strongly endorses the former alterna- Thursday, January 12, tive. I~ f~her urges publi~ re-iteration of the philosophic under~mn~gs of the of;fimal college policy and full and · open d!scusison of the factors involved ... Only in this· man- ner can the hectic and bitter rush of acrimonious argument of the last few months be avoided. And in this manner a· more PE!:rfect Union can be established. ·:Letters to the Editor For More ·spending Dan Button • To the Editor, i ,Please accept my sincerest . appreciation for the editorial 1 • Sllpport given me by the Con- !, cordiensis before my election as Congressman for the 29th President Johnson's State of the Union address Tues- . m4~~ctitind of involvement in day nig~t .~ttempt~d, among other things, ~o use the \new the ongoing political and civic eco~o1n1cs . to. contml}e the present econom~c boom.

This can not ;be done if we don't know who's voting for what. .~ Tuesday night at the StU!lent ' Council meeting, a resolution was defeated by a vote of n to 10 that would've requested the All College Council to re- ~ lease their votes. Particu~arly shocking was the fact that a majority would .not even allow this vote to be taken by a roll'' call. I wonder what this seg- ment of the Council was afraid of by not aHowing their vote to be publicised. · ·J By this action, the Student · Council has joined the All Col- lege Council in rebuking a pro- cedure that is considered basic to most democratic org11-lilia- \J tions. 1 hope that concerned stu- dents wi'll attempt to influence the All College Council to re- vise their practice.

GRAB BAG OF PIETY Page4 S-vvitnlllers Bovv To Ephtnen; Shields Stars For Dutchtnen By il:IIKE KLAYMAN For the thirtieth time in as many meets, Union was unable to .defeat Williams College in the first swimming contest of the seasen, The Garnet held the lead throughout most of the meet, at times by as much as nine ,points, but it was the final event, the 400 yard free-style which ,proved to be the nemesis, as the Dutchmen finally bowed, 50-45. Williams took the opening event of the 400 the meet which received a rating of 6 from both yard medley relay, but Union came back in the officials. Flynn Takes First 200 yard freestyle with Dick Amesbury taking first with a time .of 2:02.8, and second place .go- ing to sophomore Tom Flynn. Paul Shields came within two-tenths of a second of tieing his own record for the 50 yard freestyle with the winning time of 0:23.2. The Ephmen's co-captain, Wil- liams took tirst in the 200 yard individual hedley, while senior Dick Corrigan and Norman Dove- berg .placed second and third for the Garnet, and the Dutchmen went into the diving competition with a two point lead. Cassels Receives Highest Rating Williams leadoff diver Gardner proved to be too much for Union's Chris Cassels and Harvey Richmond who had to settle for second and third. Cassels, however, made the high-scoring dive of After losing the 200 yard butterfly in a close contest between William's other co-captaill Con- way and Union sophomore Steve Werlin, the Garnet went on to take the 100 yard freestyle with Shields time of 0:51.3. The Ephmen cap- tured first in the 200 yard backstroke with Corri- gan and Hoben placing second and third. Union then attained its greatest lead of the competition (9 points) by sweeping the 500 yard freestyle with Flynn's time of 5:45.5 taking first and Ames- bury placing second. However, the Garnet pro- ceeded to drop both the 200 yard breaststroke and the 400 yard freestyle relay, and the meet ended with a score of 50-45. Packers Out To Can Kansas City; But Green Bay May Be Scalped If you have not heard al- ready, the Super Bowl is here! On Sunday, January 15, the Green Bay Packers of the NFL will meet the Kansas City Chiefs of the AFL in the World\s Championship football game. The Packers, according to your local bookie, are 12y 2 point favorites to beat the AFL champions. But don't be sur- prised if the game is much closer. The Packers have been often called a money team, always ready with the big play when the check book calls for it. This is a lot of rubbish. Green Bay almost blew two of their last three games this season because they could not come up with the big play. In their game with Frosh Hoopsters Show Very Strong Shooting By LEN SIMON \There is no reason why we shouldn't have a winning season.\ This mild optimism was voiced by Coach Chris Schmid whose frosh basketball team opens its season this weekend facing Alfred Friday night and Hobart Saturday night. Startinl{ in the f()recourt will be Bob Wiley, Pete Garrison, and Jim Getman. Barry Katzman will be at one of the guards, while the other position is still up for grabs. Other guards are Ed Buzak, Craig Carlson, Roger Harrison, Jeff Kirkpatrick, and Ken Pearce. Reserves in the forecourt are Bruce Baldwin, Rich Heiden, and Mike Thompson. Another forward, Bill Boehmke, is out for about a month with torn cartilege. Outside shooting is the stron; point of the team. The rebound- ' ing should be adequate, while defense is the question mark that may decide the success or failure of this year's freshman basketball team. We at PP&l like one thing ... Success!

PENNSYLVANIA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY An equal opportunity employer I I the Baltimore Colts on Decem- • ber 10, the Packers were lead- · ing 14-10 with only 1:48 left on · the scoreboard clock. The Colts, with .John Unitas at the helm, marched from their own 27 yard line to the Packer's 8. There an unfortunate Unitas fumbl~ cost the Colts the game. It was not the great Packer defense that caused this fumble, only an unfortunate piece of wet turf on which Johnny U. slipped. In the NFL championship game with the Dallas Cowboys on New Year's Day, the Packers again almost lost all their mar- · bles with one minute left on the clock The Cowboys marched to the Green Bay one yard line only to have an off- sides penalty cost them a 'sud- den death' playoff and possibly the game. If the Kansas City Chiefs can keep from making key mistakes in key situations, the game may be turned into an upset. How- ever, the Packers, with all things considered, still are the favorite of this writer who calls the game: Packers 24, Chiefs 20.

In the second half Drew got hot · from the outside scoring 51 points while the Garnet again couldn't hit from the floor, and lost, 85-80. Th,e game was close to the end, but the Garnet made four turnovers in the last two minutes which resulted in four Drew baskets Once again the difference was at the foul line where Drew made 29 .of 40 against 10 of 18 for the Garnet to offset a Union advantage of seven , \· .field goals, 35-28. \ Following the three road defeats, the Garnet retJ!.rned to the Fie_ldhouse last Friday and played thetr best game of the year, defeating Amherst 68-59. The Garnet, especially Bill Priscott and Torn Urbelis 1 shot well from the outside for the first time this year and overall hit 40 of 70 for 42.9%. Fitz Turner had 14 rebounds as the Gar- net pulled down 63 against their opponent's 34. The Garnet once again started quickly taking a 10 point lead midway through the first half and 1 carried an 8 point lead to the dressing room. The Lord Jeffs came on strong ill the second half and cut the Garnet lead to one with 91;2 minutes left and stayed within two at 59~57 when Fitz Turner scored three straight hoops to put the game out of reach. The first came on a layup after recovering a loose ball, the second on a pass from Urbel1s and the third on a fast break. By GARY PREVOST With victories over Amherst Friday and Hamilton last night the Garnet cagers have evened their record at 3-3. The Dutchmen staged a strong second half rally to defeat Hamilton, 79-75, at MemJrial Fie~d­ house last night after beating Amherst, 68-59, last Friday. The Garnet win over Hamilton was especially rewarding. The cagers rallied from a twelve point halftime deficit to win by four points in the last four seconds over the previously un- beaten Continentals. The four points, one by Priscott and three by Turner, were the result of technical foul call on Hamilton after Ron Giancola was fouled. Ron missed his free throw, but Priscott made the technical shot to break the 75-75 tie. Fitz Turner added a three point play with two seconds left after taking a fine lead pass from Tom Urbelis. Hamilton had grabbed a 47-35 half-time lead by penetrating the Garnet zone and scoring on fast breaks while the Garnet effort was hampered by poor shooting (14 of 37) and twelve turn- overs. The Evansmen came out in the second half with a man to man press forcing the Continentals into many errors. The Garnet got a big lift when Fine Team Effort The Garnet victory over Amherst repre- sented an extremely fine team effort as Ron ~iancola was sidelined again due to an ach- mg back. Ron was the second leading scorer and rebounder and the team's best percentage shoot- er. The Garnet have lost first line reserves Joe James and Cliff Feldman, who are academi: cally ineligible this term.

Schlesinger Denounces Vietnamese BombingS' Written under auspices of Schenectady Union-Siar , Arthur Schlesinger, special assist- ant to President Kennedy and author of his biography, \A Thousand Days,\ told an overflow crowd in Union Col- lege's Memorial Chapel last night that U.S. bombing of North Vietnam was useless and~in light of its po- litical draw\backs-should be aban- doned. Speaking on \The World We Want -and How to Get It,\ Schlesinger pointed out that bombing had not been able to destroy supply lines in Korea and is not working in Vietnam. He likened those who call for more bombing to a doctor who doubles his patient's prescription because it has not worked. Cannot Win War \The hard fact is,\ he said, \that bombing cannot win a war in an agri- cultural country and against guerriila warfare.\ Similarly, he denied its efficacy in destroying morale. \England and Germany were bombed durmg World War II and it didn't affect their morale. If this country were bombed, would be give up? What makes you think that the Vietnamese are any less courageous than we are?\ Schlesinger pointed to two illusions that have affected American policy. One is that of omnipotence and the other of omniscience. \We feel,\ he said, \that nothing can happen any- where in the world without our ap- proval. And we feel that we know what is right better than anyone else. Isolated From Allies \The administration calls its critics neo-isolationists. But are not the real isolationists those who have isolated us from our allies in fighting this lonely war? \While this feeling is bad enough in the present, it becomes even worse when applied to the future. Who could have foreseen in 1945 the friendship between this country and Japan or Germany by the end of that decade? Or in 1955 foreseen the en- mity between China and the Soviet Union by the end of that decade? Yet there are those who urge a preven- tive war with Peking before it . be- comes a nuclear power. The one thing about the future that is certain is its inscrutability.\ Schlesinger called for a more mod- est approach to international rela- tions. Minority \We must remember that we are only 6 per cent of the world's popu- lation and realize that we cannot con- trol the other 94 per cent. \We can and we should ~elp othe! nations,\ he said, paraphrasmg Presi- dent Kennedy, \but we can:110t supply our own will and purpose 1f they are lacking in the native country.\ Schlesinger proposed four steps ~o bring about a solution to the war m Vietnam. First, the Viet Cong must be forced to realize that they cannot win by military methods. Second, the U.S. must gradually \taper off the bombing.\ Third, the U.S. must \establish a civilian government which can, if it wishes, negotiate with the Viet Cong. And if it releases us from our com- mitments, that would not be a catas- trophe either.\ Imagination Finally, the U.S. must enforce the Geneva accords. \If the government had put one- hundredth the imagination into the pursuit of peace as it has into the pursuit of war,\ be said, \we would be much further along the road to peace.\ Much of the present trouble in American policy stems from the fact that the United States is still acting in accordance with the situation as it was after the close of World War II, when the world was divided into two monolithic camps. \But the postwar period has come to an end.\ Schlesinger said he thought there had been progress at the beginning of the '60s toward the realization of this fact, but that this country has been \backsliding\ recently. Today's world, has many centers of power, he said, Mao Tse-tung and Charles de Gaulle are leaders of this drive. . \Because a state proclaims Itself Communist does not mean any more that it is an agent of Russian na- tionalist interests. In practical terms, tltis means that possibly the best thing we could have done in 195~ would have been to allow Ho Chi Minh to set up a stable national Com- munist government rather than Sl;lP· port a string of right-wing mandarms and Air Force generals. He saw Communism as a failure. Only in three countries have the Com munists won power since 1945. \In two, China and North Vitenam, it was because. they had taken control of the nationalist movements. In Castro's Cuba it was because he decided to take his revolution into the Com- munist camp.\ The United States must attempt to break the deadlock with the Soviet Union. \On some grounds, this has been accomplished,\ Schlesinger said, pointing ·to common action in ~vert­ mg starvation in India and seekmg to prevent the spread of nuclear weap- ons. \But we must realize that th.e Soviet Union can no longer sell o11t Communist revolutions as she was able to during the 1920s and 1930s. Vietnam poses a dilemma for her- and if the United States forces a choice between harmony with us or support of another Communist re- gime, she will probably have to stand by her ally.\ Discusses Program Earlier in the day, Schlesinger <lis- cussed the importance of the New Deal. He claimed it proved that a mixed economy, with _elements • o.f both socialism and capitalism could work. This lesson, he daimed, is .?e- ing learned all over the world . as capitalist nations use more plann1ng and the socialist nations allow more individual initiative.\ \The New Deal failed to end urt- employment because . it la~ke~ the courage of its convict10ns-1t did not spend enough,\ Schlesinger said. \The largest deficit was in 1936, about $4 or $5 billion, and that was not enough.\ . The utility of the deficit WAS proved when the country entered World War II and the large budget G~ntinued on Page 3 Joseph Mann To Serve Concordy As Editor JRC Holds Elections; Robert Giovanneti New President pressed full confidence in his su(!- cessor ·'Mann has shown himself to be an· able and conscientious news- man.

The atmosphere of co!Iege life is far more mnvincing than the wol\ds of an admissions of- ficer. In an attempt to provide such an atmosphtere, the program for the two day conference included visits to classes, tours with the Gatesmen, tea with the students, and student panel discussions.: Sur:cess Apparent Pearson sees success of the confer\· ence rapidly becoming ap)lare.Jlt,: as letters of congratulations ha3Je-· been pouring into the Admission effice.

In spite of these problems, Pearson looks forward to having as home from school for wearing slacks. \We felt that her civil liberties had been violated be-cause she was wear- ing slacks on doctor's order,\ Gide- onse recollected. Her high school principal eventually relented, partly due to ACLU's activities. \We're presently investigating bail practices in this area,\ Gideonse dis- closed. \Such practices vary from judge to judge, and are often used as a punitive measure. We therefore hope to have sQme impact in this area.\ Evening Course ' .

4 Thursday, January 19, 1967 Union Faculty Policy To Emphasize Teacher- Researchers By JOSEPH MANN Most college students would agree that one of the most important -elements comprising their \educational process\ is the quality of teacl:).ing at an institution. At .the primary and secondary levels of education, effoects of poor teaching can be disastrous to the :;tudents; at the college level, dull, uninspiring, and traditionally oriented teaching can certainly do no less damage. Anyone who has attended a college or uni- versity soon comes to know that there are many students wasting their- time· studying under a faculty member who providt;ls little or nothing to them in the classroom; it is just as clear that many faculty members spend a good portion of their teaching years .with students who simply do not want to learn from them. In some cases, professors are teaching subjects in fields where they do not feel competent, or where they sim- ply have no interests_ Reality An unavoidable reality in education is that certain teachers generate more enthusiasm to learn among students than others. These are the types of men that any learning institution should be eager to obtain. But we might well ask ii such teachers are in actuality being sought, espe- cially at Union where a low student-faculty ratio is emphasized. The question is obviously not so simple as Book Review: ''Why don't we have more exciting teachers?\ since the defining qualities of an outstanding educator, the demands of the student body and the college are some of the complex points which must be considered here. This article is an at- tempt to examine the administration's policy to- wards the selection' of new faculty members and to provide some ideas on how this policy might be altered to provide a better situation for stu- dents and faculty alike. Research Activity In the Winter 1966·67 isssue of Symposium, President Martin states that \the College stands to gain . . . \ from \. . . a deliberate policy to re- cruit whenever possible vigorous young scholars who come to Union for their beginning (and oft· en most exhi:lirating) years, then move on to other places where libraries are larger, Iabora. tories more complete, and graduate students abound.\ He feels that \New blood sets the o'd blood running.\ Similarly, Dean 'Fheodore Lock· wood confirmed this trend t' seek younger, teach· er-researches since the education of younger men reflects the latest developments in a fie!d and since a wider distribution of age, rank and sal· aries among facu.Uy members is desirable. Union is not concentrating on researchers alone, but is interested in \promising young scholars\ who wish to teach at the undergraduate level. The College, however, is looking for more re- A tnericanisolationisrnExa~nined By CARL ROSENSTOCK \The threat of a !Ilajor war once more con- fronted ·the world, and vubuc opmion lll the Umted btates responded Wlth near unanlll1Aty.

Intimatwns of a major war came as a result of Germany's actions in the Rhineland, ltaly's in Afnca, and Japan's in Chma. ·rnc re- action ot the l.Jmted Mates was almost unammous. I<'or tne next srx years, this counu:y wou1d pur- sue a policy, rtrst mennoned by President Wash· ington, ana adhered to smce - the Monroe lJoc· trme. This policy, isolatromsm, became the cen- tral idea m all the subsequent tore1gn poucy legi.slatwn. ln a newly published book, Associate Protessor 11-ianired Jonas, of UniOn's H1story De- partlaent, discusses this IsolatiOmsrn, Its reason- mg, its bases, Its 1deas, and its subsequent death. Isolationists There were basically fi.ve types of isolation- ists. These were the tonign-onented, the belllg. erent, the hmrd, the rad1cal and the conserva· tlve Jsolatiomsts. The toreign onented were those Who W!Slled to keep American OUt Of war because they fert an allegiance to a country, wluch they lelt might poss1b!Y be an enemy m a tuture war. Many German-Amencans, who felt an allegiance towards Nazi Germany and most hard-core Communists, wh.o recognized the Mos- cow-Berlin agreement, fit into this category. Bel- ligerent isolationists were those who felt that thls country should continue to pursue a \unilat- eral foreign policy of the nineteenth century.\ The timid isolationist sought, on the other hand, to entirely isolate th.is country by avoiding contact wrth the various belligerent nations. The apellations \radical\ and \conservative\ refer not to the proponents van<>us political beliefs, but rather to the degree of isolationism the various adherents felt was necess~ry to keep this country out of war. In a later chapter, Professor Jonas points out that both the right and the left agreed on the basic tenets of isolationism. P?-OFESSOR MANFRED JONAS --------------- ------- powers. This is not to say isolationism disap- peared. The idea still carried strength until the formal entry of the United States into World War II. Pearl Harbor changed the views of everyone as to American involvement in World War II. Professor Jonas quotes Senator Vandenberg as saying \ 'That day ended isolationism for any realist.' \ The book concludes with a discussion of the resurgence of isolationism in the post war period. He states that this \nee-isolationism\ ar- gues the same lines as the isolationism of the thirties, but that it hasn't the same base. The situation has changed_ He states that this new isolationism is merely an \old nostalgia \ and is totally unrealistic. ' Preface search activity among the faculty, where :rnen can constantly ••test themselves\ with fellow educa· tors throughout the country. Dean Lockwood feels that ··not enough scholarly activity\ exists at Union \to hold people who are interested in it.\ This is not to be construed as a criticism of the faculty since the· college has not l\Sked for or encouraged research in the past and $ince avail- ability of research funds has been limited. Re- sources must be supplied in order to stimulate more activity, and it is hoped that in the future Union wiH never delineate a strict \publish or perish\ policy for research such as now exists at many lai,ge universities where the research s1tuation differs considerably. Evaluation With regard to the evaluation of teachers at Union, Dean Lockwood pointed out these areas: the recommendations of colleagues, the depart- ment chairman, and an advisory committee; com- parison within the college; and informal student criticism. Also, faculty members are judged on these points: 1) teachmg and professional contri- buttons ·2) involvement within the profession and 3) campus contr1butions. All of the above are giJides which the c0Uege uses to determine the worth of a facmty member. Also, a major factor not emphasized here is the person's \classroom personaliti'; an individual who simply cannot teach will not be retained. · Dr. Martin Lichterman, Dean of the Social Sciences and Humanities Center, feels further· more that tlle role of the college profess()!' has changed significantly from the image of an ivory- towered scholar that has existed in the past. Re- sponsibilities for guidance of the student are not so heavily placed upon facu:ty members today; many educators assume that the college student is also an adult, a view not altogether shared by administrat()rs. Dean Lichterman also commented that the diviSion today between researchers and teachers ls ·-~m art111c1al Olchotomy.\ 'J.'ne dtffer- entu1twn between the two cannot be pamted In blacK and Whlte absomtes. lie :telt that very few great teachers are not alSo \creatiVe scholars,\ <utnough great researchers are not necessaruy good teacher-s. A problem also exists in the deti· mtlon ot .. research,\ which can be used to de- scribe a fifth-grade report or graduate level in· vesttgatwn, and which shou1d be widely defined 1n tne lattoer situation. Breathing Dean Lichterman stated that at Union, ••drawmg ()fie's satary and one's breath\ atter appomtment does not insure attaining tenure. 'j_'ne el:lteria for appomtment to a tenu~ell ornce are bemg constd,ered here now. C1ear~y It is eas- ier to evaluate a man's scholarly pproctucts than h1s teachmg 1ikllls. ::iome schoo1s use an aa hoc con.Jmttee 1rom outside the school to uetelmme these skills; but here again, scholarship rather tnan the actual style of teaching is usuaJ..Iy meas- ured. With :vespect to a man's actuar teachmg ability, it seems that indirect knowledge, I.e. opin· ions of other department men and informal stu- dent evaluation, are the sole determinates of how an mdividuaL performs in the classroom. \Ob- servers\ from. the College are not used here as a 1 ule, but may make occasional visits to classes. Dean Lichterman feels that a \scientific\ method of judging facuity members should be \dreaded\· the process of evaluation here is a vety subjectiv~ one and shoul.jl continue to be so .. Moving specifically to the question of small colleges, Lichterman noted that for the teaching staff. at such a!l institution, the sit~~tion may be considered qtpte favorable. Relations between members can be on a close level due to the size of the faculty body. A light teaching lo!ld-espe- cially true at Union-and availability of research funds both e'Ilhance the situation. At Union, though, as Dean Lockwood previously noted, more government funds need to be provided for research areas. Another factor here is that more e~ucators seem to hold loyalties to their pr()fes- sron rather than to their schools at the large uni· versities; it is not unusual to find that important S.D.S. researchers will' move to \green€r pastures\ with· out qual!..:; whenever a better offer is made. vean Lichterman pointed to the misconcep- tic n t!lat it is more desirable to tea.ch graduate stuw::nts than undergrads. He emphasized that the n.ot1vation to do advanced work most ,often comJs from good teachers at the high school and unctergraduate college levels. Where young un- dergraduates are assigned to poorer professors and graduate fellows; the teach:ing profession is obviomly using its worst salesn'len and will only .ose by attracth1g fewer new members. Ul1ion has taken at least one positive step to obtaiFi new men in that the• Dept. of History for one has been advertising for teachers in the professional journals. Union's offers .are not un- attractive ( especiaHy in the 'rnst:vuctor and Ass<>- ciate Professor categories) since faculty salaries are increasing and since teaching loads are not heavy. Higher SalaFies Teachers, moreover, are not the only consid- eration here since .both students and faculty make the institution what it is_ .Dean Lichterman feels that a sizeable portion of the $30 million fund drive will be dedicated to ;this end, that is to more scholarship awards and to higher faculty salaries. Lichterman also feels. that a wider ge- ographical distribution of students, among its other benefits, would attract a better faculty. Referring again to the misconception that all \good\ men want to teach solely at the graduate level, Lichterman proposed rather that the desire to teach one level or another depended on the field, and of course, the individuaL He felt that some graduate opportunities-such as our pres- ent master's programs-are a ••healthy and de- sirable\ situation at small C()ltege. He pointed too to the possibilities of expanding the graduate facilities through association 'With SUNY at Al- bany, R.P.I., and other nearby schools similar to the program initiated by the University of Mass., Amherst and Smith Colleges. Such an arrange- ment would benefit the college in many ways, among them attracting new men who would have wider facilities at their disposaL Dean J_,ichterman Lastly poi:nted to the ad- vantage of seekmg teachers who have had experi- ence m the busmess world. Such men more otten than not will gain insights into their fields that make for better all around teachers. The com- petition for graduates which busines sis provid- ing to education is not altogether detrimental, since many fuH•time profesors ruay increase t)leir income through part-time conswtation w1th busi- ness &nd industry. Questions Although much of the foregoing material seems to indicate that the College is seriously mterested in providing the student with \vigor- ous young scholars,\ the question still remains as to whether th1s trend will yield scholars who are enthusiastic teachers or who are at best, mediocre lecturers_ It is stating the obvwus to say t~at for manY: individuals,_ lll~ch ~f the en· thusiasm for learnmg and realtnstght mto a par· trcU!at field are a direct resu-t of studymg under a bright, exciting and articulate professor. But a point which should be equa.dy as c.ear is that the individuals who stand to gain the most from this ty;pe of teacher have in effect the least to say about his value in the classroom. President Mar- tin once said that he knew of D() better way to discourage competent educators from joining an institution than by leaving the question of their reappointment up to the whims of the student body. Considered in the extreme situation, this is a valid contention. But it s[;!ems that the '~p­ posite extreme is in effect at Union, where ~ u- dent evaluation is sought only informally. Q r- tainly this is not a desirable situation, and mi ht be alleviated by direct consideration of stud nt opinion along with other criteria, when evalu· ations are made. How can we say that a man \cannot teach\ when classroom oiJservation and student opinion are not emphasized? Next weeli, the second of this part tw() senes ·will present some divergent points of vzew. All the isolationists based their arguments on certain ideas. The two main ideas were that the prevwus war was unnecessary, in terms of American involvement. The second idea was that if the United States should get involved in an- other war; it would come out of that war ine'.'- trieably bound to the fate of Europe and that 1t would not have a free hand in her foreign policy decisions. In the preface to the work, Professor Jonas states that he is not attempting to offer a syn· thesis, derived from the various conclusions of other historians Who have written on isolation- ism. Rather he was going to try and \define an aspect of isolationism previously glossed over or C<lmpletely ignored.\ The work offers no star- tling historical revelations, and no great predic- tions for the future. Rather, it is a study of the isolationism of the thirties, its manifestations and its bases_ It is a well documented, highly readable and perceptive review of this period of American history. Two representatives from Stu- dents for a Democratic Society will be on campus from Wednes- day, January 25 through Friday, January 27. They will be avail- : · able to talk informally with stu- Gents about S.D._S, activities.

Tangible Results Professor Jonas goes on to discuss the tangi- ble results of this theory of isolationism, the leg- islation passed, the comiiJ.ittees formed, and the statements that were made by various isolation- ists.

The events in the picture are, fe>r the most part, exceptionally and surprisingly plaus- '· ible, the characters are conscientiously drawn and the performances are all that could be called interesting, to say the least. The story has to do with a timid school· ·o If, master, played by Charles Laughton, who lives w1th a possessive mother and can't figure Ol!.t how to tell the girl next door that he loves her. Once the Germans have entered his town and British 1 , .~ planes start coming over with bom~s, he is di.s· tracted from his .purpose by an extravagant· fear of violence. He is inclined to withdraw into his shell until the whole thing blows over. The girl's brother, however, begins to indulge a fance :tor sabotage and finally raises a commo- tion that nobody can ignore. '!'he Germans take hostages and among them is the school-master 'fJ • who finds he is caught in something bigger than ·./himself. The manner in which he copes with the problems of responsibility and hardihood in the presence of a force that would annihilate bi'l entire way of life is the crux of the filn-...., Maureen O'Hara, as the girl, Is a peg above her usual self; George Sanders makes a very con- vincing tra1tor, and Walter Slezak combi)1es vii· lainy with almost too much guile as the German commander. Charles Laughton see!Il,'l the only member of the cast who has gone his own way (as one might expect) and at times seems a few . steps out of the basic rhythm. While the lten()ir- ' Nichols approach is surprisingly obvious and the- atrical at times (particularly in turning Laughton loose on a courtroom speech that runs almost a wll.ole reel), they have things to say that no film had uttered too clearly before. They th~kfully ' dare to make the Nazis and traitors quite human, an approach which makes their message all the more devastating. 5 Schlesinger: Opinions On Current Affairs Arfhus Schlesinger confronts newsmen trom three local television stations. By ALA~ ZIEGLER Arthur Iv!. Schlesinger, noted historian, Presi- dential advisor, and teacher, gave his candid views on current affairs in an interview, Monday, Jan- uar~, 16. Dr, .Schlesinger, coiJ:l..menting on the r~sponsi­ bility of the contemporary historian, d'few the line, at matters of \Clear national security,\ or matters of personal lives which have no his- torical significance. He therefore agreed th,at cer- tain deletions should have been made from Man- chester's book. ·~ Ted Sorenson In ~nother contemporary issue, Dr. Schlesinger was ·asked about Ted Sorensen's decision to work for 1\ew York Democrats and the charge \carpet- bagging.\ Schlesinger feels that there is no rea- son · why pne must \live all his life in a state befor.e he is considered qualified to help it.\ He favors England's poltical system which has no residency r.equ.;.rements at all \Sorensen he said, \qualifie as an American.\ Dr. Schlesinger would not venture a comment on the \mass exodus\ of Presidential advisors from Washington, indicating that they all bad the1r incuvidual reasons. .Neither woulct he :make a defimte statement on the tuture historical op- Inion of President Kennedy, other than he was .. remarkable\ and got the country to \sudde:nly move ahead.\ JJr. ;::,cnlesinger was questioned about the source of power m Washmgton in re1atie>n to tore1gn afhurs. l:ie discounted a \milltar;:y m- dustnal comp1ex\ controumg toreign pol:tcy, say- lng, \'!'here's no relatwn to the war m Vle&nam, whetherwise or not, and the needs of our -EC()ll· omy.\ .However he does feel that military minds were exertmg too great an mnuence.

I thmk the C.I.A. did get out of hand in the fifties but in the sixties its been pretty well restored to control. I hope.\ The <.'onversation then turned to the non-mili- tary aspects of the Vietnam situation and the pacification program. \I think it's natural that it has to be made but it's extremely difficult to have a pacification program. In the first place a war is still going on and the Viet Cong can slice across most of Vietnam with impunity, and in the sec<>nd place the true pacification program will involve actions which the large number of those who dominate the government in Sa_igo!l are unwillillg to permit in the way of redistri- bution of land holdings. The government of Saigon really doesn't give a damn about it any- way and is going through these motions to please the Americans. We can't do the job because we ·don't know the language, we don't know the folk ways, we don't know the traditions. It's hopeless to suppose that we can operate successfully. For all these reasons, noble as the effort is, one can- not be surprised that it hasn't made very much progress.\ He feels tha~ the only .people who can do it are the South Vietnamese. \I'm sure we can't do it for them.\ Future Policy As for future Vietnam policy, Schlesinger takes tne m10U1e ground, opposmg both pwung out and WLdenmg tlle war. ··1 thmK the emphasis on ·bomomg has nus!ed the Amencan peov1e as to the nawre 01 tne war and when ana huw the war 1s go,ng to oe won.

With the composer sitting in the . al!dience, the 'orchestra played superbly, especially the solo Student Nite at Willard pianist, Edward Hausman. The piano controlled the ;p~e~:.e, ~sounding dissC?nant at times .and like a Jlqwu1g harp at otber trme.s. At the climax the Philhatl:_honia, together with the composer, who was invited on stage, received a mighty ovation. After . 'Intermision, the group, with Hugh Allen' Wilson playing the harpsichord, performed C. P. E. Bach's CONCERTO IN G MAJOR, the seconO: · ·n.Qvel work: that evening. The harp- sich-ord-was the solo instrument, first taking the mel(fdy and then backing up the strings with count'er melodies~ The first movement was quite repetitious,· mo:ving along rapidly. . The !:lecon:d movement, Largo, cont~»ned ·beautiful melodic and counter melodic themes between the key- board and the strings, each eager to .gain the at~ tention of the listener. The harpsichord had an intricate· part to play, with many fafit-changing rhythms, exact phrases, and excellent d:y,namics, and Prof. Wilson played it all with artistic pre- cision; .Tl·l· _final movement, Presto, was a springy daqce. jn. hich the harpsich()rd was again the center of a ention.

The tll.ird move- ment was !he Pastorale and .J;tustic Dances that created a lifelike scene of twilight coming onto a new day, The last l}lovement was a Fugue, allegro, in which repetitive rhythm an~ melodic patterns brought the piece to its rapid termina- tion. in toto, the concert was grand and very en- joyable.

The Greek Anachronism Another :vear of rushing is over: another pledge class, another surfeit of ritual, another waste of time and effort. Union College proudly boasts that -if is the \Mother of Fraternities,\ Perhaps they were well-suited to the mid-nineteenth century when they were founded. But we d0ubt that these anachronisms bring any worthwhile bene- fits to the present college commun)_ty. President Martin has frequently commented on the need for Union to develop a sense of community. This goal can only be hindered by the presence of 16. se.mi- autonom0us domains, each jealousLy protecting its mem- bers from the savage life outside its fraternal womb. All too frequently, they have been bastions 'of prej- udice and reaction. It was only this academic year; a sup- posedly civilized era, that one'of·our chapters gained the freedom to pledge Negroes and Jews. And even if this eliminates, the formal rules against heterogeneity, the predilictions of so many people to try to establish an environment which will be totally lacking in the stimulation of :people different from themselves militates against true integration. This is especially obvi- ous in two houses which are nearly totally Jewish, but it is more real, though less visible, in the house that specializes in a home for the athlete, engineer or superstud preppy. have greatly beneficial effects would be the elimination of We fail to see any counterbalancing gain from this system, to the college as a whole and the people involved as individuals. Many alternatives would be an improve- ment. One of the best of these alternatives would be the abolition of the dormitory system and the substitution of a house plan. A start has been made toward this goal with the institution of the dormitory council. It should be strengthened by giving each unit the right to elect its own officers who will have the same · responsibility over the house as do the fraternity presidents now. They will also be able to hold house parties or other social events as they see fit. Another change in the housing situation which could have breatly .beneficial effec.ts, would be the elimination of the freshmen segregating into separate dormitories. This segregation only reinforces 'the juvenility that a college education supposedly is to induce them to outgrow. These changes cannot be undertaken overnight. But the various legislative bodies should begin immediately to devise methods by which. these goals can be accomplished. In the meantime, Union should discontinue its pre- ferential policy toward the fraternities. Specifically, it should appoint its own stuae'il.t officials who would reside ih the fraternity houses. ·cAMPUS ,C.ALENDAR · Thur!'l!lay, Jauum-y 19: Harplschord Recital, Hugh Allen Wilson, 8:30 p.m ..

LBJ: Right Move, Wrong Time This is the first of a two pa1't m·ticle on the P1'esident's eco- nomic policy. By MARTIN GIDEONSE President Lyndon B. Johnson has heralded a return to Eisen- hower Economics in his State of the Union proposal to impose a 6% surcharge on individual and corporate income taxes. The pro- posal comes as a surprise since observers seemed to have reached a consensus that, barring a con- tinued acceleration of federal ex· 'penditures, a tax increase would be unwise at the present time. Six months ago, the consensus, with some exceptions (myself included), would have favored such a tax rise. At that time, consumer prices were in a rather rapid rise, . and fears . were expressed that supply and a growth in per man develops in American industries, 0 .

With ' By RICHARD PATTERSON, JR. ''We are mad. We believe that the NCAA shouldn't have the right to tell our ; faculty what our eligibility rules should be. It should be left to the college.\ This was the way Professor Wilford H. Ketz, ·Chairman of the Athletic Department, explained his participation in the vain atte:Qlpt to change the 1.6 rule for athletic eligibility at the annual meeting of the National Collegiate Athletic. As- sociation in Houston, January 9•11. The NCAA rules states that any member in- stitution may not enter a team in an NCAA sponsored meet unless the institution limits its scholarship or grant-in-aid awards (for which the recipients athletic ability is considered in any de- gree) and eligibility \ ... to incoming students who have a predicted grade point average of 1.6, and also limits subsequent scholarships and eligi- bility for athletic participation to athletes with at least a 1.6 academic average for the prev.ious year.\ Little Trouble and, investors to invest in Moreover, Prof. Ketz pointed out that Union has little seen an un- trouble meeting the NCAA standards.

Coleman Assumes Reins From Ketz By MU{E FUCHS The aches and pains of Union athletes a.re .being administered to by a new addition t() the Union College coaching staff. Ronald C())'eman is currently trainer during Bob Leonard's ye.ar long sabbatical. The personable young ,c()ach has also been in charge of indoor track for the past two weelrs, while coach Ketz attended an NCAA conference in Houston. Coach Coleman, a 1962 graduate of Spring- field College, has had extensive high school coach· ing experience. He was head wrestling and track coach and assistant football coach at Watchung Hills Regional High School in New Jersey~ he· fore coming to Niskayuna High School, wl!ere he was assistant coach in all three of these sp()rts. At Union, Coach Coleman will be head outdoor track coach this spring, succeeding Coach Ketz. Next year he will also be assistant freshman :foot- ball coach and wrestling coach on the freshman or varsity level. Presently, Coach Coleman is concerned 'With the upcoming Sprin~ track season. He feels that winter track is ch1efiy a conditioner for the spring, although the Garnet will, as of now, par. ticipate in four meets, including the Uni()n In· vitational on March 11th. It is too early for Coach Coleman to appraise Union's talent. He feels the talent is there, however, though the Ga:rnet may have its usual depth problems. 'Whatever th.e case, Coach Coleman promises to have the Garnet in shape for the spring. He also hopes to recruit by pushing small college competition ben· efits which attracted him to Union. 7 The Big Time: ''<:''l·c;ji~: .. %:, :;::);i~;J\Jf;;;:t;mWi~@!mll?i!i'i~;i:l!lM:)rd!i'ii\'#l : ;,:. 2::' ..

In an interview with Coach Bob Ben- soH, varsity swimming coach, it was learned by this reporter that he sti:ll plans to have a respectable season, despite the loss of Paul Shields far the remainder of the season. Talking about the team's loss to ~V'illiams College last week, he said, \I was quite happy about the team's performance; Steve Wedin and Dick ·Corrigan had excellent times and missed their best times of last year by fractions· of a ~econd. However, I am sure we will greably miss Paul Shields. He was a fine swimmer ancl athlete; yet I am confident that the team, with its great sophomore effort, will l>e able to overC()JUe this. Although I originally predicted an 8-2 season, I believe now that we will be quite lucky to ap. proach this.\ * * ~= * Bruce Allison, the Dutchman wrestling and lacrosse coach, told this veporter that he was counting on two imp()rtant factors in order to Frosh Hoopsters By LEN SIMON The fresh.man basketball team, after drop- ping its first encounter of the season to Allred Friday night, exploded to a new team scoring record in crunching the Hobart frosh, 1.05-79. Phenomenal is the only word to describe Union's shooting as they broke the century bar· rier despite being outrebounded by tbe taller Hobart team. Also they accomplished th.e feat while using all twelve squad members lil>erally. Bary Katzman, demonstrating amazing moves and ballhandling, led the barrage with 21, many of them twisting drives through the taller States- men. Steady Jim Getman tallied 16; R()ger Har- rison had 14, and both contributed to th.e Garnet rebounding. . ··h---· '-~·:-~ .• ,;~-- ;.;.;,. •.•;.,. ···~ ... ~J.<•;·:•;w . • .• ;.;._ •. ,.,.;.~;::'_p;.;,. ,, -'· .......... .;_-. ;.,.,:•;•.••.•i.•:•. •' _.;.,.

With the loss of Cliff Feldman am! Joe James for the season, it will be interesting to see how Evans will overcome this. Good Luck Coach! * * .;!l * With the departure of Professor Ketz and Coach Allison as track and wrestling coaches, re- spectively, there appears· to be a shake-up in the Department of Athletics. This reporter sees one of two possibilities occurring: the grooming of Coach Allison for the position of Head of the Athletic Department or the possible appointment of Coach Allison to the varsity f()otball staff. Set Scoring Mark Though in the game only sporadically, center Bob Wiley hit for 11 points. Pete Garrison, in foul trouble throughout the game had 10, and Craig Carlson, helping Katzman engineer the Garnet attack, got 9. The first half was reasonably close, ending with the score 56-46. The sho()ting of Union was almost offset by the rel>ounding of Hobart. This condition was due partly to the loss of Bill Boe- hmke, 6'6\ center, who is injured. Friday night the story was a little different, as Alfred defeated the frosh, 85-68. Failure to work together hurt the Garnet, playing their first game. Alfred had had nine previous freshman encounters. Carlson led the scoring with 19, while Garrison had 15. ··-------------------------------------.---------------------------------------------------------------------------- News With all n.

ACLU Page 3 Concordy Sports AMERICAN ~SOllATIO'N;ISM Page4 Super Bowl: I 'I Cagers Defeat Alfred, Hobart; Extend Winning Streak .to Four Matmen Optimistic; Sophs Impressive; Open With Hobart Meaning less $ •) ~--- By LEN SIMON Union's streaking basketball team defeated Alfred and Hobart last wekend, run- ning their win streak to four games, and leaving their record at 5-3. Tomorrow they travel to Binghamton to face Harpur. Friday night the Garnet was led by C aptairr Greg Olson who scored 26 points in the 71\65 victory over the Saxons, now 4-7. Union streaked to an early 11-1 advant- age,. but Alfred slowly fought back and trai led by only one point with 16 seconds re- maining. Then Bill Priscott sank two big free ·throws under pressure to ice the deci- sion. Fitz Turner and Olson also added free throws in the closing seconds to account for the final margin of victory. BY JEFF KURZIUS Headed by a group of promising sopho· mores, the Garnet matmen are looking for- ward to a successful season. The grappl~:~;s will • try to improve on a 7-2 record compi'led in 1965-66. The squad is well-balanced and in top . shape for the opener at Hobart on Saturday, Sophomore Frank D'Antuono at 123, letter- , man Ron Ianotti at 130, and sophomore Jeff · . Kurzius at 137 will provide strength in the · lower weight class. The middle weights will 1 be placed in the hands of sophomores Tom Tripp at 145, Dick Rosener at 152 and senior Dave Read at 160. Rounding out the squad . will be sophomore Brian Crandall at 167, let- terman Barry Cornwall at 177,. and senior AI Baskous at heavyweight. Additional matches will be wrestled .by newcomer Stu Rubin at 115, and Pete Kenyon at heavyweight. Frosh l.ook Strong Coach Allison and freshman coach Jan Werner both feel confident that the freshman team will outdo last year's 3-2 record. The starting team for the Hobart opener will pe Bill Munno-123, Ron Ruhl-130 Tony Carpm- ello-137 Jeff Knetzer-145, Rich Ferreras-152; Ian Biggi-160, Steve Taylor-167, Naysin Simon- 177, Chuck Sinno-191, and Bill Dwyer-un- limited. Bowling Sunday, January 15 1 will go down in sports . as the date of the first \Super Bowl.\ But what did this game prove? Nothing at all! The Kansas City Chiefs were heavy under- . dogs-2 touchdowns according to the bookies, ·a ·• or mor{) if you listened to your loc~tl sportswriter. For one half they played the mighty Green Bay Packers almost to a standstill. 'l'he Chief's line dumped Bart Starr twice in one set of downs, a !eat very infrequently accomplished by NFL op- .ponents. Starr's counterpart at quarterback, Len Dawson, was faking so deftly that h,e hacl tl;le Packers chasing etnpty:handed hall carriers, and t the cameramen focusing on meaningless pile-ups. Mike Garrett, though too small to run through NFL mammoths, got away for several big gains . At intermisison Green Bay led, 14:-10. Early in the second half Willie Wood inter- cepted a poorly thrown pass and 1·an it back to easy striking range .. As WilLie so aptly expressed after the game, the Packers never guess, but they ,do anticipate certain things. This break shocked the Chiefs and caused their disintPgration. They succt~mbed to three f'a~kers scores in the second half and lost 35-10. Wouldn't a break for the Chiefs at the same .point in the game have given them victory? Does this game prove NFL superiority? Vince is con- vinced. How about you? Garnet and Statesmen cagers leap high for rebound in 84-72 Garnet win, but where's the ball? Olson put on his finest show of the year. In addition to his scoring prowess, he also added three rebounds and five assists to the Garnet cause, despite being in foul trouble most of the game. scored 13, while Olsen and Jim Derrick tallied 12 each. ~he Garnet showed a flashy fast break at- tack as they jumped to an early 14 point advant- age. Time and again a series of quick passes downcourt ended with a hoop, while many at- tempts to set it up failed. With about 10 minutes gone the reserves took over and continued the excellent attack. The halftime score was 43-2B. By GARY PREVOST Second-place Bernie's' Mid-Hill Tavern moved a point closer to first place in Dutch Classic League action last week by tak- ing four points from Sealtest Foods. Howie Goldberg led the way for Bernie's with a 555 while Ken Merchant followed with a 537. Bob Ackley scored 491 for Sealtest. DUNGAREE- While quarterbacking the Garnet attack, Tom Urbelis tallied 13 points, eight rebounds, and five assists. His playmaking and defense ac- counted for many Union two-pointers. Knight Hits 12 Also hitting double figures was Tad Knight, with a dozen. His nine rebounds contributed greatly to the Garnet overall advantage on the boards of 4:2-29. Fitz Turner had nine rebounds and the same number of points. Captain Ron Giancola, bothered by a back injury, and Bill Priscott, in foul trouble, both had off-nights get- ting three and six: points respectively. Adding to Union's board strength were Jim Derrick and AI Hrdlicka, making his first ap- pearance. The winners hit an even 50% from the field, while connecting on 15 of 26 at the charity stripe. The next night Union led all the way, and only a liberal use of the bench by Coach Evans kept Hobart from being slaughtered. The 84-72 final score does not demonstrate the ease with which the Garnet outplayed the Statesmen. Fitz Turner led a balanced attack that fea- tured five in double figures. The junior center scored 16, while hauling down 13 rebounds. Gian- cola, still somewhat hobbled, nevertheless played a sparkling game and scored 14. Urbelis again In tram urals Hobart Surprises Hobart surprised Union with an effective full court press which cut the advantage briefly to only five points. When that was solved, the re- serves again entered. The Garnet once held a 22 point lead. 'l'he Garnet hoopsters now seem headed for an interesting and successful season. This turn- about seems to have resulted from a more cohe- sive team effort, and an attempt to fast-break more often. Also, Fitz Turner has come into his own on defense, blocking several Hobart shots from the key and the corner. Priscott, despite two mediocre games, has emerged as the best outside shot. Knight has taken over ably inside, moving well around the basket. 'The Garnet need only improve on their foul shoDting, and play more consistently, rather than in spurts, and they should look forward to a strong season. Many interesting pairings are re- maining on the schedule, including home and away contests with R.P.I., enjoying one of its finest seasons in a while. First place Top's Bar held onto a four point league lead by downing Kelly's Bar three points to one. Top's' was led by Jim Stratton 232-562, Gary Prevost 533, and Tom Benedict 222-512. Jack Trentleman was high for Kelly's with 494. Top's Bar had high team single and triple for the night with 899 and 2506 re· spectively. Vito's Boys took three points from Caruso's Bar as Doug Vergit had 516. Don Hovey scored 547 for the losers. Moffet's Liquor Store won three points from Teddy K's Tavern behind John O'Kane's 505. Dick Patterson had career highs of 202 and 495 for the losers. Jim Stratton has taken over first place in the individual aver- age race with 182. Paul Gerber follows with 181, and Gary Pre- vost has 180. EASTERN AVENUE PIZZERill 860 Eastern Ave. WE DELIVER PIZZA There are no iobs at Union Carbide • • only careers!

PRICE 15 CENTS LOCKWOOD IS NAMED TRINITY PRESIDENT By JOSEPH MANN and RICHARD PAT'FERSO!\i Last week, Union (;ol'egc an- nounced that Theodore D. Lockwood, Provost and Dean of the Facu~ty, had been chosen as the next president of Trinity Co!lege in Hartford, Conn. Dean Lockwood will take office in June of 1968 when Trinity's presi- dent Dr. Albert C. Jacobs retires. Th~ ~h~ice was made at a meeting of Tnmty s board of Trustees on Jan- uary 14, but was not announced until Union's Trustees were notified. Union's President Harold C. Martin commented last week: • ·we are, of course, both happy for Dean Lock- wood and his family and proud that one of our number has been elected to the presidency of Trinity Col!ege. At the same time, we are very sorry to lose him from our own institution. Martin Praises \In the three years he has been at Union College, Dean Lockwood has been a remarkably effective devel- oper of curricu~um and a fine ad- ministrator. He has earned and we1 ·deserved the rel)pect of .everyone here, and he and his family have also become a valuable part of the Schme- nectady community. My personal in- debtedness to him is very great but I take satisfaction in knowing that, as president of Trinity College, he remains my colleague. We all wish him good fortune, and we congratu- late Trinity on its percipience in choosing him.\ Lockwood's Response Dean Lockwood's response to the news of his appointment, reported in the Hartford Courant, was: \I am of course deeply honored by election as the next president of Trinity Col- lege, to succeed Dr. Jacobs upon his retirement in June of 1968. I look forward to working with Trinity stu- dents, faculty and trustees on the many chalienges which confront the liberal arts college of tomorrow; for it is clear that these colleges must continue to provide the innovative thrust upon which higher education in this country depends. My family and I welcome this occasion to return to Hartford and the Trinity College community.\ Dean Lockwood stated that he did not plan to move to Hartford unti1 June of 1968 and that he would not attempt to make any evaluations or form any real plans for the college until he took over as president. He said that Trinity had been aware of Jacob's plans for retirement in 1965 and had appointed a committee last year to find a successor. Trinity is a Liberal Arts College with an enroll- ment of approximately 1200 students and a program of study similar to Union's. Jac::>bs Comments The 42-year-old dean will be the 15th president of Trinity and the sixth a·umnus to head ihe college ~hich was founded in 1823. Regard: mg _Dean Lockwood's appointment, P\esrd~nt Albert G. Jacobs of Trinity sard: I have of course known Dr. Lockwood well as an administrator in sister institutions and also ·be- cause of his effective efforts as an a:umnus of Trinity, as a member of the college's Board of Fellows, as well as a trustee elected by the alum- ni. I eonsider him, on the basis of his background, experience and ability extremely well qualified for the post to which he has been elected. I have already communicated to him my ex- pression of sincere good wishes on the important responsibilities he will eventually assume on behalf of the college. I wish him Godspeed.\ Formulated Changes Since his arrival at Union, Dr. Lockwood has been deeply involved in formulating many of the changes that have taken place here since l!:i64. He led the major reform in the col:ege's curriculum which brought about the new three course system the three term academic calendar' and the equally new comprehensiv~ education program. He has devoted much of his time in the last three years to reviewing existing programs and concepts, and planning and de- veloping new ones. Because of the significant growth of both the student body and the faculty, it was felt that a redistribu- tion of administrative responsibility was necessary. The Dean was instru- mental in developing the structure of the two new centers (Humanities and Science and Engineering which brought about this aim.) Dean Lockwood cited the develop- ment of the All College Council as one of the most rewarding projects with which he has been involved dur- ing his stay here. He called the ACC \a significant move in the right direc- tion\ to improving communications between faculty, students, and admin- istration. Martin's Arrival \Dramatic\ He described the arrival of Presi- dent Martin on campus as \the most dramatic event\ of these three years. He said that Dr. Martin has \added a major push to the college's forward motion.\ The Dean has worked closely with the President for the past one and a half years in an at- tempt to define more sharply the fu- turc goals of the college. \Under Pr.cs. Martin, the coHege has really begun to move,\ he said. One of Lockwood's first tasks on arrival at Union, was to advise for the development of the data process- ing center and the computer system now in use. Later, in 1965, he served as chlef administrative officer of the college during the interval between the departure of the late t:arter Davidson and the arrival of Presi- dent Martin. Worked With Students Although Dean of the Facu:ty is principally an administrative position, the Dean said he especially enjoyed his opportunities to work with the students, both as a teacher in the Comp. Ed. program and as a member of the ACC. Even with his heayy ad- ministrative schedule, Dean Lock- wood managed to teach one of the new Comp. Ed. courses in the fall of 1966. He has a!so been advising some seniors on their projects. He pointed out the need of any administrator to keep in touch with students. \After all,\ he said, \we are here for the students, not for ourselves.\ Before coming to Union, Dean Lockwood taught at Dartmouth and Juanita Colleges and at the Mass. Institute of Technology. ln 1960, he was appointed associate dean of the faculty at Concord College in Athens, West Virginia, and in 1961 became dean of the faculty at Con- cord, a post he held until coming to Union in 1964. Dean Lockwood is a 1948 grad- Continued on Page .3 ACC .Members Reluctant To Discuss Secrecy By RICHARD BALAGUR The ACC formed last year, as an. instrument of \increased communica- tion\ has become the subpe~t of much controversy when it closed its fiJ.\st meetings. · Many of the council members ex- pressed fears that an open meeting or one with a reporter present would cause the council members to speak less freeglybcut down on its effective- ness and su ject it to pressure groups. A resolution stating: John Cage considers himself a com- poser \for instruments and non-in- struments.\ He boasts that the elim- ination of harmony is his major con- tribution to music.

His 1952 composition Water Music is listed by its publisher as com- posed \for a pianist, also a radio; whistle, water containers, and. a deck of cards.\ Cage's collaborator, dancer Merce Cunningham says that, \sequence and continuity are totally irrelevent\ to dance. Cunningham started out with the Martha Graham Dance Company where he danced in Every Soul Is a Circus and Aaron Copeland's Ap- palachian Spring. Cage and Cunningham have col· laborated in The Season, Aeon, and Summers pace. Photos Without Camera Len Lye is the inventor of the \Direct Technique\ of painting or etching images directly on film.

The February 2nd issue of Concord- iensis will mark the debut of Joseph Mann, '68, - as the paper's Editor-in- Chief. Mann, who succeeds Robert Stolzberg, '67, was promoted from Campus Editor. Concordy's Senior Board members are: .Jaek Etkin '68, Business Manager; Alan Ziegler, '69, Features Editor; Rieb.ard Balagur '69, News Editor; Michael Levin-Epstein '69, Sports Editor; Dick Daniel '70, Phot()graper, and Cliff Safane, '69, Music Editor. Serving on the Junior Board will be: Henry Rines '68, Associate Busi- ness Manager; Ala~ Klein. '69, As- soc. News Editor; Gary Prevost '69, Assoc. Sports Editor, and Alvin Levi '.69, Assistant Sports Editor. Changes? Mann does not plan to assume the same manner of editorial posture as the controversial Stolzberg, His Senior Board will have a weighty hand in the creation of editorial policy, a significant departure from his predecessor's operation. But the editor's decisions remain final. Etkin remains Business M:anager. Through his efforts Concordy has been able to run a record number of pages. Also, Levin-Epstein remains head of the sports department. He had taken over from Andy Colb at the start of this academic year. Zieg- ler also became Features Editor at the beginning of the year. Balagur was promoted to the posi- tion of News Editor, although he had functioned in that post since it be- came vacant in OctobeJ'. Daniel, the only freshman on the Senior Board, is Concordy's only regular photogra- pher. With respect to the Junior Board and the rest of his personnel, Mann said, \The Concordy staff at present is a good one. Its membership is, un· fortunately, small, since the stigma of a house-controlled paper still re· mains. I sincerely hope that mem- bers of the Class of 1970 will take more interest in the paper than has been evidenced to date.\ .

In a Concordiensis poll the faculty members of the ACC were generally reluctant to take a definite stand un the issue of ACC secrecy for fear of being misinterpreted or of having prejudged the issues. Many expressed a willingnes sto discuss their ·votes after the meeting but others would be reluctant to do so unless this were the decision of the Council. Student members stated their posi- tions much more forcibly. Frank Mc- Kim, Secretary of the ACC felt, \In some circumstances the ACC might operate more efficiently in closed ses- sion\ but added the ACC was created with communication as on.e of its pri- mary puposes.

2 CouncilApprovesido.lA utonotny; Benjatnin Blasts Concordy Editor \Now it seems as if \'·e are transposing the system into possible one man control through the veto system, which I feel would be disastrous if an editor as irresponsible or as willing to per- vert his editorial power as the past Concordy E.'ditor were to be elected.\ This statement made by Doc Benjamin high- lighted debate o\'cr a proposal, presented at the Student Council meeting last Tuesday night which would establish an election procedure for the editor of the IDOL. In m interview after the meeting, Benjamin explaill:.ed that he really meant the present editor, E()b Stolzberg, and not the past editor. He explained that his accusation of irresJ?onsibility was based in part on disagree- ment w1th Mr. Stolzberg's editorial stance. He mentioned last week's edit()rial calling for the abolition of fraternities as m example. Section Sfx Benjamin's objection C()neerned section six of the proposed election pr()cedure, which pro- vides that \the retiring editor shall have a veto over the final choice. A veto can he overridden by a three:fifths majority.\ Other council mem· bers echoed Benjamin's objections, expressing a fear that if the campus publications were granted autonomy, present objections. to the various pub· lications would not be elim.inated. Among the objections voiced was the <lamination of a publi· cation by one fraternity hous-e. Defending the veto power granted to the re- tiring editor of the IDOL, Don Abood, sponsor of the proposal, argued that only the editor can fully understand the demands and responsibilities placed upon the editor of tlu IDOL. The retir- ing editor is in the best p()sition to judge the qualifications of applicants ft>r the editorship Abood further stated that tlte .. merit system\ is the best basis for determining a successor to that position. Despite objections of some council members to the election procedure, the proposal was ap- proved. Committee PrOtposal 4.

Heating Hiatus :By RAL ROSS College buildings were left without heat Thursday morning because of an excessive de· mand placed on the old steam plant. The recent wave of severe cold required large amounts of heat in all parts of the campus. In past years this would have easily been provided by the old steam plant.

In recent years the load on the steam plant has risen from 17,000 to as much as 33,000 lbs. per hour. Normally, the steam load for ~he c~l­ lege is handled by only one of the two boilers 1n the old plant. The recent demands on the one boiler which was in operation at the time caused it to blow its safety valve. Two hours were re- quired to reset the safety valve and to fire up the other boiler. Another hour was needed to build up pressure in the boilers, a three-hour heat stoppage resulted. .. . ~- SJJ Text of the PrOtposal New Heating Plant 1 . Elections wlll be held at t:he end of the winter term: notices will appear k1. .the Concordiensis as to the closing date for applications. Fortunately, the heating problems which plague the school should soon be alleviated. The new steam plant equipped with three boilers is expected to go into operation early in February. Two of these boilers are rated at an output of 35 000 to 40,000 lbs. per hour. This should take care of any ro~seeable heating demands. Accord- ing to the mamtenance foreman, destruction of the old heating plant \vill begin after the new plant operates successfully for one month. 2.

MYERS STUDENT SHOP 131 Wall St. (Cor. State) TED VINICK '43, Prop. ·- ·n· It's trade-in lime for tired old myths. Like the one about business. Especially big business. That it is beyond the rugged individualist\s wildest daydream to enter this holy of holies because he'll lose some~ thing that's very sacred - like his inde- pendence. Sure, it can happen. If a guy or gal wants to hide,. or just get by, or not accept responsibility, ()f challenges. We're not omniscient enough or stupid enough to speak for all business, but at a company like Western Electric, bright ideas are n()t only welcome, they are en- couraged. And no door is shut. Create a little stir, go ahead, upset .an old apple- cart (we replace shibboleths at a terrific pace - we h.ave to as manufacturing and supply unit of the Bell System -in order to provide your Bell telephone company with equipment it needs to serve you.) There's an excitement in business. True, we're in it te> ltlake a profit, but working to find new and better ways to make things that help people communicate is very re- warding and satisfying. Did you ever hear these wry words of Oliver Wendell Holmes? \Never trust a generality - not even tl1.is one.\ That's how we feel about the generality that claims you'll just become a little cog in a company like Western Electric. You might, of course, but if you consider your- self an individual now, odds are 10 to 1 that you'll keep your individuality. And cherish. it. And watch it grow. Even at big, big Western Electric.

While at Trinity, he played varsity football and was valedictorian of his class. A history scholar, Lockwood was e '.ected to membership in Phi Beta Kappa and Pi Gamma Mu societies; he was also active in extra-curricular activities. After graduation, he went c n for graduate work in Modern European History at Princeton, where he earned his M.A. and Ph.D. de- grees. Dean Lockwood has written a number of papers and monographs on topics in modern European his- tory, especially Belgian history. He is a veteran of the lOth mountain division in Europe during World War II for which he served as historian. Lockwood also coached skiing at Har- vard from 1957-1959 while teaching at M.I.T. Received Award In 1965, Lockwood received a special award from the Alumni Coun- cil for meritorious service to Union College. He is presently chairman of the board of Volunteers for Inter- national Technical Assistance, Inc. and of the Northeastern New York Philharmonia. A member of the First Unitarian Society of Schenectady, Lockwood was also coordinator of the International Institutional Affiliation Project at the University of Dakar in Senegal, Africa.

They felt thl\t Union College is much like jnany other col- leges and universiUes i~ the U.S. There is neither lj,n in- ordinate number of liberals or conservatives present. There are issues which concern many students. The: dra~t, the new housing regUiat~ons,, the qJ.!.ality of and assunmpUons inh~rent in the type of education offered here are all important to many of the men. Throughout the country students are demanding more control oyer what kind of education they are to get, and .f- over _ the regulations of ·their school.

IWCDONNELL The climate of St. Louis offers the mental and physical stimulation of four distinct seasons. How can you enjoy a warm fire without a new snowfall for comparison? What other natural phenomena than spring brings such a lift to your spirits? Who has failed to enjoy the comfort of a summer morning or the crisp smell of an autumn afternoon? 5. McDonnell's suburban location allows you to choose from th¢ total spectrum of living locations. You may like the pace of apartment life at the heart of this 2¥2 million person metropolis. Or you might like the nearby suburbs with small city atmosphere and tree-lined . streets. Just as convenient are rural areas, where you can live apart - from the hustle yet be close enough to enjoy city-living advantages. 6. Naturally you want to earn your way and you want all you can earn. McDonnell wages are competitive with that of other industries. But being competitive isn't enough after you begin to show your mettle. Then, it is corporate policy to recognize the unique and indi- vidual efforts of those who strive for and achieve engineering excellence. Success will stem from a combination of inspiration and perspiration ... probably 10% of the former and 90% of the latter. But if you're willing to work, you'll never need to worry about your economic and organizational progress at McDonnell. 7. Facilities at McDonnell are second to none in space. advanced aircraft and automation. You'll find organizational and physical work- ing conditions that complement yollr skills and education. McDonnell testing and development facilities range from man-rated space cham- bers to Mach 28 wind tunnels, laboratories from microbiology to qpti~, computers from analog th.rough hybrid to digitaL You will find McDonnell is a team organization and nowhere is teamwork as essential as in the aerospace industry. Team organizations keep you from becoming a desk-bound engineer and stimulate the exchange of experience and knowledge so necessary to the development of wisdom. 8~ The Gateway to Space is in St. Louis. You'll be working with the experienced men at McDonnell who designed the aircraft, and space- craft that have, for a decade, dominated aerospace technology. McDonnell is strongly oriented toward government contracting. It has demonstrated the talent that provides exceptional national service while returning worthwhile earnings to investors. As the fastest growing segment of our national ec<>nomy, the Government provides a stable and continuing marketplace for those companies whose organization is oriented toward effectively serving the Nation's needs. 9. You may feel you've had enough education, but you'll soon decide to seek more. The McDonnell College Study Plan encourages self development a,nd offers economic assistance plus adjusted work week benefits for advanced degree studies directly related to your job responsibilities. Many private and public colleges and universities in the area offer applicable pr<>grams. 10. Nowhere in industry can a young engineer find rnore job sat- isfaction than in contributing to national advancements in air and space. At McDonnell, pride in workmanship is a habit nurtured by the national acclaim that is the reward for success. r-----~-------------------------------------------------------~ : For more information about McDonnell as your future and St. Louis as your home, C()m(llete this coupon. : J.

4 Opinion: Brook F arDI Revisited Ey DON ABOOD Now that the \new\ Union administr-ation has flexed its muscles, all of us can settle back (like an all white neighborhood about to be blockbusted) and talk about our need for a sense of communJty. So far this academic year it's been shown that a representative sampling of students object to a residential policy, that the ACC does not reflect student opinion and is ineffective when con- fronted with major policy decisions, and that a movie will possibly be made to \sell\ Union to people outside the college gates. Instead we ought to concentrate on selling the product to the stu· dent. Regardles of new curriculum changes and renewed interest in the arts, on however small a scale, a lot of students are not buying. Abolishing fraternities will not solve any- thing. To say that sixteen small communities conflict with the overall se:nse of a single large community is absurd. Fraternities function with- in the system, not outside it. Rights On the one hand we speak of individual rights. We free the campus press from legisla- tive control. We condemn the secrecy of the .ACC and hurl tirades against the inadequacy of the Student Council. We iight residential policies, compulsory gym, and forced convocations. All in the name of individual rights. Yet, we reverse the situation and suggest that college community and fraternity are in- compatible and ask legislative bodies to look into the prohlem - the same legislative bodies we condemn for violation of student rights. like it, go elsewhere attitude,\ a bookstore th.at un- derorders textbooks because if one goes u.nsold they lose profit, and a conservative aloof attitude on the part of both faculty and student. Union 'badly needs a social center for both independents and fraternity men, that offers similar advantages of a fraternity. The establish- ment of such a center implies choice, and allows the fraternity system to live or die on its own merits. Administrative pressure in the area of fraternities without such an alternative only wid- ens the gap in community relatio11s. Thursday, January 26, 1967 Teaching At Union: Graves Suggests Diversity. In Faculty Personalities' By JOSEPII A. MANN,. JR. In the first part of this article, printed in Concordiensis last week, the author examined Union's administrative policy concerning the selection of new faculty members. Be also con- sidered the point .that students, who stand to gain the most from outstanding teachers, have in reality the least to say about whether such teachers stay at Union. Another question must be raised as to the adm:nlstration's view that \vigorous young srho:ars\ should be the primary object of re- cru:tment. Clearly, the practical reasons for hir- ing young faculty members are valid; but to say that we shou!d seek predominantly young men, and to feel further that these men will yield most of our crop of real teaching men are unreason- able contentions. Perhaps it would be better to say that \You.ng blood sometimes sets the oLd blood running, and just as often, recruiting old blood may help to stimulate circulation.\ Misg(!ided Concept funds for this purpose to the Union campus; and third, an arrangement such as Dean Lichermen proposed which wou~d link Union with larger nearby universities and could thereby provide adequate research facilities for those who were interested in scholarly activity on a widd' ~cope than Union wishes to seek.

Substitution of a house plan with elected officers and social events stiH sep- arates the campus into small communities. Inte- gration of freshmen into upperc1ass dorms pre- supposes that fraternities wil be eliminated, and that we will all blend peacefully together in a collegiate Brook Farm. The humanitles and sci- ence centers will b1:1 colored grey to conform with the other architecture. Is the student to be blended into the same dull pattern? Another misguided idea, that most good fac- ulty members will inevitably turn to better re- search facilities (and graduate students) than Union can or wants to afford, seems equally absurd since this concept precludes any desire on Union's part to find men who are eager to teach at a small institution. And certainly these men do exist. Furthermore, this idea seems to stand in contradiction to some things noted earlier: first, that Union is not seeking men who are simply researchers, hut who are teachers and in- vestigators, men who are above all interested in teachi11g undergraduates and who be satisfied with the research funds and facilities we expeet to have available; second, in regard to research itself, the college is attempting to direct more Professor Clare W. Graves, Profes;.or ·of Psychology and a Union graduate, l:;ave some very interesting ideas on what might be uone to benefit the situation here for teachers and stu- dents alike. First,. he agrees that some t<'3chers at the college level do lose touch with th<> \pace and direction\ of their fields through lack r;f con- tact with current research. A good tc·acher, though, by the very definition of the term must s~ay acquainted with what is going on in lus field. He fee1s that we are following a myth when we contend that those who do not contributu scholar,y research cannot possibly be good teach- CIS. This is nothmg more than .saying that 011ly those who publish can be judged as fine educa- tors . .And what ·of the published material itself? lt 1s not dtfficult to find considerable amounts of ·•meaningless material\ in journals today, material which is wirtten merely for th•,; sake of being published. It should be clear that pro- ducmg great quantities of \scholarly m:.terial\ does not guarantee that a man 1s even a t1•.crably poor teacher; and to say that nne teachers will always be outstanding researchers is .ie~st as much of a misconception. ,, , The po< ' hensive. as well quently heavy il Diverse Before we condemn fraternities as the root of all campus segregation, we ought to consider the number of diverse personalities at Union, an administration that maintains an \if you don't Faculty Column: According to the article, fraternities do not dis- rupt the feeling of community. .... -· .. :~.' ·. ~--~-~-=:~-~ ,.::. .. : .

The Presi- years, reminiscent of the familiar dent's budgetary policy will, barring Adcliticnal Argument A return to the balance of payments difficulties, such as they may have been in the fifties, provides an additional argument to those who for reasons expressed or not are un- willing to take expansionary meas- ures. A highly tentative guess of the cost of the quagmire of the fifties where growth was sacrificed to the dubious illusi()n of the sound dollar, (that is, balance ot payments eqUI- librium) is that, now, each year we enjoy 15 billion dollars less outpuU than we could have produced. Far better, it seems to me, to permit a looser budgetary policy, and contin11e with a fairly stringent monetary pol- icy, making some small adjustments to placate the people in housing if necessary. Balance of payments stability is not, however, the only policy objec- tive sacrificed. Other possibilities have been given ll.Jl by the Johnson budget policy. If it is true that the tax rise \Vill have sufficient negative effects to cause the U. S. economy to fail to achieve a 4% rate of growth, given Effective Program I estimate, using the same assump- tions as betore, that, with the pro- posed tax mcrease, drrect income pay- ments of 4 to 5 billion dollars or more could have been made. Four and one-half ntiHion famllles coutd have received income supplements of $1,000 each. Such a program might weLl be the most effective anti-poverty program of all. Indeed, on Monday, January 23, the President announced his new Social Security program. The proposal stip- ulates that a new, higher schedule of benefits be placed into effect on July 1, 1967, and a year later, a higher schedule of Social Security taxes_ These moves will not, of course, fig- ure in his administrative budget. If the Social Security program is passed in this form, then a bit more than 4: billion dollars will . be injected int() the inc()me stream in the next fiscaL year. Only if the President;s Social Security program is integrated into his budget policy, does the Presi- dent's economic policy begin to make sense. 'l'o the extent that the administra- tion fails to make clear the need to propose and evaluate economic policy as interdependent instruments and goals, the national economic periorm- ance will be once again inefficient. President Johnson would render the country a great service if he would pursue the educational process his predecessor began, and continue to eliminate the myths which have gov· erned national economic policy too often in the past. On the question of finding good teachers, Professor Graves suggested that the coll~:;e make known its desire to recruit men who ar,· stim- ulating lecturers and who are mo~t intc''-\~ed in undergraduate teaching as a vocation. This idea , is already in effect in the History Department, which has been advertising in ~om<: prvfJssional journals, but it does not seem to hav<: b~<.:11 quite so popular in other departments. Of cour~e Union cannot expect to lure and maintain I)U:..tanding mc11 umess attractive salaries are offt:r<:tl. Dr. Graves feels that Union is more concert:<'d with tangible assets, such as buildings, even in its long range planning, than it is with spE'ndi~l; money to keep demonstrably good faculty mcmiH'l\S. Endowed Cho7rs An idea that Professor Graves suggested in this area is the endowment of teaching chairs; ~ such an arrangement would somewhat alleviate the problem of pay. Good Teachers Defined The central question in a discussion such as this must necessarily be \What do we mean by a good teacher?\ Of course, students will vary as to their estimation of such a teacher, but a selection of men shou:d be present such that enough diversity is available to allow any stu- dent to find faculty he considers exciting. Professor Graves sees college students as t. i falling into four general classifications; these different types will see a different kind of edud- tional experience as satisfying and thus; the fac- ulty should reflect, as rruch as possible, these four educational styles. The first type of person is one who is seeking a highly orgarriled, clearly defined set of standards necessary for his de- gree. This student is a relatively passive type who absorbs what the instructor offers and is quite happy to give the same information back. Other Breeds , A second type of student is one who enjoys .;: active discussion, who seeks a co-equal status with the professor and wh:> feels that pupils and faculty can wqrk together closely on any issues which are mt)aningful. This type of student leams by verbalization and is a more active sort of in- ~·' dividual than the first. In contrast, we have a third type of student who learns by doing, and who prefers to do work \l in the laboratory rather than in the classroom setting. This type of individual is also an active learner and seeks faculty help whenever needed. •• Finally, we have the fourth .clas~ification where students want merely a basi~ ,i,ntroduc- tion to a field, and who wi~h to be f:ree;in their education after getting a feel for the :area. He \' shows most of his interest in his own direc- tion and w.ishes to have a professor who can help him vvhen he needs sources, rather than attending his lectures. This is the second of a three-part series. 135 ERIE BOULEVARD LUIGI'S RESTAURANT let the lager freelr fi<>W'.

Comprehensive Exams Limit Student Freedom; Effects Are Detrimental~ By PAUL GRAYSON The Major Field Examination :serves several worthwhile purposes. According to the Union College Academic Register it is \a test of the student's ability to handle the material from many courses within his field of study. It is an opportul!it~ ~or him to demonstrate his grasp of the dtsmplme .... \ Not on-ly do the compre- hensives pl'Ovide an opportunity for the student show his stuff, but they insure .that he learns it more satisfactorily in the first place. In order to prepare himself for the series of tests he is forced to approach his courses as parts to an over- aU picture; he cannot cram material once only to 'cast it aside as soon as possible . And in addition to promoting a broader, . and healthier, perspective on the part of stu- . dents, the Major Field Examination benefits the department which gives it and the college as a whole. The examination acts as a deterrent to anyone looking for an easy major to get him ·through college, and, for those students who are willing to ma~or in a field which has exams, the preparation that must be put in before taking it no doubt helps him fare .better in graduate school, thus enhancing the prestige of the under- graduate program here at Union. Mixed Blessing ' But for the students, at least, the Major Field Examination has proved a mixed blessing. The pressure it imposes has serious consequences, serious enough perhaps to warrant its abolition. The poorer student, afraid of failing the compre- hensive, and the good student, afraid of not doing as well on them as his peers, both are too fre- quently frightened into taking schedules top- heavy in their majors. One student this year has planned nine courses in his major for fear that fitting in any electives will jeopardize his chances of passing the comprehensives. Nor is it only electives which tend to be ruled out. Even in 1 one's chosen field of study certain courses are found to be more geared to the comprehensives than others. Courses in creative writing or Rus- sian novelists are of little value for the Major Field Ex:amination in English, which stresses facts about the literature of Great Britain. The argument is false that this de facto im- pairment of student freedom is a good thing. Al· ·thout;:h it could be maintained that the compre- henslves are designed to prevent only dilettant- ism, that asking a student to meet minimal de- partmental requirements in his choice of major is not too much, in fact they are harmful for all but those people, a minority among liberal arts students, who know from the beginnifig· that there is one field of knowledge for them. For the boy who comes to college with the intention : of becoming a history teacher, then, it is prob- ably of benefit to have a senior examination act· ing as a guideline for the best undergraduate preparation. Vocation But for the boy who has no future vocation definitely in mind, who views college not as train- ing for his career but as an opportunity for an education, who sees his major not as an end in itself but as a springboard from which he can schedule the most desirable combination of courses, the infringement on his choice of selec· tion is most unfortunate. Knowing that he is to be tested in but one area of knowledge, his choice of courses is in· . evitabl:y affected. He may attain a measure of depth in one field which he would not have de- rived otherwise in his years at college, . but he loses in the process that which is fundamental to a liberal arts education, a fullerJ richer frame of reference which comes only arter having been exposed to any disciplines. By being forced to specialize too soon, much that he might have contributed once he ultimately decided to con- centrate on one area will have been lost. In the old educational debate of depth vs. breadth the one certainty is that inditriduals differ in the ex• tent to which they can profit from a broad educa- tion. What a pity it is that the Major Field Ex· amination enforces a limited scope for all. Student Nite at Willard As the sign indicates, fhe Bookstore By STEVE FOX The Union College Bookstore, the only organization on campus without any stud-ent mem- bership, has, at one time ·or another, been criti- cized by a large number of students. Tile com- ments run from dissatisfaction with the selection of only one brand of mouthwash to the prudish choice of posters. The serious complaints can be reduced to two major items: the n11mber of paperback titles available, and the slowness of book deliveries of both textbooks and popular paperbacks. Students buying books for courses ltave often found that one or two titles on their list have sold out. The deficiency can be justified since in many but not all courses there are last-minute transfers and schedule changes which will cause many extra students in the class who will also want books. The student's discontfitme is increased when the guaranteed :mtmJTum delivery time of two weeks stretches into three weeks or a month. The delay in securing the book is especially distressing if the rest of the class has finished it when the order finally ar- rives. Pressure While the pressure for obtaining non-re- quired paperback titles is not as great, the intel- lectual student can find partial ex:pla!lation for his long wait by merely looking at the layout of the bookstore which devotes a bit less than its floorspace to books and desk supplies. The rest of the store features toilet articles, beer mugs, glassware, jewelry and candy. It is obvious that the bookstore cot1ld stock CAMPUS- CALENDA ij .

In addition, his cu:riosity may be stimulated by a title or cover waic.h arouses some latent or mani- fest interest. Tl:le selection of books available at the time may tri_gger further criticism from him. Head The bookstore,. in the words of head clerk Mrs. Hilda Hill, is \for the students\ and in that respect attempts to serve the needs of twelve hundred students and their faculty. Minor at- tention is given to alumni and their families and occasional outsiders, whose interests are sub- ordinate to the pr-ime buyers. Ordering X num- bers of books f()r each student every trimester becomes a game ()f obtaining enough titles. The problem is complicated because arrangements must be made wit:h each publisher in a separate agreement - there is no central warehouse near- er than New York City and shipments must come from each house. The Faculty Advisory Com- mittee on the Library and the Bookstore under Professor Nieme,yer is attempting to find a way to speed the service. Paperbacks are difficult to sell because the store is not assUJ!ed of a market for any particu- lar title. Since a:ny selection for such a large group is arbitrary. the paperbacks have to be of general interest. The intellectual student who complains that there is too much toothpaste and not enough boo:ks must realize that he is in a minority.

The presence of these 'books is appreciated by no one €Xcept for the class members. The bookstore is caught in the dilemma of ordering enough of each unretumable title for everyone in the class or gambling that the demand will not be that great and suffering the consequences when it is. The majority of the customers is best satisfied by the b0okstore through the op- portunity to huy merchandise at a convenient point on campus. Proponents .of the plan to rnove almost everything out of the store but books ,ignore the fact that the students wiH buy things like toilet articles on campus even if they can be purchased more cheaply at a regular store. Even the jewelry is popular. Despite the popular belief, Dean Lockwood says, \The people who buy this high quality junk are students.\ Philosophy The b0okstore cannot be c0ndemned on the :business level but its philosophy can be ques- tioned. At this time it is a self-supporting busi- ness enterprise which pays for the stall rent, and overhead, as well as the capital for book orders. The college administration does not wish to support it with general funds that could be 11.sed for other things. Several students have wondered if the college should aid the scho'lastic environment by stocking the store with books at a loss. The college has this policy at convocations where it invites cultural leaders at its own ex- pense rather than popular artists, for instance, whom the student might pay to see. Even if the pro1t motive cannot be removed, cer- tain articles can be removed from the bookstore The Union Booksiore offers a wide selection of stuffed cnimcls. which are wanted only at certain times such as the textbooks, which are needed usually only at trimester changes, and the Union seal trinkets, which sell around party and alumni weekends and Christmas. These things could be removed to a storage room in Bailey Hall which will have S()me room at the shift in departments. More hooks can be stored here for eventual rotation in the bookstore, raising the total number of titles greatly, since books in storage do not take up as much as the same number on display would. The stuffed animals and the cookbooks, now on sale, can be stored when the demand is not so great, if it has ever 'been. Willing The bookstore is willing to ex.pand and will if it has the opportunity. Each year the number of titles increases but not significantly enough to be readily noticeable. The college has plans to include a bookstore in the proposed student center. Since the bookstore will be in a custom- made location, it will be able to J;eflect the wants of everyone with Listerine and Joyce for an.

In Collision • • • Union College is now travelling through a time o~ fe~­ ment and coNsolidation. The past year has seen the mstl- tuition of many significant departures from the modes of behavior which have characterized Union for years. The coming year will be a time to try to refine these new pro- grams and expand the front of progressive initiative. Concordy is sanguine about the chances for a success- ful transition. We have often been criticized by members of the col- lege community for being \snarling\ and negative. Cer- tainly this column has focused on the areas of the college which' ten.d to be weakest. But the purpose of all prescrip- tive writing is to achieve change: that which is already good we hope will not be altered and is not, therefore, nor- mal subject matter for editorials. The n10st important changes of the past year have been academic: the institution of the new academic calen- dar and the overhaul of the curriculum. The former seems to be an unmixed stride forward. A calendar is nothing more than a vehicle to achieve a purpose. The 3-3 seems to make education a much richer, satisfying and reward- ing experience than it was under the old semester system. More important, and more complex, has been the in- stitution of Comprehensive Education. Although still too soon to make any sort of definitive analysis, it appears that the principle has been vi_ndicated. ~evertheless,. it needs considerably more work m peprfectmg the d,etails of the courses themselves, which appear to be generally lacking in academic vigor. Less important, if more noticeable, has been the build- ing program. The $7 million worth of buildings now near- ing completion make a significant addition to the college's resources, and they can aid in the fulfillment of its pedagogic goals. Similarly, the kick-off of the fund-raising program bodes well for Union's future. It will enable the college to embark on many programs that have been financially impossible before. Especially encouraging has been the emphasis the administration has placed on raising faculty salaries and scholarship funds. It is on these foundations that the institution must build, and their importance can- not be overrated. The most important change concerning student life has been the revision of social rules. We believe the changes are all to the good. But they do not go far enough in allowing individual conscience full responsibility for de- cisions concerning essentially private actions. We again emphasize that no government can step into this sphere of private morality without grave dangers, and we again call upon the college to renounce its improper control of this area. Related to this has been the continued college insist- ence on forcing people to live on campus. Although there seems little likelihood that the college will reverse its de- cision next fall, we hope it will do so before it embarks on building the next set of unnecessary dormitories. In general, then, it has been a successful year, filled with many instances of the improvement which can be accomplished in a short time. If there is any lesson to be learned, it is this: an institution can change if it has the will. Progress is impossible only when people think it is. 'l'he greatest drawback is. those who say \it cannot be done.\ But it can, if there is a will. Congratulations Concordiensis extends its warmest congratulations on the announcement of Dean Lockwood's appointment to the Presidertcy of Trinity College .. During the relatively brief period he has been at Union., he has proven himself to be both an efficient administrator and 'a warm human being. As such, we forsee a distinguished future at Trinity. Thursday, January 26, 1967 Letters To The Editor U •. I.C. Answers To the Editor: Many of the suggestions that you made in last week's editor- ial are now in effect. The elect- ed representatives of the sev- eral living units who constitute the Union Inter,Residence Coun- cil, or the dormitory council as you call it, have many of the prerogatives 0f a fraternity president. Also, each section may have as many as three late parties (until3 a.m.) each term. The U. I. C. will ve:ty soon be making its presence felt on the· college-wide social front. The U. I. C. is still in its in- . fancy and in that respect it has yet to be as active as will event- ually be the case. As the Coun- cil matures and its efficacy in- creases, the lot of the mdepend- ent .and the freshman will im- prove significantly.

Thurber '68 Council Survey T., 1'he Editor: Union College is, or can be, a dynamic campus, The' question of academic dymamism is pri- marily decided by the facu.ty and administration, whlle stv- dents can have an iluvortam voice in deCiding social, .:lte'. lectttal, extra-curricular ami ath- letic dymamism. In each of these areas of student invoive- ment the Student Council can make a significant contribution by discarding those things no ·ouality longer needed, by updating other things . and by creating new things. This is not to say that other groups do not have anything to do with creating campus dymamism, but the Student Council still remains the official voice of the student bedy, The question is what things should be qiscarded, modified or created? The Student 'Coun- cil has undertaken to make a campus wide survey to answer !his question. When the survey IS compieted representative bodies should have a better idea of what policies a.l'e favored by students, In addition student opinion on pertinent national and interna- tional problems would be tab- ulated. Presently, a student council committee is hard at work ·de- fining categories and q)lestions for the survey, The committee would welcome participation from interested students and faculty, especially those with a background in sociology or psychology. Anyone interested should con- \~ tact either Grady Aronstamm at 346-9973 or Alan Ziegler at 377-3691. Remember, this sur- vey may help to make your years at Union more enjoyable and meaningful so any help that you can give would be to your advantage.

In view of this event, I would like to write about some of the interesting and unusual records that have occurred during the league's history, The lowest scoring game in NBA history occurred on Nov. 22, 1950 at Minneapolis. The Fort Wayne Pistons defeated the Minneapolis Lakers, 19-18. George Mikan, the Lakers' star, scored the game high total of fifteen points. On February 27, 1959, in Boston, the Celtics scored 173 points against Min- neapolis to set an all time high winning score. The widest mar- gin between teams was 62 points, when Syracuse beat New York 162-100 in December, 1960. San Francisco posted a seventeen game losing streak in the 1964-Ul65 season while set- ting the record for most games lost in a season-63. The Celtics have won the most games in a season with 62, though the 76'ers appear a cinch to break ------ -------- that mark this year. The greatest foul shooter was Bill Sharman of the Celtics who maintained a lifetime percent- age of .B83 and a season mark of .932 in '58-'59. The man who owns almost every major record but has never won the NBA title is Wilt Chamberlain. Wilt has the most points in a game (100), the most points in a season ( 4.029), the highest average in a season (50.4), the most rebounds in a season (2149), the most re- bounds in a game (55), the most field goals made in one game (36), the most free throws made in one game (28), and the all time lifetime scoring record of (21,486 points.) ----- THE SPREAD-EAGLE OF TECHNOLOGY AT GRUMMAN Ranges from inner to outer space Grumman has special interest for the graduating engineer and scientist seeking the widest spread of technology for his skills.

BROOK FARM Page 4 Concordy Sports BOOKSTORE Page 5 Hoopsters' Win Streak Ends; Face Five Tough Foes Next Swimmers Drown Hobart; :By GARY PREVOST but Ron Giancola was the only other player to hit double figures, scoring 10. Greg Olson and Fitz Turner were limited to five and two points re- spectively. Olson took only five shots all night while Turner led the errors barrage with seven. Neil Wilensky, with 17 of his 18 points in the second half was high for the Colonials. Break Four Pool Marks The Garnet cagers, venturing away from home for the first time this term, had their four-game win st1:1eak broken in a 57-52 loss to Harpur College in Bingham- ton Friday. The poorly played game left the Garnet with a 5-4 record, the result G>f five horne C()Urt victories and four road defeats. By MICHAEL KLAYMAN The loss to Harpur will hurt the Garnet drive for a winning season as they are now only ,one game over .500 and must face five consecutive tough opponents, three on the road. This year's team has shown that it can play well but the loss to weak Harpur showed that they still have not developed the \winning habit.\ The \winning habit\ is difficult to define but with the '67 cag- ers it may be achieved by making the good pass at the nght time, because , consistently Friday night, the Evansmen could not get the ball to the open man underneath. Last Saturday, thE Garnet mermen left Hobart with a 58-33 victory in their sec- ond meet ef tl'.e season, evening up their record at 1-1. Union placed first in every event of the meet except the 200 yard breaststroke. For Harpur, it was their third victory in a week and lifted their record to 5-4. The varsity cagers are now idle until Feb- ruary 1 when they travel to Williamstown to face a tough Willimns squad. The game ~as not well played on either side, but thirty-one Garnet turnovers against thir- teen by Harpur combined with a nine-point surge by Harpur's Neil Wilensky in the last three mmutes proved to be the difference. The Garnet cagers had a distinct height advantage over the small Colonials, outrebounding the hosts, 51-32, but were unable tu consistently move the ball inside. In attempting to move the ball to tile basket, the Garnet hoopsters were charged with numerous offensive fouls and walking viola- tions. Poor passing near the basket many times eliminated sure hoops. The Harpur cagers played a tight defensive game, and in spite of close guarding, were charged with only eight defensive fouls during the night. Williams Strong The hoopsters' next opponent, Williams, wiU probably be the strongest team that the Garnet face this year. Coach Evans said a victory over Williams would be the highlight of any season. Last year the Ephmen beat Union 76-49, and the Garnet haven't won the annual encounter since 1957. William:: finished the first part of its sea- son with five consecutive victories after a pair of early season losses. During the streak they have defeated Siena, Bates, Bowdoin, Middlebury, and Wesleyan. The losses came against Dart- mouth and American International, both larger schools. The Ephmen are a high scoring team, averaging 92 points a game and boasting a single game school record of 116 points against Bow- doin. Employing a zone press the Garnet opened up an early 8-1 lead, but Harpur .solved the press and began to play slowdown; with the help of numerous Garnet mistakes, they battled to tie tile score at the end of the first period. The lead see-sawed for the rest of the period with Union taking a 25-23 lead to the dressing room. The poor caliber of play in the first half could be seen in the shooting percentages as the Garnet shot 10 for 29 against 8 for 30 by Harpur. Williams' leading scorer is 6-4 junior for- ward, Bill Drummond, who is also second lead- ing rebounder. Bill Untrecker a 6'7\ junior center is the leading rebounder and second lead- ing scorer. Jay Healey, a 6-2 junior forward is a strong jumper and third leading scorer. The starting guards are seniors Irv Blond, captain, and Ted McPherson, 6-2. All of the starting five is averaging in double figures. One factor to the Garnet's advantage is that the Ephmen will enter the game after an 18-day layoff. Otherwise pros- pects for victory are fairly bleak. Diver Harvey Riehm ond performs an inward gainer with Garnet mermen in tlieir loss !'o Williams. The Dutch men eve;,erl their recor.d next week with a 58-33 against Hobart. Gcrrnet Scores Quick The Garnet scored two quick hoops to open tile second half and appeared to be on the track, but at this point Harpur's Larry Gainen and Neil Wilensky began hitting from the outside and fc)l'ced the Dutchmen into a man-to-man defense. The Garnet played a good man-to-man, but the Colonials simply shot too well in the second half, hitting on 14 of 26 shots (54</c) while the Garnet never started hitting, making only 11 of 28. Harpur had built a 44-39 lead with 6:35 left when key hoops by Tom Urbeli~ and greg Olson coupled with three consecutive missed :free throws by the opposition brought the Garnet back to 46-46 with 4:36 left. Then after the Garnet slipped behind again, Bill Priscott's three point play with 2: 19 left tied the scor:e for the last tim~. Twenty-five seconds later Wilensky began his point spree with a twenty-footer from the corner and the Dutchmen in attempting to move in close for a hoop committed three costly fouls in the last ninety seconds. Giancola's three point play. with fourteen seconds left cut the Harpur margm to three, but Goodrich broke away for an easy hoop against the Union press to ice the game. Tom Urbelis led the Garnet scoring with 16, Freshmen Score Second Victory The Garnet frosh won their second consecu- tive game Friday, a 79-58 win over the Harpur junior varsity. Harpur with its two finest fresh- men on the varsity team were undermanned field- ing a nine-man squad. Coach Schmid substituted freely throughout the game, preventing a slaugh- ter. The frosh cagers led by as much as 11 in the first half but strong Harpur shooting late in the period cut the margin, and the Garnet held a 37-:n lead at intermission. Harpur cut the lead to four early in the second half, but a 23-5 spread in the next eight minutes led by Pete Garrison and Roger Harrison put the game out of reach. The frosh subs played out the last ten minutes of the game as they coasted to victory. Pete Garrison scored 26 in a fine all-around effort, hitting ten field goals and six for six from the foul line while Roger Harrison had 14. The Garnet frosh will host Albany College of Pharmacy at the Field House on Friday night at 8:(]0 before playing road contests at Sil;:na and Williams next Tuesday and. Wednesday mghts. In order not to tire the team, Coach Benson officially entered only one man in each event of the last series, but the Gamet still managed to triumph by a 25 point margin. Barandes Double Winner Harvey Richmond and Scott Muirhead took first and second places, respectively, in the div- ing competition. Setting StattJsmen pool records for the Garnet were: Dick .Amesbury for the 200 yard freestyle, 2:00.5; Torn Flynn for the 500 yard freestyle, unofficial time 5;38.6; Dick Cor- rigan for the 200 yard individual medley, 2:14.6; John Crawford for the 200 yard butterfly, 2:29. Sophomore Bob Barandes was the only double winner for the day taking both the 50 and 100 yard freestyle, with times of 0:23J:J and 0:54.1.
