Ghana The Proper Proportion At a special meeting of the Interfraternity Council last week, a rather complicated system was adopted for the formal rushing period which will be held during the first week of the coming semester. As it is now conceived, the system puts the brtmt of carrying out this period on the fraternity men as opposed to putting it on the new students being rushed. We believe that a more satisfac- tory system would reverse this emphasis and plactl' the initiative squarely on the shoulder of the freshmen where it rightfully belongs. A program of this nature would considerably lessen the ten!!!ion placed on those involved during this time period. No longer would a freshman be subjected to sev- enteen different groups running in and out of his room consistently every night for a full week. Nor would the fraternity men have to waste their time visiting men who have absolutely no desire to join their fraternity. With the deferred rushing system in effect, both fraternity nien and freshmen should have gotten a basic knowledge of the men and houses they would like to rush. Consequently, an intensive formal rush as we have had in the past is un- necessary. A system in which freshmen could visit the houses at specified times during the formal period ought to be enough to give both sides an adequate foundation on which to choose. In addition to this advantage, academically the new '-. program would allow much more time for both upper- classmen and freshmen to study. With rushing during the first week of !he spring semester, it is important that at ,the same time men are selecting a house and pledges, they be able to establish a firm academic footing. Under the new program more study time would be available. A system in which freshmen rush fraternities has already been successffully innovated at many small col- leges academically comparable to Union. We will investi- gate the specific programs in effect at these colleges and attempt to determine whether they are practically appli- cable to our campus. These proposals will appear in this column early next semester. Small College Tradition? , WHo SHIRL Rei~ ? lecture is being delivered. In English, although two reci- tation periods are allotted, the sections themselves a·re too large to really be effective. Within the ne'lct few weeks the Concordiensis will sur- vey the students enro:lled in these courses to obtain a complete evaluation of the system. The results of this survey wilt appear in these columns in the near future. Q;verseas Circulation In the past few years, we have attempted to bring the Union College student closer to pmblems existing in the nation and the globe. Consistent with this policy, we .have encouraged student analysis of trouble spots in the world by interpreting events as they develop. We believe that this does 'much to contribute to the education offered by the college. Every year, the Concordiensis sets one issue aside as its international edition. Today's Concordy will be dis- tributed in many of the international capitals as well as in many of the more important cities in the United States. We hope it will contribute to improving relations with our foreign neighbors. 1962: As I See It By Ed That popular pastime that per- vades the minds of post- partying participants, particularly those partial people prankishly preoc- cupied with problems of the pop- ulation, is prognostication.

By PetN Lel'court A mad automobile raee between BrightoN and London is the sub- ject of Genevieve, a fine British comedy cunently playing at the Scotia Art Theatre. Genevie,e, a J. Arthur Rank production, has been delighting audience~ for a decade with its Blapstick IH:tion and hilarious excitement. The star of the film is Gene- vieve, pla~·ed by herself, that i:>, a fine old 19t).l Derrick which he- comes a bone of contention be- tween husband and wife and eventually wind~ ' up bi'Oken down but victorious, fenderles with only three tires on the Waterloo Bridge. The annual outing of ant1que automobiles held by the Veteran Car Club leads to an exasperating chain of events-accusations of marital in- fidelty, tL'mper fit,; and an im- passioned wager that nearly makes enemies out o!' uld t't·iend,... Allan (John Gregson) and Am- brose (Kenneth l\lore) ~tup at nothing to prevent Lach other from winning the wager, and things get p1·etty hot under the collar now und then. Sonw of their little pranks prove the old saying that \boys will be boys,\ but things end up amirahly enough for all involved.

(UPS)- Thl' Administrative Council of the C1ty Cnin•J·sity of N e\\' York has l'l'pealed its speakl•rs ban again,;t Communist Party members. The Council ruled that the de- eision to allow or di~:~-allow speak- er invitations to party members will be left to the individual col- leges. In effect, this is the same rule that existed before the ban was imposed on October 28, 19Gl. The Council's decision was based on a report on the legal issue in- \'olved by thP Committee on the Bit! of Rights of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. The report's final para- paragraph stated, \Accordingly it is out· considered opinion that a farulty ot· administration of the t 'ity Cniversity is legally entitled to permit known l:nited StatPs ( ·,mmunist l'artv mPmhers ot· of- l1··•·t·\ til ~pl·ak on their eampuses.\ Lt>gal Advice Reyersed At till' t imP thl' bun was fit·st !JII(!»wd, tlw Council emphasized that it had bast>d it,; decision \up- lll! tlw bP~t and most competent leg· a! <llh ict• tl1l' rounril eould ob- tain.\ Tlw ( ~ouncil preceded its for- mal agreement with the Bar com- Jllitte\'·~ finding with the asser·- tion, \ThP faet sePms to be that t•xeellent legal ad\'ice can be in t•onflict on this issue.\ The Council concluded in its re- pmt that \until there is fut1:hPr judidal or legislative determina- tion of this question, the educa- tional authorities on each campus are legally free to approve or dis- approve invitations to members of the Communist party of the l'nited :::ltates a:< the:-· were here- tofore.\ Tht> lawyt•rs' committee, anal~·­ zing impot·tant C.

I needed for transit through the Soviet Sector. Before leaving the check point, the West German border patrol inspected the pass- ports of everyone on the train.

I turned around and saw the intruder was a blue- black uniformed Transportation Policeman.
