But in Ourselves.'' \He is more often pitiful than t:r!lgic ... He is pushed by forces beyond his comprehension, pulled into movements which he does not understand; he gets into situations in which he is in the most helpless position.\ \He is the hero as victim, the small creature who is, acted upon but who does not act, who works along unno- ticed in some body's office or store, never talking loud, never talking back, never taking a stand.\ Thus does famed Sociologist C. Wright Mills categorize a certain segment of American society. Mills' eloquent description applies equally well to the typical Union under- graduate of 1961. For the discouraging fact is that Union College students, by their own apathy and indifference, have forfeited a great deal of their prerogative to govern themselves and to make their share of college decisions. The Alumni Interfraternity Council and the 'various control and discipline agencies presided over by Dean Pol- lock are guilty of shocking and confiscatory seisures of student governmental prerogative, to be sure, but the final responsibility rests solely and totally with the student body. Despite the importance which a competent and fore- sighted Board of Trustees, a faculty of the highest calibre, a high endowment, a \balanced curriculum\ and a multi- million dollar plant contribute to the stature of Union College, the ultimate responsiblity for the future of Union rests with the undergraduate. When the students of Uhion wake up, when they take an. interest in the events which are shaping their college and their world, then, and only then will the name of Un- ion be as respected as that of Williams. When the stu- dents of Union break down their wall of ivory-tower indif- ference, perhaps then Uhion will cease to become a place to which one comes only after he is rejected for admis- sion to Amherst. It is an indesputable fact of political history that citi- zens, whether they be citizens of a college campus or of a political constituency, invariably get the government which they deserve. For a start, students might well ponder the words, slightly shaded, of President Kennedy in his call for new \vigah \Ask not what your college can do for you, but what you can do for your college.\ Sands of Time Two years ago the faculty voted to shorten the aca- demic calendar by shortening the final examination period from two weeks to one week at the end of each semester. Reducing the exam period did not, however, decrease the subject matter for review but did decrease the time avail- able for studying. Many Uhion students have found the time alloted between the end of classes and the beginning of examinations inadequate for them to demonstrate their maximum abilities during exam week. There are two possible solutions of this problem if the exam period is to remain one week and if the all men's index is to either remain constant or increase rather than continue on a steady downgrade. First is a solution which is presently in practice at several well known universities, a reading period. Harvard University's reading period, be- tween classes and exams, last approximately two weeks. Rather than being strictly a cram session, the two weeks are devoted to finishing assignments on which the stu- dents will then be examined as well as providing an oppor- tunity for a concerted review. Brown University's reading period, about five days, can be devoted purely to exam preparation. Either of these systems appears applicable to Union but would necessitate a change in the college calen- dar.

A change in the college ,calendar establishing a read- ing period or a regulation prohibiting hour exams during the last week of each semester can be enacted by the Faculty Council. However, before the Council will act the students must demonstrate a sincere desire to alter the present ::~ystem. Such a demonstration, if it is to be effec• tive, must take the form of a resolution by the Student Council which would then be presented to the Faculty Council for consideration. Easy Terms Union College students who may still be brooding over last week's tuition payments can take some consolation in the fact that tuition rates are raising all over the globe. Faced with the increased costs of providing a good edu- cation, private colleges have been forced to ra~e tuition rates, and evidence indicates that the hikes will continue in years to come. At the same time tuition was being paid on Union's campus, for example, The Mita Campus, student news paper of Keio University, in Tokyo, Japan, headlined \Tui- tion Fee to be Hiked Students Object Hard.\ The Campus reported that tuition was being raised f:rom 30,000 yen to 40,000 yen. The following classified advertisement, published last week in in the Wall Street Journal, daily newspaper of fi- nance and commerce, may furnish an answer to the finan- cial problems of people in various walks of campus life.

Pollen Pill Boon To Would-he locks A small pill, imported from Sweden, may be the solution of .nuny problems of athletic coaches .n kepmg football players on the .ield, basketball players on the loor and baseball players on the Jiamond. These pills, called Pollitabs, are imported into the United States by Louis J. Pappas, a Maitland (Fla.) drugstore owner. Pollen is a primary food from which all things grow and is a natural vegetable source of vita- min B-12. Trouble has been that collection of pollen by bees was · impracticable and by human hands impossible, making the I'Ost more than the ve-ry rich could pay. The Swedes have now come along with a me~hanical method which puts Pollitabs at a price that everyone physically below par can afford.

As the communications needs of our nation become steadily greater and more complex, the Bell Telephone System is continuing its pioneer work in microwave by \taking to the air\ more and more to get the word across. To this end, Western Electric-the manu- facturing arm of the Bell System-has the monumental task of producing a large part of the microwave h·ansmission equipment that knits our country together by shrinking thou- sands of miles into mere seconds. In spite of its great technological strides, the science of radio relay is a rapiclly-changing one. And new break-throughs and advances are common occurrences. A case in point: our Bell System \TH\ Microwave Radio Relay. This newest development in long-distance telephone transmission will eventually tviple the present message-carrying capacity of exist- ing long-haul radio relay installations. A full- scale system of 6 working and 2 protection channels can hunclle 11,000 telephone mes· sages at the same time. To make microwave work takes a host of special equipment and components: relay towers, antennae, waveguides, traveling wave- tubes, transistors, etc. But just as important, it takes top-caliber people to help us broaden our horizons into such exciting new areas as communication by satellites! And microwave is only part of Western Electric's opportunity story. We have~right now-hundreds of challenging and rewarding positions in virtually all areas of telephony, as well as in development and building of defense communications and missile guidance systems for the Government. So, if your future is \up in the air,\ you owe it to your career to see \what's up\ for you at Western Electric. Opportunities exist for electrical, mechanical, indus- trial, civil and chemical engineers, as well as physical science, liberal arts, and business majors.

Vacant Landlot·ds Questioned During the survey, fifteen stu- dnts from sociology classes at Union questioned landlords Who owned 200 of the 400 existing vacancies in Schenectady. The survey · covered all areas of the city. Among the questions asked were size of rental unit, rent per month, and time of vacancy. In addition to non•Whites, the land'- lords were asked about their re- ceptivity to pets, students, .and non-Christians. In the way the questionnaire was constructed, it is doubtful that those interviewed suspected the real purpose of the survey. · The results of the survey are a trifle amazing. While 53% ex- pressed an objection to children and 55% objected to pets, 65% expressed doubts about renting to Negroes. Mercer emphasized in an interview that even this figure was lower than the actual resist- ance. He said that people will often profess to have no race feel- ings, but hold this opinion only because of' the current pressures for desegregation. These pres- sures .seem to hav affected the responses to the questions,' more than they have actual behavior. Many Claim Indifference Of the people interviewed, 35% said they were indifferent to race. However, one of the comments expressed by subjects in thi111 group w;;ts, \None have come around. Might rent if they were clean.\ The group that preferred not to rent to non-Whites numbered 29%. A typical comment here was \I know the law - can't re- fus~ ·to rent to them. It isn't fair to them to be in an all-White neighborhood. I have friends who are colored people. Very gcod people. It is better to evolve than to tear down nrecedent. I would prefer colored- people with good morals to white people with bad morals.\ . The largest group, 36%, satd they would under' no conditions rent a room to a non-White. They made remarks like, \Don't '\ant any in the neighborhood.\ \They have a class of their own. They live in their own places.\ \Why do you ask me such a goddam question.\ Many other interesting facts were uncovered by the survey. It seems that by their resistance to Negro families, landlords seemed to be hurting themselv.es econom- ically.

One suggests helplessly while the other maintains dynamic silence. Right Under Our Noses Racial discrimination is one of the most obnoxious concepts in. current American life, and Schenectady, where progress is the most important product, is shamefully guilty of contributing to the henious cause of racial in- equity in one of its most distasteful forms. A study, the results of which are published on the front page of this issue, reveals that bidden racial dis- crimination in housing exists right here in the electric city. The Conco.rdlensis has b~en prominent among newspapers, student and professional, which have pledged therrtse~ves to vccally uud decisively condemn racial inequalitY, in all of its forms. The Concordy has reported student sit-ins in the south, the Apartheid policy of South Africa, racial exclusion clauses among Union's fraternities, and hidden discrimination in the north. The Concordy now pledges itself to continue to meth- odically investigate, and strongly oppose, all instances o.f racial discl'imination in the City of Schenectady which come to its attention. Further, we earnestly urge our pro- fessional colleagues, the Schenectady Gazette and the Sche- nectady Un.ion-Star to join us in this quest for social justice. With the shocking revelation that racial discrimina- tion exists in fact here in Schenectady, a;nd the sentencing this week of one oi Schenectady's industrial leaders to a federal jail term, we have become quite disillusioned with the moral climate in the community in which we live and study. We admonish our community neighbors that such a moral climate will add little to Schenectady's efforts to grow and prosper. Dynantic Silence .. Know thyself'' was good advice in Socrates' time and it is good advice now. And one of the best ways to \know thyself\ is to question thyself, ·and it is in this area that we would direct tne attention of the Union student. Here at Union, can we correlate knowledge and com- prehension? Are they synonomous with learning? Is all this beneath the broad generalization of intellectual growth? College should symbolize an association with ideals and ideas not already digested, with personalities having more than one collective race. College should sym- bolize assimiliation into a trembling, overpowering mind thrusting at its students endless challenges to intellect and wit. Has Union discovered this? Exemplary of this atmosphere are the products of the Undergraduate Alumni Fund. Toward this drive, Union students were solicited for contributions. We were told to become accustomed to being asked. '!'his fund is pitifully misdirected. It seeks to give therapy to an illness without prescribing a cure. It touches the patient's pocket, not his heart. No amount of advertising can elicit a true sympa- thetic response to the drive; Students contribute only be- cause they are persistently dogged, cajoled and sweet talked, n.ol because they sincerely desire to do so. Ask any of the fund's representatives for a verification. Ask why neither they, nor anyone, ever expect one hundred percent participation. What Is \Union's Purpose?\ At Union, that spirit just isn't there. How juvenile it is to ask us to vote how our half-dollar should be appro- priated; when every item to be earmarked deserves more than will ever be appropriated to it. We anxiously await a declaration of \Union's Pur- pose.\ Can we expect this declaration to hold more tha:p. vague, verbose truisms? What, exactly, is Union's pur- pose? Is it merely a physical plant of buildings? What It makes little difference whether the decisions were for social rules or campus traffic laws. It makes a great difference when government by decree is no government at all, when law by edict is no law at all. Where is our \corporate image\? How long since we merited mention in the Education section of the .New Yorli Times for any new innovation, any new project? It is be- yond reproach that our best publicity in years was pro- vided by a television quiz program? . These are the issues. Are we the recipients of a col- lege education who must ~·take it or leave it\? Are we to be regarded as faceless, !wmputer-like paying customers who must accept the product we have purcnased? Simply Threats of Reprisal Are we to be saddled with archaic social rules that would make a stoic reel'! Are we to be shackled to a social development program that forces young men and women to mature amidst forty-eight hour weekends of din and confusion? There are no moments of privacy to listen quietly to music or drink or converse in normal surround- ings; simply ttueats of reprisal. Enough of scores of couples in a living room, hal! of them lying prone. For the atmosphere of pnvacy, peace and sanity, we were told by someone in the adrrunistration (guess who?) in a most cavalier fashion, to go to the Van Dyke. Or else to meet our dates at the tram station and put them back on the next express to their homes. All this for the sake of Union's name. \If sexual re- lations must involve Union students, they must go off cam- pus to get it.\ Is it not this typical, bigoted attitude that assumes the worst of the \balanced\ men. Union has so thankfully admitted for matriculation? ' Union's \balanced'' name is inconsistent to the tide oi momentous world wide social and political revolution. In no other country on this earth do students and faculty play sucn a minute role in shaping thougnt and action . .l!ilsew uere, these roles are coveted. here, controversy and creativity act out a supporting performance to an impotent scheduled existance. .h.lsewhere, students are encouraged to create. Elsewhere, students are encouraged to think. They en- counter controversial men, are e2o..--posed: to controversial ideologies, and if theythemselves cnoose, they too may become controversial. Let Us Be First Thirty credits a year do not necessarily foster crea~ tivity aJ?-d introspection. Neither do thirty pounds of books or lab mstruments. They are an outward manifestation ... signifying nothing. '!'he results are the stultifying ef- fect or four years o:t spoon feeding, a lack of desire and a void of stimulation - regimentation. Let us become well-rounded before we become experts. Let us have those Contemporary Civilizations and Human- ities courses gaining momentum elsewhere and let us meet society on her own grounds. Let administrators ad- ministrate, let donors donate, let teachers teach, and for the sake of Union's future, and the future of her sons, let students study. Let us not be the third choice of students applying to Amherst or Williams. Let us be first. Let us examine ourselves. Let us stop staring back- ward as we wallow in volumes of tradition, but start mov-· ing forward to make volumes of history. Howl-Sons of Union \I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness ... \ Allen Ginsberg .... A madness has been found to be rampant in American higher <;Jdi.lcational circles. The taint of specialization has thoroughly blackened the contenance of almost every college. . _01~e c~n not deny that we have entered upon an age of specialization. No man can any longer hope to achieve the Grecian ideal of universal knowledge, This is to be con- ceded. But does this necessarily mean that the 20th cen- tury man must so limit his horizons so as to be familiar with merely one discipline? Emphatically no! Friday, February 10, To advocate a return to the liberal arts education of' a century ago would be retrogressive, but a continua~1ce of the course blocked out by our modern educators would be fatal to society as we know it. Tbe specialized college edu-1 cation lacks ~II vitality outside its limited sp!1ere. Our leaders in the field of higher education seem to have ignored one basic fact. Today's college education, as :rn the ser it exists, is archaic. True specialization only begins on the Tuesday, a cl graduate level.

The Garnet then came to life, :;pear- headed by the driving of Santos and the rebounding of Bob Hol- land. Union gained the advantage at the fifteen minute mark 21-19 on two free throws by Holland and upped the count the 25-~1 on two quick buckets by Santos and Hol- land. The bucket by Santos was one of 16 points by the Ams- terdam eager in his scorching first half. He was held to only six points in the second stanza and wound up witlt Union's high of 22. Holland contributed two field goals and a pair of free throws to the Garnet in the big first half for six of his ten points. The Dutchmen trotted off the floor at the midway break to the ap- plause of a fired-up home cr~wd and a startled Wesleyan f1ve. Shortly befbre th~ buzzer, San- tos, with perfect timing, made a . Bill Russel type block of a W es- leyan opponent's shot that left on- lookers shaking their heads in amazement. Wesleyan Finds Rauge The New Englanders sought to remedy the situatibfi in the sec- ond half, and that they did once they found the range. After a three point play by Santos, the big Ca11dinal guns began to hit as their s·kyscrapers cleared the boards time and time again, caus- ing the Dutchmen to lose the ex- cellent poise 'they displayed m the first ha:lf. Despite the sniping of Ed Tyndall arid the playmaking o~ Ed Gentile and Santos., the handwriting was on the wan as Wesleyan crept closer to the lead. \ . They reeled eight pbjnts to U n- ion's single and tied the count at 39 all.

In the units that had been vacant for six weeks or longer, this percentage dwindled to 24%. Among the group that would never rent to Negroes, it was found that a very large n1;1mber of them had long-term vacancie3. Thus, they were hurting them- selves by being so adamant.

This judgment was echoed by many of the renowned journalists who spoke at the Press confer- ence, and .it is indicative of a new and courageous school of journalism which is rising all over the world to dea:l with the exciting new issues that are currently making For some four months the Union College campus has been suffering under the burden of archaic social rules, and for some four months the student body has shown progressively less inclination to subject themselves to the constant harassment and intercollegiate embarrassment which the new rules are causing. Chiefly responsible for the new rules is the now-in- famous Alumni Interfraternity Council. The Alumni IFC adopted the new rules and thrust them onto the campus totally without regard to the cause and effect relationship which existed on campus, totally without the barest knowl- edge of social rules or their affect on a college campus and with acknowledged total disregard for the feelings and dignity of the individual student. headlines in every type of press media. Henry Luce, cour· ageous head of the TIME-LIFE organization, is the father of the new \interpretive'' school of American journalism. For many years, objectivity was the god under whose name American journalists wrote and edited. Generally speaking, American newspapers were the most eminently successful of the world's news media in achieving objec- tivity, and the chief exponent of this type of reporting be- came, of course, the New York Times of Adolph Ochs.

It has admitted .consistently that it lacks any overall policy y.rhatsoever. Its meetings are poorly attended, and members of the AllfC have professed ignorance of what their body was created for, what it is doing, or what it expects to do. The AH'C has consistently refused admission to stu- dents to attend its conferences, has reacted in the most arbitrary manner possible tl'> questions of students, and has shown complete disregard for the well directed and sincere efforts of the student Interfraternity Council to work with it in any way. The directors of the AIFC have admitted having the barest knowledge of the campus, and have time and again stated that the only basis for their decisions was \arbi- trary.\ They have continuously frustrated the students who have tried to reason with them and have in every way exhibited gross disregard for the consequences of their action. Against this background of intolerance and disinter- est, the student Interfraternity Council, under the able and patient direction of President Kirchgasser and Social Rules Chairman Jim Dickenson has attempted to bargain and negotiate in good faith and every conceivable sincere manner. In view of the dreary picture which the Alumni IFC has given of itself to the campus, an obvious question con- cerns the composition of members of the AIFC. Under- graduates may be somewhat surprised to learn that the With the challenging new issues and problems which confront the pr$sent day world, however, the American free and responsible press has been noticing uneasily for some time that objectivity alone is not the answer to the accurate and fair presentation of the news which is sha:p- ing our complex and troubled world. John Steele, famed chief of the Washington Bureau of TIME-LIFE, maintains that objectivity has often be- come the guise under which the lazy and incompetent re- porter operates. Unable or unwilling to comment or inform, the lethargic newspaper is content merely to publish the \complete text'' of some speech or report, masking their ineptitude and apathy under the revered facade of objec- tivity. It is now evident th~t interperative reporting and com- menting is the only way to delve fairly ~nd responsibly into the great issues of the day. Only by revealing the back- ground and the relevance of the true issues which inevit- ably surround the great stories of our time can the fr€e press fulfill its responsibility to a free ~ociety. The in- formed electorate must know the truth, not merely the full text; it must be cognizant of the bacl:;:ground, not merely the latest press release. The text of a speech or the pre-written press release which are often published under the doubtful justification of objectivity are not enough. They tell little and they fail to inform. The newspapers of Khrushchev or Castro may easily be objective, but a-re they responsible, true, fair and informative? The terms are not always synonymous. What Are You Afraid Of?

Why does a man who is proud of his intelligence and his intellectual curiosity so scornfully snub the sum of the American press except for the Times? For the full and impartial text of some speech, the Times, admittedly, is the best source. But for information, mature judgment, and background; for the full story of the great issues, why not a magazine such as TIME? The man who reads the Times, or any other single publication, despite its individual qualifications, is not an informed man. The Times is like the Congressional Record: it is a laudably accurate and objective record of speeches and votes, but it is a far from complete picture of the events that shaped the world on the day of its publication. Read the Tiines, gents-by all means, but do not be afraid of lowering yourselves to become truly informed by reading an interpretive news magazine, like TIME, in addition. • .. · Spread some light at home by Long Distance.

TI'E F. & M. SCHAEFER BREWING CO .. NEW YORK and ALBANY, N, V, ln1958 when Bill Ebben WllS only ~few months away from his engineering degree at the University of Detroit, he was in touch with 15 prospective employers. He chose the Michigan Bell Telephone Com- pany because: \This company offered the kind of engineering management opportunity I wanted- and' they weren't kidding.\ One of Bill's first assignments was a survey of Michigan Bell's big Central District to find out how long available building space could accom- modate the switching equipment required by rapid telephone growth: \I wasn't given any instruc- tion,\ Bill says, \I was just told to do the job.\ So Bill did it. His report became the gllide for planning and budgeting future construction. On his next move, Bill proved he could handle supervisory responsibility. He was serit to head up a group of seven engineers to design a new long distance switching center for Saginaw, Michigan -a $4,000,000 engineering project. Today, llill is on the staff of Michigan Bell's Program Engineer. He's working on a system for mechanized control of oolephone construction costs. How does Bill feel about his job? \Give a man a tough job and a chance to go somewhere--and he'll break his neck to do it. Of course, I don't think rm going to be running the business next year- but I'm getting every opportunity to hit the top. You don't worry about opportunity here--you worry about whether. you're as big as the job.\ I lfyou're a, man like BiU .Ebben, a man who can size up a job, figure out what needs to be done, and then do it-tl~en you should get in touch .with one of the Bell Companies.
