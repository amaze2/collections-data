This year, how- ever, all who attended the initial session voiced the desire to make the Political Forum an eft'ertive organization for all interested students and a vehicle for the promotion of political discussion on the campus. Officers Elected The club is composed of Young Demo<'rats, Young Republicans and Independents. Each of the party affiliates elect a president and vice presiden:t. Thesfl four offit>ers and the secretary-treas- urer of the Forum comprise the exerutive board of that club. The officers that were elected are: Young Democrats, Robert Stolz- berg, president, and Joe Rosen- thal, vice-president; Young Re- publicans, William Frisbee, presi- dent, and James Upton, vice-pres- ident and secretary-treasurer, John Perra. Program Discused The group discussed the possi- bilities of bringing speakers to the campus and of holding a mock senate on campus if enough in- terest is shown. The Political Forum represents Union College at a mock senate held in Albany each year by many New· York state schools. The next meeting will be on Wednesday, December 16 at 7:30 p.m. in Hale House Student Lounge. AU who wi.sh to attend and to join the club are most welcome. The film examines the descent of a man ir.to the hidden cham- bers of his subconscious and his wandering through its mazes. It was meant more as a history of psy:hoanalysi.s than a biography of Freud since it covers only five years of the scientist's life. Good Photography The film, prized more for its photography and direction, re- receh·erl poor reviews. Although the \New Republic\ said that Douglas Glocombi's photography was \both delicate and dramatic\ and tha·t \Huston directed with seriousness ... most of the film is immediate and graphic,\ Sat- urday Review did not think it among the ten best for 1962 and Newsweek said \Freud came on like a movie about Bach with a music score by Dimitri Tiomkin.\ In general, the reviewers took issue with both Clift as Freud and the maturity of the production. New Republic said that he \Lacks the impact he once had,\ and the production was \too simplified for the educated adult, ambitious as an intellectual drama, it will lose \yahoo\ movie fans and its one real utility is for intelligent !ugh school children.\ The New Yorker said, \Mr. Clift is a bOy- ish Yankee, and would have been more at ease, I suspect, in the role of the patient.\ .Saturday Review simply said, \Clift re- mains rather cold.\ PRICE 15 CENTS Freshn1en Grades Shovv l01provetnent Marks Better Than Class of '67 Calvin C. Schmidt, Registrar of the college, has re- leased the Ad-Interin Scholarship Report on the Class of 1968. Although a composite index is not computed at ad- interim, the report indicates an improvement in academic performance over last year's freshman class. Lindsay Cancels Speech The scheduled speech of Con- gressman John V. Lindsay has been canceled. Lindsay, who was to appear in Memorial Chapel this Wednesday, announced the change yesterday in a letter to James Upton, a Campus Republican leader. Won Large Majority Lindsay rep1·esents Manhattan's seventeenth Congressional dis- trict, often referred to as the \Silk Stocking\ district or the \Golden Rectangle.\ He won his first term in Congress in 1958 and has been re-elected consistently since then. In the recent elections, he received three times as many votes as his Democratic-Liberal opponent. Received Law Degree Lindsay, 43, graduated from Yale in 1943. After sel'Ving three years in the Navy, he returned to ·scllool to receive his law degree in 1948. It was while in law school that Lindsay first became interested in politics, meeting at that time Herbert Brownell, Jr. Sponsored by WAC Congressman Lindsay is still scheduled to speak in Albany on Wednesday night. His speech there is being sponsored by the World Affairs Council. Part of the text of the letter, an apology to Mr. Upton announcing his in- ability to speak here follows: \Thank you so much for your letter of November 23rd, and I can't tell you how sorry I am that I will now be unable to be with you on December 9th. I had jump- ed the gun in accepting your in- vitation before I had checked my schedule and also the airline and train schedules. I now find that I am unable to make any reason- able communication because of my schedule in New York the morn- ing of the 9th.\ Of the three hundretl forty-two members of the Class of 1968, forty-one attained Dean's List av- erages of 3.0 or better, or 11.98 per cen't of the class, as compared with tv.·enty-five members, or 7.48 per cent of the Class of 1967 at the same time last year. This represents an improvement of 4.5 per cent. Of this year's fresh- men, ninety-one per cent attain- ed the minimum index required to remain in good standing; only thirty-one freshmen, 9.06 per cent of the class, did not attain mini- mum indeces as compared with thirty-six, or 10.77 per cent of the membe1·s of last year's class. Previous Class Lower On an individual course basis the Class of 1968 placed 5 per cent better than last year's fresh- men. Only fifty-six freshmen fail- ed one course whereas sixty-two, or nearly 20 per cent of last year's class had one course in which they failed to attain pass- ing grades. Twelve freshmen failed two courses this year as compared to fifteen last year. Only t\'\'O freshmen failed three courses this year whereas nine failed three courses last year. No freshman failed four courses this year and one failed five while two students failed four causes last year. Failures Decrease Overall, seventy-one freshmen failed one or more courses this yt>ar as compared wi•th eighty-six last year. These figures represent ahout t1venty and twenty-five per cent of the respective classes. Schmidt emphasized, however, the temporary nature of the.se grades. He pointed out that the ad-interim marks are not offi- cially recorded; they are intend- to be a general indication of how well the freshmen are performing. The report sems to indicate that the rlass shows a moderate im- prm·ement over last years' class. Several profesors have indicated their satisfaction with the pres- ent class as one which has be- come quickly accustomed to col- leg-e requirements .

Although Zurich docs not have the overpowering grandeur and the late nineteenth century tone of Vienna, the VictoTian period has had a large influence on both buildings and customs.

In Switzerland alone, four lan- guages are spoken officially, not to mention the ones people get away with behind the dialectitians' backs. Actually two versions of Ger- man are spoken. One is ealled Swiss high German and is prarticed in 'schools. The more grass-roots version, spoken by most Swiss among themselves, frequently sounds Iike a senile cow clearing hm· throat. Now if you have never hea1•d a senile cow clearing her throat, suffice it to say that this version is a hard-to-understand, unsystem- atic corruption of regular German. The National Pastime Switzerland's military situation provides puzzling paradoxes. The Swiss have not fought a war since they became united over a century ag0. Still they have one of the largest army-population ratios in the world. When I disembarked at the Zurich railroad station in late summer I thought war clouds were gathering. Literally hun- dreds o.f soldiers were walking to and fro with packs, steel helmets, rifles, sub-machine guns and foot-long bayonets (carried with both field and dress uniforms). One may well suggest that this strength has been the deciding factor that has made it possible for Switzerland to stay out of war, but this simply is not the case. It was her threat to blow up her tunnels and roads if invaded that made her more valua-ble to Hitler free than subjugated and kept him from invading, not the fear of her anny. I had always associated Switzerland with peaceful institutions, e.g., the Red Cross, Geneva Peace Talks, and Swiss Choeolate. The existence of mass military maneuvers which included University students a:s well as junior executives (some students even missed the first six weeks of school) came to me as quite a shock. The main reason :for the survival of this military preoccupation is tradition. William Tell is to Switzerland what George Washington, Abe Lincoln, and Johnny Unitas are to America. The warrior tradi- tion instead of being confined to legend however, is bred into the culture. Archery and riflery are among the most popular national sports. Retired generals that have never fought in a war are national heroes. When asked why he has such strong military obligations, the Swisser will look puzzled as if someone had just asked him why he loves his mother. He will answel' that this is the situation because Switzerland does not want a professional army. The other obvious alternative, that of not having and not needing a powerful army, does not occur to him. Nationalism Swiss militarism points up S\\iss national pride, i.e., nationalism. This nationalism at once inspires excellence and direction on the one hand, and a feeing of superiority on the other. The Swiss like to tell stories like the one about a big American company that sent to Switzerland what they claimed to be the thinnest wire ever drawn. A week later when a company representative came around to collect congratulations from his Swiss friends, the only thing he collected going out for more is understandable. But now, I am very happy with the re:rolt in the Congo and The position of the Western and grateful to say, faculty time is expensive stuff.

Now scandal is not new to government, but the in- teresting thing is the Swiss attitude. Billy Sol and Bobby Baker do not make Americans proud, but there is no sense of personal embar- rassment as there is with the Swiss over this scandal. The feeling of superiority emerges clearly in Swiss relations with foreigners. Although through tourism, Americans have become extremely welcome, the Italian migratory labour force, Oil! which Swiss prosperity is in part dependent, is thought of as filth. Italian equality under the law i's not even professed and citizenship for them is out of the question. One of the main reasons is that Italian work- ers are so not-Swiss. They are Latin and fiery, the Swiss are stolid; .they are \easy livers\ and not especially neat, the Swiss are immacu- late; and, they are poor and must do the menial jobs, while the Swiss, on the whole, are well off. One gets the feeli-ng that a pride in being Swiss also implies a distrust in people who are not Swiss. Although the four independents whose letter appeared in the last issue of Concordiensis made some cogent poirllts concerning the col- lege in genera~, they have ovet·- looked some Important factors when connecting these with the new dormitories. The money use& to construct the dormitories was borrowed from the Federal Gov- ernment under a program design- ed primarily to aid dormitory construction. Thus this money could not have been used for aud- itoriums, student centers, faculty salaries, or the remodeling of the present buildings. Some of the other pomts dis- russed present definite problems that exist on campus. These, however, should be discussed on their own merits for they are irre'evant in relation to the con- struction of the new dormitories. Thomas DiCerbo Victor Fazio Carlson came to the Congo not as a white man hop- ing to dominate an inferior black society, but as a human being who was deeply moved by the needs of the Congo and who wanted to do whatever he could to make life there more bearable. He gave up a substantial yearly income and accepted the position of medical missionary in the Congo for token remuneration. He was a sensitive man who was visibly moved by the conditions he ran into day after day. Even when trouble threatened and he moved his family out of danger, Carlson himself refused to desert his pati- ents. As the rebel's prime hostage, his execution date was set and stayed many times. He was their most important bargaining point. Yet the final and tragic irony is that he was, at the time of his death, just a face in the crowd. The ancient theme that embittered Goya in the 19th century and affected many before and after him is still very much with us today. The tragedy is that we never seem to learn. The Decline We regret that the number of students participating in campus activities this year has dropped significantly from the figure of a few years ago. Few activities have escaped the pinch on manpower. The various campus activities should be as much a part of college life as classroom endeavors. Assuming re- sponsibility is an important facet in educational growth, and the activities provide valuable training in this area. Commitment to an activity involves pain and many times emotional distress. Many freshmen drop out of ac- tivities with the onset of the first round of exams. Grad- ually, as they mature, they learn to cope with classroom life and activities and can carry on both effectively. This is a most important part of individual growth, a part that is missed by those who devote themselves entirely to \book- learning.\ Union, being a small college, enables the individual to be assured of a place (in most cases) in the activity of his choice. It's a shame that all available positions have not been filled. It is not only the activities that suffer from lack of participation-it is the student himself. · A Good Experiment The elimination of grades in Professor Wayne Nowack's Art Criticism course is an exciting educational experiment for Union College. l\lorality Like her army and her nationalism, Swiss morality is also para- doxical. Standards of public morality in government and business are high. Things like the Mirage jet scandal are rare and shocking to the Swiss. Her shop O'.mers have an international reputation for honesty. But where as public ethics usually set high standards and kee·p to them, private morality is hypocritical, The much publicized bourgeois pattern of marriage a.nd infidelity is not rare. While Swiss girls are forbidden to go to Zurich's \bad\street, prostitution stili manages to flouri'sh, which means that either her daddy or her brother must occasionally have a fling. Zurich officially closes at 11:30 (12 on Saturdays), and movie censors here are among the busiest in Europe, but illicit practices have not been unknown. But how does all this help to explain the enigma of Europe. lf using Switzerland to generalize about Europe is valid, one can per- haps get at least a few answers. In Switzerland a synthesis of tra- dition, independence, and diversity has bred ·creativity and progress, but it has also led to friction, suspicion and distrust. There is sus- picion of foreigners and even of other Swiss who do not speak the same language, and there is distl·u:st of things not Swiss. Tradition and independence play a large role in this. Switching to Europe, it is not hard to draw analogies. French independence and distrust of the MLF is one, while traditional Ger- man militarism and ubiquitous European nationalism are others. However, combining the diversity of nationalities in one political unit, thus harnes'sng the productive power of a vast cross-culture, while, at the same time, eliminating the destructive forces of nationalism, has long been a widespread dream. The prohlems involved though, are vast and, at present, insurmountable. Overcoming national sover- eignty in the next ten years seems unlikely. Looking again at Switzerland, though, does give Europe some hope. At one time she was a mountainous area compo·sed of several very independent cantons often warring among themselves. Some spoke German, others French, other Romanish, and still others Italian. bome w<:re industrial, othe1· agricultural. Some had a strong; Prot- estant tradition dating from Calvin and Zwingli while others were staw1chly Catholic. To say that there is no friction and incongm- encies between these canton's today would be incorrect. But to say that Switzerland, nevertheless, has reconciled these differences and functions efficiently is an understatement of major proportions. ETH A word of praise must here be extended to the program which has made these observations pos·sible. Imagine spendmg your junior year in college as a tuition-free graduate student at a prestigious school, and you will get some idea of what being an exchange strident at ETH is like. The ETH was the first and is ·still one of the be&t amalgam's in Europe of technologicaly oriented schools. It is a center for both research and advanced study on a plain with any in the world. The program in which Union participates is run by a charming and personable Swiss, who will go out of his way to be helpful. ETH'l: exchange annually extracts several students from large U. S. uni- versities (among them Yale, Georgia Tech, and the University of Kansas). A truly remarkable thing is that Union, being a small college of little national reputation, is allowed from one to three students a year. Idol Reviewed • • • (Continued from page 2) l\ir. Tulloss' Poetry to greater proportions than what appears on the printed page. True, the nature of the course makes a grade a mean- ingless rating. Yet we would like to see this kind of grade deemphasis tried in other types of courses as well. Reed College has effectively changed its academic climate from a grade grubbing one to one of genuine intellectual curios- ity and desire to learn by the elimination of the grading system in its traditional form. Grades are kept (so they may be given to graduate schools) , but are not distributed to students. Rodham Tulloss' \From Gl·een- mount Cemetery\ and the last poem appearing in The Idol \Six- teen-Line Incantation of the Bea- sons and Solstices\ seem to have varying success. The former deals with an old idea in a not very novel or creative manner, and falls short of producing the feeling that a poem concerning such a lofty subject should. The long-named member of Tulloss' pair of poems is quite clever and indicated the author's marked fa- cility as a word-user. Another point these students seem to mrss is that the new dor- mitories will offer to independ- ents facilities which are far su- perior to any thing now avail- able. For years students have expressed a strong desire for the suite system, and no:w we are fin- ally getting wha:t we asked for. Although fraternity men and in- dependents will be housed \in the same building,\ this is nothing more than a technical observation for there will be absolutely no physical contact between them. We cannot understand how this could possibly detract from the new buildings. Furthermore, the lounges and other areas available could be used in place of a stud- ent center for some activities as they will be far more comforta- ble than those now existing in Soutl1, West, and Richmond. Fin- ally, the fraternities that will be housed in the new dormitories are being evicted from their pres- For the Campus and Plant Committee of the Student Council To the Editor of Concordiensis: Recent issues of Concordy have carried a delightful little adver- tisement I've found both curious and inspiring. \Let Us Be Your Host For That Special Occasion,\ it says for the Ballston Lake Mo- tel. And where is our motel sit- uated? Well, Ballston Lake, of course, happens to be between Saratoga Springs (Skidmore) and Schenectady (Union). That the invitation is not for parents who wish to visit their beloved chil- dren at Skidmore or Union is seen in the rest of the advertise- ment, which proudly calls your attention to the motel's special \Stud·ent Rates.\ As a reader of the Communist press I may tend to read between the lines too often-but I keep wondering what that \Special Occasion\ is.

I have tried to relate a few of the criteria that I regard as es- sential to good literature in Ol'der to clarify my judgments to some ex:tent. The November Idol at times reaches great heights for a college publication. The greatest failing of The Idol, apart from occasional immaturity, was the lack of material. This shortcom- ing is certainly not wholly- the fault of the editl)rs. Although the quality of the writing is not al- ways of the same fine :texture, and the lack of quality gives it little depth, I believe tlwt The Idol for November is, in the main, a rather well-done, worth-rea:ding literary magazine. ~ 1 3 Union Graduates in G.raubart Family'' 166 JAY ST.

Art 20: A Voice In The Dark ··MarxistAppeal Grows In Latin Anterica By Larry Briskman The catalogue calls it \Art 20, Theory and Appreciation of Art\ and describes it us an \introduction to the fine arts\ coverh{g \aesthetic theory, analysis of works of art in the various' media and the evolution of styles!' In a Concordiensis editorial last ~eek Larry Horowitz called it \P1•ofessor Wayne Nowack's Art CriticisU: course\ and described it as \an exciting educational experiment f()r Union College\ because the me1nbers of the class vrith Profes::;or Nowa·ck's approval, decided to eliminate grades in 'the course. The titles and descriptions of the course given by the'se two eminent authorities falls far shol't of the truth. Superficial and Material This \course\ is not really a co1:1rse in the traditional sense of the ·word. Rather it is an attempt to awaken the student to the me- chanized mass culture around him and to arouse him to do something· about that culture. True, it does, as the catalogue suggests, introduce the student to aesthetic theory, especially the aesthetic theo1-y of the Orient. But it does much more than that. It introduces the student to a way of life which is aimed at the \whole man\ and to his inner needs; it leads him away from the American \techne-driven\ culture, which emphasizes man's superficial, material needs. It introduces the student to the psychic disorder of our society and the role of the artist in finding a cure for that disorder. In all, it gives the student something- he rarely gets from a rotu:•se in a college community, a desire to feel and experience emotion and a desire to recognize that that emotion is an expression of man's inner needs which are being thwarted by American society. Eliminates Marks Panamanian Exchange, Student Jose A. Tapia, author of article be- low, meets the Honorable William Alan Cat·tier, Governor of the Canal Zone. By Jose A. Tapia The preceding paragraph gives what I think is an accurate de- scription of the course. It is not an art course; rather it is a course taught by an artist. But it could be taught by any person who recog- nizes the state of decay in which our society exists. It is a course in which grades are totally meaningless because its contents are aimed at the future, not the past. It is a course in which the impor- tant thing is not the memorization of a few facts, but, rather, the Mr. Tapia is a Help Student from quo and those responsible for it adoption of an entirely new outlook upon modern American society. the International Foreign Ser~t..!e and sometimes an explosive ange~ It i·s for this reason that the members of the class voted unanimously School of the University of apd protest translated in into to eliminate marks from the com·se.

He bas worked in the stock- room of the Chemistry Building for forty years and in that time has e~d~a~ed himself to countless victims of brok~n burettes, destroyed d1stillmg flasks, and shattered steam baths. Among his friends is our reporter, Paul Sherwin, who has gathered from Joe these mem- ories of his two generations with Dutchmen chemists. Joe, I will not call him Joseph, Rudmann has worked for the !ast forty-fiv~ years in the ~tock room of Union's chemi'stry build- mg, and havmg reached retirement age, will depart from campus this summe1·. There are some, some old and faded people who with time's turning become fixtures in the wood work of offic~s but not so Joe. He has grown with his work and the work he has done has benefitted by his cheerful, careful handling. Campus Changes, Students Don't In order to understand such a person it is not enough to do the reporter's job of interviewing, but, rather, to see him work. Joe came to 'l}nion in 1(}20 during President Richmond's administration. At that time he worked under Dr. Elery and has subsequently been in. t~e service of Dr., Herd and Dr. Reed. According to Joe, the bmldmgs, the campus landscape have changed much since his first days here, but the stu<lents remain nearly interchangeable parts. There are, of course, variations, but in the main, little in the way of his personal relations \'lrith the boys has altered. Honor System In 1920, there were about 400 student's at Union. Joe feels that both he and the college have lost something with growth. In those days students had to go to chapel at a quarter to eight every morn- ing, certain boys being assigned to pull the bell ropes and announce the morning's coming. At such gay times in the day, more often than not, the ringer~ \'iroulri finrl the bell-ropes on top of the roof. Also, when Joe first came to Union we operated under the honor !'ystem, which was abandoned when students were caught cheating. He remembers a time when a student, taking a make-up examination in the chemistry library, had a book open before him. Joe happened to be stacking books at the time. With the sound of a professor's a'Pproaching steps, the boy called, \Catch!\ and threw the book up to Joe who, calmly proceeding with his work, tossed the book into a wastepaper basket. He has also heard more excu'ses from students to their profs than he cares to remember. One really g{)od one came from a boy who said that the wind blew his alarm clock off his window sill, making him come late for an important lecture. Greased Pig Fraternity Fight The first freshman-sophomore rivalry at Union had a great deal more fighting spirit than is present nowadays. Freshman and sopho- mores, the former holding tomatoes, the latter with salt bags would line up at opposite ends of the pasture (now in front of West Col- lege) like so many warriors o.f old, and march, slowly, towards one another until the inevitable would occur. During football s·eason, pep rallie'S were held in which the students, clad in pajamas, would match through the streets of the town shouting their cry of battle. Before the Union-Hamilton game the students, while parading, would mimic various professors and after the game a greased pig, let loose, would be fought for by fraternity men, the winner's house receiving the prize of an ample pork dinner.

By Prof. Wayne Nowack LISTENING FOR WHICH DRUMMER? \Teach at Harvard? It cannot be done!\ .•• Henry Adams When I agreed with Concordy to write this short piece, I had some very real doubts about doing it, too. If one chooses not to spea.k a;bout campus issues, about curricular changes, student-faculty morale, retirements, or revolutionary things like co-education at Union Ol' throwing out fraternities and the like, then just what is there left for one to say which can make any sense in so few lines of development'? Students are preached at till they no longer listen, thank God'! Efforts to define a \life\ philosophy or \point. of view\ almost inevitably smell of decaying sanctimonious piffle. So I decided that within such limits of' space as I am allowed, I really don't have a great deal to say, but that I do have a few questions I would like to raise. Coolness and Decency Perhaps th~se questions are really parts of one question which has been pestermg me as a teacher for a very long time. Also, as a teacher, I ~ow r am not the only one who finds himself so pestered. .The dnft of wh~t concerns me c~me most recently and again forc1bly to my attention as I was readmg an article by David Boroff in the New York Times of Sunday, December 6th. Prof. Boroff on the English staff at N.Y.U., titles his article: \The College Intellec- tual: 1965 Model.\ He defines the college intellectuals as \the scholar- gypsies who follow •.• their own intellectual bent, •.• whose hori- zons stretch beyond grad ·school and career, and who are cut off from that vast army of students who are only interested in getting through.\ He points out that in more than half the country's colleges these \gypsies\ have \little or no representation whatsoever.\ Fur- thermore, even Where they \flourish as at Harval'd, Berkeley, N.Y.U. etc., \they constitute perhaps 5% of the ·student body.\ In terms of the national collegiate picture, therefore, I would guess, and can only guess, that these intellectuals make up certainly no more than (and probably less than) 1% of the total college student population today. B01'0ff refers to this group as the \post-liberated\ generation, on the grounds that the radicalisms of the \beat\ year's and of the avant-garde of the period c.1950 - 60 have \very little allure\ for it. In following Boroff's descriptions of the mental climate of this \pe>st- liberated\ elite, I was deeply struck with how certain phrases kept bobbing through his discourse, like a backgrotmd and a leit-motif running side by side. Such phrases as: \without exhilaration •.. embarrassed by a display of enthusiasm ... coolness and decency ... too sophisticated for disaffiliation ... caution has become the watch- word • • . cautious co;nsolidation • • . commitment elicits uneasy equivocation • . . commitments become suspect . . . living is having many masks ... everything can be reduced to a game .•• working through the power of structure,\ and so on. Crushed Passion I am not in the least inclined to disagree with what Prof. Borofl has to say about the mood of this elite of the \post-liberated\; witl· few exce.ptions I have discerned among students the same underlyin· mood myself. Now one of my questions is, if this is the mood cha1 acteristic of the current 1% of collegiate intellectual isn't it also th, mood of \the vast army of students who are only interested in get- ting through,\ the 99o/oers, that is 1 So what claims do the intellec- tuals have? Also, how free is thts \post-liberated\ elite? And if, as an intellectual, he supposedly has the advantage of greater discern- ment and the gift for working on a more personal liberation, just what kind of an individual is he becoming 7 Somehow I cannot ignore the fact that all this that we are stealthily breeding an enormous gen€ration of neutralists, because I do not detect behind all this cautiousness the vitality of questioning as much a:s I get the strong scent of a very simster and systematic fear. Still more frightening for me is the realization that this new elite will become the tt;lachers, the manager, the technicians, the programmel'S - the \leaders\ of tomorrow. I fail to see what value a leader has whose youthful passion, enthusiasm, and vitality have been crushed by the rules of the great \game\ before he can even take reins in hand. Neglect of Individual Granted, the drives of our mass cultUl'e are ()Verwhelming, but what is wrong with our college teaching and our co.Jlege classrooms that we cannot reverse the damages of mass drives with even 1% of our students, and that lo/o the intellectual cream? Is college teach- ing today actually abetting this de-personalization, this flattening to the mass majority even in its contacts with the intellectual student? How is this being done? Is it by design and intention, or is it by default? Now, two or three queries to the college teacher. If we look on om· work as more than a \job as more than the duty of just train- · ing people, what has become of our commitment to the individual? How do we guide students in 1964 toward being more an individual, to spare his becoming less an individual? If we are not doing more than training people, then why are we teaching? But if we are dis- content with this neglect of the individual, yet feel we are powerless to act on it, why do we continue teaching? We can answer these questions in many ways, but what are the moral answers, the ones we can live with providing we, too, can make just claim to .being individuals? J;;nnes Baldwin ~ays somewhere that \not everything that is faced can be changed; but nothing can be changed until it is faced.\ I would like to add that fundamentally nothing can be faced unless it is by individuals. Systems Sciences We hear more and more about the mushrooming \·systems sci- ences\ which have focused on the mechanization of behavior. At the risk of slipping into a bit of fantasy, I sometimes wonder if perhaps these \systems sciences\ have not somehow invaded and taken com- mand of human consciousness, or if the formula system have switched from defining the entities o.f experience into the replacement of the entities themselves. This may be why everything assumes increasing neutrality, and we may be close enough to the machines now that there is really no difference between machine-Qbject and machine subject. Creating individuals today? It cannot be done!

Th~re is a web that is being spun by the powers that be in American Society that threatens to entangle and eradicate those values of life that we ought to hold most dear - freedom of inquiry, ideas, speech and other forms of expression. As a result of this web, a peculiar kind of fear has trapped many people (as Professor Nowack points out in the faculty column of this issue). This fear is the fear to be an individual and it causes the loss of any new and unorthodox ideas upon which our progress as a civilization is based. We would like to cite three examples of this. 1) The House Un-American Activities Committee con- tinues to flourish in spite of the fact that it is irreconcilable with a system of free expression in this country. Its func- tion is to investigate \Un-American propaganda activities\ and \subversive and Un-American propaganda.\ It has in the past subjected individuals to the burden of public ex- posure and governmental pressure simply because they be- lieved in ideas and held opinions that were \outside the mainstream of American thought.\ The committee, al- though putting many through the ordeal, has found very few \Un-American·Americans.\ The committee serves no useful purpose and .·should certainly be abolished with ut- most haste. 2) Lenny Bruce, a well known social satirist and comic, was convicted in N.Y.C. of giving obscene perform- ances. Several other cities have handed down the same edict against Bruce. Thus he is effectively finished in his present line of work. Never once has any member of his audience lodged a protest against his performance. In each instance it has been the police department, after him be- cause he is a dope user, that has lodged the complaints against him. They have taken tapes of his performances, cut them so that remarks are out of context and presented them in the courts as .evidence. The decision of the 3 judge tribunal was a split 2-1 verdict. The dissenter decried the loss of freedom of speech and the dictation of \a moral code\ for society by the other judges. No one really knows what obscenity is- it is an ab- stract concept that can be defined only by the individual. One cannot dictate moral values to a society. 3) The violent demonstrations over free speech at the Berkeley campus of the University of Southern California ought never to have been provoked. The administration seems to be giving in now to the demonstrators. The fact that the situation occurred at all in such a great \intel~ lectual\ center is discouraging. ~=.~- Progress in society is made by developing the inno- vlations of individuals. The unity of a society is the unity that comes from the synthesis of the varying new ideas into a meaningful whole. We must move back to a: truly dpen society before any dreams of \the great society\ .can be fulfilled. ~regress Report from Union. - 12./4 U. S. Jettison of MLF Holds Peace Possibilities By Alon Jeffrey It WGuld appear that the Soviet four-power conference on the re- Union has given the United States unification of Germany be estab- an urgently needed escape route lished. The United States might from the maze of the MLF (Multi- withdraw the MLF proposal point- Lateral Nuclear Force). Soviet ing to all these recent develop- Premier Kosygin, in a speech be- ments. fore the Supreme Soviet on Wed- nesday, annormced that his nation wa·s cutting military expenditures by some half a billion dollars. The move was announced in the con- text of a unilateral attempt to 1'E'- duce world tensions. It followed a statement by the Soviet Union at the United Nations that it would be willing to discuss any proposals for disarmament at any time and place. Mr. Kosygin ex- pressed the hope that the 'l!nited States would foHow the Soviet Union''s example and also reduce military expenditures. Defense Cuts Last week Secretary of Defense McNamara announced that there was a possibility that the United States military expenditures for the coming fiscal year might be smaller than for the present year. However, the cuts would result primarily from savings created by the Secretary's streamlining of the Department of Defense. The l:nited States has the op- portunity to foster good-will with the Soviet t:nion, and incidentally perhaps solve the financial crisis in the United Nations, by jettison- ing the proposed MLF. It has been painfully obvious that the Federal Republic of Germany is the only l:nited States ally in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization which favors the MLF plan. As is well knO\vn, Mr. DeGaulle is prepared to fight to prevent PS· tablishment of the MLF, even to the point of destroying NATO which he feels is no longer neces- sary for the protection of France. Labour Dissatisfied At the same time, the Labour Party in Great Britain has been less than pleased with the pro- posed MLF. The Party has alway's been opposed tu the development and continuation of a British nu- clear force. That Prime Minister Wilson has not given his approval to the MLF is obvious upon a reading of the c'ommunique just issued from his talks with PrPsi- dent .Tohn!\on. ThP communiqur ·states in part, \They recognized the importance of strengthening the unity of the Atlantic alliance in its strategic nuclear defense. They discussed existing proposals for this purpose and an outline of some new proposals presented by the British Government.\ The \existing proposals\ men- tioned in the communique are quite obviously the MLF plan. That the British Government felt it necessary to present \some new proposals\ indicates its dissatis- fa-ction with the present MLF plan. Allies Opposed At the same time United State·s allies have been presenting forth- right and veiled objections to the MLF plans. The chief parliamen• tarian for NATO announced last week that such a plan could not be instituted without the concur- rence of all the members. Conse- quently, the United States is stuck with defending an unpopular pro- posal or being forced to drop it. However, the recent action by the Soviet Union may provide the opportunity to retract the MLF proposal w1thout appearing to have been forced to back down. F·oreign Minister Schroeder of the FRG suggested last week that a Possible Benefits The United States could with- draw the MLF in the interests of lessening tensions in response to the Soviet Union's unilateral move. The Soviet Union hat> a phobia about a rearmed Germany, albeit somewhat warranted. Were the United States to withdraw a plan so openly favored by the FRG, the Soviet Union might be lightly pressured into the estab- lishment of such a conference of German re-unification. At the same time, steps might be taken to solve the financial dilemma of the United Nations. Withdrawal of the MLF cer- tainly be highly regarded by Mr. DeGaulle and probably appreci- atPd by Mr. Wilson. Thl\ pres- sures which have plagued NATO since France's detonation of a nu- clear device would be somewhat mollified. The United States has little to lo:>e by pursuing ;;udl a tactic. In fact, it has much to gain, and, more important, can conceal its retrPat behind a good de('d for it>: allies and its enemies. Further- more, it can hardly be expected that the MLF will really pre\'rnt the proliferation of nuclear wea- pons. If the capacity to produce nuclear weapons exists in a nation such as Germany, the MLF ran do little more than postpone their production. Joe • • • (Continued from Page 2) for five. That makes nearly a cen- tury that the Rudmann family has been under the employment of Union. There are certain things, unwithered by age, that stand as landmarks of which we never lose sight. Joe's retirement is akin to the passing of a vibrant breath of the past for many of us. His stay at Union \made me seem as if 1 was always going to college.

Blodgett The Union College Alumni Association of New York, at a dinner held on December 3, honored the three members of the faculty who are retiring this year. Leaving Union this year are Dr. Carter David- son, .President of the college, and Professors Blodgett and Whitaker. More than 100 alumni attended the affair which was held at the Princeton Club in New York City. William S. Dewey, president of the association, presented Dr. D::widson with a certificate of appreciation for his nearly nineteen yea.rs of service to the College. Dr. Davidson resigned in June to become president of the Asseciation of American Colleges on Febru- ary 1, 1965. . Boord Becomes Poli. Sci. Head Dr. James Brecldnridge Board, .jJr., will assume the chairmanship of the Political Science Depart- ment at the start of the second semester. He has been set·ving as the head of the Political Sci· ence Department at Cornell Col- lege. Cornell is a small, liberal · arts eollc>ge in :\It. Vemon, Iowa. Distinguished Bacl!: g-round Dr. Beard has a distinguished · academic backg!:'ound. He re- ceived his A.B. from IncHana in 1953. He went to Oxford as a . Rhodes Scholar, obtaining 'his B.A. there in 1955. After return- ! ing to Indiana to obtain his J.D., Doctor of Jurisprudence, he re- turned to Oxford for an M.A. in 1961. In 19G2 he was awarded ' a Ph.D. from Indiana. Boat·d, a Phi Beta Kappa, lec- tured on government at Indian·a University in 1958\9. Since then he has taught at Elmira for two years. Boa·rd's major fields are comparative gover.nment and poli- tical theory. In addition to teach- ing the basic political sriencl' course, P. S. 21, he ·will give a course in his specialty, Latin Am- erican governments, and hold a seminar honors program. Sino-Soviet Rift I, .; t Blodgett Here Since '36 Dr. Harold Blodgett, Thomas Lamont Professor of English Liter- ature, has taught at Union since 1936. He was educated at Cornell Univet·sity, where he obtained his A.B., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees. Dr • Blodgett's plan's for the future include both research and travel. Next year he will collaborate with Professor Sculley Bradley of the Uni- versity of Pennsylvania on the Varoum edition of Walt Whitman's Leaves Of Grass. The travel aspect of his plans will take Dr. Elod- gett abroad on a foreign assignment in lecturing on American studies. In the pa·st Dr. Blodgett has lectured on American literature in the Far East. Professor Charles Gati, also of the Political Science Department, is giving• a course in Soviet For- eign Policy. This course, which has never been given before, will emphasize the events in the post- Stalin era, including the Sino- Soviet rift. . (. il' I Whitaker Colgate Grad 1 I i( :j : 'l i 'l i' : •(j ~ I Dr. Benjamin P. Whitaker, Armstrong Professor of Economics, has been at Union for 25 years. He earned his A.B. from Colgate Univet·sity in 1921, M.A. and Ph.D. (1931) from Yale University, and was awarded an L.H.D. from \Cnion in 1946 . Challenges Unchanged The principal speaker at the Alumni Association dinner was Dr. Harold A. Larrabee, Pt·oft>ssot· Emeritus of Philosophy. The subject of his talk was \Life on the Shelf.\ He referred to a vast inertia, a 'laissez-fuire' attitude of sitting back and letting progress take place automatically. We see today that this so-called 'Age of Con- tidenl?e' should really have been called an 'Age of Ignorance'.\ 6 h,., Today's criteria are expansion, sales volume, and growth. We dread contraction, even when it means better quality. \But colleges and univet'sities do not become great by becoming big; and Union r·ollcg.: i~_h_~lpY to dcvo~c itsdf to Lhe intensi\\e quest for excellence.\ 'I Class of 1965 1 Concert . • • ., .·.~ I t Holds Meeting The Class of '65 met Tuesday morning in Memorial Chapel to initiate the processes that will lead to Class Day and Commence- ment. The seniors discussed the financial aspects of graduation, and voted for their class orators. Seniors Nominated > t A selected group of seniors of- fered a large list of nominees for \ the posts. Addi,tional n{)mina- tions came from the seniors who ~~ [ attended the meeting. Class pres- \ ident Gary Morris described the , hono. rary positions which include I Keeper of the Jug, Class Poet, IJI 1 Song Leader, Class Prophet, Class Historian, and Ivy Orator. The positions of Class Mar- shalls, as of now, will serve no .~ 1 1 function this year. Despite the support of Morris, the Seniors ~ voted 65 to 25 to di::;pense with the cap and gown at convocations fl' next semester . l Poor Finance The next order of business con- cerned financial matters. The f, Senior Class treasury contains ~) $21.68, which is somewhat short of the $1,000 need for the Com- mencement book and party. The party is ·Scheduled for June 5.

Intramural competition will also be resched- uled. The Glee Club cancelled its · Christmas concert wHh Mary- mount. Some damages, !'esulting from the power failure were also in- curred by the biology department. Professor Winne lost his rare $200 African lung fish which he had k<:pt for five years in the Biolegy building. Professor Babikian, also of Biology, lost seveml critically important mice with which he was experimenting for endocrine aber- rancies. Several ·student projects were damaged as well. Campus Trimmed The United Tree Service began work immediately on the dam- aged trees. They are trimming cracked branches on trees through- out the campus grounds. In addi- tion the crews are trying to free electrical lines fr0m the path of branches which may yet fall. This work will continue for at least two months. In the spring, all dead limbs will have to be remov- ed to prevent disease. In addition tn this task, Jackson's Gardens will have to receive extensive at- tention during the spring. Godfrey, Ill.-(I.P.-A new :eeshman English course has been inaugurated for the fall term by Monticello College. This course represents a departure from the traditional program that relies exclusively on the lecture-recita- tion system. Purpose of the change is to utilize the advantages of the tutorial system by incor- porating within the program a ,~-eekly theme-writing workshop. Recitation and lecture classes will be held to a minimum. 5 1 ••Atl The King's Men'': Story of H uey Long By 1\latt Ratz All the .King's Men will be They act as a chorus and back- shown in E.E. 22 tonight at 7 drop for the main characters.

But the real clincher is price: 4-4-2 prices start lower than any other high-performance car in America designed for everyday driving! Vonda, by the way, is not included. But that's no problem for a tiger like you! Watch for the 4•4•tl ••• coming to your Oldsmobile Quality Dealer•s soon!

Sports MERRY CHRISTMAS Concordy HAPPY ·NEW YEAR Wrestlers Stopped~ 25-11; Frosh Defeat RPI, 21-11 Freshm~en Cagers Squeak College, 72-71 Past Siena Neither Wind Nor Rain Brown: Tri-Sport Captain Three-~port athletes are not common at a school like Union, where students are under co·nstanL academic pressure, but even rarer still is the three-sport captain. Gary Brown, the 5-8, 150 pound senior, is: the first in Union College history - or at least in any- body's memory. Soccet· Captain's Cot'Jler Brown was a halfback and co-captain of the sorc•er tmm this fall, is ca·ptain of the basketball team thi!=! wintE'r, and will be captain of the base- ball team in the spring. \.-\. tremendous leader . intense competitor •.• so lid athlete·.\ Such phrases are repeated over :md over as coaches slum·ble over each other in praise of him. \Gary was instrumental in keeping spirit high on a club that \\·on only- two· of its n.ine games,\ says soc-cer coach Bob Beaudry. \His play was consistent] y outstanding.\ Basl<etball Basketball coach I::l E\·ans says the team could not have picked a better leader. \His hard-driving competitive spirit and excellent physical conditioning com.pensate for his lack of height,\ says Evans. A backcoUtt player, Brm.,·n averaged 13.9 points a game last season, '\.vhich saw l'nion po>'t a 12-9 record. His production was second on the team and be>t among all the returning players. Brown convrt·ted n.3 percent of his freE' throw attempts to lead the team in that department. Baseball Bas<'hall coach Art J,aw1·ence, who has been at Union since the 1930s, rates Brown a solid pitcher and shortstop. \He is one of very few players whom I've coached at Union who could play any posi- tion on a college baseball team.\ . Brown is completi.ng his third season of varsity play in all three ~·ports. He~s also an active member of the Block-U Society for varsity lettermen and is active in the Delphic Society, an honorary student service organization, and his fraternity, Chi Psi. Basketball Banter For those of you who are in- terested in statistics here are a few points to ponder dug up from the annals of Union's basketball htstory: Fewest Points Scored in a Game: 2, vs. RPI on January 10, 1903.

Graduation was only the beginning of Jim Brown's education Because he joined Western Electric Jim Brown, Northwestern University, '62, came with Western Electric because he had heard about the Company's concern for the continued develop- ment of its engineers after college graduation. Jim has his degree in industrial engineering and is continuing to learn and grow in professional stature through Western Electric's Graduate Engi- neering Training Program. The objectives and edu- cational philosophy of this Program are in the best of academic traditions, designed for both experi- enced and new engineers. Like other Western Electric engineers, Jim started out in this Program with a six-week course to help in the transition from the classroom to industry. Since then, Jim Brown has continued to take courses that will help him l<eep up with the newest engineering techniques in communications. This training, together with formal college engineering studies, has given Jirn the ability to develop his talents to the fullest extent. His present responsibilities include the solution of engineer- ing problems in the manufacture of moly-permal- loy core rings, a component used to improve the quality of voice transmission. If you set the highest standards for yourself, enjoy a challenge, and have the qualifications we're looking for- we want to tall< to you! Oppor- tunities exist now for electrical, mechanical attd industrial engineers, and for physical science, lib- eral arts and business majors. For more informa- tion, get your copy of the Western Electric Career Opportunities booklet from your Placement Officer. And be sure to arrange for an interview when the Bell System recruiting team visits your campus.
