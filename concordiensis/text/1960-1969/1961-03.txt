Challenge \This generation of Americans\ asserted President Franklin Roosevelt \has a rendezvous with destiny.\ In the years since FDR spoke those words, students all over the world have acted, by bullet and ballot, to pre- pare themselves to meet the destiny of our age. Possibly the most successful program yet conceived to increase student awareness in the great issues which are shaping our nation and our world is the CHALLENGE program, formed at Yale University two years ago. Specifically, the Yale CHALLENGE program was established as \a stur1ent program at Yale University to confront with realistic concern and responsible action the crucial issues of today's world.\ In practice, CHALLENGE holds annual spring and fall seminars which feature prom- inent speakers and dozens of small student discussion groups -about almost every conceivable area 0f national and world crisis. CHALLENGE, say its leaders, is dedicated to arouse students from the jndifference produqed by their sense of estrapgcmcnt and isolation by providing a vehicle through which college students can reestablish contact with the dynamic forces of the present and future. The groundwork for the establishment of a CHAL- LENGE type program at Union has been set by the ap- pearance on our campus of such groups as the Interna, tiC>nal Relations Club, Great Decisions, the Political Forum, and the \'arious partisan political student groups. Further- more, many responsible student leaders feel tj:J.e need exists for a CHALLENGE type organization at Union.

One of the basic questions which concern the founders of any CHAL- LENGE type program are whether the program will ad- vocate openly a particular point of view or will remain aloof from expressing a preference for one side or the other of the political spectrum. Although many of the principals of such a program are likely to have some strong political views, it would seem desirable that any CHALLENGE program at Union be kept aloof from any political slant.

At the time of the adoption of the \Pfeiffer Plan'' it was hoped that deferred rushiug would improve class and f;lchool spirit. Increased attendance at football games and other athletic events may be considered indicative of the realization of this end. It was further hoped that deferred rushing would improve the caliber of intercollegiate ath- letics and extracurricular activities and raise the academic standing of the freshman class and the fraternity actives. Athletic and extracurricular participation has indeed im- proved and the freshmen's academic standing for the first semE'ster this year, if not that of the fraternity active:s, is an improvement over last year. The ends have been realized. By J. C. Samuel Beckett is an Irish play- vnight who general1y writes in F1•ench. His Hrst play, '\Waiting for Godot,\ was first published in 1952 and was the center of much debate. It is not an easy play to appreciate for it has many aspects which will not be ·under- stood immediately, but ~here a.,e certain clues which may help the playgoer unravel Beckett's tragic and timely statement on our age. The first clue to understanding \Godot\ is in the title. Beckett takes the Anglo-Saxon term for divinity (God}, and the.

The ends havP been realized. By J. C. Samuel Beckett is an 1rish play- wright who generaUr writes in French. His first play, \Waiting i'or Godot,\ was first pll!blishect in 1952 and was the center of much debate. It is not an easy play to appreciate f0r it has many uspe~·ts which will not be under- stDod inunediately, but there U''e certain clues which may help the playgul'r unravel Beekett's tragic and timely statement on our age. The first clue to understanding \G Jdot\ is in the title. Beckett takes the Anglo-Saxon term for di\·init~· (God), and the French diminu~itive ending (ot), and the result IS the name of the charac- to· who pluys the leading part in the play, despite the fact that he never actually appears. Estra- gon and Vladimir, the two chief eharacters, are placed in a time- less Nowhere. (The stage direc- tions merely signify: \A country road. A tt·ee\) Against this bar- ren,. rootless . background, they wart for a. suvwur who never ap- pears. Thetr only connection with the awaitetl Godot is through a mes:;euger who gives them some small hope that Godot wil'l ar- r!ve. Vlad!mir and Estragon eon- tllluc to lrve and to hope on the basis of this chance. Godot is the fulfillment vf their barren beings; they always hope for his arrival but they fear that he will never come. . In .thei_r .marginal nightmare llfe, \ ludtmu· und Estragon con- tinue to go through the futile mo- tion of be!ng ali\e. Occasionally they locate themselves as in th~ scene where Vladimir advises Es- tral;\\on tD elu,oe his fly. Estragon dutrfully obeys, making the re- mark, \\Ve always find some- thing, don't we Didi, to give us the impression that we exist?\ Mid-way in the play, Estragon and Vladimir are visited by two other wanderers. One is Poz!o, the rich man; the other is Lucky, his servant. Puzzo leads Lucl(y Clemens around at the end of a leash. Through Lucky, they attempt a phHosophical answer, but Lucky only blurts ·out a se1·ies of un- connected phiiosophical truisms, ]~ointing up the futility of trying to establish bases and norms in giving our being a significaNce. It is interesting to note also that this play, in the barrenness of its physical setting, must de- pend on dialogue. Beckett's dia- logue is a slangy dial0gue which locates it in the twentieth century. The slang also connotates the de- pendence on time that governs life. Slat~g is the localized lan- guage of a particular period which will die as quickly as those who spoke it. From time to time the lives of Vladimir and Estmgon totter at the threshold of the ultimate door. They realize the truth of Camus' conclusion, \Suicide is the only real question.\ But. in their pa- thetic existence, even this door is clo:;:ed to them. They search for something to hang them- seh·es with, but can only find a rotten belt whirh will not support their weight.

Beckett makes many points in \Waiting for Godot.•• These are only a few interpretations. This weekend's production by the Mountebanks will surely yield a fnscinating evening of thPatre.

What i:; ao::tounding is that su- preme illeal bm and once idle talk han· bPen translated into a con- err!\ progT:tlll. \Vhn ever thought that a nation-wide organization to help those in need throughout the world, would be found any- where else but in a fairytale? The l'clitors of Concordiensis are most interested in learning of Union College's reaction to the l'e:we Corps program. The editors feel that this is a vital and perti- rwnt i>'slle, and one which de- mands both compliments and crit- iri,;m. The l'clitm·s therefore wish to ask th<' farulty and students to submit their reactions by answer- ing a set of four questions: 1. Do you support the principles of the l'eal'e Corps Program~ 2. What do you feel is lacking thus far in the Peace Corps plans, and what could successfully be added? :l. Do yDu think the Peace Corps will fUcreed? In what way? 4. Would you volunteer for sf'rvi<'r in the Peace Corps? On what conditions? When? Why? The editors of Coneordiensis be- lie\e tlwt the students and facul- ty of l'nion have been pondering over these proposals for some time. It is time to express opin- ions. We hope for many construc- tive replies. Please remit your signed answer sheet to these ques- tions in either the Office of the Dean of Students, the main office in Bailey Hall or the Concordi- ensis offire. Cons:.>iencious replies, can, and will be graciously received and methodically evaluated with hopes of submitling them to the Peace Corps office.

2 Government By Decree The social rules are not significantly different from those which governed Union College fifteen years ago. Last summer the Board of Trustees Committee on Fra- ternities and Student Life recodified them, making severai deletions and several additions. During this recodification, the Trustees had two paths of action open to them, either to enact them arbitrarily or to consult those directly con- cerned, the student body, about their needs and sugges- tions under current conditions. They chose to ignore stu- dent recommendations. Instead, they submitted the then already enacted rules to an advisory group, the Alumni Interfraternity Council, for a rubber stamp approval be- fore a final decree. By enacting the ru1es arbitrarily, the Trustees have opposed one of the basic principles upon which our demo- cratic society was fow1ded, ... ''government of the people, by the people, for the people'', Granted that it is ~thin the power of tl:e Trustees to nave decreed the recodified laws, before passing them, they should have consulted a commit- tee representing the Interfraternity Council regarding the present needs of the fraternities in relation to existing circumstances. The conditions whicl;l exist at Union today are not those which existed fifteen years ago. Deferred rushing, for example, introduced a problem which has never before been considered. Since the fall semester is a period of no contact, freshman dormitories are now closed to fraternity men during Fall Weekend. In the past, when the houses were turned over to women,. men were always able to find :>leeping qua1ters in one of the dormitories. Now half of them are \Off-limits\. Rather than rent rooms outside the campus, the fraternities have asked to be permitted to have the men sleep in isolated quarters within the houses. Administration Takes Initiative The administration is to be complimented for having negotiated an arrangement with the IFC by which a uni- formed detective was posted in each house insuring isola- tion of quarters during the last Prom Weekend. This sys- tem has proved satisfactory to the fraternities but will not be made permanent unless approved by the Trustees. We strongly urge that this or another solution to the problem, equally acceptable to the IFC, be seriously considered by the Trustees as a modification of the social rules. Several of the innovations which the Trustees have introduced appear to contribute to the reactionary tone already inherent in the rules. For example, women are restricted to a three hour interval ln which they are per- mitted in fraternity houses during the week. This should be another area where the IFC must take the initiative in proposing a plan suitable to establishing a more liberal regulation which now is manifested on almost every cam- pus of our size and calibre. The student body through the Interfraternity Council should take an active part in modifying the social rules to produce a system more practical in its application to Union College in 1961. Working as a liaison, The Alumni Interfraternity Council's responsibility ·is to present student proposals to the Trustees for due consideration. The Trus- tees remaining opeu minded, should then judiciously weigh all student recommendations submitted to it, always re- membering that \. . . Governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\ By i\Iartin P. Newman The important issue of African Nationalism, currentlY express· ing itself most forcibly in the Congo, is a matter of .concern. and discussion at the Umon Natwns. It is more significant at this time for in New York City. there is an ever increasing number of black nationalists, Muslims, and pro-African organizations at- tempting to overcome what they' consider the lethargy of the City's Negroes. Their purpose is to ?-id in the agitation for a non-colomal- ized Africa. These groups, loca'c·3d for the most part in the Bedfor.d- Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn and in Harlem, hGid their meet- ings or services more often than not on sidewalks and consist of only about two thousand active members. In comparison, there are about 23.000 dues paying NAACP members in New Yorl,, almost 90 per cent of whom are Negro. However, figures are fic- kle things at best and these given vary considerably with world happenings. Most of the groups which are now active are based on either religion or a c11ltural basis. Some of those based on religion are: Nation of Islam: A nationwide organization since 1930 led since 1933 by Elijah Muhammad (bom Elijah Poole in Ga· in 1898) and with headquarters in Chicago. The New York chapter, Temple No. 7, has been strong at least since 1957 and is led by 35 year old Nebraska-born minister, Malcolm X. Estimates place Temple No. 7's membersh'p at about 1000 and na- tional membership at 50,000. Mr. Muhammad advocates separate states for a \separate black na- tion\ within the borders of the United States. Muslim Brotherhood: This group. led by Talib Ahmed Dawud, contends it is true Muslim and is opposed to the Muhammad move- ment which it insists is teaching race hatred. At times this group has been associated with the United African Nationalist Move- ment. United African Nationalist :\Iovement: Started in 1948 ·by J·ames Rupert Lawson this group actively. presses for the establish- ment of \independent black na- tions\ and \economic self-determ- ination in all black communities, instiHing the slogan: 'Buy black'.\ Mr. Lawson opposes communism because he fE>els it would just. be exchanging one slavemaster for another. He opposes Zionism ·he- cause he feels the land given to establish Israel was Arab land. His movement is estimated to }]ave 100 active members. Universal African Nationalist Movement: This movement has been led since 1930 by BenjanJin Gibbons and its slogan is \Africa for the Africans-those at home and those abroad.\ It ·has an es- timated 100 members in New York and is currently advocating a bill to allow voluntary migra- tion to Liberia. African Nationalist Pioneer Movement: This group is an off- shoot of the Gibbons' group which broke away in 1948. It is led by Dominican Carlos Cooks and one of the reasons it split with Gib- bons was the \Buy Black\ :policy. Other religious or political groups are: The Garvey Club, United Sons and Daughters of Africa, and The First Africa Corps. Some of the groups are based on cultural ties and feelings: Cul- tural Association foi· Women of Mrican Heritage, Order of Dan- bhala Ouedo, Liberation Commit- tee for Africa, On Guard Commit- tee for Freedom, Provisional Com- mittee for a Free Africa, and the Communist Party of the U.S.A. Regardless of the motives or the aims of these African Nation- alist Groups, their importance rannot be ignorPd. They may not be la1•ge, and they may not ap- pear to be too powerful, but should there be an unforeseen cnange in the African colonial sit- uation they may suddenly become a major motivating force in the African independence fight. No matter what is done about them, they cannot be ignored. Quality Seen For 1965 \We feel that although there were 15% fewer applications this year, we have received a better quality of applicant,\ stated Mr. Jonathan Pearson III, Director of Admissions. commenting upon the Class of '65. Up until four years ago, twen- ty-five oer cent of those .students admitted to Union College had verbal College Board scores be- low 450. This year, only nine stu- dents who applied had verbal scores below 450; This seems to indicate that Union College is getting a better caliber of stu- dent applying. The average ver- bal score for 1538 applicants is 556. The average quantitative score is 605. SubFrosh Calibre High Pearson added that to date 211 students have been admitted. Out of 'these students only four had a verbal score below 500 and only three had a mathematic!! score be- low 500. The present freshman elass has 31 students whose ver- bal score is below 500 and 7 mem- bers whose mathematics score is below 500. Taking everything into account, Pearson believes that the Class of '65 will not be drastically differ- ent from the nresent Freshman ·class. There will he a ma>::imum of 300 students as compa4·ed to lHO now. This decrease is due to the renovation of South College, making this building unusuable next year. \Colle~>\e Board scores are not everrthing,\ stated Pearson. \In 95'; of the cases. they are a good test- The college admissions officer has to figure out where they are not.\ Pe11rson does not feel that the· verbal score gives a true pic- ture of the English ability of a student. He believes that the writ- ing sample, an innovation this year, could prove to be the equali- zer. He further added that al- though the writing sample would not weigh heayily in 95% of the cases, if it helps the admissions officer in the other 5o/o, it is worthwhile. for the finest in cus:om clothing and .furnishings 14 B 44t!.

Tracy At its sixth meeting in con- junction with the Great Decisions program, the International Rela- tions Club considered the prob- lems ,thveatening a free Western Hemisphere. The Fore'gn Policy Association's fact sheet provided the needed background material on th.e economic problems facing the Latin American countries. The sheet placed. special emphasis upon the unique roH of United States' private irttestment in th!s area. In the eyes of many, the United States is .partially to blame for the economic troubles of Latin America because · as chief buyev of their goods we keep the priCes of their exports. Iow, yet as the principal manufactuter of their imports from us, we keep pricc:s high. The sheet also noted that new United States private invest- ments dropped considerably in 1959· Monroe Doctrine· Recalled These economic condit!ons, to- gether with a general feeling that the United States is indifferent to the aspirations of the Latin Amer- ican people, have brought a rise of \ah·ti-Yankeeism.\ Up until the most r:ecent •events in Cuba, the Western Hemisphei'e has :;;ettled its own grievences within the prot,C:diYe frmne\vork of the Monroe Doctrin,e. Now, as. the fact sheet states·: \'I'he trend, (some. experts sa,y), is .going ag~dnst the U. S ... in its historic role in the· Westem Hemisphere.\ Allen Bensky, vice-president of the club, sought out the opinion of its members concerning the r0U of private investment. e~ononi.ic self-deterJ;nination, and dictator~ ships. in Latin America.

Secondly, some members ielt. that the President's refer• ·ences to \necessary social re- forms, -includhi.g land and tax re- forms • .. \ could be misinterp- reted by some to mean updesii'able Unit(rl States intervention in in- ternal pulltics. It was agreed that such xefoFms are meant to come f1•om the people themselves. Ken- · nedy's .proposal to use the newly c1·eated Peace Corps and Food for Peace .program was· noted.

Newman The important issue of African Nationalism, currently express- ing itself most forcibly in the Congo, is a matter of .conc~rn. and discussion at the Unwn :::\atwns. It is more significant at this time for in New York City. there is an ever increasing number of black nationalists, Muslims, and pro-Aft'ican organizations at- tempting to overcome what the,Y' consider the lethargy of the C1ty s Negroes. Their purpose is to aid in the agitation for a non-colonial- ized Afr1ca. These groups, locat.,d for the most part in the Bedfor,d- Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn and in Harlem, hold their meet- ings or services more often than not on sidewalks and consist of only about two thousand active members. In comparison, there are about 23.000 dues paying NAACP members in New York, almost 90 per cent of whom are Negro. However, figures are fie- Ide things at best and these given vary considerably with world happenings. Most of the groups which are now actiYe are based on either religion or a cultural basis. Some of those based on religion are: Nation of Islam: A natiomdde organization since 1930 led sinre 1933 by Elijah Muhammad (horn Elijah Poole in Ga. in 1898) and with headquarters in Chicago. The New York chapter, Temple No.7, has been strong at least since 1957 and is led by 35 year old Nebraska-born minister, Malcolm X. Estimates place Temple No. 7's membersh'p at about 1000 and na- tional membership at 50,000. l\1r. Muhammad advocates sepantle states for a \separate blaC'k na- tion\ within the borders of the United States. ~luslim Brotherhood: This gl'Oup. led by Talib Ahmed Da1vud, contends it is true Muslim and is onposed to the Muhammad move- ment which it insists is teaching race hatred. At times this g1oup has been associatcd with the United African Nationalist Move- ment. United African Nationalist :\lo,ement: Started in 1948 by- James Rupert Lawson this group actively presses for the establish- menl of \ind~pendent black na- tions\ and \economic self-determ- ination in all black communities, instilling the slogan: 'Buy black'.\ }\Jr. Lawson opposes communism beeause he fpels it would just be exchanging one slavemaster :liar another. He opposes Zionism be- cause he feels the land given to establish Israel was Arab land. His movement is estimated to have 100 active members. U ni versa! African Nationalist i\Iovement: This movement has been led since 1930 by Benjamin Gibbons and its slogan is \Africa for the Afl'icans-those at home and those abroad.\ It has an es- timated 100 members in New York and is currently advocating a bill to allow voluntary migra- tion to Liberia. African Nationali~t Pioneer 1\Iovemcnt: This group is an off- shoot of the Gibbons' group which broke away in 1948. It is led by Dominican Carlos Cool~s and one of the reasons it split with Gib- bons was the \Buy Black\ policy. Other religious or political groups are: The Garvey Club, United :Sons and Daughters of Africa, and The First .Af:rica Corps. Some of the groups are based on cultural ties and feelings: Cul- tural Association for Women of African Heritage, Order of Dan- bhala Oucdo, Liberation Commit- tee fot• Africa, On Guard Commit- tee for Freedom, Provisional Com- mittPP for a Free Africa, anll the Communist Party of the U.S.A Regardless of the motives or the aims of these African Nation- alist Groups, their importance c~nnot he ig-norPrl. Thf>y may ll()t be large, and they may n.ot ap- pear to be too powerful, but should there be an unforeseen cnange in the Aft·ican colonial sit- uation they may suddenly become a major motivating force in the African independence fight. No mattPr what is done about them, they cannot be ignored. Quality Seen For 1965 \We feel that although there were 15'/o fewer applications this year, we have received a b~tter quality of applicant,\ stated l\!r. Jonathan Pearson III, Director of Aclmissions, commenting upo11 the Class of '65. Up until four years ago, tll:en- ty-five ner cent of tho~£> ~twlrnts admitted to Union College had verbal College Board scores be- low 450. This year, only nine stu- dents who applied had verbal scores below 450. This seems to indicate that Union College is getting a better caliber of stu- dent applying. The average ver- bal score for 1538 applicants is 556. The average quantitatil·e score is 605. SubFrosh Calibre High Pearson added that to date 211 students have been admitted. Out of these students only four had a verbal score below 500 and only three had a mathematics score be- low 500. The present freshman class has 31 students whose ver- bal score is below 5{)0 and 7 mem- bers whose mathematics score is below 500. Taldng everything into account, Pearson believes that the Class of '65 will not be drastically c!!ffrr- ent from the nresent Freshman class.

Friday, March 17, 196 t Great Decisions 1961: Americans In Je.opardy By Ellsworth M. Tracy At its sixth meeting in con- junction with the Great Decisions program, the International Rela- tions Club considered the prob- lems threatening a free Western Hemisphere. The Fore·gn Policy Asst'lciation's fact sheet provide.! the needed background material on the econemic problems facing the Latin American countries. The sheet placed speciul emphasis upon the unique roll of UBited States' priYate investment in th:s area. In the eyes ef many, the United States is partiaJ;Iy to blame for the econ0mic troublt's of Latin .Amet·ica because as chi£>f buyer of their goods we keep the prices 0f their experts low, yet as the principal manufactm·er of their imports from us, we keep prices hi~·h. The sheet also noted tlmt new United St:J.tes pdvate im·est- ments dropped considerably in 1959· Monroe Doctrine Recalled These economic condWons, to- getht:r with a general feeling that the United States is indifferent to the aspirations of the Latin Amer- ican people, have brou!!'ht a rise of \anti-Yankee.ism.\ Up until the most recent events in Cuha, the Western Hemisphere has sPttled its own grie,·ences within the prote~tive framewo1k of tlv~ 1\lonroe Doctrine. Now, as the fact sheet states: \The trend, (some experts say), is going a:gainst the U. S.. in its historic role in the Western Hemisphere.\ Allen Bensky, vice-president ·of the club, sought out the opinion of its members concerning the roll of private investment. e·onomic self-determination, and diC\tator- ships in Latin America.

Tl\c text Gf President Kennedy's major p<'i icy speech before a group oi' Latin Ameri.can diplo- mats on 1\Iurch 13 provided a very t'mely b.1s:s for the discussion, wh :eh rentcrerl around two spe- ri fie points. The !'residential Proposals Fh·st rEscus~ed was the chan- nels through wh'ch the president's prop Jseu $5:lO,OOO,OOO 'can be best adminbtered. President Kennedy in·,,,osed that the Inter-American E\o'nomic an<l SJcial Council be the vehide ~f our aid. To this, no 1 •nemher of the IRC seriously dis- ~'gteed Se:·ondly, some members :clt that the President's refer- ences t0 \recessary social re- forms, induding land and tax re- forms ... \ could be misinterp- reted by some to mean undesirable l:nitcd Stutes intervention in in- tel'llal politics. It was agreed that such n~forms are meant to come fwm the people themselves. Ken- nedy's proposal to use the newly ct·cuted Peace Corps and Food for Peace program was noted . The group as a whole reached no sweeping conclusions as to how the Uni.tet! States can best deal with the establishment of the communist regime in Cuba. Pro- fc:;sol' Bristol noted that the Cnited Stntes and Mexico eventu- ally reached agreement as to 'ompcnsution for oil property of the United Sta:tes expropriated from private investors as a result of the Mexican Constitution of Hl17. However there is no prece- dent to the serious challenge Cuba poses to the Monroe Doctrine. It appears that the United States goYernment, as well as the In- ternational Relat'ons Club, is playing a waiting game on this issue. ii Repairs & Sales on n all makes of ~:.i , .. ~ Electric Shavers ABRAMSON'S LAUNDROMAT 1 0 lbs. for 25c: 3 Min.

We've forced them to pay their \debt\ to an al!ege4ly humanistic society but they re- main serenely unrehabilitated. The results have tragi-comic overtones. Once a humanities pro- fessor aslce:d our rlass to jot down · what we considered the greatest work of art in history. For 10 or 15 panic-striel(en minutes we sat in numbed silence; I conferred sotto voce with: a neighbor and we decided to flip a coin over Bee• thoven's sym:pl10nies~we'd heard of Beetho~:en. He won Beetho- ven's Fifth and I chose the Sev- enth. The answer, we disvovered, should have been Don Giovanni; no alternative was allowed. We were willing to accept the profes- sor's dictates in such esoteric mat- ters--but it was quite a while be- fore my eo-conspirator and I got rid of the irnp!'ession that Don Giovanni was a painting. Nor was this experience unique.

There will always be a need for piloted aircraft. And it is foreseeable that in your working lifetime, there will be piloted spacecraft-piloted and navigated by Air Force officers. But right now, there is also a big future for·college- trained Air Force officers on the ground. New ana exciting technical jobs are opening up. Important ad· ministrative positions must be filled as World War II officers move into retirement: How ean you-a college student-become an Air Force officer? First, there's Air Force ROTC.

As the communications needs of our nation become steadily greater and more complex, the Bell Telephone System is continuing its pioneer work in microwave by \taking to the air\ more and more to get the word across·. To this end, Western Electric-the manu- facturing arm of the Bell System-has the monumental task of producing a large part of the microwave transmission equipment that knits our country together by shrinking thou- sands of miles into mere seconds. In spite of its great technological strides, the science of radio relay is a rapidly-changing one. And new break-throughs and advances are common occurrences. A case in point: our Bell System \TH\ Microwave Radio Relay.· This newest development in long-distance telephone transmission will eventually triple the present message-carrying capacity of exist- ing lung-haul radio relay installations. A full- scale system of 6 working and 2 protection channels can handle 11,000 telephone m¢S- .sages at the same time. To make microwave work takes a host of special equipment and components: relay towers, antennae, waveguides, traveling wave- tubes, transistors, etc. But just as important, it takes top-caliber people to help us broaden our horizons into such exciting new areas as communication by satellites! And microwave is only part of Westem Electric's opportunity story. We have-right now-hundreds of challenging and rewarding positions in virtually all areas of telephony, as well as in development and building of defense communications and missile guidance systems for the Government. So, if your future is \up in the air,\ you owe it to your career to see \what's up\ for you at Western Electric. Opportunities exist for electrical, mechanical, indus- trial, civil and chemical engineers, as well as physical science, liberal arts, and f,usiness majors.
