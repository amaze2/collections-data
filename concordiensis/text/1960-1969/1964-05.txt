Since his graduation, Lewis has made good his promise of achievement. He went to Har- vard for his masters, in public administration. After a stint in the Navy, he returned to Harvard, then Union, working for his doc- torate at the former and teaching at the latter. He received his doctorate in 1950, his dissertation having been entitled, \Towards an Administrable Price Policy for Full Employment.\ Between 1950 and 1953 Lewis worked in the government as the assistant to Leon B. Keyserling, chairman of the Council of Econ- omic Advisers to the President, then Harry Truman. Last year it was announced that he would take the position vacated by Kermit Gordan.

CORRECTION There was a mistake in the Faculty Council article which ap- peared in Concot·diensis last week. It was incorrectly reported in that issue that the Faculty Coun- cil had moved to pass a motion to set up a curriculum evaluation committee. This was not the case. The Faculty Council referred the motion to the divisions. No other action was taken on the motion.

Van Vranlten DesForges The contributor to this week's guest column, Professor A. VanVranken DesForges, is a Professor of Civil Engi- neering. Before risking my equilibrium in this treacherous terrain (hey, Gil, how about some test boring-s!) I want to salute Neal Allen's re- freshing and provocative view of what education mig·ht be like were we all to catch fi.t•e and start a great conflagration. That goes for faculty as well as students, in my opinion. Professor Allen speaks for many of the faculty, I hope - at least for me - when he opines: \But one keeps wishing a few of these intense young men would relax a bit, look around them, sample more widely and more deeply the rich variety that our world and our civilization offer.\ How true, but do we invite this, or do we even allow time for such reflection with our rigid academic schedules, multiple \busy-work\ assignments, long labs and longer lab reports, ·fifty minute - stop watch - feed back - near Gestapo proctored the bow-tied, polk-a-dot salesmen to some far away place, leaving the little black man alone to play to his own ears, letting him moan and the walls and tables and chairs who understand his song and writhe and resonate with him.

How much actual student participation and whole hearted involvement do we invite as a regular accepted prac- tice'! Is not the very life blood of learning the development of inde- pendent critical thinking? A,nd how can such thinking be nurtured without intensive reading, reflecting, discussing and writing about the views of those who have mastered the art? cemented tears and the cotton fields have danced, entranced by the melody of shades and hues for the unperfumed, glitterless world of white shacks and blacks and tar-papered roofs melting under a blazing red sun, fed by coal from distant Hades, lying irrevocably near the boss' house.

At a school of the type and size of Union, if there is no longer time nor inclination for personal contact between student and professor, for a bit of leisure for each to contemplate life and one's opportunity and privilege in our society to make a contdbution, it seems to me we liave lost much of our raison d'etre and it is about time we took corrective measures - such as those suggested by Professor Allen: \Perhaps for example, we can modify - not dilute - the rigid requirements of credit hours needed for graduation. Perhaps we should re~xamine the present five course load for students - or relative to the calibre of reading that the average student is doing - or more probably is not doing - it is a disturbing comment on our colleges and universities that they seem so ineffective in stimulating permanent intellectual interests of a high order among their graduates.\ Amen! as white and black convulse in rhythmic ecstasy and become blue.

He cannot modify his piece to fit the new level, the uncontrolable, cas- ual reality that intrudes. There are more problems for the direc- tor and author than this zoologi- cal one.

The author, speaking the last lin-es, says, \A red robbed c a r d i n a I, his sister-in-law's daughter . . . something must have been wrong with the con- struction.\ The directing of John Thompson and Art Campbell, per- haps the bes~ of. the evening, adeptly uses hghtmg and music -in addition to the author's orig- jnal directions - to heighten the 1m pact of the play. The experi- enced acting of Charles Panken- ier and Elaine Rachlyn helps to make the play live - they give it a sparkle that it did not have, at least for me, on the printed page. Powerful Presentation of Conflict Now 1 had better hie myself back to my own side of the campus before I am accused of \poaching but what is a \balanced college,\ if' one cannot sally forth in other's territory now and then? In this era of accentuated specialization in too many areas of life, engim-ering education finds itself in the midst of a great con- troversy concerning the delicate matter of timing. There are many .Lemingly plausible arguments for both early and late specialization - running the gamut from those embracing purely econornic Yalues to those based largely on cultural values; with the usual social, per- sonal and other considerations thrown in to further becloud the issur. Limitation on Engineers Fading It is claimed by many engineering educators and others inti- mately concerned with the engineering field that considerable progress has been made in the great struggle o.f the past few decades to lift the shackles and limitation!> of strictly technical training. Conversely, it is only fair to note that an increasingly articulate school of thought is developing in engineering circles to the effect that the spectaculat· results of nuclear fission, space age experiments and electronic com· puter science are pointing to the dang·er of an even earlier and - in some respects - narrower form nf engineering science specialization than any that has yet existed! \For the Repose of Her Soul,\ Ralph Radell's piece, is played with the feeling and the under- standing that the actors bring with them because of the fact that their ages correspond to the agt;s of the characters.

Adviser Mothers of 1967 The following editm'ial first appeared in the Concord- i-ensis in September, 1916. We find it is still timely today. Your boy has started out along the highway that in- evitably leads from home. It is not to be avoided, nor, certainly would you try to avoid it. Boys must grow into men. The world must move. You are glad to have your boy able to start out under auspices so propitious as his may be. But you have a right to certain fears, certain com- punctions, in regard to the step your boy has taken. You have a right to worry, though worry ne'er mended any wrong. A thousand times has it been said that college is a new experience, occasionally, a dangerous experience for boys. Not knowing colleges, or the men in them, it may be you may distrust the unknown. That is perfectly nat- ural. Certainly your boy is \up againpt\ something new - new freedom, new responsibilities, new endeavors, and new chances. He is perhaps \on his own\ as he never has been before. Therefore, it may be good here, editorially, to say a few things about what college really is, and what college really is not. There are a great many fallacies about col- lege, a great many more fallacies of an unpleasant nature. For years the college man and the college atmosphere have been ridiculed by the public prints, and the public temper. College men have for years been considered deficient in certain qualities, extravagant in certain defects. At one time these accusations and beliefs may have been grounded in fact, though we personally doubt it greatly. This is what a college is: A college is a great hot-bed enclosed in the sun-warmed glass of wisdom, for bringing into bloom the best that is in young manhood. Here -let us say at Union- is the shelter, the cultivation, the under- standing, that can and will develop to its utmost whatever best quality your son has. If he has it in him to grow up sturdy and stl'1ong and fine, here he will do it. If he has it not, here he will be sheltered far more than in the outside world, and some bloom of worth may come with the shelter. Unfortunately, weeds grow rankest in the best soiL But of course your son is not that weed; and furthermore, that weed and all the others are soon rooted out by care- ful gardeners. College puts fine things in a man's heart and in a man's way. College gives a man the four years of all his life that he will best remember. College does many other things, such as teaching a man Greek roots and the elec- tron theory. Best of all college takes a man to itself, and makes him a real part of a tradition, and institution, a 'place and a name that have a human heart. Here are a few things that college is not: College is not a drinking club. College is not a herd of simpering, flag-flapping lunatics. College is not a profaner prep school. Best of all, college is not a retreat for grinds. But it does little good to tell you mothers what college is not. You will be far more interested in what it is, and that we are glad to have been able- in part- to tell you. Mothers of 1967, you needn't fear for your boy. Concordy Endorses-II With the greatest diligence and persistence the Stu- dent Council Caucus, after a second emergency meeting managed to find two people willing to run for President of the Student body. At it happens, both aspirants are qualified for the posi- tion but we feel that Victor Fazio has the edge by dint of his three years of experience on the council. ~· I Jazz Notes: The Avant Garde In the last few columns in this series, I intend to treat the avant garde movement which is trying to sweep jazz today. Many people have expressed the opin- ion that the music which is pro- duced by the far out boys is \anti-jazz\ and barely worthy of called music. Others hold that the New Thing (as the movement is of- ten called) will save jazz from stagnation, that it is analogous to the hop revo- lution of the late f o r t i e s, only valid form of jazz for our times. Neither is completely correct. The New Thing certainly is music, and is also jazz of the first order when played by first order musicians. It is not, how- ever, a continuation of the jazz innovations which were made by Bird, Diz, and Monk. The main difference between the bop forms and the earlier forms of jazz is in the complexity of the harmony and rhythm. The New Thing has abandoned repetition of harmonic patterns as a basis for impro- visation in favor of more free- dom of expression. This is, of course, playing with fire in the form of anarchy, but is basically very logical. When Dizzy Gillespie wrote \A Night in Tunisia,\ for example, he did not lay out a sequence of chords and then sketch a melody above them. Certainly the melody came first, as it did in the his- tory of music. Melodies imply harmonies, not vice versa. It should be very obvious that if one By Thomas Krehbiel is to improvise expressive and poetic melodies, one should not be hampe1·ed by a set harmonic pattern. This is not to say that in the past it has been impossible for jazzmen to create excellent melodies over a preordained set of chords; we have much record- ed evidence to the contrary. But it is almost scary to try to im- ag·ine what a musician of Charlie Parker's talents would have play- ed if he had been completely frl'e to play as he was moved. And what about this business of sta11dard length choruses '! Why should a tune of any par- ticular number of bars take an equal number of bars (or a mul- tiple of that number) to develop'! No classical composer eve1' put sueh a foolish limitation on him- self, why should one who plays jazz (who is also a composer)'! The foregoing is my case for the avant garde. These are my reservations. First, the New Thing has become a haven for the inept. Many jazzmen who don't have the talent to pe1·form effec- tively in the more traditional forms have turned to the avant garde and the cry of \Freedom!\ to cover up their mistakes. My second reservation is not with the music itself, but with the critics and fans who have little under- standing of the music, but are attracted by its newness and its Jack of acceptance by the aver- age fan. This leads these \super- hippies\ to put down any past jazz forms and applaud even bad performances of the new. There can be no doubt, how- ever, that soon all the noise will quiet and the New Thing will be absorbed into the mainstream of jazz. Letters to the Editor To The Editor of Concordiensis: \Concordiensis\ is guilty of an injustice to Jack Seifert, Presi- dent of next year's Juuior Class. I am referring to the caption un- der the picture of the newly elected class officers, found on the first page of the April 14 issue. Mr. ·Seifert has been a respon- sible officer of his class for the past two years. He had a leading role in the organization of the Nott News, and was active in the reorganization of the Union Cheerleaders, in addition to his regular duties required of a class president; thus proving that an insult as was connotated by the article was totally unwarranted. The very fact that he has been elected to a third term suggests that the majority of his class- mates are satisfied with his job. find vent in the \Coneordiensis\ in the futu1·e, and those respon- sible will apologize to Mr. Sei- fert. Howard G. Wiedman More on Royal Gambit The following is reprinted fl'Om the Vassar Miscellany News. \It's an ideal play to stage at Vassar,\ said Norris Houghton, chairman of the Vassar drama departnent and director of the Experimental Theatre's fifth and final production, Royal Gambit to be presented April 30, May 1 and 2 in A very Auditorium at 8:30 p.m. The open dress rehear- sal is this evening. Present president Lawton Morrison has set up the machinery with which the council can work next year. A firm guiding hand is now needed at the helm and we feel that Fazio will provide this leadership. I can't help feeling that those members of the \Concordy\ staff responsible for this caption are guilty of allowing personal opin- ion to find its way into what should have been strictly a news article, the purpose of which was to do nothing more than intro- duce newly elected officers. Critical implications such as found in this caption should be placed in the editorial page if it is the opinion of the paper. I have every hope that an act of immaturity and lack of re- sponsibility such as this will not Royal Gambit, written by a contemporary G e r m an play~ wright, Hermann Gressieker, de- scril)es the life of Henry the Eighth and his · six· wives begin- ning with his marriage to Anne Boleyn and ending with his death. It was first produced in Germany in 1957 and won the Gerhart Hauptmann Award, comparable t(l our Pulitzer Prize, the follow- ing year. In 1959 the play trans- lated and adapted into English by George White, was produced in New York City. \We are very fortunate to have the distinguished actor Nicholas Kepros. in the title role as King Henry,\ continued Mr. Houghton. Friday, May 1, 19641 Friday, May l, Dilemma • • • (Continued from Page 2) of this experiment, but I gaine(l the distinct impression (with solid .personal, though unofficial, administrative support) that their particular purposes were, in the past, somewhat better served by the liberal arts graduates on the whole. It is true that the technical I'equirements in the past, with some ex- ception, were not of the highest order in the majority of their jobs. (I have just learned that this trend is now changing with the work much more technical -as in most fields - and with the recently hired engineers having an improved general background). 3. It has been asserted that engineel'ing students at Union now do much better in American Civilization at the senior level than they did formerly at the junior and sophomore levels. This may be significant only in that it indicates greater seCUl'· ity and confidence on the part of seniors. I suspect that grades in technical subjects are correspondingly higher for the sen- iors. Maturity must play a l'Ole in grades for all subjects. Also in equitable comparison would l'equire the same teacher at the different levels. 4. Union College's unique five year engineering-liberal arts pro- gram under \one roof\ does a tremendous job for the better than average student, in my opinion. This balancing of tech- nical and general courses throughout the five years seems to provide more challenging motivation and reduces the problem of adjustment due to radical and sudden curriculum changes. Further, these students not only have a definite job goal in mind - or at least think they have - which seems to be almost as impo1·tant from a motivational point or view, but \ they usually have a realization that a broader education has long term economic advantages, as well as valuble aesthetic and social implications. This program is difficult and its con- tinued growth and success attests to the fact that our admis- sions people deserve credit for selecting students of a calibre equal to the challenge. 5. After the recent provocative address at Union College on the European Common Market by General Electric Board Chair- man, Mr. Gerald Phillipe, at the induction ceremonies of Tau Beta Pi, National Engineering Honorary Society, I asked Mr. Phillipe his opinion on early vs. late specialization. I thought he had answered all questio:qs in a direct and forthright man- ner up to that point; he smiled, related another knotty pl'Ob- lem of a somewhat comparable nature to fortify his position that he, \would rather not get into this one just now as it is a bit too hot to handle in the time available.\ Specialization in the Humanities . . Fi~ally 1 may I venture the. o~in~on that this nasty state of spe- c1ahzat1on 1s no respecter of d1scrplmes and has boldly invaded the Humanities and Social Studies, as well as Engineering and the Nat- ural Sciences. In fact, how much more specialized can one become than to be an authority and devote one's career to a particular type of art, ~chool of painting, or the life of one man as many historians or Enghsh scholars do, even though such a study may be fascinating and enormously rewarding? Engineering and Science must recipro- cate in the broadening and integrating areas by offering such courses as the History and Development of Engineering and Science for 1 Liberal Arts and Soci~l Studies majors. It seems to me that only by a better understandmg of at least the broad function of all disci- plines can we appreciat.e the wm:t~ and contribution to be made by earh one, and thus acqmre the spn·It~_!:amwork and cooperation. ...........,.. .,...TT T f f f f f f f Y f f f f f V f f t 'f f f f f T t V f f f~i T t f' t f t ;· DIAMANTE'S Enjoy our Fine Home Cooked Italian Food in Our Comfortable Dining Room OPP.

MUSIC CORNER Page 2 Concordy Sports EXAM SCHEDULE PageS Track1nen Outrun Ver~n~ont' Ring Approaches Mile Record Athletes Of Month Nominated By Charlie Lasky -t·---· ------ Behind a superlative dis- play of individual effort, Coach Bill Ketz's thinclads gained their first win of the season Wednesday, with a 78M62 victory over the Uni- versity of Vermont. Feat?r- ing the near record breakmg effort of miler Dave Ring, and the double win of 220 ace Toby Lustig, the Garnet evened its record at 1-2-1, with the expectation of a re- peat performance at Middle- bury this week. Hing, Lustig Win Sophomore Dave Ring, who has been steadily improving at every outing, produced his best th;.1es. of the Rtill voung season, by wmmng· the mile in 4 :2G.li, and copping the two mile run in an equally excel- lent showing of 9:58.8. His mile effort was only a mere two sec- onds off the standing school rec- ord of 2:24. Dependable Toby Lustig also featured importantly in the win, as he brought home first place points in the 220 and 440 yard sprints, with times of 22.9 and 51.1 seconds, and an- chored the winning mile relay. However his efforts were strong- ly back~d up by the improved showing of Sophomore Joe Scho- enfelt, who placed second only to Lustig in the 220 and 440, had an excellent sub 52 second quarter in the mile relay. An unexpected strong showing in the field events proved to .be the winning margin, as the thm- rlads sweP.t the Hop, St:P• anrl Jump, and placed men m first place positions in the Broad Jump Shot Put, and Discus.

Nominated for the honor by their coaches are John Morrison for track, John Rowell for tennis, and John Hann for lacrosse. The baseball nominee has not been named yet as Art Lawrence is out of town with the . team.

This is the first year that the Athlete of the Month elections have been run. So far they have been a successful venture. Former Athletes of the Month include Toby Lustig, John Soper, Terry Dutton, and Paul Shields. Netmen By Overwhelmed Syracuse Squad During a very disappointing week in which the Garnet played without first man, Ckorge Masters, the Beaudry coached netmen dropped three straight matches. On Wed- nesday the Union team was host to a much stronger Syra- cuse squad and lost the match 7-2. The loss of Masters because of a foot injury made it<!•>------------- necessary for each man to play up one rank. Peter Walker was the only successful Garnet player in the singles matches, defeating Dave Barrie of Syl'acuse, 4-6, 7-5, 8-6. In other singles action, Ray Didisheim, playing first man, lost to Steve Rubell 6-1, 6-3. The re- sults of the other matches were Katcher (S) over Rowell (U) 6-3, 6-2; Napper (S) over Lesser (U) 2-6, 6-0, 6-2; Davis (S) over Apter ( U) 6-3, 6-3; and Tayal (S) over Short ( U) 6-1, 6-2. In the doubles Horowitz and Unterberg teamed up to beat Tayal and Kahan 6-3 and 6-4 to add the other point to Union's score. In other doubles action, Katcher and Davis (S) defeated Didisheim and Rowell (U) 6-3, • 6-4; and Rubel! and Napper (S) defeated Apter and Lesser (U) 7-5. 6-2.

The Garnet Garnet Nine Split; Face Clarkson Next Next Tuesday the Garnet nine takes to the highways as they travel to Potsdam to face the Clarkson CoHege of Technology. This will be the eleventh game with the up- state engineers for the Dutchmen since 1922, with each squad boasting five successes. Because of the mileage in- volved, this will probably be the last time Union faces a Clarkson squad. The Dutchmen will be anxious to avenge last year's 4-1 defeat, while capturing the rubber game of the series for head coach Art Lawrence. Action during the past week~·~----­ saw Union triumph over Norwich University 4-2, and falter 4-0 be- fore Middlebury on theii· first ex- tended road trip. In the first con- test burly rig h than de r Rick Crookes handcuffed the Norwich cadets on six hits whil.e fanning eleven in his second completed game of the cunent campaign. The 6'2\ 200 pound fonner Nis- kayuna ace now boast::; two vic- tories against one setback. Fike Triples Crookes set the pace in the ccn test as he began a Galllet rail~ with two down in the top uf thl fourth. He walked and seconC: sacker Bruce Fike connected with the fkst pitch unleashing a vicious slice down the right fieid line fm three bases. Art Marshall prompt- ly responded with a broken bat safety up the middle pushing Fike across. The Garnet defense slacked in the bottom half of the inning, however, to yield an unearned Norwich counter. Crookes Homers Then with the score tied in the top of the sixth, Crookes again aided his own cause as he lifted a to,Yering belt into the centerfield bleachers and casually lumbered home with the first round tripper for the Lawrencemen this season. Fike again followed with a safety this time ending up at the key- stone sack. Marshall reached sec- ond after an error and some heads up baserunning, while Fike moved to third setting the stage for cen- terfielder and captain Larry Mc- Cray's sacrifice fly to deep center. The bulky Garnet hurler was in control the rest of the way to register the squad's third win. D' Allaird Debut to date lacked the punch it has the potential to give, and the Mid- dlebury contest was an unfortun- ate example. The Garnet gath- ered only four scattered bingles and were unable to promote a rally although a few walks, and miscues presented occasional op- portunities for such. Fike, Marshall, Lal'l'Y McDon- ::tld, and Gary Brown are the top hitters for the diamondmen so far with the first the top slugger with two triples and a double. Brown, shortstop and pitchet· (one win, one loss), also boasts two tl'iples. McDonald, who handles the hot corner has been the most consist- ant sticker with safeties in all but one contest. The Futur~ Five more games remain on the Garnet schedule. After the Clark- son trip, the Dutchmen will travel to New York City for games with Stevens Institute of Technology, and Drew University. They will play a return game with Hamil- ton on Alexander Field on May 13, to close out their home sched- ule, and will be at Rochester for the season finale on May 15. * * ... * So far the squad lms had ex- ceptional luck with the weather; only two rainouts so far. The Wil- ' Iiams game, however, was rainerl out, for the third yea1· in a row- shades of the New York Yankee~. If the latter are lucky they may get a game in by the end of next week.

In the controYersial rushing referendum the student body favored the de- fened rushing system by a mar· gin of ·17 votes out of G95 cast. Although the number of La!- . lots cast by fratemity men was very few, there was a three to two majol'ity for immediate rush. The freshmen, of whom a surpris- ing 75'/r cast ballots, favored de- ferred rushing by greater than a two to one margin. The upper- class independents in a ve1·y poor turnout were better than five to one in favor of deferred rushing. The new president, Mr. Fazio, expressed his opinions on the ref- erendum issue.

Frater- nity or dormitory bull sessions or a casual glance at the Concordy will offer enough proof to anyone who doubts the truth of this statement. Discontent in itself is not all bad, for it shows that most of us ca1·e about the improvement of the college or at least the aspects of it with which we come in contact. Frustration, how- ever, is a negative outgrowth of continual discontent with life at the college and is too often expressed by all segments of our community. Our frustrations cause us all, faculty, administration, and students, to point the finger of guilt at each other and eventu- ally., after all else fails, at the Board of Trustees • I offer no panacea to break out of the vicious circle of cu·ping criticism at Union, but I do suggest that we students do the best job we can running our a1·ea of the college, formulating and pre- senting our most urgent goals. After three years of service on the Student Council, no one is more aware than I am of the rela- tive limitations of student government. Only certain, well-defined areas of college life are under our jurisdiction, but if we intelli- gently decide on what are our most vital needs and if we maturely present them to the Faculty, Alumni, and Trustees, we have a good chance of at least having our ideas included in the delibera- tions of these policy-making bodies. Our proposals and ideas must be delivered to these men in a manner which will earn personal presentatio';l of student opinion to these gentlemen by the older, more expel'lenced student leaders t9 be of utmost importance. Let student petitions and Conco1·dy editorials form a background for the quiet but firm lobbying of the student government. There are a number of issues that next year's council should definitely meet. Some of them al'e totally student affairs and (Continued on Page 4) Mr. Fazio entertains quite an avid interest in the construction of a Students Activities Center.

Folk Music Groups Headline Weekend Stern Prof. Here Sunday For the first time in U11ion College's history, a member of the American Communist Party will speak on campus. Dr. Her- bert Aptheker, national director of the American Institute of Marxist Studies, is appearing un- der the auspices of the Union College Intemational Relations Club. Dr. Aptheker's subject is \American Foreign Policy: A Marxist Analysis.\ He will speak and conduct a question and an- :;>wer period in Nott Memorial Theater at 8:00 on the evening of May 8. If the audience is too large, the lecture will take place in Memorial Chapel. After the leceture, Kappa Alpha will hold an informal reception. Contributors Sought Rabbi Jacob Rabinowitz will speak on \Judaism and the Sci- ences\ this .Sunday night, May 10, in Memorial Chapel at 8:0() p.m. Rabinowitz is a member of the faculty at Stern College for Wom- en and the Jewish Studies Pro- gram at Yeshiva College. . He was ordained .at Yeshiva University in 1948, two years af- ter he had received his Bachel- or's Degree from the same school Since 1948 he has earned a Mas~ ter's Degree from the Polytechnic School of Brooklyn and is cur- rently completing the require- ments for his doctorate. Trustees Approve Doug LaBier, president of the International Relations Club, stated that the IRC obtained ap- proval of their ventl.U'e from the Board of Trustees. The Board stipulated that knowledge of Dr. Aptheker's visit be confined to the students and faculty of Un- ion in order that publicity-seek- ing extremists be prevented from interfering with the lecture. Both the Board of Trustees and the International Relations Club feel that the presence of a Communist speaker on campus will be a worthwhile educational experi- ence. They felt that the exposure of both students and faculty has been limited, and hoped that the affair would proceed w.ith dig- nity. Banned In Buffalo Parker explained that it is the 11ractice of the Admissions De- partment to seek out students who will not only benefit from attending Union, but who will also contribute to the college com- mqnity. For this reason, dull straight A students are often passed up in favor of the stu- dent who does most with his abil- ity curricularly and extra-curri- ru'arly. Those students who achieve six hundreds in their col- lege boards, but fail to live up to their ability, usua!1y fail to contribute when they relach col- lege also. Since a school is only a community of its students, it is imperative that those who make up the community want to and can contribute.

The Best Man By Paul Sherwin The screen adaptation of Gore Vidal's pl~y, \f'he Best M~n,\ is a razzle-dazzle attempt to portray the shad1er. Sid~ of Amen~a·n political morality. The film centers ar?und a l}Omn~atmg c<?nventlon in which the two leadi11g contenders for presidentml candidacy, an egg-headish irlealist and a ruthless, fist-throwing whiz from back home on the venerable and politically c01wenient farm, clash in a frenzied campaign. The Good Guy, William Russell, played rather convincingly by Henry Fonda, is thrust into :'l sitl!at!on which forces him t~ deci.de whether he should stick to h1s prmciples or step over the line dic- tated by his conscience and make the expedient. move. This inner conflict represents the focal point of the movie's action and purpose.

American Political Morality It becomes known to the viewer that the man nominated will probably become the next President of the United States. The r~aliz­ ation of this fact adds a note of horror to the film, since aH: the shifty maneuvering and meaningless hullaballoo of the campaign are completely believable. The opening scene depicts the usual 'hys- terics that follow the nomination of a presidential candidate in our country. It is a spontaneous demonstration illustrating the honest and well-considered opinions of the convention delegates. It is a 22-minute spontaneous demonstration. One of the crucial episodes of the movie occurs at a banquet during which the retiring president, played by Lee Tracy, is expected to announce his choice for the nomination. It struck this reviewer that such a vital moment in American life seemed more like an Academy Awards Ceremony. These poignant glimpses into the making of history are very effect- ively handled by Director Franklin Schaffner and mark the high points of \The Best Man.\ Acting Performances Varied Margaret Leighton, appearing as the wife of Good Guy, gives an excellent performance. Her husband has had a lot of problems, rang·ing from a mental breakdown to some extra-marital sex play. Miss Leighton's ·sensitive portrayal of the wounded, but still loyal wife, as well as being a fine piece of acting, is sure to warm the hearts of all mothers. Other figures who appear in the movie are Edie Adams, who plays the voluptuous, unscrupulous wife of Joe Cantwell; Ann Sothern, featured as a calculating female politician who is railed \the only known link between the NAACP and the Klu Klux Klan\; Kevin McCarthy, cast as the hard-fighting cam- paign manager of Russell who is constantly throwing darts at a picture of his candidate's opponent; and Shelley Berman. Berman plays the role of a schlep of a man who possesses cer- tain information about the personal life of Joe Cantwell that would ruin his political career. Having bended to the pleas of his not-so- idealistic constituents, William Russell decides to face his rival with Berman and his dirt. In a scene that should have reflected the ten- sion of the moment and the importance of the situation with regard to the movie, artistry is abandoned to the winds and a gigantic fail- ure sticks its rotten claws into the heart of \The Best Man.\ In short, romedien Shelly Berman's attempt at acting is utte1·ly atro- ciouR. Lack of Vitality In g·eneral, the movie is slow moving and often unnecessarily dull. The dit,ector has failed to inject the vitality of his subject onto the sci·een and the techniques employed are too often uneffective cliches. The characters fit into typical classes and are for the most part quite flat. What \The Best Man\ lacks most is the finesse that goes into the making of a truly outstanding piece of art. At best, it would make a good hour-long television drama. Regardle~s of the film's short comings, its exposition of political double-dealing is reasonable, and especially appropriate in this elec- tion year. It is very important that we should be well acquainted with this unfortunate, often sordid aspect of Americana. The movie raises the question of whether it is possible for the \best man\ to become President in our land of lihet·ty. Yet, by the conclusion of \The Best Man,'' who cares? ¥¥¥¥i'¥TY'f¥'i''t't'fi'YYTTfft+Yfi'Y¥YT'¥Y'f'Tt'Y'ti'Yf¥f9ffW UNION INN Skidmore-Union Orchestra in concert. Friday, May 8 1 1964 0/ting Speaks: Our Only Prayer Translated by Rodham E. Tulloss Bev. Olting is a famous Yeminite evangelist and world~ renowned bassoon. He is best known for his recitations of the E Pluribus over the BBC. The following is a reprint of the speech he gave on Feb. 30, 1963 at Buckle Hall, Bible Belt University. It was translated by Mr. TuUoss. Julius Caesar, long and absolutely lamented as originator of world dominion, vast conquest, and pastrami, is also deserving of in- comprehensibly blatant credit for being if not the originator, then the cause of Hallowe'en. Hallowe'en, long entrenched in Anglo-Saxon society was originally introduced to England by the conquering armies of Rome. Under their famous banner, SPQR (Slatterimbus Porifii. , Quinblatta Rimgiob), they brought steam baths, order, the ever-pres- -----------------------------· ent, Roman pastrami, and two words-Holofernes anc'------ Union Music Groups Entertain Parents Holofernes was the vaulted Julius Caesar's niclmame; and, ac- cording to Armenides of Skwatt, it had come into general use as a name applied to any conquering geneml with a head on his shoulders. The name Holofernes should be familiar to art lovers from the famous work of Medelinsi, the Elder, of Scarbasi-\Amelia with the Head of Holofernes\-which was recently in the news as suggested wrapping material for the \Pieta.\ At any rate, we can imagine the mighty Caesar meeting Armenides at the gates of Skwatt. The evening sky, red with conquest, ~ontains only a few gigantic thunderheads that float like plaster of paris errata through the firmament. The only creature that stirs is a lone Canis fraternitatis that floats by on By Paul Livingston During the past weeks Concor- 1 diensis carried reviews of this I semester's achievements by both the Skidmore-Union Orchestra and the Union College Glee Club, These .columns, which served to preview the Parent's Weel,end Concert, asserted that the orches- tra was struggling desperately to avoid dissolution, and that the Glee Club was basking in the fine reputation it had established for itself during the year. The author of these columns, Mr. Rob- ert S. Hoffman, after bemoaning the plight of an orchestra which had to scrap most of its music and employ professional musi- cians, concluded his analysis by calling for more support for the orchestra, and by offering strong praise for the Glee Club. It had been said that the or- chestra was a weak and motley ~oncoction of amateur musicians whose slight powers were rapid- ly failing. Yet in the very concert that could have marked the or- chestra's dissipation we saw the first signs of a really promising future. Long Program The program which the Union College Department of Music had planned for Parent's weekend was most ambitious. Divided into three sections, it gave everyone a chance to perform, and virtually assured a packed house of par- ents. The drawback of this sort of thing, which involved four changes of the stage settings to accommodate the six performing groups, is the creation of an ex- tremely hectic mood. The two- and-one-half-hour program seemed to last for at least two days and at times the stage changings, in- volving glee clubs entering, or- chestra leaving, and chairs, music stands, and lights being moved, tended to resemble a combination of a surTealistic \happening\ and a Hollywood spectacular. In this case, however, the advantages seemed to outweigh the some- what unmusical distractions of the disadvantages, as the evening of music was of an interesting and surprisingly high calibre. Impressive Sound Our p e r so n a I \moment of truth\ came in the middle of the orchestra's portion of the pro- gram. Complete with ragged in- tonation and one professional \ringer\ for each two real or- chestra members, the group play- ed through a Handel Sarabande, a Moussorgsky Cossack Dance, and an excerpt from Wagner's Parsifal. Though the results were far from perfect and the program selections were of a rather high- schoolish nature, the sound of the m·chestra was surprisingly impressive. In its performance on Saturday evening we saw exhi- bited the first seeds of musical competence, we first realized that the Union-Skidmore Orchestra was at last something to be tak- en seriously and we finally heard it play music which was tolerable, motionless wings. But enough romanticism. , ______ was a crude reference to Julius' birth by Caesarian section. We have this on the authority of the famed French Medieval- is,t De Gorbeville Schleppe. And, by means of metalingual adsor- phrasia, they became Hallowe'en, celebrated-though this is not gen- eral knowledge-on the anniversary of Julius Caesar's Bar Mitzvah. We find in a undated, Roman manuscript of admittedly poor condition: \And it was found (on that night) that he was (not?) ___ _ -- and a great cry arose among the citizenry (or people), as of a group of mourners.

If he had but more blatantly rather, they exclaimed slowly and in brilliant despair, as a dolphin dies on a dock.

Since its inception this column has had as its purpose the noble motive of uplift of both faculty and students 1 • The faculty has been convinced for years that students mostly do nothing 2 • And as any- thing worth doing is worth doing well, I commend to your needs the· art of angling. Angling, said lzaak Walton, is the contemplative man's recrea- tion, and, according to Herbert Hoover, one fishes in order to wash· one's soul. In addition to the benefits just mentioned any member of the Union College community who fishes is entitled to membership in the SPEGPPJD·q. A distinction is to be drawn between angling and just fishing. Angling is active 1 , eng•aging the participant in the healthy physical and mental exercises of wading a rushing stream 5 and outwitting the wily trout\. Just fishing is sedentary, seducing the sitter into the sin of soa]j:ing worms instead of souls. There are few locations more suitable to the angling student than Schenectady. One cannot go to Skidmore without crossing Kay- aderossera:s Creek. Between here and Smith lies the Kinderhook. Within 35 minutes of Vassar flows the Esopus7. Students can enter this sport more readily than many others, already being partial masters of angling-angling for grades, angling for dates and knowing all the angles 8 • A word about the trout: Trout come in three kinds, have spots and always lie facing upstream 9 • They feed on mayflies, damselflies, stoneflies, dragonflies, caddis flies, dry flies, worms and pieces of chee~e. This diet induces an experimental frame of mind 10 and leads some trout to eat nickel-plated spoons. The first book about trout fishing was written by an English nun. Why, then, do not more Union students engage in this construc- tive activity? 1 'l'lu .. aliminbttl•a.tion (:ould tHit\ a. homd too. but dif.t<'l't\tion seals nty llns. :.! 'rhls would not bf!'

Liberalized Hours 1...------------------· Foreign View: Metamorphosis By Raymond Okaf(lr Our years in the United States are for us years of hectic flux when the only constant is, as the ad says, change. Continuous re- evaluation and reorientation become our lot and our only means of maintaining psychological cohesion. One never really knows what sort of new being will emerge from this psychological metamorphosis but one always hopes it will be an individual with complete mental and intellectual eql:lilibrium. Challenge To Concepts America's industrial might makes us much more conscious of the great inadequacy of our own. The highly seculal'ized and some- times uncharitable American version of Christianity challenges to the ver;l': roots our former c!lncepts of that religion. Christianity seems to b'e an all too embracing term for a whole variety of beliefs and non-beliefs that often have nothing in common with each other. And on a more mundane level, the American boy-gil'l relationship based on a de-mystification and masculinization of woman calls for adjust- ment of some thought proceosses. The perennial determination of the girls to outboy the boys - blue jeans, dirty sneakers and all - defies the imagination. Talking about girls reminds me of one of the very early experi- ences I had in this country which had such a profound impact on me. One day I happened to overhear the mother of the house in which I was staying for one month before coming on to Union, telling her husband that some girls were coming to see us that evening. Obvi- ously I was happy for no healthy young man would pass over such an opportunity of enjoying the company of young ladies. But when the girls did arrive, you could have knocked me down with a feather. The youngest of the ''girls\ was at least sixty years old! That's America. Our sojoum in this country makes us more aware of our African- ness. Back home, we identified our selves, because of the contents of our education, more or less strongly with British antecedents and did not feel too uncomfortable when taught in school how \we\ over- came the Spanish Armada in 1588, or how bravely \we\ stood all alone against Htiler. American race relations takes care of that. Loss of Emotionalism The necessity for continuous adjustment creates tolerance. We lose the emotionalism associated with the anti's-: anti-colonialism, anti-imperialism, etc. - and to come to view the racial question dis- passionately. Capitalism which bears so much odium under our home environment of European economic imperialism begins to gain our respect under the American system of free-enterprise based on en- lightened self-interest and not blatant exploitation. The degree of this of course varies among us, but the tendency is perhaps inevitable because we make many Amel'ican friends (strangely enough, more among whites than Negroes), and these personal bonds necessarily influence our attitudes. New Exaggeration Our conception of ourselves undergoes probably the most pro- found change. Citizens of a countt·y in which there are only a few thousand college students and five universities, we come with exag- gerated ideas of our educational attainments but the awesome pres- ence of more than four million college students and hundreds of uni- versities cut us down to size. We arrive priding ourselves about om· broadmindedness and broadness of vision but these too are early mortalities. A new exaggeration is probably taking their place (or persisting from earlier exaggerations), which is that we have all the answers to Africa's enormous problems of hunger, ignorance, and disease, but this is common to students everywhere if not in the United States. P1·o-Americanism An American friend of mine in New York once told me that he has observed that \in the first six months, Nigerian students in this country are confused; in the following nine months anti-American; but by the end of the second year more or less pro-American,\ which is a rough and ready way of stating a recognizably correct position. The \second year pro-Americanism\ is of course not necessarily a pro-ness to the United States but a reconstruction of value systems with large borrowings from the spirit of the Founding Fathers. It is a recognition of the fact that when we go back home we will bear the burden of defending the American system from the attacks of the hostile and uninformed who have not had the opportunity of liv- ing under it. Most important of all, our education and experience here will be judged by how well they equip us in serving our Motherland, where our primary challenges lie at this time.

Ruhscrlptlon ).tanager Faculty Load One of the main advantages of a school like Union College is that it boasts a highly competent and well-quali- fied teaching faculty. The school publicizes the fact that the student-faculty ratio is in the neighborhood of 10:1 and that students are almost always taught by men who have obtained their doctral degree. Student-teacher contact is as close as one could desire in any academic institution. In short, it is the quality of the faculty and their con- stant availability to students that are responsible for any reputation that Union College might possess in educational circles. This is why we are most alarmed when we think that our most important asset is being weakened. By and large faculty salaries here are quite reasonable; (but in the future reasonable may not be enough if Union is to com- pete with the State Universities for faculty.) Faculty teach- ing loads are another matter, however. These are becom- ing excessive in almost all areas of the college, making job offers from other schools look that much more attractive. It is impractical for the college to contemplate an in- crease in the number of students without allowing for a comparable increase in the number of faculty members. The situation is more serious in some departments than in others. Biology is an outstanding example. While the student-course enrollment is up 11.1% in the past six years throughout the college, in the Biology Department it is up 63% for the same period. At present, the Biology staff is teaching 15 hours a week, with recitation and lec- ture sections containing far above the optimal number of students. It must be remembered that there is nothing holding faculty members to the campus. When a school such as Williams can offer a teaching load of nine hours a week, one can be sure that any offers would be jumped at. It is extremely hard, as our experience with the Math Department has shown, to find adequate replacements for top~notch faculty men. We have lost an unusually high number of men this past year. In the next ten years there will be a steady stream of retiring professors. Where will comparable replacements be found? What can this school offer to qualified men in order to attract them to come here? The present difficulties in obtaining faculty members with doctorates proves that we haven't found a suitable answer to these questions. There were hopes that the problem of faculty load might be worked out and the solution incorporated in the new calendar - but the prospects for any calendar change now seem most remote. This problem is by far the most serious one that Pres- ident Davidson faces. He is losing men (one way or an- other) and is having difficulty in attracting suitable re- placements because he has little to offer them. We suggest that Mr. Stephen Holbrook, Union's new Director of Development, concentrate his initial efforts upon the establishment of a fund which will provide for new faculty positions. The Referendum The referendum vote is in and the results, though far from overwhelming, showed that a \reasonable dqubt\ does exist on the part of the majority of students con- cerning the immediate rushing system. Time is running out. We would lil\e to see the IFC reconsider the matter on its own before it is overruled from above. What about it, Mr. Prigmore? WE:E.KE~J) f • Letters to the Editor (Continued from Page 1) others will be met in cooperation with groups on campus. They add up to a busy year for a council which is aware of the problems of every segment of student opinion. In our most important area of academic affairs, I would hope to see the council make every effort to aid the newly-formed faculty committee on curriculum. Ques- tions of course structure, gradua- tion and major requirements and calendat· revision are central to the lives of Union students and the opinion of those of us most interested should be heard. ence at Student Conferences tells me that we have something- to gain in mutual discussion and we have much to suggest to others. Local and regional associations with schools with which we have much in common are far superior to the NSA, essentially a political interest group out of tourh with small Eastern colleges. Jazz Notes: Plastic Sax It wHl probably shock some people to learn that Ornette Cole- man is more than a year older than Phil Woods:, and more than six months older than Clifford Brown would be if he were still alive •. Most people think of Cole- man as an upstart, a yotmg kid who doesn't know what he's do· ing. The fact is that he's thirty- four years old and has a very good idea of what he's doing . \So what is he doing?'\ you ask. First I'll tell you what he's not doing . First, he's not playing out of tune. Second, he's not just \playing h i s fingers.\ Third, he's not des- troying jazz as we know it . most important, he's not putting eyerybody on. He is bringing to jazz the bene- fits of a fresh approach conceiv- ed by an admittedly somewhat untrained but very musical mind . He plays tonally; at times the key is somewhat obscured but there is never a question of no tonic existing within a given piece. He plays melodically but not with a preset harmonic pat- tern. None of this seems very controversial and indeed it should not be, for although some of these devices are new to jazz, they have been used regularly in other music for many years. Although Coleman's music is unusual,. it is not forbidding. Any- one with an open ear and inter- est enough to give it a serious hearing can easily understand it. Ornette has recorded eight LPs so far. Two are on the Contem- porary label and six on Atlantic. Of tht> lot, I find \Change of the By Thomas Rrehbiel J. Lawton Century\ (Atlantic 1327) the one which would appeal most to one Bailey ( who wishes to be introduced to · ze Day, Ma Omette's music. : bachelor of a: On the \Change of the Cen- tury\ sides Coleman is joined by Don Cherry (not the singer) playing pocket trumpet, Charlie Haden playing bass, and Billy Higgins on drums. Cherry has a good grasp of Coleman's con- ceptions but is outshone by the accompaniment of Haden and Higgins. Haden gets a real \coun- try\ sound, playing melodic bass lines which complement and drive the soloists to a high degree. Higgins is one of the most in- ventive and melodic (if such a word can be used) drummers playing today. He can shift tem- pos and play freely around the rhythm while maintaining the basic movement of a jazz beat. The Georg raduating sen most prom This p \l\\\'''a Baker. '\Vll'-U-«'\' C.

On some of Coleman's later records Ed Blackwell and Scott LaFaro replace Higgins and Had- en respectively. LaFaro is, or rather was until his death in an ' auto accident, a very fast bassist. He played extensively in the up- per register of the instrument and added an almost guitar-like voice to the group at times. He thought more harmonically than Haden does but could hardly be (Continued on Page 5) In the Sc ing people: Richard E Schol: There is no sound reason why a scholat·-in-residence plan cannot be implemented at Union. The student council should certainly make every effort to take this plan out of the discussion stage and put it into operation. Other areas of student life need attention from next year's council.

I would support continued temporary student sup- port for our improving Ski Team through student tax funds, and continued supervision for the ~heerleaders and Block-U Society m an effort to aid athletics at MacCc March toner, James Also, in the realm of academic and cultural affairs, I would hope that the council might be able to improve the relations between foreign students and the college_ We need more students of vary- ing· backgrounds (not just West- ern Europeans), and we as stu- dents need to make use of this mutual opportunity to learn each other's culture. Working, in con- junction with the IFC, I believe we students can solve oome parts of this problem. · I believe we at Union have a civic function which could be aided by the Student Council. One of the college's greatest lacks is in the ana of student participation in the controversial problems of our times. Realizing that the Stu- dent Council is not the place to- discut'ls matters that don't relate to the students (a careful review of this year's minutes will show that the Council did not do this) and that we are not and will not be a Swarthmore or an Obel'iin I definitely believe that we may attempt to carefully nurture and support (not financially, however) the growth of social, political, and econorni_c interest gro\.!ps of all persuastons represented on ram- pus. Let us all accept the chal- leng-e Professor Allen stated so well in a past Concordiensis and expand our interests as much as time will allow beyond our own selfish persuits.

My experi- Concert • • (Continued from page 2) that), and a wonderfully serious and moving Faure Requiem. Excellent Accompaniment The Requiem is a heavily 1'0- mantic work which is both excit- ing and profound. The women from Marymount seemed perfect- ly matched to our group, and their overall presentation, with the aid of Mr. Mills, a very fine organist, and the small group of professional string players, could not have been better. The clear solo voice of Michael Baker, outgoing President of the Glee Club, was most appropriate for the work, and the direction of Professor Hugh Allen Wilson to the singers was firm and se- cure, though apparently confus- ing to the unfamiliar string play- ers, who responded somewhat tentatively at times. The choruses sang like little bands of angels, and the result was a half hour of truly beautiful music. Union. The expansion and improvement of the campus and plant will be taking place quickly during the next decade. I hope that the school will continue to accept the suggestions of students as to the design and use of these buildings. I pledge to keep the council fully a.ware of the proposed construc- tiOn so that we mav voire our suggestions. I believe that the Student Council should sti'Ongly express its interest in a Student ~enter. A large and inrre:rsingly Important segment of the campus, th~ independents, need this g-ath- e~·mg place to provide a basic so- cial outlet. The campus as a who[p would benefit from this f:tcilitv which is standard equipment ;;t most schools of Union's size rom- pnsition, and standards. ' Finally in the area of social life, I would support a mature and well-documented revision of some of the ~mrial 1·ules. The social reg- ulations along with dormitory housing are the basic determin- :·ntR of student morale. I would hope that the Trustees would ac- ct>pt the tenets of a contempor- a? .code for young gentlemen. It s time we make fraternity social rules confo~·m to reality and give non-fr~termty men an equal op- portumty to build a social life.

Role For l\fusic After this mammoth Parent's Weekend performance we can only look with amazement to the advances which have been gain- ed. on our inherently un-musically oriented campus. The only dan- ger left to us is to regard these presences at Union -of both a rapidly developing orchestra and a superb chorus as mere phenom- ena, not to be encouraged by such means as personal, and perhaps more important, financiai sup- port. These gains have only been achieved at great individual ex- pense; it is certainly time that some of the burden be lifted by the real recognition of music as an important part of Union Col- lege. ,._..EWEST LU,_..CH 71.5 Albany Street Specializing: - HOT DOGS WITH FAMOUS SAUCE - DINNERS AND SANDWICHES - TAKE-OUT ORDERS - Union Students Favorite Spot - (Serving Schenectady Since 1921 ) Open 7 Days Per Week 6 A.M. - 4:00 A.M. includes resourceful seersucker planning The lightweight ease and good behavior of the 65% Dacron• polyester, 35% cotton seersucker jacket ... evel'Y line a social asset ... tailored with ease and aplomb, with the greatest natu- ral shoulder in America.

Founded at the University of Colorado, the Sing- ers were discovered at the Bitter End in New York City. Since then their popularity has risen greatly, afte:r fr~quent appear· ances on television's \Hooten· anny\ and with their recent hit song, \A Crooked Little Man.\ 1 dall proposed modifications to i this system to establish a period Won by Sent' or of open contact for the entire . . first semester and pledging dur- ing the early part of the second · semester. The ten-day no contact .,. period at the beginning of the . first semester would be retained. However this was one of the few rules whlch would be carried over. Under the new system, which was passed unanimously by the body, there will be unlimited contact anywhere and at any time after the initial ten-day no contact period. No fraternity men wi1l be permitted in t~e dormitorie~ un- til after pledgmf!:. There w1ll be no two-week dorm rush, as there was under the old deferred sys- tem. With a completely open rush there is no need for this two- week per1od. Freshmen may go to fraternity houses at any time and for arty meals or parties they wish, during the first semester. Natural Contact The Institute of Electronic and Ele::trical Engineers student branch sponsored a prize paper :ontest with R.P.I. Tuesday night, May 12. The first prize of $30 was won by Matthew C. Intrieri, a Union senior, for his paper, 'Neon Glow Discharge Tubes as Circuit Elements.\ Three profes- s'onal engineers from the Capital District judged the competition .. The contestants were judged both on the oral presentation and TI\J a written paper submitted to the judges before the contest. Mr. William Elliot, Student Af- fain; Chairman of the Schenec- tady I.E.E.E. section, in prese~t­ ing the prizes, pt·aised the quahty of all the papers submitted.

I shall leave them there for now. But the Division attracts Ja.rge numbers of students, for reasons which are known only to them, perhaps. In a .serious vein, this should be a matter of concern. We have already reached the period in several departments where the teaching resources are not adequate to enrollments. In terms of personnel, the Division has suffered g1·evious losses, and can, at the same time, announce important additions to its faculty. In May of last year, on the eve of his retirement, Professor Bennett died; and only a few weeks la.tcr he was followed by Professor Philip Stanley of the department of Philosophy. Of the present un- dergraduates, not all knew Bill Bennett, and none knew Phil Stanley. But these were men who, in different ways, contributed greatly to the life of Union College. We have also lost through resignation Professor James Riedel of the Department of Political Science. We regretfully note, in addition, the departure of Professor Keene in Poli- tical Science. But we can smely take much satisfaction in those who have joined the Faculty of Division II, or whose appointments for the coming year are now matters of record. Professor Jonas in History and Messrs Gnti and Unde1·wood in Political Science have already ·established themselves with colleagues and students. Coming next year is Dr. Joseph Board as Chairman of the latter department; and in Sociology the Department will come back to its present full status with the appointment of Professor Malcolm Wilson, a graduate of Swarthmore who is completing his doctorate at Cornell. Staffing a small college faculty in these days is not an easy matter. Indeed, it is about the most important administrative problem that we face. We feel confident that we shall continue to attract able, dedicated scholars and teachers. We must do so, in fact, if we are to maintain the high standard of undergl'aduate education. A most encouraging sign is the recent unmistakable upswing in the campus attitude toward Old Union. Student directed under- takings like Freshman orienta- tion and Parents' Day, responsi- ble editorship of the various pub- lications, successful Mountebanks nror!uctions and musical activi- ties, enthusiasm for athletic and social events, just to name a few -these all bespeak a resurgence of positive campus spirit. A more healthy respect is replacing the pseudo.sophisticated disparaging air that has been cultivated in some quarters. There exists no shortage of criticism, but by and large it has been constructive and justified. This healthy, virile attitude is contagious.

What I find so ludicrous in Aptheker's indignant outburst, is in both Nott Memorial and Kappa Alpha, pointed out many of the his unmatched record of distortion and villification; as seen in his weak areas of American foreign policy, particularly our large-scale writings and public utterances, much of which many students are support of dictators such as Franco, Batista, Gomez, Chiang-Kai un~ware: This of Sidney Hook, he said: \You and the ruling class Shek, Trujillo, Peron, Salazar, etc., and our apparent exploitation of which pays you, are with the Nazis frothing at th<> ''\outh to get these and other countries (paxticularly Latin America).

We cherish highly the freedom of speech, should be received and welcomed into their midst without anything but without the freedom to listen, without the freedom to be able but polite criticisms. to have an open mind when approaching such crucial themes, such central problems of life, without the freedom to have individual responses and individual thoughts, we are nothing. We are nothing if ·we relinquish our responsibility to provide an atmosphere untainted by bias, prejudice, and preconceived thoughts and responses wherein any idea may be critically expressed and critically listened to and evaluated. It is not that we should keep America anti-communist, but rather that we keep it positively democratic. This, to me, is the Professor Paul Kurtz greatest fear. Editor's Note: Because this is the last issue of Concordiensis Mr. Kurtz will not be able to reply to any direct attacks. Thus we have givep him this space to clarify his views. To the Editor of Concordiensis: The International Relations Club invited a member of the Am- The same yeai' Edwin Climzak, Second Secretary of the Polish Embassy, spoke here, once again under the auspices of the I. R. C. He was a member of the Communist Party of his country. We recall no special treatment for this speaker either. The public's reaction to Aptheker probably has something to do with the fact that he is a native American, ... \one of our own gone bad\ some might say. The reaction of those who were .anxious con- cerning Aptheker's arrival was tempered by consciousness of the fact that the coHege cannot act in a vacuum, and by the belief that it must act cautiously in the face of a suspicious and unknowledgable public. But it woutd seem that the college also has a responsibility to that public to which it is sensitive. Aptheker should have been treated as any ·other guest speaket· is treated on this campus. Such treatment might contribute t@ a moderation of public intolerance. We do not mean to unjustifiably criticize what was, in terms of inquiry and information, an obviously successful event. (Over twenty percent of the student body voluntarily attended and were most attentive .and respectful.) But neither do we want this event to be quickly forgotten. We hope the fear and anxiety which char- acterized the reaction of some of the faculty and administration will not prejudice further academic ventures of this sort. To the Editor of the Concordiensis: Michael A. Baker, '64 Alon Jeffrey, '65 Randall Oestreicher, '64 Everyone knows that Herbert Aptheker is a Communist. Those who are familiar with his public utterances ru·e aware of his con- sistent adherence to Party Doctrine, and of his frequent use of uncomplimentary, and even malicious characterizations of prominent men with whom he disagrees. Therefore he, like all lunatics and Communists, is a bad man, not to speak of an evasive liar. While he can probably be conceded demented sincerity, and while his pro- testations concerning his experiences in the war, (on America's side), his open stand, and his constant harassment at the hands of the \protectors\ of our \free\country may be, and probably are, true, he is most likely out of touch vl'ith reality. So, of course, are the equally misled Marxist intellectuals throughout the world, who, not having been nurtured on State Department declarations and the reliable assertions of American newspapers and the F.B.I. are un- aware of the many radios and conveniences we have brought to the world's backward areas. They don't realize that it is by keeping the monstrous Communists out through alliances with Fascists and murderers that we are enabled to keep the world \free' so Capitl- ism can bring radios and right wing governments all over. Not only that, they actually believe that Communism has done much good by deposing dictators with the help of popular suppmt. Of course, they forget that popular opinion is all misled by Communist lies, and they believe the silly statistics which show tha.t Red China is pro- gressing, and outstripping India, that the Cubans are better off now than under Batista, and that much of South America is being ex- ploited by, oh foolishness, American Imperialists. But, with the openmindedness characteristic of the American education which teaches people to think critically, we can reject the notion that Communism has made and still makes mistakes, but has also made strides, and has perhaps an enviable record in foreign policy as America. Booh on you Aptheker. Your mild critical analysis of our foreign policy must be false. Thank goodness we can get even by calling you names. Robert S.

The inevitable has happened, and as a result the I.F.C has been dealt a staggering blow which we feel has harmed its position on this campus to such an extent that it can never again be an effective organization. A dangerous precedent has been set. The faculty has overruled a branch of the student government. Yet we can find little fault with what the faculty council did. The faculty provides the continuity on a college campus, out- lasting, in most cases, the four year stay of the students. Thus if the students fall into traps that previous groups, in previous years, fell into, it is both proper and fitting for the faculty to end the cycle. This is especially true when the cycle interferes with the academic business of the campus. We pointed this out on three different occasions in this newspaper. The I.F.C. had time to reconsider (this in and of itself does not mean reversing) - yet it didn't. It took no notice of the student referendum. It took no action to forestall or make unnecessary the faculty council action of the past week, though it knew what the final re- sult would be. Through its stubbornness, the I.F;C. has lost the battle over rushing, and what is more important, has permanently damaged its organization. One might argue that the I.F.C. was weak and power- less even before the faculty council decision, and that the council simply took advantage of that fact. This may pres- ently be the case, but the only hope for building a strong I.F.C. - or any student organization - for the future depends upon skillful leadership that avoids the setting of precedents which negate the power of the organization. This leadership was lacking in this case, and the I.F.C. has been irreparably damaged. Thus, the Concordiensis urges the Student Council to consider dissolving the I.F.C. We feel that the only hope for effective student gov- ernment is to have one strong organization to oversee all matters of student life. There is no need to divide student government into Independent and Fraternity segments. We propose that most of the responsibilities of the I.F.C. be taken over by the Student Council. This would avoid such conflicts of interest in major matters between student gov- ernments as were caused by the deferred vs. immediate rushing issue. We realize that this would necessitate a reorganiza- tion of the Student Council's electoral process. Thus we propose that a \proportional representation\ system be instituted. This would mean that there would be one repre- sentative for a given number of students, with fraternities, independents, and freshmen electing a number of repre- sentatives commensurate with their population. This, it seems to us, would be a more equitable election system anyway. We welcome any other suggestions for a replacement for the I.F.C. But some substitute must be found-· the I.F.C. under the present circumstances has lost the con- fidence of its members. Some houses have already con- sidered (not reaiizing the illegality of the move) with- drawing from the I.F.C. This is an unhealthy situation and one that must be remedied. Letter to the Editor To the Editor of Concordiensis: Five weeks after the I.F.C. made its decision to l'eturn t0 im- mediate rushing, it was officiaHy reversed by legislation of the Faculty Council. To most fratern- ity men, it is regrettable that they will not be allowed to rush under the system they feel from experience is best for all con- cerned. Yet, ever more reg1~ettable is the way the reversal is enforced. The Faculty ·Council has taken over a new area of legislation. No longer can an official student organization legislate its normal business without fear that its action may fall into the vast area of \all matters that pertain to academic life of Union College.\ There has been no official com- munication between the F.C. and the I.F.C. There was no effort on the part of the F,C, to offici- ally urge the I.F.C. to reconsider its legislation and no attempt at B1ediation on a high level. There was just a straightforward or<ler to the Dean of Students to en- force a policy of no rushing first semester. The I.F.C. was completing its most successful year ever. Co- operation and constructive efforts in the worksho.ps, legislation in pledge and house academics to improve the system, an all fra- ternity index which surpassed the all mens index, and a judicial board to handle fraternity infrac- tions of b0th college and I.F.C. rules have all heen accomplish- ments of this year's Council. Fra- ternities have sought self-im- provement, and their reward is a dictum by the Faculty Council. It is my hope that a joint F~C. I.F.C. committee can be estab- lished next year to study the problems and effects of rushing at Union. The I.F.C. members and officers have had a mandate to act in the manner they have. Now that the issue has come to a close for this year, we can all sit down without the pressure of time and again with objectivity to resolve this deadlock. G. Daniel Prigmore '65 President of the I.F:c. Leary Satirizes Local Religion By Paul Livingston \He that sendeth a the hand of a fool message by when suddenly the stigmata ap- Cutteth off his own feet, and drinketh damage.\ Proverbs 26:7 Imagine for a moment that you are a young man named Paris Leary and you want to write a novel. You live in Schenectady (surprise: our home town) iu ~l little white house that was once owned by some unrenowned·, ob- scure Dutch settler in .the quaint and somewhat artsy-craftsy .;ac- tion of town known, affectionate- ly, as the stockade. You are some- thing of a curate in the local Episcopal Church, not too con- vinced about God and all that, but absolutely certain in the convic- tion of undying hatred for your elderly superior, pretender to High Church Anglican prie&t- hood, a man who is \charming attractive to women, sauve, and social,\ and also vain, overbear- ing, selfish, and a few other nasty things (maybe even impotent). So you write your novel, hoping that it doesn't begin to sound nasty, and you try to keep your charac- ters from becoming cat·icatures. Admittedly the prospect is far from cheerful, yet the real ex-cur- ate, Father Leary, has done just that, and with the aid of a com- bination of judicious restraini and extreme effort, and with the addition of a ee·i'tain native writ- ing ability and sense of humour, has still managed to seem cleve1·, witty, and even, at times, a pret- ty funny writer. The Innocent Curate, Paris Leary's first book, is set in \The imaginary town of Shinderhook in upstate New York. The popu- lation is comprised of wealthy de- scendants of the old Dutch set- tlers, faculty of the local college, and employees of one of the. country's largest electrical com- panies.\ The satire works on two levels. Supposedly, Paris Leary is writing an expose of the religious world, laying bare its petty vani- ties and cxp()sing ~ its glaring faults. Actually, The Innocent Curate works far more effective- ly, both as pure humour and as personal and institutional satin;, when it is being a novel about Schenectady, about a particular white church on lower Union Street, and about a particular few people whom he deseribes in great detail. Actual Schenectady people, oi' parts of people, are easy to recog- nize in these descriptions. There is Oakes Broussard, \an instruc- tor of English Literature and a writer. Born a Southerner, with all his charm still intact, he is in fact completely cosmopolitan ... \ or the Reverend Dr. Groby, the priest at St. Clements, whose \greatest interest in life before God or his parish is to become a bishop.\ The institutional refer- ences are also easy: National Electric, Federal College, the Up- per Club, and the Indian Statue in the stockade. It feels strange, reading about a towr1 in which you've been living for· a few years, and this is where the book is most pleasurable, for as a re- ligious satire The Innocent CUl·ate fails miserably. The fault lies with the story, and with the very nature of the satire. Briefly, the young curate of St. Clements, Sonny Eall, a man who is very lacking in intelli- gence, but who has everything else, youth, beauty, popularity, and a fiancee who went to Ober· lin, is carrying a tray of cocktails pear on his body. This, fortun- ately, happens toward the latter hdf of the book, for after the miraculous occurrence everything; falls apart. Father Groby sees his hopes of beeorning the Bishop of something slowly bleeding away with the expected publicity. Colonel A u g u s t B r o c k, the church's professional fund-raiser, finds in Sonny's five little holes a chance to found a new religion and make lots of m()ney. Mrs. 0. Felix Cooper, the very rich ma- tron who wears plastic slippers, turbans, and dirndles and who owns a monastery and the largest collection of religious relics out- side of Europe, and Oakes Brous- sard, the voice of logic and sanitv join the others in speaking to Sonny with equal insistence re- garding what he must do about his Holy Message. Father Groby wants to keep Sonny's stigmata a sen·et, Colonel Brock asks him to realize his ob- ligation to God and to Humanity and embark immediately on a cru- sade, while Mrs. 0. Felix Cooper asks Sonny to install himself in a cell in her monastery. Oakes Broussard, of course, manages to solve the whole gory mess and have Sonny live happily, etc., etc. The satiric characterizations are good up to a point. The com- binations of the sad and the ugly with the funny and the silly ele- ments which make up the people who walk daily down Lower Fed- eral Street and into the rectory at St. Clements are artfully d<'- signed and described. The auth- or's eye is excellent, and he has a way of making a person seem utterly ridiculous and totally be- lievable at the same time. A sen- timental, soppy flashback into the past of the only really sym- pathetically handled character, Oakes Broussard, is actually han- dled quite sensitively. About half-way through the now! the description of people and the narration of their back- grounds suddenly stops, and thP plot of the story be girts. It is as if Mr. Leary had decided that his characters and satire must fin- ally take action. Yet it doesn't quite come off, for at this point the cleverness and funny bits of writing at:e not enough to hold up the st<;>ry line, one which is muddled about with for a while and then dropped perfunctorily. The ending comes as something of a shock, for we expect better. There is no doubt but that The Innocent Curate is a fascinating little book. For three or four hours reading one is taken by glimpses of things both familiar and humorous, into the lives of people both known and imagined, and into the quick and vaguely bitter mind of Paris Leary. At the beginning everything works. The dialogue fits mcely with the characters and the characters seem appropriate in their roles. Yet for anyone living some- where other than .Schenectady I can not imagine that this book would be very enjoyable. Snatches of the story are beautifully writ- teL\, yet they never seem to in- terlock with the other beauti- fully w#Ften ~natcbes. With his constant.· bangmg away at the fund-r~!iliig campaign, the church parties, . the minister with pre- tensioil.$ to bishopry, and with his many other anti-religious refer- ences,. Leary tends to become te- dious.

Let us hope that we can devise a better system, and not return to the genuine horrors of the immediate rush. The financial development pro- gram of the college, which must succeed if we are to enjjoy the needed buildings, better equip- ment, more generous student aid, and better compensated faculty members, has also suffered from the frustrations of operating without a Director of Develop- ment throughout the year. Mr. Albert Smith has performed bril- liantly with the Annual Alumni and Parent funds, but other as- pects of the campaign have been waiting for the arrival of the new Director of Development..; Stephen Holbrook - we can expect rapid developments this summer and fall. Meanwhile, Nott Memorial has been renovated for college store and theatre, Washburn is leveled to make room for two new classroom-office buildings, and the architects are busily perfect- ing plans for these buildings and for more dormitories. One area should not create feelings of frustration - the program of convocations, lectures. concerts, and movies. Attendance has been at a high level,. and the level of Quality has been even higher. Professor Girdner and his faculty-student committee are to be congratulated, and we look forward to an equally exciting series in 1964-65.

The inevitable has happened, and as a result the I.F.C has been dealt a staggel'ing blow which we feel has harmed its position on this campus to ::mch an extent that it can never again be an effective organization. A dangerous precedent has been set. The faculty has overruled a bmnch of the student government. Yet we can find little fault \\'ith what the faculty council did. The faculty provides the continuity on a college campus, out- lasting, in most cases. the four year stay of the students. Thus if the students fall into traps that previous groups, in previous yeal'S, fell into, it is both proper and fitting for the faculty to end the cycle. This is especially true when the cycle interferes with tht> academic business of the campus. We pointed this out on three different occasions in this newspaper. The I.F.C. had time to reconsider (this in and of itself does not mean reversing) - yet it didn't. It took no notice of the student referendum. It took no action to forestall or make unnecessary the faculty council action of the past week, though it knew what the final re- sult would be. Through its stubbornness, the I.F.C. has lost the battle over rushing. and what is more important, has permanently damagt'd its organization. One might argue that the I.F.C. was weak and power- less even before the faculty council decision, and that the council simply took advantage of that fact. This may pres- ently be the case, but the only hope for building a strong I.F.C. - or any student organization - for the futurt' depends upon skillful leadership that avoids the setting of precedents \vhich negate the power of the organization. This leadership vvas lacking in this case. and the I.F.C. has been irreparably damaged. Thus. the C'on<•ordi.-no,;is urges the Student Council to consider dissolving the I.F.C. We feel that the only hope for effective student gov- ernment is to have one strong organization to oversee all matters of student life. There is no need to divide student government into Independent and Fraternity segments. We propose that most of the responsibilities of the I.F.C. be taken over by the Student Council. This would avoid such eonflids of interest in major matters between student gov- ernments as we1·e caused by the deferred vs. immediate rushing issue. We realize that this would necessitate a reorganiza- tion of the Student Council's electoral process. Thus we propose that a \proportional representation\ system be instituted. This vvould mean that there would be one repre- sentative for a given number of students, with fraternities, independents, and freshmen electing a number of repre- sentatives commensurate with their population. This, it seems to us, would be a more equitable election system anyway. We welcome any other suggestions for a replacement for the I.F.C. But some substitute must be found -the I.F.C. under the present circumstances has lost the con- fidence of its members. Some houses have already con- sidered (not realizing the illegality of the move) with- drawing from the I.F.C. This is an unhealthy situation and one that must be remedied.

Actually, '!'he Innocmt Curate works far more effect ire- ly, both as pure humoUJ' and as personal and institutional ~atil·~. when it is being a novel about SchPnel'tady, about a particular white ehurch on lower L\nion Stn•t>t, and about a particulal' few people whom he dt>scl·ibl'S in g-reat detail. Actual Scherwrtady p<'npll', or parts of people, are easy to recog- nize in these descl'iption~. Thel'l' is OakPs Broussanl, \an instruc- tor of English Literature and a writer.

It feels strange, reading· about a town in which you've been living for a few years, and this is where thl' book is most plea~m rable, for as a r~­ ligious satire The Innocent Curate fails miserably.

Willison did his undergraduate work at Swarthmore and received his Ph.D. from Cornell. While working on his doctorate disserta- tion on the Indonesian Civil Serv- ice under the Dutch, he was awarded a Social Science Re- search Council Fellowship. Taught at Vassar His prior teaching experience consists of one year at Princeton University and three years at Vassar College. Dr. Fox expressed his pleasure at the prospect of a new, con:- petent man in the department. This past year, the scope of the upper class courses had been lim- ited by a lack of personnel, but this addition will make possible a broader curriculum and a much greater variety of comses, includ- ing courses in Industrial and Po- litical Sociology. choice for the scholar-in-residence Union College has participated program.

Bennington College's student body, in an overt demonstration of progressive thinking, has re- cently demanded an extension of visitfng hours for men in the rooms on weekends from the pre- sent limit of 10:00 p.m. to a pro- posed 1:00 a.m. The demand was supported by a large majority of the students and was expected to carry a great deal of weight with the college administration be- cause of the relative strength student government is supposed to have there. In a reactionary move which is usually manifest only on our un- - enlightened, conservative cam- puses, the Bennington Arminis- tration vetoed the proposal.

But, more than that, it's your chance to see, as in no other way, the career opportunities offered in the electrical industry. For here, under one huge dome, is assembled a full range of the electrical ideas that are helping millions of people throughout the world progress toward better lives. Ideas that come from the people at General Electric, who form a real \Progress Corps.\ There are new electronic ideas for neclicine that promise better patient care in our hospitals. Ideas for more efficient factories, less-congested transportation, better community lighting, increased highway safety, and more comfortable living at home. And there's the first large-scale pub- lic demonstration of nuclear fusion -the energy process of the sun. For you, Progressland is a rare chance to see what General Electric can offer in terms of a meaningful career in engineering, finance, mar- keting, law, sales and many other specialties. If this looks like your career path, talk to your placement director. He can help qualified people begin their careers at General Electric. Progre$S Is Ovr Mosf lmporfilnf ProtlvGf GENERAL. ELECTRIC
