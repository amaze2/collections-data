Steve Dickerman, a member of the Student Council's Long Range Development Plan Committee in- troduced its work and passed out copies of the Development office's statement on \Basic Aims.\ He informed the council xhembers that in the next few weeks his committee would visit the var- ious fraternity houses in order to speak to,individuals about Union College.

Assistant News Editor Lut·a·l Adv£>rllsimr !\tanager !'J'ational Advertising Manager , For The Curious The Board of Trustees' pamphlet on the \Basic As- sumptions For a Long-Range Plawling and Development Program\ defmes the basic purpose of the college as \to develop the minds of academically talented young men, to provide on its campus and in its classrooms a set of ex- periences through which those young men can find the intellectual training, stimulation and encouragement they need to realize their full potential for usefulness and serv- ice to our society.\ At the present time, Union has not fulfilled that pur- pose. Since the demise of the three year, experimental, Extendible system, the college has offered no opportunity for the superior student to independently go beyond ma- terial offered in the classroom. Althot~gh some may .sug- gest that it is the courious student's perrogative to probe any and all topics which interest him, we strongly believe the college ought to provide a program which w:ill bring these students to their full potential. Many other sma:ll schools have shouldered this responsibility through the institution of an Honors Program. An Honors program at Union has been debated on several occasions in the Faculty Council. Nothing fruitful has resulted from these discussions, primarily because funds have not been forthcoming from the Trustees to finance an increase in the professors' teaching load neces- sary to establish an effective program. We compliment the Trustees on their statement that \efforts- will begin im- mediately to create an effective honors program adapted to the College's educational patterns and programs, as the first step in meeting the obligation to superior students''. However, we suggest that if a suitable plan can be drawn up in the near future, the program be instituted before the projected date of the class of 1967. One program which appears applicable to Union has been successfully used at Swarthmore since 1922. It in- volves \concentration of the student's attention during his last two years upon a limited and integrated field of studies\ according to Swarthmore's bulletin. The student in Honors limits himself to two courses each semester. This restriction allows much broader investigation in one field at a particular time as opposed to fragmentation produced by five courses. He can read more deeply, investigate more thoroughly and correlate his ideas more meaningfully un- der this system. Academic guidance and an exchange of ideas is pro- vided by weekly seminars in each course. These seminars usually three hours or more in length, are limited to seven students. Here, there is an open and free exchange of ideas and discussion of material read during the previous. week. The student then will profit not only by his own individual investigation but also by that of others participating in the seminar discussion. Students in Honors at Swarthmore are not responsible for periodic examination. Their work is constantly being reviewed by professors and students in the seminar group. At the conclusion of the two year program, each student is required to take an examination, made up by examiners from other colleges, in each field he has studied. In selecting bis eight seminars, the honors student must fulfill a requirement of four seminars in his major field. The remaining four are usually divided in each of two minor fields. Candidates for Honors apply for admission during their Sophomore year to the departments in which they plan to study. They are accepted on the basis of past per- formance and of their capacity for accepting the responsi- bilities of the prqgram. Upon successful completion .of Honors work, the graduate is awarded a degree with Honors, with High Honors or with Highest Honors. A program such as this must be drawn up by the faculty, approved by the Board of Trustees and put into operation by the administration within the very near future if Union is going to accept a responsibility to superior stu- dents which has already been accepted by most other small colleges of Union's calibre. The Squeeze Play Several weeks ago the administration announced plans to have commencement exercises return to Memorial Chapel. We would like to remind the administration that seating space is very limited in chapel. Since the gradu- ates and faculty must sit in the audience, little space is left for parents, alumni and friends who will be on campus that weekend. In spite of the traditionally formal atmo- sphere effected by commencement in chapel, we suggest that commencement be rescheduled and returned to the Field House, thi:IS permitting a greater number of inter- ested spectators at the exercise which we deem a more important consideration.

He deliberately plants thl' implieation that the Communi:;ts were there- to inspire and lead tht> student demon~tra­ tion. The truth is that the Com- munists were there because the ('ommittee has subpoenaed them. Distorted Truth Our conern is not to defenrl the students. Some of them were pro- voked into doing things they should not have done. Our concern is that an agl'ncy of our Government has so gros~· ly distorted the truth of wh: t happened that tl1e net effect is a lie. The HUAC has had a great deal to say about the dishonesty of Communists. Yet the eommit- tPe has resorted to the same taC'- tics. It has been subversi\'e of the American ideals of truthfulness, fair play, and justice. This kind of prop:~ganda does not contribute to an informed public. We are al.so concerned about the emotional response provoked in viewers of the movie. The re- sponse is often fascistic in nature and doubly evil since it is inspired by a deliberate misrepresenta- tion of the truth. The chief in- ,·estigator for the HUAC on the west coast has publicly admitted, on the Goodwin Knight television show. that the film contains in- accuracie$ and distortions.

It is the goal' of the Stickmen to improve on last year's 4-9 rec- orq (the best record by a Union squad since 1954). The ledger shows that the Garnet have posted only two winning seasons in la- crosse during the past 19 years. This poor recoxd is not due to poor coaching or lack of hustle, but to an almost complete ab· sence of e:xperienced players from the campus.

It should, if nothing else, stimulate a serious re-eval- uation of campus fire prevention and evacuation procedures by the administration. First ,there is presently no direct line from the dormi- tory fire alarms to the local fire department. A fire may be reported either by telephone or by several alarm boxes placed in front of North College, in back of Washburn Hall or on the corner of Seward Place in back of West College. The alarm sounded at 1:15 AM in West College, but the department was not alerted until nine minutes there- after. Chief Ernest Burger stated that these nine minutes may very well be crucial in preventing the spread of a serious outburst. Luckily, this time the flames were con- fined to the basement of a fireproof construction. What would have happened if a building such as South College burned uncontrolled for this time interval? Many will, of course, counter that if a direct connec- tion were instituted, campus relations with the fire depart- ment would quickly disintegrate because of an unusual number of false alarms. In the past several years, Union has not been responsible ·for a.n abnormal number of false alarms in the community. Furthermore, if this arrange- ment did eventually present a problem, which we seriously doubt, strict discipline of those involved would soon destroy it. If a direct line syslem can save lives and prevent un- necoosary disaster, why is Union still one of the colleges without it? Second, Union students have never been instructed in an orderly procedure to follow when the alarm bell rings. Freshmen heard the signal and mildly passed it off as someona's idea of a bad joke. They paid little attention to it save trying to silence it. Many merely turned over and went back to sleep. Not until Tony Turner and several of the dormitory counselors ran through the halls shouting to evacuate in an antiquated town cryer fashion were the freshmen impressed by the seriousness of the bell. Time which could have meant the difference between safety and disaster under more serious 'circumstances was lost merely because of ignorance. Several colleges such as Pennsylvania State University have monthly fire d:tiils to ensure an orderly, unchaotic evacuation of dormitory buildings in case of fire. If this appears unnecessary for Union, during orientation the in- coming freshmen should be instructed in the sound of an alarm bell, its significance and an orderly procedure for evacuation when it rings. Had any other building been affected or had the fire broken out in any other part of West College, chaos would undoubtedly have predominated last Tuesday. If the college is to effectively safeguard the lives of its students, instruction in an efficient means of evac11ating the dormitories must commence immediately. The lives of one thousand students are in the hands of the college administration. At the present moment these lives are not adequately protected. Here, we have sug- gested two possible means of improving campus fire pre- vention. A serious investigation to discover other possible innovations must be incorporated immediately before the campus is faced with a more serious reenactment of Tues.. day's fire. Lavery Endorsed This year's Student Council has proven itself to be a complete reaction to progress made by the coundl under Ed Ruth. In place of an active, progressive student govern- ment which consciously supported liberal student move- ments throughout the country and produqed several signifi- cant proposals which have improved Union as a college, we have been subjected to an almost complete lethargy on the part of our campus legislators. Significantly absent from this years council was the dynamic leadership which Ruth typified. If the college is to regain the pro[il'ess made by the 1959-1960 council we must find that leadership in a candidate for Student Body President. We belie-ve that Norman Lavery has the ability neces- sary to bring the council out of this state of immobility. He has proven himself in the council, having served as an ac- tive participant on many of the council committees. On page 1, he has sincerely analyzed J;Dany issues which face the Council today and has produced several constructive solu- tions to these problems. In view of his qualifications we heartily endorse Norman Lavery as next year's Student Body President.

The two men discussed tne merits -of \Operation Abolition\ pro and con after its showing. Government Threatened \Operation Abolition;\ created from subpoenaed films, has as its purpose, the desire to convince Americans that their government is threatened internally by Com- munist infiltrators. It is champi- oned by the House Un-American Activities Committee although paradoxically no credits appear. It opens with Representative Wal- ter, the Committee's chairman, telling his audience that they ar~ in the midst of an overwhelming communist conspiracy. One gets the feeling he should look askance at the person sitting next t9 him. Could he be a communist? The movie represents students of many of California's universi- ties unwittingly being used to further communist aims. It shows riots and mob scenes, water hoses and gendarmes. It shows secret agents\ and demonstrations, and Washington, populated by three sagacious representatives. It looks like a hybrid of a Charlie Chaplin episode crossed with Uncle Fred•s home movies. Yes \Operation Abolition•• is a third-l'ate documentary. \'es, it IS spliced, and edited to misrepre- sent facts by supplementing them with half truths. And this is what is so apalling. For the House Un- American Activities to sponsor such gross hypocrisy committee makes a citizen wonder just whom it is he has to fear.

We can still recognlZ'e the broad, powerful slashes of paint, but something has hap- pened to their Franz Klein-like starkness and brutality, which had left us a bit enervated by the time Enzer graduated. For exampl(<!, in his \oriental\ series (the titles, at least, are oriental), which are all the same size and predominantly 1·ed, blue, and white, the large bold forms twist and cavort about the can- vas with a lyric abandon which defies, and perhaps obviates, any profound interpretations. Ones such as \Remembrance of Toba Soja\ and \Pige Chu TUan\ look like the French tricouleur flut- tering from an open window, and have the same feeling ()f fresh- ness and gaiety. It seems that Enzer was .being more spontan- eously .expressive in these than in his more deliberately formal ab- stractions (such as \Flying Left Apotheosis\) and thus it prob- ably wouldn't be fair to harp on some of their weaknesses of com- position. This brings up the phe- nomenon of the Shifting Critical Viewpoint, by which the modern critic is e:x;pected to constantly refashion his criteria of judgment to fit what he thinks to be the particular artist's purp.ose; if he should question one of these PW- poses, he's usually called all sorts of nasty names. This is perhaps. valid, but it can create situations which confuse the public,as when a critic might call Mondriim great because he constructed an 'order, and Pollock gr~t because he de- atroyed an order. Man in Transition If there's any relevance in ali . this, it's that Enzer's pai:ntings should each. be seen freshly (111\- like Mark Rothko's recent retro- spective in New York, whose component parts all together .seemed to create one, overwhelm- ing, monumental painting), This is probably because Enzer has primarily been experimenting, frankly and unpretentiously, to discover some of the things one can do with paint. His \Lyric to Sweet Genevieve,\ for example, is in a completely different spirit from his \orien- tal\ series. The warm surface, with white striations brushed lightly over floating . tones of ochre, has a measured, dreamy, sensual quality, which. suggests a desire to meditate, or savour, rather than to abstractly express. This welcome eoncern for a ·sen- sitive sensuality is elaborated in the three largest paintings in the exhibit. \The Emulation of Endymion\ is built of a nebulous play of quasi-forms; which might lead the artist towar.ds an inter- esting rejection of all formal ele. ments. But \American Baroque Canonized\ strikes off in a mcn'e form-ccm~cious direction, and its successful fusing Qf tension and lushness entices the viewer to look· for more of the same.

During Homecoming and Fall Prom Week Ends fresh- men will be able to visit the vari- ous houses. The I.F.C. may set up other contact periods in the fraternities, as it deems neces- sary. The first week of the s-econd semester would be for the formal rushing and Hell Week would be for the last four days of the first week following Spring Vacation. The first order of new business was a motion by Mr. Lapham to have immediate rushing for the school year '61-'62. Opiriions were split in the discussion that fol- lowed. The deferred system was an ex- periment, argued the supporters of this plan, and we must build on our mistakes. The restrictions were too harsh and there wasn't enough informal contact. The pur- pose of this plan is not to \snow\ the ft·eshmen, was their answer to those members who disliked the financial burden caused by the de- ferred program. The immediate rush was eliminated because it was weak, they argued. It was also pointed out that the Pledge Presidents• Council voted for the deferred plan. A motion by Mike Gorden to taple the motion until the next tF.C. meeting was defeated, 9-8. It wasn't until the question to vote was called for the third time, that the necessary 2/3 majority was achieved. The motion to have im- mediate rushing during the ;61•!62 school term was then passed, 9-8. A request was then made for a recount on the \immediate rush- ing\ proposal. It was defeated, 9-8, when the recount was taken. Mr. Gorden• then moved to ac- cept the plan, which he had ex~ plained to interested members during the five minute recess, fol' semi-defen·ed rushing for next year.

Class Mall Matter, subscription 16c a ccvY: $3 a year delivered anywhere In the United States, The Whole Is Greater Than Any Of Its Parts In shortening the period alloted to final exams from two weeks to one week, the faculty did not shorten the amount of material for which each student was t() be held responsible. The examination schedlli.e, released last week, will end classes on Tuesday. May 16, and start final ex- aminations on Wednesday, May 17. This short interval between examinations and classes coupled with but one week for exams does not allow sufficient time for any stu- dent to efficiently correlate a semester's work into a mean- ingful whole for each of five courses. If the students are to assimilate an integrated and meaningful education, the faculty must recognize the need for a reading period. · Approximately thirty years ago, Union had a reading period which failed after several years of trial. It was initiated by President Day in an attempt to encourage more independent work on the part of the student body. It failed, however, not because of the students but because of the manner in which it was instituted. The reading period was not college wide. The administration estab- lished it, permissively leaving details of its operation to the discretion of the various departments or divisions. Its failure can be attributed to the chaotic manner in which it was effected; students studying in several divisions were subject to different ru1es regarding the last two weeks of each semester. For a reading period to be effective it must involve the entire campus and must be identical in every department. A reading period may take one of two forms. Either it may last one or two weeks or it may be limited to three or four days. If the first is considered, it wou1d necessitate additional assignments specifically chosen by the professor to integrate the semester's work in preparation for a com- prehensive final exam. The latter proposal would not neces- sitate additional assignments but would afford the student several days to coherently correlate the material in his courses before examinations. The first proposal is impractical for Union this year but should be seriously considered by the faculty in plan- ning the 1961-1962 academic calendar. The second, how- ever, is not only possible but also practical. If the faculty canceled those classes scheduled for Monday and Tuesday, May 15 and 16, it would delete only one teaching day from each course in the existing schedule but would allow the period from Saturday to Wednesday for a concerted review and integration by the student. The normal procedure in the Faculty Council is to propose a motion at one meeting, refer it to the divisions for consideration and vote on it at the next meeting. There is but one more meeting of the Faculty Council. We, there- fo're, ask that if the Student Council passes a motion re- questing a reading period this semester, it first be proposed within the division meetings and treated as an \emergency proposal'· at the May Faculty Council meeting. To Be Continued The institution of deferred rushing last year was the most significant, progressive advance Union's student body has made in the last several years. Ideally, however, the first semester should be a completely informal period of contact between freshmen and fraternity men. Theoret- ically, there should be no restrictions, thus giving each of them an opportunity to get to know the other well enough for both to make an intelligent selection during the formal rushing period. Unfortunately, however, the ideal cannot exist. We may, though, strive to reach closer and closer toward this ultimate end. The primary objection to this projected in- formal atmosphere is that it necessitates a financial drain on the houses, each trying to maintain a continuous rush- ing program for one semester. This need to compete should not exist but nevertheless does. The rushing proposal sub- mitted by the IFC Committee on Rushing will allow unr~ stricted contact outside the houses and dormitories but would limit fraternity parties for freshmen to two, Home- coming and Fall Prom Weekends, thus effectively limiting the money spent on rushing during the first semester. A plan for \semi-deferred\ rushing was also submitted. It calls for a deferred period lasting only tmtil .after Thanksgiving at which time there would be one week of formal rushing;· Greek week would then be some time in · the second semester. This proposal appears te> us to be entirely impractical. First, it necessitates breaking up the academic .calen- dar of both semesters. However, were a system. similar to the Committee's plan adopted, formal rushing would re- quire but one week, the first week of the second ,semester, Greek week being scheduled for the first week after Spring recess, thus effecting only one semester~s calendar. Second, one half of a semester is not adequate .for freshmen to achieve a complete adaptation te> the college before being divided lnto seventeen small socia.l groups. A complete semester, which includes an initial experience with final examinationB, should precede this soCial division. Furthermore, the second half of the fall term is extremely short and particularly crowded with assignments and papers, thus prohibiting an active pledge period. Semi- deferred rushing then must be rulec;l. out as impractica;l. We strongly recommend that every house judiciously weigh the relative merits of both deferred rushing pro- posals. In light of our serious consideration, we urge that the Committee's plan em:bodying informal contact over a full semester before formal rushing be adopted f0r next year. !:Reading Period Proposal!

Not that this auburn mushroom was of any biological, theological, or linguistic significance (it has not yet been detennined whether it is a French mushr()om, although the culinary forte of the depart- ment has naturally attached a liking to it), but it seems that already the mushroom has its worshippers. (That is, by noting the increasingly reverent expres- sions on the faces of those pro- fessors coming rather frequently out of the temple.) This mushroom is at once a ro- mantic cry for the \back to na- ture,\ a naturalist attempt. to prove that the humidity of the room is conducive [or the cultiva- tion of fungi, and an existential- ist drive to prove that the mush- room has no other significance and no other essence but in out minds. Growing in the extreme south- east corner of the lavatory, this poOT sojourner of this elegant and revered structure is more of a symbol, a sort of star of Bethle• •hem shining in the midst of creaking floor boards, hanging steam ·pipel;l, and cracking ceil- ings. It is the symbol: May it be Revered. May thou live forever and ever on the lavatory floor of a worn out barracks. Amen. -JONATHAN THRONE •es To the Editor of Concordiensia: After reading Mr. Nurick's lei;- ter which appea:red in the laF.t issue of the Co:ncordiensis, one might wonder what would hap~n if the student council were to call a meeting of the student body. Would the students turn- out en masse to express their righteous indignation and wrath'! Or course, they wou:ld not. Would the men of Union snake off thei:r apathy and demand 1·eforms in the council 'l Don't be ridicul()\lS. Apathy h.as become the students most cherished ri:ght at Union.

A Costly Appendage By David Berenson Much has been said and written recently about th.e methods of the House Committee on Un- .American Activities. Many per- sons have criticized the HUAC's tactics of ,guilt by association :;~nd the seeming re1·ersal of the principle \innocent until proven guilty.\ While these criticisms may be true, ma.ny people are missing a very convincing argu- ment for the abolition of the com- mittee, namely that the HUAC has net served its, legislative pur- pose and is therefore a waste -of the taxpayers' money. . A look into what the HUAC has accomplished in its twenty- four years of 'existence demon- strates what little real reason there is for its present status as a separate committee. In twenty- four years, the HUAC has held exactly seven hearings on bills re- ferred to it 1( nolle at all since 1950). Of the 36,000 bills referred to various committees by the 83rd, 84th, and :85th Congtesses; only ten were sent to the HUAC where' all died without hearings. Legislation Lacking It can be seen that the HUAC refuses to act on. legislati~;>n re- ferred to it· What then is the reason fOT its seemingly constant hearings? Supposedly,. it holds hearings like the ()ne in San Fran. cisco last May t<> initiate theii• own legislation, not legislation re- ferred to it. Once again facts fail to support the HUAC. A report appeared in 1958 listing aU the legislative recommendations made by the cofiU11ittee fr()m 1941 to 1958. The reports list 79 rec- ommendations, but 34 are iden- tical, \having been made in more than one session ()f Congress. Thirty recomm:endations were relevant to six statutes. Of these six acts, only two were initiated by the HUAC. The others were considered by t:he House Judiciary Committee. The two that the HUAC did initiate were the In- ternal Security Act and its 1954 amendments. It is significant the Internal .Security Act passed over the veto of Truman and still awaits a pl'eme CoUlt decision on its stitutionality.

For- mer goalie John Campani and Larry Madison will start at mid- field, and promising sophomore Bill Riffle will be in the goal :for Union. The Garnet Ten has yet to taste the spoils of victory this year, having dropped games to W es- leyan, MIT, ap.d Stevens. The loss to Stevens last Saturday was due in part to the absence of defense- man George Thompson and the failure of the Garnet to score key goals when the opportunity pre- sented itself. The Union attack missed the goal by inches as many as five times, and two of Hobart's goals were scored through the spot vacated by Thompson, but the score still remaine<;l. 5-3. Coach Bruce Allison believes that last Year's 14-l defeat at the hands of Hobart, is no criterion for judging the forthcoming en- counter. Allison is not overly o:p- tomistic, however. He maintains that the element of chance cannot be disllegarded.
