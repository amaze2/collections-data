A Greater Honor The past academic year has been marked by the inno- vation of the Honors Program at Union. While the pro- gram has met with varying degrees of success in the vari- ous departments in which it has been adopted, it does show great promise for the future if more substance and struc- ture can be inserted into it. As often happens during the first year of any signifi- cant undertaking, the Honors Program has been marked by a certain degree of confusion regarding academic con- tent and student selection. As stated in a Concordiensis article of two weeks ago, the types of courses offered by the various departments vary widely. In some depart- ments, honors consists of nothing more than a glorified senior thesis. Others have their students participate in a series of seminars, sometimes with a definite course out- line in mind and sometimes without. Still other depart- ments use a combination of the two methods. Student selection shows no more unity than course structure. The approaches used have varied from active recruitment of students to waiting for the students to ap- proach the professors. Although there is a general college policy on qualifications for honors, it seems clear that there has been a great deal of variation in the caliber of students from department to department. As a result of this confusion, the results of the first year of the Honors Program have not been as gratifying as hoped. Some students have been selected for honors who were clearly not capable of the quality of work ex- pected while others who could have done an excellent job did not get into the program for a number of reasons. Many honors classes spent more time organi~ing the struc- ture of the program than in actual academic work. Yet, with all the drawbacks, the Honors Program has had some considerable worth. After getting over their initial confusion, a number of students have been able to produce substantial work they would have been unable to do in a regular course. It is imperative that those faculty members concerned with the future of the Honors Program do some serious planning this summer. They have the opportUnity to pro- duce a program in which eager and capable students, not recruited students, have a unique opportunity to greatly increase their intellectual experience while in college. The Moral Generation With all the talk in the last few years about children's minds being corrupted by contemporary television, movies, etc., it is refreshing to note that this concern about up- holding moral standards is not a one-way affair. A num- ber of students have expressed concern about subjecting their parents to some of the language and ideas expressed in Jack Gelber's \The .Apple\ which was presented last weekend. The Editorial Board of the Concordiensis does not pretend to be competent enough to evaluate all aspects of this complex play. We believe Robert Skloot gives a competent defense of the play's artistic merit in his letter to the editor. However, the Concordiensis would like to state unequivocally its strong belief that the parents of Union College students are mature enough to be exposed to plays of this nature. Letters to the Editor To the Editor of Concordiensis: I should like to commend you and your reporte1·,· David Volk- man, on a well-written, interest- ing story concerning you·r survey of faculty feeling about admis- sions policies and practices. One wonders, however, whether you truly have the best interest of the institution at heart when you attempt to pit faculty against administration by misquoting one to the other. One also wonders what self-serving purpose you had in taking out af context and magnifying one small portion of a half~hour radio quizz show. (A replay of a tape of the program wauld serve to show anyone that the main theme ·Of my remarks were exactly. opposite to the im- pression you attempted to convey to the faculty readers of your survey). Any college faculty which is completely satisfied with the ability and motivation of its stud- ent body probably is deaf, dumb, blind and senile. Certainly the Admissi<ms Office has never found the Union CoHege faculty to be handicapped by these im- pediments, even when some af the faculty have chosen these selfsame adjectives to describe the admissions staff. We in the Admissians Office are just as disappointed as are the faculty when a boy with good ability fails to use it. This is the third letter I have written to the Coneordiensis this year. I think it's about time you played fair and printed one of them, if only to give me an op- portunity to repeat a statement I made in one of my letters last fall, to wit: The Admissions Of- fice feels a great responsibility to the candidates it serves, ta the faculty and to the college as a whole. It constantly searches for better candidates and its final selections are based upon this objective. Our present student body is a fine one by any known measuring device. Union stud- ents' average scores on College Boards (both verbal and mathe- matical) stand at the 87th per- centile nationally and more than !10 o/c of our student body gradu- ated in the top fifth of their sec- ondary school classes. Certainly thei'e are better students to be found, though they are a rare commodity, and 2,000 other co-l- leges in America are scrapping hard for the same gilt edged product. Jonathan Pearson III Director of Admissions To tile Editor of Coneordiensis: Permit me to express my view that deferred rushing has worked well, and will continue to serve the best interests of the college. As a member of the Class of 1963, I was rushed the fi-rst week of school. Most people with whom I have spoken agree, for numerous reasons, that this pro- cedure is detrimental to both the entering student and the college. It is a hasty and insensitive method which serves only the parochial interests of the campus. Those individuals who think merely of the fraternity system, and not of the context in which i't operates, do themselves rnuch injustice. When claiming that a freshman must pledg-e with the \right f~:ame of mind\ they mere- ly attempt to veil the fundamen- tal purpose-that of hoodwink- ing entering students before they have the opportunity to view the fraternity system with objectiv- ity. Both sides are aware that the fraternity system at Union must \fish or cut bait.\ The responsi- bility rests on the fraternities to prove their merit, and the most satisfactory method of rushing is that way which will maximize intelligent decision by both the freshman and th~ fraternity. With this in mind, I wQuld like to state that I am in favor of immediate rush. This opinion rests upon one most compelling reason. Anyone who ca1·es to view the not-very-distant future will see a commodious, well-outfitted and convenient \Student Activities Center\ on Union's campus. For the first tilpe, the social system of the college will become com- petitive. I would like to ask you, as an incoming freshman, would stom- ach the transparent, high-pres- s.1)re sincerity of the first week; ,vhen a free, relaxed and c::>m- fortable alternative social system was available. I don't think so. Permit me to exp1·ess the opin- ion that return to first semester J'ushing would ushe1' out-even more quickly-those several weak sisters so ardently ii) favor of im~ mediate rushing. This is all to the good. If I were in favor of a fratern- ity :oystem at Union (an assump-' tion which I am not prepared to make), and wanted to make that frat~rnity system strong and dy- namiC, I would vote for the im- mediate rushing plan. This would be one way -of getting rid of a good deal of dead wood. More- over, a vote for immediate rush might well put considerable pres- sure on the college to start mov- ing toward that long-needed stud- ent activity center. I am i·n favor of immediate I'ush simply because it would as- sist some, if not aH fraternities is slitting their own throats. ' Edward Skloot, President of the Student <Body To the Editor of Concordiensis: Mr. Berenson, I believe was misguided , in his editarial con- cerning the Student Council's de- cision to refute a minimum 1ndex. He said, \ ..• the Student Council is acting extremely unwisely when it refuses to allow the Stu- dent Body to ma.ke the final de- cision on matters of this nature.\ The new procedures used in the Council now enabie a representa- tive to taLk to his constituents be- tween the first meeting, when a proposa-l is brought forward and the next meeting when it is voted upon. It is the responsibHity of a representative to see his con- stituents and obtain their views. I did this. The opinions 1•eceived ran 10 to 1 against this pmposal; it was therefore rny duty to at- tempt to defeat this motion when it came up last Tuesday night. Mr. Berenson also stated that, \Some representatives explained their negative votes by stating that if the Council passed the measure, it would be interpreted by most of the students as an endorsement of adoption.\ This was my belief. No amount of publicity, promised by Mr. Ber- enson, could have brought the Council voted in favor of the pro- posal solely to bring it in front of the Student Body meeting. On Friday, before the Concordy was distributed, the students at the general meeting would only have known that the Council voted in favor of this motion. In other words, an endorsement. I was against this proposal and cast my negative vote when I had the most opportune moment when my vote counted most. I'll state my opinion on a proposal when it is brought before me and will never vote in a manner that is against my convictions at any time. William P. McGovern '65 Student Council Rep. To the Editor of Concordiensis: Tasteless, disgusting, disap- pointing and thoughtless; these were a few of the words I heard parents use in describing The Apple, the Mountebanks' spring production. It has always been my belief that when we invite our parents to Parents' Week-end, we do so with the intention of entertaining them, not with the intention of subjecting them to an unnecessar- ily uncomfortable time. Admit- tedly, at times some parents are disappointed by this or that; but why go out of our way tc cause such disapproval? I might add that it was not only the parents who thought that the choice of that play was a poor one. I for one thought that The Apple was chosen in ex- tremely bad taste, and hope that next Parents' Weekend I shall not be embarrassed to bring my parents and younger members of my fan .. ily to the Mountebanks' producti.~n. Terry Bannock '65 To the Editor of. Concordiensis: It has been brought to my at- tention that there has been some criticism voiced against the Moun- tebanks' spring production of The Apple. It is my intention to ex- plain the Mountebanks' reason not only for presenting such a play, but for presenting it on Parents' Weekend. First let me say that the critics of the play are very few. From almost all parents, students, fac- ulty, and friends who have seen the production, we have received the highest praise. This is cer- tainly not to suggest that they all understood part or all of it, but they did enjoy it for one very basic reason-The Apple is good theater. This was proved by its long and successful run off- Broadway at the .Living- Theatre in the 1961 season, and it was proved again at Union College this week. In an earlier Concordiensis ar- ticle, Professors Wingate and Girdner, the advisers to the Moun- tebanks, explained their reasons for choosing The Apple, and I think it is not out of place to summarize them here. The Apple is part· of a movement called the (Continued on Page 4) Friday, May 3, 1963 Protn Horror-Scope THINGS GUARANTEED TO HAPPEN DURING SPRING WEEKEND (An unabashed imitation of Jimmy Cannon's sports column> Schenectady weather will perfuLIH in traditional fashion.

Working in a sport Hamilton's Warren Palmer, of 1 strikeout route only three times, HobartDownsGarnet; Streak Halts At Six The Union College lacrosse team suffered their first defeat of the current season in a ,rugged 5-4 clash with the Hobart Statesmen on Daley Field last Wednesday afternoon. The setback broke a string of six consecutive victories, the longest for the Garnet since 1952. The first three periods of the clash saw only brief moments of the Garnet team which handily shut out Wesleyan last Monday, as sloppy field conditions and a constant drizzle throughout the first half were paralleled by gen- erally sloppy play. Unfortunately both teams had to suffer the in- justice of inexperienced referees, in addition to the weather, but it was the Hoba1:t offense, led by All-America Steve Slattery, tak- ing advantage of penalties and the man down situations which made the difference in the out- l'ome. Hobart Tallies Hobart opened their offensive while Rudy Umscheid spent a minute on the bench for slashing. Hobart managed another score in the second period again with the Dutchmen missing a defense- man because of a penalty, and got their fifth goal early in the final stanza. It was at that point that the Garnet finally started moving the ball in their usual fine fash- ion. Hann began displaying his fine stickhandling ability and gar- nered two assists as he fed Bow- man for the last two Union scores. In the last ten minutes of the game fine passing and baH control were keynotes of the Gar- net comeback, and it is too bad that adjustment to the weather and Hobart toughness, did not come sooner for the Union stick- ers, because they showed in those last few minutes why they are definitely a superior squad. swimming team's improvement where conditioning is of the es- basketball fame carne on in re-! but the opposing fielders always from the worst record in Union sence, Mr. Turner was capable of lief in the fot;rth inning and I seemed to be in the right place history to the best in history, drawing the best out of his blanked the Garnet in all but the at the right time.

In Conclusion Union College has undergone another year of limited improvement. Changes in programs and policies have gen- erally been for the better. Yet, there have been no hold steps taken to change the college's position to any signif- icant degree. We have passed through another year with- out reaching the bright future that everyone seems to feel is just around the corner. The most notable change during the past year has been the adoption of the Davidson Calendar for the aca- demic year of 1964-1965. Together with the development of the Honors Program, the· new calendar could cause a revitalization of Union's intellectual atmosphere, a change that is sorely needed. Today this revitalization is nowhere to be seen. Little comment pas been heard from faculty a:nd students regarding the exciting new programs that can be developed. Unless someone starts making plans now, the prospect is that Union will continue as a college of the intellectually interested few and the intellectually apathetic many. A seven percent increase in faculty salaries has been a:nnounced for next year. This increase seems to be a great advance on the surface, but a little probing reveals that, again, Union has not been making great strikes. With this seven percent increase the gap between Union faculty salaries and the salaries of the schools Union is constantly comparing itself with remains constant; it does not narrow. The combined salary increases of the past two years are still behind the pace laid out in the Development Plan. Un- less it becomes a firm policy for the college to increase faculty salaries by a significant amount each year, we will be unable to hold onto the faculty we now have, much less improve its calibre. Nevt year's freshman class promises to be one of the biggest and best in recent Union history. A late increase in the number of qualified students increased the total number of students accepted and enrolling next year. Yet, it is doubtful whether the would-be freshmen's general attitude toward Union College will change. The chances are that the majority of freshmen will not care much about anything and that the interested minority will rapidly become disillusioned and bitter. In spite of all the advances in next year's class, more competent students have still been rejected in favor of less c~pable students for reasons such as \geographical distribution\ that no one is able to justify fully. Much talk has been heard recently about the appoint- ment of a new Dean of the College. The consensus is that the mere change of face in the administration is bound to help the college. However, no beneficial results will come about unless the new dean and the entire administration decide to truly administer the affairs of the college. Union can never become a dynamic institution as long as the administration is constantly acquiescing to the will of vari- ous other campus power groups. The Student Council has this year shown a: realiza- tion of its proper role on campus. However, the Council has thus far represented an elite of the student body. The average Union student is quick to criticize the College, its faculty, and its students, but he never takes any action to alleviate the situation. The problem with Union students in the past year has not been that they are apathetic but that they have been quick in finding fault 'lnd slow in attempting to correct the faults. A large number of apathetic students exist at any college. What distinguishes any institution is the productivity of the stu- dents who do claim they are interested. Union is still a basically good institution, although it is not as good as we wish it to be. In the last few years the College has shown progress although not as much progress as we wish. If everything goes right, Union will become one of the great colieges in the United States in the next few years. However, if luck does not bestow its blessings on Union and a more concerted effort is not made to change the basic atmosphere on campus, Union will not become better but will be left behind as other colleges also go through their development plans. Union's future suc- cess should not require luck; success requires hard, real- istic plans that will be followed. The quality of Union Col- lege is an imperative topic for the students, faculty, ad- ministration and trustees to consider, and for once to change in more than a few surface characteristics. Letters to . the Editor To the Editor of Concordiertsis: Benjamin Disraeli once said, \This shows how much easier it is to be critical than to be cor- rect.\ He might weH have been spe~ldng of \Asher Sheppard's\ review of the current Student Salon, which appeared in the Apl'il 30 issue of Concordiensil:l. tie certainly was inconect wnen ne stated tnat my moblles don't ::;wing in the breeze. 1 cannot un- uerstanti wny the convictiOn cu1·- ~·ents emanaun.g !rom his plethora or hot au· d.l<i .not cause even a ::;nght stir in the mob!les. _While 1 cannot begrudge the cntic his opmions, 1 uo feel that 1V1r.

That Mr. Sheppard missed this is unfortunate; tnat he tailed to al- low for its possibi!lty is adverse to the principles of good criticism. AU of this points to poor jour- nalism on the part ot the Con- cordiensis. Yea, they err. Mr. ::>heppard was not a good choice for the assignment. 'l'his fact is further born out by his extensive concentration on the works of M:r. Sherwin and myself. There are other artists' works that deserved equal attention. And worst of all, because it is a \student\ exhibit, some artists' works were not men- tioned at all. Maybe the critic did not consider himself capable of passing judgment on them. I can only hope that in the future the Concordiensis will select crit- ics that better exhibit \open- mindednel:ls\ and thoroughness. 1 plan to use humans in my next mobile.

To the Editor of Concordiensis: In the current issue on page 3 of your college pape1·, in the arti- cle on Lacrosse 1 note the follow- ing concluding paragraph:- \ If a winning spirit can be in- stilled in other Union teams as it has been on this team, maybe the Union student will gathel' some respect for Union athletics in general.\ Your remarks are tangible evi- dence of the relatively decadent spirit that prevails among the young men of today. It was my great privilege to start Lacrosse at Union thirty nine yea:rs ago. I have just made a speech before the Johns Hopkins Schenectady Alumni in which I related the vast difference in the spirit of the men in 1924-28, compared to the spirit that prevailed a little over twenty years later, when I spent a couple of years again coaching at Union. My conclusion was that \with material affluence, the1·e is spirit- ual decay.\ That will be tough for you to \swallow\ and you probably will dismiss the state- ment with \Oh he must be an old fogey!\ However, if you should be able to indulge in a little introspection, it might prove profitable!!!!

Victor Starzenski Father of Laerosse at Union College To the Editor of Concordiensis: We have no particular objec- tion to the fact that The Apple is \way out thete;'' as imagination, humor of a sort, and a brush with the beat world may thus be serv- ed. What we do object to is the constant emphasis on the Thea- ter of the Absurd, or comparabty low types of play i:n an institu- tion of higher learning; and the inconsideration and poor taste displayed by the frequent use of unnecessarily vulgar and lewd language. Although Bob Skloot et al gave a vivid and realistic portrayal of the very seamy side of life de- picted by The Apple, it seems to us that no amount of creditable acting can compensate for one shoddy vehicle after another. Today the pseudo-sophisticates not only try to exonerate filth but they give the impression of actually embracing it as a \nor- mal way of life.\ Under the guise of \realism\ and \maturity\ there seems to be a pervert€d at- tempt to justify unnatural, abnor- mal conduct and glorify gutter language that is still frowned upon in decent society. We fail to see how any positive values may :be derived from con- stantly emulating the lowest ele- ments of society-however real- istic such a course may be. A. Van Vranken DesForges To the Editor of Conc<H'diensis: Although some progress has been made in dealing with the problem of missing library books, it continues to be a matter of primary concern to the college community. Additional measUl'es designed to intensify our efforts are now under consideration, but their implementation \Vill depend upon a new appraisal of the sit- uation to be made this summer. This appraisal will be based upon a complete inventory of certain collections, and we are, therefore, making an effort to have all books returned by June 5. It will be possible to borrow books during the inventory, but its success de- pends upon the return of all books and re-establishment of a new loan date. Members of the faculty have been notified of our inten- tion by mail, and already a sub- stantial number of books have been returned by them. The co- operation of the student body in returning library books on or be- fore June 5 is essential. We hoJ?e we may have their assistance m this matter. E. K. Tolan, Librarian.

In Spain \s\ is pronounced \th\ and thereby hangs a tale. Until the reign of Philip IV -or Guy Fawkes, as he was ~ometimes called- Sp:wiards said \s\ just like everybody eiRe. Philip IV, huwcrer, li;;ped, and Spaniards, lmvin~ an ingmined sense of propriety and not wishing to em- bnrmss their monarch, decided that tl'C'1'!Jhody should lisp. ThiR did indeed put Philip I\' very much ttt hiR ease, hut in the end it turned out to Le a very bud thing for Spain. It wrecked the sn:::RUfras indm~try -Spain's principal source of revenue-and reduced the nation to n second-class power. Ail a result, SpaninrdR were all forced to turn to lHdl fighting in o1·der to keep body and soul together. Today, w1terever yol,i v,o in Spain-in Madrid, in Barcelona, in Toledo, in Clevelu.nd -you will see bulls being fought. For many years the bulls have sought to arbitrate this long-standing dispute, but the SpaiJiurds, a proud people who usc nothing but Castile soap, have rejected all overtures. It i:; therefore necessary for me to explain bull fighting to anyone ·who is going to Spain. It i>~ also necessary fQr me to say a few words ahetut, Mll.r1boro Cigarettes because they pay me fol' writing this column, and they ure inclined to pout if I iv,nore their product. In truth, it iR no cl1ore for me to sing the praises of Marlboro Cigarettes, for I am one who fairly swoons with delight when I come upon a cigarette which gives you the full, rich taste of' good tobaccos plus the pure white Selectrate filter, and Marlboro is the only smoke I have found that fulfills both requirements. Oh, what a piece of work is Marlboro! The flavor reaches you without stint or diminution. You, even B.S I, will find these statements to he happily true when once you light a Marlboro. Marlboros come to you in soft pack or Flip- Top box, and are made only by the makers of Marlboro. But I digress. Let us return to bull fighting. Bulls are by nature bellicose creatures who will keep fighting till the cows come home. Then they like to put on pipe and slippers and listen to the \Farm and Home Hour.\ However, the Spaniards will not allow the bulls any surcease. They keep attacking the bull and making veronicas-a corn meal pancake filled with ground meat. Bulls, being \'egetarians, reject the veronicas and then, believe you me, the fur starts to fly! To be perfectly honest, many Spaniards have grown we~ry of this incessant struggle and have left their hotneland. Co- lumlJus, for example, took off in three little ships-the Patti, the Maxcne, and the Lave:rne-nnd diRcovered Ohio. Magellan later discovered Columbu!'t. Balboa also sailed to the New World, but he >vas silent on a peak in Darien, so -it is diffi.cuJt to know what he discovered. Well sir, I guess that'R all you need to lmo~v about Spain.

In last Saturday's game vs. Stevens Tech, the Dutchmen squad behind Chuck Esposito's six-hitter, shut-out the Engineers 7-0. Espo- sito found the going quite easy as he struck out ten, gave up three bases on balls, and was backed by a solid 11-hit attack. The sophomore scoring duo of Jeff Schultheis and John Hann ac- counted for six goals between them as they each scored the three goal hat trick, and were ct·edited with two assists ea~h. The thirteenth goal went to mid- fielder Tom Salisbury, as he tal- lied in the second quarter. The defense had a relatively easy afternoon as the offe~se completely domi;nated p)ay w1th their fancy sbckhandlmg a~d scoring. Again led by the big four of goalie Bill Riffle, Rudy Umscheid, Ernie Toriz.zo, and Pete Wenger, and gettmg able assistance from Bocky Morgan, they were never pressed for a'!1Y long period of time, although Rir- fle came up with twenty saves m his usual outstanding way. Many See Action Because of the lopsidedness of the game, Coach Allison was able to let many of the boys pla¥\ wl:o don't normally see much actiOn m the tighter games.. Attackmen Pete Waldron, 'foby Whe~ler, and goalies Jake L1eb and ~1m Par- tridge saw plenty of actiOn. ~oth Partridge and Lieb were. cred1 te.d with three saves each durmg th~tr brief appearance in.the game. ~ill Riffle saw some action at the mid- field spot as he was allowed to display his all-around talent to the spectators. · On this past Wednesday the ' team traveled to Middlebury, Ver- mont to face Middlebury College and came away with a surprising- ly easy victory by a 10.-~ score. At the time of this writmg not many details were known al- though it was learned that Jeff Schultheis again hit for the three goal hat trick and Bowman scored one goal, as did John Hann. Mid- fielder Phil Canders tabled two counters in his usual fine after- noon. No other scoring was learn- ed and the number of saves cred- Ited to Riffle was also unknown, but they numbered in the twen- ties as he was again outstanding. Looking over the season thus far completed and anticipating the remainder, since this is the last issue, it appear the team sho1;1ld finish with an 11-1 record, with possible trouble to be caused by Stevens and Cortland State. The team has shown wrong, many ]He-season predictions, and . has . t-urned into one of the fmest teams in the East. Praise Due Allison Special praise should go to Coach Allison for a iob well done. Allison, perennially\ one of the coaches for the North-South game, has transferred to his charges many of the skills which made him an Ali-American at Cortland. His tremendous desire to win and his sense of sports- manship have been very evident in his players this season, and deserYe special attention. Best wishes are given the team from the student body for the re- mainder of the season, a season which has been one of the finest in Union lacrosse history.

In the third Art Frigo and Mc- Cray singled, Williams reached on .an error, and Nicholas un- loaded a double to right-center.
