27, 1961. CO. N N. Up LETTER·S TO T·HiE EDITOR P.age 2 Founded at Union College in 1877 ' . Vol .. 91, No. '5 SCHENECTADY, N. Y., FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1961 By Alan Kaufman Edward Skloot, chairman of the program, reported on \Focus\ with dismay and discouragement at the Student meeting last Tuesday evening. He emphasized that only 25· interested students~·---=-----= attended a general meeting last week when a minimum . of 50 was established neces- sary to promote the program effectively. Studettts Held Apathetic Skloot said, \The1·e seems to be no great enthusiasm . . . no ' movement against it . . . an apathetic view.\ The ~t.·rtT.,,nt Coltncil allocated the IRC $t650, $1250 of which may be used for \·Focus.\ He surveyed the aims of \Focus\ and added that it offered the participating · {ndividuals the opportunity of concentrated examination and · study of a subject. Skloot hoped that he wasn't a victim of \false optimism\ and issued a plea to the student body, through the Student Council, for help. All students interested ate urged to attend the next \Focus\ • meeting in 304 Bailey Hall next Thursday at 4:30 PM. Questionnaire PrepaJ;ed Allen Schwartz '64, chairman of-the .special Student Union Com- mittee, reported that he and his 11 associates will draft a question- naire in order to determine the st~dent body's preferences for a future \activity center\ on cam- , pus .. The committee will also exam- ine the needs of the various clubs and activities for such a building. These actions appear to be in res~onse to :the interest gener- ated by proposals to establish a Student Union.

The discussion which took place at that ll!-eeting can indicate little more than a degeneration of values on the part of Council members. In the opening reports, Edward Skloot, Chairman of Focus, stated that student response to Focus currently was not strong enough for his committee to continue plan- ning the tentative program for March. The Council has invested $1,250 of Student Tax funds in the program and has followed the progress of the planning of the weekend since last year. Yet, on Tuesday no member of the Council seemed concerned enough about Focus either to question Skloot about the reasons why Focus was not attracting student support or to comment about any part of his re- port. Instead of stopping to consider this, the most serious problem brought up during the entire meeting, the mem- bers chose to pass over it and continue on to the next order of business. The only part of the meeting during which our most lethargic representatives seemed to show any spark of awareness came under new business. Here, a motion to establish a Student Council Bulletin board was proposed. Suddenly, questions came from all parts of the floor, re- lating to its location, dimensions and contents. One mem- ber was concerned enough to propose that its cover be plexiglass rather than ordinary glass. Several opinioned council members then discussed the relative merits of both construction materials. The Council eventually voted in favor of the unbreakable plastic, a choice which could easily have been made by any student with a minimum of thought. It was truly disappointing that a topic as insig- nificant as plexiglass vs. glass was the only item on the Council's agenda which provoked either questions or dis- cussion during the meeting. When student government meetings reach a point of absurdity, it is time for lhe Council members to sit down and reappraise their ideals and values concerning the best interests of Union College. If in the future, the representa- tivs continue along the same lines, the student body must impeach their Council members and judiciously select those men .capable of assuming the responsibility given them as student government officers. An Educated Mind Next Wednesday a debate will be held in Memorial Chapel. The topic is a perennial one, a controversial one, an important one - the fraternity system and fraternities at Union College. The Concordiensis encourages the mem- bers of the student body and especially the freshmen to attend the debate. We believe that there are strong arguments on both sides of the fraternity issue. By becoming familiar with and understanding the different positions held and the rea- sons for them, the Union student can better decide his own position. The Union College of the present and future is, in part, the responsibility of the present student body. We believe that the Union student should take a responsible stand on the fraternity issue. Indicisiveness is as easy to come by as prejudice. Responsible decision is a challenge. Friday, November 3, Friday, Nove The Weavers MadisCJ By Julian Olf About five yeal'~ ago I sat in an over-crowded and over-heated l>alcony of an auditorium located somewhere in upper Manhattan. The audience was scattered and sprawled across the seats and aisles·; some stood in the rear a-nd other lay· strewn across the stage itself. All waited for the curtain to rise on a curtai:nless stage. A .stray guitar filtered ove1• the restless throng and met the hol- low voice of a recorder that sang some rows behind me. To my left a group· ·of yawning ·but anxious teens quietly hummed \'Deep Blue Sea.\ The lights were now beginning· to dim. From somewhere below, a male voice shouted on the top of his lungs. In reply the bai- con:y intermittently retorted. By the time the auditorium was dark, its enclosure was filled with a • swelling roar. Cheers and stamps, hoots and shouts, calls and crys, all beckoned the masters who were to appear on the stage at any moment to l'eceive the true applause of a devoted Hoote- nanny crowd. Fingers Pluck One was tall and thin, He wore a loose shirt, baggy brown trou- sers, and a long-necked banjo hung quietly against his chest. Another, of similar si!ature tuned his guitar while a heavy jowled man unceremoniously with a pleasant, dark-complexioned wo- man. Now the previously undisci- plined roar of the audie11ce was, as if by mil'acle, transformed into a gentle: \. . . halleluja , . .'; Am Everyone was lost in the driv- . h th f th t t d In the past mg r Y ms o a s range an . and' unheraldl disheveled group of Pied Pipers who invoked the voice ·Of all ob- been made in servers. illness.

This has consisted of articles pro and con by the faculty members and an editorial by the paper as well as a news article reporting the atti- tudes of the faculty at their an- nual retreat. There can be no denying that the fraternity system is at pros- ent not ideal, but it is far better than some of the faculty make it out to be. It is ce-rtainly true that the independents do not enjoy the same facilities for parties and re- laxation that fratemity men have, but that is not the fault of the fraternities. Professor Fox, in his article says that fraternities prevented individuals from having contact, \with varied types of human beings.\ This \exclusivity\ which he speaks of is non-existent. Nearly every fraternity on this campus has members with as varied backgrounds as are to be found in the student body at large. Where else but in a fraternity would rich men's sons get to as- sociate with and become friends of those men who have to work for their room and board 'l Do you believe 'Professor Fox that we should establish a false ideal- istic island at Union, &n island whose population ignores the fact that the world outside is filled with selectivity, disappoint- ments, and frustration'? I would question how the fra- terl).ities in their housing and feeding are a drain on the Col\ lege. On the contrary, fraterni- ties solve an embarassing prob- lem for the Trustees-namely a lack of funds with which to build more dorms and the much talked ahout Student Union. My fratern- ity has been in debt before and probably will be in the future, but never once have we received fi- nancial support from the college. Fraternities have been in exist- ence at Union since 1825, most of them have had their good years and bad years. All of them have contributed to the development of young m€n's maturity and inde- pendence. For example, where else but in a. fraternity could a twenty year old college student receive the opportunity of over- seeing a $50,000 (or more) a year budget'? It is especially annoying to me to find most of the faculty criti- cism coming· from the men who were not fraternity men them- selves. Perhaps if they had lived for four years in a fraternity they might be able to appreciate all that a fraternity offers to those individuals who are willing to exert a positive effort. Just as an after thought, a brief reply to \Mr. Henry Steele\ -the bitter condemnation of fra- ternities as the cause of the lack of intellectual and cultural inter- est at Union speaks only of indi- viduals who are too weak to act on their own. Because people don't attend a c>oncert or support FOCUS are fraternities to receive the blame? The administration has let it be known that it will have no money available fo1• the building of additional dormitory space (and of course the long awaited Student Union) for at least two years. Since most of the rec- ommendations for changing the existing situation revolve around construction of new dorms, it would seem unnecessary to con- tinue the fruitless debate between students and faculty over the fra- ternity situation. It should also be remembered that the final de- cision on fraternities lies with the trustees, not the faculty. Bradley p_ Sweeny '62 To the Editor of Concordiensis: I found both the articles in last week's. Concordiensis on the cases for and against .fraternities ~-ery interesting. Howe-ver, Pmf. Stone's article defending fra- ternities was of special interest to me, and I think it is deserv- ing of .:omment. With all due re- spect to Prof. Stone,· I cannot help but feel that he dodges the issue in two of his answers to common fraternity criticisms. For instance, I must disagree with hi:m in his claim that fraternities still serve thr:? purpose for which they were founded. As he states, fra- temities were founded· as social brotherhoods, and, to be sure, they continue to be social; but any claim to real brotherhood in modern fratemities, to my way of thinking, is not only questionable but downright ridiculous: There are ~any justifications for this (}!aim, but I think the best is merely to point out the discrepancy between the idea of brotherhood and the practice of rushing. How anyone can claim to be a member of a brotherhood and at the same time carry on a process involving co- ericion, opportunistic ftiendships, half truths, and outright lies to gain new members for the \brotherhood\ is be-yond me. I also cannot accept Prof. Task Force II By Frederic Rosenberg As part of the Long Range Planning and Development Pro- geam established last year, a joint trustee-faculty-administra- tion Task Force has been empow- ered to review the college's whole administrative operation.

Enjoys Testifying Most of the trial itself involved testimony and cross-examination of Police Captain Ray and an- other policeman named Sanders. Captain Ray was friendly as us- ual, greeting me \howaye Zev?\ and apparently enjoying himself on the stand. He seems to. enjoy testifying though he looked un- comfortable during the cross-ex- amination. I imagine he gives the same · testimony each time, as for no reason I could see, he got the facts all mixed up; had me stand- ing in the center of the room and . never approaching the lunch counter when in fact, I was sit- , ting there; refusing twice to . move on when in fact, I had mere- ly aske<l\\Why?\ and gotten no answer; and saying no more when in fact, we had protested that we were interstate passengers. Since it would have made no difference, I suppose it was because he couldn't remember which of the 307 Freedom Riders I was. He test.ified that he had infor- mation through regular police channels that we were coming to make trouble, that a mob of 25 angry but unarmed citizens (who had been screened by the police) was waiting to attack us, that we unarmed, that there were twelve armed officers in the sta- tion trained to control riots, that those of the supposed mob (in fact there had been only two or three and they didn't even sneer at us) who were ordered to move on did so a:lid thus were not ar- rested, that if he had moved on we would have left a room in which no one was threatening us and had to pass through the \mob\ at the door (in response to a question from Rosenberger), and that if he had not arrested me violence would have occurred. Jury Worried The case was absurd and ! no- ticed some worried looks in the jury. Rosenberger filed for a di- rected verdict, but was refused. The then asked for about 14 in- !)t:ructions to the jury and got them - to me it sounded like thel left no choice but acquittal; and there were more worried faces in the jury. Then Jack Travis, the prosecutor, rose and said: \Do you want Jacksc>n to be like its always been ... (Long pause) •.. a city of law and order? On an- othel' Chicago, ... or New York?! That finished it, because they knew the change he was talking . about wasn't in law and order (Ja,ckson's murder rate is 50% 'higher than Chicago's and that takes some doing!), and after about 25 minutes they brought in a verdict Of guilty. Rosenberger posed the jury, but it was obvious that was fUtile. We went to stand befol!e the judge, I signed the hail statement, and at 2:50 was on my way home - in the \Colored\ ·coach with the white co:tlduetor from Canton, Missis- sippi sitting beside me, very friendly.

New engineers with iQitiative who can meet Western Electric's high standards are offered many exciting career opportunities with our company in data processing development work as it relates to communication,s. For example, Western's engineers-working closely with Bell Telephone Laboratories-have · solved development and manufacturing prob- lems conn(lcted with the Bell System's new DATA-PHONE Data set (made by Western Electric). DATA-PHONE service lets business machines, such as computers, \speak\ to each other in a language of numbers and symbols over existing telephone communication networks. This represents a tremendous boon to business; and consequently, it is estimated that some day there may be more machine talk than people talk using telephone lines. Of course, data communications is only one of many rewarding career areas that await you at Western Elecbic. Here are just a few of the others: electronic switching •.. solid slate electronic devices . . . microwave radio relay ... computer-programmed.productionlines . , . solar cells .•. optical masers .•. futuristic telephones. We need high-caliber, forward-thinking en- gineers now to help us transform these plans into realities or to work with us in scores of other key communications areas.

L'iFculation MaJ.ilager Halfway There The lecture by William Golding in Tuesday's Convoca- tion was one of the most stimulating heard at Union in the past three years. Mr. Golding showed himself to be not only a great author but also a thought provoking and hu- morous lecturer. The Lectures and Concerts Committee is to be complimented for bringing a man of Mr. Golding's ~tature lu Cniun's campus. In considering the Golding Lec- ture. hmvever. one cannot help but view the future out- luul\ as bleak. The committee, currently operating under a $700 butlget for the whole year, must schedule eight lectures lwt\\'eon Septf'mber and June. The fee paid Mr. Golding .subtracted a large portion from the tota:l allotment. Only a few hundred dollars remain to finance those speeches scheduled for the second half of this semester and all of next semester. In selecting speakers, the committee has found several different types available for collegiate audiences. First, there is the lecturer who receives no honorarium: this cata- gory might include members of the Kennedy administra- tion. !\'ext, one finds the professional speaker who normally is ('Ontracted through an agency. His fee is somewhere near S1500. a price which Union can not possibly, at pres- ent, meet. Then there is the good academic speaker who receives a fee between $200 and $500. The committee is able to afford tw<> people (of which Mr. Golding was one) in this classification each year. The rest of Union's speak- ers are those who are neither professional nor particularly good. The only other way the campus is able to hear a worthwhile lecture is if the guest happens to be in town for a.nother engagement and kindly consents to deliver a short speech in conjunction with his visit, or if he is con- tracted for a specially endowed address such as the Brackett Lecture. If the Committee's budget could be increased, un- doubtedly it would be able to schedule more than two good lectures for this year. An improvement in the quality of the series might easily serve to counteract the forces of anti-intellectualism prevalent on the campus. Furthennore, the building of a high quality program might also attract those well known speakers requiring no honorarium but who \vould wish to become part of a distinguished lecture series. Responsibility for providing a lecture program suitable tu a collt>gc of Union's academic calibre lies with the Trustees. They are currently working through the Task Forces to determine an appropriate allotment for such an mriched program. Unfortunately, however, this examina- tion will not produce an effect for at least one year. In the meantime. the Trustees' main concern is whether enough student interest prevails to necessitate supplement- ing the Committee's budget. The most profitable means which we see for the stu- dents to demonstrate the appropriate concern is to con- tribute financially towards the series themselves. After having doled out funds to every recognized activity, the Student Tax Committee retains an excess of several thou- sand dollars not yet apportioned. In addition, with the recent demise of the Focus program, $1250 appropriated to the International Relations Club will be returned. Most of these funds should be given to the Lectures and Con- certs Committee to be used in this year's series. In this manner, the students would both add to their education for the year and would demonstrate an interest in better- ing the quality of the Convocation series. In appropriating these funds, however, the Student Council must specify that no precedent is being set. The responsibility for providing an improved lecture program lies in the hands of the Trustees, not in the hands of stu- dents. Student financial support is a one-time, make-shift solution. The Tr·ustees must then shoulder their proper duties. Friday, November 1 0, 1961 '*I': l I Not With A Bang But A Whimper William Golding: ;;A; '·' 1 • Optimistic Pessimist , . ~ • The demise of Focus is a reflection of Union College • attitudes and actiens. The student body has neglected an opportunity for co-ordinated individual exploration and study of a topic of national and international importance~ This was a program that would have, because of its schol- arly possibilities, challenged and stimulated the men who participated in it; a program that might have, if responsi- bly led and enthusiastically accepted, improved the image and reputation of Union College. Obviously, Union's image must be the image of her students and faculty. It can be nothing else, even in this day of multifarious propaganda. To borrow a phrase from WiUiam Golding, \let us not blame some other group or some outside force.\ The fault, dear Brutus lies not in our stars but in ourselves that we are .underlings.

Barmack '62. To the Editor of Concordiensis: Contrary to the view expressed in last week's editorial in this paper concerning the Student Council Meeting of 31 October, I contend that such a meeting is, in actual fact representative of a dynamic, efficient and organized group. The behind the scenes work of the members of our student or- ganization under Mr. Lavery's leadership as shown by their con- cise and complete reports indicate that little !'oom is left for dis- cussion. A few examples will suf- fice. The Library opening has been extended to 11 :00 PM; the Grounds Committee has estab- lished an excellent working rela- tionship with the Administration and have accomplished a great deal thereby; the Constitutions Committee has begun a compre- hensive review of the constitu- tions of student supported organ- izations; N.S.A. has extended its activities and has made availabie material, a study of which will improve many areas o:f student life; the Reading Week Commit- Furthermore, the criticism that discussion should have been elic- ited by Mr. Skloot's Focus report seems uncalled for. His most ade- quate report left no necessity for discusion. Conclusions and rea- sons for lack of student support, as well as future plans were in· eluded therein. Lack of debate and discussion where it is not necessary is not indicative of apathy on the part of the Council members. But poor reports, lack of organization and inefficiency are. In the former case, the case in point, the mere mention of impeachment is absurd. Dean C. Rohrer '62. United Nations General Assembly United Nations New York, New York Gentlemen: In your present attempts tore- solve the critical world situation, we, the members of the Campus Religious Council, representing the students of Union College, urge you to consider the youth of the world upon whose shoulders the world's problems will fall. We await them, we are anxious and willing to solve them, but we need a world in which to do this. To- day, this world is being threat- ened with total destruction. Two major powers have the means with which to challenge our right to live, at a time whe we are first realizing the meaning of this God-granted right. WE DE- MAND THE RIGHT TO LIVE! We urge IMMEDIATE DIS- ARMAMENT under a COM- PLETE inspection plan, begin- ning with an IMMEDIATE SUS- PENSION OF ALL NUCLEAR TESTS!! Let us not allow our irrational natures to exploit and taint the fl'Uits of our rational ventures. Gentlemen, we beseech you to act now, for now is the only time to act. Every second that we fail to move increases the probability of someone, somewhere accident- ally causing the destruction of • our civilization. Union College Campus ·Religious Council Lignon To Retire By Edward Brynes Dr. Ernest M. Ligon, Head of the Psychology Department, will retire from teaching in June. He plans to devote his full time to the Character Research Project, a psychological study of Christian personality, which has been un- der his direction ever since its beginning twenty-five years ago. Dr. Ligon received his Master's degree from Texas Christian Uni- versity and his Ph.D. from Yale. He has studied theology at Yale Divinity School, where he received a Bachelor's degree in Divinity. For a year he was in Europe as a studen.t of child psychology. He has taught at Union since 1929, and during his teaching career, he has been the author of five books; The Psychology of Christian Per- sonality ( 1935), The Future is Now (1939\ A Greater Generation (1948), Dimensions in Character, (1956) and, with a co-author, 'J:he Marriage Climate ( 1962). Dr. Ligon has won national fame as the Director of Character Research Project. He first con· ceived the basic idea of the Pro- ject when he was a senior at Texas Christian University. Its aim is to use the methods of mod- ern psychology to teach children the Christian faith. The CRP co- operates with homes and church schools across the nation in a program of religious education. Most popular and widely used of all CRP resource materials is the chart, \The Growth and ·Develop- ment of· Christian Personality,\ a summary of ,CRP findings. The chart took three years to con- struct. Lilly Endowment, Inc., a chari- table foundation with a chartered interest in religion, has invested over $1,500,000 in the CRP for the lst 20 years, making possible its continual growth and develop- ment. but felt that :a longer stay here \I think that we Britishers have would be necessary tu form any accepted the fact that we arl' no sort of valid opinion.

John ~imom The Best Things In Life Are Free The editors at this time, would like to express their support of Free Love, a vital question in view of the pres- ent political situation, and recent findings in psychiatry. It has been suggested that the only way to beat the Rus- sians is by offering bigger and better equalities, and bigger and better freedoms. What is a more natural sequal to equality of classes than the abolition of private property, and what is more private than a woman? Not only does free love enhance equality, but it offers more freedom. The effects that the immediate promulgation of such a sys- tem would have, was demonstrated by the 18th century utopian settlements, where the participants adopted it with such enthusiasm, that their more puritanical and victorian leaders of the day were forced to close the estab- lishments down. Let us now tum to an equally important question, the subject of the prE!sent rise of neurosis in industrial towns. Recent psychiatrichal investigation has discovered that it is not the high pressured working conditions, nor the crowded living quarters, nor the workings of the economic cycle that has filled the psychiatrists couches, but the closing of the neighborhood Brothels. We have learned from Freud that our basic psychic energy is directed towards sex, Ullfulfillcd sex. Smoking, chewing, playing with things with one's hands, dream· ing, and even eating, are all manifestations of our unrecog- nized, unfulfilled, and unconscious desire for sex. What could be more exhilirating, more gratifying to the spirit and mind of man, than a. \Brave New World\ society, where all frustrations. and depressions are lost in the ris- ing crescendo of \Orgy Porgy.\ For a sane society, and for the release of mankind from his most confining and restrictive force, the editors of the Concordiensis eagerly look forward to the mass application of \oral contracept- ives,\ whose ease of application and efficiency it is hoped, will break the antideluvian forces constraining the spirit. The editors suggest that the Student Council continue to acknowledge their obligations to mankind, as they did in protesting nuclear arming, by sending an equally strong letter to Congress in support of the mass production of \the wonder drug,\ !l.nd the positiv«l atiects -it might bring about. The only alternatives are communism, incest, G<>ld· waterism and Dadaism. Russia and Meet China In Conflict By Eric Toder The reL'ently growing conflict between the Soviet Union and Communist China, now more open than before, may have a gt•eat affert on the future world bal- ance of powe1·. At this time, the West can merely speL'ulate about the extent of the qual.'rel. and its implications; i't is diffi~ult to know what is t·eally going on. However, there nt•e certain trends which have t•ecently ·become more pronounced, especially as a t'e· suit of the recent Communist party Congt·ess. That congt·ess has shown us that there at•e important divisions within the Communist world, as well as within the West- ern wodd. China Strong Force Many Western observers have speculated in l'ecent months that Kh1•ushchev's policy ,of \peaceful co-existence\ has been modified because of Chinese pre~;sure. It is the feeling of these observers that Russia's aggressive actions, such as the resumption of nuclear tests, are in part an attempt to appease Peiping, to satisfy those who may consider Kht·ushchev \soft on capitalism.\ At the Com- munist Party Congress, Khrush· chev certain~y attempted to con- firm that impression. His de- nunciation of Albania was a thin- ly concealed denundation of Red China, and Mao-Tse-Tung was well aware of that. \The com- radeship-in-arms of the Chinese and Albanian people cannot be shaken by any force on earth,\ declared the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist party. General Hoxha of Albania recent· ly asserted that Khrushchev's policy was \revisionist and em- phasized the fact that he had the support of China. It does not really seem that Albania itself is an important issue-the coun- tl·y carries so little weight eco- nomically and militarily that its position is hardly significant. However, it's conflict with Rus- sia is symbolic of Moscow's dis· trust of Chinese influence, and desire to dominate the Commu- nist world. Stalin Denuunced The recent downgrading of Stalin in the Soviet Union fits in closely with this pattern. Khrushchev seems to find it to his advantage to remove all traces of the memory of Stalin, though he himself was once a protege of the late dictator. One may specu- late whether the cause is pri- marily a desire by Khrushchev to gain more personal power, or a desire to reverse some of the harsher policies of Stalin. The latter reason may have some credence, since there has in fact been somewhat of a thaw in Rus- sia since Stalin's 'death. However, the basic pillars of the Soviet dic- tatorship remain unaltered. It is indeed very possible that the re- laxations that have occurred might have occurred under Stalin him- self, and that they are primarily a result of the growing strength of the Soviet economy V<hich has resulted in a demand fot· an im- provement of the standard 'Of liv- ing1 now. The most severe period of early industrialization is over in ~ussia, and more resources can now be devoted to ·consumer goods instead of to the formation of additional capital. In China, the pt·ocess of sacrifiCing one genera- tion for the next is going on right n~~w. This type of policy by its very natut·e must be imple- mented by harsher forms of con- trol. Thus the outlook of the two powet•s is different. Stalin dealt with the same problems that Red China. is facing today and handled them successfully, though un- doubtedly at great cost. The Chi- nese, however, are not deterred by the cost, and thus tend to admire Stalin, and support his surviving followers within the USSR. New Personality Cult The consequences for the West are right now uncertain. Firstly, it would be foolish to be too opti- mistic about the down-grading of Stalin. Khrushchev is himself be- ginning to develop a new \per- sonality cult\ very similar to that which he criticized Satlin for. The fawning adulation which the So- viet press formerly heaped on Stalin is merely being transferred to Khrushchev. Secondly, it is un- foreseeable that the West could split the Soviet-Chinese alliance. The United States, Britain, and France also have differences among them, some of them quite severe (especially with the French), but in a showdown they will stand together against the Communist powers. The one thing that will certainly be affected \Qy these struggles is the foreign pol- icy of the Soviet Ul!ion. Only events will tell whether Russia's policy will become more aggt•es- sive, or will seek to reduce cold war tensions .... President Kennedy stated of the Chinese-Russian rift that he did not think it was \useful\ to assess it at the pres- ent time. \I think we can judge better by actions.\ That will in- deed provide the evidence, and perhaps very soon we will be able to make better judgments. On Reapportio\:~nent By E. M. Tracy Governor Nelson Rockefeller called the Republican dominated New York State Ll'!gislature into special session November 9 and 10 to consider three measures, the most explosive of which was the reapportionment of the state's congressional districts. As a result of the national ce·'sus and Con· gressional action, New York lost two of its forty-three seats in the House of Representatives, Pres- ently, the Democrats dominate the New York delegation 22-21. Un- der the recently approved plan, the Republicans hope to upset the scales with a '25-16 edge come next November. Districts Consolidated the political game, the Democrats are squawking ~gout\ \Rockyman- dering,\ poltical infamy, .and dis- regard for the will of the people. Legislative minority leader Jo- seph Zaretski called it a scheme to send Republican reactionaries to Congress to help scuttle the Kennedy program. Mayor Robert Wagner of New York has threat- ened to test the constitutionality of the reapportionment plan in court. One of those shouting the loud- est is Samuel Stratton, and for good reason. Although he has an- nounced that he will run for re- election to Congress, Stratton has been actively seeking support for the Democratic Party's gubina- torial nomination. Stratton feels that Rockefeller is heatable and that this most recent Republican move will boomerang through popular indignation. Giants Battle It seems very unlikely that the courts will upset the New York reapportionment bill. It would ap- pear that New York will witness Friday, November 17, 1961 Fraternities: Racial Discrimination By James Strosberg Within the past twelve months, both the Board of Trustees of Union College and the Interfra- ternity Council passed resolutions condemning religious and racial discrimination in. fratemity char- ters. Neither body has since taken action to enforce their high sound- ing and big worded a(!ts of hot air, and there still exist fraterni~ ties on the Union College campus which have discriminatory clauses in their constitutions. The cowardly hypocrisy of the Board of Trustees and the IFC is not the topic of this essay, however. Their actiuns along with those of other \do good\ groups have not made any significant accomplishment in the struggle to end discdmination. Resolu- tions and the like are rabble-- rousing and succeeded only in pouring more oil on the fire. All Houses Not Prejudice The Cuncordiensis frequently publishes accounts from the news• papers of other colleges, report· ing that local chapters of national fraternities have been dissolved on their individual campus for not complying to Trustee or IFC rulings to rescind objectional clauses. This has not done one iota of good in eliminating prej- udice. Bias which, in the few and far between cases it actually exists ·on American college cam. puses, has been built up over long ,periods of years, and a few ar- chaic and affluent gentlemen can- not end it in a few seconds rais· ing t}leir hands at a Board of Trustees' meeting. Ending discrimination clauses does not end discrimination. There are three fraternities on campus known to have \White Christian\ chapters or their alumni· groups. Indeed·, many boys who would not be acceptable to· the nationals have not only been initiated as bJ,\others J:,ut also have been elected to high office. To make these fraternities! who practice no discrimin!!,tion 1 give Up their national affiliations, would be to punish unfairly t:he active and alumni members of the chapters. There are also two other fra- ternities on camp11s, which while having no discriminatory clauses in their constitutions, are forced by their alumni grollps to reject students of -certain racial and re- ligious backgrounds. If these fra· ternity groups were to go against the wishes of their alumni, they would be faced with financial ·dis- aster. After all, .these boys are eoncerned with acb.ieving ·a satis- factory scholastic record and maintaining a \go<>d\ fraternity, not with ending discrimination on the Union College campus: It would be unfair to antagonize these groups because. of their alumni. Discriminating lfouses Suffer Those houses which actually practice discrimination, regard- less of constitutional or alumni pressures are to b~ pitied. In can only be pointed ()Ut that these groups are only the worse for their ignorant intolerance. Those fraternities, which discriminate in rushing, are ()n]y \cutting off their noses to spitE their faces.\ Fire cannot be fo11gilt with fire. Understanding and enlightenment are needed, not resolutions by the Board of Trustees, or the IFC, or the United Nations or even by the Almighty Himself. clauses in their national constitu- Roux dermintitas (scientific tions. In two of these ·houses, terminology, for poison ivy, has there is absolutely no bias or recently been reported on the Un- prejudice of any kind in the local ion Campus.

According to the Joint Legis- lative Committee on Reapportion· ment, two Democratic districts were slated for elimination, in· cluding the thirty-second which includes Schenectady county and is represented by Sam Stratton. Portions of this district were in- cluded in three other districts. The Committee made a policy of keep- ing within 15% of the average district population of 409,326. Other districts were changed by linking doubtful areas with safe Republican territory. The most controversial district under the new plan is the thirty-fifth, which stretches a hundred and eithy miles across eight counties in the middle of the state. Robert Quigley, vice-chairman of the Reapportionment C om m i t tee, states that these counties were connected to consolidate rural areas, xather than tacking these areas to urban. ones. a political battle of the giants in the next year.

As a result or the reappor- tionment, it would seem likely that Representative Stratton has been pushed, not unwilling i~to a no-holds-barred contest W1th presidential aspirant Nelson Rockefeller for the governorship of New York.
