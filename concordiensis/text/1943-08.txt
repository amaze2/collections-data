STUDENT ELECTIONS lt seems to be ve1·y unfortunate that college students in positions of importance cannot be trusted to carry out their duties in an impartial and efficient manner. The manner in which the freshman class elections were held was a travesty on both democracy and student government. We would like to state here that we are in no way criti- cizing the orders or plans of the United States Navy for its Naval trainees. We ue simply commenting upon a schedule which has been drawn up and which 1nust be foliowed by some 240 civilians and the way that schedule affects then:1. That and nothing more than that. A senior member of the Student Council was in charge of the elections, and did not see fit to supervise the affair close- ly enough to insUl'e against fraudulent votes or \stuffing of the ballot box.\ The prime mi~.take lay in placing the ballot forms on all seats occupied by the freshman class in Daily Assembly. Even a freshman k1:ows that the11e are some who cut chapel every day, and certainly a senior should be cog- nizant of that elementary fact. .Most of us realized long before the school calendar came out that the college authorities would have many a p1·oblem to overcome in arranging a suitable schedule for the year's work. Therefore, the paucity of vacations granted caine cer- tainly not as a complete .surprise. That we had been granted only a two day vacation for Christmas, howeve1·, gave us a much ruder shock than we had expected. Thu.s, provided with the opportunity to secure more than one ballot, certain unscrupulous frosh procee-ded to fill out ballots, justifying their illegal actions by stating that they we1·e merely voting for certain of their friends who cut chapel that day. Had those collecting the ballots been on the alert, they would have caught the culprits, and destroyed their ballots. However, at least one Council member was seen accepting more than one ballot from a freshman, with the fl'Osh's assurance that they were absentee ballots. This action is not onlr negligent, it is a violation of the trust placed on his shoulders by the students who elected him to his respon- sible position. We did not look fo1·ward to a holiday on Labor Day. It always seemed somewhat enigmatic to us, anyhow, just why people had to have a. day off to celebrate the fact that the next day they had to go back to work. Having to attend classes on Thanksgiving didn't seem too nmch to ask, for we believe that being allowed to go to college in times like these That student elections have been crooked before is cer- tain; ballot boxes have been stuffed, and those counting votes have not always been strictly honest. Usually, in the past, there has been a tragic lack of interest in student elections and the pecadilloes of those who were an1bitions enough t~ perpetrate illegalities were rather consciously ignored. In this particular case, the commendable action of two freshmen has caused enough commotion that at their instigation a peti- tion has been drawn up, and signed by over half of the fresh- man class, requesting a new vote. That this new vote should be granted is mandatory upon the Student Council if it wishes to save any vestiges of prestige and power. Should the Student Council fail to grant a reelection, it might as well say to the student body, \We do not think that stud- ent gove1·nment is important. Please elect a new Council, since we do not have any sense of responsibility.\ GYM CLASS is certainly something· to be very thankful for. Approx:ii:nate- ly a week between each term, it was pointed out to us, was the maximum which we could expect, and so that, too, n1et with acceptance. However, after talking with many people and getting various opinions, it still seemed to us that a two day vacation at Christmas is a little bit too harsh. We personally know several people who will be unable to even get home because there will not be enough time. Many of us will reach horne and will probably have to tum right around .again and head back to Schenectady. If at all possible, we .believe that everyone should be able to go home for Chnstmas. Perhaps the biggest argument in favor of an ex- tended Christmas recess i.s that it would provide a very neces- sary \break\ in the t·outine of college life-that continu::tl studying, reading, and concentration. To be trite-All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy; all study and no play make~ Jack a duller boy yet in our opinion. Even with longer va.catwns, to anyone who takes his work seriously, and cer- tamly most of us in college in these times are serious minded the college year is a \grind\. Under abnormal conditions' under step?ed up programs, we believe that an interim her~ and there IS much more imperative. Any constructive criticism should provide a solution to the problem wh~ch .it attempts to comment upon.

Additi<>nal athletics during each tJnsuing year brought the fee to higher and higher levels. By 1933, it was about $40 a year. It was in that year oE depression that a \re- volt\ aga.inst tpe \expense and ap- parent waste\ of the fee took place. GUERRA•s PHA~MACY 600 Union Street THE GAZETTE PRESS Printer.s Student Council .app0inted a com- mittee to investiga:te the situation. A measure was passed designating a Tax Committee. The Tax Com- mittee would decide which organi- zations were worthy of receiving al- lotments and then would determine h0w much each organization would 1 eceive. In 1936 the CouncH voted to let the college ta-ke over athletics. The tuition was then raised to cover the expense of athletics while the non-athletic tax fee became about $12.

The announcement of the. Navy, however, that it would wel- come participation by trainees here: gave the extra-curricular program, a shot in the arm. The Tax Committee decided that $2,000 would be needed to cover the; needs of the 500 Navy men and 250' civilians here. The four dollar fee· drew a response that tremendously exceeded expectations. Apprentice Seaman Bob LaPann's address in the Memorial Chapel to his fellow trainees urging subscriptions was believed to have contributed to a great degree to this favorable Navy reaction. \I think it is a good thing to lreep student activities going in wartime,\ Professor Bennett said. \Only then will the fellows that are here come close to having a really normal college life.

Plans have already been laid to have \The Garnet\ in the hands of the student ·body be- tore the end of this semester. Though no appointments have as yet been made, J. Robert LaPann, A/S, has been elected temporary chairman ·by the candidates for the yearbook's staff. No one has been named to the board and any one who wishes to go out for any position is invited to be present at the next meeting Cof candidates on Tuesday evening at 8 o'clock. Those who have al- I eady gone out for the book are John Pelletier, J.

The plans call for a yearbook of three parts. The first part will pre- sent the past history of the col- ;ege in words and pictures. Then 'The Garnet\ will present the pic- ture of the college today. 'Following this section will be one showing the individual picture of evel'y student now attending Unic.n. Any student who has photographs of campus activities and buildings is requested to notify Mrs. Davies m the Student Activities Office of his pictures. The photographs will then be reviewed and the best pic- tures will be chosen. The owners of thesa pictures will be reimbursed if their work is used. - .. --o----- fire Alarm Installed; lneffeef.uaf qt Drill After much searcl!ing and after numerous headache$, the Colle;;~ has procured a rather uniq\ue co.n- traption to warn those living on campus of a fire. The College was faced with the problem of getting scmething which would be loud enough for everyone. tG hear, but which would not sound I ilto an ai!'- I aid signal, the chapel bells. the Alco whistle, or the reveille siren. They at last procured a loc•:motive tire (the metal disk weldc,l around tr.e locomotive whe!), \Which was put on the corner green near the Boiler House. In tha .event of a fire, the seaman on duty in the In- firmary will have the task of strik- ing the alarm. A fire drill was held last Monday evening for the first time in the memory of any students here at college, at which time the new fire alarm was tested. At the ringing of the alarm, all students. previously mstructed as to the correct behav- ior, filed out of theh· respective dorms, and waited for the signal to return.

Announces Class Elections The l'esults of the junior and freshman class elections were an- nounced by Klarman, and the hope was expressed that the sophomore class would settle their squabble about the mode of election soon so that there might be full council ~epresentation. Deferment of the election of per- manent officers has been consider- (d mandatory until the vacancies in the council could be filled. With the exception of the sophomore class president, all seats are now illled. Klarman announced that there would be strict enfo1·cement of the. constitutional rule that all mem- bers must attend every meeting. Any member absenting himself from any meeting without having )Jcen exc;=used is liable for expulsion from the council. Announcement of the next meet- ing, which will be held in Old Chapel week aftE>r next, will be made in the usual manner; post- cards will be sent to each mem- ber, and announcement will be made in Daily Assembly. -----0------ DISCUSS MILITARY TRAINING The Empire State Town Meeting of the Air will feature a discus- sion of the Swiss system of univer- sal military training at 2 p.m. this Sunday.

The answer to \how old are men in the Navy?\ has been determin- l ~d in a recent survey. I This tabulation show-ed that 19 per cent of the personnel are un- der the age of 20 years. The largest single group are those 21 years of age; they account for 11 per cent. The next largest are the 22-year-olds; they comprise 10 per cent. Five per cent are 25; 2'k per cent are 30; 1 per cent are 35; 1 per cent are 40; and only one-tenth per cent are 45 years or older. It's a young man's liravy. EE~~-E~F~iA~;~EAT I Lieut.

Mayor Mills Ten Eyck will ac- cept the center on behalf of the city at dedication ceremonies which will be held in the structure at 8 p.m. Wednesday. A score of ci;nc and military notable in the vicimty of Schenectady will attend the in- ougural fete. Lieutenant Commander Horner and his staff as well as Lieutenant Cowles will be the guests of the USO at the dedication, representin2,' respectively the V-12 and V-5 units at Union College. Several Army and Navy officers in this vicinity as well as some WAVES are ex- pected to attend. The formal opening of the cen- ter climaxes several months of in- tensive activity by the General Citizens Committee. Conversion of the old Union-Star building at 205 Clinton Street into the center was accomplished with a minimum of structural changes, the major change being an im- provement of the entrance. Instal- lation of new fixtures and a gen- eral overhauling of walls, floors and stairways is virtually completed. While the Schenectady War Chest furnished the funds for the rehabilitation of the building, the equipment is being supplied by the Hey Fellows ! Both Civilians and V-12's national USO.

Tr~at the center as another home. And don't hesitate to make suggestions for its improve- ment. We are here to serve you and will welcome all criticism.\ The center will be open daily from nine in the morning to four the following morning, a 19 hour period. Both civilian war workers and military men will be welcome tiuring all hours. However, war workers will pay for the socials they attend, while service men will be admitted gratis to all social affairs at the center. The snack bar and the game rooms will be staffed mainly by volunteers. The paid employees, be- sides Director Hall, will include Building Superintendent 0. J. Boehm, an assistant director to be chosen shortly, and Miss Hilde- g-arde Brown, stenographer. The hanging of draperies and curtains has been undertaken by four local womens' organizations: the Albany Street Methodist Wom- en, the State Street Presbyterian Church Ladies, the Catholic Daugh- ters of America. and the Jewish Hadassah Society. -----0•---- • Tip Top 9uality CHINA \We Need Your Head in I N N § WEBS SPEAKS 'SUNDAY - Our Business\ Helmer Webb, Librarian of 129 JAY STREET Specialists in Chinese and American Cooking !

It has not been the Commandmg Officers of the V-12 Unit who have set up rules, .but the U.S.O. local committee. May I state further that in the future, all the dances which have been held at Union College are now tu be held at the U.S.O. club. Regards the movies on Sunday evenings; I talked with D:·. Rox last Sunday evening con- cerning this question and I told him that I have no objection to the civilian students attending the movies. However, we are not al- lowed to show these movies to civilians and we might encounter difficulty with the local moving picture houses by admitting civili- ans to the movies. If this objec- tion arises. we will have to stop the movies being· shown to the Mili- tary on the campus and bring that program to the U.S.O. club also. I am in sympathy with the fact that we are all in this great ef- fort to win the war but National rules limit our service. outs. The beginning of the RED period of a daytime alert wiH be indicated by 3 rings on the class :bells in addi- tion to the ca·mpus whistle which will blow a series of short blasts. One ring on the bell system wHI in- dicate the 'all clear'. 3. The Building Warden will di- rect students to the safety zone in the building when the RED period begins. Classes should continue dur- ing the BLUE period. 4. Students may move about the campus during the warning or BLUE period of daytime alerts. They should move promptly so that they can reach a building or shelter zone before the RED period begins. Do not move about the campus dur- ing RED period. Blackouts 1. All campus lights should be ex- tinguished on hearing the first or blue signal. Necessary lights may show in the Naval Infirmary dur- ing this period. If you would care to talk with me at some length concerning this matter. I am at your service. 2·. Essential pedestrian traffic will be permitted .during the BLUE period, though in general it will be better to avoid walking aJbout the campus. 3. No student should be on the campus during the RED period. 4. If you are caught in the dining funct for the duration.

Joint civilian-trainee smokers, with refresh- ments and all the other colorful aspects of a collegiate smoker, would be bound to catch on. Nor are these the only possibilities. Student Council, made up of the elected l'epresentatives of both groups ,bears the burden of responsibility in this matter. The Student Council must take the initiative in sponsoring joint social affairs. With the semester half over already, there is little time to lose. How about an affair in September?

Al Kilbey, ,pitching for the victorious Red Sox, ac- counted persona:lly for nine of the twelve possible outs. His .pitching, although at times precarious, proved to be the winRing factor in the game. The fielding of the Tigers was to be com·mended in most of the £pots, ,but failed to cope with the s•lugging Red' Sox who ·bunched their hits and drove all available men across the home plate. ·Other results of this week's games are as follows: Tuesday found the Red Socx downing the Dodgers 7-2; while the Tigers nosed out the Cards by the score of 20-7. Thursday follow·ed with the vic- tory of the Red Socx over the Tig- ers 9 to 2. The remaining games were forfeits.
