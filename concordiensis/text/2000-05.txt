When he reached the end of the runway, however, he placed his backpack on the ground, and pulled his partner, Sarah Gauvreau, out of the bag. She was also wear- ing EMS clothing. Other memorable moments in- cluded Freshman Pooja Kothari leading her partner, Senior Dave Madden, down the runway with his tie in her hand, curling her fin- gerathim. Another highlight was when Eu- gene Schultz walked down the run- way solo, only to fmd four giggling girls in short bathrobes following him DJ Rob was in charge of the mu- sic for this year's Fashion Show. Unfortunately, he did not make it to the show on saturday night. He had come to the rehearsal that afternoon and at the time Kaier be- lieved that DJ Rob would be play- iug. J:!te rnusic that night. However, as the fashion show began, it was not DJ Rob in charge, but one of his assic;tants. Kaier attributed the problems with the music during the show, including songs played at wrong times and the inability of the audience to here the MC's over the music, to the fact that OJ Rob was not in atten- dance. A totalofforty-fourmodelspar- ticipated in the show, modeling fashions from twelve different stores including Limbo Lounge. American Outpost, Christopher's (which donates mens wear every year,) Old Navy, EMS, Circles, Ragged Mountain, Lifestyles in Saratoga, a boutique in Boston. Todd Oldham in New York. and Calypso in East Hampton and New Ymk. Kaier explained that in order to obtain clothing from these stores, the committee started organizing in the fall. The conunittee members go into the stores, explain what they are doing, indicate that it is for charity and a great opportunity for free advertising for the stores. Since many stores are chains, individual stores can not decide whether to donate clothing. The decision must be made by the chain • s corporate headquarters. \It used to be a lot easier to get stores to donate their clothes, but now this kind of this is more popu- lar,\ Kaier said.

Although Anna survives the Holocaust, damaging genealogical information from her family's past materializes and .torments her, put- ting her daughter's life as well as her own in significant danger This dramatic performance was full of twists and turns, resulting in an intricate and shocking plot. Discovering what the snow people represented and how closely they were related to Anna was a web untangled as the story concluded. Realizing no one is what they appeared to be is the key to this incredible work of fiction. Snow People is rooted in the true history oflnlender's grandfa- ther and Uncle Benjamin's oppos- ing strategies to save the family . Intender extends his work of fic- tion into present day, and creates an astonishing conclusion, which includes an underworld of Aus- trian Nazis and their mob like ac- tivities. The audience was moved by Femhoffs emotional performance and the evident hnnd she has with the play.

Campus News ®nnwrhleu!l!lis • May 4, 2000 • Page 3 Ex-Skinhead Spe·aks at Union by Mary Felton News Editor At twenty-five years of age, Frank Meeink, a former skinhead, has had more life experience than many students at Union will ever have. He had been in a mental hospital for attempted suicide, arrested multiple times, placed in a \super max\ prison, and fathered a child all by the age of seventeen. His visit to Union last Wednes- day night was both irtsightful and frightening. Meeink gave a com- pelling story ofhis life before and after he joined the ranks of the skinheads. Meeink was the product of a broken.home; his father was a drug-dealer and his mother's boy- friend was an abusive alcoholic. Frank Meeink, former .skinhead, speaks to a full house at Nott. During his years in junior high school, Meeink moved in and out of both his parents' homes, cut classes and started trouble in his ltead and was given a pair of Doc Martin boots. Supposedly only real skinheads have Doc Martin boots. school.

It was important for the Meeink's sect of skinheads to have influence in the Klan. Meeink was able to recruit forty lcids from his middle school to join the Klan. Meeink pointed out to the audi- ence that there are in fact many dif- ferent types of skinheads. Meeink's group aimed some hos- tility trnwards SHARP skinheads, who were skinheads against rac- ism. Mednk's association with the Ku KI11x Klan was short-lived due PSI U Gets Dunked by KristenZadourian News Editor UCARE sponsored the annual carnival this past Saturday in Achil- les Rink from lOAM to 4PM. The event was funded by Stu- dent Activities and several differ- ent organizations on campus. · Senior Caroline Hepner and Jun- ior Chad Roberts were in charge of the entire event for the day-. Several tables and activities were set up for the children of Schenectady and surrounding neighborhoods. Some of the activities that were available included: Throw-a-pie at a Gamma Phi, making Tie Dye T- shirts, a Dunk Tank, a double dutch contest, face painting, and toss the ball for a goldfish. Furthermore, there was a BBQ popcorn and cotton candy for all of the kids and families to enjoy. According to Hepner, the most popular events of the day were the dunk contest and the baH toss for goldfish. Psi Upsilon graciously gave their services to the dunk tank af- ter reporting the disappointing news that the animals and their trainers had cancelled at the last minute. Furthermore, Sigma Chi dressed like clowns and entertained the children the entire day. Brothers ofSigmaChi were also responsible for the sports that were_ available. Cotton candy a11d snow cones are enjoyed by all ages. They provided soccer and.bockey as the two main sporting events. Hepner noted that there were close to one hundred kids at the event. She further commented, .,I think that the kids had a good time and that is the most important thing. A lotof activities were avail- able which many kids would not li<Jrmally be able to partake in un- less they were free.\ Hepner praised the groups on campus that came out to help with the event, saying, \The participa- tion from the groups that showed up was gooti, and consideriug we went to a lot of the organizations at the last minute I think a lot of people went out of their way to triake it a success.\ Hepner noted that this year the budget for UCAREwas lower than last year and as a result, the carni- val was forced to continue with- out Mr. Bouncy Bounce, the big- gest attraction of the carnival last year. In cconclusion, Hepner thanked all of the organizations who par- took in the carnival and who will- ingly donated money from their budgets for the events. \We had close to 100 children whiclh was a terrific turnout con- sidering the weather we were com- peting with.\ to a :fight that broke out at a club sponsoring a p-arty for an Animal Rights group. Meeink' s skinhe!lds were kicked out of the Klan, because the Klan claimed they were '\'giving them a bad name.\ Meeink 's life was on a downward slope,. having now dropped out of school and been kicked out ofboth his parents' homes. He was now running the PhiladeLphia chapter of skinhe_ads. Tattoos are a sort of status sym- bol' for skinheads. Meeink ex- plained the significance of the spi- der tattoo,. which you get on your elbow if you have killed someone. It looks especially good if some- one in your crew kills someone. At fifteen years old Meeink was living in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in a rented house. Six out of the fifteen people liviag in his house were wanted for murder. During his five years as a skinhead, Meeink estimated he had committed close to three hun- dred acts ofvi<)lence. In addition to attacking racial minorities, Meeink and his fellow skinheads persecuted homosexu- als. Skinheads are not allowed to do drugs of any kind, so drinking was big part oftheirlives. After being arrested for the first time, Meeink headed to Indianapolis where, af- ter some time, he tried to kill him- s~lf. He was then sent to a mental hospital from which he escaped in order to' evade the police. After evading the police once again, Meeink settled in Spring- field, Illinois, where he became a \'local hero\ in.that he was written up in the city paper every week. Reverting to his previous habits, he began recruiting the local youth to join up with him. With this increasing celebrity, Meeink was contacted by Tom Mesker, who ran a white. Aryan race resistance out in California and who had a television show. He gave Meeink some advice, which in turn led Meeink to pro- duce and start a television show of his own. As a result <Jfhis new shawl the number of recruits he liad went from fo11r to forty. At the young age of seventeen, Meeink and some skinhead friends made the mistake of putting one of their beatings on videotape. They traded the tape to get tat- toos and the tape fell into the hands of the authorities when the tattoo shop was raided. Having fled Springfield for a short period of time, Meeink de- cided to return only to be arrested by an undercover cop. Meeink was placed in a \super rn.ax\ county prison where he, along with the other inmates, was allowed outside for one hour each Satur- day. Surprisingly enough, the Bible helped Meeink through his time behind bars. He and other in- mates. of different ethnicity started to join together for nightly Bible study classes where they prayed for each other in hopes that their trials would go well. Originally, Meeink's sentence was set for fifteen to twenty years. but he was able to fight it down to three to five years instead. At sev- enteen he was off to State Prison. While in Prison, Meeink found ways to make use ofhis time. He participated in prison sports teams and began to realize that he and his fellow skinhead inmates had no reason to hate. Upon his release from prison, Meeink attempted to visit his now five-month-old daughter. His <laughter's mother would not let him see his child because she claimed he had not changed his ways. Meeink then returned to Phila- delphia and saw the close- mindedness of the skinheads of which he had been a part. He began to detach himself from them and worked in a warehouse for a Jewish man who soon became a father figure to him. He began speaking to universi- ties and organizations after his story compelled a panel oflawyers ·and judges. He came before this panel due to a tip he gave the Fed- eral Bureau oflnvestigation regard- ing the Oklahoma City bombing. Now, at the age of twenty-five, Meeink is still working in the ware- house in addition to having orga- nized a junior league hockey pro- gram through the Philadelphia Fly- ers. Since the creation of this pro- giam, the number of kids partici- pating has grown from twenty to 120. Meeink ended his speech by saying, \ What goes around comes around,\ in reference to getting what he deserved. Meeink was asked to speak by Union College's Speakers' Forum.

The committee also re-nominates people who particip~ted in the show in past years.

AsKaier explained, \A lot ofthe fun for the models is meetmg other 'j)eople from a diverse group.\ After a brief introduction by Pro- fessor Byron Nichols, lyer started by explaining how he has lived his life traveling. He was born to In- dian parents in Ellgland, lived in California, and was schooled in England.

This in- cluded a trend today towards a big- ger rather than smaller world be- cause with the new culture clash, the differences are becoming more apparent than the similarities. lyer mainly referred to the air- plane and how it metaphorically acts as \borderless a;nd floating· world. Home is something portable - an inner shrine.\ The airplane, he said, represented a new \global lifestyle - traveling five miles above the continents.\ There is a new species of people, lyer being one of them, who are embracing the life of the traveler. In researching for his newly re• Ieased book, Iyer spent a week in the Los Angeles airport. Airports represent a second metaphor in this changing world in that they are, \'cities of the future.\ Read- ing an excerpt from his novel, Iyer explained that the \most passion- ate, emotional, and intimate mo- ments occur in public in airports. People are sleepwalking, not quite waking and not quite dreaming, in a state of suspended animation.\ This new travel lifestyle also ere- . ates a barrier of communication.

J ·I Campus News <a:Ott.C.or.bi~tnsis • May 4, 2000 • Page 5 TEAR Performs at Chet's by Gina L. Campanella Opinions Editor Often life is unpredictable and situations become victim to circum-. stance. One musical group who ha~ l~aiP.ed this lesson all top well in the recent past is the bandTear.- This group.; comprised of five men, has known one another for the majority of their lives. They all grew up together in. Saratoga Springs. The ba.I).d'smembers include Ed,. the singer, Scott, who pl,ays the banjo and the guitar, Dave, who plays rhythm a:q.d guitar, Zeus, the bass player, and Pete the dtun:nner. The members all began their mu- sical careers in different bands. Until this point, none·ofthe band's members had ever played. together formally. Theydescribetheirprior musical interaction as \just jam- ming.\ However, as circumstanc·e, would have it, alloftbeir individual bands broke up around the same time. At this point, they decided . to form their new band. The group decided to form the band Tear roughly eight months ago, a,nd for the first time all of the Members ofTearbroadcastfrom WRUC1:nfore their performance. men were ina band together. Origi- nally, one major reason they had neverplayed togefuer before was because of their varied musical in- terests, _which include metal, blues ' and country. However, in spite of this musical variation they dedded to draw upon their varied Ollisical experi- ence, Their youngest member is nineteen, while tlleir oldest is twenty-eight. This age _span and compilation of diff-erent musical talents creates a souml that is fresh and unique. They describe their music as, a type of\poprock with a blues grass flair.\ Their current tour is tc promote their first album, which they jnst spent three months f:n the studi<J' completing. The album is self-titled and the band hopes for a September re- lease. However, for a preview of this NC_. UR in Monta_-- na . - . - - - band's talent, two of their singles are already on store shelves. These singles include \Close My Eyes'' with the side B track \Love is Revenge\ and \Don't Mind Me with the side B track Mystery.\ These songs are some of the band's favorites as well as some early favorites of their ah·eady 'loyal fans. When asked what inspired these men to create music, the response was unaniruuus. They have all been playing since their youth and were inspired to continue as adults. They described their youthful in- terest in music as a way for wild kids to release some of their en- ergy in a positive manner. The youngest member of the group, Pete, credits his father for his love of music. His father was a music collector, and as a result Pete grew up listening to and learning to appreciate all kinds of music. When asked which other band' Tear most admires, the men unani- mously agreed that Led Zeppelin was a favorite. Tear credits the formation of their band with the desire to create a new sound. They felt the need to abandon their singular genres in order to ·combine their talents and create something unique. In this en- deavor they have definitely suc- ceeded. Their song, \Love is Revenge\ draws lyrically on personal experi- ence and their unique combination of instruments is refreshing in a time of eighteen. year old synthe- sized pop stars. Last Thursday night the band played at Union College in Chet's. The show began at 9:30 PM and the turnout was definitely favor- able. One student raved, \Tear was really cool, they were a perfect band to play in Chefs. Thanks to WRUC for finally getting a good band to play at Union!\ Hopefully we will be able to look back in a few years and reminisce about how we had one of the most popular bands· in the country play at Union before they went big. If you missed the show on cam- pus it is not too late! Tear will be playing tonight, May 4 at Valen- tines in Albany. Unable make it?

Page 6 · May 4, 2000 • Citllltt.ar.bient:Si~ • Online Media With the current trend in technology, most notably the Internet,. com- panies and individuals, as well as the government, are constantly seek- ing the newest and freshest manner in which i1 may be applied. Some of these include computers that respond to vocalcommands, online voting in elections, and a shift from printed to online media. Clearly voice operated computers would be extremely useful, espe- cially to the handicapped. In addition, it is highly probably that online voting would increase voter turnout. The last area, however, is one which recently has entered·the reab.n of mainstream cottnnerce andwbich Concordiensis feels ·should not necessarily be embraced wholeheart- edly. Just weeks ago, best-s.elling author Stephen King released his latest · work solely in a format which must be downloaded toa computer. While . readers are still free to generate a hard copy themselves, no print version was available for purchase in bookstores. While Mr. King has spoken at . length about how much he feels that it is the future of publication, Concordiensis disagrees. The impracticality of bringing a computer, even a laptop, to the many various locations that one would bring a book, such as the beach or even to bed, demonstrate the shortsighted- ness of this latest \advance.\ In fact, it would not be inaccurate to classify this as an unfortunately overzealous and unnecessary use of modem technology, though with good intentions. Similarly, a common suggestion to Concordiensi.s is that we revert to · a purely online format, the most frequent reason being that we could eliminate printing costs while maintaining readership. This is simply not the case. The very concept that an equal number ()f individuals would· read a newspaper online as would pick one up from a newsstand is · ludicrous. In addition, all the arguments presented for printed novels apply to newspapers and magazines. The size of a newspaper and the ease with which it may be transported makes it the idealsource of infor- mation for millions ofcommuters worldwide. This value would be lost with strictly online versions of the world's print me<l.ia. While clearly it is advantageous to have the ability, by simply turning on a computer, to access all the major newspapers in tb.e world, in no way should this replace the very newsprint that has.defined freedom of speech in the United States for two hundred and twenty-four years. In an age when televised media lias become increasingly sensationalistic, we are left with only the print media as a. source of true journalism. Concordiensis does not claim that newspapers and magazines are the· ideal to be sought in a world of scandal ... seeking broadcast journalists, however let us not look back on this as a defming moment in our history, when the last true news outlets were abandoned in favor of what was perceived to be \progress.\ Another effect of purely onlip.e media is that there would be a distinct decrease in the historical value of newspapers and books. There is clearly a certain level of sentimental value in seeing a first edition of a classic novel. There is also value in reading The New Y\ork Times Great Stories of the Century, which would not have the same.effect if it did not include reproductions of the original newsprint. All this would be lost with an online media. The slowly building shift from printed volumes to their online coun- terparts is just another example of the growing trend away from the actual and toward the virtual. While we further develop the Internet into the truly useful tool that may well dominate cur society in the decades to come, let us not forget that just because something is p(}ssible does not mean that it is preferable. -MSM ED ·page·a,Ro' .· .· ...... ·.. •·. . .. ·_· before ·publication:.: tetlers. n1u.&t.b~1~s~, ~~ai:spo_. _. · .. ···• •··.· ·.. · • Journalistic Integrity Questioned Dear Editors: [ was extraordinarily disap- pointed to open last week's Concordiensis. I have never seen such a blatant misuse of a public forum as the \Top Ten List\ which mentioned a student by name and several groups of students as rea- sons to take self-defense classes. The Concordiensis, its writers, and editors have a responsibility to uphold journalistic standards. Dragging astudent'sname (as well as the name of other groups) through the mud is a complete mis- use of the power of the press, no matter what these people may have done in the past. I am amazed at the complete lack of journalistic in- tegrity displayed by the writer o£ the Top Ten list, as wellas the edi- tc;lrS who approved the publication of such an article. I hope that, in the future, the writers and editors will make more mature i!nd intelli- gent decisions as to the material published. Sincerely, Heather Campbell OPtED Guy ~,uir-rels. ~·fJJ\~- Concordiensis Open Response to Critici:sm Concordiensis would like to aake tbis opportunity to respond 1t0r t11e issue raised by Heather Campbell and other .members of ike Union College community Je:garding last week's top ten list i'he list. entitled \Top Ten ReasQns That Union Women Should Voluntarily Invest In Self- D-efense Classes,\ appeared in the Features section and was compiled by members of the Erli.toria1 Board.

Page 6 8 May 4, 2000 · <thnn::orhlett!!Jt!!J Online Media With the current trend in technology. most notably the Internet, com- panies ami individuals, as well as the government, are constantly seek- ing the nev<.e:>t and freshest manner in which it may be applied. Some of these include computers that respond to vocal commands, online voting in elections, and a shift from printed to online media. Clearly voice operated computers would be extremely u.seful, espe- cially to the handicapped. In addition, it is highly probably that online voting wo1ild increase voter turnout. The last area, however~ is one which recently has entered the realm of mainstream conunerce anc:l which Concvrdie11sis feels should not necessarily be embraced wholeheart- · edly. Just weeks ago, best-selling author Stephen King released his latest work solely in a format which must be downloaded to a computer. While readers are still free to generate a hard copy themselves, no print version was available for purchase in bookstores. While Mr. King has spoken at length about how much he feels that it is the future of publication, Concordiensis disagrees. The impracticality of bringing a computer, even a laptop, to the many various locations that one would bring a book, such as the beach or even to bed, demonstrate the shortsighted- ness of this latest \advance.\ In fact, it would not be inaccurate to classify this as an unfortunately overzealous and unnecessary use of modem technology, though with good intentions. Similarly, a common suggestion to Concordiensis is that we revert to a purely online format, the most frequent reason being that we could eliminate printing costs while maintaining readership. This is simply not the case. The very concept that an equal number of individuals would read a newspaper online as would pick one up from a newsstand is ludicrous. In addition, all the arguments presented for printed novels apply to newspapers and magazines. The size of a newspaper and the ease with which it may be transported makes it the ideal source <Jf infor- mation for millions of commuters worldwide. This value would be lost with strictly online versions of the world's print media. While clearly it is advantageous to have the ability, by sirnply turning on a computer, to access all the major newspapers in the world, in no way should this replace the very newsprint that has defined freedom of speech in the United States for two hundred and twenty-four years. Ill an age when televised media lias become increasingly sensationalistic, we are left with only the print media as a source of true journalism. Concordiensis does not claim that newspapers and magazines are the ideal to be sought in a world of scandal-seeking broadcast journalists, however let us not look back on this as a defming moment in our history, when the last true news outlets were abandoned in favor of what was perceived to be \progress.\ Another effect of purely online media is that there would be a distinct decrease in the historical value of newspapers and books. There is clearly a certain level of sentimental value in seeing a first edition of a classic novel. There is also value in reading The New York Times Great Stories of the Century, which would not have the same effect if it did not include reproductions of the original newsprint. All this would be lost with an online media. The slowly building shift from printed volumes to their online coun- terparts is just another example of the growing trend away from the actual and toward the virtual. While we further develop the Internet into the truly useful tool that may well dominate our society in the decades to come, let us not forget that just because something is possible does not mean that it is preferable. -MSM L P 1 .. ·&. n··· 1 ·- · etter .· o tcy ·_· · tsc.

Journalistic Integrity Questioned Dear Editors: 1 was extraordinarily disap- pointed to open last week's Concordiensis. I have never seen such a blatant misuse of a public forum as the \Top Ten List\ which mentioned a student by name and several groups of students as rea- sons to take self-defense classes. The Concordiensis, its writers, and editors have a responsibility to uphold journalistic standards. Dragging a student's name (as well as the name of other groups) tluough the mud is a complete mis- use of the power of the press, no matter what these people may have done in the past. I am amazed at the complete lackofjournalistic in- tegrity displayed by the writer of the Top Ten list, as well as the edi- tors who approved the publication of such an article. I hope that, in the future, the writers and editors will make more mature and intelli- gent decisions as to the material published. Sincerely, Heather Campbell OP/ED Guy ~,uirfels. ~Cl\~ Concordiensis Open Response to Criticism Concordiensis would like to take this opportunity to respond to the issue raised by Heather Campbell and other members of the Union C<lllege community regarding last week's top ten list. The list, entitled \Top Ten Reasons That Union Women Should VolUiltarily Invest In Self- Defense Classes,\ appeared in the Features se.ction and was compiled by members of the Editorial Board. The sole purpose of the list v;as to provide a humorous perspective for the students events and experiences that we hold in common. At no time was it Concordiensis' intention te> i>e malicious, and we do not believe that we have been. Each action, event and organiza- tion made reference to in the list is .of public record or common knowledge. Most of the events h.ave been reported upon by Concordiensis. It was our belief that students !Jere would found the list funny. In the event that we failed, we ask you to note that it is impossible to please every- one. If anyone was offended then we apo log iz~ for the confusion, though we stand by the list, which we believe to be harmless. In addi- tion, Conconiiensis does not be- lieve this to be il matter of journal- istic integrity, but rather a matter of taste. The Feall.ures section in no way attempts to represent the facts, but rather is a forum for cre- ative and artistnc columns, narra- tives and other entertaining pas- times. Fu.rthenmore, the views rep- resented are 11o>t necessarily those of the newsp:t.p.er; they are for en- tertainment purposes only. In response to CamJ>bell's claim th.at we are guiilty of \dragging a student's na.me ... through the mud,\ and as s11ch have exhibited \a complete ndsuse of the power ofthe press,\ vre can only respond tllat we have diOne no such thing. No Union stud1ent, or recognized organization, vr as named in the list. Again, we hop<e that the commu- nity understamls our intention was to be entertai11l ng. Comments are welcome, and the Editors may be reached through the Concordiensis office. ~----------------------~--------~------------------------------------. Cartoonist Needed!

In the article entitled Elianvs. U.S. Govemment, Gina Campanella says that the INS officer was pointing a REALLY BIG GUN AT Ellian and the man he was with. Also, she says that visible guns should not have ben used. First off, the gun that was used was a MP5 Navy tactical submachine gun. It measures only about 20 inches. It is compact for close quarter conflicts. Secondly, the weapon was not pointed at Ellian or the man he was with. It was pointed down and to the side. An officer who is part of a breaching team only p{)ints a gun at someone with the in.tent to fire. Lastly, the reason that guns were visible durring the breach is simple. It was well known by the officers that people outside were armed and they were quite sure that there were guns in the house.

Leaving the show itself alone, who were half ~f the people that walked the runway? The primacy purpose of this show is to raise money for a good cause. However, this show is supposed to feature students wh.o are high. profile on campus and contribute to the betterment of this school. Almost all of the Edknso:Efr.eConcotdiensis were present, but where was the WRUC executive board? The President of the student body wasll 't asked, and neither was half of the class presidents or members of Student Forum. Some of the students were no more than pretty faces, had friends on the committee or maybe just hung out at Chet' s enough, butwere not involved in anything sigaificant. I'm not commenting on the quality of the show, but rath~r the participants. I know the Fashion Show Cominittee sp~nt countless hours organizing and perfecting the event, but unfortu- nat~ly no one chose to show up and support their fellow students. In the past a larg~ black sheet was hung in the Campus Center along with a zillion posters, to advertise the event, but this year there were \priceless\ posters. There was just not enough promotion and adver- tisement to make this year's show another Philosophy Depart~ent Carification Concerni~g Professor Haack's Visit Dear Editor: Orr behalf of the Philosophy Department I want to thank Concordiensis and in particular, Ms.. Mary Felton, for the article, \Union Hosts Visiting Professor,\ which helped publicize Professor Susan Haack's visit to Union as SJlencer-Leavitt Professor. By the time this letter is published, Prof. Haack will have completed a nine- day series ofseroinars and two lec- tures on the nature of inquiry and truth. 1 also wish to thank all of those who took time out of their busy schedules and atte.nded the seminars and lectures. Unfortunately, the article con- tained some inaccuracies worth correcting. Prof. Haack is a philo- sophical 'realist' who believes in the possibility of achieving ktlowledgeofthe world, aibeit fal- lible and limited.' Inquiry in sci- en-ce is an extension of everyday inquiry - when explanation is called for, one observes, tests, in- terprets - be it about one's cash- flow or about 'dark matter'. Thus it is misleading, to say that \Standard forms of inquiry come as a result of power issues in so- ciety,\ as one reads in the Concord~ article. Our interests, and 'power', g11ide what we inquire into · but do not determine the results. Tobacco firms might squelch in- quiry into carcinogens but they can't change the facts! Prof. Haack also does not mean to say, \Honest inquiry is really nei- · ther possib 1e nor desirable\ (I can- not fnid a reference for this quota- tion). Her view is the precise .QllilQ: site. She would add, however, \we are fallible, imperfect, often mentally lazy, careless, indifferent to the truth/' and genuine inquiry is hard -it's \doing one's damnedest with one's mind- no holds barred,\ as Peirce, the great American philoso- pher; once put it.

OF/ED ~·\ :.:,:'r:>tt;:?;~?;,-; '.;: ·' ·~:, ,,·:> Pfofessors·Resfloll to~-Ciili~Ddar Debate: Union Will Benefit From Semester System A long and costly debate (if you ties also maintain the trimester and load; or the ability to put a firm not simply assert that all the com- would teach 3 courses in 14 weeks, account for faculty resources and administrative time) on the aca- demic calendar has sputtered along on Union College's campus for the past five years. Senior members of the mllege community note that arguments for a switch to a semes- ter calendar have been going on for more than twenty-five years, and ' 1 every five or six years the is- sue Gf the switch from trimester to semester arises.\ ( C'oncordiensis, 4127100, p. l) We believe that ,it is in the best interest of the CoLlege to move to a semester calendar. Moreover, it is our view that this debate will go away only when · Union College bites the bullet and makes the switch. Why? Isolation: The trimester calen- dar isolates Union College on too many fronts. Students cannot take specialized courses at other area colleges; faculty cannot participate in ma.ny national NEB, NEA, NSF and ()ther seminars since they usu- ally begin in early June; students are ilandicapped in getting summer internships, participating in sum- me.- school programs and obtain- ing summer jobs that begin in early June. There have even been cases of Union College students who have had to turn down job oppor- tunities after graduation because employers wanted them to start Jun~ 1. More importantly, as we move incr~asingly into an electronically- based, globalized economy and culttcrc, it is imperative that we co- operate and pool resources with other colleges. Major foundations arc now interested in giving grants to several schools to develop pro- grdms mteract1vely. The recent grailt from the Mellon Foundation to strpport international study pro- grams was awarded to Union Col- lege and Hobart & William Smith College as a consortium. Now 'that Hobart has adopted a semester calendar, however (so that it can interact better with its other com- parison schools}, Union is in a weaker position to fully utilize that grant. A $900,000 Mellon grant to Colgate and Hamilton Colleges al- lows them to offer specialized lan- gttage Instruction, some of it on- 1 inc. and to share expensive for~ cign-language resources. By shar- ing costs and resources, these small colleges can offer courses in Arabic, advanced Japanese, Por- tugt•cse and other languages that they had previously been unable to offer on their own. Proponents of the trimester sys- tem and the \Union can go it alo11e\ philosophy like to point to the colleges that operate under non-semester calendars. This mi- nority of schools are not, however, aml)ng our comparison group. The largest number of colleges on a term system are community col- leges and trade schools where most students are in the workforce, are returning to take a limited num- ber of courses to fulfill a ·Certifica~ tioll program, and are not resident on campus. The shorter 10-week tenn and. lighter course load fits with the schedules of students who are often holding down full-time jobs. On the other hand, a few highly prestigious colleges and universi- quarter system. But Union College, with a respectable endowment of $267 miHion, cannot provide the li- brary resources, research budgets, teaching loads, undergraduate re~ search facilities, and financial aid awards to match those of schools such as Dartmouth, with an endow- ment of $1.7 billion, the University of Chicago with $3 biiiion, North- western with $2.46 billion, ot Stanford with a whopping $6.2 bil- lion. Carleton College, one of the very few schools in our comparison group that operates on a trimester calendar, nonetheless has an en- dowment twice the size of Union's and is able to mount domestic and foreign study programs on a much larger scale, keep class size small, and offer faculty a lower teaching load. At $551 million, Carleton has a ye.arly draw on its endowment that is $9~ l 0 million more than Union '11. Tlte trend among small liberal arts colleges comparable to Union, such as Occidental, Davidson, Lewis & Clark, and Hobart & WiJ~. · liam S~ith, has been to abandon the idiosyncratic trimester calendar in favCJr of the more standard semes- ter system. When asked their rea- sons. Occidental College reported that it wanted to rnove to a 5-course tead1ing load in order to maintain its competitive edge. Adopting the semester calendar made that pos- sible. Davidson stated. that it was able to participate in a consortium of southern schools and thereby offer courses in classics and lan- guages it was unable to finance on its own. Lewis & Clark wanted to develop an international studies pro- gram in coopcraiion with Reed Col- lege; Hobart & William Smith wanted to take advantage of more offerings in study-abroad programs, which arc nearly exclusively sched- uled for a semester calendar. Both Lewis & Clark and Davidson as- serted that the .change to a semes- ter calendar allowed them to send more students on science-specific study-abroad programs, such as those available at universities in England, Belgium and New Zealand. Notably, all the colleges reported substatttial financial savings on the semester calend2r; most estimated it at around a half a million dollars yearly. Finances: Just as Union is small and in need of sharing resoQrces, grants and classes, it's very size makes it difficult to a.bsorb the high cost of the trimester calendar. It is one of.the reaso11s tbat moving to a semester calendar is desirable and the only fiscally responsible path to follow. Unfortunately, just about every issue at the CoiJege comes back to money: the level of tuition, the extent of financial. aid, the sala- ries offered to faculty a11d staff, class size, teaching load, research bud- gets, facilities, retirement plans, ben- efits packages, and mote. The cur- rent, and possibly e()nservative, estimate is that the move to a se- mester system would save Union College nearly $400,000 a year. These savings are substantial and represent a ten-fold increase in the combined amount of the current merit arid research pool for faculty; or about 5 new faculty .Jines; or sub- stantial contributions toward de~ · creasing class size and teaching brake on tuition increases. It is money for library acquisitio.ns, far undergraduate research, for pro- grams in the arts, for building and facilities. It is too sigRificaat an amo11nt of savings to be ignored. Compedtiveness: Union can maintain its competitive edge by &ttracting the best faculty. The single most important reason pro- spective faculty members turn down Union is the teaching l'oad. Unioa's 6-course load for faculty cannot compete with many of our comparison instituti<ms, which offer 5 and even 4-course loads, as well as more generous sabbati- cal policies. Union also needs to maintain .its competitive edg~;: in other ways, such as being able to offer sophisticated interactive, . on~Jlne courses that meet the needs of the global economy, by allowing faculty to keep pace with the research demands of their professions, and in many other ways. Whereas Union College remains one of the top liberal arts schools in the country, we need to be aware that not one of our peer institutions is standing still. The semester system all:0ws us to take advantage ofthe research and pedagogical tools of large research universities, while maintaining the intimacy and at- tention to teaching only available in the small college ettvironment. Pedagogy: Advocates of the current trimester calendar argue that Union is able to offer a wider variety of courses titan do schools on the semester :system. That is true, but students have to take more courses (and fhey do) in order to get tlte same amount · of content that is available in se- mester-long courses. A semes- ter calendar has 25% more class- room and iaboratory time per course. Moreover, following the logic of the trimester .adyocates, for example, we could divideall of our current courses in half, thereby doubling our course-of- ferings, increase the number of courses required for the major accordingly, and then proclaim an even more diverse set ofofferings! But what is to be gained from that? In reality, st11demts take more classes at Union College tball they do at Trinity College, for example, because th41y have to in order to get the same ~o11tent. If course content, divided into more segmerlt$ is better for learn~ ing, 'then Union College students shollld score higher on standard- ized tests, get into medical and graduate schools at higlter rates, speak foreign languages better, write better, etc. than do their counterparts on the semester cal- endar. But there is nc> evidence that our students outperform the students at Williams. CoLgate, Smith, Hamilton, Occidental and many other small colleges on the semester system. If this style of teaching and of learning works better, it should show llp some\ where. It does not. We have ev- ery .reason to believe tb~t stu• dents at semester-bas~cl schools learn as much chemistry,history,. biology and other sub je(ts, in both small and large departments, as they do at Union. Indeecl, we can- parison schools that rank above us in national scaJes of excellence are not as good as we are because we require more classes. (By that logic, any sch()(}): tbat ranks below us, and has more <:ourses in its catalog, can claim to be better than we are!) On the other hand, in a couplt;: ~ey areas-· learning foreign Jan- · guages, writing .an<i ·reading skills, and in parts &f the fine arts our~ riculum-some faculty argue that the current trimester system is dis- advantageous t() many of Union ;s students. Stud~ts can be taaght the elenwnts M a language in a short period of time, or to. perform a musical pie()e, btlt unless they practice .it over an.d over, they won't learn to speak or perform well. Likewise 1 mounting a theatri- cal production lakes time. The pro- cess of leamiEg t<> write well in- volves having; tl!e papers cor- rected, and then revising and re- writing. Faculty members in writ- ing and lang~age courses (many of which are i arge GenEd classes) simply do not have as much turn- around time to grade papers, have the students re-do assignments and offer exten:sive feedback in a 1 0-week term as they would in a 14-week semester. It is certainly possible (though probably not a:dvisable) to teadt 25% more mat'(lrial in 25% less clas:s time. It is impr()bablethat students will absorb it. If a 1 0-week course contained all tile material of a 14- week semester course, {lnd Union's students indeed learned it, they should be outiJerfonning nearly all their compe1i tors in semester- based programs. They are not. Furthermore.,!itud.ents burt'by the trimester cal~ndar ate those iD need ~f more .atademic ass~stan~e, those from disadvantaged back- grounds, fresiltmen, and students who are taki11g req11ired subjects o11tside their majors;. Fairness: ~rrimester proponents point tD its fle:dbility, noting that it allows some faculty to have a \light term\ in which they teach only one course, or a \term off' with no teacl1i11g. A 5-course load for the entire faculty under a SC9- mester calen-\lar provides a more manageable :and equitable teach- ing schedule f-<>r all faculty mem- bers. Currently every faculty mem- ber after the firs1 year has a 6- course load. Some departmeriis offer a course equivalent for teach- ing a given number of labs or di- recting senior theses, but those are not \course:s .off,\ only course equivalents. Under the trimester calendar it is mathematically im- possible for any faculty melJlber to have a \term ()ff~ without; having taught the equivalent of more thah two courses in ()he of the oth:er terms. A faoeutty member who is teaching two() classroom cours~s and directing four senior theses (a course equivalent) over 2 tertns .is teaching Z 1/2 courses each H)- week term, a l()ad that is easiiy equal to 3 .courses in 14 weeks. Faculty members wild are runnirtg labs, teaching lectures, .artd directit1g theses to eqllal a 3-oours~ loa1d during each ;()f 2 terms, would un- der the semester syst-em have a more relaxed schedule, since they as opposed to 3 courses in 10 weeks:.

Because of the differences in faculty load- ing, and in the way in which cer- tain courses are taught, especially in sciences, ther·e may well be ad- vantages for some facu1ty and some departments u:nder the tri- mester sYstem. The equalized cal- endar under the semester system, which adds a month to the sum- mer; sho.ald more than compens41.te for the .advantages (}fa \light term\ or .. term off' curreotiy enjoyed by only a portion ·of the faculty. In conclusion, there is. no re- search that conclusively proves that learning is better under one academic calendar over another. As factJity members we have stud- ied under a range of calendar. sys- tems, send our childt·en to colteges that have various academic calen- dars, a11d would probably accept positions at any nu.mber of col- leges and universities on a variety of academic calendars. be they tri- mesters, quartets, \ol-d semester\ (longer with more breaks) and the most common \new semester\ sys- tem.

My surroundings and the people who helped raise me taught me to b.e courteous, polite, and how to heagentleman. I never learned life any other way. That was how it was always done, and so it is also the way I do things. I was. taught to live my life with a \southern hospital- Ity.\ The phrase is almost a cliche, but it is so ·true to the way I live. Southern hospitality is a way of treating others. It means gi v:ing a person ·the respect they deserve. It means always being there fur someone in need, and overall, it is a w1llingncss to do anything, at any cost, to help ,;omcone who asks for it. That is one of .the vows 1 make to you today. If elected, I promise to do anything m my power to help anyone in need. That is JUSt my politics with southern hospital- ity. It is the way things should be and will be done. Another great characteristic I gained from my upbrir.~gmg m Texas was an ability to lead. Being a'lcader is hard at times. To be a leader, you must be able to stand up to things. You must have the courage to fight against what you believe is wrong; and also, you must be able to defend what is right. Being a leader is something I have always been. I have never stood on the sidelines. I have always been in the game. Last October my peers elected me as a representative to the Student Forum. This position meant a great deal to me. The Forum has kept me in check with the issues ofthe studentho()y and the overall school. I have gained much experiencethrough this last year on theforum. It taught how I could take a leadership role on this campus, and how I could really make a difference in our great school. My experiences on the Student Forum really enticed me to go farther. As a representative on the Forum, I could only really delve into issues with my own class.

I fed this position is increas• .ingly important as the changing climate at Union moves further away from one of students' in- puts and closer to those ofa.select few. This can easily be seen by the U2K preliminary report, a manifes~o our school has devised that wi}l guide its policie~ int9 the future seemitigly i:egardless ·ofour expr.essed irttere~ta.s students.

AIJ the i nfortnation; that the Trustees receive about the student body (be it there beliefs or actions) are from the Junior Trustee. I hope you can real- ize how important this position is to the student body and how important this election is to the- student body. Unfortunately, it is impossible to take a stu- dent vote or every iss4e that comes up in a Trustee meeting. Thus, the Junior Trustee must infer, through his or her observations, what would create th~ best situation for the, student body. In ord~r to do this effectively, the' Junior Trustee must know thestudentbody.l know the student body. I amactively involved in almost every atea of student life. I am an athlete on a Union sports team. 1 am also invoJv.ed in several clubs, namely the Water PO:Io Club and Cc(lcoa House. l have ·livedinadorm and spent a large amount of time in both theme houses as. well as Greek houses helping tne to understand all three types of on .. campus riving. Ffrially, I ainapart of several stu- dent performing groups such as Idol Minds. This involvement enables me to examine and analyze an issue from several angles so that I can create a solution that will work for the majority of the student body. I will also be able to bring several different perspectives to the trustees so that they can fully understand the students needs. While I can not anticipate every issue that I will encounter over the following two years I can address the two isstJeS that seem to be on most students minds as of last week From talking Dan Kirsch In a position like Junior Trustee, one where a student has to represent students and deal with faculty, it is important to elect a student who has experience doing both. I've been on the Aca;. demic Afrairs Co unci I, helping pass the first modi- fication and improvement in the Pass/Fail option in years. J•ve provided a voice on this committee for students, always weighing in on issues of con- cern, but at the same time, feeling I wanted to do more. Having a real impact on the day-to-day life oftbe school, but all decisions made on the AAC, the GenEd board, and all other faculty/ student decision-making bodies are subJectto .fi. nal approval by the faculty and administration. As Trustee, I want to ensure real decision-mak\ ing power on faculty/student/administration committees, not just symbolic sops to student protests. Also, while sitting on these committees, I saw that too many issues fell out of my reach. With all of the changes going on overall in the social and academic life of Union College due to the proposed U2K restructuring, I want to be a voice for the students in the heart of policy-making. This i~ why,. in addition to running for Trustee, I've applied to both the Planning Committee and . the AAC, because I want to be involved. regard- less of the outcome in this election. We as a student body deserve to be represented in an ef- fective way in matters of the Greek system, Col- lege Park, new Athletic issues being brought up by faculty, and,other extracurricular issues, I don't want to risk not having a say in these im- \ < portant stt.tdent and school affairs because I'm right now in Washington, D.C., unable to run my campaign personally, and unable to put up amilw lion signs or pass out matchbooks or keychains, or cookies and milk with my name sprayed all with students it se.ems that most are not op- posed to the Greek system. Instead, they what tci make sure that there will be other opp 0 rtuni- · ties to live in a nice spacious house. It seems to me that Union should continue to work; on creat- · ing spacious housing for students to live in with out being a Greek. I have also inferred about tl)e trimester sys- tem. Again with personal interviews and my own experience I f<;el that Union should stay ol'l the Trimester system. The Trimester system not only is. unique, setting Union apar1; :from other co lieges, but it only helps the Liberal' Arts educa- tion. It helps the L.A. education becau~e it al- lows for students to explore several area's of interest because of the number of courses that students are allowed to take. Also, the trimester system encou('ages students to involve them selves in other activities because they are only forced to juggle three classes instead of four. I hope that at this point you understand me better. At least you know who Woodley is now. In· any case, I will work hard during my term to inform the Trustees about the students needs. over them. l care abbut this school, I want you to kt1ow that l'll continue ~o fight for the stu- dents' interests every. way J carl, but I fe~l I would be most effective as Trustee.

The Vice President of Finance position needs to be held by a. person who can work well with all types of people as .students will come' and propose new clubs. This person will need to be organized, availatle; and responsible. As an active member on tllis cam- pus, I am currently involved with clubs, activi- ties, sports, and committees.

Currently, I manage a budget form)' fraternity as treasurer. Some of the duties of my current posi:;tion in- . elude designating funds for a food and social. budget Similar to this, I .know that the two main functions ofthe Finance Committee are to allocate additional funds to clubs thr()ughout the year, and also project where and loow the $.414,000 budget should be distributed t«J the 90 · clubs on this campus. I am very familiar with • the Finance committee, the Student Fortlm, and Student Activities- the three organizations re- sponsible for the Vice President .(}f finance to work with in order for the clubs to b~ finan~ cially assist Unton · liege Annual Fund by working as a Union College Af- filiate. I am very familiar with how a bu.dget is formed, maintained,. and distributed, and I know about the multitu!le of clubs on this campus, a.nd what kin9 of events 1hey perform each term.

Please come ou:t and show suppori for the student body, alld vote on Friday, May 5'b. Yashika Mabry My name is Yashika Mabry. I am a candidate for VP of Finance. f have come up with .some great ideas that will benefit the organizatiEins as well a.s the student body. Certain organizations on campus such as the Concordiensis,_ Speak- ers Forum, and WRUC have difficulties plan- ning or operating forthe next year unless they .know that they are receiN'ing at least a guaran- teed amount ofmoney. These are all o~ganiza- . tions that provide services that benefit <each in- dividual student and Union College as a whole. Furthermore, organizations should bem()re ac- tive in the amount of funding that they receive. Monies trom the student activities fund should be set aside fot fundmisingactivities. Each or- ganization will still be allotted a set amount of money however, if they need additiona:l money ~fter depleting their fund during the sch«>o 1 yeat, they can fundraise with the incentive that the Finance Committee will match the amount raised.

. ( Jess' Ah, Spring. It seems that the weather has finally turned around and the summer bug is in the air. People are starting to get excited for lazy afternoons in the sun on the beach drinking piiia coladas. Vis ions of swimming in in-ground pools during late night parties run through my mind. Leaving Union has a much dif- ferent meaning for freshman, sophomores and juniors than it does for seni()rs. For them, sum- mer offers new avenues to explore and more enticing risks to take. But before summer settles in and stu- dents leave for their jobs waiting tables, serving up French fries at the beach, or career experimenting, they have to get through Spring term. Coupled with the upcoming change of seasons comes the yearly \Senioritis.\ This is the time when seniors realize that there are more important things in life than school. They also realize how much they are goi11g to miss the good times at Union and the great friends they've made in the past four years. Juice Due to these realizations, and many other factors, the senior Grade Point Averages seems to drop ... dramatically. Inordertotzy to get to the bottom of this phe- nomenon, I have compiled a list of the TOP TEN REASONS WilY THE SENIORG.P.A. SLIPS IN TilE SPRING. 10.

It's good for many things such as re- laxing, concentrating, partying, dancing, and having a great time. Music can make or break a great party. We all know this because everyone has been to at least on.e party where the DJ was pretty had, but we've also seen how a great DJ can also get a party going. Mu:sic can be pretty interesting in tlle dorms as well. Whenever I tell people I live on fourth floor West I get the same reaction. How can I possibly live there? It certainly has a reputation for being a little insane. I think music has a lot to do with that repa'- tation. Is it such a big deal that some of us like to play music in- credibly loud? We don't think so, although none of us are candidates for 24-hour quiet next year either .. Now, most people like to tum up the volume every now and then, but this is different.

The· best education and inost useful knowledge comes from life experiences and outside influ- ence. At last puters. 1 was actually asked by a friend what the point in a subwoofer is, and if you've ever listened to ·something on a com- p-uter with a subwoofer then you know. It really malces the .sound better. However, subwoofers can be cranked extr~m~ly high, and that's when. thirigs get a little nuts. As I'm sure you all know, sound waves are basically ·Compressions of energy, which is why you can feel sound. Now imagine what hap- pens when you turn up the subwoofer, which produces pow- erfully deep sounds. Basically, the walls rock. In fact, everything does. l can feel my clothing flap- pil'lg in the quasi-breeze of sound waves. My desk shakes, the im- age on my computer blurs ever so · slightly; and things fall over.

Union's newest achievement in the realm ofinternational Me<lia is not due to the work of a former stu- dent, or some sort of world-re- novroed research. It is due to a professor's krt()wledge of useless facts that can't help you in any way, except to win a million dol- lars. Professor George Williams of theComputer Science Department afUtrion College will appeatin·next Tuesday's ABC broadcast Qf Who wants to be a Millionaire? h.osted by R..egis Philbin. According to Williams, he watches the show every time it airs, and attempts to call in every 11igbt. A couple of weeks ago, he a.<Jtu- ally got through and answered the three questions correctly. He also macle it past the telephone play- off. Willial11S traveled to New York this past weekend to tape the epi- sode scheduled for the air next Tuesday. Due to ABC copyright regulations, we cannot announce his winnings, but we can say that he was able to pass the \Fastest Finger Question\ .and make it to the \Hot Seat\ with Regis.

Arthur Honored at Reunion-Weekend As most people have heard at . this point, this upcoming weekend is the \Reunion Weekend\ on the Unioncampus. Alumni from around the world are flying in to remember their Alma Mater, Old Union. Every time Union has one of these reunions, something fun is in the works by the administra- tion. A leak from the Alumni Affairs Office reports that President Roger Hull will be giving his regular speech not as himself, but instead as long time Union Alumnus, Chester A. Arthur. During this speech, Huli will apparently thank Union for the .statue and for the house named after him. In a ges- ture of goodwill, he will attempt to make amends for burning down that building when he was a .student. He will also be presenting payment for his overdue balance still owed to the College. In response to this; Union College will be presenting Arthur with an honorary degree, due to the fact that he never earned one here.

Campus Bird News by Becky \the Birder\ Brown Contributing Writer The Union ecosystem is quite impressive with its trees such as ·Gingko Biloba, Dawn Redwood, and Maple species. The Hans Grootkill trickles through Jackson's Garden, adding vigor and sometimes litter to the Union environment. Squirrels and rabbits run rampant around our majestic arbor specimens. Totop it all off, there actually is a nice little avian community just outside of the Col- lege Center, just around the cor- ner of Smith House, and flying over the soccer field. The best part is anyone can go out and track these little critters · with only the investment of time. Over ninety different species of birds have been spotted on cam- pus inthepastthirty years, includ- ing Ring-necked pheasants, Per- . egrine Falcons, and the Pileated Woodpecker (that's what woody- woodpecker is.). Bird watch~g, known as birding to birdwatchers, is quite simple and rewarding to the beginner, but challenging and exciting for the pros; kindoflikeMonopoly. While sitting in bacl< ofthe College Cen- ter, take notice of the birds in the area. I'm sure everyone knows what a Robin looks like. The next step is to learn it\s call. Shut your mouth, open your ears, chase the Robin into a tree (preferably a deciduous species that will have minimal foliage at this time), and then wait patiently for him or her to speak. Male and fe- male Robins look and sound the same so you get to skip the step of learning both traits of the two gen- ders. Lately there have been many Dark-Eyed Junco's that can be found near the newly installed feed- ers in the garden. These arc the birds that make the high-pitched, single note trill that often is heard around campus. Hurry up and get a look before they continue their migration north. The well-known Black-capped Chickadee also hangs around· the feeders and has an easy call to re- member, \chickadee-dee-dee.\ House Finches can be found chirp- ing outside of Chi Psi or bounding around the front the College Cen- ter. Starlings are gregarious spotted black birds that are often found with Grackles, who have purple heads if seen in good light. Grack- les are neat because they wedge their tails and use it as a rudder to steer while soaring. The cal1 they have can sometimes be painful to hear. Keep an eye and ear out for these common birds. If you see a new specimen, follow it, observe its actions, and learn its song. The special \Avian of the Week\ is the beautiful Belted Kingfisher, a crested blue, white, and rust col- ored carnivore. I saw it flying over 'Admissions on Saturday. This bird is a relative to the Australian Laughing Kookaburra and is usu- ally found near bodies of water. Happy birding! ...

In leaving his position Haider struck out against European Union, stressing that EU attempts to op- pose his party were a form of \me- dieval exorcism.\ Criticism of the Freedom Party, however, has not been limited to Europe. Many prominent world figures such as Janet Reno and have expressed fears about the Party's views and its leader. In the past Haider has made com- ments praising the Nazi govern- ment, which he quickly apologized for. He was quoted as saying that no govemment has had employ- ment policies as successful as Nazi Germany. Hesaid that \in the Third Reich a large number of workplaces were created through an intensive employment policy and unemploy- ment was thereby eliminated.\ Haider made no mention of the military build-up, forced labor, and concentration camps that accom- panied this program. He later stated that he was referring to the years of 1933 through 1~36, before the the conser-vative People's Party Among the plans that she and camps were comrn()nly used. the EU cut offall political contacts other Freedom Party members have Many leaders are also troubled with Austria, as it earlier warned. prop0osed is to delay payments to by the Freedom Party's views on This political embargo has frus- the European Union. immigration.

He thought it was necessary to relinquish leadership in order to show that t~ party's leaders are capable of acting on their own. He said that the organization's leaders could not \remain continu- ally under the .suspicion of simply being... [puppets] whose strings are pulled in Ca·rinthia\ where Haider is governor. Many analysts believe that Haider is simplydistanGing himself from the party in order to help re- store its image. Haider's comments about immi- gration and his suspected anti- Semitism have drawn a stoim of ·criticism from foreign leaders, turn- ing him into a lightning rod attract- ing unwanted attention for his party. Many also suspect Haider of seeking shelter from the repQtation ofhis own party, which may have to take unpopular measures in the face of an EU embargo and other foreign pressures.

Pan Am 103: Court Set to Decide Fate ofT.wo Accused After eleven years, two Libyans set to stand trial but larger questions regarding bombing still remain by David Gruner Staff Writer It has been over eleven years since one of the most terrifying at- tacks on American lives. While men, women, and children were going about their business in a growing America, 189 American lives were instantaneously claimed over Lockerbie, Scotland. Only the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, the un- precedented earthquake in Turkey last year, or the painful story of Senator John McCain's struggle as a POW during the Vietnam War have had such an impact on the public at large as Pan Am flight 103 did across the globe. Those that can remember the ef- fects of the explosi()n hesitantly tell stories of grieving mothers, an abundance of investigators look- ing for clues, and rows of body bags. And this was only four days before Christmas.

How bands and art- ists are perceived and embraced by our society is a fascinating topic. Why are' some music groups re- viled by the public and embraced by artists who acknowledge their influence, and why do some per- formers strike a chord with the masses but are never taken seri- ously artrstic~dly? It's a difficult question, and it's always bard to generalize ab()ut subjects within the entertainment industry. There's no denying how- ever, that certain artists are vastly overrated by their peers and the public. while some of the most tal- ented are los.t among a plethora of the mediocre. This statement can't be sap- potted without examples, and mu- SIC history has offered them in ;,p.Jdc~. Til.: grcatt:st in my opin· wn. i~ the now legendary sixties psychedelic group The Doors. Fronted by Jim Morrison, The Doors demonstrated only marginal ability to write strong material, fo- cusing more on ·lyrics that were riddled with sex, drug, and hallaci- natory images. At the time, and since Morrison's death, The Doors have been seen as a revolutionary ad- vance in the complexity of rock and roll. and are a striking reminder of culture in the sixties. However, just because a group develops a revolutionary sound, it doesn't mean they have any merit artistically. I doubt The Doors would have been so successful if Morrison had lived, since the cracks in their image and ability wou!J have been much more vis- ible. Too much of their work cen- tered around rebellious experi- em:c~ m.:...., to the decade, with an extremely bold lyrical style. That's fine, but the best artists are the ones who write songs that with- stand the test of time, and in that sense The Doors fail miserably; their stuff just doesn't age well. · Certainly, the allure of some of rocks greatest bands has derived from their adherence to the tradi- tional image of the genre: sub- stance abuse, carefree attitude, and predictable womanizing (I'm .a big Rolling Stones fan, so I can attest to .this). But a lot of those groups could talk the talk and walk the walk, while The Doors were simply a by product of the sixties social scene. On the other hand, there have been bands and mtists with impres- sive talent that are largely over- looked or forgotten. Among them, Jggy Pop comes to mind as vastly underrated. Besides a huge base of artists that have been directly influenced by his work,just listen- ing to his music will mak~ you wonder why you m::~y never have heard of him. Raw, crisp, and energetic, but at times appropriately subtle and moody, Pop's work broke ground and also sounded intelligent. Not only that, he's been: doing consis- tently solid music for close to thirty years, and is well deserving of leg- end status. More people should give him a try, especially rock fans. Chances are he has even influ- enced your favorite band. Also underrated among today's current crop is Duran Duran. Evolving ftom a quasi \teeny hopper\ unit from the early eight~ ies to a impressive pop outfit in the nineties, Dui'an Duran is often underestimated fot their ability in writing smart, well produced, radio friendly music. Besides that, they're actually more than technically proficient.

-· Men's Rugby Battles Buffalo St. by William Johnson Contrilmtilrg Writer The complete latk of organiza- tion Friday night seemed typical ofa rugby road trip.- some of the team was hanging,out at Hobart, some of the membe-rs were enjoy~ ing a cookout at Will's ·house, some were at the hotel, and some were sitting on the .side of the road with a cop's flashlight shining in their eyes. But that's where most of the comparisons stopped be- tween this weekend and any other rugby weekend. F'or a team that had to cancel its last two matches due to lack of players, a strong showing in the upstate tournament seemed unlikely at best. But, if anything, rugby players have .learned to expect the unexpected. The long day of rugby Satur- day got off to a sta:rt at ten in the morning, as Union squared off against Buffalo State ... Buffalo State surely remembered its last meeting with Uni()n; a 40-0 loss in the upstate tournament two years ago that U nio'tl eventually won. As it was, the Buffalo 15 were certainly out for revenge, and they proved it early, using their bigger side to muscle through the smaller Union team, and earning themselves a 1 O-Ohalftime advan- tage. But Union was waiting for the second half to make their move. Flyhalf William Johnson started the charge with a 7D meter run, and the forwards kept possession with their superb rucking. Derek '\Thank God He's on my Team\ McCowan finished off the Union push by tearing tbrough the Buf- falo defense and scored a try. Jon Jones added the conversion kick to make the score 10 - 7. Through- out the sec()nd half, Union was running eire 1es around the tiring Buffalo side, but the careless er- rors Union committed that kept it out of the try zone were admittedly due to the team's lack ofpractice. Rut l Tnion's athletic ability alone hpt it one big play away from tak- ing the lead when Jones proved to be as hot as a two-dollar pistol, and as smooth as two-dollar whiskey as he stumbLed and bumbled into the try zone with 2 minutes left in the game. Ahead 12-10, Union got a final break when Buffalo missed a penalty kick that would have won it. After winning the first game in dramatic style, the Union men had an hour to rest and recover before taking on a f:uniliar foe, th.e ruggers of Plattsburgh State. The game was played on a plot of land that resembled~ literally, a cow pasture - an~ for good measure it stank like one to(). After giving their noses time to adjust to the fecal surroundings, the team found themselves behind by two tries. Undaunted, the Union fifteen re- sume'd their familiar roles as the comeback kids. Again, the pack stood as the unshakable rock on which the team was built, offering unfailing rucks and solid tackles, even holding up Plattsburgh in the Union try zone several times. Wing Jeffrey \F1atnose\ Lasker proved his worth by giving the Union side better field position with his nifty runs. And, right before the half, the dynami>c duo of Johnson to Jones connected on a solid crash to Jones, who dove into the try zone for his second score of the day. Again, the automatic kick by Jeremy Messler/C'P Heath Levine looks to pass out ofthe scrum~down. Jones pulled Union within 12 -7 at thehalf. · The second half, as before, was all Union, who countered the Plattsburgh attack with its own athletic brand of rugby. Serum half Heath \Bo()tmaster\ Levine was at the head of the charge, leading the troops deep into Plattsburgh terri- tory, where they rem<~.ined for the entire half. Led by the ferocious tackling offla11.kers McCowan and Matt Grant, Union completely suf- focated the Plattsburgh attack, while tacking on tries by Steve Flaherty and McCowan. With an- other kick by Jones, Unio~ was on top for good, 19- 12, and again they had managed a come-from-behind victory. So, now Union fotmd itself in the championship game, having knocked off Buffalo State and ,prattsburgh. With a three-hour break between matches, Union ~ad plenty of time to recover before facing a strong RIT .side for the · right to be na~ed Upstate Cham- pions. The champi-Qnship match ·proved to be the most physical of the three matches Union played that day -the weakness and fatigue were already setting in. But the Dutclm:J.en matched RIT very well, stalling many of their drives with excellent tackling, and thwartipg their advances with a sharp kick- ing game led by fullback Jason \Duff Zero\ Cunningham. But mental slipups cost Union two tries. Again, they found them- selves in a familiar ,position. As the frrst half drew to a close Union pushed itselfto within feet of the RIT try zo.ne, only to be turned away as the clock ran out. After a missed RIT lcick early in the second pe:riod, the half turned into a defensi-ve stalemate. With bodies barely able to move, and \ISing their last remaining amounts of strength, Union stuffed the RIT offense. H11rd, solid running' pushed Union closer to the try zone, but they lacked the extra push to make it in for the score. Although most oftlie fmal twenty minutes were :spent inside the RlT twenty4wo, Union remained shut-. out for the entire matc.h, which ended, 10-0. But the fmal score of the final game did little to blemish an afternoon that saw the Dutch- men post two upset victories in one afternoon. After a spring season that saw the Du1chmen cancel several games due to lack of players, their seco:rtd-plac.e perfonnance in the upstate tournament was anything but expected. the Union side per.- severed, and didn't let early defi- cits getto them. They tackled well, ran hard, and work~d well as a team. · Their payoff for such an after- noon of hard work was sweet in- deed - the trophy as the second- .place team :in the state. As the spring season draws to a close, other than a te11tative match for pat- ents' weekend, the team would like to thank coach Matt for dedicat- ing his time a11d crazy rugby drills to the team, a:nd to seniors Heath, Seth \Ask me about my Nipple Ring\ Potkinanc:l Tom Burke, who have been crucial players on the team for four seasons. Women's Rubgy Has Exciting Travel Weekend by AmySiabich Contributilig Writer The Union Colliege Women's Rugby Team, led by newly elected · leaders Nora Perkins, Shannon Hildreth, Randi Diipont and Leah Baker, went into tile Upstate New York Cornpetitionwith confidence this past Saturday after coming off of an undefeated regular season. The Dutchwomen had victories in the Albany Tournament and the Union Tournament this season. The team traveled to William Smith College in Geneva, New York to defend their Ups1ate title where, last year, the Dutchwomen defeated SUNY Brockport m the fmals to be- come the Upstate Champions. On Saturday the women were victorious in their first game, trek- king through swamp-like condi- tions and scori)lg four trys to Hamilton'sone. Trys were scored by Sophomore Becky Scrimo, · FreshmanNori Lupfer, Junior Randi Dupont and Sophomore Emily Godfrey. Sophomore Shannon Hildreth also played an excellent game. In the second game, Dupont, along with Nora Perkins, Jessica Wells and Rhobie Langwig led the team with tlheir hustle and persis- tence against their opponents, SUNY Cortland, which proved themselves to be a much stronger opponent tlJan Hamilton had been. The Dutchwomen scored one try just short of Cortland's two but the team playe<l a strong game. Dupont said, \We did very well for ourselves. The game we lost was against a team that use to be Division I and if we had 10 more· minutes we could have won.;, Jun- ior Rebecca Walsh agreed, saying, ••rt was definitely back and forth the whole time.\ Cortland went on to win the tournament, crus~ing S)rracuse University in the finals. Although the Dutchwotnen's regular season is comple1e, they are Looking forward to two post-sea- son games against SUNY Albany and the Albany Sirens. The game against SUNY Albany will be held on Friday afternoon at 2:00 in front of the Nott for all who wish to come out and support the Union Women Ruggers. Walsh said .. It will be. fun to encl the season with two solid games.\ The team will be bidding farewell to their two valuable seniors tbis year, longtime-veteran Ellen Tay- :Ior and Becky Ambrosino. Taylor's leadership. motivation, and atti- tude will greatly be missed as well as Ambrosino's hard work a:nd strength on the field. Junior Rebecca Walsh sets up a block with her teammates.

Union Crews Sweep Gillman Cup by Mary Felton News Editor After weeks ofhard work and rainy prac- tices, the Union College crew team was vic- torious. This past Saturday, Union's oars- men and women faced off against Hamilton College and Vassar College for their last home race of their spring season. The Men's and Women's Varsity Eights were competing for the Oilman Cup and Plate. These prizes were provided by the generos- ity of Larry Giilp.an. He donated the cup and plate in his name in order to promote rowing in the capitol region by bringing great insti- tutions of learning toge~er. With beautiful weather and the rel~tively calm waters of the Mohawk, the Union crew team was eager to show off its talent for the many friends ctnd family that showed up in support of thern. The first crew to take to the water was the Men's Varsity Eight. The Union Men had . the challenge ()f defending the Gilman CUp, which they had won for the past two years. Their only competitor was Hamilton, but this crew proved to be a strong one. At the 1 000-meter mark both crews were neck and neck, and it appeared as though Hamilton was in the lead. During the last 500 meters Union put up a fight and crossed the finish line at a time of 6:20.2, with Hamil- ton fmishing 0.8 seconds later. The second race of the day was the Women's Varsity Eight. The women were also excited a.nd eager to recapture their plate. Both Hamilton and Vassar had crews to . , race ag(\i:Jlst th.e varsity women, yet neither crew proved itself to be a match for Union's strength. By the 500 m.etermailc Vassar was no longer in Union's siights ...vbile Hamilt()n attempted to keep llP with the strength of these women. The U11ion women crossed the finish line at a time ·()f6:55 with at least a boat length and a half on Hamilton, the sec- ond place fmisher.

The most amazing jpatrt of this race occurred at the final 5•00 meter mark when the crew dug it in and sprinted past Hamil- ton to the finish line. TheN men and women ha<l similar suc- cess stories. Although HarniJt()n and Vassar put forili their best efforts, they simply could not keep up with Union. 1he N women overtook the Vassar JV at th~ start and had pulled away from HamJlton by the 500 meter mark.

They split the games, win- ning against Hamilton and losing a tough match to Williams. When Union stepped onto the field for their match-up against Hamilton, they knew that \The I3lue\ would not be as easy an op- ponent as they had been the pre- vious season. and that they would have to step it up to bring in the victory this year. Union began the game slug- gishly, as they were behind from the very beginning. Going into the fourth quarter, Union was trailing by a score of 8-5, and it appeared as if the Dutchmen might drop their last UCAA contest of the regalar season. Union, however, surprised Hamilton and came out of nowhere to score three unanswered goals to tie the score at 8 apiece with four minutes left in regulation. Then Junior Scott Dutcher pre- vented the game being sent into overtime with the winning goal with Jess than a minute to play. Dutcher's incredible goal put the Dutchmen ahead for good, and the victory pushed Union into second place in the UCAA league behind RPI. Dutcher led the team scoring with three goals while Mike Tatelman, Mike Nigro, Kurt Kimball, Fed Sparisci, Russ Kerbel and Nate Peck each added a goal to the fmal tally. Patrick Forrest had a solid game in net, stopping 31 of the 38 shots he was faced with. On Tuesday afternoon, the Dutchmen traveled to Williams for their second game of the week to face a much more challenging op- ponent than Hamilton had been. The Dutclrrnen managed to keep up with Williams for the first quarter, whiche11<ied with Williams leading 3-2.

F arum Elections for the positions of President, Junior Trustee, and Vice-Presidents of Campus Life, MulticulturalAffairs, Administra- tion, Academic Affairs, and Fi- nance were held. Voter tum out was abeut 545 stU- dents, but that number was actu- ally larger due to the students who solely voted on a write• in ballot. Steve Flaherty was unopposed on the ballot going into the elec- tion, although three days before the student body was to vote, Jun- ior Aaron Seliger campaigned as a write-in candidate. - Flaherty stated, \I intend to act primarily as a mediator for the F o- rum; a mediator who brings. his own ideas and those of the student body to the Student Forum.\ Steve Flaherty wins the position of Student Fornm President. SeniorTnrstee Andy Markowski commented that Seliger received about half of the votes for Presi- dent which was an impressive nun1- ber, since be was not on the ballot. Winn stated, \[Seliger ran] one of the most successful write-in campaigns at Union College.\ Seliger's campaign made an irn- pacton Haherty's predetermined landslide victory. :Brian Roache, Vice Pr~ident of Finance, stated, \Students who participated in the write-in cam- paign to write his [Seliger's] name in really believed in him.\ Adam Ca,ppel, Thatcher Woodley; Matt Hameline, Dan Kirsch, and Ariadne Papagapitos.

In fact, about 650 alumni and their families made the trek to Schenectady for a total of 1200 - guests. The high turnout could be attributed to the increased pro- gramming of traditional and new events. These new events included trol- leytours ofSeward and Lock 23 of the Erie Canal as well as an all cam- pus and class community dinner held in the Memorial Field House on Saturday night. The anrtual picnic held ott Sat- urday was enhanced with a children ·s carnival that provided JPiniature golf and a Mr. Bouncey Bounce. AJurtiorReUnion was also held ()n Friday and Saturday nights which included dinner,. g~mes and Disney films. The entertainment provided for children allowed alumni and guests to attend rang- ing in ages from seven weeks to eighty-seven years old. More traditional activities in- cluded the annual class photo- graphs, alunmi parade, and alumni convocation. These events started Saturday morning at 9:30AM with class photos, tournament sign ups and parade preparatim:i. At 10:30 AM the pan~de. began on Alexander Lane, and continued to South Lane and into Memorial Chapel. The parade involved alunmi marching with their classes, marching bands and bagpipes. Following the parade was the Convocation, which consisted of Alwnni Medals, Faculty Meritori- ous Service A wards and parade trophies to winning classes. All three. Alumni Medals were pre- sented to the class of 1950 far the greatest number of alumni march- ing, the greatest percentage of alunmi returning and the best cos- tume.

After current Junior Trustee Erit:t Aloan congratulated Cappel, he said,, ·~1 wa.s very excited to hear the 11ews that I had won the elec- tion, especially considering the quality of the other candidates.\ Cappel added, \I plan lo repre- sent the best interests of the stu- dent body.~· · Ya.shika Mabry and Doug Basldes were the only two candi- dates interested in the position of Vice President of Finance. Baskies' ideas ofdub funding won him the nomination. P()<>ja Kothari ran against write- in candidate Dapo Akinleye for the pos,ition of Vice President of Multicultu.tal Affairs. Kothari, a freshman, won the nomination for the 2000-2(}01 academic year. ALso, first year student Kevin Nealon won a dose race against Nemo Bdlin-Gansby for Vice Presi- dent of Campus Life. -Other winners include Kristine Rouse f()r Vice President of Admin- istration and A vrum Joffe for Vice President of Academics. Tlie elections were originally plamed fo1 Friday, May 5, but did not occurbecause there was a lack of organization. At .a Stu.dent Fomm meeting on Wednesday, April 26, the forum showed strong interest in a Pr.esi- dent and Junior Trustee debate. Markowski added, \Nowhere in the constitution does it say -any- thing about a debate.\ Senior Trustee Andy Markowski had initially planned Thursday, May 4 as the debate night, so calil- didates had the chance to make a statement to the student body. But because there was only one can<li- date for Student Forum President at the time, Kirsch was campaign- ing from his Washington, D.C. term abroad and two other candidates had conflicts, Markowski felt tllat a debate was not needed. When the Student Forum was informed of the decision late Wednesday night, senior class representatives, along with the rest of the Student Forum, requested that the election be moved to MOon- day, and a debate scheduled for Friday. . The debate was led with ques- tions from Winn and R()ache Cor each of the candidates. Markowski claims that tile election process is a Student Forum procedure, and Continued on page 3 Candidates for Athletic Director by Mary Felton News Editor A search is being conducted for a new Un.ion College Athletic Di- rector. There are four candidates that have been found by a commit- tee and who have expressed inter- es-t in the position. Two of these ca;adidates, Susan Bassett and Kerry Qainn, have already visited U11ion. Last Thursday, Susan Bassett, currently the Director of Athletics and Associate Professor of Physi- cal Education at William Sinith Col- lege, visited Union. Bassett at- tended Indiana University and then went on to receive an ad- vanced degree from Ithaca College~ Bassett, unlike the other candi- dates for this position, has past ex- perience at Union in the Athletic Depart:ment, From April of 1993 to June of 1995 she was the Men's md Women's Swimming and Div- ing Coach. In addition to this she was the Assistant Director of Ath- letics, and the Senior Women's Ad- trlinistrator. At the endofa longdayofmeet- ings with various figures ()n Union's campus, Bassett camebe- fore an open meeting of students and faculty. She was posed with many questions. Bassett was asked what she would do to in- crease Union's chances ofhaving a mere level playing field. She an- swered confidently that she wwts Union to be competitive and that \success breeds success.\ She gave recruiting as one possibly to solving the problem of unequal playing fields. Professor Taylor asked Basset what she thought about haviag a type of evaluation of the coaches. She responded to this by saying that a coach's evaluation is some thing that should be done every year. At William-Smith, Bassett has instituted a goal-setting session with the coaches and players at the beginning of each academic y-ear At the end of each year she meets with each team to have them filJ out evaluations.

He went on to say that tradition- ally Student Forum runs the elec- tions, but Winn and Roache took charge. The election time was scheduled for 10 AM-4 PM. Students were l·ined up ready to cast their vote at l 0 AM, but the voting was delayed for about one half hour because . tnernembers ofthe Election Board were missing. Student Forum members also signed up to work at the polls and several didn't make an effort to commit to their designated time slots. The polls were open ten minutes past 4 PM because of the starting delay, and Winn closed the voting b()otlts after the last person wait- ing in line at the time. The Battle of the Bands got off to a late start, but it was worth the wait. A large crowd ofUnionstu- dents turned out for the event, which can only be deemed a suc- cess.

The event was sponsored by Student Activities and coordinated by Sigma Delta Tau and Theta Delta Chi. The children were broken up into ten teams, each representing a country. The countries repre- sented were Australia, Barbados, Canada, France, Greece, Ireland, Israel. Italy, Japan and Spain. The event, which began at 10 AM, was broken into two sec- tions; the morning session con- sisted of five rounds of events, in- cluding Soccer, the obstacle course, dizzy izzy, the dress up race and, finally, hockey. There was then an hour break for lunch where volunteers from all over campus helped to serve hotdogs, hamburgers, cotton candy, snow cones and several other treats. The afternoon session, which ran from 1 PM to 3 PM, also con- sisted of five rounds, including events such as the potato sack race. sponge toss, dive for pen- nies, and the balloon toss. The children were much mor-e hyper in the afternoon sessioil which, more than likely, had to dCJ with the sugar consumed at luncll and the amount of water they had access to, to use for various p-ur- poses.

Senior Mike Winn, President of Student Forum, was the master of ceremonies fl)r the evening. The event featured four student groups, The Union College Dance Te<~.m, The Garnet Minstrels, Idol Minds and the Dutch Pipers, each group providing their own soun:e oftalent for the audiences' enjoy- ment. The first act on the stage was the Dance Team, which .performed tvvo numbers. For their first num- ber, the team came running on to the stage wearing black pants and Union College Athletic shirts. Af- ter the music started they stripped off their shirts and were left wear- ing matching red tank t0ps. The dance number was well cho- reographed. The music was ener- getic and had a great beat. The moves that the team put together demonstrated their hard work aad discipline. The final section of tile dance showed how well they were able to train each other to be in syrK with one another. The second number included blue glow sticks. TI1e.5iance started with the lights on and then tile st<1ge went completely dark. Tile dancers used the glow sticks to create cays of light flashing across the stage. Courtesy of Dutc·h Pipers Union College Dutch Pipe1-s. Again, this number showed the extreme difficulty and hard work of coordinating .a team of sixteen women to all do the same thing at exactly the right moment of the song. Each dancer used the glow sticks to make waves up and over the head and back down a line of women. Also, the dancers partnered up and did several different move- ments in teams of two that were different than all the other groups of two in order to present a ray effect oflight beaming across the stage. The overal1 performance of the dance team was very impres- sive. Glow sticks take a lot of wrist work and coordina~ion, both of which the dance team mastered for the show. The next group on stage was the Garnet Minstrels, Union's female a cappella singers. The fourteen girls who performed providedan enter- taining and energetic shovv. For each song, one or two girls would perform the lead to th.e song and the others would pr()vide the background hannony. They began their act with a song writtea by the In<ligo Girls, \Galileo.\ Seniors De- von Ciampa and Sandra Rodriquez lead the s-ong while the rest ()f the Minstrels provided the back- ground music. Sepltornore Dawn Stapleton perforned \Alone written by Heart.. Other songs includ,ed \Can ~t liuny Love,\ lead by Alison Fritz a.nd \This Kiss,\ from the Mermc.ids soundtrack, performed hy Ju11ior Alison Struzziero. Sopllomore Renee Rinaldi sang her tJa.ditional Cranberries song \Can'1 Be With You,\ and Soplinl.ore Megan O'Donnellsa,;ng \Higlter and Highet.\ Tae Minstrels also performed a new soa.g that had not been per- formed publicly .before, \Let the Rive:r Run,\ the theme song from the l~BO's movie Working Girl. OveJ:aJl, the Minstrels gave a stellar :!Performance, receiving }()ud applatLse from the audience. Idols Minds, Union's impr()v groul', ,per(ortned after the Min- strels,. presenting to all who watclled a.n extremely humorous routrne. The eight players· were spon.1a.neous and amusing. One of th_e oest acts ,of the Idol Minds incltldecl the Purgatory scene. During this scene, Seniors Liz KaieJ ao.tl Eugene Schul.tz had a conver:sation with each other un- der the conditions that each sen- tence they said had to follow the ordeJ ~f letters in the alphahet. Kaier'!l first sentence began with \A\ anti Schultz's followed with onebe~inning with \B and snon. A.n()tller skit that brought lots of lat~gh:s was \The Little Engine thatRll.n intoaJamFactory.\ Four ofthefllayers took turns finishing eacl:t other's sentences on that topic. The main rule of this game was to tell the story as if it were a Judy Blume book. During one of Idol Minds last acts they asked any and aU Alunmi to come ~p on stage and partake in tlie Emotion'game. Jon Zandman, fonner member of Idol Minds and Dutch ,pipers, carne onto the stage and played the game with Willll. The scene was set in Dunkin' Donuts, and they had to have a conversation with each other about the store,. acting the various emotions that were ap- pointed them. · The la:st performance qf the night was provided by Union's male a cappella group, the Dutch Pipers. The rust song they peJ:\- forrned was \Up on the Roof' with the solo part sung by Robby Olazagas1i, w.h<;>m later in. the night lead the :Pipers in the song \A Change in My Life.\ After that, the Pipers, looking sharp dressed in their shirts and ties, sang some other great hits, in- cluding \In the Still of the Night,\ led by Mile Pilo. Mark McKee led the Pipers singing \Good 01' A Capella,\' with help from Doni Johnson md Mark Werblin. Se- nior Pakk Hui, Piper Coordinator sang the lead to \I'll Walk With You.\ Their blst number of the evening was the college ·s alma mater, where the Pipers invited the Minstrels and all alumni of the two groups up on thoe stage to sing the final song. F()ur Dutch Pipers Alumni went on stage and sang along with the two groups. This was a fitting end to a night of superb talent dis- played by Union students. Premiere of \Beloved\ Election D.~bates . · . · fratemttles obtammg A-housmg, Courtesy of T'Jre Per[ormi11g Arts DepartmeJJt Do you know what instruments are in a standard orchestra? Pak:.k Hui '00 did not know either when he was a freshman. But this year as a senior, under the direction of Professor Hilary Tann, Chair oftlte Performing Arts Department and the conductor ofUnion's orches- tra. Hui composed his first orches- tral work, ca lied \Beloved (for Chlltl Keung).\ Hui, a Biology major and Music minor, came to America in 1991 fr<Jrn Hcmg Kong. He thought that this orchestral composition would be a great challenge as an independent study project. ·~Beloved (for Clmn Keung)\ is an emotionally intense piece which comprises ofbits and pieces of memories of Hui's father, Chtm Keung, who passed away three years ago when Hui was a fresh- man at Union. His father's unexpected death left him in complete shock. Being away from home at the time, he had to take a long and unbearallle flight home to meet with his fam- ily .. On the flight,.Huicried himself to·sleep, only to find himself wak- ing up in tears again. Many childhood memories rushed to Hui's mind during tlte Pakk poses for a picture after ki!; practice of \Beloved. \ flight. A golden sunset at the beach was a vivid picture ofHui and his father walking o:tl the warm, wet sand. The many fights and argu- ments they had all came back to his mind. The many tough lessons learned all started to reappear in his head. It took Hui a long time to fmally accept what happened. \Beloved (forChun Keung)\ allowedHui to express his emotions and to tell his story that words cannot convey. At the beginning of the piece there is a sense of emptiness. Af- ter Hui takes the audience through th()se vivid memories and 1h.e jour- ney of his emotions, the ending of the piece show closure an<l accep- tance. The use ofpentat<lnic scale in this piece depicts Hui's culture and origin. Hui, speaking with sornealll111ni, last weekend noted, \I'm glad that Union has a small Performing Arts Department, which allows room for students' creativity.\ \Beloved (for Chun Ke1lllg)\ will beperfonned by the UrtionCollege and Community Orchestra f()r the Steinmetz 2000 concert this Friday, May 12, at &:00 PM in Memorial Chapel. lly Katrina L.

Fla!Ier.ty conunented that stu~ dent leadership is suffering and said ne plans to revitalize leaders and getrid of apathy. He ~!so touched base on the UliCreport and the Greek system. Ariadne Papagapitos, Tha.tcher Wo()dley, DanK.irsch(who lefthis term ai:Jr()ad in Washington, D.C.), Matt flame line, and Adam Cappel all adclressed the audience with a brief statement. They addressed issues such as the UliC report and student reac- tion toward it, falculty/student re- latio:nsh.ips, apathy on campus, and £taldent leaders. Swdent Forum President Mike W inrl asl<ed a predetermined qu es- tion <lfeach ()f the candidates. 1he first question pertained to and what actions could be d()ne to provide the nicest houses on cam- pus to all students, not just mem- hers of the Greek System; Papagapitos~ wanted to see nicer housing given to all different types of groups on campus. Woodley expressed concern, and felt thatrnaybe administrative offices should seek off campus buildings. Kirsch disagreed and com- mented tllat Greeks should not be taken away, but furure housing should be awarded on merit. That way everyone has an equal oppor- tunity. Hametine agreed, and had no objections to single sex housing oil camtrus. He also added that there sho:uld be a set of rules for all housing. Cappel acknowledged the pro- gression: of the Seward Street progress and wants to improve housing and social life as a whole. The candidates were split on the issue of a semester system, but agreed tllat they would support student opinion. When asked what tlie candidates want to change on campus, apa- thy, U2K,perserving the Greek sys- tern, hou:sing, social life and com- munication between administration and studoents were the top issues concemitlg the nominees. \The trustees job is to come to the student body, not the student body to come t() the trustees,\ stated Kirsch.

Pro.khorov will be per- forming a piano concerto with Union's orchestra tomorroW night in Memorial Chapel·at 8 PM. This year the orchestra is play- ing a romantic maste:rpiece, \Con- certo #1\ by _Grieg, a three .. part piece, which will be performed in full. Prokhorov noted; \In this chal- lenging piece a pianist is given a chance to demonstrate his .. or her technical ability as well as artistic expression.\ Grieg, a Norwegian composer, achieved his international break- through and composed the Piano concerto in 1868. According to Prokhorov, Grieg's masterpiece was a model of' Schumann's piano concerto in A minor, a work that left an \unfor- gettable impression\ on him the first time he heard it. Both concertos belong to the tra- dition of German Romanticism, however in Grieg's work there is a specific national element, some- thing not heard in Schumann's piece. The new element in Grieg 's work has Strong associations to Norwegian Folk music. Prokhorov was born in St.-Pe- tersburg, Russia, wh~re she stud- ied piano in the Special Pre~Con• servatory Music School. She receivedhonorable mention in piano performance in the 1993 International Festival\Virtuososof the year 2000.\ Also, Prokhorovwas.a member . raising capital for the athletic de- partment, including having con- cession stands for sporting events, Music Talk Sluaa Miller/CP Anatasie Prokhorov, takes a break from practicing her concerto. ofa touring ch.orus that, during the years 1990-,1994, gave perfor- mances in Fran.ce, Austria, Hol- land, Poland, Germany, Hungary and England. In 1994 Pro:kh.orov and her fam- ily moved to the United States where she began to study piano at the Manhattan School of Music and in 1996 she placed flrst in the New York Pia~.o Teacher's compe- tition (Advanced Group). After this final competition Prokhorov WllS forced to abandon her piano studies. In the fall of 1997 Prokhorov en- tered Union in the class of 200 1. She is currently a junior History and French major. Her frrstyear at Union she was not playing the piano, however, according to Prokhorov, ''By the end of freshman year, I started 'to miss piano again.\ Professor Tann brought piano back into Prokhorov 's life. Tann introduced her to Miss Feroza Labone, an- otherpianoteacher. WithLabone's help, Prokhorov was able to pre- pare the first part of Schumann's Concerto that was played last year with Union's orchestra.

Schumann's concerto is the most frequently performed piano concerto of the Romantic Move- ment. by Kristina Dorne StaffWrit~r Last Thursday night in the Cam- . pus Center auditorium, Syracuse Professor Steven Buckley gave a lecture on the popular pop music oftoday. His lecture was mainly concern- ing the role that media and image play in black culture. Buckley speculated that man does not realize how i.Ill.portant im.- ages really are. Th~ media does everything in an effort to a-ppeal to the needs of the American con- sumer. Buckley maip.ly spoke about Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, the Backstreet Boys, and N' Sync. Pop music produced by these four sources is all over the rnedia. This music regularly appears on MTV and on the top of the Bill. board charts. Buckley claimed that these groups' music closely resemblesAfrican-Americanntusic. Furthermore, Buckley is of tile be- lief that white artists thatperf<>rrn African-American songs sella lot of records. In addition, he sai<l that many African Americans should feel cheated by the way whites are stealing from their culture. There are many facts that s UJlpor.t Buckley's claims. For example, .Johnny Wright, Britney Spears' manager, used to manage Afiican American musicians. Part of the appeal of the New K.ids on the Block was that they danced in a way that whites are ttsually thought to be unable to. Buckley reminded the audience that African Americans dance in this way all the time and that they cl.o not get any attention for it. Buckley grew even more heated when he compared the adaption of black music by whites to \cultural burglary.\ He suggested that whites use African American cul- ture as a means to achieve their ()Wll particular interests. Also, Buckley compared this current practice to the minstrel shows of the late nineteenth cen- tury and early twentieth century, where caucasian men would wear Mack face and perfonn shows por- ,traying African-Americans and their culture for entertainment pur- poses. Audience members differed by saying that producers are just do- ing what they have to do in the .society that we live in today. times ha:ve changed and in or- der for these types of popular bands to sell their music, they have t<> appeal to a certain type of lis- tener.

This has multiple opportunities get involved in as many or as few activities as possible. Many students choose to get very involved in a variety activities. This aspect of campus involvement is clearly not the The problem is that students sign up for a variety of clubs and activi- ties and they claim to be members. however, they never come to meetings and hardly ever contribute to the progression of the club. This does not apply to a11 students or to all clubs. yet, I find something upsetting the fact that a student will claim to be a member of the Economics Club, the Philomethian Society, the Karate Club or even Concordiensis they have been to a maximum of one, maybe two, meetings and they contribu tc. One may wonder why th1s should be amyone else's concern other than whomever is the inactive non-member of the club in question. It is ev1~rv1 students' concern to assure that eacn and every club and activity campus demands a certain degree of responsibility and commitmet:at of its members. Some clubs do 11ot require the extent of participation as clubs do. With this consideration in mind it is UJl to each organization to decide what standard of excellence they wish to require their members to uphold. Every club must maintain its own excellence or else it will tarnish OP/ED Everybod1 wants +- be ~ lRusT- ee. itsrepWarion andmanycth~clubs'rep~~ions on c~pus. fu add~on,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 1t w11l dimimsh the efforts of the real member iftlley are no more a 'mem- ber' than the non-member. Currently. Union College has. an overabundance of clubs that cater to the non-member. Such organizations require no participation or atten- dance from their members, yet they continue to allow them to claim mem- bership and they continue t() keep these peoples' names on the club roll. Why would a club choose to ignore the phen{)menon of non-member- ship? SQme clubs do it for the money, others simply do it out of apathy. The former reason is not as deplorable as the latter. Why should students who put in no effort and have no commitment be pennlttcd to claim membcrsh1 p to a club that tlley know nothing about? Perhaps 1f the active members of the club were more dedicated to th · cause and had more pndc in their club, this problem would be eliminated. For example, sports teams, the Gatekeeper Honorary Society, Big Broth- ers Big Sisters, sororit-ies and fraternities are all campus organizations that make 11 very difficult, almost impossible, for the non-member to tJclpatc. So why should other clubs cater to tl'le non-member? Not al organi;ations have to be as time consuming as those mentioned abo\:, but thl') should still demand some sortofproofofcommitment from thc1 membership. These mganitatwn~ often ha,·e no trouble: finding members who wdlmg to part1cipate responsibly and regularly because they instill a sense of pride m their members.

Think before you print. Rave Review for NC I would like to thank the chemis- try department and the .college for a wondedUl trip to Missoula, Mon- tana for the National Conference on Undergraduat~ Research (NCUR). This proved to be an enchanting setting for a thought-provoking series of talks. For those who were unable to share in this ex.perience, I would like to point out some ofthe highlights. l. The ax throwing and log saw- ing competitions A thougbtful ges- ture by the University of Montana to familiarize NCUR particip~ts with extracurricular activities of stu- dents. After a demonstration by two burly overall-clad UMT stu- dents on the fme art ofsawing large tree trunks with a nve foot long double handled saw, the question was launched, ·\Any volunteers?\ Uniop. students jumped atthe chal- lenge and Alex andRicbstarted off the aniateur competition wi_th an im- pressive saw time despite having never sawed together before. In frighten.lngly close proxil11ity, the ax throwing competition ensued en- listing_ as well a number of Union volunteers who managed to avoid casualties as well as the target. 2. Pow-Wow- For the lighthearted ( def. Those who equate axes with possible loss of fm:gers and large open head wounds) a Native Ameri- can Pow- Wow was held in the col- leges stadium. From my entirely naive perspective, this involved a great deal of chanting, stomping and walking in circles. The ultimate highlight of the evening festivities was a number of high energy chil- dren dressed in elaborate feathers, dangly thillgsf andlarge furry boo- ties performing a tribal dance with enviable enthusiasm. A number of Uni1>n students and a professor · were moved. by the mornenttojoin in the dancing which served, by contrast, to emphasize the grace of the tribes performing. 3. A number of interesting tall<s- In a concerted effort to explore ar- eas outside of my major, I h.ad p1aimedto.atte~d anwnber of talks on topics of literature, music, art, philosophy, etc. My only setback was that the schedule did not quitt: coincide with the ACTUAL events of the conference. Leah, a Un.ion student commented, ''That talk on Oscar Schlindler seemed to focus exclusively on molecttlar biology.)' (Nota direct quote) I did in fact though get to listen to a number of interesting talks as well as some which seemed more as Sam commented\like dinner con- versations.\ 4.Missoulians-The People- In an ctttempt to avoid vast generali2a- tions there were a couple of defm.\ ing characterisq.cs among Mon- tana students tliat I would like t<J introduce. The first and most ob- vious is facial hair which appar• ently is required or strongly rec- ommended for male applicm~ts, the more the better. Additionally there were amnnber offe111ale students fmely skilled in the art of expelling chewing tobacco saliva .. Common accessories on stlldents .included Nalgene bottles, some variety of open toed shoe, a camping ba<:k- pack and the occasional GRIZ gear, college paraphernalia .. (I could not help but imagine Montanas exceptional mascot, the grizzly bear, face-to-face with the Dutclnnath) 5. The Bel-Air on Broadway~ A quaint little establishment with.illl exotic flair {the palm tree on the sign), we called this home for fcur nigbts. The :friendly desk man serv- . ing as our f'rrst introduction to a slightly morerelaxed western a1mo- sphere. Although most of us did not spend a great deal of time in the Bel-Air, busy with the conference and evening activities, there was truly a sigh of awe our first n.ight as the night. 6:The M- Not much to say about this on.e, just a giant cement \M\ on the side of the mountain border'- ing campus. Most Unionites made it to the M realizing the toll the Schenectady winter had taken on their bodies. Most were bewildered by the prospect of lugging a large amount of cement up the side of a mountain. Crazy Mountain People. 7 .Deplaning for the 6th and final time- As the blood flow began to reenter some of my dying extremi- ties I have never felt so relieved, after 12 hours of travel to see the Union Trolley waiting at the airport. For a number of Union students who were inconven.ienced by flight delays the detour proved to be a learning e:lq'eriertce. A student tied up for a day in Salt Lake City com- me:nted, \Polygamy is kinda cool.\ The return flight proved far less troublesome with only one student holding a ticket destined for AI ... bany, Georgia. In this terse account I hope to have given a taste of Montana. My experience was en- tirely positive which seemed to be a common sentiment among stu- dents. My only r.egrets are that I did not see a real grizzly, beside the stuffed airport version, and that I might never get the chance to en- joy the Montana sunset again with a large glass.ofcreatine Junga Juice.

This proved to be an ench:anting setting for a thought-prov<>king series of talks. For those whQ were unable to share in this experience, I would like to point out SQrne of the highlights. l.The ax throwing and lo:g saw- ing competitions A thou.:ghtful ges- ture by the University ofMontana to familiarize NCUR participants with extracurricular activities of stu- dents. After a demonstratio.n by two burly overall-clad UMT stu.- dents on the fme art of sa:.win,g large tree trunks with a five foot long double handled saw, the question was launched, \Any volunteers?\ Union students jumped at tl.te chal- lenge andAlexandRicltstarted off the amateur competition -with an im- pressive saw time despite :having never sawed together before. In frighteningly close proximity, the ax throwing competition ensaed en- listing as well a number of Union volunteers who managed to avoid casualties as well as the target. 2. Pow-Wow- For the lighthearted (def. Those who equate axes wit:h possible loss of fingers and large open head wounds) a Native Ameri· canPow-Wowwas heldinthecol- leges stadium. From my entirely naive perspective, this .involved a great deal ·Of chanting, stomping and walking in circles. The altimate highlight of the evening festivities was a number of high energy chil- dien dressed in elaborate feathers, d:angly things, and large furry boo- ties performing a tribal dance with enviable enthusiasm. A number of Union students and a professor were moved by the moment to join il'l the dancing which served, by contrast, to emphasize the grace ()f the tribes performing. 3. A number of interesting talks- In a concerted effort to explore ar- eas ()Utside of my major, I had planned to attend a number of talks on topics of literature, music, art, philosophy, etc. My only setback was that the schedule did not q11ite coincide with the ACTIJAL events of the conference. Leah, a Union student commented, \That talk on Oscar Schlindler seemed to focus exclusively on molecular bi<>logy.\ (Nota direct quote) I did in fact though get to listen to a n11mber of interesting talks as well as some which seemed more as Sam commented \like dinner con- versations.\ 4.Missoulians-The People- In an <lttempt to avoid vast generaliza- tions there were a couple of defm- ing characteristics among Mon- tana students that I would like to introduce. The first and most ob- vious is facial hair which appar- ently is required or strongly rec- <mnnended for male applicants, the more the better. Additionally there were a number of female students finely skilled in the art of expelling chewing tobacco saliva. Common accessories on students included Na.lgene bottles, some variety of ()pen toed shoe, a camping back- pack and the occasional GRIZ gear, college paraphernalia. (I could not help but imagine M()ntanas exceptional mascot, tile grizzly bear, face-to-face with the Dutchman.) 5.The Bel-Air on Broadway- A C(Uaint little establishment with an exotic flair (the palm tree on the sign), we called this home for four nights. The friendly desk rnan serv- . ing as our trrst introduction to a slightly morerelaxed western atmo- sphere. Although most ()f us did not spend a great deal of time in the Bel-Air, busy with the conference and evening activities, t:here was truly a sigh of awe our fust night as the night. 6.The M- Not much to say about this one, just a giant cement \M\ on the side of the mountain border- ing campus. Most Uni()nites made it to the M realizing t:he toll the Schenectady winter had taken on their bodies. Most were bewildered by the prospect of lugging a large amount of cement up the side of a mountain. Crazy Mountain People. 7 .Deplaning for the 6th. and fmal time- As the blood flow began to reenter some ofmy dying extremi- ties I have never felt sa relieved, after 12 hours of travel to see the Union Trolley waiting atthe airport. For a number of Union students who were inconvenienced by flight delays the detour proved to be a learning experience. A student tied up for a day in Salt Lake City com- mented, \Polygamy is kinda cool.\ The return flight proved far less troublesome with only one student holding a ticket destined for Al- bany, Georgia. In this te1se account I hope to have given a taste of Montana. My experience was en- tirely positive which seemed to be a common sentiment among stu- dents. My only regrets :are that I did not see a real grizzly, lleside the stuffed airport version, and that I might never get the chance to en- joy the Montana sunset again with a large glass ofcreatine Junga Juice.

A Concern for Health by Gina L. Campanella Opinions Editor This past week the temperature in Schenectady has skyrocketed. This meteorological shock took the majority of the campus by surprise. Many of those students who were here last year are even feeling a bit nostalgic for that stretch of unbearably hot weather that attacked the Schenectady community tenth week and fmals week of Spring tenn 1999. This repeated heat wave experience has raised many questions, the two most important being: 1: W11y do the buildings that are equipped with Air Conditiening not have it functioning? 2: Why aren't aU of the build- ings on campus equipped with air conditioning? The first question seems to be the one more urgently begging for an answer. On Monday of this week, the student body received a voice mail informing the campus that the air conditioning in those buildings that are so equipped will not be up an running until Thurs- day (today). The weather called for ninety degree weather tllrough Wednesday. This situation has left many stu-- dents wondering whattheir $22,929 tuition and their $6,417 room and board fee goes to, eX'actly. I may be crazy, but what is the point of having air conditioning that takes at least four days to tum on? Oti a campus such as this, where so few buildings are equipped with air con- ditioning, students are used to the heat. However, they are also used to having some sort of place toes- cape too when the heat becomes to overwhelmin.g. Yes, Union College is equippedwithaphenomenal heat- ing system, one that often allows students to keep their windows open even when there are thre~ feet of snow on the ground. However, by my math I count two out of three terms that are predominantly warm and even go so far as being HOT. In addition, I only ceunt one term that has never required any type of cooling system in any.area of cam- pus. So, ifF all Tennand Spring Tenn usually include hot weather, and Winter Term is the only term that is definitely always cold, why bas the student body been denied appro- priate climate control? This is a problem that is often discussed but never solved. Just to assure everyone that this situation ·is not simply a case of ~oi1ed kids complaining, there are other, more serious, concerns; al- lergies and asthma. I have both and I finally discovered that I could re- quest to have an air conditioning unit in my bedroom. Unfortunately, I rarely do much more than sleep in ~y bedroom.

My God, I have never seen Union College more beautiful than it was for Alumni Weekend. It seems that a whole new shift of Grounds Crew was hired for the big event to prepare the flowerbeds, erect the myriad tents, and plant grass seed on thousands of square feet only to forget to supply con- stant water over the boiling weekend. Anyway, it appears that ReUnion Week- end is number one on the list of big-costing gigs at Union. And why not? It seems per-. fectly normal to me to spend thousands of dollars to im- press people who left years ago ... why bother with the students who actually still attend the col- lege?! But it was defmitely nice to see so many older people walking around our beautiful campus, older people who are SUTP,risingly proud of their institution (must be the free fireworks show). I wonder if they felt as neglected by the Ac:lminis~ tration 'during their years here as the students do now ? I was going to ask one alum that question but he distracted me by telling me the story of how he niet his wife fifty years ago while a student at U. What a sweetie.

Sitting a window of the Reamer Campus Center this past week I was treated to a very interesting view ofUnion College. It was not the type of view one gets when riding in an airplane. Nobody was particular small or dis- torted and if you were not looking for anything in particular then the view from this window was nothing special. However, on tltis particular day, I happened to be people watching. If you have never just watched people before then you are missing a very interesting and some time sat- isfying activity. The best place to do people watching is the mall. Any mall will do, but it must be done at a time that the particular mall that you have chosen is very crowded. Then just sit ba~k and watch the people as they pass by you. Trust me on this point, your observation skills will improve a ton. So here I was sitting in this win- dow just watching the students of Union College go about their daily business.

Gone was the empty space I was looking at, it was now filled with people of all shapes and sizes, sexes and races. In terms of people watching, however, it was rather tame. That was until I really looked at the make-up of the crowd. Just a mass of students, standing around talking with one another. People were laughing with one another, some people were smoking, others were just enjoying the weather, and I am very sure that still other stu- dents were also people watching. I had just settled in to watch all these new faces, when as quickly as they appeared in front of the Ca~pus Center they were gone, disappears into the shadows of light. hey, where'd she go? wink wink; nudge nudge.

It was the quickest I had ever seen a bunch of people move. The event, as I have begun to call it, I feel, will live on in the an- nals of people watching history. Most of the time when one is people watching there is no pattern to it. One just sits and watches people as they go by. Hence the name people watching, yet this time around there was not just a random · event. People showed up, stayed arom~d for ten minutes, and then were gone. Just like the wind. It was very strange. I am still going to spend time perched high in the Campus Cen- ter, staring down at the somewhat small people wandering around. Personally, I recommend people watching as a wonderful way to pass the time. I'm.sure that there is no better way to enjoy a sunny day if you have to be inside. Asforpeople watching, I will be avidly watching and searching for the next freak event.

It was not the type of view one gets when riding in an airplane. Nobody was particular small or dis- torted and if you were not looking for anything in particular then the view from this window was nothing special. However, on this particular day, I happened ' to be people watching. If you have never just watched people before then yoa are missing a very interesting and some time sat- isfying activity. The best place to do people watching is the mall. Any mall will do, but it must be done at a time that the particular mall that you have chosen is very crowded. Then just sit back and watch the people as they pass by you. Trust ,1 I ' I ,. ! '.

11, 2000 ·<lrnncnrnwnsi5 World News Revolutionaries Plunge Sierra L,eone and Region into· Turmoil British airliftover300 out of embattled country; UNPeacekeepers still caught in a precarious situation. by Philip Cbo Staff Writer Sierra Leone is in crisis again as rebels hold U.N. peacekeepers and as the British airlifts out evacuees. The siteofthis instabilty, Sierra Leone, is one of the poorest coun- tries on earth despite having some of the finest diamonds ever mined. Foday Sankoh is the leader of the rebel movement named the Revolutionary United Fr.ont (R.U.F. ). This group hopes and be- lieves that Sankoh will lead them to a brighter and better future. To nearly everyone else, he is a brutish man with a thuggish col- lection of kidnapped and often drugged~up soldiers, many of them preadolescent boys. For eight years, they have looted, raped, and mutilated their way through Sierra Leone, hack- ing off hands and arms in a cam- paign of terror. But, Sankob nei- ther sees guilt in or feels guilt for what his movement did. On May 8, 2000, thousands of rock-throwing demonstrators marched on Sanhok' s house and were met by Sankoh' s bodyguards who sprayed automatic-weapons, fire, and rocket,..propelled grenades at the crowd. At least four demonstrators were killed and dozens were injured. Within hours, soldiers from the country's various militias cruised the streets of the capital gripping machine guns. Meanwhile, Sanhok disappeared. U.N. peacekeepers were respon- siole for Sankoh's safety - de- . spite the fact that the United N a- tions says his rebels have been holding hundreds of peacekeepers captive for a week in the country's interior. Sankoh ·avidly denied these charges saying that \his soldiers never com.nlltted atrocities during the civil war; His followers never were holding any captives; He would never unleash violenceon JJis country.\ Sank:oh, has little in the way of a philosophy, and his political ideol- ogy circles around,one thing; dia- monds. The rebels control Sierra Leone's.rich diamond fields, fund- ing a brutal war with their profits. On May 9, 2000 thousands of ciyilians fled towards the Siena Leone capital ofFreetown follow- ing fighting between the army and rebels over control of a l<.ey town. According to the military, the battle took place after rebels from the R.U.F. attacked the town of Masiaka, located about 35 miles ?;- f:rom Freetown. Th.e town controls a highway leading to the seaside capital. Se- curity in the country has deterio- rated after several days of clashes between rebels, the army, and peacekeepers from the United Na- tions. Meanwhile, the Britishmilitary is evacuating 300 nationals and Eu- ropeans from Freetovmto Senegal. Fearful of another outbreak of civil war in Sierra Leone, hundreds of citizens have fled to Guinea. 500 U.N. peacekeepers, composed of Zambians, are thought to have. :· News Analysis: Pentagon Admits to Numbers Mistake by Stephen Nemeth World News Editor The controversial bombing cam- paign last year that led to the ouster of Serbian forces from Kosovo has once again t:ome back to haunt the military. On Tuesday, the Pentagon con- ceded that the amount ·of military equipment it said were destroyed was exaggerated. This admission comes as a re- sult of a year-long assessment of bomb footage, camera footage, on s1te inspections, and testimonials that vastly differs from estimates · during and after the air war. This disclosure also raises ques- tions in the original intent of the mission and of the intent of the military establishment After the campaign last year . NATO and US officials claimed during the seventy-eight day op- eration that it had destroyed ninety-three tanks, 153 armored personnel carriers and 389 artillery pieces. The results of the assessment preliminarily show that the multi-· national forces destroyed only fourteen tanks, twelve 11 Self pro- pelled artillery vehicles,\ eighteen armored personnel carriers, eight artillery and mortar pieces and 142 other military vehicles. These results show a difference of 780 pieces of equipment be- tween the air war estimate and the new findings. However, the Pentagon claims that the Serbs salvaged mucb. of the equipment destroyed by NATO forces in order to minimize its losses. Officials at the Defense Depart- ment also support the accuracy of their assessment method during the war which included ground and aerial reconnaissance. Air Force Brigadier General John D. W. Corley, speaking to reporters, stauncly denied that NATO forces had intentionally exaggerated the number of targets destroyed, \In no way have we ever overstated, understated\ the effectiveness of the air campaign, he said. These fmdings are controversial because they have manifold ef- fects. First, if the numbers prove true, it shows that the reliance that American military commanders place on air power is overvalued and that aircraft are no longer a vi- ab.le platform for weapons delivery. Secondly, the results would also validate the arguments of the: op- ponents of the air operation; and those that supported the invasion of ground forces to end the atroci- ties committed by the Serbs against the Kosovars. Third, the numbers would also validate what Serbian Presi.dent Slobodan Milosevic stated at the conclusion of the air war; that the NATO bombings of ground forces in Kosovo - as opposed to strate- gic bombing of Serbian cities; was less effective than NATO led the public to believe. Pentagon Spokesman Kenneth Bacon stated that the argument of how many tanks and military equip- ment was destroyed was beside the point, \We obviously hit enough tanks and other tatgets.to win,\ he said. Regardless of whether or not the numbers really matter, it still shows NATO and the United States that · they both still has not completed their prime goal for intervening in Kosovo; to create a thriving, peace- ful, multiethnic, and democratic Kosovo. It also reminds the public that its troops are and will probably have to be employed for a number of years to frrst ensure protection of the various ethnic groups and the compliance ofthe treaty that ended the air campaign. The admission of the Pentagon that its numbers may have exag- gerated also undennines the pub- lic confidence in the Defense De- partment. During the GulfWar, command- ers constantly praised the effec- tiveness of \smart bombs~', AirLand tactics, and Patriot mis- siles. Over the course of years it has come to the attention of the public that none of the technologically advanced weapons deployed in the Gulf War lived Up to their hype. This endangers the li-ves of sol- diers, and deceives the public in su.pportirtg weapon,s and programs . that are neither cost effective nor militarily effective .. been taken hostage by Sank:oh's forces. The United Nations has lost contact with two large groups of these peacekeepers. The United States is prepared to provide lo- gistical supportto U.N. troops, of- fering resources such as air traffic controllers who could help coor- dinate the movement of U.N .. peacekeepers. Bu.t, American offtcia:ls said that there are no plans to send' Ameri- can combat troops to assist the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Si- err~Leop.e. Sierra Leone military authorities say they are currently holding S~oh at a defense outpost. 'Ih.e military reported that it decided to hold Sankoh in protective custo~y because it feared the probability ofwidespread chaos if something ha,ppened to him. Sierra Leone has often lived a bloody existence, andit seeltlS that it isfated to once again. The mili- tary and the rebels are at it agam, with. the U.N. peacekeepers smack in tlte middle of the war. The civil war in Sierra Leone is a complicating one. Looking at the history of Sie:tta Leone, its easy to se~why. The most important situation took place in 1991 when Rebel leader Foday Sankoh and his Revo• lutionary United Front took up arms in 1991. Then, President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah took office on March 29, 1996 after wi.nning multi-party elections. His election ended four years of army rule. Dis- gruntled saldiers toppled kabbah in May 1997. The Nigerian led ECOMOG intervention force re~ storedhimtopower in Match 1998. This was the ftrst time in Africa that lleighboring states had re- stored a leader after a coup. Then, K.abbah andSankoh signed a fresh peacedealinTogoonJuly7, 1999, giving the rebels seats in g()vem- tnent It is obvious that the fighting has alot to do with the plentiful dia- monds foUild within the country, as well as various other natural goods. It is a unique civil war because, in a sense, the rebels have a legiti- mate position within the govern- ment Yet, they are fighting the mili- tary. It will be interesti;ng to see what happens.

But, Sankoh nei- ther sees guilt in or feels guilt for what his movement did. On May 8, 2000, thousands of rock-throwing demonstrators marched on Sanhok's house and were met by Sankoh' s bodyguards who sprayed automatic-weapons, fire, and rocket-propelledgrenades a.t the crowd. At least four demonstrators were killed and dozens were injured. Within hours, soldiers from the country's various militias cruised the streets of the capital gripping machine guns. Meanwhile, Sanhok disappeared. U.N. peacekeepers were respon- si~le for Sankoh' s safety - de- spite the fact that the United Na- tions says his rebels have been holding hundreds ofpeacekeepers captive for a week in the country's interior. Sankoh avidly denied these charges saying that \his soldiers never committed atrocities during the civil war; His followers never were holding any captives; He would never unleash violenceon his country.\ Sankoh, has little in the way of a philosophy, and his political ideol- ogy circles aroun<l one thing; dia- monds. The rebels control Sierra Leone's rich diamond fields, fund- ing a brutal war with their profits. On May 9, 20()0 thousands of ciyilians fled towards the Sierra Leone capital ofFreetown follow- ing fighting between the army and rebels over control of a key town. According to the military, the battle took place after rebels from the R.U.F. attacked the town of Masiaka, located about 35 miles from Freetown. The town controls a highway leading to the seaside capital.

This disclosure also raises ques- ttons in the original iHtent of the mtssion and of the intent of the military establishment After the campaign last year . NATO and US officials claimed during the seventy-eight day op- eration that it had destroyed ninety-three tanks. 153 armored personnel carriers and 389 artillery p1eces. The results of the assessment preliminarily show that the multi-· national forces destroyed only fourteen tanks. twelve \self pro- pelled artillery vehicles,\ eighteen armored personnel carriers, eight artillery and mortar pieces and 142 other military vehicles. These results show a difference of 780 pieces of equipment be- tween the air war estimate and the new findings. However. the Pentagon claims that the Serbs salvaged much of the equipment destroyed by NATO forces m order to minimize its losses. Officials at the Defense Depart- ment also support the accuracy of their asscssmc:nt method during the war which included ground and aerial reconnaissance. Atr Force Brigadier General John D. W. Corky. speaking to reporters. stauncly denied that NATO forces had intentionally exaggerated the number of targets destroyed, \In no way have we t:ver overstated. understated\ the effectiveness of the air campatgn, he said. The~.e findings arc controversial because they have manifold ef- fects. First, if the numbers prove true, it shows that the reliance that American military commanders place on air power is overvalued and that aircraft are no longer a vi- able platform for weapons delivery. Secondly, the results would also validate the arguments of the op- ponents of the air operation; and those that supported the invasion of ground f()rces to end the atroci- ties committed by the Serbs against the Kosovars. Third, the numbers would also validate what Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic stated at the conclusion of the air war; that the NATO bombings of ground forces in Kosovo - as opposed to strate- gic bombing of Serbian cities was less effective than NATO led the public to believe. Pentagon Spokesman Kenneth Bacon stated that the argument of how many tanks and military equip- ment was destroyed was beside the point, \We obviously hit enough tanks and other targets to win,\ he said. Regardless of whether or not the numbers really matter. it still shows ~.'\TO and the L 1 nited States that they both still has not completed their prime goal for intervening in Kosovo: to create a thriving. peace- ful, multiethnic, and democratic Kosovo. It also reminds the puhlic that its troops are and will probably have to be employed for a number of · years to first ensure protection of the various ethnic groups and the compliance of the treaty that ended the air campaign .. The admission of the Pentagon that its numbers may have exag- : gerated also u11derrnines the pub- lic confidence in the Defense De- partment. During the Gulf War, command- ers constantly praised the effec- tiveness of \smart bombs\ AirLand tactics, and Patriot mis- siles. Over the C()urse of years it has come to the attention of the public that none of the technologically advanced weapons deployed in the GulfWarlived up to their hype. This endangers the lives of sol- diers, and deceives the public in supporting weapons and programs that are neither cost effective nor militarily effective. been taken hostage by Sankl><h's forces. The United Nations has Lost contact with two large groups of these peacekeepers. The Un,ited States is prepared to provide lo- gisticalsupporttoU.N. troop-s, of- fering resources such as air traffic cont:F01lers who could help coor- dinate the movement of U.N. veacekeepers. But, American officials saiJ ihat there are no plans to send Ameri- can combat troops to assist the U.N. peacekeeping mission ia Si- erra Leone. Siena Leone tnilitary authorities say they are currently ho !cling Sankoh at a defense outpost The military reported that it decided to hold Sankoh in protective cmstody because it feared the probability of widespread chaos if something happened to him. Sierra Leone has often lived a bloody existence, and it seeiDS that it is fated to once again. The mili- tary and the rebels are at it again, with the U.N. peacekeepers smack in the middle of the war. The civil war in Sierra Leone is a complicating one. Looking ai the history of Sierra Leone, its easy to see why. The most important situiltion took place in 1991 when R..ebel leader Foday Sankoh a.Rd his Revo- lutionary United Front took up arms in 1991. Then, President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah took office on March. 29, 1996 after winning multi-party elections. His election endedfouryears ofarmymle. Dis- gruntled soldiers toppled Kabbah in May 1997. The Nigerian led ECOMOG intervention force re- stored himto power in Ma:t:ch 199&. This was the f'rrst time in Africa that neighboring states had re- stored a leader after a coup. Then, Kabbah and San.koh signed a fresh peace deal in Togo on July 7, 1999, giving the rebels seats in govern- ment. It is obvious 'that the fighting has alot to do with the plentiful dia- monds found within the country, as well as various other natural goods. It is a unique civil war because, in a sense, the tebels have a legiti- mate position within the govern- ment. Yet, they are fighting the mili- tary. It will be interesting to see what happens. The U.N. peacekeepers are between a rock and hard place, trying to end fighting. Meanwhile, the two sides are fighting their hardest. It is hoped that one day Sierra Leone can achieve true peace. h ere ..•... ,.helJ are l ~ t.hies ·t srnoo frUI floW!! outch tto at Available in: StrawberrY Orange PineaPPle Uerv BerrY .

Buf!Ythe Va~npireSlayerandAngel: Two OfTelevision'.sBest by Jessica· Brea.rtcm Sto.ff Writer A few years back, when a maga- zine fustnamedBuffithe Van:zpire Slayer the best drama series on television, I remember sh()wing the article to my best friend with a cer: tain degree ofvindication. To see someone, especially someone paid for their supposed discerning taste in television, name my favor- ite show the best was. naturally nice; but especially nice because the show was Bujjy the Vampire Slayer. Why? Simply because rarely could I get the name of the show out without seeing the person I was talking to smile mdulgently with a degree of saFcasm. The show is a hard sell - ·\You see, there's this show, and it's about this girl, the slayer, whohassuper- human powers that enable her to kill vampires. Oh, and her name's BufiY.\ If nothing else, Bujfy the Vam- pire Slayer requires a formidable suspension of disbelief. It calls on the viewer to be willing to believe in dark forces, witches, andmagic for the hour the show is on. But once the Viewer does give him or herself over to this world created by the show, he or shewill discover a compelling, well-written; and original show unlike anything else on television. The two shows air back t() back Tuesday nights and are an excep- tionally c:ompau'ble package. They are. overseen by the same person,. and often engage ii1 stories that reach across the two shows, with characters from one showing up on thenther weeks later.

The epi- sodes strongly de:tnon~trated the differences between the two shows. Bu.f!Y the Vampire Slayer is, I sus- pect, a .difficult show for fust-time viewers (though I -do recommend checking it out). It relies strongly .... on what can be called arcs, sto- ries that carry beyond individual episodes and enact themselves over the course t;>f several epi- sodes or an entire season. It's one of those rare shows wrongs already commiteed.

Gladiator Overwhelms the ·Senses What Happened to by Jason B.,wers Contributing Writer The most anticipated movie of the year, sofar, came through with- out a doubt. The star of the movie, Russell Crowe, is petfect for the· role. For those of y-ou who don't know Russell Crowe, he bas been in movies like The lnsit!er and L.A. Confidential. Right now he has one of those faces tha1 you may recognize but not know the name. I assure you, afte1 this movie you will know exactly who he is. Russell Crowe has p1obably been thrown into superstardom because of this movie. The movie starts out dur- ing the Roman Empire around 150 AD. Th~ fust scene islocated somewhere in Germania where the Ro- man army is prepa:ring for battle against a savage band of Germans. The army is led lby the great Roman general Maxi- mus, played by Russ(ill Crowe. Maximus gives his fmalorders and within five minutes of the start of the film a battle endures. Maxirnus .fights with his men like he is a regular soldier. In doing this, the general earns an enor- mous amount of resJJect from his men. The aging R-oman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, played by Rich- ard Harris, observed the battle. After the battle, the emperor commends Maximus for his cour- age and honor in the battle, show- ing much affectil>'n f<lf the great general. Rumors had lleen spreading for' some time that the emperor was dying and that he was to name his successor soon-. ln a conversation betweenMaximus and Marcus, the empef()r surprisingly namedMaxi- mus as his successor feating that his son wa.s not fit to lead the great Roman Empire. Commodus, the jealous son <>f the emperor, played by Joaquin Pheonix, is told that he is not to take thetbrone, of the empire. Dev- astated by the news, Commod'Us kills.bisfather and takes. the throne claiming that Marcus died of natu- ral causes. Immediately ComJ11.odus orders the execution ()f Maximus. Barely escaping his execution, Maxjmus flees from Gennania with only one goal: to get home to his wife and son. Maximus returns home, only to fmd his wife and son brutally murdered. Maximus, found by their graves, is taken int() captivity as a slave. He is sold and trained as a gladiator. Max1mus eventually fights in Rome and because ofhis mastery, is forcedto meet the new emperor, Comnlodus. By far the most poVI- erful seene in the movie, Maxim'Us reveals his identity by scaring Commodus. The new emperor 1ries to kill Maximus severaltimes in the Coliseum, but the genetal defeats everything ranging from tigers to chatiots. Forallofyououtthei'ewho like Vic;>lence and sword fights, the figh.t scenes in the Coliseum are -uibe- lievable. The people loveMaximus so much that he becomes m()re popular than the emperor. In the last scene, Commodu5 brings Maximus befDre the people of the Coliseum, and fights him alone. I will notre- veal what happens, obviously that would ruin the end of the movie.

I've read every Dirk Pitt book mid, for awhile, I wanted to grow up to be just like him. The man is almo~t as cool as Thcmas Crown from The ThomasCrownA.ffair. If you have neverread a Cussler book then you need to know that Cussler has developed a formula for his books that he doesn't deviate :from You do have to take into consid- eration that Clive must come up with an original way to destroy the world every two years! These are the stock events in a Dirk Pitt novel. There will he a car chase in a clas- sic automobile. There will be some mega-rich arch-villain who wants to kill many people for personal profit There will be a situation In which there is no way the woman will sur- vive, yet Dirk manages to save her ··anyway. You w.iHgettheexactsame descriptions of all the reoccurring characters that were in the previ- ous books. You must, however, learn to accept this because, like I said, these books are fun, which is ultimately what brings me back. After all, fiction is supposed to be entertaining. While Atlantis Found is better than the stuff Clive put out in the early 1990s, it still falls short of his early works. In past books, the his- toric event of the prologue was somewhat of a mystery and actu- ally became an important part of the plot. Not in this book. Also, in parts the book takess()me very un- believable turns, However, I still enjoyed this book aad was able t() finish it off in a week If you're new ta Cussler's books, you won't care about any of this.

This theory is explained · more thoroughly within his book. This idea is quite possibly, according to these supporters, the \missing link\ that Einstein was futilely looking for. rgan _ ...... splantation The last speaker to come to the Nott Memorial for the \Perspectives in the Nott\ lecture series was Brian Greene. The current professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University, gave a talk entitled \Explaining the Elegant Universe.\ This was a general discussion of the topics within his book The Elegant Universe. This recent best-selling book probes the depths of the math- ematical and theoretical physics which have given rise to the String Theory or \superstrings.\ Origi- nating from twenty to thirty years of work done by Albert Einstein, this theory has gotten some theoretical physicists excited in the past half-century. Around 1920, Einstein had come out with his Special Theory of Relativity, and subsequently the General Theory of Relativity. A theory which revolutionizes our understanding of the way gravity works. For the rest of his life Einstein attempted to combine the forces describing the interactions of masses on a very large scale with the forces which described masses on a very small scale. These two concepts are called, re- spectively, Einstein own \General Theory ()f Relativity\ and the· \Quantum Theory. •• Unfortunately, he was not successful with this compelling endeavor. Today many theorists are trying to follow in Einstein's footsteps to find the all-encompassing \Quan- tum Theory of Gravity.\ Trying to pick up where Einstein left off in Superstring theory, also known as '~String Theory,\ is sometimes described as\ twenty-first century mathematics that just happened to be discovered in the 20th century.\ Everyone has looked at the back:. medical advance.

The fight for limited hearts, lungs, kidneys, and livers has become a nationwide battle which, as oflast month, reached the United States Congress.

The basic premise behind the theory is that on a size scale, much too small to be currently observed ( lx I 0· 33 meters or the Planck Length), tiny little strings are constantly vibrating at different frequencies, much like the strings of a guitar, or a violin. These different frequencies, like the different notes played on a stringed instrument, are what give the different particles, such as the electron, the quark, and proton, their defining characteristics. Ever since this idea of a Grand Unified Theory (GU'T) has been around, the idea of Su-perstrings has certainly been the most popular and probably one of the more successful attempts to close in on a theory of everything from its conception. Information was taken from The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene, and special thanks to Dr. Michael Langham of the UniversityofNorth if it reaches the President's desk, essentially overturns a federal regulation giving the Department of Health and Human Services the authority to ensure that the sickest patients are given priority when organs are available. Instead, the House would rath.er have organs distributed geognphically. This current system divides the country into 62 local areas (rang- ing :in population from one to twelve million) and eleven larger regions. When an organ becomes available, it is offered locally, then regionally, and finally, in rare cases, nationally. The conservatives' argument is that their plan keeps allocation of vital organs out of the bands of federal bureaucrats and p. laces it in the hands oflocal conununities. The reality is that their :pEan -pre- serves the existing imbalance in the transplantation process~ namely the denial of organs to patients who may need them with. more ur- gency than those patients that ac- tually receive the organs, and thus resulting in harm to possible trans- plant recipients. The ability to remove an organ from one individual and :place it meclical advance. It gives hope to milLions of Americans who have debilitating diseases such as Primary Pulmonary Hypertension or Cirrhosis, which effect the lungs and Liver, Iespectively, as well those who su.ffer from kidney or heart failure. For such patients, organ transplantation is not merely another possible treatment; it is the last., and often the only treatment. It is a risky one, however, and even if the surgery is successful, the tra11splant recipient faces a long and arduous battle against organ rejection, so named because the bo<iy's immune system effectively \rejects\ the foreign organ. The patient will likely suffer numerous \rejection episodes\ ancl be placed on a strict diet and exercise regiment. Then there are the medically prescribed drugs as transplant recipients often take as many as 30 or more pills per day, many with counteracting and frustrating side effects. Among th()se likely to be experienced include nausea, mood swings, indigestion, fatigue, insomnia, and increased susceptibility to illness, the latter symptom being caused by ihe required doses of immuno- suppressants. Taken alone, immunosuppres- sants serve as an effective microcosm of the transplant recipient's entire ordeal. He/ she is presented with a Hobson's choice: either take the immunosuppres- sants and weaken your own immune system to the point where it can no longer successfully fight offa common cold or refuse them and place yourself at heightened risk for immediate organ rejection. Th:is poses quite a quandary, yet it is one that many patients, due to lack -of organ donors and an ineffi- cieni transplantation network, never get the chance to face. The possible solutions to this problem are both complicated and vague. First and foremost, aware- ness about organ donation and transplantation needs to be raised substantially. A nationwide effort must be launched in order to encourage, while still respecting religious and spiritual objections, .donation as possible. Educational institu- tions aFe, in fact, a wonderful place to start. High schools need to pmvide students with the literattlre and facts needed to make an informed decision. Granted, organ donation is a sensitive and often politically and Feligiously charged subject, but ifsexually transmitted disease prevention and drug/alco- hol abuse awareness are already taught as part ()[health education cwricuhnns nationwide, then why not transplantation as well?

Women's Lacrosse: State Champs Dutchwomen Han,dle Nazareth in Finals with Win; 19-9 by Rachel Bukowski Sports EJitor The Union College Women's La- crosseTeam made history this past week, becoming tb.e first Union Womeh 's Lacrosse Team to win the NYSWCAA Lacrosse Tourna- ment. They are also the second Union Women's Athletic Team to win the New York State Champianships, as Women's Soccer accomplished this· in the Fall of 1999. They de- feated number one seeded Nazareth College in the finals, 19~9, ending their season on an exhilarating note. The only downside of the week- end for the Dutchwomen was that they were looked over for a bid to the NCAA Championships despite their New York State Champion- ship win and overall record of 10-6 for the season. Losses to the University of Rochester and Hamilton College late in the season contributed to this decision by the NCAA selec- tion committee. Union's record, however, is not reflective of the level of competi- tion they faced this season. Four of Union's six losses came against teams ranked nationally in the top ten for Division liT Schools such as Bowdoin, Middlebury, William Smith and Williams. On Wednesday,May3, the num- ber three seeded.

Frem this point on, Union will hurtwre the performances of each athlete with hopes that they will continue to flomish. On a more statistical note, the Union men placed 9th out of 14 teams with 35 team }}oints while the women placed tltirteenth out of 15 teams with a t<Jtal of 19 team pqints. Specifically, there are five Union seniors who deserve attention: Jordanna Malla.ch, Carrie Cieslow~ki, Kenny Scott, Stefan Bagnato, and Bryan Roy. These five athletes have spent countless hours wandering through the realin of track and field, a sport in which only the dedicated succeed. It is· important to touch upon one spe- cific meet where all the passion that was wound up tightly inside was released: the state championships. Jorda!lna Mallach has flirted with reality several times this sea- son. This past weekend she pole vaulted 9 feet 1 inch, which put her very close to the qualifying mark for an NCAA Qualification.

Men's LAX Concludes Best Season in Five Years Despite Winning Record, Dutchmen Denied ECA C Playoff Bid by Rachel Bukowski Sports Editor The Union College Men's La- crosse ream ended their season this past week with a victory against SUNY Oswego, which put · them in !lil excellent position to re- ceive a l>id to the ECAC playoffs. However, on Monday, May 7, the recipients ofbids were announced and Union was not on the list this year. · Alth(Jugh the team was disap- pointed with the committee's deci- sion, Ul1ion Men's Lacrosse had their best season in the past five years. The Dutchmen had a win-• ning overall record of8-6, and they came ill second in the UCAA leag\le ':v-itha 3-2record. . On Ttlesday, May 2, the Dutch- men to<Jk on Williams College in a highly (Oinpetitive contest. Union started the game strong and kept- the score close through the first quarter;, which ended with Williams holding cnto a one point lead, 3-2. It appeared as ·if it might be a close contest, but the Union offensive attack fell apart in the second quar- ter. Williams scored six .goals in the second quarter, while the Dutch- men could only answer with three of their own. As the hom sounded for the end of the second half, the Dutchmen found themselves be- hind, 9-5, a, significant margin, but it .not impossible for this team to overcome. In the third period, Union im- proved their level of play and only allowed in three goals from the Ephs, while responding with a few of their own. However, the Dutch- men fell apart again in the fourth period when their level ofplay w.as most crucial, and they allowed in another six goals from Williams. The final score was l8-10,. Will- iams. Notable performances were turned in by Nick Balascio, who had three goals for the Dutchmen and Scott Dutcher and Russ Kerbel who each put in two. Kurt Kimball also contributed one goal and five assists. On Saturday, May 6, the Dutch- men returned home for their fmal game of the season against SUNY Oswego. Although it seemed as if Oswego was mounting a comeback at some points, Union always main- tained control of the game and of the scoreboard. The Dutcrunen led, 5-3, at tlle end of the fusthalf, and maintained this two-point lead in the third pe- riod, which ended with Union win- ning, 8-6. The Dutclrnten went into the fi- nal quarter of the game and ex- ploded offensively and defen- sively. While the Union defense only allowecl two goals dl!ring the quarter, the.<>ffense put four goals in the Osweg() net, and the game ended with aJJ exciting Union vic- tory, 12-8. Dutcher finished with an incred- ible six goals; half of the Union score. Kurt Kimball added a goal and three assists, while Sopho- more Goalie Patrick Forrest fin- ished with 13saves on 21 shots on goal. This was the Dutchmen's fmal game of the 20{)0 season, and with this, the teamh.ad to bid farewell to their three graduating senior cap- tains, Defense111en Nick Goater and Jordan Thornas and Midfielder Colin Muxd()ck. The presence and leadership ()f the Seniors wi11 be greatly missed by the Men's LAX team. However, the team now looks to a bright ·fu- ture with a y()Ui.lg and promising team.

\Everyone thinks ofcha.l_lging the world, but no one thinks of changing himself.\ ._, · -Leo Tolstoy · U2K Proposal for New Housing System by MithaeiS. McGuire .Etlito1'-in.-Chief The U2K Steering Contmittee has released its latest report, en- titled \A : 1 Ipposal for Residential and Social Life at Union.\ , There- port, which may be read in its en- . tirety on pages six and seven, rec- ommends changes in alcohol policy, rushing, pledging and hous- ing. These reconunenda,tions are based .upon three \key p:rinciples\ . which we(oe outline& ill. th~ \Pre~ Iiminary lleporL\ They involved dissociatl11g the Greek system . \from gtPU..JlS that engage in regr¢s- sive activities such as hazing and alcohol ~lluse;\ rectifying \a sys- tem of unequal privilege in hous- ing and access to social space;\ and \facl.llty need to participate more .in the: ()Ut-of-cl'!ss intellectual life of the campus:\ In the section entitled \Proposal for the Fnture of Greek Life,\ the committee ~utlmes\t; prop()s~d to preserve \()ur traditional Greeksys_ .. tern withilli a new social construct at Unionc..\ To do so, they consid- ered if Greek organizations should continue tD~ be· selective, single-sex, residential and have pledging. The committee concluded that \allfolll' of the chat'acte:tistics cited above, which currently defme most ofour Greek organizations, remain as op- tions, as recommended QY the Greek leadership and the Student- Fo11Im.\ In light ofthe change to Sopho- mere Rush next year, the commit- tee also recqmtnended that \Greek houses be granted twenty percent leeway as long as every eligible member of the group is jn resi- dence. This pplicy should stay in place until the implementation ·Of the new House System, at which time there will be more residences avai~able for smaller groups.\ The committee proposesa \zero- . tolerance policy for acts of hazing that are dangerous, coercive or which interfere. with teaching and leiuning, We believe that theme or Greek groups. that engage in these activities should be banned.forrn the campus,_ and that athletes or club members wh<> are fow1dguilty should be banned from their .spol't .. or activity.'' , , . _ The Steering Committee further _ proposes, as mentioned above, a new \House System.\ The sys- tem \will be comprised of twelve houses. and every Union student willl:Je assigned randomly to mem- bershlp in one of them prior .to ar- riving as a freshman.\ The goal of this system is to generate a con- ne<;t~on to the college through the House. Ea9hhouse willhaveresi- _dent members, however the actual number of members will range from 120 to 240, ail of which will be eli- gible to participate in house gov- ernance and activities. The houses will be expected to \contribute in- tellectual, cultural and social events to the campus, participate in ori- enting new students, spo11:sor com- munity service projects, and field teams fo~ intramural competition.\ In order to make the traris\tion to the House System, the committee recommends thatsome fraternities and theme houses move from where they are currently located to accornidate the new houses needed. In addition, Lamont, Silliman and 1248 Lenox Road will be made available for student resi- dences. In recommending that no Greek or Theme Houses retain a permanent claim to their current homes, a new committee ·may now redistribute housing to these groups. The report states that \all current resident organizations would continue to have housing subject to the SAC housing review guidelines.\ With respect to new social ini- tia1ives, the committee proposed that Union institute a common al- cohol policy, devised by a commit- tee involving the college attorn~y, Associate Dean of Students, .a,nd five students appointed by Stu- dent Forum. The report also su,g- gest~ a common, non-residential social space be created for \gen- eral student use\ with the purpose of hosting \large parties, concerts, · or other social or academic pro- gramming.\ In conclusion, the report ex- . plains how the House System wiiJ resolve four key problems: l. Union's reputation as a Greek dominated campus discourages some students from applying and _ some faculty from accepting job offers ~often those who are h>ok- ingfor campuses that are more in- . tellectually and·politically active. 2. The current allocation of prime . real estate is unfair. 3. We need to involve faculty more in the out-of..the classroom lives of students and invigorate the in- tellectual life ofthe campus. 4. Union, like most ofhigher edu- cation and society at large, is of- · ten too balkanized- men separate from women, one race from another~ international from domestic, ath- leticteammembers from non-mem- bers, etc. Each of these problems and their solutions are explained in detail on page seven. Committee released its latest re- port, \A Proposal for Residential and Social Life at Union.\ The sig- nificance ofthis report is so great f±a:..Concordiensis feels it js nec- essary to include a front-page edi- torial to emphasize its importance. Union College has reached a critical juncture in its history. It must decide whether it wants to continue to be a well-respected academic institution or if it will be left behind in an era of progress and forward thinking. At such a pivotal time, Concordiensis -be- lieves that it is our responsibility to impress upon the student body the importance of maintaining tra- dition while at the same time adapt- ing these very traditions so that they may better serve the academic and social interests of the school. This week, the U2K Steering Committee released the latest ver- sion of the U2K Report. We can only hope that this report is not met wi~ the <;riticism that is typi- cal of Union College: the report mandates change and change is bad. What we as students must acknowledge is that change is nec- essary, and what we have the power to do is affect what those Continued on page 10 Accepted Students on the Rise Op/Ed: Forum Motives- Questioned 13 A year in • rev1ew by LaurenTabas . \ Staff Writer At present there are a total of five-hundred and ninety students in Union College's Class of 2004. The size of this class is one and a half percent larger then last year's class, yet according to Dan Lundquist Dean of A~ssions, it has similar statistics to that of last year's. This number of students is ex- pected to drop 5% before. classes begin in the fall. The 5% depletion is due to two variables, the \sum- mer melt\ and Albany Medical School's ongoing admissions. \Sunifner melt \ is a: term used ' . to label those students who have put down a deposit at Union but over the summer choose to either . defer acceptance, get off a waitlist at an~ther school and chose to go there, or take a year off and ex- plore their options. The Albany Medical School fac- tors in with the Eight- Year Medical ~~~~~~~~~~~~ program Union offers. While Union has already admit- ted their students Albany is now beginning to take some students off their waitlist and some of these Admissions anticipates the arrival of the class of 2004. students include some who were accepted to Union. The incoming freshman class is lal'ger than the current freshman, sophomore and junior classes, but not the senior cla8s. \As one large class leaves, another large one is coming in,\ said Lundquist. The reason the senior class and the incoming freshman have simi- lar size bas to do with the fluctuat- ing yield. This means that for every 100 students admitted to Union Col- lege, thirty-two will come; which is an increase of one percent frem last year, Since the time when the seniors arrived at Union as freshmen the nwnber ofstudents that had come to Union per hundred had dropped but are now back up. There are a number of benefits and downfalls to having a large freshman class. Having more fresh- men means that there will be less room in on-campus housing, which in tum will allow Residence Life to releasejuniors to live off-campus. There are only thirty-five to forty extra students at Union presently, so Admissions and Residence Life are hoping that it will not impact housing tremendously. The second benefit or downfall of a large incoming class of stu- dents is that Academic Affairs will be pressured to attain more pro- fessors for Fteshman Preceptorials. Lastly, because there are will be more students, more revenue will be brought in for the college. The school's budget is regu- lated for 520 incoming students. The extra students will be bringing in extra money .Finances can only be negatively effected if too little students emoll. Lunquist believes that the Class of2004 will be very similar to last year;s class in terms of the types of students who will arrive here in the fall. As always there are lots of achievement, leadership, and high academic abilities among the ac- Continued on page J :~

·, I Campus News (II.llltt.orbien~is e May 18, 2000 • Page 3 Seward Changes Continue ••• continued from page I Admissions by Shaniwn Pryor Contributing Writer In response to the initiative made by Union College in thepw- chasing and renovating of hous- ing on Se~ard Plac;e, Schenecmdy has begun a project that will be seen as their contribution to this initiative. The city is planning on com- pletely redoing the look of Seward Place to match the work already done by the college. One main feature of the w()rk will be a sidewalk on the campus side of the street. In order for this to be possible. the north lane of Seward will be narrowed. Not only will the narrowing of the road make room for a nf(w side- walk, but it is hoped that the nar- rower roadway will ~a use traffic to slowdown. The size of the islands in the middle ofthe street will also be re- duced. The street will have new paving as well as curbing. The existing sidewalk on the south side of Seward Place -will aJso be re- paired. Union will be participating in the project by widening the entrance way into West parking lot so it will match that of Huron Street creat- ing a safer intersection. The intersections at Huron and The latest Seward construction. South Streets as well as the main intersections of Union Street and Nott Street will have specialized paving and landscaping. Addition- ally historic light posts will be placed along the street. . · Furthering tlle aesthetic appeal of the street will be the placement of all power lin.es underground. Some students llave noticed that in order to perform such a task, many trees on Seward Place have been cut down this past week. Junior Emily Barton connnented \I questioned why the tree in front of our house was cut down and li~ said that it was half dead. That was not true. I don't understattd why some perfectly healthy trees were cut down just to make a pretty sidewalk. Even if new trees are planted it will take years to have them grow to the size the old ones were.\ Assistant Director of Camp11s Operations Loren Rucinski ex.- GolfTournament Benefit by Clare Canal News Writer This past Sunday,Union College hosted the second annual <.:harity golf tournament at Eagle Crest Golf Course. This year's charity was Big Brothers/Big Sisters. The event organized by junior Me- chanical Engineer Erik Raymond had 25 participants ranging from son and mother team~ to Dean of Students Fred Alford. The tournament was a two-per- son team best ball scramble. Each pair worked together by hitting successive shots from the better of the two balls hit. The player with the worst shot would pick their ball up and hit from their partner's spot as well. Therefore, the f1na1 score after eighteen holes of golf was a combination of both players' games. Due to Mother's Day, participa- tion in the tournament dropped from last year but players were still very pleased aboat the day's events. The competitiveness var- ied among participants on all dif- ferent levels. After the frrst nine holes of golf, players were able to stop off in the clubhouse and enjoy a lunch ofhot dogs and hamburgers or even a salad wrap for the vegetarians. Each team enjoyed the luxury of golf carts, quickly carrying them from ball to ball and helping on those rare occasions when a ball didn't stay on the fairway. After the back nine holes of golf were completed, the participants Courtesy of Clare Canill Mother and son enjoy an afternoon of golf on Mothers Day. fmished offtheday &fgolfby en- joying a buffet dinner.

Campu~: News Sushi Becomes Art Symposium Dicusses Sexual Assault by Kristen Zadourian News Editor Only three weeks left to try the new Sushi at the Rathskellar! Se- nior Marius Calin has been the Sushi artist at the Rathskellar this term. Cal in an arts minor has found a new way to bring his int~rest in sculpting and art if.lto the food in- dustry. Calin noted, \Each roll ha.s the ability to be a beautiful piece of artwork as well as a culinary treat.\ Furthermore, Cal in de- scribed the making of the rolls say- ing, \I start with an image in my head and improvise.\ He continued, \All the ingredi- ents are there and it is up to me to make it interesting while at the same time keeping the taste.\ Calin attributes most of his knowledge of scuplting to Profes- sor Duncan who is head of the Arts Department. Calin does not fee 1 that he is inspired by the style of any renowned sculpters, he is not trying to conform to a style but to start his own ideas. Calin wants to pursue his culi- nary interest by perhaps going to a culinary institute after graduation. however he noted that his interest in culinary school is not necesarrily to lead down a path ofbecoming a chef. but more so he can obtain some experience and learn to scuplt works ofart with food. Cal in said, \I want to revolution- ize the culinary world with a sculpt- ing influence.\ Steve Pearse, Director of Dining by A vrumJoffe and Ariadne Papagapitos Contributing Writers .

We realized afiet this discussion that sexual assault needs to be ad- dressed immediately by students, faculty and administration and we have to work collectively towards eliminating the tension and fear that surrounds the issue. We are too willing to ignore the prevalence of such a serious of- fense because it could taint the school's name, when we should be choosing to face it and prevent its occurrence. Softball Marathon For Charity · Safe Space has recently been con~ • ducting ~ross talks on the issue at . fraternities and theme houses. This can be achieved by step- ping away from personal restraints and opening up to the discussion of sexual assault. Individuals should not have to fear the reac- tions of fellow students when they desire to speak their nrinds. by Eugene D. Schultz Staff Writer Thursday, May 11, was the Eigh- teen Annual twenty-four hour Phi Delta Theta Softball Marathon. The event, which is held every Spring raises money for charity. This year· s money will be donated to the St. Jude's Children's Re- search Hospital. The charity was chosen by the brotherhood from among a list of more than ten possibilities. As in years past, Phi Delta Theta went to various clubs and organizations and asked them to participate in this year's event. Each team contributed a 50 dol- lar donation for a two hour time slot to play against the brotherhood. This marathon was organized by Junior Josh Cahn who is not only the Vice President of Phi Delta Theta but the Community Service chair as well. When asked about the event Cabn responded,\We were look- ing forward to playing a lot of games. However, due to the rain and lighting our fun was cut a little short.\ Even with the rain, the event was able to raise a significant amount of money for St. Jude's Children's Hospital. Some of the organizations who participated in the marathon in- clude Alpha Epsilon Pi, Wells Elizabeth Daigle/CP Phi Delta Theta sponsors twenty-four hour softball game. House, Delta Delta Delta, Phi Sigma Kappa and The Symposium, as well as Security and Mainte- nance. All of the games proceeded without a hitch, except the rain that cancelled many games. One of the most interesting events during the night was when Senior Eugene Schultz acciden- tally ran tluough a sister of the Delta Delta Delta sorority, Amy Fairbanks, while he was running to first base. Although no one was hurt a delay occurred in the game to ensure that each player could continue. Steve Nemeth, a member of tbe AEPi Fraternity, said, \Even thougll we got caught in a downpour, we still had a great time helping Plli Delta Theta raise money for a well- derserving charity.\ The event could best be summed up by Freshman Matt Lallier, who said \Much softball, needed sleep, but I also had lots of fun and I illl'l glad I participated.\ During the Symposium discus- sion they indicated their disap- pointment in the reluctance of many house members to respond to the fact that sexual assault does exist at Union and were respon- sive only when required to speak in a friends' defense or to justify a specific incidence. They said that many students were unreceptive to the effort that Safe Space bas been making to change the atmosphere which is clearly not congenial to discuss- ing rape and sexual assault. A common problem is that many students, especially male, do not In an effort to protect women, New York State law states that women are unable to give legal verbal consent to sex when under the influence of alcohol. Students should be aware of this law and recognize the power of alcohol to alter a persons' inhi- bitions. We. should in this way be more wary of our actions when drinking and can avoid harmful situations in the future. ···.·······:Write--forr.-N,ew:s:·r·t· _-,, _::::· ·- ··::··-~-::·.:·: .. ·-.- .. -.~-~-:;;_ ···---;~>.> ->.:'.-:.~·:_.:--:·-:-::1··;-.- .;\. -~- -. ~-.,-- ~ . . e:um;:~·:··~9~~~JlileJ\~Jie~q•a.·':_ _-,. .·. i~l'('z~(}l.lrJk®uJU,olb~dtt

Greene Explains His Elegant Universe at N ott by Kristina Dorne StaffWriter \Greene Explains his Elegant Universe\ took place at 7:30PM last Wednesday night when physi~ cist Brian Greene addressed a large audience at theN ott Memorial on his theories of the Universe. The audience were there to hear Greene speakabouthisbook The Elegant Universe. Greene is a Rhodes Scholar who went to Harvard and Oxford. He graduated from Harvard in 1984 and obtained his Ph.D. from Ox- fordin 1986. Greene spent an hour explaining complicated physics to an audi- ence of fascinated spectators. Greene was the last speaker of the series entitled Perspectives of tile Nott. Much of Greene's work has been published in The New York Times. He h~s earned a great deal of cri ti- cal acclaim from the international ~ommunity. His work is read in more th~n twenty countries. Greene's bodk ponders questions and problems that have always plagued phy~i­ cists. He began his lecture by speak- ing about a person's need to ques- tion: 'The need to is so universal an e~perience that it is really cen- tral to what it means to be human and Jlhysics arid life are not limited to one kind of question.'' Greene's book looks at so ma:ny different questions, but there are a few central ones. One was, .. What is space?\ The other was, \What is time and where does it c.orne from?\ The most progress has IJeen made in the last one hundred years. Greene spoke about AllJert Einstein as being the one sci~ntist whose work came close tosolving the Unified TheoryofPhysics.. He said about Einstein: \Einstein's work is the most pivotal to devel- opment we've seen.'' In fact, Einstein spent the last thirty years of his life in relemtless pursuitofthis.theory. The Un.ified Theory of Physics or the string theory which was the only thing that really eluded Einstein during his life. This theoty helps man to gain a better understanding ()f the universe. . During the late 1600's the first quantitative attempt was ma([e to understand gravity. Gravity was seen as a very mysterious alld in~ explicable thing. Newton disc()v~ ered his universal law of gravity, which became a new way to think- ing about the universe. Greene explained Newton 'scon- clusions in his Qwn way whea be said, \the universe is like ~ big splendid timepiece. It's moving can be predicted with real preci- sion.'' This was a theory that was later proved to be incorre.ct by Einstein. Another theory that Greene spoke of in his lecture is The Theory ofQuantum Mechanics. This theory has been a central di- lemma during the past fifty years. What it comes down to is the general reality principle versus quantum mechanics. Greene used a projector to show that quantum items get bigger as spaces get smaller. Einstein thought that im- ages got smaller as you looked at them. Greene was very skilled in show~ ing the difference between the two theories on the projector. Greene spent a lot of time talking about the string theory. The string theory . asks the question: \What is the stuff in the universe and what is it · made of?\ Inside the protons and neutrons in the universe there are . ~smaller particles. Another point that Greene · spoke of was that ofunity. He said that it was important to remember . the string as forming. The ques- tion is about whether or not it re- solves the conflict and this ques- tion has dogged many physicists. The answer to that is t.hat it does. He told the audience that they needed to read his book in order to under~tand pllysics and that it pro- vides details for everything that he spoke about in the lecture. Greene's words were intriguing and clear, \Quantum and general reality coexist because they both need each other for the string theory to make sense.'' Garver Receives Grant by Kristen Zadourian News Editor Professor Jo!m Garver of the Ge- ology Department, who has been with us for eleven years, has just received a $15,000 grant from the National Science Foundation Of- fice of Polar Programs in order to ·. continue his work in the tectonic evolution of the Kamchatka Pen- insula in the Russian Far East. Along with the work in Kamchatka, Garver currently has projects in the European Alps (mainly France and Italy), as well as the Southern Alps (New Zealand). Furthermore, he has ·. projects in the Western U.S./ Canada Coast Ranges. Garver said, \I am interested in determining the time when driving forces caused the initial input for mountain devel()pment. Addition- ally, I examine how mountainous topography is maintained by ero- sion and how mountains maintain high relief and do not get eroded away by the erosion.\ The project, under the leader- ship of Garver, is also in collabora- tion with Geologist Mark T. Bran- don from Yale University. This project is entitled ''Collaborative Research: Cenozoic Evolution of the Aleutian-Kamchatka Junc- tion.\ Research has been going on in Kamchatka by Garver and Brandon since 1993. Now with the grant they will continue their re- search. The first trip to Kamchatkawhich occurred in 1993 just after the breakup of the Soviet Union, aimed to determine if field research in such a remote and closed areasuch as Kamchatka was possible. Previous to this trip, their re- search determined the timing of a terrain collision where a far-trav- eled chunk of continental crust started at about the equator and subsequently rode oceanic plates thousands of kilometers North to the collision zone in Kamchatka. This discovery opened up theo- ries that the collision changed the plate tectonic configuration in the Pacific ocean, which formed the Aleutian Islands. The new project, which will be launched this summer, builds on these findings. An investigation will be held to determine the ~pe­ cific events that led to the modern Kamchatka~A leutian junction zone. This research has been in C@ l- laboration with Geologists at the Institute of the Lithosphere in Moscow. Russian Geologists Alexie Soloviev and Galina Ledneva work in Kamchatl<a and both have spenttime here at U11i,on. Garver comments on Kamchatka, saying, \Kamchatka is an interest- ing place mountain-wise because the peninsula seems to have been caused by a collision of tectonic plates about forty five billi0n years ago, which was determined b::y our previous grant. \It looks like that coHision caused plates to reorganize result- ing in the modern configurati<m.of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska :and Russia.\ Garver also adds, ''This grant is aimed at determining the timing of the plate reconfigurati()n. When did the Aleutians form· and why? Ironically, to answer this ques- tion, you really cannot go t() the Aleutians because most al'e under- water. Nearby Kamchatka hdldsthe key. The Union-Yale research team has planned a five-week fieldpro- gram at Karaginski Island, a remote and uninhabited island offtlleEast Coast of Kamchatka. Along with Garver from Union will beGe()togy major Jason Lederer. Also on the trip will be Ale-xie Soloviev and Galina Ledneva, b()th Russian geologists from the Insti- tute ofthe Lithosphere in Moscow. Also, there will be a Russian Ge- ologist from the Institute ofVoka- nology and Petrology ( Petropavol vsk-Karnch ats k i, Kamchataka.) The goal tllis slim- mer will be to collect rocks in order to gather the first clues ab()ut the post collision events which have led up to the modern-day setting of the Aleutian-Kamchatka Junc- tion.

Campus News A Proposal for Residential and Social Life at Union Introduction The U2K Steering Committee was appointed in the Fa11 of 1998 and :1sked to anticipate how the College can best accommodate the ,transition to sophomore rush and, '\to propose a set of reforms that would preserve the traditions of Greek Life that are consistent with an academic community that val- ues open inquiry, seriousness of purpose, diversity of opinion, and a broad and equitable choice of residential and social options.\ Five subcommittees worked over three terms and in February 2000, the U2K Steering Committee re- leased its preliminary report to the campus that summarized the work of the subcommittees. In that re- port the Steering Committee high- lighted three key principles that would guide us in the final stages of our work. 1. The Greek system needs to dissociate itself trom groups that engage in regressive activities such as hazing and alcohol abuse. 2. The Coli ege must rectify a sys- 1em of unequal privilege in hous- ing and access to social space and do whatever is necessary to make room for the growth of social ini- tiatives. 3. Faculty need to participate more in the out-of-class intellectual life of the campus and the adminis- tration needs to support initiatives that help faculty meet this goal. We identified several controver- sial issues and invited the campus community to share thoughts and opinions. W c heard rrom the Stu- dent Forum, the Chair of the Fac- ulty Executive Committee, the In- tcrfraterni ty Co unci I, the Panhellentc Council, individual students, faculty, staff, a\ urnni and alumnae (see Appendix A). In the following proposal we ad- dress three primary topics: the fu- ture of Greek life at Union and the transition to sophomore rush, the establishment of an all-inclusive House System to begin in the Fall of 2004, and an array ofnew social tmtJattvcs. We recognize tl1at our proposal will draw criticism from those who feel we have gone too far and those who feel we have not gone far enough. We believe our proposal represents a careful bal- ancmg that preserves the I 7 5-year tradit10n of Greek letter societies while Simultaneously offcnng a new model for residential and so- cmll!tc. We present this proposal for re- view by the campus community. We recognize that it is late in the term and that people will want time to consider what we propose. We however feel that it is important to get our ideas out to the commu- nity before three members of our committee graduate and another goes on a well-earned leave. We do not offer these ideas slightly we have devoted the better part of two years to this discussion but we rec- ognize the importance of giving the campus an opportunity to contrib- ute to the discussion. Toward that end, we are recommending Presi- dent Hull not take any formal ac- tion on this proposal until October 2000. At that time we will provide him with copies of all the corre- spondence we receive as well as a summary of the reactions and an analysis of alternative proposals. Please address correspondence to: U2K 306 Reamer Campus Centet Union College Schenectady, NY 12308 or <u2k@union .edu> Proposal for the Future of Greek Life l'vtany faculty and administrators will view our recommendations on the Greek system with some dis- may, perhaps having hoped that all residential groups would be re- quired to go co-educational or that the Greek system would be moved off campus or <Jbolished. However, two years· of deliberation has left the U2K Steering Committee con- vinced that tin l<ering with the GFeek system beyo11d sophomore rush was not the best way to achieve an ideal residential and social pro- gram for Unio11. Our attempt to deal with the fundamental problems as- sociated with Greek life at Union - - the inequity in housing that it per- petuates, the dominance of social -l-ife at Union that it represents, the negative effect on recruiting some faculty and siudents that a domi- nant Greek image imposes - -sug- gested changes that would seri- ously weake11 the Greek system without provi<iing positive alterna- tives. Thus, what we are now propos- ing is the preservation of our tradi- tional Greek system within a new social construct at Union. The H()use System that is described at some length below will simulta- nemtsly move Greek life more to- ward the periphery Oiterally and figt1ratively) wnile making available to every Union student some of the most valued parts of Greek life. Most notable among these are: access to attractive residential and social space, a sense of belonging to a unit to wliich one will return as an alumna or alumnus, the oppor- tunity to work with others in oreat- ing social programs, and the re- sponsibility Qf taking part in the self-governance of a residence unit. Greek Meml>ership and Housing In our preliminary report, we placed on the table several ques- tions that we knew were of utmost importance to every Greek at Union: 1. Should Greek organizations continue to be selective? 2. Should Greek organizatiems continue to be single-sex? 3. Should Greek organizations C()ntinue to be residential? 4. Should Greek organizations cc.ntinue to nave pledging? Many Greeks - including those on the U2K Steering Committee -· feh that the !CJss of any one ofthese four would re~>ult in a failure to pre- serve a Greek tradition at Union. They argued that none of these is- sues were inherently inconsistent with \an academic community that valu~s· open inquiry, seriousness of purpose~ diversity of opinion, and a broad and equitable choice of residential and social options.\ It is the reconunendation ofthe U2K Steering Conunittee that all four of the characteristics cited above, which currently define most of our Greek organizations, remain as op- tions, as recommended by the Greek leadership and the Student Forum. The transition to sophomore rush will have implications for housing. Some groups will have difficulty maintaining current occupancy re- quirements. We recommend that Greek houses be granted twenty percent leeway as long as every eli- gible member of the grouP' is in resi- dence. Thi!3 policy should stay in place until the implementation of the new House System, at which time there will be more residences avail- able for smaller groups. There are currently twenty-two residential spaces for Greeks and The:me Houses and we propose to reserve at least that nllmber for these purposes in the future (see Appendix B). We expect that all current resident organizations would continue to have housing subject to the SAC housing review guidelines. Rush, Pled~ing, and Hazing In our preliminary report we rec- ommended that rush and pledging be condensed into one term and even more closely monitored by the Interfraternity and Panhellenic Councils to make sure that the pro- grams are not offensive and that they do not interfere with the aca• demic process. yv:e also encourage the two governing bodies to work to develop a common set of guide- ! ines for the rush process that en- sure that no rush activity takes place before the sophomore year. The one recommendation that we wal)t to state unequivocally is the need for a zero-tolerance policy for acts of hazing that are dangerous, coercive or which interfere with teaching and learning. We believe that theme or Greek groups that en,gage in these activities should be banned from the campus, and that athletes or club members who are fottnd guilty shou_ld be banned from their sport or activity. Proposal for a House System We recommend that the College introduce a new House System to which every Union student will be- long. We propose using the build- ings on campus that will best ac- commodate the new system, includ- ing some current fraternities, theme houses, one administrative build- ing, one academic building, and one administrative residence (see Ap- pendix. C). The House System will be com- prised of twelve houses and every Union student will be assigned ran- domly to membership in one of them prior .to arriving as a freshman. We believe membership in a House should be a source of connection to the College, as well as a source of friendship, learning, motivation to get involved in extracurricular life, and, perhaps above all, an enJoy- able and vibrant social life. Each house wil1 have faculty affiliates, a budget, aTid governance structure. The average house membership will be 1 65, but could range from 120 to 240 depending on the buildirtg they occupy (see Appendix. C). Each house will have sorne resident members, but all members will be eligible to participate in house governance and activities and Will be able to use co.mmiOn space, game tables, and kitchen facilities. All houses will be e:xpected to contribute intellectt,nll ,. cu.Ltural, and social events to tlte campus, participate in orienting new stu- dents, sponsor community ser- vice projects, and field~ teams for intramural co1npetitio11.. Houses wiH host parties and might have weekly meals together, host art .. cists-in-residence, plan fo,rmal dances,. ot publish a 11ewspaper or journal. Key Co11ege events should be · coordinated• with the House System. Preceptorial groups and advisors should he aligned with house assignments so that Preceptorial classes can meet in the house an-d students might even run into tlteir advisor at a house dinner. H()uses. could host receptions or dinners before lectures or convocati011 and then attend as a group. :Post-com- mencement receptions might take place at houses rather than, or in addition to, an academic division. Eventually, the hollse~ will be a gathering place for alumni as they return \for College events. Member~>bifl The process of assigning mem- bers randomly will create diver- sity of membership. Although every student at Unio:n will be a member of one house, he or she may simultaneously be a member of a Greek organization, theme house, or both. All fa.culty mem- bers will have a house affiliation. In addition, College staff and alumni will be invite<l to affiliate with a house. Leadership and Go-vernance Each house will have a fa~ulty advisor, a cohort of f~culty affili- ates, and an elected president who will serve on a Kouse Coun- cil that will coordinate the activi·· ties of the system !LS a whole. Each house will be fr.::e to define its own form of governance be- yond the faculty advisor and president, but will lutve to oper- ate within the larger policies of the College. lt is Ollr hope that faculty and students will work col- lectively on all faceits of house governance and that there will be ample opportunity for students to take on leadership ro 1es. We recommend $120 of a stu- dents room and board fees be dedicated to the House System. One hundred dollars would go di- rectly to the house and $20 would go to a House Council budget for events collectively o-rganized by the House Council. These funds would support social and cultural programs as determined by the house government. In addition to direct funding, houses would get S()me funding from the orientatio~t budget for events they run. Houses wotJ.Id also be able to participate in the meal plan equivalency program to help pay for meals anc:l re~eptions. Alumni We recommend that alumni and alumnae be invited to join the House System if they choose. Those who do .could be assigned ()on a. random basis or cot~ld have tbe option to join a .specific house. This would allow a,l~;~rnni 9fChi Psi, ~si Upsilon, Phi Delta Theta, and Sigma Phi to remain connected to their campus homes. As the House System takes Foot, it will become am important part of reunions and homecomings, and we think all alumni and alumnae should ha,ve the .chance to be affiliated with one cf ~he houses. Practical Considerations The transition to the House Sys- tem will require .some significant costs associated with renovation and furnishing and will call for a well-crafted implementation strat- egy. Perhaps the most significant change will be the allocation of housing. We are recommending that Alpha Delta Phi,. Chi Psi, Phi Delta Theta, Psi Upsilon, Thurston, Sigma Phi, Smith, and Wells move from their current locations. In ad- dition we recommend moving aca- demic programs out of Lamont, administrative offices from Sil1irrtan, and the Dean of Students family from 1248 Lenox Road. To create a fair process for dis- tributing housing at the time of the transition, we recommend that no (]reek or Th~me group retain its claim to any particular space. A committee including the Director of Residence Life. two faculty ap- pointed by the Faculty Executive Committee and four students :should develop a. plan for distrib- lltiilg. housing to these groups. The students should be appointed by the Student Forum and should in- c! ude two students nominated by the Theme House Consortium, one nominee from the Interfraternity Council, and one from the Panltelie11ic Council. This commit- tee might develQp a ranking sys- tem based on criteria used in the SAC housing review process, they might employ a lottery system, or they may devise entirely new crite- ria. Whether the process is one of merit or chance, we encourage them to include some element of choice, to enable some groups to remain in the current place if no one else wants it. To allow us to address pr6perly all the abo.:ve considerations, we recommend that the House System go into place no later th.an the fall term 2004, to allow for necessary fundraising, planning, and renova- tion to take place. Proposed Social Initiatives Alcohol Policy We believe that the only way to achieve equality\in hosting parties at which alcohol is served is to have a common alcohol policy and ample access to good spaces in which to hold events. We want Union to be a place where people have fun, as long as they act re- sponsibly. We recommend that a committee consisting of an Associate Dean of Students, the College attorney,

We also recommend a casual, at- tractive 'drop-in space open during the day for faculty ~rtd students to meet, read, an·<l relax. At night there might be smaJl bands, poetry read- ings, performance artists, contests, etc. We hope this would become a place for a c~nversation or study break during the week, or to gather before or after a movie or a party on weekends.

Fundi nil and Pro&ramminK We believe the current system of creating and: funding all-cam,. pus social activities on campus needs to be impl'.oved. We see tlie need to create a more centralized planning process that would in- clude 'committees. such as the Film, Social, and Concert Committees, Speakers Forum, with Program As- sistants, Student Forum represen- tatives, Student Activities staff, and, eventuall:y, House Council repnesentatives. In order to en- sure a diverse social ar~d cultural life at the College, it is important that each weeken<l have a variety of events, some of which are large and some small, some with alco- hol and some dry, some intellec: tual/cultural and some just for fun. At least some of these events should happen at the same time and place every weekend and continue from year to year. We recommend that Student Forum appoint a committee that includes five students and tbe Director of Student Activities to create a more centralized, efficient, and effective mechanism for the planning and funding of camplls social life paid for by Student Forum money. Conclusion From the first suggestion that Union_postpo.ne.rush until the sophomore ye~ to this present set of recommendations, the various committees who have contributed to these deliberations have been asked, \Whats the problem?\ We have identified f&ur that we think etything in its power to preserve the existing Greek system, and fos- ter the creation of as many new . and different housing and social options as possible.\ (Class of 1977) \While college was, collectively, the best four years of my life, it was made so prim~ly by my fra- ternity experience Was I hazed? Of course. But I had fun, made great mends, and lived to tell.

The costs were not simply associated with buying beer (we bought less. back then!). It was the set-up, clean up and wear and tear in which no one outside of the mem- bers of the organization hosting AppendixB the House System will resolve. Problem: Unions reputatiQn as a Greek dominated campus discour· ages some students from applying and some faculty from accepting job offers often those who are look- ing for campuses that m.:: nHJre in- tellectually and politically acti-ve. One need only read the descrip- tion .of Union in the Princet<Jn Re- view to see how our repllta:ti<>n is influenced by the Greek system. In many ways this is an unfair reflec- tion en the system because i1 Jllays on stereotypes that are conveyed through television, movies, and print media. Nonetheless, as bright, capable high school jtmiors and seniors sort througn unfathomab1e amounts of .data describing colleges and uni- versities, they make qukk judge- ments. When they read in the Princeton Review \Frats sort>rities and lots of beer drinking d()minate the social scene,'' many Serious minded students will look else- where. The same is true for ,pro- spective faculty who c<mclude Union students may be less <:om- mitted to their academic W()rk_ Solution: The House System will ma!ce the most prominent part .of our residential and social life mere in- . elusive and intellectual. *** Pro11Jem: The cuqent allocation of prime real ~state is. ~nfair.

There is one sorority that has 1,840 square feet of common space; but there are twice as many members using that space as in any of the Class A residences. The situation for independents is even worse. The largest amount of common space available to in- dependents is 2,800 square feet for 230 residents. In addition to the variance in common space, there a.re architectural differences that include amenities such as larger bedrooms, kitchens, wood floors, and paneling. Solution: The House System will give every student access to social space and funding to host programs. *** Problem: We need to involve faculty more in the out-of-class- room lives of students and invigo- rate the intellectual life of the cam- pus. Througho.ut the process we heard from students that the fac- ulty don't fully understand stu- dent social life and, because they don't attend events, aren't aware of all th.e good things students do. Faculty often criticize stu- dents, and sometimes coll~agues, for not attending campus cultural events. The recent Middle States Report draws .similar conclusion;> about the need for revitalizing the intellectuaf life outside the class- room and increasing informal stu- dent/faculty interaction. Solution: The House System will include faculty in governance a third-party vendor, whose li- cense would be on the line, would greatly level the playing field.\ (Class of 2000) \Bars provide a safer environ- ment in which to serve alcohol. Bars serve as a physical barrier between those who serve alco- hol and those who desire alco- hol.\ (Student Forum) On housing equity: \A co-ed Greek system would naturally correct the housing in- equity among men and women, foster a much healthier and inclu- sive social .structure at the Col- lege.;' (C1ass of 2000) \The College should convert current large houses such as Feigenbaum Hall, Lamont House and Silliman Hall into theme houses or sororit1es.\ (Student AppendixC and social programming, and will be coordinated with Preceptorial and advising assignments. *** Problem: Union, like most of higher education and society at large, is often too balkanized men separate from women, one .race from another, international from domes- tic, athletic team members from non- members, etc. While we recognize that human nature leads us to associate with others like us, we think that the College should make more efforts to engage people across lines that seem to divide us all too often. We think this happens best when people need to work together to- ward common goals. Athletic teams are good examples of contexts in which these artificial boundaries arc less likely to exist. Solution: The House System will assign students randomly to mem- bership and provide opportunities for participation in a wide range of events funded by a House budget over which all members will have some influence. *** It is important to remember that Union operates within a much larger environment than the College Grounds. Three years ago a young man died in a fraterni-ty at M.LT and the world sat up and took notice. Incidents such as these tend to shape society's view of Greek life. We believe that Unions Greek sys~ tem can be a positive element of our educational programs, and we want to be able to defend it as such. We think that the plan before you will make that possil>le.

Since we've arrived here, there have been a nurp.ber of physical and social changes that have impacted our ev~ryday life. Many of us have fond memories of our time. here at Union inside and outside of class. We are now approaching a very important tirne in the school's history with U2K and semester/trimester debates. Five years from now, our school could be completely differ- ent, socially as well as academically. With these two major issues along with many oth- ers facing the student forum, wouldn't you like someone representing your class who will make conscientious decisions regarding :subjects of such importance? I'm willing to put the time and effort into listening and de- termining what's best for our class and Union. Our senior year is quickly approaching. Personally, I'dlove to look back a few years from now and say that my senior year was the best time I had in college. I believe everything's whatyoumakeofit. But it helps when someane already has something planned for you, so you don't always have to make the decisions.

This past year I was on Student Forum as the Freshmen Class Vice President and I feel I learned a lot about myself and the politics of Union College. This experience taught me the importance and power of my position. l feel I worked extremely hard to fhndraise and set up fun events for our class.

Listening With one year of leadership at Union Col- to who I am representing is what I feel will lege under my belt I know what it takes to make our class more active. Having a class make important changes at thi~ ::::chool I will that is active in the school and community a be to and I will allow to have more fun. !2~~ua'!!.!t~~ry am runnit~g for representative of the sopho- more class. Some of you may know me as ••Grandpa,\ the kind old man. I feel I need to address this, because it seems more people know me as an \old man\ than by my real name. Call me what you will, or call me the twain if yau want the best of both worlds. My home is Wrentham, Massachusetts. I am a graduate ofXaverian Brothers High School in Westwood, Massachusetts. I came to Union College with the hope that I could have a positive influence on the student body. This is a fine opportunity for me to make a unique difference on this campus. The qualities I possess have been a life- long, growing process. Highschool is where I was able to strengthen my integrity and learn what qualities are necessary to live a life based on good morals. I have a unique insight to the world and the ability to make decisions that please everyone and let no one down. I will listen to the requests of the students and utilize my own goodwill to make decisions for the class. What I bring to the class will undoubtedly produce creative re- sults that wiU only benefit us as a whole. I want what is best for the class as much as anyone else. OK, enough babble about my character that is probablyundistinguishable from any other candidate. We all believe we are good people, that is why we are running. The nick- name was instated early last fall. There are two possibilities for the initiation of this nam.e: 1) I possess a unique wisdom of someone who has lived a long, prosperous life; some- one who· has seen the world and made his deductions about what is right, or 2) I am a wackjob kid who acts senile and cailllot con- vey a thought without demonstrating sure signs of Alzheimer's disease. The latter is impossible. I am only nineteen years old! The only way I can justify this is to assume that 1 am wise for my age. How about some cool changes in the school'? We can change Dutch Hollow to the Max and drink strawberry milk shakes and play pinball just like they did at Bayside back in the early 90's. No, you don't think I'm seri~ms, do you? I don't want to bring us bacl< in our evolutionary progress, be~ cause this is a new millenium. This is Y2K, or G2K if you will. That' sright, Grandpa Two ThousatJd. I will bring us into a new age with style. I have only one thing left to say .. To those of you who j.oke around with me and say that I am not playing witl:la full deck or that I am not the brightest bulb in the chandelier, I will say only this: I willalways throw down the ace, and I will always shine bright. Vote for Grandpa on Election Day. Steven Weintraub My name is Steven Weintraub·and I am running to represent the sophomore class . ~ext year. I feel that any class officer should possess a few qualities in order to truly be effective. A class officer should be active in school~ctivities, have leadership experi- ence, be a people person, care about the school, and most importantly care about what the student body wants and fight for it I feel confident that I fit all of the afore- mentioned characteristics. This past year since I have come to Union, I have become active in many clubs and taken on leader- ship roles. I.am currently the secretary of Union College Emergency Medical Ser- vices, a floor delegate, and the Presidentof the Kosher Kitchen. In addition to these two leadership roles I am a Gate Keeper, in the International Relations Club, the Israeli Culture Club, I tutor kids weekly, take Ka- rate, participate in intramural sports, and I am in a fraternity. As can be seen from my activities I am knowledgeable in many parts of student life making me very aware of what the school · I also feel that in addition to ex:perience, a class officer should have ideas for the future of the class and to promote unity. So far, I have come up with a few ideas and have re- ceived a few suggestions from friends in re- gards to some fun class activities. However, I am always open for more suggestions, and everyone should feel free to email me at weintras@union.edu. Currently, I would like to see the sophomore class have a dance at the end ofthe year in recognition {)four half- way point here at Union. Another idea that I have is to have a beach day at west beach. This would consist of a day filled with games such as volleyball, ultimate Frisbee, capture the. flag, as well as water fights and possibly a giant slip and slide. Pretty much just a fun day for all of the sophomores to come on out and enjoy themselves. Class unity is iinpor- tant, and the best way to do it, is by having fun activities that everyone will enjoy. If elected to represent the sophomore class, I promise to do so to the best of my ability. I will listen to what the srudent hody wants, and act on it. So I hope that everyone comes out and Votes for who they feel the best can- didates are, I hope you come out and vote forme, STEVEN WEIN1RAUB.

Male Greek organizations existed at Union long before women were admitted or Theme Houses came into being and,. as such, they have a long history and are ftrmly entrenched in the most ideal housing. How can Union, a school in which the majority' of students are not Greeks, and certainly not male Greeks, continue along this path ofineq- uity? The answer is that it cannot withoutsacrificing the quality of both faculty and students. Given this, we must decide how best to proceed. We now have the opportunity to let our voices be heard on the issue. We should bear in mind that if the current system is not changed, given the national shift away from these organizations, the scho()l will move to eliminate the system as a whole. The U2K Report is the result of the hard work of students, faculty members and administrators collaborating for two years. We owe it to them to at least consider thei.r proposal before once again blindly defending the Greek System as it stands. lt is easy to understand the concerns of Greek organizations with respect to the proposed Hou.se System, however the threat is only per- ceived. The intention of the new system is not to replace Fraternities and Sororities with twelve new independent houses, but rather to take the emphasis off of the Greek system with respect to social and residen- tial life. Under the new system, every student wiii have the opportunity to be a part of one of the nicer houses on campus. Fraternities currently occupy some of these houses: Phi Delta Theta, Sigma Phi, Psi Upsilon and Chi Psi. Though these organizations will lose their claim to the houses they currently reside in, and in which they may have lived for many years, there is no fairer way of redistributing the most favorable housing on campus. This process is entirely necessary. How can we claim to be a modern academic institution, welcoming students of all races and regardless of gender, when tour guides, upon being asked who lives in these huge \mansions must reply \Fraternities wbich, in essence means white men. Thankfully, tours are not given of the interiors of these buildings so that prospective students may truly see the difference between the rooms in Psi Upsilon and Potter House. If the Housing System is implemented, we can then proudly proclaim that any student, regardless of race or gen.der, will have such a house as their \living room\ on campus, and have the opportunity to participate in events at that house on a regular basis, in addition to having a fair chance to live in one. We should not mistake this for a decision motivated purely by a nega- tive appearance; in fact, it is nece~sary for our very survival. We cannot continue to allow our school to be perceived as a beer-guzzling, Greek- dominated campus. It can be argued that these are no more than stereo- types or that we are no more guilty of these transgressions than other institutions of equal or greater academic standing. It is only important, however, that we make every effort to combat this view. We should do everything necessary to improve our reputation so that we may both receive the best education possible at1d have the greatest pride in our college. When considering this proposal, it is important for the student body to recognize that it does not include a fundamental change in the Greek system. Sophomore Rush was not implemented by\ this committee. By embracing this proposal, the Fraternities and Sororities may in fact thrive under the new system, which, if not supported, will at least not endure the constant pressure from the faculty. It is, in fact, up to the students. You now have the proposal in your hands. If you choose to play an active role, you have the opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to the decision-making process.

To begin this article, lVIouldlik.e to say that I am a member of a Greek . organization. I respecttbe women in my house and the traditions 11,p- held over the years by these women. I am proud to be Greek and I have no shame in openly associating myself with my hC!use and my Greek counterparts, male and female. One would feel that after rea<ling the U2K preliminary rep<lrt put out on May 15, I would be incense<! at the suggestions made for the future of the Greek system at Union Col- lege by only a small groupofpe01ple. It doesn't seem fair thatthese people want to take away the h()tlsing from a number of Greek organizations on this campus and redistribute the rooms to a more diverse of students. I must adinit that when I read tlJ.e first preliminaryrep()rt put out . in February, I did not agree 'vith a namber of the changes dis- cussed. It seemed as if the ad- ministration wanted to abolish the Greek system because they felt it gave the school a negative con- notation to prospective students. Now that lknow the issues more thoroughly and understand the logic behind a number of the de- cisions made, I can see why some of the changes should be imple- mented. I'm not saying that I agree with everything that is being said, but I want to contradict the feeling that has infiltrated this school that all Greeks will be OPT)OS€~a these changes. Tradition is impor- tant, any member of a Greek orga- nization can atte!!t to this. How- ever, Union College cannot be stuck in the past, we mast move toward the future, where equal op- portunity has long since replaced the notion tha1 we live ill a male- dominated society. It is no secret that the prime hous- ing on this campus is primarily oc- cupied by male Greeks, and it has been occupied by these organiza- tions for a number ofyears now. However, high quality living at Union College should be a right of everyone at this school, not the privilege bestowed upon a few small select groups of students. In other words, inferior housing should not be a punishment at this school for being independent or fe- male or freshman. Living options at this school are severely limited by the requirements needed to es- tablish residence ·in a Class \A\ Housing. Although it is difficult to let go of the tra,dition held by the house of a Greek Organization, it is not impossible. Ifa Greek Organiza- tion is strong enough, then it can exist in the house it has resided in for years or a few blocks in Davidson Hall 1t should not mat- ter where you are living, but who you are living witlt. -Submitted by a Sophom<Jre Greek Woman FrOWII s~ 5paa!/ ''We are not the creators of tension.

We owe It to them to at least co nsidcr their proposal before once again hlmdly defending the ()reek System as. it stands. It IS easy to understand the concerns of Greek organ.izations with re::,pect to the proposed I !oust.: System, however the threat is only per- ct:Ived. The intention of the new system is not to replace Fraternities and Sororities with twelve new independent houses, but rather to take the emphasis ofT of the Greek system With respect to social and residen- tiallife. lJnder the new system, every-student will have the opportunity to be a part of one of the nicer hollses on campus. Fraternities currently occupy some of these houses: Elhi Delta Theta, Sigma Phi, Psi Upsilon and Ch1 Ps1. Though these organizations will lose their claim to the houses they currently reside ill, and in which they may have lived for many years, there is no fairer 'l\''a:y of redistributing the most favorable housmg on campus. This process is entirely necessary. How can we claim to be a modern academic institution, welcoming students of all races and regardless of gender, when tour guides, upon being asked who lives in these huge \manswns must reply \Frate mities, •· which, in essence means white men. Thankfully, tours are n()t given of the interiors of these buildings so that prospective students may tmly see the difference between the rooms in Ps1 Upsilon and Potte-r House. If the Housing System is imP'lemented, we can then proudly proclaim that any student, regardless of cace or gender, will have such a house as their '\hvmg room\ on campus, and have the opportunity to participate in events at that house on aTe-gular basis, in addition to having a fair chance to live in one. We should not mistake this for a dec1sion motivated purely by a nega- tive appearance; in fact, it is neccessary for our very survival. We cannot contmue to allow our school tOo be perceived as a beer-guzzling, Greek- dominated campus. It can he- argued tllat these are no more than stereo- types nr that we are no more guilty ()f these transgressions than other mst1tutions of equal or greater academic standing. It is only important, however. that we make every cHort tl> combat this view. We should do everythmg necessary to Improve our reputation so that we may both recciYe the best education p<OSsJble and have the greatest pride in our col lege. When cm1s1denng till:> prop osa1.

One would feel that after reading the U2K preliminary report put out on May 15, I would be incensed at the suggestions made for the future of the Greek system at Union Col- lege by only a small group of people. It doesn • t seem fair that these people want to take a way the housing from a number of Greek organizations on this campus and redistribute the Greek system because they felt it gave the school a negative con- nutation to prospective students. N\ ow that I know the issues more thC>roughly and understand the lo~ic behind a number of the de- cisions made, I can see why some of the changes should be imple- mented.

We do not have to call long distance to speak with friends, yet we .still send E-mail rather than calL Businesses also rely on the In_ternet as a primary source of communication. This detracts from the personal aspect of the work place and it also creates a detached atmosphere in which to conduct business. Through my college years, I have learned that personal con- tact with both professors and peers is essential to the educa- tion process. Conversations with these people have enlightened my years here, which I assume is true for many of you. Without con- versing with my professors, my education would have lacked an essential aspect of the learning process, which is explaining my ideas and defending my positions on issues. Furthermore, because of deep and complex conversations I have developed strong friendships that will last the rest of my Hfe. The countless hours spent dis- cussing relationships, courses, fu-· ture plallS and life's problems would nothavebeen as meaningful if they were conducted over E-mail. I would not :have known nearly as much about my friends ifi had only communicated with them through a computer screen. The Internet provides unmatchable amounts of informatioll. It has facilitated glo- bal and national communication, This superhighway of information should not, however, become our primary source of interaction with friends and co-workers. We should limit the ex. tension of the Internet so that we can still socialize with others.

Opinio~s & l3£h1orials--------------- Technology Can Not Replace Personal Contact by Brooke M. Barylick Editor-in-Chief Emerita The Internet is a valu.able re- source for modern communications. Many have grown dependent upon it in their daily lives. Its ease of use, ever increasing speed, the range of information available and the im- proving accessibility ens~ue that the Internet will continue to play an integral role in our lives. Because of the developn1ent and expansiotl of the Internet teclmol- ogy. communications between people all over the world can be conducted with the click of a but- ton. Through innovative technolo- gies, we are afforded quick and easy access to global communications. The almost instantaneous connec- tion between computers facilitates a rapid transfer of ideas, which leads to a more efficient method of both personal and professional communication. This system of communication is ideal for minor issues, such as spe- cific details about a meeting time and location. E-mail is also an effi- cient method of informing recipients about upcoming events, factual in- formation and simple items that do not require much detailed explana- tion. The Internet also facilitates in- formation gathering. The World Wide W ebplaces an infinite amount of information at the fingertips of the user. Many are able to obtain complex data and facts quickly and efficiently because of its rapid pace and ease. In addition. one can lo- cate data on all topics. ranging from books to research and colleges to countries through search engines. With minimal effort, one will en- counter substantial amou11ts of data on the subject that he or she is researching. Because of the Internet, people can obtain current information very quickly. Before these pro- grams engulfed our society, we had to wait for the next news broadcast or the next morning's newspaper before we could up- date ourselves on current events, such as news, weather and sports. Now, we ca:n learn about breaking news almost instantaneously. For example, we can watch Con- gress debate issues by logging onto the C-Span Web site. Fur- thermore, we can tune into the Web sites of local television sta- tions to discover the regional news and we can also search for infor- mation on regions outside of our own. With all of the benefits that the Internet provides, one might think that it is flawless. Although I have only mentioned some of the ben- eficial aspects of the Internet, the problems that the Internet craze has already caused have the po- tential of developing into more se- rious issues in upcoming years. To begin, although the Internet boasts quick and easy access to infinite amounts of information, various obstacles arise for some who try to utilize this database. Many people are not afforded the luxury of using the Internet be- cause they do not have access to a computer or they are unsure of how to operate it. Because the Internet is not a universal com- modity, many feel inferior to those who enjoy its benefits. Another problem that arises from this technology deals with the increaseoflntemet communi- cations. The Internet is not iaeal for situations that require explanations of complex ideas because it does not allow for interactive communi- cation between the parties that are exchanging the information. Con- versations dea 1 ing with cr!11plicated ideas sometimes need to alter their tone or wording to express the ideas clearly and accurately. Thiscannot be done through a computer. Ideas are best expressed in person where each individual involved can more accurately gauge the reactions of those involved. Despite the speed and efficiency of the Internet, it can- not replace face to face conversa- tion. As mentioned earlier, one of the benefits of the Internet is the end- less supply of information that it offers. Unfortunately, there is no regulation of such information. Anyone can establish a Web site, which leads to questionable con- tent and ideas on the Internet. Al- though I support freedom of speech, some of these ideas and concepts extend too far and pro- vide false information. Those who deny the existence of tragic events, such as the Holocaust, or those who publish hate messages, such as anti-homosexual propaganda, do not deserve space on the Internet. This information is hurtful and with- out purpose. I disagree with those who argue that it is freedom of speech. Another issue with the Internet deals with its readily accessible nature. As mentioned earlier, the Internet provides a wide range of information and, as explained in the previous paragraph, this is n()t regu- lated.

As a sopho- more I will still say that I love Union, but will also say that I have become shockingly aware of how well the school is at painting the perfect pic- ture I fell in love with.

But these are just things we all complain about and at the same time accepted because they aren't that big of a deal. There will always be those things we just have to ac- cept in life. But this past week I was shocked and let down at the proposition the school gave my sorority, Tri-Delta. Next fall we have eleven members going on a term abroad. This means that we have that many open beds in our house. The schoo 1 allows for 10% le- niency in filling the house which means that we would have IO fill at least five of the eleven open beds. So our choices were to make next years seniors fill the spots, let the school fill them with non- members of Tri-Delt, or to pay $5000 the cost minus board fees for those beds) in order to have those beds remain open and have more singles in the falL Seeing as all of the senior had signed expen- sive leases to live off campus back in the fall, making them move back was not an option. Allowing Union to fill the ro6ms was not something we wanted to do either. So we decided that we would come together and raise the money in order to keep the rooms open. Union has admitted that this situ- ation is purely financial, and the dorms need to be full next year. We have been willing to work with the school, and are able to fill our house, but did not expect that such a large number of members would be going away next fall. No con- sideration has been given to the fact that the house will be full win- ter and spring terms. And more than that we were completely un- aware of these stipulations and complications until this past week. We were all of a sudden thrown into the possibility o floosing our house if we could not find a solution. a house we worked very hard to get back.

Five thousand dollars. We raised the money in four days. We were fortunate enough to pull it off. But we never should have had to. We were not asking for special treat- ment because we are greek, only did we think that the school would take our situation into consideration. The situation being that for fall term we would have empty spots be- cause of term abroad. We were wrong though. And I was wrong when I though I was coming to a school where the administration and the students worked together and compromised. We compro- mised sure, compromised five thou- sand dollars. And for all the listen- ing to the students that Union does, I am left questioning whether or not they choose to hear what we say. -Jesse Welsh & the members ofTri-Delta and hate groups.

OP/ED Suspicion ~~~~~~~~sro~~~,~!~~t ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~t~~ Dear Editors: I am writing to express my dis- appointment in the actions of Andy Markowski, senior trustee. Markowski, in his role as senior trustee, is charged with the task of running the elections for the Stu- dent Forum. After the elections for the Student Forum positions al- most two weeks ago, Markowski reported tpe results to Concordiensis, but failed to report the actual vote totals thateach can- didate received. I fmd this to be very troubling for two reasons~ First, Markowski's actions are troubling .because of his past his,.. tory offraudulentelections. After last fall's debacle in which he as- sisted his fraternity brother, Matt Rapoport, in running a bogus elec- tion with imaginary candidates and fabricated advertisements, Markowski should do everyth:iiig in his power to regain the student body's trust of the elections pro- cess, whose credibility, was shat- tered after that incident. Withhold- ing vote totals is a backhanded move that adds an aura of suspi- cion to the elections. More importantly, Markowski's level.

Page 12 ·May 18, 2000 · Qloncarbiensis OP/ED Suspicion Surrounds Election •The Petsona Is! De~ Editors: I am writing to express my dis- app{)intment in the actions of Andy Markowski, senior trustee. Markowski, in his role as senior trustee, is charged with the task of running the elections for the Stu- dent Forum. After the elections for the Student Forum positions al- most two weeks ago, Markowski rep()rte d the resu Its to Concordiensis, but failed to report the actual vote totals that each can- didate received. I find this to be very troubling for two reasons. First, Markowski's actions are troubling because of his past his- tory -offraudulent elections. After last fall's debacle in which he as- siste<l his fraternity brother, Matt Rapoport, in running a bogus elec- tion with imaginary candidates and fabricated advertisements, Markowski should do everything in his power to regain the student body's trust of the elections pro- cess, whose credibility was shat- tered after that incident. Withhold- ing vote totals is a backhanded move that adds an aura of suspi- cion to the elections. More importantly, Markowski's actions are troubling on a broader level. Markowski broke the prece- dent set two years ago of releasing the vote totals to the press. Two years ago, Senior Trustee Ruthie Strosberg and others used the ar- gtunent that the Forum would not release the vote totals because they feaFed this would detract potential candidates from running for fear that an embarrassingly low vote total W()uld be printed. Finally, it was de- cicied that the vote totals were to be rei eased as it was the fair and demo- cratic th:ing to do. After they were released, Concordiensis pablished a news story with these vote totals. No candidates reported embarrass- ment at seeing their vote totals in the paper. The year after the article was published, last year, there was not a significant drop in the number of candidates who ran for positions on the Forum. This year, Markowski has taken the same line, thauhe Stu- pent Forum does not wish to detract potential candidates from running next y·ear. This stance is undemo- cratic and should be changed. Ad- ditionally, it attacks the credibility of the Student Forum. Not releas- in:g the vote totals furthers the not uncommon notion that the Forum is not unlike a clique-ish, smoke-filled room. An.y elected body that hides the details of its elections should be questioned. Imagine the outrage if this were to happen on. a larger scale! Jf ~he FEC po- litely told tlie Washington Post that Clinton defeated Dole, but not by how much, the nation would be up in arms and think the FEC is a sham. My frie:nds, Markowski's elections are, in- deed, a sham. I can only hope that Markowski will change his tune for the upcomi:ng class rep- resentative races.

General Accounting Office Issues Report over Kosovo Report seen as critical in deciding fate of US involvement in this and future operations by Charles Tuthill Staff Writer On Monday, the General Ac- counting Office, which is the in- vestigative branch of Congress, released a report on the condition of peace in the Balkans. The report comes in the midst Senate debates over US troop in- volvement in the region. Led by Senators Jolln Warner ofVirginia and Robert Byrd of West Virginia the Senate is debating a bill that would revoke funds for US peace- keeping troops in Kosovo unless Congress aj)proves their involve- ment. Following the conflict in Kosovo, President Clinton ap- proved the deployment of these troops to hel:p ]Jrevent further vio- lence. However, this measure was not voted on by Congress, which ulti- mately controls the use of combat troops when they are abroad for long periods of time. At the heart of the matter is an amendment passed by the Senate Appropria- tions Committee last week. The bill se1the deadline for U.S. troop withdrawal at July 1, 2001 if Congress has no1 yet approved the use of ground troops. The rest of the Senate is expected to vote on the bill on Tuesday as part of a military construction bill. Military ex,penses are central to the debate over U.S. involvement in Kosovo.

Against the rebels were 35,000 to40,000 govenunent troops prepared to defend the city from the assault. The rebels warned them to sur- render using the radio. The shell- ing signaled a rebel advance against the city as the 170 year civil was about to enter a decisive phase. The Tamil rebels now claim to have strategic locations on the out- skirts of the city. The goal of the rebels is to rec1aim their cultural capital of their would-be homeland. The rebels first launched an of- fensive to strike the Sri Lankan troops from three different sides. Meanwhile the Sri Lankan military, using air attacks killed fifty-five rebels and sunk a rebel boat in an attempt to push the rebels off the Jaffnan peninsula. Meanwhile, a Norwegian envoy arrived in India to try to make a peace agreement between the two side. The Liberation Tigers ofTamil Eelam have been fighting for 17 years now, hoping for an indepen- dent homeland.

However, Norwegian officials do not see a fast end to the fighting in Jaffna. There is tittle indication that the Sri Lankan authorities and L TIE leaders are prepared for talks, or willing to exercise such a re- straint. The European Union, mean- while, urged Sri Lanka to end re- strictions recently imposed on civil liberties, and against the press.

Despite these calls, it is certain that the civil wa1 will continue for a little longer at least There is no indication at all that peace talks can take place. No side has pushed the envelope forward. It is hoped that someday soon, the fighting will stop, and peace will be regained in Sri Lanka. Let us hope that all these civil wars happening around the world is stopped. People die meaningless deaths too often Peace is the way to achieve great things not war. General Accounting Office Issues Report over Kosovo Report seen as critical in deciding fate of US involvement in this and future operations by Charles Tuthill Staff Writer On Monday, the General Ac- counting Office, which is the in- vestigative branch of Congress, released a report on the condition of peace in the Balkans. The report comes in the midst Senate debates over US troop in- volvement in the region. Led by Senators John Warner ofVirginia and Robert Byrd ofWest Virginia the Senate is debating a bill that would revoke funds for US peace- keeping troops in Kosovo unless Congress approves their involve- ment. Following the cunilH:t in Kusovo, President Clinton ap- proved the deployment of these troops to help prevent further vio- lence. However, this measure was not voted on by Congress, which ulti- mately controls the use of combat troops when they are abroad for long periods of time. At the heart of the matter is an amendment passed by the Senate Appropria- tions Committee last week. The bill set the deadline for U.S. troop withdrawal at July 1, 2001 if Congress has not yet approved the use of gr()und troops. The rest in this bill would be an amendment Cohen, telling reporters that the of the Senate is expected to VC'te that would limit funds for a with- amendment, if passed, would be on the bill on Tuesday as part of a drawal effort, should the other seen as \a de facto pull-out deci- rnilitary construction bill.

Harris said that only about fif- teen of the fmty-six delegate seats went to McCain supporters. Michi- gan GOP spokesman Sage Eastman said he couldn't confirm the num- ber of McCain supporters who be- came delegates. This decision marks the latest feud between the Arizona Senator and the Michigan GOP, which strongly support, Bush. Governor Engler is among Bush's key Michi- gan supporters and has been men- tioned as a possible Vice-Presiden- tial candidate.

18, 2000 • <!I.nnc.or.himsi5 Dogma is a Witty, Intelligent Film Steer Clear of Single & Single by Jessica Brearton Staff Writer When I wa.s in high school, a friend of mine worked in a video store and would go on and on about the many virtues of a Kevin Smith frlm. But somehow after all this time, I didn't get around to watching one until a few weeks ago.

I went to a Catholic high school, and am a Catholic myself, so the premise of Dogma, Kevin Smith's newest and most controversial film, was immediately interesting to me. The plot hinges on two angels, Loki and Bartleby (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, respectively), and their attempts to reenter Heaven after being banished years before (to Wisconsin, no less). Their means of entry is a church in New Jersey which, in an attempt to invigorate the church, is offering a plenary indulgence to all who walk through the cbwch's arches. This was where my years ofieli- gious educaticm in high school kicked in for me- in the Catholic: church, a plenary indulgence wipes out the repercussions of.all previ- ous sins.

The problem? Their reentry int() Heaven would, for all intents and purposes, prove God wrong and nullify all existence.

.P 18, 2000 • OOoncnrhlensis Dogma is a Witty, Intelligent Film by Jessie a Brearton Src4(Writer When I \\as in high school, a friend of mine worked in a video store and \\ollld go on and on about the many virtues of a Kevin Smith film. But somehow after all this time, I didn't get around to watchillg one until a few weeks ago. After doing so, I felt like immedi- ately callmg her up and telling her that I now understood what she was talking about. I went to a Catholic high school, and am a Catholic myself, so the premise of Dogma, Kevin Smith's newest and most controversial film, was immediately interesting to me. The plot hiages on two angels, Loki and Bartleby (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, respectively), and their attempts to reenter Heaven after being banished years before (to Wisconsin, no less). Their means of entry is a church in New Jersey which, in an attempt to invigorate the church, is offering a plenary indulgence to all who walk th1rough the church's arches. This was where my years of reli- gious education in high school kicked in for me -in the Catholic church, a plenary indulgence wipes out the repercussions of all previ- ous sins. The forgiveness granted by this plenary indulgence would nullify any further penance one must pay on earth or beyond, and therefore Loki and Bartleby soon spot it as a clear way for them to reenter HeaveR. The problem? Their reentry into Heaven would, for all intents and purposes, prove God wrong and Flullify all existence. The solution comes in the form of Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), a woman who feels she has lost faith but still at- tends mass every Sunday in the hopes of regaining it. She is called on by the angel wllo acts as the voice of God, Metatron (Alan Rickman), in the middle ofthe night and soon flnds herself on a cross-country mission to do nothing less than save the wC>rld. She is aided on this mission by several characters - Jay and Si,.. lent Eob, characters that crop up in ltl()St l)fSmith's films, Rufus (Chris Ro<:k) who is the 13th Apostle, a.nd Serendipity (Salma Hayek). Tile fi- nal two characters offer sharp in- sig\hts and cri,ticisms of what tluy see as faihngs cf the church and its members today, but never withollt a fu!ldaillental love and devotion to it, which is the very heart of the film. Tb.e film is very intelligent, espe- cially in its treatment of the com- plexities of Catholic dogma; the frame\.Vork ofthe film. The cbarac- ters speak in a remarkably acces- s i!F le way about the ins and 011 ts of cburc!J. doctrine, allowing the viewer to fC>ll<>w the fllm easily. Also, the diabgue of the characters is inher- ently clever, as it is in most Kevi:n Smith fihns, and distinctive. Tb.e film works both as a reflec- tion <>n the nature of religion and as a sus:penseful story, containing clur- acters that are not only original, but a]s() in.teHigent and complex. Lt also ll1lt.nag;es to deal with a complex sub- ject matter while being sharply funny, not a small achievement. It's aH part of this successful fllm from the talented Kevin Smith. Arts & Entertainment Steer Clear of Single & Single ily Eugene Schultz Staff Writer It occurred to me that for the last several weeks that all the books I have recotrunended have been only books that I have liked. All the books that have been re- viewed are ones th.at I want you to go out and read. However, in this week's article, I will warn you of a book to stay away from.

At the same time a freighter bound for Liverpool is boarded by Russian coast guards in the Black Sea. While all ·of this is going on the celebrated London merchant 'Tiger Single disappears into thin air. The main problem that I had with Single & Single is that the novel opens with a haunting set piece, then establishes a sequence of events wh()se connections are mysterious, C()n:lplex and confus- ing as hell.

This will have a democ- ratizing effect, allowing everyone to benefit from the same services. · These developments could actu- ally have much broader implica- tions for our society. First of all, we must consider the companies that will actually carry such services. What kind of company could pro- vide cable TV and high-speed [nternet access all at once for mil- lions of subscribers? Even if such conglomerates as AOL- Time~ Watner-EMI are not a forecast of the future. It seems inevitable that numerous media providers offering their servjces through the same line, conflicts of interest will arise. Then we must consider the ef- fect that such merging could have on the appearance of the resulting media. Much of the appeal of the Internet is its versatility. It is pos- sible for the individual user to use a variety of rapidly evolving ser- vices to communicate with a wide range ofusers across the globe. If the merging of multiple media ser- vices includes the Internet, this could generate an opportunity for subtle but meaningful changes in the way that it is accessed. If set-top-boxes replace personal computers as the tool for access, it may be more difficult for users to customize their use of the Internet and utilize new services. In the worst case scenario, media provid- ers, realiz:ing what a lousy adver- tising medium the Internet makes, will modify access so that users are less able to ignore advertisements, at the expense of much of the Internet's tlexibility. Equally disturbing is the trend of divergence, or the formation of smaller alternative networks with structures based on the Internet. ness Internet solutions are also predicted to increase dratnatically in the near future. Though such networks could be useful, they could also undertnine one of the greatest advantages of the Internet; its universality. Cur- rently, the Internet is used by a wide variety of users with differ- ent backgrounds and viewpoints. Individuals are exposed to a vari- ety of opinions that they would probably never encoWlter other- wise. Likewise, nations are forced with the choice of either adopting the Internet wholesale or becom- ing obsolete. This has had the remarkable ef- fect of ailowing Internet users ih authoritarian nations to view litera- ture from democratic nations online, with little intervention from their oppressive governments. If a variety of alternative networks exist, each catering to ·a specific type of user, then there would be little incentive or justification for a country or an individual to partici- pate in a network where \subver- sive\ viewpoints are known to ex- ist. As Internet use grows more widespread, the support of indi- vidual users could become a sig- nificant force in maintaining the Internet's useful chamcteristics. Nonetheless, the trends of conver- gence and divergence could pose serious threats to the Internet's potential to cultivate these types of encounters. The World Wide Web itself originated in large part from TimBemers-Lee devising an solution for one problem. Few in- ventions have developed so rap- Most political revolutions involve a violent overthrow of an old gove:tninent and replacing it with something new. We· experienced this in our own country some 200 years ago when King George HI ceased to rule and \we the people\ began · to rul'e the United S.tates o:f America. In order to achieve this, however, there was a need for violence, leadership, and adoption of new beliefs. We also use the word re':olution in reference to social change as in tl1e Industrial Revolution, when people started working in factories instead of in their homes. Or in the 1960's in America when women ·and minorities, through demonstra- tions and protests gained equal rights wder the law. However, there are many other kinds of revolutions, including scientific revolutions. One example of this is the Copernican Revolu- tion. Prior to this revolution, people believed that the universe was centered around Earth and all other bodies, sun, planets, and stars, orbited around us. This revolution did not occur as a result of new. technology or t@ols or exploring the heavenly bodies, but rather from a reorganization of thinking. This revolution did not involve a violent overthrow of the old way of thought, but rather a re-examination of those ideas previously held to be true. Copernicus merely rearranged the universe with the sun as the idly as this, and it was the versatil- new center and the Earth as ity and universality of the Intemet a distant third planet, and that allowed it to catch on so demoted the moon to a satellite quickly.

It took several decades for that new model to gain recognition b.y the general public, and over 300 years before the · Catholic Church recognized his theories. . This idea that scientific revolutions are changes in an established way of thinking is admired by many sCientists, but there are few examples to support it. Most scientific revolutions ate either extensions of some past idea or have evolved from something else. The cell theory for example, grew out of microscopy, the study of microscopic substances. Scientists studied tq.e properties of larger objects, boxes with smaller objects inside, and later applied them to cells. These studies became the inspiration for cell theory, presented as · earlyas 1665. This led to the idea of the life.

Union College Athletics: A Year in Review byRac:hel Bukowski Sports Editor Arnold Palmer once said, \I've always made the total effort, even when the odds seemed entirely against me. I never quit trying: I never thought that I didn't have the chance to win.\ The 1999-2000 Sports Se3son marked a turning point in the history of Union Col- lege Athletics, as records were bro- ken, new standards were set and the seniors were forced to say good-bye to events and teams that had shapecl their past four years at Union. EYen when it seemed as if defeat was imminent, these com- petitors continued to persevere, never giving up until the final hom had sounded. It is only appropriate t() recog- nize the Dutch women Soccer Team, who brought a new standard of excellence to Athletics at Union. For the first time in the history of the program, the Soccer team re- ceived an invitation to the NCAA Championship Tournament to compete againsfsome of the top- ranked teams in the New York Re- gion. The Dutchwomen made it all the way to the semifinals of the tournament, where they were de- feated by William Smith College. Union also made an appearance in the NYSWCAA Tournament, where they were seeded first and went on to win the tournament with an incredible 4-3 overtime victory over St. Lawrence. Highlights of the season include a 16-3-1 overall record and a 4-1-1 UCAA record. Junior Missy Matusewicz scored her one hundredth career point in a 5-1 win over Middlebury College, and Sophomore Lauren Byrne was named Tournament MVP in Union :s NYSWCAA Tourney vic- tory. The Men's Soccer Team en- joyed one of their best seasons in years. posting a 6-7-2 overall record and a 2-2-2 UCAA record. which gave them third place overall in the UCAA leag11e. Five of Union's seven losses were only by one point and came against NCAA Di- vision Three Powerhouses such as St. Lawrence, Middlebury and MIT. Union failed to make itto the playoffs, however, they rlid have a number of impressive perfor- mances including a l-0 win over Clarkson and a 2-1 win over Hamil- ton. The Men's and Women'~> Cross Country Teams experienced are- building year this past season, as they struggled a bit during their competitions, hut were helped by the leadership of seasoned veter- ans and a gr()up of new faces which would .n<>t only add numbers to the team, but skill as well. The teams were led by Coach Charlie Casey and runners Kenny Scott and Amy Slabi<:h, who both turned in notable performances at the State Meet in Oswego and the NCAA Qualifier. Dutchwornen Field Hockey posed a 6-7 overall record and a 3- 3 UCAA record. Five of the women's seven wins were shut~ outs against Wesleyan, RPI, St. Lawrence, Oneonta and Oswego and a number of the Dutchwomen received post-season honors for their outstanding play during the season. Sophomore Yvonne Turchetti was named as an East- em Regional Second- Team All- American and a member of the UCAA All-Conference First Team. The Women's Volleyball Team experienced one of their better sea- sons in 1999, as they posted a 14- 19 overall record under first-year I lead Coach Le.slie Bogucki and Captams Jill Wright and Joanna Enger, the only two seniors on the roster. Their record was highly competitive, as Union found itself matched up against Skidmore, Hamilton and Clarkson to name a few. The Dutchwomen also fin- ished fourth overall in the UCAA League. Freshman Corrin Jordan also received postseason honors, as she was named the UCAA \Rookie ofthe Year.\ The Union Women's Tennis Team continued a winning tradition as they proved that they still have what it takes to stay on top in the UCAA. They posted a 7-5 overall record and finished fourth in the New York State Tournament be- hind the leadership and talent of Senior Cassie Lawton and Junior Veteran Becky Rtt bin .. Lawton and Rubin always performed strong in the singles performances along with Sophomore Susan Yoo, while the doubles teams of Lawton-Liz Agar and Rubin-Yoo were almost unstoppable. Dutchmen Football brought a new wave of excellence to their al- ready strong program at Union College this past season under the direction of eight-year Head Coach John Audino and Captains Joe Attanasio, E.C. Stumpf, Brian O'Donnel and Devon Wimberly. The season was highlighted by a 20-3 win over the College ofNew Jersey, who was ranked fourth in the country for Division Three schools by Sports Illustrated Magazine. They posted an over- all 9-2 record and a 3-1 UCAA, record, which gave Union an invi- tation to participate in the ECAC Northwest Championships. They competed against Ithaca, defeating them in a decisive 31-7 victory. The Union Men's Basketball team was coached by Bob Mon- tana and led by Captains Zena Woldeyesus and Dave Copeland. They posted a I 7-12 overall record and a 5-7 record in the UCAA league, which gave them fourth place overall. They also advanced to the ECAC tJpstate New York Toumament,, where they were seeded sixth, but made it all the way to the finals of the tourney where they lost a devastating game to Ithaca, 77-76, finishing second. CJ. R()gers was named to the Second- TearrrUCAA All-Conference Team. The Shooting Dutchwomen had a highly competitive schedule this past season, and came out of it with an irnpiessive 13-13 overall record and a 5-7 UCAA record, which gave them fourth ·in the league. The team was directed by fifth-year Head Coach Mary Ellen Burt and Captaill Leah Oliveri. Oliveri closed her fi11al year on the team by scor- ing her one thousandth career point in Union's 75-55 win over Hamilton College. Union was in- vited t() compete in the UCAA Ch!!mpionship Tournament, where they fel1 to William Smith in the fi- nal four in a tough 74-53 loss, com- ing in fourth overall in the tourney. The Men's and Women's Swim Teams struggled during their regu- Jar seas()n competitions, but both teams managed to pull their perfor- mances t()gether and tum in incred- ible performances at the New York State Championship Meet. Under the guidance of Head Coach Judy Wolfe and Senior Captain Clark Smyth, tlte men came in third out of 14 teams at States. The 800 Freestyle Relay ofNathaniel Mar- tin, Ridgely Harrison, Steve Eberlein and S~ytlt swam an NCAA \B\ cut along wiili the 400 Freestyle Relay of Rob Kirkman, Eberlein, Smyth and Harrison. The Swimming Dutchwomen, headed by Wolfe and Captains Kerry Libiandi and Clewis Kinnett, posted a 4-6 overall record with wins over rivals Hartwick and St. Lawrence. At States, the women placed fo!Irth out of 14 teams, miss- ing out on third place by only 17.5 points. Erin Wittes won the 200 and 400 IM' swith NCAA \B\ cut times and Kinnett placed second in the 400 IM, also swimnring an NCAA \B\ cat The Skating Dutchwomen, in only theirfrrstyear as a varsity team un<ler Co~tch Fred Quistgard and Captain Melissa Johnson, opened their home season with an incred- ibl.e 12-2 win over MIT. Union posted a 4-19 overall record and a 4-13 ECAC record; h<>wever, their record is not reflective ofthe highly competitive schedule this young team was faced with. The Dutch- women took on some of the top teams in the nation including Middlebwy, Williams, and Bowdoin in a mtmber of hard-fought matches', The future is brigbt for this young team as they ,Jook to improve on their record tb.rough experience. The. Union College Skating Dutchmen improved on last year's season with the leadership of sec- ond-year Head Coach Kevin Sneddonand Captains Jay Varady, Ryan Cwnpbell and Bryan Yackel. Union began their season inc Den- ver, then returned home for a vic- tory against Colgate University. The Dutehmen highlighted their season with an incredible 3-2 over- time v.ictory against RIT to inten- sify the infamous rivalry between the two schools. In a 4-2 victory over Brown University, Union se- cured its spot in the ECAC play- offs for the fourth time in it~ nine years as a Division I team. [n the playoffs, tlle Dutchmen lost in the first round. to ECAC powerhouse St. Lawrence in a best of three se- ries, 8-4 a11d 4-3 (On, but they are looking to improve for next season with the loss of only two senior~>. The Softball team continued its strong winning tradition this past season with a 2 0-13 overall record and a 4-2 U CAA record under third year Coacll Peter Brown andCap- tains Julie Cardettino and Cassie Lawton. They made it all the way to the NYSWCAA Tournament, where they placed sixth overall af- ter losing to Utica and St. J0hn Fisher and defeating Elmira Col- lege; 8~6 behind the powe-rful pitching ()f Apryle Pickering, Meghan Crowley and Sarah Johnston. The team is only losing two seniors, Lawton and Sarah Cardullo, and has gained a .signifi- cant amount of talented freshmen this year. The Uni()n Baseball Team, un- der Head C<lach Gary Reynolds and Captains Jake Gunschel, Zac ICing and Eric K()pka, endured a difficult season in which they achieve:d a 12-16 overall record and a 4-6 UCAA rec()rd. The team began their season with Spring Training in Florida, where they won fouran.d lost four in a series of games which indicated a lot of promise for this team. They returned home andhad a very inten~e schedule, sometitnes with multiple doubleheaders in()ne week. TheD11tchmen marked th.eir season with a 4-0 niiJ.e-inning game against St. Lawrence andan 11-10 victory over the Saints later that day. The Men's and Women's Out- door Track Teams took advantage of large numbers and many sea- soned veterans to come out on top at many oftlleirmeets this Spritl,!?;- Union began their season against Hamilton College and although the Dutchmen were unable to de- feat the Blue, they did make the score very close. Field events teams played an integral part of the success of the Union Track and Field teanis The runners, however, shollld not be downp1ayed as the relay teams were a.aefmite strength ofthe team. Although the Crew Teams com- peted in the fall, the extensive .part of their competition was held in the spring. They participated in the President's Cup, the Gillman Cup and the State Championships in Rome, NY, to name a few. The Union Crews kept the Gillman Cup and Plate for another year, as the Men's Varsity 8 barely squeaked by Hamilton and the Women's Varsity 8 showed up Hamilton by over 15 seconds. The Men's Lacrosse Team had the best season they experienced in five years, with an overall record of8-6 and.a UCAA recordof4-2, earning them second place in the league. Despite their winning record and a victory over Oswego, one of the top teams in the state, the men were denied an invitation to the ECAC playoffs. The team; led by third year Head Coach George McCormack and Captains Colin Murdock, Nick Goater and Jordan Thomas opened up their season in Colorado and returned home to take on Middlebury and William Smith, tw<> nationally ranked teams. The Union College Women's Lacrosse Team, asthe Soccer Team had done, set a new standard of excellence in Union College Ath- letics. The team was denied a bid to the NCAA Champi()nsbip Tour- nament after losses to Hamilton and University ofRochester; how~ ever, these women went on to win the NYSWCAA Tournament, de- feating the number one seed, Nazareth College in a decisive 19- 9 victory. Senior Abby Harris was namedthe TournamentMVP. This was the first time in the history of the program that the Union Women • s LAX team won this tour- nament. As another year in Union Col- lege Athletics comes to a close, many students are pausing to re- flect on the time spent with their teams and the bonds that were foril1ed. For many underclassmen, the upcoming season brings the knowledge that althou~h quitting may seem like the easy solution, there is nothing like the tlrrill of competition. For the seniors, the 1999-2000 season brought pain, smiles and eventually tears as the end oftheir career as a Union Col- lege Athlete came to a close.

I never quit trying: I never th<Jught that I didn't have the chance to wm.\ The 1999-2000 Sports Season marked a turning point 111 the l1istory of Union Col- lege Athletics, as records were bro- ken. ne1v standards were set and the scnJcrs were forced to say good-llye to events and teams that had shaped their past four years at l'nion Even when it seemed as if defeat '\las imminent. these com- petitors contmued to persevere_ never g iv :ing up until the final hom had SOUilded. It is 011ly <.lppropriate to n:t.:og- ni;.re the Ihnchwomen Soccer Ie<Ull, who brought a new standard nf excellenc~ to Athletics at Union. For the fi£st time in the histmy of the program. the Soccer team re- ceived an imitation to the NCAA Championship Tournament to compete ::tgainstsome of the top- rankedtea.n>s in the New York Re- gion. The J)utchwomen made it all the way t<J the semifinals of the tournament, where they were de- feated by William Smith College. l 'nion also made an appearance in the i\YSWC'AA Tournament. where they were seeded first and \\ cnt 011 t<J win the tournament with an incrcuihlc..t-.3 overtime victory mer St. L.m:rencc. Highlights of the seas()ninclode a 16-3-1 on:rall record and a 4-l-1 liCAA record. Junior \1issy Matuscwicz scored her one hu ndrcdth career point in a )-! win o\~w·e-r l\1 iddlehury College. and SopllonJore Lauren Byrne \Vas named Tournament MVP in l'mon 's N'r'SWCAA Tourney\ ic- tory. The Men's Soccer Team en- Joyed o nc Df thl.'ir hcst seasons in }Tars. pos t1ng a 6-7-2 ovcraU rcc<>rd and a 2-2-2 l ICAA record. \.vhich gave the1n tilird place overall in the l fCAA le-ague. Five of Union's seven l<Jsses were only by one pomt and ctme against NCAA Di- visiOn Three Powerhouses such as St. Lawre11ce. Middlebury a11d MIT. Un1on failed to make it to the playoffs, hwwever, they did have a number of impressive perfor- mances inc! uding a 1-0 win over C'larkson and a 2- I win over Hami 1- ton. The Men'!iand Women's Cross Country Teams expenenced are- huildmg yean th1s past season, as they struggl-ed a hit during their competiti()ns. but were helped by the leadership of seasoned veter- ans and a group of new faces \\ hich would not only add numbers to the team. bl~t skill as \\ell. The tl'ams were 1 ed hv C't JJL\h Char lie Casey and runner> Kenny Scott and Amy S lahch. \\ ho hoth turned in notable performances at the State Meet in Oswego and the NCAA Qualifier_ Dutchwomen Field Hockey posed a 6-7 overall recoFd and a 3- 3 UCAA record. Five of the women's seven wins were shut- outs against Wesleyan, RPI, St. Lawrer~ce, Oneonta and Oswego and a number of the Dutchwomen received post-season honors for their outstanding play during the season. Sophomore Yvonne Turchetti was named as an East- em Regional Second-Team AU- American and a member of the UC AA All-Conference First Team. The Women's Volleyball Team expenenced one of their better sea- sons in I 999. as they posted a 14- 19 overall record under first-year Head Coach Leslie Boguc.kl and Captams Jill Wright and Joanna Enger. the only tvvo seniors on the roster. Their record was highly competitive, as Union found itself matched up against Skidmore, Hamilton and Clarkson to name a few. The Dutchwomen also fin- ished fourth overall in the UC' AA League. Freshman Conin Jordan also received postseason honors, as she was named the UCAA '\Rookie of the Year.\ The Union Women's Tennis T earn continued a winning tradition as they proved that they still have what it takes to stay on top in the UC' AA. They posted a 7-5 overall record and finished fourth in the New York State Tournament be- hind the leadership and talent of Senior Cassie Lawton and Junior Veteran Becky Rubin. Lawton and Rubin always performed strong in the singles performances along with Sophomore Susan Yoo, while the doubles teams of Lawton-Liz Agar and Rubin- Yoo were almost unstoppable. Dutchmen Football br<lught a new wave of excellence to their al- ready strong progrdrn at Union College this past season under the direction of eight-year Head Coach John Audino and Captains Joe Attanasio, E.C. Stumpf, Brian O'Donnel and Devon Wimberly. The season was highlighted by a 20-3 win over the C' ollege of New Jersey, who was ranked fourth in the country for Division Three schools by Sport.s Illustrated Magazine. They p()sted an over- all 9-2 record and a 3-1 UCAA record, which gave Union an invi- tation to participate in the ECAC Northwest Championships. They competed against ltl1aca, defeating them in a decisive 31 -7 victory. The Union Men's Basketball team was coached by Bob Mon- tana and led by Captains Zena Woldeyesus and Dave Copeland. They posted a I 7- 12 ()vera II record and a 5-7 record m the UC'AA league. which gave them foUJ1h place overall. They also advanced to the ECAC Upstate New York Tournament, where they were seeded sixth, but made it all the way to the finals of the tourney where they lost a devastating game to Ithaca, 77-76, finishing second. C.J. Rogers was named to the Second- Team UCAA. All-Conference Team. The Shooting Dutch women had a highly competitive schedule this past season, and came out of it with an impressive 13-13 overall record and a 5-7 UCAA record, which gave them fourth in the league. The team was directed by fifth-year Head Coach Mary EJlen Burt and Captain Leah Oliveri. Oliveri closed her final year on the team by scor- ing her one thousandth career point in Union's 75-55 win over Hamilton College. Uroion was in- vited to compete in the UC AA Championship Tournament, where they fell to William Smith in the fi- nal four in a tough 7 4-53 loss, com- ing in fourth overall in the tourney. The Men's and Women's Swim Teams struggled during their regu- Jar season competitions, but both teams managed to pull their perfor- mances together and turn in incred- ible performances at the New York State Championship Meet. Under the guidance of Head Coach Judy Wolfe and Senior Captain Clark Smyth. the men came in third out of I 4 teams at States. The 800 Freestyle Relay of Nathaniel Mar- tin, Ridgely Harrison_ Steve Eberlein and Smyth swam an NCAA \B\ cut along with the 400 Freestyle Relay of Rob Kirkman, Eberlein, Smyth and Harrison. The Swimming Dutchwomen, headed by Wolfe and Captains Kerry Librandi and Clewis Kinnett, posted a 4-6 overall record with wins over rivals Hartwick and St. Lawrence. At States, the women placed fourth out of 14 teams, miss- ing out on third place by only I 7.5 points. Erin Wittes won the 200and 400 IM's with NCAA \B\cuttimes and Kinnett placed second in the 400 IM, also swimming an NCAA \B\ cut. The Skating Dutchwomen, in only their first year as a varsity team under Coach Fred Quistgard and Captain Melissa Johnson. opened their home season with an incred- ible I 2-2 win over MIT. Union posted a 4- I 9 overall record and a 4- I 3 ECAC record; however, their record is not reflectiv-e of the highly competitive schedule this young team was faced with.. The Dutch- women took on some of the top teams in the natit:Jn including Middlebury, Willia~mandBowdoin in a number of hard-fought matches. The future is bright for this young team as they look to improve on their record through experience. The Union College Skating Dutchmen improved JQn last year's season with the leadership of sec- ond-year Head Coach Kevin Sneddon and Captains Jay Varady, Ryan Campbell and B,ryan Yackel. Union began their season in Den- ver, then returned horrne for a vic- tory against Colgate University. The Dutchmen highBighted their season with an incredilble 3-2 over- time victory against RJT to inten- sify the infamous riv~airy between the two schools. In a. 4-2 victory over Brown University, Union se- cured its spot in the ECAC play- offs for the fourth time in its nine years as a Division I team. In the playoffs, the Dutchmen lo•st in the first round to ECAC powerhouse St. Lawrence in a best of three se- ries, 8-4 and 4-3 (OT), but they are looking to improve for nexi season with the loss of only l'Wo seniors. The Softball team cantinued its strong winning traditiam this past season with a 20- I 3 ov eral1 record and a 4-2 UCAA recorchmderthird year Coach Peter Brown and Cap- tains Julie Cardettino and Cassie Lawton. They made it ail the way to the NYSWCAA Tournament, where they placed sixtln overall af- ter losing to Utica and St John Fisher and defeating Elmira Col- lege, 8-6 behind the powerful pitching of Apryle Pickering, Meghan Crowley and Sarah Johnston. The team is only losing two seniors, Lawton ;and Sarah Cardullo, and has gaineod a signifi- cant amount of talented! freshmen this year. The Union Baseball Team, un- der Head coach Gary Reynolds and Captains Jake Gunschel., Zac King and Eric Kopka, endurell a difficult season in which they a.chieved a 12-16 overall record snd a 4-6 UCAA record. The te;am began their season with Sprin~ Training in Florida, where they wo.n four and lost four in a series of games which indicated a lot of promise for this team. They returned home and had a very intense schedule, s•ometimes with multiple doubleheallers in one week. The Dutclunen m~rked their season with a 4-0 nine-inoing game against St. Lawrence and an 11-10 victory over the Saints later that day. The Men's and Women's Out- door Track Teams took a•dvantage of large numbers and many sea- soned veterans to come OJUt on 1op at many of their meets this Spring. U11ion began their season against Hamilton College and although the Dutchmen were unable to de- feat the Blue, they did make the sc(')re very dose. Field events teams played an integral part of the success of the Union Track anJ Field teams The runners, however, should not be downplayed as the relay teams were a defmite strength ofthe team. Although the Crew Teams com- peted in the fall, the extensive part of tbeir competition was held in the spring. They participated in the President's Cup, the Gillman Cup and the State Championships in Rome, NY, to name a few. The U rrio n Crews kept the Gillman Cup and Plate for another year, as the Men\s Varsity 8 barely squeaked by Hamilton and the Women's Varsity 8 showed up Hamilton by over 15 seconds. The Men's Lacrosse Team had the best season they experienced in five years, with an overall record of8-6 and a UCAA record of4-2, earning them second place in tile league_ Despite their winning record and a victory over Oswego, one of the top teams in the state, the men were denied an invitation to the ECAC playoffs. The team, led b:y third year Head Coach Geoige McCormack and Captains Colin Murdock, Nick Goater and Jordan Thomas opened up their seas<Jn in Colorado and returned home to take on Middlebury and William Smith, two nationally ranked teams. The Union College Women's Lacr<lsse Team, as the Soccer Team had done, set a new standard of excellence in Union College Ath- letics. The team was denied a bid to tl1eNCAA Championship ToUJ- nament after losses to Hamilton and University of Rochester; how- ever, these women went on to win the NYSWCAA Tournament, de- feating the number one seed, Nazan~·th College in a decisive 19- 9 vict<>cy. Senior Abby Harris was named the Tournament MVP. This was tile first time in the history of the program that the Union Women's LAX team won this tour- nament. As another year in Union Col- lege Athletics comes to a close, many students are pausing to re- flect on the time spent with their teams and the bonds that were formed. For many underclassmen, the upc<lming season brings the knowledge that although quitting may seem like the easy solution, there is nothing like the thrill of competition. For the seniors, the I 999-2000 season brought pain, smiles and eventually tears as the end of their career as a Union Col- lege Athlete came to a close. Con- gratulations to all the teams, who now understand the countless hours pu 1 into attaining perfection.

This r<::port, available i:n last :week's Concordiensis, as well as anline and at the Dean of Students' of- . :fice, would uproot almost every fra- ternity, sorority, and theme house from their current :residence and. assign them a newer, and in most cases, smaller residence. Twelve of the \best\ residences would house twelve new campus houses. Every student would be assigned to pne of these houses upon ar- rival to Union and be given a dmnce to live in th.e house.. The pmposal also includes a number o.f new social altematives, includ- ing the construction ef a \party bam'' that all .groups would have access to, and possibly convert- ing the College Bookstore into a pub/nightclub, and juice bar, and coffeehouse. 'These changes would be implem~n,ted by the fal1 ·of 2004, after all cllrrent Union stu- dents have presumably gr.aduated. The committee recommends that President Hull take no action on this proposal before October 2000, so adequate feedback can be so- licited and tal<;en into account. The lJ2Kcommittee convened in the· fall of 1998 and has b~en drafting.and refuting the proposal for the past two years. The com- mittee consiste.t:f of alumni, admin- istrators, faculty, andstudent lead- ers. One student, Aaron Seliger, a Sigma Phi brother, refused to s~gn the report and quit the committee beforeitwas r~leased. Seliger said be refused to sign the report for two reasol_ls: ''First, l could never sign something that takes away my bouse. Second, I don~t believe it's going to work.'~ Seliger added \1 don't think it's going to work for a lor of reasons. It's not going to solve the problems of the Greek system, it's just going to push them to the edge of campus. People. won't have any loyalty to their new houses. The way it is now, if there's a p(}Ity at :my house or Chi Psi, for example, if people begin to trash the house, we stop them. At these new houses, people will not care. •• Costs of the Plan: own, SigrnaPhiand Phi Delta Theta, to· be incJ!lded it) the new hou~e system.. Doespite the fact that the colleg.e owns the land tll.e~e houses sit on, it would ,hav~ to purchase ~eir :houses in order to enactthis.plan by the fall Qf 2()()4, as well asbreak the leases the £ta- ternities currently have with tl:te college. A.ccording to college at,.. torney Ch11ck Assini, Phi Delta Theta's lease expires onAugmt 14, 2012, while Sigma Phi's ru.ns throughM:arch 14,2004. The col- lege weuld, according to Dia11e Blake, Vic:e President of Fin!lllce, pay fair JiU!rket value for the two houses. Althou.gh Blake couldn()t cornmenton thevalueofSigmaPhi and Phi Delta Theta, she couf\lD.llJ;Jd that Alpba Delta Phi was appraised to have a v.alu~ of $300,00() last year. Furthermore~ the report calls f()r Silliman Hall and Lamont Ho11se to be converted mto residence JJ.alls in order to join ,the new hm1se: S:YS,. tern. These buildings would l!eed to be re11ovated and new homes would need to lle found for tlte cf- fices Si11itnan.andLamont curreatly house, including GMI, Health. Set- vices, Reli~ious Services, Co101Sel- in,g Sei:vic:es~ a:nd others. 'Q:te rep()rt also calls for all resi- dence halls to be renovated ill1he nea;r future. When asked about specific costs, Blake shied away from naming an exact figure, but assured that the college is ••willing to put in a significant amount of money.\ Greekand Theme House Criticism: The U2K report is very unpopu,.. lar amongst the fraternities it seeks to uproot. Sigma Phi's president, Mike Nigro, commented tha:1 his house is \very much against the plan.\ He emphasized the fratemity's commitment to their house, saying, \We're going to d<J everything in our power to tty t<J keep <Jur house. We've already begun working with alumni to try to fight the plan.\ Psi Upsilon's president, Nick Balascio, said his fraternity was \pretty disappointed by the report. We're not just upset about losing our house, but also for the changes for the campus tha:t we do not agree with ... \ \We haven~t looked into it yet to determine ow official response, but we need something [from the college l to compensate for the money and work we've put into this house. We've contacted our alumni and to mobilize.\ Chi Psi's president, Ross Geisel, had similar concerns. Overall, Geisel said, Chi Psi was \not ill fa- vor of the report, not just because we're losing our house. lt~s not good for Union.\ Like Balascio, Geisel claimed, \I think we deserve some fmancial reimbursements for renovations and work we've put into this house.\ Additiona.ll y, Geiselconfinned that if Chi Psi was to move off-campus, they would lose their charter from their national chapter. \We cannot move off- campus,\ he said. John Vero '97, a member.ofthe U2K committee and Phi Delta Theta alum, expressed optimism f<>r the future of Phi Delta Theta desp.ite the presumed impeding loss of their house. \I joined an orga!liza- tion, I didn'tjoin a building,\Vero claimed. V eroput more a pragmatic face on Phi Delta Theta's outlook saying the chapter needed to «question whether Phi Delta Theta could remain in that buildin~ for many more years ... Perhaps cOo-op- eration [with the college] wo11ld be the best route for us. The ultimate say is with the alumni, the current students have very little say.\ ?hi Delta Theta's current president, Court Clinch, was unavailable for Continued on Page 3 WetFest 2000 on West Beach Sports: Centerfold Pages 12-13 U2K Reactions by Clare Canal Staff Writer This past weekend, the much- awaited Springfest, the most at- tended event on Union's campus, silently came and went.

These changes would be implemented by the fall of 2004, after all current Union stu· dents have presumably graduated.

The U2K committee convened in the fall of 1998 ancl has been drafting and refming the proposal for the past two years. The com- mittee consisted of alumni, admin- istrators, faculty, and student lead- ers. One student, Aaron Seliger, a Sigma Phi bFother, refused to sign the report and quit the committee before it was released. Seliger said he refused to sign the report for two reasons: \First I could never sign something that takes away my house. Second, I don't believe it's going to work.\ Seliger added \I don't think it's going to work for a lot of reasons.

At these new houses, people will not care.\ Costs ofthe Plan: The plan calls for two buildings that the college does not currently own, Sigma Phi and Phi Delta Theta, to be included in the new house system. Despite the fact that the college owns the land these houses sit on, it would have to purchase their houses in order to enact this pIan by the fall of 2004, as well as break the leases the fra- ternities carrently have with the college. According to college at- torney Chuck Assini, Phi Delta Theta's lease expires on August 14, 2012, while Sigma Phi's runs through March 14,2004. The col- lege would, according to Diane Blake, Vice President of Finance, pay fair market value for the two houses. Although Blake could not comment on the value of Sigma Phi and Phi Delta Theta, she confirmed that Alpha Delta Phi was appraised to have a value of $300,000 last year. Furthermore, the report calls for Silliman Hall and Lamont House to be converted into residence halls in order to join the new house sys- tem. These buildings would need to he renovated and new homes would need to be found for the of- fices Silliman and Lamont currently house, including GMI, Health Ser- vices, Religious Services, Counsel- ing Services, and others. The report also calls for all resi- dence halls to be renovated in the near future. When as:ke<l aboNt specific costs, Blake shieed away from naming an exact figUJrtie, but assured that the college is \willing to put in a significant ar.naunt of money.\ Greek and Theme H11nse Criticism: The U2K report is very ltllJPopu- lar amongst the fratemitie:s it seeks to uproot.

Veroput more a pragmatic face ()!1 Phi Delta Theta's outlook saying the chapter needed to \question whether Phi Delta Theta could remain in that building for many more years ...

The usually littered West Beach was barely scattered with a hand- ful of students and visitors. How- ever, the bands did play on. The weekend festivities started out optimistically, despite the dreary gray skies, o/ith Lobster Bake 2000. Due to the wet weather, the 900 boiled she 11 fish were served inside, turning .the campus center into a four-floor feasting frenzy. At times, the queue stretched tluough the front doors of the Campus Center to the Nott Memorial. Program Assistant Liz Schmitt noted, \The Lobster bake was a hit! Dining Services deserves all of the credit.\ In the end; the Cam- pus Center was unindated with lobster shells, juice and soiled bibs. Despite the cold climate and plates of lobsters consumed, most stu- dents saved room for tlle ice cream A a rem Soeliig er/CP The Rise performes at Springfest. bar, located out on the patio. Although the ice cream was not Ben & Jerry's, this year's t-shirt logo was a spin-off designed by Liz Kaier '00. Even with wishes for warme1· conditions, the sun did not make an appeannce for the outside fes- tivities planned for Saturday. The huge carnival-like games were being set-up early im 1hle morn- ing. Games include a tl'allrlpo line, joust, rock pyramid, b'llm~e.e run, giant slide and obstacl.e cowse. The bands played as scmeduled. They included The Rise , ll.:ecl Light District, (who have pre\Vious1y played at Union), and OmePeople Bim Scala Bim. With the wet conciitiCitLS, some students could be seen trying to reinact Woodstock '94 by dancing and playing in the numerous mini mucipits. Some students stopped and looked just for a few minutes as they entered and exited West Col- lege for brunch. They followed a routine similar to a typical Satur- day morning, ignoring the huge stage and sound system con- stru<:ted out in front of West. Similar to last year's Springfest weekend, the New York State High Scho<>l Track Meet was hosted by Union on Frank Bailey Field. At time!;, there were more high school athletes taking part in the celebra- tions. \1 Jemembered Springfest from last year and was hoping it would be here again.

' - - ' . . by Mary Feitoa News Edito-r Wit:lrin the past fe-w years there has been a lot pf talk a.lout Union College moving from our current three-term trimester system to the mote commonly known.two-term · semester system. As rnost Union College students are awa1e, Union is one of very few institutions that still maintains a trimester or three- tenn academic calendar. Dartmouth C()llege lllldC31elton Ccdlege are arnong the few univer- sities who thrive under ft. trimester system. Recently there has been a great deal of discussion regarding the benefiis of the trimester.system on Union ;s campus. Hoban and Will- iam-Smij:hColleges will end its tri- mestersystem this year andwill in- stitute a semester calelldar beg:in- ningfall of2000.

Clt.ott:cttr.Men!5is • May 25, 20()() • Page 3 She emphasized that it is \Im- perative that we aU work to maxi- mize the virtues of the ,trimester.\ In order to do thi$, she suggested that the number of students par- ticipating in term abroad programs increase and also ensme that the students are being provided with courses equal to th.ose of full~se­ IIiesters. If in the future Union makes the change. towards the se- mester system, upon the President's approval, it will be a two-year process for implementa- tion. Another proponent of the se- mester system, Professor Charles Batson of the Modem Languages Department, explained, \The se- mester system lends itself to the work [professors] want to do in class.\ He also expressed that the semester system would be very beneficial to literature and lan- guage courses,. allowing students to meet more frequently during the week and over a longer period of time. He further voiced his opinion that the trimester system is a diffi- cult adjustment for new faculty members. He cited the ahuost non-existent break between win- ter and spring term as being espe- cially difficult for faculty members who try to create interesting courses for spring term. There are also those faculty members whD support the trimes- ter .system and were happy with the results of the vote. Professor Tom Werner of the Chemistry Department was \de- ligllted\ with it. He said, \What we say we do well, such as a strong major/minor, and terms abroad can he done better in 1he .present sys- tem.\ Werner has been at Union since 1971, when the advantage of the trimester system was devel- oped. He also stressed that the current curriculum has been set up around the three-tenn. ealendar. Some students are of the opin- ion that the semester system would be more beneficial to the college. Eril Raymond '01, a Mechanical Engineering major, commented, \As an engineer I would like to cover more topics, and would rather have fifteen weeks of class rather than ten.'~ He did mention thathe liked the his ability to par- ticipate on a term abroad but does not like the winter break saying, \[Students] are too long away from scb.ool~ and I would rather get out early.\ Freshman Allis~m Sturma dis- agrees with Raymond saying that she prefers the Trimester system to the Semester system. She stated, \The trimester system is a definite benefit to Union College, it offers many different opportuni- ties to students sucb. as work over the breaks and the ability to take more classes.\ Union Students Teach Economics at Local Schools by Kristen Zallomian News Edito,.

ROAR Recognizes and Trains Volunteers by Mary Felton News. Editor This past Sunday, May 21, Union College Hillel. the newGeisel Lit- eracy House and the Capital Re- gionJewish Coalition for Literacy ROAR [Reach Out and Read] Pro~ gram hosted a Thank You andRe- cruiting Program at Reamer Cam- pus Center, Robyn Kurland 'OJ andAndrew McCabe '03, presidents of Geisel House, the new literary theme house, welcomed the more than twenty-five students. Some were past volunteers of the ROAR program and some were new volunteers from the Geisel Literacy House on campus. They spoke about the goal of increasing the number of literacy volunteers on campus. Union student Elana Rudnik, ROAR Reading Coach at Zoller School in Schenectady recounted her experiences. Rudnik said, \ I worked through the winter at an- other school in Schenectady with two kids and it really helped. One of the kids... is on reading level now .... He is do:ing really well. Now I am working with one girl twice a week, Mondays and Fridays. She is in third grade and she can't read. She started (){f not being able to read anything .. .She didn't know her ABCs, nothing. We have got- ten her up so that she can read St1tdent volunteers thanked for work done during the year. most oftbe common words. I love working with her. The kids get very excitedtllat you have a one on one relation~hip with them.\ Rudnik concluded, \ Instead of sitting ill your room and watching a rerun f()r an hour of some stupid show ... go and help a little kid learn to read. 1 think that it is time well spent\ Susie Sommer Chair of the ROAR; a program sponsored by the Comtnunity Relations Council of the Je-wish said that Rudnik was going twice a week to coach at the Zoller School. \Elana was so com- mitted to the program that when the volunteer driver from the Coa- lition got sick, she walked to the school. Thatis one of the impor- tant issues for next year, We are working on this right now to pro- vide transportation fot·students to the schools. Our program does not require a lot of extensive train- ing because we are working with pre-K through third grade. Read- ing coaches either read aloud to students, gearing down to their level, the child reading totbe coach who discusses the story working on comprehension skills or there are assignments from teachers for special work on reading skills.\ Sommer told the volunteers, \Anything you can do to make that childfeellikea million bucks is the best thing you can be doing. That is our nuniber one goal Help them with literacy and let them know that we have come to show them we care about them and we want them to be successful in their life. That is the best thing you can do.\ Union student reading coach Marcy Hersh said •• I was working with one girl who was having a lot of problems .... A lot of times she was looking for a friend.\ Kurland added, \It is amazing how you feel like you have made a difference in someone's life .... and it really helps them too.\ Shelly Shapiro; Director of Com- munity Relations for the Jewish Federation gave Certificates of Appreciation tc Union College ROAR volunteers who were part of the program which began in December 1999. These volunteers include, Orly Amir, Stephanie Block, Erica Brauer, Kelly Burch, Julia Cantor, Laura Cotton, Rachel Dominguez, Alison .Fritz, Debi Golub, Marcy Hersh, Rosie Kriegler, Robyn Kurland, 1effLasker, Elyse Levy, Deena Lewis, Jenliie Ltibart, Jonathan MacDonald, Sofia Mazo, Jessica Miller, Stacy Potkit1, Elana Rudnick, JeffSilver, MaggiTarta, Sara TUllllllt and Tayla .Zuckerman.

-pre-Health <lvernigbt Trip tO Boston by Emlly DeSantis Contrib~,tting Writer May 5 marked the beginning of the fourth annual Pre-Health Soci- ety overnight field trip. Approxi- mately 35 students and five chap- erones traveled to Boston to visit health-related facilities:an.d ahm~n.i. Their first Stop was Boston University's Medical'Center where students were greeted by admis- sions officers from the medical school, public health and post-bac- calaureate programs. Dr. Viktoria Talebian '92, a member ofthe den- tal school faculty also greeted the students. The .presentations were followed by targeted tours of the facilities. Students also · toured Tufts'Medicd andden.tal schools in Boston and the veterinary school in North Grafton. Union College alUlillli offered small groUp touts ot Angell Me- morial Animal Hospital, the New England College of Optometry, Harvard's Medkal/Dental schools and research facilities aswellasthe private offices of a d~:rntist and pe,.. diairic ophthalmologist. The highlight of the trip was the Alumni-Student-Faculty Recep- tion during which students had the opportunity to convers·e with alumni over dinner and to gain in- sight into career paths that they have taken to reach their health profession goals. The twenty..,seven alumni whe attended represented many careers including medicine, nursing, bio- medical research:, dentistry, speech-la11guage pathology, and public health. Students came away from the experience with internship offers, valuable contacts, and rekindled motivation. HernaKothari '02 com- mented, \I f¢el Less. confused. The trip helped me to ilarrow my focus to two specific career choices.\ Some students, esp«:ially fresh· men and sopnomores, expt:essed being even more colifused by the exposure to many choices they had never previously considered. Co-chair~HeatherKennedy '01, was pleased with the success of the trip commentitlg. \It is impor'- tant because tours and alumni open students' eyes to different health profession enviro111nents and to.diverseopportunitiesavail- able in the field/' Special thanks should be given to our eager and en-. thusiastic alum, Profe.ssor Williams :for George Butterstein, P:t:ofessor Caml Weisse, Professor Williams, and Dr. Toni Rornanazzi '77, yvho was the· founder. time, said, \This was one of the best college sponsored trips I have ever been on.

The Pre-Health Society would especially like to thank the faculty for allowing students to participate in this ailflual excursio:o. which pro- vides a. glimpse of future career opportunitie's and undoubtedly heightened enthusiasm for what they are learning in the classroom and laboratory a.t Union. Plans are already undetway for next year~s visit to New York City. U2K Reveals Proposalspringfest comment Colette Muller, 200()..2001 House Manager for Smith House, one of the theme house to be uprooted by the proposal had a mote opti- mistic outlook. \We want to give it[theproposal] a chance, At first, I was against it, but it's a. good pro- posal, although I believe it could use some editing.'' Greek andThemeHouse Endorsement: The three leaders of the frater- nity, sorority, and theme house systems all sat on the U2K com- mittee and have endorsed the plan. In a letter to all.fraternity presi- dents,. President ofthe Interfrater- nity Council, Noah Trueger, and a Psi Upsilon brother,. used prag- matic arguments to defend the pro- posal. \How long can we realisti- cally last?\ he asked. 4 'President Hull is not bluffmg and neither is the faculty and administration... I feel that most of what is in the tJ2K report will in the long run be the best for the Greeksystem,\ Trueger said. President of the Panhellenic Coqncil, Kate Stefanik, a U2K com• mittee ·member, said of the pro- po~al: ''l don't think it will affect sororities. As it is now, a sorority could switch houses.\ Under the proposal, the college residences that currently house sororities, Hickok House and Potter House, woutd both be available to Greek organizations. The committee is asking, how- ever, thatno group retain its claim to its space \to create a fait pro- cess for distributing housmg at the time of transition.\ •.• continued/r(Jm page 1 '< Ian EletZ, Acting Theme House Consortium President, raved about the proposal itself,. but pulled no punches in assessing its effects on theme houses, ·~u· s necessary to create a new social system. If the Greek system wants to survive, it must throw its arms around this report,\ Eletz said. He predicted that \some theme houses will choose to blend in. It will take a sense of resiliency to survive. If theme houses really want to stick around, they will, but it will be harder in terms of rec:tuit- ing new members.\ Student Criticism: According to Student Forum President Mike Winn, President Hullinfounedhim, \lfthe Student Forum, as a representative of the student body, does not support the U2Kcommittee'sproposals, I will not seek to enact the changes. 1 will seek to abolish the Greek sys- tem.\ President Hull was notavail- able for connnent for this article, Student response has been, at best; lukewarm. Winn.said about the proposal: \Ie s a bit simplistic a11d conservative,. it doesn't pro- pose any changes to [the structure ·oq the Greek system.\ Senior Liz Schmitt conunented, \They never answered the ques- tion ofhow.\ The report calls for the creation of numerous commit- tees to determine the re-allocation ofhousing as well as drafting anew alcohol policy, but gives no time frame for these decisions. Senior Brian Roache, Student Forum Vice President of Finance, pointed out, ''The administration hasn't even given sophomore rush a chance to work.\ He continued to criticize the re- port, claiming, \It's not a fair com- promise, there is a certain value to incrementalism.'' Paul Gilroy, President of Sigma Chi, said, \Our house does not en- tirely agree with the report. If the college had built better housing in the fttst place, it wouldn't have to go around stealing the houses from current fniternities now.\ He com- plained that the new system \im- poses more limitations and restric- tions than the current system, which is mort~ liberal and free.\ Paul Stewart-Stand, Student Fo- rum Vice President for Campus Life, admitted that the report \seemed a bit drastic.\ U2KMembe.rs Respond: Some members of the U2K com- mittee agreed the proposal is not without flaws, such as Senior Jen Caruso, who disagreed with part of the report, saying, \I don't like how certain houses must move and lose traditions.'' Dean Alford, when approached with a numbers of criti- cisms, including questioning the rule against; switching houses, said on more thanone occasion, \Well that's something we need to look aC' Other committee members saw no flaws with the proposal. Vero, the alumni member of the commit- tee, cited the proposal's biggest flaw as the fact that \it cannot be implemented immediately.\ Professor Scott Scullion said; \Union will present a new face\ [if the report is implemented.] \It will no longer be Greek social life or no social life.\ Other Groups Respond: Professor Therese McCarty, chair ofthe Faculty Executive Com- . mittee, judged the faculty reaction to be positive. \I think it's quite interesting and innovative. I urge everyone to think about it.'; She also acknowledged that many fac- ulty have not yet read the report and a full, accurate response is un- determinable at this point. Professor Jim Underwood vali- dated McCarty's judgement. \I . thought it was a good report. The house system seems to make a lot of sense... I am impressed.\ He continued, \This is so. far beyond what the college woulcl have put out even five years ago.\ Dean of AdmissioOiis Dan Lundquist greeted the report opti~ mistically. \I am delighted that the process has seemed to work. People are willmg.t~ be reasonably open~minded. .. Out research has shown that many of our most sought-after students, .looking at small liberal arts colleges in New England, may say 'I'm not gomg to look at Union because it is a frat school... \I hope we can change the Union's perceptio~ in the guide books.\ Committee Seeks Response: The U2K comniittee is seeking responses to its proposal. It can be sent to U2K@union.edu or UiK 306Reamer Campus Center Union College Schenectady, NY 12308 , •• con(illued from page 1 had to be canceled because of the inclement weather. The widely advertised Waterplay, scheduled to take place on Rugby field, was cancelled. The ideaof tlking a dip in a pool or running on the Slip 'n Slide was not too appealing in the fifty de- gree weather late Friday afternoon. The campus-wide movie, usually shown OJ). West Beach, was can- celled due to lack of interest dur- ing last year's Springfest. In addition, because the Lobster Bake took place inside of the Cam- pus Center instead of out on the patio, students did not have the opportunity to hear the music of Drumstella and other muscial en- tertainment while enjoying their dinners. Due to the poor turnout, there also was no barbecue on West Beach and the events were wrapped up at an earlier time than · usual. With most college academic cal- endars fmished for the year, there was still a large number of visiting students on campus. Uowever~ many of them chose to visit Ctossgates Mall or watch a movie rather than enjoy the usu- . ally music filled day of fun in the sun. As it is every year there is a sig- nificant amount of preparation that goes into the planning of Springfest. The Concert Committe takes care of a lot of the costs for the event which goes towards the bands, sound system and security. Studens can only hope that next year the effort put in by those in charge will be enjoyed by all and more importantly that the weather will cooperate.

Football e--evaluation As we conclude our academic year, Concordiensis cannot help but look ahead to the fall term of 2000. When we return, many of us will once again enjoy either being involved in or supporting the Union College football team. Now, however, we feel that it is time tore-evalu- ate the status of this athletic institution. Wewould first like to commend Paul Stewart-Stand for coming for- ward ~~d bringing to the campus' attention an issue that is on many students' minds. While it is admittedly unfair to apply stereotypes to an entire athletic team, it is also easy to draw the following conclusion: The majority of the players on the footballteamoffera negative contri- buti()n to the social and academic life of the average Union College student. As a result, the college must alter the team's comp()sition; raise its academic and behavioral standards or eliminate it. Its disad- vantages .now clearly outweigh its inrended function: A source ofpride for the campus and an athletic activity for the players. Should the school !lOt act, it will become valid to question its dedication to an academic enviromnent In order to m.ake this point clear, Concordiensis has randomly se- lected seven undergraduate institutions of similar or better selectivity and relatively close proximity: Connecticut .College, Colgate Univer- sity, Hamilton College, Franklin & Mushall College, Wesleyan Univer- sity, Hobart & William Smith Colleges and Haverford College. We had no knowledge of the status of the scnools' football programs prior to selecting them. Tile results of this informal inquiry were shocking. Union had the largest roster, posting ninety-six on its Web site. The only other school to maintain a roster ()f more than ninety players was Colgate, however their program is Division 1-AA, and Union's is not. Hobart's squad may be considered comparable, witheighty-eight players but a smaller enrollment, however the remaining three schools support much smaller teams: Wesleyan has seventy-eight with 2, 7 59 students while Hamilton and Franklin & Marshall have fifty-four and· forty-eight players, re- spectively. It should be noted that Connecticut and Haverford do not have fo()tball progrnms. Tnis was obviously by no means a scientific survey, however if this random sampling is any indication, Ullion 's team is far too large. Given that there are approximately 1 ;000 male students at Union, the current condition where one of every ten is on the football team is wholly undesiiable for several reasons. It is obvious that .students who do not meet the academic standards for admission to Union College are admitted if they meet the criteria for playing football here. The ramifications of this are easy to see: If a student was not academically qualified to be admitte~ then he may not be able to work at the same level as tllose around him, and thus will be a negative presence in the classroom. Anofuer issue that many students may relate to is the overwheirning number of fraternity party incidentstbal involve members ofthis par- ticular sports team. While other students seem to be capable of tolerat- ing a certain level of bumping and spilling, it is hard to ignore the fact that the majority ()f those who wish to take issue with unintentional mishaps are on the f<>otball squad. Concordiensis allows for the fact that there are those players who are 11ot raucous, academically disinclined individuals that seiVe only to drain 011 the campus during the two terms that they are not in season. These students would doubtless have been admitted to the college with~ut their athletic qualifications, ll!ld as such shouJd not be consid- ered part of the problem. In conclusion, we ask that the administration of this school recon- sider the value of a Division III football team and the emphasis that is placed upon it. What may once have been a source of school spirit has evolved into an increasingly embarrassing organization for the school to sapport. We can rest assured that if the footba11 team were a Greek ()rganization, the school would be mach swifter in taking action. Pass/Fail Proposal Fails by BrookeM ..

Profes- claim that these students detract the academic environment of the lclaLssromn and deter other students fro.mparticipating. Both ofthese arguments illus- trate the close-minded and pessi- mistic view .that many professors at this institution have of the stu- dents. Although I respect the fac- ulty at this c()Uege and the work they do, this vote upsets me very much. Withthe help of the mem- bers of the AAC, I c~;eated a pro• posal that was not too extreme, yet itaileviated some of the stipu- lations on our already restrictive policy. We have a far more restrictive pass/fail policy than many other comparable institutjons.The AAC putforwardaproposal that \V()uld have made our policy a little more flexible. Unfortunately, my sources tell me that the faculty replied to my proposal with a policy that would make the sys- tem even more restrictive than before. For instarice, some wanted to apply the stipulation that one would have tojustify a pass/fail course and would only be allowed take the courses outside of one's major or majors. For example, this added stipu- lation would be very detrimental for double majors, like myself, because I could Qnly take classes in Divisions three and four, which are science & math and engineer- ing because they are outside of the Social Science and Humani- ties divisions. Thus, l would not be able to take a history class that examines the fall of Franco or a philosophy class on the ethics of law. My second reason for oppos- ing the faculty decision again ap- plies to my double major. Person- ally, I would have liked to have allowed myself more time to fo- cus on my political science senior thesis on the media and its role in transitions to democracy. Who on the faculty feels entitled to tell me that it would have been an iJ;re- sponsible deds:ion for me to take a pass/fail class during the tenns in which I was writing my two- term political science thesis and my one term Spanish thesis? Another argument questions the nature of the institution. For example, who are the c]a;sses for, the professors ()r the smdents? I thought that th~ classes 'Were for the students. Therefore I cannot understand why the fa~ulty at Union feel they have the: right to deny me, a decent, inteHle:ctually curious student,. an oppo<Jiliutllty because they consider the basic Union college student to lle an ir- responsible, beer guzztin~ s.tudent. They continually ass\lm~ that the worst case scenaljo will hap- pen and they rarely give students the benefit of the doubt. What this vote really does is make,t:his insti- tution more than ever a .school for irresponsible beer guzzlillg idiots. If this is the sort ofstadent we ca- ter to, this is the type CJf student we will get.. By not giving students the freedom to explore, they will lower themselves to the ex.pecta- tions of the faculty. Why J!.Ot set high stan<iards and encourage students t() rneet them instead of assuming that students will not succeed? Is it better t~ pun-- ish those who would, andl actually do, meet them? Furthermore, professon at Union think that people taking multiple pass/fail classes will lose out on jobs.

At this time, I would just like to add that three Greek organizations and one theme house Ill'(( the current Qc- cupantsofthis, s~- called, lowest class housing. The two buildings that fall into this category are Raymond House and Potter House. I make this point not to emphasize the bad housing on this campus but to point out that this is not a plan attacking frater- nities. Yes, the top five 'A+' houses on campus are fraternity hotisesj however~ has anyone recognized the fact that three of the four bottom 'B' houses are also fraternity houses? by Eugene D. S«.:hultz Distributi()M Manager On May 15 20()0, the U2K Steering Committee released a .report entitled A Proposalfor ResideJ!Iial and Social Life at Union. The e11tire campus should know \the future of Greek life at Union and the transition to sophomore rush, the establishme11t of an all-inclusive House System to begin in the Fall of 2004, and an arta:yofnew social initia- tives.\ {U2K Proposal, p.l) For the most part the U2K Steering Commit- tee did a fine job in dealing with the issues that were presented to them. However, sincetlle members of the committee are fal.lible, so too are some portions ofthe proposal. Included in the report is the ()Utline for what has been labeled as the \Proposal for a House System.\ (U2K Proposal, p.3) The House S-ystem. as outlined calls for a system \comprised of twelve houses and every Union student will be assigned randomly to membership in one of them )JfiDr to arriving as a rreshman.\(U2IC Proposal, p.3) The committee feels that by creating this new House System they will create \a source of connecticm to the College, as well as a source ofmendship, learn- ing, motivation to get involved in ex- tracurricular life. a.nd, perhaps above all, an enjoyable aa1d vibrant social life.'' (U2K Proposal, p.3) 1t is the belief of the committee that by implementing this housing system, Greek presence on campus will\move Greek life more to- ward the periphery (literally and figu- ratively) while mabt1g available to ev- ery Union studeni some of the most valued parts of <ireek. life.\ (U2K Pro- posal, p.2) The report at its .core tries to deal with the inequality ofhousing at Union College. They want to make it so that both men and women have the sarne opportunities when it comes to hous- ing on campus. Since the college has otily been co-educational since 1970 there is a discrepancy when it comes to where males and females live on cam- pus. By creating 1he twelve house House System the U2K Committee hopes that this wi II eliminate the hous- ing :issue at Union. Union does have a problem when it comes to where men md women live on campus. Do not getrnewrong, this must change. However, the way the commit- tee recommends h<lw this should he han<! led is where t personally have a problem. The committee believes that in order to make housing e([Ual on this campus the current residen1s of Fero House, . Sigma Phi, Smith H()tlse, Chi Psi, Psi Upsilon, Phi Delta 'Theta, 1248 Lenox Rd, 1294 Lenox Rd, 1320 Lenox Rd, and Wells House all must vacate in or- der to help initiate this plan. By en.- acting this plan the committee hopes that it \will give every student ac- cess to social space ~d funding to host programs.\ (U2KProposal, p.6) By taking these twelve houses the committee feels that they will be a more even playing field for all the students on campus. This is where the Proposal for Residential and Social Life at Union runs into major problems. They view that these houseswill be a bastion of academia, a center for social life, and the training ground for the future lead- ers of the country. Freshmen wiHbe assigned and become a member of one ofthesehouses. ffyou choose you can participate in any aspect of the house that you want. The freshmen will even get to have Freshman Pre- ceptorialin their assigned house. The question that arises is: What will bring these freshmen back after their fresh- man year? Once that class joins other organizations, whether it be a Greek organization, a Theme house, or even a club why will freshman want to come back tothesehou'se? As shown in the past the school has seen that apathy runs rampant at Union. Why will the creation of these houses change theapathy level on campus? Another foreseeable problem is: What will stop certain factions within these houses from taking over the Perhaps, due to the eruption of this issue many people are failing houses'? Members on the Steering Committee have said that because there will be faculty involvement this can- not happen; but it has happened ·in the past and it will continue to hap~ pen in the future. Ancther issue is that there is no clear-cut plan on how these new hous~ will pick members that are resi- dents of their respective houses. One could get shut out ofliving.in the house for the three years that they are eli- gible. What then? These people are still then forced to live in dol'n)s under the same living conditions that exist now, although some renovations will take place. Still, only a few people will get to live in the \castles.\ I tis their [the Steering Committee] intention to socially engineer a school in which free choice is eliminated. to recognize the possible benefits of this :s.ystem. This plan does al- low forihe long-term.preservat(on, · and. not destrudiou of tile Greek systematUnionCollege. Inaddi- tion, the proposal does have a stipulation that if no other group would like to enter the housing lot- tery (or a .particular house then the group who is currently associated with that house will he able to stay there. The one negative aspect of this clause is that it only includes those houses listed in 'Appendix B' ofthemostrecentU2KReport. The exact text of the proposal reads; '\ .. we encourage them[the distribution committee] t() include some element of choice, to enable some gronps to remain in the cur- tent place if no one else wants it.\ In addition, the committe~ will be appointed by Student Forum and will,consist ofSTUDENTS. Two of these students will benominated by the Theme House Consortium, one will be from·the Intematem.ity Council and the fourth will be from the Panhelle~ic council This means that the theme ltous~s and the Greek house~ tha:iare going to he most effected will be able to be the most active. participants in the redistribution. Yes, those fratemities with the biggest, nicest, most centrally lo~ cated hoses will have to move. However, a TRUE Greek society WILL be able to overcome moving to a different house. The school is not telling ,these groups that they. can no longer be members -of their · Greek societies, it is not :telling them. not to have parties or rush or pledges-. All the campus is. doing is moving these Greek o;rganiza- tions to another physical location. Those Greek organizations that are true to their Greek society will be able to survive sometlring like a simple relocation. Yes, there. ~e many houses that have a deep tra- dition and many memories within. However, the physic~! posses- sions of a Greek organization are not the important possessions of a Greek organization. An the orga- nizations that stand to l-oose their current housing need to consider the long-term effects of this pro- posal. They must consider two possible futures for their Greek and Theme houses. If these houses are open minded and willing to make changes, then they will survive. If these orgahizations are rigid a.Iid refuse to compromise they will not survive. People claim that when you join a Greek organization you are \buying your friends.\ Is this any different? True, there is no monetary exchange, but instead students are being forced into relationships. By making them be-- long to one ofthe twelve hduses, you are taking away their choice to make their own life at Union. In the end the report included quotes from both current and pastmembers · of the. Union College community. Per\ haps the most appropriate comment was said by a member of the class of 1959: \The emphasi~ on complete symmetry in all things-perhaps is the ultimate goal of some idyllic concept of political correctness, but it is bad architecture and worse policy.

The - report i11Cluded drastic changes to Unio11's Greek system, h()using, and - social space. · Although there are mixed reactions to the courses of action tlle institution is p.toposing, I agree that there needs to be some k£nd of change to housing ~nd social life on campus. The Steerins Committee's primary goal was .. to propose a s~t of refarms that would preserve the traditions of Greek Life that are consistent with an academic community that values open inquiry~ seriousness of purpose, diversity of opinions, and a broad and equitable choice of residential and social options:\ There is no depying the. fact that the Greek system plays major tole in the social scene; and that Union is very proud of tradition. But are the requests of the U2K Commit- tee an attempt to abolish the. sys- tem? Six. national :fr~temities were founded an these grounds, a)\d fraternities have occupied prirne real estate on campus for decades. The report states, \Tinkering With the Greek system beyond soph:o- more rush was not the best way to achieve an ideal residential and social program at Union·.\ The re- port also comments on the nega- tive effect 1:hat Greek life has on Union. In attempting to deal with the problems, the committee in no way wants to ~·weaken the Greek system without providing positive alternatives.\ But changing· to tile House System would, in fact, be a huge blow to the system. Slowly, Greek organizations will vanish from this campus. Students be- longing to a house will not have that tight bond that pledge classes experience if they are spread out in a variety of diffflrent houses, A conflict of interest to their organi- zation· and to tlleit \newly as- signed\ house will arise. Students join the Greek system to be a part of an organization, not a building. This is evidenced by Sigma Delta Tau blocking in Fox Hall, and Delta Delta Delta moving to different housing througho1.1t campus. Male Greek organizations live in some of the best ho1.1sing on campus, but should creating the new House System be a punisll- ment to sucll fraternities? No. The report proposes that the twenty- two Greek and Theme Houses will be guaranteed housing- just not in their current residences. Und~ the new plan, Sigma Phi, Psi Upsilon, Chi Psi, and Phi Delta Theta, Smith House and Wells House are being forced to relocate to dormitory housing. Every freestanding resi- dential house, including Fero House, Silliman Hall, Lamont House, and three hames on Lenox Road, will be converted into part of the House System. These houses will be used as a source of connection to the college, where all students will have the chance to use the common space, game tables and kitchen facilities. Hotising will never be equally fair, as. 'long as it is evaluated ftom A to B housing. Instead of eliminating fraternities and theme houses from their cuirellt homes, why nof improve hou~ing as a wh<;~ie? If a certain organization cannot fill their housing capacity requirement~, then yes, mayb~ they should be considered for relocation; but to take houses away from fraternitjes anq thetne houses to create equal housing and social space may not be the right tactic. Upion College h~s striveit to create theme houses as a living option for students, yet the report plans to remove Wells and Smith House ·from the center of campus. Theme houses are the wave of the future at colleg~s around the country, and Union is taking theme houses~ out of the heart of campus. It seems that if frate:tnities are being forced out of their houses; why not do the same to theme houses, so it does not seem to be an attack solely on the Grt;ek System,. but a change to all Jiving arrangements on campus? Theme houses are residential co-ed living and social spac<';s that open their houses up to the whole campus commupity. Everyone has the opportunity to live in these houses, Greeks and independents. That is the kind of social atmosphere that Union is trying to expand upon with their plaps for the House System. Yet, the House System is a mandatory membership plan for the entire campus, that would involve more diversity and segregation among students. The process of membership also needs to be taken into consider- ation. Students will randomly be assigned a house before they ar- rive at school. One of the concerns is what if you don't like the house to which you are assigned or don't feel comfortable with others asso- ciated with the house? ln some regards, this kind of forced inte- gration could be more harmful than helpful. Shouldn't . students get the tight to choose what house they want to devote their time to? It is hatd to: make the transition from high school friends to making col- lege friends, and it may be even harder to be split yet again into a housing system. And that raises the question of Hving arrange- ments. Students may not want to live in a house where most of their friends aren't members. \The av- erage house membership wi11 be 165, but could range from 120 to 240 depending on the building they occupy.\ rsn 't this going to create smaller organizations within campus and social life that segre- gate Union's diversity even more? A massiv-e amount of people is hard to organize. Realistically, all the members will pot be as active as a select few who want to get involved. Ultimately, the members of the house, living in the house will have the most influence over what kind of events will take place on any given day. And what about security is- sues? Every member of a house is granted twenty·four hour access to that building. The new card ac- cess will allow students ftee rein in a number of different buildings. It will be.mo~ difficult to control theft and larceny if such a large amount of students are given the opportu- nity to use such spaces. A $120 fee is a:lso being consid- ered, in order for each house 'to have their own budget for dinners, formals, parties and events. Two hundred forty people will be put- ting money into the budget for their affiliated house. A non-active ¢ember would argue that fee, if he or she did not wish to participate in house events. TheSe funds are monitored by the house govern- ment, wltich is individually modi- fied to fit each house. The idea behind the House System is to ere .. ate equal housing and access to social $pace,. but if students are automatica11y assigned housing, and :rpay not have the ~pportunity to live in th~t house, how does that create equal housing? . The U2K report recotrnnends \a casual, attractive drop-in space open during the day for faculty and students to meet, read, and relax.\ rn essence, more spaces like Old Chapel. Without constructing new buildings on campus, renovate North Colonnade and expand Old Chapel. Converting the current bookstpre into a pub/night dub and coffeehouse and juice bar will enhance more social options on campus: for students. But having twelve houses open up and hold- ing different events may spread out the campus community, segregat- ing students into smaller groups. The proposed \party barn\ sounds like a good plan, but stu- dents are skeptical of how it will work. Students \party hop\ for a change of scenery and atmo- Sphere. The party bam would be just a big room with minor changes for each party. Other colleges like Union have gone ahead and set Up a venue for events like this, and it has not been as successful as ad- ministrat<>rs would like to see. Is the U2K report too optimistic in its ideas? Four questions lingered in the minds of committee member~: \'Should Greek organizations continue to be selective? Should Greek organizations continue to be single-sex? Should Greek organizations continue to be residential? Should Greek organizations continue to have pledging'?\ The U2K report states, \The ioss of any one of these four would resttlt in a failure to preserve a Greek tradition at Union.\ That's why the four characteristics ~e to remain optional because it defines the Greek system. The Committee's number one principle outlined in the report is to disassociate the Greek system from engaging in regressive activi- ties such as hazing and alcohol abuse. Changes to rush, pledging, and hazing are mentioned in the report. There is a need for a zero· tolerance policy on the issue of hazing. The alcohol poliCy will be made universal throughout the Housing System and the Greek System under policies made by subcommittees of the U2K Steer- ing Committee. Sophomore Rush has already been implemented and now it is the waiting period, to see how smooth the change will be. in the fall. Th¢ hazing policy also addresses athletic teams that c()n- duct any form ofhazill:gto its mem- bers. Union does not want to have to address a situation similar to that ofthe UVM Men's Hockey Team earlier this year. Another key principle brought up· by the committee is faculty involvement. Apathy not only lies among the student body, but there is a definite lack of faculty/stl!dent i!lteraction. Faculty needs to participate in more campus life ~;:vents, and applaud the ~;tdministration for re~ogn-izing that issue and ~upporting faculty to ·m~et this goal. In the introd!lCt<lry paragraph of \Proposal for the Future of Greek Life,\ the rep<>rt indicates that many faculty and administrators hoped that ·~all residential groups would be required to go co-educational or that the Greek system would be moved off .campus of abolished.\ Was this report Pllblished to feed t() the desires of faculty a11d administratOrs? The House System will have a stronger impact on. the 21 00 students (independents and Greeks) wilo will be living on Union's campus than it will on the faculty and administrators that work here. The House S:rstem proposes that aJI faculty be affillated with one .of the twelve houses. That way, students and faculty will feel a- sense ()f belonging on campus. To be a part of Union College is to have a sense of belonging, and it is sad that faculty members don't fee-l cO'mfortable around students .otLtside of the classroom. The report indicates that n()ne of th.e changes will take place until the fal1 of2004. Yes, all current sttt- dents will have graduated and wiiJ 11ot experience the House System, but that doesn't mean that we should riot voice our opinions of the proposaL Everyone. has a voice, and the U2K Committee en- courages POSITIVE student input. President Hull is awaiting reaction from the student body and w.ill not take any fonnal action until Octo~ bet 2000. Yet, if the student body does not embrace U2K, President HuH will be forced ab9lish the Greek System. Some students on campus have no stance on the issue, because their excuse is that they will not be here to see the change. Does that mean that we should deprive fu- ture undergraduates the right to experience a rich tr;ldition of Greek organization? The committee wants to pre- serve the 175-year Greek System by giving every student the chance to participate in some ofthe \most valued parts of Greek tire.\ Every student at Union College is given the opportunity to join a Greek organization. Thirty-eight percent of the s~udent body chooses this option, while the rest apply to theme houses or live as independents. Looking back, Union has evolved from an all-male Greek dominated, highly respected insti- tution of higher learning. Slowly it . has transformed into to co-educa- tional school and maintained its strong academic programs and Greek system. It seems very over- whelming for Union College to ef- fectively ratify so much change so quickly, considering the Trimester/ Semester debate is also a contro- versial issue <>n the minds of fac- ulty and students. If the bulk of the U2K report is implemented, Union College will survive, yet again; just with a different twist on campus life. Students Fear Change Dear Students, Oil the brink of amazing changes . tQ this college, I am ready to leave this institution. Union has brought so much opportunizy to my life; t t ha.s given me the chance to create so many amazing things. Now,a report that has been deemed to lle of a magnitude unparalleled in the past twenty years of Union's his- tory has irked the student body in most cases. Of course~ it is the U2Kreport that lam talking about; an ensemble of ideology and de- .mand. It has asked our student booy to question so much of our status quo. I do not support the report, nor do I throw aJJ,y distinct enthusiasm to its birth and the committee's birth. But, there is . something that lurks behind all of tile politics and idle talk concern- ing this U2K thing. It is the ever- present fear in the eyes of stu- dents, a fear of change. The sta- tus quo has brought most of ()lll' students contentment and happi- ness. The seniors show it when tlley talk of next year, a year of lUi- certainty for many of them. TI:tey are afraid of change. I wilJ notal- low my fears to overcome my pas- sion and foresight. I would hope the same of this talented student body. After all, you are the con- tingency that has allowed for me to be a part .of the creation of a successfulWinterCarnival, afabu- lous improv group, and this week's Mountebanks production, You Can 't Take It With You .. You Can 't Take It With You is aplaythathas brought together fourteen differ• ent students, from various campus backgrounds~ to create what many would consider one the funniest productions .a student group has ever put on. ·Be confident with your abilities Union. You will handle tomorrow with intelligence and creativity. If you trust your- selves, as individuals, there can be no change to this college that will stifle your abilities. I have gained a trust in my abilities, so I amnotafraidtoleave Union. I am ready, and excited, for what ever is come. Just a plain old Union student, Michael Winn

Taiwan Stands up to Chinese Demands Israeli Troops Pull out of Southern Lebanon ------------------------- by Neil Routman Staff Writer There is one comer of the world that ardent world news fanatics should pay particular attention to in the upcoming months of sum- mer. The world's comer in the Far East has experienced a number of trade negotiations and national electwns. The matriculation ofTai- wanese President Chen Shibian and Vice-President Annette Lu has yielded heated debate between the democratic nation and its motherland's communist govern- ment. As expected, the reaction to the pro-mdependent nationalist brought about a negative reaction from Mainland('hma. The Chinese government has recently threat- ened to take milital)' action against what they call the \rogue prov- Ince.\ President Chen \s reaction to Chma 's complaints was brushed off. Citing an unending string of appeasement. \'They would only be satisfied ifTaiwan w~re returned to them !Jke Hong Kong and Macau. And even so. they still might not be satisfied.\ Chen said. Chen began his inaugural speech citing the democratic values, which he was elected to uphold. \On the eve of the Twenty-First Century, the people of Taiwan have com- pleted a historic alternation of po- litical parties in power. This is not only the first of its kind in the his- tory of the Republic of China, but also an epochal landmark for Chi- nese communities around the world. Taiwan has not only set a new model for the Asian experi- ence of democracy, but has also added a moving example to the third wave of democracy the world over.\ Chen went on to compare Taiwan's struggle to one of demo- cratic freedom verses other nation's suppressive notions. Tai- wan has been independent from China now for over fifty years. Chen declared that the longev- ity is a victory for democracy. \Dear compatriots, let's always re- member this moment; let's always remember to value and feel grati- tude for it, because the fruits of de- mocracy did not come out of the blue. It was realized by going through many perils and dangers, and by experiencing countless hardships. If not for the fearless sacrifice of our democratic fore- bears, if not for the unswerving faith of the tens of millions ofTai- wanese people in freedom and de- mocracy. we could not possibly be standing on our beloved land to- day and celebrate a glorious occa- sion that belongs to all the people.\ Chen continued to clash sabers with Mainland China; he cited the role of government and its respon- sibility to the general will. \The spirit of a government for all people lies in the fact that the government exists for the people. The people are the masters and shareholders of the state. The gov- ernment should rule on the basis of majority public opinion. The in- terests of the people are absolutely above those of any political party or individual.\ Of course, the possibility of a full-scale military clash is not out of the question. Chen has gone on the record stating that Taiwan will not engage in military <:onflict un- less Mainland China's army in- vades Taiwan. China has been mucl1 more am- biguous in its statements concern- ing an upcoming conflict. The army has practices military exercises near the Taiwanese coastlines, yet it has never invaded. There were no mili- tary exercises during the inaugura- tion ceremony last week. Chen closed his speech declar- ing , \Long live freeclom and de- mocracy: long live the people of Taiwan!\ With this declaration Chen made clear that the small na- tion continues to stand up to its motherland superpower nation. It cannot continue to count of Ameri- can and western military support in the future, however, because of increased trade and negotiations. With new ties to China, America will be less likely to defend Taiwan simply because of its form of gov- ernment. Taiwan continues to stand; however it has in recent years stood with fewer and fewer company. Unfortunately, this alien- ation, can only instigate military conflicts between the Asian na- tions. Stephen Nemeth World News Editor Muslim guerillas poured into Southern Lebanon on Tuesday, celebrating the withdrawal of Is- raeli troops a day earlier and the end oflsrael's security zone setup in Southern Lebanon. Lebanese citizens who had lived in the \security zone\ some since the zone was established eighteen years ago, showered rose petals and rice on the incoming Hezbollah guerillas, shouted Pro-Hezbollah slogans, and denounced the Israeli govenunent. The withdrawal of Israeli troops did not necessarily mean an end to hostilities as fighting continued on the border between Israeli forces and Muslim rebels, includ- ing a firefight at the Metulla bor- der crossing. In this battle a hidden gunman in an abandoned building fought with Israeli soldiers sending Leba- nese citizens scurrying for cover. The withdrawal of soldiers ful- filled a campaign promise ofisraeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to end the occupation of Southern Leba- non. The security zone was created in the 1980s to prevent attacks on Northern Israel from guerilla at- tacks <>ut of Southern Lebanon. Since the creation of the zone, over 900 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the region. \This 18-year tragedy is over,\ Barak said after the withdrawal was authorized. The Prime Minister had previously set a July 7 deadline for the pullout. The withdrawal and the disinte- gration of the Israeli-allied S()uth Lebanese Army sent waves offear into Northern Israel sending many citizens into bomb-shelters, fearing attacks by guerillas. As the Israelis withdrew their army, which Barak said would take ten days, SLA members ~ban­ cloned their posts, leaving weap- ons, equipment and bases fDr the advancing guerillas. Hundreds of these members - considered traitors by the Leba- nese govemment fled for tile Is- raeli border under fear of reprisal by guerillas and government forces. \I am afi·aid,\ said Eitan Davidi, director of a cooperative farming community on the border. \'11 is said that the Israeli army is the strongest in the Middle East, and it just can't be that in 2000 it will be in the back and we will be OJJ the front line.\ But Shoshannah Gree11berg, whose son Tzahi died four months ago at an Israeli outpost in tlhe se· curity zone. stated it best when she said she was \in favor of a with- drawal\ and spoke of the heartbr~ak caused by the occupation. \I am in favorof(the army} p-ro· tecting us from our area, not fr()m beyond the border,\ she said. \Eighteen years is a long time.

South Korea: The Summit, a New Prime Minister and T -shirts by Philip Cho Staff Writer President Kim Dae-jung, in a move to boost his political base named a conservative party leader to head his Cabinet. Lee Han-dong, a 65 year old bead of the United Liberal Demo- crats, was appointed after subse- <!Uent meetings held with presiden- 1ial aides. Lee will be succeeding Park Tae- joon who resigned after a tax vasion scandal. This scandal re- sulted in a court ruling punishing Park Tae-joon for hiding his prop- erties from 1981 to 1993 to avoid ta:xes when he was chainnan of the now defunct Democratic Liberal Party. Kwang-keun (a spokesman for the opposition Grand National Party) said, \The incident displays the m'iual hazards of this regime. Theruling camp tnust take special measures to restore its morality.\ Cries by opposition parties and civic groups calling for Park to re- sign and issue a public apology fol- lowing the court's ruling that he had avoided paying taxes, forced Park to eventually resign. The Citizens Action Network group said, \Prime Minister Park; s bid to conceal his properties for taxevas:ion cannot be tolerated on moral gn'ounds, although he has no legal responsibilities.\ Forrme:t Prime Minister Park made a statement saying, \I am sorry to thego~ernment and nation that my personarl moral issue has caused conttmversy.\· CoiTUlption allegations against past governments have once again resurfaced.

However, it is expected that the NatiomaJ Assembly will approve of the aptpoi:ntinent. Four. indepen- dent legislators joined Kin:i:;s Mil- lenniu.fll.Democratic Party, which contriiD11ted to its swelling strength in the t:micamerallegislature t() 119 seats. Seventeen United Demo- crats members, as well as a few pro- government independents will en- dorse Lee's appointment. The appointment of Lee signa1s a renewed partnership between Kim's ruling party and the United Liberal Democrats. The coalition of the parties broke up just before parliamentary electi-ons, which led to a Grand National Party victory in the polls. Kim's party and the United Lib- eral Democrats have not yet an- nounced their revival of the coali- tion that halted in April. Lee's appointment indicates that the two parties will become closer once again. The GNP is clearly against Lee's appointment. Relations between the new prime minister and the GNP are poor be- cause he was the head of the GNP until he quit in January. The GNP party sees h:il)l as a defector. A member of the GNP party said, 'We cannot cooperate to endorse the new prime minister. It is an act of betrayal to the people who chose our party the largest parliamentary group in April elections.\ While all this is going on, the South Korean. government under the leadership ofPresident Kim are preparing for the upcoming sum- mit. It is hard to see if the appoint- ment of the new prime minister will affect taJks between the two sides. South Korea and North Korea reached full agreement on the agenda and other details for a sum- mit of their leaders in June. It was agreed that the agenda for the sum- mit would be broadly worded. The agenda would call for self- reliance, peace and national unity. South Korea has dropped its pro- posal for a specific agenda listing matters such as economic aid to the North. South Korea also agreed to send a delegation of130 officials as well as a fifty member press corps. North Korea had asked that the number ofSouth Korean journal- ists be halved. North Korea in return agreed to allow South Korean journalists to hold live television broadcasts from Pyongyang. The agreement also stipulated that there will be no markings or signs at the meeting site or confer- encerooms. This means there will be no dis- play of national flags or symbols. This measure taken to avoid ideo- logical friction. Also, national songs of the two Koreas will not be used during the summit. The main issues that South Ko- rea will try to address in the sum- mit are economic cooperation and reunions of separated family mem- bers. North Korea will probably criticize the U.S. military presence in South Korea, as well as the South's anticommunist national se- curity taws. South Korean officials feel that North Korea was driven to agree to the suminit for economic rea- sons. On a lighter note, T -shirts of President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il are now available in South Korea. The new T-sltirts identify the two Korean leaders by their En- glish initials- Mr. DJ and Mr. n. One shirt depicts South Korean President KimDae-jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong II fly to- gether wearing matching Super- man costumes. Another shows them riding a tricycle together, smil- ing like children. In the past, displays like this would have been seen as unthink- able. But, it is clear that the moods have changed amidst the upcom- ing summit in June. Communist ac- tivity is strictly banned in South Korea and eve11 possession of Marxist literature is punishable by long prison tenns. One Justice Ministry official said of the shirts, \While it could be interpreted as violating the country's national security law, it may be difficult to punish anyone because of the 11ew conciliatory mood.\ It will be interesting to see how the summit will play out, and how the new appointment of the prime minister will effect the summits that will play out in mid-June.

Condusions drawn from such discussion were then cornsidered in relation to Germany's decision to join with the newly created Eu- ropean currency, the Euro and to what exientGermanywill participate in the Eruopean Union. The t:lrree professors to speak at the conference were Brian Ladd a former Professor atRPI and current history professor at SUNY Albany, Elisabetb.

In addition, the history of Ger- many -was irrevocably tainted by the Na:zi regime through its cease- lessca:m.paigns of genocide, to the Jewisll people, as well as general terrorli:actics. F o1loY'Ving the fall of Germany at the coacl11sion ofWorld War II, fue natio11 -vr,as divided along the newly emeJ.l5i:ngCold War lines. GermatJ.y wast() lJe split into the Federal Re· publicofGennany (West Germany) and the German Democratic Re- publi<: (East Germany). Th11s, a country that had been unifieli s.ince the last quarter of tile ninetee11ih century had once again been SJlli!. As the two countries remained split for nearly half a cen- tury, o llvious social and political differences emerged. At present, the newly reunited country must face this .difficult past and looks at the future with hopeful uncertanty. Professor Egetemeyr picked up where Professor Ladd left off speaking about contemporary Ger- man politics. In essence, her analy- sisrevealed that while Germany is physically a united country, ideol- ogy and so-called, ••inner unity\ re- main as elusive as ever before. The issue addressed by the pro- fessor, revolved around the con- cept of political culture. Political culture is define<i as the \subjec- tive orientation to politics.\ Basi- cally, what that boi1s down to is that people acclimate themselves to the type of government and politics they are used to living under. This issue becomes tangled when one looks at the German Republic of today versus the present day United States. Germany, in a political light has no such long standing traditions as does the U.S. In fact, due to Communist takeover of East Ger- many, the two peoples have devel- oped not only a skeptisicm of de- mocracy but a skepticism of which type of democracy the country should be governed by. In general, west Germans favor a more liberal demccracy whereas East Germans favor a more social- ist democracy. Of more concern is that such a split in belief is that of west Ger- mans only six1y pe:rcent are satis- fied with the function.ing of democ- racy in Germany. East Germans are even less pleased with the current democracy, pollillgan thirty-eight percent approval rate. Based on these continuing po- litical differences, the question that must be raised is \'How in these times of unresolved political tur- moil, in a nation still trying to de- fme its character and identy, what will Germany's future be now that it a part of the Euro community. [n short, is a Euro-Germany once again deteriorating the character of a nation that will have to curtaii a measure of its soverignty and give in to the greater economic good of the European community? Finally, Professor Eshragh Motahar answered this questi()n. To give backgrmmd, the Euro is a currency that first entered into ex.- istence on January 1, 1999. :By January, 2002, Euro notes and coins will be introduced. The last phase, set for no later than July of 2002, cails for the removal of all national currency's from Euro na- tions. The Euro marks yet another step in continuing European unifica- tion. Motivation for such unifica- tion stems from the ashes ofW orld War II. Immediately following the war, in 1949, the Council ofEu.r()pe was set up. Other pan-Europe.an organizations were set up through- outthe 1950's as well. By 1970 however, a system of fixed exchange rates that incladed forty-four countries, known as the Breton Woods regime (created in 1944) had effectively collapsed. In response, the 1967 created or- ganization, the European Conunu- nity, asked Prime Minister Pierre Werner of Luxembourg to evaLu- ate the feasibility of a united Euro- pean currency. The Werner Report ( 1970) stated that it was in fact feasible to crea:te a united European currency. In 1979, the European Monetary Sys- tem (EMS) was created. The organization limited the de- gree in which current European currency's could fluctuate in valtte. In short, European currency~s were being brought closer together. By the 1990's, planning was in its fmal stages. Professor Motahar pointed out both advantages and disadvan- tages for joining with the Euro. The two largest disadvantages noted were a general loss of national sov- ereignty and that the value of the Euro, since its inception in Janu- ary of 1999, has lost twenty per- cent of its value. In terms of sovereignty, Gennany as well as the other ten countries currently involved with Euro will have to abandon their individual power in dealin.g with both mon- etary policy and fiscal policy. For example, if Germany experi- ences inflation, the government will no longer be able to increase the money supply in order to off set such an event Further, Ger- man companies now must contend with higher operating costs as the value of the Euro has dropped twenty percent as of May 16. On the flip side, Motahar cites lowered transaction costs between European countries due to elimi- nated foriegn exchange fluctua- tions, consumer price reductions and increased political unity as positives that should make the Euro an enticing offer to not only Germany but to any nation of Eu- rope. In conclusion, Professor Motahar, as well as the other guests speaking at Union felt that despite an agonizing past, a politi- cally tumultuous present and an economically uncertain future, that Germany is headed in the right di- rection and that through. global and European assistance, the .. new Germany\ wil1 be better defmed in the years to come and become a more comfortable contributor to the European community.

Lee will be succeeding Park Tae- joon w 11 o resigned after a tax vasion scandal This scandal re- sulted in a court ruling punishing Park Tae-joon for hiding his prop- erties fr<Jrn 1981 to 1993 to avoid taxes when he was chairman of the now defunct Democratic Liberal Party. Kwang-lceun (a spokesman for the opp~:>sition Grand National Party) said, \The incident displays the moral hazards of this regime. Theruling camp must take special measures to restore its morality.\ Cries hy opposition parties and civic groups calling for Park to re- sign and issue a public apology fol- lowing tl1e court's ruling that he had avoided paying taxes, forced Park to evenrually resign. The Citizens Action Network group said, \Prime Minister Park's bid to conceal his properties for taxevasi()n cannot be tolerated on mora1gr()unds, although he has n<J legal resiJonsibilities.\ FonneT Prime Minister Park made a statement saying, \I am sorry t<J the govremment and nation that my pers<>n:al moral issue has caused con tr<Jwersy.\ Carruption allegations against past go vernrnents have once again resurfa (ed. This has caused pub- lic calls for higher ethical stall· dards fl()r public office holders. Lee t;;'Jill be the third prime minis- ter to serve in the Kim government which \;'/8S inaugurated in the early part ()£1998. Lee' s appointment will be <>f cours.e subject to approval by the Nati<>n Assembly. The main op- positioll to this new move :will be the Gra11.d Nation Party who has 133 <>fth.e 273 seats. Ho-wever, it is expected that the National Assembly will approve <>f the aJlp()intment. Four indepen- dent 1 egi~lators joined Kim's Mil- lenniurm Democratic Party, whiclt contribll!ted to its swelling strength in the trnicamerallegislature to 119 seats. Seventeen United Dem()- crats members, as well as a few pr()- government independents will en.- dorse Lee's appointment. Thea~pointment ofLee signals a ren e'ioVed partnership between Kim'sruJingparty and the United Liberal Democrats. The coalition of the parties broke up just before parliamentary elections, which led to a Grand National Party victory in the polls. Kim's party and the United Lib- eral Democrats have not yet an- nounced their revival of the coali- tion that halted in April. Lee's appointment indicates that the two parties will become closer once agam. The GNP is clearly against Lee's appointment. Relations between the new prime minister and the GNP are poor be- cause he was the head of the GNP until he quit in Jmuary. The GNP party sees him as a defector. A memberoftheGNP party said, \We cannot cooperate to endorse the new prime minister. It is an act of betrayal to the people who chose our party the largest parliamentary group in April elections.\ While all this is going on, the South Korean government under the leadership ofP:t:esident Kim are preparing for the apcoming sum- mit. It is hard to see if the appoint- ment of the new prime minister will affect talks between the two sides. South Korea and North Korea reached full agreement on the agenda and otherdetails for a sum- mit of their leaders in June. It was agreed that the agenda for the sum- mit would be broadly worded. The agenda would call for self- reliance, peace and national unity. South Korea has dropped its pro- posal for a specific agenda listil1g matters such as economic aid to the North. South Korea also agreed to send a delegation ofl30 officials as well as a fifty member press corps. North Korea had asked that the number of South Korean journal- ists be halved. North Korea in return agreed to allow South Korean journalists to hold live television broadcasts from Pyongyang. The agreement also stipulated that there will be no markings or signs at the meeting site or confer- encerooms. This means there will be no dis- play of national flags or symbols. This measure taken to avoid ideo- logical friction. Also, national songs of the two Koreas will not be used during the summit. The main issues that South Ko- rea will try to address in the sum- mit are economic cooperation and reunions of separated family mem- bers. North Korea will probably criticize the U.S. military presence in South Korea, as well 1\S tile South's anticommunist national se- curity laws. South Korean officials feel that North Korea was driven to agree to the summit for economic rea- sons. On a lighter note, T-shirts of President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il are now available in South Korea. The new T-shirts identify the two Korean leaders by their En- glish initials - Mr. DJ and Mr. JI. One shirt depicts South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong II fly to- gether wearing matching Super- man costumes. Another shows them riding a tricycle together, smil- ing like children. In the past, displays like this would have been seen as unthink- able. But, it is clear that the moods have changed amidst the upcom- ing summit in June. Commwtist ac- tivity is strictly banned in South Korea and even possession of Marxist literature is punishable by long prison terms. One Justice Ministry official said of the shirts, \While it could be interpreted as violating the country's national security law, it may be difficult to punish anyone because of the new conciliatory mood.\ It will be interesting to see how the summit will play out, and how the new appointment of the prime minister will effect the summits thai will play out in rnid-Jw1e.

i i . by Brian Kern StqjfWriter I've attempted to refrain from discussing poli~cal matters this entire year. I haven't written ex~ tertsively about the calendar de- bate, or about the Greek system, or anything else. Instead I've used my article as a way to cheer people up after they read about some of the other unpleasant things happeniJ:lg. The time to remain silent has come to an end. I feel thaf: I must express some · views ():IJ. the topic at hand: · U2K. First off, do any of you out · there kn<lw what other college fraternity systems are like? rm s~ue everyone has at least a · small idea based on what their friends from other schools • have told them. Witho:ut a • doubt, there is almost nothing • like our system at any other school. I've looked into other schools in New York, Massa- chusetts~ New Hampshire, and New Jersey, among others. Nc>- where do they have a Greek system. as extensive as ours. The main difference is of course the ho'using. . Fraterni- ties at olher schools do not have on campus housing. Instead, fra- ternities have their own houses off campus. The problem with that here wonld be that ResLife prob· , ably wo~dn 't le~ Greeks live iil off campus housing. Also,. at other schools the Greeks are not \ex- pected\ to provide entertainment on campus as they are here. Let's face it, if the school did not want Greeks t{) dominate so much then the best thing they could do would be to undermine them by provid- ing huge amounts of activities which are better than those pro- videdby the Greek system. How- ever, they don't do that. Instead, they s'imply want to destroy the system which has supported much of ou:r social lives for so long. Whether or not it will better the school, and whether or not you ]ike Greeks QI the system, 4esttoying the system simply is not the right thing to due. What about that new House System? I will tell you all now that this is doomed to fail. As far as I'm concerned, this is the rnostri- diculo1!s thing I've ever read!. Ba- sically, ResLife will prevent friel:lds from living or doing things to- gether~ ·What are freshmen s11pposed to do? Search out members ·of 1he house they belong to? I hate to say it, hut their attempts to cre:ate more diversity will only up~et people. Perhaps it's a shame that people like to hang out witb. oth- ers wh<i are like themselves.

Features by Brian Kern Staff Writer I've attempted to refrain from discussing political matters this entire year. I haven't written ex- tensively aheut the calendar de- bate, or abaut the Greek system, or anything else. Instead I've used my article as a way to cheer people up after they read about some of the other unpleasant things happening. The time to remain silent has come to an end. I feel that I must express some views on the topic at hand: U2K First off, do any of you out there know what other co liege fraternity systems are like? I'm sure everyene has at least a small idea based on. what their friends frem other schools have told them. Without a doubt, there is almost n<Jthing like our system at any other school. I've looked into other schools in New York, Massa- chusetts, New Hampshire, and New Jersey, among others. No- where do they have a Greek system as extensive as ours. The main difference is of course the housing. Fraterni- ties at other schools do not have on campus. housing. Instead, fra- ternities have their own bouses off campus. The problern with that here would be that ResLife prob- ablywouldn'tletGreeks live in off campus housing. Also, at other schools the Greeks are not \ex- pected\ to provide entertainment on campus as they are here. Let's face it, if the school did not want Greeks to dominate so much then the best thing they could do would be to undermine them by provid- ing huge amounts of activities which are better than tbose pro- vided by tile Greek system. How- ever, they don't do that. Instead, they simply want to destroy the system which has supported much of our social lives for so long. Whether or not it will better the school, and whether or not you like Greeks or the system, destroying the system simply is not ili.e right thing to due. What about that new House System? I will tell you all now that this is doomed to fail. As far as I'm concerned, this is the most ri- diculous thing I've ever read. Ba- sically, ResLife will prevent friends from living or doing things to- gether. What are freshmen supposed to do? Search out members of the house they belong to? I hate to say it, but their attempts to create more diversity will only upset people. Perhaps it's a shame that people like to hang out with oth- ers who are like themselves. How- ever, all you have to do is open up an intro Psychology book to learn that this is basic human nature.

Miller Scie1zce a11d Technology Editor During the last few months there hasbeenamajorpush by advertis- ing agencies and autom9tive manufacturers toward more envi.., rolllllentally safe cars. There are threevarieties of these env:ironmen- tally safe or \zero emissions\ au- tomobiles available for public pur- chase. The three types.of cars are the gas,..electric hybdds, the fuel cellpoweredorhybrid cars and the pure electric vehicles (EV). Wlty all of a sudden has there been this large push by the major automol;Jj:le manufactures? There are twomaj.or reasons for this trend: cars.are largerlyresponsible for the . generation of atmospheric pollu- tion and major contribut()rs to tht; Greenhouse Effect. Secondly,. pe- troleu:tn, the main element of gaso- line, is a finite (>r limitedYesource on thlsplartet. In the years to come petroleum deposits will become harder to locate and harness. Ad- ditionalJ,y, the number of automo ... biles on the road will no doubt con- tinue to increase, and with the di- minished supply .of petroleum, the price of gasoline will continue to rise astronomically. The only solution to these prob- lems is theremodeling of our modes of transportation. However, this redesigning will not be widely ac- cepted if the creature comforts and the. performance quality of the ve- hicles are decreased. What do most of us reqqire from our cars? Some say '\four tires, an engine and a steering wheel are good enough to get you there.\ Honestly, we re- quired comfortable and. spacious seating for ourselves and our pas- sengers, good acceleration rates, adescenttop'speed, a radio,. safety feature and ofcourse four tires, an engine and a steering wheel. To be marketal?le, these environmentally safe cars have been engineered to fee land drive like any nonnal car. . The only noticab le difference will be~ absence of the engine noise. With our best interests and prof~ its in mind, almost every automo- bile manufacturer has an environ- mentally safe car either in design or in production. Some hybrids presently or soon to be on the :tnar· ket are: DaitnlerChrysler's Dodge ESX3 which gets about 70 mpg (miles per gallon) on a gas-electric drivetrain. The Ford Motor Com-., pany has the Prodigy~. art abu:n.in.um framedhybridwbich also achieves 10 mpg. General Motors (GM) ~s the Precept. this futuristically de- signed automobile gets an average of 80 mpg by using a completely electrical driven front end and a hybrid rear drive. GM designers estimate that jf a fuel cell were to be substituted forthe presmt elec- trical system the car could travel up to 100 mpg. American automotive compa- nies are not the only envi.J:onmen~ tally safe car producers. Major competitors in both. Japan and Ger~ many have alsD released similar vehicles. The Honda Insight prom-· ises 70 mpg and can be purchased at any local Honda dealer for the reasonableprice of $19,320. Addi- tionally Toyota has put their Prius on the marketfor$20,450, Toyota boasts 300,000 vehicles presently on the road in both the US and Ja- pan. Most hybrids run using a simi- lar system to the GM Precept. The motor running off of the batteries is the main driving force behind the car's movement. In most cases, a diesel engine kicks in to provide a little extra power for higher acceleration rates and to recharge the batteries when neccessary. Most hybrids boast an acceleration rate of zero to sixty in less than ten seconds. Another commonly applied technology in these vehicles is the use of mo- tors as power generators in the braking systems. Using the fric- tion created by the application of the brake~, these motors store ex- <tra power which is normally lost inmost vehicle on the road today. This past year major automotive compani.es introduced to the mar- kettheworld's first affordable gas- electric hybrid car. From the de- scriptions ofthese vehicles above you may want to know why none ofthese automobiles are fuel cell hybrids. Traditionally~ fuel cells have been too large to squeeze in- side a car, however recent devel- opments have allowed these min- iature power plants to safely fit in the cars. So the major reason that fuel cells are not used within pres- ently marketable hybrid cars is their cost. On average these fuel cells will cost $4,500. This price is ago()d $1500 higher than the cost of most internal combustion en- gines presently used in the auto- motive industry. Although hybrids are environ- mentally safe and considered zero emission producers by the gov- ernment, these cats do in factpro- toxins. The only cars which actu- Both Honda and GM marketed EV ally do not produce any emissions cars in the recent past, but suffered at all are the EVs.

The electric vehicle is not a recent development. In fact, EV s have been around for over 100 years. In Vermont, Thomas Davenport invented the first electric motor in the 1830s and the first Lead Acid battery was invented a few years later. In Scotland, Robert Anderson made the first EV in 1939. The first American EV, a tricycle, was invented in 1890 by Andrew Riker and the fleet of EV s was inveted by engineers Pedro Salam and Henry Morris in the early 1900s. duce a small amount of gaseous F~~~=~~~~,..,...~~~~~...,......-._....,.,.......,...,____,.,'\\'=\'~..

Arts & EnteJ;tainment Battlefield Earth: A Strong Book and a Weak Movie by Eugene Schultz Staff Write I\ When the author L. Ron Hubbard is mentioned today, most people think of him as the author of the self-help book Dianetics, and oth.ers think of him as the founderof the cult/religiml known as Scie!ltology. Yet most people today do not know that between the year!; 1930 and 1982, L. Ron Hubbard was the author of more than fifteen New YorkTimes Best Sellers. One of these best sellers, Battlejiefil Earth,. since it first pub- lication in 1980, has .gained a cult status thatrivals that of Stars Wars and Douglas Adams' Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. Battlefield Earth tells the story of an ea11h so fully devastated af- ter a thousand years of Psychlo rule (an alien race of intergalactic miners), that barely 35.,000 human beings remain. Among those sur- viving h11mans is the wonderfully courageous Jonnie Goodboy Tyler. Jonnie emerges from what is effec- tively a tribal community among the Rocky Mountains, and he nonetheless proves more than a match for the inestimably cruel and technologically advanced Psychlos who.appearintwo forms. The vicious Terl and the outcast Ker are just two of the many ex- amples. Thus, the primary theme as reit- erated in variousways through pre- liminary notes: the indomitable spirit of man prevailing over those who mistakenly regard him as an animal. One finds the whole Psychlo history among notes that are in the book. The notes include chronicles of interplanetary conquest, a dis- course on galactic diplomacy and much more concerning the rampag- ing Psychics. Transcending even the power of the Psychlos is a race of intergalactic bankers (literal de- scendants of sharks), with a press- ing lien on the entirety of earth, in- cluding existing resources; future proceeds from mineral exploitation, and even the destiny of future populations. If utterly uncon- cerned as to the fate of those on the balance sheets, the indiffer- ence is not malicious. Merely, \This is alljustroutine. Ordinaryhanking business.\' Jonnie and the handful of ;remaining humans must deal with all ofthesedifferent species of aliens as they try and take over the earth. With 1050 pages, the length of Battlefield .earth allows for some very nic.e descriptive paragraphs. One of the best descriptions is the one of the city ofDenver. Hubbard does a masterful job painting the picture of a rotting, decaying dty. The effect that it has on tb.e main character who has been primarily liv- ing in a St-one Age village is amaz .. ing. Every little thing thathe sees is a wonder; If the book had one draw back, I would have to say that itwould have to be the ending. After writing over 1000 page~, it seems to me that Mr. Hubbard s·uf\fer.ed from creative fa• tigue. The encling is very weak, and I wish that I c9uld tell you how the book ends, but then no one would read it. H()Wev:er, it just seems that for all the effort that he put into the book, that the enQing would have had just as much punch as the rest of the book l waited untili was completely done with the;book before I went to see the movie :ve.rsion of Battlefield Earth. Bringi11,g Battlefield Earth to the big screen has been a dream of John Travolta's for a long time, and comcidentally, Mr. Travolta is a Scientologist, the teligion that L. Ron Hul>bard started. One would think that with the papularity of the book and today's teclmology the movie would be a good on~. However, that is l'lot the case, with this movie bemgso bad it is very hard to decide where I should startrip- ping it apart .. But let's begin with the cast. /Jattlefield Earth stars John Tra·volta (Pulp Fiction, Get Shorty, & Phenomenon) who plays Terl, Barry Pepper (the bible quoting sniper from Saving Pri- vate Ryan), plays Jonnie Goodboy Taylor, and Forest Whitaker (The Crying Game} is a character named Ker, and the movie is directed by Roger Chris~ tian. The cast and director are not bad, however the. interpretation is horrible. Ker is completely Wt:ong, in ·the book he is smaller than Terl and not as cruel. Yet in the movie I ·did not see this which is an important fact in the book, The movie also cut out a lot of what I figured to be the essentials ofthe book as well. Jollllie's. inter- action with the Scots is played down and so is his feeling of help- lessness. l did like. the s:pecial ef- fects, but in this day an,d age, spe- cial effects driven films are a dime a.dozen. Overall, this movie might be the worst in the last decade if not in the lastcentury. It was awful, and I regret paying eight dollars and seventy-five cents to see it. I was disappointed, because the book was a well written piece of science fiction, yet the movie was not even worth watching when it . fOmesoutonHBO inthenextyear or two. Hopefully, some where down the line some other director will give Baulefield Earth aD.other try. For now I wouldj.ustread the book and stay as far away fonn the movie as possible. I Really Miss Guns N' Roses Discover Office Space by Dan Centi A&EEditor The year was 1987, andthemu- sic industry was flooded with wa- tered down, would be, rock bands and teen.ybopper groups that dominatedthe charts and sold mil- lions upon millions of albums.

At Peter's discovery of this turn of events, a plan is hatched among the three involv- ing a computer virus and some slight embezzlement. The film continues to follow the trio's attempt to swindle the cor• poration they feel has betrayed them, and the inevitable fallout, but I found the movies true strength to be in its study of the office and its employees, specifically Stephen Root's portrayal of the charcter Milton. Milton, the put-upon worker who mumbles when spoken to and is on the verge ofbreakdown after having his cubicle moved over and over, is inspired. I almost didn't recognize him as the actor who I had watched on 'IV as Jimmy James on Newsradio for so many years. Gary Cole, too, is notable in his portrayal ofPeter's Vice President and arch-nemesis, Bill Lumbergh. It's not difficult for one to 'Qilder- stand why Peter has such a vehe- ment hatr~d for the man, but Cole also allows for the viewer to see a little further into his character. Lumbergh too, .is faced with the constant fear ofbemg replaced, as are his employees- and every- one at Initech, a place where people are valued so little. I don't really understand why more people didil'tsee this movie when it came out in theaters last . year. lt was pretty much ignored,. . but is being discovered on video. h's a very funny movie, well;.. acted, with intelligence and a strong message· that many people can relate to.

Some- thing about the workers weary resignation, something abeut their blank stares at the An- nouncement of Hawaiian Shirt Friday - it rang true and familiar tome. When the film's pfQtagonist, Peter Gibbons, explains that \It's not that I'm lazy. It's that I just don't care,\ I identified with him. Anyone who's worked in an of- fice like the one in this film does. As does anyone who, llke Jenni- fer Aniston's character Joanna in the ftlm. has worked in a chain restaurant or store. Anyone who's experienced in the worlcplace, what George Ritzer in his book of the same name, termed \The McDonaldi:zaton of Socieiy\ will recognize the char- acters in the movie. It ~s somewhat dehumanizing to go to work in a place like Initech, where bosses exercise their au- thority with a false friendliness and where the threat cf unem- ployment is the only motivation. It i.s the sensation of being trappecf in mindless rules that is the f()undation of the malaise at the center of the film. It is only through a botched hypnotherapy session that Peter is freed of them and therefore transfcrms his life, to the aston- ishment of all those around him. This includes the C()nsulting team sent in to review Initech's empl()yees, are impressed with Peter's honesty. They i!Ie stunned at h.is frank- ness aboat his workday (he con- fesses that he only does about fifteen minutes of actual work a week), and label him a straight shooter with upper maliagement written all over him. The same is not said of Peter's two friends at Initech, Samir and Michael Bolton (whose suffering due to his name we only get a glimpse of), who are both sent packing. At Peter's discovery of this turn of events, a plan is hatched among the three involv- ing a computer virus and some slight embezzlement. The film continues to follow the trio's attempt to swindle the cor- poration they feel has betrayed them, and the inevitable faUout, but I found the movies true strength to be in its study of the office and its employees, specifically Stephen Root's portray~tl of the charcter Milton. Milton, the put-upon worker who mumbles when spoken to and is on the verge ofbreakdown after having his cubicle moved over and over, is inspired. I ahnost didn't recognize him as the actor who I had watched on TV as Jimmy James on Newsradio for so many years. Gary Cole, too, is notable in his portrayal of Peter's Vice President and arch-nemesis, Bill Lumbergh. It's not difficult for one to under- stand why Peter has such a vehe- ment hatred for the man, but Cole also allows for the viewer to see a little further into his character. Lwnbergh too, is faced with the constant fear ofbeing replaced, as are his employees- and every- one at lnitech, a place where people are valued so little. I don't really understand why more people didn't see this movie when it came out in theaters last year. It was pretty much ignored, but is being discovered on video. It's a very funny movie, well- acted, with intelligence: and a strong message that many people can relate to.

The drama was set dur- ing the fust decade of the twenti- eth century. The one-act play consisted of eleven actors and actresses, per- forming on a fixed set. The scene was that of a bar in Paris, with tables, chairs, barstools and a counter. The stage was adjusted to the perspective of the audience. This meant that the doorway was tilted and the corners of the tables were not perfectly right ~ngles, allow- ing the spectators an accurate, 3- D perception of the scene. Picasso at the Lapin Agile is a drama depicting the meeting of Pablo Picasso and Albert Einstein in a bar in Paris in 1904. The two young men have not yet become famous and their meeting results in a discussion of science and art and their impact on a rapidly changing society-the twentieth century. Albert Einstein and Pablo Picasso come face to face in the bar. Their meeting represents the played by David Jacks '00, and Pablo Picasso, played by Mark McKee '01. Jacks' was witty, wacky, and tousled his own hair to more aptly portray his charac- ter. McKee did well playing his womanizing character Picasso. William Finlay, the head of Yulman Theater, commented, \Pi- ca~so at the Lapin Agile was a ri- otous account of Steve Martin • s production. The play is vezy rel- evant right now, with the whole dis<:ussion on science and art. That topic is really hot right now.\ In fact, Picasso is a segue into the next theater season- the three plays which will be per- formed in Yulman Theater next year will have the same science and art theme. If you happened to miss the per- formance last weekend, there is still another opportunity to catch the play.
