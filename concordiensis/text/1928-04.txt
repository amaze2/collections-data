The things he talked of wrre far too complirated and pro- found for SIIIWrficial or momentary thought_ There is always the dan- ger that on this unsubstantial basis, conclusions would be reached. Thus his legitimate andicnce is confined to . those who intend to go far into all the issues which he presents-who will earnestly pursue the subject, while perhaps, forgetting a claim to intellectual leadership. Other men will proceed in other spheres of in- terest. W c plead for a certain spe- cialization on the part of those who will take the responsibility of grc•at issues. In discussing the presumed lack of :attendance at the \I and E lectures\ the inference is very obviously that the delinquents are engaging in somr of their \brutish selfishness,\ since this is the general conclusion cover- ing their attitude. The inference is quite indefensible-as in any other without an adequate pr.esentation of facts. It is hard to sec the \sdfish- ness\ in self-deprivation of an cn- lightenmC'nt we could tio_t get else- where. T fails to demonstrate, either, that in general those who stay away arc at the same time comporting themselves in a manner unworthy of students. Therr are, after all, many who must study and many who have no real interest in the subject under .discussion. vVc would not all be hyp- ocrites for the sake of an \appear- ance\. There are intellectual pur- suits other than that contained in a given lecture_ And now the furious questions. 'vVe wonder if T has had the opportunity .to know where ~nter-fratcrnity ani- . mosity exists-where it is, rather rivalry-where it is uncongcniality and consequently non-intercourse. Animosity indicates .strong, and ig- • noble dislike; after all, one can only speak for oneself in this regard. Are we selfish? All life is selfish, even the.life of apparent sacrifice de-'· pends only oil those things we ca~e most for. What shall we dedicate it . And still another leading tobacconist m Schenectady, N.

Bascom h<sue Ma·nager _____________________________ U, E. no,·lcwell TUESDAY, APRil. 17, lll2S ACCEPTANCE With this issue of tlw Conem~dil•nsis, the new beard assumes the management and undl•rtah•s a further development of the princ·iples and ideals of the adrnini~trative a1Hl editorial policies whieh have establishecl for this paper a singularly indi- vidualistic p.lare amm'lg the leading college publi- cations. We wish to express our appl-eriation to our predecessors f<H· the experience and Pduca.tion in journalism whirh we have gained under their tute- lage, for the treatment and acquaintanee of the conditions prevalent on this campus, and for the patienee and undl'!'standing wiH1 ·which they have shouldered the numerous blunders Hf .our l'arly as- sociation with them. The thoroughness of th<'ir training, we hope, will manifest itsdf in ou1· efforts througl~out the coming year. We accept the responsibilities of our position with a full realization of the el<:ments to which we are exposed. The distinction brtween d.e:-;truc- tive and constructive rritieism is not finely drawn on this campus. That the quality of om:produr- tion is a reflection of the support w.hirh the Stu- dent Body accords us will soon be forgotten in the hazes of letha1·gy which are wont to cloud abusive minds. The retiring board provided openings for the expression of student opinion through the col- umns of the Concordiensis .. To these we rordiaH v invite a more active and a mm'e animate patrm~­ age, in the hope that it will effect a degree of cooperation between us r.Jever ·hefo1'e ·atta.im•cl. WHY? According to the report of the .recent Terrare Council balloting, less than a third of the students qualified to vote availed themselVl's of their privi- lege. The proposai of the Terrace Council to re- vise their persennel met with .an ou tb,mst of. (:~·is­ approval against the appat:ent exercise of· un- granted powers. Deliberatioml ·of a joint com- mittee result£>d in the selection of 'two alh·rnativcs. The pl\<'sentation of tl]('se to tl1e Student Body faill•d to meet with any semblan<:\e of unanimous acceptance. The oQj~etions raised to. these' in Student Body meeting, hewever, being spontanc- eus in nature, were ineffectually presented and poorly received, If more timr and .thought \Ve1·e devoted to lhei'r arrangrment, a more popular in- terest might he induced. Two-thirds of the Student. Body has failed to express itself on 'the issu~ involving the l1ighest undergraduate honor. Any organ·ir.ation whose voi~e i~ .. pe~;sistentl ~ Wt;4.~~nf>d ;by tlH'~, silrnre of its ma.Jor1ty IS generally ·.t.egai·ded as defunct. \Ve challenge the right to further existence of the Student Bodv as a governing assembly. An ac- tive interfraternity counril would be far more rep- resentative. ., THE CONCOUDIENSIS, TUESPAY, APRIL 17:, 1928 i. \If Winter Comes :~n1:Spting Ji'e far ·bel\lnd ?\ 'The answer is \Yes\· and ~~J;d~tl;t •rl'~ed an ''Ask Me An- other\ book t·o prove .i'J;·.·:;l A .. st.i'p'll ar-ound tl\e cari1J'H1S would convi.n~c· the ·tii\bs'~ ·:stll!lwart doi.ibtcr.

The college aut:l\orities arc said: to h;n·e conducted an extensive :business selling· sticks at a lowrr rate tha~ the Depar.tnwn.t of Physicacl Train- in~. ThP difTen·nrC' in prke is said to be ,partiaHy dtH' to the fact that the sticks cldivered the past wrek- Pnd \\'Pl'P rontractrcl for at midyears, whereas .the la- crosse stick prices were settled af.ter that da·te. The sticks sold by t:he departments qther than the Phy,ica-1 '!'raining Depactmcnt, have the disa:d·1·anta.ge of briti.g non-cxchangeablt>, non-reittnding, a11d with no resa•IC' or sPcond hand val11e to the p.tii'ehaseF. * * * Some s.tudPnis havt' concluded that the superstitions about Friday thP Thirteenth are a lot of btrnk. The n·ason: some studPnts passed the stick exams. SomP students have nlso eortcluded that Frida;y the 'Thit·- teenth is an tmlucky day. The reason: some students failrd thP stic-k nnms. 'Fa•ke your choice. * * * '!'he excuse business has undergone a remarkable boom in the past few days, but few new reasons have come to light ns the resu1t of this rapid expansion. Charlie 1lale's standing offer for an original excuse is still standing. By the middle of this week, however, most of the sojourners and excuse getters wiH have returned, and the campus will relapse into its periodic slumber that precedes prom. * * * Student body meetings ha\·c already assumed the statr of coma from which they were aroused by the flare about the Terrace Council A vote of about I 10 ballots wouldn't indicate any deep and profound interest in the T<.'rrace Council and its constitution. Probably now the students will ·be content to sit back and let tht' council do as it pleases. Maybe ten years from ' now someone will suddenly dedde it is again time .that the student body assert its powers to the Terrace Coun- cil and a similar shake-up will then result. Anyway the c:;vents of the past few weeks stirred a little interest and did no harm, and the Terrace Council will now Jjp allowcd to pmsne the even tenor of its ways. * * * :-.1 ow that the new Concordiensis board is in we wer-e unrt>rtain. as !o the fate of this column. We are .still uncertain. Whether \to be or not to be\ is the ques- tion, it seems. the column is to be for the present any- way, as ··,.We Ita ve not been flooded witlt applications to take over this weekly effort.

The knob is situated in Northumber- land·, just north of Schuylerville on the Hudson river. The trip was made by automobiles and consumed the entire afternoon. AN ADDirfiON TO CAMEL SMOKE-LORE WE SUBMIT the sad case of the freshman in zoology, who, when asked to describe a camel, said, \A camel is what you wish you were smoking while you try to think .of the -right answers.\ He flunked zoology-hut he 'knew his cigarettes. For in time of trial or time of joy, there's no friend like Camels. The su'btle influences of choice tobaccos upon the smoke-spots of mankind have been carefully studied, identified, and blended smoothly into Camels -the finest of cigarettes. And we'll bet an alkaflitch on this: Camels have just the taste and aroma to :pack your smoke-spot with the \fill-fullment\ every rxperi<'nced smokc'r seeks. Got an alkaflitch you want to lose? Ct9zs R. J. REYNOLDS TOBACCO COMPANY, Winston-Salem, N.C. Stark's Knob is important for his- torical as well as geologic reasons. It was here that General Sta-rk stationed a battery in the battle of Saratoga which efficiently checked the retreat of \Gentleman Johnny\ Burgoyne and his English grenadiers up the Hudson when Morgan, Schuyler,• Gates and Arnold had stopped them.

It is believed that this neck once existed as a part, of an active \'Olcano in western Ver- mont, and that_ it was moved ·to its presrnt site by a great prehistoric overthrust. :Its original location has never been detrrminrd. One is able to get an unusual view of the Hudson valley for several miles from the top of the knob. From this point of vantage Professor Smith pointed ont and explained the forma- tion of the various river terraces, gla- cial deposits, the tilt and slope of the outlying hills as well as the Adi- rondack and Green mountains. Sev- . era] members of the class scaled the si<lc of the precipice and brought to · light many objects of geologic in-· terest. ----0·---- WEATHER HINDERS GOLFERS.

Issue Manager------------------------------------H. P. Hall ! FRIDAY, APRIL 20, 1928 POLITICAL MONOPOLY Every small coHege possesses certain charac- teristics of campus routine which distinguish it from every other small college. Many of these characteristics are developments of customs re- garded as traditional. Practically all are ac- cepted as a matter of course because a reform entails an expenditure of time, thought, and effort which factors modern tenets deem are not to be dispensed too generously. In its method of electing managers of athletic teams, Union College clings to a unique practice. The assistant manager who, at the end of one year of service as such, automatically succeeds to the managership, is chosen by a committee com- posed of the director of athletics, the captain and the manager of the sport involved, and two faculty members. This system displaced election of the assistant manager by the entire Athletic Board. The abandonment of the latter form was an at- tempt to offset corrupt emanations of fraternity politics. Does the present practice place the election into the hands of men who are, by reason of actual contact and active association with the nominees, qualified to render an intelligent and fair-minded decision? The manager of a sport, in the daily fulfillment of his duties as such, would be in a po- sition, were it not for that flexibility of conscience which campus association demands, to name the most deserving of the candidates. Were it to be regarded as individually decisive, his selection, not- withstanding his own unblemished character, would be universally accepted as personal and un- fair. Yet the present system provides for eithe1• endorsement of the manager's choice or indulg- ence of whims of a fraternal or transitory nature. Thus, the principle upon the strength of which the present system superseded election by the board discloses itself a modification of the former practice,-impartial perhaps when certain frater- nities are not interested, doubly corruptible when they are. Rderenre to the law of averages cer- tainly does not justify the change. One might argue that an alumnus is not suffi- ciently blinded by fraternity ties to give an unjust verdict. In some colleges, this argument might bear conviction, but, when fraternity life is so well-developed and so intimately binding as at Union, one would be foolish to stand by such an assertion. Consideration of other elements, the voter's ignorance of the ·effort and often of the personality of the competitors, for instance, st:rengthen this belief. We would suggest that, since a board requires the service of a faculty member to vouchsafe for its integrity, said member be chosen only when Rtttgers' undefeatrd lacrosse team made it thver straight for the season last Saturday, defeating the Lehigh University sticlmH'n in the latter's opener by the score of 10 to 3. Rutgers will play here on :May 4 for the SC'cond home game of the season, and one week later the Rutgers nine will play the baseball team here in the first home game of the season. The Jersry nine has defeated the :'lfontclair A. C., 8 te 5, but be- cause of rain did 11ot play the game scheduled with LafayeHe last Saturday. Yale's lacrosse team opened the season Saturday by defeating St. Stephen's, ro to 3, in a rain which lasted almost continually throughout the game. Neither side displayed good teamwork, the wC'ather conditions seri- ously affecting thl\ play, but the Blue excelled slightly both on attack and d('f('nse. The Garnet twelve will journey away on May II to play the winners. Cornell defeated St. Bonaventure in basl\hall last week, 3 to 2, in a game which had to be called at the end of the sixth inning because of rain. Union will finish its season this year in a game against St. Bona- vcn tnre on June 9. Practice for th(' roz8 football season has already begun. Coach Charley Crowley call<'d out the candi- dates for Columbia's eleven last Tuesday for a prac- tice session to continue for a little less than three weeks. The Blue and White is losing eleven of last fall's first string squad through graduatton in June, but will have excellent material to fill the vacant posts from the undefeated fresltman eleven, which capped off its season •last fall by dt\feating the Cornell yearling team with a score of 33 to o. his fraternity affHiations a1•c not influenced by a c1IapteJ• on tl1e eampus. We would further rec- ommend that fuller consideration be given the opinions of the coach and the assistant manager, both of whom are better acquainted with the re- spective merits ·of the candidates than the ma- jority of the existing committee. The latter course insures at least abolition of the present monopoly. :~!~:m::w:::::::::::::m::m:::::::::::::::::m::::::::::m:::::::m:::::::::::::::m:::::::::m:::m;JJ ii~ \G.O OD GOODS\ m u ill = m = m ~~~ Every merchant thinks that his merchan- .m !~~ dise is the best on the market for the price m '!~~ he asks.

Harris TU-F.:SDA Y, APRIL 24, 1928 'l'he foJ:Jowing Pdiblrial, which was publ'ished April 7 in Tlw Seht·n~Ptady Gazette, is indicative of the t't•ct·ption th.at Union's new literat·y publi- cation lms lwt•n accorded off till' campus. \THE Inoi.\ Anyone by a little pains may know that America is producing a considet·able body of beautiful lit- l'rfl. tut·e. It is hard to think Willa Cather's piC'- turC' of the archbishop in the glowing setting of the ptwblo d(•sert, or Ralwaag's saga o'f a Norse Hettlement in Dakota, can ever die as records of the soul of America. In non-fiction, too, new classical forms arc being created to receive the writings of coming genius, especially of the passion and occupatiom of the people in American history. \The Idol,\ the nc1v literary magazine at Union C'ollt•ge, has come upon the scenes at a tim€ of the parting of two schools of popular writing. The interest of the outside public is to see what it will champion. The first number of \The Idol\ seems to be far from the taint of modern realism which has struck a few college literary publications. Paul Elmer l\Iore has summed up the literary philosophy of our realists including such names as H. L. l\Ienckcn, Theodore Dreiser, Sherwood An- dt•I'son, and Sinclair Lewis as tlw raw lubricity of the yellow journals first page without <'omment or 1·etlcction. In othe1· 1vords he savs they portray Am<'!'ican life as a \stinking treacherous game.\ This literature mnnbrrs most of the best seller<> ami has nearly ohsrsu1·ed the considerable body of renl!J fine and permanent works being turned out even under modern commercial conditions of the prPss. It is rather pleasant to see \The Idol\ start hv giving first page and largest space to (rhoreau, that strangely pyramided genius beyond the vision of his time, based on Yankee common HPnse and sublimating the Puritan principles into a national philosophy. Om• stumbles upon some of the book reviews of this new <·ollcge litcratu1·e with a rather pleasant moral :-;pnsation. They set•m more honest 1han the suhtl.v commPrcial publicity most of us have to depend upon in selcding additions to our libraries. 1f this is the \sPlf expression\ of modern youth it is not so bad as. some ky to have us think. This copy of \The I'dol\ suggests strongly, like mueh else of that sort, that in this as in .ali ages, whm youth takes to study it explores many tradi- tional paths before it boasts of a mind or any ot·iginality. When it explores the disadvantages of a narrow Ptwironmcnt rnm·cly, it produC'es the horJ·ibll' results of \realism.\ §= =~ ~ !Let The :GJiecian Drraml : =~ e_ -= =- i = = - It was a'bout twe years ago· ,that the Prom issue ·then known as the \Campus Ash C'an\ ·Contained the star:t;ling revela-tion tlmt t•here was no -crhne wave.

I.n !fact we haven't been disturbed at a-ll'. But ·cv.en if we ·\ia•vcn''t :been disturbed there arc 'Others that have, we ihcar. The disturbed ones are connected with the Schenectady po'lice department who a·re f.rcequently informed by a campus dweller of the . terrible things those cellege boys do, like driving a car <u:mmd the campus whh 1927 license plates. Things have rea·cheJ a terrib'le state when one may ddve a car an- ,privatr .proper.ty without registrat-ion p'la•tes. H you dot!'t believe it ask this campus dwdlcr. Some- thing ought to :be done about it. Sotnething wiU be done about it. Sometlling is done a·bout. He calls the palice. Perhaps a l!ittle law study would save a few telephone ca·Ils. But then when bicycles secret themselves behind fences it is convenient to hav,e the police find them. Certainly some one helieres there is still a crime wave. :\lost of us haven't lost any sleep over the crime wave, and the antedated fliv\'C't'S on the campus haven't both- ered tis a bit. There may :be something rotten in Den- mark, but why worry about Denmark. * * * * Brad Dyer has perfected a new type of windshield wipe!- ·\Vhich was successfully demonstrated on the bus which took the baseba'll team to the tooth-paste college last w.cek end. It is a four man power wiper, and works in the hea\·i~st snow. It was in a·lmost conlin- md OJlt'ra,tion for about ,six and a half hours without missing a stroke. For further information consult Mr. Dyer or any of the candidate baseball managers. Inci- dentally they will probably enlighten you on their opinions of Schencctad;Y •buses, the weather and a few other topics. Probably members of the baseball team could in form you of the success of the test for the new windshie-ld cleaner. * * * * No one has suggested that we build an Ark yet but if it rains and snows for a few days more, we plan to write for specifications, as we'll be well started on the forty days and forty nights stretch. * * ( * * Annotmcrmcnts of prom committee meetings re- mind us that \moving out\ day which always precedes Moving Up day will soon be here. I suppose we've got to look for a place to stay prom week when the fair sex take over the fraternity house and anything in them that ·isn't nailed down. The universal question among the seniors now is \vVhat are you going to d'o next year?\ T11e almost universal answer is \I don't know.\ Some of us thought we knew when we came here. It has taken us four years to learn that we don't know what we want to do. Well that's something anyway. By ANTISTOPHANES. In brief the lit«;!'!u·y contagion of ignorance in our time may be devastating. But it is not hope- less so long as we ;ha-ve colleges to teach the breadth of complete lmman tradition. \Ask Me Another\ \Ask me another\' is a very entertaining educational pastime. But the answers to far more important questions than these must he found by the progressive merchant who intends to increase his profits. Where can I get the best advertisiil'g for the least money? Where can I advertise so that the college students will see it at least once a week? How can I be sure that ;my advertising campaign will be a success? How can I make my advertising dollar do its full duty? You can easily find the correct solution to these problems by advertising in the Union College Concordiensis. This newspaper reaches the entire stud14nt body twice ~ week. 9 5 % renewals and 3) % increase this year proves that advertising in this pro~ ductive medium really pays and gets results. For rates that are reasonable with liberal dis~ m counts write or phone the business manager. m ~lmmm::m:m::m:::m::m:::m.:u;m::m:.:;u:=miumm::numa::mu:m:a:n:um:;mHi 4- Piece Suits $29.5tl--$34.50 Whether for golf, towa or 'campus wea-r-you will find 'these new sport suits smar-t and serviceable.
