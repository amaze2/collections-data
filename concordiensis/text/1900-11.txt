Union tnet a strong opponent in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute last Saturday and only succeeded in 1naking one touchdown in twenty- five n1inutes play. R. P. I. defeated Colgate by eleven points the Saturday before, and there- fore catne to Schenectady with a considerable show of confidence. Though she could not get the ball far into Union's territory at any time, she played a desperate defen5ive game. Union t-uight have run up a larger score but for fumbling when she catne near her rival's goal line. The soggy field prevented either eleven from doing any strong line bucking, as the backs could not get started with sufficient momentum. Well executed plays about the ends were want- ing, through the same reason. Punting was frequently resorted to. Judd and Carver wet·e about evenly matched in this respect. In the first half, Rensselaer did considerable ground gaining, though she was stopped when- ever she got a few yards into the Garnet's territory. R. P. I. was several titnes in itn- rnediate danger of being scored upon, but a wet ball and a strong defence saved her each time. Union's score in the second half was due to a very pretty run for forty-five yards by Captain Carver. Aided by a bold interference, he went about Stnith, Rensselaer's right end, and then down the field, shaking off and dodging the R. P. I. backs one after the other, finally depositing the ball over the line to the left of the goal posts. Paige missed his goal by a hair. Union did not show the satne strength she exhibited in the Cornell game.. There was lacking the satne dash that she has shown before. The day and the field may have had much to do with it. The defence was good though not extremely aggressive. Mallery's knee bothered hitn but 1i ttle and he went into the play with unusual vigor. Paige did well on the defence but could not buck the line with any effect in the few times that play V\ 7 aS tried. Thebo put up a very strong gatne. The Troy n1en had a hard titne stopping hin1 \Vhenever he ran with the ball. The line n1en all played a strong game. V\t ... eed went in the gan1e but was soon forced to retire by a hnrd tackle after his catch had twisted his ankle. Anderson was substituted. He passed the ball with precision and once on a punt made a good gain after Finnegan had opened a hole for him. Rensselaer averages in weight about the same as the Garnet. Her teatn work was excellent. Gridley, the centre, is easily the best man on the eleven. Griswold frequently found him a hard man to keep back and several tirnes he broke through with effect. Doty, at right half, is another strong player. He follovvs his inter- ference well and is quick to see the srnallest opening. y· oung, at right tackle, and Chesbro and Sn1ith, the ends, are heady players. Notwithstanding the fact that a heavy rain had poured down all morning, a large crowd was on the ca1npus to witness the struggle. Rensselaer sent over a la1·ge delegation from Troy, which never lost hea1t in encouraging its eleven. Union's cheering was better than usual. The cheer leaders kept the students together and cheering throughout the contest. The summary: Union defended the south goa]. Paige kicked off to Doty who wa.:; quickly tackled on the twenty yard line. On the second down Doty gained five yards and in two tnore downs eight yards. Then Aldrich advanced five yards and added seven yards on another line play. Doty again took the ball and rnade eight yards. R. P. I. then tried three line plays which were stopped short and Union took the ball at the centre of the field. Mallery went around the

She gained ten yards and fumbled but recovered. A line play was stopped short. The qttarter~hack kick was then used for a gain of :five yards. Doty gained four .and ~Greenfield one. ·On the next down 'CoUi er broke through and tackled for a three yard l:oss to R. P. I. A repetition of the quarter-back l-\:ick resulted in Thebo falliHg on the halL MaUery .then made a brilliant run of thirty yards w l1ich placed the ball on Rensselaer's twemty yat~d line. Union then futnbled twice but Fenton· recovered the ball in each instance. On t11e third down Carver was unable to :gain and R P. I. took the ball. Doty succeeded in tearing through Union's 1·ight tackle, passing tl1·e entire Union line and reaching the ce11ter of H1e field where he stopped sl1ort on a fine tackl(l by Weed. On the second down Finnegan tackled for a loss. R. P. I. was unable to gain tbe necessary five yards and the ball vvent to Union. Carver punted f<wty yards and the baU was brought back five yards, Weed catching the ball. He was tackled without gaiu, and his ankle, which was sprained two weel<s ag~, was so injured that it was necess~ry to replace l1i1n with Ander- son. '\Thebo gained twenty y~rds and Olmsted ten. Finnegan, Mallery and Carver we1~e un- able to rnake five yards ~nd R. P. I. punted to Anderson at the cente1- of tl~e :field. Several short gains were tnade bringing the ball to Rensselaer's twenty y~n-d line when titne was called for the first half. In the second half Gridley kicked off to Carver, on Union's ten yard. line, who brought the ball th.irty yards ahead. Nallery plunged through tackle for eight yards. Then Carver, Mallery and Olmsted, b J numerous short gains, brought the ball to Rensselae1·'s thirty-five yard line. There Union lost tl1e hall on downs. R. P. I. punted to Union's foTty yard line. On the third down Union punted to Rensselaer's forty-five ya.rd line. R. P. I. again punted to Union's forty yard line and Anderson brought the ball back ten yards. Line dives by Paige n1ade Union six yards. Carver then punted to Rensselaer's twenty yard line. R. P. I. punted twenty-five yards and Union had the hall. One down resulted in no gain hut on the second, Carver went outside of the tackle and skilfully dodged and wriggled through the entire Rensselaer team. After a beautiful run of . forty-five yards he crossed the goal line for a touchdown. Paige missed the goal. On the next kick-o'fr Anderson brought the ball back thirty ya1·ds. Union by quick, long · gains rapidly- advanced to Rensselaer's twenty- five yard line where the ball was futnbled to Aldrich. R. P.

THE OONOORDIE'NSIS. THE FIJ{ST AMERICAN EX:P ANSIONIST. : can .states.men is even now either openly opposed or reluctantly accepted, was, foreseen, predicted, Why This Title May Be Claimed for an Illustrious Union Graduate. Henry Han:ison Suplee., in the Novernber nutnber of the \Junior Munsey,\ tnakes an unique clail'n for Williarn Henry Seward, tl-:1e n1ost famous of all Union tnen. Just now, when the nation is in the heat of a great political catnpaign in which the very policy is discussed that Mr. Seward so strongly advocated, the article is of tnuch interest. Space prevents the publication of tnore than the main extracts. \The first American expansionist and in'l- perialist, as these tenns are now accepted .. was Williatn Henry Seward, the first n'lan in Lincoln's great cabinet, and perhaps the ablest, boldest, and most far seeing statesrnan of his age. Other n1en, like Jefferson, believed in extending, and did extend, the limits of the country by adding contiguous ten·itory, but Seward was practically the first to look over seas. \His fame grows larger with the lapse ot tin1e. He will always be classed with the n-:1ost courageous statestnen, if for nothing else than his declaration of the doctrine of ''the higher law\ in politics. As Secretary of State in Lincoln's cabinet, he achieved the ,~ery highest success as a di plornatist in a period when American diplotnacy was put to a severer test tl1an at any tin1e before or since. If, as many believe, the providence of God was specially rna nifested in the calling of Abraham Lincoln to the Presidency in that fateful period when the life of the republic literally tretnbled in the balance, there is equally good ground for thinking it was also tn.anifested in the calling of William Henry Seward to the head of the State Departn1ent. ''Seward's tnost rernarkable characteristic was the clearness with which he foresaw far off events. l-Ie was the most clairvoyant of all American statesmen. He was mote than a statesman ; he was a prophet. rfhe enonnous expansion of the United States which we are witnebsing in 1900, and which by many Ameri- and glioried in by Seward nearly half a century ago. As early as r856~ speaking in the Senate, Mr. Seward said : ' We are the center of one ,; syste,m., an Arnerican one ; 'Great Britain is the center of another, a European one. Altnost in spite of ourselves, we are steadily extending and increasing our control over these continents. Notwithstanding her tenacity, she is constantly losing her dominion here. This is within the order of nature. It was for three hundred years the business of European nations to colonize, discipline, and educate American nations. It is now the business of those nations to govern themselves.' He foresaw that the American flag must be carried eventually out into the Pacific, to the islands of the seas. He predicted that it would dominate the whole northern con- tinent, and that the flag of Great Britain would be witihdra,vn frotn this hemisphere within fifty years frotn the titne he spoke ( 1856). There is no present likelihood of a literal fulfiltnent of that prophecy, but in a certain sense it tna y be said to have been already realized. The posi- tion of Canada has wholly changed since Seward's titne, and she can no longer be termed a 'dependency' of an alien or hostile tnilitary power. \Foreseeing as he did that our Paci fie coast was to be the base of a great cotntnerce with the Orient, Seward negotiated the splendid purchase of Alaska. It was his forceful diplon1acy that drove the French troops out of Mexico, and destroyed the empire of Maximilian. It was his farsighted mind, also, that dre'v the Treaty of Darien, the sixth article of \\Vhich provided that the United States should have control of the inter-oceanic canal, which it was then pro- posed to build over the Darien isthtnus. Mr. Seward was sagacious enough to see the great political importance of the waterway linking the Atlantic and the Pacific, whether it shall finally be located at Darien, at Panan1a, or in Nicaragua. \In short, Seward's figure loon1s up largest and grandest as that of the great prophet and pioneer of American expansion, who anticipated

8 THE CON'C·ORDIENSIS. by half a century the events of the present era, ' and gloried in the anticipation. He it was who first proclaimed Greater Arneric&. By his acquisition of Alaska, no tess than by his advocacy of the acquisition of island possessions in all quarters of the globe, he wrote the intro- ductory chapter of the majestic stoty of conti- nental supren1acy, naval developtnent, and com- tnetcial rnastery, vv-hkh will forrn the annals of. the .Atnerican nation in the twentieth century. Seward be!lieved in the repubH:c. He also believed in its irnperial destiny. '• Wherefore the life of this nan is now of unusual interest. Seward was pl 1 eetninently a statesman of the old school. His parents were well to do, his father, Smnuel S •. Seward, being a physician in Florida, Orange County, New York, ·where William Henry was :born in 1801. Educated at Union College, ScheHectady, then under the direction of Dr. Elipha:let N ott, young Seward con1:pleted his law studies in I 823, entering the office of Judge EUjah Miller- whose daughter he afterwards tnarried-at Auburn, New York. Auburn \-\>Vas his hon1e for the rest of his life, his entire career, except that in the wider field of national politics, being identified vYith New York State. Legal practice proved a ready stepping stone to politics, and Seward, who had proved himselfagood speaker in college, was active in the Presidential carn- paign of John Quincy Adams. The so-cHlled 'Albany Regency,' consisting of the supporters of Martin Van Buren, was the particular object of his attack, and as this clique held the political fortunes of New York in its gt·asp at that time., Seward's course was a bold bid for popularity among the Whigs, vvho elected hi tn to the State Senate in 1830. This was rightly considered a great victory, and caused Seward to be looked upon as an available rnan for higb.er office. \When he was norninated by the Whigs fot· Governor, in 1834, Seward n1ade a strong cam- paign, but was defeated by William L. Marcy. Four years later, when pitted against the same opponent, he was victorious, being elected by a handsome tnajority. ''Governor Seward's manage.rnent of State afl~irs had a n1arked bearing upon national issues. This has been true of many adtninistra~ tions in New York since that time. In the main, he acted on his own judgment, aithougli he gave much weight to the advice of Thurlow Weed and of Dr. Nott, of Union. \Probably Mr. Seward's surest claitn t() permanent fame will be the acquisition of Alaska. While it is hardly possible that he could have foreseen all the far reaching con- sequences of this transaction, it is certain that he realized more than others at the time, for few regarded the great arctic territory as being- of any practical use. The price paid, $7 ,zoo,- ooo, has long ago been recouped out of the seal fisheries alone, not to 1nention the gold dis- coveries of the past few years. Instead of being an ice bound wilderness, Alaska bids fair t() become an important center of civilization. A feature which has hardly received the attention it deserves is the fact that its coast practically lies on the great circle connecting the northern. Pacific coast of the United States with Japan and the Philippines, and ~tffords a possible route for a Pacific cable, with stt·etches .of only about eight hundred miles in length between the available stations. Mr. Seward's political career closed with this, his crowning work, and returning to Auburn, broken in health, l1e gave up public life forever. His journey around the world closed a busy and useful life, and he peacefully passed away on October Io, r872.\ END OF THE TENNIS TOUQNAMENT. Cook and Metzger the College Champions in Doubles. The last match of the tennis tournament was played on the college courts last Thursday after- noon. J. H. Cook, 1901, and FrazeT Metzger~ 1902, defeated G. W. Donnan, 1903 and P. L. Merriman, 1901, after three well contested sets resulting 6-4, 6-4, 6-r. The tournament met with many unexpected delays, but the commit- tee was untiring in its efforts to bring it to a suecessful finale. Owing to the increasing inter- est in the gan1e, it is planned to have another court fitted up, and to hold another tou1·nament in the spring.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 SOPHOMORES, 6 ; JUNI~OQS, 0. The Underclassmen Play Well Together. The second of the inter-class games was played Friday, afternoon between the juniors and the sophomores. The sophon1ores won by a score of 6 to o. 1903 kicked oft~ Hawkes caught the ball~ but was downed before he had advanced very far ; I 902 lost the ball on downs and the sophomores steadily advanced it toward their opponent's goal. When it was within two yards of the line the juniors held for two downs ; the third down, the soph ornores futnbled and the ball rolled over the line where Pritchard fell on it. Gould kicked goal. The rest of the half the juniors held well, and had the ball in their possession part of the time. Once they attempted a punt, which was blocke<.l; they had the ball when time was called. In the second half, the juniors .kicked oft' to Weed, who n1ade a short run. Again the ball was carried toward the upperclassmen's goal, but the juniors held them and secured the ball. They had made but little advance when time was called. rrhe teatns line up as follows: 1902 1903 Bloch, I-Iannay., .... right end .......... Pritchard Stiles .............. right tackle ............

Utnpire. -Dr. Towne. The Woodruff, Depew and Roosevelt mass meetings of the past week have all been attended by the gt·eat majority of the students.

SOPHOMORES WlN THEIR SECOND GAME. · Seniors Are Beaten in a Contest Which Had Bttt One Half. The senior-sophomo1·e game was played on the campus Monday afternoon. As usual, there ' was a large gathering of students along the side-lines, who itnpatie11tly waited for the game to begin. It was after :fh·e when it was finally called, and darkness was rapidly coming on. Although but one half was played, occupying about twenty tninutes, three touchdowns were ,made. The sophomores kicked off and a fe'\v minutes later secured the ball on a fumble. Then Mac- farlane nHtde a brilliant run and carried the ball over the line for a touc'hdown. 'The try for goal was unsuccessful. The seniors kicked off to Pritchard who was downed after a short run. The sophomores then lost the ball on a furnhie. After a number of good gains, Sumer'iski was sent over for a touchdown, and Kline kicked goal. On the next kick-off, Kline caught the ball and was do'\vned after a pretty run. The seniors fumbled the ball, but Parker broke through the line and secured it. After a few short gains, the seniors attempted to kick and lost the ball on another futnble. Pritchard was then sent over for a touchdown. Van Loon failed at goal. The game was called off at this point, leaving the sc()re ro-6 in favor of the underclassmen. The line-up follows: 1901.

EvERY voter who lives in a near-by town should be on the campus election day afternoon to support the eleven in its game with the local Washington Continentals. That eleven has made smne very creditable scores during the season which show that its strength is not to be tnade light of. The R. P. I. game showed the students' cheering capa- bility, when they take the trouble to follow the with. A short time ago Dartmouth could not score against it, though it is said she played but a weak eleven. In the second place, the college will be particularly benefited in Troy if a good score is run up against the Vermonters. Furthermore, the moral effect of a large crowd of Union supporters upon prospective Union men from the Troy -prepa- ratory schools is not to be underestimated. \Vil- liams draws very largely for students from that city at present, Union oughttodraw more than she actually does. The total inveshnent is one dollar and ten cents. The returns may ibe large. THE PROPOSED schedule for shortening the col- lege year has already met with much opposition from many members of the student body. It has been felt by a number that the petition t>f the undergraduate council to the trustees last June was not in response to the sentiment of the great majority of stude11ts, that the matter did not receive its due consideration, and was too hastily passed over. According to the present plan of the faculty, the Easter recess will have to be cut down to about the same duration as the former Thanksgiving recess, unless the three mid-winter holidays are given up. It is scarcely possible that any such action 'Will be tal{en. The early comtnencement, of course, is merely a recognition of the man who is putting himself through college on the tnoney earned through his sumtner vacation. Formerly, such students have been granted early leave of absence. The question is raised as to whether or not the new order of things is going to be an effec- tual remedy. Many claim that it will not be such. At least, it will be an aid. Still, is not the student leaders appointed for that purpose. Even if there who desires to spend a reasonable time at ·home is but a small attendance of undergraduates, the town men should be sho\vn what Union spirit is. THE VERMONT game at Troy on Saturday should draw at least orie hundred and fifty Union men. There is a two-fold reason for such an attendance. In the :first place, the team will be encouraged to do its very best. It may be hampered by the fact that the hard Williams game was played but three once or twice a year worthy of more recognition? Would not a week's earlier opening in the fall be a much better idea.? The 1najority of the summer work would certainly be at an end at such a time. By such means, recess would not be subject to snch wholesale cutting as is now proposed. The Con- cordiensis intends to secure the individual opinion of every undergraduate on this matter, and asks that it be thoroughly discussed by every person days before. Vermont is a strong eleven to battle who feels himself concerned.

THE CONOORDIENSIS. 11 VESPER SE~VICE. Rev .. H. C. Cooper of Nott Terace En1.manuel Bra ptist church gave a very interesting and im- pressive talk at the Vesper service in the chapel on Sunday afternoon. His talk was based ott the question and answer found in the 119th Psahn: \Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed thereto accord- ing to thy word.\ This is an old question asked 3900 years ago; \Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?\ and then the answer is given to it, '' By taking heed thereto according to thy word.\ '·'In rea·ding this passage the picture comes before us of an old man who had lived a conse- crated life, and is now resting from his labors, harpy in the consciousness of duty performed. No dark clouds are there to dirn his last days. He looks forward to a future life still full of use- ful ness, happiness and peace. '':But how seldom is it that we find such a picture! Life seetns always to be marred by s<>rne sin. It is in our youthful days, when the anirnal is strong in us, that we cotntnit sins that tell on us in after life, that leave a taint that will not be gotten rid of. And so it is ilnportant tl1at in our young days we should keep our lives and thoughts and days clean. \No part of life is free fro1n sin and tempta- tion, our lives are battles, unless vve yield readily t() sin., give way at its onslaught. In the college it is that we mould our lives. As we are when we leave college, so will we remain in after life t~ a great extent. A man's life is tnade or rnarTed before he is twenty-fiye. Think of the nutnbers of young tnen that have been powers while still young. Alexander when he reached the zenith of his power was just thirty\two. Napoleon was thirty-five. Raphrel was twenty- seven. Martin Luther was only twenty-four vvben he started that crusade against Roman Catholicism. Calvin when he wrote his great worl{, \Institutes of the Christian Religion,\ was only twenty-six. The work of the world is done by young men. This fact etnphacizes the importance of stopping now and considering how each .of us rnay rnake his life ten for the m·ost. ''Not stopping to think, is the cause of ninety- nine out of every one hundred causes of sin. It is necessary to set som·e definite plan, have some outlined idea, if we want to accornplishanything. We must take heed unto our ways. ''The battle that young men are fighting is not with the world or other tnen, but with yourselves. You are battling with indolence, evil habits, your passions, pride and evil thoughts. It is only as we get the victory over ourselves that we can go on to other victories over the world. \The text says 'by taking heed thereto according to thy word.' So it is according to God's word that we are to follow. There is a great tendency nowadays to do away with the Bible. There is no other book that will help you when in trial and in trouble. No such book could come from man. It stands alone. You can do without any other book and you can replace it. Blot out all history, all science and some one would find it out again, some one would dig and delve and bring back the knowl- edge. What man has once done he can do again. Blot out philosophy, it has been done, and it would be brought back. But blot out t11at Book and nothing would be found to fill its place. \And so it is important that we, in the days of our youth, should take heed to our way ac- cording to God's word, if we want that happi- ness in the antutnn time of life, that only comes after a life that is tnodeled after the Divine Life.\ FQESHMEN ELECT OFFICE~S AT THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. The class of 1904 of the Albany Medical college, Monday afternoon, elected the following officers: President, Albert Vander Veer, of Albany; vice-president, Guy V.

College Year Shortened By Two Weeks. At the trustees' tneeting last June, it was decided to shorten the college year by two weeks, provided the faculty could cut down the various recesses so that the number of actual days in which the college was formerly in session should remain the same. This was done in response to the petitions of the faculty and undergraduate council for such action. In accordance with this action, the faculty has decided not to grant the students' petition for a recess of two days instead of one during election week. The Monday following Thanksgiving has also been stricken from the list. Christmas vacation begins on Friday, the twenty-first of Dece1nber and closes with New Year's Day, active work comn1encing on Wednesday, the second of Jan nary. The other recesses are to be announced later in the term. CAMPUS NOTES. Frank H. Drees of Carroll, Iowa, has entered the freshman class in the engineering course. John E. Parker, 1901, has been elected cap- tain of the base ball nine for the coming season.

The\ Syracuse University Weekly,\ the new student publication of that institution, prints the following concerning Dr. Ashrnore's assistant of last year. \Dr. C. C. Bushnell, who succeeds E. J. Reddington as Dr. Smalley's assistant in Latin, comes to us from an instructorship in Union. He obtained his A. B. fron1 Yale in 1891, and a Ph. D. in 1895. Latin, Greek and pedagogy formed the basis for the work leading to his doctor's degree. Dr. Bushnell has taught Latin and the sciences in Hillhouse Higl1 School, of New Haven, Conn. ; was professor of Latin and Greek in Emery and Henry college, Virginia ; instructoi· of Greek in Cincinnati, and later, instructo1· of Latin in Union. Altogether, he bring~ a splendid preparation.\ '96.-Earl Sayles has charge of the con- struction of the power canal for the St. Regis Paper Co1npany at Gr(at Bend, N.Y. REPUBLICAN CLUB CANVASS. The Great Majority of Students Sup- porters of McKinley and Roosevelt. A cotntnittee of the Union Republican club, appointed to ascertain as nearly as possible the political leanings of the undergraduates, has practically cornpleted its canvass. Almost every student has been questioned. The results show that eighty per cent. of the students favor the election of McKinley and Roosevelt ; nine- teen per cent. are opposed to imperialism ; and one per cent. are adherents of the Prohibition party candidates. A large number of men are non-voters but the figures show the average is about the same atnong men who have arrived at their tnajority and those who have not. THE ALUMNI COLUMN. Interesting News About Union Graduates. '50.-Frasier Spraker died at the home of his son-in-law, Willia1n G. Cooke, at No. 87 Han- cock street, Brooklyn, on Thursday, after an illness of ten days. Mr. Spraker was born in the town of Palatine, N. Y., on September 4, 1825. He wgs graduated frorr1 Union college in the class of r85o, and two years later was admitted to the practice of law.

A large crowd of Union supporters saw their favorites beaten on the earn pus at Williarnstown last \!Vednesday by a small score. The Purple tnade its touchdown in the fin.,t half after thirteen tninutes' play. Fron1 that titne on Union played a very strong gan1e and twice catne within an ace of scoring on her opponent. Excitetnent prevaile? frotn the very beginning. Williatns seriously rnenaced the Union goal before she made her touchdown. The ball was brought within one foot of the line, where Union braced and forced the Purple advancers back three yards on the fourth down. Again she brought it within eigbt yards of the line and again was held for clowns. It was only on the third atte1npt, after hard bucking, that Graves was sent over the line for the only touchdown of the garne. Williatns did not threaten her opponent's goal after that tin1e. Play in the second half was aln1ost entirely in the Purple's territory. A futnble on the ten yard line, after a series of bucks frotn Union's forty-five yard line, lost the Garnet's best opportunity to score. With but a short titne to play, Paige tried a place kick frotn the field, but the ball sailed a short ways to the right of the goal posts. Union went to Williamstown with the de- termination to play the game to the limit. Her supporters thought the eleven had a very fair chance to win, and events proved that their calculations were not entirely wrong. After the 1niddle of the first half, Williams was quickly forced to kick every tiLne she held the ball. Union's defence was excellent throughout and she showed splendid strength and power of recovery. Williatns' play was much superior to any work she ba.d exhibited before this fall. Her gan1e at West Point showed she was rapidly developing frotn fibre sluggish style .of play of the week previous. Her E-upporters were sur- prised at her show of stre11gth. The Williams line was scarcely as strong as that of the Garnet, though it held together very well. Williams di'd' most of her advancing on tackle plays direct&d by Fenton, though gains ·were n1ade on the other side of the line. Dolph could gain hut litt1e through the centre. Dolph's punting was excellent and the vVilliatns ends, especially O'Neil, were dovvn on the kicks in fast titne. Sitnrnons played a strong gatne at right taclde. Jaeckel and Graves are fairly fast on the advance. Union's main fault was in that she did not kick frequently enough.. I lad this been done at the proper tirne in the first half, \rVilliatns would very probably never have made her score, as she was scarcely capable of running the ball down the field for fifty yards. The Union line was strong hoth on the offensive and defensive. 1'he three centre 1nen were a stone wall. The three backs had a large atnount of work put before them and it is aln1ost surprising, they did it so well. Each one could altnost always be relied upon for a small gain. Carver did but little punting. He was sure in the kicks but they scarcely went as far as did those by Dolph. Anderson's handling of the ball was almost unifonnly good. The one unfortunate futnble was very probably not entirely his fault. The teatn played the entire gan1e without a sub- stitute and with scarcely a tnan calling for titne. Finnegan and MaBery, in so1ne way, bunked heads badly in one scrimmage. Mallery hurt his shoulder badly in the last part of the game, but did not let it tr()uble hitn until after the call of \titne.\ The entire student body of vVilliatns was ranged along one side of the gridiron. Four men in front of the ropes si1nultaneously lead

Dolph lde ]{s off fo~: Williams. Anderson catches on th<:! twenty yard line and advances ten yards. ·Carver goes four yards on a cross tackle play. Mallery is downed by Hatch for a loss. Carver· punts to Leggett who is downed on Williams' fifty yard line. Williams cannot gain on the tbird down and Dolph kicks. 'I,he ball rolls over the line and Union has a free kick. O'N e:U catches and makes ten yards. Second down~ no gain. Simmons goes past Finnegan foi- three yards. Dolph punts and the ball goes over the line again. Anderson picks it up and only makes t\vo yards. Carver kicks to Graves who runs for fifteen yards to Union's fifteen yard line. Dolph cannot gain but on tbe third down 1uakes five yards. Graves plunges for four yards and Jaeckel for one. Graves places the ball within one foot of the line.

The Garnet Finds the Green Mountain Eleven No Easy Problem .. Union defeated the University of Ver;mont by a small score last Saturday. The game was played at Troy on the field of the Laureate Boat Club. Through the courtesy ofthat club, Union was granted free use of the grounds. 'fhe gatue was replete with exciting incidents. The Vermonters frequently futnbled the ball, but was usually lucky enough to have a rnan nearby to drop on it. Both sides did consider- able rushing. Vermont forced Union to her h·venty yard line twice. She held the Garnet for downs within the five yard line during the second half, but was unfortunate in having the punt out blocked in11uedi:ately afterward. An unsuccessful try for goal, from the twenty yard line late in the second half, lost her only good chance to score. Union showed general superi- ority in both offensive and defensive work, in rushing the ball for longer distances, and in forcing her opponents to kick after the third down. Early in the first half, and at the close of the second half, were the only times when Green and Yellow appeared dangerous. A very ordinary sized crowd witnessed the gan1e. Union had but a small nutnber of rooters present. Vern1ont had a few sup- porters present. The day was an excellent one for a good game. The air was chilly and few breezes were stirring. When the tv{o elevens appeared on the grid- iron, Vermont was seen to have sotnewhat the advantage in regard to weight. l-Ier line was considerably heavier than that of Union, but the Garnet weighed more behind the line. The Vermont organization was excellent. Though she played for tilne frequently, her interference, when once the signal was given, was m~de up in rapid shape. On the offensive, she played all but the five centre n1en considerably back. Parker and Waddell were the strongest men in the line. Beckley gave a good exhibition at centre though Griswold proved to be his

8 THE OONOORDIENBIS. superior. The ,ends, especially Capt. Morse, were weak. Dane., at right half, was slow on the defensive. Robinson, ex-1901 at Union, as quarter, played a good game. The advancers, however, futnbled his passes frequently. He V\las played back on the defensive, and ran well on catches of Carver's punts. Strait and Locke did the best advancing for the Green and Yellow. Thebo played a brilliant game for Union, though Morse did not put tnany obstacles in his way. Finnegan and Shaw did splendid work in opening up holes and in breaking through the line. Olmsted was handicapped most of the gatne by a badly strained wrist. Anderson directed his plays '\vell. Mallery received a bad bruise in bis left shoulder in the Willian1.s gatne and did not play. Gulnac proved an excellent substitute. He was a hard 1nan to stop when once started. Carver ran fast with the ball and tnade good gains altnost invariably. T'he line· up and sutntnary: FIRST HALF. Paige kicks off to Robinson who advances thirteen yards to Vennont's thirty-three yard line. Locke tnakes four yards on a tnass between Fenton and Shaw. Strait bucks for a yard gain and Dane adds another through the left. Strait cannot gain on the third down. Morse kicks out of bounds on Union's forty-five yard line. Gul nac goes about vVacldell for three yards. Paige breaks through centre for eight yards. Carver and Gulnac each add three yards. Paige goes through his hole for two yards. Finnegan and Shaw tnake a large open- ing for Gulnac, who takes the ball to Vennont's thirty-five yard line. Neither Paige nor Carver can gain. Gulnac tnakes but three yards on a straight buck and Vennont gets the ball on downs. Locke 111akes three on a cross buck. Dane dives for two yards. Dane futnhles but a Vennont n1an drops on the ball. Locke adds three yards but l\ torse is forced to kick. Paige catcbes on Union's forty-five yard line and is prornptly tackled by Patterson. Finnegan fun1bles for a loss of ten yards. Vermont gets the ball. Patterson circles Thebo for six yards. Strait gains five yards in two plunges. Thebo gets past Morse and downs Locke for a five yard loss. Vermont holds a consultation and then Robinson tries the quarterback kick trick but punts the ball too far. Anderson catches on the fifteen yard line and hrings the ball ahead five yards. 'Carver punts to Robinson who 1na'kes five yards to Union's forty-five yard line. A quarterback run fails to gain for Ver- tnont. Another quarterback kick is c:a ugh t by Anderson on Union's thirty ya1'd line. A punt by Carver hits Robinson on the head but aVer- n1ont tnan drops on the ball in the centre of the field. Locke goes through the ri:ght of the line for three yards. Dane n1akes eighteen yards on a n1ass play outside of Fenton.. A fun1ble by Patterson loses eight yards. Anderson fumbles Morse's punt but falls on the ball on Union's twenty-five yard line. Carver does not gain and then kicks to Robi nbon, w l1o is itn111ediately downed by Thebo in the centre of the field. Union gets the ball on a fur-r1ble on her fifty yard line. Union now starts the ball rapidly down the field. Carver rnakes three :tncl Gulnac five yards on cross tadde plays. In two line bucks, Paige brings the ball to Vennont's thirty-five yard line. Oltnsted goes a bout Morse for five n1ore. Thebo loses three yards on Locke's tackle. Carver circles Morse for ten yards. Gulnac and Carver advance five yards and Paige hurdles to the ten yard line. 'I'itne is np. SECOND HALF. Waddell kicks to Carver, wl1o dodges past half the Vern1ont eleven, and places the ball on Union's thirty-five yard line. Carver goes about Morse for twelve yards tnot·e. Paige makes five yards in two plunges. c~n·ver again skirts Morse and 1nakes twenty yards. Finnegan can- not gain. Paige bucks for five yards. No advance is tnade by Finnegan cr Paige. Gulnac breaks through between Orton and Macl{ellow and starts down the field clear. A±ter tuaking thirty yards, he is stopped three yards frotn the line. Vermont holds firm and the three Union backs each fail to gain In ore tban a foot. Ver- tnont gets the ball on downs. J\!Iorse's punt goes low and is blocked. Gulnac falls on the ball within two yards of the line. Carver can- \ I

l I THE OONCORDIEN8IS. 9 not gain through the right of the line. The ball is very near the left side line and V errnont scarcely expects an attack from that quarter. Carver goes by Morse for a touchdown. On the punt out, Anderson futnbles the ball. Union, of course, cannot try for goal. Oln1sted catches the ball on the twentv-five ., yard line and makes ten yards. Carver goes through Vern1ont's right line for ten tnore. Finnegan tnakes five yards about Orton. Carver takes the ball to the centt 4 e of the field on a straight buck. Paige 1nakes but one yard on the tackle back formation. Gulnac cross bucks for three yards. Carver goes about Orton for twenty yards. Carver shortly runs out of bounds and Vermont has the ball on downs. Dane and Strait each tnake four yards. Morse gets past Olmsted for fifteen yards. Anderson tackles well. Finnegan bruises his hip in the play but goes on in the gan1e. Paige tackles Locke for a loss. On a delayed pass, Strait goes aln1ost alone for five yards. A furnble nets five yards for Vermont. Parker gets the ball. Locke retires and Hutchinson is sub- stituted. Strait gets through Union's right to Union's twenty yard line. Hutchison bucks for two yards. Morse loses a yard. Strait bucks for three yards and then rnakes first down. Hutchinson goes over Finnegan and Shaw for two yards. Strait cannot advance. Morse tries a drop kick for goal. The V ennont lines hold \veil but the ball sails wide of the goal posts. The kick was really a punt, and would not have counted. rrhe half ends with Ver- mont in possession in the centre of the field. The line-up and sum1nary: UNION. UNIV, OF VT.

The two underclass ele\rens fought to a stand- still Friday afternoon on the can1pus. Both sides did considerable aggressive work, but loose formations prevented scoring at critical points of the game. The freslunen kicked off and 1903 rapidly ad,·anced the ball down the field until within ten yards of r9o4's goal, where the freshmen held thetn fo1· downs. The freshmen could make but little advance and punted ; the ball was fumbled and the freshtnen got it again. l'ime was called with the freshmen in possession of the ball in the centre of the field. Pritchard kicked to ShetTill who passed the ball to Cronkhite. The latter ran 6o yards and was just barely stopped by Weed. The fresh- tnen carried the ball to 1903's ten yard line where Cronkhite tnade a good try for goal. The sophornores kicked off from the 25 yard line. ,.rhe kick-off was blocked but 1903 got the ball. The game ended with the freslunen in possession of the ball. Cronkhite played a fine gatne for 1904 and Mulvaney also played a good game for I 903. The line-up follows: 1903. POSITIONS. 1904.

THE RE-ELECTION of \\Villiatn McKinley as pres- ident of the United States must be a particular source of gratification to Union men. Mr. McKin- ley is an alumnus of the law deparbnent of Union university. vYILLIAM J. SMITH leaves this week to resume his studies at the Columbia law ~chool. He takes with him the thanks and well wishes of every Union man. Coach Smith has built up-out of good tnaterial, it is true,-one of the best elevens that ever did honor to Union and itself upon the ... gridiron. The team, thus far, has been a credit to Union and to the coach. While the eleven remains under the able captaincy of John P. Carver, the students need have no apprehension .of the best possible showing in the few coming games. THE TIME is ripe for a \semi-occasional'' re- minder-· ·that in relat,iotl to attendance at college meetings. Of all th~e duties devolving upon the Uniott student, this is the most urgent, and also the most easily performed. Yet while it requires nothing beyond the range of anybody, it tends toward neglect througll a seeming carelessness alone. When we consider the advantages, and even the necessity of th€se gatherings, it is easy to see that herein lies the real source of strength for the student-body. Without them there can be no unity of college spirit. A half-hearted zeal, with scattered enthusiasm, is all that will crown any effort. It is at these meetings alone that the students can get an insight il1to the true life of the institution, and forward anything to enervate that life. It is difficult to understand the attitude of n1any in th,is respect. Surely the fear of subscrip- tions is not the cause of their general absence, as those ''days of tribulation'' are most over. Let all the students take this 111 atter to heart and check this laxity, that, in its encouragement, can only work for our injury. GAMES ON THE GRIDI~ON. SATURDAY, Nov. ro.

. ' ·~ 12 THE OONCORDfENSIS. WA.SHIN:GTON CONTINENTAL'S DE- FEATED. The Local Team Proves No Match For a Weakened 'Garnet Eleven. One of the poorest exhibitions of football that vvas ever p:layed on the Union catnpus, occurred on the afternoon of Election Day, and was wit- nessed by one of the largest crowds that ever assembled at a Union game. Poor teatn work and wretched fumbling were the rule with both eleven::;. Union did aH the aggressive work and kept the baH in dangerous pro xi tnity to her opponent's goal throughout the garne. The Washington Continentals held Union's advance two or three times, but as a rule got the ball through futnbling which was rarely excusable. Union plainly showed the effects of the three hard gan1es of the previous ten days. The n1en, with but single exceptions, lacked the dash that wins. T'he gan1e was n1uch heralded throughout the city and accordingly attracted a large number of spectators. Bleachers were brought over from the armory and proved an excellent innovation. Each tean1 l1ad an enthusiastic lot of supporters, that never failed to give encouragetnent to the favorite eleven. The Washington Continentals have a heavy eleven that, with the proper practice and train- ing, would be well able to cope with strong teatns. Her line is an excellent one, but it lacks the stamina to carry it through a hard fought gatne. The 1najority of the n1en are old college players, graduates of different universities, who have evidently been excellent contestants in their day. The Garnet was severely crippled in the game. Mallery's bruised shoulder troubled him. Oltnsted was bothered by a sprained wrist, though he did some pretty running with the ball. Finnegan had a strained hip. Fenton and Collier were absent at the polls. Bolles 'vas substituted for Collier and played a good gatne. Carver took Fenton's place at right tackle, and was substituted at right half by Gulnac. For the Continentals, Tilden played an excell~ent game at qttarter. Stone, at left tackle, and McCarthy, at centre, were the strongest men in the line. Oatley, at full,. gave a rathet· poor exhibition. Thebo put up the best gatne for Union. He was always at the right spot at the right moment. He tore his ear badly in a scrimtnage. Carvet· and Shaw did splendid work in the line. Anderson handled the ball poot:ly. T'he game, in itself, was uninteresting. Union did aln1ost all the forcing but was constantly spoiling the good \Vorl< by fit tnbling when far in the Continentals' tetTitory. In the first half ' Union lost the ball on downs on the ten yard line, where the locals had made a detennined stand. After kicking out, Union again lost the ball on downs on the fifteen yard line-as the result of two fun1bles. The baH then exchanged hands twice on both downs and fu1nbles. Union carried it down to tll.e five yard line, but Gulnac fumbled as he was going over the line. Afte1· Oatley's punt, the Garnet rushed the ball straight down the fietd, and Mallery was sent ove1· for the first touchdown. Paige failed at goal. The half ended with Union in possession on the Continental's forty yard line. In the second ha~lf, after several exchanges, Union forced her way to the fifteen yard line and there lost the ba.U on downs on po~r forma- tions. After the punt, Union quickly went to the line, when Gulnac rnade the second touch- down. Paige again failed at goal. The Garnet, toward the end of the l1alf, brought the ball to within a foot of the line, but was unable to send a n1an over for the coveted touchdown.

The following is an extractfrotn the \Williatns Weekly\ of last Saturday: \vVilliams defeated Union on Weston Field, Wednesday afternoon by a score of 5 to o. The garne throughout was close and exciting inas1nuch as the two teams were very evenly matched. ·\ViUian1s was slightiy heavier than Union, hut the latter more than tnade up for her lack in weight by her clever interference and the swiftness of her backs. Before the gatne the odds were in favor of the horne teatn, but the final result was in doubt until tin1e was called. \Villiams tnade her score in the first half during which the ball was in Union's ter- ritory. In the second half, l1owever, Union got the ball on a fumble and succeeded in keeping Williatns' goal in danger until titne was called. On the whole the game proved satis- factory fron1 a Willia1ns point of view since the tea1n showed considerable improvement through- out over their work of the past t\.vo weeks. There was less individual playing and tnore tea n1 work than in the previous games, each man trying the best he could to help the others.\ DAMON. President Raytnond's faithful dog \Damon\ died the latter part of last week. Datnon carne to Union with the president in '94, and can1e to love the place-in his own way-quite as much as the average student. Dr. Raymond bad \Damon Union College,\ engraved on his collar and he was really the college dog. He made friends with every undergraduate, but he was especially a faithful attendant upon his tnaster. Rarely did the president appear on the campus, whether in the early morning or late at night, without being followed by the dog. Several times in his six year course, Damon appeared at the chapel service. As he came in quietly and acted in a becoming man- ner, it always hurt his dignity when he was lead out with scarcely a reason why. In his

14 THE OONCORDIENSIS. attitude toward other dogs, Da tnon recognized his position and held hin1self aloof.

Union won her seventh victory on the grid- iron last Saturday afternoon on the catnpus by defeating the St. Stephens eleven by the large score of 68 to o. The ga1ne was a walkover for the garnet frotn start to finish, in which every man (}tl the team took a conspicuous part. The ball was in the visitor's territory during the whole game and only twice did they make their five yards. The first touchdown was made after tbt-ee minutes of play when Carver secur- ing the ball on Union's 40 yard line, with good interfe11ence, ran 70 yards for the first touch- down. He was soon followed by Welles who ran 6o yards f\)r the second score. 'f his metbo<l was repeated time after time. St. Stephens would kick off to Paige ot· Anderson who would bring the ball up to the center of the field. In the next line-up a fine interference could be seen skirting the visitors' ends and soon Carver or Gulnac would shoot past and land the ball behind their opponents' goal posts. One of the featu1·es of the gan1e was the fine interfe1·ence given in the end plays. Almost every tirne the opposing end was picked off like a wooden n1an and a clear field left which usually resulted in a score. The plays directed against the St. Stephens line were less success· ful, f01-, considedng their lighter weight, the visitors showed considerable strength. THE GAME IN DETAIL. Baker kicked off to Carver, on Union's 40 yard line, who ran through the St. Stepl1ens teatn for the first touchdown after thr~e minutes of play. On the next kick-off, the wearers of the Garnet were not so successful, but ran the ball back to the center of the field where by end plays it was forced down to St. Stephens IO yard line and Carver was sent around the end for another score. This perfonnance was fol- lowed by a 6o yard run by Welles who scored a touchdown, and so on through the rest of the half in which eight touchdowns were made. In the second half a substitute team was put in, but they were more than equal to the St. Stephens players and succeeded in tnaking four more touchdowns, chiefly by good interference around the visitors' ends. Time was called with the ball in Union's possession on St. Stephens' 20 yard line. The line-up and summary: UNION. POSITIONS. ST. STEPHENS. Thebo . . . . . ......... left end ..............

6 THE CONO.ORDIENSIS. UNIFOI{M ENTQANCE EXAMS. Fourteen Colleges and Universities Defi· n'itely Decide to Hold Them. Fourteen colleges and universities wet·e repre- sented in the meeting of the College Entran()e Requirement Board at Columbia University Saturday. It was definitely decided to hoJd uniform. entrance exarninations next June for aU the colleges in the Middle States and Maryland. President Seth Low of Columbia was chosen · Chairman of the Board, with President M. Carey Thotnas of Bryn Mawr Vice-Chairman and Prof. Nicholas Murray Butler of Columbia Secretary. The first Executive Committee is to be cornposed of the chairman and vice-chair- man together with President Taylor of Vassar, Dean \tV. A. Latnberton of the Universitv of ~ Pennsylvania and Dr. Julius Sachs of the Sachs Collegiate Institute, New York city. The different colleges in the association were represented as follows : Barnat~d, Acting Dean Robinson; Bryn Mawr, President Tho1nas; Columbia, Prof. Nicholas Murray Butler; Cor- nell, Prof. H. S. White; New York university, Chancellor Mac Crack en ; University of Pennsyl- vania, Prof. W. A. Lamberton; Rutgers, Pres- ident Scott; Swatthmore, President Birdsall; u:nion, President Raytnond ; Vassar, President Taylor ; Wotnen's College of Baltimore, Prof. Van Meter; Johns Hopkins university, Prof. Griffin. Organization and conduct of exatninations were determined in detail and it was decided to send a printed report to all preparatory schools in the Middle States and Maryland, explaining the new educational departure. Next month the chief exatniner and his associates vvill be chosen upon the recotnmendation of the Ex- ecutive Committee. Four days in the last week of June, 19or, will be set apart tor the examina- tions which are to be held at thirty points in the Middle States and Maryland and at various centres throughout the West in all the subjects required for entrance to college. A fee of $5 is to be exacted fron1 every candidate and it is expected tl1at a large number of students, both male and fetnale who will not go to college, will take the examinations for the certifi.cate to be issued by the board to those who pass successfully. The expenses of conducting these examinations are t9 come from the student fees, and Prof. Butler believes that it will not be necessary to call on the confederated institutions for added fees. The new system is of far reaching educational itnportance and is likely to be adopted in time throughout the country. It is known that the New England colleges favor its adoption, but are simply waiting to watch the result of the experiment in practice in the Middle States. The question was favorably discussed at a t·ecent tneeting of Western educators at the Western Reserve University. The present association of parties to the plan includes the following institutions: Barnard, Bryn Mawr, Colgate,. Columbia, Cornell, New York Uni- . versity, Rutgers, Swarthtnore, Union, Vassar, Princeton, University of Pennsylvania, Haver- ford, Johns Hopkins and the W ornen's College of Baltimore. PHILOMATHEAN DEBATES. The Philomathean society held an interesting and enthusiastic meeting last Wednesday even- ing. The following subject was debated : \Resolved that tnunicipal corporations should • be owned by municipalities.\ The debate was decided in favor of the negative.

' I ' THE' OONCORDIENSIS. 7 PUQITY IN :COLLEGE POLITICS. What the \Amherst Student\ Has To Say on the Subject. The ''Amherst Student\ in its htst issue con- demns editorially any systern of C()l:lege politics in wl1ich. canva:ssi ng or deals exist. It follows in full: ''The present manner of conducting the junior and senior class elections has proved fairly satis- factory. However, one of the best parts of the system., as used in the senior election last year, was not adopted by the classes tfuis year ; it is as follows-· 'Whereas the above :p:lan (i. e. that embodied in the resolutions of the class) would make personal canvassing unnecessary, and as V\re believe such canvassing tends to encourage deals and wrongly influen-ce public opinion, Resolved, that we do away with all canvassing as detrin1ental to th.e best inteTests of the class.' Although for the n1ost of the offices in both the junio1· and senior classes no c~nvassing was done this year yet a large amount was done for son~e. Entirely setting aside aU thought of the officers elected, the indirect results of the can- vassing seen~ decidedly detrimental. The rnem- bers of the two upper classes £l-:10uld know their candidates well enough to elect ()fficers without canvassing and with satisfactory results. The really important factors which sh.ould enter into the election of class officers, -whether reasons for ot· reasons against voting for a candidate, are known by practically every rnembe1· of the class. Two or three years serve to bring out pretty clearly the characteristics of me11 in a class who are prominent enough to be notninated for office. And if important characteristics, whether good or bad, are not generally known, there is prob- ably very serious question as to tl1e existence of such characteristics. Moreover canvassing tends to produce corrupt politics. The temptation to make deals is of course great, but this is not the only danger. If a man goes to a friend, a tnem- ber of another fraternity, and asks him to vote for a certain candidate, even if he does not pledge his own support in retun1, yet if the first succeeds in getting the desired vote he feels under obligation to support the candidate whom his friend favors. Often tacit deals are engaged in and general understandings reached which in reality are almost as bad as open deals. · Voting for the best tnen o£ten becomes secondary. Fraternity delegations tend to vote as a unit in- stead of individually. When canvassing is done tnen become prejudiced and .do not vote im- partially. Furthern1ore, a feeling of estrange- ment and personal hostility arises w~1ich is un- necessary. This matter is discussed now in the hope that the senior and junior classes of succeeding years may abolish all such practices.\. COLLEGE CALENDAR .. THURSDAY, NovEMBER 22. 3 :45 P.

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS. VESPER SEQVICE. The Rev. John J. Seare of Nevv Brunswick Theotogical Se1minary, delivered a short but intere,gting address before the students in the chapeli, Sunday afternoon. His remarks were directed towards \The work .~f christian college men arnong college n1en.'~ ''Wherever the college man goes he carries a great measure of influence. Work among col- lege men has gt~eat potency. Theie is always found great talent in opportunity. You, as college n1en, are set in a rare field. \T.be Hrst thing to be considered with regard to helping non-christian college men., is the life which we,as: christian college 1nen ought to lead. Character induces character. Conduct is con- tagious. Every man, who looks back over his college career knows that he has been strength- ened by some men. \But we nay help these non-christian men in other ways. than by living a christian life before them. We may help them by cultivating a personal interest in them. I want to n1ake a suggestion of itnportance, especially to upper classmen, in regard to the freshmen. Many a man's future is made eternal during the first six weeks of his freshman year. If the chriE~tian rnen of the college would but look over the freshmen carefully there is no telling the results. It is your duty as upper classmen, to guide tl1e freshrnan past pitfalls, moral and sophomoral. \l believe in the efficiency of prayer for the individual. I know a christian man, who, on leaving college, selected twelve men who were his friends, but not christians, and used to pray for them. Now if we will only do this it will become easy to bring the gospel directly to then1. Of course it won't do to be talking religion to your fi:iends in daily life. But thet·e are crises in every man's life when he wants to talk religion, and if we are close enough to hitn as a friend, we can l1elp him. Let's watch our fellows, and when the right time comes let's speak to the point. Let us seek to be the missionaries, lead- ing others into the land of God, who takes away the sins of the world.\ \/' GAMBEE~BEEBE WEDDING. A qui,et and a very pretty wedding was solemnized on Thursday last, Novetnber 15th, at the home of Mr. and Mrs. William B·eebe, of Menarids, when their daughter, Miss Ade- laide, was united in marriage to Mr. Robert Calvin Gamhee, '99, by Rev. Dr. E. P. Johnson, of the First Reformed Church of Albany. The bride was very llandsomely attired in crepe de chene, and carried white roses and lilies of the valley. Dickinson E. Griffith, r9o2, and Gilbert S. Woolworth, 1902, were the ushers. The large parlors were prettily deco- rated with pal1ns and ferns. Gioscia rende1~ed the tn usic. After a cordial reception by the friends who had gathered to see the knot tied, and warm wishes for a happy future, Mr. and Mrs. Gam bee left for Englewood, N. J., where they will 1nake their home.

The second eleven went up to Saratoga on Saturday and sustained a defeat at the hands of the Junior Athletic Club of that place. Union .made the first touchdown in three minutes, but was unable to kick a goal. The Saratoga team also scored five points in the first half, and in the second half secured a touchdown and kicked the goal. Union had the ball within three yards of the home team's goal when time was called in the first half. In the second half, the ball was in Union's territory tnost of the time, Sara- toga playing very good ball. Mulvaney and Sumeriski of Union played a splendid gan1e, as did also Sherrill at quarter. Considering the fact that the Saratoga team outweighed the Schenectady team by fully ten or fifteen pounds, · the score of I I to 5 in their favor is not to be \Yondered at. 1\he line up follows : SARATOGA.

CONCORDIENSIS, Single Copies, TERMS: $2.00 per Year, in Advance 10 Cents Address all communications to THE CONCORDI- ENSIS, Box 218, Schenectady, N. Y. Entered at the Post-office at Schenectady, N. Y., as second- class matter. Chas. Burrows, Printer, 414 State Street, 'Schenectady, N.Y. Every student should be in the chapel Friday afternoon at two-thirty. Undergraduates who have heard Dr. McElroy know what a treat is in store for the audience. AMoNG the many features of The Concordiensis, none are more inviting than those found in our advertising columns. They represent patronage that should be patronized, because they offer every- thing suited to all tastes and desires, with the sure guarantee to please. Our advertisers are true friends of Old Union. IT IS THE clearly drawn purpose of The Con- cordiensis to be all-representative of Union college, not ouly in matters of interest to the faculty and students, but to the alumni as well. To fully carry out this purpose, however, requires more than the present means of the board. Most of the articles beating· on the alumni are gathered from the daily newspapers, and no doubt much of value is thus overlooked and lost, To remedy this, ~be board earnestly desires all alumni to communicate anything of interest in connection with auy of their fellow classmen, so that this all important bra11ch of the paper may receive its just and due attention. THE TERRIBLE mishap at the Princeton water tower on Monday should bring a lesson home to us. The practice of putting class flags on the dome of the Round Building will, sooner or later, result in some serious catastrophe. In the first place-the outside balcony was long ago pro~ nounced unsafe. Secondly-the ladder leading up the dome is of very doubtful strength. No one ca11 tell when some storm is going to weaken one of them to the point where a small strain will cause it to give way. The accident at Princeton was not the result of any lack of strength in the water tower, but merely of carelessness. It is safe to say that a little carelessness on the dome of Potter's Folly would surely result as disastrously. AMID the turmoil of college work there is one thing that should attract the attention of every student, and that is the 1902 Garnet. The import- ance of this volume as the annual representative of Union college life and activity cannot be over esti~ mated. It should impress every one connected with the institution, of his duty to make this worthy both of the name it bears and of the superior life and activity it represents. Judging from past experience, it is a difficult thing to arouse interest in this kind of work. It is generally left to a few men, and especially to the editors to do it all. And then again the board almost without exception begins work too late to bring out the best results. These are matters that s~ould appeal immediately to the representatives of the 1902 Garnet, if they desire to offset those same difficulties that have been experienced in former years. Unless a definite plan of action is carried out, with each member of the staff under- standing and doing his share of the work, there can be nothing but imperfect results. The 1902 board seems to realize the importance of its task, and has made a good start. It now rests with the students to give their heartiest co- operation, and make the Garnet what it ought to be,-superior to any of its predecessors, a fitting token of a growing institution. I' .,

' i I' ., THE P~OPOSED CO;N:STABULARY LAW. Union Man's Protest in the N,ew York Times. An interesting article on the state constabulary law, which the Republican machine intends forcing through in the next Legislature, appears in the Sunday Titnes. William G. Brown, '95, is the writer. \The only excuse not insulting to the abil- ity and intelligence of those 1·esponsible for the deliverance of our City Government fro·m Tam- many Hall is the extension and perfection of the Republican machine. Although a Republican by birth, education, and principle, I cannot assent to the proposition that party organization and not good governtnent is the chief end of all political endeavor. ''The proposed bill 1s a step backward. It is based upon the old and exploded theory, that a city is a political body, when in reality a city is a business corporation.. Let it not be under- stood that National or State Governtnents should be regarded as business corporations. Far from it. They have to do with questions of sover- eignty ; while local pride and business intere~ts are the fountain of municipal interest, patriot- istn and honor lie at the base of National and, to a certain extent, State govern tnent. \We have the testimony of such men as Andrew D. White, President Seth Low, ex- Mayor Hart of Boston, and Frank Sargent Hoffman, whose book, \The Sphere of the State,\ has becotne a text book in many of our colleges and universities, that after years of patient and diligent investigation of the cities of the Old World and extensive acquaintance with our own cities, our American cities are the worst governed cities in the civilized world. \They say openly that our city governments are the 'tnost expensive, tnost inefficient, and most corrupt in Christendotn/ And they are also agreed that our cities should be regarded and managed as business corporations; that is, without interference by the State Legislature in their local affairs. The Merchants' Association of New York City has also investigated this subject and has prepared certain measurefi for the consideration of our Legislature. It requests, among other things, that the governtnent of this city be conducted on lines similar to the man- age-ment of great business corporations. It is composed ofa body of representative business n1en, such men as tnade the Sound Money Parade a success, and in reality such tnen as throughout the country s'lved the honor and integrity of the country in its last crisis. Their suggestions cannot be ignored with itnpunity. '\Surely the Police Department is a local in- stitution. This city is prin1arily and ahnost entirely interested in and responsible for it. No questions of sovereignty are involved. It was amply _provided for in the charter by a con1- mission equaled only in wisdom and integrity by the framers of our National Government and aided also by the experience of 100 years more of civilization. \The proposed Constabulary bill is not only bad in principle, but it is extretnely itnpolitic. \Tammany Hall would undoubtedly give a great sum of money to have it an issue in the next Mayoralty contest. And as its good or bad effects could not be known before the next election, it would be an issue, the results of which are easily foreseen. \Twice the an1ount of tnoney that can be raised at the present tin1e in this city as 'hush n1oney,' from violators of the law, could be collected from the law-abiding industrious citi- zens who do not believe that the same rules of action that were applicable and acceptable to a Puritan settlement in New England are appli- cable to the existing conditions in this costno- politan city. Furthennore, as recently said by John D. Crimmins, the city governtnent can be wrested from Tamtnany by fifty bright, well in- fonned young t-nen, without political ~spirations, under the direction of wise leRders. But such young men cannot be found, when they are asked to go before the people on an issue that they cannot defend on the principle involved and their n1ouths closed by a blue law. \An opportunity is now offered for the citizens of this greatest city of the New World to profit by the valuable lessons learned from the experience of the cities of the Old Wo-rld.

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS. While we excel in nearly everything making for prosperity and happiness, they surpass us in having learned the great lesson of municipal government. \Let both parties perfect their organization, with our good citizens arrayed on either side. May both parties struggle on in that noble emu- lation of seeing which can better serve our beloved country. But the next Mayoralty con- test should be as a meeting of stockholders of a great corporation-each of us feeling a personal solicitude for an honest, efficient, and economic tnanagetnent of our public affairs. \We have no ordinary foe to meet. Their resources are almost boundless. The flagrant violators of the law (the \VTiter knows of several notorious resorts located in the most populous part of the city) are doubtless contributing to a fund to be used in defeating us. ~'In proportion to the emergency our young men will zealously respond, if left unhampered by party tneasures, and with all the enthusias1n of representing a just cause, will present the issues on their merits to the people.''

The University of Chicago, w:trned by the death of a Boston student in a recent cane rush at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has decided to do away with that old cUstom in the future. A number of the colleges have taken the sarne step, and tl1e rush will J'>tobably be t·elega ted to the past by all of our univetsities in the near future. These colleges believe that when such customs become a menace to life and health they are no longer proper and should be stopped. William H.

Informal plans were discussed for holding a series of hops during the winter, at the boat house. It was found itnpossible to secure a date this term when a hop would not conflict with something else. Consequently none can be held before the early part of next term. rfheodore DeL. Coffin, is chainnan of the comtnittee. He has appointed on the music cotnrnittee, William H.

Land- reth addressed the teachers on the subject of \Technical Schools in N·ew York State.\ He described the systern employed in this state and said that it was rational ra:ther than empirical. It embraces the acquisition of allied sciences. In this line it differs from the system of German and French technical schools. The American system is divided into the teachirig of drawing, field V\'ork, shop work and laboratory experiments. Drawing's main function is the developn1ent of perception and observation. It tends to increase tl1e po'V\Ter of expression. The laboratory develops the delicacies of perception. The field and shop work are executive in their function-not in n1aking skilled engineers, but in putting principle into operation in concrete form. The engineering school does not make engineers. All tl1at it can do is to establish principles. The engineer can be made only by actual work. The Concordiensis hopes to pub- lish tl1e entire paper in a later issue. A. COMMUNICATION. To tke Concordiensis : The action of the student body at the college meeting last Monday, seetns to have been the out- growth of misunderstanding and injustice. Taking the facts of the case as it really stands, the position taken against the class in question seems hardly tenable. The Soph01nores have suf- fered the loss of several men since college opened, and hence their amount of subscription has been lessened. The statement of the sum already handed in by that class to the treasurer was not exactly correct, as can be proved. This leaves a far less sum to be accounted for than was really understood at the meeting. This, however, is only of secondary importance compared with the -punishment to which the class was subjected. At no time have the sophomores beet1; so reluctant in the payment of subscriptions as to merit such, and surely the upper classmen were unjust in this affair. There is always two sides to a question, and both should be thoroughly discussed before a conclusion is reached. -U. C.

News of a personalt~,ature, about any alumnus, will be gladly received and printed.] '62.-Prof. James L. Bothwell of Albany was elected a trustee of the Hudson River School- rnasters' club at i6; meeting in Albany on Saturday. '87.-Dr. Henry A. Kurth of Schenectady has an article in the H 11edical Record'' of November ro, on H Chronic Copper Poisoning Among Artisans.\ \If an artisan at his regular occupation takes into his systen1 some of the tnaterial in which or with which he works, and this acts injuriously to his, we have a case of so-called occupation poison1ng,\ says Dr. Kurth. 4 '1,he varieties of occupation poisonings are numerous, but tnost, because of their rarity, receive little attention. Chief of these poisonings today is lead poison- ing. This from its frequency is nearly always recognized and rationally treated. Copper poisoning, on the other hand, is at present only too rarely diagnosed, and its treatment is any- thing but rational. Until within the last twenty or thirty years copper poisoning was not at all comn1on. But with the enormous growth of manufactures in the United States these cases have beco111e so numerous that any physician in a manufacturing city is likely to meet them. Cases of this kind are abundant here at the Edison General Electric Works, and it is frotn atnong these that tnaterial for this article have been largely drawn.\ Dr. Kurth claims that the prophylactic treattnent is the best. Venti- lating fans and the wearing of a wet sponge over the tnouth and nostrils are good pre- cautions. He says that the chief reliance must be prophylaxis a\ild change of occupation, and advocates a law pt·ohibiting work in this trade for more than three n1onths at a time. '97.-Paul Canfield has been elected alder- n1an-at-large by the Republican electors of Middletown, N. Y.
