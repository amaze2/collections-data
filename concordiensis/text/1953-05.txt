Mr. Jonathan Pearson, Director of Admissions, explained this situa- tion as prevailing in all colleges throughout the country as a result of publicity of need for top engin- eers. Union College needs at least 900 students in order to break even financially. To take up the slack from two years ago, the Admis- sions office is now accepting rr.ore students. By early this week, 212 men had already paid their initial fee and 166 others have yet to notify the college. As compared to Union's accept- ing 400 students, with 325 expecting to make up next year's freshman class, R P. 'I. accepted 1450, with 800 expecting to enter, and Colgate accepted 600, and look for a fresh- man class of 400. The breakdown of next year's freshmen is as fol- lows: Liberal Arts-90; Pre-Meds- 48; Civil Engineer.s-35; Electrical Engineers-SO; Mechanical Engin- eers-47; Physics Majors (an in- crease of 400 per cent)-33.; Chem.

Jones, Professor' of Romance Languages at Union Collage. Professor Jones, a memhe1· of the col- lege faculty for eight years, was a prominent and popular personalit~' on campus. The aura which he semed to create in the classroom with his timely and often amusing comments, typified the whole of Professo1· Jone's career, the career of a man who though entriely dedicated to his work, never lost touch with the desires of his students. One of the mainstays of the department, he was equally capable in the many languages he taught. The popularity of his every course attested to this fact and makes his loss here even more deeply felt. His ability as a teacher and the deep interest which he showed for his pupils, will be long remembered and sorely missed by all of us.

It holds to the truth that while similar, all of us have differences-differences in temper- ament, taste, and personality.

It garners most of its Engravings in This Issue by We were sad to see the announcement this week to the effect that the Block U dinner was called off for the lack of student suport of the affair. We believe that idea for which the affair v.:as originally conceived wus a worthwhile and sorely needed function. One must look at the world as nowledges that % %s ir objectively as possible. It aclmow- ledges that the only way to un- derstand a person is to accept his way of looking at himself and the world with his peculiar per- sonality, and that this personal variable is an integral, if not the crucial, part of objective reality. It means looking at an individual as he exists, i.e., judging him only by his behaviou, both overt and subtle, without any preconceived structure of \ideas\ in which to force and pervert the meaning of this behaviour. principles from the work of Freud and his· followers. ' Finally, it is a system of cause and effect. It does not hypothe- size any thing super-natural where it is in ignorance. It states that all of man's ·behavior is motivated. It defines knowledge as the objective discovery of this motivation. It says that all things have a cause. SCHENECTADY. N:Y. It is dedicated to the searching Ml' JP,.Y 5TRB~T for tllese causes governed, rela- tively, by modern scientific meth- od. It is our opinion that above and beyond the awarding of hats, letters, sweaters and blankets Union College athletes should draw some official recognition for their support of the school's athletic program throughout the year. The dinner was also intended to give the coaches, \the unsung heroes,\ a chance to be rewarded with the school's appreci- ation of theit· efforts. The dinner would also have supplied the means for the campuses extension of gratitude to the graduating senior athlete who had contributed the most to eullege athletic;:; during his four years at lTnion. .Secondly:~ it insists that a person apply the su-mmation of the Greek philosophers, \Know Thyself.\ 'rt ized kno~ledge of self before one presoupposes a realistic internal- presupposes as its highetst aim an acceptance of self before one can accept others.

We cannot put too much of the blame for lacl{ of sup- port on the student Lody's appa:rer.t rejection of the project. We feel that in organizing this ~ffair the Bloc]{ U society overlooked one important f-actor. The appeal of the dinner could only lie in the fact that it was to be a school project where the campus could fete our many deserving athletes. Having realized this fact the society should have attempted to make the dinner an all college event and should have re- jected the support of the Schenectady .rr. Chamber of Com- merce. Another important facto1· whic.la cut heavily on the ex- pected s1:1pport of the dinner was the necessarily high price for a plate at the affair. We shonld li1-;e to see the society attempt to run the dinner in the future as a Union College affail· and at a price that would make it possible for the stu- dent body to participate in the event. If necessary they should try to obtain official subsidation from the school it- self to make this possible. We sincerely hope that the society does not reject the project because of the failure in their first attempt. It would be a sad state of affairs if all worthwhile projects were dropped in the face of early disappointments. Perhaps the most interesting idea that has come out of this first intended Block U banquet has been the election by the school of an outstanding senior athlete. We believe, and the school has shown by the wide interest shown in the campus balloting, that along with other extra-curricular prizes one should be offered to the man who has devoted his time to Union Athletics. If for some reason the society refrains from attempting another Block U banquet we hope that an outstanding senior athlete will take his rig-htful place on the Memorial chapel stage with the other students honored at the Union College Prize Day.

Letter to the Editor To the Editor of the Concordiensis: Naturally a letter to the editor is against an editorial or a policy of the newspaper. This one is some- what different. Last Friday's is- sue of the Concordy made us all very proud of the college weekly. The C.A. agrees with the senti- ments of true brotherhood express- ed by the editors. However we are still puzzled by the use of the words \White Christian\ in fra- ternity charters. since .they are acting In an un- Christian zr.anner when they dis- criminate. They have hidden be- hind a word. They have done Christianity a great disservice and harm by discriminating in the very name of Christianity. Columbia, it v;as announced Monday of this week, ordered all organizations on campus to clear their charters of racial and relig- ious -bias by October 1, 1960. Re- ligious groups formed as working for paritcular denominations have been excluded from that order. This ban strides directly at the discriminatory practices of some fraternities on Columbia's campus. We wish to restate that C.A. wants to go on record as being against the use of segregation and also the use of \Christian\ is the restrictive clause in the charters. Christians do not discriminate if they are real Christians. Very respectfully, C. A. If the restriction clauses ·con- tain the words \White Christian\ then that is an erroneous use of v. ords and a matter of contradict- or terms. Christians are opposed to segregation on religious and racial basis. It is un-Christian to discriminate against a Negro, who might also be as much a Christian as any white man. There are countless Negro Christians and many of them successful clergy- men. The .point here is that you can't be a true Christian and up- hold segregation. Let's get down to practical values.

Top M1dds For Small Ooll~ge Meet By George Soffin The Union College track squad shoots for its biggest track and field prize, Saturday, as it plays host to nine schools in the New York State SmaH Col'lege Championships. This third annual engagement will climax two successive years ,of undefeated dual competition for the Garnet. Last Saturday.the Dutchmen trounced their t-raditional rivals, RPI, by a score of 73-53 at Troy.

Tomorrow afternoon, the Union College lacrosse team goes for its second win of the year when it faces Harr.ilton on Library •Field. Monday, the Garnet took its first decision by thumping Middlebury 10-4. The Middlebury victory fol- lowed a 20-13 loss to Dartmouth tm Saturday. Last year, the Dutchmen topped the Continentals, 18-9. The Middle- bury game was featw•ed by the spectacular goal-tending .by Gerry Heinzmann. Union jumped off to an 8-1 lead: at halftime and held it .from there on in. Hall, Brett- schneider and Rudolph each scored twice for the Garnet. Against Dartmouth Union started fast, leading by 5-4 at the quarter, but faded in the stretch; the Green leading 10-7 by halftime. Bill Sny- der led the Union offense with six goals. A win tomorrow would give the Dutchmen a 2-6 mark for the season; a slight improvement over last year's 2-7 record. ---01--- N etmen Seek First Win Against Troja The Union College tennis team will be at Troy tomorrow for a match with R.P.I. Last Friday's match with Brooklyn Poly was rained out and on Saturday the netmen bowed to Stevens, 7-2. Wednesday, the Garnet was topped by Vermont, 6-3, to drop their sea- son's record to 0-5. In 1952, R. P. I. defeated the Dutchmen twice by scores of 5-4 and 9-0. Against Vermont, Mohr- mann and Groff picked up sillgles wins, while Silver and Mohrmann won a doubles ·match.

To remove these books Is of absolute necessity, but where to place them is the sixty four dollar question. Next, study space is needed for 250 students and the library has only 140 seats. Only nine of these are individual study tables. As quite a few Union men realize, it is quite difficult to concentrate their efforts through the continual rustle in the aisles. Lack of Efficiency Finally, though many of us are not aware fo it, the cramped and inadequate working facilities for the library staff cause a loss of time and efficiency. Mr. Helmer- Webb has many in- teresting and Significant ideas about solving these (ieficiencies in a new buildibg, Since architects have drawn up no plans, Mr. Webb hopes that the new library will be con- structed from Jacques Ramee's plans for a c,ollege chapel. Ramee is the French architect who de- signed the original plans for the college grounds. According to Mr. Webb, the essential part of the library, the interior, should pro- vide space for a mainirown of 200,- 000 volumes with a possible expan- sion to 400,000 volumes. The li- brary should also seat about 250 students. He went on to explain that the library will have 300,000 cubic feet of spa.ce, This is more easily undel,'stood· when we see that the building is to be 150 feet long and around 100 feet deep. Of this area, fifty percent will be used for stacks, twenty percent for office space and, special ·rooms, and the remaining thirty percent for read· ing areas, group study tables and seminar roo!Wl.

Joseph !lo[l!nger Dutchmen's Village We hate to repeat our!'elves. Somehow we feel that in h1ere repition of a fonnet· theme you tenrl to alienate yolll' listener who, \has hea1·CI all that.\ Bul we feel now that the display exhibited uy the student body this past Tuesday in Chapel merited the clig;ging; up of these old !Jones. It was announced there that the builrling of the new field hom;e this summer woulcl necessitate the tearing down of some of the Dutchment's Village abcdes. The statement was met b\' the cheNs of tho::;e assembled. When the speaker continued,' that they might tear down the entire village the entire assemblage present joined in the cheers. It is quite evident from the student responses to these statements and from tall< heard around the campus that the present housing for some of the l:nio? faculty and rnany _of the married students here was considered far from satis- factory. We hmtily ngree with this. Cheerio! As tht' R<•nwster Draws Rapidly To a Clos«> I fe0l most stl·ongly of all, the :;ense of impending lo,;s that soon Union and the great cka-1 it ha:; come to m<:>an to mP. will disappear. With tlw vacation. that which is Cnion to me will be in considerable r..art ended, wever to be quite the same again. If indeed not all, yet most of those whom I have come to know will be scattered through- out America, far across the broad Atlantic and I shall never see them again. This J{]nd of heart-ache, which comes in many ways, is the common lot of all Exchange Stu- dents. And the whole expet·ience is in- finitely worth it, being quite unique in a. lifetime. There are so many aspects that it must suffice to say that all have been richly rewarding. This has been a year of turning door-knobs the wrong way, of be- ing scalded by steam from the cold-water tap, and of driving on the wrong side of the road, but it has also been a year of appreci- ation of the things which go to make up American life in general. and college life in particular. come to be endured, and another peculiar charactet·istic, which yet has its compensat:ions. The Chapel Assemblies I have greatly enjoyed, and despite the distasteful compul- sion, .they seem to me a valua-ble pat t of your sy:o;tem; for the edifi- cation of those who listen, for the lwalth-giving slumber of those who do not; and in general as a com- mon focus for the whole student body. A word on the problem and the cry of \student apathy\ which is much more uniform and wide- spread than often acppears from the opinions of local critics. Func- tioning as they do in the midst of a myriad of other distractions, the activities of the Mountebanks, W.R.U.C., Debating, and Publica- tions have particularly impressed me. Every organization in our de- mocratic way of life could use more support than it currently has, to take the United Nations for one exatl)ple, but it is the results obtained with the material at hand which are important, not the back- sliding of others. And that which is created is worthwile. Whenever we part company with someone or something that has been tiignificant in our Hves, we usuaHy think in terms of w-hat we have givt>n and what we have re- ct>ivecl in our relationship. The great Spanish philosopher-poet, George Santayana, tackled th·is preblem in \The Poet's Testament\ when he 'A rote: \I leave you but the sound of many a word In moclring echoes haply overheard. I sang to heaven.\' Some people have felt tha-t the opinions of this column wet·c cer- tainly not directed at heaven and, -indeed, probably aimed the other -way. This may be true. ,but even if ft ie not, the sounds remain. That the words were many cannot be argued. Whether their sounds will be ove1hea:rd is a moot question for neither my ideas nor my language can compat·e to Santayana's. Th<> pustiibility of my words being over- heard, however, rentains, so that in almost evet·y respect,. Santay- ana's lmes express what 1 have given to Union through my four years here. The question of what I have gotten is a more difficult and mote significant one to answer. San- tayana says: \Blow what winds would, the ancient truth was mine, And friendship melolwed in the flush of wine, And heavenly laughter, shaking from its wings Atoms of light and tears for mortal things. The setting of Santayana's poetry is perfect, for here in Schenectady many winds would blow' and, in general, they do blow. Aside from the wind of many of the good members of our faculty, the winds blow from four directions in the Tri-Cities area and usuaJly they are from the North. But in spite of, or sometimes helped by, the wind, two ancient truths were mine. First was the basis of Pro- tagoras' philosophy, \Man is the measure of all things.'' I think that the college student must see that human beings run the world and despite all the technolegical advanees of our civilization, the in- important problems. If. our gov- ernment, for example, would .re- alize that food and clothing a1<e ·far more significant to people in Europe and Asia than ·chewing gum, cigarettes, Coca-C(;)la, or de- ·mocracy, The second of the ancient truths wrur Socrates famous maxim \Know thyself\. Notliling, it seems to me, is so great a tragedy as the in- dividual who .does not !mow him- ~elf. The man who is in the wrong job, going out with the wrong girl, or in the wrong fraternity is he who does .not lrnow himself. It seems 'to me that self-knowledge is at lea:>t as important as any technical or pwfessional knowledge fur it shall be our knowledge plus ourselves that other peop·le will judge. Probably !l'ore lasting than an-y lmowledge gained at college wiN· be the frie\'idships made at collcg0, and especially thosp \ri1ellowed in the flush of wine.\ I am n)t suggest- ing that successful cellcge m<'n are only those who make friends and· drink. I am saying that he who realizes that life goes on in its usual cour,;e despite his classes .and his A's or F's is a better man for it and wHl probably be happier for it. There has been much laughter at Union through fol!r years and this, too, has been something concrete that I have gotten from college. There is something deeper in laugh- ter than enjoyment at someone's clevernes or embarraassment, I feel. When all is said and done, it is the people who can laugh a:t their own and other's foibles to whom my respect and admiration must go. -College should prepare us for reality, and as there are frustrations and disappointments as well as satisfactions in real life, let us prepare to laugh at them rather than cry. Thus, it seems that I have prob- ably gotten much more from Union than I have given. I don't feel that I have really cheated the col- lege because when we add all the tuition, athletic,. laboratory, and medical ,fees into the \given\ side of the ledger, the balance is more nearly equal. ·One more gift should The Dutchmen's Village const1 uctions are in om· opinion hardly things of beauty nor are they intended to serve the apparently permanent function that the college has seen fit to designate them for. It has been learned that the U.S. Army developed the type of building, which gmce the north- east corner of our campus, they originally intended the structures to last about three years in moderate climates. It amazes us. thet·efore, when \Ve see these buildings en- during ove1· twice that length of time in the hardly mild Schenectady climate. It is a year, too, of happy mem- ot·ies-of Freshman Camp, and Footbal ~ames. of Hour Exams and Prom Weekends. And never, ever, enough sleep.

I shall now conclude, hop- ing that the past year has seen, on your part as it has on mine, a real strengthening of the bond betvieen St. Andrews and Union, between Scotland and America, and- that it will grow in the years to come. To each one of you individually, a:hd to Union herself go my sincere thanks for a wonderfUl experience which I shall treasure all my life. tanf]ble and usually inca.lculabl<' \hurr.an factor·· is inevitably the deciding one in all of our really exactly balance the books. To all the people who have made my ·stay at Union a valuable one, I leave a grea:t big golden thank you. We realize that it is the College's obligation to the many who are t:1ankful for their chance to reside in the Village. But we also realize that the college has obligations to its own appearance as well at to the city of Schenectady. We should like to see the necessity of removing the village to make way for the field house, which presents only more reason for clearing this section of campus. \Ve should also like to see the college continue its policy for providing housing for those groups now covered by the sloping roofs of Dutchmen's Vil1age.

Of- ficial action lJy the universities might supply the pl·e- sure to get the needed revisions that might otherwise be allowed to continue lacking a stimulus for change. It stands to reason that a social organization on a college campus should not be requirecl to admit any given person at any time. Conversel.Y neither should they be ob- ligecl to exclude any person from membership on racial or religious grounds. Descrimination by \White Christian\ charters speaks up against the very thing that we call Christian. Happily, however, we believe this to reflect an attitude which our colleges and society m·e trying to out- gTOW. We will also take this opportunity to applogize for run- ning a story that might possibly be old news to many of our readers in the move made by Columbia Univel'sity.

To the surpl'ise of the originator, Pierre Ceresole, the idea caught on so· quickly that within a short time, there were several such camps with increasing attention being given to them, both by those who had taken part and others. The American Friends Service Committee were among the groups that began to take notice, and shortly afterwards started similar ventures in this country and other areas.

Robert Adsit, :\Iarco Clayton, Joseph llull!ug.,r. Letters to the Editor Fort Eustis, Virginia 22 Ap\'il 1953 To the Editor of Concordiensis: . As you may perhaps be aware, I have a son, John, at Union. I;le t.as sent .·hnmP a copy of the March 20th \Concordiensis and one of the a~ticles irritated me so much that I um compelll•d to wt·He you. \\'hlle I am no worshiper of Gen- eral Me Arthur, I fail to understand why a revirw of the progress of weapon-s in a speech by him at West Point, and a plea for further training fm' officers, should send shivers up the back of Columnist Eliot Loshak. He might as well \York himself into a similar paroxysm over a speech by a re- t.nd Fire Chief who summed up the achievrmmts in the evolution of fire fighting equipment. What he ignores <or does not !;now), is that in this country, at least, our armed forces are only called. into action after the war ha::; started or the fire has been dis- covered. War, to pm-aphrase Clause- witz, is the national pursuit of political ob1ectives by other means. Adually, \A's arm<'d might\ is not \thrown against B's armed might\ (in f1:ee countries) until the dip- lomats, and presumably the people, have examined the quest·ion and decided that there is no other solu- tion. thing as \the academic (or scholas- tic mind.\ Are all professors ab- sent-minded? It was a military man (General Sherman)- who set the basic value on war, and it has not changed since with the in- n~ased ldHing power of weapons, although as a source of death and griof it has ·come to run second to the automobile. As long as we, in this country, continue to. slaughter p0ople of aH ages and sexPs at our pres!'nt rate> in \peace it sl'ems somewhat silly to become quite so hysterical about war. In common with many others, I felt, in July 1951, that we had- a moral obligation to arrange for \peace tall>s\ even though there Wf'rC prospects of mHitary victory without that; and I know that General McArthur counted heavily on a successful conclusion of these \talks.\ That such .a -conclusion was not reached is attributable to our adhere>nce to certain .principles which I believe to represent the hest of \Ji thought, among them the dignity and freedom of decision of the individual.

If, indeed, \the whole tradition of liberal education stands on the ~round that in war there is no victory,\ then the \tradition\ needs overhauling. Remember that war is the pursutt of political objectives, and a victory is a decision on the matter·. If there were no victory, in this sense, then this country would still be an English colony without our national tradition of individual freedom; there would have been no settlement of the qu<'slion of slavery, or of the pre- servation of our Federal Union. As an ROTC graduate, this same writer's comments, in the past, on the ROTC seem again to ·be a leap from ''G\ to \Q\ in the alphabet uf reasonin,;. Because some \ma- turQ · men\ t veterans) sneered at the ROTC, he seems to feel that it is out of place in a university. Dis\ regarding the basic facts and meeting this on its own ground, we might say that officers--and offi· cer trainpes--arc unpopular with those who, for one reason or an- other, have become \professional privates;\ many because assump- tion of the responsibilities of an officer would require them to ·fore- go the sense of anonymity and union with the mob. A profes- sional man of any trade, on the other hand, as some of these men undoubtedly had been, always de- precates an \amateur\ or part time participant in his trade. To ignore the value to the country !and 80 percent of the officers of our army carne from the ROTC in World War Ill, I have always felt that this training was very valu- able to the individual in building leadership, in giving education for his service to the nation, in aiding him to save his life (and those of others> when called into active service, and to broaden his mental horizons; as he is inclined to ;study Ins geography better, for example, if he is apt to be required to prac- tice it.

Best wishes for a memorable Par- ents' Weekend. -A. L. G. One Part Wisdom By Eliot Loshak The Colonel's Letter \Ve are pleased to print the letter found elsewhere on this page by Col. Tucke1· but are forced to take issue with it. \Ve do not pmposely print articles intended to irritate 1·eaders and we do not like to consider ourself as a \pulpit for half-truths.\ If J-·ou, Col. Tucker, ignore the fact that disagreemellt is not necessarily a half-tl'llth, then we may begin to dissect your arguments. Starting from the top, it would appear that a speech by a personality so newsworthy as General MacArthur is worth far more comment than a retired fire chief. The text of a retired fire chief's speech was not reprinted the day after as \vas l\IacArtllm's in the \paroxysmic\ New York Times. We wonder, in the third parag1·aph, if the diplomats, and presumably the 11eople, examined the causes for the War of 1812, or the Spanish-American War. It would seem that even v.-ith our tradition of liberal education, it's hard to argue against the historical facts and those facts seem to state quite unequivocally that those wars were for per- sonal and selfish motives. \Ve think that means other than war to settle differ- ences are not \probably\ preferable, but definitely so, and not only from the puinl of three grounds mentioned. \Ve also tend to be cli:-<hcartcnrd hy thE' words \dear-cut vic- tory.\ .Just what i,.; one? \\'e thought we had one in 1918, antl again in 1 fl 1;). Yictory hy force has never heen a last- ing- snlnt illll I>Pt'H u~~· ~i Jl<'e the heg-i nning of time the world has lJl'ell in a C(>!ltii~LI:rl turmnil \\'hieh for('e hR~ only an- noyed and made worse. The analogr drawn in the next paragraph doesn't holfl true. Where the military or the mn·y or anJ-· branch of the armed sen·ice will h•ach the art of war with the express JHil'po,.;•~ of at taiiting \ idur,r til rough superior firepowel' or skill. it is the illh of U1e m·atlL•;nic \\'orlcl to teach what it krl<lws about llwn-r thing·s. The English professor will attempt to tPal'h ~-ou the gTamm:u· of the language and the appreciation uf its great works. A ~hemistry professor will teach what he knows about chemistry in order to train more chemists. And so il goes down the line. It doesn't seem \silly\ to us to become quite so hysteri- cal about war even though the automobile has been taking an increasing toll. Because war runs a close second in total deaths, is that any reason to ignore it or tend to lessen the importance of it as a force in our lives, or deaths'? No, for if we can save a few hunflred thousand lives by not having wars, it's a good thing and we've done something worth \Vhile. As we mentioned in one of our previous editorials, it is an aeciclPnt whrn an automobile causes a fatality, but it is the kill or be killed thesis that is the guiding force behind all military thought. These objectives appear to be in the liberal tradition. Granted that if othe-r means than war had proved possible to achieve these ends, these other means would probably have proven preferable from humanistic, economic, and re- ligious grounds; the fact remains that pass-ions ·were so inflamed as to prevent a successful settlPment by arbitration. Once war has been chosen as the method to achieve a settlement of differences, few people indeed can believe that there is any substitute for a clear c:ut victory-as witness, the present series of job-Jot wars, particulai'ly Korea. One may as well talk of stopping a football game for a negotiated settlement for posses- sion of the sxity-yard line. Being in the st>rvice, I resent ths statement that there is \a military- mind;\ this Is no more true than the statement that there is such a I hope that this outburst may seem to· you something more than the \Gad sir\ of a \Colonel Blimp,\ for this young man needs a bit of straightening out, and I do not thin!' the Concordiensis should be a vulpit for half thoughts. Sincerely, Cary s. Tuclter, Lt. Colonel By Al Jiingon It is in fashion now days to speculate on the inner doings of the Kremlin. ---Countless books, papers, e s s a ys, · and lectures have.··· been concci\\c·d to:· \expose\ the \J eal\ nat we of the ru: .. rs of th Kremlin and \prug-tess\ of the HL\volutioh.

This is very pos- sible because the Mirror photos of Malenkov would break any Man of St<'el ias well ns crack Mirrors.) T!Tc future of Russin seems firm under its n!'w Jead.ership though.

The always under- standing Daily Worker assured me that I had lost one of my only true friends and shared the bur- den of my sadness at the Joss of the old lion. The Daily Worker shared my joy that the ·old rascal bad finally let go. The delirious Dally News was one cheering nevi's blob. The New York Times appraised the situation realistic- ally. So did the Herald Tribune. The Repot·ter realistically ap- praised the difference between ·the realistic appraisals. It se>crr.s a shame that the lora! man mi'ssed all the> C'ditions of the Amnican Pre~s, Vishinsky did not know of Stalin's illness until a dav !at<>, nor of his death until a haif day late. He was a half day late in finding out Malenkov was the new premier, left for the funeral a day late and consequently missed the whole show. The swan, so the myth goes, fin- ishes his life in a blaze of glory, singing prophetically and. beauti- fully en any sub- ject that he an but by osopher, people. ally sp,ealnng, sound of the may be more curately described as a croak, re- sembling a crow rather than a nightingale. Furthermore, the swan croaks very rarely, and his croak- ing is hardly calculated to either inspire or inform anyone of the future. Nevertheless, the myth persists desipte the facts. Old soldiers, outgoing political leaders, dying dramatic heroes, and graduating seniors are all called upon to ape the swan, but not after the facts; rather after the myth. This playing the swan can be very difficult at times, but so long as the listener or reader re- alizes that the swan singer is sup- posed to, but is not necessarily singing beautifully and prophetic- ally, the singer is fairly safe. This; then, is the first of the final series of essays that I shall write in this column. In them, I want to dis- cuss some of the ideas that I con- sider most important for the col- lege student. Ezra Pound called our age one of \accelerated griri1aces.\ I should, like to dwell for- u few moments on the \accelerated'' part of this description. Acceleration means not only getting faster, but getting faster faster. We Americans like ,;peed. Speed is a desirable quality in many things. The faster the L G.

It doesn't seem that his con- tention of a probable military victory was so well founded that we did NOT have to engag-e in the talks. Space doesn't permit more discussion, unfortunately for there are things that still remain to be covered. May we again say that we invite comments to the paper, to the editorials or to the columns. We can be enlightened, even though it is the newspaper's job primarily to edify it's readers, or even straighten them out. One surprising development did emerge. For years I was under the impression that Mr. Luce and Mr. Stalin were to say the least not intimate. But I was proven wrong. Mr. Luce's publications ran 2-1 ahead' of everyone else on the death of the Marshal, its signific- ance, and the future of Russian lt>adership. And it seems that Mr. Luce was really on the \In\ all along brcause in the April 20 issue of Time, his staff reports of a meeting in stalin's private apart- \'t is now almost three months since the Russian ruler died. We knew little of him before, less now. For every book that is printed about him authoritatively, a com- panion piece, just a.s authoritative counters the first hook. In his last act on earth, his death, the old Revolutitlnist put on a most bur- lesque dance macabre. However the venerable old warrior had a point to it all. Since no one really knew what went on In the Kremlin and just had an emotional feeling as to what existed, they had to produce loads of literature to bol- ster that weakening emotional view of the Kvemlin when the · center prop was falling out. They had to .convince themselves, and in doing so, heightened the enign'la that will forever remain unsolved in tha~ unsmiling face iii the Kremlin tomb: His legend Is en- shrined in the glamorous garments of the unknown. \Meet and Eat at Eddie's\' 547 Nott St. Schenectady, N.Y.

The best general is he who \gets there fastest with the mostest men.\ But there are many things in which speed is not only of no particular value, but is a dis- tinct liability. The brewing of beer, for example, is a proces which re- jects speed completely. Are we bet- ter to go through an art gallery as slowly or as rapidly as possible? Grimaces, of course, are better taken slowly than accelerated. It would seem, then, that we are wrong when we worship speed for its own sake. The same analysis. could be made of many other quali- ties and processes. I see this situ- ation as part of the dangerous tend- ency in our thinking to be pure technicians and nothing else. Science, through the technique of extreme specializiation of labor, has gained enormous knowledge and produced equally enormous re- sults. This is because an investi- gator of a certain DC circuit has no need to know anything about the reactiop. between two complex organic compounds. As a matter of fact, such knowledge would prob- ably hinder him because he would then not be able to concentrate completely on the DC circuit. Un- fortunately, however, precisely the opposite situation exists for every branch of knowledge outside of science. People do not behave like DC circuits or like cotT-plex organic compounds. Therefore, the most desirable situation for the \well- rounded\ individual would seem to be as broad and unspecialized a mind as possible. But the fact is that we need technicians to produce the fast automoLilcs and the suc- cessful armies. The solution Beerns to me to lie in the well known \happy ·medium.\ The accelerator must think of what he is acceler- ating and not merel;y ·of acceler- ation alone.

For Professor Jackson had won the sobriquet ·Of \Captain\ ·because of his belief in the advantages of a military education for all. In fact, he had been commissioned a Cap-. tain by Doctor Nott in 1828 when Union received its first Officer Training Unit. It is said that when the college was young and lacked the scienti- fic. facilities .properly to impress a visitor from afar, Dr. Nott often used to invite the visitor to call upon Professor Jackson and to· walk hrough his garden. This pro- duced not only a pleasant impres- sion, but emphasized the beauty and healthfulness of the college situation. Hans Groot's Kill winds through the garden. This stream is \the brook that bounds through Old Union's grounds\ in the college's unique \alma mater.\ Along the· edge of this brook C1J.Il still be seen traces of an ancient Indian trail. The trail passes close by a small spring in the eastern section of the JAMBS Restaurant • GoOOD FOOD at prices you can afford Booth and Fountoin Ser:vice 426 State Street . ' Captain Jack died i.n 1877, but his garden was carried on by his daughter, Mrs. Samuel Benedict, until 1925, when it was taken over by John S. Van Voast, '87, a trustee. Van Voast continued until 1935, and, upon his deatb,. Mrs. Dixon Ryan Fox, wife of ihe late presi- dent, assumed direction of the 27- acre tract. Under her manage- ment, 3,000 daffodils were planted in a single season aJ:Jd nearly 1,000 tulips added from time to time. Some day, perhaps, a. portion of the garden will be dedicated to Mr>s. Fox. It now contains mem- orials to two of its previous care- takers. Kappa Alpha. gave the main gate in memory of Captain Jack, a member of the society and .Alpha Delta Phi financed develop- ment of the evergreen plot as a token of its esteem for Van Voast. Delta Phi Fraternity has con- tributed a handsome sundial located near the present rose gar- den. Henry Kahre is tile present cus- todian of the garden and its ad- joining greenhouse. - Kahre, a taci- turn German, complains bitterly and often about lacl!: of funds and aoout the depredath:ms of youthful vandals who penetrate the rusting fence. He manages, however, to coax forth a dazzling array of blooms each spring and summer. Besides the daffodils, this week-end will find scylla, trillium, mytrle, trout lily, spiderwort, and perhaps a tulip or two blooming somewhere in the garden. - • SUCKS • • ODD TROUSERS • • 1000 PaQ-s U.

'/< Friday, May 8, 1'953 Page Five We Shall Take· All We Can· Get Local Belles Lead Prom Dates From Near -and Far Fraternity date lists for Spring Prom Weekend, turned into the Concordy office this week indicate that, of the 376 females to descend upon the campus this weekend, the greatest proportion will be from Schenectady. Whereas, in past years, Skidmore has led the parade, her 38 representa- tives now take a poor second place to this fair city's 62 rain-drenched delegates to this weekend of utter madness. Other female hangouts have not been overlooked in the mad quest for what some choose to call man's best friend. Russell Sage is sending 21 of its fairest to their possible doom, while Albany State may have an enrollment of 21 less by Monday. Offering top competition to the area belles, we find that Vassar leads its class with four dates, with Mount Holyoke, Smith, and Bryn Mawr following close behind. Phi Sigma Delta, drawing largely from Skidmore and Mt. Ida, has the most dates, 34, Kappa N u by three. As is customary, the young women who will adorn our campus this weekend comes from far and wide. For the second straight time, two young ladies from Nassau, British West Indies win the prize for having travelled the farthest to reach us. . The inevitable jokers turned up on this year's losts, too. Aside from the two D~tchmen who are playing host to cam- pus dogs for the weekend, two others are bringing their dates from \that place\ and from Tanganyika. (Whatever happened to those two girls from \beyond Mars?\). BET A ETA UPSILON Escalante. . . . . . . . . . . . •... Pattie Morris. .. . . . . . . ............ Schenectady Hauser ..................

Founded at Union College in 1877 SCHENECTADY, N.Y., MAY 15, 1953 t. Pictured above are Dick Dolan and Bill Snyder. Each of these men might very well have been chosen as the \Senior Athlete of th<' Y f.'ar'' in the voting heltl by the senio1·s this past Monday and by the remaindei' of the school in today's chapel. Senior Athletes Vie For Contribution Cup The annual All Sports Banquet, jointly sponsored by the Schenectady Junior Chamber of Commerce and the Block \U\ Society, will be held 7:30 p.m. on the 19th of May in the Van Curler Hotel. This event is primarily to pay tribute to the men who in participating in varsity sports this year have earned their letter. An added highlight of the banquet is the presentation of the athletic award cup to the \out- standing senior athlete.\ This cup is given annually to the· this honor by his excellent play- ing in football and lacrosse . The winner will be \'announced and awarded his cup at the dinner. The athletes are not the only ones to receive their just reward here. Members of each team will at this time present gifts to the hard working and too often un- heralded coaches. An entertaining program has been planned with guest speakers among whom are included Ned Harlmess , RPI coach of lacrosse and ice hocl~ey . The affair is open • ·- -- 0 · --- Rev. Cooley Here Sunday The guest speaker at this Sun- day's Chapel will again be the Rev. Frank Cooley. Mr. Cooley's sermon will be headed \I Bring You Life.\ He is at th~ pri.'sent time Field Program Director of the Stud · ent Volunteer Movement, a position which he assumed upon his return from a . period of work in China which lasted from 1945 to November, 1951. Going to China under the auspices of the Interna- tional Committee of the YMCA he was assigned to Pelting for lan- guage study and r e ligious work among the university students . He also taught English at the Na - tional Peking University. He later moved to Chungking w • herP he> worked as an organizer and di- rector for work camps sponsored by the YMCA. He was in Chung- ldng when the Chinese Commn- nists took over and spent his last few months in China under soli- tary confinement in prison. Before going abroad Mr. Cooley was a leader in the New England Student Christian Movement. He has received a B . S . degree from Springfield College in 1!l42 in Physi- cal Education and the Social Sciences and from Yale University, where he received his M.A. for his work in Chinese Language and Literature. He is also an ordainc>d minister of the Methodist Church . letterman, who in the opinion of his college mates, has offered the best performances on the athletic field during his four years at Union . The Polling of the entire senior class took place last Mon - day and the remainder of the student · body cast their ballots to- day in chapel. Unofficial results of the senior class show a tight race between Dick Dolan, Bob Murray, and Bill Snyder; all of whom ar.e followed closely by George Bat- kiewlcz, Gari Clough, Jerry Heinz- man Glen Kinns, and Werner Rei~ers. Among the top trio Dick Dolan has gained his laurels in cross country and track, captain- ing both tea:ms. Bob Murray has ·been a stellar performer in basket- ball, track and cross country; and Bill Snyder won his acclaim to to all students, alumni , and Since his return from China h e friends of the Junior Chamber of has spent a term in a Study Fel- Commerce.

The fraternities will no long e r elect special delegates to the organiza- tion, but the house president will be the fraternities delegate to the council. The reason for taking this action was to stabilize the member- ship of the group, assuring a quali- fied and responsible representative of each fraternity who would re- main the delegate as long as he was president . It was decided that the Brown T:·uphy, donat e d by Phi Sigma Delta Fraternity, whirh will be a warded each year to the frat e rnity with the mo::lt outstandin g record in cXtia-cuni<.:ula activities, athletic achievement, and schola s tic ::ltand- ing, would not be given this year.

True Brotherhood? It l& difficult to belieYe in this day and age that an organization whose membership includes ;-;upposerlly erlu- cated men still clings to a p1·actice of racial and religious intoleran-ce. National frute1·nities have long been criticized for the \White Christian\ restrictions in their charters, and yet they hold to them as a dying man gasping for, his last bt·ea.tll of ail·. l\Iore and more of these cases are being brought up to the public's eye as educated college men realize the stupidity of such dauses and bid men for their fraternities on the basis of personat attributes rather than family background. These bids, which re})l'esent evidence of an increasing attitude, are met in retum by threats and actual expulsions of many of these houses from the national fraternity. Re- cent e:xa.mples of this occUlTed at Williams College with the bidding of a J e\vish bo~· by a \White Christian\ fra- ternity-, ancl more recently at Boston University where Phi Sigma Kappa bid a Negro student. The )n·oblem of forced segregation on our college cam- puses by- the fraternities is a serious one. It fights against the very thing that education attempts to create, that is an individual who is able to think for himself. Clearly these restrictions represent total ignorance in theh· very nature. They do not encourage character estimation upon the basi;;; of the individual himself, but leave it up to the purely arbi- trm·y blind following of raeial and religions origin. An intelligent person must learn to think beyond this in eon- sidering othe1· people. He must not he in the habit of dis- crediting people because of cultivated prejudices. Ignorance breeds distrust and prejudices; education enables us to see beyond this. We must not let education fall short in their aims lJe-(!ause of these national charters. It has been enc0uraging to note the tremendous num- ber of instances whe1·e the men themselves havae gone beyond the national and taken the boys whom they wanted ber of instances where the men thcmseh·es have gone into their house. If the powe1·s of the national wish to con- belie>'€ that those houses which have realized that he1·e the clothes do not make the man, they should divorce them- selves f:r·om that nation<ll o1·ganization. T11e two solutions which we will offer are very simple. Either the national must l'ealize that they cannot continue their attitude of \White Christian\ supel'iority (which is as foolishly based as the superiority of the- Aryan race, which these same men laughed at because they were ex- cluded)7 or the !neal fmternit~· must. having realized the equ;tlit)- of 11ll men, ll!'eak thrir tics with the org·anization that }l!'€ilches in its charter the opposite of this. \\'e are pleased to ohsene that on om campus quite a fe\v of the fratemities have tRken men of the so-called minot·ities. This attitude lms been helped by the HELP Student prog1·am whicl1 has done mueh to fmther under- standing betvveen peoples of different nations and racial groups. In many cases these students have been initiated into tlle fraternit~~. An()ther fador on this eampus which has furthered the no11-segregated fraternity is the basic makeup of Union College. Bein::r a small school, there develops on this cam- pus <t much doser relation:;hi)) lll!lOngst most of the men. With this knowlerlge of other people comes the 1·ealizntion of the ignorance upon which prejudice is based. We do not heliew that individual houses should stand by and he forred h~· nationals to lfmit their .membership, as is n'()w lhe ease in many houses. Phi Sigma Kappa on this can1pns will he ta'kin~ a vote to determine whether or not there is dii-tcl'imination in the national. We hope that they will vote to l'emove any possible intolemnce within the national. Furthermore 1ve should like to see houses on this ca111pus which are unsnnpathetic with the cha1·ter of their national expre8s their feelings towards this by violat- ing tltese restrictive elauses. It is only by the expression of theil' opinion that the masses (the fraternities) may force the ruling minorit~· (the national council) to meet their wisJ1es. The most powerful weapon on this earth is public opinion. -G. R. K. niDAY, MAr 15, 195~ ~---------------------------- 1 For Your Information I I I I Thy Children's C,hor-us I R FRIDAY, MAY 15.

Campus I noon; Faculty Women's Club An- Rosary, Old· Chapel, noon; Jewish By Bans Groot '--------- Professor Bronner has com- plained that last week's column gave altogether too much attention to his curling game and not enough to the fact that he is posssibly the anly living human who has both pitched a no-hit, no-run game and scored a hole-in-one. Bronner observed the 31st anniversary of his ne-hitter while watching Union beat R.P.I., 3-1, on Tuesday. The cc>lebrated perfect game was t wil'!ed for Richfield Springs against Cooperstown in 1922. The hole-in-one occurred-that is the pmper word-on the Schenectady Municipal Course just after the One of Schen0ctady's leading at- torneys would be surprised to learn that he was clocked at 90 miles per hour on Union Avenue the other dny . . . At least, that's the way Art Lawrence tells it . . . And Prexy has had some complaints from th~ police about the event . . . Seems the Betas discovered that the police had rigged a sp1•ed ttap near' Rojansky's and they took pity on motorists by parading with placards warning them of the set- up. Losing interest in this, the wags then took to jumping on rabies at opposite ends of the t1·ap, causing the measuring device to record speeds approaching the ~ound barrier. :{. :(. :{.

As recently as· 1939, the seniors gathered in cap and gown outside :\ff'morial Chapel and paraded to the President's Home, where they offered a senenade {musical), then hpaded up the Lane to rendpr a few numbNs for Charlie Waldron in South College, then on to the Dc'an's House in North College.

' l From Across the Seas ! I t t..--------------------------·--------------------· By Artul'O Ta.nco, Jr. \I shot an arrow into the air, It fell to earth I knew not where.\ Lost islands have ·been discov- ered, lost causes have been re- trieved . . . but like the arrow shot into the air, the art of con- troversy lies beneath the earth, we know not where. The most difficult thing in the world to find today is a well-rea- soned argument. Because so few are thinking, naturally there are few arguing. \Thought is real, thought is dif- ficult,\ says the student, \and thouglat is not om· goal.\ So, why hother\ discussing the relative merits of whether we have a soul or not? BesidPs I have a date at three o'clock! Thought-saving devices are being invented. Catch-words and high- sounding phrases, truisms and quo- tations are substituted for thought. \DePds not v. or\ds\ - becomes \Words. not thought.\ In some casPS, used-up scra'ps of somebody Plse's philosophy are integFated into a v. ishy-washy VI hOle, with the love of novelty usually dictat- ing the choice of scraps to inte- grate. Not even philosophers are argu- ing; they only explain away. A n0w book that comes out full of bod logic and still worse philoso- phies is not refuted by the critic. It i;~ called \fearless bold, excep- tional,\ and praised to high heaven fo!'\ __ its novelty. Henri Bergson came out r\ecently with a dogtr.a stating that the greater came from the less, but he so clouded this intellectual mons t ro s l t y with French verbosity that he has been hailed as ~ great and original thinker. Th-is decline in the art of con- troversy, so important to the sur- vival of any civilization, finds Its roots in the persuasive Pragma- tism of the present-day, the aim of which is to prove that all proofs are useless. Hegel of Germany rationalized e r r·o r; James of America det~ationalized truth. The consequence is an indifference to truth, coupled with a tendency to regard the useful as true, the im- practical as false. Plato cannot be used to earn a dollar, so away with him. Beethoven? a nincompoop who didn't have anything better to do than write notes on a piece of paper. Why, be didn't even have a car! Another manifestation of this in- tellectual hodge-podge, this vacuum in the brain, shows itself in the general readiness of the modern mind to accept a statement be- cause of the literary way in which it is coached, or because of the popularity of the one who says it, rather than for the reasons be- hind it. Novelty is confused with profoundness, so that when Ibsen's two plus two equais five, he is im- mediately besieged with a storm of popularity, while the poor math teacher who is more orthodox is greeted by a chorus of snores from his pupils. T-wo things are demanded of our present intellectuals. The first· con- sists of an i n t e r n a l izing of thoughts, a revival of sound logic and correct thinking. For bad thinking sometimes has worse ef- fects than no thinking. You can kill a man, but not an idea. Think- ers live; toilers die. And so, before anything e l s e c a n b e d o n e, thoughts must first have been born inslde-thoughts, not of trivialities, but of profound problems; prob- lems that rebuild the foundations fol\ these are the things that have crumbled, To accomplish this first objec- tive, there must be silence and contemplation. It is in the still- ness and quiet of one's o·wn in- tellectual pastures where man meditates on the truths of life. The student rray scoff and ridi- cule this, but the fact remains that a discussion of Marilyn Mon- roe in a room does not bode well for- the thinking out of a sol u- tion to a prq,blem !n philosophy. After thinking hard and clean, then the intellectual is faced with the problem of externalizing his thoughts in the concrete world of economics, government, commerce, and education. This in order to help produce a beautiful and clean civilization, for what is civilization but a bequest of thoughts from its great minds. If the thoughts be- queathed have been base, then .the culture is base; if lofty, then the culture is worthwhile, golden with the fruits of right and sound thinking.
