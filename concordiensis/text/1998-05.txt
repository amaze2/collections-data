God's Favorite enjoyed a terribly successful two night run. Shakespeare and music in the gardens, the grand opening of the Theater Department's Marat-Sade. and the dance team all lit up the campus this week. God's Famrite starred the likes of Mike Winn, Adrian MacLean and John Zandman just to name a few from the brilliant cast. Afarat Sade. which began playing yesterday, will continue on until Saturday of this week and will continue next week. God's Favorite was such a hit last week that all involved expect the same turnout if not greater for Marat Sade. One plaguing reminder from last week has been troubling the happy editing staff of A&E. Last week. Mr. David Kay brought the fact to our attention that he has been laying out our section since the beginning of the year put- ting in long. often grueling hours in the Concordy office while receiv- ing no credit whatsoever for his work. Unfortunately, he displayed , this fact in a manner not so pleasant to me and my co-writer. I ; We found out last Thursday that the letter which Mr. Kay put in his j column from a supposed ''anonymous'' author stating that the A&E 1 ..,cction should be more than simply \an advertisement for upcoming I plays\ and that our section was \quite possibly worse than Features.'' j When we asked Mr. Kay who the author was, he replied by stating 1 that he makes up all the letters himself for entertainment value. j This fact disheartened both of us as we were forced to wonder why 1 he would write such a 'hing after we believed him to be part ofthe L:'~\·~~n_il~y_.\ __ _ <i!onc n:rbirnsi s May 21, 1998 ''The voice-overs for the characters boast an all-star ca§1t and complement the fdm surprisingly well.\ J'ncaholllm) in the scarch f11r po- litical corrcctnes,, but rather usc\ a kgendar_:~ tale as a hack drop for the storv. !'he voice-overs for the charac- ters boast an all-star cast and complement the film surprisingly 'lell Pierce Brosnan (of\Bond.

This term, in his fina:l role, TigglewiH beplayingJaques Roux, a radical fevolutionary in- mate in the Asylum of Charenton in William Finlay's production of Marat-Sade. El Carnival by LaSandra Ramos, was the show that tum eo Tiggle on to theater. He was cast his freshman year as a slave and a native. \l didn't have any lines,. but it was a lot of work with move- ment,\ saidTiggle. \This was also a great experience because after El Carnival I knew I wimtedto be involved with the theater in some way.\ His sophomore year Tiggle di- rected A Street Car Named De- sire. \I really liked directing, and I think that's what I'm going to do when I gradua~e. I am far more ben- eficial offstage than acting,\ said Tiggle ofhis first experience with directing. He also worked on the set and stage design of Noises Off that year in his theater produc- tion class. Tiggle' s junior year was a busy one. Fall term, \I had to balance football, my classes, and theater,. so unfortunately I didn't get to do very much outside of my classes.\ Winter term Tiggle as- sistant directed under the super- vision of Professor Barry K. Smith, Tales of the Lost Formicans. \This was a great ex- perience forme. I think the acti11g in that show was the best I've seen. It's a shame.somanypeople were scared off by it. I think Barry really knew how to get the best out of the actors. This is something I have used in my own directing. Many ofBarry 's techniques fo- cus on the actor making choices for themselves. This really helps the actor estab- lish a character. \Sizwe Bansi is Dead.\ This was Tiggle's first experience with an all student production. George and his co-;star Carey Mil~er project. f\igg]e and his assistant director,. Ouey Miller, wanted to put on a piece '~t~ith an all African-Ameri- can cast. They ch<>se Mamma I Want to Sing. \'I wanted to put on a show for the minorities on camp1;1s be- cause I think they do~ 't get as many opportunities to participate in the theater program.\ After A LOT of hard work, Tiggle and Miller pro- duced one of the greatest shows to pass through the walls of the Yulman Theater. \ I was very sur- prised with the outcome of the Ph ole> Rohback fTC I got a lot of lrnowledge from Barry and he re- ally helped meto focus on my se- nior project.\ Spring ter~ of the same year Tiggle was cast as a gentleman in Professor Bill Finlay's produc- tion of B/()od Wedding. George Tiggle: Showering On the Set of Marat-Sade. i play ... it was great to see so many people come be- cause of word-of- mouth. People who we didn't even know came 'out and supported the show because they heard it was good. \I don't per- ceive myself as a great actor'' said Tiggle althC?ugh anyone who has seen this young man would dis- agree. Whileperformingin Blood Wedding Tiggle also performed in Jesse Shaffer's two-man show, perfQR1Jed the piece very success- fully. George's senior year was perhaps the busiest yet. Fall term Tiggle ap- proached his advisor, Professor Finlay, with an idea for his senior I also would like to say thank you to Bill, Charles, Fred, Kim, :and Lori, because with- out their llelp I could not have done it. We really came together as a production unit and made the whole thing happen. Most of all I want to thank the cast.\ This brings us to the present. For George's farewell performance, he was asked by the director and as- sistant director to play Jacques Roux. \I wasn't sure I wanted to do it, but Bill and Carey twisted my arm. I'm really happy I decided to. It's a great show, with a great cast, and a great set.\ Marat-Sade oper:~ed last night and wiU be running through this Saturday. Don't miss this last qpportunity to see George on the Yulman stage. Next year, Tiggle has applied to teach in California. There he has already had interviews with NBC, ABC, and Julian Dykeman Deandres Memorial. \I really wanted to get iNto the entertain- ment scene. This would be a great opportunity to get my foot in the door as a director, and to produce my own shows.\ George Tiggle is an outstanding individual who as contributed im- mensely to theater at Union. \I think we have a very strong pro- gram. For a small college, Union is very fortunate to have so many people who care enough to put so much time and energy into the the- ater. I would especially like to thank Bill Finlay. He has been very helpful in my theater career at Union.\ Tiggle at- tributes much of his success to his \faith in God.\ Trust in him and there is nothing you can't accom- plish.\ A&E wishes this young man the best of luck. George Tiggle is a bright and talented young man, we know he's going places. Spring in Fraiburg, Garmany?

This year, for the first time in several years, Springfest will also feature the new and improved UnionCollege Dance Team. The dance team is the brain- child of freshman Nidhy Paulose and sophomore Monet Warren. The team, which was previously a major club at Union, had been out of existence for several years. Paulose, who had always enjoyed dancing, although had never taken fonnallessons, decided she wanted to sta11 it up again. After speaking to Warren, a ma- jor player in the Union dance scene, the two, with help from Senior Nicole Graham, who had been on the team her freshman year) began to write a constitution. Because the club had not been active for four years, it was consid- ered \dead\ by Student Activities and tbe two had to write a new con- stitution. The constitution had been • f ? submitted to .the Student Forum and Want more imonna.tion. Talk to Prof. Kellenter (HU213, phone will be presented at the next Forum #621 . orProf. Thomas in the Terms Abroad Oflice. meeting. ~~~~~~~~~==~ In order to attract members, the girls put up signs regarding an in- formation~tl meeting. They had twenty-tJne women show up at the meeting. All ofthose women have stayed with. the team and worked together to get ready for the first performanc~ of the Union College Dance Team, which will take place outside this Saturday. Their da11ce style has been de- scribed as llip-hop with jazz and modern dan(;e influences. They will be dancing to \If' and Brooklyn Bounce\ this weekend. The chore- ography has all been done by the students, including, Warren, sophomore Janelle Hamick,junior AmandaLavtrence, freshman Chris- tine Vines,. and freshman Meghan Mumford. Most oft11e team members have had some sort of dance training. They have either been on teams or have taken lessons. many are in- volved in the dance program at Union. The team has been open to anyone, experience or not. In order 1o get money for cos- tumes and CJther expenses, Alexis Francese wrote a proposal to the IEG committee and the team was approved for funding. In the future, the Dance Team has plans to dance at all major College events; including Homecoming Weekend, Parents Weekend, Win- ter Carnival and Alumni Weekend. They would also like to plan their own concert, as well as dance in the Winter Dance Concert. They are also looking into the possibility of traveling to other schools to perform. However, their first priority is to get Union accli- mated to and excited about the Dance Team. While they would like to dance at Home football games, they want the school to know and understand that they are not cheer- leaders. There are \no pompons in this group\ says Paulose em- phatically. The team is also looking to hire a coach to choreograph for them, They would like to find someone with other styles, possibly modern dance. While they have been looking to Miryam Moutillet, visiting guest artist in dance, she has not been a direct influence on the team. The only drawback the team has been finding is that they have been met wHh skepticism from the school. T.hey feel as though people have not been taking them seri- ously, but rather, looking at them like, \little girls in skirts.\ One thing is for sure, this Saturday, on the lawn, the dance team in ready to be taken seriously.

You may be wondering why I by Jeffrey Ausfeld Staff Writer There are two types of modern scanning devices. The first is a hand held scanner and the second is a flat bed scanner. Both work exactly the same, but in the hand held one, your arm moves the beam of light. I have tried hand held scanners and they just don't work for things that are bigger than the scan width, i.e. no wider than a photograph. As you can guess, I don't recommend them. Flatbed scanners are much like copy machines in the way that the image is captured from the paper. The difference is in the optical re- ceiving. A flatbed scanner cap- tures images in a two-step process. First, a horizontal light source run- ning the full width of the sqmning plate passes underneath the item to be scanned. This light source, in the good scanners, is a cold lamp also known as cold scanning. This is unlike a hotocopier which uses a much hotter lamp as a light source. As it turns out, the cold scanningroethod picks up color in much higher resolution. The dif- ference is that instead of a light- sensitive drum, the brightly illu- minated image retlects back onto a charge-coupled device (CCD) containing numerous light detec- tors. This illuminated light is not just a bright light. When it is re- flected off the surface of the pic- different wavelengths of white a row and so do CCD chips.

The computer then arranges CCD looks like a checkerboard the bytes in tile order in which they that has a focusing film that is just above the surface of the checker- board. When the light hits the film, it is collected and focused into many small beams each with dif- ferent light intensities. Each beam is focused in a way as to have each beam land in the nearest checker- board block. . Now imagine that all the pieces on the checkerboard were to move to one edge but in a very unique method. Each row of checker pieces moves forward to the next row all at the same time. This co- ordinated effort is in exact time, as if a person were blowing a whistle every second. Each time the whistle blows, the row of checker pieces advances forward. What happens to the row that is already at the edge of the checker- board? As you probably know, a were received. Then, by using the light wave frequency from the light source, the image is con- verted into something that looks very familiar. Depending on the software you are using to operate the scanner, the data is either displayed on your monitor or saved as a file 011 your hard disk. The CCD can convert light to organized data by distin- guishing the varying strength and quality of light focused onto the detectors or checkerboard blocks. Typically, an analog-to-digital converter on a single CCD is ca- pable of handling 256 colors (8- bit). Therefore, a color scanner wouJCi normally have three 8-bit CCDs stacked together, each coated with a colored filter (red; gree11, .and blue) providing 24-bit capability. Josh Chaplin Senior Class Representative Dear Class of 1999 ~nd Union College, In case you don't know me, my name is Josh Chaplin and~ want to represent our class on the Student Forum. During my first three years as a Union student, 1 have had many, many experiences: I think that I can draw from thesc; experiences and use them to properly represent our class in our senior year at Union. For example, over the past two years I have been an active participant in the activities of the Student 'Forum and more specificaliy our class. I have sat at countless tables selling everything fwm Turkey Dollars and Springft::st paraphernalia to hospital pants and tulips. I have helped with the organization of many events, including helping to host a Dialogue on Race and the very suc- cessful Winter Carnival. I have made myself familiar with the Forum and how it works. B'ut, more importantly, I have made myselffamiliar to the other members-of the Forum. I feel am a voice that will be heard. I think I have many applicable attributes for a Senior Class Officer Representative. I am a proven leader; this was demonstrated by my success as a Resident Assistant this year, and my selection as a Head Resident Assistant for next year. But my leadership was also shown in my attempt to halt tlle schedule change process this fall. In the fall, although it may have seemed that again the student voice went un- heard, I know it didn't. The administration took notice of the more than 700 signatures C()llected in just a few days. The point was made. I will continue to ensure that the student body, more specifically our class, is represented properly and with quality. There is one more important aspect ofmyselfthat I would bring to the class office if elected, I have tremendous desire to workhard for our class, and get things done. I will be fran~ with you; I very much want this position, I want to make Union the best place it can be, I want to have the greatest impact I possibly can here, I want to be the part of the decision-making process. Class ofl999, I wantto represent you. I would like to wish all of my fellow candidates the best of luck tomorrow. I would also like to encourage the student body to vote. Thank you. Sincerely, Joshua Chaplin I

Kobe Bryant, what experts call '' -~~- next Jordan,\ may lack some respect and leadership abilities, but he attracts the type of excit- ing play the NBA needs more of. Bryant is o11ly 19, yet the future of the NBA falls in his hands when Michael leaves. With players like Iverson, Hill, Duncan, Van Horn, and Walker, the NBA is ready to take off with or without Michael. Thus far, NBC should be extremely happy with the potential Finals Match- up: Michael vs. Kobe. The Lakers and the Jazz are underway with their series in the West and on the East coast Indiana is trying to stop the Bulls win their sixth title in the 90's. A !though the Jazz em- barrassed the Lakers on Saturday with a 35 point win, Del Harris and his team will be ready for ac- tion and are sure to bounce back and come out very strong. They have a superb team and with effort should be able to take control and wear out the aging Jazz. The Lak- ers have a bench that is extremely strong and will be able to out-play the bench ofthe Jazz. Van Exel, Bryant and Campbell have been playing very well and will be able to control the bench of the Jazz which includes, Eisley Ostertag and Carr. With one el)lbarrassing loss under the belt, the Lakers will not Jet it happen again. The Lak- ers will not be able to win the next four in a row, but look for the Lak- ers to beat the Jazz in six games. The Jazz are a very good team, but ons to dismantle the Jazz. John Stockman and The Mailman are done delivering ancl their time is over. On the ~ther coast, The Coach ofthe Year, Larry Bird, will not be able to St()p the charging Bulls. The Bulls are simply a better team, they may not have the depth the Pacers have, but they don't have Michael Jordan, or Scottie Pippen or even Dermis Rodman. When you put th(')se three on the same team, they are hard to stop. The only weal<:ness the Bulls have is a center. Luc Longley is never talked about as a powerful center, and never mentioned with names like Ewi OL uam Robins or the help from their bench. They need scoring from Jalen Rose, An· tonio Davis, and Travis Best. If these three players play consis- tently well throughout the series, they have a chance at beating the Bulls. However, as we saw against the Knicks, the Pacers bench is not as consistent as Coacn Bird needs them to be. I look for the Bulls to win this series in seven. The only team that has a chance of beating these magical Bulls are the Lakers. The Lakers, seeded third in the West, will be able to overtake the number one seeded Jazz and roll into the NBA finals. Not only are many fans rooting for the 'al Bu David Stern may be dying to keep Michael, but he must realize that the league is ready to let him go. Jordan has stated he wants to exit the NBA in his peak days, not on the way down. Michael Jordan will be missed, and he attracts crowds, like the NBArecord 62,046 in Houston, but there are players who are ready to try 'to take over. The Bulls will fall to the Lakers in six games imd Jordan will most likely exit on this sour note. He won't be remembered for losinghis last game, but instead for bringing the NBA back to life, something none of us will forget, especially David Stem. There Is No (;(O;I'' In Flynn Profile of Cross-Country / Track Star Peter Flynn by Jason Everett Staff Writer Determined, tenacious, perse- vering, modest, and leader are five adjectives that can be used to de- scribe junior Peter Flynn of the cross-country and track teams. Flynn, of Newton Massachusetts, has compiled quite a resume of ath- letic achievements nearing the end of his third year at Union. Despite being virtually ignored by the track program at Union during recruit- ment of his senior year in high school, Flynn quickly made a name ofhimselfupon entering Union in fall of 1995. The Mechanical Engineering major and English minor has been running competitively since his junior year at Newton North High School. Flynn was primarily a wres- tler in high school, but committed himselffull-time to track and cross- country his senior year. Flynn has competed for the Dutchmen every semester he .has been at Union with the lone exceptions being his sophomore year when he went to Zimbabwe and missed indoor track and his junior year when he missed cross-country when he traveled to the Czech Republic. Flynn had an exceptional rookie campaign for the cross-country team his first term at Union. Flynn finished consistently as the num- ber tvm finisher for the squad and even led the team in a few meets. Although he could have dwelled on his fine performances at the NCAA Regionals or the Capital District Cllampionships, when asked what the highlight of fresh- man cross•.country season, Flynn commente<l that it was merely \ ... running, at the collegiate level for the fist time that was most Union track team his freshman year. In his first indoor season ever, Flynn terrorized opposing runners with his tenaciQus finishes and blazing speed. In what was a performance for the ages in the in- Jason Everett/TC Peter Flynn en route to winning the 5K at the UCAA Championships this past outdoor season memorable and turning what is usually an in:dividualized sport into a team sport.\ Although Flynn has been a key member oftbe track team every sea- son he has run for Union, Flynn made his irndelible mark on the door State Championships at Hamilton, Flynn had what can only be described as a specta:cular meet. Flynn scored in the open 800m run- ning a 1:57, anchored the second place distance for the J!ledley team, ran a breathtaking l :57 anchor leg on the 4x800m relay where he walked down a runner in the final stretch to win the Championship, and duplicated that effort ten min~ utes later in the following event on the 4x400m relay to capture a medal for that squad. In addition to having a spectacu- lar State meet, Flynn consistently ran under two minutes for the 800m his freshman year and along with then junior Nick Conway, formed a formidable one-two punch in this event. This dynamic duo fed off of each other both in meets and in practice and it is probably no coin- cidence that Flynn has not equaled his freshman year form in the 800m with Conway graduating and no longer practicing with Flynn de- spite his being now an assistant coach with the team. Flynn com- mented that his highlight of indoor track was clearly the relays at States. Upon speaking with Flynn, he did not dwell on his individual accomplishments and put the fo- cus back upon the team. \[Win- ning the 4x800] showed that work- ing hard as a team pays off. The efforts of eacl) individual were very important. Nobody could be over- looked.\ Flynn followed his indoor cam- paign with an impressive outdoor season. Flynn again placed in the 800m in states and the 4x800m team of Flynn, Conway, Seth Rudin and Mike Leding continued their State dominance in the event walking away with the race, winning by six seconds in a time of7:52.

Sports Flynn· Continued from page 18 .. Flynn entered h_is sophomore 'year hoping to b1,1ild upon his freshman year success, but adver- sity would h,ithim almost immedi- ately. He was stricken with a se- vere knee injury thatpreventedhim from training with the team and furced him to train in the pool for the majority of the .season. Despite having to use an unor- thodox training regimen, Flynn had an exceptional season leading the team to its best State performance ever. The team finished sixth in the StateChampionshipsand followed this up with a. top ten fin ish at Regionals. Flynn commented, \It was nice to do well as a team that year. We got sixth at States and even though we got sixth, as far as we were concerned we won that meet. The support we showed for eachotherwasthe key. That's what being on a team is a)l about. We were the loudest ones cheering and we got sixth, not frrst.\ Flynn again neglects to point out that he was named to the \All-State Team\ along with Conway. Despite the Jack of actual running during the season at practice, Flynn ran sev- eral impressive races and ran con- sistentlyunder27 minutes for 8k. When asked to comment on Flynn, :XC coach Charlie Casey had nothing but superlatives to say. \Besides being a great team leader, Pete's one of the most coachable runners we have had. When he had his injury he was very good about being sensible about it and what he ,did was not , so much for the good of Peter Flynn but rather for the good of \\ the team .. Patientand confidant are how I would describe him. Patient in that he sets a sensibk pace in races and despite other runners going out faster, he is patient in knowing he can out last them and is confidant that he can do it. He wasalsopatientwith his injury. He w~s in the pool for more than a month without any 'dry land' run- ningfor more than a month except for meets and it is just incredible that he had the patience to put up with that and prevail not only with · Gl:111Unrbitn•is • May 2 t~ 1998 • Page 19 the injury bu:tto run well after .. · wards. He is a great competitor; He bas a great demeanor and as a coach is one ·of those runners whom you can J?Ut a lot of faith in for the good he can do for the team,\ - Flynn missedhis sophomore in- door campaign due to traveling to Zimbabwe for a term abroad. Flynn commented on this experidnce sa,x- ing, \Despite . having to· sac\!. ·~ rifice the op~· · portunity to - compete in track, Ihadan extremely fun learning expe- rience in Zim ... babwe. Being able to travel around and see things from a differ- ent point of view ... traveling around gives you a better view of the world and in- , sight into your own life.\ Flynn re- turned to Union and was geared up in myJimes. All things considered .· thoug~ • .it WaS not that bad of a season. To do really well though one has to dedicate oneself for the whole year..\ Flynn went abroad again this past fa! I to th~ Czech Republi~ and commented that \The past two years I could not train as hard as I would have wanted to due toterms abroad bufthe expe~ience made up \[There is] no question Flynn was well versed in track coming here from high school. He made a major impact his freshman year and has continued to do so. He is an out- standing middle distance 111nner and is one of those kids who you want ten more .of. He is one ofthe most competitive kids I have seen on track. He is a hard worker and sets a great example both. on the field and off of it.\ CottreH, looking for- ward to next year said, \My goals for Pete next year is for him to get back up to his level of com- petitiveness freshman year and improve on it. .. l think he will.\ Flynn along with Hugh Meyer will be the 'leaders of the XC team with the graduation of previous MVP's in 1997 and 1995 D a v e Kusel man and Jay Goldberg this coming season. When asked what his goals are forhis final Kelly Jamieson I TC - to get back to business with the outdoor track team picking up where he left off the .previ- ous outdoor season. De- spite,bei<ng r-e- covered from his earlier knee injury and ran a stel- lar 5 mile road Peter Flynn and Nick Conway running through the snow at the 1996 XC State Championships leading the team to its best finish ever cross-country season Flynn spoke of\his\ goals, but they stressed team rather than personal hopes. Flynn race .in 26:13 at :the beginning ·of the season, Flynn's lack of \base training\ due to being able to un- able to train as bard as he would have liked to while abroad came to play. Althougll Flynn showed flashes of his ability, he was un- able to overcome this lack in train ... ing. Flynn commented, \I knew I wouldn't be up to where I had been the yearbefore. That was reflected for whatever sacrifices I made.\ Upon returning to Union for win- ter track, Flynn had a somewhat successful season and narrowly missed a medal in the 5k in states finishing seventh. Flynn contin- ued his development in outdoor track in this event and ran a sea- sonal best 15:34 at the UCAA Championship at Hamilton. Track coach Lany Cottrell said, commented that he wants to \lead the runners on the team and to train with them trying to instill in them what it means to be a team and work together.\ On a personal level, Flynn said that he simply wants to \come out of every race thin king that I ran the best possible race and did as much as I could have. In indoor and out- door I would like people to start ... thinlci11g tbat they are on a team and wltatthey are doing is best for the team and not just bestforthem- selves. We had a lot of success my freshman year because we kind off<lcused on doing well in the re- lay$ aud that got us into the team m indset a11d any success that came individually we just saw as an added bonus.\ L()oking back upon his three years -ofcompeting for Union track and XC, F:lynn commented, \I have . defiEitelyleamed from every suc- cess :~md failure that I have had. It has made me a more knowledge- able runner. :f have enjoyed com- petillg a1 the collegiate level as we U as being able to travel the world.\ In addition to competing for the eros s-C()Uiltry and track teams, Flynn hasheen amemberofWells House.tlrepast two years, has par- ticipated o11the Union College Or- chestra for three years and has re- cently begun serving on the Stu- dent Athletic Committee. Flynn undoubtedly represents the best of a well-rounded .college student with his plethora of activities. Ove.r the past thret years, Flynn hasbeena fixture in the Union track and cross-country programs. His work ethic has paid large dividends in firm,ly establishing himself as a force to be reckoned with in what- ever event fle has set his mind to. Whether it has been 8k in cross- countly, the 800m, 1500m, or 5000m, Flyn11' s tenacity and competitive- ness has firmly established himself as a force in the state. With his senior year closing in on him look for Flynn t() lead an up-and-com- ing cross-c<>untry team again to competitive1)ess and in the process look for FJ)i'nn to return to domi- nance. Track N()tes: Several members ofthe U11ion track and field team competed at RPI's \last chance qualifier meet\ this past Sunday including Flynn. Flynn competed in the 800m for the first time this season and ran a 2:03. Also com- peting \Vas senior Mike Martin in the longjump, Chris Strohsahl in the 200m. and Martin Knapp in the open 400m. Knapp, trying to break the elusive 50 seconds barrier, came up just short running several tenths shy of 50 seconds. COME INTO MOTO PHOTO FOR SUPER SAVINGS! &henectady -1041 State Street- 382-5776 -

The topic of his talk was Israel at 50, recognizing and celebrating the goldertanniversary oflsrael's in- dependence. Hespoke for approximately one hour, an~· a rec~ptian was held in , Hale House afterwards. There- cepti<m was open to the public, and Wiesel signed autographs, allowed pictures, and spoke with anyone who wish.ed to. speak with him. Wiesel weaved his message using an intricate combination of ,. history and sentimentality mixed with hllmor and vibrant story-tell- mg. Tlte night ran smoothly, with the Union community and th.e surrotmding community coming Ol!t i·n latge numbers to hear the talk. \It was a tremendous talk,\ said ?resident Hull. Professor Berk, noted for his tremendous background on the Holocaust echoed a similar sentiment \It went very well. He is one of the greatest men of our time.\ Shelly Shapiro and Diane Freer, repFesentatives from Holocaust Surviv()rs and Friends raved about Wiesel's talk as well. \It was so moving and inspiring. He did Vlhat he does best; he's a teacher and a story- teller.\ Monica Greenman, President of Hillel, a Jewish student group on campus was disap- pointed with the lack of communication be- tween Hillel and the Speaker's Forum, the group that brought Wiesel to campus. \I was disappointed that Hillel was not contacted to help with the event .... Hillel could have shared in the success of this fabulous event.\ Aside from this flaw, she found the night to be \an unbelievable event.\ ers, including John Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. and noted that all four were killed as a result of fanaticism. He noted the inci- dent in Israel, during which a fanatic at- tacked praying Mus- lims ina mosque, kill- ing 34 people while they were praying. This, he said, is the greatest danger, and he called the fight against it \the most necessary of fights.\ Wiesel's talk was a reflec~ion on Israel -- its beginning, exist- ence, purpose, and future. He sp,oke of Finally, he spoke of his favorite phrase, \and yet.\ To him, it is the classic phrase to link all good with all bad, and a re- minder that with the good comes the bad. He stressed the im- Obtained from http:/fw\'w .achievement.org/autododpage!wieOpro-1 Elie Wiesel. portance of hope in times with such despair. \There must be hope, and yet there is de- spair.\ the tenacity of the Jewish people and explained that Israel goes be- yond politics and must be looked at in a metaphysical sense in order to fully understand it. \I don't believe Israel and the Jewishpeople are su- perior; nor are they inferior,\ \I don't believe that Israel and the Jewish tradition is superior; nor is it inferior,\ he said. He moved on to one ofthe main points of his talk, when he dis- cussed his belief in respect, and how we must respect each other, not just toleration of others. He discussed this and moved on to discuss the history of Israel since its independence in 1948 and the tragedies of this century. He spoke of the assassinations of Anwar ei-Sadat and Yitzhak Rabin and asked \What century is this?\ He spoke of the assassinations of other great 20th century lead- During the reception that fol- lowed in Hale House, Wiesel was asked if he could tell one thing to cellege students everywhere, what W()uld it be? Wiesel eloquently replied, \to fight fanaticism and in- difference,\ a fitting lesson from a man that has done so much to change this world. The Year in Review Wiesel Leadsl .. ife Combining Tragedy with Peace by Aileen Quigley Eilitor-ilz-CIIief Emerita Nineteen hundred and ninety seven to nineteen hundred and ninety eight. For the Union Col- lege community, this has been a year marked with solidarity and estrangement, action and apathy, giving and taking. Nevertheless, these past 12 months have been more than just another example of the old adage \you win some, you lose some.\ If progress is only achieved when mistakes are treated as leaming opportunities, it is imperative to take a look back at the events of this year and see what could have been handled betterand what was done well. In incorporating these insights into our lives and applying them in the future, it becomes apparent that perhaps just as much of our edu- cation takes place outside the classroom as in. Many issues surfaced this year !hat required the student body to raise its collective voice in favor or inoppusition fa11tenn brought w1th it debaie over the schedule changes, the alcohol policy, and the Student Forum budget situation. It was unclear those 20 weeks ago whether getting up earlier on cer- tain days and going to class on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays would wreak havoc on the lunch- room traffic jam f.. We resented what felt like swallowing what was being given us, and that we hadn't been fairly represented in the decision. Looking back, we have adapted to the lunch lines. and can now set our alarm docks for that extra day ofthe week. In the process; a common block of time exists during which meetings like the French table now take place, faculty members hold office hours, and committees get together to conduct business. Over- all, it was clear that, while students can adjust to-change, they want their voices heard in decisions that d i- rectly affect us. The alcohol policy was another salient issue addressed during fall tenn by the student body and ad- ministration. This discussion came into the forefront in the wake of stu- dents hcing taken to Ellis Hospital for alcohol. During a Crosstalk, some students felt that alcohol consumpti()n on the campus was too significant to the social atmo- sphere, particularly in fraternities, to be curtailed and controlled by the administration. However, oth- ers argued that the real issue was not Union's official policy about drinking but rather the lack of per- sonal responsibility of the stu- dents to regulate their own con- sumption. This issue was also ad- dressed at a 'working lunch' with the Trustees, during which past and present members ofthe Union community tried to come up with a workable compromise or solution. We have since seen sober mem- . hers of fraternities and sororities monitoring their own parties. In addition, all members ofthe houses have participated in TIPS training and GAMMA has advocated re- sponsible drinking while partying. The fraternities of Phi Delta Theta and Phi Gamma Delta announced .their nationa-l decision to go dry in the next several years.

Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor who lost many family members in Nazi concentra- tion camps, has long been recog- nized for his efforts to advance the catJse of human rights, largely through the establishment of the Elie Wiesel Fow1dation for Human- ity. He has authored many mem- oirs and has been, since 1976, the Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities at Boston Univer- sity. Born in 1928 in the small Transylvan,ian town of Sighet, Wiesel grew up in a close-knit Jew- ish community. During the ftrSt fC\\ years of World War II, the villag.: CvntmueJ un puge 5

However, some background can be given as to what th~ next steps might be. l'he SAC voted to de- cide whether or not they will en- dorse the Sophomore Rush pro- posal that was drafted by the fac- ulty ofthe College. If they do not support the proposal, it will be dropped until the faculty or some other organization brings it up again for reevaluation. Their decision is based on many things. They gathered data from other colleges who implemented the Sophomore Rush system. They spoke with students to obtain their ideas and feelings on the subject. Two open forums also gave insight to the students opinions, the Crosstalk and the Coffeehouse. The student representatives from the SAC also reached out to their constituents to hear theirthoughts on the issue.

Williams and Schmick both knew members on the Cemm:ission, and became awareofthe opportu- nity to nominate the stud~nts through them. \Rachel and Beth both affected people both ()n and off campus,\ said William~. Gra- ham was honored for her work with COCOA House and Wierz:bieniec was honored for her work on Dia- logues on Race. Graham founded the pro;gram in to Achievement, and it prov-ides academic and social opportuttities to Hamilton Hill students each week. Dialogues on Race was a month long program designe;d to inform, educate and provoke con- versation and thought about race on this campus. Both Wierzbieniec and Grallam were excited about their awards. Both Wierzbieniec and GraiJam stressed that they did not do their work to win awards. \It was a.g:reat ever, \Yes the COCOA House will continue after I graduate. Al- though, the succ' ss and survival ofthe COCOA House requires spe- cial dedication and support from the Union community. I've re- cently pinpointed several capable and willing individuals that will be the future leaders of the COCOA House. Indeed, the future of this program looks bright from here,\ Graham responded when asked about COCOA House's future. W'eeklong Springfest Rocks Union by Mil<e lger . Colllributing Writer This past Friday, Union kicked off its week long Springfest with the showing .of Scream on West Beach, sponsored by the Film Committee. Hundreds of students turned out for this event which set the tone for an extremely success- ful week. One of the goals of Student Ac- tivities was to get the entire cam- pus involved in sponsoring activi- ties that all could take part in. On Saturday, May 16, FJJI hosted a charity volleyball tournament whose proceeds went to Big Broth- ers/Big Sisters. Over $500 was raised for the organization. That same day, Smith House en- tertained the campus wi-th Jazz Fast. A number of bands, com- posed of Union students, played new and old tunes, while listeners lounged in shade or tossed a Frisbee in the warm sun. This beau- tiful weather would continue throughout the week, allowing for all students to enjoy each outdoor event.

They, along with Timmy Love and Reflex, set the stage f<>r the days final guest, Otis Day and Knights. Over 650 students ven- tured to West beach to listen the sounds of these bands. A good day was had by all; once again the Frisbees were flying while others chose to lay out in the sun and just take in the music. Timmy Love and Reflex was spon- sored by Peer Facilitators in order to promote cultm .tl diversity. The other two bands were spon- sored by the Concert Committee, who worked for over three months to bring Union these quality bands. Along with all of the other clubs and organizations on campus, Stu- dent Activities was able to coordi- nate an extremely successful day. Brian Roache, Vice President of Social Life, expresses his \thanks to everyone who came out, and hopes that next year goes as smoothly.\

The Freshman Class for next year is somewhat sim i:lar yet d:i fferent from previous years in various ways. To begin, 3600 students applied forthe:520 spots available. 520 was the llUln- ber determined by the Office ofln- stitutional Research. This group works in association with the President's office. Tiley examine how much space wiU be available from students going on term abroad as well as the number that is graduating to determine11low many spaces should be available to the incoming Freshmen. They also look at the exact number of faculty that is employed in an at- tempt to keep the faculty to stu- dent ratio stable. This appl ic<mt pool of 3600 is the largest it has been ia years. The admissions committee selected 1730, which equates to 48% of the applicants. The staff of admissions hoped that around 500 of those accepted would enroll so that they would be able to go to the wait-list for some students. However, this was not the case. Five hundred and sixty-five of the accepted students enrolled. This prevented admis- sions from choosing any of the seniors who were on the wait-list. Asians, 5% Hispanics and 5% Af- rican Americans. The percentages listed above are the highest in the · college's history. In addition, these figures are higher than most ofthe competition that Union faces from schools such as Hamilton and Cornell. The admissions staff stresses that dch diversity is hard to obtain for a small schooL They feel that · they work very hard to expand the • horizor:~s of the school and make the school attractive for minorities. They also want to emphasize that the incoming class is very talented. · The average SAT I scores are in the mid-1200's and at least half of them are in the top lO% of their graduating high school class. The declared majors appear to be very similar to past years. Thir- teen percent registered for engi- neering, 12% for humanities, 40% for natural sciences, 22% social sciences and 13% are undecided. The socioeconomic aspect of the class is also impressive because over 55% of the students will re- ceive financial aid. Although this costs the school a lot ·Of money, it is deemed a good investment be- cause it allows those from lower income families to attend a privi- · leged institution with assistance from the government and the col- lege.

The hijackers were aU Indian citi- zens:. This is yet another sign of the escalating tensions between India and Pakistan that have been att:he forefront of the international stag~e since India conducted nu.CL.ear1estsonMay II forthe first time: since 1974. India and Pakistan are no strang- ers to each other, as they have fou~ht wars three times over the past fifty years, one in 1948, one in 19.S5, and the last in 1971. Pakistan has reiterated its right to defend , itsel·f and their nuclear future is cun.ently unknown and ungov- emecd as they are not bound to the sarne laws thatgovem other coun- tries' nuclear programs. Pakistan and India both are not sign,atories of the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty, a treaty that regttl!ltes the nuclear capabilities ohh eir member nations. Reaction from the international community was resoundingly negative with Chilu, Germany, and the United States joining Pakistan in their criti- cism . l'be United States is currently un<lec ided as to whether or not it will' impose sanctions upon India. In l!i s weekly radio address, Presi- dent Clinton noted that \India has put itself at odds with the intema- tion al community over these tests:.'., The admissions staff is proud to acknowledge tbat 32 states are rep- resented in the Freshman Class along with 12 cuuntries. Tl1ese numbers are similar to the figures from recent years. However, admis- sions indicated that the minority population 111 the incoming class is greater than it has been in previ- ous years. The class consists of 5% In closing, the admissions staff wanted to express that they per- ceive that Union is doing well as an institution. They are pleased with the applicant pool and anx- iously look forward to the fall when these students can become a part of the Union College community. !his past Winter term, Union Colle.ge held its second term --------------------------1 abro.ad program in Bombay, India.

Itisun- OSSl y . eel e S ate kn()~n at this point ir the recent troubles in South Asia will affect the planned tenn in India for Win- ter 1999. As it stands now, thetenn is still scheduled. Nothing has been officially discussed to alter the term. Professor Gajjar, the fac~ ulty advisor for the tenn; reinforced that tile term was not going to be cancelled. \The problems between Pakistan and India are almost al- ways in the Kashmir area, and the program is in Bombay,\ he said. Professor Thomas, head of the Union's Term Abroad Program emphasized that the trip will go on unless the State Department has released an official warning against travel in the given country, which they have not done. That is the policy that is endorsed by Presi-, dent Hull and the rest of the col- lege. \We tend .to go if students and parents want to,\ Thomas re- marked. When asked about the upcomin.g term, he continued \we've got all summer. .. it's a bit premature.\ \If we were going in the Fall, we would consider it more seriously,\ he said cautiously. The college has been very reluc- tant to cancel terms in the past. The Fall 1990 term in Israel was can- celled because of the danger and controversy surrounding the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Aside from that, Thomas could not recall a term that had been officially can- celled. Students have opted to come home from terms, however. Last Fall, nine students chose to come home and not attend the term in Israel because of the rash of ter- rorist attacks that occurred right before the term was to begin. Jun- ior Emily Becker, a junior, chose to come home after flying to Europe and traveling around France and Spain. \We got a phone call in Barcelona from a friend's parents, and our parents just didn't feel comfortable,\ she said. \It was a very on the spot decision ... we came home the Saturday before the Union term was to begin.\ \The college was very r.eceptive to us,\ she continued \we Were all let in to ·au the classes we wanted.\ Junior Adam Deutsch was one of the ten Union students that decided to stay in spite ofthe warnings. He, too, was worried .about the bomb- ings, and even had a .plane ticket to come home, but instead chose to stay. \I'm not missing this op- portunity\ he thought to himself while making the decision. \lfthere was another bombing after I got there, I was coming home,\ he con- tinued. \It's a different way of life over there.\ Thomas also said that students came home from Athens one year after a series of earth- quakes, and that a National Health Services trip was cut short in the 1980's because Poland closed its borders, where the group was scheduled to go. However, aside from the Desert Storm Israel trip, no term has been officially can- celled. Students scheduled for the 1999 India term expressed the same cau- tious viewpoint as Thomas did. The attitudes of two students ac- cepted to the 1999 term reflected this attitude. Sophomore Stephanie Sienkiewicz said, \De- pending on what the circumstances are, I'll have to see,\ when asked if she still planned on attending. Sophomore Ellen Taylor com- mented \I'm going to wait see what happens this summer before I make a decision.\ Junior Emily Morse, a partici- pant on the 1998 term, said she \would definitely put more thought into it,\ when asked if she would go if she had the opportunity to go again this year. It appears as though Union College must wait and see how the rest ofthe world reacts before they can make a final decision concerning this Winter's tenn in India.

The lease agreement was not approved by the Board of Trustees, a neces- sary step for all documents of this nature.! fthere is a lease, there is a clause according to which the col- lege has the right to rule the lease invalid if it is in the best interest of Union College. ADPhi is ques- tioning whether moving Admis- sions into ADPhi is in the best in- terest of the college. Class .Representative Election Results This past February, Union Col~ lege unveiled its \Master Plan.\ The Master Plan was intended to give Union a guiding I ight of sorts and to put sense into the imp()r~ tant decisions for the future. This plan contains many controversial facets, incluuingmoving the book- store off campus, refurbishing Old Chapel into :-.tuJent social space, and possibly not renewing the leases of Sigma Phi and Phi De Ita Theta. lluwevcr, the most contro- versial part oftl1e plan was perhaps to move the Admissions Office into Alpha Delta Phi. Before any portion of the Master Plan becomes reality, it must first be approved by the college's Board of Trustees. Since the proposal to re-locate ADPhi was put on the floor, con- troversy has surrounded the lease that gives the fraternity the right to live in the house. The fraternity signed a lease extension in 1990 with VP of Finance and Adminis- tration. The college disputes the validity of this lease. \I don't be- lieve that there is a lease, but we • re operating under the assumption that there is one,\ said President After numerous clashes by ad- ministration and the students, the deadlock has reached a forefront. On June 14, I 998, the Board of Trustees will meet and vote upon the piece of the Master Plan in- volving Admissions moving into ADPhi, according to President Hull's office. This vote will un- doubtedly be a turning point in this controversy. If the board votes to accept this part of the plan, the fu- ture for theADPhi house does not look bright. The reasoning for ADPhi's Crosstalks and petitions have been to show the trustees how the student body and how the alumni feet ADPhi believes that they have shown that the alumni and the stu- dent body have shown that they Continued on page 5 by Michelle Tham Editor-In-C/lief Last Friday, May22, elections for the p()sitions of class representa- tive J()r each class year were held. The elections brought in many new faces to the student government scene, and with these new mem- bers,. hopefuiiy some innovative changes will be made to the cur- rentstate of Union life. According to current Junior Trustee Jon Zandman, \Voter turn- outwllS low for this election.\ This was ;probably because these elec- tions affected only individual classes rather than the previous Student Forum elections which spanned all class years. As well, the number of individuals running for futllre senior and junior repre- sent!lti ve positions was markedly low. For tile Sophomore Class, the newl'~presentatives are: President Eri.n Aloan, Vice President Jon Lem le and Treasurer/Secretary Steveil Schuler. Erin Aloan, who acted .as a representative of the freshman class, commented on her election saying, \I would like to work on planning more activities for the Class of200 l to get us more united. I think that all those cho- sen to represent the upcoming sophomore class will work to- gether nicely and take advantage of this opportunity to change things on campus. I am very ex- cited to work with Jon and Steve.\ Freshman Steven Schuler had an interesting campaign platform. His signs around campus called for more music on college grounds and the possibility of Validine use at local businesses. He said of his being elected, \I am very enthusi- astic about this position and there are many quality of life issues I would like to address. Union is not up to the standards of other small colleges in tenns of quality of life, and there are a few things I would like to see upgraded.\ In the Junior class elections, Mathew Barry was elected Presi- dent, Sheri Oliver was elected Vice. President and Matt Gendron will be the new Treasurer/Secretary. When asked about why she chose to run for a position in the student government, sophomore Sheri Oliver stated, \I chose to run be- cause there has been a lack of mi- nority representation in the student government. I was hoping I could find out more about the political scene on the Union College cam- pus and attempt to add some more diversity to its activites.\ The representatives for the Se- nior class are Josh Chaplin, who will be serving as President, Vice President Peter Casola and Trea- surer/Secretary Jesse Edelman. In comment to his election and de- sires for utilizing his position, Chaplin stated, \I want to come up with a great senior gift next year and plan some innovative events for Senior Week to make it as fun as possible. I am excited that I won and I want to thank everyone for voting for me.,. Hopefully, all those elected will show tlleir political abilities when it comes to impor- tant decisions in terms of govern- ing the school. It seems as though they all have good ideas about changing campus life and improv- ing student relations.

AD Phi ... continuetlfi'Om pllge 4 are resoundingly against moving Admissions into the AD Phi house. The Crosstalk held on Wednesday May 13 was an overwhelming vote of confidence from those in atten- dance for AD Phi. \I fit's not in the best interest of the alumni or the students, how can it be in the best interest of the college?,\ asked AD Phi President Jon Kre.evoy. President Hull is attempting to work with the fraternity in order to hammer out an acceptable compro- mise. According to Hull, ADPhi has been offered four alternate lo- cations to move the fraternity. These four offers, Fero House, a part of Webster House, the south end ofNorth College that currently houses College Relations, and the Day Care Center, currently located across from Raymond House, have all been rejected by the fraternity. \I realize it's a very emotional is- sue, but a lot of thought has gone into the plan,\ replied Hull when asked about his feelings on the situ- ation. If ADPhi was to take legal action, Hull said \it would be a lose- lose situation. I would want to negotiate with the administration ifi were them.\ If the Board of Trustees ap- proves the plan for moving Admis- sions from its current home in Becker Hall to ADPhi, it will oper- ate under the assumption that there is a lease, and that the col- lege will invoke its right to break the lease and buy the hause. If this process occurs, the college and the fraternity will both hire an ap- praiser to determine the value of the house, and then the two me- diators decide upon a third media- tor to settle the differences be- tween the two. Student Trustees Jon Zandman and Ruthie Strosberg were both very cautious when asked about their feelings. Strosberg ch()se to refrain from commenting 011 AD until after the Trustee meeting. Zandman expressed a pragmatic outlook for the entire situation. \It's a sticky situation,\ he com- mented, \the college isn't trying to be malicious,'' he continued. \We have to look at a lot of new oppor- tunities before we can make a <leci- sion, there are some new things to look at.\ When asked if the stu- · dent response had influenced his opinion, he answered \Absolutely the overwhelming student re- sponse caused me to put more · thought into it.\ \If we don'treach a decision [atthe June 14 meeting]; it may be better for both parties.\ Although the upcoming meeting · is bound to be pivotal, it will by 110 means be the end to the situation. Both sides did not think that legal action was out of the question, when asked about the possibility of it. Alsa, President Hull could not provide a projected move in: date for Admissions, so a short- tenn solution is almost out of the ., question. The June 14 Board of Trustees meeting should provide · some insight to it. Year Review ... continuedjrompage 1 have demonstrated that students are willing to take the initiative on how to make drinking a more re- sponsible act. It is up to the stu- dents, then, as to whether this sen- timent is perpetuated. During winter term, issues were not only raised inside the campus but outside as well. The seven year old battle for the Lenox Road properties yielded a Union victory, and the college now has permis- sion to apply to use the historical houses for academic and adminis- trative purposes after battles with the top court in the state and the Schenectady City Council. This battle was won, in part, because the students and faculty joined together in a unified front. ihey both expressed faith in the student body to respect the houses, and in the positive role Union has taken in the Schenectady area through community service involvement such as the newly-formed Cocoa House, UCARE, and We Care About U Schenectady. However, it became clear that the solidarity between the administration and students was not likewise ex- tended to the Master Plan, which was also introduced winter term. Supporters of AD Phi and those of the Admissions/Financial Aid Of- fice seemed to be at in·econcilable odds over who would gain the right to the house.

And I do so passimll- On Wednesday May 27, Corey Cokes performed in the Reamer College Center Auditorium at 7:30 PM. Many groups on campus worked together to bring him to campus. Among these groups are the Africana Studies Department, Kappa Alpha, ALAS, the Coffee- house, Na1iional Society ofBlack Engineers, and Campus Action. Their work, along with a grant from the InteHectual Enrichment Grant is making his visit possible. In ad- dition to his activist poetry perfor- mance, Cokes conducted two po- etry workshops on Wednesday afternoon. They were held at the Coffeehouse and Kappa Alpha. Cokes t<lok the stage Wednes- day night to an excited crowd. His perfonnance electrified the crowd and left them wanting more. He thrilled them with his work from his upcoming two books. He is an African-American artist and activ- ist best known for his work with the groups Arrested Development and The Last Poets. He also won the 1996 National Poetry Slam Championship. He is also the au- thor of two books forthcoming \Young Peoples Poetry\ and \whining don't get you nothin' hut candy.\ In addition to this, Cokes has his own CD out, \When the Smoke Clears.\ Cokes was also the Fea- tured perf()rmeron TBS' nationally televised Trumpet Awards. His mission is very clear. \My mission is to disperse information, destroy a ath , and s ark action; or as I came abundantly clear during a Crosstalk during spring term. While the need for a centrally-lo- cated, top-quality Admissions Of- fice to serve as an initial welcome to prospective students is rela- tively undisputed, some students felt that they were not sufficiently consulted, that they would not b recognized even if they did resist the motion,and that other options weren't adequa!ely explored. At this moment, the outcome of the decision has yet to be revealed, though its impact wi11 undoubtedly set a precedent for future classes. Undoubtedly, the college as a whole will feel the impact for years to come. What form that impact would take is too soon to tell. Spring term brought further dis- cussion of issues on the minds of students and administrators alike. The Dialogues on Race provided a forum for increasing awareness of blatant and covert racism on cam- pus and the institutionalized forms it may take. As one person stated, \I am part of the majority, so it doesn't really matter to me.\ Oth- ers have since realized their role in the perpetuation of such pejorative attitudes, however inadvertent or unintentional. By providing the chance to get some of the pent-up and perhaps mutual frustration and stereotypes vented, we took a col- lective step towards understand- ing what it feels like to stand in another's shoes. Perspectives of speakers like Felipe Luciano, Dr. Bertice Berry, and Linda Chavez ately.\ A. 1'. Miller, head of the African a Studies Program, was central :iJT bringing Cokes to campus. Miller heard of Cokes through Carnpms Action. Campus Action, a gr()UJl designed to link progres sivoe groups on campuses throug:]lollt the nation, lists a set of speak~rs available to them, and M Hlle r thought that \Cokes would b~ good for this campus.\ \I hopeit inspired people to get invo l·ved with various things and to not be passive. I also hope it raise<i .it general awareness on campus,'\' MiJ:ler continued. StephanieSpeanburg, Co-PTe:si- dent of the Coffeehouse, was \er excited about Cokes' visit witel!l asked about it. \It's always nicet<O host new poets highlighting thee African-American tradition,'\ sh-e said. She was also pleased becaus-e Cokes will be conducting a poe:tl)' workshop Wednesday aftern()-01!1 at the Coffeehouse before his p~r­ formance. At this workslloP', Cokes actively participated and tought anyone who came abollt poetry and anything about poet:rr. Former Kappa Alpha Presi<len t Beth Wheat was also excited about Cokes' visit. \It was such a great time,\ she said. Both the actual performance a:nd the workshop in the afternoon at the Coffeehouse were free allld open to the public. Students tha.t attended the workshops ami the performance said that Cokes de fi- nitely succeeded in his missi()n tGJ \light fire to the asses of tl!e masses.\ offered us the chance to cons id er their opinions on topics ofaffinn.a- tive action and racism. In additiom, Phi lata Alpha invited the U11ion community to celebrate Lati11.o Heritage Month. Events like fall term's Diwali Dinner and the recent Mystasia fashion show provid-es. a chance to share in Indian ami Asian cultures. In the words ~f Martin Luther King, \A threat trn justice anywhere is a threat to jlls,- tice everywhere.\ The winter tern~ recognition of Serge and Be11te Klarsfeld for their efforts in brimg- ing justice to the deaths of 6 m il- lion Jews demonstrated Uni()n's incorporating this commitment to humanity into our campus. In this midst of these issues, Union has also demonstratecl a consistent commibnent to academic excellence. The newly-established History Club brought Lise Meitner's Nobel Prize controversy to an interested audience. In addi-- tion, a $50,000 grant was set up to provide funding for intellectua 1 endeavors, and LE.F. grants .en- abled many thesis students to cCJn- duct their research. Union also sen1 about 48 students attended NCUR and presented their projects, pO<st- ers, and papers to students aJJd professors from around the C<Jt:Jn- try.

The martial arts clinic was instructed by Sensei Mich;~el Campos and six other instructors of Zen Do() Kai Martial Arts Studio in Johnstown, New Yolk. Mr. Campos began the clinic with some statistics about tape, crime, and violence: till America. Recent F.B.I. statistics indicat~ thatthere are 3 00 cases of rape and attempG:e.d rape reported daily in the United States~ ()n.e in ten sexual attacks actually get reportecl. Mr. Campos also said that three out offottr women in the U.S. can expect to be the vic- tim of a crime sometime in their life. Learning some basic self-defense tecb:- niques can reduce the chance of violent an- . jury or death resulting from unsuspected ~t­ tack. Mr. Campos addressed the \fight or flight'\ syndrome and what to do when caught fClce to face with an assailant. He stated thllt most people's reaction when attacked would be to either \give in\ or retreat. Campo:s argued that the most important thing is to remain calm, scream \fire and inflict p!llitn on the attacker. Campos spent two hours teaching UnitOm College women what to do if attacked fi:01m behind, grabbed by the wrists, or choke&. Campos stressed taget areas: the groin, eyes, ears, and throat. Campos taught how to strike by kneei11g, kicking, elbowing, punching, and yanki11g. II • Campos also tal!ght women how to use pep- per spray, and how to follow it up with the self-defense ted1niques he ta~ght. Mr. Campos ended the evening with some common sense advice about avoiding dan- ger. He presented the group with an F .B.L chart of \personal weapons\: the elbow, forearm, frontofthe head, fist, fingers, heel of hand, and knee. Mr. Campos stressed that with enou,gh self-defense practice, force, and calmness, women should be able to inflict harm on an attacker. Mr. Campos stressed that women should always be aware of their surro11ndings and to trust their intuition. If attacked Campos argued that one s.hould, \Yell shout, break windows, and generally do whatever is nec- essary to draw !lttention to yollr situation. Use any available weapons to gain the ad- vantage, such as hair spray, brush, high- heeled shoes. Cany a whistle or shriek alarm if possible. See yourself in control and win- ning.\ Mr. Campos also stressed there are spe- cific \types\ of people most Vlllnerable to attack. Campos stated the importance of traveling in pairs, always letting someone know where you !lre going to be, and most importantly, canyingyourselfin a confident manner. Often tirnes, those people who send off an aura of insecurity are the most likely targets. Campos stressed that wome11 create the opportunity of attack by being oblivious to the danger that may exist i11 a certain situtation. Mr. Campos stressed .the impor- tance of being alert and aware of potential danger-that is the best self-protection sys- tem. •• I UNION LAUNDRY • •• 561 Nett Street Schenectady, NY 12308 71 Cents A Wash With Our Token System Free Drying Tuesdays & Thutsdays 8aan .. 3pnt +NEW TRIPLE LOAD WAS·HER ~ I . •• c~ I ' ..

Campus News How Bad Was Sinatra? Maybe Really Bad by ProfessorJamesUnderwo(Jd Contributing Writer Frank Sinatra was recently quotedas say- ing that listening to one of his albums could ease the pain of love gone bad, or just gone. 'rhere could be some truth to that, but a case could be made that the damage he did to . many of those who went to college in the fifties outweighed all the solace he deJiv ... ered. Of course, the fifties were not just Sinatra: There was Elvis, and Jerry Lee Lewis; the Four Freshmen (and the Three and Four this and that), and there was, ugh, Pat Boone. But for those who wore kllaki's and bermudas, and Princeton cuts, tweedy jackets in the winter and cords in .the sum- mer- Sinatra was tht.; man. Although I liked Sinatra's.singingl-never cared for him as a person. Being obses- sively fussy about doling out even J)rivate approval for those I do not like, l regarded S ina,tra in somewhat the same way I reg;arded . Lyndon Johnson and Pete Rose - men of a particu Jar narrow genius who were in many respects loathesome. (John Leo of U.S News goes further- he terms Sinatra \an appall,. ingjerk ... , an outstanding thug.\) The current issues of Time, Newsweek, U.S. News, People, etc. are jammed witll com- mentary on Frank Sinatra. One person was quoted as going so far as to label Sinatra as one of the three iconic figures of the 20th Century, the other two being Picasso and Jackie 0. (I suppose Picasso shoulel con- sider himself lucky to be placed in such se- lect company.) Most of the pieces written on Sinatra go beyond the man as a singer, an actor and a person. They search f()r his social significance. They start with explain- ing his success in the forties as reflecting the fact that he replaced aU those· dads, brothers and boyfriends who were overseas. They go on to explain that he defined what it meant to be very male and very coo-l dur- ing the middle years. And they end by not- ing that his later hard-edged brashne'Ss (\I Did It My Way\) left contemporary apolo- getic, hemmed-in, beaten-down males yearn- ing for a time when they could all do it their way and only their way. As .interesting as I find all ofthis, I think something is missing. And, that something is based on a strange sort of evidence, evidence consisting; of a very personal encounter with Frank Sinatra's music, an encounter that happened only because ofthe death of a college friend more th~n 30 years after graduation. My friend desperately wanted to be mar- ried, but it never happened -he was notori- ous among those who knew him for falling in and out of love - for obsessively and energetically and resourcefully searching for · the woman who would make his life com- plete. Many times he thought that he had found her - numerous relationships lasted for years. But, somehow in the end she wasn't quite right, or she became tired«Jfhis waiting to decide whether he had i11deed found happiness. When I was cleaning out my friend'sapart- ment, lcame across many Sinatra L.P .'s. One I took; \Songs for Swinging Lovers.\ Then one day I set aside time to listen to it ci<Jse!y - in the evening with the lights down, of course. And then came a revelation, slowly and methodically. The voice and the words, the words and the voice, and the music not 21, 1998 • Page 7 - NEW YORK, NEW YORK ... SECOND ANNUAL PRE-HEALTH SOCIETY TRIP A SUCCESS by Dave Meguerdichian PhotO' Editor On Friday, May 1, the Pre-Health Society ventured south to the city that never sleeps- New York. The second annual field trip. sponsored by the Pre-Health Society pro- vided a group of Union students with a f\trst- hand look at schools and health-related work sites within the New York Metropolitan area. At the same time, the trip provided the stu- dents with an opportunity to meet with New York City alumni from Union who are work- ing or studying in different health profes- sions. This trip followed last years inaugu- ral excursion to Bos- were ina large hospital like Sloan Kettering .. Exploring other fields in the health care in- dustry is very important forUnion students. Upon talking about this issue, Professor Karen Williams, director of the Pre-Health Society commented, \We have found this concept of taking groups of undergraduates 'on the road' to be an extraordinarily suc- cessful way of educating students about different health care oppor.tunities and is- sues.\ Following their visit to Sloan Kettering, the group traveled downtown along the East River to their next stop, New York Univer- sity Medical and Dental Scllool. Here, the chance tc see and familiarize yourself with 1he insides of these graduate schools and :find. out if this is really what I want to pur- sue.\ Eric Wisotzky, a Union sophomore added, \This trip reaffirmed my faith in my future career goals.\ After an evening on the town, a·reception with New York City alumni was held on Sat- urday, May 2, in the Shelburne Murray Hill Hotel, an:anged by the Alumni Office. This gave the students the perfect opportunity to talk to alumni working in a variety ofhealth care fields. Each alumnus provided his or her advice on pursuing jobs in rnedi cine and health care.

And the album cover - there she is on a crowded dance floor, the ethereal blond with her partn.er in six different spots, and a dif- ferent hairdo in each. All the rest of the couples are real; but she isn't. There is no doubt - she is the unattainable perfect woman. I have little doubt, l knew my friend well, he tried to find her. I know he called Capitol Records, Frank Sinatra, whomever. But he failed, just as he failed to find her ghostly kin. The answer is plain. My friend made a mistake when he listened to Sinatra's songs night after night. Sinatra sent him on a search a~ hopeless as all of man's hopeless searches for the unattainable .. And what about all those other Sinatra addicts from the fifties who failed in their · searches? Some might have lacked my . friend's capacity for ruthless measuring, . some might have invented a perfect woman, only todiscard her when his ideal triumphed over his reality. Could this be Sinatra's real · social significance? Is this the reason that so few of my friends are still married to the . woman they met in the fifties? Come to think of it, I think this explana- tion is as good as any other I have read. If · Mark Twain was correct in placing the blame for the South's eagerness for the Civil War on literature, the novels of Sir Walter Scott, then is it too great a stretch to oiame Sinatra for mass divorce? Not for me.- I am satis- (ied I have it right. I have no doubt that there are perfect marriages, but I do not be- lieve for a minute that there are perfect people.

The second annual field trip sponsored by the Pre-Health Society pro- vided a group of Union students with a first- hand look at schools ancJ health-related work sites within the New York Metropolitan area. At the same time, the trip provided the stu- dents with an opportunity to meet with New York City alumni from Union vvho arc work- ing or studying in different health profes- sions.

A Union College Engineering Student Wins Again Auerbach got his first taste of success in Professor Board's In- troduction to Political Science class. It was at that moment that he knew that he could survive the academic rigor of Union College. \If Joe Board thought enough about my work, then I knew I could make it at Union .... He facilitated my education,\ Auerbach said .. Many students look back on their classroom experiences with Professor Board, and he helped educate some of Union's illustri- ous alums. Board is referred to by Phil Robinson, film producer, as his \first producer.\ It was with Board that Robinson completed his first movie; a video documentary ofhis senior thesis. Class ofl998 Com- mencement speaker Vic Fazio, class of 1965 and Representative of the Third Congressional District of California., was in Board's first class at Union, and as part ofhis retire- ment, Board will sit with his former studen1 on the cemmencement podium. Larry Pedowitz, class of 1969 and attorney at Wacllteii, Upton, Rosen, and Katz in New York City, had a chance to rekindle a working relationship with Professor Board two years ago while assisting Delta Delta Delta with legal issues. Pedowi·tz was overcome with Board's amazing grasp of campus politics and the limitations and opportunities of Union College. He described Board as a versatile intellect who could succeed as an academic, a lawyer, or in any field he chose to pursue. At the root of all the intellectual grandeur was a man who cared deeply about the accomplishments of his students. \Joe cares about his students both in and out ofthe classroom. He was one of those special teach- ers who made the subject he was teaching alive and took special in- terest in his students' develop- ment and careers,\Pedewitz.said. Professor Board leaves behind an enonnous legacyat Union Col- lege. He was hired in 1965 as the Chair of a three-person Political Science Department. Within five years, the department grew to ten people, the number of faculty re- siding today. In addition t() his depalirn:ent responsibilities, Board served as the prelaw advisor and as the first faculty member on the Board of Trustees. \He was a pio- neer in higher education,'l Profes- sor Byron Nichols, Chair of the Political Science Department, said. Professor Board made numerous contributions to the department, but he also had a deep impact on the daily interaction .of students, faculty, and staffatthe college~ A rich sense of humor and language coupled with a keen eye for poli- tics made Professor Board a plea- sure to work with, according to Nichols. He is a voracious reader and a man a many talents. In Nichol.s's opinion, Professor Board's abi I ity to connect abstract material into current events and his use of thought provoking ques- tions to spur discussion are the qualities that make Board unique and inspiring. In addition, Hoard has masterfully exemplified '\how humor can be used in teaching,\ Nichols said. For the next five years, Board will teach two classes, International Law and Introduction to Political Theory, while also continui11g to teach at Albany Law School. He enjoys the interaction with the stu- dents, so Board opted out of a com- plete retirement. Board will con- tinue to research and write in his house in Venn ant. He is writing a study on the US Constitution. This is part of an international project with the Bank of Sweden Founda- tion, which is analyzing whether the United States is a good model for the European Union. Board will wr.ite a series of articles in the Jour- nal of White House Studies about Norman Rockwell's Saturday Evening Post. by Professor Frank Wicks Union Faculty qualifies Mark to enter the national competition for a $3,000 prize in Far. ewell sent· or s year Review Anaheim in November. For the second straight year a Union College Mechanical Engi- neering student competing against entries from 40 other engineering schools won first place in the What makes Mark's winning per- formance even more impressive is that he is a part time student who commutes 200 miles a day to a full time job while performing his Professor Keat and Mark Eberhardt American Society of Mechanical Engineers Region III speaking contest. Mark Eberhardt performed his winning presentation last month at the Rochester Institute of Technol- ogy.

Mark's passion for engineering design started at an early age when : he converted his father's lawn mower into a hover craft.

Montana Staff Writer The close of tenth week and the end of finals for most of us means the end of another year of college. For Union's Class of 1998, how- ever, it means the end of college. For some, at least. Seniors will be choosing to en- ter the \real world\ workforce, deal- ing with aboss and co-workers and 40-plus hour work weeks, or to fur- ther advance themselves in academia, going for a Masters or a Ph.D. or maybe even both. Some · may do both, by working during the day and attending classes at night. Some may do neither, and enter military service or take some time off and then decide to do some- thing with themselves. Whatever seniors end up choosing, it almost certainly will notbe a continuation of their last four years of collegiate . life. During their four years here, the seniors have seen a lot of changes take place. During their freshman year, the Bicentenial was cel- ebrated and the newly renovated Nott Memorial and Reamer Cam- pus Center were opened. Many fraternities are no longer in existance at Union, and new theme houses have been started. The Class of 1998 has seen controversy, from the end of cooks in Greek kitch- ens to the current situation involv- ing the campus Master Plan. Ath- letic success, NCUR at Union, aca- demic achievement, increases in class size-good times, bad times, and great times, the Class of 1998 has seen it all. Graduation statis- tics were unavailable at press time. This year's graduation exercises will be held on June 14th on Library Field. Before that is the much-an- ticipated Senior Week, a week-long group of events and activities for seniors to enjoy their last days at Union together. Many seniors, when asked, admitted they could not believe how quickly four years went by, and how mllch happened in those four years. All seemed to agree that there is nothing like one's college years~ and spending those years at Union made them all the more special. When asked about her reflec- tions on her years at Union, Jen Schwartz said, \I d()n 't reaJly have a quote just a feeling that unlike my high school friends and experi- ences, that the friends I have made at Union are going to be my friends for the rest of my life and that is a great comfront in knowing that I am graduating in about 3 weeks.\ . .• continued from page 5 Prize Day, with a significant num- ber being inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. Nevertheless, Union students have also managed to socialize as well in between their studies. Through the efforts of the Pro- gramming Assistants in Student Activities and other groups on campus, we have hosted events like the Fashion Show, Winter Car- nival, Springfest, the Party in the Garden, the Night on the Town, and many others. Seniors have also had their chance to socialize at events such as an Elegant Evening, and just recently celebrated the kickoff of their class gift at a wine and cheese party in the Nott. All things considered, we have learned to voice our opinions, to work together with the administra~ tion and each other and what hap- pens when we don't, how to main- tain a balance between academics, activities, and socializing, and, in these last few weeks before the end of the term, how to look back at what we've been through and its impact on our lives.

Page· -10 ·May 26', \1998 • <llmunrbiensis Opinions Professors Express Negative Opinion of Fraternities in Letter to Board of Trustees Dear Members of the Board of Trustees and Members of the Trustee Board of Advisors: With this letter we wish to express our serious concerns about the impact offraternities on Union College. Before doing so, we acknowledge that fraternities-· like many other groups on campus-undertake valuable community service and charity activities and that they also provide their members with a support network they value highly. We also acknowledge that not all fraternities nor all fraternity members are exactly alike. Having said this, however, it is our unequivoca] view that fraternities are bad for Union. Many arguments can be raised to support this view. Several were summarized in a Board of Trustees l.etter and Residential Life report at a school very like Union. We quote: \Hamilton has been a coeducational college for nearly two decades, yet its social structure is essentially the same as when nearly ninety percent of an all- male student body belonged to fraternities. Today what that means is that fewer than 20% of the current students, self-selected males who have inherited :these buildings, virtually control social life on the Hill. W0men students tell us time .and again that, while they are fond of Hamilton, they do not feel they have the same social and residential opportunities as their male classmates. They do not enjoy-and cannot afford to replicate-the privileges of fraternity life. MoFe disturbing is evidence that this disparity is leading many of the most talented prospective female applicants to seek education elsewhere.\ Union's own Residential Life report similarly cited the unfair advantage fraternity members have over independent students and women due to their monopoly of prime campus residential space and their dominance of social life. In the words of the report's authors, fraternity dominance of social life, \can be viewed as inherently discriminatory ... since from the perspective of women students it creates a 'dependency of men for entertainment' ... Their very existence undermines the coeducational mission of the College, denying women students equal access to choice housing and the other benefits that go along with fraternity membershij), under Union's present system. Fraternities are also regarded by many to be institutions that objectify and belittle wo1nenand foster sexism. Women students report frequent verbal harassment and occasionally worse at fraternity parties.\ The Hamilton report, again paralleling Union's situ- fraternity dominance), however, has been increasing more for its social life than for its academic rigor-a cants, but with talented males as well\ (1995:2).

After all, these are the 'cream of the crop' ... and in students I think it is quite significant that they all felt here (April I 6, 1998 memo). Confidentially, one of male student who wishes to transfer to Hamilton, cit- pnmary reasons. - at ion, also stated that: '\The most disturbing result (of evidence that Hamilton is ,in danger of being perceived perception that is hurting us notonly with female appli- recent memo sent to Union's Deans by a concerned fac- spective Union Scholars and one setofparents, tainty about how comfortable they might feel here if they things (about the dominance of the social scene by a definite negative point :in comparing us with other dbm anecdotal conversation, but I think it is more sig- a random chance encountered with three independent negative about what they had heard about the social scene us this week wrote a letter of recommendation for a fe- ing Union's Greek-dominated social life as one of her National college guides already characterize Union as a party school. According to The Fiske Guide to Colleges: \These days the 'mother offraternities' still lives up to its heritage with 3 7 percent of the men and 30 % of the women joining the ranks. 'Any day of the week you can find a party going on in one of the fraternity houses. Union students party hard!' a sophomore says\ (1997:650). Union's Dean of Admissions, Dan Lundquist, reported to our committee that the dominance of fraternities at Union hurts our admissions efforts. The earned national reputation of fraternities from hazing, property damage, alcohol abuse, se~ist and racist attitudes, and sexual !lssault and their high profile at Union is such that many talented students-particularly talented women and minorities--.opt for schools where an independent and more intellectual environment prevails. Dean Lundquist is unequivocal in his belief that fraternities hurt Union. Many colleges have abo! ished fraternities including Williams, Amherst, Colby, and Franklin and Marshall. Hamilton's solution was to no longer all:ow students to use traditional fraternity houses and private residences. dining halls and social spaces. They converted them into new living, dining, and social options for all students. on campus. The frequently expressed fear that alumni giving will fall should Union eliminate fraternities does not seem to be borne .out by the evidence from other schools, despite occasional fraternity alumni threats. According to Deb Balliet, Union's Director of Development, conversations with counterparts at other colleges indicate that schools initially experience a small drop in alumni giving but soon recover. What we do not know is how many alienated alumni there are who do not now give but who would do so if Union were to eliminate fraternities. Our committee is not just concerned with alumni giving, admissions, Union's r~putation, and gender equity in residential and social space-as important as these issues are-we are also concerned about the abuses women students are currently subjected to at fraternities from informal conversations with students, classroom discussions, as well as student journal entries it is apparent that women are too often subjected to verbal abuse, physical indignities, and sexual assaults at fraternities. The existent (if not, misogynistic) attitudes that are part of fraternity culture and male bonding at this age are exaggerated by alcohol and drugs at fraternity parties. Social science research supports this assertion, documentation the disproportionate link between fraternity men {and certain male college athletes) and misogynistic attitudes and sexual assault. Most fraternity parties pose clear risks to women, both emotionally and physically. Furthermore, what message is Union sending to women students about themselves and their value to the institution through its support of fraternities? This letter cannot summarize all aspects of the argument, but clearly the dominance ofthe fraternity system at Union is not good. Recently, the Administration has taken steps to curb drinking, make Greeks more socially responsible, delay rush, and convert some fraternity housing to other CO'llege uses. We applaud these measures, but do not feel they go far enough. As a committee concerned with fostering a healthy and equitable gender climate on campus, we feel it is our duty to speak out and urge you to consider the costs of maintaining a Greek system. As people who are actively involved in safeguarding the educational values and viability of Union College, we are confident that you share our concerns. Thank you for your attention to this matter. We hope this letter encourages a discussion of these 1ssues.

Is an environment in which dis- I.O':!!.!.r!t.~~~~~!:!!!!.!~l!!!!!!!!~~!!.!m!!!!:Lf~tl!~!!:J senters are forced to silence, or to self-censorship, worth maintain- ing? At whatprice? During my ftrst year at Union, I wrote a response to a letter published in a previous issue of the Concordiensis. The original letter contended that the fraternity men ofUnion are impor- tant to the safety of the school in that they keep the campus clear of undesirables. The author character- ized these men as the \enforcers\ of both Union and its traditions. The letter was full of elitist, anti- Schenectady,and plainly ignorant, sentiments. I found it offensive. My response was to write as tact- ful a retort as l .could muster. Soon after the response was published, I was greeted by .fifteen voice-mail mEssages insulting me with epi- thets such as \faggot\ as wel'l as others too explicit to include in this letter. At that point I realized that the original author was correct. These enforcers do serve to keep the campus safe from undesirables. I was the undesirable. The common response to argu- ments such as mine has often been \love it or leave it.\ \If you don't like Union, then transfer,\ I've been told many times, although more often than 11ot in a hostile and defensive manner. 'To those who have uttered this primitive response to dissenting viewpoints, let me take the opportunity to retort. \Love it or leave it\ is a coward's slogan; one that epitomizes a fear of change in the face of adversity. Those who choose to construc- tively criticize the nature efthis in- stitution should not be silenced through intimidating voice-mails, but rather encouraged by their peers to amplify their voices in the need to promote beneficial changes. The desire to silence various forms ofcriti<:ism by large sectors of the student population points to a problem that far out- weighs any discussion of the so- cial scene. Of course, this problem is not solely limited to- a discussion of the social scene at Uni()n. Resulting from the far-reaching presence of self-censorship on this campus, an atmosphere, rvoted in confonnity, extends well beyond the confmes of the social scene. Consequently, such an environment does not fos- ter ·intellectually based, or even in .. dependent, thou.gbt, but rather seeks to suppress it. While some defenders of Union students are inclined to describe them as \conservative I hesitate to use this language, as it typically involves a form ofpolitical affilia- tion or activism, which, frankly, is not pervasive here. Unlike more competitive schools where anti-in- tellectualism is not only frowned upon, but often rejected entirely, it is here promoted. As confoFillity breeds a fear and unwillingness to think indepen- dently, many wiHingly support measures that are not in their best interests. The only temporary re- spite from this is in the classroom, where discussions are lead, often although not universally, by pro- fessors concerned with indepen- dently formed ideas. Of course, I've also taken classes in which professors struggle failingly to in- cite an interest among a majority of disinterested. Nonetheless, student disinter- is n()t always the motivation remaining silent. For ex- le, many women I have spo- to at Union fear expressing selves in their classes out of anxiety of being labeled non- or, in the specific and •rnr•.,ing case of Women's dies courses, feminists. While many other colleges and uni- versWes, women learn to assert rid themselves of the confor- mity they've inherited from their high-school experiences, an atmo- sphere promoti11g such activity seems surprisingly absent here. Not coincidentally, a recent trend has developed in the past few years in which a number of first-year women have transferred to other institutions, not blaming President HuH, nor the Administration, al- though it is popular to do so. Rather, these worn en, who also not coincidentally have been among those with the highestGPA 'sin the school, leave because they feel un- comfortably constrained by a con- fonn ist student body. This is only one example. Independent thought is not encouraged outside of the classroom, as it undeniably acts as a source of opposing viewpoints. Rather than risk being labeled objectors, students are more likely to conform to whatever belief prevails, regardless of the motivating reasons, or self-interests represented. While some may sigh and say \Well that's the way it is,\ as I sometimes have, they are effectively contributing to the current state of affairs. Whether or not I'm being overly critical is up for debate. Sectors among the student body whose activities refute what l'm saying have, and will always exist. This is unquestioned. N()netheless, in my opinion, conforrtlity based in fear of rejection by one's peers is one of the more dominating and unfortunate aspects of life on this campus, m()fe so than at other schoo]s where I've spent time. Until those who assert dissenting opinions can openly express themselves, without a fear ofbeing subJected to vulgar and intimidating threats. the Union College student body will continue on this sad .:ourse of constantly harking back. to old traditions without ever forging new ones.

Page 12 · May, 28 1998 · W:qe C!Innc:o:r~iensis Final Thoughts and Suggestions A Former Editor-in-Chief Summarizes His Experiences After Four Years Let me introduce myself one final time. My name is Frank Sylvester Rossi, I I of Ballston Spa, New York, and I consider myself over the past two years to be one of the, as Lou Gehrig so eloquently said, \luckiest men on the face ofthe Earth.\ As many of you know, I was one of the Editors-in-Chief of this very newspaper (which I guess I will always refer to as The Concordiensis, .call me crazy), but I have disappeared from its bylines for various reasons. I, like my fellow seniors, graduate in just 17 days from this issue date, and since I am not one for goodbyes, I thought I would instead look back at my years at Union. Union is a college at which a student can have many ups and downs. Its population is small enough to allow a student to know at least a third of the student body without trying too hard, and its location forces this issue even more. I recently vi sited Sal is bury State College in Maryland during NCUR and saw a college located near many major sites (including the Atlantic Ocean), causing the college to have a much different aura to it. While I was born at Ellis Hospital22 years ago, I will be the first to admit that Schenectady has a lot of rebounding to do to seem inviting to a new or even old student. After nearly two years of attending this institution, I was severely unhappy. I wanted to transfer, yet in spring term of my sophomore year, I was to go to Washington, D.C., a \term abroad\ my parents would not have let me go on if they did not think, for reasons I am still confused about, it was a mandatory trip for Political Science majors. The term turned my life around. It forced to take control of my life, and it.gave me the time away from Union I needed to regroup. Since then, I have lived life to its fullest at Union in my own way. From calling any and every type of sport on the radio, to editing a newspaper (I still cannot believe I pulled that one off), to sitting on the Student Forum, I made up for those first two disappointing years. Don't get me wrong, I do not regret the friendships and connections I made those two years, hut I do regret treading water and expecting what supposedly life owed me. I nonnally believe that college students age not one year per year, but rather by two or three years. Almost all of us live more stressful lives in some ways, especially atUnion, but we know our time is short here. The past two years, I have pr()bably aged four or five years every year, pushing my body well past what my own capabilities ar~. Yes, to a certain degree, it is for selfish reasons; I want to be able to accomplish tasks to satisfy my own need for success. However, as I kept calling games and editing new!ipapers and standing up for what I thought you wanted, an amazing thing happened: you told me that you appreciated it. I arn a person who gets very bored very easily, but YOU kept the joy in what I did, YOU made it worth getting up at 6 AM on a Saturday to broadcast afootball blowout, YOU made me pick myself back up when I felt like folding and hiding. I am an introvert by nature, believe it or not, and I could not have continued wHhout your support. Uhank you for this. I would be remiss, however, not to point out that one of the reasons people call me the \'Voice of Union College\ is simply because the course I chose through the last couple years was one utilizing Union's two largest media, There are many seniors who have not chosen that same course who I feel deserve the \Voice\ title much more than myself. Their behind-the-scenes work has kept our spirits high and our school on the map {Stacy Dr()ssman, Ed Dombroski, Ruth ie Strosberg, Graham Bryce, Trevor Koenig, and many others fit the bill better than 1). I thank them for keeping their efforts alive even th<mgh they probably never received the same red-carpet treatment I was so fortunate to receive. T11ey should be applauded. So, what is the moral to this story? First, treat ()thers on this college with dignity because if you do not, you might be both hindering their efforts at helping you or hindering your own ability to affect the college· positively. Abrasiveness and machismo are unnecessa.ryand counterproductive to this cause. Second, if you are thinking about transferring from Union like I was, realize that with a little effort (and regrouping this summer), you can achieve so much injustasmall amount of time. Finally, use these four years to the fullest. My only regret is losing almost two years to my own igncrance and stupidity. This does not mean \living it up\ by drinking double the amount you already do. Rather; it means attending more events, running for offices, joining more clubs, or anything else you find pleasure in. Who kllows, you mightbe lucky like me a11d receive a great deal of notice fer choosing activities you enjoy. I must admit before I run that Opinions there are many mi'nor and major changes I tried or intended to go after to improve Unian College, but which never got accomplished. I thought I would make a list of the top ten, in no particular order, so that those who agree might take the initiative and try to make these changes. I) Disallow freshmen living in Webster. I lived there freshman ear. I hated it. Here is why: since it is located on a far corner of campus, it does not allow freshmen who live there to integrate with the rest of the campus. Students who .do not repeat residence there can easily go into culture shock in their sophomore year~ causing them to fall behind socially. If you really want \substance- free housing,\ then make a floor of a normal residence hall, like Fox, Davidson, or West, a \substance-free floor.\ When my mother made me sign up (true story), I thought it was just another floor. It is not fair to freshmen to displace them in such a manner. 2) Reinstall a College Center Circle. This used to be even more of a social area at the college than the actual College Center. You had a way to check your mail quickly, grab a quick bite to eat, or drop off a friend without having to worry about .how to exit the grounds and evade a \road closed\ sign. I realize there will be a courtyard between the Olin Center and College Center, but somehow, let us rebuild the circle which used to give us a bird's-eye view of the Idol. 3) Validine atGeppetto's. When the whole schedule change came to be last winter, I was concerned, as were others, about the glut at the dining halls, especially on Mondaysand Wednesdays. Well, we were at least partially right. While Dining Services had a good idea to relieve the stress with the Dutch-mobile (for the record, I would call it the \Smart Cart\) students still could use one more option. There is a simple way to do it, but remember, alcohol would not be included. 4) More Wattage for WRUC. Yes, it is only 100 watts. Yes, it goes five miles to the west, east, and south, and 15 miles to the north (if you are lucky and the heavens cooperate). However, this \alternative station\ has a right to be broadcast further. Sure, the professionalism of some DJs would need to increase, but for $15,000, a boost to 1,000 watts (effectively doubling the radius) would give the station the listenership and status it needs to continue to grow. Remember folks, it is one of Union's only tools .to inform off-campus people of our institution's events and contributions. 5) Air Conditioning, September, October, April, May, and June. Those are the months we are at Union in which air is a necessity. However, dorms and many classrooms are severely lacking this modem advance. Is this conducive to studying? Is it conducive to students wanting to attend class'? Are students more attentive without it? I didn'tthink so. Yes, the investment is somewhat high, but its results will be multiple-fold in the end. 6) Paying a Commencement Speaker. No offense to Vic Fazio, whose speech I have yet to hear, but President Hull needs to help us here. I was a member of the Commencement Speaker Committee, and while I found the seven or eight meetings we had intriguing, we were not able to meet many of our first choices because of the greenback factor. For goodness sake, it is a culmination of our four years at Union. I realize that we give an honorary degree, but don't seniors deserve the ability to pay a speaker they feel fits the occasion? President Hull, please reevaluate your decision on this topic! 7) New Press Box/Bleachers for Bailey Field. Call it selfish, but with a swift wind during the football season, I thought our scaffolding on our press box was going to fall onto the road behind it. While I realize the \Master Plan\ calls for this change, please do not drag your feet with this one, members of the administration. The current \temporary stands\ (since 1984) really need to be upgraded to represent the championship~ caliber football program we have at Union. 8) An Official Assistant Sports Information Director. Many of you might not know George Cuttita. He is one of the busiest and underappreciated men on campus. He is behind the scenes giving coaches vital statistics and on the phone constantly with alumni and other schools keeping our athletics program informed on a day-to-day basis.· As the years OP/ED {j ! ~ 1/ ( y r l continue, more sports aFe going varsity (crew and women's ice hockey, for instance). However, George, who was already at his limits with the old slate of sports, gets only a little bit of student support. Let us help George join the 1990s like many other schools have, and help him hire an assistant. Otherwise, you will spread this talented man way too thin. 9) Kill Discussions of Sophomore Rush Before Graduation. While we are still a little ways away from graduation, the diehards who want to see this go through will keep it alive well past when we exit Union's gates. It reminds me of when the administration basically decided on the lunch schedule change while we were away last summer. Will this topic, which would effectively kill the fraternity system because of students choosing terms abroad instead of pledging in their sophomore year, have a similar fate? Read my loud and clear, administration: I will be on campus from time to time this summer. I will be watching this topic intently. 1 0) Kill Discussion of the Calendar System Change. 4-1-4=0 It may be new math, but that is what the faculty fmally found after studying a 4-l-4 system for months. Now, it is semesters. Same rules apply, folks. You are riski11g terms abroad for winter athletes, and if combined with sophomore rush, would completely destroy the fraternity system. Oops, maybe I shouldn't have given away that secret to my friends across the aisle. Anyway, I hope the Academic Affairs Committee decides to heed the suggestions of many professors and drop the time-wasting search for a new calendar system. Try some innovative things with trimester first, if you really need to find a hobby that badly. In conclusion, thanks for listening to me ramble. Overall, it has been an unbelievable run, and I hope l can thank each and every one ·Of .you personally in the upcoming days. If I do not see you, just remember, l live right down the road. Look me up when you are in town. And most of all, remember that none of this would bave·been possible forme witllout you. See you soon, and best of luck. I'm sure you will do fine. Frank: Rossi .

OP/ED Opinions No Rush For Rush: An Adaptation In the spirit of the times and current issues, we thought that we would like to reprint the November 9, 1989 No Rush [or Rush to show that similar issues which plagued the past also pervade current times. Pressure to participate in Greek life begins the moment students start their college career. In the past, Formal Rusll has taken place during the fall term offering limited time for new students to get acquainted with the Greek system and the ·different fraternities and sororities. For th()se students involved in either a fraternity or sorority, it requires a major time commitment and sacrifice. They believe that the portion of their college career which is devoted to the Greek system to be well W()Jth it. Yet, how many of these students fully recognized just what was involved when they com- mitted themselves? During t.be rush period, men and women both have to make decisions that will have a dramatic effect upon their future. How many have the sufficient data in order to make a rational decision? How many blindly choose to devote their future time and energy to an organization that they knew so little about? The S tuclent Affairs Council unanimously passed new Rush proposals that would offer potential rushees more time and more information on which to base their decisions. Rusll has been moved to Winter term and procedures for orientation to Greek life will be implemented: By moving Rush ahead just one term, however, the school is not offering an adequate among of time for a student to have full understanding of the Greek system's goals, demands and opportunities. For students to fully recognize all that is involved with Greek life, and for them to find that particular organizati()n which right for them, it means that more than a ten week period is needed. It seems that at least a thirty week period is needed. Thus we heed to stJ:ess there need not be a rush for rush, let's wait until sophonwre year. Pointless Observations Confronting The Hard Hitting Issues by ·David Kay Opir2ions Editor Wow, so this is it. The final is- sue of tbe year and what looks to belike the final ever Pointless Ob- servations. So many memories. So many good times. So much hate mail. I do11 't know how I could ever express my gratitude to all involved in the making of Point- less Obsewations this year. It just makes me want to cry when I think about it. Please excuse me for a moment... Okay, that\s better. Like I said, so many mernories, so much love lost. .. I d()n 't know where to ever begin. I feel I ike I just won an award a11d now I need to say thanks tG all who helped get me here. I guess first I want to thank Erin Ro·se11herg for the whole- hearted a11d unconditional support she gave me throughout the year ... even during the bad times. I know it's hard to stick by people during their I<Jwest moments, but I can truly ~ay that you came through foF me. Thanks. Next, I want to thank Michelle Jester wh() put the icing on the cake for me in my decision to fi- nally put this column to rest. It was last Satt~rday when I was intro- duced t<l her and she briskly walked away after she found out that I was tile 'David Kay.' Thank you, Michelle. Lastly I would like to thank Matt Aronowi tzand Jonathan Tapper- two people who will make sure to carry on the legacy of David Kay and my wri.ting style long after I stop. Tha11k you. Why am I not going to write anymore,yoll ask? Well, let's see. Hmmm, maybe the idea popped into my head shortly after I found out that the fraternity formerly known as Beta h-ad nearly filed a lawsuit against rt1c ... or maybe it was when :1 began to realize that people already knew who I was before I met them ... or how about the time when my dad read the paper and he asked me, \is this what you've become?\ But either way, I'm more than fairly certain that this column will not appear at all in any of next year's issues. · Besides, what does trash like this belong in a fine publication like the Concordiensis? I mean, with the exc.ellent staff and well-manned editorial board, how does a column like this fit into the fine reputation of our college newspaper? A newspaper with such high stan- dards as to allow \Frank Rossi's Final Dissertation on Pure Air\ (see page 13) should in no way have a place for me. No way. Well, how will I express my twisted sense of creativity, humor and \sarcasm\ now that this col- umn is finished? Back when I was picking beans in Guatemala, we used to make coffee fresh right off the trees ... okay, so I'm evading the question. I don't know, but all I know is that Michelle Tham will be involved somehow. Anyway, back to the point. The point is that this column is sup- posed to be fun and entertaining ... kind of like last weekend's Springfest. I'd have to say that Springfest was so much fun that it almost made up for one week of the depressing winter. Even though we're probably one ofthe latest schools around to get out for the summer, I would much rather be here than I would home. There are just so many fun things going on right now that I wouldn't find at home. · Sure, it's hard for me to see friends from high school and work get out now, but I'm pretty sure thatthey would rather be here then at work! So, I decided to reassure myself by making a list-a top ten list as a matter of fact. Here it is, The top ten reasons I'm glad to be at Union College right now: 1 0. Two words: Water Buf- falo. 9. The handicapped Jimi Hendrix look~a-lilce lead singer guy at Fratstock 8.. Milu~ Winn's public ser- vice announcement messages over the phone-\ahhhhh! You'll scream forScream!\ 7. Learning how to eat the intestines of a lobster and realizing that it could be my parents who were shelling out a full year's tuition for every- one to eat \on them.\ 6. Discovering who is in greater need of a hair weave-- Roger Hull or Fred Alford. 5. Dutch on Wheels. 4. The \Really Coo.l Bands\ series starring Green Day. 3. Group orgies at the Concordiensis on layout night. 2. Drinkfest-1 mean Springfest. 1. Shana L. Meyer (the L stands for Love). I was so pleased to find out that Ms. Meyer had mentioned me at Senior Night, I just couldn't contain myself and de- cided that I must return the fa- vor. I guess she said, \and we will all remember David Kay!\ Well Shana, I just wanted to tell you that I will never forget you either and that you'll always be in my heart no matter how near or far you stray from Union Col- lege! I'll really miss you when you graduate, lovebuns. But anyway, I realize that I will not be in attendance here at school until September, so I wanted to make a list of all the things that I will miss until then. Of course, there are things that I will not miss; and hey, we can throw those in there as well, too. Frank \The Tank\ Rossi: \In case you don't know who I am, my name is Frank Sylvester Rossi II born in EHis Hospi- tal...\ In case you haven't no- ti~ed, \The Voice\ of Union College took out a whole page in MY section to tell about his life in 2000 words or less. Please, I'm not trying to use reverse psychology and l really do respect Frank, but this has to be the most dry and hortible '(il:lfe <noncormensi£' • May 28, 1998 · Page 13 \ I --o~ / r' \I think we're going to need to tap another one, Fred:\ Even though we are one of the last schools in the nation to leave for summer break, the administration has found a number of appropriate divzrsions to keep us happy.

Well, I thought that with Hockey, Molson, and the word \eh\ filling up my col- umn for most of winter term, I thought that 1 would just give it one last mention. After talking with Shana \Love\ Meyer the other day, I realize that one of my \target groups\ this year has been Canadians ... don't ask me why, but 1 guess my humour regard~ ing Canadians has been \offensive\ in the eyes ofMs. Meyer. I guess that stereotyping Canadians as a bunch of Molson drinking hockey players was just as wrong as making all Schenectady residents out to be poor. Wow, have l teamed! Next. My Floor, Fox IS: Well; where should I startwith my floor ... well, I guess it could be characterized by the kid on my floor who always used to run around naked once a week ... and when we were lucky he covered himself with Gold Bond to save u:s the horror of making us feel inadequate ... or maybe that was just me ... Anyway, after thirty weeks I finally talked to my roommate the other day ... ~efore I quit, I would like to mention the fact that we are in dire need for a quality Commence- ment speaker. Hello!! Has anyone ever heard of Vic Fazio? How can our administration make the claim that we are top notch school when we bring in people like Vic Fazio to talk for graduation? Let's see, Berkeley has the President of Indonesia ... lowa had Norm McDonald last year, and we still refuse to pay a speaker. Interest- ing. Well, I see that I am coming to a close. I reaily do wish that I could thank all those that have put so much effort into helping me, but hey! We all get screwed. So, don't send me mail at bo.x #I 058 and thank you all for reading.

: : .. : ::' .::: : . The Current Importance of Politics by Adam-Paul Smolak Staff Writer In 1962, the Students for a Demo- cratic Society stated in The Port Huron Statement that, \There are no convincing apologies for the contemporary malaise. While the world tumbles toward the final war, wbi'le men in other Rations are try- ing desperately to alter events, while the very future is uncertain• Amer.ica is without community, im- pulse, without the inner momentum necessary for an age when societ- ies cannot.successfully perpetuate themselves by their military weap- ons, when democracy must be vi- able because of the quality ofllfe, not its quantity -of rockets.\ The Students for a De.mocratic Society utilized this statement to mobilize students and the mass public against the tyrannical control that the government held over its pa- trons. The Port Huron Statement de- picts a society where the elite rules and the mass public is iso1ated from the policy decisions that spell' out the future of the nation. Fur- thermore, the condemnation of an elitist society later sparked social protest in theformoftheVietnam War and in the Civil Rights gov- ernment which in tum acted as key elements in the reformation ofthe status quo. While the interjection of these ideologies by the Students for a Democratic Society led to a more socially aware and active public in the 1960's and early 70 '.s, society has digressed in.to the uneducated youth oftoday. The Port Huron Statement de- picts itbe norm of the students to- day wh.en it states \Almost no stu- dents value activity as citizens. Passiwe in public, they are hardly more idealistic in arranging their priva:te lives: Gallup concludes they will settle for \.low su<:cess, and won't risk high failure.\ There is not much willingness to take risks (not even in business), no settin,g of dangerous goals, no rea] conception of personal identity except one manufactured iti the images of others, no real urge of persanal fulfillment except to be almost as successful as the very successful people. Attention is being paid to social status(the quality ofshirt collars,. meet[ng people, getting wives or husbands, making solid contacts for la:ter on); much, too, is paid to academic status (grades, !honors, the m.ed school rat race). But ne~ glected generally isreal intellectual status, the personal cultivation of the m.ind.\ While revolutions and massive protests in the past have . allowed for a destruction of gov- ernmental oppression, students to- day do not feel inclined to sub~ merge themselves in the political arenatocreate everlasting policies that wHI benefit civilization. In so- ciety, students do not feel the need to gain representation or become active in the political process for varioiUs reasons. The first reason for this lack of interest stems from the idea that one person cannot make a differ- ence in passing legislation or elect- ing .a candidate. Moreover, stu- dents feel a sense of helplessness that perpetuates their inactivity in the s;ystertl which is dep.icted by the statistic that individuals from eightee:n· to their mid twenties rep~ resent tile lowest participants in the voting process. Furtllermore, students feel-that academic considerations prevent their al).itity to understand national and international events. Finally, students are under the impression that the political arena is of little importa11ceto their daily lives and that elected policy makers will pre- vent an.y sort of national or inter- n ati o na.l crisis. This student inactivity threatens the entire nation and global com- munity because it does not allow for a check on governmental abuse. While to many, this idea may seem somewhat farfetched, its truth is depicted by themoAumen- tal refonns madt! in the 1960's and 70's. Th.e significant strides made in ending the Vietnam War, ending segregation, and interjecting a sense of morality in society can be attributed, in a large part, to the proacti\Ve. response by students. Thes.e students helped to create the platform of justice that forms the basis of current American policy. Moreover, uneducated stu- dents d() not have the ability to offer solutions and invent policy which allows an elite government to pass: any legislation that they feel wiHbe \beneficial to society.\ An al'gumentcommonly-made is that strndents and the youth of the nation would unite and gain inter- est ifit was necessary. This ra~io­ nalization for student inactivity is inaccurate. In t()day's society there are a numbel' of issues that deserve at- tention which include: the current instability between India and Paid- stan that involves nuclear catas- trophe as an end result, race rela- tions between numerous ethnic and religious groups, economic and social inequality, gay rights, the protection of individual liber- ties and freedoms, conflicts in the Middle East, the implementation and implications that stem from the democratization of Russia, to the genocide of Native Americans, Bosnian MusHms, and certain citi- zens within the Rawanda border. Though some of these issues do not affect every individual's life, to the same degree not understand- ing and actively participating in governmental policy is the same as allowing others to dictate your ac- tions and represent your beliefs. Inactivity on the part of students and individuals has the same im- plications as supporting the injus- tice within society and around the world. In theory, all individuals were created equal in society and in order to implementthis in prac- tice, individuals must act to win representation and stamp out the oppression that affects every indi- vidual within the world community. Fmthermore, the students of today must also get involved in the po- litical process on a local level that includes their academic institu- tions. This idea is exemplified by the current inactivity by a majority ofUnion College students. The last election for ~tudent government lends insight into this idea where thirty-five percent of the student body voted for the offic- ers who will help to create and re· form the policies that govern the student body. While many again miglit den()unce the idea that of- ficers wiU Qffer dramatic change, I point to the equality won by stu- dents at Ke11t State and various other institutio11s. Moreover, the same ineq'-!ality that existed in so- ciety during the 1960's is apparent today on the Union College earn- pus. While tile legality of segre- gation has bec<lrue unlawful, cam- pus life admits it in practice. A small representation of m inori- ties within file student body, few minority professors especially His- panic and Afii()an American, and a divided student body among eth- nic lines all plague campus life. Without students taking a .proac- tive resp()nse in the process to eliminatetlleseatld many other in- justices, campus life will forever be based on a system of oppression and inequality. Finally, in ·the Port Huron State- ment, the Stude11ts for a Democratic Society su()p<lri this idea when they relate:\T'he very isolation of the individLJal -from power and community ami ability to aspire - means the rise <lf a democracy with- out pub! !cs. With the great mass of people stru<:turally remote and psychologically hesitant with re- spect to democratic institutions, those institLJti·ons themselves at- tenuate an<l become, in the fash- ion of the vicious circle, progres- \si.ve1y less accessible to those few who aspfretoserious participation is social affairs. The vital demo- cratic connecti~n between commu- nity and lea<lership, between the mass and the elite, has been so wrenched an <I perverted thatdisas- trous policies g<J unchallenged time and again.\ Tiananmen Square Dissidents Since 1989 The Struggle for Peaceful Demor:ratic Reform Continues by Heather Clements Contributi11g Writer Chinese student protester, Wang Weilin, stoicaliy stood unanned in front of a line of government tanks as they rolled in to crush Beijing's Tiananmen Square demonstra- tions in 1989. One nearby journalist snapped his photo in the midst of the upris- ings and his self-sacrificing resis- tance captured the world's atten- tion. He symbolized the democratic movements in China that peace- fully sought reform only to be met with violent government retribu- tion. Wang Weilin sunendered his life to the democratic movement and was executed by the Ch.inese government for his non-v,iolent protest. The heroism of Wang Weilin, who faced down a line of tanks for his principles, is often forgotten in the United States, and more spe- cifically Union College. It is evident with the low voter tum-out in student ele<ltions, the apathetic response to politics in general, and lack of understanding of current events, that students are taking for granted the most basic elements of democracy that other people around the world are dying for. Just recently, one of the leaders of th~ Tiananmen · Square protests, Wang Den, was released from prison. Thou.gh he has been exiled from his homeland, his ef- forts for non-violent reform have lleen hailed worldwide. · Wang Den has been at the cente:r of student protests in China for the past decade. He was responsible for h1:1miliating then Prime Min- ister, Li Peng, and generat- ing massive attention world- wide for the Tiananmen Square demonstrations. ThotJgh Wang Den was just a college student in 1989, he was able to make a world- wide statement through his organization of the Tiananmen Square protests. Tltough there have been some changes in offici.al govemment policy concern- ing dissidents like Wang Den, China still remains an authoritar- ian ·government where the will of the s:tate is placed over the demo- cratic rights of the individual. Many scholars believe that Wang Den's release was nothing more than a political trade for welcom- ing President Jiang Zemin to the U.S. tl:lis past fall and President Clinton's agreement to visit Beijing in June. Clinton's visit will mark the first presidential visit to China since the Tiananmen Square dem- onstrations. Though Wang has been released, still many more dissidents who are peace- fully campaigning for de- mocracy remain imprisoned in China. The U.S. State De- partment reported that 2,600 people where imprisoned in China in 1996 for \counter- revolutionary crimes\ of which the majority were nonviolent protests. These dissidents were doing nothing more than peacefully voicing their dis- approval of the administra~ tive system. At Union Col- lege we can use various . means, such as the Concordiensis, the Student Forum, and Crosstalks, to democratically and non- violently protest what we perceive as unfair adminis- trative policies. In China, if we protested the government administration through petitions, pamphlets, or peaceful protests, we could face imprisonmentor other forms of ret- ribution. Participants of the Tiananmen Square protest still carry on the struggleforclemccratic reform and higher hum!ln rights standards in China altbough ruany ofthem have made enolillous sacrifices for the cause. Li Hai, a 27 •year old former Tiananmen Squar~ leader, .is serv- ing a nine-yea:r sentence for com- piling a vide() <f()cumentary of the student protests. Chen Ziming and Zhai Weimill,two 1989leaders,are still under hcuse arrest.

I <!I11lt.cnrvien£!ih5 a May 28, 1998 \ Page 15: WOlll~D NEWS The Current Importance of Politics by Adam-Paul Smolak Staff Writer In 1962, the Students for a Demo- cratic Society stated in The Port Huron Statement that, \There are no convinciRg apologies for the contemporary malaise. While the world tumbles toward the final war, while men in other nations are try- ing desperately to alter events, while the very future is uncertain- America is without community, iln- pulse, without the inner mmnentum necessary for an age when societ- ies cannot successfully perpetuate themselves by their military weap- ons, when democracy must be vi- able because of the quality oflife, not its quantity of rockets.\ The Students for a Democratic Society uti! ized this statement to mobilize students and the mass public against the tyrannical control that the government held over its pa- tr<ms. The Port Huron Statement de- picts a society where the elite rules and the mass public is isolated from the policy decisions that spell out the future of the nation. Fur- ~h.ermore, the condemnation of an elitist society later sparked social protest in the form of the Vietnam War and in the Civil Rights gov- ernment which in turn acted as key elements in the reformation of the status quo. While the interjection of these ideologies by the Students for a Democratic Society led to a more socially mvarc and active public in the 1960's and early 70's, society has digressed into the uneducated youth of today. The Port Huron Statement de- picts the norm of the students to- day when it states \Almost no stu- dents value activity as citizens. Passive in public, they are hardly more idealistic in arranging their private lives: Gallup concludes they will settle for \low success, and won't risk high failure.\ There is not much willingness to take risks (not even in business), no setting of dangerous goals, no real conception of personal identity except one manufactured in the images of others, no real urge of personal fulfillment except to be almost as successful as the very successful people. Attention is being paid to social status (the quality of shirt collars, meeting people, getting wives or husbands, making solid contacts for later on); much, too, is paid to academic status (grades, honors, the med school rat race). But ne- glected generally is real intellectual status, the personal cultivation of the mind.\ While revolutions and massive protests in the past have allowed for a destruction of gov- ernmental oppression, students to- day do not feel inclined to sub- merge themselves in the political arena to create everlasting policies that will benefit civilization. In so- ciety, students do not feel the need to gain representation or become active in the political process for various reasons. The first reason for this lack of interest stems from the idea that one person cannot make a differ- ence in passing legislation or elect- ing a candidate. Moreover, stu- dents feel a sense of helplessness that perpetuates their inactivity in the system which is depicted by the statistic that individuals from eighteen to their mid twenties rep- resent the lowest participants in the voting process. Furthermore, students feel-that academic considerations prevent their ability to understand national and international events. Finally, students are under the impression that the political arena is of little importance to their daily lives and that elected policy makers will pre- vent any sort of national or inter- national crisis. This student inactivity threatens the entire nation and global com- munity because it does not allow for a check on governmental abuse. While to many, this idea may seem somewhat farfetched, its truth is depicted by the monumen- tal reforms made in the 1960's and 70's. The significant strides made in ending the Vietnam War, ending segregation, and interjecting a sense of morality in society can be attributed, in a large part, to the proactive response by students. These students helped to create the platform of justice that forms the basis of current American polky. Moreover, uneducated stu- dents do not have the ability to offer solutions and invent policy which allows an elite government to pass any legislation that they feel will be \beneficial to society.\ An argument commonly made is that students and the youth ofthe nation would unite and gain inter- est if it was necessary. This ratio- nalization fer student inactivity is inaccurate. In today's society there are a number of issues that deserve at- tention which include: the current instability between India and PaJci- stan that involves nuclear cat.as· trophe as an end result, race n-r;la- tions between numerous etlmic and religious groups, econ!>Jnic and social inequality, gay rigrnts, the protection of individual li b.:r- ties and freedoms, conflicts in the Middle East, the implement<!li on and implications that stem from the democratization of Russia, to the genocide of Native Am eric a11s, Bosnian Muslims, and certain c iti- zens within the Rawanda border. Though some of these issues do not affect every individual's life, to the same degree not understand- ing and actively participatin,.g in governmental policy is the smne as allowing others to dictate your ac- tions and represent your beliefs. Inactivity on the part of stud!e11ts and individuals has the same i m- plications as supporting the injrus- tice within society and around the world. In theory, all indiviclu:a1s were created equal in society amd in order to implement this in prac- tice, individuals must act to V'Vin representation and stamp out the oppression that affects every in d i- vidual within the world community. Furthermore, the students oftociay must also get involved in the po- litical process on a local level tflat includes their academic ins1iitu- tions. This idea is exemplified b) the current inactivity by a majorit; of Union College students. The last election for studer1t government lends insight into tilis idea where thirty-five percent o fihe student body voted for the o fnc- crs who will help to create andre- form the policies that govem the student body. While many again might denounce the idea that of- ficers will offer dramatic change, I point to the equality won by stu- dents at Kent State and various other institutions. Moreover, the same inequality that existed in so- ciety during the 1960's is apparent today on the Union College cam- pus. While the legality of segre- gation has become unlawful, cam- pus life admits it in practice. A small representation of minori- ties within the student body, few minority professors especially His- panic and African American, and a divided student body among eth- nic lines all plague campus life. Without students taking a proac- tive response in the process to eliminate these and many other in- justices, campus life will forever be based on a system of oppression and inequality. Finally, in the Port Huron State- ment, the Students for a Democratic Society support this idea when they relate: 'The very isolation of the individual -from power and community and ability to aspire - means the rise of a democracy with- out publics. With the great mass of people structurally remote and psychologically hesitant with re- spect to democratic institutions, those institutions themselves at- tenuate and become, in the fash- ion of the vicious circle, progres- sively less accessible to those few who aspire to serious participation is social affairs. The vital demo- cratic connection between commu- nity and leadership. between the mass and the elite, has been so wrenched and perverted that disas- trous policies go unchallenged time and again.\ Tiananmen Square Dissidents Since 1989 The Struggle for Peaceful Democratic Reform Continues by Heather Clements Contrihuting Writer Chinese student protester, Wang Weilin, stoically stood unarmed in front of a line of government tanks as they rolled in to crush Beijing's Tiananmen Square demonstra- tions in 1989. One nearby journalist snapped his photo in the midst of the u pris- ings and his self-sacrificing resis- tance captured the world's atten- tion. He symbolized the democratic movements in China that peace- fully sought reform only to be met with violent government retribu- tion. Wang Wei lin surrendered his life to the democratic movement a11d was executed by the Chinese government for his non-violent protest.

Chen liming and Zhai Weimin, two 1989 leaders, arc still under house arrest. Liu Nianchun, a48-year old fac- tory worker and novelist, is serv- ing a three-year sentence for sup- porting a pro-democracy petition.

When I started \Riding the Pine\ back in the fall, I wanted it to be something differ- ent from the normal articles that were writ- ten in the newspaper. I wanted to be fluff that a member of Union College could read every week and find it slightly amusing. For a while I succeeded in producing amusing articles every once in a while. What 1 did not want was \Riding the Pine\ to become like every other article in the paper. I did not have an agenda for the column. Now, for the last issue of the paper for this term, I have to make a stand on an issue that has been bothering me for some time now. I am a sophomore and I am Greek. In the eyes of some students, professors, and administrators, this puts me into a certain category on campus. I keep away those top- notch students from attending Union. I mo- nopolize the best living spaces on campus. I also control the best areas on campus that could be used for bigger and better func- tions. I put my house and my brothers above my studies. (It does not matter that I worked my tail off to get into college, nor do I care that my parents are paying large sums of money to better my future.) I create a herd mentality on campus, crushing those who want to be .individuals, or scaring those into silence that would speak out against us. I use emotion to create mobs\to get my agenda passed. I sit around with my brothers get- ting drunk every night, picking on minori- ties and women. I am the social machine that keeps the students in their drunken stu- por every week of the term. I am Greek. Now before you take off for the hills to get away from this rampaging creature known as the Greek system, stop and think. Everyday I, Eugene Schultz, do not wake up and think about how as a Greek I can destroy the school. I do not think to myself \Gee today would be a great day to get drunk and belittle women -- 'cause you know being a misogynist is fun.\ I hate to disappoint you, but my day goes like this -- class and then off to one of my two extra- curricular activities. That would be WRUC as the program manager, where I try to im- prove the station for the betterment of the school. On the other hand, if I am not there, then you most likely can find me in the of- fice of Concordiensis. There, I work on the school newspaper trying to make that bet- ter so the school looks better. Oddly enough, when I'm not there, I'm in the library doing work for my classes. (While some people might disagree with that fact, I do study). Did I happen to mention that I am also part of the IFC, trying to better the Greek sys- tem for the betterment of the school? Greek letter organizations were initially formed to be the bastion of the best and brightest on college campuses. Here stu- dents and student athletes could meet and discuss the wotld around them in private. The focus was trying to be the best in both athletics and in the classrooms. Yet these early fraternity men gave themselves guide- lines to accomplish these feats by. With a rash of deaths caused by excess drinking at Greek letter organizations all over the country, the view of these groups today is highly negative.

Such things as the movie Animal House, while a good movie, it gives people the wrong idea about what happens in a fraternity. Also, things like 90210, where the fraternity on that show is called KEG house. It gives people the idea that all the brothers do in fraternities is drink and ogle women. While this might be true for some groups, for the majority it is not. Sororities to are not exempt from this me- dia scrutiny either. Every time I turn on the TV, some movie is portraying an evil so- rority. The last one was entitled Dying to Belong or something like that. People be- lieve what they see on TV. If all they see is negative images of our institutions, then ev- ery time there is a death, or some other prob- lem arises, they begin to feel that this is the normal practice of all Greek institutions, not just a select few. No matter what we like to think, no matter if we are the most gifted professor or the dumbest moron, today we readily accept what the media feeds us. Yet some of the problems that our admin- istration is blaming on the Greek organiza- tions here on our campus are also happen- ing to a greater extent on campuses that do not even have Greek organizations. In the past seven weeks at 26 national universities and coJieges, there were, in essence, beer riots. At these schools, the administrations tried to crack down on the amount of alco- hol and partying that was going on. At MSU, the students erected flaming barri- cades. Police had to be called in. To dis- perse the students they used tear gas. A similar event happened at UCONN several weeks ago also. Now I know that these are big schools compared to Union, but when we had our dry weekends, the Greeks on campus complied willingly. We did not riot. We are willing to change, however; those of you out there who want to change the Greek system must work with those in the system you are trying to change. It is not beneficial for either group to butt heads. Work with us not against us. This goes out to the Greeks on campus also. Some nationals have said that you'll be going dry. Look at this as a blessing, not a curse. Use it to your advantage: go back to the roots of your organizations. An \us vs. them\ approach will only end in our deaths. We, as a system, must be the bigger people. noonsen- joyable (not that I do a who 1 e helluva 1 0 t around here) and for buy- ing a the- saurus. Most of all, I w o u I d like to thank ev- eryone for reading, especially those of you who have taken the time to respond, either through letters, e-mail, or tapping me on the shoulder in the college center. Your atten- tion has been the driving force in the con-. tinuation of this column and in breaking from my usual apathy. Thank you, every- one. Words-- they hold such power. They can ·be manipulated to back the most atrocious lie or scaled down to depict the most honest truth. They confront us everyday in the form of signs and conversations and with each instance, we have the choice to take them at face value or to look more deeply at what may be meant. I found this sign in the win- dow of a barbershop on Spring Street in Philadelphia. Just a few words but, oh, the honesty. I had never heard a simple buzz cut referred to as a \whiteboy .special\ be- fore, but let's be honest-~ it kinda is. This is an example of accuracy in advertising. This is an example ofhonesty with words. When staying in San Diego last December, I fre- quented this coffeehouse called Lestat' s. One night, I got into a random conversation about literature with the gentleman sitting in the next chair. Setting his book down, he introduced himself as Bo and told me that he was on vacation from his job in Texas. We engaged in a long discussion of the power of literature. The conversation ranged all over, from Herman Melville to Jack Kerouac to Hermann Hesse and on. We discussed Thoreau's Walden for a bit. I told him I think Thoreau is brilliant, but I feel his writing is a bit pretentious -- it is as if he knows he is let ride ·around in the hood of his sweatshirt. When I first en- ·tered the store, he told me he was trying to teach the kitten to use the litterbox. H e wanted to know if he should urinate in the box him- self to show the cat what to do. This was my first encounter with Marlon. I picked up an old, water-stained copy of the Tao Te Ching, and he and I landed in a conversation about Chinese characters. Marlon explained that ancient Chinese scribes would spend their whole lives de- signing and perfecting a single character. He continued to tell me about this one par- ticular scribe-- I cannot remember the name -- who was given the task of creating a chara acter for ••Jesus\ after the Orient opened to European trade. Apparently, the final char- acter took over twenty years to create and somehow incorporates a number of symbols that are important to the religion. He said that the character, in its simplicity and its complexity, is a work of art. If a person is going to sit down and spend half a lifetime designing a word, if people take the time to put words together in great volumes that will be further debated by more people in places like coffee shops, then it stands to reason that words hold a great deal of importance for society. This is why we take them so s.eriously. Yet, when we come to a sign in a window that says, \whiteboy special,\ what are we supposed to think? The most beautiful thing about language is its universal appeal. The same method of conveying the world's greatest truths and most decimating lies can also be used to advertise a cheap haircut. As for the cut, I would not trust it. As for words, I have pestered you with enough for now. Have an enlightening sum- mer.

The last issue ofthe year. I guess I should probably say something about serving as Editor-i-n-Chief this past term has been like~ It has been one ofthe most upsetting and most rewarding experiences thus far in my 19-year-old life. It has taught me a lot -- a lot about my- self and the way I handle pressure and deal with situations. It has been difficult-- filled with more stress than I ·ever could have imagined. I suppose T took the job thinking that it would be enjoyable, to work with the section editors and feel such an absolute sense of ac- complishment when the paper ac- tually came out. It has been that for me; it has been very fulfilling. The thing about the newspaper is that it is not easy, and generally it is not fun. It adds an extra strain on my life; a strain that leaves me sleepless on press nights and that persists until the paper arrives on Thursday mornings. Yet, I have done it to myself.

My dad was a political prisoner there and married· my mom, a native. After he was re- leased in 1981, they moved to L.A., where my dad remarried. Because of his job as a profes- sional weight lifter, my dad had to move back to Vancouver five years ago, where I went to high schooL\ MA: \Wow sounds interesting. Look. If you're not gonna take this seriously, then I will harm you. Is that clear?\ D K: \Yes -- crystal clear. I'm sorry.\ MA: \Good. Urn, back to your column. Do you realize that most of the things that you write, people consider, well, ignorant?'' DK: \Yeah of course, but that's the whole beauty of it. I mean, you get the biggest rise out of people when the stuff that you say isn't even true.\ MA: \So is that the 'point,' so to speak? Just to see people get pissed off?\ DK: \Not really, I mean, if any- one takes the stuff that I write se- riously, they're going to go nuts, because I'm not serious when I write it. When I started out, I guess it was fun to get the attention and stuff, but now I think I' dratber just make people laugh. I mean, now people come up to me all the time and say things like, 'You know, you have to keep writ- ing because I laughed so hard at the last column you wrote' or something along those lines ... but either way, it's fun to know that pe<>ple are reading. I guess that's the 'point' if you want to put it that way.\ MA: \I personally have never found anything you ever wrote to be funny. I think you're lying. Anyway, what's the deal with Amy Rilling? Who is she, and why did you put her in your col- umn?\ DK: \Oh jeez, you're going to ask me about that? I don't believe this, I'm going to leave ... \ (starts to get up) MA: \Wait don't leave. O-Kay, you don't have to answer that if you don't want. Back to the ques- tions ... umm ... are you planning on writing the next three years that you're here?'' DK: \No I don't even think that I'm going to write next year. It's getting boring. It really is. I'm get- ting sick of writing this trash. You can take over for me I guess, if you want. You write some pretty funny stuff.\ MA: \Ohjeez thanks. I'll pass. I only have a couple more ques- tions if you don't mind. Have you ever gotten any serious hate mail or messages?\ DK: \No not really ... people know who I am, and if they were serious, then something definitely would have happened to me al- ready. But, I think people now realize that I'm never serious, so it's o-Kay.\ MA: \How do you feel about the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the effect that it has had on the economy ·of! Europe? DK: \Obviously that's a trick question, because if you were aware of international politics at all, you would know that the con- flict in Bosnia-Herzegovina has greater meaning to each person's soul and heart that cannot be ful- filled by simply doing nothing? That is the question. Being happy for me isn't so much about watching television for hours on end with my brother anymore. It isn't even about buy- ing a great pair .of shoes on sale (honestly). What it is about is find- ing a sense of purpose and feeling satisfied with the effort I have put in and the result it has given me. I think a lot of people start realiz- ing that at this age. The frivolity of my adolescence and the mind- lessness of superficiality are start- ing to wear off. I' am sorry for the time I lost to those two things. So, I am standing here now ... ready to say good-bye to the se- nior class, ready to say good-bye to another year of school, and at least I have learned something from it all. I have learned that I have energy in me, and a passion in my blood that is yearning for activity. I don't want to be graduating college looking back on four years of nothingness. I want to know that I lived my life and did everything I could; and despite all ofthat, that I smiled while it. been going on since 1991 and that it really hasn't had much of an ef- fect on Europe's international economy at all. I mean, if it really did have an effect, the leaders ofthe Interna- tional Monetary Fund (IMF) would not have been able to agree upon a reasonable rate for the Euro that all nations would have been able to be happy with. So, basically ifyou were trying to make me look like an idiot by asking me that question, F you. Thank you.\ MA: \Wow. I was actually just kidding. You should really chill out. When you fart, do you blame it on the family dog?\ DK: \Excuse me?\ MA: \Kidding again. All right, one last and final question. Basi- cally, all you have ever wanted was for someone to hold you in your arms and tell you that it'll all be o-Kay?\ DK: \Yes thafs all I really ever wanted.\ At this point, he got up--cbvi- ously because I had tapped into his weak spot. So I bought him a cherry smoothie and a computer- greek cyberwrap. Then we called itaday. . So that's about it I am going to Israel in the fall, so I'll start writ- ing again when I get back. Keep your eyes peeled for a new column title and many more sur- prises. If you have any ideas for a new column title, or any comments about my undisputed reign of the Features section this past year. send them to mailbox #0040. Later.

Page 18 •- April 28, 1998 ·' <!1nmnd:riensis Feature's Jon Tapper's Weekly Commentary The year is almost over, so this will be my last column of this aca- demic school year. So much has happened to me over the last 10 months that I don't even know where to begin or what to even write about. But like the rest of my columns over the past year, I will start without a point and prob- ably end up with a half a page of fine literature (this is my opinion anyway). I have reached a crossroads in my article (yeah already). Do I want to offer my critique on what is wrong with the school? That gets <J!d real quick though. I'm sure that everyone has already heard a:H of the Roger Hull jokes (they get teal old, real quick). And l said what I had to say about the Deans last week. Maybe I should clarify what I said last week a little bit. When I said that I didn't like the Deans, I didn't mean all of the Deans. I meant all of the Deans but Dean Schurick. I think that she actually might care about the stu- dents. How refreshing, don't you think? I mean th·is school never ceases to amaze me. For a):( the bad stuff that is said about state schools and all the good stuff that is said about PERSONALS Loveseat· It's been a great year. I didn't break the rule again!! Don't miss me .too much over the summer. -Da Da Da Jessi-fina- You are the best roomie ever! I'm glad we'll be sharing the attic together. -Shaney-fina To all tile Concordy Seniors- We'll miss you--who's going to resign next year?? -The Staff Jay Goldberg/Everett- If you don't make it in law school. we'll hire you as our maid.

I wish we c()uld've met .a long time ago but at least we know eacllothernow. Don't forget to keep in touch, I'll miss you! I know you'll be an awesome doctor, good luck. -Love Shana The Chicago Crew- Thanks for making my Spring Break one I'll never forget. Don't forget, L.A. Urban Plunge next year! But only one rest stop an hour! -Shana Jim Dis&efa~~o aka Lupe private colleges, I think that it is completely backwarcls. In talking to people who attendstate schools, the people who run the schools (i.e. the deans) actuaUy care about what the students h'\ve to say and what popular opinion is amongst the students. Why caP! 't it be like that at an institution where $30d000 is paid annually to ·receive an education? And a quick note about Presi- dent HulL He has done a nice job rebuilding this campus. l have to give credit where credit is do. But I hate to follow that with a nega- tive·comment but that's what lam going to have to do. P-resident Hull is badly out of touch with the av- erage Union College student. He might be abreast as t() what some student who is on a whole bunch of committees does in an average day at Union, but as for the rest of us, he has no clue. I h10pe with that slick lawyer mentality he didn't convince anyone that he knows what's going on or that he actu- ally cares. Because, I for one, wasn '·t fooled. On the lighter side of what has been going on recently. The Ice Cream truck has been seen around Schenectady a lot lately. I have been seen on more thcll1 one occa- sion chasing him dowrt the street. My point is that I have: been pur- chasing the 1998 WWF ·ice cream bars. Not only are tlley really good, but they come with action figures and trading ciLJds, a real stea:l at $1.75. I djd a really stupid thing last night .. I ordered a pizza from Domino's and I waited over an hour and it never came:. 1 got re~ ally angry because I was hungry. So I called them up to yell at them and tell them that I didll't appreci- ate them screwing me over like that. They told me that they sent a delivery guy and that rna one an- swered the phone. I told him that I was in the .room the whole time and that he was lying to me. So after making a complete idiot out of myself I later learned that the Domino's guy had i11deed come and he did try to call. But my ringer wasn't on. Whoops, my bad. Even pseudo-pernect people like myself make mistakes some- time. How stupid is the C()ncept of pledging a fraternity as a senior? I look at it this way, why would someone do it? Why pledge a fra- ternity as a senior ifycu are going DINING SERVICES WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE WHO TOOK PART IN NAMING THE \FOOD CART\ MANY ENTRIES WERE RECEIVED!t!l! !! !!! !!

Once y.ou become a \brother\, you then have less than a month left in your college career to enjoy life as afuH brother.

Sure we had classes today, but some good did come out of it. On superstation TBS today there was a Rocky marathon. That's right, all five of them. Ten hours of everyone's favorite underdog, Rocky Balboa. Right now we are in the middle of the fourth one. He is about to take on the Russian monster Ivan Drago. I wonder who will win this fight? Let's put it this way, I'm not putting my money on the Rus- sian. What is the deal with the Dutchcart? My opinion on· it so far is that it is a pretty good idea. And besides that lady looks so damn happy driving it. If I had to use one sentence to describe the ductchcart to my friends at home I would say that it is a poor mans version of an Ice Cream truck.

After Ji:ving under a graycloud for the past few months; it is good to finally have something a little bit different around here. S.pringfest was a lot ()f fun. Good times, good company, and good music. Basically, a great weekend filled with a lot of great memories. But l for one am glad that every weekend isn't Springfest, because if it was, I wouldn't get any work done. It was so nice outside and their was so much going on around campus that I had absolutely no motivation to do any work last weekend. Be- sides, if Springfest happened all the time, the novelty wou'ld wear off. And we wouldn't want that to happen. Well, I have filled my half page, with nothing really that important, but its still done. I hope to be writing again next year so l hope all of you are still reading. Have a good summer.

Godzilla One rainy night in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, a 50-foot Japa- nese fishing tanker cruises to its destination. The captain of the boat eats nood.les while watching Sumo wrestling. Suddenly, the col- lision alarms sound. Something is enclosing on the boat. Down be- low, the workers hear something. Without warning, a giant claw rips the hull to shreds. In Russia, Dr. Nick Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) is investigat- ing the effect of the Chernobyl ex- plosion on earthworms. He has learned that due to the wom1's ex- posure to the radiation, they are now 17% bigger than before. He is suddenly called away to Panama to investigate the Japa- nese tanker and what appears to be a giant footprint. Meanwhile, this unknown creature has crossed into the Atlantic Ocean, and is moving northward towards the East Coast. No one knows what it is. The creature surfaces on Man- hattan, and begins to destroy the city. Then, it suddenly disappears. The US Army sets up a command post in New Jersey, and evacuates the city, much to the chagrin of the inhabitants. Dr. Tatopoulos has an idea of how to lure the beast out of its hid- ing place. The plan works, but the army cannot destroy the creature. When things look their worst for New York City, Dr. Tatopoulos makes another startling discovery: Godzi lla is pregnant and he/she can reproduce asexually. According to the doctor's estimates, the creature could probably lay 12 eggs, and they could hatch at any time. Dr. Tatopoulos is dismissed from the army team when his ex-girl- friend Audrey Timmons (Maria PitBio ), a struggling newsroom as- sistant who aspires to be a reporter, steals a top secret video that docu- ments the creature's movement through the Pacific to New York. Tatopoulos then comes into con- tact with Philippe Roche (Jean Reno), amemberof the French Secret Service, whose mission is to de- stroy the creature for the French Government, which inadvert- ently created the creature through their nuclear tests. Nick and Philippe travel the city to find the eggs~ only to dis- cover that the Mad is on Square Garden was already full of eggs, and tiJat they have begun to hatch. These new godzillas are hungry and want food! This movie combines a giant budget, kick a*s special effects, and lots of explosions. This is what made the movie great and is the reason that most people will go to see this movie. Other aspects of the movie are lacking. The plot is horrible and the characters are even worse. When anyone opens their mouth to speak, \look out!\ they wi II say the most stupid thing possible. The hero of the story, Nick Tatopoulos, is played by Matthew Broderick Oh, Matthew, how you have fallen since Ferris Bueller 's Day Off and Glory! But never fear, rumor has it that you will be play- ing the lead role in the 1999 release Inspector Gadget, and will also once again give voice to Simba in Springfest Bands Successful by Leane Serratore Contributing Writer On Saturday, May 23, five bands played on West beach for almost seven hours. The day was hot and sunny while Matt Finkelstein, head of the Concert Committee, stated that he \hopes that everyone wore sun- screen.\ In the blazing morning sun, the first two hands, both con- sisting of students from Union, were The Full Monteltesand Catch 22. Following these two were the headlining acts Belizbeha, Timmy Love and Reflex, and Otis Day and the Knights. The festivities began at ll :30 AM with The Full Montelles, who won the Battle of the Bands. The group fought to play this set due to a mistake in scheduling by the Concert Committee, but the show did in fact go on. Arts and Entertainment coeditor Kim Rohback said, \The Full Monte lies are great ... it's ashame they only played forhalfanhour.\ ClJntinued to page 21 •.. ''If you are willing to get past the hor- rible script and enjoy watching New York City getting destroyed ... then this is the movie for you!'' Disney's next release, The Lion King: Simba's Pride. Was ,it just us, or did Simba sound 'like a wuss compared to Mufassa in the origi- nal Lion King? Broderick is joined by two Simpson's greats, Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer. In this movie, Hank Azaria plays Animal, a cam- era man who will stop at nothing to get a story. This, obviously, gets him into a lot of trouble throughout the movie. Azaria's face is maybe best re- membered as the character ofNick, the dog walker, from TV's Mad About You. His voice, however, gives life to the following Simpson's characters: Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Moe Szylak, Police Chief Clancy Wiggam, The Comic Book Guy, and Doctor Nick Riviera. Harry Shearer is the unscrupu- lous news anchor man who steals stories from other people to fur- ther his career. Shearer is the voice of these Simpson's characters: Charles Montgomery Burns, Waylon Smithers, Ned Flanders, Seymour Skinner and Otto Mann. Maria Pitillo is the object of Dr. Tatopoulos' affection. As Audrey Timmons, she plays the perfect bimbo. 'Nuffsaid. Jean Reno is perhaps the best actor in this film, although he share.s the same flawed script as the rest of the cast. Reno plays French secret service man Philippe Roche, whose mis- sion it is to destroy the creature. Reno nas starred in many French films, and may be best recognized from his roles in The Professional and Miss·i(41'1: Impossible. Other than poorly writ- ten script, the most ridiculous part of the film was using Siskel and Ebert look-alikes to play the mayor and his aid. They even named the mayor Ebert, and his reelec- . tion campaign was thumbs up. At the end, the Siskellook- alike tells themayorihat he thinks that he is thumbs down. Godzilla is directed by Roland Emmerich, who brought us last summer's blockbuster Indepen- dence Day and Stargate. It is ob- vious that in Godzil/a, as in ID4; more of the money was put to- wards special effects than script. However, in movies like this, spe- cial effects are much more impor- tant than dialogue, and that is why they can get away with it. Whereas Japan may be leading in other areas, such as electron- ics, we have beat them on their own turf: we have succeeded in making the best Godzilla movie ever! So, in the end, if you are will- ing to get past the horrible script, and enjoy watching New York City getting destroyed and New York- ers getting stomped on and French men being eaten by hun- gry baby-zillas, then this is the movie foryou! Go see it for Mati- nee Price. ******* Wow, this is the last Concordy for the term, and this is it for us as your faithful movie reviewers. Dur- ing this year we have seen the open- ing of the new Hoytes 18 mega-plex at Crossgates Mall, watched as ticket prices jumped from $7 to $8, then recently to $8.25. This newest price increase confuses us. You would think that they would not want to give everyone three quar- ters in change .. Yeay, Capitalism! Well, we would like to leave you with a few last reviews for the sum- mer. After seeing Deep Impact, we must wonder outloudathow similar Annageddon will be. The Mask of Zoro looks promising, as does The Truman Show. If you are anX-Files fan, than the movie looks to be really good, and hopefully it will live up to our ex- pectations. Lethal Weapon 4 has potential, as long as it does not re- cycle the jokes· from the first three. The Avengers stars Sean Connery and Uma Thurman, and looks like a movie with style. So, what did we learn this past year? lfyou are a janitor, you might just be a genius and not know it; you can condense Seven Years in Tibet into two hours in the theatre; in a city where the sun never shines, you can't find the beach; never live in New York City, as it will inevita- bly be destroyed; the \take me\ eyes don't work on the blind; Spice racks come in all sizes; Marky Mark should stick to the porn industry and let John Cusack be the hitman; movies with \lost\ in the title often should not be found; you will al- ways remember what you did last summer; and finally, in college, no one can hear you scream.

Arts & Entertainment Springfest Bands (Cont'd) · ••. crmtinuedfrom page 20 The band includes Arya Chowdhury '98on lead guitar and vecals, Heath Fradkoff '99 on bass guitar and vocals, Caleb Sturges '98 on drums, Dave Bernat 'OOori saxophone and Nick Crawford '0 1 on trumpet. Although brief, the band per- formed what may have been their best set, with songs famous to Union's campus such as \Lap Dance for Santa,\ \You Only Love Me for My Pool,\ and \Calming B.A. Down,\ amongothers. Nick Crawford stated that work- ing on the professional P.A. sys- tem was fun. Many agreed be- cause this was one ofthevery few times that the vocal stylings of Chowdhury and Fradkoff could be heard clearly. Chowdhury, a self- proclaimed \traitor stayed on stage to perform with the next band, Catch 22. Chowdhury played lead guitar with Frank Barbarino '98 on rhythm guitar and vocals, Raj Pyne '00 on bass, and Craig Champion '98 on drums. The quartet played at 12:25 PM covering popular songs and per- forming ah original song titled \Keep it to Yoursel·f.\ The band ;played for about half an hour with Chowdhury in an executioner's mask, playing riffs in his solos and between songs. Belizbeha, a funk/hip-hop band, was up next. Many people danced up by the stage and sang to the songs they knew. The band told Finkelstein that they would love to play at Union again. Sevend people ·said that their · set was amazing. With two female backup singers and a drummer, keyboardist, bassist, and guitar- ist, this band was incredibly fun,. and all there enjoyed themselves immensely. After Belizbeha, Timmy Love and Reflex took the stage, ~pon-. sored by the Peer Facilitators to· promote racial equality through . music. The lead singer had a roaming microphone and went off the stage to dance with students. The band played mostly covers of .songs and definitely rocked Union. The .final band was Ot-is Day and the Knights -- a band that celebrated their tenth anniversary · ofplaying Union in 1988 by play- ing again on May, 23. Everyone . who could leaned on the barri- cade hoping merely to shake hands with Otis. One lucky student caught his· towel, and after the show, Otis and the band autographed :pic- tures for students. About three hours after the show had ended; three of the Knights came back to Union and hung out at Alpha Epsilon Pi. Overall, the concerts were amazing. The Concert Committee would like to thank The Full Montelles and Catch 22 for par- ticipating. A&E's Final. FYI: Farewell To All by A&E Editor Lori- Greene First and foremost, congratulati<>ns to the Class ·of 1998! You worked extremely hard; played extremely hard, anddesetve all the best of Jov~. lud(, .and happiness in the future! .To our seniors graduating With Arts degrees, we are so .proud of you, I can't wait to wtite update articles about what you are all up 1()! Kim and I would especially like to cohgratulate Fred Ulrich and Amy Rilling-- tWo seniors bound for success in the fields of the~ atre and art.

Don't fret. It's just for fall term, while we will be in Osaka, Japan. Don't be surprised if you see some A&E from Japan appearing every now and again. It has been a pleasure and a challenge to bring the best A&E news and features to you each week. As David Kay .so pleasantly informedall of us, we doworkextremely hard and hope it is appreciated. We owe a huge thanks to all of our writers: Geoffrey Oravec and Mike Lodge who bring \Screening Roorn\ to you and put up with a lot ofharassment from us; Maura Wittbold and Becca Thyrresen, who wrote for us fall tertn so diligently; Gina LaSorsa, who ate lots of interesting cuisine for us; Alex Beckers, Mike Winn and Matt Barry who helped us out on many occasions; and especially Kim Rohback, my partner in crime, psychologist, friend, and coeditor. Last, but certainly not least, is of course David Kay, for as much as we tease him, we could never do the section without you! Thanks! If our section can do just one thing, its main goal is to inform you of what's going on in the world of Art and ~ntertainment at Union and the surrounding areas. If it can .do one more thing, l hope it is to add a heightened appreciation for the arts and for the time and energy that goes into·produ<:ing quality art. As we head towards summer, I ur,ge you to go home and seek out Arts in your own town .. I assure you there's art,to be found and while I can:'tprornise it to be quality, as I've saidtime and time again, at least it'll be \an experience.'.' OJnncnrbiensis • May 28, 1998 • Page 21 Allison Evans Says Farewell to Yulman Theatre in Proper Fashion by Kimberly Rohback A&EEditor Allison Evans is one of the most talented young actresses and en- dearing personalities that Union has to offer. A senior this year, Maratl Sade will be her final perfonnance at the Yulman Theater. Evans' acting · career began her junior year here. Evans, a His- tory major and philosophy mi- nor, being the Renaissance woman she is, decided to take Professor Barry K. Smith's Be- ginning Acting class. All of the students en- rolled in the and a lot was left up to the imagi- nations and natural instincts of the performers,\ said Evans ofher ex- perience. Evans was proud to be one of the three females cast in the piece. \I had the privilege of work- ing with Kim Rohback --she is in- spirational [Evans really said that; I am not making this up for self- glorification]-- and the extremely talented Lori Jill Greene.\ :·smith's diFecting was challeng- shows.

It was no~ a large role at all, but I had so much fun.\ While Evans was re- quired to spend extra hours with fel- low actor Ari Gottlieb perfecting her English accent, she said of director Helena Binder and Assistant direc- tor Amelia Teasdale, \They were al- ways very nice to me. I absolutely loved the performances.\ · Equus was Evans' introduction to the hectic and crazy world of Union Theater. Winter term, when Evans learned her former professor Barry K. Smith was directing Tales of the Lost Formicans, she jumped at the opportunity for a second audition. Evans was cast in the leading role of Cathy. A middle-agedsingJemother whose trials and tribulations with a dying father, neurotic mother, insane best-friend, and thankless son, are all woven around her strange rela- tionship with an odd man, \Jerry played by the great Morgan Hargrove. \Formicans was weird from the start. We had round table auditions, and the rehearsals were insane. ing, but gave me great experience and confidence as a performer,\ said Evans. \I don't know what people thought of the final prod- uct, but we had a Jot of fun putting it together, and I grew a lot as an actress.\ Evans also wanted to mention the stellar performance of her close friend Nicholas John Kammerman. \He was the driving force behind the show. He did a great job, and he was a pleasure to work with.\ During spring tenn, Evans was asked by director Morgan Hargrove to work on a Mountebanks piece entitled F.M. The four~person cast included, Evans, Hargrove, Rohback, and the brilliant GabrieJla Dory. \Morgan's directing style was very open. Rehearsals were relaxed and really fun. I would con- sider F.

I played a very different like Carey Mi Iler, Suzanne Dougherty, and George Tiggle, made the experience even more fun.\ In the spring tenn of her senior year, Evans is working on her last piece. She auditioned for Marat- SadedirectedbyWilliam Finlay, for her Improv class. Evans was cast as the nurse of Jean-Paul Marat (played by sophomore Eric Witzotsky), Simmone Evrard. \Simmone is a very challengiag role because she's not really Simmon e. The inmate who plays her I have named 'Midge.' Midge likes to dance, she loves music, long walks on the beach and dinn er:s by candlelight.\ This is Evans first time working with director William Finlay. \I was excited to work with the director of the Yulman Theater, and the man who was praised so highly on the Rosie 0' Donnell Show ... I like working with such a huge cast. I am also a last minute addition to the chorus, which I can't tell if I'm helping or hurting.\ Evans also expressed her happiness with get- character from of other ~~~ ~~--------~----~----------- Gone 'til November: A&E editors Kim Rohback and Lori Greene will be in Japan for the fall on a tenn abroad.

ormt.co:rbiensis • Science & Technolo Student Computing Survey Response Neurolab: NASA's Conclusion to the Decade of the Brain by Jennifer Trotts Staff Writer 1 am sure you all remember that little computing survey you filled out at registration at the beginning of the term. Well, in case you forgot what you wrote, here is a response to select comments from a student · working at OCS. 1. Each student should be given a computer upon arrival at Union College. This was a big one, usually worded in an overly bitter manner. For instance, \Laptops for every student, we pay enough money.\ Yes, we . pay a lot of money to go here. However, if you want everyone to have a computer, you will be paying $2000-$5000 more for the privilege. Plus, you will be getting a cookie-cutter machine that you may not like. Honestly, it is much better if you spend your money on a computer that you select. 2. Access to Eudora in the college center. There are many issues relating to why Eudora is impossible in the college center, the major one being that the computers in the college center are not really computers at all. They are simply terminals Gust . monitors) connected by wires to computers in another location. They cannot even run Eudora. \Replace them with PC's,\ you say. Well, it is obvious that we need some major clarification about what Eudora does. It downloads your email to your local computer where you can read it in a user-friendly format. In order to do this, it must l>e configured to access your specific account. I know from helping many people that this configuration process is not immediately obvious, so it is ridiculous to imagine each person having to re-configure the computer every time they sit down to use it. Plus, once email messages are downloaded into that computer, they are usually deleted from idol. Then you can only get to that message again by going to that specific computer. However, you do not wantto leave YO!.Ir personal email on a public computer, so you have to delete it, . which is not always what you want to do. 3. Free access to the Internet. l>y Alex Militello Cllntrihllling Writer Justa few days ago, I was going around asking a couple of people to help me come up with an idea for next week's seience article. My editor and I were both stumped, but finally a friend sug- gestedtbat 1 write an article on the ongoing space experiments study- ing thebrain and the effects of zero gravity on different species. Tbe so-called \decade of the brain\ was initiated by President George Bush in a statement he made in the early months of 1990. This deca<le was started to address the \re.Iationship between the neu- rological system and a wide range of diseases and disorders that af- fect not only Americans, but people around the earth.\ Weal- ready know much about the effects of space travel on physiology and adapting to such an environment, but the scientists have yet to inter- pret this data as itraises new ques- tions as soon as something new is discovere<l. There are eight different teams · in_ the project performing 26 sepa- rate lab experiments. The human subjects involved are participating in the four projects ( 11 experi- ments), including the Autonomic NetvousSystem tea~, the Sensory Motor and Performance team, the Sleep team, and the Vestibular team. The Autonomic Nervous Sys- tem team iiDidies what effects grav- ity (or the lack thereof) has on the circulati()n ofblood throughout the trouble supplying blood to his or her brain is said to be orthostaticaUy intolerant. The Sensory Motor and Perfor- mance team studies such things as how the brain determines what is \up\ and \down\ in a weightless environment and movement of fluid through the inner ear of an individual. The ~leep team will determine the effects of sleeping patterns on the astronauts, as it has been ob- served that if they receive only about 5-6 hours of sleep, they are less alert and aware than if they got 7-8 hours, orthe \average;' amount of sleep considered necessary in order to accomplish their tasks well the next morning. The Vestibular team studies the adaptations the body makes in space and the aftereffects such as muscular atrophy while returning to earth, as a result of the zero gravity environment. They also study the reorientation to up-down directionality. There are four dif- ferentprojects (15 different experi- ments) that will be researched on various other species in terms of how space affects each of them physiologically. These are the Aquatic team, the Mammalian Devel()pment team, the Neurobi- ology team, and the Neuronal Plas- ticity team. The Aquatic team is very simi- lar to that of the Sensory and Mo- tor team for humans. These are studies of how gravity affects them in water, as well as how their equivalent of the \inner ear\ adapts itself to the absence of grav- ity. team is interested in discovering what characteristics are involved in the birth and the development of organisms, including the obser- vations made through zero-grav- ity and the vestibular or orienta- tion system. Hete, experiments and studies are done on early muscle development that can only be performed without gravity. The Neurobiology team studies the rapid development of the neu- ral networks in crickets to deter- mine what effects a 16-day flight has on their nervous systems . There will also be follow-up stud- ies to determine if they are in fact permanently adapted to a specific way of sensing their orientation, or if they are able to readjust to an earth environment after being in space for so long. Finally, we have the Adult Neu- ronal Plasticity team. This com- plicated-sounding name is just used to describe what occurs in the neurons in order to compensate for weightlessness and the sense of an absence of direction in space. After a little while, species in a foreign environment \learn\ to become accustomed to it. It is this \rewiring\ of the neurons within an organism that is the primary focus of this study by numerous scientists. 1 hope these somewhat brief in- sights and explanations have given a taste of what is currently going on in the space program.

Why can't I go from the IBM Lab to any other computer on campus without a problem? For security reasons, there are separate networks for the different portions of the college. AU students are on the Residential Network (ResNet). There is one for administration, one for academic buildings, and others.

However, there are ways to transfer files be- tween these networks (for example, setting up an FTP server on your machine). 7.

Although the rivalry a---,.-.....----,......---. . strong. has always been strong, it has reac:lted new heights this year when the Yankeesjumpoutto the best record in the majors, ami the Red Sox showed the A L that they were better then everyone thought. There has been so much tradition among these two clubs, tradition that goes back to the beginning of baseball. The Yankees have the tradition The Red Sox have Martinez, Wakefield and even Saberhagen, but after that the staff is quite weak. The Yankees go incredibly deep, with Cone,. Wells, lrabu, Mendoza, and Pettitte. Both clubs have great closers, although Boston's Gordon is a little stronger than Rivera. Boston not only needs stron:ge.r starters, but they need a dominant middle reliever, something that has been missing from the lineup of Babe Ruth and the Championship Titles, while the Red Sox have the tradition of blowing .leads and falling under pressure in the big games. However, putaH that aside and you still have a great matchup. Tile two best teams in the AL, and arguably, two ofthetop five teams in the majors. With less then two months completed in the regular season, this rivalry has heated to something not seen since the Celtics-Lakers, or even the newly fou.nd rivalry of the Patriots-Jets. It seems to be quite simple. Boston and New York do not get along. Fenway Park, the oldest baseball park in the country, sold out for Darryl Strawberry, who was given a three game suspension for hitting Baltimore Orioles Pitcher Armando Benitez, appealed his suspension (allowinghimto play until the case was heard) just to play againstthe Sox, then repealed his appeal after the first three game series. Tim Wakefield was on the mound for the Sox to open the series and was able to yield only four runs in seven innings pitched. His counterpart, Ramiro Mendoza, pitched a strong 6 l/3 inning, giving up four runs as we 11. However, it was the hitting ofthe Boston's bats and the closing of Tom Gordon that lead the Sox to a 5-4 victory. The sold out crowd of 33,000 could not have seen a better game. Saberhagen, faired no better then Lowe and gave up seven runs in 2 2/3 innings. Once again, the offense could not find the groove against Yankees pitching ace, David Cone. The Yankees, on the other hand, were in the groove and exploded for another seven runs and were able to clobber the Sox 14-4. this year. Although New York took two out of the first three games, the Red Sox are ready for more action. They will be able to bounce back and prove they are good enough to challenge for the pennant. The next four game series is where Boston can set the tempo and make up more games on the rival New York Yankees, while New York can set their tern po and pull even further away from their only competition in the AL East. ,,~~t~;l,,~;;}),'~t:f::\':et:;t:'>LI this series nearly three weeks before ,,,, the series began. There was a certain buzz around Boston, and the fans were ready for a big series. The top five team have changed little since last reported. New York still is numberone, while the others just trade places. I) NewYorkYankees 2) Atlanta Braves The Yankees and the Red Sox play each other seven times in ten days, starting last Friday in Boston and ending Sunday in New York. The Sox were five games behind the Yankees going into Friday's After pitching a perfect game last Sunday, David Wells was able to hold off the Sox on Saturday with a 12-3 victory. Red Sox pitcher Derek Lowe struggled early, giving Although evetyone in New York must be glowing after their team was able to score 26 runs in two games, do not count the Red Sox out. The Red Sox were playing without star shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who hurthis shoulder diving for a ground ball. He was placed on the 15 day DL and might be able to play in upcoming series at New York.- The Sox were struggling at the plate against New York, but with Garciaparra back in the line up, it should give them huge lift at the lead-off spot. New York and Boston both have 3) Boston Red Sox 4) Texas Rangers 5) San Diego Padres Since the days of Darryl Strawberry and Dwight Gooden, the Mets have lacked that player who could put fans in the seats, captivate the baseball world, and most importantly, single handily win games. (}ranted, it can be argued that Bobby Bonilla and Bret Saberhagen were categorized as this type of player. However, while in New York, the only attention they received was f{)rtheir lack of performance on the field and their foolish acts off of it. The Mets no longer have to look in the past to find such a player. This past Friday, the Mets rocked the baseball world when they acquired Mike Piazza, one of the premierplayers in the game. Piazza, who came over from the Florida Marlins for three minor leaguers, gives the Mets the power hitter th.ey desperately needed. Furthermore, it gives fans a reason to come to the ballpark The Mets have been winning, but they've ileen winning with a team which lacked excitement and fan draw. Granted, the die- liard Mets fans don't need a Mike Piazza to get them to the ball park. However, it is hard to get large fan support for a team filled with singles hitters. Not many fans today are drawn to the stadium, hoping Edgardo Alphonso might drive in the winning run with a base hit. They want the chance to see a Mark McOwire or a Mike Piazza belt the ball out of the ballpark. With Piazza, they picked up charisma and the fans instantly responded. Saturday, Piazza's first game as a Met, over 30,000 fans packed Shea to see his debut. He did not disappoint. After receiving numerous ovations, Piazza delightedthe crowd with a two out, RBI double in the sixth, on the way to a 3-0 Mets win over the Brewers. The following day, the Mets sold out Shea for the first time in five years as they again beat the Brewers 8-3. It appears Piazza and the Mets will enjoy much success and to the front office's delight, fans will be there to see it happen. Red Sox Not As Bad As Yankee Fans Think The Red Sox came into the weekend hoping they could silence some critics by winning their hyped-up series with the Yankees. They didn't exactly achieve this goal. After a huge \come from behind\ win on Friday night, the Yankees smoked the Red Sox on Saturday and Sunday to extend their lead to six games in the AL East. The Yankees have proven that they are the better team so farthis year, not because oftheir weekend series with the Red Sox, but because of their dominant play to date. On the same note, the Red Sox cannot be dismissed because of their lousy .play this weekend. Contrary to popular belief, the Red Sox success this year has not been luck and their recent showing against the Yankees was no~ , indicative ofhow tltey are expected to play. The Red Sox consist of a solid bunch ofhitters anchored by one of the premier sluggers in the game, Mo Vaughn. They possess the best ERA in the AL and are led by a legitimate ace, Pedro Martinez, and a phenomenalcloser, Tom Gordon. Luck can be attributed to many things, butthe best ERA in the league? Yes, they are suspect in the field, but they are a much improved fielding team from a year ago when they finished 14th in the league. The Red Sox have improved in nearly every facet of the game andtheircurrentrecord is an example ofthis. The Red Sox most likely won't finish first in the AL East, but they will finish well above .500 and are a legitimate threat for the wild card. Yankee fans are foolish to think otherwise. Player ofthe Week Mark McGwire 1 B St. Louis Cardinals Mark McGwire became the first player in baseball history to have 25 homeruns before the end of June. McGwire has been on fire, hitting nine homeruns in his last seven games to lead the Cardinals. He has commanded such respect that the Giants intentionally walked him with two outs and nobody on in a tie game this past week.

Sports (!!nucarhiensis • May 28~ 1998 • Page 25 Jason Goldberg: Making a Difference On.an:d Off t:he Track by Jessica Goveia and Katie MacDowell Contributing Writers It will be hard to say goodbye to a dedicated student~athlete and an all around admirable .person. Now a senior, Iason Goldberg's start at Union College began with a parking ticketand car trouble on a recruitment trip for cross-country his senior year in high schooL Ironically, the \kid who breaks dowti at Union ends up at Union,\ stated Charlie Casey, head coach of the Cross Country team. \Maybe it Was fate.\ This \kid~' has impacted the Union community in numerous ways. This athlete from Staten Island, New York began his running career at Staten Island Technical High School and has been \on the run\ for eight years. since, It began with a pair of Saucony running shoes that were given to him by his father. Though Jason says, \Prior to running I had felt I was never much of an athlete,\ his hidden talent for running quickly emerged in a summer camp program. Soon, fellow runners and coaches took note of his talent and encouraged him to try out for the cross-country team. With four years of high school running under his belt, Jason took his talent with him to college. He commented that running was ''just part of me. I was good at it, en- joyed it and wanted to continue in co liege.\ An established track ath- lete, Jason has been a varsity run- ner all four years in cross-country, indoor track and outdoor track. Though injury has led to discour- agement over the years, he has still managed to run some impressive and highly respectable times, such as a personal best of 4:12 in the 1500 meters this past indoor sea- son. According to Casey, \Jay has had many good, solid perfor- mances. Jay finished 32\d at the state meet this year and at the re- gional meet, despite five miles of snow covered terrain, he finished 43rd with a time of26:53. Casey commented that \The regional meet at Saratoga, regardless of the snow, was possibly Jay's.:best race ever. Jay also had a strong show- ing at last years' state meet, in which .he was able to promote a remarkable team effort. Despite a fall within the last l 00 meters ofthe race, Jay rebounded and finished strongly passing someone at the line, which proved crucial in the team scoring.\ In addition Casey commented, \Jay is a meticulous and a thorough individual who leads his teammates by example. His detennination, strength, and leadership skills have shown throughout his four years of college athletics.\ Though .he has accom- · plished a gr.eat deal over his four years, Jay had a bumpy start to his college career when he was placed on aca:- demic warning. He soon be- gan spending much time in· the library throughout his· sophomore year, developing his study skills.

I just wanted to show my teammates that what .they saw the year before wasn't me and wanted to contribute more than I did the year before to the team.\ In addi~ tion to these. honors, Jason Goldberg has been a leader throughout, serving .as captain of the indoor and outdoor track teams his junior and senior years. Though most seniors are trying to limit their extracurricular activities and course load, Jason continues to take on more with devoted much of his time to the paper and began to make the Concordiensis office a second horne. He stayed around day and nights to make sure things were done correctly and quickly learned the tricks ofthe trade of publishing a newspaper. He soon moved up to sports editor for spring term his senior year and just recently he was r-ecommended to take the position of co- Editor-in-Chiefto fill an absence. Asides from the Concordiensis, Jason has dedicated much ofhis timethepast two years to Wells House where he resides and has served as pub He relations. committee chair this past year. On top of all these prior commitments, Jason decided to take up piano lessons this past teqn. \It had always been a dream of mine, and I knew that ifl did not start now with fonnal instruction it would be that much more difficult, if not impossible to start later on. I figured that if I got a background now I could continue to teach myself after graduating.\ Jason will be attending Brooklyn Law School in the fall and in addition to pur- suing a career in law, Jason plans to continue his run- ning career. He feels he \still has more to offer, and is too competitive to stop.\ Although he is excited to move on, he will dearly Jason Goldberg waiting to take the baton on a miss his teammates who he He received the John H .. Jenkins award for the best bibliographical work pub- lished during the year. Also Jason has made the UCAA All Academic Team twice, once for cross-country his sophomore year .and again his senior year for in- door track. Jason's hard work and discipline has not only paid off in academics but also in athletics. He was named MVP of cross-country team his sophomore year which he re- marked,\ [it] really meant a lot to me because I had worked extra hard to prove my running capabil- ity after an injury my freshman relay last year at a track meet·at RPI said are without a doubt each passing day in his final weeks one of the things he will remember at Union, but this should not be a the most about Union.

There is no doubt in anyone's mind that his contribu- tions have been above and beyond all expectations. As a matter of fact, while sitting here writing this ar- ticle, Jason's name was overheard by a fellow friend who quickly chimed in that Jason Goldberg is \one of the nicest people on cam- pus.\ Most anyone who knows Jason Goldberg would agree to this comment. He will do anything to help a friend in need and he is dedi- cated to everything he partakes in. It does not matter if he is sports editor or co-.editor, Jason is dedi- cated to any position. A member of the Concordiensis staff feels that previously there had been a power struggle with the Editors-in- Chief, but with Jason that struggle is non-existent. The staff member commented, \It is amazing how Jay Goldberg has done more in the past two weeks as Editors-in-Chief than most Editor-in-Chiefs have done in two years.\ Jason's dedication, especially to the track program will be hard for anyone to match. He has by far done the most for the track pro- gram here at Union than any other member and has made the voice of track heard. According to Casey, \Never before have we [cross- country and track teams] gotten as much coverage [in the Concordiensis].\ In addition to his track articles, WebPages and the \garbage bag I uniform episode\ ala Student Ath- letic Committee meeting, his dedi- cation to the team outshines all others. Jay's departure will be greatly missed. All of friends and teammates wish him the best of luck with his future endeavors. COME INTO MOTO PHOTO FOR SUPER SAVINGS! - 1041 State Street- 382-5776

Here on campus the celebration included music, food, games, and even a real live camel. Organized by the Jewish Stu- dent Union and Hillel, the event had been publicized around cam- pus for weeks. Helped by a cam- pus wide power outage, the fes- tivities started off with Professor Berk riding the camel in front of the Reamer Campus Center. From this amusing beginning, students could pay three dollars and ride the camel themselves. Sophomore Michael Winn who rode the camel commented, \It was an intense ride. I was glad that I got the opportunity to ride a camel.\ Until late in the after- noon there was a steady stream of students who wanted ride the camel. It was not only the stu- dents however who wanted to ride the camel. Professor Brown was seen riding the camel, as well as President Hull. At the same time as the rides were going on, free cup cakes with the colors oflsrael's flag, were be- ing distributed. Bright blue and wltite frosting covered several trays of these cupcakes, and into the second hour of tile day's events, only one tray remained of each. The mellow sounds ofeth- nic music accompanied those wlto were riding the camel, dining on the treats, or simply relaxing outside enjoying the day hang- C~ry Silken I President Hull on top of the world ,, ~ · · ing out on the grass or sitting on the benches. Besides food, music, and the camel, students also had a chance to browse material on Israel. Infor- mation about tenns abroad and the history of the country were also made available. Students could also purchase various books on differ- ent topics about the country. Some ofthe more interesting books dealt with ethnic cuisine, history of Jerusalem, and the story of the Jew- ish people. A surprise appearance by the Dutch Pipers added excitement to the day by singing a m.imber of clas- sic tunes. Students also had the chance to win golc:lfish from the Delta Gamma tab!~ .as the sisters sponsored a ping potJg ball toss to add to the festiv ites.

After roughly an hour of socializing with friends and fellow classmates, Shana Meyer '98, acting as mis- tress of ceremony for the evening, introduced Ruthie Strosberg '98 who revealed the gift to the excited crowd. This year's senior class gift is the creation of the Union Col- lege Mascot, a Dutchperson. Strosberg summarized what she believes is an exciting opportunity for her graduating friends. 'This is the beginning of tradition at Union College. It is a very special gift.\ Brian Jaecker '98 echoed Strosberg in suppeR ofth is unique gift, \I like the idea actually, though at first it seems a little goofy. But I think it has potential to serve its purpose well- to be a valuable con- tribution to the college. Union seems to have rather low school spirit for such a esteemed college, and hopefully this gift will be a step towards changing that.\ Each year, members of the graduating senior class customar- ily select a gift that allows them to provide Union with something missing and/or needed on the cam- pus.

Their work and plan- ning fmmed the bulk efthe moti- vation behind the establishing of UCARE Day. Weekly meetings were held with the heads of the houses involved to discuss pos- sible ideas and contributions. Af- ter months of preparing, it came as no surprise that the day was a com- plete success. Maria Vianna commented, \I just want to thank everyone for their help and participation. [ honestly hope that this will be a tradition that can be carried onto next year and every year thereafter.\ Although there were initially concerns that the event may have not been as successful due to the inclement weather, the rain did not prevent the children who attended from having a good time. The vari- ous activities were moved to Achil- les Rink and set up at boot.hs ... continuedfrompage 1 around the building. Approximately 400 children plus their families were in attendance. A large number of these children were part of the Big Brothers/Big Sisters program instituted at Union. Big Brothers and Big Sis- ters were there for the day to take their \Littles\ around the numer- ous booths and activities. Sopho- more Jen Caruso said, \My little sister really had a fun time. UCARE Day gave her the opportunity to just have a fun day filled with .activites and some very creative, .artistic projects like tie-dying and making spin art.\ Outside of the bonding between Bigs and Littles fo1:tered by the day's activities, many families were also able spend lime together in Achilles Rink. Walking through Achille's Rink, children ran from station to station, Jlarticipating in any number of fun events. Many young children tie- eyed with members of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority while others cre- ated their own original spin art us- ing a variety of paints. Sigma Chi tlad a series of sporting booths in- cluding variations on hockey, soc- cer and football. Children could also have the chance win a free goldfish or participate in a balloon toss with members of Tri-Delta. Some visitors found themselves engaged in Big Wheels relay races with AEPi or throwing tennis balls inan attempt to dunk a member of FIJI into a vat of cold water. Many also chose to make origami with Thurston House or bounce around on the blow-up trampoline or slide donated by money from Big Brothers/Big Sis- ters. Perhaps most exciting of all the booths was the \Zoo\ pro- moted by Psi Upsilon; complete with snakes, skunks, and even a cheetah. Most children went home with balloons and their faces painted by members of Smith House. They may have also been stuffed full with hamburgers, hot dogs, pop- com, cotton candy and ice cream served by the members of Phi Sigma Kappa. Hopefully, everyone went home with warm hearts and smiles on their faces. Emily Simon said of UCARE Day, \I found it overall to be ve1y successful. There was a lot of en- thusiasm from aU the houses in- volved. Everyone, from the parents to children to students, seemed to have an enjoyable time through the day.\ G!lllttarm.ensi5 • May 7, 1998 • Page 3 Green Day Set: t:o Take Hockey Winner of Grammy for Best Alternative Music Performance Comes to Union this Sunday Press Release Concert Committee This Sunday, May 10, 1998 at 7:30PM at Union College's Achil- les Rink, one ofthe most formative modern rock bands ofthe 1990's,..

Dookie, Green Day's m~or label debut, was released in the spring of 1994. Thanks to MTV support for the album's first single \Longview Dookie became a ma- jor hit.

The United States is one of the greatest powers of the world, and it therefore has a strong responsibility of maintain- ing a high system of social justice, democracy, and respect for human rights. These Iaber laws which ex- clude farm workers throw dirt on the face of this. great nation and its citi- zens. The fannworkersare witness- ing laws similar to slavery, which was a historical event we had thought hsd been overcomed. by Roberto Rodriguez Staff Writer On Monday April27, the Latino Heritage Month Comm.ittee pre- sented a faculty workshop titled, •• 1:.50 Y·ears ofUnited States Impe- rialism: 1848{ 1898) to the Present,\ moderated by Ricardo Laremont with Professors Andy Feffer, Sa- nih Henry., Teresa Meade from the History Department, lbon Izurieta (Modern Languages), and Tom Lobe{Politkal Science). The im- portance of this workshop is that l>oth 1848 and 1898 marked turn- ing points for the United States. In J:848 tile signing of the Treaty ()fGualdalupe Hildago, and in 1898 tile Spanish-American War brought tremendous changes in the United States foreign policy. Meade began the disctlssion by sl!ovving a video that dealt with the Californios in Northern California andtllesurrounding areas. She fo- cused on two main fi.gures, Mariano Vallejo, a very wealthy man of Spanish background, and Juan Seguin, the hero of the Alamo who foug.ht against Santa Ana. The video gave a concise descrip- tion of the life style of the Californios, a very wealthy group that did not have many-entrepre- nemial skills. Both Mariano Vallejo a11d Juan Seguin were robbed of their wealth when \the United States occupied o,ne third of Mexico with the s.igning of the 'Treaty of Gualdalupe Hidalgo. The treaty was a slav in the face for the Californio because it was written inEnglish. Both mendidnotknow h()W to speak English and as a con- sequence, they were driven out of Mexico. Izurieta spoke about the Genera- ti()n of 189Jl, Spanish authors who started writing at the beginning of tile 20th century when Spain lost its last colonies. Spanish imperial- ist power came to an end and the Generation of 1898 tried not only to create a new modern Spain, but also held ()n to the hope that they woul<l once again become a pow- erful empire. One of these Spanish Intellectuals, Ortega Gasset brought ab()ut the concept of \Particularismo.\ He raised valu- able questi()ns of the different re- gions that were created which separated Spain as a nation. The basic under.;tanding of the Genera- tion ()f 1898 was to look at Europe for modernization and industrializa- tion but attlle same time creating a racist society. Spain became ana- tion deeply troubled. The Span- iards forgot their cultural heritage and tried to ad()pt to the white mentality. The decl ilte of Spanish power allowed the United States to be- C()me the next super power. Pro- fesscr Henry concentrated on the issue of race and the \white man's btuden.\ The \white man's bur- den,\ meaning the white race up- 1 ifting the darker race. The war became a clear example wllere race became a key issue. The Spanish American War served as a vehicle where both nations would feed on one another. For instance, the United Stat-es supported the Cu- bans bec~use tlleythoughtCubans w~re wlliter tllan 1he Spaniards. UnfortmJately, while fighting the war, the Americans experienced that the Cllba11s had a profound African il egacy. American's racist mind pre-vented tll:e Spaniards from allying \\lith Cuba. The Spanish- Americal! War :is the creation of something hat already existed, which is tile .racist attitude. Theodore Rooosevelt said that to be white~s:t()IJe a man and muscu- lar. He ~onsi<lered the Caribbean islands as w ea:k and portrayed them as dark females. Tobeawhite man is thl(l n.ati(:}n equality of man- hood.

Wilson Augustuve, a . former migrant farmworker stated how it was an honor to advocate . for the struggle ofthe farm worker. More importantly, he said, \We will no longer be silent, our voices will be heard. We will not back d0wn. We will not be divided. We have picked up powerful allies in our cry for equality.\ Wilson's words set the mood for the rest of the rally . with these energetic words. The next speaker was Aspacio Alcantara, a resident of the Domiai- can Republic who was a former farmworker and now is an advo- cate for farm workers' rights. Alcantara said this is the fourth ages, and: black skinpeople would year in which advocates came to affect tbem.

The There are six imp{)rtant sectors which work in agriculture that in- cludes farm owners, farm workers, food and medicine processors, in- tevrnediaries, distriblltors, and con- sumers. These six groups must assume responsibil.ity and put in their grain of sand to end the ex- clusions which discriminate against justice and dignity of farm workers. Alcantara ended his speech by thanking legislators who support the fannworkers. He hopes when many citizens discover what is happening, they will raise in .support for the fannworkers, and that the farm workers at the end de- serves their human dignity. \If you want peace, fight for justice.\ States bu i!t a Na\y to protect its Alcantara continued that interest after the sinking of the Vir- ginia in 1962. The third point is the popular sliruggle in which the Cu- bans werae not pleased to see the United St~tesdefe:at the Spaniards. As well the Filipinos were not pleased boy the action that Ameri- cans took which tortured Filipinos and bumed ma11y villages. This has become a.n ongoing memory for the Filipin()S which is difficult to forget. The foLtrtll point is neo- colonialism vvbich is cultural impe- rialism.

Cross Talk on Rush by Brooke Barylick StaffWriter Theta Delta Chi and Gamma Phi Beta sponsored a Crosstalk on Wednesday, April 29, in Old Chapel. 'Ihe topic of the discus- sion was the proposed sophomore rush. This proposal was drawn up by the fa<:ulty of Union College. The purpose of moving rush to sophomore year has been dis- cussed many times throughout Union's bistory. The talks have escalated recently because of the faculty vote of 119 to 2 in favor of moving the rush and pledging pro- cess to sophomore year. As stated in the April 23. issue of the Concordiensis, the faculty hopes that by moving rush to sophomore year, freshmen will make a more educated decision about Greek life. They will have had an ent1re year to acclimate themselves to college before hav- ing to make such a major decision. Secondly, this would aiJow senior members of Greek organizations to live in houses and subsequently provide anatmosphere of maturity. Thirdly, the faculty argues that sophomore rush will eliminate the negative effect of rush on fresh- man academic work. Two more arguments stem from these. Union's large number of newly established Theme Houses and social alternatives will have an opportunity to expand if rush is moved. It will also have an effect on helping Union to increase its status as a:n academic institution, which th.efaculty feels is the main objectiveofthe college. Dean Alford welcomed everyone to the event and stated that the · purpose of the Crosstalk was to have the Student Affairs Council (SAC) listen to the concerns and comments ofthe students to help them gain new perspective and in- sight on the issue. Dean Alford hoped that this would be the first of many (iiscussions, because he realized the seriousness of the pro- posal and the effects that it will have on the college. Three panelists gave their opin- ions before the floor was opened to rerrial'k~ from the audience. Se- nior Chrissy Foster spoke against sophomore rush. She argued that students sllould be able to make their own-choices as a freshman to rush or not. Social options such as whether or not to go Greek should not be reg;ulated by the College. Foster questioned, \If sophomore rush is implemented, does that in- fer that aU clubs, activities, sports, and Theme Houses will begin then?'' She also felt that poor aca- demic performance can not be blamed solely on Greek organiza- tions. Foster arguea that if one is to do poorly in school, he will do poorly whether he is pledging freshman year or sophomore year. worked at GE in the early 1900's and founded the Electrical Engi~ neering Department at Ullion. The Symposium, which began in 1991, offers Union students the unique opportunity to present tile results of undergraduate research they have done in the past yeai. Simi- lar to NCUR, the National Confer- ence on Undergraduate Research, theses and projects are Jlresented from ma.ny areas of study, from Computer Science to Anthropol- ogy. The difference between the Steinmetz Symposium and NCUR is that the Symposium is held \for Union, by Union,\ not on a national scope. To hear the presentations, you don't have to travel to Mary- land for a weekend, just walk into Humanities on Friday afternoon. As always, all afternoon classes from I 2: 15 and later are canceled on Friday afternoon to prov·ide stu- dents with the opportunity to at- tend the various presentations. Symposium Programs will beavai.l- able in Humanities, Sociai.Sciences, the Arts Building, the Reamer Cam- pus Center, and the Associate The second speaker wa.s faculty member Adrian Frasier. He reiter- ated the purposes and goals of the proposal that the professors cre- ated and reminded the audience that this is strictly a movement from the faculty, not from the .adminis- tration. His main argument stated thatthe quality of the jobs at Union suffer because of the Greek sys- tem. He felt that the planning and effort that the faculty put into their classes is wasted when people do not come to class or sleep during class time. By moving rush back one year the professors feel that students will be more mature and hopefully make the best choice for themselves, thus eliminating the negative effects that pledging has on the students and th.eir work. The final panelist was senior Jim Kochan who was in favor of sopho- more rush, stated that a large tran- sition must be made to acclimate to college life. During the high school years, most stlldents are coddled by their teachers~ He claimed that students need a year to adjust to the academic and so- cial aspects of college before hav- ing to make a decision to rush or not. Having rush sophomore year would give students the opportu- nity that they need to mature them- selves. Many students were upset by the opinions and remarks that were made. Some approached the micro- phone to express their views, white others spoke out from their seats. Heated discussions took place be- tween members of the faculty and the student body.

I am running for Student Forum President. Although my school in- • volvement has been rather recent, I have made up for my lost time by immersing rnyselfi~ numerous activities. My ilwolvement has en com- . passed activities Sl:lch as Vice-Presidenn of the Inter-Fraternal Council • (lFC), Chairman of the Greek Conduct Committee, Chairman of the Greek Week Committee, and a member ()f tme Student Conduct Committee. Despite the fact that my activities are largely \Greek\ oriented, I feel that . I have a vast knowledge of the opinions of the campus as a whole. I consider myself a very open-minded and levelheaded individual. My greatest attribute, however, is my commitmentto accomplishi11g the tasks that I have set .out to do. An exam.pl.e of this persistence was the orga- nization and success of Greek Week. With the help of my committee, Greek Week became a large-scale success, rather than the mediocre, · sparsely atteAded events that it had been in he past. My great ability to delegate authority has resulted in not only a suc- cessful Greek Week, but the growing strength and influence of the Greek Conduct Committee. For example, ou:r campus wide survey called \I Know What You Did Last Weekend;~ through its overwhelming re- sponse, sent the overall message to the administration of the inherent dangers of a \dry weekend.\ Innovated methods, such as those mentioned above, will be a critical aspect in my service to Union College as your representative to the Student Forum. My blossoming interests in student and school opera- tions have caused me to set my sights ()11 further improvement within the school. I'm dedicated with my time: and effort to provide the repre- sentation you as the campus community desire. My qualifications and knowledge to handle given issues ami delegate authority effectively will be beneficial to what needs to be, and what can be accomplished. Thank you for your time and consideration. Robert Bennett V.P. of Multicultural Affairs Hello, Sincerely yours, Jesse J. Edelman My name is Robert J. Benneti. I am currently a sophomore majoring in psycho log) with a minor in J\Olitical science. I am running for the position of Vice President of Multicultural Affairs because I, along with many of my peers, feel the need fo1r change here at Union College. I have observed that there is not enoLJgh cultural understanding be- tween groups on this campus. In order to better one's self, one must learn the art of communication. Through communication, one can learn of other cultures, their experiences and of their history. This is important because society is not comprised solely of one type of individual. In- stead, society is very diverse. College is an excellent environment through which we can learn to communicate with people of different sexes, religions, and ethnic back- ground. In my two years at Union C()lleg.e, I have found thatthis campus is not as diverse as it could be; this is a ;result of the following causes: a) There is a lack of representation of different cultures in the student as well as faculty and staff population. b) People no longer feel the need nor the responsibility of learning or simply trying to understand a different culture from their own. I have attended several race discussions held throughout much of the past weeks, and through these discussi<tns I have noticed promise and hope in the dialogues for change. I have also witnessed first hand, the lack of understanding and igno- rance that permeates through our campus toward other cultures. I too am guilty ofsuch ignorance and I seek to make change. If elected, I plan to do my best to resolve the problems that I see. I plan to bring many different groups together through multiple cultural awareness work- shops as well as diversity worksh()ps. Next year, during freshmen ori- entation I plan to implement mandatott\y race dialogues, so those stu- dents may have a better understanding of one another. I understand that I am a single person, and cannot possibly know what effects each and very individLJal 011 this campus. So with the help of you, my fellow students, I hope to make change on this campus. I will work to make Union College a more diversified, unified and well-rounded, school for the present students and those to come. Sincerely, Robert J. Bennett Molly Shaner Junior Trustee I am running for Junior Trustee because I want to be involved in Union's \master plan.\ Through the Concordiensis, I have kept myself informed of the physical changes the master plan proposes, and l atn in tune with the impact that it will have on student life. My unique quality, which distinguishes me from the other candidates, is passion. Josh Mon,dlick I am enthusiastic in all of my efforts. As J, read the plan devised by the Board of Trustees, I did not apatheticaUy brush the article aside. Instantly, I had the desire to get involved. I have many ideas that would enhance the current plan. I am confident that I posses the qualities needed to succeed as Junior Trustee. V.P. of Academics Having attended Union for al- most three years, l have identified what 1 think are the fundamental flaws in the academic policy. Lis- tening to student complaints and problems with classes has finally led me to do one thing ... run for office and change all that is wrong with the academic program. Some ()fmy plans include getting credit for all science labs, working out the kinks with the new engineering pro- gram, and finally developing bet- ter alternatives to the freshman preceptorial class. In addition, I plan to implement a better method to increase student awareness of the comparison between Union College course hours and semes- ter school credits. My name is Josh Mondlick, and I am runr1ing for VP of Academics. I am the right choice for the job, and I feel your academic pain. The person who fills this position must be versatile. While acting as a representative of the student body, the Junior Trustee must also be able to convey the student perspective to the Board. i am capable of approaching issues with an open mind and when I feel strongly about a position, I will pursue it aggressively. I am not concerned with bring- ing attention to myself. Instead, I will ask what I can do to help or how can I improve Union. I will display a natural and even manner when deal i11g with the youngest student to the most veteran Board member. In my two years at Union, I have joined various organizatioJils. I am an active member of our community, but something is still missing. Up until this point, I have not had an outlet for my opinions and ideas ab<JUt the Union college community as a whole. In .the swirling tornado of political controversy which so often en- shrouds student government leaders in visible positions, I assure you that I have the ability to maintain my equilibrium in the toughest of tirnes. I would appreciate your support and most importantly, please re- member to vote. Daniel Pesikoff VP. ofFinance Fellow students, for those of you who do not know me or are not familiar with me, my name is Daniel Pesikoffand I'm running for Vice President of Finance. Let me introduce myself and answer a few of your questions. I've been a man beilind the scene. For the past three years I have been managing tile accounts for a number of campus organizations. To give you a quick run -through: Treasurer Hillel2 years, Treasurer IFC Treasurer AEPi 2 years, Finance Representative 112 year. So that's my laundry list of ac- tivities. As you can see many dif- ferent organizations have en- trusted me with theiraccounts over the past three years. Through these organizations, I have gained the knowledge and experience needed to be an effective Vice President of Finance. This posi- tion 11equires someone with a strong work ethic, strong moral sense, interpersonal skills, and most of all honesty and integrity. Basically, I feel I am the best candi- date for this position as I feel I can cover all these roles. In addition to overseeing the Respectfully Submitted Molly H. Shaner Student Forum President Dear Cam pus Community, my name is Beth Wierzbien iec and I want to be your next Student Forum President. I feel that the students on this campus have power to make things happen. I feel that if the we, the student community, see an injustice we should not let it continue, we should do whatever we can to make sure that are concerns are heard and understood. I feel that there needs to be more open lines of communication so every individual's opinion can be expressed. As Student Forum Presi- dent I would make sure that there are more outlets for open discuss ion on topics that are disheartening to the campus community. I also feel that to make these things work you must be PRO-ACTIVE in the ap- proach. I take things on with the intent ()f finishing and reaching the goals set. Next year, if elected to President, there will be more regularly scheduled Town Meetings, to act as a forum for students' voices to be heard. Also next year I will create a forum for all club presidents to meet and inform the other presidents of their club's activities so that the information can be passed on to the entire campus community. To reach the goals set one must understand the \system\ in which we are a part. Over the past years at Union I have become acclimated to almost every different resource on this campus. My involvement on campus- whether it be as Student Forum Class Representative, mem- ber of the Student Affairs Cound I (SAC), -co-chair of Dialogues on Race, amemberofBig Brothers Big Sisters, a memberofC.E.L.A.,amemberof local Schenectady outreach programs such as St. Claire's Hospital or Elmer Elementary School, my involvement with the Admissions office, a 11\ember of the Multicultural Advisory Group, or just my overall involve- ment on campus- has given me a solid foundation so that next year I will know who to go to with the concerns that are voiced so that some form of action can be taken. I would like to express to the campus community my desire to listen to everyone's concerns. I feel that everyone has the rightto be heard, and I will betheoneto listen and relay the information to the campus. I truly care about the entire campus and the concerns that are prevalent today.

At Union, it seems as though any change suggested which affects Greeks, Greekhousing, Greek dining, alcohol on campus, pledg- ing rituals, etc., is taken by many students as an outright attack on the future of Greek life at Union. The sophomore rush issue is no differ- ent. To say that I participated in the faculty vote on the issue of sopho- more rush virtually reveals what side I am on. My vote was not an attack, but it was a vote to change Greek life at Union. I honestly believe that the change would be for the better, and you will have to believe me when I say that since last Wednesday I have spoken to a number of students who also think the sophomore rush would be better than the current system. (Someone at the Crosstalk called out, \Where are all the students in favor of sophomore rush?\ I say that the tone in ~~~~~~==========~---------------~~~--~~hkhilie~~tioow~~b~~dilie~re~fu~~pMh~n•the A Ob • • V • h meeting suggests why those voices were not heard. To speak would n · · Je:cttve ·tew tot e A~<t> Situation havebeentostepint~thelion'sden.) One reason given by faculty for favoring sophomore rush is to let by David Kay Opinions Edit~r Instead of writing my weekly column, this week I have decided to devote the same space t<> some- thing more substantial a.nd mean- ingful; something wh icb has be- come a \hot issue\ more or less over the past few weeks_ For a number of weeks, my sec- tion has become a battlegroLtnd for both ADPhi and the administuation to voice their opinions o\er the is- sue of converting the house to the new admissions building. Instead of reading another subjective let- ter from either a brother ()r a<lmin- istrator, I have decided tQ state an objective opinion grounded in facts. After I ignorantly wr<>te last week that the roof of A.D?hi's house was \falling in,\ I 'Was taken on a tour by one of the br<Jthers through the house to find that the only reason parts of it -were dilapidated was because the house is over I 00 years old. However, considering the age of the house, I would say that it is in good condition. After a great deal of research, I have found that the school's decision to repossess the A.lpha Delta Phi House is both cout:J:a- dictory to the original colltract and hypocritical. The decision is hypocritical consideri11g the fact that they refuse to con vert the President's house on the gr<Junds of tradition, yet the fratemity bouse has been in place for over 100 years. From the administration's point of view, the house is obviously a prime spot. With over 12,000 square feet and a close pFox::imity to Union Street, it also has a beau- tiful exterior that would attract in- coming students. Shirin Pasavand of the Daily Gazette wroteon April 28 (section B I) that \it ~the A DPhi house) is a three story bouse with colonnades rising from a wrap- around porch-graceful look ofthe building and its proximity to the main campus entrance .()ff Union Street are its main attractions.\ However, despite the fact til at the house may be convenient a.ndaes- thetically appealing, the adrninis• tration seems to forget tbe contract they made with Alpha Delta Phi. Chip Cannon, an alumnus from the class of 1987 and a former ADPhi brother, confirms this fact. \The term of the original lease was 99 years, but was subsequently modi- fied by a series of agreements be- tween the college and ADPhi ul- timately extending the lease until 2035.\ The administration and ADPhi are in dispute concerning this lease and whether it is still in ef- fect-the college says that the last lease extension (stated above) wasn't valid. However, even if ADPhi has a lease, Dean Alford said, the college can terminate it and buy the building at any time if the trustees approve it. Parsavand of the Daily Gazette states that \ADPhi owns its house, however it leases the land where it sits from the college.\ This fact has led brothers to question the administrative takeover of the house. Suggestions by the admin- istration to physically move the house to another site on campus have come up in discussions, however is not at the forefront of alternatives at the present time. Perhaps the most hypocritical statement made by administration recently was that which invali- dated the idea of converting the president's house to the new ad- missions building. They argue that, by doing this and moving the house to Lenox Road (a proposed site), that would mean breaking tradition. \Roger Hull does not want to be the president who decides to break the chain of history,\ said Diane Blake, vice president for finance and administration. \Be- sides, the president's house is tucked away behind Payne Gate and lacks the visual appeal of the AD Phi house,\ she continued. However, the administration does not hold the tradition of ADPhi in equal regard. \The fraternity's attachment to its house is more than sentimental,\ said Jon Kreevoy, a junior and ADPhi brother. \If we are put in another building, I think a lot of those tra- ditions would just die.\ The administration also fails to recognize the fact that the frater- nity has spent over $350,000 on structural and cosmetic improve- ments for the house over the past fifteen years. Dan Laible, a senior and AD Phi brother, states \the ad- ministration is well aware of this fact and the amount of time and money we have put into the house. They just don't take it into regard ... they think that taking the house is good for the college and that nothing else should take pre- cedent.\ Alumnus Chip Cannon pro- poses that \Union's recent expul .. sion of fraternities and sororities such as Delta Phi, Delta Chi, Beta Theta Pi and Delta Delta Delta have led or eventually will lead to their subseqt!ent dissolution.\ He believes that the same will happen with ADPhi. \Along with ADPhi, Union does not in- tend to renew the leases for Sigma Phi and Phi Delta Theta.\ Is the action of moving ADPhi simply another attempt by the administration to move away from a strong Greek sys- tem? In last week's Concordiensis, Dean Lundquist of Admissions wrote that \As one who saw his college (Amherst) radically change-go coeducational and ban fraternities-for the better, I am not surprised by the (strongly negative) reaction ... colleges are institutions that need to change; they need to foster growth and de- velopment.\ However, this growth is not nec- essarily in line with the desires of the student body. ADPhi has col- lected o'\ier 900 petitions from the student body to keep the house at its present site, however the admin- istration still holds that popular ap- peal is for taking the house. Dan Laible suggests that the adminis- tration will use any support it can get to support the takeover. \Despite popular opinion from the student body and from alumni as well as the fact that a signed agreement has been made with the school, the administration has been unwilling to consider alternative sites.\ freshmen have more time to acclimate themselves to college life, and to the academic rigors ofthe Union calendar. I do sympathize with the second-teJm freshmen trying to decide What to do about rush. I was chair ofthe Student Affairs Council nearly ten years ago when rush went from Fall to Winter term .of the freshman year. Until the last minute, I thoughtthen that we had an agreement to move rush to sopho- more year, but was disappointed in the end. My main reason for supporting sophomore rush lies at the other end of the age spectrum. I think fuat the Greek houses would be even more socially responsible than they now are if their members in residence were juniors and seniors. I would like to see more seniors living on campus, providing leadership to their organizations. The tone of cam- pus social and intellectual life would change for the better if seniors (Greeks and independents alike) did not flee off campus. Since Greek houses now host so muchofUnion's social life, having more seniors in residence in them is especially important. For the discussion of sophomore rush to proceed, lots of issues need to be considered and resolved: Is there enough housing to accommo- date more juniors and seniors staying on campus? How will Union and the Greek organizati<Jns cope with one no-rush year? Will all Greek organizations get beyond the us-versus-them standoff in which no side listens to any other. Doug Klein Chair, Department of Economics May 4, 1998 A Call for Sentimentality I am writing this letter in hopes that deaf ears may he attuned to hearing the voice of an indepen- dent, an outsider. Have you ever been inside the Alpha Delta Phi house completely alone at night? I was. As I stood there in spooky si- lence, I felt a movement. It was the movement of hundreds of souls that have lingered through- out the years. I realized that the house is more than a material ob- ject, it's a living symbol of an aged fraternity. Everyday I go to work at the Lamont House. This was the old DU building, abuilding that I was never able to experience in its heyday. As I pass through the old door I regret not knowing how :beautiful this place really once was. Not beautiful in the sense of plush carpets and perfectly pol- ished furniture, but of the full and robust life it contained'. How sad it is to see the walls ache to hold clanking copier machines and stacks of paperwork. There is a certain element to life that goes bey<>nd the fast paced money-making drive. I 'H be damned if my two younger sis- ters, future Union students, must feel this same absence of a life that they never had the chance to know. Killed before its time. President Hull will not consider his home for an Admissions build- ing because of its sentimental value. How many more thousands of memories will he be killing by taking down the house of AD? I'm sorry, there is no compromise. Moving the brothers to another site is like trying to remove an oyster from its shell. The essence of AD will die. If a person like me, who will never know the thrill of an AD brotherhood, feels this passion- ately, there must be something that you are overlooking or ultimately ignoring. Maybe it's easier for you to harden your heart. That way you won't have to feel remorse when a hundred years of laughter are snuffed out as AD is transformed into a meaningless doormat. What value does an admissions building have to the everyday life of a Union student? I plead with you, this undistinguished and unaccept- able advance to the future will bring this campus an unsurpassed emptiness. I swear this will haunt you for the rest of your life. I hope you are well prepared.

\ I' -~' ,,\ • \ OP/:EJ) 1 How Lazy Are We? In another odd attempt at in~reasing monetary revenue from the campus community, the school has decided .to introduce a college version of\Meals on Wheels.\ The Retail Mobile Cart that has been parading around campu~ is honestly a strange sight to behold. As jf Union College was not already too country-club-esque, we now have a fully functional cart that drives around and caters to those sunbath- ers and loungers laying out on any one of the campus' grassy fields. Although the convenience of mobile food may have been part of the reasoning behind the introduction of this new concept, it does seem like a waste of money and energy to provide this sort of service to college students. (Especially those residing 011 a campus as small as this one). The mobile cart's route runs through the construction site, and this does allow the workers on campus easier access to food. However, for the rest of the students, this new addition to the Union scene is, simply stated, weird. From any point on campus, how far is the campus center in terms of walking distance? Honestly, we are not talking miles here, or even anything close to that. The concept of\Meals on Wheels\ was cre- ated to serve ,the meeds oft:erminally ill individuals or invalids, is that what college students have since become? Are we that lazy and so unmotivated, that either a little car has to deliver food to us or we wi II simply starve due to apathy? There may not be any clear-cut answers to these questions. Granted, the Retail Mobile Cart may provide a nice convenience to many, but it is essentially purposeless. On a broader note, what does this cart say about the Union community? The laziness of college students has already formed the basis of every negative stereotype surrounding young adults. Although the concept of a personalized food delivery service isn't really extreme enough to deserve this much attention, the implications of it are what matter. The idea of having everything \at one's fingertips\ is a bit out of control. Automobiles have basically made the concept of walking for functional purposes obsolete. Telephones and internet connec- tions have replaced face to face communication. Home delivery of any variety of food has destroyed the need for dining out. Basically, sitting in one strategically engineered position in the home for the rest of one's life is a completely plausible outcome considering the recent \innovations\ in convenience. Honestly, though, by feeding these incessant desires for more con- venient living; we cease to actually be living. Existing in a world of idleness and indolent behavior is the fate of this generation. We may actually already be there, and something as silly as a little car of snacks and beverages is indicative of that fact. • ..

Science & ·ie'chnology Science & Technology Ever Wonder How Supermarket Scanners Work? by Jeffrey Ausfeld Staff Writer The whole process begins with the UPC symbol that is found on the side or back of every product in the store. This symbol is a collection of black bars with different widths that uniquely describe the product in terms ofnumbers. The set of numbers for the prod- uct are located underneath the black bars on the label, and it is these numbers that the store programs into their computer for the scanning equipment. It is a combined effort on the part of the store and the scanning equipment that allows the bar code to be read. beam of light that could be scanned rapidly across the bars in order to measure their widtbs. Conventional light sources in the 40'sbarely worked and the idea didn't catch on until lasers became available. space like a tiny searchlight. This laser just searches the area above the glass plate wait- ing for a recognized label. When this light beam encounters a UPC label, each dark bars absorbs the beam while each light bar reflects it. It is odd how the laser scans the white part between the bars and notthebars t!Jemselves. Essentially, the laser emits a certa.in known amount of laser light and when ithits a black and white pat- tern such as a U:PC symbol, only a certain amount and pattem of light comes back to the scanner. Thus, as the beam scans across the UPC label, the amount of light the prod- uct reflects fluctua.tes up and down in a char- acteristic manner. When a photodetector in the UPC scanner c:letects such a fluctuating reflected light sigml, it determines that the laser beam is hitting a UPC label and searches the store \'s database for a match to the incoming pattern. A computer studies the sequence of the light and dark bars to determine exactly what UPC label is be~ng hit and identifies the product to the store's register. The laser beam is very sensitive and, due to the way in which it works, small defects in the system cause glitches. Defects like worn, tom, and even labels on pr()d- ucts with soft surfaces will often not be able to be scanned. The glass plate on the scaon- ner must also be kept v'ery clean becattse even an oily fingerprint causes the laser to be scattered. Even with the problems with the sensitivity and occasional glitches, UPC scanners allow supermarkets to move large amounts of food and products to their clls- tomers in a timely fashion. I wonder w!Jat would happen if a different store brand ra- bel were to be scanned. Maybe I'll do jUlst that this summer. Although the ideaofUPC labels was first conceived by Norman Joseph Woodland in the late 1940's, the scheme to read those codes required a very bright and narrow A modern UPC scanner begins with a la- ser that emits a tightly collimated beam of light. Early scanners used helium-neon la- sers, but new scanners use cheaper and more reliable solid-state or diode lasers. These types (:lflasers are easy to mass-produce and are the main element in any laser scanning equipment. In a typical scannet, the red beam from a laser is directed toward a spin- ning object~ither a carefully placed, mir- rored disk or a flat disk containing a care- fully designed etching on its surface. Laser light that reflects from the spinning object emerges from the glass windQw above the scanner and sweeps rapidly through the Marine Studies Term Abroad Next Spring Bermuda Woods Hole Newfoundland Soc: 58 Marine Policy Bio: 56 Coastal Biology T.Ab. 55 Env.

Prospects dim for U.S.-brokered Mideast talks JERUSALEM (Reuters)- Prospects for a Middle East peace breakthrough at talks in London on Monda.y appeared increasingly doomed as Israel rejected a U.S.-proposed transfer of 13 percent more of the West Bank to Palestinians. An Israeli spokesman said on Sunday it would be \utterly impossible\ for Israel to accept the figure durin~ Secretary of State Madeleine Albrigllt's separate meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat. \I think the (U.S.) administration knows our position. It would be utterly impossible for Israel to adhere to a withdrawal of l3 percent;\ David Bar-JUan, Netanyahu's communications chief, toJd Reuters. After weeks of U.S. diplomacy, Albright was hoping to negotiate ·the Israeli transfer of more West Ban~ land to Palestinian self-rule outlined in an interim peace deal and so break a more than I 3 -month-old peace-- making deadlock. Arafat has accepted the proposed !tan dover of 13 percent, having initially wanted 30 percent. Israel has publicly accepted nine percent, because of what it calls both security and national interests, apparently Jewish settlements, althou!;h Western and Arab diplomats say Israel has privately hinted it coulcl accept nearly 11 percent.

Report: U.S. seeks to avoid land mine ban NEW YORK {Reuters) - The Clinton administration is seeking to scrap a law that would impose a one- year moratorium on U.S. use of anti-personnel land mines beginning next February, The New York Times reported Sund~y. \With the deadline looming, Secretary of Defense William Cohen and other Pentagon officials have steppea up their opposition in public and priv~te appeals to Congress,\ the paper said. The moratorium was signed into law two years ago but only comes into effect February 12, 1999. Drafters of the law hoped the measure would spur the Pentagon into searching for alternatives to anti-personnel lana mines. The United States has refused to sign a separate international treaty backed by more than l 00 nations that would ban the weapons. The New York Times reported that military commanders feared the one-year moratorium would reduce their options in the event of an unexpected conflict involving U.S. troops, like the 1991 Gulf War. The paper said Cohen and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton, had sent a letter on the issue to the chairman ofthe Semte Committee on Armed Services, Strom Thurmond of South Car<l- lina. The letter expressed grave concern over the moratorium and asked for the power to waive it, the paper said. Marines face hearing on fatal Italian accident CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (Reuters)- Two U.S. Marine Corps crewmen this week face a military tribuna[ investigating an accident in which their surveillance jet severed lift cables at an Italian ski resort, killing 2()i skiers and straining relations between the two countries. In the first of two military court proceedings scheduled in the case, two Marine airmen manning the rear seats of the surveillance jet are expected to argue they had no control over the streaking aircraft during the: fateful low-level training mission, thedr attorneys said. Military prosecutors allege the EA-6B Prowler was flying too low and too fast on February 3 when it severed two gondola cables at a ski resort near Cavalese, Italy. Twenty people inside a gondola heading Uj) the mountain plunged to their deaths. \The cable strike was not a onetime altitude miscalculation because the mishap aircraft flew lower ami faster than authorized whenever the terrain permitted. The aircrew violated the flight restrictions on this low- level route,\ a Marine investigative report said. Source: www.yahoo.com

Early scanners used helium-neon la- sers, but new scanners use cheaper and more reliable solid-state or diode lasers. These types of lasers are easy to mass-produce and are the main element in any laser scanning equipment. In a typical scanner, the red beam from a laser is directed toward a spin- ning object--either a carefully placed, mir- rored disk or a flat disk containing a care- fully designed etching on its surface.

I> Prospects dim for U.S .-brokered Mideast talks JERUSALEM (Reuters)- Prospects for a Middle East peace breakthrough at talks in London on Monday appeared increasingly doomed as Israel rejected a U.S.-proposed transfer of I 3 percent more of the West Bank to Palestinians. An Israeli spokesman said on Sunday it would be\utterly impossible\ for Israel to accept the figure during Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's separate meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat. \I think the (U.S.) administration knows our position. It would be utterly impossible for Israel to adhere to a withdrawal of 13 percent,\ David Bar-IIIan, Netanyahu's communications chief, told Reuters. After weeks of U.S. diplomacy, Albright was hoping to negotiate the Israeli transfer of more West Bank land to Palestinian self-rule out! ined in an interim peace deal and so break a more than 13-month-old peace- making deadlock. Arafat has accepted the proposed handover of 13 percent, having initially wanted 30 percent. Israel has publicly accepted nine percent, because of what it calls both security and national interests, apparently Jewish settlements, although Western and Arab diplomats say Israel has privately hinted it could accept nearly I I percent. In Cairo, visiting U.S. Vice President AI Gore said the London talks provided an important opportunity to jump-start peacemaking but declined to speculate on the consequences of failure. \There is a long way to go in the peace process regardless of the outcome of the London meeting,\ Gore told a joint news conference with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Report: U.S. seeks to avoid land mine ban NEW YORK (Reuters)- The Clinton administration is seeking to scrap a law that would impose a one- year moratorium on U.S. use of anti-personnel land mines beginning next February, The New York Times reported Sunday. \With the deadline looming, Secretary of Defense William Cohen and other Pentagon officials have stepped up their opposition in public and private appeals to Congress,\ the paper said. The moratorium was signed into law two years ago but only comes into effect February 12, 1999. Drafters of the law hoped the measure would spur the Pentagon into searching for alternatives to anti-personnel land mines. The United States has refused to sign a separate intemational treaty backed by more than 100 nations that would ban the weapons. The New York Times reported that military commanders feared the one-year moratorium would reduce their options in the event of an unexpected conflict involving U.S. troops, like the 1991 Gulf War. The paper said Cohen and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton, had sent a letter on the issue to the chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, Strom Thurmond of South Caro- lina. The letter expressed grave concern over the moratorium and asked for the power to waive it, the paper said. Marines face hearing on fatal Italian accident CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C.

Pag-ett Sliding Doors Have you ever wondered what would happen if you decided to run and catch a bus rather than wait for the next one. Or how about if you accelerated instead of break- ing for a yellow J,ight. The unpredictable effects of a relatively minor event are explored in Sliding Doors, which shows bow a seemingly insignificant event can have drastic conse- quences. Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a public relations executive whose life begins to fall apart. She has just been fired from her job, and, on her way home, she narrowly misses catching her train in the London underground ... or does she. At this point, the movie splits in two, switching bac::k and forth be- tween two alternate worlds: the first is where Helen caught the train, while the other is where the doors closed in her face. It's one minor difference, yet the effects cascade into completely different directions. In the world where she catches the train, she arrives home to dis- cover her boyfriend, Gerry (John Lynch), in the middle ofan affair with an American woman (Jeanne Ttipplehom); While this event devastates Helen at first, in the long run it makes hera.stFonger woman. As she pursues a new career, she be- gins a new life with her new love, James (John Hannah). However, in the alternate reality where she missed the train, her life turns out radically different. Helen never walks in en Gerry, and thus he continues his af- fair with Lydia. In order to support the man she loves, Helen is forced to work multiple me- nial jobs to sup- port the two .ofthem. Paltrow manages the double role well, proving that her recent dol- drums has heen the result of poor material (i.e. The Pallbearer) rather than a lack of talent. Her next big role will be in this summer's thriller A Perfect Murder (the remake of ''There are two sides to every story. Helen is about to live both of them ... at the same time. What if one split sec- ond sent your life in two different di- rectio:ns? Helen is about to find out.'' Alfred Hitchcock's Dial Mfor Mur- der), wher.e she will portray Emily Hayes. This is the first romantic comedy that we have reviewed this term. We thought that the parallel story lines would be similartothe 1991 comedy He Said, She Said, where one story line is played out, then the other. This was not the case; this film jumps back and forth between the two alternate futures. We found it a little difficult at first to keep the sto- ries straight at first, but thank God for a bandage and a haircut, which minimize the confusion, thus making it easier to follow two stories. An unfortunate side effect of the split story line is repetition. One of the crucial plot points takes place four separate times, which almost detracted from the film. Rating: Since this is a \romantic comedy, I have decided that it would be only fair to rate this movie into separate categories: 1) If you are a . ·Full Price 2) If you are a on a date: Full Price 3) If you are a guy: Late Night TV (for those nights when the hand control is on the other side of the room and you don't want to make the effort to getup.) Next Week's Movie: Deep Impact College Center Movie of the Week: Good Will Hunting For those of you who have yet to see Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's Grammy Award winning screenplay, here is a quick review of the movie: Wildly charismatic. Impossibly brilliant. Totally rebeJiious. For the first 20 years of his life, Will Hunting has called the shots. Now he's about to meet his match. Twenty year old Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a brilliant, yet troubled youth. He possesses the ability to solve complex math- ematical theorems almost effort- lessly, but is alse somewhat of a punk. Will has never left his home- town of South Boston (\Southie\). He works as a jani- tor by day and at nights he can be found drinking and fooling around with his pals, and trying to impress Skylar (Minnie Driver), a British transfer student now studying at Harvard. Overall this is a very good movie. It is an independent film, written by Matt Williams and Affleck, which may never have seen the big screen. Miramax Films only decided to make the movie after Damon was cast by Francis Ford Copolla in The Rain Maker. Originally, this movie had only a limited release. Mike Winn's State of the Art: Serenading the Alma-Mater Around Campus ----------------------- by Michael Winn Staff Writer I've heard it time and time again, art from the heart can never disap- point. Of course, as a critic of all art, I was skeptical when asked to accept this. On the sixth week of spring tenn, I am put in the situa- tion of reviewing a piece of art that I was a part of, but a piece of art that my heart was a part of as well. At midnight on the night of Wednesday, April29, a group of mixed classes assembled to accom- plish something that no other has before. The group of post-wine and cheese seniors and preppy sophomores were clad with Union apparel, and were prepped by Ruthie Strosberg's brush-ups. Our Mission: to serenade every single on-campus residential building with Union's own Alma Mater. After a short run through, we all made are way to AEPi; the first stop. Of course, the quality of tone and pitch was not exactly perfect as many of us were unaccustomed to singing, but it was our first stop. We received a warm welcome by the brothers as they made their way to the doors and windows. After smoothing our voices, we ended well and were thanked by loud ap- plause. We wete joined by one of the brothers for the rest of the trip. After a stop at South College, where the fresh- men were not as en- thused by the song, we made our move to the President;s house. After one full run of the song, we noticed nothing. No greeting, no barking, nothing. I myself was ready to five up on our President, but Ruth.ie insisted we do it again. Low and behold, the President came out in his PJ's to welcome us. After we were done, he clapped and then told us that he \didn't think anyone knew the Alma Mater.\ From there we were off to greet Webster, Davidson, and Fox. After covering every side of each build- ing with good responses, we made our way to FIJI. There we were greeted with people coming outside to get a better listen. The response gave us more confidence, and we would need it as we headed towards the freshman-exclusive dorms of West and Rich- mond. If I told you that we only received good re- sponses from the fresh- men, I would be fibbing. Maybe they just weren't ready for our spirit. There were scattered jeers among the cheers. As we movedup to North College and Bronner House, our motivation was tested. We were dismayed by the young Frank Rossi's confinement to his room. People began to complain abouttheir ach- ing throats. We were truly falling apart at the seams. But we would not accept defeat. After a stop at the Nott, where a few of us took an undressed mosey around our 16-sided friend, we were ready to take on the rest of the campus. To make a long and meander- ing story short, the strength of our song was only catalyzed by our love of this school. Even thougll we were met by some adversity and flying bottles of water at Sig Chi (the joke was on them anyway because it hit and dented one oftheir cars). The group ofvaliant warriors included Michael Winn, Kim Rohback, Lori Greene, Ruthie Strosberg, Adrian MacLean, and Ed Dombrowski. Also Jim DeStefano, Michelle Jester, Sara Friedman, Andrea Schulman, Doug Schneider and Akin Sawyer, weuld like to thank the college that we love for their support. And if you ever hear the college's chant, come joins us. t t4 a a tl 0 tl a: v li c t< 0 sl Sl li

Compassion! directed by Doug de Lisle and playing at the Albany Civic The- atre. It is a laugh-filled drama. Love, valor and compassion are three words that define some of the essentials of being a decent human being, and the name of a Tony A ward winner for best play. It is a touching drama that is also filled with la.ughs, as it explores the lives of eight gay rnen who share their summer holiday weekends by a secluded lake. The intricate relationships of these men as they deal with life, death, AIDS, family and love make for a thoughtful drama for adult audiences. The play is now also a motion picture. Love! Valor!

I was so im- pressed by the way these young adults handled such a difficult piece of text, per- form it so perfectly while not just empllasiz- ing the spoken aspect of the play, b11t also the movement. They were running all over the stage, dancing, and freezing. This brings me to another note of praise. The director chose to create a series of play- ers who spoke in everyday English, a11d in- terrupted the scenes, to explain to the audi- ence what was going on. They used small hand held bells to freeze the actors and a wind up toy to rewind or fast forward the motions of the actors. A Midsummer Night's Swing was illcred- ihle. It was directorial brilliance combined with amazing talent on the part of tile ac- tors, and a phenomenal set. Perhaps the greatest aspect of the show was tlte fact that it was put on by students and teachers in a cooperative effort, with no coltcern about profits or fame, but for the simple sake of art, personal growth, and ]earning. ] ) t

Writer's block is a terrible thing. You sit in front of a piece of pa- per, or in my case this computer, and nothing comes to you. One goes through a whole range of . emotions from anger to frustration to absolute desperation. You are willing to write anythingjust to see words appear on the paper. Still nothing comes to you. In desperation friends seem like the greatest things in the world. Maybe if you are lucky they will write something and save you from the embarrassment of writing some- thing that will forever have you looked at as a fool or worse. Nine times out of ten your friends will not help you. This is a fact oflife. Friends will have your back in a fight. Friends will come pick you up if you're stranded. Friends might even give you a kidney if you need it. Friends will not under a circumstance help you out when you are writing any- thing. Term paper, newspaper article, romantic letter, people will not even give you a preposition if you offer to pay them for it. And so you stay stuck staring at a blank page. Then it hits you; you have some- thing to write. So without further ado you be- gin furiously banging on keys. Words begin to appear on the screen, and your mood picks up your writing. Then of course you stop to rest your fingers. In the Riding The Pine by Eugene D. Schultz Femtures Editer, etc ... meantime ho-wever you read what you wrote.

Jor1. Tapper•s Wee~ly C omme:n t:ary I am sitting here writing my ar- ticle and ljust learned an interest- ing tidbit ofinformation. It seems that the Unabomber, Theodore Kaczyinski, was sentenced today. For sending letter bombs to people involved with technological ad- vancement over an eighteen-year period, he received four life sen- tences and an additional thirty years just in case 'he is still alive at • the end ofthe four life sentences. This leads to a couple of inter- esting questions. Kaczyinski ac- cepted a plea bargain in which he avoids the death. penalty by con- fessing to all the bombings. So Kaczyinski is going to jail for a long, long time. But he isn't mad about that. Instead, he is upset because people are misrepresent.,. ing his political views and moti- vations for the killings. He hasmade itclearthathe isn't one of those environmental, let nature be kind of guys. Rather, he litters whereverhe wants. So I ask this question, what the hell is his point? He says he has a point, but he follows tllat statement up with another statement in which he claims that he llas no beliefs. I say he is crazy. Put him away for a long time (maybe four life- times and thirty years?) and throw away the key. One more interest- ing bit ofinformation to close this case (finally). Kaczynski will be spending the rest of his days in a maximum-security prison living in a tiny little celljust like all other murderers. laughing and having a good time. He shrugs off the murders too eas- ily for my liking. Let me give :you some of the highlights of the in- terview. The interviewer asled O.J. if his kids ever asked about the murders. He said that they never had. When asked if he should bring it up to them or when the observa- tion was made that other kids must talk to his kids, he denied it. He said that other kids loved him, they even wanted him to coach their basketball team. Now I ask you, would yotl want O.J. coaching your kids? 1 sure hope the answer is no. O.J. also maintains that the po\ lice framed him. Sure, the LAPD really got together to frame O.J. for murder. That's believable. Also, I promised you an update last term, well here it is, O.J. is still actively searching for the \real killers.\ He thinks it was Nicole's friend, Faye Resnick, he just needs to frame her, I mean collect evi- dence. He kills two people (I don't care what the verdict was, they have all the evidence except a videotape of him doing it) and then wonders why no one treats him with respect or why no one will give hirn a cushy job. Is this man out of his mind? Does he think that people have that snort of memories'? What y~u read here is a recre- ation ofwlut a typical example of Why's this interesting'?

,, I Features State ·of the Union by Amanlla Huginkiss Contribtfting Writer After transferring here my win- ter term from a state university, I'd have to say that this school has to be the most fake and superficial campus in the country. When I went to my state school, there were kids strugglingj ust to pay for their own education through multiple jobs and financial aid. Here, par- ents have enoug;h money not only to pay $30,000a year, but enough left over to buy their children Jeep Grand Cherokees. And plus, kid.s care more about partying and getting drunk multiple times a week thlln actually makittg anything of them- selves acadern]- cally. But the.\n again, why should they? They've al- ready gotten ev- erything given to them alread)', why can't the-y counton their par- ents to give them a job and career'\? And then I re!ld the paper, and it's so subpar. It's just representati'le ofthe apathy on campus. We hav-e this really shotty features section where people just write whatever they please, like this kid Eugene Shllltz writing a \top 50.\ If this school was serious at all, people woul.d write serious ar- ticles instead of things like, \you know, I was just wondering how many gallons of water a camel holds in its hump.\ But then again, I regress. I think about how my ~arents pay full tu- ition here and the cherry red Jeep they bought me over the summer, and maybe,justmaybe, I may seem a little hypocritical. And so what if my parents gave me everything I ever asked for? fl\nd so fine, maybe I didn't really go to a state school, I transferred from another $30,000 a year school. But who cares? I mean, big deal. Here's atop ten list about the things that have been lliost disconcerting to me since I have come here this winter: l 0) Two Words: Camel rides <)) The lack of a quality bar scene &) The Concordiensis 7) Former EdHor-in-Chief 'Frank Rossi 5) The Deans (especially Dean Alford) 5) Sorority Girls 4) Having to deal with res-life 3) The disgraceful sports scene 2}0ur school'sinferiority com- plex 1) WRUC director Pete Simon expressing my displeasure, I would J:ike to disclose the fact that I am not happy with the camel rides, it's just that at $3 a head, it's no wonder that Ie stayed from . I mean, so what if R-oger Hall or whatever the president's name is rode on it. Does this mean that I'm going to? ~C<Jme on, you don't have to be Einstein to know that people aren't all fish. So, I leave you with this pic- iU:re. I hope that it is as enjoyable as: the rest of the features section. Especially, Heath Fradkoffwrites a quality feature. But, the rest is ~ll crap, which is why I'm writ- illg for it. I hope that people will hold it in higher regard now. Any- w:ay, I hope you enjoyed' reading tltis article. I'm not sure if I' II write any others, though so I hope tltat you enjoyed it. Thank you. Quote of the Week: \Some- times you just have to step back ~nd look at the big picture, kind ()f Like my garage.\ -Usual Sus- pects For the first time in a really long time, I decided to throw aside the pressing schoo'lwork weiglting on my shoulders for one night and actually go with my friends to a movie at the campus center. With all the labs and papers and read- ing assignments that have been piling up, I tho11ght that I was act- ing pretty irresponsibly by wast- ing two hours .of my time in that auditorium just so I could watch Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt's love story in A.; GoodAs It Gets. Well, I can teU you that 1 did set myselfback a few hours of work, but :it was worth it. Outside of the fact that I am the typical female lusting after her daily fix of unre- alistic, moving, romantic cheese, r was glad I let myself actually procrastinate f()r a little while. I had always beell someone who put things off to the last minute,. con- sistently finding myself with a mild ulcer over the I 0-page paper due the next day that I had yet to start . This year I decided to change that destructive little quirk and I have been pretty good about it ever since. Procrastirlation has not been a factor in my everyday life and I have been glad to see it go. However, dispelling that teeny character flaw from my personal- ity has left me anal and completely compulsive. This is not exactly my favorite thing t() admit. I have be- come the queen cfmaximizing my time ... writing ~ut little schedules for myself everyday to plan where I should be at every minute. ~ow on earth did this happen to me? I am not really sure when I for- got how to relax and just let my- self vegetate. I can't even enjoy my sporadic \soap opera breaks\ because I know I could be doing something else during that time and that thought leaves me constantly on edge. Sllll/l/11111 by Heatll Fradkoff Donna DeMllria fights a war. The city of Albamy has committed an atrocity against the underprivi- leged populatior1. Due to lack of funding, the 148 Quail Street homeless shelter is being shut down. This situa.tion is not uncom- mon to America's cities because there never seems to be enough money to do all the good that needs to be done. H~wever, Albany's situation is unique. At the same time the deci~ion to close the shel- ter was made public, a plan to im- prove the quality of Albany's bus shelters had already been imple- mented. Yes, thllt's right, bus shel- ters. Just to clarify, a bus shelter is an open structure placed at a bus stop to keep the rain off of those waiting for transportation. Over the weekend of May 1, Donna led a weekend-long sit-in demonstration to make the public aware of this injustice. Protesting next to the modernized bus shelter on Central A venue, supporters of the cause put up signs and spoke over loudspeakers until early Mon- day morning. Tile goal, in addition to increasing pu!Jlic awareness, was 1() collect enough money to keep the shelter open through the up- (Oming months. Donna and her .sllpporters are counting on the <:ommunity to fix the mistakes of ih e city's administration. The Capital District Transpor- ia.ti on Authority has allotted $3()0,000 to build three high-tech .sh.elters equipped with electronic .schedule boards. That's $300,000 .spent to beautify structures that leep drizzle off of pedestrians' :heads at the same time the city is li eking its poor out into the cold ra.i11. How could Albany's priorities be so out of whack? How could the look of a bus shelter ever take precedence over the health of the homeless?

, ) ! '.• Features State of the Union by Arnaud~ Hugi11kiss Contributing Witter After transferring here my win- terterm from a stateuniversity, I'd have to say that this school has to be the most fake and superficial campus in the country_ When I went to my state school, .there were kids struggling just to pay for their oyvn education threugh: multiple jobs and financial aid. Here, par-- ents have enough money not only to pay $30,()00 a year, but enough left over to buy their children Jeep Grand Cherokees. And plus, kids care more about partying and getting drunkmultiple times a week than actually making anything ofthem- selves academi- cally. But then again, why should they? They've al- ready gotten ev- erything given to them already, why can't theY: count on their par- ents to give them a job ~md career? · And then 1 read the paper,. and it' s so su.bpar. It's just representative of the apathy on campus. We have this re!lllly shotty features section where peoplejust write whatever they please, like this kid Eugene Shultz writing a \top 50..\ [f this school was serious at all, people would write serious ar- ticles instead ofthings like, \you know, I was just wondering how many gallons of water a ~;:amel holds in its hump.\ · But then again, I regress. I think about how my parents pay full tu- ition here and the cheny red Jeep they bought me over tile summer, and maybe, just maybe, Imay seem a little hypocritical. Andso what if my parents gave me everything I ever asked for? And: so fine, maybe I didn't really go :to a state school, I transferred from anothel' $30,()00 a year school. But wilo· cares?

Quote of the W;eek.: \Some- times you just have to step back and look at the big P'icture, kind of like my garage.\\ -Usual Sus- pects For the first time in a really long time, I decided to throw aside the pressing schoolwerk weighing on my shoulders for one night and actually go with my friends to a movie at the campus center. With all the labs and papers and read- ing assignments that have been piling up, l thought that I was act- ing pretty irresponsibly by wast- ing two hours of my time in that auditorium just so I could watch Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt's love story in As Good As lt Gets. Well, l can tell you that I did set myself back a few hours of work, but it was worth it. Outside of the fact that 1 am the typical female lusting after her daily fix of unre- alistic, moving, romantic cheese, I was glad I let myself actually procrastinate for a little while. I had always been someone who put things off to the last minute, con- sistently finding myself with. a mild ulcer over the I 0-page paper due the next day that I had yet to start. This year I decided to change that destructive little quirk and I have been pretty good about it ever since. Procrastination has not been a factor in my everyday life and I have been glad to see it go. However, dispelling that teeny character flaw from my personal- ity has left me anal and completely compulsive. This is not exactly my favorite thing to admit. I have be- come the queen of maximizing my time ... writing out little schedules · · for myself everyday to plan where I should be at every minute. How on earth did this happen to me? I am not really sure when I for- got how to relax and just let my- self vegetate. I can't even enjoy my sporadic \soap opera breaks\ because I know I could be doing something else during that time and that thought leaves me constantly on edge. SRBBIIIJI/ by Heatll Fradkoff Donna DeMaria fights a war. The city of Albany bas committed an atrocity agains.t the u!lderprivi- leged population. Due tc lack of funding, the 148 Quail Street homeless shelter is being shut down. This situation is n(Jt uncom- mon to America~s citie1; because there never seems to be enough money to do all the good that needs to be done. Howe\er Albany's situation is unique. At the same time the deci~ion to clos~ the shel- ter was made public, a plan to im- prove the quality of Albany's bus shelters had already been imple- mented. Yes, thaCs right, bus shel- ters. Just to clarify, a bus shelter is an open structure placeil at a bus stop to keep the rain off of those waiting for transportation. Over the weekend of May 1, Donna led a weekend-lbng sit-in demonstration to make tbe public aware of this injustice. Protesting next to the modernized b11s shelter on Central A venue, supporters of the caus~ put up slgns and spoke over loudspeakers until early Mon* day morning. The g<JEII, in addition to increasing public awaremess,.was to collect enough mo11ey to keep the shelter open thr~!Uglt the up- coming months. Do11na and her supporters are cou11tl:ing on the community to fix the mistakes of the city's administrat:i()n. The Capital Distric:t Transpor- tation Authority llas allotted $300,000 to build three high-tech shelters equipped wiill electronic schedul~ boards. ThClf's $300,000 spent to beautify structures that keep drizzle off ofpedestrians' beads at the same tilll e the city is kicking its poor out into the cold rain. How could Alba11y 's priorities be so out of whack\/ I-low could the look of a bus shelter ever take precedence overthe!Ieaith of the homeless? Donna ~aid that the CDT A defends its CJctions by de- claring that the people <>f Albany should have sometillng (i.e. their scenery) that they c:arn1ake pride in. But at the cost ofltuman lives, their statement doesll' tholdmuch water. ., The construction {)f these bus shelters can be likened to the placement of a window box on a condemned building~ sure, the flowers may look nice, but does it really make people overlook the fact that the ceiling is caving in?

-.:: .. Crew Softball S~ftball Finishes Season with a 18-15 Recofd by DavidBrooks Sports Writer The Swinging Dutchwornen closed out their season last week with an 18-15 record. The extremely young team saw their post season dreams slip away the previous week after a dismal 1-5 record. However, last M()nday the team was ready to forget about their pre- vious performance and try to get back on track. Union traveled to Oneonta and had a tough time get- ting out oftheir slump. Apryle Pickering pitched the first game, but she was not able to control the bats of Oneonta and Union dropped the first game 11-7. In the second, Meg Cr()wley pitched an impressive game but was not able to get the support from the offense and Union lost 2-1 in a pitchers duel. Saturday for a makeup game that was postponed due.to rain on April 1. Pickering pitcl!ed a superb game but was unable to get .any run sup- pert and the Dutcl1women lost 2-0. In the second game, Union's of- fense again could not contribute .. Albany scored five runs off Crowley and tbe Dutchwomen son. The team ended with ten more wins then they had last season, wltich is even more impressive be- cause they start five freshmen. Pickering ended the season with a 12-7 record and a dominating 1.59 ERA. Crowley had a 6-7 seven record with an equally impressive 2.35 ERA. Tara McManus led the A:~ron raunstein I · On Wednesday, the team tra\- eled to Russell Sage and was ready to prove they were better then their 16-13 record. Pickering was a:b le to shut out Russell Sage and cruise to a 3-0 win. Cr<Jwley headed to the mound in the second game and Softba/1/oob Jorward to improving on this years 18-15 record pitched well as the Dutch women ended their season with a 5-0 loss team in hitting with a .323 average came away with a 4-2 win impro'J- and an 18-15 record. Although the and Julie Cardettino was second ing their record to 18-13. team did not ma~e the post sea- with a .315 average. Union traveled to Albany on son, is was still a successful sea- Assistant coach Brian Speck said \Overall we llad a successful season. Although we missed the playoffs, we are quite pleased with our progress. We stilrted five fresh- men and only graduate one senior and thus the team has a very bright future. Wehavete focus on beat- ing the powerh()use teams like Skidmore, AI bany, RPl, and Oneonta\ With Pickering and Crowley being freshmen, Union can expect the pitching to only get stronger. They have lacked pitch- ing in the past few years, and are happy two have NO pitchers like Pickering and Crowley. Along with age come fewer errors, some- thing that has plagued the team this whole season. Union will have to work on their hitting in the offsea- son, and more importantly not leav- ing as many runners on bases. The Dutchwomen were able to get on base, but were unable to drive in the runs. All of these fac1ors will change with age. As the team becomes more comfortable playing at the collegiate level, the stronger the team will become. Next year, the team hopes to impF()veon their 18- 15 record and make their dream of going to the playoffs a reality. Crew Performs Well at States by Nicholas E. Papanickola:s Sports Writer On Saturday and Sunday May 2nd & 3rd, Union Crew traveled to Delta Lake in Rome, NY to com- pete in the New York State Cham- pionships. States, as it is better known, brings all the Division [.!{ Ill crews in New York State to com- pete for the state title. This is also where boats qualify for Champi- ons, which is the Division II/I II Na- tional Championship, the following week. The weather, although over- cast with occasional rain, was per- fect for rowing as the wind was. minimal and tile water was almost glass. The tension was high~ as many crews would be fighting for their respectabi.Iit:y and theirplace- ment in the Finals on Sunday. The first race of the day for Union was the women's varsity eight. Often undersized against the competition the women's eight has been able tomakethe most oftheir situations throughout the year. Saturday they needed to do it again as they faced tough compe- tition, in the qualifying heat, against Colgate, Ithaca, and Army. With an aggressive row the women were able to pull out a third place finish over Army to advance them into the finals with Colgate, Ithaca, William & Smith, Skidmore, and Marist On Sunday, the women squared off in the finals not only for a state championship but also for an invitation t() nationals. Un- able to keep pace with William & Smith and Skidmore during the season Union -was a huge under- dog prior to tile race. Coxswain Ted Wallace commented, \It was the most solid and fastest racing of the season f()rthe women. They put everything on the line in this race perfonning allove and beyond the general expectation.\ The women's crew although finish.ing fifth, finished only 4 seconds be- hind Skidmore, which had beaten them by over I :5 seconds two weeks prior. It was probably the greatest improvement over a two- week period than any other crew had made and with the loss of only two seniors the .ex]Jectations for next year remain high. However, the season is not over for the women's eight which qualified for Champions. Coach Daley com- mented on the race: \'Mentally and physically the women committed themsel\es to overcoming bigger and faster crews and the result is a well deserved bid to Nationals.\ The men's varsitY eight followed on Saturday with their qualifying heat Seeded as fiftlt in the state the men had high expectations of doing well in the finals. However, they were upset in the qualifying heat by two tougil RIT and Marist crews (who finished second third, respectful1y, in thefmals) and by a surprise Army crew, which just edged out Union. The varsity eight regrouped from their disap- pointing and proballly worst row of the season, to finish a respect- ful second in the petite final be- hind Colgate which edged out Union by less than a boat length. As a boat, the men felt as though they had a decent season and al- though they did not feel as though they had reached their potential when it counted they took a lot from the experience. This experi- ence will be beneficial next year as the men are also only losing two seniors and have high expecta- tions for the young crew next year. For the men's and women'sjun- ior varsity crews the lack of other junior varsity crews in the state reduced their races to straight fi- nals with out qualifying heats. On the men's side the crew was confi- dent, as they had been keeping pace with the varsity eight for most of the season. The race started well for all crews, the first .500 meters was shaky for Union but they were able to keep pace with Rochester, Colgate and Anny down the race-· course as Hobart quickly fell out of contention. One rower stated that, \it was a solid race and it just came down to the slugf~st at the sprint.\ Overall, the race went well and although it was a disappoint- ing ·finish of fo11rth it was tight throughout. The men were con- tent with their perfonnance and are looking toward the fall season. On the women's side the crew was an underdog from the begin- ning against much bigger crews. One rower stated that, \it was a solid race and the crew did what it was supposed to .do but the other crews were just too much to handle.\ The junior varsity women finished in .fiftlt behind the tough crews oflthaca, William & Smith, Colgate, and Skidauore. On Sunday all eyes turned to Union's last race of the day, the novice women's eights. The nov- ice had captured a victory in their qualifYing heat placing first just ahead of a goodMarist crew. The final was a grudge match from the beginning, as it q:uickly became a three~way race between Marist, Ithaca, and Uni()n. As the race came down to the last 300 meters Marist pressed hard pulling away from Ithaca to take the state title and Union madetlleir strong surge as so often done throughout the season coming up just short to place third overall in the novice women's eight competition. Rower Chris Vines said, \With support from the entire team we were able to come out on top in Saturday's heat and our 3'd place finish on Sunday was a great end to our nov- ice year.\ As the season ends Union Crew in its first varsity year opened a lot of eyes around the rowing commu- nity with it best o-verall finish as a team this year as States. Coach Daley stated, \l'm proud Union could come in force in every event.\ With a \ery young group, composed of mostly sophomores, Union Crew has much to look for- ward to in the near future. With continued training, experience, and improvement UnionCrew will in- still fear in all cre~s that it faces. tr S' aJ N F OJ sr a1 S( re a~ 01 te u g( g< 01 at tn th m si 111 hi w m pc pt SC J.

Only eight teams receive an invitation to this tournament. The Dutchwomen first played #4 Skidmore, who was their only UCAA loss. Going into their game, the Dutchwomen were fired-up, and ready to avenge their regu Jar season loss. The Dutchwomen not only did this, but walked all over Skidmore to win 14- 9. Abby Harris scored two of the first four goals, to give her team 4- 0 lead in the first six minutes. The Dutchwomen then entered the sec- ond half with a commanding 9-3 lead. Skidmore did their best to come back by cutting the lead to I 0-5, but never came closer than four. Senior Liz Kittleman and jun- ior Shoko Okado led the onslaught with four goals apiece. Defensive standout Sarah Moss, added three goals to the victory, and of course the Dutch women had help from the superb play oftheir junior goalie. Maura Woessner managed 12 saves. This game was Unions first trip to the post season since 1995, and was their seventh invitation since 1983. The Dutchwomen' s next match- up was against first ranked Will- iam Smith, also ranked third in the nation. The team went into the the game 21-10, and finished their fast paced season. The girls com- mented on the game, and in gen- eral they felt very slow paced, and drained during the game. The play- ers were disappointed, but were quite satisfied with their entire sea- SOil. Lauren Pastor tied the Union College career goal scoring record of 147 with two goals against Ithaca. Pastor equaled the record ofHolly Howard set from 1930 to 1 <J83. Last year Pastor equaled Howard's single-season scoring record of 47 goals. Adding three goals was Moss while Ryall dropped two in the net. Woessner had eight saves. In this game, the Dutchwomen's luster ran out, but by non1eans took away from their amazing season. The Dutchwomen now have the chance to take a rest, that was needed all season long. The Dutchwomen will miss se- niors Liz Kittleman, Lauren Pastor, DebL()ffredo, and Rebecca Wright. The home fans made that quite apparent by painting \Thank You Seniors,\ on the lawn by Frank Bailey Memorial Field.

Page 22 • May 7, 1998 • Olomnrmeu£~is Sports • • Professionals treto tre by Christopher G. Leone Editor-in-Chief The first Saturday in May is probably the best single day ofthe year. This declaration is not because spring is here, or that Fratstock is visiting Union College. lt is because the last great professional sport receives the significant attention it so richly deserves. In this sport there are no holdouts over money and contract negotiations. The atha letes demand neither trade clauses, nor do they refuse to play in inclement weather. There are no fights on the field ofplay, and the last time I checked, trash talking was not even an option. The performers are judged by their past performances, and are paid by how they fin- ish. ImagiFie a 10 million dollar baseball player no receiving his check if his team did not make the playoffs. However, in this great sport even the all-time great performers will barely top 10 million in career earnings. This sports is also great because little children do not get hmt by their idols refus- ing to sign autographs. In this wonderful sport of kings there has never been an auto- graph signed by these world class athletes. If there had been one, it would have defi- nitely drawn a national inquiry. Medical drugs are allowed in this sport but only if needed. There are no lawyers in corporate offices trying to cover over drug use by their athletes. Yes, there is drug test- ing for performance testing, but the chances For years the San Diego Padres were known as Tony Gwynn and some other guys. They constantly resided in the basement of the National League West and teams were embarrassed to lose to the lowly Padres. Gwynn stuck it out and now he can get the last laugh. This season, the Padres, at 20-9 have the best record in the national league, and are off to their best start ever. After the Padres made the playoffs in '96, they came into last season with high expectations, but struggled and finished with a disappointing 76-86 record. In the off- season management shocked fans when it decided to shell out some cash for pitching ace Kevin Brown. The Padres management seemed dedicated to win for the first time in a long time and they are slowly adding the necessary players to achieve their goal. However, nobody could have predicted such a fast start by the Padres. Along with Gwynn, San Diego is anchored by 38 Ken Caminiti, lB Wally Joyner, and2B Quilvio Veras. Aside from Caminiti, who has battled injuries all year and is in the midst of a 0-15 slump, all are hitting above .300, playing ofa failed test is the opposite ofthe NBA, which is scared to test to find out how many of its .players are drug addicts. Drugs and morals are not the only posi- tives about this sport; gender discrimina- tion hasnever been a problem for this sport. Males and females are treated accordingly as they have been for over a century. No one corn plains, no one pickets, there are no boycotts when this sport is being played. It might be me, but it sounds like a utopian world :long ago destroyed by mankind. Breeding is not an insult in this sport. Unlike the past comments ofJimmytl1e Greek, one will not get fired for saying that one of these athletes is bred to be a champion. In fact many of the athletes are different colors and never fight about the difference. It is just business as usual. In case you have not guessed, the last tremendous defense, and hitting in the clutch. With Caminiti at full strength, there is no telling how much damage the Padres can do. It's time for the rest of the league to stop laughing. Teams Respond to Injuries As is the trend every April, teams with high e\pectations lose key players due to injuries and find themselves struggling to stay afloat. A quick look at some key injuries thus far and how teams have responded: Angels: Tim Salmon Although the Angels have lost the top home run hitter in their line-up, they have gotten superb pitching from the likes of Chuck Finley and have won seven of nine since his injury. Mariners: Jay Buhner The Mariners rely on tremendous run support to outlast their shaky pitching. With the loss of Buhner, they lose their second most productive hitter. The Mariners have struggled all season without his bat and .find themselves a game out of last place in the AL West. Met.s.· Edgardo Alfonso, Todd Hundley, Bernard Gilkey The Mets came into the season with little great professional sport is horse racing and last weekend's event was the Kentucky Derby. While it might be too rnuch to expect from mankind, we all could learn a great deal from watching these beautiful animals at work. * * * * * If the Kentucky Derby was not this past weekend, I wol!lld have had to write once again about the New York KRicks and the Miami Heat. As game four ended and the fight broke out, I really beli~ved that I was watching the greatest setup in the history of pro-sports. First off, what team runs a pick and roll, which is what Larry Johnson was doing to Alonzo Mourning, with the lead and only four s~conds remaining? With all the bad hitting and a great pitching staff. They knew they were going to be without Hundley for a while, but they didn't expect Alfonso and Gilkey to joiri him on the DL. Although they have still gotten superb pitching, they have lacked hitting and suffered through a six game losing streak which ended over the weekend. They can't last much longer with such key players on theDL. Braves: Mark Whalers, John Smaltz The Braves have the talent to overcome almost anything. Smaltz's injury did little to hurt the team and the Braves reside at the top of the NL East. Now they most overcome Wholers injury, but few doubt they'll have any trouble. Yankees: Mariano Rivera The Yankees lost Rivera early in the season, moved Stanton to the closer role, and promptly won 11 of 12. Now Rivera is back and the Yankees keep on rolling. Padres: Ken Caminiti Although Caminiti has played, he has b~en anything but full strength. Now he is expected to join the DL.

Page 22 • May 7, 1998 • <!Iont.nrhlensis Sports • • Professionals treto tre by Christopoher G. Leone Ed;tol'- in-Chief The first Saturday in May is probably tfue best single day of the year. This declaration is not because spring is here, or that Fratstock is visitin~; Union College. It is because the last great professional sport receives the significant attention it so richly deserves. In this sport theve are no holdouts over money aud contract negotiations. The ath- letes demand neitheor trade clauses, nor do they refuse to play in inclement weather. There are no fights on the field of play, and the last time I checked, trash talking was not even an option. The performers are judged by their past performances, and ar-e paid by how they fin- ish. Imagine a 10m ill ion dollar baseball player no receiving his check if his team did not make the playoffs. However, in this great sport even the all-time great performers will barely top 10 millioll in career earnings. This sports is also great because little children do not get hurt by their idols refus- ing to sign autographs. In this wonderful sport of kings there has never been an auto- graph signed by these world class athletes. If there had been one, it would have defi- nitely drawn a national inquiry. Medical drugs are allowed in this sport but only if needed. 'Ifhere are no lawyers in corporate offices trying to cover over drug use by their athletes. Yes. there is drug test- ing for performanceltesting, but the chances For years the Sa11 Diego Padres were known as Tony Gwynn and some other guys. They cons! antly resided in the basement of the Nati anal League West and teams \\ereembarras.sed to lose to the lowly Padres. Gwynn stlick it out and no\v lw can get the last laugh. 1lhis season, the Padres. a.t 20-l) have the best record in the nat ion a! league, and are off to their best start ever. After the Padres made the playoffs in '96, they came into last season with high expectations, but struggled and finished with a disappointing 76-86 record. In the off- season management shocked fans when it decided to shell out some cash for pitching ace Kevin Brown. The Padres management seemed dedicated to win for \the first time in a long time and they are slowly adding the necessary players I~ achieve their goal. However, nobody could have predicted such a fast start by the Padres. Along with Gwynn, San Diego is anchored by 38 Ken Caminiti, I B Wally Joyner, and 2B Quilvio Veras. Aside from Cami.:niti, who has battled injuries all year and is in the midst of a 0-15 slump, all are hitting above .300, playing of a failed test is the opposite of the NBA, which is scared to test to find out how many of its players are drug addicts. Drugs and morals are not the only posi- tives about this sport; gender discrimina- tion has never been a problem for this sport. Males and females are treated accordingly as they have been for over a century. No one complains, no one pickets, there are no boycotts when this sport is being played. It might be me, but it sounds like a utopian world long ago destroyed by mankind. Breeding is not an insult in this sport. Unlike the past comments of Jimmy the Greek, one will not get fired for saying that one of these athletes is bred to be a champion. In fact many of the athletes are different colors and never fight about the difference. It is just business as usual. In case you have not guessed, the last tremendous defense. and hitting in the clutch. With Caminiti at full strength, there is no telling how much damage the Padres can do. It's time for the rest of the league to stop laugh in g. Teams Respond to Injuries As is the trend every April, teams with high expectations lose key players due to injuries and find themselves struggling to stay afloat. A quick look at some key injuries thus far and how teams have responded: Angels: Tim Salmon Although the Angels have lost the top home run hitter in their line-up, they have gotten superb pitching from the likes of Chuck Finley and have won seven of nine since his injury. Mariners: .Jay Buhner The Mariners rely on tremendous run support to outlast their shaky pitching. With the loss of Buhner, they lose their second most productive hitter. The Mariners have struggled all season without his bat and find themselves a game out of last place in the AL West. Mets: Edgardo Alfonso, Todd Hundley, Bernard Gilkey The Mets came into the season with little great professional sport is horse racing and last weekend's event was the Kentucky Derby. Wllileitmightbetoomuchto expect from mankin<l, we all could learn a great deal from watching these beautiful animals at work. * * * * * If the Kentu<:ky Derby was not this past weekend, I \.Nould have had to write once again about the New York Knicks and the Miami Heat. As game four ended and the fight broke out, I really l>el ieved that I was watching the greatest setup in the history of pro-sports. First off, what team runs a pick and roll, which is what Larry Johnson was doing to Alonzo Mourning, with the lead and only four seconds remaining? With all the bad hitting and a great pitching staff. They knew they were going to be without Hundley for a while, but tl1ey didn't expect Alfonso and Gilkey to joi11 him on the D L. Although tiH:y have still gotten superb pitching, they have lacked hitting and suffered thr()ugh a six game losing streak which ended over the weekend. They can't last much longer with such key players on the DL. Braves: Afark Whalers. John Smolt::: The Braves have the talent to overcome almost anything. Smaltz's injury did little to hurt the team and the Braves reside at the top of the NL East. Now they most overcome Wholers injury, but few doubt they'll have any trouble. Yankees: Mariano Rivera The Yankees lost Rivera early in the season, mc)\led Stanton to the closer role, and promptly won I I of 12. Now Rivera is back and the 'Yankees keep on rolling. Padres: Ken Caminiti Although Caminiti has played, he has been anything but full strength. Now he is expected to join the DL. The Padres should have enough to <Jvercome his injury, but they could use hirn back as soo11 as possible. Orioles: Bmdy Anderson, Mike Muss ina blood between the two, Jeff VanGundy could not 11ave ex.pectea anything except a figllt and the subsequent suspensions. However, when Patrick Ewing did not play in game five, I re.al ized that this was not a great strategy by New York to free up the middle for Ewings' return, but was rather two grown men acting like morons .... oh ex- cuse me that is w11at the NBA is all about. * * *' * * The greatestcom.ment oflast week came from the New York Knicks camp after the fight. In a statement regarding the one game suspension of Cluis Mills for leaving the bench during a fight, one K.n ick representa- tive said that Mills sh<Juld not have been Sl:lspended because he was going out to center court to pray.

The Frank Bailey Prize for the senior whose service- has most contributed to the college was given to Frank Federici. In the spring of 1995, when pledging the Delta Upsilon fraternity asa fresh- man, Federici was subjected to ·severe hazing.

Wierzbieniec gained 365 votes gaining over 54% approval from the voters, Staro came in second a11d Edelman finished third, sev- ellty votes behind Staro. Wierzbieniec is currently a Junior Class Representative and active within many organizations on cam- plls. Staro has never held office within student government, al- though he has hyld positio~s on · the lFC. Edelman, has also never held a position within student gov- ernment although he was heavily in\Volved with many Greek organi- zations on campus, including IFC. Wierzbieniec is only the third woman to be elected Student Fo- rum P1·csident since women were allowed to attend Union in 1970, alld, of course, was very excited at her election. For the upcoming year, she wants to make sure \the Forum runs well.\ She is highly motivated to improve communica- tiOil between the Forum and the student body. She, along with the rest of the newly elected officers, will be going around to all of the residence halls, introducing them- selves and explaining their posi- tions to residents to help improve communication. She is also the first independent elected to the presi- dency since the 1994-1995 year saw Nate Coffin as president, however, site feels it is her \job not to repre- sent Greeks or independents, but the student body as a whole.\ The Student Forum President is in charge of running the Student Fo- mm meetings and, according to the SGA constitution, \to serve as an active liaison between the Student Forum and the administration of the College.\ Freshman Theta Delta Chi pledge Michael Parisi (286 votes) defeated Dan Pesikoff (AEPi Junior, 273 votes) to become next year's V.P. of Finance. Parisi had never held any offices at this college before, altltough he is involved in organi- zatitms such as Big Brothers/Big Sisters and Chet's committee. Pes ikoffhad never been a member ofthe SGA, although he been the treasurer of numerous organiza- tions on campus and currently sits on the Finance Corum iitee. Junior AEPi Brot.ller Jeremy Lynch defeated Joe Lon.g to be- come the V.P. of Administration for the SGA Lynch's 3:59 defeated Long's 195. Lynch is cwrrently the Junior Class Treasurer W~ltile Long sits on the Finance Ca.>mmittee. Lynch was pleased with tl1e results and The V.P. of Adminiistration is the first in line to the pre:si dency in the case of the resig11ation or re- moval from office of the president. Incumbent sopho11110re Brian Roache was re-elected to V.P. of Campus Life. It was arJ easy vic- tory for him as he ran u:nopposed. \'I'm disappointed tha.t !:lD one ran against me, but I'm looki!lg fonvard to next year. Things 1will be run smoother and they will he bigger and better,\ commented! Roache. Junior Alpha Epsi lOon Pi Josh Mondlick defeated Jon Lemle(FIJI Pledge Freshman), Amanda Diamondstein (independent fresh- man), Alen Gershkovich (TDChi pledge freshman)> and Jay Rosenstock (AEP i Junior). Mondlick won with I 9.:5 votes to Gershkovich's 167 votes. Lemle closely trailed with I 56 votes. Diamondstein and Rosemstock fin- ished fourth and fifth, respectively. Rosenstock's campaign was unique in that Rosenstock is cur- rently in the term in Washington, D.C, an unavoidable handicap. Mondlick has never :held a posi- tion in the SGA while Gershkovich is a freshman representative to the Student Forum. Morudllck was \nervous because all1he candi- dates were very qua)jfied.\ Mondlick has not met with the AAC yet, so he was rrdil.lctant to talk about his plans, but stated that he does \have some plarus in mind.\ Sophomore independent Rob Bennett defeated Mark. McKee (TDChi Pledge Fresllman) to be- come V .P. of Multicultural Affairs of the SGA. Bennett's. 327 votes defeated McKee's 245. According to the SGA Constitutiorn, the posi- tion entails coordinatillg and rep- resenting all multicultural groups and/or individuals who feel they have a multicultural interest or con- cern, in addition to having a seat on the Multicultural Affairs Group. Finally, in the most heavily con- tested race, Sophomore FIJI Andy Markowski defeated five oppo- nents to become Board of Trustee representative for the class of2000 with 230 votes. Liz Kaier ( indepen- dent sophomore) finished sec0nd with 197 votes. Molly Shaner (Gamma Phi Beta sophomore) fin- ished third while Christine Weafer (Gamma Phi Beta sophomore) and Robyn Polansky(Sigma Delta Tau sophomore) finished fourth <md fifth with moderate vote totals very close to each other. Eugene Schultz (Phi Delta Theta sopho- more) finished sixth with 92 votes, 24 votes behind the fifth place fin- isher. Markowski, exuberant about his election reported that he will \continue his role on the Forum.\ As for his role on the Board of Trustees, Markowski expressed interest in \working with Profes- sor Paludi [of the Psychology De- partment] improving the counsel- ing services on campus.\ This year's elections were marred with controversy from the start. Usually, Concordiensis prints all campaign statements. Previously, Concordiensis had not been strict about the given deadlines. Last year, former Editor-in-Chief Frank Rossi was a candidate for presi- dent and did not want to cause controversy by disallowing late campaign statements. This year, the Editors-In-Chief would not ac- cept late statements. However, there was conflict as to the actual deadline. The petition signed by each candidate stated the deadline was I PM Sunday, May Jrrl while the Elections Board bylaws said 4 PM. Concordiensis accepted the late campaign statement ofMichael Parisi because of a family emer- gency. Many were not able to have their campaign statements printed and the Student Forum met on Monday May 4 1 h to discuss the situation. Many solutions were offered to fix the problem, includ- ing some as hostile as forcing Concordiensis to print the state- ments against its will, as the Fo- ulty, and students so that all levels of the col lege community were trep- resented.\ The application of the dialogues and the future of how they can be applied were discussed at the cer- emony. President Hull is consider- ing the idea of implementing the dialogues into freshmen orienta- tion and Preceptorial classes for next year. Hullalso discussed bring- ing in various speakers to present their personal ideas about diver- sity. He is also looking into hiring more minority professors to the Union faculty, as this was a main issue discussed at many of the dia- logues. Many students feel we can rum controls a significant portion of Cuncurdiensis 'funding. It was decided that certain members ofthe Forum would contact the Editors- In-Chief to see if a solution would be possible. Due to the urgency of the situation and layout c0n- straints of the newspaper, no con- cessions were made. Another issue which arose was that candidate Joe Long's state- ment was poorly edited by Concordiensis. His statement was forced to be edited because ofthe time it was turned in. Many errors appeared in his statement, includ- ing a glaring error stating that he was running for Vice President of Finance, while he was in fact run- ning fi·om Vice President of Admin- istration. Long went before the Forum this past Monday night, vo- / calizing his discontent with Concordiensis. However, Long did not blame his loss on this is- sue. The closeness of the V .P. of Finance's race piqued curiosity be- cause of Parisi's inexperience and Pesikoff s vast experience concern- ing financially. Parisi is also a mem- ber ofTD Chi, a fraternity that tra- ditionally holds many offices on the Forum. The current Vice Presi- dent of Finance and the current Presidents of the Forum are Theta Delta Chis. Additionally, the elec- tion was controversial because the voting machines were moved twice during the day, and no one is sure of the effect of transporting the voting machines during use. N<> of- not :real'ly begin to address student issues unless the facu Tty is di- versely represeFited also. Tile idea for Dialogues on Race was originally that of MAG and .Peer Facilitators. Members from these two groups, along with Pro- fessor Patrik, attended a diversity workshop at Swarthmore College which gave them the idea to bring simi'lar issues to Union. The Intel- leetua'l Life Committee and Dean Alf<Jrd provided funds for the dia- logues. Professor Patrik continued the dialogues with professor-spon- sored dialogues for the two weeks following the st11deNt discussions. U lilfortunately, these dialogues were not as successful. Professor Patrikattributed the low attendance to exhaustion of the topic from the first two weeks, and to the faculty's ambiguous role at these dialogues. Now that the dialogues have fi- nally come to an end, plans for next year are already being deliberated. A continuation of the dialogues addressing another theme will most likely occur next year. The topic for the dialogues has not yet been determined but ideas of address- ing different cases of discrimina- tion such as sexism or religious dis- crimination have been suggested. The success of the Dialogues on Race can be attributed to not only the three groups who organized them, Peer Facilitators, MAG, and Student Forum, b·:t also to the nu- merous organizatwns on the Union cumpus that hosted these events and encouraged their members to attend. ficial complaint ha~ been n~ade; it's possible that a formal challenge may be issued, though nothing is concrete. More controversy surrounded the post-election situation. Al- though it does not appear in the guidelines of the Election Board, it has traditionally been their policy to n<Jt release election numbers. At the Student Forum meeting on Monday the 11th, the release ofthe actual numbers was debated, and it was decided that further investi- gation would be made into the situ- ation. Traditionally numbers aren't released because they do not wish to hurt the feelings of tF!e losers, and they do not wish to discour- age anyone from running for a po- sition because of fear their poor result may be printed in Concordiensis, or to discourage any0ne from running in the conse- quent class elections. Member of the Elections Board and Junior Trustee Jonathan Zandman re- leased the vote counts to CoJlcordiensis on Tuesday after- nooll, after being rebuffed many times by members of the Student Fon1m. The elections board was pleased with the election, but Senior Trustee Ruthie Strosberg showed moderate disappointment in the elections because of the continual Greek dominance, but next year, for the first time in four years, the Stu- dent Forum will have an indepen- dent president who is looking to make changes.

Usually, Coi1C(}rdiensis prints all campaign statements·. Previously, Concordie11sis b~d not been strict about the J5ive11 deadlines. Last year, former Editor-in-ChiefFrank Rossi was a. ca11didate for presi- dent and &d nQt want to cause controversy by disallowing late campaign statements. This year, the Editors-'lm-Cllief would not ac- cept late statements. However, there was conflict as to the actual deadline. lhe petition signed by each candidatestated the deadline was I PM Sunday, May J'd while the Electi()n:s Board bylaws said 4 PM. Conc~rdiensis accepted the late campaig11 statement ofMichael Parisi beca11se of a family emer- gency. Many were not able to have their campaign statements printed and the St11dent Forum met on Monday May 4th to discuss the situation. Many solutions were offered to fb.:. t:he problem, includ- ing some 11s hostile as forcing Concordien:sis to print the state- ments agai11st its will, as the Fo- ulty, and students so that all levels of the college community were rep- resented.\ The application of the dialogues and the future of how they can be applied were discussed at the cer- emony. President Hull is consider- ing the idea of implementing the dialogues into freshmen orienta- tion and Preceptorial classes for next year. Hull also discussed bring- ing in various speakers to present their personal ideas about diver- sity. He is also looking into hiring more minority professors to the Union faculty, as this was a main Issue discussed at many of the dia- logues. Many students feel we can nun controls a significant portion ofCuncorJiensis' funding. It was decided that certain members of the Forum would contact the Editors- In-Chief to see if a solution would be possible. Due to the urgency of the situation and layout con- straints of the newspaper, no con- cessions were made. Another issue which arose was that candidate Joe Long's state- ment was poorly edited by Concordiensis. His statement was forced to be edited because of the time it was turned in. Many errors appeared in his statement, includ- ing a glaring error stating that he was running for Vice President of Finance, while he was in fact run- ning from Vice President of Admin- istration. Long went before the Forum this past Monday night, vo- \ calizing his discontent with Concordiensis. However, Long did not blame his loss on this is- sue. The closeness of the V.P. of Finance's race piqued curiosity be- cause ofParisi's inexperience and Pesikoff s vast experience concern- ing financially. Parisi is also a mem- ber ofTD Chi, a fraternity that tra- ditionally holds many offices on the Forum. The current Vice Presi- dent of Finance and the current Presidents ofthe Forum are Theta Delta Chis. Additionally, the elec- tion was controversial because the voting machines were moved twice during the day, and no one is sure of the effect of transporting the voting machines during use. No of- not really begin to address student issues unless the faculty is di- versely represented also. The idea for Dialogues on Race was origina'lly that of MAG and Peer Facilitators. Members from these two groups, along with Pro- fessor Patrik, attended a diversity workshop at Swarthmore College which gave ti:Jem the idea to bring similar issues to Union. The Intel- lectual Life Committee and Dean Alford provided funds for the dia- logues. Professor Fatrik continued the dialogues with professor-spon- sored dialogues for the two weeks following the student discussions. Unfortunately, these dialogues were not as successful. Professor Patrikattributed the low attendance to exhaustioa of the topic from the first two weeks, and to the faculty's ambiguous role at these dialogues. Now that the dialogues have fi. nally come to an end, plans for next year are already being deliberated. A continuatiGn of the dialogues addressing another theme will most likely occur next year. The topic for the dialogLJes has not yet been determined but ideas of address- ing different cases of discrimina- tion such as sex: ism or religious dis- crimination have been suggested. The success of the Dialogues on Race can be attributed to not only the three groups who organized them, Peer Facilitators, MAG, and Student Forum, b· :t also to the nu- merous orgallizatmns on the Union campus that hosted these events and encouraged their members to attend. ficial complai11t has been made; ifs possible that a formal challenge may be issued, though nothing is concrete. More contmversy surrounded the post-election situation. Al- though it does not appear in the guidelines ofthe Election Board, it has traditionally been their policy to not release election numbers. At the Student Forum meeting on Monday the 11th, the release of the actual numbers was debated, and it was decided that further investi- gation would be made into the situ- ation. Traditionally numbers aren't released because they do not wish to hurt the fee lings of the losers, and they do not wish to discour- age anyone from running for a po- sition because of fear their poor result may be printed in Concordiensis, or to discourage anyone from running in the conse- quent class elections. Member of the Elections Board and Junior Trustee Jonathan Zandman re- leased the vote counts to Cvncvrdiensis on Tuesday after- noon, after being rebuffed many times by mern bers of the Student Forum. The elections board was pleased with the election, but Senior Trustee Ruthie Strosberg showed moderate disappointment in the elections because of the continual Greek dominance, but next year, for the first time in four years, the Stu- dent Forum will have an indepen- dent president who is looking to make changes.

One of the most popularpeople in the his,. tory of all Latin American and a writer of high acclaim, Jose Marti is justly called \El Apostol\ of Cuba's independence due tO: his fierce devotion to his vision of a ·free Cuba and a unified Latin American. Besides being an ardent revolu- tionary and the architect of Cuba's independence, Jose Marti was a poet, a journalist, and an orator of high acclaim. Though his ideas and visions were not very inspiring to Cubans during his time, many Cubans to- day now look to lJim with high re- spect and there is now a deeply- rooted cult following of this great man, Wh.en looking at his life in retrospect, it is not a difficult task to imagine why he hasthis power- ful following.

The lOJrdAnniversary of • Green Day the Death of Jose Marti by Roberto R()drigue:z Staff Writer Next Tuesday, May 19, 1998, marks the I 03'c£ anniversary ofthe death of the Apostle of Cuban In- dependence: Jo-se MartL One of the mostpopular people in the his- tory of all Lati11 American .and a writer of higll a<:claim, Jose Marti is justly callecl \EI Ap6stol\ of Cuba's independence due to his fierce devotion to his vision of a free Cuba and a unified Latin Arnericim. Besides being an ardent revolu- tionary and the architect of Cuba's independence, Jose Marti was a poet, a journalist, and an orator of high acclaim. Though his ideas and visions were not very 'inspiring to Cubans during his time, many Cubans to- day now look b b im with high re- spect and there is now a deeply• rooted cult foil()wing ofthis great man. When ((Joking at his life in retrospect, it is not a difficult task to imagine wily llehas this power- ful following. Today, Jose Marti is regarded as a leader in the Modernist move- · ment His writings, which have been translated to the English lan- guage include Inside the Monster: Writings on the United States and American Imperialism (1975), Our America: Writings on Lati11 Ameri- can and the Cuban Struggle for lndependence(1978), and Educa- tkm(1979). He is known for his sincere po- etry on the ideology of Pan Ameri- canism; a united and liberated America, as well as his softhearted, and straightforward poetry, such as VersosSencillos(1891), his col- lection of children's stories, La Edad de Oro ( 1898), and the lsmaeli!lo poems (1882). After his death he was thought of very little and his political doc- trines had no influence on the de- velopment of Cuba afterwards. The legacy which Jose Marti left to Latin American as a whole must not be underestimated as his ideas serve as inspiration to the newer generations of. Latinos who feel reinvigorated to fight for the es- tablishment ofhis visions, like the one of the unification of America or\Our America.\ Continued from page 1 . hospital for various injuries. At 7:30, Samiam took the stage, and rocked the still incoming crowd from the pouring rain with songs from their latest album You're Really Freaking Me Out. The acoustics were far from spec- . tacular, often making the band dif- ficult to understand, although the crowd didn't seem to tnind as they rocked along. Samiam played for 25 minutes before ending their set. Finally, atabout8:35, Green Day took the stage with an enormous \Green Day\ banner in the back- ground and jammed to open their set. They followed up with their hit \Hitchin' A Ride\ from their lat- est album Nimrod. They contin- ued to excite the crowd for the next 90 minutes with other hits from Nimrod, Dookie, and Insomniac including their breakthrough hit, \Longview and hit from their first album \Basket Case.\ Billie Joe, Tre Cool, and Mike Dimt enter- , tamed the crowd, not only with their unique rock style, but their on- stage antics as well. Billie Joe · donned a devil mask and played the opening riffs to Marilyn Manson's \Beautiful People.\ He also invited Ben from Delancey up on stage to show off his guitar ·~>kills, and then told him to do a s1age dive. He also challenged the .~;rowd to name any metal song. '\I'm the <explicit word here> metal king,\ he quipped. Finally, at the end, the trio thrilled the crowd with their catchy hit \When I Come /\round.\ They then proceeded to <lestroy the onstage setup, trash- ing their drums and knocking over the speakers. For the encore, Billie J()e played Green Day's smash hit \Good Riddance\ (The Time of Your Life). A rather large mosh pit formed in front of the stage and a few people suffered injuries. Accord- ing to Paul Mantica, Director of Security at Union College: 30 people suffered minor injuries. 12 people suffered serious injuries, but only one was a Union student. Matt Aronowitz, a sophomore, C()mmented that \some people just d(}n't know how to dance. I was an unlikely recipient of an elbow to tbe nose.\ Aronowitz did not g<> to the hospital, but went to the doctor's office on Wednesday. Four people, however, were not so lucky, and were hospitalized for various injuries. All were 15 years old. On,e female was kicked in the head while ctowd surfmg. She suf- fered pain in her neck, arms, and ribs. Another 15 year oid female from Saratoga Spa was crowd surf- ing, a11d was dropped six feet and Iande<! on her head. She suffered minoriJieeding, dizziness, and neck and lte;ad pain. A 15 year old male from Corinth suffered an irregular heartbleat. Another 15 year old fe- male Sllffered a severe shortness ofbrerutl1. All four were transported to Ellis Hospital. Due to their age, Manti«:a could not release their names~ Also, two Gloversville residents were atTested at the show. Melanie Monk, 26, and Gary Tomlinson, 31, both of 8 Prospect Place, Glovers ville were arrested. Monk was cl.arged with disorderly con- duct f()r \unreasonable noise,\ ac- cmdin~ to the Schenectady Police Depa!itment. She was held pend- ing $!.()0 bail. Tomlinson was charg~d with second degree ha- rassment and resisting arrest. He was held pending $300 bail. No further information was available. Asi!le from the injuries and the two .mrrests, Finkelstein noted, \overall I was satisified.\ Finkelstein reported that although the show was not a sellout, Delse11er/Siater, the promoter for theSh()W, was \happy with the use of the facilities and thought it went well,\' reported Finkelstein. Finkelstein commented that he anil Delsemer/Slater look forward to working; together in the future.

Twenty members ofUnion's American Society of Civil Engineers an- swered this challenge, trying to come up with a fast, functional, and efficient entry in the annual collegiate Concrete Canoe Competi- tion in Buffalo, New York. Racing against nine other teams, ASCE members dared their engineering peers to challenge The Great White. Not all the competition took place on the water. Judges assessed the overall appear- ance of the canoe beginning at 7:30 on Sat- urday morning. They rated the entries for creativity, quality of the finish, and adher- ence to the design criteria. Craig Gibson, an economics major with a minor in fine arts, designed the finish of Union's canoe tore- semble a Great White shark. Once the canoes had been graded for ap- pearance, the teams then had to prove that they could float. The canoes were taken one by one to the Jake and \swamped or filled with water. I fit started to sink, more floata- tion had to be added to make it safe for pad- dling. The Union canoe passed on the first try due to its low unit weight of 1.04 grams per cubic centimeter (water is only 1.00 g/ cm 3 ), and advanced straight to the races. In the first race on the course, Rich Clos and Kris Lovelett represented Union in the men's sprint, which was roughly l 00 meters. Next, Sara Lewis and Rachel Callahan raced in the women's sprints, also l 00 meters. Rich Clos and Katie Ott then raced the Great White in the coed sprints, winning their heat and earning the chance to compete in the finals later that afternoon. hi these brief yet powerful exhibitions, the canoe's speed and efficiency was truly put to the test. With the heats for the sprint competition completed, the long-distance racing began. The course was stretched to about 900 meters, posing a challenge to the canoe's durability and the rower'sendtuance. To add to the difficulty, a 100-meter sJalom section was also incorporated. Here, the rowers had to maneuver the canoe around a series of buoys. Warren LeBeau and John Cloutier competed on the men's side, finishing in just under 8 minutes. In the women ·s event, row- ers Mary McKay and Katie Ott crossed the finish line ina little over 8 minutes. After lunch, the finals were held for the men's, women's, and coed sprints. Ott and Clos, who had the best 1ime in the heats by 1 0 seconds, held on to their favored posi- ~i?n to win the finals. In spite of being be- y-tnd at the halfway point, the pair was able to make a comeback and leave the competi- tion in their wake. Once the racing was completed, the com- petitors sprinted first to the showers, then to set up a display that detailed the Great . White's construction. Attists Jen Amann and Bryan Serrell's shark i~ustrations were used to enhance the presentation's theme. Dan Dennis expertly designed the 6' x 8' folding frame, upon which Warren Lebeau organized the placement of photographs, visual a ids, and brief narratives of the project. Ott and McKay presented the project to a group of students, professors, and a panel · of judges on PowerPoint. Followed by a question and answer period, they explained in detail the procedure behind Great White's creation.

Science & Technology OJn·m:adrimsis • May 14, 1998 • Page 7 Science & Technology The Long Road to Cure Cancer by Victoria Hargreaves S& T Editor The lungs, the brain, the colon, the prostate, and the skin. These are on!ly a few of the parts of the body cancer can attack, pervade, and eventually destroy. While mil- lions of families in the un,ited States know someone who has died of cancer, survival rates have actually increased since the 1930's. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) reported that only 25 percent of patients Hved for at least five years after their diagnosis of cancer in 1:930. \Now 97 percent of women diagnosed with breast cancer that has not spread live for five years or more, 80 percent of children with acute lymphocytic leukemia Hve, and 87 percent of prostate cancer patients survive.\ While ear]y detection plays a large role in these increased survival rates, new technologies have also helped to ease the pain for cancer patients and prolong their lives. \More than 300 new therapies are currently being tested, ranging from drugs that directly target tu- mors, to vaccines that turn the body's defenses against tumors, to gene therapy that aims to stop can- cer at the most basic level.\ Several drugs have recently beef! in the news for having \com- pletely wiped out tumors in mice\ by starving the tumors of blood. To get more nour- ishment from the blood, the rapidly dividing cells \attract unusually large· amounts of a honnone-Iike substance called VEG-F, for vascular endothelial growth factor, which at-· taches to a special recep- tor on cancer cells, spur- ring production of new blood vessels.\ The pro- cess of growing new ves- sels is called angiogenesis. The new drugs, called an- giogenesis inhibitors, block the blood supply to the tumors and thereby kills them. While most of the previous can- cer treatments treat the cancerous cells, new drugs are aimed at in- juring the blood vessels which sup- ply the cells with oxygen and nu- trient requirements. SU5416, an angiogenesis inhibitor, developed in California, successfully killed tumors in rats, and is now treating cancer in thirty humans. It spe- cifically blocks the g11owth factor from binding to the receptor and therefore prevents new blood ves- sels from growing. Dr. David Cheresh, !he first scientist reported to have successfully used angio- genesis inhibitors to ki II tumors, compares this technique to a lawn sprinkler. He says, \We all know what will happen to the grass, so it's easy to understand what can happen to the tumor if its source of nourishment is turned off.\ Although the results ofthese drugs offer a lot of potential, research- The Rise of the Pentium II· By Daniel Kehnanovich Staff Writer The Pentium II is the latest pro- cessor being sold by Intel. It has a different design than the traditional Pentium and uses a slot 1 interface rather til an socket 7. The original Pentium processors use socket 7, as do other companies who are try- ing to compete with Intel like Cyrix and AMD. The difference between socket 7 and slot 1 de- signs are how the CPU is plugged into the motherboard. By switch- ing all their processors to the slot I design, Intel is trying to limit its competition. Despite the rise of Pentium II processors, tens of mil- lions of socket 7 processors will be shipped in 1998. The Pentium II ranges in clock speed from 233Mhz to 400Mhz with a 450Mhz to be shipped by the end of the year. When Intel made its 333 Mhz Pentium II, they started using a new technique to make the chips, code named Deschutes, which used a 0.25 mi- cron version ofthe CPU.

These are only a few :of the parts of the body cancer can attack, pervade, and eventually destroy. While mil- lions of families in the United States know someone who has died of cancer, survival rates have ·actually increased since the 1930's. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) reported that only 25 percent of patients I ived for at least five years after their diagnosis of cancerin 1930. \Now 97 percent of women diagnosed with breast cancer that has not spread live for five years or more, 80 percent of children »'ith acute lymphocytic leukemia live, and 87 percent of prostate cancer patients survive.\ While early detect,ion plays a large role in these incFeased survival rates, new technologies have also helped to ease the pain for cancer patients and prolong their lives. \More than 300new therapies are currently being tested, ranging from drugs that directly target tu- mors, to vaccines that turn the body's defenses against tumors, to gene therapy thataims to stop can- cer at the most basic level.\ Several drugs have recently been ·in the news for having \com- pletely wiped outtumors in mice\ by starving the tumors of blood. To get more nour- ishtnent from the blood, .the rapidly dividing cel'ls \attract unusually large amounts of ahorrn<Jne~like substance called VEG-F, for vascular endothelial growth factor, which at- taches to a special recep- tor on cancer cells, spur- ring production of new blood vessels.\ The pro- cess of growing new ves- sels is called angiogenesis. The new drugs, called an- giogenesis inhibitors, block the blood supply to the tumors and thereby kills them. While most of the previous can- cer treatments treat the cancerous cells, new drugs are aimed at in- juringthe blood vessels which sup- ply the cells with oxygen and nu- trient requirements. SU5416, an angiogenesis inhibitor, developed in California, successfully killed tumors in rats, and is now treating cancer in thirty humans. It spe- cifically blocks the growth factor from binding to ·the receptor and therefore prevents new blood ves- sels from growing. Dr. David Cheresh, the first scientist reported to have successfully used angio- genesis inhibitors to kill tumors, compares this technique to a lawn sprinkler. He says, \We all know what will happen to the grass, so it's easy to understand what can happen to the tumor if its source of nourishment is turned off.\ Although the results ofthese drugs offer a lot of potential, research- Th.e Rise. of the Pentium II By Daniel Kelmanovich Staff Writer The Pentium II is the !~test pro- cessor b.eing sold by Intel. It has a different design than the traditional Pentium and uses a slot 1 interface rather than socket 7. The original Pentium processors use socket 1, as do other companies who are try- ing to compete with Intel like Cyrix and AMD. The difference between socket 7 and slot 1 de- signs are how the CPU is plugged into the motherboard. By switch- ing all their processors to the slot I design, Intel is trying to limit its competition. Despite the rise of Pentium II processors, tens of mil- lions of socket T processors will be shipped in 1998. . ' ':'· ,, ..... .. · The Pentium II ranges in clock sor code named Covington. This speed from 233Mhz to 400Mhz CPU will not have' any level 2 with a 450Mhz to be shipped by cache and thus will run slower than the end of the year.

My lqrd, I'm telling you, one of these days I'm just going to jump out the window. But then again, I regress. Maybe I shouldn't have taken this job ifl didn't expect this kind of thing. And what am I saying about \crap\ in my section? Let me tell you, you're reading the most crap in the Opinions section this week. So I -got some flak for what I wrote a couple of weeks ago i.e. Geppetto'sand Yulman theater. I guess I'm never welcome at Geppetto's and Paulie's getting the mafia after me. Guess what PauHe-l'm half-Italian, so you can'tget my own people af- ter me! And what's the problem with the idea of \half-off pitch- ers for the five and under crowd?\ Didn't mean to steal your idea or anything ... And then I've never heard the last .of that whole Yulman the- ater thing. \No the waterdoesn't come through the roofl Have you ever been in Yulman before? Of course not!\ Ignorant? Why would anyone imply that? Well, the letters have really been stacking up for the past few weeks, and I thought that I had better attend to them before it gets out of hand and l make the mistake of throwing them out or something. \1 liked your attempt at being all serious last week. Sure, you write something bad about AD Phi and then expect that they're going to make it up to you jm•t by writing a good article? Are you joking me? Wiry don't you just do tlrat for everyone else you've poked fun of this year! 1 'm sure you could really fill til at Opinions section of yours up pretty fast!\ Yup, I guess you're right. There are a whole bunch of AD kids in one of my classes and I couldn't stand to have them all wondering why I wrote that stuff and who I thought I was writing it. \I'm sorry, but the A&E sec- tion has to be tile worst in the paper-/ mean even worse than features. I don't know wllo ,file editors are for that section, but they really need to learn that a good section is more than just an advertisement for upcoming plays. If /wanted to see an ad, 1 would have looked on the col- lege center walls, I didn't have to flip tltrough an actual sec- tion!\ If you really do have a prob- lem with it, contact either Lori Greene or Kim Rohback. I know that they put a lot of work into making the section what it is be- cause they make me lay it out ev- ery Sunday. It's disgusting be- cause l have been their slave since the beginning of the year, and then they expect me to do whatever they ask. I'm telling you, it's worse than hazing, it's awful.

And what am I saying about \'crap\ in my section? Let me tell you, you're reading the most crap in the Opinions section this week. So I got some flak for what I wrote a couple of weeks ago i.e. Geppetto's and Yulman theater. I guess I'm never welcome at Geppetto's a11d Paulie's getting the mafia after me. Guess what Paulie-l'm half-Italian, so you can't get my own people af- ter me! And what's the problem with the idea of \half-off pitch- ers for the five and under crowd?\ nidn 't mean to steal your idea or anylhing ...

Sure, you write something bad about AD Phi and then expect that they're going to make it up to you just by writing a good article? Are you joking me? Why don'tyou just do that for everyone else you've poked fun of this year! J 'm sure you could really fill that Opinions section of yours up pretty fast!\ Yup, I guess you're right. There are a whole bunch of AD kids in one of my classes and I couldn't stand to have them all wondering why I wrote that stuff and who I thought I was writing it. \I'm sorry, hut the A&E sec- tion has to be the worst in the paper-/ mean even worse than features. I don't know who the editors are for that section, hut they really need to learn that a good section is more than just an advertisement for upcoming plays. If I wanted to see an ad, I would have looked 011 the col- lege center walls, I didn't have to flip through an actual sec- tion!\ If you really do have a prob- lem with it, contact either Lori Greene or Kim Rohback. I know that they put a lot of work into making the section what it is be- cause they make me lay it out ev- ery Sunday. It's disgusting be- cause I have been their slave since the beginning of the year, aRd then they expect me to do whatever they ask. I'm telling you, it's worse than hazing, it's awful. Well, I've filled enough space for this week, make sure to read next week when I will discuss the intricacies of Dutch Hollow and why it's actually better to walk out with your food than wait for the cashiers to check you out.

OP/ED The Student Voice- - . . . . . .. - With the recent Sfildent Forum reJection r-esults and upcoming Class Representative races, it would se:em appropriate to discuss the cur- rent activity occurring-within the student government. The activities of the Student Forum are very often. viewed as an \untouchable\ area of discussion 1 as many organizati,ons fear loss of.funding or support ifthey cause discontent among tile Forum's members. The Student Forum is a student-run body that does not answer to the call of either administration or faculty. Rather, it is an institution which acts ofits own volition, an ii11stitution which operates based on the fluctuations and perceptions ofa solelystudent-b'asedcontingent. Although, ideally, this concept is a perfect representation of a demo- cratic, unhinderedstudent voice, tile 'reality is that the Student Forum's · powetmay be too great for its owo capability. A group of individuals who essentially run most ofthe inmer workings of this campus has no higher authority under which it ew:erhas to defer. This may seem to be a beneficia] aspect for the Union student body, a student body which very often scooams out against the apparent control administration and faculty try to exert. The recent Alpha Delta Phi housing situation is testament to that fact. On the surface, it would appear that the Student Forum is ille one place in which the student voice stand·s unaffected, not oppressed by any supposedly \higher\ authority. But at an institution which is .so often the victim of histri,. onic popularity·contests rather tban political elections, is it possible that the people chosen to run this P()rum of student voices may not be · the most qualified, but, rather, the most known? The answer to that question ha:s no clearly defined answer. What can clearly be said is that in a small college environment, elections are very often based more on persomal knowledge of a candidate rather than the contentofthe mission stattementheorsheputs forth. Despite • what the implications of that fact ;are, it is clear that objective forces are not the only ones at work in voti:ng choice~ It is also clear that subjective voting may cause incomsistencies in the caliber and quali- fication ofthose chosen to hold positions in the student government. Those inconsistencies could be the cause of future damaging and often unalterable decisions. The United States government operates under a system of checks and baLances within its varieus branches, and although within the Forum itse:lf, tb_e various divisions may watch over one another, essentially there is no outside form ofhealthy regu- lation. That fact has not really posed a ploblem for the student body thus far, but the question arises as to wllether or not 11pecial interest groups within the Fomm may act self-servingly in the future. That possibil- ity is dangerous one. The solution for that possibility is not so easily defined. ainn.cn:r.b-i.eusis The Student Newsptlper of Union College Since 1877 Schenectady's Olt!.est Newspaper Christopher Leone Michelle Tham Jenn Pelose EXECUTIVE EDITOR David Kay OPINIONS EDITOR Jim DeWan NEWS EDITOR Jason Goldberg SPORTS EDITOR Scott Scullion.

The one issue that has constantly coine up is the history that .goes alongwiththe house. [n 1898, this college saw fit, for whatever rea- son,to give that particular house on that particular piece of land to AD PhL They entrusted it and the re- spo11sibility for it to the fraternity for 100 years. 100 years is an ex- tremely long time. In that time Al- pha. Delta Phi fraternity has made it their home where they all have ge11e through life changing experi- ences. They have created a tradi- tioll. They, as all fraternities and sororities at this school, have estab- lishc:d and inherited a constant set of ·rituals, culture, customs, and values that will stay with them for the rest of their lives. Just as this inheritance oftraditions has passed thr()ughAD Phi history, so has their house, and yes it is their house no matter who the lease belongs to now. [t has been theirs for 100 years. Does that mean anything to this school? Obviously not. Another thing that doesn't seem to matter to the Union administra- tion is the student body itself. I thin]< Union has misp1aced their prioxities in the broad scheme of things, Union's first concern should be the students who are currently attending this school not the Admissions building. We are the people who will carry our Union experience wherever we go in life, At this point in time, the present student body's view of the Administration is not a positive one. This attitude of discontent will effect the morale of the school and eventually end up hurting it greatly. If students con- tinue to be disrespected and the lack of communication persists this outcome is definite. · It seems the Administration is trying to make Union something it is not and taking away every ... thing it is known for. This school is set apart from every other small liberal arts schaol in the country because ii is known as \The Mother of Fraternities.\ This is something unique about this school. This is something that will not change and I should hope that Union would not want it to change. It is what is unique about this school. The Administration seems to think that this has nega- tive connotations but that is be- cause they do not see how valu- able the Greek system is to this campus. The Greek system provides an outlet for a great number of stu- dents to become involved in the community on campus and off campus. Various houses raise a lot of money for charities. With- out the Greek system many good causes would be without crucial financial support. Fraternities and sororities are- many times the rea- son certain stu4ents remain at Union. WitliGut their ties to their houses thesestudents would either return home or transfer, reflecting poorly in the school. At most col- leg~s alumnae support tends to come from tlu}se who where once in the Greek system. A large amount of students have dedicated themselves to one of the 21 Greek holls.es on this campus, and through this self~goveming body they develop social skills, dedication, !leadership and they learn how t(:) exist and interact within a close group of people. These skills !lre extremely neces- sary, along with the academic learning the 5chool promotes so much, for surviving in our world today. The Master Plan, starting with taking away AD's ho11se seems to begin to undermine the whole Greek system that brings so many positive thing;s to the Union Col- lege campus. Slowly, with each new rule passed or house taken, the Greek system will suffer and even- tually die out And when it dies most of the :history and traditions of this school will die too. I ask the Administration to please be sensitivetotheneedsand wants of the stlldent body that in- vests so mucb in their school, and want to remember their experience here as a positive one.

As you ~U may know, two weeks ago, I was brutally re- buffed on my response to the Deans letter<liscussing Academic Warning. I mus-1 say that the rebuttal was well- thought out, however, Mr. Carrier neglected to discuss the negatives of this letter .. I feel no need to discuss these as you can refer to \Excuse Me ·But\ in Volume CXXVIl, Number XIX of the Conc(Jrdiensis dated April 23, 1998. Ho..Wever, I do have one question for Mr. Carrier. Are you running for any particular position on the· Committee on the Standing of Stu- dents on Academic Warning or are you simply trying to obtain good standing in the eyes of the faculty? OK, so I know that I spoke about \gossip\ last week, but as I am sans something to bitch about, I am broaching the topic yet once again. However this week, I feel it imperative to narrow down the topic to \gossip at Union College.\ Lets reflect for a moment on l;tow old we are and how mature we should be, yet all we have to talk about with one another are petty goings-on which have nothing to do with us. All we ever hear about is who did what with who at parties, or who wasn't 'cool enough' to get a bid, or who isn't 'popular.' I know there are many things I'm neglecting here as far as what people gossip about, but I have a column, NOT a novel. Don't we have anything better to do? OK; bad qu~stion, we do attend Union College. I would lik~to apolog~ze for my language in this particular article, however, I feel it is necessary, in order to express the degree of my emotions and feelings regarding this specific t<>pic. Some may say, \Well it is not my fault becau.se I don't take part in it.\ However, if we don't do anything to st()}) it, aren't we just as guilty? If I knew ~bout a murder, but don't \take part\ in it, aren't I still an accomplice to murder? As far as the UnitedSta.tes Judicial Sys- tem is concerned, I am. The way I see it, is that this. same rule should apply to this sitllation . One once said to me, \I don't haze, but my house does.\ Isn't this particular individual just as guilty as those who do haze be- cause this individual doesn't do anything to stOip itl I suppose the moral of this weeks article is that we are all at fault, whether we take part or not, unless we attempt to do s()mething to stop the situation, whatever it is, whether it is gossiping, hazing, or whatever. Union is like ()Uf own little com- munity and sb()uldn't we make it the best it possibly can be? OK, so we can't l:!ave a utopia, but it could be a hell of a lot better than it is now, socially at least.

age 10 My articles this term have been horrible -- I mean the worst piece of written material ever. In fact,. some people have suggested that not only iis my article a waste .of space, but that the entire Features section is a waste of space, a waste of trees, and a waste of school money. Don't get me wrong, I am not trying to be a self-defeatist here or anything, but even I would not want to read my article every week. So the purpose of this week's endeavor into the wide world of journalism hopefully will be not only intelligent, but a,lso en- joyable to read. Joseph E. Levine once said, \You can fool ail the people all the time ifthe advertising is right and the budget is big enough.\ Let me just start by saying that I am nei- ther paranoid nor do I see con- spiracies around every corner. I am an X-Files fan, but the govern- ment is not kidnapping people and disguising it as alien abductions. However, this quote disturbs me. You can fool all the people all of the time if you have plenty of the green stuff. Is this true; can it be that in reality we have no free will and that we are all just lemmings? No matter how scary that idea sounds, in some cases it is true. Take something like the word JIGGY. Now we have all heard it at least once. 1t has been in sev- eral different top ten songs. Seinfeld said it in one of his final episodes. And the fine magazine Entertainment Weekly has used the word in a number of their articles during the past several weeks. A II over the country, people are get- ting their copy of Entertainment Weekly, a case of beer, and are playing the Jiggy Game. See the word jiggy and then chug a beer. Real simple, right? Well I played, andyou dosomeveryheavydrink- ing in this game. However, neither drinking games nor the word 'jiggy\ are the point of this article. What gets me is that the large amount of money spent on promoting the album, ra- dio air play which equals revenue from advertisers, all add up to the fact that the word jiggy is now ~n accepted word in the English lan- guage. You know this because Jay Leno uses it on his show. Even the adults have accepted jiggy-- run for the hills! Just do it as jiggy as you can. Jiggy is not the problem! The problem I ies in the fact that the quote is becoming more true as each day passes. Movie companies run previews of a movie up to six months be- fore they are scheduled to come out. By the time they do arrive in our local megaplex, we have been conditioned by all the advertising that this is the movie we must see. At all costs we have to go to this movie~- not once but three times. Did anyone really think that Ti- tanic was an outstanding movie? I don't think it was even close, no way was itjiggy. Yet we had to go and see it. We felt compel'led to go. -Peer pressure, combined with all the press it received, made us go. Size does matter! I am pretty sure that if someone gave me 200 million dollars, I coulcl make a good portion of the popu- lous believe in something enough that they would want to spend money on it. That is why home shopping channels are so successful. The hosts convince us to buy various goods that in no way do we need. There should be no reason why at 2:00 AM J would be reaching for the phone to order \Hitz of the 70's\ for $9.99, plus four dollars shipping and handling. I don't need another crappy 70's CD, but sometimes it is so hard to resist. We are bombarded in every- thing that we do. In sports, the Green Monster at Fenway has gi- ant coke bottles on it. Major League Soccer uniforms are cov- ered in the team's sponsor. There are ads in the beginning of my video rentals. Lastly even our own radio station is trying to bring in advertising. So that brings us back to the question that was posed earlier in the article. Are we lemmings? Does advertising, and the amount ofmoney spent on it, really have that much control over us? I am going to give a lame answer. My answer to this question is yes and no. No, because advertising and money are important to us Ameri- cans. Look at what we do and watch. Movies: the bigger, the better. We need more explosions, more guns, a hero that is bigger th.an life with a· girl who has breasts just as big as the hero's ego-- which I will add is huge (The ego, not the breasts, you sicko). However, we are fooling the people all of the time. The ulti- mate example of this is the Super Bowl. No longer is the focus on tbe game, a match of talent be- tween the two best teams in the league. Instead, it is all about mak- ing the commercials the center of attention on Super Sunday. What did the average 30 second slot go for? One point nine million dol- lars for thirty seconds of televi- sion time. Whoever said time is money knew what he was talking about. \You can. fool all the people all the time if the advertising is right and the budget is big enough.\ My name is Matt Aronowitz and I am running for the position of Vice-President of · Student Apathy. You're probably wondering about my experience. Well, I didn't participate in any- thing in high school. I feel that it is best when one takes from their school and doesn't give back. Don't we all? I have no idea how school politics are tun. All I lmow · is that it involves a lot of lying. I am very good liar. 1 just want this job so that I can lead myself to believe that I'm popular and ev- erybody liker: me. I plan to woo you with big signs that tell you ·.nothing about me or my platform. After all, does anybody really know what the real \issues\ are. I certainly don't. That's not what the Student Forum is about. It's about smiling at someone and then taking a machete and goring them from the inside out. Stabbing them in the back, so to speak. I'm good at that. When I was in Viet- . nam, I had to do that almost ev- eryday to the \Char lies.\ I lost rnost of my limbs there, but I seem to have turned out OK. I also plan to wear a suit the day of the elec- tion and stand outside the CC looking pretty. I will harass you to vote for me. If you don't, l will have my roving gang of Jay Street Crack-Heads hunt you down and i11form you of your grave error. Don'tbegivin' dem no lip. Vote for Matt Aronowitz. I am perfect for the job of VICE-PRESIDENT OF STU- DENT APATHY. Anyone who lcnows me will tell you that I care about myself, first and foremost. If I win I won't be \here for you. 11 lam lazy, unreliable and reallyjust don't give a crap about you or your \needs.\ I like drinking, smoking, and meaningless sex.

My articles this term have been horrible --I mean the worst piece of written material ever. In fact, some people have suggested tllat Aot only is my article a waste of space, but that the entire Features section is a waste of space, a waste of trees, and a waste of school money. Don't get me wrong, I am not tryiAg to be a self-defeatist mere or anything, but even I would not want to read my article every week. So the purpose of this week's endeavor into the wide world of journalism hopefully.....,ill be not only intelligent, but also el1- joyable to read. Joseph E. Levine once said, \You can fool all the people all the time ifthe advertising is right and the budget is big enough.\ Let me just start by saying that I am nei- ther paranoid nor do I see ccon- spiracies around every corner. I am an X-Files fan, but the govern- ment is not kidnapping peopie a11d disguising it as alien abductiO>n s. However, this quote disturbs rne. You can fool all the people all of the time if you have plenty of the green stuff Is this true; can it be that in reality we have no free wi II and that we are all just lemmings? No matter how scary that idea sounds, in some cases it is true. Take something like the word JIGGY. Now we have all heard it at least once. It has been in sev- eral different top ten songs. Seinfeld said it in one of his final episodes. And the fine magazine Entertainment Weekly has usedthe word in a number of their artie les during the past several weeks. All over the country, people are g-et- ting their copy of Entertainme11.t Weekly. a case of beer, and are playing the Jiggy Game. See the word jiggy and then chug a be(!r. Real simple, right? Well I played, and you do some very h€avy driruk- ing in this game. However, neither drinking games nor the word 'j iggy\ are tihe point of this article. What gets 111e is that the large amount ofmoncey spent on promoting the album, ra- dio air play which equals revenue from advet1isers, all add up to tile fact that the wordjiggy is now an accepted word in the English laJJ- guage. You know this because Jay Leno uses it on his show. Even the adults have accepted jiggy-- run for the hills! Just do it as jiggy as you can. Jiggy is not the problem! The problem I ies in the fact that the quote is becoming more true as each day passes. Movie companies run previews of a movie up to six months be- fore they are scheduled to come out. By the time they do arrive iin our local megaplex, we have bee:n conditioned by all the advertis i1tg that this is the movie we must see. At all costs we have to go to this movie-- not once but three times. Did anyone real'ly lhink that Ti- tanic was an outstanding movie? I don't think it was even close, no way was it jiggy. Yet we had to go and see it. We felt compelled to go. Peer pressure, combined with all the press it received, made us go. Size does matter! I am pretty sure that if someone gave me 200 million dol'lars, I could make a good portion of the popu- lous believe in something enough that they would want to spend money on it. That is why home shopping channels are so successful. The hosts convince us to buy various goods that in no way do we need. There should be no reason why at 2:00 AM I would be reaching for the phone to order \Hitz of the 70's\ for $9.99, plus four dollars shipping and handling. I don't need another crappy 70's CD, but sometimes it is so hard to resist. We are bombarded in every- thing that we d<J. In sports, the Green Monster at Fenway has gi- ant coke bottles on it. Major League Soccer uniforms are cov- ered in the team's sponsor. There are ads in the beginning of my video rentals. Lastly even our own radio station is trying to bring in advertising. So that brings us back to the question that was posed earlier in the article. Are we lemmings? Does advertising, and the amount of money spent on it, really have that much control over us? I am going to give a lame answer. My answer to this question is yes and no. No, because advertising and money are important to us Ameri- cans. Look at what we do and watch. Movies: the bigger, the better. We need more explosions, more guns, a hero that is bigger than life with a' girl who has breasts just as big as the hero's ego-- which I will add is huge (The ego, not the breasts, you sicko). However, we are fooling the people all of the time. The ulti- mate example of this is the Super Bowl. No longer is the focus on the game, a match of talent be- tween the two best teams in the league. Instead, it is all about mak- ing the commercials the center of attention on Super Sunday. What did the average 30 second slot go for? One point nine million dol- lars for thirty seconds of televi- sion time. Whoever said time is money knew what he was talking about. \You can fool all the people all the time if the advertising is right and the budget is big enough.\ _______ ..,......, My name is Aronowitz and I am running for the position of Vice-President of Student Apathy. You're probably wondering about my experience. Well, I didn't participate in any- thing in high school. I feel that it is best when one takes from their school and doesn't give back. Don't we all? I have no idea how school politics are run. All I know is that it involves a lot of lying. I am very good liar. I just wantthis job so that I can lead myself to believe that I'm popular and ev- erybody like· me. I plan to woo you with big signs that tell you nothing about me or my platform. After all, does anybody really know what the real \issues\ are. I certainly don't. That's not what the Student Forum is about. If s about smiling at someone and then taking a machete and goring them from the inside out. Stabbing them in the back, so to speak. I'm good at that. When I was in Viet- nam, I had to do that almost ev- eryday to the \Charlies.\ I lost most of my limbs there, but I seem to have turned out OK. I also plan . to wear a suit the day of the elec- tion and stand outside the CC looking pretty. I wi II harass you to vote forme. Ifyoudon't, I will. have my roving gang of Jay Street Crack-Heads hunt you down and inform you of your grave error. Don't be givin' dem no lip. Vote for Matt Aronowitz. I am perfect for the job of VICE-PRESIDENT OF STU- DENT APATHY. Anyone who knows me will tell you that I care about myself, first and foremost. If I win I won't be ''here for you.\ I am lazy, unreliable and really just don't give a crap about you or your \needs.\ I like drinking, smoking, and meaningless sex. If that doesn't represent most ofthe stu- dent body, then I don't know what does.

Features JoiJ. Tapper•s Weekly Comme:n.t:ary In this weeks column, I feel that I should give my a(ioring fans at least one piece of useful informa- tion that wHl affect their lives. So without any further ado, here it is. The United States Post Office has announced this week that starting sometime this summer, the cost of mailing a letter in the United States will increase a cent, from 32 to 33 cents. This despite the fact that the Post Office has raised over a bil- lion dollars in revenue in each of the last three years. Those greedy ·bastards. My computer screen is so dusty right now that I am having a hard time reading what I just wrote, I don't know why I just wrote that. People have been telling me that I have nothing relevant to write about. Maybe they are right? I don't think so though. And I am going to prove it by staying on track for the rest of the article. The Green Day concert was last Sunday. I am still trying to locate any of the people who actually at- tended the concert (yes, I am talk- ing to both of you). I have nothing against Green Day (except for the fact that they suck and they aren't really that talented), but 20 bucks a ticket was just a little bit pricey for me for Sunday night entertainment. What's the world coming to when Green Day can't sell 2,000 tickets in Schenectady, but the Spice Girls can sell 20,000 tickets wherever the hell they damn well please? I am thinking that if the Spice Girls didn't look like two dol- lar hookers (and most ofthem are) then no one would pay a minimum of30 dollars a ticket to g<l see them live in concert like a mile away from the stage. To my knowledge, April is sup- posed to be the month when it rains a lot and May is supposed to be the month when it is sunny. Yet, here in Schenectady, April was just dark and cloudy, and it has been raining far. Man this place is backwards. I was having a debate last night with some of my friends. The movie in question is the 1996 ac- tion thriller The Rock. I think that Jay Leno had a line in the movie. If anyone can give me a definite answer to this question, that would really be quite helpful. And it would probably prove me right. And while we are on the sub- ject of ending debates about stu- pid, pointless trivia, I have to ask a questi~n that has been bother- ing me for a couple ofmonths now. Can anyone tell me what four shows made up the original DisneyAfternoon? I have no idea so I need your help on this one. Help me end this painful ordeal by filling me on the correct an- swer. Springfest is this weekend. There is only one thing that I can absolutely guarantee about Springfest. Come rain, sleet, or snow; hell or high water, I can guarantee where you can locate me this weekend. I will be passed out on the lawn in front of my donn. Feel free to drop by and say a quick hello. Who knows, I might remember you and give you a special shout out in next week's column (probably not though since I'm most likely not going to remember you). That's it for me for this week. I don't want to take up any more of your precious time. Any ques- tions, comments, or answers to my stupid questions can be sent to Box #2037. I really like get- ting mail so feel free to attempt to answer some of the questions that I addressed in this week's column. Until next time, stay dry and keep reading this incredible piece of literary genius. And if you really like my article tell the features editor Eugen Schultz. He has been feeling blue lately. Bye for With only a few week:s left in the term, I suppose I have been feeling an overwhelming sense of loss. Both for the leaving of my senior friends and the passing of yet another year ofcollege. I have one year left here and that is so frightening and uncertain. I don't think graduation from high school could ever have prepared me for the implications of walki11g away from college and entering medi- cal school. But for those who are to gradu- ate in the month that lies ahead, there is an even greater :sense of fear, r think. Rather, it is a much more immediate sense of appre- hension, and I am sure they are all finding ways to adequately cher- ish the days of college frivolity that are still here. I don't thi11k that I can understand what awaits them in the seemingly endless ex:panse of time that follows graduation and precedes independent security. Moreover, the seniors have to deal with saying goodbye to the cam- pus, the life, and the people that have filled their days and nights for quite a while now. After four years here, I can only imagine that they are tired. Tired from the inundation of papers, ex- a,ms, demanding professors, de- manding friends, thesis research, and sleepless nights. But I also imagine that they must be thank- ful for all those things at tile same time. For being able. to have expe- rienced the vicissitudes of <:ollege life and to have overcome it all, to be at the point where they.all are now ... weeks away from the ma- jor culmination of20-some years of experience. College reporesents a time of freedom and indepen- dence that is still mostly free of monetary responsibility (parents come in handy sometimes). Graduation means stepping up to 14, 1998 • <anmndrienshJ • that new level of adulthood and actually finding a way to succeed independently. For some, gradu- ate school still lies ahead, but that also entails a different mindset, a different atmosphere .of people, a different level of seriousness. Outside ofthe\fmancial\ aspect of post-graduation life comes the emotional issue. How people deal with leaving friends and essen- tially leaving their second home varies. It can be an exalting expe- rience to be free of the mundane pressure of college life or an aw- fully heart-wrenching experience. But whatever it is, the change rep- resents a strik·ing transition from child to adult. As much as we would like to believe that we have found some form of adulthood as college students, reality does not seriously hit until the day a di- ploma is placed in our hands. It is strange to think that after graduation, there is no more col- lege life. People that pass you qui- etly everyday in the college cen- ter or walking across the field in front of the Nott won't pass by you again. People you spent every waking moment with, scatter across the nation and find new lives, they lose their sense of flesh and presence to become phone calls and weekend trips. People that touched your life are left be- hind. Hopeful!y the memory still lingers on. I don't want to do this either. I don't want to see people leave. I understand that people walk in and out of every life, some manage to last through time, some simply exist in remembrance. But that sort of shocking alteration in the base of people who surround you is a hard thing to have to deal with. Distance separates friends physi- cally, and being unable to just have someone in front of you causes an emotional separation too. I still have my friends from high school,. they have managed to withstandthe course of time and I assume that the people who have filled my college life wilt still be there ten years from now, but I honestly don't know ifthat is are- a:lity. Nothing can stay the same, and I suppose variety adds some mea- sure of excitement to life, but I don't know ifi want that excite- ment. There is a sortofwarm com- fort in security and constancy. I guess that is why so man~ of us don't enjoy saying good-bye. Some avoid it, some run from it, some handle it calmly. I pretend that there is no such thing. I like to believe that the link between friends can last forever as long as an effort is put forth. Saying good- bye is some awful closed door that leaves only tears in its wake. It's an unnecessary social convention that makes .it alright to leave some- one behind and forget them qui- etly. So, I have decided to remove good-byes from my vocabulary. For the people I love, for the places I hold dear, t!iere will be no leaving. Maybe that is a stub- born thing for me to decide. It saves me from having to feel loss or hurt. If I choose to hold on, then no one has to leave me. It scares me too much, leaves too much of a pain at the base of my heatt to be- lieve that anyone has to walk out of the sphere of my world and never retum to it. My friends have been my support system, my laughter, my emotional world. They are here in my heart and in my mind, and holding onto them is the one thing I am sure I can do, and the one thing I have the power to control. by Heath Fradkoff creams (requiring a trip to the con- venience store both times), more severe. For the rest of us, a daily diet of delectable delay is enough to sensibly savor our san- ity. The breaks we give <lurselves lower blood pressure and allow us to breathe a little. The important thing to remember here is that the more time we spend away from our work, the more that last- minute-panic will increase. As is with all things, there needs to be a balance. Everyone wastes time. If we were to add up all the time we squander in any given day, we could prob- ably find the opportunity to do all those things that we always say we would get to if we only had the time. Yet, we savor our wasteful nature and look for almost any ex- cuse to perpetuate the co!lslimption of properly employable time. I ran into Alesia and Jon in Harvard Square a few weeks ago. They were just killing time between their classes at Mass Art. Jon's ex- cuse for not attending his earlier class was as follows: he claimed that the main facility at Mass Art was incorrectly designed. Due to a poor ventilation system, Jack of oxygen in the rooms causes severe drowsiness. Figuring that he would probably just fall asleep in class anyway, Jon saw no problem with simply taking the day off. Jon can afford to take it easy. Though still an undergraduate, Jon has been working steadily as a freelance computer programmer and graphic artist. The computer revolution has changed the graphic arts sig11ificantly and Jon has been smart enough to keep up with the advancements. His knowledge o compu~ers, along his creative talent, made him a valuable commodity even be- ·· fore his graduation. Therefore, spending the afternoon in Harvard Square wasn going to be detrimental to his well being. The rest of us, who don have those laurels to rest upon, still manage to waste an <11-tl\'rtl•C\nn here and there. Why we do it? What is difficult about ho article, in itse If, is a tes- tament to deficit of at- tention. In between the ing of the first line til this very point, I have eaten two ice ~o--.......o.~~ watched two movies, \'Tj;======;~eaten two meals, slept, written e-mail, checked voice mail, and played on-line Jeopardy. I find myselfwonder- ing1 how much more could I have accom- plished with my time if I had just written this straight out and gotten it over with. After all my excuses- \I need more time to think on it,\ \I'IJ write better ifi get some sleep,\- how much better has this turned out, if at all? Could I have written this more concisely if I had done it in one sitting? Then again, maybe all this procrastination serves a purpose. There are some people who seem to possess a god- given gift in their ability to keep themselves mov- ing constantly. In many of these cases, however, the burnout- when it comes- is much So take a little time off- but keep your eye on the clock. Be smart; make sure you waste your time wisely. Procrastination may be cited as a necessary evil, just be aware of the consequences of overindulgence. Spend your afternoon in a place like Harvard Square, but don't let life pass you by. You are still re- sponsible for your actions (so don't you dare blame me saying, \He said that putting things off is good for my health!\). As for me, well, I'm going to get this finished all in one fell swoop next week. In fact, I'm going to get it done early! Yeah that's right. As long as I'm in front of the com- puter, I'm going to start it right now ... well, maybe torn<lrrow.

To my knowledge, April is sup- posed to be the month when it rains a lot and May is supposed to be the month when it is sunny. Yet, here in Schenectady, April was just dark and cloudy, and it has been raining fur M tions, comments, or answers to my stupid questions can be sent to Box #2037. l really like get- ting mail so feel free to attempt to answer some of the questio111s that I addressed in this week's column. Until next time, stay dry and keep reading this incredible piece of literary genius. And ifyou really like my article tell the fe.atures editor Eugen Schultz. He has been feeling blue lately. Bye for With only a few weeks left in the term, I suppose I have been feeling an overwhelming sense of loss. Both for the leaving of my senior friends and the passing of yet another year of college. I have one year left here and that is so fr,ightening and uncertain. I don't think graduation from high school could ever have prepared me for the implkations of walking away from college and entering medi- cal school. But for those who are to gradu- ate in the month that lies ahead, there is an even greater sense of fear, I think. Rather, it is a much more immediate sense of appre- hension, and r am sure they are all finding ways to adequately cher- ish the days of college frivolity that are still here. I don't think that I can understand what awaits them in the seemingly endless expanse of time that follows graduation and precedes independent security. Moreover, the seniors have to deal with saying goodbye to the cam- pus, the life, and the people that have filled their days and nights for quite a while now. After four years here, I can only imagine that they are tired. Tired from the inundation of papers, ex- ams, demanding professors, de- manding friends, thesis research, and sleepless nights. But I also imagine that they must be thank- ful for all those things at the same time. For being able. to have expe- rienced the vicissitudes of college life and to have overcome it all, to be at the point where they· all are now ... weeks away from the ma- jor culmination of20-some years of experience. College represents a time of freedom and indepen- dence that is still mostly free of monetary responsibility (parents come in handy sometimes). Graduation means stepping up to May 14, 1998 • Oioncorlriensis • Page 11 that new level of adulthood aad actually finding a way to succeed independently. For some, gradu- ate school stiH lies ahead, but that also entails a different mindset, a different atmosphere of people, a different level of seriousness. Outside ofthe \financial\ aspect of post-graduation life comes the emotional issue. How people deal with leaving friends and essen- tially leaving their second home varies. It can be an exalting expe- rience to be free of the mundane pressure of college life or an aw- fully heart-wrenching experience. But whatever it is, the change rep- resents a striking transition from child to adult. As much as we would like to believe that we have found some form of adulthood as college students, reality does not seriously hit until the day a di- ploma is placed in our hands. It is strange to think that after graduation, there is no more col- lege life. People that pass you qui- etly everyday in the college cen- ter or walking across the field in front of the Nott won't pass by you again. People you spent every waking moment with, scatter across the nation and find new lives, they lose their sense of flesh and presence to become phone calls and weekend trips. People that touched your life are left be- hind. Hopefully the memory still lingers on. I don't want to do this either. I don't want to see people leave. I understand that people walk in and out of every I ife, some manage to last through time, some simply exist in remembrance. But that sort of shocking alteration in the base of people who surround you is a hard thing to have to deal with. Distance separates friends physi- cally, and being unable to just have someone in front of you causes an emotional separation too. I still have my frie11ds from high school, ~hey have managed to withstand the courseoftime and I assume that the people who have filled my college life will still be there ten years from now, but I honestly don't know iftbat is are- ality. Nothing can stay the same, and I suppose variety adds S()me mea- sure of excitement to life, but I don't know if I want that excite- ment. There is a sort of warm com- fort in security and constancy. I guess that is why so many of us don't enjoy saying good-bye. Some avoid it, some run from it, some handle it calmly. I pretend that there is no such thing. I like to believe that the link between friends can last forever as long as an effort is put forth. Saying good- bye is some awful closed door that leaves only tears in its wake. It's an unnecessary social convention that makes it alright to leave some- one behind and forget them qui- etly. So, I have decided to remove good-byes from my vocabulary. For the people I love, for the places I hold dear, there will be no leaving. Maybe that is a stub- born thing for me to decide. It saves me from having to feel loss or hurt. If I choose to hold on, then no one has to leave me. It scares me too much, leaves too much of a pain at the base of my heart to be- lieve that anyone has to walk out of the sphere of my world and never return to it. My friends have been my support system, my laughter, my emotional world. They are here in my heart and in my mind, and holding onto them is the one thing I am sure I can do, and the one thing I have the power to control. SRIIII/11111 !Jy Heath Fradkoff creams (requiring a trip to the con- venience store both times), more severe. For the rest of us, a daily diet of delectable delay is enough to sensibly savor our san- ity. The breaks we give ourselves lower blood pressure and allow us to breathe a little. The important thing to remember here is that the more time we spend away from our work, the more that last- minute-panic will increase. As is with all things, there needs to be a balance. Everyone wastes time. If we were to add up all the time we squander in any given day, we could prob- ably find the opportunity to do all those things that we always say we would get to if we only had the time. Yet, we savor our wasteful nature and look for almost any ex- cuse to perpetuate the consumption of properly employable time. I ran into Alesia and Jon in Harvard Square a few weeks ago. They were just killing time between their classes at Mass Art. Jon's ex- cuse for not attending his earlier class was as follows: he claimed that the main facility at Mass Art was incorrectly designed. Due to a poor ventilation system, lack of oxygen in the rooms causes severe drowsiness. Figuring that he would probably just fall asleep in class anyway, Jon saw no problem with simply taking the day off. Jon can afford to take it easy. Though still an undergraduate, Jon has been working steadily as a freelance computer programmer and graphic artist. The computer revolution has changed the graphic arts significantly and Jon has been smart enough to keep up with the advancements. His knowledge o computers, along with his creative talent, has . made him a valuable commodity even be- fore his graduation. Therefore, spending the afternoon in Harvard Square wasn't going to be detrimental to his well being. The rest of us, who don't have those laurels to rest upon, still manage to waste an afternoon here and there. Why do we do it? What is so difficult about holding onto motivation? This article, in itself, is a tes- tament to deficit of at- tention. In between the writ- ing of the first line un- til this very point, I have eaten two ice watched two movies, \\\======-eaten two meals, slept, written e-mail, checked voice mail, and played on-line Jeopardy. I find myself wonder- ing, how much more could I have accom- plished with my time if I had just written this straight out and gotten it over with. After all my excuses- \I need more time to think on it,\ \I'll write better if I get some sleep,\- how much better has this turned out, if at all? Could I have written this more concisely if I had done it in one sitting? Then again, maybe all this procrastination serves a purpose. There are some people who seem to possess a god- given gift in their ability to keep themselves mov- ing constantly. In many of these cases, however, the burnout- when it comes- is much So take a little time off- but keep your eye on the clock. Be smart; make sure you waste your time wisely. Procrastination may be cited as a necessary evil, just be aware of the consequences of overindulgence. Spend your afternoon in a place like Harvard Square, but don't let life pass you by. You are still re- sponsible for your actions (so don't you dare blame me saying. \He said that putting things off is good for my health!\). As for me, well, I'm going to get this finished all in one fd I swoop next week. In fact, I'm going to get it done early! Yeah that's right. As long as I'm in front of the com- puter, I'm going to start it right now ... well, maybe tomorrow.

Page 12 Deep Impact Usually, we like to open our movie reviews with a short para- graph, which sets the scene for the movie we review. This week, we would like to start with a quick story about our adventures on Friday night. After the Steinmetz dinner, we decided to see the 10:30 PM showing of Deep lmpact at Crossgates. We arrived there a little before 10:00 PM, but the show was sold out. The next showing was at 12: 15 AM, so we bought tickets for that, then wondered what to do for over two hours. All the stores in the mall were closed. Then someone remembered seeing a ferris wheel nearby. So we piled seven people into the Sable and went for it. Now, this was one of those traveling car- nivals, so you had to buy tickets for the rides. All seven of us put in $5 and bought 70 tickets, which turned out to be enough for two rides each. The first was called something like The Bobsled (by far was not worth our five tickets). Then we saw it - The Orbiter - and decided that it would be our final ride~ Bit since we had an hour to kill, we decided to peruse the rest of the carnival. Although it was a bit tempting, we kept away from the \carnies\ who wanted to lure us into their games. Everyone knows that most ofthose games are fixed. So we went back to The Orbiter, and got on it. The ride is divided into four groups of carts. The whole ride spins in a circle, then each group of cars spins in 2 circle. It is difficult to describe, so • ... . . . , .. ; . ·· .. ·; . . .: ...... ; y<~u should try it yourself. Any- way, the point of this whole tan- gent is that The Orbiter is definitely a ride that makes you very dizzy. Kudos to Jen and Meg for going 011 ittwice{they used the extra tick- ets we had) and not tossing their cookies! Although we are sure that tlley both felt like tlley were going to. Anyway ... be- fme The Screening R<~om gets put in this week's Fea- tures section, here is our review of D~ep Impact: An astronomy cl4:1ss is on a hill- side finding stars with their tele- SC<>pes, when Leo Biedennan discov- ers something in the sky which doe:s not appear to be- a star. His findings are sent to Dr. Wolf, a well known astronomer who realizes that the object is in- deed not a star, but is a comet head- ing for earth. Unable to e-mai.l his findings because the server is down, he speeds down a mountain road to bring his findings to light. Unfortunately, he is killed in a car crasih, and his findings are never mad!e public. Jenny Learner (Tea Leone) is a journalist who wants the one story that will accelerate her career to be- ingtihe anchor person for MSNBC. When she learns that the a mem- ber of President Beck's (Morgan Freeman) cabinet has resigned be- cause his wife is sick, she decided to investigate this story that ''Heaven and Earth are about to collide. Oceans rise. Cities fall. Hope survives. Obliterating at a theater near you!\ screams \Cover-Up.\ . In her investigation, she uncov- ers the name \EIIe\ and thinks that the secretary is resigning to cover up an affair the president had. When she begins to ask too many ques- tions, she i~ confronted by the presi,. dent, who promises her that the whole matter will be made public in 48 hours. Jenny learns that the name Elle is not a woman's name, but re- ally E.L.E. which.stan<ls for Extinc- tion Level Event. At the press con- ference, the president announces that the Wolf-Biede1111an comet is on a collision course witll earth. In an attempt to stop the comet, the U.S. and the Russians send a team of astronauts to try to destroy the comet with several nuclear bombs. Meanwhile back on earth, the US has built an underground for- tress which will hol<l 1,000,000 people in the event tllat the comet does hit and wipes out life on the surface. This will allow the earth to rebuild after all the du.st has settled out of the atmosphere. Of the one million people, 800,00() will be ran- domly selected to live in this for- tress .. Deep Impact is a drama/disaster movie, which focuses more on the sitting duck earthlings,. waiting to be killed by the comet, rather than focusing on the would be heros astronauts_ The movie looks at h()W the characters deal, with the fact that they that they will either be allowed survive in the , or will be left to die. Jenny Learner has been chosen derground cave. She must cope with the fact that her mother, who was not chosen because of her age, commits sui- cide. Atthe same time she attempts to understa11d her estranged father who has just married a very young girl. Also, there is a young love sub-plot as Leo Biederman must decided whether to go into the cave and survive, or stay with the girl he loves. The weig.ht upon President Beck's shoulders is that he knows tltat all his attempts to stop the comet have failed, and that the human race is looking at possible extinction. The screenplay, for tile most part, is well written. It does, how- ever, get a bithoakey in the middle, especially when a studenttells fel- low high schooler Leo Biederman that he will get a lot of sex now because he rs famous. Then there is the whole cliche about Jenny Learner's father marrying a girl half his age. Tack on the roman- tic sub-plot between Leo and his girlfriend. Then there was the whole opening sequence where Dr. Wolfdiscoversthatthecomet will hit the earth, then gets kiJied. If anyone in the audience did not see that coming, they need to get their head examined. The special effects more than made up for the deficiencies in the writing of the film. The first comet that hits the earth creates a huge tidal wave, which destroys most of the cities on the eastern seaboard. · It was pretty cool to watch the water destroy New York: City. All in all, this was a decent movie. This is definitely not a movie where you have to put a lot of effort into watching. In fact, we all were joking through the film, and we are sure that the people behind us were not too happy, but oh well, they can deal. We expectthis movie to do well until Memorial Day Weekend, when it wi II definitely get squashed by Godzilla. No mat- ter how bad this movie might be, it will be a great chance to watch New York get destroyed, Again. Rating: Matinee Price (Unless you have a kick a*s sound sys- tem in your room, then you can just rent it.) Movies at Hoyts at Crossgates are only $5 until May 14!!!!! It is a great bargain, get there and reap the benefits. Also, after watch- ing a tidal wave destroy the east- em sea board, we have decided that it may be prudent to move out west to Colorado.

Dance Program Thrills Steinmetz by Lori Greene A&E Editor This past Friday, while classes were so kindly canceled in honor of the annual Steinmetz Sympo- sium which \celebrates student creative, scholarly and research achievement,\ I took the opportu- nity to view the dance perfor- mances. Held in the Dance Studio in the Arts Building, the space packed with friends and family eagerto see the accomplishments of Union's dancers. The dance program, under the direction ofMiryam Moutillet, has had an exciting year, holding its first concert on the main stage in the Yulman Theatre. Th:is program featured students in the Dance Experience class as well as the Dance Practicum class and Independent Studies. Many of the pieces were choreographed by the students, others by Moutillet and one was a collaborative effort with a visual artist. Perhaps the most exciting aspect of the program was tihe wide variety of styles that were presented. The first performance was by last year's Villela scholar, sopho- more Jennifer Jakubowski, who danced to Chopin's \Discovery.\ The clance was delightful, it was a graceful, light and airy piece and a perfect opening to the program. J!lx1aposed with the \Discovery\ was the dark and sensuous \Primo Vere,\ composed by Carl Orff and danced by senior Sari Lei vent. This piece, choreographed by Mouti11et; was danced in classical ballet style, on toe. Next was the bright and cheerful sophomore, Jean Soutar dancing to \Rise of Sunshine,\ by The Beatles. Dressed in bright yellow, Soutar danced this modem piece in classi- cal toe. Junior Justine Willey captivated the audience with her version of \Loom\ by Bob Will and his Texas Play Boys. This piece was channing and colorful, a delight to watch. Following Willey, Leivent was back with a vengeance. This time she dancedtooneofmypersonalall time favorites, \On My Own\ from Les Miserables, composed by Claude Michel Shonberg. Thispiece proved her true talent and displayed the hard work demanded of dancers. Perhaps the most dramatic per- formance was by sophomore Joanna Tai, helped by Monet War- ren and Amanda Jackson. Tai, dressed in black with purple crepe danced to Tori Amos' \Posses- sion.\ The piece was extremely powerful anc:l ended witll Tai be- coming entangled in flesh spandex, unable to escape. For those who missed senior Carrie Madsen as Cinderella at Proctors, she, along with her part- ner, Todd Carangelo, gave an en- core perfonnace of the \Pas de Deux,\ composed by Prokofiev and choreographed by Darlene Myers. Theydanced the piece in the original Cinderella costumes and were lovely and romantic. Sophomore Mphet Warren da11ced a lyrical piece to \Holding On\ by Mariah Carey and Walter Afanosief. This highlighted Warren's flexibility and wonder- ful sense of rhythm. The finale of the program was a collaboration between Jakubowski and artist Heath Fradkoff. The piece, danced to \Big Blue Eyes\ by Big Bad Vodoo Daddy, told an entire story through stylized dance steps. The ·incredible talent of Jacubowski was enhanced by the work Fradkoff did with the set pieces, costumes, and props. Congratulations are in order to Professor Moutillet and all of the dancers on their fantastic per- formances. The audience was captivated and impressed by the strength of all of the dancers.

I I I Arts & Entertainment Olan:.carlriensis • M\'y 14, 1998 • Page 13 Marat-Sade Week 5: Acceleration and Progress Toward Completion by Alex Beckers Staff Writer With all of the play blocked, ex- cept for a few scenes that require props or parts of the stage that have not been completed yet, we took the next step in the rehearsal schedule this week. We started running rehearsals off-book. For those ofyou without theater experience, rehearsing off-book means you have your lines memo- rized, and do not ca1Ty your script around with you. The obvious meaning of this is that everyone needs to have his or her cues, lines, and blocking memorized. What may not be ob- vious is how much taking the scripts out of hand can change the energy and flow ofthe play. Not having a script in-hand al- lows the actor to become more con- nected to the scene that he or she is working in. The actor can move more freely and with more confi- dence. This, of course, is assuming that the actor does have all of his or her lines memorized. On Wednesday night we had our first off-book rehearsal of Act I, which is by far longer than the sec- ond act of the play. Many of us were nervous, still not confident that we were really ready to re- hearse without the crutch of the script in hand. If an actor does forget a line dur- ing rehearsal, he or she simply calls, \Line!\ while staying in the scene and staying in character, and a member of the production staff- usually the stage manager or as- sistant stage manager - will feed the line. However, if this happens too often during a rehearsal, con- centration drops and the rehearsal begins to drag. What surprised us all was how well our first off-book rehearsal went. Naturally, there were some sections that needed work, and a few lines were dropped, but over- all we were pleased. With two weeks until we open, we really need to be able to start hammer- ing out the real detail work- which is what we can do now that we're confident in the framework of the So there we were.

We started running rehearsals off-book. For those of you without theater experience, rehearsing off-book means you have your lines memo- rized, and do not carry your script around with you. The obvious meaning of this is that everyone needs to have his or her cues, lines, and blocking memorized. What rnay not be ob- vious is how much taking the scripts.out of hand can change the eoergy and flow ofthe play. Not having a script in-hand al- lows the actor to become more con- nected to the scene that he Qr she is working in. The ·actor can move more freely and with more confi- dence. This, of course, is assuming that the actor does have all of his or her li11es memorized. On Wednesdaynightwehadour first off-book rehearsal of Act I, which is by far longer than th.e sec- ond act of the play. Many of us were nervous, still not confident that we were really ready to re- hearse without the crutch of_ the script in hand. lf an actor does forget a line dur- ing rehearsal, he or she simply calls, \Line!\ while staying in the scene and staying in character, ana a member of the production staff- usually the stage manager or as- sistant stage manager - will feed the line. However, if this happens too often during a rehearsal, con- centration drops and the rehearsal begins to drag. What surprised us all was h0w well our first off-book rehearsal went. Naturally, there were some sections that needed work, and a few lines were dropped, but <>ver- all we were pleased. With two weeks until we open, we really need to be able to start hammer- ing out the real detail work- which is what we can do now that we're confident in the framework of the So there we were.

They seem .to enjoy the fact they're making a scene as they commandeer a place at the bar of popu Jar Albany brunch spot Quintessence. They're posing for a photo, and they thought this would be a good spot since they often spend intermis- sion from their abridged Shakespeare shows, typically staged at neighboring Valentine' s- a venue better known for musical offerings than theater-at the bar here. \When intermission is over, I have to come over to Quintessence to drag these guys outta the tap room,\ says Tom Brennan, founder of this motley crew of thespians. He has a twinkle in his eye that indicates he's downed a libation or two with his co- horts in between acts maybe just once or twice. It's clear from the antics of this trio- Brennan, Parker Cross, Vynce Montgomery- that they enjoy putting on a show, or at the very least, playing the fools. At this mo- ment. an unsuspecting couple become the foil for their silly jokery. These guys defi- nitely take that \all the world's a stage\ bit to heart. According to Brennan, 27. the Bootstrap Players officially formed in November 1996 and staged their first productkm of the two hour comedy The Complete Wor-ks Of Will- iam Shakespeare (abridged) in February (1997) at Valentine's, where Brennan also works as a bartender. The troupe, which also features three musicians, Charles Monroe, Ronald \Skip. Piper, and BiJI Bitchmann, have since per- forme.d many shows at venues such as; Mother Earth's Cafe, Eighth Step, and were the featured attraction for First Night Al- bany on New Year's Eve. They have plans to perform at summer stock in Boston and Montreal. The company's name, Bootstrap Players, was a brainstorm thought up on the eve of the first performance. \We were al!~nst sit- ting around having a beer in the back of Valentine's,\ Brennan recalls. \We had no money for costumes, we were barely hold- ing on by our bootstraps. When someone suggested as much, we figured that was as good a name as any, so it stuck.\ Brennan is happy to point out that, ever since its inauspicious beginnings, the company has been running in the black. Brennan, who spent his formative years working on the social staffofa Catskills re- sort near his childhood home in the Borscht Belt, says he's been honing his performance skills since an early age, when he was often called on to do last-minute stand-up or improv routines. While he was a student at the University at Albany earning a degree in English litera- ture, he was introduced .to the script that would later inspire him to found a theater company. \I was doing a lot of auditioning in New York and getting a lot of callbacks, but never a part,\ Brennan explains. \That's when I decided to do it on my own.\ He and a group of friends initially planned to start a theater company, butthat fizzled. A second time around, a different group .offr.iends abandoned ship. That's when Brennan decided to hold open auditions. That's how he, Cross, and Montgomery hooked up. As for the choice of material, Brennan says he was drawn to The Complete Works because of its quality. \I figur.ed if I was going to start something in Al- bany, I would start with something that was well-written,\ he says. \I studied a Jot .of medieval literature in college, and Milton doesn't read as wei! on stage.\ But Shakespeare does, especially the Ilard' s complete works as given the treat- ment by a group called the Reduced Shakespeare Co., composed of Jess Borgeson, Adam Long, Daniel Singer and J.M. Winfield, who penned the script for the play that Brennan and his troupe per- f{)nn. The show made a splash at renaissance fairs on the west coast in the early 90's :before gaining widernational recognition ctnd falling into the hands of troupes such a.s The Bootstrap Players. Tile work, which has been heralded by some as a masterpiece, offers a dose of comedy of the bawdy and broad kind. Referencing bodily functions and SEJoofing on famous lines, for instance, are not beneath its brand of humor. So audiences should not be surprised to. hear lines such as \Farting is such sweet sorrow,\ complete with the ,expected sound effects. Regarding the fact that the Bootstrap Players perform in non-traditional ven- ues, Brennan says it was a matter of ne- <:e.ssity. \It was very difficult to get iJooked into a regular theater because so m,any of them need to make out a sched- llhe so far in advance.\ he offers. \Every- aile wants nine month's notice, and for a theater company like ours, that'skind of difficult. What we do is steamer trunk reJ>\-he indicates the large suitcase and storage trunk that carry most of the cC>mpany's costumes and props. \Mak- ing things more fonnal and scheduled would sort of take away from the trampy va~abondness of theater that I think we could use more of.\ llrennan thinks performing in places wllere theater is not typically staged does have its advantages, though. \Sure S()me patrons aren't thrilled with the at- nl{)Sphere in non-traditional spaces,\ he says, \but this play works so well any time you're in a place where you can draw people close to you.\ But beware: Brennan warns that be- ca!Ise of how the script is written, there's plertty of room for improvisati()n, so all hecklers will be dealt with acC()rdingly. Til is is serious stuff, after all, as Brennan w illremind all comers: \Hey nobody in- terferes with our mission: to spread the w<lrd of the Bard to the masses.\ The Bootstrap Players will be perfotm- ing this Sunday, May 17 at 7:00PM on the College Center patio.

While he was a student at the University at Albany earning a degree in English litera- ture, he was introduced to the script that would later inspire him to found a theater company. \I was doing a lot of auditioning in New York and getting a lot of callbacks, but never a part,\ Brennan explains. \That's when I decided to do it on my own.\ He and a group of friends initially planned to statt a theater company, but that fizzled. A second time around, a different group of friends abandoned ship. That's when Brennan decided to hold open auditions. That's how he, Cross, and Montgomery hooked up. As for the choice of material, Brennan says he was drawn to The Complete Works because of its quality. \I figured if I was going to start something in Al- bany, I would start with something that was well-written,\ he says. \I studied a lot ofmedievall.iteratl:lre in college, and Milton doesn't read as well on stage.\ But Shakespeare does, especially the Bard's complete works as given the treat- ment by a groNp called the Reduced Shakespeare Co., composed of Jess Borgeson, Adam Long, Daniel Singer and J.M. Winfield, who penned the script for the play that Brennan and his troupe per- form. The show made a splash at renaissance fairs on the west coast in the early 90's before gaining wider national recognition and falling into the hands of troupes such as The Bootstrap Players. The work, which has been heralded by some as a masterpiece, offers a dose of comedy of the bawdy and broad kind. Referencing bodily functions and spoofing on famous lines, for instance, are not beneath its brand of humor. So audiences should not be surprised to hear lines such as \Farting is such sweet sorrow,\ complete with the expected sound effects. Regarding the fact that the Bootstrap Players perform in non-traditional ven- ues, Brennan says it was a matter of ne- cessity. \It was very difficult to get booked into a regular theater because so many of them need to make out a sched- ule so far in advance,\ he offers. \Every- one wants nine month's notice, and for a theater company like ours, that's kind of difficult. What vve do is steamer trunk rep\-he indicates the large suitcase and storage trunk that carry most of the company's costumes and props. \Mak- ing things more formal and scheduled would sort of take away from the trampy vagabondness of theater that I think we could use more of.\ Brennan thinks perfonning in places where theater is not typically staged does have its advantages, though. \Sure some patrons aren't thrilled with the at- mosphere in non-traditional spaces,\ he says, \but this play works so well any time you're in a place where you can draw people close to you.\ But beware: Brennan warns that be- cause of how the script is written, there's plenty of room for improvisation, so all hecklers will be dealt with accordingly. This is serious stuff, after all, as Brennan will remind all comers: \Hey nobody in- terferes with our mission: to spread the word of the Bard to the masses.\ The Bootstrap Players will be perform- ing this Sunday, May 17 at 7:00PM on the College Center patio. Admission is free along with food and drink. Also ap- pearing are musical guests THE GRIM ORCHESTRA and The Full Montelles, the music starts at 3:00 PM.

• fCiinpus News TWorld Views Middle East Peace Negotiations by Heather Clements Contributing Writer \In the Middle East, ifanybody loses, nobody wins, and if any- body wins, everybody loses.\ This quote by William Safrre reflects the difficult task that United States Secretary of State, Made line Albright, and head diplomatic ne- gotiator to Israel, Dennis Ross, will face in the coming weeks as they negotiate for peaceful settlements between Israel and Palestine. Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, pressured by the United States to revive the stalled peace negotiations, agreed to cede 9% of the West Bank to Palestine within 12 weeks. Israel consented to ceding an additional 4% ofthe West Bank to Palestine at the discretion of the United States. In exchange, Pales- tine agreed to crackdown on mili- tants, curb hostile propaganda, and remove parts of its covenant that call for the destruction ofis- rael. These agreements represent an extension of the Madrid peace talksof1991 and the Oslo Accords of 1993. The United States has been instrumental in these nego- tiations which call for Israel to cede certain lands in the West Bank and Gaza in exchange for Palestinian concessions to end the violence and terror which have pitted Jews against Arabs in the Middle East for centuries. As Israel celebrated its 50th an- niversary, the nation remained po- litically divided. Netanyahu 's Cabi- net member, Ariel Sharon, argued that ceding more than 9% of the West Bank to Palestine would rep- resent a security threat to Israel. However, many Israelis remem- ber the dream of the assassinated Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, to bring about peace even if it meant land concessions. At one time, Rabin acknowledged that Israel should cede beyond 13% of the West Bank. As the jubilation ofthe 50th an- niversary celebration lingered in the streets of Israel, the legacy of Rabin was remembered. As the co-recipient of the 1994 West Bank Players: (Clockwise from Top Left) President Clintion, Israel Prime Minister Ben- jamin Netanyahu, PLO President Yasir Arafat, Secretary of State Madeline Albri::ght, and U.S. Middle East Envoy Dennis Ross. All photos Courtesy of CNN. Nobel Peace Prize, along with Yas:ser Atafat, Rabin embodieq the hop-es of a .new generation that pea~e settlements could be reached through diplomatic nego- tiations. However, it remains uncertain how mueh territory will actually be cede:d in the West Bank. Also, it is unclear whether the Palestinians will curb the violence that has made Israel a battleground. However, the United States, along with the United Nations, is optimistic that by the end of May the new diplomatic agreements will begi~ to take effect. NATO Expansion Adds Three More Countries by Adam-Paul Smolak and Heather Clements Contributing Writers The United States Senate has approved the expansion of the North American Treaty Organiza- tion (NATO) to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic by a vote of80-19. W hi I e and many European leaders hailed the expansion as a way t 0 strengthen European unity and promote peace, Russian leaders de- nounced the plan as an attempt by democratic nations to isolate Rus- sia. Opponents ofthe expansion cite the threat of Russia enlarging its military and nuclear arsenal, as well as violating the provisions of the START II treaty. Moreover, an ex- panding NATO undermines the credibility of the newly established Russian democracy because it\stra- tegically imposes a westernized military alliance in neighboring states. This imposition allows national- ists to mobi- lize support against west- em influence that could di- Yeltsin led government. Also, op- ponents fear that Russia will ally with China and Iran creating a cen- tral division between eastern atnd United States claim that the cost of expansion is not only unknown, but too high, as estimates range from $1.5 to $125 billion within the western states. next 1 0 years.

' milittryunity among European de- mocracies. Although each mem- ber nation must approve the expan- sion for Poland, Hungary,. and the Czecfu Republic to be admitted, there is a strong consensus among member nations that enlarging NATO will strengthen the alliance. NATO was originally founded in 1949 to counteract the Soviet Unioll' s alliances. Currently it has 16 members; they are Belgium, Denmark, France; Germany, Greece, Itay, Luxembourg, the Netherl~lllds, Portugal, Spain, the United King- dom, Iceland, Norway, Turkey, Cana<la, and the United States. · It is anticipated that the current NATO nations will quickly approve the' ex::pansion and, by April 24, 1999, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic will be fully inte-- grated into NATO~ The United States is hopeful that a unified NATO will eventually be able to maintain peace and stability in a region plagued by massive conflict. Finally President Clinton called NATO expansion \a big deal\ and said it means \your children li]5ely will ne-ver have to go there(Europe) a war.\

Highlighting the afternoon and earl~ evening competition was senior Julie Barton. Barton, fresh off of her eight p'iace 5:02.26 performace in the 15()0In at the state championships last V/eeke·nd, followed this performance with a record breaking run. Running in deliberate fashion over the 3 3/4 lap race, Barton crusied through the first lap in 1 : 16; secoilld lap in 1:18, for a 2:34 half mile time~ Although Barton slowed down over the third lap, running a l :22, Barton ran a tenacious final 300m in 1:00 to finish in 4:56.80. This time broke the school record time of5:01.34 by Lynne Erdman which had stood since I 989. Also competing was junior c0- captain Katie MacDowell in the 1500. MacDoweH ran a four tenths 0f a second slower thau her State performance. MacDowell ran a 5:24.50. Junior Peter Flynn was the lone competitior for the men's team. Flynn, competing in the 800m for the first time thisseason, ran 2:0 l. Track Notes: Some members of the squad wi:U compete at RPI to- morrow. Look for profiles onPeter Flynn and Dennis Sanabia the next twoweeks. Intramural Ecstasy by David Weiner Sports .Writer I will venture to make the gener- aJ,i~ation that throughout high scno()l, the majority of people par- ticipate in some type of sport. Whetller it be baseball, hockey, footlmll, lacrosse, ballet, or a myriad of other possibilities, people took part in some type of tearn sport. However, college is quite differ- ent !man high school. At the col- lege le-'Vel, only the cream of high scho()l a~bJ~te.~ .. hav.e the .c,lbility to contiin u e their athletic careers. Wllil e it may be the aspiration of ma!ly to continue with athletics, unfortunately not everyone pos- sesses the talent to do so. For these people, their saving gra<:e is the intramural athletics. This seems to be the perfect re- plai:ement for the team sports ma11y college students so desper- ately miss. The hard work and mGI1otony of practice is eliminated anc! o11ce a week for five or six weelcs each term, various teams competing in a variety of sports congregate and compete. While the c:0mpetition may not be as fier-ce as Division I or Division III co!Hege athletics, it is competition no111etheless and is competition in a non competitive environment that alhws everyone to relax and have a go()!d time. If a person does compete on a colle~e level team, chances are they can only participate in one spon for each sport seemingly has year·r()und training. However, for those people who play intramurals, you can not only participate in a number of sports throughout the year, but you can play a number of sports within each terrr1. It is quite possible to fill each night of your week with a different intramural contest in a different sport each night. This is the beauty of intramurals. Think about it. It is possible to play soccer and f()ot- ball in the fall, hockey, broomball, and basketball in the winter, and ultimate frisbee, softball, at:td la- crosse in the spring. That is eight sports as opposed to one, all with- out the hassle of practice but with alhhe enjoyment ofplaying games and having fun. What more could a per$PU askJor? . Currently, I am part of an intra- mural softball team with my FIJI pledge class. The range of talent on this team varies from high schoel baseball team captains to people who have never swung a bat before, but the experience of playing together and having fun regardless of whether we win or lose exemplifies the justice that in- tramural sports bring to college. These games provide us, and other participants the opportunity t() have fun together, get some exer- cise, and still enjoy the feeling of competition we all once loved in high school. Were it not for intramurals, there would even less to do on college campuses. These sports allow students a break from their books and are the perfect opportunity to socialize and relax. For those people who love to play sports but just don't have the talent to play in college or for the person who just wants to have fun, intramurals are the perfect mix of competition and relaxation that add a beautiful dimension to what might become a monotonous col- legelife. Wood Makes Instant Name For Himself After four major league starts with the Cubs, Kerry Wood was a little known rookie with a 2-2 record. Then the Astros came to town, he struck out twenty of them, tying Roger Clemens' major league record, and he .is now being compared to Nolan Ryan. Wood, who is ()nly 20, pitched a masterfu I game. While al:lowing only one hit, his fastball was clocked at 100 mph and he had a nasty slider which made Astra hitters look fool ish. Clemens was quick to congratu.Jate Wood on tying his stikeout mark. \I think it's awesome,\ Clemens said. He added, \He had really unhittable stuff. [t looked great from what I saw.\ Astros manager Larry Dierker could not resist the Ryan comparison, \He remi.nded me of the first time I saw Ryan. By the time the ball left his hand, it was in the mitt. Only that time, Ryan was wild. This kid wasn't wild.\ At the age of 20, Wood will now have tremendous expectations following him around. However, despite his dominating performance, comparisons to Ryan are a little premature. Wood, had never pitched a complete game in the minors or majors before his last outing. The potential was there, but the performances. were not. One great outing does not mean Wood will have a Hall of Fame career. Astro second baseman , Craig Biggio, also seemed to down play the significance of the outing, \It's not fair to compare him to Nolan. The kid's got good stuff, but leave comparisons alone. Today was his day. He had everything working. Plus it was the first time we faced him.\ With the disappointing start that Cleveland Indians pitcher Jaret Wright has endured, it is hard not to share Biggio's thoughts. Wright, also 20, was inhuman in Cleveland's playoff run last year, but has gotten knocked around by everybody so far this season. However, if Wood continues to perform like he did against the Astros, he will not be sharing the strikeout mark with Clemens for too long. Mets Manage to Keep on Winning Despite Constant Trips to tile DL the league. The staff, anchored by starters AI Leiter and Bobby Jones, along with a bullpen which boasts Greg McMichael, Mel Rojas, and John Franco, would be able to keep them in ball games, but they would need the Mets hitters to generate some run support. In the off season, GM Steve Phill-ips failed to bring in the power hitter the Mets so desperately needed. As a result, the Mets knew they would have to play smart baseball and score runs any way they could. However, what they were not prepared for was the ten significant players who are currently residing on the disabled list. The Mets began the season much like last year ended. They won games with solid pitching and scrappy hitting Then Bernard Gilkey went on the DL with a stress fracture in his elbow and the rest ofthe team soon followed. Catcher Tim Spehr, the replacement for All-Star Todd Hundley, had filled in adequately until he broke his Vlrist on a play at the plate. Todd Pratt was called up from the minors the next day, drove in six runs in two games, then was diagnosed with nerve palsy and placed on the DL. The Mets had just as much success replacing injured third baseman Edgardo Alfonzo. After playing only two games for the injured A lfonzo, Craig Paquette sprained his ankle n.mn ing out a grounder. That same game reliever Rojas pulled a muscle when he sneezed in the bullpen, he was I is ted as day to day. Despite the Mets horrid string of injuries they have continued to win. With a make-shift .lineup the Mets have won their last four games, and are getting contributions from areas they would have never thought possible on opening day. Ifthe Mets can outlast this injury plagued period, anytlling is possible, they might even catch the Braves. A fterall, did Rojas think it was possible to pull a muscle while sneezing? Playerofthe Week: Michael Tucker OF Atlanta Braves Tucker has to be one of the streakiest players in baseball. After a horrid start to the season, Tucker caught fire last week and hit six homers over a period of fifteen at bats. Ofhis last sixteen hits, eight have been doubles, while six have The Mets came into the season been home runs. Tucker brought with mixed reviews. It was not his average back around .300 and debated that they possessed one helped the Braves extend their lead of the strongest pitching staffs in in the NL East to five game~.

PagelS • May 14, 1998 • Qloncm:hi.eusis Sports ng it: Bet:t:er? by Cluistopher G. Leone Etfitor-in-CIIief Is it possible to make the New York Yankees even better? At the end of SunJay, the Bronx bombers held a five game lead in the all important loss column over the Boston Red Sox and were the only team left in the majors with single digit losses. So why even worry about making changes? Because Yankee owner George Steinbrenner is an egomaniac and Patrick Ewing eating up back page tabloid space is not good f()r the boss. Despite the current success, there should be changes coming soon in the Bronx Zoo. Orlando Hernandez, the Cuban defector turned Steinbrenner project, is tearing up the minor leagues and the right hander appears headed for an early June date at the stadium. The boss has never been known to keep his high profile acquisitions in the shadows. Just look back to last season and Hideki Irabu .jf your memory fails. David Cone, David Wells, Andy Petite, and lrabu have all pitched brilliantly, so that leaves Ramiro Mendoza moving to join a bullpen that is almost automatic fi·om the seventh inning on. The stability of the pen also would mean that someone, from somewhere would need to leave New York to make room for Hernandez. The question of who gets traded where is any one person's guess. One thing is for sure when dealing with the psychosis of Steinbrenner ... A trade would sure to be a blockbuster and would have to put the boss on the back page for at least a week. Bernie Williams, who has refused to sign a long term deal, would be prime trade bait for the boss. Williams has struggled this year and could be traded to a National League team in need of a proven commodity. Williams could fetch a couple of outfield prospects that could sure up the Yankees for five to ten years. Looking through the rosters, the lack of outfield prospects is the only feature keeping the Yankees from turning into a dynasty. Ricky Ledee is in the minors waiting to come up and serve as a platoon player until groomed to start. Outside of Ledee, there are no hot outfield prospects in the Yankee system. Currently the Yankees have Chad Curtis, Tim Raines, and a resurging 36- year-old Darryl Strawberry, platooning left field and the designated hitter spots. Curtis, who came over last year from Cleveland for David Weathers, looks to be a great acquisition and could be an everyday player for at least five more years. Raines is 3 8 and in the final year of a contract in what should be his last season in the show. Paul O'Neill is currently discussing a contract extension, but age and injuries will eventually limit his effectiveness. If you look at the Yankees there is 110 need for other position players. Scott Brosius at third is playing well, but probably will be replaced by minor league standout Mike Lowell. Homer Bush is a solid infield back-up behind Chuck Knoblauch and Derek Jeter. Meanwhile, Tino Martinez is signed for two more years with extension negotiations expected this off-season. The Yankee pitchers are well stocked for the millennium. Start with the young Petite and Mendoza, and then go right to the late twenty year-old lrabu, Wells, and Hernandez. This might not be the Braves, but it is just as good in the American League. Stein. brenner could use his ego to build this team into a legendary club. Williams is good, but not the ten million a year player his agent claims. A trade now wou:ld help the Yankees secure the future. Yes, without Williams this team might not win the 120+ games they are currently on pace to win, but a 100 games should still be guaranteed .. When I was a child my father told me about a time when he was younger when the Yankee's apeared in 14 of 16 World Series. In that streak from 1949 to 1964 there were nine world championship banners ho.isted in the \House that Ruth Built.\ H would be nice to write about that kind of dominance in my lifetime. * * * * * It was great to pick up the papers last week and see that Spike Lee's new movie, He Got Game, was number one at the box office.

Ricky Ledee is in the minors waiting to come up and serve as a platoon player until groomed to start. Outside of Ledee, there are no hot outfield prospects in the Yankee system. Currently the Yankees have Chad Curtis, Tim Raines, and a resurging 36- year-old Darryl Strawberry, platooning left field and the designated hitter spots. Curtis, who came over last year from Cleveland for David Weathers, looks to be a great acquisition and could be an everyday player for at least five more years. Raines is 38 and in the final year of a contract in what should be his last season in the show. Paul O'Neill is currently discussing a contract extension, but age and injuries will eventually limit his effectiveness. If you look at the Yankees there is no need for other position players. Scott Brosius at third is playing well, but probably will be replaced by minor league standout Mike Lowell Homer B.ush is a solid infield back-up behind Chuck Knoblauch and Derek Jeter. Meimwhi!le, Tino Martinez is signed for two more years with exteHsion negotiations expected this off-season. The Yankee pitchers are well stocked for the millennium. Start with the young Petite and Mendoza, and then go right to the latetwenty year-old Irabu, Wells, and Hernandez. This might not be the Braves, but it is just as good in the American League. Steinbrenner could use his ego to build this team into a legendary club. Williams is good, but not the ten million a year player his agent claims. A trade now would help the Yankees secure the future. Yes, without Williams this team might not win the 120+ games they at:e currently on pace to win, hut a I 00 games should still be guaranteed. When I was a child my father told me ab()ut a time when he was y<mnger when the Yankee's apeared in 14 of 16 World Series. In that streak from 1949 to 1964 there were nine world cllampionship banners hoisted in the \House that Ruth Built.\ It would be nice to write about that kind of dominance in my lifetime. * * * * \* H was great to pick up the papers last week and see that Spike Lee's new movie, He Got Game, was number one at the box office. Some students may remember when Lee came and spoke at Memorial Chapel and was rudely treated by a member of this campus. Those peoplemight learn something about life by seeing the new film. Remember \it is the will ofthe man. not the skill of the man.\ \* * * * * No real need to make major changes in the weekly baseball power rankings. I think we all know who is the best team in baseball. l. New York Yankees 2. Atlanta Braves 3. Texas Rangers 4. San Diego Padres 4.

News: Ac(laimed concert pi~nist abruptly pauses during performance at Union Page3 News: Union College motto remains despite controversy over content PageS by Brooke Barylick Staff Writer Was a conclusion reached? It is difficult to discern. Last Wednesday, May 13, a Crosstalk was held in the Reamer Campus Center Auditorium by Alpha Delta Phi. Thepurposeofthis forutn was to invite student and faculty to hear arguments and concerns dealing with the Master Plan. The panel consisted of Dean Alford, Diane Blake, Vice President ofFi- nance and Administration; a graduate of the Class of 1986 and President Hull who defended the Master Plan.

Dave Meguerdichian/ TC as well as the best faculty. The Admis- sions office plays a cru- cial role in this process. The conclu· sion that a new admis- sions build- ing was needed de- veloped after the commit- tee conferred with the ad- missions staff, exam- ined the ad- missions fa- cilities of other com- petitive President HuJI and pane/listen to audience's outcry over AD Phi's future this month, in which he stated that admissions were great this year. Laible questioned why a newadmis- siolls building was need-ed if adrnis- siolls appeared to be flourishing. A few comments wer;e made by the audience questionillg the valid- ity ()fthe Master Plan that President Hull cbose to address. He informed the crowded auditorium of the un- derlying purpose of the Master Plan.lt is needed to prevent unnec- essary costs and renevations. He referred to Fero House as an ex- ample. President Hull explained that since Beta Theta Pi's removal from that location it has been used many different ways, each one requiring renovations and changes from the previous occupant. A committee was created to oversee the creation of the Master Plan. It consisted of two administrators, four faculty members and three students. They collaborated with a Boston plan- ning firm and prodllced the Mas- terPlan. schools. and asked consulting firms what the best avenue would be. The committee analyzed the campus and decided that ADPhi was indeed large enough and the ideallocati()n for the overcrowded admissions staff. Both the brothers and members of the administration expressed their arguments concerning the Master Plan.

Many otlJer comments and ques- tions were raised during the event. Some of these led to personal at- tacks and others led to heated dis- cussion among members of the panel. It is obvious that this issue is an emoti()nal one. by Roberto Rodriguez Staff Writer For over two and a half years, the brothers of the Eta Chapter of Phi Iota Alpha Fraternity, Inc~ and some faculty of Union College nave struggled to get the Latin American Component accepted into the Freshmen PreceptoriaL Dean Lewis has been an instru- mental person in getting Latin American Literature aq:epted. Pro- fessor Vicki Martinez of the Mod- ern Languages Department as well as Professor Meade and Professor A.T. Miller ofthe History Depart- ment have been an integral com- ponents in presenting the Latin American package to the Precep~ torial committee. The Professors have titled the section ofthe Latin American Preceptorial \Cultural Encounters.\ The focus of the readings will broaden the students' understand- ing of social and ecological ques- tions that began with the first en- counter between the European and indigenous cultures in the West- ern Hemisphere. The \encounter\ entails 500 years of history, writ- ing and interaction between Eu- rope, the United States, and Latin America as a whole which also in- cludes the Caribbean. Considering the fact that the entire campus has spent a month discussing race, it seems amazing that a class required of all Union students does not have anything from the rest of the Ameri- cas. The package includes readings designed to increase the under- standing of the Spanish and Por- tuguese speaking Americas. It also includes excerpts from the Span- ish conquest to give students a background in the origins .of cul- ture and conflict in South, Central, North Americas, and the Carib- bean. There are articles that ex- plain religious beliefs, but practices demonstrate ways in which indig- enous and African religions are a part of countries in which the es- tablished religion is Roman Ca- tholicism. There are readings that have beensuggested.for inclusion in ex- isting packets for the reading for Fresllmen Preceptorial. A reading that fits in the \Belief and Unbe- lief' section of the Preceptorial packet is \Response to Sor Filotea,\ a le1ter to the bishop by <me ofthe greatest female writer of the 17th century, Sor Juana Ines,de Ia Cruz (Mexico, 1648~ 1695). Ac- claimed for her indigenous and pro- lific production of poetry, this 17th century nun also dabbled in sci- ence, philosophy, and theology. She achieved a great deal of fame during her time in Spain and in Me:xcico. Thistext fits well into is- suesoffaith and the politics ofthe Catholic hierarchy in the 17th cen- tury, but it also makes a strong femi- nist argument defending the right of women to participate in the world arena. This is the only read- ing by a woman in any of the texts before the 20th century. Another suggestion for the \'Ge- nealogy of Freedom\ is \How to Read Donald Duck\ by Chilean writer Ariel Dorfinan. This is a good addendum to any study of Marx and Marxist ideas. Dorfman uses the Disney image of Donald Duck as the icon of American capitalist exploitation of Latin American. Also, \The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo: An important document.\ This treaty between the United States and Mexico after the war of 1848 can be used to foment dis- cussion about the issues on \En- glish Only\ and immigration. This package would also include the novel The Chronicle of a Death Foretold by Nobel Prize winning author Gabriel Garcia Marquez. This complements the slave texts. The novel weaves an intricate web of issues of contem- porary Latin America, like the mili- tary, religion, and the hierarchy of social class and race. Additionally, the novel raises the question of historical perspective and the ways in which events are written. In this respect, it opens discussion for critical thinking and the fact that new events and histo- ries contai11 incorrect and biased informatio11. Also, GarcfaMarquez honed to perfection the narrative style referred to as \magical real- ism,\ a tecltnique imitated by some ofthe most famous American au- thors like Toni Morrison. Following this text is \Our America\ by Cuban writer Jose . Martf. This essay describes the desire on tile part of Cuba, and for that matter, nations of the Carib- bean to look to the United States as the on'ly model for government . and economy. This 'essay by the . celebrated poet opens discussion of the ongoing political conflicts between Latin America and the . u.s.

He is perhaps most known for his attaining First Place in the renowned Tchaikovsky Piano Competition at the tender age of16. The brilliance ofhis 90-minute performance, however, was over- shadowed by two minutes of over- whelming silence. Although Sokolov's audience walked away from Memorial Chapel in awe of his insightful musical technique, many could not forget the jarring silence that fell in the midst of Beethoven's Sonata No.l6. This silence was prompted by the preponderance of loud mu- sic and background noise from the Chapel's surrounding fraternities. Sokolov paused for two minutes between the first and second move- ments of the Beethoven.

Since the publication of that work in 1958, it has been translated into- 25 languages and millions .of copies have been sold to date. were highlighted to emphasize the Asian theme. .The clothes were gorgeous and the moves suave all . around. This fashion show was an ex- ample of students on this campus uniting to support cultural diver- sity on campus. According to Christine Myo, \ASU and Shakti are both groups that try to increase intra-racialcultural Wlity, while pro.. · moting interracial cultural aware- ness and harmony. We tried this y.ear to get as many Asians in- volved as possible to increase the sense of Asian pride and as many different people of all races, back- grounds a_nd interest so that there could he an event outside of classes that we could all enjoy. Even professors had a chance to break their professional barriers and become friends.\ 'Fhe show was about more than just the clothing. It was about the cultures behind these costumes and how important this is to enjoy .. ·upperclass Dining was alive and ·going strong with the sounds and visions oftraditional, cultural Asia. The entertainment value on Satur- day night was high as everyone . enjoyed th!; dancing, the music and most importantly, the clothes. After all, that is ideally, what a fashion show is about. The mod- els, many wearing clothing their parents or grandparents had once worn, were excited to show off their culture. Other models who have no familiar relationship to the Asian culture were just as excited to be wearing the beautiful. and ornate clothing and to be involved in one of the most fantastic campus . events this year. His experiences concerning the Holocaust have impassioned him · to achieve the majority of the afore- mentioned accomplishments. The Nazis sent Wiesel and his family to Auschwitz when he was only 15. Both his mother and sister died there while his two older sisters left alive. Wiesel and his father were later moved to Buchenwald, where his father perished. His visit to the Union College Campus will be met with much an- ticipation and is sure to elicit a large portion of the student body. · Tickets to Wiesel's lecture are free of charge and can be picked up by students (one per student), throqgh this Friday afternoon in the office of central scheduling in · mom 404C in the college center during normal business hours. A limited number of tickets are avail- able to faculty, through the. President's Office.

The festival, which was sponsored by the Eta Chapter of Phi Iota Alpha & His- panic Outreach Services of· Schenectady drew over 100 Schenectady residents and about 50 Union College students. The therrie of the festival, \Siempre Se PuedeMas\ (You can always do more}, is a message to both the Schenectady and Union College communities. Roberto Rodriguez said, \We want the people of Schenectady to under- stand that they have the potential to do much more with their Ji:ves. We don't want them to settle for anything less than the best. We (the brothers) came from very simi- lar backgrounds, if we cando it, so can they. We also feel that the Union College community can do a lot more for Schenectady. We (Union College) have so many re- sources but we don't do enough for Schenectady.\ A unique aspect of the Festival was its location in Hamilton Hill. Fraternity Vice- President Greg VanHolt said, \Everyone knows · that Union College is a greatplace, but we wanted the locals to feel the same way about their own com-\ munity. People need to realize that not only is Union is a part of Schenectady, but Schenectady is a part of Union. Tile event would not have been as memorable had it been held at Union.\ Sophomore George Powers added, \I'm glad that it was held in the middle of Hamilton Hill. I had never actually been in Schenectady before today. ldidn 't know what it was like.\ The day included a surprise ap- pearance of\.Felix the FiotaUon\ whowas swarmed hy the children when he arrived to give away bal- loons. \It was a gFeat event. I was happy ,to see so many people hav- ingsuch a good time: Everyone had a lot of fun, not just the kids but the adults too. It was good for the whole family,\ said freshman Kempton Rollins. Oth·er festivities included a dance contest, face painting, free games and prizes for children, Latin American food, and the Latin Rhythms of WRUC DJ's Jose Vargas and David Torres. Fresh- man Doni Johnson said, \This was one of the best events that I have attended while here at Union. Be- fore, I did not like Salsa and Me- rengue, but after hearing it a11 day, I cant stop moving when I hear it.\ The booming music, heard ftom several blocks away, was one of the reasons the event attracted over 100 Hamilton Hill residents. Education was also a priority in the event. The League ofWornen Voters was presentto register vot- erswhile Capitol District Child Care introduced parents to affordable child care. Union College Admis- sions Officer, DarrylTiggle, arrived to recruit some of the talented young students of Schenectady. The brothers of Phi Iota Alpha are looking forward to next year. Fraternity President Asian Kanshaw said, \I can't wait until next year! Although things went well, there are so many things that we can improve on. Next years fes- tival will be even bigger and bet- ter!'' Nilda Giraldi, director of His- panic Outreach Services, added, \This [festival] is great. I hope that it becomes an annual event.\ The brothers ofthe Eta Chapter of Phi Iota Alpha Fraternity would like to congratulate Dave Doser. He won the CD player which was raffled to raise money for the Jose Marti Scholarship. Over $250 was raised towards the Scholarship; it will be given to an incoming stu- dent (Class of 2003) who shows a strong knowledge ofLatin Ameri- can culture and/or issues. Finally, the brothers would like to thank the following organiza- tions for their financial contribu- tions and participation in the festi- val. The event would not have been possible without their help: A.L.A.S., B.E.

Changing the College Motto by Jim DeWan News Editor On April 25, 1998, the Alumni Council voted to take no further action to alter the college's motto to replace the wordjreres, French for brother, with unis, French for united, to make the motto gender neutral. This comes after a long campaign by the Womyn's Union and mainly, Courtney Feeley '99. Feeley was referred to the council by the administration when slle ap- proached them. The Alumni Coun- cil acted on the recommendation of an ad hoc committee created by the council to deliberate the pro- posal. Joe Zolner '76, Director of the GMI, headed the committee. The committee solicited re- sponses by placing ads in the Union College magazine. the monthly alumni newsletter, and Concordiensis. Feeley felt thatthis .. was an unfair way to solicit re- sponses. \All you're going to get is a negative response,\ she said. The majority of the responses came from alumni. On Jy about three ot four responses resulted from the announcement in Concordiensis, Zolner estimated. He then photo- copied all the responses and mailed them to committee members. They ·then met· and made their decision. Feeley presented her proposal to the committee on April 11, 1997, consisting of her mission state- . ment and documentation from Pr<r- fessors Leamon and Thomas, French professors. They dis- cussed the technicalities of the French language and documented the substitution of unis for freres was, '\the only grammatically c<Jr- rectly adjectiVe that will convey the same idea.\ It was also accompa- nied by a signed statement from the two student trustees and two faculty trustees endorsing the pro- posal, and another endorsed l:ly nearly every major student organi- zation on campus, along with a signed endorsement from Kathleen Buckley, the Protestant Chaplai:n. Feeley didn't base her plan com- pletely on a feminist argument. She also intended to raise awareness of the motto on campus. In its recommendation, the com- mittee ensured that their decision was not a statement against \po- litical correctness,\ and offered a brief explanation. When the motto was originally adopted in 1796, it was written in French as a \state- ment by the college to interpret al- ternate points of view,;' according to Zolner. \It wasn't that the C()l- lege had it wrong,\ he continued, \it's representin~ the exact same issues and concerns that Courtney included in her proposal.\ The situation was further wm- plicated because Feeley has not been on campus this year. She was on a tenn abroad in Brazil this past fall and left campus this winter be- cause of a death in the family. This term she is t~rm abroad in Wash- ington, D.C. She was completely unaware that the decision was go· ing to be made this spring. Some- where along the line, there was a mix-llp betweenZolnerand Feeley as to when the decision was to be made.. Zolner claims that he e- mailed Feeley on February 2, 1998, while Feeley claims to have re- ceived no such email. \I would have made plans to come back to Union,\ she responded when asked ifshehadheard from Zolner. Furthermore, no representatives from the Alumni Council contacted Feeley after her proposal was re~ jected at the April25 meeting. In fact, when she was contacted by Concordiensis, it was the first news she had learned of the vote. As of press time, she had not been provided with the report from Zolner' s committee, although Zolner assured Concordiensis that it would be provided to her. \It would have been an appropriate courtesy to contact her,\ Zolner regretted. Joseph Mammola, Vice President of Alumni Relations, could offer no explanation as to why Feeley was not contacted. \It was not intended as a discourtesy. No one intended to slight her. I guess it just fell tllrough the cracks,\ Mammolasaid. Feeley's campaign was not the first since Union became co-edu- cational in 1970 to revise the motto. When President I lull was inaugu- rated, he mentioned it in his speech, but has been reluctant to take up the issue. \I'll support you, but I won't take the lead on it,\ re- ported Hull when asked his re- sponse to Feeley's and previous proposals. Hull, too, noted the dif- ficulty Qf the situation because of Feeley's absence. Feeley was, of course, upset with decision and the fact that she wasn't notified. How- ever, when she returns to campus in the fall, she plans to take up the issue once again.

It is important that the students know that I do not make . assumptions about people or renounce opinions made by anyone. One of my most re- deeming qualities is that of a good listener. Those of you who already know who I am understand how important it is for me to empathetically listen without judging. I am also excellent at observing situations and interpreting anger and discomfort, as well as happi- ness and excitement from others. If chosen to be on the Student Forum, I will strive to go furthertomeettheneeds ofthe class of2001. I knowhow to make my voice heard and wiU not back down from what our class deems significant. I anxiously await the chance to immerse myselfinto a position within the school which will enable me to make a difference on behalf ofthe students.

Mynarne is David Weiner and I want to be the person representiqgyour voice on the Student Forum next year: I feel that the students on this campus have the power to make things happen and that if we, the student community, see a problem, we must do whatever it takes to correct t!tat problem. In order to achieve this goal, tile lines of commu- . nication between the student body and the administration must be opened.

While I have worked hard on behalf of our class and promoted our interests on Haig Goudsouzian Sophomore Class Representative I, Haig Goudsouzian, am running for-Sophomore Representative and feel I am the best man to do the job. I arn not going to bore you with rubbish about wlutclubs I've been in or what organizations I belong to. Rather I am going to tell you what I plan to do to make Union college a better place for everyone, and especially you. In my eyes, it is a simple decision. Who is best equipped to understand the student bodies needs, someone locked up in meetings all day, or someone who is at all the major social functions fraternizing with the student body? I understand what the average student wants, and I tmderstand what you want. Since I applied for the finance committee, I will also have delegation over who is to receive money, and who it would benefit the most. Although, my major goal would be to unity the class. By adding more student activities, whether it be commllnity service, or various sporting events, I aim to make the Sophomore class a cohesive unit. To be honest, I spent my Freshman year sitting on my hands anclnot participating as much as I could or should of. I am hoping to not make the same mistake,twice. Through- out the year, I spent a lot of time listening to my classmates and trying to understand what makes them happy. Due to my congeniality, I am easily approachable and always willing to lend a helping hand. I will treat you as my peers, and be the voice of the students, not someone who is afraid to stand up for what he believes in. Someone who is not afraid to Student Forum, I have also branched out and become involved in various committees and activities. I have become very involved in the planning process of many evenb. I am currently serving on the Springfest committee and am responsible for the Michael Ray performance as well as the Springfest T -shirts. I have also been involved in many Student Activities endeavors, including the Winter Carnival weekend. I participated in the Fashion Show of Support last tenn. Aside from student oriented activities, I have also become part of several committees that focus on long range planning. I am serving on the search committee for the new director of Student Activities as well as the Old Cltapel renovation committee. It is very important fo me to represent the student voice on these committees; which are largely made up of deans and other administrative personnel. I am also a member of the Committee on Committees (COC), which is responsible for reviewing applications· and selecting members ofthe various Student and Student-Faculty committees. I hope that my commitment to our class as well as Union as a whole is evident. A class representative has a challenging role; to serve as a member of the Student Forum, deciding issues that affect all students, at the same time working for the best interest of the class and providing activities to bring the class together. If elected, I hope to organize more events for the Sophomore class next year that wilf give us the opportunity to spend more time with each other and bring us closer together.

I am Justin Sher and I am running for sophomore class repl'esen- tative. I have a desire to make Union the most effective learning environment for all stu- dents. Some issues that I would like to disctlss include: diversity on ilie campus, the talk of change from the trimester system to semester system, and S()phomore rush. By atte11ding many dialogues on race, I have learned that one of the greatest concerns amo11g the student community is our lack of exposure to different ethnic, social, and culturallJack- grounds. It is my goal to make Union a more cultura1ly aware environment. Even tllough the school is determined to change to a semester system, I plan on fighting to mak:e the school stay with the trimester system. An()ther issue is sophomore rush. Why would the school not allow for students to rush untiltheir sophomore year? Many students co111e to this school for the trimester system and tlte traditional Greek system. In addition, I pl~n on having our class sponsor many more events next year as well as earning more money for our class through fund~raisers. of the school, at least until we are rich and donating money and baiidings to the school. I myselfhave loved my time here at Union, and want to do anything that I can to assure myselfthat my nexttwol.Vill be as enjoyable. As a member of the Student Forum, I can not ofllydo that, but I can al.sotl)' to make it all that much more en joy able for everyone else too. If elected to this position, I will do my best to represent all the views and opinions ofthe Class of2000. We are a d!iverse group, and I think that I can receive input from 550 people, and try to help the majori:ty, all the while respecting minority rights. That's the entire idea behind democracy: to res:pect minority rights while carrying out the decisions made by the majority. That all means 1lut I will represent our class's views, but try not to exclude those whom think the other way. For instance, some students may want the gym open later every night, while a majority o11lywants it open until 1 1 PM. Well, to keep it open an extra hour in this case would give everyone what they want. All the students would come away happy and that is my g~>alforthe Student Forum: to make everyone happy. I sincerely thank you f<>r reading this far, and, as my friend from Chicago says, .. Vote early and Vote often.\ Come Friday, May 22, make sure to come out and vote, just to better represent the class and mak.e 2000 the best class ever. Sincerely, Matt Gendron Peter Casola Senior Class Representative I have a lot of experience with tlte government system. One reason that I feel that Hi. My name is Peter Casola and I am running for the position of Senior Class I have this experience is because people know my ability to make things happen.

I sh!ould probably start by telling you all a little bitalJollt myself. First of all ifl had to describe myself using only one word, it would be outgoing. Those of you who know me, know that I~njoy talking to everyone and hearing what they have to say as well. This is a quality that I .find very important to the position of sophomo:re class representative. I will do my best to make the opinions and concerns of the class of2()0 1 heard throughout the Union oommuniiy. I am not one for making campaign promises~ but I do feel that it is important to share witl1 you my views on some ofthe issues that are big 011 our campus. First of all I am strongly in favor ofthetrimester system. I think it is not only ()De of Union's strongest assets, but it gives us an edge that none of our counterparts posses. Another issue that has been debated~ lot lately is the move to sophomore rush. I arn against this change because I feel the stU<Ients of Union should be able to choose, by themselves, when they want to rush the Greek organizations on campus. As well as feeling strongly about these two issues, I feel stro11gly about representing our class in the stude11t forum. I think that I would be a capable candidate for this position and I hope that you all agree. Please vote Elyse Topp-Poirier to represent the class of2001 in the elections Friday, May 22nd. give a new prospective to the Student Forum. As most of you -wllo know me realize, I am a unique individual and I hope to bring a voice to the table that wi~l offer something out of the ordinary. As far as my \campaign goals\ I hope to help all stwdents at Union get their opinions heard and to offer a helpful hand to anyone who needs it. It is also my intention to make sure that the Senior Class has one of the best Senior Weeks that Union has ever seen and to ensure that the Senior Gift is something that will benefit Union for decades t() come.

I am writing you because I 'be- lieve thatthis portion of1he Plllll is misguided and based upon misin- fonnation. A compelling reason for taking the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity hollse to serve as an admissions office does not exist. On February 21, seventy Alpha Delta Phi alumn iat- tended a presentation by Diane Blake and you at the auditorium in the College Center of the Master Plan slide show prepared by the administration's hired consultants. You were introduced by Dan Lundquist. Having heard this presentation based on the slide show prepared by the Administration's paid con- sultants, I most respectfully .dis- agree that it is in the best interest of the College to have the Admissio:ns Office located in the Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity House. In her presentation, Diane Brake indicated that the reason that Al]Jha Delta Phi had been singled out f<>r the distinction of housing the Ad- missions Office, rather than stu- dents, was because the consulta11ts indicated that as they drove through the front gates of the College, ·~the building jumped out at them.\ In subsequent comments by Dan Lundquist, he indicated that the Admissions staff could carry on their exemplary work in Becker Hall if it was renovated. He indi- cated that what they really lacked in their current accommodatiens was a comfortable sitting room for the parents of applicants to sit in during the applicants' forty• five minute interview with the Admissions Staff. These are not compelling reasons that raise to the level of being in the best interest of Union College. More appropriate alterna- tive sites for an upgraded Admissions office exist. To state the obvious, the Col- lege owns several buildings on Library Lane that are bet- ter suited to house the Ad- missions Office. Becker Hall could be reno- vated. Silliman Hall, which the Master Plan anticipates moving the Bursar's Office into, can also be renovated or be configured. The Purchasing office and some of the offices currently located there can be relocated. Smith House, the Administra- tion building, and the President's residence are also possible loca- tions for a revamped Admission Office. The lawn between Al- pha Oelta Phi and Memorial Chapel, which may be scheduled to become a parking lot under the proposed Master Plan, could be used as the location of a new building especially designed to meetthe future needs of the Ad- missions office. Underground parking could be included. The Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity House contains approximately twelve thousand square feet of usable space.

The cost to acquire it and rehab it into office space would be an excessive and extrava- gant expense. If the Administra- tion follows through on its Plan to then tum Becker HaH into fifteen rooms of housing, the folly and the expense would be doubled. The total cost could easily exceed $4 million when compensation is paid to the Union Association of Alpha Delta Phi for this unwarranted pro- posed taking. Even if a compelling reason to take Alpha Delta Phi existed, it is unwarranted. In the early 1980s the Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity was · in poor condition. The Alumni Board approached Senior College officials to see if we could give the building to the Co'llege. The Col- lege declined. Instead, the Senior Administra- tive officials provided us with ap- proximately $40,000.00 of loans and gave us commitments that as- ~ured us that we could continue to occupy the house through the year 2035. Based on these commit- ments the Union Association of Alpha Delta Phi has spent in the neighborhood of $350,000.00 re- habbing the house since that point in time. The lack of consistency, as well as fairness, on behalf Of this Administration is appalling given: that the College now wishes totake our building. Alpha Delta Phi isnot Delta Phi. The work that was done focused on safety, security, me- chanical and structural issues, and has been done based upon the recommendations of an en- gineering report that :we ob- tained at the time. We understood that .the Co.l- lege shared these priorities. We have ordered another engineer- ing report to confirm that the Al- pha Delta Phi Fraternity House is safe and sound for student hous- ing. We extended an invitation to Fred Alford in August, 1997 to do the same. There has been no re- sponse. If the Admission has some spe- cific concerns about the Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity House, I sug- gest they raise it with our Alumni Association House manager. 'I un- derstand that our next round of work, in preparation for our 1 OOth Anniversary, is being planned now. Exterior painting and landscaping may be able to be incorporated into these plans. Union College has a unique place in the history of small private schools in the Northeast. As the mother ofFraternities, and now the host ofSororities, Union should be proud of the traditions and leader- ship opportunities that go hand in hand with these organizations. In- stead, it appears that Union is striv- ing to be like Hamilton and Colgate rather than to be unique among the elite schools in the Northeast. It is sad that this Administra~ tion does not have the confidence in the unique qualities of our Col- lege to stand on this uniqueness, and instead seeks the comfort of being indistinguishable from these other schools. There is a temptation on the part of administrators to attempt to quantify an alumni's loyalty by measuring the amount of money that he donates to his alma mater. To do so ignores the important qualitative aspects oftherelation- ship. Concerned and loyal alumni contribute in many ways to the vibrancy of Union College. I offer these comments as an in- dication of my dissatisfaction with this specific provision ofthe Master Plan, and as an indication of my continuing commitment to Union College. I am also deeply concerneq about the damage that this pro- posed Master Plan is doing to the current Undergraduate brothers and pledges at Alpha Delta Phi. I find the lack of sensitivity the Plan shows to their right to live in the Chapter House distressing. I hope that the shameful impres- sion that this misguided Plan has made on them can be eased with the passage oftime. I feel certain that only with the repeal of this objectionable por- tion of the Master Plan, can the esteem in which these students have held Union College and the Administration be restored. Very truly yours, Alan D. Humbert '77 Discussions On Crosstalk This past Wednesday I had the honor of attending a two and a half- hour slugfest. The people running it called it a cross-talk on the Mas- ter Plan, but it quickly degenerated into Alpha Delta Phi verses the Ad· ministration. Some interesting questions were raised, and some doubts were dis- pelled by the Administration. To preface the rest of this article, I will state that I am a sophomore, a male, and a Greek. To some of the people reading this, that doesn'tmean a thing, butto oth- ers it means the world. The discussion- and I say that only because street brawls refer to fights taking place outdoors - started off with a good premise and had great potential. Then it quickly degenerated into a shout- ing match between President Hull with some occasional help from other faculty and administra- tion versus the brothers of Alpha Delta Phi and their supporters. Those who had come to discuss the merits of other aspects of the plan would have to take a backseat on this occasion. It opened up with a statement by an AD followed up by Professor Taylor representing the committee that came up with the master plan. I am sure that the main points of both arguments will be represented in other articles in this fine newspaper, so I will let those points go. What stuck me as important were two subjects. First, two students asked the administration point blank what would it take to reverse their decision. The answer was that it would not be possible. ?resident Hull said that even if AD had the signatures of2000 students, the de- cision would not be reversed. To a student at a libet:al arts col- lege who believes in representation and all those democratic ideals, I was taken aback. The president of my college had just told me that, no matter what the students did, they would ignore me. I que.stion whether or not student protests would be enough to reverse the de- cision. I am only a sophomore, but have heard plenty about the Jast time the students rose in opposition to something the administration did. It was in response to the meal plan, and Greeks united to boy- cott Upperclass Dining hall on a certain day. That protest ended up with mild success, as the Greeks were put on a meal plan, but could use that money for pay- ing their cooks. in this case I pon- der what it would take for the stu- dents to keep their beloved house. My second problem with the decision revolves around the thoroughness of the committee's research. I went up and talked to a member of the committee afterwards. I asked if they had discussed other al- ternatives on the row for Admis- sions. He came back and said that the campus planner told them that AD would be the best place. I then proceeded to ask whether or: not they had looked at Old Chapel to be the new ad- missions building. He replied that they had penciled that in as the new \student center\ and so had not considered it. Now I am not saying that it would be the perfect admissions, but they want space, and Old Chapel has it. They wanted location, and Old Continued on page 9 0 I anl col ol( thi. det rat, his tut 1 act Ad Di1 res Co tOll COl mo a s1 abl the leg tur1 Eu1 an: spi1 mo sho mo I the spe sinl prit sim Edi dot dic1 Uni \ ( wh: r eve I vicl Ma i hist I Uni app leg( 11 ren rol~ ago It is that hist upo JeDJ EX1 Dav OPJ Jam ND Jas( SPG Sco1 FAC Lori Kim A& STA I j I I I r '

OP/ED Grnmnrbie:u!!Jill • May 21, 1998 • Page 9 Opinions - ''Beautiful Disasters'' Backlash To the Editor, Concordiensis: ofConcordy really need to be told that there are better uses of their space than to give a column to the author of stuff such as \Beautiful Disasters?\ I am all for free speech, and it's fine by me to get even hate speech out in the open, but an excellent further use of free speech is tore- pudiate aggressively offensive publications. The whole phenomenon of pan- icked backlashes by the Greek sys- tem to any proposal for change or diversification is interesting. Al- most no student will publicly (though many will privately) set himself or herself apart from it. As far as I could tell, there were only two courageous exceptions, one at · the Crossta/1( on Sopholliore Rush· and one at the Crosstalk on AD. But otherwise, the public re- sponse to proposals made in the name ofthe college's overall best interest is monolithic, opposi- tional, and negative, orchestrated with an accompaniment of hoots, catcalls, hisses, and the occasional profanity. Many students rushed to prove their conformity with the one acceptable opinion-\No!\ Such people will be less likely to listen to me than to the author of \Beautiful Disasters,\ but here is my advice anyway. If you want to pl'eserve the Greek system at Union beyond the Presidency of Roger Hull (who is its guardian), change with the times. Because they have old traditions does not mean fi·atemities cannot be pr&gressive. Adopt Sophomore rush~ admit women if your national allovvs it (as some do), make your orga11ization inviting (rather than hostile) to membership by people of colOr, find some intellectual pur- . pose 'Jll addition to your charities, cultivate other forms of entertain- ment than the rapid consumption of the cheapest beer, truly elimi- nate llazing, drop all forms of ini- tiatioll that invade the pledge's comrn itrtrent to classes and sports~ and generally cease to see your de- votion to the house as sometimes opposed to, and superior to, your commitment to the college and its mission. What is that? Academic excel- lence. When these things happen, the administration and faculty will be as proud of its fraternities as the current members are.

I am one who would gladly give up tile proposed student center in Old Chapel in order to keep hun- dreds of fellow students happy and to appease the angry giant of an ad- ministration. I am also one who will stand up for students over a hastily made de- cision, even ifthe committee does have three Greek males and took a year and a halfto make their minds up. On a final note, I think that AD missed many opportunities to make a good argument, and instead ap- pealed to emotions of the students and administration. Instead of us- ing em()tion, I would instead use logic and force.

Page A Closer Look at Sophomore Rush by Jamie Drown and Chad Staro On Behalf of IFCflnd Pan Hell The following is the actual proposal written by the faculty committee in regards to their interest in making a transition to sophomore rush (and ultimately sophomore pledging): To the Faculty From the Faculty Executive Committee Draft Motion: Sophomore Rush 11 Mar 98 Currently, the Greek houses at Union recruit most of their members from the freshman class. The faculty proposes that this process (rush, pledging, initiation, etc.) occur in the sophomore year, beginning with the class of2004 This is not a new recommendation. It was made hy,for instance, the Planning and Priorities Subcommittee on Residential and Social Lifo (1996-97) and the AAC Suhcouncil on \Enhancing Intellectual Lifo and Academic Challenge at Union College\ (May 1996). The latter report suggested that Sophomore rush would a) Allow freshmen time to acclimate to the college as a whole and to the variety of its possible forms of social lifo, rather than to a small set offraternities or sororities, and enable them to make informed choices. b) Return seniors to residence in Greek houses, possibly thus having a maturing effect on fraternity life; c) Eliminate the negative effect of rush onfreshman academic work To these reasons, one may now add two others. First, the new initia- tives for social alternatives, both for theme houses and for those living in residence halls, need a chance to take hold. Second, and most criti- cally, for the sake of its own future, the college needs to maintain and improve its own reputation as an academic institution. For the proper recruitment and retention of talented students, the college needs to be hospitable to those interested in other forms of social life, not just those with a taste for Greek life. The aims of this proposal are not to eliminate, hut to moderate and improve the Greek houses at Union, to enlarge the diversity and vigor of intellectual life on campus, and to insure that the attention of fresh- men students is upon their initiation to college academic life, not their initiation into the Greek social life. Thus we recommend that the Student Affairs Council endorse the shift from Freshman to Sophomore Rush. Furthermore, in view of the likely effects on both Greek and non-Greek housing, we ask the Student Af- fairs Council to work with the Administration in appointing a commit- tee (with representation from the faculty, student body, and administra- tion) to anticipate e.ffocts of the change, then to plan for freshman and sophomore residential life, with housing options in harmony with the master plan; and to create attractive housing alternatives for any Greeks who without Sophomore residents cannot fill their houses. This com- mittee should do its work in the 1998-99 year, and make recommenda- tions to Planning and Priorities as necessary for funding to make ap- propriate changes in residence halls. ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• The Inter Fraternal Council and Pan Hellenic Committee in no way disagree that there is room for in- tellectual growth at Union College. We also agree that it should-be the priority of the college to continue recruiting the best possible appli- cants who upon admission should be given an unbiased opportunity to grow and succeed. We do however disagree that implementing the proposed Sophomore Rush can solve either of these issues. Sophomore Rush may partially solve the issues dis- cussed above, but is by no means the answer. As noted above, Sophomore Rush would \force seniors to live on campus and stimulate the intel- lectual life of the college.\ Instead of first directing you towards the sentiment of the Union College community, I will tell you how it worked at other schools (no not Hamilton and Colgate, but Dartmouth and Lafayette). A re- port from Lafayette, who four years ago switched to Sophomore Rush because \most of the schools in the Patriot League were switch- ing,\ talked a great deal about the negative effects this plan had on housing. \The campus is about 96- 97% residential and they count on the spaces in the Greek houses to be able to house all students ... This forced seniors back into h{)USe. They have never considered making physical adjustments to college-owned houses to accom- modate smaller acceptance.\ In addition, the section providing the positive effects began by stating \it's a big struggle. Students are not happy.\ They lost their meal plans and room occupancy due to the drop in membership.\ Lafayette only recognized \a mini- mal difference in grades.\ At Dartmouth, \housing was the biggest obstacle. The Greek houses with smaller membership got hurt big time.\ Both reports were prepared by a Union College administrator and noted no signs of intellectual growth.

Chatting it up, ment received lly the IFC and Pan Hellenic committees about se· niors living on campus was in ex- treme oppositionto the idea ofliv· ing on campus as a senior in the current conditions. Also in regards to hotJsing is the eventual possibility of the smaller houses not being able to fill ev- ery bed. Will they move off cam- pus where the school cannot gov· ern them at all? Will they then possibly begin to prosper with freshmen who could pledge there because they are not recognized by the school? As secondary as this concern may be, where will the social life at Union go? Not just Greeks go to fraternity par· ties. If the social life is just 20 minutes in either direction, then why not go to school 20 minutes in either directi<>n where a social life and quality education are both offered? The faculty was also concerned about the growth and develop· ment of freshman during their first year at college. They were afraid. that fraternity or sorority pledging might interrupt the developmental process. Some may completely disagree, but a number of Greeks on campus would and have in fact attested that Greek life is what al- lowed them to complete the devel- opmental process we are address~ in g. In closing, we would like to re- mind the faculty and members of the Union College community that we are writing this with our con- cerns for the college and Greek community at the college. The committees do not wish to make this an attack to the faculty or ad- ministration. It is our hope that you will take into consideration a broader set of circumstances when deciding whether or not to con- tinue discussions regarding this issue any further. If any type of committee is formed, we believe that it should be to first investigate all the factors ofa sophomore rush program, and not to qecide upon an implementation process for Sophomore Rush. we se ha ab an ll th w: ar' ar' sti re th pt A or an gl an m th th st1 St1 in es A CE th pl 0 tl y tl Sl I a e

Features. Jon Tapper's Weekly Commentary by Jon Tapper Staff Writer I would like to start off this week's column by making a quick, serious point. Why does this school have so much politics? Everything about this school involves politics and how much money Daddy has. I have a real problem when every- thing I do on this campus I have to watch my back to see if some rich kid's Daddy is going to suerne. We are supposed to be kids who joke around and have ~n while we are still young and hav;e relatively little responsibility. It's a damn sltame that so many people on this cam- pus have lost sight ·of that. I think thatit will be really bad if AD loses their house.

I don't know at what point the beans thought that everything they say is right and everything the students say is wrong, but it has to stop. The Deans need to stalit look- ing out for the students' best inter- ests and I am not just talking about AD, but everything else on campus. Fratemities get a bad rap on this campus. Why can't anyone see aU the good that they do for this cam- pus and the Schenectady commu- nity as a whole? In my esteemed opinion, I think that this campus would be a lot worse off without fraternities. Whether you are in one or not, you have to admit that they add a lot to this campus. I think it's only fair that I sup- port a candidate for Class of20Q.l Student Forum Representative in tomorrow's election. I am throw- ing my support behind Steve Schuler. Steve is a hard worker and a good guy with a lot of new and innovative ideas. 1 think he would do agreatjobrepresenting us in the Student F ()rum nextyear. I don't know wh<> he's running against, but you can bet your last dollar that I am going to vote for him tomom.Jw. Has anyone else seen a cat on the campus lately that kind ofre- sembles a skunk?

Respecting the efforts of other people is an important skill and an imperative ability if we are ever to progress as a society. Those who cannot appreciate others are doomed to fall. I wish that I had been grarLted the opportunity t() fmd out more the Self is the only one we can count on. So, in your life, honor the ac- complishments of those arotmd you, lest your ignorance be your undoing. And, in the face of troubles re- member, you can lay down and die from the heat, or you can sit up and sing! and simply rude comments be- tween people who are supposedly friends are more than common~ . place. Yet, people don't mind the harsh barrage of words; they even laugh. This is a.pltenomenon that I simply cannot understand. I suppose a lot of people find themselves attacking their friends for the sake ofhumor, but it seems like such a strange way to com- mllnicate. Putting people down or making fun of faults is in no way humorous in my eyes. Granted, I do not believe that we should walk on eggshells around one another and censor the things that we say, but there is a certain level of dis- cretion that has been sorely lack- ing in our generation's current means of communication. Words are hurtful things ... just as brutal as fists or sharp metal ob- jects. Honestly, verbal abuse is as strong, if not stronger, than physi- cal attack. Young children are for- ever imprinted by the rudeness or ta11nting of others at an early age. Noone enjoys feeling alienated or bombarded with a s.lew of hurtful words. It is one of the earliest les- sons in life that we all learn. Name- calling in kindergarten is unaccept- ab 1e, what makes it okay now? Despite all the maturation and per- sonal improvement we go through, blatant verbal ridicule is the one thing that we often forget to grow ottt of. I don't know if it gives people an invigorating jolt of happiness or contentment to see someone else in emotional anguish from an onslaught of obnoxious words. It seems as though nothing delights some people more that seeing the effecill of their cruelty in action. Maybe it is: that primal baseness in the depths of allltumans, some- . n()W triggered to action, that causes people to feel the need to be mean. Caustic sarcasm, especially When it is. uncalled for, is a sign oflack- ing civility. It is an indication of a lack of personal insight and a simple lack of respect for another human being. What defines us as civilized creatures, hundreds of years re- moved from the brutish nature of Medieval barbarity, is our ability to hold rational, intellectual con- versation. No, we don't have to spend hours in front of the fire- place discussing war, world hun- ger, and the greenhouse effect, but conversations shouldn't always cansist of meaningless trash talk thrown back and forth. It seems that people our age are always finding themselves at ex- tremes: either failing into the trap of shallow, bubble-headed con- versation, or slipping into this wonderful phenomenon of people bashing. Honestly, stop and think about the last in depth conversation you had. How many times did the words, \stop being such a loser,\ or \get over yourself' find their way into your converstation. Prob- ably a lot more than once. Most people don't even give the state- ments a second thought, but it's a sad thing to realize that such bla- tant insults are simply a part of our everyday social interaction. Would you speak that way to your grandmother? This universal scarcity of com- mon courtesy has larger implica- tions than a few hurt feelings or a bruised ego. Our actions lend an example to those younger than us and right now, the way little kids act is absolutely atrocious. I have been in Kaybee Toys and seen a 6-year old tell his mother that she is a, \mean ugly b**ch.\ This is insanity to me! How on earth can children speak that way to their parents; has the world gone abso- lutely stark-raving mad? It seems that everyday, more and more vulgar language is be- coming socially acceptable. Ratherthanjustgoalong with it, I would like to think that as fairly intelligent individ:uals, we (as a whole) would see the faults of so- ciety and tty to change them. I would hope that in seeing the spec- tacle of small children cursing off their parents, we would be brought to the realization that something is dreadfully wrong. There are far better ways of get- ting out our frustrations than de- meaning or belittling others. Pop- ping bubble wrap is one of my personal favorites. Honestly, you should try it some time ... the flit- ting sounds of bursting plastic are much more enjoyable than the words, \you suck.\ But in all se- riousness, there is honestly no need for the immaturity of name- calling. It's time we realize that, and actually do something to change the habit. . .,...

Page 14 Quest for Camelot This weekend was a slow one for the movie theatres. Only two films were released - The Horse Whisperer and Quest for Camelot so our choices were limited as to what we could review. So, we decided to take our friend's younger brother to the movies, that way we would have a perfect excuse to go see the new- est animated film to come to the big screen. Quest for Camelot is an animated fairy tale adventure set in the world of Arthurian legend. Having brought order to a land of chaos, Arthur assembles his knights in Camelot. It is at this point that Ruber, a greedy knight, attempts to steal Excalibur from King Arthur only to be foiled by the rest ofthe nights. During this fight Sir Lionel, King Arthur's most trusted knight, is killed. On a simple farm far away, a feisty young heroine named Kayley dreams of becoming a knight. She eagerly watches a pro- cession of knights ride by, waiting for her father's return. Unfortu- nately, her father was the knight who sacrificed his life for King Arthur and is being carried on a slab. The king tells Kay ley's mom (Lady Juliana) that she is always welcome at Camelot. Several years pass, and Kayley stHI wants to follow in her father's footsteps and become a knight. Meanwhile, Ruber still wants to nde Camelot, so he sends a Griffin to steal Excaliber. The griffin suc- ceeds in stealing the sword, but drops it into the Forbidden Forest. Lady Juliana and Kayley are kid- naped by Ruber, but Kayley es- capes and must find tile sword to foil Ruber's evil plan to take over Camelot. Along the way, she meets a blind hermit named Garrett, who re.luctantly agrees to help her in her quest. Quest for Camelot draws upon the successful elements of past animated features to bring a fun adventure to the screen that kids and kids-at-heart will er~uy; a fantastic story, talking animal side- kicks, a central love story, and an evil villain. As opposed to the last few ani- mated films to be released, Quest for Camelot does not misconstrue history (ie. Anastasia and A&E's FYI: God,s Favorite Successful, .Atfarat Sade.

The voice-overs for the charac- ters boast an all-star cast and complement the film surprisingly well. Pierce Brosnan (of\Bond. James Bond\ fame) is the righteous King Arthur and Jane Seymour (Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman) plays Lady Juliana. Don Rickles, the voice of Mr. Potato Head in Toy Story, makes up one half of the two-headed dragon as Cornwall. He is joined by former Monty Python member Eric Jdle, who is no stranger to the land of Camelot and the legend of King Arthur, provides the voice •• • of Devon. These two .prove to be a hilarious odd couple. Gabriel Byrne (The Man in the Iron Mask and The Usual Suspects) does the voiceofKayley's father, Sir Lionel. Finally, Gary Oldman, the per- petual bad guy (Air Force One, Lost in Space, The Fifth Element, and Bram Stoker's Dracula) is the voice ofRuber. The songs are pieasant d advance story, just as they should in a good musi- caL The con- tinue for Celine Dion, we may be hearing her voice on countdowns for a long time. After Titanic, her voice is a hot commodity for a soundtrack. There were ~everal good moments in this movie, which bore a striking resemblance to the style of Walt Disney mov- ies. One of our favorites is when C9mwall (one of the heads of the two-headed dragon) introduces himself, then says \You can call me Corny.\ Unfortunately, we seem to remember this line from Disney's classic Bambi (\You can call me Flowers ... \) Also, Walt Disney is famous for what has been called \The T!lke Me Eyes,\ where a female character will seductively look at a male character (go back and watch The Lion King and Aladdin amongst others to see what we mean} This movie puts an interesting twist on this, as Kay ley attempts to give \The Take Me Eyes\ to Garret - only to find out that he is blind and can not see the look. Until recently, the silver screen animation turfbelongedto [)isney. Now that Fox (Anastasia) and Warne:r Brothers have begun to slowly move in, it will be interesting to see how Disney will respO>nd. So, what did we learn from this movie? Well, ifyouareatwoheaded dragon, you need to cooperate to get things accomplished, the ~'Take Me Eyes\ don'tworkon blindchar- acters, that the acme corporation was in business back in the Dark Ages and, finally, that true bravery is in the heart.
