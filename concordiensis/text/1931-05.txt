Win Tmck Coach Pt·edicts Possible Victory at Haverford Title Meet tlnion is favored to win the 19Ui · · annual Middle Atlanti:cs track ·I'neet according to the· best performances of the seasOn of all competitors en• .tered. The Middle Atl~ntic States Collegiate Athletic ·· Association b;ack and field championships take place at Haverford, Pa., this Fri- day and :~aturday. Coach Bruce has not finally se- lected the men who wHl take the trip·, but wiU conduct time tria<is , and eliminations for this purpose at today's practice session. Six :men who b~ve consistently turned ~n outstandmg .performances dur- mg the season are expected to roH . .up the winning points. · On paper the Union team should carry oJf two first places. \Red\ · McCague is expected to take the quarter, while Captain Aussicker is counte~ on for the mile, and a clase place m the half-mile. \Chuck\ Savage and Cohn are relied on for high jump points, Savage being capable of a first, and at worst a third, while Cohn may bring in the fifth place point. Harris is expected to take at least two thirds. He has fast com- petition in the hundred and · the 220; but will probably increase the U:nion score substantially. His run- . nmg n1ate, McCague, looks good for a 220-yard place, also. Lehman, Stark and Cohn shoUld add several points for field events. Lehman, versatile star, is expect- ~d to tally in the running broad · JUmp, pole vault, and javelin. Stark should' place high in the shot put- ting event. The high hurdles will · probably have Cohn among its win- • ners. · Union's chief opposition in the meet is expected from four colleges. Haverford, Lafayette, Manhattan and Rutgers will furnish keen com• petition. ----0·---- Williams to Meet Ball Team Here,· MAINSTAYS FOR MIDDLE ATLAN:IIC MEET :Garnet Nine Ties · Northeastern 5-5 .,..__...........,.,.. : Rain Halts .

The '(llay which is to be presented is \Caste a comedy drama in three a~ts by T. W. Rob- ertson. The play will be repeated tomorrow night, all d again on the evening of June 1:2, the occasion of the return of the alumni. The prime object of the Mounte- banks in selecting this drama for their production is i:o show the de- velopment of the modern drama. In its present forr:n, the play would probably be considel'ed the world's worst drama, in spite of the fact that on the occ~sion .of it~ first presentation in London around 1865, it was thought to be the apogy of dramatic success. The aim of the drama is t<> show the oppo- sition of the times -to a nobleman's manying out of his own social class. Of col:lt'se this idea is today, absm·d, and with t!Lis fact in mind, Mr. Edward L.

Five Sports Will Face Teams Awav . \' Only One Home £ont~st Sche- duled for Week-end; Nine Plays Here mn Friday The five spring S)lorts teams wm all be in action over the weelc-end. beginni·ng Friday afternoon, and continuing through Saturday. Only one of the six event.s is a home con- test. The baseball te.am meets the Massachusetts Agriicultural college nine here Friday amter.noon at 4:30 on Alexander field.. Although the Union !!layers defe:ated the Ag.g-ies easily last year by a 6-2 score, they expect a closer game this year, as the Massachusetts team has been building up a good 11ecord. · Its most recent g;ame resulted in a 3-2 loss to Amhe:rst in a closely contested fifteen inning game. Since Amherst and. Williams rank almost equally, and consideriRg the fact that Williams iUpset Union last week by a 10-4 scene, the two op- posing teams Friday will be very evenly matched. Golf at Clinton The golf team journeys to Clin- ton Friday to play Hamilton there. Bannerman, Mead\ Dixon, and Wettlaufer will reporesent the Con- tinentals, while StEwart, Howard, Blood, a.nd Cheer will play for the Garnet. In Union's: opening match against Hamilton, the Garnet golf- ers lost 6-0. Last year the team also lost, that time by a 4-2 score, A recent spurt to'Wards improve- ment, however,. give:s the Garnet an excellent chanc.e to win the match. Frida? will also mark the pre- liminaries of the Intercotlegiate track meet, which :is being held at Phr!adei:phia. Harris, McCague and Aussicker are entered, and will leave here with \Doc\ Bruce, and Manager Allen Thu~sday afternoon .. All of the events scheduled' for Saturday will be played away ..

Howeve1· they will be permitted .to show their desire to participate in the carrying out of one of Union's oldest and most pic- turesque traditions tomorrow night at 7:!5 o'clock in Captain Jackson's Garden. The undergraduates will form ac- cording to class outside the South Gate ·of the Garden and at 7:30 o'clock, they will proceed to the Nott Elm, accompanied by the strains of the Band. After the stu- dents have arranged theml;lelves around the old tree which is the traditional property of the seniors, each class wiH sing one verse of the Alma Mater, and then its orig- inal Class song. After these renditions the Kruesi Cup which is awarded annually to tbe senior who shows the greatest scholastic and athletic improve- ment in four years, will be pi;esent- ed. Nelson Nitchman was the re- cipient of this award last year, while Gilbert Potter, captain of the championship lacrosse team of :).929; won the coveted honor in 1929. Intet-fratei•nity Competition The Interfraternity song contest will follow the Kruesi Cup award. For the :first time in the history of Spring Night, fraternities will en- gage in vocal competition. How- ever in spite of the fact that this is an attempt to modernize a tra- dition, only ten fraternities have shown their willingness to compete. They are: Kappa Alpha, Sigma Phi, Delta Upsilon, Beta Theta P.i, Phi Gamma Delta, Psi Upsilon, Theta Nu Epsilon, Chi Psi, Alpha Delta Phi, and Kappa Nu. Each will sing one of their fraternity songs in the ord-er chosen by lot. \Doc\ Bruce, Professor Taylor and Professor Schauffler will judge the musical attempts of the frater- nities and win present the winning . group with the cup <)onated by Dr. Day. In order to retain permanent possession of this .cup, the frater- nity must win the song contest .three th'nes, not necessarily on con-· secutive occasions. The Ludlow Melius Cup will be awarded to the class which sings the best original song. The exercises will close with the fall of night. -------0------~ SEEI\.S RADIO HISTORY J etso.n 0. Bentley, '24, is prepa.r- ing a history of the former Union radio club, which was an organiza- tion of more than local interest, since the station established was the first to broadcast regularly pro- grams of music and educational talks. Its usefulness, as far as the public went, was shortlived, as na- turaHy it could not compete with commercial stations .. It continued, how:evet·, a valuable experimental worlt for a number of years ·after it gave up regular broadcasting. Mr. Bentley wishes us to appeal to all Union men who have been connected with the sta- tion to write him what they ltnow of its work. Address Jetson 0.

On Wednesday night the Union md Rensselaer chapters of the So-' ~iety of Sigma Xi held their annual banquet at the Mohawk GQlf Club. rhis banquet is alternated each· year between Troy and Schenec· tady, and it is interesting to note that the Rensselaer and the Union ~hapters are the second and the third chapters respectively of this. society, the Troy chapter being. three days okler than the Union · ngan>iza tion. A series of seven pa:pers were ])resented at the banquet each deal-. ing with research work going on at Union. Mr. Ralph G. Clausen of the biology department read a short· oaper on \The Effects of Optical Stimuli on Fish.\ During the course of his experimenting Mr. Clausen used a tank with a moveable bot- tom in order to make the fish swim · up or down stream as he desired. Professor Charles B. Hurd present- ed a paper on \Silic Acid Jellies\ in which work he was assisted by P. H. Dewey and P. S. Miller, mem- bers of the senior class. Hoadley Reads raper Professor Anthony :S:oadley read '1. paper on \Stresses in Concrete Darns,\ a theoretical research on dam construction. Professor E. S. C. Smith gave a paper on \Studies of Volcanic Deposits in Maine,\ a subject he has been engaged in for several summers. Mr. F. M. Ul- l'ich spoke on \Complex Functions\ a piece of original research in hig·her mathematics. Professor M. F. .. Sayer then presented a paper on 'Problems in Elastic Behavior\ a :!Onti.nuance of his research work with springs. The fina:l paper of the evening was prese.nted by Mr. James C. Surduke, a graduate stu- dent working for his masters de- ~ree, on \The Hall in Solid Mer- cury.\ Previous to the banquet the Union chapter held its second in- .itiation of the year. James C. Sur- duke v.on.s elected a full member and David Gold '31, Jacob Kauf- man '31, John S. Irish ~31, Vincent ~. :Meara '31, Carl M. Johnson '31, and H. Mynter '32 were elected as- sociate members. Professor Charles B. Hurd as secretary of the society was in charg:e of the arrangements for the affair.
