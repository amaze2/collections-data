'Twas noon ·Of night, and by his flickering lamp That gloated o'er his dingy room and damp, 'Vith glassy eye and haggard face there sat A disappointed, worn-out Democrat. His eloquence all wasted-plans all failed, His r5puriJUB coin fast to the counter nailed. Deception's self was now at length deceived, His lies political, no more believed. * * * * * At length he rose in haste, \I have it now,\ (A smile of joy lit np his darkened brow,) \The people cast me off, I'll raise a storm, I'll stir the nation with the cry 'reform,' I'll tell them treason floats on. every breeze, And danger whispers in the sighing trees. I'll call them gallant heroes, patriots, braves, Defenders of their home;:;, their fathers' graves, Me, they shall call the nation's Saviour then,- Then gold and office shall be mine again.\ He gathel'ed round him many of his kind, Waste lumbe1·, by all parties left behind. They sat that night in council, and at morn, When all the stars grew dim, then \Sam\ was born. * * * * * The alarm was sounded ; over hill and da.le It flew upon the wings of every gale, The granite monntains heard it and the plains Of the wild West caught the awakening strains. Freedom in peril! the .great crisis comes! Arouse ye millions ; beat the signal drums ! Vengeance upon the mercenary brood Of papal minions, pouring like a flood Over fair Freedom's land, the F1·eeman's home! Behold the ~wanning thousands as they come ! From lip to lip the startling rumor fties, With ears erect .and wide distended ·eyes, All eager listen to the growing tale, Which gains new terrors from each passing gale.

The storm grew darker ; like .a foan.1.ing tide That drinks the mountain torrents in from either side, So grew the people's wrath, which, with resistlefls force, Swept down all party lines in its swift course, And tossing on the foam-capped: waves were seen The struggling forms of what had lately been Whigs, Democrats, Barnburners, Silver Greys, Exploded fragments, all of other days. * * * * * Sam's aspirations grew; he longed to gain Nebraska's wood-crowned height and Kansas' plain, The rolling prairie, broad and wild and free, An ocean of sweet flowers, a waving sea Of verdure spread; from ont its hallowed soil He'd wring vile gold, boughtbythe bonJman'stoil. * * * * * Unhappy Sam! that was his fatal day, When 'gainst the slave his-.,pow.er he did array; When on the hands outstretched implo~ing aid, He would have bound the chains himself had made., Freemen then saw beneath his robes of light, A fiend incarnate from the realms of night. That was the rock on which the millions dashed, And as a wave to foaming fury lashed Thunders its rage against the rock-bound shore, Then rolls away and with a sullen roar Seeks its deep ocean caves; his gathered band Poured mlli.\muring away, and on the strand Left him, in all ;his vileness there to lie, Where yet he gasps, refusing still £o die. , .

By JAMES A. GARFIELD. Published in the Williarns Quarterly of March, 1856. 'Tis beauteous night; the stars look brightly down Upon the earth decked in her robe of snow. No light gleams at the windows save my own, Which gives its cheer to midnight and to me. And now, with noiseless step sweet Memory comes And leads me gently through her twilight realms. What Poet's tuneful lyre has eve1· sung, Or delicatest pencil e'er portrayed ' The enchanted, shadowy land where Memory dwells ? It has its valleys, cheerless, lone and drear, Dark shaded by the mournful cypress tree, And yet its sunlit mountain tops are bathed In Heaven's own blue. Upon its craggy cliffs, Robed in the dreamy light of distant years, Are clustered joys serene of othe1· days; Upon its gently-sloping hillsides bend The weeping willows o'e1· the sa.cred dust. Of dear departed ones ; yet, in that land, Where' er our footstep falls upon the shore, They that were sleeping, rise from out the dust Of death's.long silent years and round us stand As erst they did before the prison tomb Received their clay within its voiceless halls. The heavens that bend above that land, are hung With clouds of val'ious hues ; some dark and chill, Surcharged with sorrow, cast their sombre shade Upon the sunny, joyous land below. Others are floating through the dreamy air, White as the falling snow, their margins tinged With gold and crimson hues ; their shadows fall Upon the flowery meads and sunny slopes, Soft as the shadow of an angel's wing. When the rough battle of the day is done, And evening's peace falls gently 0n the heart, I bound away across the noisy years, Unto the utmost verge of 1\Iemm·y's land, Where earth and s1ry in dreamy distance meet. And Memory dim with dark Oblivion joins. Where woke the first remembeTed sounds,. that fell Upon the ear in childhood's early morn. And wandering thence, along the rolling years I see the shadow of my fm·mer self, Gliding from childhood up to man's estate. The path of yo11th winds down thl:ough many a vale, And on the brink of many a dread abyss, From out whose darkness comes no 1·ay of lightr Save that a phantom dances o'er the gulf, And beckons toward the verge. Again the path Leads o'er a'summit where the sunbeams fall. And thus, in light and shade, sunshine and gloom, Sorrow and joy, this life-path leads along. <£dit_orial. ....____., WE were delighted at the great demand for copies of our first issue, and regret that we had not enough to satisfy all.

The German student begins and pursues at the same tin1e his physical and intellectual developn1ent; and what country can boast more erudite scholars or more proficient athletes? The English students at Eton and Rugby, Oxford and Cambridge, lay the foundations of those sturdy con- stitutions which mark them as a race. Wellington said that it was England's foot- ball fields that made England's soldiers. 'THE BASE BALL ASSOCIATION. In pursuance of the \Vish of the directors, a n1eeting was called of those students \vho \vere interested in base ball. The meeting was largely attended. The object is to bind the students in an association in order that they rnay have direct par-· tici pation in and control of base ball matters and not leave the entire responsibility upon the directors. A constitution was read by McMurray, '82, apd adopted unanimously. The

He is to submit all challenges, both those received and those intended to be sent, to the association, and to take no action thereon without the consent of the association. 'Ihe treasurer is to report the condition of the finances at each n1eeting. This report is necessarily brief but the matter will be again referred to, when our space is greater. After a committee had been appointed to confer vvith the Faculty in regard to fencing the new grounds, the meeting was adjourned. The \vork ot obtaining subscribers 1s no\v being carried un, and we hope that all the students will at once become members. YATES CHAMPIONSHIP CUP. On the afternoon of ()ctober ,1oth, the third game in this series \vas played by the Seniors and Sopho- mores. Contrary to expectation, the Seniors played a fine gan1e and tnacie • the fact apparent that, if they pos- sessed a good catcher, their nine would be one of the best in college. <..)btaining a small lead at the begin- ning they slowly increased it until it seemed certain that Eighty-t\i\~0 would at least \Vin one game. Hope nearly deserted the Sophomores, but in the fourth inning they made up their loss and gained a lead which they retained until the end. All in all it was one of the most interesting games of the series. The game was called at the end of the fifth inning on account of darkness. Following is the score: SENIORS. R. B.H. P.O. A.. lll.

THE CONCORDIENS!S. 29 COMB.INATlON GAMES. On the 21st an interesting g.an1e was played by combination ntnes. The Seniors and Sophs 'A-rere arrayed against the Juniors and Freshmen. The nines were very evenly n1atched and Jhe doubt as to the winners ren- der~d the gatne nlore exciting. In the::thiddle of the seventh inning the game was called on accotlnt of dark. ness,-':the result being based on the six;[jnn~ngs played by hoth nines. As each n1ne had four runs, the gatne was declared a dra\v by Urnpire Van- derveer and ordered to be played over. Following is the score: SENIORS AND SOPHS. :n.
