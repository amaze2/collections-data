Since his tinw Union has not scor-ed in a Senior National event until last Monda;;· night when A.

In scoring fourth position Totten defeat-ed sev- eral luminaries of N a tiona! and Olym- pic fame. Although faHing to score, the work of Harry Duane in the 70-yard high hurdles and Lol'ing McMillan in that now celebrated, record smashing 1000 yards was exceedingly good for again the fields carried exceptional class. Duane ran a g.ood race to qualify 'in the preliminaries, and survived to the semi-final where he had the misfor- tune to skim the fourth hurdle which put him out of the race. McMillan, ! · starting in a field of 21, was hand~ · capped by drawing a position in tl:e I . second row. The world at large IS · now familiar with the sensational , • . race in which Lloyd.

Many · people today don't believe in their own i power and therefore don't use it. \A well known New York magazine : recently asked whether a child's char- · · acter was decided at the age of seven. i One expert answered that a child's ; character was destined when it had ' reached the .age of three.

One inclination is to accept the habits,~ customs, 'traditions, dogmas, and materials of the past. as sacr·ed and final. The other expresses itself variously ! as an inte·rest in free personality and moral freedom, 1 or as a re.ali.zation of fr-ee intelligence, free personality, . and a free world. These div·erse tendencies constantly conflict in such a way that first one, then the other, i seems to hav·e the upper hand. It is, with slight varia- tions, the cl'tange championed by Heracleitus versus the permanene-e of Parmenides and the Eleatic school. I Today many parties, groups, and factions are fighting.
