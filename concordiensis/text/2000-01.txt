Some have asked whethe·r or not the Professor's are asked for their co- operation, and if any are offended by the quotes put up. \We do not need permission from professors to run their quotes,·· said Riley. \But if I think I quote was fabri- cated I will not post it up, and if anyone is offended by a quote, I can easily remove it.\ One area where Riley cannot re- move anything is from the Student Forum Boa:rd, where students post their views. A recent topic has cen- tered around the amount of money that Union students pay compared with the qt~ality of the facilities on campus. Iff anyone is offended by a quote int:he Student Forum, they have to C()ntact DailyJolt.com to have it removed. \DailyJolt mns the Forum,. so I cannot touch that,\ explained 'fim. So far, the Daily Jolt has been a success. Many students have logged 011 to it to get useful infor- mation in both the academic and social scenes at Union and in the local area. Tim is happy with the way the site has turned out. '\So far I've gotten good feedback through E-ma.ils. \DailyJolt.com is an alternative to the Union homepage - it is easier f() navigate, and has S() many more options.\ Riley is also looking for help to run the Web site after he ,graduates this spring. After starting on a bumpy road~ it looks like it is smooth sailing for the Daily Jolt Web site that Tim Riley has brought here to the Union College campus.

Over the last ten years, the number ofapplicants to. Union has been steadily in:¢reasing. Dan Lundquist, Dean of Admissions ,says that this is the longest run of successive accomplishment for a liberal arts college like Union. Fur- thermore, the only schools that are currently doing better than Union are the Ivy League schools.The cause ofthis influx of applications each year is hard to precisely pin- point. According to Lundquist, there are no specific changes he can point to in order to justify the in- crease. Lundquist feels that Ad- missions starts the motor, but what really attracts the applicants is Union itself. Lundquist stresses, \We [in Admissions] have done well because Union is so good.\ While Admissions can be cred- ited for all of the '\behind the scenes\ public relations work, Union really speaks for .itself. The students, the campus and the warm feeling a student gets when tour- ing the College is what attracts the students to express further inter- est. Lundquist comments, \You can put a stellar Admissions office in any school, however Jhey can only do so much. The school is what draws applications in each year.\ Admissions uses a scientific based recruiting search. This search enables Admissions to most effectively seek out prospec- tive students. A variety of tech- niques are used to try and entice new students. Brochures. videos, and the Union website give the students a taste of what life at Union is really like. These are the first steps to drawing in applicants. After that, the prospective stu- dents begin to visit the schooL Ac- corcling to 'Lundquist, these visits are the key factors in determining whi-cl:l college to choos.e. Lundq11ist states, \Admissions only brings the horse to water, the visits are really what capture the in- terests of the s tud.en ts.\ Admissions has. also set up some new ideas· for ways to draw prospec- tive students to Uni.on. Start- ing last week,· a pp I ic at ions were being ac- ce:ptegon- line. Now ·students can send word- · processed ap- plications over the web.

Since then, he has been. working dili- gently to improve the atmosphere • for the new year. According to Metzger, \The Skellar should be a meeting place with a warm and friendly fe.eling. It should en.ceur- age gathering and socialization.\ With thirty yea:rs experience under his belt, Metzger says, \I am the . future of th.e Rathskellar.\ For those u11familiar with the Skellar, it is a social and relaxing · alternative tothe standard eating establishments on campus.

Applications for next year's freshman class have risen approxi- mately 55% for the first round of Early Decisions and approximately 52% for the second round of Early Decisions.

For all you health food eaters, the Ske11ar is continuing to serve bagged baby carrots and salads. The goal of the Rathskellar ac- cording to Metzger is \to provide the best quality food possible at the lowest prices.\ In order to achieve this goal the Skellar has made various.upgrades fu. the foods they are ,currently serving. The roast beef, the chicken patty and the hot dog have all been updated to a better brand of meat. Further- more, the italian mixed subs have returned to the regular menu and have improved. The sandwiches will now be served on 12 inch baget rolls. The tuna has also been up- graded to a better quality and will now be made with Hellmann's mayonnaise.

First of all, Will- iams College has an enormous en- dowment of one billion dollars, al- most triple that of Union's. This huge financial capacity is attrib- uted to high investment returns, and strong alumni connections. Williams' College interim President Carl W. Vogt said, \We are in a low inflation cycle with our endowment increasing and our contributions from alumni being very strong. This just seems to be a logical move for us.\ The endowment at Williams has tnpled m only ten years, a feat that allowed the college to share its prospcn ty with the students. While forty-one percent of Will- lams students receive some form offmai1C!al aid, the fixwillbemuch appreciated by all. Administrators said the decision not to increase the price in the coming year was gla.dly received. Freshmen at Wil- liams, Justin Crowe said, \While it's important to use the wealth of the college to protect for the future, it' s g<lod to know that the administra- ti()n is looking out for present day students as well. The decision not to nise the comprehensive fee is fum proof that the administration is doing just that\ So why then is Williams' an- n()uncement so contoversial? The a11swer is simple. Because as col- le~e prices soar into the tens of thousands, colleges must take all nessecary steps to maintain a high e11rolhnent. Since the 1960's and 70's, col- lege prices have risen faster than the rate.ofinflation. This increase came about because many colleges h:a<l to keep up with the rising rates of the mortgages on their build- ings. The average rate of inflation f<lr a college's cost from one year to another is seven to nine percent. In recent years, Ullion College President Roger H:ull has de- creased Union's rate of cost in- crease to three percent A college's cost is a tricky fig- ure to compute. Unian has estab- lished a sophisticated and thor- ough system to ensm·e .that its fi- nal cost to students pr-ovides value per dollar, not cheap education. The Board of Trustees, Budget Planners, and the Ptiorities and Planning Group, made up of fac- ulty, staff, students, and adminis- tration determines the final cost at Union. \Union College has maintained a fiscally responsible outlook on its cost and lean and mean reputa- tion when it comes to price,\ says Ann Fieming Brown. While Union's Ad.missions De- partment does not plan on re- sponding to Willia1t1s announce- ment this year with a :freeze of their own, it is always a possibility.

Page 8 ·January 13, 2000 · QILTUCnrhlensis • Leaving a Legacy As we entered our last term as Editors-in-Chief, we reflected upon the • time we have dedicated to the organization and opted to reserve the · editorial space for ourselves this week to explain some thoughts we have. When we accepted this position we held high hopes andbright.ideas for the transition of the paper into a new realm of journalism. We under- stood that to improve the quality of the newspaper alterations needed to be made. We opted to change the strm:ture from the bottom up. By purchasing new equipment, such as computers and a printer, we facili~ tated the production of the paper. Additional purchases of desks and chairs introduced a professional atmosphere in our office that fostered a more productive and inviting environment for both our editors and their staff. Since we are both aware that our own writing talents are not necessar- ily of the highest caliber, we concentrated on areas of the newspaper we knew we could improve. We assumed that decisions such as these would make up for our lack of formal journalistic training and insight. Unfortunately, our attempts at organization and improvement seemed • OP/ED SHOW YO LA ·p_ SCHOOL .:;PfRJT) How To ... PE'EL. YDUP.

Although our role in the event was minor d ai . ai . : . .· Ien . en .• a . compared to that of the Student Forum and other campus organizations, we have been criticized by the Albany Times Union, the Associated · Press, Thr! New 'r'vrk Times and National Public Radio for our involve- ment m the study. These media outlets claimed our decision to partici~ pate in the study, which consisted on! y of printing the statements and pic~res ofthe fictitious candidates, compromised our journalistic integ- rity. Our response to these allegations was a defense of our actions coupled with an explanation of om relationship with the Student Forum and our necessity to fill the allotted pages for that particular week. In retrospect, it is easy for these professional news groups to explain what they would have done differently in the same situation. We have spent much time since the statements were printed at the end of October contemplating the alternative avenues that we could have taken in the situation. Playing out each scenario brought us to conclude that perhaps we should have considered our decision more carefully. This conclusion arose because we do not want the reputation of this newspaper to suffer for any reason. If its credibilty has already been compromised because of our actions we sincerely apologize. We neither intended nor wanted to have our actions discredit this organization. In saying that, we must mention that we stand by the decision we made and can only speculate that in encountering something like this again we would give more consideration to the consequences, though we may have arrived at the same conclusion. After completing two terms of our editorship and two weeks of our third, we can certainly conclude that we learn from each challenge we face. We have not always made the most appropriate decision during our tenure, however knowing that has prevented us from faltering more than once on the same issue. Our goal centers on our desire to ensure the success of the newspaper. During our remaining time as Editors-in- ('hief, we will attempt to further impmve this organization. When the 1ime comes for us to step down, we hope that our successors will be adept at handling situations like these if the occasion arises. My God wh;atis it? .... Can'tyou feel it? ....

OP/ED Gr:n:n:tl3rhi~~5is ·January 13, 2000 · Page 9 Media Agenda in Favor of The Pe tso na I 5! Controversy, Not Issues by MichaelS. M(Guire Copy Editor On December 10, 199'9, :p:re&iden\ tial candidate John McC<~.in sent a letter to the Chair111an of the Fed- eral Communications Cc()ltlrnission, WilliamE. Kennard. McCain wrote the letter because he is the chair- man of the Senate Commerce Com- mittee, and in his dealingswith the FCC, which his committee oversees, he has grown weary of their pro- pensity for long, drawn out courses of action. The media, and in. this case I pointto The Washington Post and The New York Times, has chosen to create a \story~' out of the Senator's letter because of:fue im- pact the FCC's decisiQnhadon one of his presidential campaign con- tributors. Paxon Communications, the contributor in question, wi;inted to purchase a Pittsburgh television station, and was await- ing FCC approval of the deal. As Senator McCain indicated in his letter, \The sole puroose of this request is to secute 5na1 action on a matter that has now been pend- ing for over two years. I emphasize that my purpose is not to suggest in any way how you .should vote -merely that you vote.\ Clearly, Mr. McCain was acting in his ca- pacity as chairman of the commit- tee that oversees a federal agency that was cau,ght ilp i11 a bureau- cratic lmot of inefficiency. He made no attempt to influence the out- come of the vote otbe1 tllan to re- quest that if no vote was to be taken in the forese~able future, then an explanation be offered. As he indicates in his letter, 11ot only was the matter unresolved for two years, but in addition, \I have in hand a copy of the public notice setting out the age11da for the commission's ope11 meeting on December 15. These applications ate not listed f()r con.sideration.\ Apparently the FCC had no inten- tion of moving forward on the mat- ter, either~ This .is a clear case of a senator attempting to stimulate solUe action from an .agency that he feels has draggl:!d its feet for far too long. It is alsQ worthnoting that Chair- man Kennard' sreply is often cited, most notably his classifrc;:ttion .of Senator McCain's letter as \'highly lillusual.\ It is not insignificant that \as chairman ofthe influential com- merce panel, McCain has often feuded with the agency that over- sees telecommunications policy. In response to a Boston GlolJe report about his Paxson ties, McCain ... called the FCC 'the least efficient, most bureaucratic, least responsive bureaucracy' in the capitaL\ (The Wa.shingto11 Post) Clearly there is no love lost between Senator McCain and Chairman Kennard. It is increasingly frustrating to read a supposed \news story\ in a majotnewspaper such as The New York Times ot The Washington Post and have to wade through the writer's opinion to get to facts of the story. The quote cited in the previous paragraph was only noted after Chairman Kennard was described as having \chided\ Senator McCain in his reply. In ad- dition, this journalist certainly can- not understand the inclusion of the following paragraph in a news story: \In many ways, the episode of- fersa classic example ofhow Wash- ington works, intertwi.nll)g cam- paign contributions, corporate lob- byists and a powerful committee chairman. For McCain, ithighlights the perils of 1'\l.lllling a campaign that stresses the evils of a system in which he aggressively partici- pates.~' (The Washington Post) Further, it is not until the very entl of the article that the author· acbwwledges the fact that a lob- byist from the firm hired by Paxon, Laony J. Davis, said, \All McCain is d()ing is saying you have no rig~t t() refuse to act. If the member .of CoE)gress with jurisdiction over the F(;C does:ri'thave an obligation to Wiiie that letter, that means the FCC has 110 oversight at all.\ (The Wash- inp;1on Post) While it may easily be :argued that it is in Davis's best iot~rests to defend Senator Mc:Cain' s actions, consider this: Ac-cording to The Washington ·P(Jst, \Davis'srole\ in Paxon's deal wasto \enlist support from Demo- cra.iic members of Congress, and he sa,id his flrm was responsible for three letters to the FCC - from R~ps.

'fie refused to do what Pa}!{son wanted him to do and take a JliOSition on the merits, unlike a n11mber ofDemocrats,' Davis said. 'If .<~nything, this exemplifies Sena- tor McCain's refusal to do the bid- diag of a contributor.'\ In light of this, it seems as though, rega:rd- less of whether or not Sena.tor McCain had received a contribu- tioJl from Paxon Corrnnunications, he would have been approached \).y the lobbyists, if only because o·f:his position as Chairman o.f the Co.lDffierce Committee. Since his letter did not attempt to sway the FCC's decision in either direction, h:is letter, as he claims, his was le- gitimate. Contrary to Washingion P()st Staff Writers Susan B. GLasser's and Dan Balz's slanted view this, in fact, is where the truth beos. Union's Affirmative Action- Policy On November 4,1999 an edito- rial entitled Union Policy: Reverse Discrimination, written by Michael S. McGuire appeared in the Concordiensis. The article focused on the last sentence <lf the Union College advertisement for the po\ sition of Vice President for Aca~ demic Affairs, which. included the Affinnative Action - Equal Em- ployment Opportunity statement The article quotes the last sen- tence of the job description which reads \Union College is firmly com- mitted to affirmative action and strongly encourages w()men and those who are members of minor- ity groups to apply.'' In contrast to the argumentpresented in the edi- torial, \strongly encourages;, does not imply that Uni()n discourages others not referred t() in the adver- tisement. The statement instead represents the fact that Union Col- lege is committed to equal employ- ment opportunity and is an ''Equal Opportunity Employer\. The Union College Affirmative Action Policy encourages just and fair consideration of potential em- ployees; placing this statement in a job description promotes an eq- uitable and .enlightened approach to providing equal employment op- portunities, given the history of racial, ethnic and gender bias/dis- crimination in America. Union Col- lege is committed to hiting the best., qualified candidatefor the position advertised. In order to ensure that historical patterns of exclusion against women and minorities are rigorously disc()uragedit is impor- tanttoassute qualified people from traditionally under-r.epresented populations that their applications vvill be scrupulously evaluated and se:riously considered and that their presence on campus (should they be selected) will be welcomed. As v.rith all Union College searches, an applicant (regardless of race, etlmicity, gender) not qualified for tlte position will be eliminat~d at tlte appropriate point in the review process. In an increasingly intercon- nected world, it is wise to appreci- ate and value different points of -view and representatives from di- -verse cultures. The policies of af- fb:mative action judiciously ap- Jllied insure that the best candidate fr<()m a broad cross-section of quali- fioed applicants will be selected for ~r:nployment at Union College.

Contributing Writer I vaguely remember an old high school teacher telling me that life was about change. This was prob~ ably about one year ago, as we, tae Class of '99, were getting ready t<> apply to college and start the first step of the rest of our lives. I can also remember my older friends fron1 years past that attempted to tell me what a big step going to C()llege was. I guess I never really understood, because I was totally unprepared for this new life that I started last September. I am not that much different from a rtyone else. I come from a small, sheltered, upper class town on Long Island. A private school that g.Faduated a class of thirty- two stu- dents last June. I've known the s.ame people all my life. During the week, my friends and I would go to school, engage in some sort of ath- letic competition, and go back home, where our parents would nurture us, take care of us, and guide us. On the weekends, my friends and I would go to a party, smoke a joint, and find the nearest Dunkin Donuts. Everything was structured, planned, almost rou- tine, and we were content. That is all behind us- everything that we had in our Jives has changed. We were told what to <lo. how to do it, and when to do it. But for the past five months, we have been trying to learn how to structure our own lives. All the rules that constructed our lives in high school are gone. Since Sep- tember, the entire freshman class has been in a testing period. Nota test of facts and figures, and much more crucial than any SAT or AP exam. We are seeing ifwe can live a fulfilling and productive life by ourselves, propelled by our desire to thrive and succeed. The first lesson that we had to teach ourselves at college was to have the strength to avoid. tempta- tion. On a beautiful night in Sep- tember, do we want to be reading books in the library that seem to drag on and on, or do we want to throw back a few beers with friends? Yes, reading the Holy Bible in Freshman Precept is quite stimulating- but so is staying up to watch the sunrise with a girl that you just met. The choice to be made is easy to say, but very hatd to go through with- we must find the delicate bahmce between work and play. Work too much, and you will miss the actual college experi- ence, which is so much more than Intro to Psych and Chern 10. Play too much, and you will slowly find your life slipping away from you into an abyss of drugs and alco- hol. Of course parents, teachers, and friends have told us this be- fore, but no one can realize how strong that temptation can be. by Sl01an Miller S & T Editor media. Like some people around the world, do you believe that the twen- . • tieth. centu.ry has ended and a new · milleniurn.has been entered? Let rne There is an old cliche that you can never really appreciate some- thing until it is gone. After one · term, it is time for us to look back at what we never appreciated to the fullest before we entered this strange world. Morn, Dad, halfway decent food, our own beds, semi- private bathrooms with clean floors, cars, cable television, and, most importantly, time for our-. · selves. Time to reflect and ponder, time to sit and fantasize, and time to remember and cry. We have come to deal with the fact that a college life does not give us time alone, so we m\,lst look to our new friends and loved ones to help us with our troubles. Instead of go- ing through things by ourselves, we now go through them with each other. This misunderstanding was seized by marketing agell.cies which saw enormous economic opportunities. Tremendous mar- keting campaigns were launched proclaiming the deals of the cen- tury or finaloffers ofthe millenium. Saul Alinsky, a radical activist in the 1970's, saidinRtdesfor Radi- cals that \Change means niove- ment. Movement means friction. No movement 'or change can oc- cur without that abrasive friction of conflict\ Alin~ky was right~ change is never easy nor is it smooth. But in the lastfive months, we have come to accept it, to em- brace it, and to live by it. We have survived, and we have started to grow and prosper. We have gone through a huge transition period together- and we have all made it through. We are no longer the high school Class of '99, but instead we are rtow the Union Class of '03. help you shatter this illusion.

France's military satellite system had a Y2K bug which affected fault detection pro- grams. The French defense mmtstry reported that there was no operational im- ardous material. Other glitches in the computer systems of major companies across this country were as follows: a com- puter glitch in an Arkansas nuclear power plant affected access to the plant's restricted areas. No safety hazards were experienced and the mistake was ftxed. In Philadelphia; Amtrak's Control Center was un- able to identify some trains on its tracks but the service continued without problems. The largest concern for com- puter glitches in the United States was the computer systems of the numerous small busines:~es throughout this country. Accord- ing to The New York Times, a customer returned a videotape in Albany and was charged $91,250forkeepingthetape for 10() years. Some slot machines shut pact. A hospital in Norway re- ported that an X-ray machine had failed. The New York Times reported cash registers in a few convenience stores and A TM machines also failed in Norway. In Turkey, haifa dozen companies listed on the stock exchange reported Y2K problems. There are approximately 300,000 cash registers used in Ga·eece and ten percent were not Y2K compliant. These computers were printing re- ceipts showing the year as 1900. The West African country of Mali reported that its railway system was disrupted b.y computer problems. Y2K analysts guessed that chaos would reign in South America's poorest nations. However, they did not consider the low level of technology. In South Korea, huge apartment building justt south of Seoul went without heat for several hours. The computers at a hospital near that apartment building recorded a babtfs birthday as January 1, 1900. In Japan, a computer system designed to monitor the perfor- mance of a nuclear plant failed. A Y2K glitch in Japan caused prepaid train card machines to stop work- ing in a few stations. Taxi meters brcrke down in a China province. Eg~t' s national news wire service briefly stopped filing. In Australia, an amtomatic bus-ticketing machine ceazsed to work. These were only a few of the reported problems. F()r the most part these Y2K computer glitches were minor in comparison to widespread problems that could have occurred. Most of the problems that were mentioned in this article were rep<tired in a matter of a few hollrs or days.

DVD Encryption Lawsuit by Steve Ayers Staff Writer The uniqueness of the Internet has forced a reevaluation of principles long. since settled in other media. The most recent case ofD VI) copyright protection inv<llves free speech and intellectual property in a dispute be1weeli an association of large media corporations and 500 web site owners. The setting of this case is Santa M()nf:.ca, California, on December 29, where the DVD Copy Control Association attempted to file ah injunction against 500 website owners aqoss the world for publishing or linking to a program which would allow computer users to decipher the information on Dvns. DVDs are disks that contain movies in a hi.gh resolution forrrtat that can be played on computers ot special players. The information on the disk js encrypted in the CSS fo11Ilat, and can only b.e read by hardware Ol' software that contains the decryption algorithm. The software program DeCSS allows users to decrypt the information on DVD disks. The program was originally compiled ,in Norway as a result of the efforts of several groups to design a DVD player for the new Linux operating system. At the time, users ofthis operat- ing system were unable to play DVD movies on their computers. The only way that these groups were able to write a DVD player was to reverse-enginee:r a Xing DVD player. Once this infonnation was obtained, one of the groups used this information to make DeCSS, which wouldall()w all us- ers to decode the infom1ation on DVDdisks. Naturally, once this program became available, thousands of web sites copied the program and generated links to it. For hackers it was a dream come true, and for the motion picture industry, it was their worst nightmare. The CSS format was designed specifically to avoid the possibil- ity that hackers could make high-resolution copies of DVD movies,. and many companies had allowed movies to be published with the assurance that this would not happen. Events escalated even further when the DVD Copy Control Association sued web ~ite own- ers who published the program on their sites or linked to sites w :here it was available, accusing them of stealing trade secrets. They unsuccessfully sued for a preliminary injunction, which would force the web sites to stop publishing or linking to the program. With support from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the suit was defeated, and we are awaiting the final battle on January 14, at which point the actual·trial will begin. The DVDCCA states that it is attempting to protect a trade secret, but it seems the greatest trade secret here is the weakness of DVD encryption. Merely silencUl.g those who have already proven this fact will not stop those truly interested in copying DVD movies on a large scale from breaking the encryption all over again. Also, while the attempt to shut down web ~ites with the actual program on it is understandable (at least when they are within the jurisdiction of the United States), shutting down websites that link to these sites is clearly upreasonable. A hyperlink 1s merely shorthand for a web address. The difference between \http://www.trip.to/web\ and <a hre f=http: J /www. trip. to/ web>trip.to/web</a>\ is negligible, and banning the latter will not stop the latter from being published. More importantly, the purpose of a hype:rlink is nothing more than conveying a textual piece of informltion, and it is difficult to see why the first amendment wowld not protect this. The DVDCCA expresses a legitimate interest in the protection of original work, and this is beccrning a pressing concern in the development of the Internet. A~ information is more widely available and easier to distribute, artists with a legitimate interest in th.at ii1formation should be able to contro 1 its spread and compe.nsated for its use. One migllt even go so far as to say tlJ.at Internet users should respect this right, and recognize that colltimlally copying work hurts ad[sts and will eventually have a chilling effect on their use of new electronic forms. Even though the DVD emcryption has been broken, there a-re still barriers to copying it. Decrypting and copying a DVD roequires a powerful computer a.nd a lot of time, and this will serve as a deterrent in the near future. As computers become rnore powerful, many new challenges will be faced, and the best way to answer these is with open criticism and dialogue. The protection of i.ndividual rights ultimately relies 011 the belief of the people.

We Survived Y2K, But What About Jennifer Lopez? by Dan Centr Contributing Writer As we watched the illuminated ball slowly descend in Times Square to mark the beginning of the New Year, and more impor- tantly the millennium, some re- ligious zealots around the world were eagerly anticipating the end of mankind. Whatever source they drew from to arrive at that cone! us ion, there were many that assured us that this would be the last time we ever watched Katie Couric cover that outrageous party in New York City. Though their waiting seems to have been in vain, an Armaged- don of sorts has occurred in terms of our culture, and specifi- cally, our music. We're continu- ing to drown amidst a sea of in- excusably released music, and it may only get worse from here. A new Millennium is a strange thing, in that it's generating an amount of reflection in my friends and that I've never seen before. More now than ever, I often catch myself reminiscing about the way things were, echoing someone who has reached middle age or be- yond. For me, and I'm sure for a lot of us, music seemed so much more exciting in the days when we were younger. MTV, still in its in- fancy, was not yet a corporate machine depending on stylish im- ages to make money. Music vid- eos were an exciting new art form, attracting some of the brightest and most innovative young directors around. Iadeed, I still remember seeing A-h.a's \Take On Me\ as a three year<Jld in awe. Ironical1y, however, MTV ltas been destroyed by the artistic sub culture it h.elped to create, and it's dragged popular music along with it. The q~tality and originality of the pool of artists currently at fhe top ~f the,billboard chart ha,ve be- come emb-arrassing. The do-mination of Britn~y Spears, Jtmnifer Lopez, and the Backstreet Boys along with tlteir three million clones leave little room for .anything that would ~p­ peal to someone who isn't twelve years olda11d a girl. I blame MTV for this, f{)r no other .station bas their fmgers on the pulse of what sells thnthey do, or the influence over yo11th to perpetuate this mad~ ness. Tb.ey've supported the no- tion thai ihe true merit of an artist comes from what type of clothes they wea.r and how well they can emulate the current \hot\ :musical style. I pity the talented musician in today' s world without a market- able image, and lord knows there's plenty ()tlt there. The Buggies may have been more p1qphetic than they realized seventeen years ago: video really has killed the radio star. The good news, however, is that all trends will eventually collie full circle, and this age of teenie bopperism will disappear as quickly as it surfaced. There is a gre~ter test than record sales to det~nnine the artstic impact of this c\l~Eent crop,. and that's time. Thi:rty years fyom n.ow, who am~ngthis motley group will en- dwe? My guess is none, but only time will tell for sure. Eventually, a record executive willgrant someprotnisingbutun~ kn!)wn artist a deal, and they'll usli()r in a new style that will for- eve:rchange rrmsic, as N:irvan;:t did witb· Nevermind. It may happen soon, (}r perhaps witilin years, but until that day, Cl!t;Pton, Hendrix, Nirvana., Bowie, Queen, The Rolling Stones, and tb.e loads of other geniuses from tb.e better days of music will spin in ()ur CD players, just as they have for all these years.

It is two in the morning; I have to be in class in approximately six hours and twenty-five minutes. My body is refusing to morph back into workweek mode from week- end mode. Unfortunately, this is a result of the fact that my weekend and weekday lives dangerously over- lap. Over our long winter break it is easy for one to forget how quickly one's life can be drastically altered in the span of one teeny tiny little weekend. Two weeks ago life was simple and carefree. This week I have been brought back as my recurring character in my self titled soap opera. Well, college certainly does keep you on your toes. What is it with winter term, any· way? I thought it was only winter term freshman year where all lives were drastically altered. Appar· ently, if this weekend is. any bit of a prelude, I was horribly wrong. So, in honor of this upcoming term I have compiled a short list of reasons why winter term is sucb a turbulent time in Union College life: 1: Everyone has had six LONG weeks to contemplate life. Most people manage to pinpoint those parts of their life at Union that they do and do not like. The majority of students come back with some type of resolution to make a change. 2: Some stages of rush begin. No further explanation needed 011 this one. 3: CoupleshavehadsixLONG weeks to assess the status of their relationships. People's breaks were boring, they realize that they miss people. People get together. In the same sense, some people's breaks may not hav~ been that boring. People breakup. 4: 11is cold outside. We begin to hangout with the people we live with moie and more. Those Jleople who you do not live with who still come 1(); ~>ee you are the ones you get extra close to. ChaJtces are your group of friends ~ill be at least fifty percent changed by the end of the term (this is one that I think mostly ap- plies to freshmen .sorry guy$!) 5: Freshmen will flliall y .real,. ize j~stllow small campus is when everyon~ stops playing nice. 6: All of the above considered, people .start to get real and life does eventu11lly get better! So lets all prepare ourselves for the Blizzard (have those signs been bugging anyone else to the point of insanity?) and be aware cf.the trials that come with another lovely winter term!

Break gave me a time of solace and peace, and I returned to the crea- ture comforts of a Korean home that has been a friend since my childhood. Break gives me the opportunity to get back to my Koreanside, a part of me thatca.n- not be denied or rejected. All my friends back home in California are Korean. I go to a Kore~n church. I frequent Korean restau- rants and eat such obscure things as fried eels, cow tongue, and other things that the Western persuasion might fmd unusual. To me, they remind me of my home. They re- mind me where I'm from. I may be an American citizen, but my blood and ethnicity are Korean.. I thrive on what is Korean. It gives me a level of comfort I cannot find in mostly Western culture. I ~m beginning to think that I am a cc:m- servative Korean male holdmg on to culture and rituals to make a sense of what life is for me in i:h.e UJlited States. I push myself to learn more about my culture, and keep up with Korean· pop and so- ciety. I keep up with the language, and grasp fiercely at what I fmd familiar in myself, which is the essence of Korea. I fear that if I lose these things, that I will lose a part ~a.f my..self. ·My Korean heri- tage allows me to live in wh..at I think is the right way to live. I respect my elders. I do my duties as a filial son. There are a number of things I am required to do that I hold on to like God di- rectly gave me commandments to follow. I know I will marry a Ko- rean woman. I know my role will be as provider and caretaker of my family and my parents. I feel that this is the right path for me to take, and I fight fiercely everyday to retain this right. As I am to gr~du­ ate this year, I feel a stronger :urge to be the man I am supposed tE> be. I cling more to the demands made of me by my culture and by my ancestors. I feel a stronger pres~ sure to be dutiful and follow the path expected of me. The pressure is enormous, but at the same time it is comfortable. I would not change anything if I had the chance to. Speaking of Korean women, I know that I will need the appxoval of my parents to marry a certain girl. I know that in order to keep my grandmothers happy, I will have to marry a woman w1to is Korean and knows the traditions and doctrines that come with be- ing a Korean woman. I have ac- , cepted that. Korean traditions and culture is my security blanket in a society that seems to have no bounds. I know that most of my life; the teachings I have learned and mastered are that of the West- em philosophy and idea. How- ever, 1 fmd that the eastern teach- ings and philosophies leamed at home are mote enduring. I always guard myself from losirtg that which is Korean. I know that if I lose this, I lose my heritage. This means that I must dare to be dif- ferent. God knows how many times I have had to pay for being so. I am always glad when I meet a fellow Korean. It do.esn't really matter if I know them or aot. I could pass a Korean that I don't know in the street, and I am happy and express good will to him/her. Only so because we are alike, and we ar~ in similar situations. Be- ing a.min()rity in the U11itedStates · can be hard sometimes. However, · I would not change anything if I could.

Wherever it quite as loud, which brings me to takes me, I know the road will the conclusion that this species of point me in the right direction. blackbird must be indigenous to th.e Union College Campus. Seri- ously, most people would expect birds to fly south for the winter,. and yet for some reason they haven't. Where I'm from, which is only about forty-five minutes from campus, the blackbirds al- ways fly south, so how is it that these birds don't? That is a ques- tion worth answering. Nmv, certainly not everyone on campus is a science major, al- though I've noticed that the col- lege certainly puts more emphasis ()ll science than anything else (have you noticed the fact that tlJ.ere's an entire complex devoted tc science while there are only two small buildings which look like shoeboxes devoted to all of the hwnanities and social sciences?)~ F()r all of you who haven't seell the labs in the basement of Science aad Engineering, I strongly urge you to check them out. I say this because I believe it is these labs that originated the gian1 b~ckbirds flying around our earn- pus. All kinds of incredible experi- ments go on down there, and there is at least one radiation lab, S() wh::Y cou.ldn't this he the cause ()[ th·e birds? And naturally if the bircls were created right here at the c<>l· lege they just might not want to leave. After all, this is where the birth ()f their species took place. Alld as for the cold, well that really tloesn 't matter because the birds are so big and pr()bil!bly have thick plumage. That a11d the fact that the radiation from Science and Engineering prob<2bly gave them some special ada,prtation to protect them from the C()ld_ The last thing to consider is where these birds get their food from. Actually tlut really doesn't require explanation as this is the City of Schenectadiy, not to men- tion that there all'e more than enough food-filletl garbage cans around. Clearly, food is not a problem for these birds based on the unwillingness to go anywhere else. So what exactly am I getting at with this article 011 blackbirds? Your guess is as g;o10d as mine. But seriously, there is a point here, which is to make people aware of the giant blackbii!Is flying around campus. After al!, 1 wouldn't want someone to be attacked by a bird, seeing as how Iife is not supposed to be based 011 a movie (if you don't know the rnovie l'm talking about then you d.on't deserve to fmd out). 1 don't suppo.se there is a solu- tion to being constantly woken up by these birds, as tltey never leave campus and I ce:rtainl y don't want to kill them. I think the rea1 problem these birds pose is ~ith our squirrel friends here at Union College. After all, the sqlllinels may be rest- less, but they're still a lot more fun than giant blackboirds

Page 14 · January 13, 2000 · Ongoing Custody Battle for Cuban Refugee by Philip Cho Staff Writer On November 25, 1999, the rem- nants of a small raft washed up at Key Biscayne~ Florida. Seven Cu- bans trying to make it to the United States apparetltly occupied the raft. Three ofthese refugees, including a five-year-old boy, were hospital- ized after being found on inner tubes off the Florida coast; no other survivors were found. For the time being, the boy was al- lowed to stay with his great uncle in Miami. On November 30, 1999, the Cu- ban government stated that they wanted the b<Jy back .saying that he is a victitn of kidnapping and must be returned from the United States to his father in Cuba. The Cuba Foreign Ministry and the boy's father demanded his return to Cuba. Cuba contended that the Coast Guard officials had received a Cuban message that notified them to look for the refugee boat on the day before it capsized. This statement turned out to be true. The Coast Guard, however, said that it searched unsuccessfully for the craft for two days after receiv- ing the Cuban report. The boy, E\ian Gonzalez, has started a tug-of-war battle between the United States and Cuba. U.S. immigration authorities formally released Elian into tile custody of his relatives in Mial)li. Elian's rela- tives have hired a lawyer and are seek.ing legal guardianship. U.S. offidals said all three survivors woald be allowed to stay in the United States. On December 13, 1999, the United States certified that Gonzalez was indeed the father of the boy. Two days later, U.S. immi- gration officials be~an a high-level review of the case of the 6-year- oldboy at the center of an interna- tional dispute. U.S. authorities ac- knowledge a govetnment decision to repatriate the boy to Cuba would trigger court action by the youth's relatives in Floridachallenging the decision. Government lawyers say litiga- tion in both federal :and state courts in similar cases has. sometimes de- layed resolution of such cases for several years. This case has raised questions oil botlt sides of the ideo logical spectrum between Cuba and exiled Ct~bans. Havana has demanded that the boy be sent back and has mobi- lized thousands of.Cubans in dem- onstrations calling; for his return. President Clinton said he did not want politics to in1erfere with the custody decision. Cuban President Fidel Castro stated that the United States was committing \a repugnant and mon- strous crime\ by keeping the boy. On January 5, 2000, the US. immi- gration officials in Washington said they determined the boy should be reunited with his father in Cuba. Lawyers for the Miami relatives of a 6-year-oldCuban boy asked the Justice Department and the White House to block the de- cision by immigration officials to send Elian Gonzalezbacktohisfa- ther iB Cuba. In reaction to the decision made by the INS, on January 7, 20()0, Representative Dan Burton, RM[n- diana, the chairman of the Hou.se Government Reform Committee is- sued a subpoena for Elian Gonzalez to keep the 6-year-old Cuban b<>y in the United States atleastuntila court hearing. The Immigration and Naturaliza- tion Service is studying the Con- gressional subpoena issued for 6- year-old Elian Gonzalez to deter- mine whether it has any effect on its ruling that the boy be retumed to his father in Cuba by January 14,2000. White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said the INS decision \was based on the facts of the law.\ He added that this matter \should be considered on tile facts\ and \not in the political arena.\ An INS official said that, \It appears. that the subpoena wi:ll have no impact on the ability of INS to carry out its decision.\ As of January 10, 2000, the Florida family CO'\irtjudge has tem- porarily granted custody of6·year- old Cuban refugee Elian Gonzalez to his great-uncle, pending a full hearing at the beginning ofMarcb. The judge said Elian 's father in Cuba should be noti·fiedofthe hear• ing and said that she will change the date ifnecessary to acco111IEo- date him. The judge said she was convinced the boy would face im- minent harm if he were returned to Cuba now. Lawyers for the great-uncle asked the judge to appoint a guard- ian for Elian who would be able. to apply for asylum i1'1 the United States on Elian 's behalf. The rul;.. ing ordered by the U.S. Immigra- tion and Naturalization Servic~ said Elian' s father is the boy's guardian. and is the only one who can speak for him. In this matter, I believe that tlte INS made the right decision, and that Elian should be returned t() Cuba to his father. Even though it is the case that Elian' smother and stepfather died while attempting to get here, Elian's father still has rightful custody of the child. This case has no validity in the political realm, and Cubahas a right to ask for Elian who is in fact a citizen of Cuba. I think the subpoena has no merit, and tbe boy should be returned by Janu.ary as stated by the INS. The subpoeua should have no weight on the decision that is to be made. Po1itics has no role play- ing guardianto people that are not its citizens. The Cubans are not in a situation for asylum. C11ba re .. tains its rightto .ask for the boy. If it was found that a United Stat(!s boy was found in Cuba, I assume Cuba would return the boy back to them. We should do the right thing and tetum the boy to his fa- ther. The United States governmetlt a.nd President Clinton were rightill not getting involved in this case. This is an ii:11ntigration matter re- served for the INS. If Elian hap- pened to be a 24-year-old, and Cuba demanded his return, we would most lilcelyretorn him. I believe that Elian's relatives, the judge., and the lawyers are wrong in trying t<> keep Elian in the United States; Only the father has rights as the legal custodian of Elian. The United States is not in the position to keep the boy and make a legal argument for it. The only thing to be done is to return him. Yeltsin Steps Down; Putin Steps Up by Stephen Nemeth Stqfj\Writer While many countries and their leaders celebrated the dawning of a New Year, Russia entered the New Year not with a bang but with a whimper as a pale and apologetic Boris Yeltsi11 announced his resig- nation as President. This move cleared the way for Prime Minister Vladimir Put in. 4 7, to become Presi- dent at least until March 26, when new elections are expected. Y eltsin, who was expected tore- main in power for at least six months, apj>eared on national tele- vision at noon on New Year's Eve instead of !tis usual late night ad- dress. He appeared frail and ill; a sight that most Russians had grown accustomed to seeing in their President, yet he also seemed focused. He began his speech and quickly announced the stunning news, \Today on the last day of the out- going centllry, I resign. I am step- ping down ahead of term. I under- stand that I must do it and Russia must enter tbe new millennium with new politicians, with new faces, with new intelligent, strong, ener- getic people, and we who have been in power for many years must go.\ Immediately after the speech Yeltsin left for his country resi- dence and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called for anemergency Cabi- net meeting. As part of the trans- fer of power, Yeltsin handed over to l>utin the ''nuc:lear briefcase,\ which contains the launch codes for Russia's nucle:ar arsenal. 'The resignation ()[Boris Y eltsin was. received in Washington at 4:00AM on New Year's Eve. Na- tional Security 1\dvisor Samuel Berger informed the President al>out an hour later. In a statement Clinton hailed Yeltsin's \historic te11ure\ and said that he looked forward to working with Putin. \Under (Y eltsin 's)leadership since 1991, the Russian people have faced the unprecedented chal- lenge of creating new institutions and building a new life after de- cades of corrosive communist rule,\ Clinton said. Clinton also put Yeltsin 's presi- dency a on a grand scale, \His last- ing achievementbas been disman- tling that communist system and building new political institutions u11der democratic:ally elected lead- ers within a constitutional frame- work.\ Clinton said th-e US-Russian re- lationship had yielded \genuine progress'' during Yeltsin 's term. He pointed out that both sides' missiles are no lionger pointed !!t each other and that over 5,00() nuclear warheads had been dis- mantled. He also acknowledged tba:t the relationship between the two countries bas also had its rocky times over Chechnya and economic recovery. At one point, relations between the two conn- tries reached a level reminiscent of the Cold War when Boris Yeltsin reminded the US and the worldthat Russia was still a very formidable nuclear power. Y eltsin swept into power as a Communist Party maverick who advocated capitalist refon:n. He was overwhelmingly elected in May, 1991, and was reelected de- spite fading popularity over the Communist Gennady Zyuganov iu 1996. At the time it seemed that many Russians preferred to live under Y eltsin' s scandal-tinged ad- ministration then return to a Soviet past. However, as the years went by. Yeltsin' s popularity as well as his health began to fade. He repeat- edly took long vacations from his presidential duties to undergo health treatments. He would often burst into view and then fade from sight, at one point during his cam- paigning for a second term he was seen dancing with a rock band and then a few weeks later he went to a local \sanitarium\ to relax. Only after he was reelected did it become clear that he had suffered a heart attack. He continued to dominate Rus- sian politics despite his ill health, frequent disappearances from the public view, and Intense opposi- tion. He easily defeated a Commu- nist effort to impeach him and dis- missed four Prime Ministers in the last two years. Within the past year, scandcals have rocked the Y eltsin adminis- tration, so much so that he hac been looking for assurances for the safety ofhimself and ofhis family prior to his resignation. His family and particularly his daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko, have been linked to allegations to corruption and insider dealing. A few of the major scandals in- volved the funneling of IMF money through a New York bank and the alleged insider activities involving a European firm refur- bishing the interior of the Kremlin. Prosecutors in Russia and Switzer- land have been investigating these activities. In his speech, Yeltsin appealed to the Russian people for forgive- ness for the errors ofhis adminis'- tration and some of his unful:filled promises to them. It was a highly unusual admission from a leader who rarely admitted that any elf decisions were wrong, \I want to beg forgiveness for your dreams that never came true. And also I would like to beg forgiveness not to have justified your hopes,\ he said. He also expressed that it was pointless for him to stay in offi()e fot the remainder of his term be- cause Putin was weH suited t<> take over. Yeltsin expressed confiden.ce that Russia under Putin's leader- ship would continue on the path to democratic reform and not re- vert back to its authoritarian past. \I shouldh 't be in the way of the natural course ()[history. To cling to power for another six montlls when the country has a strong per- son worthy ofbecoming president - why should I stimd in his way? Why should I wait? It's not in my character,\ Yeltsin said. Vladimir Putin;a fonner KGB of- ficer, is now seen as Russia's most popular politician and the most qualified to leaCI it. He has enjoyed success where others had failed- the Russian quagmire of Chechnya. His no-nonsense style and ability to bandle a hard fought war have won him the respect and admiration ·of many Russians. They feel his demeanor and exper- tise are well suited to tackle the large problems that Russia is fac- ing in social, economic, and politi. cal areas. Putin has already announced that he would continue reforms ini- tiated by Yeltsin. \I'm absolutely convinced that if we abide by the principles that have become the cornerstone of our development • a liberal economy, free market, hu- man rights, respect for our neigh- bors and respect for our partners all over the world, then Russia will be able to occupy a prominent place in the future community .of nations.\ Wo ] Laf Unit~ untm litica getsJ the t mess foral ()ther gun, .eight Th ''Ne' cuse: Will1 tic n shire tiom takir New ary mon som' T cen1 in it The cou line troc set( on: de~ the the 1 stat Cart Ru: anc Ian Ru ac1 Ch otl: tot fr< tic ce af th de VJ be m th F1 in ru C! di ia ti n p

' Olanuor.Mensi!?' • January 13, 2000 ·Page 15 Democratic and Republican Primary Update by DavidCnmer StajfWriter Last yearwas memorable for the United States. Our economy saw unprecedented prosperity, our po- litical fortune resulted in a bud- get sU:11plus, and ill foreign affairs the United States continued its message offreedom and humanity forall mankind. Ontop of that, an- other Presidential election has be- gun, ending President Clinton's eight years in office. The year 2000 is now upon us, a ''New MillenniunL,\ whereby cau- cuses, primaries~ and·conventions will consume much of the domes- tic news. Iowa and New Hamp- shire are the first two such elec- tions, the Iowa delegate caucus taking place onJ anuary 24 and the New Hampshire primary on Febru- ary 1. Over the past several months, each candidate has spent some time in both states, zealously campaigning their name and their respective platforms. Calculated predictions have been the result of such campaigning, as polls have meticulously decided who will win each race. So far, according to, the latest CNNIUSA Today/Gallup Poll,.Gov- emor George W. Bush seems to have the Republican nomination at his disposal, closely followed by Senator JohnMcCain(R-Arizona), who has increased his approval rating by twenty points over the past month. On the Democratic side, Vice ·President AI Gore con~ tinues to lead former Senator Bill Bradley by a slight margin, yet the tide could tum especially after their latest debate in New Hampshire whereby th:e former Senator seemed to have been the better manthateveptng. When Republicans match up against Democrats, both Gov. Bush and Sen. McCain beat out Gore and Bradley, another indica- tion of why a liberal White House in. 2 00() seems unlikely. Too much distress has taken pLace over the. pasteightyears, as Americans are fed up with Ctintonite Democrats. Botl1 Gore and Bradley won't hear of such discussi()n and there- fore continue to pr()nounce why they are the best man for the job. Justafterthe worldwide New Year celebrati()n, both G()re and Brad- ley hit tile campaign trail, Bradley declaring himself as a viable can- <lid:ateableto·offer \a world of new p~ssibilities\ after seven ye!lrS of the Clinton-Gore Administration. On the other hand,,Gme offers him- self as a tested natioaalleader who h.asgreatly impacted Washington, the C()Untry; and world for that matter at the hands <lf a Republi- c,an Congress. Argui:ngagainst the C:andidate Bill Brailley, himself, Gore~1ated, \I believe that on many i:ssu1;1s, he has the wrong plans ... and on some critical issues lle has no plans ... Senator Bradley seems t<~· believe America can ad- dressonlyonethingatatime.\ The Democ(a1ic race is sure to stir up even more emotion as the race progresses. The Republicans debated as well, making it well aware that Sena- tor Hatch CR-Utah), fonnet Reagan administration appointee Gary Bauer, conservative tycoon Alan Keyes, and multi-millionaire Steve Forbes area long shot at receiving the RepubLican nomination, leav- ing it up to either Governor Bush (R-Texas)or Senator John McCain (R-Arizona )to grab the nomination. Senat()r McCain may have the experience and know ledge to run the country, but has not received as much money or endorsements as the Texan; most recently, he wit- nessecl a former presidential can- diclate, Elizabeth Dole, endorse the govern(}r. Bush's response to Dole's endorsement? \Elizabeth 'Dole has an appeal to all voters ... she's one of the few people in the business who is liked by all wings of the party and inde- pendent voters.She is one of the few people who, when she makes an endorsement, it can move people.\ Only timewill tell, though, how much impact this may have on the Republican field of nominees. That, in a nutshell, is the presi- dential race up to this point. Each candidate has narrowed his plat- form, attacked his opponent(s ), and raised more money than any other presidential election tha1 this country has ever seen. The lead- ers have begun to emerge, the pub- lic has taken notice, and President Clinton has continued to shame- lessly rescind any sort of leader- ship. The race will undoubtedly heat up in the next few weeks, as votes will begin to be tallied thereby strengthening the polls, maki11g it more apparent as to who will win on November 7, 2000. Russian Military Stalls in Chechnya by Charlie Tutthill StaJJWriter The.Russian military has re- cently swfered a series of setbacks in its war against Chechen rebels. The rebels have made a series of counterattacks behind the Russian lines, which have.lFft:RQssia,n troops· in confusion ... The recent\ setbacks, most of which occurred on Sunday, have led the Russian defense minister to announce that the army will'l'e~jjme air_attacks on the Chechen taprtal of Grozny. The Russian offensive, which started in June? has made signifi- cant progress in Chechnya. The Russian armies have moved into and occupied the country's low- lands with little resistance. The Russian army~ however, ha8 coll?e across fierce resistance in the Chechen capital of Grozny, ancl other areas of the Caucus region. The seeds of the current conflict date back to October 1991, when Doku Zazgayee, the local commu- nist leader was overthrown. Fom:ter Soviet air force General Dzhokhar Dudayec, who daimed that Chechnya was independent, re- placed him .. Russia; however, did not recognize Chechen indepen- denc~. 41 De<;ember .of 1994, Boris· Y eltsin sent troops into Chechnya . to quell th(!l independence move- ment. The dispatching ofRussian troops started the first Chechen war, which ended in an August 1996 truce. 1'he terms of the agree- ment required Rus~ia to pull all of its troops out of Chechnya. The agreement also deferred the ques- tion of national independence to five years in the future. During the brief period between the two wars, both. interior and ex- terior pressures marked the politi- cal scene of Chechn.ya. Dealing with each of these forces was Chechen President · · Aslart Maskhadov, who became a target played a roleinhisdeGision totem- for both sides.

She says that '\the war had a face\ and vivid pictures which contributed to \anti-Krem- lin sentiments ... both in the press ... and in society.\ Live im- ages such as the ones from the 1994 war, however, are now hard to find in Russia. Many believe that the numerous kidnappings of Rus- sians in Chechnya have deterred many journalists. Reports of the war, however. continue and have shown that the conflict in Chechnya is still far from over. Snow, ice and mud, as well as other weather conditions wllich have affected Russian air power, have bogged down Russian forces. The recent counter offensive by rebel forces has also set hack the Russian progress. With winter conditions intensifying, an end to the violence is not in sight. Croatia Takes Step Toward Democracy by Dan Kirsch Staff'Writer The Wai'-tom'Republic of Croatia took a large step toward recovery from the Balkan Wars with its na- tionwide parliamentary election re- cently, which took place shortly after the death of long-time an- thoritarian and nationalist Presi- dent Franjo Tudjman. A more Western-friendly government has been elected, signaling the nation~ s more probable eventual entry into the European Union by 2004. Croatia, which seceded from tlle Federated Republic ofYugosla-via in 1990, was since its independence ruled under a nominally democratic constitution but in fact was subor- dinate to the rtt1e of its authoritar- ian president. Presidential elec- tions do not take place for another month, but it is thought that the parliament will gain ascendant power before the elections now that Tudjman' s political party has been resoundingly defeated in fa- vor of a coalition of Social Demo- cratic-Social Liberalc..small region- alist joint party listanda list of five small opposition parties. Ivica Racan, prime minister-des- ignate of Croatia, leadeF of the So- cial Democrats and head of the coalition, has pledged to end cor- ruption in the government, allega- tions ofwhich, in addition to so- called mana ties, have been plagu- ing the government, especially af- ter the Balkan and Kosovo Wars, which have had untold effects on the economy and foreign-relations standing of the republic. As of press time, the prime minister-des- ignate ex:pected the resignation of more than fifty top-ranking govern- ment officials in the next few days, all of which Were loyal to the HDZ (Tudjman~s party, the Democrats). Racall has stated publicly that he does not wish the five small list to have the same kind of input and authority his ScciaJ Democrat-So- cial Liberal list will, as his list con- troIs seventy seats. in the 151-seat parliament, where!ls the smaller list controls twenty-five. Racan called the request a ••ne~ation of the re- sults of the eJection,\ in whicll Racan's list bea.tthe small parties list and the HDZ, which will hold forty seats. R.acan, a longtime leader of the Social Democrats( former Commu· nists), frequently attended rock concerts in Croatia and pledged more solid ties with the international cotrtt11unity, as well as a new con- cetn for human rights. Racan, it should be noted, recently won full status for his party into the fourth Socialist International, the world- wide associatio11 of parties that adhere to basic socialist and so- cial-democratic doctrine. (The fourth International should not be confused with the third Interna- tional, known as the Communist International or Comintern, which was the Moscow-based .organiza- tion that provided the organiza- tional basis for the Soviet Union's control over all communist-domi- natednations save for China.) This experience in the international com- munity could be a factor in his new promises to enter Croatia into such organizations as the World Trade Organization and NATO's Partner- ship for Peace program. The electorate, however, are hold.i11g the new coalition to a sub- stantially high standard, and is likely to quickly tum on the coali- tion if it does not go through the necessary steps toward more pros- perity, notably privatization of state industries. Ill other Balkan news, the six- teen-Party Serb opposition, led by Vuk Draskovic and the Serb Re- newal Movement, has signed an agreement oil some basic reforms that they pledge to carry out should any of them be elected, and is using this agreement to put re- newed pressure on Yugoslav Presi- dent Slobodan Milosevic to call for new elections in the spring. The only policies they agreed upon other than the joint call for early elections were the somewhat con- tradictory notions of the renewal ofYugoslav membership in inter- national organizations and nonnal- ized relations with Europe, in addi- tion to there-stationing of Serbian troops in Kosovo. The latter seems impossible due to the out- come of Milosevic's defeat in the Kosovo War and the Allied occu· pation ofthe province specifically to guard it against Serbian ethnic cleansing of Kosovo Albanians. .,

Page 16 January 13, 2000 Glowing Reviews for M\an on theAroon by Jessica Brearton Contributing Writer Have you ever wandered through the mall and. wondered what would happen if you walked up to a complete stranger, gral>bed his hand; and started taLking to him like he was an old friend?' What would happen if you broke the unspoken rules that so deter- mine our lives? Andy Kat.tfrna11 seemed to live his life doing just that, finding out what wouldhap- pen, andtakingjoy in what he dis- covered. In the film Man in the Moon, Andy a:t one point says tha1 he thinks ofreality as an illusion, anci that p~ople tend to take them- selves too seriously. He ap))'ears to be on a crusade to cure pe()ple ofthis.~ttitude and make them re- alize the absurdity of their reality by completely destroying the rules that bind it. The beginning of the film <loes just that, in a very original opening sequence that left most ()f the audi- ence silent, some lauglting, some whispering - a general .air of \What's going on?\ 'Tl!is wasn't the way movies started~ and most of us were left wondedng whether it was a joke to be langhed at or something else entirely. This eon- fusion is seen in the alldi- ences faced by Andy e~trly in the film: seedy-looking bars filled with people ini- tially staring blankly as Andy goes through. bis routine of songs and imita- tions, but eventually .get- ting his joke and laughing along with him. Unlike most comedies, this 011~ gets fun- nier as it goes along, as we, the au\' dience start to get Andy more and more, until by the end we feel like we are as much in on 1he joke as Andy and his lifetime friend and partner, Bob Zmuda. But a life spent questioning and doubting the reality of reality leaves Andy himself somewhat adrift. If realicy is an illusion, than what is he? His answer seems to be that he, too, is an illusion. He goes :from scene to scene, becoming one char- acter after another, so that what his girlfriend Lynn says late in the film seems to be true; there is no re~l him. But is he nothing more than an illusion? Jim. Catrey tries t(J answer this CJUes1ion as well in his amazing per- f<Jrtn~nce as Andy. It's one thing t() do a three-minute impressian, s;omething Caney is admittedly very slcilled at, but it's.quite another t<> actually become a:nother person for the entire length of a film. Some- how he succeeds, and from th~ .first scenes we forget about Aee Venturaandbelieve him: as Andy. Carrey also succeeds at creating an emotional connection with the audience, sothatthrougll the near- constant changes in character, we never forget that there is a real man belrind all the illusions. The performances are generally excellen~, espe- cially Danny DeVito, Whe plays Andy's agent(allthe Taxi shots creatively leave out any mention or appear- .ances of Louie DePalma) and Paul Giamatti as Bob Zmuda. Courtney Love is also admirable in her performance as Lynne Margulies, Andy's love, though ·I would have liked her character to have been developed more. The viewer never really sees why or how she falls in love with Andy, and though both actors make the love believable, its development appears to develop mostly off- screen. Andy's tendency to treat the world as one big joke that not enough people were in on seems to backf:rre on him by the end of the film. His jokes become so elaborate that m;arly no one gets them,. and his credibility so nonex\ istent that when he, at age 35, an\ nounces that he has cancer, not even his closest friends believe h·im. The erdeal that follows causes Andy to question his ten- dency to deny the reality of life, especially when faced with telling his family abouthisillness. The film shifts easily between drama and humor, often allowing them to occur simultaneously, and its exploration of the complex per- s0n that Andy Kaufman was is re- markable .. The film ends on an appropriate note, one in keeping with Andy Kaufman's life and legacy ef chal- lenging the status quo. Two thumbs up.

This victory marked the first tournament title in the program's history. an impres~ive accomplish- mcJlt for the Dutchwomen. Coach Mary Ellen Burt is pleased with her team's success so far this year. She explained, \I think the team is playing a lot better than they were last year. We're executing better, we'rcplaying better defense and things are kind of falling to- gether. We just haven't played a whole40 minutes ofbasketball yet and that is something we need to work on.\ Union kicked off their season on November 19, 1999 at the Roches- ter Invitational after the majority of Union students headed home for a six-week break. In their first contest, Union fell to Plattsburgh in a disappointing 75- 7lloss. Kathleen Furlong led the scoring with 2'1 points and 0 I i veiri tore down I 1 boards in the hrd-fought effort. However, Union only managed to shoot 38% from the field. Union bounced back the follow- ing day against Fredonia with a 78- 63 victory. McNamara pumped in 21 points in the victory, while Fur- :long earned All-tournament team honors. The Dutchwomen's victory against Fredonia sparked an excit- ing four-game winning streak for the team. Union overcame Smith College 60-43, Manhattan ville 58,. 46, and Utica 48-41. In Union's victory over Utica, they managed to hold the Lady Pioneers score- Less in the final nine minutes of the second half. Unfortunately, Union's streak ended in a hard fought battle against Williams College on De- cember 4, after Williams jumped to a 3 7-29 halftime lead. Despite the 68-59 defeat, Union played the tal- ented Williams' team closely for the entire contest. Coming off of a well played yet disappointing game at Williams, Union traveled to William- Smith for their .first UCAA game of the season. The Dutchwomert fell vic- tim to William-Smith's 72-home game winning streak, whose 85- 58 victory improved their national streak record.

Union beat Swarthmore. 92 -59, with Musella leading the charge with 20 points. Freshmen Phillip Henry came off the bench to score 19 points on 5- 6 three point shots.

In Union's first UCAA game, they battled against Hobart. Musella led the scoring spree with 28 points. He was just four assists shy of a triple double as he had 10. boards and six assists.. This' was the Dutchmen's six.th win in as many games and their best start since the 1990-l 991 season .. One day later, Union faced U CAA powerhouse Hamilton. Both teams came into the game sporting a 6-0 record. The winner would become the outright leader in the UCAA. The Dutchmen battled througnout the game, how- ever on their final possession,. they turned over the ball, and ended their wir'lnlng streak with a two point loss to the Continentals, 83- 81.

After an early lead, the Continen- tals strengthened their defense and were able to shut down Union's high powered'offense. The Dutch- men defense played strong, but Union was held under 65 points for the second straight game. Head coach Bob Montana said, \It's a long season. Of course our main goal is to make the post-sea- son, but what team doesn't have that goal. We need to take each game individually. Hamilton is over, we •need to think about St. Lawrence now \It was a t<)Ugh loss,\ noted Copeland. \We need to bounce back and look ahead.

Bills Suffer Another Plow While Redskins and Dolphins .Look to ,Upset by Brian Tedinsky Sports Editor For anyony who missed this past weekend's wild card games, all I can say is that Buffalo's playoff curse has con.tinu~d into tbt~ new millennium, Miami's Dan Marino isn't saying good.:bye to football just right and the Wash,:i:ngton Redskins are once again iri Super Bowl contyntion, which makes me quite h3rppy, being one of few Redskins falls on this campus. To be honest, I was basically half asleep during the Titans-Bills game on Saturday, savittgup my energy for the only garne, that actually meant something to me, the Lions- Redskins match--up. However, I had decided to catch a quick glimpse of tile final minutes of the first wild-card game and had just turned on the TV to see that Buffalo's kicker Steve Christie had put the ball tluough the goal posts, to give the Bills a 16-15lead, with only sixteen seconds left in game. Thinking that game was already over and the Bills had advanced to the next round, I decided to flip through the channels and check out the Satur<iay movies until the second g_ame was ready to start. Little did I know by the time I got back to ABC, I surprisingly saw the Titans celebrating like they had won the Saper Bowl. I had no idea what was ha;ppening until the re- play showed Kevin Dyson receiv- ing a lateral from across the field and sprinting towards the endzone byBenY~ee StajJWritet The college basketball season is still young and teams are just be- ginning to get into their coaference schedules, bnt it's never too early to assess the play of the teams ex- pected to loom large this March. While many people dislike the tough early season schedules and complain of sloppy play as new players are acclimated to big time basketball, much can be taken from the November/December games. Connecticut Uconnwas optimistic about the season as they returned several key players from their national championship team a year ago. In addition t() returning starters K.halid El-.Amin, Kevin Freeman, and Jake Voskhul~ tb.ey added a much-anticipated recruiting class. · Ajou Deng was said to be the best player ever recruited by U conn and he joined Marcus Cox, Tony Robertson, Justin Brown and Doug Wrenn to form a class that was to have immediate impact. Last year's national champions lost their best player, Richard Hamilton, a :year early to the NBA, and in their first game of the sea- son against a weak Iowa team, they appear~d to still be looking for their go-to man from a year ago. for the winning touchdown, with three secon.ds r~maining in the game; At first, many people felt the lateral was definitely a forward pass until replay showed the pass had been right on-the line to be con- sidered a lateral pass. I think ev- eryone had to ma!ce their own call, it was way too close! I'm sure all you :Buffalo fans were ex- tremely angry. · In an unbelievable ending for both teams, the Titans were exhilarated while the Bills stood in shG>ck and watched another season pass through their hands .. Bruce Smith after the game could not give a positive answer about his future sta- tus with the team. Who could blame him. Chan,ging divisions .· there's not mach to s about the .1'\_~u:H~:•u;~-L.ru•.t:~ game. I admit, itwas a boring and unexciting ball game to watch. I had called my fa- ther who was at the game on his cell phone and he was already on the beltway headi11g home after the Redskimi were leading 27-0 athalf- time. Stephen Da:vis made his re- turn from an ankl~.injury, only to re-injure himselfand is question- able for the game against Tampa Bay this weekend. I guess the only exciting part ofthe game was when · Tre Johnson accidently nailed the Back-Judge on t1le head, trying to settle a skllmish on the field. He was ejected but gave a thumbs-up totl_l.eexcited crowdatFed-Ex Field. With no one to take charge, the Huskies played methodically and lost, 72-65. Sincethelowashocker, Uconn has steadily improved. El- Amin has taken lt leadership role a11d they have developed a strong inside game behind Voskhul, Free- man and Souleymane Wane. Stanford After graduatin.g seniors Arthur Lee, Tim Young, a11d Kris Weems, Stanford was expected to be solid but not spectacular. After All- American candidate Mark Madsen was lost for 3-6 weeks to a groin injury in the first game of the Sea- son, even less was expected of them. Despite this, they won their first 11 games and are ranked in the topfivenationally. Why? The6'9\ Jarron Collins a11d shooting threat David Mosely are finally healthy and both have been productive. They join Jarron's brother Ja- son, and :freslunaasensation Casey Jacobsen, to lead a balanced scor- ing attack that has all four players averaging dciuble figures. Stanford has played virtually error free basketball and their unblem- ished record is proof. One thing their record fails to reveal, however 1 . is their competi- tion. Before their loss to Arizona this past weekend, they enjoyed a less than stellar early season schedule. They were lucky enough to play the inex.perienced Duke On Sunday. Dan Marino came out for Miami and gave it all he could, as he a,nd many others knew this could of been his last game. He lead a fourth quarter 85 yard drive comeback to beat the Sea- Hawks 20~ 17; in Miami's first play- off road victory in over 25 years. Seattle's coach Mike Holmgren did of8..:8.The pressure was surely on Troy Ail<rnan,ErrunittSmithand, of course,. Read Coach Chan Gailey. However, Minnesota was too domi- neering and beat the Cowboys, 2 7- 10, knocking Dallas out oftheplay- offs in the first round for the sec- ond year in the row. Just on Monday, Gailey's job · ·. the Cowboys was up in the air, after a meeting Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, which did not seem ~~~=~~l!lti=:' ;~to have gonetoosmoothly. not look very happy on the side- line when Miami's J.J. Johnson ran for a two yard touchdown carry with less then five minutes remain- ing. Miami was able to hold offthe Seattle offense lead by quarterback Jon Kitna, whomade some impres- sive passes all throughout the fi- nal quarter to. try to get Seattle back in the game-On the other hand, S.eattle only had 100 offensive yards in the entire second h.:\lf. And finally, the Dallas Cow- hoys,a frustrated team all through- out this season, who just barely reached the playoffs with a record team in their fustgame ofthesea- son and they walked away with one point overtime victory. Their most impressive win was against Aurbum. Ari~ona Arizona fans nave been waiting for this season to begin since the day 7'2'' center Loren Woods an- nounced he was transferring from Wake Forest two years ago. Woods has proven to be a solid but not great player. He needs to balk up before he becomes the dominant player Ari- zona thought they were getting. If Woods has left fans a little disap- pointed, Arizo11a point guard Ja- son Gardner, and fellow freshman small forward G-arius Arenas, have made up for it. Gardner reminds fans of another point guard who recently wore the Arizona unifonn and brought them their last na- tional championsllip- Mike Bibby. Gardner is a quick point guard who possesses great dribbling ability along with a smooth outside shot. Gilbert Arenas has surprised ev- eryone with his play, including the Wildcat coaches. Arenas slipped into the starting lineup and was named MVP of the Pre-season NlT as he displayed an array ofmoves to the basket. In addition to the talented new comers, Michael Wright and Rich- ard Jefferson are much improved Jllfillf!'ll He was .fired the following day. So looking ahead, we · have a pretty exciting week- end of divisional playoffs. It's going to be an interest- ing four games, with all eight teams having their own qualities that could r1ll·~nr•p them to the con- ference championship games. Let's start in the NFC with the R.edskins-Buccaneers game, Saturdayat 4:15PM. As of Tuesday, the Redski.ns offense could be without Stephen Davis, Cory Raymer and Andy Heck, which COilld cause pr<Jblems when protecting Brad Johnson. And not to mention the Bucs d~fense is one of the best in the NFL. However, if the Skins limit turn- oversandDavisisable toplay, we will see some good Saturday foot- ball. My scary prediction: Redski11s 24-Bucs 20. I;m sorry, I can't go against my hometown team. and they lead the team in scoring. Syracuse Syracuse returned .five starters including the 6' 9\ shot blocking center Etan Thomas. For Syracuse to be successful, senior point guard Jason liart must live up to the ex- pectations that have surrounded him sin~e he arrived on campus freshman year. While Syracuse is one of the few undefeated Division I teams remaining, their weak schedule has left them largely un- tested. [n addition to their weak schedule, they played their first game away from the friendly con- fines ofthe Carrier Dome this past weekend. Four players, including Thomas and Hart, are averaging over twelve points per game and Hart has been steady early on. He has shown more consistency with his outside shot and their bal- ancedscoring attack is a testament to Hart•s ability to get everyone in- volved. Thomas has been ham- pered by illness and injuries and had played in only six of the Orangemen's firsttengames. Jun- ior Damon Jones has continued to improve and is Syracuse's second leading; scorer. Mi(bigan State opened the sea- son without their All-American point guard, Mateen Cleaves. Few expected to hear frotn them until he returned in January. So111eone forgot to tell the rest The Rams- Vikings game, Sun- day at 12:30 PM. Vikings are the underdog but are looking better each week, However, the Rams are on a roll, with quarterba¢k Kurt Warner leading the way and Marshall Falk tearing up th~ field. I can't see the Vikings coming into St. Louis and pulling offau upset. My prediction: Rams 28- Vikings 14. In the AFC, Dolphins at Jag- ua!'s, Saturday at 12:30 PM. Dan Marino and the Miami Dolphins are coming off an upset win and are confident with themselves. The Jaguars won't let a bye week and this battle of Florida to overcome their consistent season. If Mark Brunell is able ~to be 100% and the running game with Fred Taylor makes the key plays, I feel Jacksonville will not be de- feated in front of 60,000 loyal and football Iovin' fans. My prediction: Jags 27- Miami 10. Titans-Colts, Sunday, 4:05PM. This was definitely Peyton Manning's year to shine and has led his Colts back into Supet Bowl ccmtention. Although the Colts diddhninish towards the end ofthe season, the bye week has giving them the chance to regroup and fill in any holes. If the Titans want to win, they got to stop Manning in every form and watch out for the Colts pass- ing game. I'm confident with the Titans after last weeks game .. I'm going for the upset in Indy. My prediction: Titans 30-Colts 20. of the Spartans. Morris Peterson carried them in wins against UNC and Kansas. Peterson is averag- ing nearly 17 points without Cleaves .... If you haven~t heard of Kenyon Martin by now, you didn't catch your fair share of SportsCenter over the break. Mar- tin is the 6'9\ shot blocking sen- sation for Cincinnati. Cincinnati has looked unbeatable at times and they handed North Carolina, Gonzaga, and Oklahoma convinc- ing losses. Their lone loss was a 64-66 squeaker handed to them by in- state rival Xavier. Cincinnati lacked their usual intensity and Xavier played inspired basketball after their leading rebounder, Aaron Turner, was suspended for aca- demic reasons ... At most schools, losing four players to the NBA and having one player transfer to an- other University would have re- sulted in hearing instant cries of a rebuilding phase. Not at Duke. Coach Mike Krzysewski took what was left in their talent pool and quickly molded it with several talented freshmen to form a team that can beat anyone. Shane Battier has blossomed from a solid defender to a great all- around player and Chris Carawell continues to be a reliable scorer. Jason Williams, the talented fresh- man point guard, has been spec- tacular averaging nearly 16 points. five assists and five rebounds. \-·

Both Men's and Women's Teams Too SJowfor Williams by Thatcher Woodley Staff Writer A lot has happened involving the Union'sMen's Swimming Team since the last time the campus was updated. The team has been flip- flopping between intense training and dual meets for the past eight weeks, finding challenges in both situations. Union kicked off its season by defeating the University of Roch- ester 120-119. The meet was close throughout and was not decided until the final relay, which Union won by a hair. While it was nice to come out with a win, many mem- bers of the team felt that the Dutch- men could have had a better meet. A week later the team hosted Amherst College. For Union swim- mers, this meet marked not only the end of the first term, but the begin- ning of their intense traininE; over break. It was a tough outing for the Dutchmen as they were just com- ing off exam week. That, coupled with the fact that Amherst's tecu;n featured older and more experi- enced swimmers, resulted in a 135- 98loss. There were some notable high- lights, however, as sophomore Kyle Schack won the 200 btltterfly. The 200 freestyle relay also fared well with a tim~ of 1 :33.5 8, just touching out Amherst's relay. Over the break the team trained for a month straight. The first two weeks of this training included two daily practices as well as mass con- sumption of bacon, egg and cheeses cooked by the lovely cooks at Dutch. Hallow. Tlle final: two weeks of our training were held in Sarasota, Florida wllere we not only lud the opportunity to swim outshdebut also enjoyed nu- merous hours on the sandy beaches of Florida. Mixed into an intense training schedule the team also man~ged to swimintwo meets. The first was the UCAA Championship. This meet is the second most important meet of the season. The Dutch- men stepped ap their performance level finishing second out ofeight teams. Every single member of the team dropped time. while ma:ny had personal in-season bests. More importantly, Union was !l'h le to avenge the close meet with Roch- ester. Union more than doubled Rochester's scm:e, beating them by 200points. Coach Judy Wolfe was espe- cially pleased with how the team was able to bounce back during the final session despite bein.~ sore and tired~ The meet was by far the best of the season for UpJ()n and helpe.d to itnpro:v:e team morale greatly. The second meet did n()t go as well U11i<1n traveled to Emory Col- legeQn the w~y back fromFlorida- to face the most improvedteam of the 1998-1999 season. Last year, Emmy fmished sixth in the nation. The:it tale1:1tand speed didnot fail them during their meet with Union, wimlilng, 163-65. All:ho:ti.ght:lletearnhasha:d some especially challenging me~ts, they are stitl confidellt that they will close out ihe year successfully. The team has several more dual meets before the big New Y o:rk State meet. The state meet is what the team looks fowardto from day one .. '\We bring it at States\ bas beem a connnon saying over the last few E;easons, andthis year will net he an exception. Senior Erin JVittes has enthusiasm duringsfJme slow tim.es on the team. Dutchwomen Set Sights High for End _of Season Swimmers Lookfor First Win at Hartwick on Saturday by Lauren Wander Contributing WJ·iter Taking at trip to the Union Col- lege web site and checking out the Women's Swim Team statistics, the results do not appear to be that extraordinary. As they lOok to- wards their final goal, however, the team is on the track to success in the season-ending State Meet. In November, the team saw meets against the University of Rochester where they were de- feated, 136-107, and Amherst Col- lege, where they fell again~ this time by a score of 135-98. Senior Erin Wittes won the 200~ yard Individual Medley against Rochester with a personal best time in addition to the 200-yard butterfly. Even though the loss was diffi- cult as the end of the meet neared, the 400~yard freestyle relay team ofKerry Librandi, Clewis Kinnett, Jennifer Hornsby, and Laureh Wander concluded the meet with a first place finish. Captain Kerri Librandi said, \I was shocked at how well everyone swam in the first dual meet of the season. Al- most everyone bettered their times from Union Relays.\ After tr:aining for a week and a half after the end of fall term ex- ams, Uuion hosted the UCAA. Champi()nships on December 3-4, 1999. The Dutchwomen finisheda strong thi!rd place behind longtime rivals Hamilton College and Roch- ester. Many of the swimmers showed vast improvements over last year's UCAA times. \I feel 'like the benefits of all our hard W()rlc and training are paying off,\ colllinented Captain Clewis Kinnett. ''With our times improv- ing the way they are, we wm be even better than last year.\ Followrng this meet, the team left for Saras(l)ta, Florida on December 6 for eight days of intense train- ing. With double sessions taking about five hours out of the day, the team reached around 96,;000 meters forthe entire week. Junior Rachel Miller defended the exces.- sive yardage by explaining, \We were all tired and it was hard work, but it will all pay off for States. That was the hardest weel< of the season, and now it's all d<>wnhill from here.\ The pain and exhaustion was somewhat lightened by n11merous team bonding events suclt .as sun- bathing.on the b~ach between prac- tices, deep sea fishing excu:-sions, and dolphin watches. \I made sure to send apostcard to Kilwin' s when we retumed from the trip, thanking them for their hospitafity to our somewllat de- manding crowd,\ said Junior Marni Loiacono. On December 15, theteamtrav- eled from Florida to Atlmta, Geor- gia to swim Emory University in their pool, which will host Nation- als this year. Visiting Atla11:ta was defmitely a bumbling experience for the Union Women's Team as seen from the somewhat unl>~lanced score. \'lfbis year's trip was the long- est in my five years here,\ said Co.ach Judy Wolfe. \With the meet at true encl, or the trip, I knew the gir]s would be ti.1ed. They com- peted the best they could under these circumstances.\ Returning from a short two-week brealc, the Dutchwomen competed in ~heir fourth dual meet at Will- iaills:College, losing by a score of 13(i-98. However, times from this meet were exceptional for this part of the season. Distance swimmer, Sophomore C()ri V enill, attained her in-season best time in the 500-yard freestyle. Other giils swam competitively, in- cludjng Wittes, the only Union willne:r, won the 200\yard indi- vidual medleywithatimeof2: 16.71. With times continually dropping, the team has a great deal of opti- mism for the remainder of the sea,.. SOli. With continual supp()rt from tearruna1es, the Union Women's Swim Team is on the path to suc- cess. This Saturday, the team will trav·el to Hartwick to compete ag:ainst Hartwick and Springfield College~ in what should be their best meet of the season.

Wells represents Social Science, Ann Anderson is from Engineering, Louisa Matthews from Humanities and Tom Warner represents Science. In addition, Dean Alford represents the Admin· istration, and Julie Wittekind '02, represents the student body. She was asked to join the committee by President Hull. The group's initial step was to attract possible candidates, which they did by advertising in the Chronicle of Higher Education, a weekly publication. Moreover, the committee sent out letters of intent to Presidents and Deans of vari- ous schools who share similar ranking with Union. This informa- tion is determined by twenty-five research institutions via surveys conducted by sources like US News and World Report. The efforts generated a solid re- sponse with a little more than eighty applicants. The next step was to narrow this number down, which was accomplished through relentless deliberation and critical review of applications. Eventually, the list was redllced to fourteen, the current number of applicants the group is presently working with. According to both Professor Wells and Wittekind, these mdi- viduals were asked to send in let- ters of reference which will further aid in the decision process. By next week, the committee hopes to cut the applicant pool by one-half, leaving seven possible candidates. Wittekind explains that \those seven individuals will then have to undergo an extensive phone inter- view, lasting approximately forty- five minutes, and from these we will nanow the number to three or four.\ Wells concluded by saying, \These individuals will then be brought on campus sometinte in ei- ther February or March for a two- day interview process between the administration, faculty and stu- dents...

During this ti.me, they realized that it woulcl be necessary to keep all the rest of the students on campus in order to fill the beds ofthose who left for the Winter Tenn. In the Spring, all students and parents were sent a letter explain· ing housing information The let- ter stated in bold print, \:\Jo cur- rent sophomore should sign an off- campus lease until permission has been given to move off campus.\ There was also an underlined sen· tence that said, \[Tenn Abroad Stu- dents] will not be notified of off campus status until late in the I'NQ Fall Term.\ For these reasons, Noonan advised the students not to sign anything until notificJ hy the school. Some wncerned Term Abroad students went as far as getting lawyers involved. Unfortunately. Conti11ued on page 3

He com- mented that he had received some, yet minimal, experience dealing with the Web while in college. Morse was faced with the chal- lenge of creating his first web site during one of his previous jobs as the Director of Alumni Relations for a university in Indiana. Morse commented that he learned how to create the Site by \default.'' This jab, along with another, which brought bim up to New York State, helped him gain the skills he used to produce Union's site. Morse is the first to hold the title of\Web Master\ at Union; his pre- decessor helped set the building blocks for Morse's current job, as Morse has done for whoever moves into this post. Web site. Morse expressed his enjoyment in the time he has spent at Union and hopes that he has left behind • the \building blocks\ for someone with possibly more experience. Morse will be moving on to another job in the \web arena\ at First Al- bany, where he will be directing web activities for the brokerage . firm. Union President Roger Hull, who conveyed the importance of Dr. King's work in all our lives, opened: the presentations.

Mark W erblin played \Typical Situation\ and \Don't Drink the Water\ on his guitar, both songs written by Dave Matthews. Mark told the amazed audience that : Matthews was actually born in .. South Africa, and his sister was murdered in a Civil Rights movement when he was a teenager. In fact, \Don't · Drink the Wa- · ter\ is actually . about Native· Americans be- ing removed from theirhome- lands when Eu- ropeans popu- lated the United States. Jamera Simmons sang \Precious Lord,\ which was Dr. King's favorite song when he was prejudice on February 31. Three of Union's faculty mem- bers also made this Martin Luther King, Jr. symposium a memorable one. Professor Kimmo Rosenthal, the Director of the Academic Op- portunity Program, played \'Sum- mertime\ on his saxophone. Pro- fessor Carolyn Mitchell, the Direc- tor ofWomen's Studies, read from and spoke about Michael Eric alive. Renee \'\.: ~· ='-' Dave Meguerdichian Alana Benoit reads to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. day. Rinaldi recited a poem written by George Dyson's article in The New York Times Magazine. And Dean Trish Williams read a poem about King's assassination. The Symposium ended with a short presentation by Vinie Bur- rows, a part time actress and a Rep- resentative of the United Nations on the Rights ofWomen. Burrows read a speech by Dr. King's son against violence, and a poem writ- ten by Langston Hughes in the late 1930s.

These students picked excellent pieces to express feelings of jus- tice and equality for the program. Like Memorial Day or Veterans Day, Martin Luther King Day usu- ally means little to those not directly involved with the holiday. But the tribute to Dr. King made many stu- dents take two hours of the holi- day to realize and appreciate what King has done and is still doing today- wiping out the cold walls of discrimination. During the few moments of si- ... continued from page J lence given to record the answers, it was quite obvious that audience Other students recited poems that they had written themselves pertaining to Dr. King, like Eric Pearson and Devon Wimberly. Geneviere Mbamalu read a piece by Jamal Tyson that encouraged the general public to take action against prejudice in the school, the state, and the government. Cequyna Moore spoke about the case of Amadou Diallo, the man who was shot nineteen times by police officers last year in the Bronx. Moore reminded the audi- ence that the trial had been moved to Albany, and encouraged every- one to come rally against police the school is protected against any fiscal obligations because of the regulations set forth by the Stu- dent handbook. The Union Col- lege 1999-2000 Student Handbook declares that \Students who ... participate in a Union CollegeTerm Abroad are still bound to the stipu- lations of the residence contract when they return from their term abroad.\ Near the end of the last Spring Term, many students plaDiling to go on Fall Terms Abroad met with Noonan to discus future living ar- rangements. Noonan claims that he ''made no promises and<liscour- aged people from signing leases.\ But' 1 i1e also told them that some students who left for Terms Abroad in the past were released upon ar- rival. He knew \there was confu- sion in the past [so he told them he would] let people know the new policies as soon as possible.\ Mike Cizenski is one of the an- gry students who was not released when he got back from his term abroad. After the ambiguous con- versation with Noonan, Cizenski signed a lease for an apartment around the campus. Unfortunately, while abroad he learned that he would have to pay room and board for living on campus. Sharon Rosemark also was de- nied a release from campus. Over the summer, she signed a lease with two of her friends and planned on living off-campus this term. Cur- rently, their apartment is vacant and all three girls are living on cam- pus. According to Noonan, concern- ing housing for this term, \Prece- dence has changed. It is less thtt.n ideal to have students paying for two places.\ This situation is af- fecting many students. Dean Alford thinks the reacti()n by the students is \unfortunate. But the college was explicit in tenns of the rules.\ He thinks the prob- lem resulted as a \combination of people drawing the wrong conclu- sions.\ members were searching deep within themselves to find their own answers. Heads bowed, eyes closed, every individual was at- tempting to fmd a contribution that they have made or will attempt to make to pave the way for true equality. Many students stood in front of the symposium audience and de- livered speeches, read poems, or sang songs.

Cam us News . . . New Director of Alumni Takes Over by Allyson Kohlmann Staff Writer It has been said that Union has a strong attraction to students even after their stay at Union is over. Such a statement indeed for alllll11li, such as the Winter Gala in New Y m:k City on February 5, a reunion in West Palm Beach,. and visits to campus. These events not only help create connections for cmrent students, but they also proves true for Nick Famulare.~\\_. ~~~~.,.,~~~~\'7i-~~ '92. After a brief stint as an Admissions officer at Vassar.

''Titere are manyways that an alum- nus/alumna can become involved, volunteering in the Career Devel- opment Center, organizing reunion athletic events, and interviewing for Admissions. in their home towns,\ said Famulare. Recently, there were events in Boston and New York City where Union graduates living and work~ ing in their area met with current Union seniors to discuss job hunt- ing techniques, interview tips, and survival strategies for living in a metropolis. This year, the Alumni Relations office will sponsor several events allow alumni to help their school. Another organization that Famulare and his staff are proud of is the Golden Society. It is made up of grfl.duates of the last decade. One of the largest events that the Alumni Relations office coor- dinates is Homecoming. Accord- ing to Fa.m.ulare, this is a tUne for graduates to revisit the campus, look up former professors and classmates, watch sporting events of the teams to which they used to belon~, or take a stroll down memory lane in Jackson's Gardens. Union is excited to welcome F anmlare into this new position and hopes that he can revitalize alumni !'elations on campus. He is excited md will do a fine job.

Furthermore, the job also entails the supervisionofpart- time and graduate programs like GMI, MAT, and Continuing Edu- cation. When asked whether or not Dean Sorwn would remain at Union if she did not gain the position, Wells Explained, \Ultimately she stil1is a member of the Classics Depart- ment, which allows her to continue teaching the discipline.\ Likewise, Sorum can also return to her former position as Dean <lf Arts and Science, but whatevn the case may be, the decision is. en- tirely up to Sorum. In response to the comment of Dean Sorum's automatic instCJ.Ila- tion, Professor Wells stated, \Most long term positions at schools undergo a national se2rch as a way to ensure they get the highest quality.\ The search un- derway here at Union is no differ- ent. In reference to Sorum's candi- dacy, Wells finished by stating that \having stood the test of a nati()nal search would make her position even stronger.\ Although Sorum appears more than able to permanently take-over the task, an official and extensive search ensures the well-being of the college, as well as to exercise fundamental democratic princi~les.

InJulyof1976, Union's Athletic Director (AD} resigned. An eco~ nomics professor was then ap~ pointed as interim AD_ He stepped down in.. December of 1976. An assistant to the Dean of Student's Office then took over the position until Sakata was hired in July, 1977 _ Sakata entered during a fragile time. Union's Hockey program was rekindled in. the 197 5-197 6 season. The head coach, Tim Harkness, turned the team into a very suc- cessful program in a very question- able manner. The program sparked a great deal of interest throughout the community and Union .Hockey games sold out regulary. The Presi- dent of Union College at the time, Tom Bonner, had hired Harkness in the hope that he would generate interest. Harkness was successful, br.inl ging incredibly talented I \';)(' hockey players to the program, however their academic standings were questioned by many faculty. Harkness wanted Scholarships and Division I status. Faculty were upset and the community was split. Sakala, who had no experi- ence with hockey at Coluntbia, was put into a tough situation. Harkness wanted everything, how- ... co~ttinued from page 1 ever the board voted to keep the team in Division III. The C()ntroversy b~came more heated when Harkness resigned on December 23, 1977. The team was on vaca.tion and when they re- turned in January, the team met off campus with Harkness. He was able to convince twenty-six of the twenty-eight players to leave schooL Suddenly Sakala was left without a team. As Sakala pointed out, \The irony of the situation was that I started a J .V. hockey program that falL As long as we had stu~ dents wb.o were interested in play- ing hockey, we would have a team.\ Union dropped their Divi- sion I ()pponents such !iS North- eastern,. Boston University and University of New Hampshire. Despite the initial collapse,. Union fmished. the season with a team. Bob Driscoll, who oversaw intramu:rals, took over the coach- ing reig11s when Harkness quit. In the spFing, Sakata hired Charlie Morris()n. Morrison built a very successful program, appearing in .the Division HI title game in 1984 andgo:ii.J.g totheFinalFourin 1985, which was hosted at Union. Sakata claimed that the resigna- tion of Harkness was the best Christmas present he ever re- ceived. \I can look back and smile at it now, but when it happened, it was very stressful. It turned out to be the best for the program, and made the hockey team a better pro- gram.'' President Bonner was asked to leave, mainly because ·Of the hockey situation. Even as a rookie in Union's Ath- letic Department, Sakala handled the crisis like a true veteran. It was just a glimpse of the dedication and determination he would demon- strate during the next twenty-three yeus. While talk:ing about his position, Sakala noted, \I have worked with the most supportive group of peoJlle during the last 23 years. Also, the student-athletes have been such a pleasure to be around. It's the personal part .ofthis job that I will always remember.\ K.evin Sneddon, the men's head hockey coach, said, \I was shocked when he first announced it. It was a very emotional time when he said he was retiring.\ Sneddon talked about Sakala and his involvement in the hockey pro- gram. \He is responsible for build- ing this team into a Division I pro- gram. He has been the backbone of this program and been the one consistent supporter. He always been there whenever there were Union's Sports Information Di- rector George Cuttita echoed Sneddon's remarks, \I was shocked, but not s-urprised.\ Cuttita continued, \We are losing a great leader, a n:mn who has al- ways been there, both profession- ally and personally. I am happy for him, but it is sad f()r me and the whole department. We'll miss him.\ Looking back <ln his years, Sakala mentioned some of his fa- vorite moments and accomplish- ments. \Surviving the h<ickey cri- sis my fust year is very memorable. Then to see the prog1am built into a dominant power in Division III was very exciting. The move to Division I capped it off_\ He also spoke about the football program, \Football has been a !Jig part as well. Starting in 1982, tile team be- camevety competitive. Since '82, the team has won eighty-two per- cent of its games and been to the postseason of some sort twelve times. It is a flagshippr<Jgram and a qualityprogramas well\ Sakata, who Jllayed a huge role in the for- mation of the UCAA, says that was a huge accomplishment. The fa- cilities have also imp:roved dramati- cally over his tenure. Sakala also played a significant role in the success of the gender equity that started four years ago. Sakala continued by explaining that he believes the coaching s.taff the Athletic Department has t()day is the best they have ever had. He added, \I am also very prone of how our coaches have gone Dtl to bigger and better things.\ Sakala had thought about retir- ingJune30, 2001. With many aew facilities in the works during the upcoming years, however he thought the new Athletic Director should play an integral role in the development. The College will put a committee together that will search for a new athletic director. Sakala said that he has asked not to be on the se- lection committee. The College will conduct a national search aiJout which Sakata stated, \We will !let a good pool of men and women for the position. I would be disap- pointed if we didn't.\ He will i.J!ter- view the prospective directorsand meet with them, sharing his ()pin- ion only when asked. Sakala has given six moths notice, but :adds that if Union has not hired a re- placement at that time, he will stay until they hire a new director. Sakala ended by saying, ··r couldn't think of a better way to spend the last twenty-three y-ears. Union College has treated me: well and it has been a honor to work here.\

Students: Speak Out Last week Concordiensis published an article about the new W<lb site, The Daily Jolt. The Daily Jolt may be found at http:/ www .dailyjolt.com. On theW eb site, there is a section called Forum The Forum is designed to allow students to comment on any issue that tb.~y choose, and th.ey may opt to do so anonymously. Two of the topics that are in the Forum are \Concordiensis\ and \journalistic integrity,, or la.~k thereof.\ The latter topic stems from the issue of whether or not Concordiensis was within the bounds of journalistic ethics in printing the statements that were part of a Union student's independent stady last Fall. As a tesult of the publication of those statements, as was discussed in last week's editorial, Editors-in~ChiefBrooke Barylicka:nd David Brooks appeared on Natimul Public Radio to defend themselves. The purpose oflast week's editorial was to explainConcordiensis' p()si- tion and offer its view now that we have the ability to look back ()nit months later. Many people seem to have opinions about Concordiellsis' . response, and have voiced it on The Daily Jolt's Forum. OP/ED No offense ....

I wonder ifl will ever be able to pick up a paper without reading about how ignorance and hate have de- I am very concemed by what I have seen lately. People have started to study history in order to repeat it. Look at Pinochet: many aspects ofhis reign are identical to other dictators, like Hitler or Stalin. A formula is being formed on how to create an effective fonn of geno- cide, not to mention get away with '~------------~~------------~ Between the years of 1973 and 1990, one man's powt;\:r destroyed the lives of over 2,000 pe()ple in Chile. I am left dumb- fowu:l~d and embarrassed by my ignorance, sad- denedandangrybymynew~found knowledge. For those of you who are as un~ informed as I was, here is a. quick overview of what happened and the current situation. (If you are interested, I would suggest the BBC profile on Pinochet c111Tently on. the Web: a much more thorough e~arnination of this man's .disgust- ing, continuously manipulative dimb1opower.) In.Novernb(!l' 1973, there was a military coup in Chile and the armed forces established a new government called tlle Gov- erning Military Junta. Pinochet was 1he President of this government. ()vet the course of his presidency, he created prisons and co1lcentra- 1ion camps and killed any figure·that threatened his power. He gave him- selffull executive power ami rigged a plebiscite in order to approve his new constitution that would make him president for the ned eight years. During those eight years, he de- veloped a powerful government and, once again, people who were not supportive were killed After his long reign, in 1991, the Truth Commission (the Retting Commission) submitted a report stating the injustices that <Jccurred during his rule. Since tlmt time, Spain has tried to convict P'inochet of the charges brought against him but have been held back by legal process and regulations. (Funny how something that is supposed to be effective in providiiigjustice can also allow people to get away with murder.) For the past fifteen months, stroyed more lives. 1 don't expect world peace or perfection, nor would I want that I am :from San Francisco and love the diversity of the world I live in. I am asking for people to exercisetoler- ance and understanding and keep an open mind to learn about oth- ers. These are human traits we need to embrace more often. Hatred; ig- norance and evil can be abolished, and. I assure you, the world will s1ill remain complicated, imperfect, and exciting. Should I accept the \extermina- tion\ process as a natural course of human behavior? Is it simply another aspect of the Darwinian principle of the survival of the fit- test? Or, have we created our own monster? Is it really instinctual to do whatever it takes to win, whether it involves cheating? If so, what kind of values are we instill- ing in our future generation? How do you know where the li11e be- tween survival and winning is crossed? Who will take the blame? Is it really as simple as blaming media, or parents, or has this prob- lem slowly grown into sometlling we can't control or destroy? I always thought the education of history was a positive step in the right direction. I spent last year teaching high school students it! What me$sage will we send to people if we do not punish Pinochet for what he has done? Thatyoucankill2,000 people and die at the ripe old age of eighty- four? Even-jf they charge him at his deathbed, he needs to hear that what he did waswrong. That he is, in fact, a murderer, and that he de- stroyed the lives of innocent people. If we allow him to \win we are once again reaffirming the benefits of evil. I have been studying the Holo- caust since seventh grade. I have gone and seen the concentration camps in Poland and have taken courses dealing with genocide. Throughout this time, my emotions have swayed. I have wanted to walk away, and at times I have, (i.e., recently.) The emotions have be- come so repetitive from fighting them for so many years. It has been frustrating never finding an an- swer; never being unable to solve the enigma. I have had breakdowns and breakthroughs. Yet, I can't tell you how vibrant and fresh the pain has become after reading about Pinochet. I used to complain ofbeing shel- tered by my parents; I used to crave knowledge and awareness, always wanting to jump on the shoulders of everyone else, and see what they saw. Now Iwonderifishouldjust walk with my head down, avoiding everything aro1Jlld me. Yet I know that by doing that, I might miss the lightning, but I will also miss the beauty of the rain that comes with it. I know the answer seems clear and uplifting in the sirnplestsense, but at times, I still must question why. I suggest you do, too. Clarification of Affirmative Action Position . ' At the end oflast term lwrote an article entitled \Union Policy: Re- verse Discrimination. 11 Urtfortu~ nately, many have misinterpreted the intent behind this article. A large number ofthe resp<>nses that I have heard and read h~ve criti· cized rrty article based upon the fact that .most, if not all, C~dvertise­ ments for positions of employment in the business world would in- clude such a statement and there- fore the school is not at fault.

Dealing with Tragedies and Losses Robert Pinsky by Thatcher Wootlley Contributing Writer Being a distance swimmer, I of- ten get the question, \What do think about when yo\1 swim?\ I suppose this is a fair q11estion, for it is very boring watching the dis- tance races during a meet as they last for up to twenty minutes and practi<:es are even lon.ger. While I may understand these GUestions I can never really ans\Wer them. I guess I don't really think about anythjng when I swim. Last Fri- day was different however. Last Friday, I prayed.. I prayed about two things dur- ing Friday's practice. The ftrst was a personal matter. The second thing that I prayed for was Molly Hatcher. You see, M()lly Hatcher was ()n the way back from her train- ing trip with the rest of the Kenyon swim team last Thursday when the van hit a patch of black ice. The driver lost control of ili.e vehicle as the skidded into the :gtuardrail and rolled over twice bef<lre coming to a rest. Ten of the passengers were injured, of which two were air lifted out and rushed to th.e emergency room. Molly Hatcher was not that lucky.

Snow Patrol by Brian Kern Staff Writer Before I begin this week's ar- ticle I feel it is necessary to address something a friend mentioned to me. What exactly is the point of my short stories? After all, I was told. I don't have a ••column,\ and I don'twriteaboutthesarne topic, or amything for that matter, on a regrnlar basis. Well, the truth i:s that the pur- pGse of my articLe each week is to brin:g your attention to some aspect of 1 ife, not necessarily here on campus, in an amu:sing, but hope- fully not cynical, way. If you get a laugh out of this then I have suc- ceeded. N;ow that this little item of busi- ness is out of the way, let's get to this week's amusing topic. P-erhaps you've noticed that we had some snow this week? In fact, it is s~owing as I write this article. Mo:St people are used to the snow, myself included. I don't know aboout the rest o{ the world, but I thought it was pretty common to shovel or remove the snow in some fashion from walkways once the snow has stopped. Apparently that isn't the case here at Union. I'm not asking formuch;just some salt or sand on the walkways is all, but that must be too much for the col- lege to handle. Fortunately, though, enough people walk on them to pack it all down so my feet don't get wet every time I go out. Now you must be wondering where I'm going with this, seeing as how I just said I wasn't going to be cynical. Brace yourself, here comes the amusing twist. Do you remember the leaf cleanup just this past fall here on campus? It seemed like everyday the mainte- nance staff was out in full force, eradicating all traces of foliage from .the paths around tb.e campus. They were constantly raking around the various plantings so as not to miss a single leaf. Some- one told me their favorite piece of equipment was the giant vacuum truck. I hadn't thought of choosing a They're just starting out here, even though they tllblk that they have it aU figured out. · Then, last Thursday, I was bom- barded with comrnell1s like \Why don't you write anymore?,\ \I don't read the papet ever since you stopped writing.,\ \li<Jw come: I favorite piece of equipment,. but you have to admit ihat thing was kindofinteresting. A:llyway, there they were, everyday, picking up the leaves. Had it e-ver occurred to them that this was completely um1ecessary? I me~~ does any~ one care about the leaves? In fact, they;re fut:i to walk through and nice to look at. And besides, the squirrels had a good time playin~ in the leaves. · · · · · catt't fmd your column?,\ and \If you don't start writing again you'll be eating all your food intrave- nously.\ So, I decided to give it another try. I will certainly not be writing every week, but I will try as hard as I can to writ-e ()ften. Here aresome ,tips for all of you second term fres:hmyn: 1. You think you have it all fig· ured out? You don't know s**t Trust me. Hubris is a fatal flaw. Get prepared f()r your friends to start pledging. You'll spend less and less time with them until, eventually ... You must realize that when people stop hanging out with eachother due to pledging, it's not anything person.al You just have to make time to hang out with each other, outside of school events. If you are truly friends with each other, then you will not completely lose contact with tllis person. That happens When you move off cam- pus. 2. There actually ARE things: to do here. s() getoffyour lazy spoiled ass and find those things. You know what? You don't even need to find anything. Just keep your eyes and ears open in the Campus Center, there are many signs on the walls. In the last few years, I have complained in this col- umn about many things, but never about not having the abil- ity to go out EVERY night of the week. You don't like the frats\? Then there's 1'uesday nights at Coffeehouse; Wednesday night discussions at Symposium, Thursday night dinners at SmitD:l House, Friday nigl11 dinners anod poetry readings at Kappa Alph.a Literary Soci-ety ... the list goes on and on. Get yourself away from chat rooms and Nintendo and you' 11 realize that human contact is be1· ter than cyberspace. You miglht even be able to drink at some of these events. Ifyouhave further questions on your options her·e,. drop me an e-mail at aronowm2@union.edu or a hu- man mail at Box#0040 and I will get back to you promptly. 3. Contrary to popular belief, there is no '\popularity\ here. While at times Union does re- semble one of those High Sch()ol TV shows, Freaks and Geeks and BlaekPants and North Face and Superfieial:i.t}\' on the inside, most people have the same fears amd ·problems as you. If anything:, Union resembles a clique systeM where no clique cares enou.gb about other cliques to force a ' 4 popularity system.\ Anyone who So what r~m getting at here: is why can't the maintenance staff put that same kind of effort illt<> cleaning up the snow? It's liilc.e they wear themselves out with rtlte , leaf cleanup and have- no ene.-g:y to take care of the snow. All I ask for is some salt to melt it, or even j:ust a little sand so 1' won't have t<l worry about fallitlg on my way 1:o class. Or perh:aps classes could be cancelled M:Xt :scilo,()l. 4. Those people's names that you forgot over break ... either -re\' member them and start having ae- 1\lal conversations or just give up. Y ou:'re going to be here for tlrree mane years and you 'llmeet many new people. Every time I hear someone at a party, who is obvi- 0usly trashed,. start a convers~tiCln wi:tb someone that they've obvi- ()USiy met before, and then five tnin'lltes later ask them their name, it doesn't sit right with me. Either malce it a personar mis- sion to remember names or just cut :the crap. That's all the advice I can think of f()r now ... Sorry for the lack of pile11tiful humor, hut it's been a while .. I will leave you with an old sio:cy fi:otn last new year's eve. It was fimny last year and it's pretty tiumynow ... After the New Year's Phish show in MSG, we showed u-p at my- friend Jonah's house in New Jer~ey at 4:00A.M. What we saw weje the remnants of something tba.t resembled a party. We noticed a deep funk emanating frO>m the ins:ide, a vomitous, fecal matter smell, ifyou will. ;[asked what happened. It tu:rns oui that eight underage drink-ers had puked, and only three o f 1 them made it outside. Some puked on :to:iilet seats, some on the walls. It looked like everyone had puked inio a balloon, and someone poppedO it. But that is only the p:relude foJks. One of the \pukers!' had founcl his way up to Jonah's bed and passed out.

When I ftrst came to Union, the thought of eating alone, or walk- ing to the CC alone terrified me. I dealt with my fair share of separa- tion anxiety, although I never re- quired the presence of a \Bath- room-Buddy.\ As time went on, I realized that it was acceptable to he by yourself. My perspective broadened and I was able to look beyond the masses of poster children for the Gap and Abercrombie to conclude that many people were truly inde- pendent here. I saw that the inde- pendent people weren't necessar- ily the outcasts I had pictured in my mind, but prominent figures of the student body. This gave me the incentive I needed to raise my hand in a class discussion and say what was on my mind. It also gave me the motivation to write this article, even though mockery from my friends is inevitable at this point. By no means am I an Ann Landers nor do I desire to be, but I do have some words of advice for those who have yet to take the plunge to independence: Be selfish. Do things for your- self while you still can. In a few years, you may be married, have a career, or have to worry about the rent, but for now m<Jst of us have few obligations and responsibili- ties. So do what you wa.nt, you have nothing to lose.

One could almost say tha.t it's the discreet subject in all of my work\ Professor Hatke's interest in the Shakers is also consistently seen in his work, in paintings contain- ing Shaker furniture, as well as the landscape of the Shaker historical site near the Albany Airport after the Octoberstormofthemid-1980s. Professor Hatke spoke of his moves from area to area, which was reflected in the work shown - pa:intings ofNew York City became those of the Midwest, to those of Pennsylvania, and fmally Upstate New York. In the booklet men- tionedearlier, Professor Hatk.e says ofthis area, \Upstate New York is remarkable for its variety. There is an abundance of color here, punc- tuated by a great deal ofchange .. . Yet this is a region that seems to combine the essence.of many oth- ers ... There can be a brightness to this northern region, and there is also an extraordinarily haunting darkness.\ This variety is ex- pressed through the scenes Pro- fessor Hatke creates of New York through his paintings -· Winter, Fall, wa1erways, historical sites, and homes. The cover of John Arthur's booklet contains a reproduction of a work showing in the current ex- hibit - a postage sta~p with the words Art Saves Lives next to it. .Professor Hatke closed his talk by speaking about this painting. He expressed his belief that not only does art enrich people's lives, but that it also very oftensavespeople. The postage stamp was one that was traditionally placed on mail sent by Professor Hatke's friend, Robert Schoelkopf, whom he cred- ited as the first person -to show his woJk.

Israel-Syria Peace Talks by PhilipCho StajJWriter On January 17,. Israel and Syria peace ta,lks were sttspended. The talks, which were scheduled tore- sume on the nineteenth of the month·it} West Virginia, were post- poned due to the uawillingness 0f each side to compromise. Prime Minister Ehud Barakoflsrael is not planning 0n staying in the United States as planned. Barak was scheduled to conduct talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al- Sharaa and had planned to have a Washington summit with President Clinton and Palestinian President Arafat. Barak's office did not give a reason for the postponement or say which side requested it. No date ha::s been announced for the talks to resume. Nego.tiations in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, stopped suddenly on January 11 with no positive progress. Syria had said that re- sumption of the U.S. talks would be pointless without an Israeli pledge for a total withdrawal from the Golan Heights (captured by Israel in the Middle East War of 1967). There was no official com- ment from the Syrian Foreign Min- istry on if this was the reason for the postponement. On Monday, Barak was optimistic about the fu- tu:te of the talks, but did believe that there would be delays. Barak said, \We highly re-spect [Syrian] President Assad a11d if he needs some time before tbe negotiation is resumed we will respect it and we willwait. We wiU be there when they are ready.\ Troubles began i11 the negotia- Verdict: by David Gruner Stqff Writer The upcoming Election of2000 isn't solely about taxes, social se- curity, -llealth care, and education, it also about resolving a judicial system that has recently gone astray. Last Thursday, Ja11uary 13, 2000, the youngest murder defendant in U.S. history was sentenced to ju- venile detention by a Michigan judge. It has been over two years, since Nathaniel Abraham, then 4' 9\ weighillg just sisty-five lbs., shot and killed Ronnie Greene outside of a cDnvenienc~ store. Mr. Abraham was 11 years old. What the defense called a \hor~ rible accident\ was actually a pre- determined homicide, as Mr. Abraham bragged to his girlfriend tions on January 6, when U.S. President Bill Clinton held incon- dusive talks with Israeli and Syr- ian leaders on resolving an impasse in their troubled peace negotia- tions. \It's understood he plans to retum.here tomorrow morning,'' a U.S. spokesman said after Clinton met separately with Israeli Prime not underestimate the degree of difficulty of what is involved here. They have been at war three times since the 1940s.\ A Syrianofficial said the negotiations were troubled. However, State Depart- ment spokesman Rubin insisted thattalks were still going in the way as expected, but not on as fast as takes.\ But,. it seems that if Barak does leave, so will al-Sharaa. U.S. officials said it had not determined whether negotiations would con- tinue at Shepherdstown or move to another location after the lead- ers of the dele~ations left. U.S. President Bill Clinton pro- duced results from the talks before ''This is a.11 - :o:n~oJ1;tg,_pro'C~~s.· ·_The· ,zs~utts are diffictilt Q/lld coimplt!ix: ,·a~u·d .the· ·'Pre.si~ .

Israeli and Syrian negotiators held no face-to-face ta;tks that day. Syrian officials accused Israel of stalling on the Golan Heights is- sue. \The Israelis are trying to block the work of the borders com- mittee ... at the expense of the sen- ous and substantive work which should be done here,\ said one Syrian official. The Israelis coun- tered that the Syrians were not will- ing to cover new ground and are simply tried to reiterate their posi- tions taken when talks were last held in 1996. \The Syrians so far have not delivered the goods,\ said a senior source in the Israeli delegation. U.S. National Security Adviser Samuel Berger said, \One should the U.S. officials had wanted. Al- though none of the committees met, Rubin still remained optimis- tic. On January 7, negotiations be- tween Israel and Syria started once again, after U.S. President Bill Clinton presented both sides with a \working .document\ that he hopes wiU accelerate sluggish . . progress on a land-for-peace deal. This-is difficult stuff. This is very hard,\ Clinton said. \They're work- ing hard and they're trying to fmd ways to resolve their differences.\ On January 8, Israeli Prime Min- ister Barak left Qngoing peace talks with Syria to return to Israel. The Israeli delegation left behind would continue talks with the Syrian del- egation. Syrian sources said that they would \stay here as long as it the expected departUre of Barak and al-Sharaa,.and presented aU. S. working paper to both men at a meeting. The document, detailed areas of agreement and disagree- ment in talks held in the past ·and during the current round at Shepherdstown. Its aim was to guide negotiators towards an agreement. The working paper drew initial praise from the Syrian delegation. The Israeli would say only that things were moving along, as they should. OnJanuary 8> despite last-minute mediation from U.S. President Bill Clinton, peace 1alks between Syr- ian F oreig:n Minister al-Sharaa and Israeli Prime Minister Barak seemed · likely. to end without a tentative , ag·reement on a land~for-peace treaty.

The issues are difficult and complex and the president feels it's importaat to bring the leaders together.\ A Syrian offi- cial called the evening talks abo11t the document \crucial.\ Neverthe- less, the two sides appeared to be wrapping u:.p their current negotia- tions withtittle settled. Negotiations had lasted seven days at the West Virginia resmt, however, there was no agreement and little known progress.

For now, it seems the negotiatiotts are indeed over. Juvenile Detention for Another Killer just before his crime that he was planning to shoot someone-and he did, according to the prosecutors. It has been two months since a jury convicted Nathaniel of sec- ond-degree murder in the slaying of Greene, shot in the head two years earlier, on October 29, 1997. Nathaniel called his atrocious act a mishap. \I was only aiming at trees.\ Yet he never apologized for his actions, iU-aclrnow !edging his sins. Suffice to say he has a long record of criminal behavior. By the age of eleven, just befor~ he ran into Greene's innocence, Nathaniel had already been in contact with the police twenty-two times, five of which involved a gun. He took a gun to two different students, pointed a gun to two other students, and chased a bus driver down with a gun. On top of that, he beat a fourteen-year-old over the head with a steel pipe, making him. a danger to society'. Choking back tears in court on Thursday, Greene's sister Nicole said, \My brother did not deserve to be gunned down like a dog in the street .. .it don't matter that Nathaniel was 11 at the time he- gunned down my brother. Age· don't matter. What matters is that he be punished for taking my brother's life for nothing at all.\ After hearing such an emotional statement, though, Nathaniel did not receive an adult sentence .. Even though the jury believed the boy was capable of understanding that someone might be seriously harmed if he frred the .22-caliber . rifle, Nathaniel will be allowed to walk free on his twenty-firstst birthday. The defense clairnedthat is, that Mr. Abraham is not a psychopath. \This young man [is] not any kind of incipient psychopath. \He s a young Il1aJ1 who needs some care and nurture. He has a loving mother ... he's not inherently a violent or hurtful young man. It just isn't there, despite the horren- dous of the offense.\ And therefore, an adult sentence is not warranted. After deliberation on both sides. the prosecution and defense decicledon a blended sen- tence, which will :immediately put him in juvenile custody, where be can get rehabilitation treatment, and defer a decision on adult im- prisonmentuntil he is older. Should that adult sentence be rightly car- rie<! out later in Nathaniel's life, the death inflicted upon Mr. Greene carried a penalty of up to life in prison, alt:'h.ougb that is a scenario that Mr. Abrabam will unlikely ex- perience. The case outlined above pre- sents some interesting points con- cerning America's judicial pres- ence. A small b-oy, see:nringly weak and fragile, willingly killed an older man simply because he wanted to. The courts saw this as horrific, yet were not ready to try him as an adult,and the prosecution corn- plied. Now Nathaniel is off to juvenile detention whereby he will receive ''treatment,'~ ultimately free to leave when he turns twenty-one. America must retlljnk justice in terms of v.rliat is :rigltt and wrong and how punishment should be administered, not in terms of how old the person is and why age pre- determines punishment. Otherwise, Mr. Abraham and those that will follow in his foot- steps will itever understand why it is wrong to kill, creating more ca- tastrophe througb()ut an already burdened c~untry; ·1o Write \or . . ,, fi ' s~ as or cc R: th di pt a~ b€ m m m ra OJ le bl tl: n: p: h b: tt: 0 b c: sc .A g a I f r ' I 1

WorldNews. dtcncormen~i$ • January 20, 2000 ·Page 15 Serbian Militant Raznatovic Assassinated by Charles TutltiU SJqffWriter Zeljko Raznatovic, leader of the Serbian paramilitary gro11p known as the Tigers, was shot and killed on Sunday moming at the Inter- continental H~tel in Belgrade. Raznatovic, who is alsQ known by the name A:rkan, was .secretly in- dicted on wcu:crimes tllat were com- mitted in tlle Serbian wars against Bosnia and Croatia between 1991 and 1995. These charges were not made public until the recent air war against Serbia. R.azantovic has been acc1;1sed of organizjng the murder ·of250 Croats in.a ho_spita:l in the town ofVolruvor as well as many other mass m11rders and rapes. Raznatovic is also wanted on charges 9f ''ethic deansing.\ As well as being a .paramilitary leader, Raznatovic ran several other businesses within Serbia. Al- though many of these were legiti- mate he was also known to take part in illegal activities. Some of his business interests included bakeries and a professional soccer team, as well as oil.smllggling and ownership cf a casino. Many experts on Raznatovic believe that most of his income came from illegal soarces. Profes- sor CherifBassiouni, an expert on Arkan and former chairman of a group investigating the Yugoslav atrocities, says that his commis- sion was ~' ... ableto show how he engaged in c<Jntraband,\ In fact, Bassiouni believes that he \trans- formed his operation to an orga- nized crime O]Jeration ... \ and that this transforrnati<ln is the reason ''why I Arkan] isa multimillionaire today.\ Arkan has ba.ddose ties to crime throughout his lifetime.

Manybelievetbatin the 1980's he was hired by the Yugoslav secret police, and sent to Western Eu- rope. There his responsibilities supposedly included the assassi- nation of Yugoslav political dissi- dents. In 1991 Raznatovic formed the Guards, a paramilitary unit which even [the Serbian GeneraU.NJladic would have found.hard to.storn- ach.\ The newspaper goes on to say that \the barbarity of[Arkan' s] paramilitaries- .. _ achieved a special notoriety,\ and that \the mass rapes, executions and torture that [ Arkan] and his men practiced will be remembered for generations.\ Many experts believe that the ac- tions of Arkan.'s units were allowed to take place because he had the backing of SerlJian leaders. For example, Bassiouni does not be- lieve that Arkan acted completely \• l~ the guards received (which was for the mostpart new} as well as tlleir training and uniforms were pro- vided free of charge by the army, with the support of the president. Milosevic's support of \ethnic cleansing\ and other acts of IJar- barity have led him to be indicted by the war crimes tribunal at The Hague. Many suspect that Milosevic ordered Arkan's assas- sination because be had extensive first hand knowledge of the war crimes committed in. Yugoslavia. The New York Times qu<>ted Slavoljub Kacarevic, who is editor in chief.{)f an independent news- paper called Glas Javnosti, as say- ing, \the main question was not whether Arkan would be killed, but when.\ A London Times editorial took a more direct stance by saying Arkan 's \murder [suggests] that Serbia's rulers are increasingly fear- ful of retribution ... \ and that \one by one, those with whom Mr. Milosevic 's name has been linked have disappeared.\ The Serbian govemmenthas not commented on the p<>ssible motives of Arkan 's assassination. There is much speculation that Raznatovic was planning to testify against Milosevic at The Hague. A spokesman for the tribunal, Paul Risley, said that the group had been in contact with lawyers who sup- posedly represented Raznatovic. They discussed the possibility of Arkan turning himself in and testi- fYing. A rkan had also been in con- tact with Serbian leaders opposed to Milosevic's regime. Two men were believed to have shot and killed Raznatovic using Heckler and Koch machine pistols. One was wounded but both ini- tially escaped. In recent develop- ments, however, the wounded as- sass in was brought into police cus- tody. According to officials he is staying in a hospital somewhere outside ()f Belgrade and will be questioned when he regains con- sciousness. C~inton to Implement National Missile Defense System byStep~en Nemeth StajfWriter Pentag<m watchers.a11d govern- ment contracto:.rs ar-e .once again crossing their fmgers f()r an auspi- cious introduction of a new sys- tem. The su..ccessfullaunching of an experimental missile on Tues- day has .the potential to spur a presidential dedsion Oil whether to field the controversial National Missile Defense System (NMD). This system, a vastly scaled down version ofReagan's , .. Star Wars\ missile defense program,. is ex· pected to provide an \'aerial shield\ against expected ballistic missile attacks while coming at a cost of over $12.7 billion. This systemis.a collection ofra- dar stations, satellit-es, computer- ized comm.andcenters, and missiles that when put at certain points around the country has the capa- bility to prevent JBissile attacks from hostile countries. This sys- tem could be deployed as early as. 2005, butsiill has ma.tJ.y teclmolbgi- cal hurdles to overcome. If, ffi~sd~y 's test is successful. a 121 paund\smartrock\ will steer into the path ofa mock warhead about 140 miles above the Pacific Ocean and completely destroy the target. The complete oblitetation of the target is perhaps one of the most crucial aspects of the pro.- gram. Pla:nners and scientists feel that a successful interceptor, if de- ployed for the entire_nation, must completely. destroy oncmning. war- heads to reduce th.e chance of de- bris or fallout raining down on a populated area .. Pentagon Jllatm.ers ate optimis- tic, but also say that they will not be disappointed if the interceptor misses the target. After all, they stress, the concept of hitting a mis- sile with another missile high above the earth is acomplex task. They been tested in flight and the coun,.. try has agreed to halt missile de- velopment f()rtlle time-being. No other non-NATO country besides Russia and China has ballistic mis- sile capability. The Presidential decision on whether to field such a system weighs heavily on the success of Tuesday's test. If the test sho11ld fail, another ()fie in April co11ld pected to ask for an additional $2.2 Billion to cover 100 additional in- terceptors, more testing, and spare parts. \This is a very high-priority program,\ chiefPentagon spokes- man Kenneth Bacon said Friday. \We are working very hard ... t<T get the president the information he needs from the technical ~ide to make a decision sometime this summer ...

Under the optimism is the seri- ousness the P.entagon is placing on the program. Many feel that this test is crucial m determining d1e country's a:bility to defend it- self from aitacks from countries with missile programs or from those that are developing thelll. North Korea is one such coun- try that insiders say is developing a missile that has the capability to hit the US -although it has never again bring th.e issue to the f()re- front. Secretary ofDefense Will- iam Cohen will issue his recommen- dations to the President in June. If all goes well, a decision to field the system may be in pla.ce by sum- mer. The decision is also influ- enced by cost. which many say is restricting the military's procure- ment of new weapons and the im- pact ofrelatillnS on China and Rus~ sia, which are lJoth opposed to the program. In·· ilie· 2001 Budget, to be dis- closed Febtua.ry 7, Clinton is ex- series of tests that are deemed to be failures we couldn't say that this was ready to deploy,\ Bacon added. The flrstmajortestofthe \smart rock\ kill vehicle occurred on Oc- tober 2. Although the missile ex- perienced some problems to the target, it hit and destroyed the mock warhead. The first test using the fmal version of the combat ready interceptor is not expected until 2003. Critics are less certain of the missile system. They doubt the re- liability ofNMD, the cost, a11d the decision of the Pentagon for plan- ning only three tests before rec- ommending deployment of the system. Opponents also criticize the Clinton a<lministration for blatantly disregarding the ABM Treaty that the US signed with the forme:r So- viet Union in 1972. Currently the treaty restricts any missile defense to one that is less than 100 inter- ceptors, based at a single site in North Dakota, and one that doesn't use satellite sensors. The current administration plan calls for a nwn- ber of satellite sensors, an excess of 1 00 interceptors, and an addi- tional interceptor site in Alaska. What is not apparent, is how the administration intends to convince the Kremlin to modify the treaty. The testing and implementation ofNMD is a dubious achievement by an administration leo king to pla- cate the Republican majority. The scope of this system is too large, too expensive, and costs will most likely overrw1-, as is the case with many military programs. lt is also overkill in a world in which future enemies will engage in regional wars, terrorism, and low intensity conflict. The program is also a bit inconsistent to deal with China, which has approximately a dozen missiles capable of reaching the US. Russia is an ally and China is a tenuous one but the money go- ing to tl1is system would be better spent on counterterrorism and di- plomacy, not against imaginary enemies.

According to Supreme Court organizations must sort through Top Quark Presentation thought to exist, in AncientGreece, they were given the name \atomos ?'-· meaning \indivisible or not able to be broken down fur- ther. These atoms have smaller con- stituents known as electrons, protons and neutrons; these const[tuents turn out to be constructed of even smaller particle&, called quarks. Physicists originally took the name from a line in the book Finnegan's Wake by James Joyce, and it has stuck ever since. Just as pure elemental substances are made up of only one type of element, protons, neutrons and electrons have a certain arrangement of quarks belonging to them. One \up\ quark and two \down\ quarks would construct a neutron and two \up\ quarks and one \down\ quark would construct a proton. It gets much more confus- ing than this, because there are not only '\u.p\ and \down\ quarks, there are also \charmed\ and \strange along with \top\ and \boltom\ quarks as well. There are also anti quarks. Originally six par- ticles existed, now twelve particles are in tbe mix. Concentrating on the top quark and the interactions of the quarks in particular there are over two-hundred other particles which have been discovered in the 1abora1or; thus far. The \up\ and \down\ quarks are paired together as complementary partners, the \charmed\ and \strange\ quarks also are, as the \top\ and \bottom\ quarks are paired to each <Jther. The thing that is special about the \'top\ quark has to do with the fact that is so much more elusive than its \'bottom\ part- ner. The \top\ quark was discov-- ered in a particle accelerator sev- enteen years following the theo- retical postulations predicting its existence. The \bottom\ quark had been discovered just a number of weeks following this same theoreti- cal data in the nrid-1970' s. All of the quarks talked about here, except f()r the \up\ and the \down are f<Jund not to exist in nature by themselves at the present time. The universe as a whole is too cold to separate the quarks from o1her quarks (held to- gether by particles called, believe it or not, gluons). Only in the very early universe did all of these meces exist in abundance. are now duplicated in particle ac- celerators which smack the &toms with electrons moving almostai the speed of light. Physicists smack and destroy an atom with an electron in order to gather the pieces, and put them back together like a giant three- dimensional jigsaw puzzle. Imagine a truck with no screws or doors and with a hood that will not open. This is analogous to our spherical proton or neutron. The only way to fmd out what the car is made of and how it operates is to somehow tear it apart. Shooting it with a cannonball (the electron) destroys the truck, which in turn lets one see how many pieces of the truck came flying out of the explosion. Eventually, one will be able to tell (through reconstruction of the truck body) how the truck is put together, and even how it works.

Currently, the ACLU and other groups are urging congress to look into what exactly ECHELON does. If they discover that this project is focused on violating .individual pri- vacy (if it truly exists), then we should probably dose it d()wn for two reasons: Fir:st, a govemment- fundedperson<:~.l:spying proj,ect has a defmite authoritarian rin.:g to it. Second, if such a well fundled and sophisticated spying preject is unable to keep its existence hid- den, then it is ob-viously not a very effective spying operation. Tills ex:ample illustrates the larger problem of ensu:ring personal pri- vacy on the Internet.

MI UVM Cancels Remainder of Hockey Season Allegations of Hazing Prompts Action, How ~will Union!iockey Be Affected by Brian Terlinsky Sports Editor In an absolutely shocking an- nouncementonFriday, the Univer- sity ofVermontdeclaredan end to the Division I Men'shockeyteam season, with 15 games left in their regular season schedule. The presidentofthe University, Judith Ramaley, appeared at a news con- ference, where she said she was very disappointed with the situa- tion the administration was in, but felt her decision to cancel the re- mainder of the season was in the best interests of the University. This is the flrst time in about twenty years where a collegiate Di- vision I hockey team has seen any- thing like this. In 19 80, Kent State University had also terminated their season, however, in Kent State's situation, the team never played a regular season game, since illegal activity and punishment occurred before the start of the season. What these two cases have in common is the fact that illegal haz- ing caused each team to recognize their faults and face the hars:h con- sequences. In Vermont's case, al- legations of sports hazing caused a total investigation of the men's hockey team, where individual team members were questioned about several different illegal ac- tivities. In her speech to the uni- versity on Friday, Ramaley made her point loud and clear, stating: \We have received credible infor- mation that indicates that a num- ber of players were not completely truthful during our investigation of hazing allegations. As we said durtng our investigation, any indi- cation that players did not provide accurate, truthful, complete infor- mation would result in serious con- sequences.'' From this, Ramaley had gone on to announce that the 1999-2000 season fcr the Univer- sity ofVerm.ontteam was officially cancelled.

As a result of the call, the ECAC made four essential decisions~ First, the games thatt.ea.ms will miss in the next few weeks against Ver- mont will be considered no-con- tests and not even appear on their schedule. Second, the teams who have already played Vermont will remain as counted gnnes, although the system to rank teams for the playoffs will be based on a win- ning percentage, rather then the usual points system. Players' sta- tistics will stay intact, as every player including the Vermont play- ers will be ranked oh a game to game basis, rather then a total amount of various statistics. The league decided to rank Vermont at an obvious twelfth in the league. And finally, the ECAC has decided to rearrange scheduling for the fait- ness towards the Dartmouth team, having games n()W on either Thursdays or Sundays, depending on the individual team schedules.. This will continue tomake cill ECAC games back-to-back, when teams face-off against Dartmouth in the coming weeks. What's Union's position on this whole situation? How will they make out?

For starters, the Hockey team and. athletic department win take a small financial loss from ticket sales, since Vermont was scheduled to play at Achilles in two weeks.

.• ry to in in Sports 0I.tJUtDr.Mm9i15 • January 20, 2000 • Page 19 Skating Dutchmen Split Weekend Matches with RPI byD.J.Book StajJWrit~r The Skating Dutchmen have demonstrated what hockey is all about. In perhaps the greatest finish to a Union game in the schooPs Division One ice hockey history,the Dutclnnen pulled out a 3-2 come~fmm behind overtime victory againsttheir arch-rival, the RPI Engineers, in front of a sold- out crowd of2,504 atAcltilles Rink last Frid1;1y night, January 14. For those fans that left the game early, they found out the hard way why hockey is played for sixty minutes, and not a second less. The Dutchmen made every second count, and just when you thought that the garne was over, lJnion fans found out that the game had really just begun For the flrst 57 minutes of the contest, Union was held scoreless. RPI, on the other hand~ had found the back of the net twice, and led 2-0 with just under three minutes to play in regulation. Things would then get even worse for the Dutch· men. With exactly 2:46to play in the third period, Sophomore For- ward J effHutchins was called for a two-minute minorpenalty for high- sticking. Now Union, already trail- ing 2-0, would be forced tokilloffa five-on-four shorthanded situation. Head Coach KevinSneddon called a time-out with 2:30 remaining in the game to give the team a rest and prepare the game plan for the fmal minutes of action. Sneddon was ash:d to recafl what he said to the team at such a crucial point in the game: \I told the boys to take some short- handed opportunities because we didn't have anything to lose. We needed to get on the h~ard if we were to get back into the game. I told them to stick together and be- lieve in each other. We still wanted to play to win.\ Sure enough,juniorfo:rwardAlex Todd took his advice as he picked up a loose puck at center ice and attackedRPI's defensive zone. He went one-on-one with an RPI de- fender, and instead of :attempting to skate around him, Todd just put his head down and blasted a slap- shot towards senior goaltender Scott Prekaski. Todd's rocket found Prekaski' s five-hole and the back of the net as Union finally got on the board. Officially it was Todd's thirdgoalofthe season, and it was also unassisted and short- handed. Todd's goal rejuvenated the once loud, obnoxious, and boisterous Union crow<l. After the goal, Sneddon gave some more words of a-dvice. He said, \I told the team that killing off the penalty was first and foremost. We nooded to get back to five-on-five hockey so that we co11ld pull the goaltender and have a chance to tie the game.\ uwoq did justtbat as they killed off th~ 1 remaining 1:29 on the penalty, and then Hutchins jumped back· on the ice with only 46 seconds left in the game. Union regained possession (){ the puck at center-ice and charged intQ RPI territory. As the skating Dutchmen crossed the offensive blue line, Sneddon pulled sophomore goaltender Brandon Snee in favor of an extra attacker. t.Jnjoo now held a six-on~five advantage and needed to score ip: less than a minute to tie the game and force overtime. The crowd was on its feet cheer- ing, yelling, and screaming as the Dutchmen attempted the tin think- able feat of tying the score in the minute sudden-deathovertime pe'\ riod with the momentum ·on their side. As theteamgatheredarowd the bench for perhaps the game's fmal stoppage of play, Sneddon re- called, \All I said was '.Boys, we've come this far, don't let up on yourselves or each other. game.-tying goal, was later asked to t::x:plain the play. He said, \I just made a hit, picked up the puck, and. passed it to Wilson. Then I went to the uet for a possible reboWld. It was a. great shot by Campbell. Just when you thought the game was over, we didn't give up and we believed in each other. The E Sophomore Goalie Brandon Snee prepal'es himself/or a possi&le shot on goal closing seconds of the game. Hutchins, who came right out of the penalty box at ce11ter-ice, skated full-speed into Union's of- fensive zone, applied a big hit on an RPI defender in the left corner and knocked the puck loose. Sophomore forward Jeff Wilson pickd:l up the puck and clripped a short pass onto the stick of senior forwardRyan Campbell. Campbell buried the puck between the pads ofPrekaski, and it was all tied up at 2-2 with only 36 seconds to play. from RPl scoring leader Brad Tapper. We've got five more rnin11tes to play tonight, so let's give it your all and play for the win.\' Union's fmal attack hadjust be- gun. The Dutchmen pestered four more shots at Prekaski in the open- ing minutes of overtime, but lle was up .to tb.e challenge in ~~h.~ide each one. Tlien, with just 30' sbc- onds remaining in overtime, Todd forced an RPI turnover and ri·fled Union's fifth shot of the extra ses- sion nigh over Prekaski's right shoulder. The :puck found1he top monientmn really shifted in our fa- vor after Todd's goal, which got us back :into the game.\ To put everything into perspec- tive, Union was held scoreless for the first 57 minutes, and then they rattled off three goals in less than seven minutes. RPI scored two goals in the first 26 minutes of ac- tion, and then was held scoreless for the frnal39 minutes of play. It was a great defensive effort for both teams, as Union and RPI scored both of their goals on the launch orang;es and tangerines at the Engineer\s goaltender after the first Union se.ore of the game. Too bad the first \~oal\ of the game last Friday niglit for Union was disal- lowed because the referee had lost sight of the puck and blew the whistle and: the play dead before the puck fouad its way to the back of the net. The ice was littered with fruit even tlloLLgh Union security patted fans d(Jwn as they entered the building. The referee, however, did not enjoy the tr.aclition as mLLch as Union fans did, as he assessed the Dutchmen a two-minute minor pen- alty for dela:y-of-game because the maintenance staff at Achilles had to run out 011to the ice to clean up the debris w itll brooms and wheel- barrows. Thankfully, l'111on pre- vented RPl frum scoring with tilL· man-advantage. Union had the phantom \sev- enth man\ on their side through· out the entire game. The energy provided by the Union faithful kept the Dutchmen in the driver's seat, and RPI had no choice but to go along for the ride. As a result, the scoreboard flashed the fmal score in overtime: Union 3, RPI 2. The three stars of the game were just as one might expect Junior forwardBradl'apper, who recorded his twenty-second and twenty- third goals of the season for RPI, both coming on the power play, re- ceived the tllird star. Brandon Snee received the second star of the game for his 3 6-save performance, including a number of spectacular acrobatic stops_ And fmally~ Alex Todd received the frrst star of the game for his t<No-goal performance, including the game-winner in over- time. RPI sough.t revenge against Union the fo!Iowing night, Satur- day night, Janaary 15, 2000, as they beattheDutchmen, 5-0. RPididn't score on Snee until the second pe- riod. Union out-shot RPI, 31-27, however, in the loss. Goaltender Joel Laing, who leads the league in goals-against aver- ---- age and save :percentage, was on top ofhis game after sitting the pre- Seni~r Jeff Sproat makes a move on the RPI goalie Friday nigltt. Union scored two goals in only 1:39, and needless to :say, the crowd was sent into a frenzy as Gary Glitter's \Rock 'NitollPart Two\ blared in the background. Union fans chanted, \Hey!'• as the Dutchmen celebmted the @arne-ty- ing goaL Officially, the ~oal was Campbell's fourth tally oitbe sea~ son with assists credited to Wil~ son and. Hutchins. Union was not done ye~ how- ever. The remaining sec:onds of regulation time ticked awa~, and the Dutchmen would enter the five- left comer ofthe net and <hopped behind Prekaski. Achilles.erupted into perhaps. the loudest :it's ever been, and rightly so. Ale:x Todd netted his second unassisted goal of the game, his fourth g()al over~ all, and, most importantly, he gave Union a tremendous come-from- behind 3-2 overtime victcrr against their arch-rival opponents.. It just doesn't get any better tllan that. As Captain Steve Yzerman of the Detroit Red Wings says,. \How , sweet itis!\ Hutchins; who assisted on the :power play with one of the two goals coming on a five-on-three man~advantage. Union was out- shot in the game 38~30, but Snee turned in an extraordinary perfor- mance to keep the Dutchmen in the game. Coach Sneddon agreed and said, \Brandon played a great game. He came up with some big saves to keep the score close. It was an all-around great effort by the team. I was really happy for the boys. They deserved to win.\ As always when RPI makes the 30-minllte trip to Achilles, fans vious one o11t. He stood on his head to make some tremendous saves to preserve the shutout. Union split the home-and·home series with tlte Engineers with each team winnin.g one game apiece. The skati!lg Dutchmen will have this weekendoffbefore heading to Yale and Princeton on January 29 and 30, respec1ively. Union's next home game at Achilles Rink will be played on Thursday night, Febru- ary 3, 2000, against the University of Dartmouth.

Book StczjfWriter The Skating Dutchmen have demonstrated what hockey is aU about. In perhaps the greatest finish to a Union gam.e in the school's Divisi<>n One ice hockey history, the Dutcillnen pulled out a 3-2 come-fmtn behind overtitne victory against their arch-rival, the RPI Engineers, in front of a sold· out crowd o£2,504 at Achilles Rink last Friday night, January 14. For those fans that left the game early, they found <Jut the hard way \Vhy hockey is played for sixty minutes, and not a second less. The Dutchmen made every second count, and just when you thought that the game was over, Union fans found out that the game had really JUSt begun. For the first 57 minutes of the contest, Union was held scoreless. RPI, on the other hand, had found the back of the 11et twice, and led 2-0 with just under three minutes to play in regu.lation. Things would then get even worse for the Dutch- men. With exactly 2:46 to play in the third peri<ld, Sophomore For- ward Jeff Hutchins was called for a two-minute minor penalty for high- sticking. Now Union, already trail- ing 2-0, woaldbe forced to kill offa five-on-four shorthanded situation. Head Coach Kevin Sneddon called a time-out with 2:30 remaining in the game to ,give the team a rest and prepare tile game plan for the final minutes of action. Sneddon was asked to recall what he said to tbe team at such a crucial point in the game: \I told the boys to take some short- handed opportunities because we didn't have anything to lose. We needed to get on the board if we were to get back into the game. [ told them to stick together and be- lieve in each ()ther. We still wanted to play to win.\ Sure enollgb, junior forward AlelC Todd took his ad vice as he picked up a loose puck at center ice and attacked R?I' s defensive zone. He went one-OII-oiie with an RPI de- fender, and illstead of attempting to skate aroundh.im, Todd just put his head down and blasted a sla}l- shot towards senior goaltender Scott Prekaski. Todd's rocket found Prekasld 's five-hole and the back of the net as Union fmally got on the board. Officially it was Todd's third goal ofthe season, and it was also !lllassisted and short- handed. Todd's goal rejuvenated the once loud, obnoxious, and boisterous Uni<>n crowd. After the goal, Sneddon gave some more W()rds of advice. He said, \I told th.e team that killing off the penalty was first and foremost. We needed to get back to five-on-five h.ockey so that we could pull tlte goaltender and have a chance to tie tb.e game.\ Union did just that as they killed off the remaining 1 :2 9 on the penalty, andtnen Hutchins jumped back on the ice with only 46 seconds left in the game. Union regained p<Jssession of the puck at center-ice and charged into RPI territory. As the skating Dutchmen crossed the <>ffensive blue line~ Sneddon .palled sophomore goaltender Biaud()n Snee in favor of an extra attacker. Union now held a six-en-five advantage and needed to score in less than a minute to tie the game and force overtime. The crowd was on its feet cheer- ing, yelling, and screaming as the Dutchmen attempted the unthink- able feat of tying the scme in the minute sudden-death overtime pe- riod witlJ. the momentum on their side_ As the team gathered around the be11ch for perhaps the game's final stoppage of play, Sneddon re- called, \All I said was 'Boys, we've come this far, don't let up on yourselves or each other. game-tying goal, was later asked to explain the play. He said, \I just m.ade a hit, picked up the puck, and passed it to Wilson. Then I went to the net for a possible rebound. It was a great shot by Campbell. Just when you thought the garne was over, we didn't give up and we believed in each other. The • ElizabethDaigle/ CP Sophomore Goalie Bra12do12 Snee prepares himselffora possible shot on goal closing seconds of the game. Hutchins, who came right out of the penalty box at center-ice, skated full-s.peed into Union's of- fensive zone, applied a big hit on an RPI defender in the left corner and knocked the puck loose. Sophomore forward Jeff Wilson picked up tile puck and chipped a short pass onto the stick of senior forward Ryan CampbelL Campbell buried the puck between the pads of Prekaski, and it was all tied up at 2-2 with only 36 seconds to play. from RP 1 scoring leader Brad Tapper. We'-ve got five more minutes to play tonight, so let's give it your all and play for the win.\' Union's final attack had just be- gun. The Dutchmen pestered four more shots at Prekaski in the open- ing minates of overtime, but he was up to the challenge in turning aside each. one. Then, with just 30 sec- onds remaining in overtime, Todd forced an RPI turnover and rifled Union's fifth shot of the extra ses- sion high over Prekaski 's right sho11lder. Th.e puck found the top momentum really shifted in our fa- vor after Todd's goal, which got us back into the game.\ To put everything into perspec- tive, Union was held scoreless for the first 57 minutes, and then they rattled off three goals in less than seven minutes. RPI scored two goals in the frrst 26 minutes of ac- tion, and then was held scoreless for the final 39 minutes of play. It was a great defensive effo1t for both teams, as Union and RPI scored both of their goals on the ElizabethDaigle/ CP Seni~r Jeff Sproat milkes a move on the RPI goalie Friday night. Union scored two goals in only 1:39, and needless to say, the crowd was sent into a frenzy as Gary Glitterr's \Rock 'N Roll Part Two\ blared in the background. Union fans chanted, .. Hey!\ as the Dutclunen celebrated the game-ty- ing goal. Officially, tile goal was Campbell's fourth tally of the sea- son with assists credited to Wil- son and Htttchins. Union was not done yet, how- ever. The remaining seconds of regulation time ticked away, and the Dutchmen would enter the five- left C()mer of the net and dropped be:hindPrekaski. Achilles erupted into .perhaps the loudest it's ever been, and righdy so. Alex Todd netted !:tis second unassisted goal of the game, his fourth goal over- all, an <I, most important! y, he gave Union a tremendous come-from- belrind3-2 overtime victory against their arch-rival opponents. It just doesn't get any better than that. As Captain Steve Yzerman of the Detnit Red Wings says, \How sweet it is!\ Hutchins, who assisted on the power play with one of the two goals coming on a five-on-three man-advantage. Union was out- shot in the game 38-30, but Snee turned in an extraordinary perfor- mance to keep the Dutchmen in the game. Coach Sneddon agreed and said, \Brandon played a great game. He came up with some big saves to keep the score close. It was an all-around great effort by the team. I was really happy for the boys. They deserved to win.\ As always when RPI makes the 30-minute trip to Achilles, fans launch oranges and tangerines at the Engineer's goaltender after the first Union score of the game. Too bad the first \goal\ of the game last Friday night for Union was disal- lowed because the referee had lost sight of the puck and blew the whistle and the play dead before the puck found its way to the back of the net. The ice was livtered with fruit even though Cniort security patted fans down as the:y entered the building. The referee, however, did not enjoy the tradition as much as Union fam did, as he ass-essed the Dutdunen a l\\ o-nunute rninur peu- alty for delay-of-game because tht: maintenance staff at Achilles had to run out onto the icc to clean up the debris \\rth broom~ anJ \\}H.:d- barruws. ll1ankfully. l'mon pre· n:nted RPI from sconn!! '' ith thL· man-ad\antage. l'nion had the phantom \se\- enth man\ on their srde through- out the entire game. Tile energy provided by the Union faithful kept the Dutchmen in the dri\·er's seat, and RPI had no choice but to go along for the ride. As a result, the scoreboard flashed the final score in overtime: Union 3, RPI 2. The threes tars of the game \vere just as one might expect. Junior forward Brad Tapper, wh[) recorded his twenty-second and twenty- third goals of the season for RPI, both coming on the power play, re- ceived the third star. Brandon Snee received the second star of the game for his 36-save perfGrmance, including a number of spectacular acrobatic stops. And finally, Alex Todd received the first star of the game for his two-goal perf()rmance, including the game- winner in over- time. RPI sought revenge against Union the following nigilt, Satur- day night, January 15,2000, as they beat the Dutchmen, 5-0. RPI didn't score on Snee until the second pe- riod. Unien out-shot RPI, 31-27, however, in the loss. Goaltender Joel Laing, who leads the league in goals-against aver- age and save percentage~ was on top ofhis game after sitting the pre- vious one out. He stood on his head to make some tremendous saves to preserve the shutout. Union split the home-and-home series with the Engineers with each team winning one game apiece. The skating Dutchmen will have this weekend offbefore heading to Yale and Princeton on January 29 and30, respectively. Union's next home game at Achilles Rink will be played on Thmsday nigh1, Febru- ary 3, 2000, against the University of Dartmouth. After the Whistle Union is now 2-2 this season in overtime.lhree of the four overtime games were played at Achilles Rink, and Union is 2-1 in those games ... Union is averaging just under three goals per game at home this season. The two goals in l :39 against the RPI Engineers was not tbe fastest two Union scores of the season, it is second only to Union's two goals in 1 :26, which catne against Colgate University way back on November 5, 1999, in the frrst home game of the season.

Previously Undefeated Saints Handed Loss, 67-61 by Meridith Chace Staff Writer The Union Women's Basketball team improved their record this past week to 8-5 with two impor~ tant wins which ultimately over- shadowed a heartbreaking loss. On Tuesday, Union handed Hamilton a 75-55 defeat, giving Union their first UCAA win. The Dutchwomen shot solid from the field at 46%. Union also out-re- bounded their opponents 55-35. The rebounding effort was lead by Heather Bennett, who managed to grab nine boards for herteam. The guards contributed significantly on the boards as Sara D'Arcangelo and Erin McNamara each had eight. Leah Oliveiri and Bennett led Union scoring with 12 points each, and Kathleen Furlong contributed ten to the final score. The Union victory was a special one, not only because,it was played with a vengeance for their unsuc- cessful encounter earlier in the sea- son, but also because Captain Leah Oliveiri scored her I ;OOOth career point late in the first half. Oliveiri has been a key to the strengthen- mg. of the women's basketball pro- gram since the start of her career. Oliveiri certainly deserves being named team MVP for two years, and teammate Furlong could not agree more. Furlorfg stated, \She is the foundation of our team, and if anyone deserves to accomplish [MVP status], it's Leah.\ Union went on to score another huge win on Friday against St. Lawrence, wl1o was previously undefeated in the UCAA. Katie Smith was an offensive spark in the 67-61 triumph with 22 points. Bennett had 17 points and lO boards while Oliveiri had 10 points. Beth Perry als() contributed seven rebounds. to the final effort. On Saturday, the long week of games and practices took its toll on the Dutch women, and Union fell to Clarkson 79-56 in a heartbreak- ing defeat.

Brooks Editor-in-Chief After a devastating loss to Hamilton last Tuesday night in which the Dutchmen shot a mea- sly 36.5%, Union squeaked by St. Lawrence 68-67. Although many Union athletic fans were watching one of the most exciting hockey games in Union College history across the c.reek at Achilles rink, those who watched the Shooting Dutchmen in Memorial Field House, saw an exciting game of their own. Aaron Galletta hit a three pointer with 1 :20 remaining to give Union a 64-63lead. With 12 sec- onds left in the game, the Dutch- men defense came up big and shut down the Saints. Union was led by C J. Rodgers who llad 22 points on the evening. Galletta added 16 of his own. The Dutchmen found themselves down by one at the half, but were able to sneak past the Saints in dramatic fashion. Despite winning the game, the Dutchmen lost sophomore Dave Musella to a knee injury. Musella had a team high eight boards be- fore he went down. Musella, the leading score on the Dutchmen, and second in the UCAA with 20 points a game, missed Saturday's game. He underwent an MRI on Tuesday, however the results were not completed at time of print. Dan Bamford is also on the injured list Sophomore Jason Mmzning gets some nice air during an under the basket attempted shot. after he suffered a severe1y sprained ankle two_weeks ago. He ex.pected to miss two more weel~s. On Saturday. the Dutchmen took em the Golden Knights from C1atkson. Poor shooting and missed opportunities led to a 6 3- 58loss. The team, clearly missimg tlleir top scorer, scored a seascnn Uow 58 poillts, and could mana~e Qnly 26 points in the second half. The team shot a dismal 20% frotm tlte floor in the second half (7-3.4) and hit only eight of 15 free throws. R()dgers, the second leading SC()ter ()n the team with 18 points p!er ~arne, led the J):Qtchmen with J7 JOints and 14 rebounds. Ryan Murray, who started in place ofthe injured Musella, stepped up a11d IJ.ad 13 points and eight boards cnn tlte night. Freshmen Tony Metz ~rabbed eight rebounds in a s<>iid Jlerforman~e in the paint. \We played bard, but struggl~ed shooting,'~ admitted head coach IDob Montana. Montana contill- l!ed by saying, \] am confident in ()tJr team. We have great slloote.-s, and we justhave to remember it is a long season and we have to:riide i()tlt the highs and lows.\ After starting the season 6-0~tllie Dutchmen have since dropped fo-ur ()f their last seven. The usual poo- te-nt ~ffense that Union brings to tile game have struggled in the last :f()Ul' game, averaging only 63 points pet game. In eight of their first nine games, the Dutchmen broke 80 points a game, including three games over ninety and they broke the centuzy mark during the streak Union's defense has continued to play strong, giving up 72 points a game, third best in the UCAA.

Thesy women have been involved in in- tense trainin,g all season, yet their hard work and dedication is sim- ply not reflected in the:lrweak per- formances thus far this season. The Skating Dutch women have posted only one win, an ECAC contest against the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with a score of12-2. Since this early..;sea- son victory, the teamhas failed to fall back intoa competitive groove They have had tremendous diffi- culty fmding the back of the net in addition to generating enough de- fense to keep the puck out of their own net. It was not like1y that Friday and Saturday's. games would present the Dutchwomen with fair con- tests, as both Bowdoin and Colby entered their respective contests with Union posting impressive 6-'1 ECAC records. Bowdoin is cur- rently ranked third in the country for Division three schools, while Colby, formerly a Division One School, is also ranked near the top of the national polls. However, the Union women gave it their best shot, playing hard ev- ery minute and working together as a team to try and hold off their opponents. On Friday, the Skating Dutchwomet;l took on the Polar Bears from Bowdoin up North in game one of their weekend road trip. Bowdoin came out strong right from the start and put one past Goalie Michelle Tardiffless than a minute into the game. They then went on to score four more goals that period and Union went into the locker room trailing by five. The Dutchwomeh skated into the second period with a bit more intensity, as the captains tried to fire up the underclassmen and turn the tides in favor of Union. Their effortswereallinvain though, and the Polar Bears put three more past the Dutch defense, putting them ahead by eight. Union went irito the third period knowing that they needed to main- tain their integrity and prevent the shutout against the tough defen- sive unit from Bowdoin. Kristen Owad did just that, only three minutes into the third period as she managed to put one past Polar Bear Goalie Katie Worthing and make the score 8-1. The team's momentum was put to a halt once again, however, when Bowdoin scored two more times, these goals corning within a minute of eachoth.er. With just a few seconds remain- ing in the game, Freshman Ailsa Cumming stepped up came through for her team. Assisted by Cathie Larsen and Paula Denema, Cunnning neatly placed the puck in the Bowdoin net, making the fi- nal score 8-2, a t()ugh defeat for Union. Tardifffmishedthe gamewith32 saves, and Union was outshot 40- 8, a significant margin. Captain Melissa Johnson w<ts proud of her team's effort in this challenging game. She stated, \We had a tough game, but I am itnpressed with theextraordinary amount of effort that everyone contributed.\ The next night, th.e Dutchwomen had to step up therr :game and re- cuperate from the previous night's loss, as they were matched up against a highly competitive team from Colby College. Less than one minute into the game, it was clear that Colby would ultimately domi- nate the entire game. They put their fist two shots of the game behind Tardiff, psyching out the Dutchwomen befe:re the game could even get started. Head CoachFredQuistgard im- mediately made the decision to pull · the obviously struggling Tardiff, and she was replaced by Junior Goalie Brooke Alkon, who finished the game with 27 saves. However, thesetwo quick goals by Colby took any <>unce of inten- sity the Dutchwomen entered the game with, and they could not seem to fmd a rhythm in their game play. Sloppy passing, letllargic skating and an overall lack of cohesion and effectice communication lead to Union's disappointing 8-0 de- feat. general attitude of the entire team, commenting, \It\s frustrating when we don't see results from the amount ofeffort we put in.

Both teams are corn- ing off remarkable seasons that re- sulted in a Big East championship showdown last March. Both teams saw their stars', Richard Hamilton and Ron Artest of UConn and SL John's, respectively, forgo their eli- gibility and bolt for the NBA. In the teams' frrst game of this sea- son, UConn played lethargically and was beat by a mediocre Iowa team, while St. John's was handed a loss by Samford. Not Stanford, Samford. Since the early wakeup calls, both teams have been led by their charismatic point guards and have regained their winning ways..

After struggling tremendously through the first half of their chal- lenging schedule, the women fi- nally have something to show for all their hard work The teams agreed to use six of the eight lanes at the Hartwick po~>l in order to swim two heats of each event, placing their two faster swim- mers in the second heat to give everyone a fair race. Because o.f this variation from the standard meet and the fact that they swam 200-yard races of all the strokes, the meet ended up being over thre~ hours long. But excitement was present the whole time, as ever:y race mattered in the ultimate out- come. With the 400medley relay team of Junior Sarah Rank.owitz, FreslJ.- man Lissy Grace, Senior Clewis Kinnett, and Sophomore Sara Dietrich kicking off the meet with a first place fmish against Sprin~­ field, the women never looked bac1c against the small Massachusetts team, beating them 151 to 8 7. The Dutchwomeq received nine more wins over Springfield, includ- ing another from Rankowitz in her 200 backstroke and two victories in the sprillt freestyle events by Junior Rachel Miller. Also,. Senior Captain Ke:n-y Librandi and Senim Erin Wittes·were both double win- ners in their Iespective events and members ()f the winning 400 freestyle relay team. That las~ relay team did a lot more than they ha..d thought at the time robbed by Hartwick's double .. win- ner Michelle Slack of a double frrst place in the 50 l:lnd 100 yard freestyles by half a second in each event. Before the 200yard breaststroke, the last individual event of the meet, the girls had a ·quick team meeting.

It was completely up to the 'last relays.

Unfortunately, the relay of Sophomore Courtney Audet, Freshman Anna S1uzar, Junior Jen Hornsby, and Freshman Sara Hamilton finished fourth.

However, dur-ing the routine meetwarmdown,Coach Wolfe in- formed the team that there was a mistake in the scoring~ Union had only needed to get first place in the fmal relay to win the Hartwick meet 122-121! \Everyone who scored even one point won the meet for us,\ praised Miller. \We would riot have won without a to- tal team effort.\ Men's Team Races Tough, But Hartwi-ck Wins by Thatcher Woodley Contributing Writer I would like to start this article with an apology to the male divers of the Union College Swinnnimg and Diving Team, as I neglectedto mention their stellar performances in the five meets the team competed in over break.

Hershman fin- Ished ahead of all of the Hartwick and Spnngfield divers on the hi~h board with an impressive score of 216.30. As Hershman was struggling om the low board, Freshman Aarcm D' Addario was able to fill in by a.t- tammg a first place fimsh for his team with the score of2()5.85. This was a great accomplishment for I)' Addano because it the first C!>l- kglate event he has ever won.

The entire team agrees that Union should have easily won both ofthose meets. Losing to Hartwick especially hurt because they were the team that barely beat the Dutchmen at theN ew Yol'k State Meet last year, causing the men to place third in- stead of second overall. It has become a tradition over that past few years for Union swim- mers to touch out their opponents at the end of a race. However, this tradition did not hold true against Hartwick. It seemed as if a lot of swimmers were not excited for the meet and really did not realize what kind of File photo A Dutchman swimmer competes in the 200 yard freestyle. team Hartwick had until after the meet was over and the fmal scores had already been tabulated. Against Springfield, the biggest problem for Union was winning just one of the swimming events. While Unionisamuchdeeperteam and often swam to second and third place fmishes in their races, that does not in terms of p-oints cancel out a first place finish by Springfield. The only swimming event that Union won against Springfield was the 400 Medley Relay that was swum by Freshman Steve Eberlein, Senior Rob Kirkman, Sophomore Kyle Schack and Freshman Ridgely Harrison. The good news is that the mem- bers of the team have rec::ognized the problem. Monday morning the team held a meeting in order to ad- dress the issue at hand and to try to figure out the best solution. Captain Clark Smyth was especially encouraging, as he has been all year. It was also nice to see some of the quieter members of the team stepping up and letting their voices be heard. The general consensus was that the problem could be fixed but the team had to recommit themselves to the sport, making swimming their number one priority for the next five and a half weeks. Hope- fully, the Union College Swimteam will be able to do that, and they will fmd some of the desire that seems to have gone ~stray over the past few weeks.

Campus News Reducing the Risk Fashion Show by JessiCa Stephens Staff Writer The recent dormitory fire at Se- t()n Hall University (SHU) has brought the issue offire safety back into the forefront of many people's minds. On January 19, a pre-dawn fue broke out in the lounge of a fresh- man. domtitory at Seton Hall, a 143 year-old Catholic University in South Orange, New Jersey. Three students were killed and approxi- mately sixty-two others were in~ jured. According to numerous reports regarding the incident, false alarms at the school were so common that many students assumed it wasjust another hoax. This disbelief for the possibility of a ·~real\ fire is a c; om~ ruon mentality shared among stu- dents across United States college campuses, and Union is no excep- tion. Most people opt to sleep through ahd disregard the infa- mous and annoying frre-alarm, sur- mismg it to be just another false a1arm. However, the incident at SHU is inducing people to think differe:p.tly. AccordingtoUSA Today, frreex- perts view college housing as a \potentially ri~ky arrangement in which young people, living alone for the first time and largely unsu- pervised, face a peril that few con- sider when shopping for a college.\ Indeed, frre safety appears to be a[) often overlooked and unimpor- tant determinant in college choices. This does not rniti- . gate the close attention Union pays to this matter, h:Owever. Bill Sickinger, Di- rector of Campus Safety; and Michael Hilton, Fire S.afety Officer, were both eager to discuss the · of fire safety on campus. They spoke of what the school is doing to prevent incidents like that at SHU from occurring at Union. Investigators disclosed· that the SHU building not have a sprinkler c::v·~TP.·m which would have pre- Y en ted the final outcome from being a tragedy. ~~·\~·· mentioned that solely blam· ing the absence of a sprin- kler system is not entirely . a(cu.rate. While such sys- tems are beneficial, indi vidual responses are just as important Hilton commented that \students at the school did not immediately evacuate the building. In fact, two hours after thealann, two female students were seen leaving the building ... sprin- kler systems would have made .a difference, but theywould and will not· compensate for poor respon- sibility.\ Hilton added that since the epi- s()de occurred, he. ha~ received nu- merous phone calls from con- c~rned pare.nts asking specifically about sprinkler systems at Union. He assures them that the school fqll()WS all codes and even exceeds them at times. Hilton further explains to both. t>atents and the campus comniu- ni!J that Union's policies regard- ing frre safety and prevention were not just implemented or made more comprehen~i:ve because of the re- cent SHU episode; he insists that the school bas been dedicated to the area all along. Sickinger and Hilton both mentioned that the school alwa-ys insists on evacua- tion at the time of a fire alarm. Moreover~ n:o one is allowed tore- enter a building until the dur;;ttion of the alarm. is complete. There- fore, choosing to ignore a fire alann . is not an <>ption. When asked what other mea- sures Union has taken to ensure safety, Hil:ton repl~ed, \All smoke detectors have been replaced, also attributing to the drastic reduction in false ala:rtns. Equipment is con- tinuously checked and maintained and a strong number of resources are utiliz.ed to prevent fues from occurrfug.\ In the fall, a Fire Extinguisher Operation Training Class is of- fered, required of RA 's 1 but also open to students. The class teaches individuals how to dis- charge and use frre extinguishers. Each bedro()m of campus housing has its own extinguisher, not nec- essary acc()rding to codes, but an example of Union going the extra mile in safety. In addition, the College has also incorporated advanced systems that are set up to identify pre-fire (..onditions. These systems are so advanced and sensitive that so much as dust tnaytrigger the alarm. These \intelligent systems\ giv~ Hilton also points out that the Stu- dent Handbook also addresses such issues and students are en- couraged to review this material. Nominations The site also discusses authorized and unauthorized furnishings as well as suggesting personal pre- ventative measures to be taken by the student body. Presently, Campus Safety is in the act ofacquiring videos from the United States Fire Association {USFA) which provide the most advanced and up-to-date informa- tion available. Hilton comments that it is.diffi- . cult to find information on fire safety and training for colleges. Most often such material is geared towards fire safety for households, child-care facilities, hotels and . motels, and offices. However, these new videos willprovidevalu- . able information that can be ap- plied to the campus community. Sickinger was eager to point out that the college works dire<:tly with the N a tiona I Fire Protection Agency (NFPA), a private bureau that sets the Standards for fire pre- vention and flre codes.

·Page 4 • January 27, 2000 • QLm:tenrhle:msis Campus News U2K Committee Nears D.· ecision . . . Web Page by .Jim DeWan Staff Writer The members of the Student Fo- mm and the members of the Steer- ing Committee of the U2K conunit- tee met at the Student Forum meet- ing on Wednesday, January 19. Michael Winn, President of the Forum, invited the members of the Steering Committee \to get every- one together.\ He continued by saying, \I felt that there were a lot of pent-up emotions between the two groups.\ Many members ofthe forum felt that communication between the two groups needed improvement. Senior Trustee Andy Markowski explained, \Certain forum members felt that the forum as a whole shmtld have been 'consulted' with [in the very beginning] more or at least kept up-to-date more on both how the U2K committee was selected and as to their progress and work as well.\ At the meeting, there was a heated dialogue between the mem- bers of the Steering Committee and the forum. Members of the Steer- ing Committee present included Dean of Students Fred Alford, Pro- fessor Alan Taylor, Professor Suzie Benack, Professor Scott Scullion, and students Mat Barry, Kate Stefanik, Ian Eletz and Liz Kaier. A number of issues were ad- dressed including the formati<m of the committee, the progress of the U2K committee, and the course of action after the committee makes its recommendations. Questions were raised concern- ing the timing of the formation of the committee. The members ofthe Steering Conunittee explained the timetable to those present. At the end of the term, anti-Greek sentiment was building amongst the faculty. To express their feel- ings about the Greek system, the faculty voted 119-2 to implement sophomore rush. In the spring term of 1998. a proposal was hrought before the Student Affairs Committee (SAC) for sophomore rush. The SAC' rejected the pro~ posal by the vote of 5-4. The only remaining student from that com- mittee is Student Forum president Michael Winn. Winn voted against the pmposa:l, citing the fact that, \Wre were handed a report about the problems with the Greek sys- tem. To assume sophomore rush woold have been a solution was falsee. We had to explore and look at tbe Gtheravenues for reform.\ A.fter the proposal was rejected byfheSAC, anti-Greek sentiment continued to build. According to Professor Therese McCarty, chair <Jfthe Faculty Executive Commit- tee, \It was likely that a resolution cal!Lng for the abolition of the Greek system would have been iatro- duc~d at the first faculty meeting and passed.\ A ccording to President Roger Hu!U, .. 'Tlle faculty does not have the ll1ight to abolish the Greek sys- tem , but the Board of Trustees does. I can tell you that, had that resCJlution come forward, there WOllld lla ve been a situation on this canlpus that no one on this cam- pus would have wanted.\ He elal)orated, \[A resolution] would have had a lot of weight, but I would not ltave taken the step to abolish the Greek system, but I was not going to let the faculty-student re- lationship be affected by the issue offn-atemities and sororities.\ Tihen, in order to break this im- passe and to preserve the faculty- stuclent relationship, which Hull described as \the most important part ,()f this college,\ Hull created wha:t became to be called the \Com- mittee on Sophomore Rush,\ or mor~ commonly, ''the summer com- mitt.ee.\ \[ was not going to allow this institutioit tg be bifurcated,\ Hull gave as his reasoning for the cre- atioll ofthe committee. The com- mittee included Alford, Benack, pres;.ident of the IFC at that time Jamie Drown, Deborah Leif, presi- denttofthe Panhellenic Council at the iime; Dean Christina Sorum, John Vero '96, Professor Anton Warde '64, and Beth Wierzbieniec, pres.ide11t of the Student Forum at the time. 1111 its report dated, August 27, 1998, the committee concluded the fo Bowing options about the Greek systrem: \l. Continue the Greek systoem without change, despite stromg dissatisfaction of the fac- ulty and some stude11ts with as- pects of that system. 2. Abolish Greek organizations on campus, or progressively weaken them through policy decisions which react to individual problems. 3. Make a contmitment to creating a social life at Union which indudes a reformed Greek system and a strong non~Greek social' life, ad~ dressing the problems identified in the c;:urrent Greek system without abolishing it.\ It then went on to state that ''the committee unanimously endorses the third option. . . to create a 'Greek system for the 21st century.'\ They then made the following recommendations: 1. Beginning with class of 2004, first year stu- dents should not participate in the rush or pledging process. 2. The president should create a conunit- tee to anticipate the effects gf sophomore rush and to reform the Greek system. The third recommen- dation states that \the reform ex- periment should be given four years to demonstrate results. At the end of a five-year period, the College should evaluate the suc- cess of the reform: efforts and de- termine whether it will continue to support the Greek system. Hull then created that cormnit~ tee which first convened in the fall of 1998 to begin this process. This cornmittee became known as the \U2K committee.\ It consisted of five subcommittees: msh, housing, social life, pledging, and faculty- student relationships. The five subcommittees met and made their recomrril:mdations and then re- ported them back to the Steering Committee. A group of students believe that Hull's decision to create the sum- mer committee (which laid the groundwork for the U2K commit- tee) was done without the solicita- tion of the student body. Winn, current president of the Student Forum, criticized Wierzbieniec say- ing, ''They [the forum] had no way ofknowing their feelings, they had only had one informational meet~ ing. She stepped over bound- aries.\ Current Panhel'lenic Council president Megha11 0' Keefe had similar feelings towards Leif's in- volvement in the process, saying, \I don't think she should have made the decision (to endorse sophomore msh in the su.nmlet ••• ctmtinued from page 1 committee] withoutthe support of of the computing resources that the Panhellenic Co11ncil.\ . are really supposed to be allocated Hull defended the timing oft:he · to beneftt all of the .students. situation, sayillg, \It couldn't have OCS~imply isn't given a large beendoneinthefall Ttwouldhave enough buctget to allow aU these been after the fact.

Union Unplugged Yields Poor Turnout by AUyson Kohlmann Staff Writer On Friday night at 8:00PM in Old Chapel, students gathered to be entertained at Union Unplugged. Sponsored by Union's Social Com- mittee and Program Assistants, Union Unplugged is a chance for students to perform or be enter- tained. In the past, anyone who was mterested could sign up for a time slot with the committee. Acts range from comedians and guitar~ ists to singers and bands. This week, however, there was a very small turnout for the event. The popularity of the band play- mg simultaneously at the Nottalso contributed to the lack of students present. Students who were involved said it WillS a very successful and popu- lar program in the past and they ha v~ recently been trying to revive it.

There has been some sentiment on campus that there are not enough non-akoholic events to attend on the weekends. This was another missed opportunity to do something besides drink at Union. In the future, this event and others [ike it could become more populax, well known, and better ().trended if the students would give them a chance. Freshman Rebecca Sallen said, \Students don't realize the poten~ tial they have on this campus.

Women's Rush Revised by Gina C2mpanella Staff Writer This year, Men~s Rush is stay- ing the same. Women's Rush, on the other hand, is undergoing a complete renovati(m, It was decided tha.t s.{)rority rush will undergo two drastic changes. First, tl!e incomin~ cl<J.ss of 2004 would not be permitted to partici- pate in sorority ruslruntil they were in their sophomore ye:ar. In addi~ tion, the first sophomore rush in the fall of 2000 will be a completely informal rush. To try to ease tbe stress of this transition the m-embers of the Panhellenic Council combined a number of formal a11d informal so- rority recruitment eve11ts will be spread over the end of winter term and the beginning ofs.pring term. Molly Shaner, VP of Rush, ex- plained, \When the Fanhellenic Council was infonned that some c:hanges would b.e made for women's rush, we decided it would be better to work 'Witb the system than to fight it.\ Shaner continue<!, \We are mak- ing the transition e~lrly to show the College that we are willing to work with th.ern. With tlie cihanging so- cial policy at the College, we real- ize that it is important to work within the boundaries, while still preserving the streagth and pros- perity of the Greek ()tg,anizations . ., Two informal rush nights will be held during the third week ofFeb- mary and will be open to any inter- ested women. These two events are meaJJ.t to ease the transition into the new style of rush that the so- rorities will he adopting in the fall of20()0. \We care about Greek life so much that we are willing to make the necessary changes to preserve it. 'J Women will be able to register for the last formal sorority rush at U11i<m College between February 2L and February 27. Formal rush will take .place over the ftrst week cfspring term. In an interview with Megh.an 0' Keefe, the President of the Fanhellenic Council, it was em- phasized that the timing of women's fo-rmal rush this year is ideal as compared to the timing in years IJliSt. The women who choose to go lhrougb. rush will just be beginning th.eit spr·ing term classes; therefore inJerference with school work should ttot be significant. Shcmer added, ''The later rush gives freshman women a chance to acclimate to the College and their academic responsibilities. Further- mme, they will be able to make a more informed choice about what is best for them.\ The late scheduling also allows the Panhellenic Council to host open houses and various informal all-Greek women's events before the beginning of rush. These open houses are similar to the events that will compose women's informal sophomore rush in the fall of2000. One concern that has been ex- pressed by the Panhellenic Coun- cil is the issue ()f quotas and num- bers for all of the houses. How- ever, O'Keefe emphasized that this is a minor issue. All of the sorori- ties functioning together as a PanhellenicCouncil should be able to handle this issue. lt is important for interested women to remember that the infor- mal nights are Clpen to all and they are noncommittal. Shaner mentLoned, \The informal nights are a great way for the fresh- men women to meet the upper- class women who belong to the different houses. Reforming rush at this point in time benefits all of thos.e involved. We care about Greek life so much that we are will- . ing to make the necessary changes to preserve it. Because of this, the transition next fall will be that much easier.\ C!Io:ucarm.e:u,is • Janna ?.7~ 2000 • Pa e 5 Middle States Mayhem ... continued from page 1 groups in their formulation of ques- tions for the various surveys. The results for these surveys came out during the Spring term of 1999, yet they were not formally processed and placed into a report wttil the end of the Fall term of 1999 and the beginning of the Winter · term of2000. Some students who completed the survey given last year have expressed some concern in the manner in which it was given and the questions that were asked of them. LaurenTabas '01, was ran- domly selected to complete the survey last year. She felt that the questions were ''set up to provoke a specific answer.\ One ofthe controversial sections was the \Perception and Contri- bution to Intellectual Life made by Club Events, College-wide Events, and Greek Activities.\ The actu.al question asked was, \How much do you feel [student clubs and or- ganizations, campus-sponsm:ed events, fraternities and sororities] detract from or contribute to intel- lectual life on campus?\ With re- spect to the Greek system, twenty- seven percent of the independents and sixty-eightpercentofthe fac- ulty surveyed agreed that its pres- ence strongly detracted from inte] .. lectual life on campus. Although only fourpercentofthe Greek stu- dents surveyed agreed that Greek life strongly detracts from intellec- tual life on campus, twenty-,eight percent of Greeks surveyed re- ported that Greek activities either have no effect or slightly detract from intellectual life on campus. Both Dean Sorum and Professor Taylor commented that the afore- mentioned fmding was significant Erin A loan '01 filled out the sur- vey voluntarily. She commented, \I completed [the survey] because I think it is important that people who are Greek and happy at Union need to express their opinions.\ Independent Sophomore Mike McGuire was one of the people randomly selected to complete the survey. He stated, \I feel that Greek system has a positive influence on campus.\ He also added that he did not complete the survey in its entirety due to its length. Under the direction of Professor Levitt, there are some questions as to how accurate the survey was for students based on the fact that out of 308 students selected, only f()rty-two percent of them re- sponded. That would equal less than 200 hundred students out of a student body of roughly 2,000 students. Before the conclusion of the Middle States Report was revised this past month, there was a state- ment in the report regarding the presence of the Greek system which upset a large percentage of the student body. The statement declared, \IfU2K fails in its efforts to revamp-in a radical way-Greek life and its role in the social and residential scene at Union, the College should seri- ously consider abolishing the Greek system.\ As of a few weeks ago, this statement was revised to: \If the Greek system is to continue to be a viable part of student life at Union, it is imperative that it con- tinue to evl()lve in the positive di- rection established over the past two years.··· Some reparations have been made to the document in order to soften its impact on the commu- nity. Yet there still remaias the com- ment that ·~The dominance of the Greek system hurt both our na- tional reputation and our ability to attract academically talented. di- verse students and faculty ... Dan LL!Ildquist, Vice President of Admissions commented that every year a survey of accepted students takes place where the applicants are able to rate different aspects oHJnion on a plus/minus scale. He stated that the Admis- sions Office has \neither a posi- tive or negative opinion of the Greek system,\ they simply, \present Untort the way it is.\ He mentioned how most stu- dents who enroll in Union are not bothered to ]lave an opinion about the presence of the Greek system either way, yethe commented that \the majmrity of students who don't enrollcite the Greek system as a neg:.t.:ive [aspect about Union].\ Seventy-three percent of female non-matriculates and seventy-one percent of male non-matriculates for the clas:; of 2002 saw the Greek system as a negative aspect of Union. Sixty-five percent of female matriculates .and eighty-one per- cent of male matriculates, of the same class h<Jwever, thought the Greek system was a positive aspect of Union. In respons;e to the comment made in the Middle States Report stating that \the Greek system hurt our national reputation,\ Lundquist simply stated, \The Greek systl:m .is branded nation- ally,\ especially from a Publi~.: Re- lations and marketing standpoint. He also exJ)ressed that perhaps it is the\ Era we are in,\ in regards to downgrading the presence of a Greek system on many college campuses. The Mid&le States Evaluation is not yet comJllete. This upcoming Aprill 0, 11 and 12, a team of eight people williJe coming to Union to complete the Middle States Evalu- ation. The teilm is chaired by Tho- mas Tritton, the p.resident of Haverford C()llege, and is com- posed of others who are employed in academk and administrative fields. They will be looking at buildings a11<l speaking with mem- bers of the administration, the fac- ulty and the student body. Overall, they will be taking a close look at what they perceive to be intellectllallife at Union. Student groups on campus should be made aware and pre- pared for p()s:sible discussions that may take pltce with members of this group. A final report will be put together by the mem])ers of this team after their visit to- the College. Based on that report, Union will potentially be re-accredited.

oillF.fY''· ----------_..........-- .. ·Opinions & 0thiorials NeWs Anaylsis: Iowa Presidential Caucuses by Mi(!hael So McGuire Copy Editor On Monday, January 24, the Iowa presidential caucuses were finally held. The endless polling and press coverage would frna:Uy come to an end in this small farm state whose popalation, which is predominantly white and whose voters consider themselves to he more liberal Qrconservative, is not reflective of the nation as a whole. lt was no surprise that Texas Gov- ernor George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore emerged as vic- tors, howevertb.emargins did stray fro:oa expectations. First, millionaire publisherSteve Forbes finished a ~t:ronger than expected second, with thirty per- cent to Bush's forty-one percent. Though the governor's finish broke a record, it is important to note that the last candidate to win the Iowa caucus and eventually be elected president was Jimmy Carter in 1976. In fact, four years agoBob Dole narrowly defeated Patrick Buchanan, who went 0n to win New Hampshire even though Sena- tor Dole eventu;:~lly won the nomi- nation. And in 19 88, both George Bush (the father o.fthe Texas Gov- emor) and Mkhael Dukakis, who eventually won their parties' nomi- nations, .finished third in Iowa and the candidates who won the state~s caucuses, Richard Gephardt and would seelc to eliminate as presi- dent. Utah Senator Orrin Hatch has dropped omt of the race for the Republical\ nomination after his weak showing in Iowa. He managed McCain. In addition, as the race in · Iowa grew closer to the actual event, candidates Forbes, Keyes and Gary Bauer pushed their firm anti,. abortion stance, attempting to . . . - . ., .. . . . . . . . ~~gr~~ifnjJ!Jctfrom the caucuses . mi,j. bitlt!l!pf!rcei=ved vUlnerability ... , . : ''::\': ~~,'-~:iJ''U$11 campaign. \ Senator Dole, dropped out of t]ie, race by March. The only conclu- sion that may be drawn from this is that the so~called ''Super Tuesday'\ primaries on Tuesday, March 7, which included the highly pOlJ<U- lous state::> of California and New York, in addition to many othe:r states, are far more significant that early, albeit highly publicized, con-- tests in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Michigan. Alan Keyes emerged from the ranks of protest candidates to col~ lect fourteen percent of the vote despite a low-budget campaign and controversial views in are.as such as the income tax, which he only one percent of the vote and ·even fmishedbehind Arizona Sena- tor Jolm McCain, who did not con- test the state due to his views that are unpopular with Iewans, such as his opp0osition to ethanol sub- sidies~' and bis. desire to focus on tne early primary states of New Hampshire and Sotlth Carolina. Senator Katcl1 will ~ow focus on his re-elec1ion bid for the U.S. Sen- ate. The greatest impact from the cau.cuses may· be the perceived vulnerability in the Bush cam- paign. Steve Forbes' suprisingly strong finish may translate il1to a m<Jmentum boost for Forbes and contrast themselves with Bush, who they claimed was weak on the issue. This is a significant issue in Iowa, where twenty-five percent of the state's Republicans consider themselves to be highly conserva- tive and seventy-five percent con• · sider themselves to be politically conservative. ln an attempt to C<lUrt these voters, Governor Bush was forced to take a stronger, and G<ften more specific, stand against abortion than he would have liked. This may not bode well for the less c<lnservative New Hampshire elec- torate, as well as his possible gen- eral election campaign. On the Democratic side, despite the enormous amount of money that he spent i:n the state, former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley lost to the vice president b:y a two to one margin. Bradley :bad been hoping that he would receive votes from many first-time caucus attend- ees, however attendence at t.be by Democrats was low. Despite a last- minute endorsement by a major Iowa newspaper, Bradley failed to receive suppot1 from major state trade unions md party ()fficials. The vice president's view of the state's caucus has greatly ci:Janged since his presidential run in 1988, when then-Senator Gore skipped the state, describing the caucus system as \madness and calling it \the small state oflowa\accord- ing to The New York Times. The front-runners in eacll party have had opposing outcomes in Iowa. The Vice President tlOW has the momentum heading int() a close race in the frrstprimarystate ofNew Hampshire, and Governor :Bush is now faced with a weakened posi- tion, both because of the strong second-place finish of Steve Forbes and hi.s stronger stance agail1st abortion. These eve11ts will make for an interesting primary next Tuesday. Seton Hall Tragedy Raises Important Issues by Gina Campanella Staff Writer ..... ; . ; . . . '. Last week I was having anonnal, friendly conversation with a friend of mille from high school on .instant messenger when he suddenly interjected with' \'Sorry I have to go to a press conference now.\ This friend of.mine is now a sophomore at Seton Hall and the dorm in which the massive fire occurred was the dorm that he lived in just one year ago. I asked him about the conditions there. Apparently, there were two to three fire drills almost every night. My friend admitted that he never left the building and would often hide in the shower, since security would check every room to insure that all the students were outside. The drills would usually take about forty-five minutes because most of the students had to be woken up by security and f<Jrced to go outside. No one knows. how the fi.xe began this past Thursday night at Seton Hall, however, tl,lere was no element of surprise among the student body there that many residents simply rolled over and went back to sleep. The fire began in a third floor: lounge and was contairted witnim it. Two students who were in the lounge and one student who was very near to the lounge in the hallway died in the frre. The building was not equipped with any sprinkler system because it was built before law required sprinkler .systems. One of the Resident Assistants who ~ived in the building braved the smoke and flames four times to help evacuate the students and to help direct the fire fighters. My friend described t1le response of the student body a:s an amazing display of community. At first, b,e said that it ~as strange to, see all uf the fresiuJ.1t:l! .roaming a:roun<!,vvLth.:nowhere tg,go. Many of the ·uppe:rd~ssmen .

On Thtusday afternoon there was a pres~> conference where all of the facts of the case were announce<d:and confirmed. Of the fifty or S() students who were sent to the horqJital that night, thirteen have yet td retum home and fmrr are still in critical condition.

The fire began in a third floor lounge and was contained within it. Two students who were in the lounge and one student who was very near to the lounge in the hallway died in the fire. The building was not equipped with any sprinkler system because it was built bef~re law required sprinkler systems. One of the Resident Assistants who lived in the building braved the smoke and flames four time~ to help evacuate the students and to help direct the fire fighters. My friend described the response of the student body as an amazing display of community. At first, he said that it was strange to see all of the freshmen roaming around with nowhere to go. Many of the upperclassmen were more than willing to open their doors and provide a place for the freshman residents of that dormitory. My friend's fraternity, Pi Kappa Phi, opened their doors to any and all freshman and served them soda and snacks to help them get their minds off what had just happened. On Thursday afternoon there was a _press conference where an of the facts of the case were announced and confirmed. Of the fifty or so students who were sent to the hospital that night, thirteen have yet to return home and four are still in critical condition. I am writing this article just to ask the student body of Union College to just take a moment out of their busy lives and realize what really is and really is not important.

Dorne Staff Writer As a Union College freshman I have discovered in the last couple of weeks what a cold winter in up- state New York isall about. Today was a \warm\ day and itwasaUof twenty degrees outside. It has gotten to the point where· it is al- most painful to be outside. More than one Union student has been heard saying that they expect to catch their death through hypoth- ermia before the winter is over. I have stopped expecting to feel my legs when I am outside for any length of time. Needless to say this weather puts somewhat of a damper on the social lives ofUnion students. The long walk to fraternity parties now seems even longer than usual. People still go out to parties see- mg as they are the only real form of entertainment on the weekends, but their enthusiasm seems to have gone down co.nsiderably. Walking two miles in the freezing at eleven o'clock at night two or three times a week does get to be a bit of a pain. The parties are still fun once you get there but getting there has proved to be more than somewhat of an imposition. I am certainly not planning to give up parties for the winter. I enjoy them too much to do that. But it seems quite likely that there will be some nights when I will not be up to going out. Then the ques- _ tion of what to do when staying in on a Friday or Saturday night anses. To most of us staying in ~eems like an unthinkable idea. What fun could there possibly be in actually camping out in the dorm for the night? The surprising truth is that there are actually many different things to do in the cold weather other than going to parties. Cold weather brings with it certain benefits that may notbe automatical1yapparent. One of the favored activities of Union students is to watch mov- ies. This ·is certainly a very plea- surable way to pass an. afternoo11 or an evening. One of the smartest things to reml!rnber when packing for schoo 1 is to bring lots· of enter- taining movies to watch. Watchi11g movies with the girls or the boys can actually be a great bonding experience. What can be more fun than lying in bed in your pajamas watching a m()vie with your two best friends? Nothlug beats munching on popcorn while watching \Sleepless in Seattle\ for the thirtieth time. Sometimes this can seem like a more appealing option than going out to a party in the freezing cold. A party that will be overcrowded that loses its al- lure after the first half an hour is over. Another option is to have a snowball fight. This can be a lot of fun. Put on your snow clothes and attack each other with snowballs for an hour and you will be ready for and a warm cup of hot choco- late. If getting snowballs thrown at you is not your bag then thereis always the option of making a snowman or snowangels. This too can be great fun and it always sat- isfYing for one to· look at their fin- ished product once it is complete. For all the skibunnies out there taking a day trip to a nearby moun- tain is always an appealing option. Some people enjoy snowboarding and go do that with their friends. on a Saturday afternoon. For all the people who neither ski. nor snowboard there is always ice- skating. That would be the activ- . ity that I would be most likely to choose. What everybody has to do atleast once this winter is to go sledding downoneofthe smallhills . on this beautiful campus. That is an .absolute necessity. However there are certain thin:gs . thet one should not do during a coldupstate New York winter. One is io never venture outside with- out a coat, hat and gloves on. To do so would be absolute insanity. Another is to always wear watm clothing. I actually say some guys wearing t-shhts outside today. P11hleeze, it was only twenty de- grcees out! It was not that warm. L~st but not least; I am begging y0ou,. please, please, please do not dooanaked Nottrunin this weather. I do not care what kind of state you are jn at the time. Anybody who does a naked Nott Run when it is absolutely freezing outside most definitely needs psychiatric help. My purpose in writing this silly . article has been to convince my- se1f and those around me that the coming of winter does not have to mean the end of your social life for th:ree months. It is still fun to go to the parties but is imperative to bundle up when going to them. Watching movies is a great way to bond with your friends on a lazy Saturday_afternoon. Activities in- volving the distribution of snow are also ~ery enjoyable. Ati.yway, cheer up arid realize that the com- ing of winter is not the end of the world. Remember that it is already the end of January and that soon enough spring will be around the corner.

On a Monday night, several weeks ago, I was walking out of South dorm on my way to Fox to visit a -friend. As I was walking across the little paved roadway be- tween the two dorms, I spotted three girls on their way into the building. I yelled to them, \Excuse me, are you going in?\ All three looked at me and said nothing. I called out again this time asking them, \Please hold the door.\ I turned to wave goodbye to an- other associate of mine, who had been walking with me, unfortu- nately for me, by the time I turned back around, I saw the third girl pulling the door closed behind her while turning to follow her two friends who were sprinting up the stairs. I stopped in the middle of the road, a feeling of disbelief qui- etly engulfmg me. I was astounded because this was not one, not two, but three people who had fled from one individual out of fear. How- ever, there was one thing I forgot to mention~ the three girls were white and lam a black male? Now, while I understand the problem of safety associated with iliis action here at Union, anyone who has ever lived in any of Union's dorms knows that it is not only a common practice, but a custom to hold the door open for those who ask. On another occasion, I was in the library studying; when secu- rity came armmd asking students to present their Ids in response to a complaint. When the officer ap- proached me I asked him what the whole sitl!.ation was about. He in- formed me that I need .not worry and to just present my ID. After he was finished writing down my information he move<! en to a white student seated no more than five feet from me. She asked him the same exact question 1 had asked just a few moments before. The difference this time, however was that the officer explained the situa- tion in deta1l to her, after having just refused an explanation to me. These are only two of the many racially motivated encounters I have had in my short time at Union. Throughout my life I have at- tainedmany academic and athletic awards. In my one year at Union I have made Dean's List, sit on the executive board of ALAS, and am the president of one of the most comrnUiiity conscience and philan- thtopic fraternities on campus. Yet no one will hold a dool' for me or answer a question which I pose. Wb.at is it exactly that I have to do to feel apart of Union? Let me re- phrase that: What is it exactly that we, the Blacks and Latinos, have to do to feel a part of Union, be- cause unfortunately are not iso- lated incidents? I am tired. I am tired of the hy- P'Ocrisy at Union. Dllring the day }l'eople smile and say hello. After the sun sets, however, they pass u.:s and look at the ground as their cr0nversations fall silent.

Science & Technology QJ:nncorlrien£~i~ • January 27, 2000 • Page 11 Science & Technology The Future o:fW\ar Technology b,y Steve Ayers Staff Writer One night, while engaging in the aU-American pastime of channel sw:fm:g, I stumbled upon a disturb- ing bit of irony. In.a documentary aboll-t high-tech warfare, thenar~ rator concluded that someday so- phisticated robots could prevent our soldiers fromever setting foot on a battleground. The similarity to a quote from the Simpsons episode \The Secret War of Lisa Simpson,\ in which Lisa and Bart are sent off to military school, was disturbing. Upon gtaduatign, the commandant speaker offers the advice, \The wars gf the future will not be fought on the battlefield or at sea. They will be fought in space, o.r possibly on top of a v.ery tall mountain. In either case, most of the actual fighting will be done by small robots. And a;s you go forth today remember .always your duty is dear: To build and maintain those robots. Thank you.\ One cOlumnist commented that Americans perceived the bom- boardment of Kosovo.as if we were .playing a video game_ This ex- .ample illustrates an interesting ;paradox in the advance of t~chnological warfare. The intent by Alex Militello Staff Writer This past Thursday night, the \)rothers of Phi Gamma Delta fea- tured a presentation on ''The His- tory of the Big Bang,\ a speech 'given by Professor Ralph Alpher. .Professor Alpher of the Physics Department at Union College has a. very unique perspective on this topic. This is in consideration of the fact that doctoral dissertation b.e put together many years ago laid the groundwork for what we commonly know .of today as the popular Big Bang theory. T ryingto sUl11.1ill\tize and explain the theory of the Big Bang is a bit Like trying to put the history of the world into a movie. Whatever could be mentioned within an article, or book for that matter, does rtot do justice to the amount of material which has already been written on the topic. According to a general defmition of the Big Bang, it is \The state of extremely high density and temperature from which the uni- verse began expanding.\ But we just can't assume to start right there and say this is how it happened. Logic demands some so11 of ob- servations to this effect in the universe today, so that we may be able to come to this conclusion.

Perhaps, at one time or another, yuu are at the side ofthe road when for these strategies, it is difficult to see how either of these has more face validity than the Zulu practice of leaving the battle field upon killing one of the enemy and pray- ing for his soul. Frnding a way out of this mers do when they look at stars.

If you keep standin,g at the side of the road as the vehicle speeds by, the observed pitch of the siren will decrease as it is moving away from you. This effect is perfectly analogous to something astrono- be able to see this \decrease in piteh.\ Through different calcula- tions of observable speeds and movements, we also learn that thiags moving away from us, they are also moving away from each other at the same time. PTofessor Alpher's thesis claims visible light is noteven visible light anymore. It has turned into what is called the cosmic background radiation. This light is radiating throughout the universe in the form of exactly the same waves which heat up and rubberize your food in a microwave oven. As precision bombing feplaces carpet bombing, this will allow armies to target military infrastructure more a:n<l avoid civilian casualties. But unlike non-deadly warfare, this solution doesn't allow us to sidestep the moral consequences of our actions. Eventually, we may be left with the disturbing picture of American pilots flying bombing missions from simulated controls, thousands of miles from the battle. There is no easy solution to these dilemmas. It is no wonder that America has gotten a poor reputation in the eyes of much of the world, as our advances in tech- nology make our sacrifice less than that of the enemy. US casualties can generally be fit on the cover of Newsweek, while the foreign dead remain uncounted. There is also the harsh realism that rnost war- fare today is not even conducted in the cockpit of a fighter~bomber, but hand to hand with cheap, US made automatic guns and landmines. The biggest paradox is that in the case ofmodern warfare, technological advance .seems to lead to a moral decline. We have attempted to sidestep the problem through the development of im- pressive technology, but areal so- lution can only come from human- ity itself. These microwaves have been bouncing around the universe for several billion years, giving their energy to dust and other particles, until they had fmally reached a tem- perature of about 2.7K (Kelvin). Alpher' s group had predicted this temperature to be about 5K (or - 268.17 Celsius) at least ten to fif- teen years BEFORE the radiation was observed. The Cosmic Back· ground Explorer (or COBE) was launched in 1989 to observe this microwave radiation, aiJd from these satellite observations were able to nail down the earlier theo- retical findings of Alpher. together with his graduate advisor George Gam ow, and others. As for the very beginning of the universe, the physics that we now know of did not exist, wherem a dichotomy of speculation betv.reen Physics and Theology occurs in their attempts to explain what caused the explosion. The latter of the two, however, modern cos- mologists attempt to kee-p indepen- dent from all of their scientific data. We may never really know the truth. The material gathered for this artie le comes from Pr()fessors Alpher, Marr and also specific ref- erences are taken from the book Foundations of Modem Cosmol- ogy by Hawley and Holcomb.

Let Me Out by Michael:a Cautela Staff Writer I opened up m, mailbox this morning and lo and behold, much to my dismay ( wh..ich is not such an uncommon emotion for me when I open up my mailb~x), there was nothing that eV'en remotely re- sembled a parcel' that had gone through the US Poiital Service. No, there I was, starirug down a long metal shaft that re-ad (in so many words), \YOU ARE A LOSER.\ Except for one th:in.g: Smiling back at me, coaxing me~ begging me to open and read its contents, chal- lenging me to disr.egard it as junk mail and dispose of it in the recep- tacle specifically designed for such, was a bright (verging on flo- rescent) orange slip of paper, neatly folded in tlliirds. Normally, the paper would have long been history, thrown away barely after it touched my fmgers. But today there was no other, bet- ter mail to distract me from this bunion, this barnacle, this super- fluous waste of tree. SO I read. \Dear Union Students ... Blah, blah, blah.,. New Off-Campus/ On-Campus Housing ... Blah, blah, blah ... Rising juniors shouldn't look for off-campus apartments ... Blah, bl~h, blah ... \ What? No off-campus apartments? Does this piss off anyone else? l am offended Lhat I must relin- quish my right to Dive off-campus, because Union bought and reno- vated a whole stre:et ofhouses that they now must fill, or lose money. One of the things l remember be- ing specifically t01ld as a pre-frosh on my tour here at Union was that people generally lived on-campus for their first two years and then moved off-carn;ms. Last year, even, when I w!ls a freshman, I knew of sophomores who were hying in Wade Lupe. I am aware that this was considered \on cam- · pus,\ but it is still extremely hard, . if not impossible, for a sophomore · to get a Sewardapartment. What is going on here? As a ris- · ingjunior, I had full intentions of living off-campus next year, and now these plans have been ruined. A whole group of juniors who came back from terms abroad in the fall to fmd that they had not been \released\ to live off-cam~ pus are now living off-campus and are paying both on-campus room and board as well as rent in their off-campus apartrnents. As far as I am concerned, that is unconscio- nable. The dorms provide a way for students, some of whom have just left home for the first time, to live together in a community with oth- ers who are in the same situation that they are, where making friends is easy, and you always have someone to go to dinner with. For this, I am grateful. I have taken full advantage of the dorm life, and I have even liked it, on most accounts. But I am ready to move on, to be more responsible for my life, to take the next step into adulthood (even if it is just a baby step). Ap- parently, the school doesn't think so. I have not been given there- lease to grow up. Seeing as I am going on a term abroad in the spring (go ahead, wipe your eyes), I will not be able to participate in the lottery which would normally decide my fate for · the fall. Getting an off-campus apartment would have assured that I would be able to live with my friends, in a housing situation that I chose, and thatl wouldn't' have to think about it while I was away (lying onthe beach in Bermuda). Now, I guess I have no choice. I wonder if President Hull has any spare bedrooms ... I am a durnbass. Last week, I forgot to include some other top- ics that havti! been irking me. So I will just continue on the same path as last week. This may be a little choppy, so bear with it. First off, can you morons who pull fire alarms at parties please stop? You are th.e lowest fonn,of hq.rnanlife. Ifyouarehuman. We have enough problems with secu- rity, really fat bouncers, and wait- ing in line for c1appy beer. In the few instances that a decent band comes to this school (Percy Hill at Sig Phi), we have to miss a half hour of music because soinejack- ass wants to play a prank. Wlt&t goes through youx head before you pull a fire alarm? \Uh ... I like sports, I like meat, me get no hook- up at this party, me pull fire alarm. If me Tarzan can.,.f get laid, nobody will.\ (Click) Every house should have some sort of plastic bubble around their alarms with a pad lock, that they bring out whenever there's a big party. The next thing is a \dzy\ sports team. Most Varsity sports teams are not allowed to drink during the season. While this sounds like a good idea on paJ>er,sometimes it's just silly. being dry has helped this team? Imagine what their record would be if they were allowed to drink. Why doesn't the team woeymore about coming up with win.n.ing strategies and better plays? that would probably help theteam ltave a more productive season. Their problem is not alcohol, but they make it look like it is. Unless there's just a bunch of b**ches, who want to get their teammates in trouble for putting that \poison\ into tb.eir bodies. AlJ.d that is what appears to be happening ... oh never nU.nd, 1 ob- viously c~ 't .put this topic on pa- per very well, it sounded a lot bet- ter in my head. Next issue ... why does Union require a ·major? Obviously, for career purposes, most students would want a major. But is ii nec- essary? What about the people that, gasp, actually came here to get an education? This is a school that prides itself on its liberal \rounded out student\ arts pro- gram. (Thank god for GenEd) So why not take it a step further? Let people take the chance of not ma- joring in anything. A lot of stu- dents get disgruntled with anything that they have to study in-depth, and end up despising their major. Why should the school control their path? Even better, GenEd could be a major, and everyt't!-ing else could be a elective. When it comes time for the senior writing project, the GenEd major could do his project on anything that this well-rounded school offers. I'm not saying that! would have chosen this path. Looking back, there is nothing I could have been BUT a Mathematics major_ Just think how many fewer disgruntled students th~re could be. That is my dream ... just an idea. goodness and it might be a sign ()f a comeback. Stilt, noih.ing beats those elder episodes. N(mmm ...• Sweet Mint Julep.

I wished I was then~ w::ith her in j><:tson rather than talk- ing With her C)Ver the phone. But, I guess that's the price we pay for being so far away from each other. Regardlessrmy heart is ca:hner and I feel safer than I did when I was all alone. Jast knowing tbatshe 's ih the same state keeps me feeling happy and s.afe. Safety. The one thing I cheri-sh the most in my life~ I like feelingsafe. Not sobecause it is easy to be safe, but more so because I gd that comfy feeling knowing tltat nothing cau han:n me. Kind of like how Superman may feel. Although, I am refer- ring to em()tional and spiritual safety over physical safety. My heart is uplifted, and I feel like I can do anything (almost anything}. Life always h.as a silver lining, and it is my hope that someday I can live off of that silver lining for days to comoe. I don't need money, and I don't need safety in and of itself to reach that happy lining in the sky. Wllat I need to get there is love andbappiness. Two things that can be achieved only in the heart and the mind. The two things that seem to complete the puzzle that is me. Speaking 1>f completeness, I feel complete when I am with the people I ca:re about. I also feel it when I am in an environment that I am familiar with. Everybody has a right to feel safe and be real at the same time. Most often, soci- ety expects us to act and speak in a certain way. If we move away frem thls, we become the objects of ridicule and shame. I feel the safest whenl am with my Korean Americans~ my family and rela- tives, and with Cornell girl. I can be real, an(j they accept all of it for what it is. Even if they don't agree with it. For me, acceptance is very impl)rtant to me. When I am with people I am not familiar with, or man enviro:tunentl don't particularly like, I withdraw and shut down. This is how I work. I don't like being interrogated over why I writewhatl write in my sec- tion of th~ paper. I don't like be- ing pushed around. I naturally withdraw, and avoid the place from which the transgression came from. If I'm quiet and withdrawn, and don't seem interested, it is most likely that l) I don't like you. 2) I don't care for the place, and wish to leave. I fmd that gener- ally I am a .quiet person. However, that seems. to change when I am with people I am close with and with people I am comfortable with. ·Marbe it's aKoreanAmeri- can thing. I do not know for sure. But either way, I pay two prices for acting my two different selves. By actifi.g quiet, and withdrawtl, people tend to believe that they can walk all o.ver me.

There next week. wasn't any1lling that I could do about it; no matter what, I found myself unable to move fl'()m the couch. I realized that this must be what happens to my friends who insist upon watching the same ex- act movies on a weekly basis. They continue to laugh hysteri- cally at the same scenes every time, like their memories stop functioning and they can't do any- thing about it. I'm not saying that being a Couch Potato is a bad thing, nor is the desire to watch the same movie over and over. Allowing yourself a little sloth time can be beiteficial to your mental well being. There is no need to be worried about what needs to be done, and how you shouldn't be watching TV because you have too mucb home- work; every now and then any normal college student should spend some time \doing nothing.,, This is what keeps a person young. Spending the weekend watching movies was a good way to relax. It's not like I'm doomed because I didn't run those errands or review some assignments. The world has and will not come to an end. I'm n()t ashamed that I sat around all weekend, and I;m sure that my friends aren't a:shamed ofhow they C()ntinually enjoy the same mov- ies week after week. If this is wllat allows us to relax and have fun because it is entirely too cold out to do anything, than this is wllat we should be doing. For those people who complain that there is so much they need to do, they should either do it and stop whining or let it go for the time being and worry about it later. What's the point in doing some- thing if you are worried about what you should be doing instead~ I don •t think there is any real way to enjoy yourself if you think like this. So, anyway, I didn't get ally- thing accomplished this weekend and now I have plenty to catch up on, but I'm glad I spent my time tb.e way I did.

It's fuilll.y when you. think about it, tbou.gh- only recently has this network gotten so much, if any, media coverage. Ten years ago the WB didn't eJtist. Five years ag(), two upstart networks :pre- rniered- the WB and UPN, with the latter having the edge of a well known television franchise (Star Trek's latest,incamation, Star Trek: Voyager was a guaranteed hit). Why is it, then, that five years later it is the former's programming that people write about in magazines? In January of 1997, the WB pre- miered BufJY the Vampire Slayer, and followed up with Dawson's Creek a year later, and though nei- ther of the shows ever came close to the Top 20, or the Top 50 for that matter, th.ey were both heralded as successes. Why? Demographics, the driv- ing force ofprogramming today. It doesn't matter how many people are watching to advertisers nowa- days, but rather who they are. WB shows outperform most others in one of the most coveted demo- graphics: young teenage girls. Teenage girls appeal to advertis- ers for several reasons, not the least of which is their ample amounts of disposable income in the form of allowance or part-time jobs likely to be spent on things like CDs, movies, and clothes. An advertiser's dream. TheWBhithardandfast. Buffy in 1997, Dawson's Creek the fol- lowing January,. Charmed and Fe- licity that fall, and Angel, Roswell, Jack & Jill, and Popular in 1999, all geared towards this market and no other. And, for the most part, they have been successfuL I say \for the most part\ because this kind of narro·wcasting can be deadly. What happens when teen- agers stop being the target alldi- ence for advertisers? The WB has quite .possibly painted itself into a comer~ inac- cessible to the bulk ofthe viewing aq.dience by its teen-friendly im- age. Hence the awkward position of myself, or any other current or po- tential WB viewer my age or older. The association of the network With screaming Britney Spea.rs fans certainly limits its growth poten- tial. Which is a shame, because in all honesty, a lot ofthe programs on this network are good.

The con- cert was not all that long. and the audience stayed both amused and attentive the entir~ time. The Minstrelles perfarmed before the Pipers and their music jazzed the au- dience so that they were already in a jubilant frame of mind by the time the Pipers came on. Although the MinstreUes only performed two songs they did a masterful job at the songs that they did perform. They sang, \Can't Hurry Lon:\ and \Taling Me I ligher.\ Both songs are well known with the audience so that made the concert that much more entertain- mg. TI1e small size of the choirs works to their advantage. It mal\es it that much easier for the audience to notice all the members of the group and see how they all interact to- gether. It makes it easier for the sing- ers to grow accustomed to one another's musical styles. The one person who docs stand out from the group would obvi- ously be the soloist. The female solo1st in the ~instrellcs was :\Iegan O'DonnelL She sang the ~ulo for \Taking Me Higher,\ which and wowed the audience who was even more impressed wllen they found out that she was only a fresh- man. o· D(mncll's beautiful Voice projected throughout Dutch Hol- lo\\ ,mJJJJ nut fail to ..:aptivate ,my member of the audience. Next came the Dutch Pipers who were introduced as the \sexiest and most intelligent boys on campus.\ That was quite an introduction to live up to but they seemed to man- age quite nicely. They sang sev- eral more songs than the Minstrelles and were just as irre- sistible to the audience as their fe- male cOUiiterparts were. All of the songs that the Pipers sang were very well done but the ones that really stuck out were \In the Still of the Night\ and ~'Since You Came Along.\ My favorite would have to be \Since Y ouCame Along.\ I had never heard the sang be- fore and was taken in by the beau- tiful lyrics and the flawless deliv- ery of the song. It is a beautiful song no matter what but the Pip- ers did such a good job that it will remain in everyone· s head for a few more days. The soloist for the Pipers was the talented Robbie Olazagasti. It is unlikely that there was not a fe- male in the audience who did not wish that he was singing that song to her. His delivery was both sweet and soulful. The song was that much better because of his wonderful petformance. The audience consisted prima- rily of students who had braved the cold to come listen to Union College's only male and fernale a- cappella grm1ps. I heard more than my share of moaning and groaning from my friends about bow cold it was out- ~iJ~..:. 13ut the trek ami the freezing that enduring that we endured was well worth it. People put up with the cold weather because they were expect- ing stellar performances by both the Pipers and the Minstrels and that is what they received. Both groups lived up to their reputations a~ being extremely talented groups that never fail to .please their audi- ence. .in fact. Bu.f/Y the VampiFe Slayer is. <>ne of the most 01iginal and in- telligen.t programs on the air today. Once a reasonably mature viewer mal<es it past the double hurdles of its ti1le (the term \Vampire Slayer\ reeks of the bad horror film the s-how was adapted from) and its, !letwm:k' s image, they ate bou11d to discover a remarkably fulllly, touching, and sharp pro- gram, une which is regularly re- :garded by critic.;s as the best show o~ television. Tllough Dawson's Creek may have a ways to go before it is her- a14ed as the best show on televi- sioll; it is by no means a bad show. Sure, the characters are supposed tobe fifteen, look twenty, and talk lil{ethey're in graduate school, but the eJh()tions and friendships at the core of the shew are easily ac- cessible to anyone who's ever been. a teenager. And two ofthe network's latest additions, Angel (a spin-off of Buffo the Vampire Slayer) and Roswell are l>oth well-done. Angel has the lo()k and feel of a traditional detec- tive show while still retaining the sharp writing, dialogue, and otherworldliness Buffy the- Vam- pire Slayer is famous for. Roswell plays like a strange cross between Dawson's Cre~k and TheX-Files; government conspiracies existing alongside school projects for six tl!:enagers, three of whom happen t()he aliens. Farfetched, definitely, but also surprisingly emotionally affecting. The feelings ofbeihg differeut, of not fitting in, and the profound fear ()f being rejected after revealing your t.rue self are all personified .in tll.e young aliens' plight, and are allfamiliarto every one ofus. Hapefully, the WB will eventu- . ally be able t() move beyond its teen-drama fixation, and be able to branch out into progratn.rning that embraces :more age. groups: and cultures. Until then, you can be sure I'll stay ttmed. Buffy airs at 8:00 PM Tuesday, WB45, Angel at 9:00PM Tuesday WB45, Dawson's Creek Wednes- day at 8:00PM WB45, and Roswell Wednesday at 9:00PM WB45. , lu If tb F1 lc hl gJ cc s~ 61 s 8( fl Sl ti a v p e lt q tl il n p f

Why is it, then, that five years later it is the former's programming that people wri:te about in magazines? In January of 1997, the WB pre- miered Bujjj' the Vampire Slayer, and followed up with Da>vson 's Creek a year later, and though nei- ther of the shows ever came close to the Top 20, or the Top 50 for that matter, they were both heralded as successes. Why'? Demographics, the driv- ing force of programming today. It doesn't matter how many people are watching to advertisers nowa- days, but rather who they are. WB shows outperform most others in one of the most coveted demo- graphics: young teenage girls. Teenage girls appeal to advertis- ers for several reasons, not the least of which is their ample amounts of disposable income in the form of allowance or part-time _jobs likely to be spent on things like CDs, movies, and clothes. An advertiser's dream. The WB hit hard and fast. Buffy in 1 997, Dawson 's Creek the fol- lowing January, Charmed and Fe- licit;· that fall, and Angel, Roswell, Jack & Jill, and Popular in 1999, ail geared towards this market and no other. And, for the most part, they have been successful. I say \'for the most part\ because this kind of narrowcasting can be deadly. What happens when teen- agers stop being the target audi- ence for advertisers? The WB has quite possibly painted itself into a comer, inac- cessible to the bulk of the viewing audience by its teen-friendly im- age. Hence the awkward position of myse If, or any other current or po- tential WB viewer my age or older. The association of the network with screaming Britney Spears fans certainly limits its growth poten- tial. Which is a shame, because in all honesty, a lot of the programs on this network are good.

The M instielles performed before the Pipers and their music jazzed the au- dience so that they were already in a jubilant frame of mind by the time the Pipers came on. Although the Minstrelles only performed two songs they did a masterful job at the songs that they did perform. They sang \Can't Hurry Love\ and \Taking \k I Iigher. .. Both songs are well known with the audi~nce so that made the concert that much more ~ntertain­ mg. ·n1c small siz~ ofthe choirs works tu their aJ.vantage.

All of the songs that the Pipers sang were very well done but the ones that really stuck out were \In the Still of the Night\ and \Since You Came Along.\ My favorite would have to be \Since You Came Along.\ I had never heard the song be- fore and was taken in by the beau- tiful lyrics and the flawless deliv- ery of the song.

It is unlikely that there was not a fe- male in the audience who did not v. ish that he was singing that song to her. H1s ddivery was both sweet and soulful.

Both groups lived up to their reputations as being extremely talented groups that never fail to please their audi- ence. in fact. Buf!Y the Vampire Slayer is one of the most original and in- telligent programs on the air today. Once a reasonably mature viewer makes it past the double hurdles of its title (the term \Vampire Slayer\ reeks ofthe bad horror film the show was adapted from) and its network's image, they are bmmd to discover a remarkably funny, touching, and sharp pro- gram, one which is regularly re- garded by critics as the best show on television. Though Dawson 's Creek may have a ways to go before it is her- alded as the best show on televi- sion, it is by no means a bad show. Sure, the characters are supposed to be fifteen, look twen:ty, and talk like they're in graduate school, but the emotions and friendships at the core of the show are easily ac- cessible to anyone who's ever been a teenager. And two of the network's latest additions, Angel (a spin-off of BuifY the Vampire Slayer) and Roswell are both well-done. Angel has the look and feel of a traditional detec- tive show while still retaining the sharp writing, dialogue, and otherworldliness Buffy the Vam- pite Slayer is famous for. Roswell plays like a strange cross between D(J'VVSOfl 's Creek and The X-Files; govenunent conspiracies existing ahmgside school projects for six teenagers, 1hree of whom happen to l>e aliens. Farfetched, definitely, but also surprisingly emotionally affecting. The feelings of being different, of not fitting in, and the profound fear of being rejected after revealing yotutrue self are all personified in the young aliens' plight, and are all famiLiar to every one ofus. liopefully, the WB will eventu- ally be able to move beyond its teen-drama fixation, and be able to branch out into programming that embraces more age groups and cultures. Until then, you can be sure I'll stay tuned.

Israeli President W eizman called to Resign by Philip Cho Stqf!Writer Despite growing calls for his res- ignation, Israeli President Ez:e r Weizman said he has no plans to step dovvn. Currently, Arbel is·in- vestigating allegations tika t Weizman accepted more tha11 $450,000 from French businessman Saroussi from 1988, while he W<J;S a lawmaker and Cabinet minister, llll.- til he became president in 199:>. Weizman claims that there is 11c corruption, and that he committed no offense by receiving a gi.ft from a friend, which has no bearing 'on his public position. However, despite this claim, newspapers call for resignatioll. Public opinion polls show a gro•w- ing number oflsraelis want him t() resign. Housing Minister Yitzh.ak Levy, head oflsrael's rightist Na- tional Religious Party, told Israel Radio that the president should quit to preserve the dignity -of the office. Several newspapers have urged Weizman to quit. Even The Jerusalem Post got into the act. ShlomoBen-Ami, Israeli minister of public security, said Weizman's behavior \brings many people to mistrust of the elites, of politics as a whole. And this is very danger- ous.\ Weizman, a war hero who wants peace, was already under fire for lobbying passionately for peace, and ignoring the constraints of his ceremonial office. He went as far as to warn that if Israel rejects a peace deal with Syria, he would resign. A war hero who's at the forefront of Middle East peace movements, W eizman' s popularity with the Israeli public is being sorely tested. Ben-Ami suggested W eizman should have come forward to the public and confessed as President Clinton did when he b.id his rela- tionship with Monica Lewinsky. Many observers feel that it is rto longer a question ()[ wltether Weizman will leave office, but when. On January 20, Israel's attorney general ordered a criminaltnvesti- gatioo of President Weizman over allegations the president illegally accepted large amoUilts ofmoney from a French textile magnate. The Justice Ministry said the attorney general has ordered a formal crimi- nal inquiry of the president, in co~ operat,ion with police and tax au- thorities. Weizman has admitted receiving at least $200;000 from multi -million- aire Sarousi. However, he also said that the money was a gift from a friend, with :1;10 strings attached, apd that he was not legally obli- gated to report it. Weizman's at- torneys turned over files of the president's fmandal records to in- vestigators at the start of .the in- quiry. The President's lawyers asked to be investigated in the same way as any other citizen, with- out privileges, and for the investi- gation to be completed with great speed. On January21,police said they expected Israeli President Weizman would testify as patt of a crirp.inal inquiry into whether he acted ille- gally by accepting money from a friend. The police will conduct an investigation and the polic.e chief promised it would be done as q:uiddy as possible. Sawussi's at- to~ney Pirihas Rubin said his eli- eat would aaswer investigators' questions and would prove that no ill~gal activities took place. On January 23, Israeli President Ezer W eizman said.iq..a nationwide address, \I have tvvo ways to go and in my opinion there is na middle ground. One way is to fight for the truth to tll.e end and the other is to resign. I llave no inten- tion of resigning. r repeat: I have no intention of resigning .... A leave of absence is not a solution.'' For the first ti..nle in Israel's his- tory, police launched a criminal in- vestigation of the president, on suspicion that he di<l not properly report cash gifts from a former busi- ness associate. It is against the law to try a sit- ting president. A removal of the president from offi<;e would require the support of ninety out of 120 members ofparliarnent. Less than fifty legislators have said they would support his re- moval, but politicialls across the politician spectrum and commen- tators have urged vr eizman to step down .. \God's Army\ Takes Hostages in Hospital by StephenNemeth Stqff Writer A tense twenty-two hour stallcic off was ended Tuesday as Th<ti Commandos raided a hospital, kill- ing all of the ten hostage takers a..nd freeing the hundreds t:rap)fes:l within the building.

Republican Candidates Focus on Taxes by David Gruner StqffWriter Taxes are one the major issues surrounding the upcoming 2(}10~ Election, and will likely be one of- if not the-deciding factors as t,Q which candidates will survive ilie primaries. Yet both Vice Ptesideent Gore and former Senator Bradleey, each vying for the Democratic n-orm- nation, have ignored the tax ils:;u.e for the time being, turning towal'<ls social security and health care u a means of promoting candidacy. While they each know that ta)'{es will be a subject for debate as l~e election progresses, they are not disclosing any sort of in depth <lis- cussion related to taxes and ta.x. cuts. Republican nominees Gov.er• nor Bush and Senator McCain, 011 the other hand, have recently Ull- veiled their stance on taxes, en- couraging tax cuts as a way to re- store American wealth, while keep- ing m()ney away from Washington bureaucrats. Yet, each candidate has endorsed significantly differ- ent pmposals, proposing different ways to use the surplus the gov- ernment recently announced. Governor Bush revealed his tax cut proposal during the '99 holi- day season, weeks before Senator McCain was ready to commit to a similar proposal. Bush's tax cuts calls f()r a $486 billion tax relief over five years, concentrating on low- ering the tax burden for all Ameri- cans. It is very much the same as Congressional Republicans pro- posed,in the summer of1999, which was later vetoed by President Clinton. There are three main points to consider when analyzing Bush's tax proposal. It abolislles the death tax: over five years which has dam- aged numerous family businesses because of a death in the family. Second, Bush lowers the marginal income tax rates, replacing the old tax tate structure of 15, 28, 31, 36, 39.6 percent with four lower rates: 10, 15, 25, and 33percent. Lastly, as a sort of swnmation to Bush's proposal, he begins to move to a tax code that is a flatter and fairer system overall. On the other side ofthe Republican spec~ trum, Senator McCain only takes $237 billion( over five years }of the surplus specifically allocated for tax cuts. Assuming that the country will not eu.joy budget surpluses for years to come, McCain • s plan pri- marily deals with decreasing low- and middle-income tax rates for those Americans whose taxes are most burdensome. McCain, though, has not re- ceived much support from theRe- publican Party, claiming the Senator's proposal not to be very \conservative.\ An influential Republican, Grover Norquist 1 President of Americans for Tax Reform, the country's largest tax group, responded to McCain's proposal: \When talldng about tax cuts; size does matter, and unfor- tunately, Senator McCain's pro- posal, when compared with Forbes, Bush, and Congressional Republi- cans tax cut proposals, is tiny.\ McCain, in retaliation to Mr. Norquist and the rest of his Repub- lican adversaries, believes that there is a growing gap between the rich and the poor and the only way to narrow that gap is to offera small yet prudent tax cut package to help those people that are not benefit .. ing from the aweso:me American economy. Bush and McCain have been the targets ofsomeheateddebate, ini- tiated by the me<lia. and placed negatively against one another. Bo1h candidates nave disregarded such allegations, an <I Iemain to re- spect and accept each other as credible and courageous politi- cians. they are solely f()cusing on the campaign the upcoming Iowa cau- cus and New Hampshire primary, where both Bush an<l McCain are viable contenders to take the spot- light. During the cwnpaign they will continue to proni()te their respec- tive plan, calling fi>-rtax cuts, giv- ing money back to the people, which they believe is preferable to the proposed Detn()cratic spend- ing plans of Vice-President Gore and Senator Bradley..

The de- cision also upheld Missouri's de~ cision to impose tighter restrictions on state campa-igns. Advocates of the decision believe that uphold- ing the Federal Election Commission's $1,000Hmit is a vital frrst step in campaign finance re'- fonn. Opponents o.f the decision believe that the $1,000 limit re- stricts a candidate. from being able to effectively reach voters. they believe that the decisic:m is a viola- tion Qf a candidate's freedom of speech. Other .epponents also stress the fact that the current laws mayencourage other foJ;lllS of con- tributions such as \soft money.'; The debate over campaign con- tribution limits goes back to the . Federal Election Campaign Act of 197 4. In. an effort to keep track of contribution sources and to avoid corruption, the Supreme Court up- held limits on whatpeople and on Political Action Committees (the fi:,. nancia1 branches pf interest g:roups) can donate tc campaigns. The FEC regulations~ however, do not control what is often referred to as soft money, funds which are. given to state political parties. The regulations also do not cover in- dependent sp.ending on cam- paigns by political action commit- tees. Soft money is often an extra source of money for candidates, w~ile independent spending can oftenhave drastic effects.on a cam- paigiJ,. A classic example ofthe effects of independent spending is the 1988 Willie Horton ad. The sub- Jectofthe advertisement was Willie Horton, a convicted murderer who was given <\ weekend furlough during the time that Michael Dukakis was governor of Massa- chu!;etts. Alt11ough this practice was<;oli1mon at the time, ·the events ofHortori's furlough proved to be extraordinary. During the time of his weekend parole, Horton kid- _ napped a couple, raped the women and assaulted the man. By men- tioning Dukakis during the adver- tisement, political scientist Kathleen Hall Jamieson, author of Dirty Politics, believe that voters formed negative opini.ons of Duk.akis. These opinions, she be- lieve, hurt him at the polls. b;J her book she says that the ad \magnifi[ed] fear of crime, identifi[ed] that fear with Dukakis, and offer[ed] a surefire way of alle- viating the anxiety - vote for Bush ... \ She believes that this in- dependent advertisin.g campaign contributed to :Bush's landslide victory in 1988. Although the recent Supreme Court cttcision .does not cover in- dependent spending and \soft- money\ many see this decision in a positive light. Senator John McCain, who has been very vocal about campaign f:mance,. has said that the decision is \marvelous and it will help .... in efforts to enact meaningful campaign finance re- form.\ Many believe that a reveF- sal of the contribution limits would have set back progress. in reform- ing campaign finance. Thomas Mann, who is a Brookings Lnstitu.- tion expert on Congress, believes that had spending limits been lifted, \the entire remaining edifice of campaign fmance regulation would have crashed to the gr()und.\ The decision has also offered hope to many who want to further reforrncampaign finance laws. Jus- tice Souter believes thatMissouri 's alteration of the existing laws was in no way unconstitutional. He be- lieve$ that in the origjnal Buckley decision, the Supreme Court \rec- ognized a concern not confmed to bribery of public officials, but ex- tended to the broader threat from politicians too compliant with the wishes oflarge contributors.'' He also said that\in defending its own statute, Missouri espouses those same interests of preventing cor- ruption and the appearance of it that flow$ from munificent cam- paign contributions.\ The recent decision in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri GovemrnentPAC was not unanimous, wi:tlt three out of the nine judges choosing to dis- sent. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote one of the dissenting opin- i()ns. He believes that the current FEC regulatiol1S,as well as the laws enacted in Missouri, are unconsti- tational. Limiting campaign contributions, according to Thomas, limits a candidate's right to free speech, which often .requires using meth- ods such as TV to reach large au- diences. In his dissent, he writes, \Political speech is the primary object ofFirst Amendm.entproteG- tion.'' He believes. that political speech leads t() a \free exchange ofpoliticalinfonnation ... \ and this e~change \should receive the most protection when it matters the most during campaigns for elective of- fice.\ He also makes the point that \tbeConstitution leaves it entirely -qpto citizens an.d' candidates to de- tennille who shall speak, the means tltey will use and the amount of speech sufficient to infonn and persuade.\ Justice Thomas be- lieves that laws that interfere with th.ese factors, such as laws on cam- paign contributions, are unconsti- trutional. Jl.lStices Thomas's dissenting ()pinion has the .support of many :POliticians wl1o agree that the spending limits inter-fere with free speech. Bill McCarthy, who is deputy direct()rof communications f()r the Republican National Com- mittee, spoke for his group by say- iiEg that they \'are disappointed by [tile] decisicn.\ The committee believes that \strict contribution limits impinge on free speech, \ and that \the issue deserve[ s] further considerati()n by the courts.\ Ironically, another dissenting opinion, written Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, has much in common with those who supported the de- cision. Justice Kennedy, like Tho- mas, does not believe that the cur- rent limits on campaign contribu- tions should exist. Similarly to McCain however, Kennedy stresses the fact that the current limits do not address other sources of political income such as \soft money.\ He believes that the cur- rent system encourages \contribu- tors and candidates [to] devise ever more el(lborate methods of avmd- ing contribution limits.\ He also believes that these limits \ ... take no account of rising campaign costs.\ Justice Kennedy believes that campaign contribution limits are not necessarily unconstitutional. In fact he believes that state legis- latures should be free \to attempt some new reform, if, based upon their own considered views .of the First Amendment, it is possible to do so.\ Kennedy differs from re- formers such as McCain in that he \would frrstoverrule Buckley, [the decision that lead to the establish- ment of the FEC].\ He believes that \until any re- examination takes place ... the ex- isting distortion of speech caused by the halfway house [the Supreme Court] created in Buckley ought to be eliminated.\ Pro-Kremlin Party Reaches Deal with Communists· by Dan Kirsch StcrffWriter Last Thursday a deal was an- nounced between the Russian Connnunistparty and the pro-:gov- emment Unity bloc. The deal they have struck divides most commit- tee chairmanships and parliamen- tary leadership posts between them in the new Duma (parliament), This has come as a great shock to many Western observ-ers, who never expected collusion between the centrist Unity and the Commu- nists. The Kremlin, however, de- nies any type of collusion or Com- munist resurgence. The Movement for Regional Unity,. or Unity \Bear\ bloc is known to be entirely under the con- trol of the Kremlin, whose new chiefs-Acting President Vladimir V. Putin's-popularity propelled the .party to electoral success that was thought to finally oust the Connnunists from their dominance of the Duma. Instead, the deal, as outlined and nearly fmalized, is as follows: the speaker-ship goes to the previous Duma's speaker, Gennady Seleznev, a Communist who worked well with then-Presi- dent Yeltsin, the fiye deputy speaker.,.ships will go to members of Unity, the center-left People's Deputies bloc, the Agro-Industrial (agrarian Communist sympathiz- ers) bloc, the regional Russia's Regions bloc, and the ultra-nation- alist Zhirinovsky Bloc. The Com- munists will control eight commit- tees, Unity seven, the People's Deputies five, the Agro-Industria1 bloc ()ne,the Zhirinovsky Bloc one, and Russia • s Regions one. The heretofore pro-Putin Union of RightForces{SPS) and the center- left Fatherland-All Russia bloc (OVR) were.both offered one com- mittee each, ao.d1he hberal Yabloko was ()£fered none.

The boycott lasted for nearly a week, but it's seemingly ended with a whimper, the so-called Coordina- tion Council of the four parties vir- tually ceasing coordination efforts, Russia's Regions' accepting a committee chairmanship and a deputy speaker-ship, and SPS agreeing to return to the Duma, with leadership posts to be named later. The Duma's speaker, : '\ Vladimir V. Putin, who is c~aign­ ing for formal election March 26, met with several leaders of these centrist parties; he signaled his continued willingness to work pri- marily with Unity and the Union of Right Forces in passing legislation, the latter's return was assured. \We are interested in close knit work of the right-wing forces,\ said Putin. Putin also chose in a nationally broadcast television interview to explicitly reiterate his ideological and policy differences with the t() many Russians when a party tllat is virtually the puppet of the Kremlin cuts a deal with the his- bricallyautboritarian Connnunists for control of the nation's primary l~gislative body. Both Putin and Kremlin insider-rumored oligarchic tycoon-newly elected member of t~e Duma Botis Betezovsky have denied reports that the alliance is strategic ot permanent. \[The Communists] are a real political force in the country. And despite the fact that I often said that in the previous period their role was es- sentially negative, I think that in many cases [now] the Duma won't be in opposition to the authorities. And that's the most important question for Russia today - .. con- solidation of power,\ said Berezovsky. It is entirely possible, also, that Putin has decided to move towards a more involved role of the gov- ernment in the ecpnorny, without the re-nationalization of industry. He has made clear in several pub- lic pronouncements that he has no intention of doing that. His think tank in Russia, the Center for Stra- tegic Research, has called for lib- eralism that would be facilitated between cooperation between the right and left ()[Russia's political Spectrum. Further possible rea- sons include Mr. Berezovsky's opinion: the simple weakness of the alliance of the Union of Right Forces-itself a small party and a collection of several even smaller parties-and the rest of the oppo- sition. This alliance with the Commu- nists could simply be a tool to guar· an tee a sort of national unity gov- ernance that would ensure stabil- ity in the future, and an attempt to move toward a more bilateral party system of right and left, freezing out fringe and smaller parties. Whatever the motivation behind the deal, it is certainly the closest the Kremlin has fonnally associated with the C()mmunists in several years, and judging by the polls, it has not affected Mr. Putin 's popu- larity or presidential hopes at all, and may have even increased them.

''Bringing· Traditional Collegiate Athleticism into·the 21st Century'' Indoor Track Gets Sweaty af Hamilton by Frank Filiciotto Contributing Writer Snow plummeted to the ground in great bundles. The bitter cold air slashed through the jackets of those who challenged the great outdoors, Slippery roads and icy paths led to much trouble while those remaining ~doors were re- luctant to leave the comfort of their warm homes. This was a common scene on January 22, 2000, with temperatures falling below zero. The setting inside the Hamilton College Fieldhouse, however, was quite different. Runners, jumpers, and throwers were eager to perform for the first time this season and the electricity created by their showings made for a perfect, rather warm climate inside the fieldhouse. Much different in nature than cross-country, indoor track allows runners of all abilities to experiment with handfuls of diverse events, both track and field related. Some may be just as grueling as the in- tense five-mile footrace, while oth- ers may be a little less extreme. Re- gardless of the stature, every event proposes a challenge and Union College succeeded in meeting that challenge and conquering it. Al- though a powerful Hamilton squad ousted both the men's and women's teams, Union did an ex- cellent job both on and off the track. Final scores were as follows: Men: Hamilton 96, Union 77; Women: Hamilton 92, Union 49. Union College seemed to have an excellent day in the field, win- ning several of the throwing and jumping events. In the 20-pound weight throw, freshman Sarah Peach took the victory with a throw of 8.58 meters. Senior Carolyn Cieslowski w<>n the women's shot with a throw of9.56meters. The men's shot J}Ut was won by fresh- man Justin Sievert with a throw of 13.12 meters. Sophomore Shawn Shopmyer finished second. Sophomore Kris Darlington won both the men's triple and long jumps with jumps of12.37 meters and 5.87 meters, respectively. Se- nior Jordanna Mallach won the women's pole vault with a jump of 7:6 feet while Adam Schwaber was victorious in the men's pole vault with a height of 3.05 meters. Stephen Erickson prevailed in the men's high jump with a perfonnance of1.83 meters. In the running events, Union looked especially sharp, winning four events. Sophomore sensation Atsu Kaneko won both the 55 and 200-meter dashes with times of7.02 seconds and 24.63 seconds, re- spectively. In the women's 200 meter dash, Union took second through fifth places with Freshmen Ashley Rinear, Terra Lederhouse, Katie Higley, and Katie Round. Higley also won the women's400- meter dash in a time of 66.34 sec- onds. Finishing second in the men's 500-meter dash was Jon Nieman with a time .of 1:12.49. Finally, Sophomore Laura Kelmanovichran a great race in the women's 3000- meter run and finished second. Junior John Houghton placed fourth in the men's 3000-meter run. There is something about team- work that plays a huge role in track and field. Although the emphasis was not placed on relays this week- end due to the fact that many of our runners were worn out from previous events, Coach Cottrell plans to put out an excellent men's and women's 4x400 and4x800 by the end of the season. Vying for four spots on a relay can create a lot of tension on a team. With a surplus of quarter-miters and half-milers, Union's Indoor Track Team looks forward to com- peting with the best of New York and the US in these relays. Until then, the hard work and intense workouts continue. When it comes time for a meet, Union will be ready and a championship team will be born. As in any team rivalry, the Union Track and Field Team held its own this past weekend at RPI. After a hard, intense week of training, both the women and the men stood strong against a powerful engineer squad. All of the athletes, several of whom have run through extreme pain during the last two weeks, kept up the hard wot:k and didn't let the sliJ:!:htest aclle come into pia)'. The day was hig:hlighted by the men's 4:x400 meter re- lay team. Not only did the re- lay dose out a loag day, but it c lose.d <1ut loag day onan e:xtremely high note and gave e11ch member ()D tbe team a bo(lst in confi- de~ce. With Atsu Kaneko as the leadoff leg, Union was sure to get a lead right the bat Jerald Whittington, J o 11n Nieman, a!ld Steve .. Schuler fol- l<Jwed and kept the small, yet File Pbe1to The Field Events proved to be an asset to the Indoor Track Team at their me:ets: everincreasing ~-----~-,---------------~--------­ lead. The fmal time of3:45.2re- suJted in the fastest 4x400 time {)f the year and a victory over RPI, the first victory in a long time. Prior to the final relay, otb.ernote- worthy performances were tallied. Whittington, a multi-event athlete, pr<Jved to be spectacular in the 50- rn<eter hurdles, running a 7.86 and murowly missing the qualifyil)g time for sates. Kaneko, one of the sleekest men out on the track, continued his rdgn with a second place finish in tlte 45-rneter dash. Later in the day, Junior Jeff Morse provided some energy in tlte 1500 meter run with a sixth pbce fmish and a time of 4:31.03. Matching Morse's excellent per- formance was Kris Darlington in tlte triple; long, and high jumps. Darlington finished second and tltird in the triple and long lum:ps, respectively and later combined with Stephen Erickson, Chris Burns, mdMatt Lallier for a 1, 2,. 3, 4 sweepin the high jump. The per- forinarJ.oes in the field were impec- cable md therefore difficult for RPI to handle In the women's events, Fresh~ man Katie Round turned in an im- pressive showing in the 45-meter dash with a second place fmish. Freslumn Katie Higley matched Round's performance with a sec~ ond place fmish in both the long jump <Utd the 300-meter dash. Ju:ri- ior Ma~ie Maurer placed third in the 1S()Ometers with a time of 5:28.83. Last 'but certainly not least, Soph()more Laura Kelmanovich contin.11ed to tough out the long distan.ce with a seventh place, 24:53.tiflllish in the 5000met~rrun. This t\>venty-eight lap race on RPI's tight tra.~k proved to be harsh <md gruelhtg as the runners trekked along 1h:e path counting down laps as they went along. Once again, Union proved to have the upper hand in the field events. Megan O'Donnell pre- vailed in the women ,s high jUlllp with a height on 4 feet 8 inches.

Skating DutchWomen Hand Bates College 4-2 Defeat by R~chel Bukowski Sports Editor On Saturday night, .the Union CollegeSkatingDutchwomentook to the ice atAchilles Rink in hopes of attaining th~ir .second win as a Division Three Varsity Team:. Their opponent was Ba,t~s College, a team whose situation was very simi\ lar to that of the Dutchwomen. Bates entered th.e:ir game against Union with an overall record of 1- 11 and a conference record ofD-9. It appeared that Union could emerge victorious from Achilles that night, but it would be a hard- f<)ught battle from the very begin- nmg. Bates came out strong against the Dutch women's defense and scored just two minutes into the first period on an unassisted goal, which w;:~s slipped neatly into the net hehind Union Goalie Michelle Tardiff. The Skating Dutchwomen came back quickly though, when Cap- tain Melissa J ohrtson scored an unassisted goal three minutes later to tie the score at one. the Union offense immediately became fired up and turned on the heat against Bates. Ailsa Cumming Scored less than a tnmute later, assisted by Paula Denema to make the score put Union ahead, 2-l. The Dutchwomen entered the .locker roomatthe end of the first period leading, 2-1. This· is the first time that Union ended the frrstpe- . riod ahead oftheir opponents since their 12-2rout ofMIT on Decem- ber 5, 1999 .. They enteredthe sec- ond perit>d with the hopes that they could tetain and possibly extend thislead and defeat Bates, whc.:>se players were beginning to show early signs of fatigue. Bates would strike first in the second peJiod, however, and tie the s<:ore at two with a goal' by Liz Schliftman, her second of the night, at 9:42. The score would not temainiua deadlock fo.rlong, howev~r, as Johnson woul<!once ag~in put one behind the Bates. goalie only \l minute and a h~df later to put Union ahead by one. The secc;>nd period ended and Union entered the third period needing to hold on to thelf pre- cariouson\-point lead in order to clinch tl1e victory. The third .period, however, would bting a number ofunex- pected twists that would leave the entire Dutch woman squad uncer- tain about the O\ltcome until the very end. BethGabriel, assisted by Johnson and Michelle Stein, scored the first goal of the period to give Union a, more comfortable lead, 4-2, going into the fmal min- utes of the game. Penalties soon began to hurt the D1,1tchwomen, however, .as Jessica Eaton almost consecutively received two pen- alties itithe last four minutes of the game, one for high-sticking and another for checking. Be- caus~ ofth.is, Union had to pla:y these crucial four minutes slJ.Olt- handed. Despite the fact that Bates pulled its goalie, giving them a six-on-four advantage, the D11tchwomen managed to prevail and prevent any Bates goals. Tardiff ended the game with an 11- save performance, and Union outshot Bates 44-13, quite a sizeable margin for a teanJ. that has been con- sistently outshot over the course of the season. After the game, an ecstatic Michelle Stein stated, \We are so excited that all of our hard work h~;J.s fmally paid off and we now have a victory to show for it.\ The following night, however, was not as pleasant for the Skat- ing Dutchwomen as the previous night had been. They were matched up against Southern Maine, who posted an overall7 -6 A Dutchwom'an Hockey player maneuvers around her .opponent . record entering their game against Union, and were ranked tenth in the ECAC. Union knew that this game was winnable, but they would need to tight hard and pia y like they had the night before. In the first period, it appeared as if Union could hold their own against Southern Maine, as both teams held the other to just one point apiece with the Union goal being accredited to Eaton. South- em Maine, however, completely destroyed the Union offensive at- tack and broke apart their defense in the second period and put four goals hehind Tardiff. The Dutchwomcn were unahle to re· spond to this tirade of goJis and the score was 5- I Jt the end of thl' second period. The third period was basically a repeat of the sec- ond, with Southern Marne scoring three times and the Union offense unable to respond. The game ended in an 8-1 defeat for Union. Junior Cally Woodard was pleased with the way the team came out hard on Sunday night. \We needed to come out hard, which we did very efficiently,\ stated Woodard. \Now we just need to play a full 60 minutes of hockey and we can be much more competitive against some of the better teams in the ECAC. This weekend, the Skating Dutchwomen will be on the road as they travel to Sacred Heart and Connecticut College. They wi.Jl then return to Achilles the follow- ing weekend to battle Trinity and Wesleyan. Bye Week Lets Skating Dutchmen Catch Their Breath byD.J.Book Stt,zff Writer The Skating Dutchmen enjoyed last weekend off, Friday a11d Sat- urday, January 21 and 22, respec- tively. They will be hack in action this coming weekend on the road. On Friday night, January 28, Union will travel to Yale University to battle the Blue Bulldogs. The fol- lowing evening, Saturday, January 29, the Dutchmen will face-off at Princeton University against the Tigers. Both games will start at 7:00PM, and both games will be broadcasted live on WRUC 89.7 starting with a pre-game show at 6:45 PM before each game. Last Sunday night, January 23, on \Prime Time Sports\ from 7-9 PM, David Brooks and I had a chance to sit down with junior for- ward and Captain Jay Varady and freshman defenseman Jason Kean live on WRUC 89.7 and received some feedback about the team's · progress so far this season. Varady, who experienced last year;s dismal overall, record, said, ''The difference between last year's team and this year's is that we seem to be getting the bounces in our favor because of our hard work. We are winning more of the one- goal games and everyone is con- tributing~ even a lot of the fresh- man.\ Kean agreed. He said, \I have no regrets about coming here this year. The coaching staff is great, they wor1.< with us and support us. I think we've been getting pro- gressively better all season as a team. We h.ope to continue to play well.\ the league will be tallying the standings this yeat (via win percentage and not total wins) d1te to the University of Vermont's termination of the rest of their season, Union is presently ranked ninth. Their two competitors this In the ECAC conference games, Union has scored half of its total goal scoring (12 of its 24 goals) af- ter the second period. Union's tate rush of scoring proves that the team does not give up in games when they are trailing. As we saw SID/CP Some time offhas prepared Union f()r this weekend's games against Yale and Princeton. With ten ECAC contests behind them and eleven more remaining, the Dutclunell have amassed a record offour wins, six losses, and zero ties in conference play. Because of the new way that weekend, Yale and Princeton, are ranked thiJ:d and tied fot fourth, respectively, so the Dutchmen can gain some ground on the rest of.the league with a couple of wins t!tis weekend. against RPI two weeks ago, the game is never over and a winner not determined untilthe fmal buzzer sounds. In twenty overall games played, Senior Defensemen Jeff Sproat leads the league in shorthanded points with three, including two goals. He is also second in the league in scoring for defensemen with fifteen points, in twenty over- allgames. Junior forward Jason Ralph is the only Dutchmen to average a point per game (PPG) or more in conference play. His current aver- age is 1.00 PPG, which includes five goals and five assists, in ten games played. So.phomore goaltender Brandon Snee has seen over 575 minutes of action between the pipes in ECAC games for the Dutchmen this season. That is cur- rently second among goaltenders in the conference. The next home game at A chillies Rink will he played Thursday evening, February 3, against Dartmouth College. Game time is scheduled for 7:00PM. Come out and brave the cold in order to sup- port the Dutchmen. After the Whistle After twenty total games played, four skating Dutchmen are averag- ing over a half a point per game. Ralphisfrrstaveraging0.85 PPG(8 goals, 9 assists, 17 points). He is followed by Sproat, averaging 0. 75 PPG ( 4 goals, 11 assists, 15 points), junior forward Clark Jones, aver- aging 0.65 PPG (5 goals, 8 assists, 13 points), and fmally, sophomore forwardJeffWilson, averaging 0.60 PPG (5 goals, 7 assists, 12 points). ..

After the first half, however, l 1 nion found themselves ahead of the Engineers, 30-24. The Engi- neers would put on an astounding second half rally. RPI closed the gam<.: by shooting 40% from the floor and outscoring the Dutchmen 4~-33 in the second half en route to a 67-63 victory. The Dutchmen grabbed 24 de- frnsive rebounds, and the Engi- neers had 21 offensive boards. \\\' e need to he gnbbing 65\~. of the defensive boards.\ stated head cuach Bob Montana. The Dutch- men, however, managed Oilly 53% of the defens.ive boards against Rensselaer. The Engineers out-re- bounded Union, 47-38. Sophomore C.J. Rodgers, led the team in scoring with 21 points and also grabbed seven boards. Team- mate Aaron Galletta had 15 mark- ers as did Junior Ryan Murray. Galletta also-contributed seven re- bounds. Later that week, things got even worse for Union after their disap- pointing loss. After further exami- nation, Musella learned that he will miss the entire season and will un- dergo reconstructive surgery next month. Although it is too early to tell, speculation is that Musella won't be back on the court until late August or early September. Montana added, \It is one '()f the toughest things to deal witll as a player. Ifhe works hard and rehab goes well, he will be back before school starts next year.\ On. Saturday, the Dutchmen again hopped back on the btas, this timctraveling into Vermont te take on Middlebury College. In what Montana called \one of the most challenging places to play,\ the Dutchmen were able to play effec- tively. With 15:04leftinthegame, Union took its first leadofthe game after a Gall'etta three-pointergave Union a 45-43 lead. The Panthers re- sponded, however, going on a 9c2 run that would ultimately put the game away for Middlebury, giving the Dutchmen three hard lasses in a row. R01<:lgers scored a career-lligh 25 po mts and led the Dutchmen on the boards with 15. Galletta fm- ished with 14 points and Murray added 11 ofhis own. Galletta said, \When we lost Dav:e [Musella], we lost 20 points per game. Add that to our recent poor execution, and the result is not always go()d.\ The Sb.ooting Dutclrmenwereplaying with only three substitutes the whole game. Musella and I>an Bamford were both out with injuries, while Sophomore Guard Dan D()wling was gone for the weekend for per- sona 1 reasons. In addition t() these difficult gaps to fill, SeniorCaptain Dave Copeland is in Turkey for the week, participating in anen~ineer- ing contest with six other Union students. The loss was Union's fifth in its last.six games. Montana is clearly not upset with the play of the team, but emphasizes the fact that the team needs to execute better in or- der to win their games. Despite blizzard conditions on Tuesday, the Hartwick Hawks trav- eledto Memorial Field House for a non league battle. The Dutchmen found their rhythm early and of- ten. Despite a poor fan turnout, Union was fired up. The cruised past the Hawks, 81-66, and ended a three game skid. Galletta matched his jersey number with 34 ;poipts on the night and also added three boards. Rodgers chipped in 13 points and eight boards while Murray contributed nine points of his own. The Shooting Dutchmen, play- ing with a depleted bench for the second game in a row, improved their overall record to 10-6. Union's offense has cooled off since the beginning of the season. \Teams are doing a better job de- fending us and teams in the league ate more familiar with us,\ said Montana. He continued by say- ing, .. We need to work on our mo- tion offense and do a better job on the defensive rebounding.\ Galletta added, \We are playing better teams now, and defenses are doing a better job containing our offense.\ Tile Dutchmen will travel to Cazenovia College tomouow and will travel to Skidmore on Tuesday even mg.

'- -- Union Downed By Both RPI and Middlebury Dutch women Having Trouble With Second-Half Play by Meridith Chace St!?/f Writer The Union Women's Basketball ream suffered two tough losses this past week. The Dutcll\vomen played hard. hut failed to over- come RPI and Middlebury C'ol- lcgc. At R PI on Tuesday. Union played a smart defensive game. as did their opponent; ·herefClre. both teams had low scoring, as the final score was only 51-38. The game started off very slow, and rebounding proved to be a maJor factor. The game was tied 20- 20 at half time, but RPI outscored the Dutchwomen 3 1 to 1 8 in the second half to take the victory out of Union's hands. Erin McNamara had 13 points in the loss, and Katie Smith contrib- uted 11 points while Leah Oliveiri grabbed eight rebounds for her team. RPI clearly beat out Union on the boards. which proved to be fatal to the Dutchwomen's game play. Coach Mary Ellen Burt had an- ticipated the offensive struggle in the game. She stated, \We knew it would be a very defensrve game with the battle being won or lost on the boards, which it was.\ On Saturday, Union hosted Middlebury, the numller-one ranked team in the Northeast Re- gion. At the start of the game, l J nion looked as if they could pos- sibly take it. They came right out and snagged the lead, outshooting Middlebury, 17-5. However, Middlebury was able to fight back and they took the one-point lead, 29-lR. at halftime. ('()ruing out of the locker room for the second half, Union contin- ued to go at Middlebmy, keeping the game very close. In tile final minutes of the second half., Union fell.apart, and Middlebwy was able to put the Dutch women away, win- ning by a score of 63-52. Smith lead Union's offehsive at- tack with 16 points and nine re- bounds while McNamara contrib- uted nine points and grabbed seven rebounds. Coach Burt was proud of her team's effort, explaining, \We came right out after them in the first half •and knocked them back on their heels. Butthe sign of a top team is to battle back and Middlebury did. I thought we showed heart and ef- fort by staying with their runs. It reaEly was a closer game than the fimd score showed ... Union's overall record is now 8- 7, and they are 2-4 in the UCAA. The Dutchwomen will host Hartwick for a UCAA contest on Tuesday at 6:00 and will travel to Russell Sage this Friday.

,, Broomball: Union's Most Popular Night Sport by Brian Ter:linsl<y Sports Edf.t~JJr It's getting late oh a Monday or Tuesday night during the winter term and your just about to head for the sheets. You' r~ finishing some loose ends of homework for the next day of class. And then, suddenly, you get thatph.one call fiom your teammate reminding you to get ready, grab yourglovesand bead over to the rink. Why? Be- cause you have a broomhall game tonight. A once tired studenttl;ansf<>rms into a rejuvenated aal .excited player, ready for somernid-even:ing exercise and fun on the ice of Achil- les Rink. Yes, broombaU for years now has been one ofUnion's most popular intramtiral sports. There's no real reason why, but for o11e, it gives students the chance t<l take their stresses and built-up adrenaline out on the ice and compete during the late hours of the week-night, lt' s not unusual for a team to have their own egos, jerseys~ decorated sticks and sometimes old hockey pads. For the most part, e;ach frater- nity has always had thei:Iowrt long tradition ofbroombaU teams that have carried on for years, just with new faces every year. 'It is safe to say, 'however; that broornbalt defi- nitdy brings. out some iiitramural spc:lrtsmanship betwee:n the stu- dents on this campus. It's amazing how before each game a given team will come<togethe:r ,l.n1JJI.u~dle and discuss scoring strategies, pass- ing techniques and goalie actions. All tb.is in order to make the effort to pu.t that small soccer ball into the large hockey net. There no doubtthateveryteam wants to be on top of the standings and have the chance of winning the champi- onship at the end efthe term. Aad it's amazing how many people will come early to their game just ·to see the other teams play, scout out the other players, watch students fall, miss shots and dive for the ball. Although there may be some scuffles and hard hits in the men's leagues, the students generally agree that their forty minutes on the ice every week is a great time, Today at Union, broomba11 has made itself into such apop1,1lar in- tramural that both men's and women's teams have be. en divided up Into several leagues due to the. lange number of teams. that have formed. There is also a new co-ed league now, which now puts both men and women together on the ice fighting, tackling, sliding with e(!.ch other. Sounds a little kinky, but it's all ih good fun. In other intramural news, the fac- u'lty intramural ice hockey team is excited to report that they has be- gun their season on a 2-0 winning streak. This is their best start in years according to a close source to the team and they ex- pect to win the championship at the end ,of the tenn. Their first win came from a forfeit, wb.ile their secoad victory came on Sunday night against Psi U, by the score of 3-2. Engineering professer Andy Wolfe had a stellar night in goal, while Dean Alford, Pro- fessor Scullion andalumni Mark Will lead the offensive attack. For all the news &nd current standings for all intramural sports, check the bulletin board across from the cage in the Alumni gym. Elizab Daigle/CP It's pretty hard run on ice, whi~e ~rying to control the ball. '· ' 1.: . ' In The Paint: This Week in College Basketball by Ben Y afiee Staf!Writer Carolina /Jlues When Ed Cota deci<ied to return for his senior year, it was expected that Caroliha would m11.ke a strong push for the national championship. With tb.e return of Cota, the Tarheels boasted an inside-outside game th11.t few could match. Fans were.saliva:ting over the dangerous duo ofCota and 7'0\ center Brendon Haywood. Haywood is a tremend()US force, who has the size and ab.ility t<> take. over a game. Joining Haywood u:p front are talented sophomores K.ris Lang and Jason Capel. Lang's sweet hook shot is virtually llllstoppable and Capel sho-wed solid improve11.1ent from bl:s freshman year. The fmal piece <1fthe puzzle was thought to be top recruit, Joe Forte. Forte is a sweet sao()ter who would compliment Cota in the backcourt. Forte an-d Carolina ·jumped out of the blocks early this season while playing in the Maui Invitational. The freshman was spectacular, scoring 24 points on 9-12 shooting in his ftr:st game and was named the MVPof the Maui Invitational. Cota a1so looked impressive as he pounded the ba:l'l inside to Haywood and found Fort~ for open jumpet:s. :He aver~g~<ll7 . .5 points and 8 assists in the three game tournament. Expectations surrounding the team only grew and it looked like Carolina would cruts.e through the regular season and win more than 20 games for the JO consecutive year. Not so fast. Since coming back to the mainland, Carolina has l.ooked nothing like the cohesive unit that won in Maui. Since opening the season 3-0 they have gone an unimpressive 8-8 and have dropped their last four_ The four consecutive losses are a first at Carolina since 1992 when Dean Smith was coaching. With the talent Carolina possesses, the basketball world is in shock. The four losses knocked the Tafheels out of the top 25 for the frrst time since 1990 and their streak of 25 consecutive NCAA ap:pearances is in serious jeopardy. Many things have contributed to North Carolina's losing ways, bui a few things. that have gotten my attention include; the poor play Qf Haywood, Cota's limited offense, and the number of shots taken by the freshman Forte. Haywood has been a non-factor in several games. With a body similar to ShaquilleO'Nealwhenheplayed in college; Haywood should consistently grab 10 rebounds and SCQte 15 points. This has not happened. In losses to Michigan St. and Cincinnati, Haywood grabbed a total of 3 rebounds. A man of his stature needs to get more than one rebound a game. More imp,ortantly, North Carolina's center needs to grab more than one rebound a game. He has failed to play physically and plays with little aggression. He has quickly been labeled as soft and lost any intimidation his impressive size gave him. During the four game losing streak, Cota averaged<Jnly 8 points and took 8 shots a game. Although Cota is the point guard and his first duty is to get everyone involved, this Carolina team needs him to take more shots. Instead, they have relied on Forte. Forte is talented, but he is young and extremely streaky. Forte cannot put up 16 shots like he did in three ofthe last four Carolina losses. The Tarheels need to reestablish their inside game. Their success comes when they pound the ball inside to the dominant Haywood and sophomores Kris Lang and Jason Capel. This opens up shots for Forte and frees up Cota to penetrate. Carolina needs to get back to their strong iaside outside game if they want to keep their many streaks alive. Loser of the Week St.John's This past weekend, Red Storm blew a i 0-point lead with under three minutes remaining against Ohio St. St. John'sle:dformostof the game, but played carelessly in the fmal minutes and were stwmed on their home court. The Red Storm committed several turnovers down the stretch and Ohio St. took advantage. Erik Barkley had a chance to win it at the buzzer, but his shot was blocked by Sconnie Penn. Johnnie's are the losers of the week. Game of the Week Ohio St. vs Purdue~ January 29 Ohio St. has again began playing the type ofbasketball that led them to the fmal four last March. They are coming off impressive wins over Michigan St. and St. John's and they fmd themselves tied with Purdue at the top of the Big Ten standings. Purdue has also played well and comes off a huge win against Indiana. Question of the week: Who do you think will win the Superbowl? Send your thoughts. to bukowskr@union.edu or terlinsb@union.edu.

It's j!Ot unusual for a team to have thein own egos, jerseys, decorated stichs and sometimes old hockey pad:s. For the most part, each frater- nity has always had their own long traditiion of broomball teams that havli! carried on for years, just with new faces every year. It is safe to say, !\Low ever, that broomball defi- nitely- brings out some intramural sp()Jtsmanship between the stu- de!l1ls on this campus. It's amazing howhefore each game a given team wil1 C•()me together in a huddle and discuss scoring strategies, pass- ing techniques and goalie actions. All this in order to make the effort to put that small soccer ball into the large hockey net. There no doubt that every team wants to be on top of the standings and have the chance of winning the champi- onship at the end of the term. Aad it's amazing lmw many people will come early to their game just to see the other teams play, scout out the other players, watch students fall, miss shots and dive for the ball. Although there may be some scuffles and hard hits in the men's leagues, the students generally agree that their forty minutes on the ice every week is a great time. Today at Union, broomball bas made itself into such a popular in- tramural that both men's and \\ un1en' s h:ams ha\·e been diviJcd up into scveralleagues due to the larrge number of teams that have fanned. There is also a new co-ed lcat;ue now, which no1v puts both mcn and wom~~n together on the icc fighting, tackling, slidiHg \\ ith each other. Sounds a little kinky, but it's all in good fun. In other intramural ne\\S, the fac- ultJ intramural ice hockey team is excited to report that th.ey has be- gun their season on a 2-0 winning streak. This is their best start in years according to a dose source to the team and they ex- pect to win the championship at the end of the term.

With the return of Colla, the Tarheels boasted an imi d~;;-outside game that few could matcll. Fans were salivating over the dangerous duo of Cota and 7 '0\ center Brendan Hayvvood. Ha)'V'Iood is a tremendous force, w Ito l1as the size and ability to take over ;a game. J(Ji ning Haywood up front are talented sophomores Kris Lang and Jason Capel. Lang's sweet hook shot is virtually unstoppable and Capel showed solid impr()vement from his freslunan yerur. The final piece of the puzzle wa.s t!hought to be top recruit, Joe F<lrle. Forte is a sweet shooter who wo1lld compliment Cota in the back.court. Forte and Carolina jum):led out of the blocks early this season while playing in the Maui Imr.it a tiona!. The freshman was spectlacular, scoring 24 points on 9-1 2 shooting in his first game and W\\5 mamed the MVP of the Maui Imr1t;ational. Cata also looked impressive as he !J'Dunded the ball inside to I I:!J''.vood and found Forte for open JUmpers. He averaged 17.5 points and & assists in the three game tournament. Expectations surrounding the team only grew and it looked like Carolina would crurse through the regular season and win more than 20 games for the 30 consecutive year. Not so fast. Since coming back to the mainland, Carolina has looked nothing like the cohesive unit that won in Maui. Since opening the season 3-0 they have gone an unimpressive 8-8 and have dropped their last four. The four consecutive losses are a first at Carolina since 1992 when Dean Smith was coaching. With the talent Carolina possesses, the basketball world is in shock. The four losses knocked the Tarheels out of the top 25 for the first time since 1990 and their streak of 25 consecutive NCAA appearances is in serious jeopardy. Many things have contributed to North Carolina's losing ways, but a few things that have gotten my attention include; the poor play of Haywood, Cota's limited offense, and the number of shots taken by the freshman Forte. Haywood has been a non- factor in several games. With a body similar to Shaquille 0 'Neal when he played in college, Haywood should consistently grab 10 rebounds and score 15 points. This has not happened. In losses to Michigan St. and Cincinnati, Haywood grabbed a total of3 rebounds. A man ofhis stature needs to get more than one rebound a game. More importantly, North Carolina's center needs to grab more than one rebmmd a game. He has failed to play physically and plays with little aggression. He has quickly been labeled as soft and lost any intimidation his impressive size ga·vehim. During the four game losing streak, Cota averaged only 8 points and took 8 shots a game. Although Cota is the point guard and his first duty is to get everyone involved, this Carolina team needs him to take more shots. Instead, they have relied on Forte. Forte is talented, but he is young and extremely streaky. Forte cannot put up 16 sh()ts like he did in three of the last four Carolina losses. The Tarheels need to reestablish their inside game. Their success comes when they potmd the ball inside to the dominant Haywood and sophomores Kris Lang and Jason Capel. This opens up shots for Forte and frees up Cota to penetrate. Carolina needs to get bac:k to their strong imide outside game if they want to keep their many streaks alive. Loser of the Week St. John's This past weekend, Red Storm ble\.V a 1 0-point lead with under tluee minutes remaining against Ohio St. St. Jolm 'sled for most of the game, but played carelessly in the final minutes and were stunned on their home court. The Red Stom1 committed several tumovers down the stretch and Ohio St. took advantage. Erik Barkley had a chance to win it at the buzzer, but his shot was blocked by Sconnie Penn. Johnnie's are the losers of the week. Game of the Week Ohio St. vs Purdue, January 29 Ohio St. has .again began play1ng the type of basketball that led them to the final fotu last March. They are coming off 1mpress1ve wms over M1chigan St. and St. John's and they find themselves tied with Purdue at the top of the Big Ten standings.

They beat RPI, 145-96, butthen losttoMiddlebury, 89-190. Last Wednesday, the Dutchwomen traveled the thirty minutes into Tmy to swim in the cold water of Rensselaer Polytech- nic Institute. The Dutchwomen controlled the meet right fro:mtheflrsttwo events with juniors Sarah Rankowitz, Vic Dreier, Rachel Miller, and Senior Captain Clewis Kianett placing first in the 200-yard medley relay and Senior Captain Kerry Librandi swam to her first of two wins ofthe meet in the thousand-yard freestyle. Even though she came in a very close second in the 200-yard freestyle, Miller proved to herself and to the team that she can per- form exceptionally well in events other than the sprint freestyle . She swam a best time of2:05.34 in the 200-yard freestyle, obtaining the four points for second place. \I was so happy with that time,\ ex- claimed Miller. \The 200 wasn'tas bad as I thought it was going to be, and I even felt good during the race. I lrnow I can take it out so much faster next time and I'm re- ally excited to swim it at states.\ Librandi g;ot her second win of the meet in the 500-yardfreestyle. Librandi, Freshmen Lauren Wan- der, Anna Sluzar, and Sophomore Cori Verrill went one-two-three-four in the twenty-lap event shutting out any RPI scoring. With Sopb.omores Sarah Ellman and Katie Meloney winning the one-meter and three-meter diving events, respectively, and senior Erin Wittes having another triple first place meet, tb.e Dutchwomen were able to convincingly put the Engineers away. Wittes, Union's most versatile swirn.Iller won the 2()0-yard individual medley, the lOO·yard butterfly, and the 100- yard breaststroke. The meet with Middlebury, how- ever, was a completely different affair. Since the home team gets to pick the set-up for the meet, the twoteamsswama.lllOO's and 50's of strokes in the meet on Saturday. It was an atypical meet for the Uni()n women, because unlike Middlebury, wb:o swims those short races in its .s1ate meet, Union has !lever competed in the 50- yard events. \Even though we don\t ever swiin 50's,\ commented Rank:owitz, \it was fun to have a change of pace .. \ The only swimming win that Union could muster happened to be a close one. Though she was not feeling well on Saturday, Librandi put her pain aside and swam an incredible 200-.yard freestyle to sco:re valuable points for the teaii,l. Sheer determination helped Librandi win the race with a time of2:05.65. Middlebury'ssec- ondplace swimmer finished wifua 2:05.66, and their third place finisher swama2:05.67. \GoodthingKerty didn't cut her flngemails,\ joked a happy fan. The .only other· first place tbat the Dutchwomen received was from diverSarahEllman-on the one- meter board. \The girl I dave against was very good, but she chose dives that had lower diffi- culty levels than my dives,\ s.aid Ellman. \Otherwise I could have beaten her on the three-meter, too.\ At their last away meet of the season, the U mion ·urr•rn~·n had fun where they were able to swim well de- spite the odd events. '\A 'lot of the times the girls swam against Middlebury will .end up being entry times for our State Meet,\ explained Head Coach Judy Wolfe. The Dutcbwomen still two more home meets remaining in their season to . h<Jpefully better those times they swam at RP! and Middlebury. They will swim Hamilton College this Satur- day, and will match up against · longtime rival Saint Lawrence the following weekend.

Swimming Dutchmen Remain Positive Despite Rough Waters by Tb2tcnerWoodley St{~fl Writer The Union College Men's Swim- ming and Diving ~earn had two chal- lenging meets tilis past week and swam exceptionally well in both. The first meet was held in RPI's very cold pt)ol. Although the freezing wate.r temperature made it very uncomfortable to swim in the pool. the Union Men's Team was able to ignore this slight drawback and swim several in\'season best times. A highlight ofthe meet was se- nior Clark Smyth's 200-yard freestyle. where he dropped over two seconds off of his best time and just touched out a swimmer from RPI foran ,i£Jcredible first place finish. Freshman Amos Sheldon also had agreat200-yard freestyle, as he broke the two-minute barrier for the first time in his life. In the diving:events Union once again perfotruecl well as the Dutch- men captured first, second and third on the tJrree-meter board and first, third and forth on the one- meter board. Senior Adam Hershman badaparticularly good meet, winning both diving events. Although Union had some great races, they still were not able to come out with a win. It was clear that while Union had more depth than the En.gineers, RPI had more quality swimmers who were able to pull ahea<l early and hold on for a 126-115victory. Despite the loss; however, Union was able to come out of the meet feeling very C()nfident in them- selves as fhe morale was up and the teammates were helping each other throaghout the course of the meet by means of emotional sup- port. Last Satl.lrday the team traveled up to Midcllebury College to swim against ()ne of the best and largest teams in the country. Despite be- ing outnu:mbered significantly, Union was able t() once again keep its morale up and put in a total team effort. Aaron Seliger had one of the best meets ofhis life. He dropped sev- eral.seconds in all ofhis events and tou~hed o1.1t his competitors in his 100 backstroke. Sophomore Thatcher Woodley also dentoQnstrated that he was speedy not only in the water but on land as well as he scampered from the stands to the pool just itt time to swimhisleg of the 200 yard freestyle relay. Divers Adam Hershman, Aaron D 'Addario and Erik Seholm also did well although the:Y did not pla:ce as well as they have in past meets. They were faced with a pair of excellent divers from Middlebury, but rose to the challenge. All in all, the team seems to be coming together. The past two meets li.ave been very inspir:iug and spirits are up. This is the exact thing that is needed for swimmers in the upcoming weeks before states, which, for most of th.e Dutclunen swimmers, will be the bigg~st meet of the year. File P'hoto Juni&r Noah Trueger has been an asset to his team in tile distance events this year. SpQrts
