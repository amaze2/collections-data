An evaluation of these changes is thus in orclel', even as the candidates for Student Council president and secretary map out their campaigns, although such an evaluation is, admittedly, only a short run appraisal. If it has accomplished nothing else, the peesen t cam- paign has certainly stirred up more interest in elections than has existed for the past several years. The percen- tage of students voting was very high. Also. thanks to the chapel prognms, campaign posters and letters, most students were not seeing the names of the eandidates for the first time when they picked up their ballot. Although the camt)aigns have evoked inteTest and familiarized students to some extent with the candidates, little has evolved from them in the way of concrete plat- folms. The major issue seerns to have boiled down to \It's time for a change\ vs. \Don't change horses in the middle of the stream.\ Incumbents pointed to their ex- perience, while challengers avowed that th.e class in ques- tion was stagnating, and that fresh new ideas, which they, of course, had plenty of, were needed. S()rnehow. thoug-h, few of these cit·culation stirring suggestions were bTou_ght forth by any candidates. The promised storm of new ideas was buried amidst the de-luge of rehashed old ones. It must be said, however, in the candichtes' defense, that they did much more than their predecesso1·s of the past few years, and were undoubtedly handicapped some- . what by inexperience and lack of preced~11t. In time, elections may produce many badly needed new ideas. Attempts to organize the election on a patty basis wete doomed to failure. Where no big issues exist, there is no reason to have parties. A controvnsial topic of general int£rest could, at some time in the future, provide the initial push to get a party system rolling. Previously, the lengthliness of the eledion p1·oced UI·es was mentioned. In this connection, a fu:rthe1· discussion of the primary system is in order. It was pointed out in these columns in the :\larch 22 {'oncordimsi.s that pri- maries were the weak link in the election chain. A look at the primary ballots will further attest to this point. It seems somewhat ridiculous to eliminate one out of th1•ee candidates in a pl'imary and then choose between the re- maining two in a separate election. While it may be poor to have a dozen or so candidates, with the 1vinne1· captur- ing about 20 percent of the class vote, is it necessary to eliminate all but two candidates? Perhaps some compro- mise as to the number of candidates is in oJ:\der. A pre- liminary screening committee in place of the pl'imaries would be a worthwhile change. We have stressed the faults in the ne-w system to an excess in the hopes that they will somehow be worked out, for the system has great potential. If the Student Council keeps in mind the fact that this year's elections are a sort of experiment. and u!les the re!lults to conect the flaws which have cropped up, that potential may soon be real- ized.

Letter to the Editor To the Editor of Concordiensis: 'l'here appears to be a rather unfair situation obtaining in the selection of the date of ti{e Jun- ior Promenade. Every year this affair falls on the same weekend during which the Medical Board Examinations are held. Thus, Pre-medical students in their junior year are unable to attend the formal dance, which is actual!)· a culminatory affair. The main reason for the conflict is generally the lack\ of another suitable weekend during which the Junior Prom can be held. I would like to suggest that the dates for Parent's Weekend and the Junior ~om be interchanged. This, it seems clear, would not in any definite way damage the suc- cess of the former while the latter would certainly l;>e enhanced, all juniors being able to attend. I hope the Prom Committee of the class of '58, as well as those of future classes, will look into this fully so that we may have a full and complete Junior Prom- enade. Bruce F. Boklan, '5-8 Maniac at Large :By Ira C. Ha!pl\rin In 1929, in the German city of Duseldorf, a modern Teutonic ''ersion of Jack-the-Ripper roam- ed the streets and terrorized the ritizenry with a ser.ies of brutal murders. These grisly events serve as the basis for Fritz Lang's \M\, a pathological study in hor- ror starring Peter Lorrc. which will be present<'d this enning at 7 and 9 P. M. in EE 22 by the Committee on Lectures and Con- certs. Fritz Lang has managed to capture the .terrible realism of the rnu.rders in all its morbid de- tail and Peter Lorre presents a revolting, yet somehow pathetic, characterization of the demented slayer. From the first time we see his heavy flaccid face with its staring protruding eyes, we are aware that it is the face of the murderer, a Jekyll-and-Hyde creature whose perverted taste runs exclusively to young girls. But Mr, Hyde is, unfortunately for a number of children, the dominant force in the murderer. We are even treated to a scene where he stands before a mirror contorting his pudgy physiognomy into leering grimaces, reminiscent of the transformation of Dr. Jekyll. Thus when, by means of a mirror in the window of a toy shop, he spies a small girl return- ing from school, we can see the maniacal compl.\lsion arise in his twisting , features, yet become suppressed long enough for him to purchase a toy for the girl with which to entice her. Al- though we do not witness the crime, the JSight of the girl's ball rolling dejectedly down the street is grim enoUgh in its implication. The city is close to the pitch of panic, btit the efforts of the erstwhile police commissioner prove fruitless. The harrowed sleuth proceeds with methodical precision and typical Prussian thoroughness Indicative, if any- thing. of a great lack of itnagin- ation, while he is continually be\ ing brow-beaten by his superiors. In his zeal, however, be pressures the m01·e normal and upstanding unde!\World denizens Eio greatly that, dn self defense, they nobly decide to apprehend the mur- derer themselves. Every crook,. from beggar to swindler to second-story man, be- gins the search for the killer and, in the pr.ocess. mauls a number of bystanders who happen to overtly show a liking for small children. A few are even magnanimous enough to undergo apprehension by the bewildered and unbelieving commissioner. But our happy-go- lucky maniac, unaware of the im- minent danger and unconsciously whistling a fragment of a Grieg opera, buys cf balloon from a blind peddler to continue his gruesome preoccupation. This, however, proves to be his fatal act, for when, a few days later, he. blithely passes the blind man whistling the same tune, and after having boasted to the news- papers of his latest crime, the old fellow informs the proper author- ities, the crooks, of his clue. They immediately respond and a chase ensues which is as harrowing for the audience as it is for the mur- derer. Our would-be Jack-the- Ripper is literally a marked man now, for someone has placed an accusing and dramatic \M\ on his back. He is finally caught, but not before we see him in all his revolting majesty, panting in a vain attempt to escape from a locked room, beads of sweat glis- tening ominously on his waxen, contorted face. He is at last taken, shrieking, by the a.ssorted underworld popu- lation, who, with proper civic righteousness, decide to try him ~hemselves, no doubt with every mtent of getting rid of the trou- ble-maker. But the thug appoint- ed his counsel eloquently pleads that his client needs a doctor more than punishment, and the crooks turn him over to the po- lice, a noble gesture on their part, no doubt. Friday, April 13, 1956 Meet Ray Mullane (Continued from Page 1) h~pton, Long Island, as aquatic director. · During his service at Newport, RJhode Island, Ray served as . a Chief Petty Officer in charge of swimming instruction, His naval swimming team won the ;New England Championship. He came to Union in 1947 and started to use his talent for lead\ ershi]> and innate swimming abil- ity to turn out o.utstanding teams. For seven of the eight years that he has 'been here, Mullane's mer- men have lost no more than two meets, \One. of my biggest ambJ.tions,\ he said with his sly grin, '''is to beat Williams more often.\ He added that his squad next year will have ,several exceptional swimmers who should fill the ,gaps caused by graduation. Although swimming and Ray Mullane have been synonomous for almost longer than Ray wants to remember, he nev()r even at- tended a lacrosse game until he arrived at Union. \I started out in 1lt5,0,55 he said, \knowing nothing about the game. Almost immediately I became crazy about it. It's great!\ \The first two years all I could do was get my squads in good physical shape ,while I caught on to the .fine points of the game.

He likes the complusory gym pro\ grrun although he admits that the 'individual sports for sophomores to be implcmen ted next year, will create some p.roblems before H will war!{ smoothly, Mullane ·admits that he always has had fear of drowning and for that reason he would like to see every student learn tq handle himself in the water before he graduates.

Roemish's letter, \vhich ap- pears elsewhere on this page, is on an issue which has caused some controversy and therefore deserves some comment in this space. While the point he has made is valid, in making it he has overstepped in one direction al- most as b~dly as. the Junior Prom chapel skit did in the other. It is possible, while on a topic of this so~t, to get in- volved in a voluminous discussion of religion and sex, with numerous ramifications. Suffice it to say, however, that we feel that the skillful use of some \off-color\ jokes in ' the chapel program was perfectly legitimate. Of course, these jokes have a wide color range, and as the far end of the spectrum is approached, their legitimacy becomes open to doubt. To continue the analogy a bit further, some of the humor in last Tuesday's skit must have been in the ultra-violet al'ea. The1·e was little excuse for the first half of the pro- gram, which was just a conglomoration of lewd uuscen- ities, which were about as subtle as a pie throwing con- test and which had no real hearing on the pm·pose of the whole program. With the exception of the vet·y end, the Junior Prom was hardly mentioned. A poor situation exists \vhen a group given the re- sponsibility for presenting a chapel prog1·am isn't ma- ture enough to draw a line at the right color. Continued demonstrations of ths color blindness will eventually re- sult in the injection of a back seat driver to give direc- tions as to when to stop and when to go.

A graduate of Knox College, Gailsburg, Illinois, she made sure two of her three boys attended her alma mater. Her third son, Thomas, is a Harvard graduate and is in advertising in Illinois. Her \Knox boys,\ Jack and Rich- ard, are respectively a manag·er of a medical clinic and a pilot for TWA. The eight grandchildren are scattered over the country, a fact which she regrets. One of the fdrst things that im- pressed Mrs. Doyle when she came to Union three years ago was the fact that the adjustment to college life was rather trying for some of the new students. Her major aim then, as it is now1 is to provide a little of the home- like atmosphet·e for the fresh- men. Taking Dr. Davidson's advice to \look after the comfort and hap- piness of the boys,\ Mrs. Doyle saw that the recreation room- in the basement of West CoHege wa.s completed and furnished with all necessary equipment.

J4V JAT 5TJU!tt Western Electric development engineer Dick Foster joined Western Electric, the manufacturing and supply unit of the Bell System, in Febru'qry 1952, shortly after earning his B.S. in mechanical engineering at the University of Illinois. As a development engineer on a new automation process Dick first worked at the Hawthome ·W arks in Chicago. Later, he moved to the Montgomery plant at Aurora, Illinois where he is pictured above driving into the parking area. Dlcl<'s day may begin in one of several ways: an informal office chat with his boss, a department \brain session\ to tackle a particularly tough engineering problem (above); working with skilled machine builders in the mechanical development laboratory; m· \on the line\ (below) where he checks performance and quality and looks for new ways to do things. Here Dick and a set'up mao check over tl1e automatic production line used to mimufacture a wire spring relay part for complex telephone switching equipment. This automatic line carries a component of the relay on a recipwcating conveyor through as many as nine different and very precise operations -such as percussive welding in which small block conte<l:ts of palladium are attached to the tips of wires to within a totemnce of ± .002\. Examining the plastic molded \eomb\ components of the wire spring relay Dick recalls his early work when he was involved in working-up forming and coining tools for the pilot model of the automation line for fabrication of wire spring sub-assemblies ]01' relays. A I present he is associated with the expansion of these automation lines at the Montgomery Plant. Dlek fuids tlme for many Western Electric employee activ- ities. Here he is scoring up a spare while tuni1ig up for the engineers' bowling league. Be is a,;tive also in the golf club, cam~ra club, and a professional e1zgineering society.

We know of no one even nearly as qualified, Among the treasures .of the first number are poems by de Ia Mare, Roy Campbell, Auden, Eberhart, Empson, Thomas, Spend·er, Graves, Cummings and Christopher Logue, an impressive new poet, to mention only some. There is a .portrait of de Ia Mare, a little windy, but still fine by Horace Gregory; a criticism on Louis Bogan by Marianne Moore; a criticism on MacNeice by Louise Bogan; and the longest but most lucidly authoritative commentary yet on John Malcolm Brinnin's extremely controversial Dylan Thomas in America by the edi- tor. * * * i. e.

The wor-st thing about PPron's heritage is that it has broken down the national unity of the Argentine p<>ople. The lack of national unity can perhaps be credited in part to the nurrrrous splits in the major po- litical parties of Argentina, in- cluding the Argentine Communist Party. Moreover, there are in- tPr-service rivalril's hel ween the branches of the armed forces. An important · <'hangc is the shifting of Pmphasis formerly placed on political democracy to <>conomic denwcmcy. Both com- mand much support in Arg-entina. The lack of national unity is con- stantly irritated and aggravated by sPveral important social and political pt·oblems. Dr. Whitaker considered Argen- tina to be one of the most im- portant of the Pan American States. Thus our sensitive rela- tionship with Argentina presents n problem of major importance for the United States. He concluded, \While th~ out- look presents cminoils stot·m- clouds on the horizon, if there is any of the 20 I.atin American countries that could cope success- fully with this type of situation, I think it is Argentina.\ Friday, April 27.

Dr. Andrews, Missionary, Lectures On Formosan Significance in Chapel Talk Dr. Egbert W. Andrews, educational missionary, lec- tured on The Significance of F-ormosa in chapel, Tuesday, ' April 24. Dr. Andrews was bom in China apd has spent 20 years in the Far East. He attended the University of Pennsylvania and enrolled in the Westminister Semin- ary upon his graduation. In summing up Formosa's im- portance to the world seem>, An- drews said it symbolized \failure in the past but opportunity in the future. It represents the failure of Christianity to adapt to the demands of ChinPse ctllture and of the West in its relations with the East.\ Early missionaries w~>re used· for practical purposes. The Chi- nese people manag-ed to maintain inviolate their own culture and traditions while adapting to west- ern ideas in the matters of indus- trial te·chniques and business practices. Educational mission- aries acceded to the separation of education from religion, resulting in the assimilation of th<> former and the rejection of Christian teachings. Andrews said that the failures stated his belief that large seg- ments of the Asian population who are still uncommitted in their allegiances could be brought together by a strong church. Communism. he concluded,: with its certainty of a,im and fanatical sureness of purpose, is forcing us to stop and clarify our ideals to achieve a new under- standing of basic Christian goals.
