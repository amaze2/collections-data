Pleased, indeed, we are to see you. For sotne few months we have awaited you and- at last you are here. Our only hope and prayer is that you may have a. good time. Should you desire ent .. ertainment at the Van Curler or the Art speak. forth. Should You desire chicken and cranberry sauce at Glenn's or toast and coffee at th.e Glass make known your wants. We are here to entertain you and we court your slightest whiln. Seldom it is that we have this opportunity. During the remainder of our year we study hard, yet very often do we think of you and your charm- ing qualities; and through a haze of Simoke wish that Junior Week were a monthly event. But so it is not destined. For the path of man is rough and far distant is his goal. So when we play we play with all our might, and woe to that which interrupts us. Our one regret is that we cannot entertain you in the class room. For here it is we show our worth. We could introduce you to sotne of our distinguished faculty and we ·feel confident you would find them interesting. But that pleasure is for us alone and it is our duty to submit to the inevitable. However, should this honor fall to you at any of our entertainments it is our wish that you assume a most roguish smile and that you sing our praises like an ancient Virgil. For who knows but through your efforts our grades may be increased or we may dodge a dreaded stick. Alas! The charm of wotnan can accomplish wonders. But we must not ti·r.e you. So once again we bid you welcome and trust that your time is not ill spent. 0 A HUMAN PARADOX Have you ever met one of those fellows who can't get along, and yet get along finely? He's a human paradox. He does not know what to wear, and yet he wears it with an air. He takes no thought for what he wears 1 and yet it fits him to perfection. He wears a dollar shirt, and it looks like the linen of a plutocrat. He does not know whether to wear pearl studs or gold ones, a black tie or a white one, a \tuxedo\ before six or not-yet he's always right. Intellectually he is quite ordinary, and yet -his conversation sends every- one into ro.ars ·of laughter. It isn't his fault-he's just adaptable. And as a paradox, he's a very lucky one. V. T., '13

Cronin Lead the Grand March The Junior Prom, the big. eveJtJ-.·of the V\oeek's festivities, o.~cu.r~.~d Last evening at the Ten Eyck I-Ictel, Albany. Fully four hundred dancers graced the floor of the spacious ballrootn and enjoyed the twenty-four dances and many encores that were played by Zita's orchestra. At 7:45 Friday evening ten special cars of the interurban type awaited the boarding of the parties fron1 the fraternity houses. Before 8 o'clock the last car had left the catnptts and was Tolling on its way to Albany. A clear track gave the specials an opportunity of making unusually fast time and shortly before nine the guests were alighting at the Ten Eyck on State street, Albany. The hotel was practically in the ·pos~ession of the dancers. Frmn the walls of ba.Hroom, n1ez- zanine, corridors, and drawing room.s .... .fl.o~t~d col- lege pennants with U ni8n and the Garnet hue in predominence. The ballroom itself was a elabor- ately decorated with flags, pennan~~~ bunting, etc. At 9:10 the orchestra brcke into the strains of the grand n1arch and the dancers formed: Jor the pre- dancing part of the program. John C. Cronin, vice-president of the junior class, with Miss Angela Goodson, of Glens Falls, led tbe tnarch. Supper was served shortly after 1nid.night and the dancing continued until 4 o'clock. The special cars whirled the guests across the seventeen miles of cL rveless traveling and pulled into Schenectady about 5 o'clock Tired though the girls were there

The effort is a comedy in four acts. The acting which the college men are putting into their work is equal to the play.

In the course of the evenitig he gave many conc~ete illustration of the p~esent imp~acticability of psych0logica1 methods in the court room; but prophesied a great future for exo pert psychologists who will in time by means of their methods replace the much criticised .:'third degree\ and the frequent wrangles over testimony carried on among lawyers. . The following evening the I~ecture was applied psy- chology in relation to education. With this as a topic Dr. Munsterberg brought out the many uses that psy- chological methods could be put to in education but emphasized that the teacher's intuition could never be fully ~eplaced by psychology.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 17 UNION COLlEGE UBftARY. THE TRAIL IN THE COLLEGE WOODS LOVERS' LANE

18 THE CONCORDIENSIS U;NfON COLLEGE Union College, unlike the other older colleges in America, came into existence in response to a popular demand, which was essen.tially a citize,ns' moven1ent and an expression of the growing 1la- tional feeling; for the first petition for a charter referred especially to the need tl1at existed and would exist in the future for 111en of learning to fill the various cffices of the State as well as the Church. The founders of the college sought to create an institution which, while both political and religious, should not comnTen1orate an individual nor be under th'e patronage of a single denomil1a- tbn, but which sl1ould be dedicated to the prin- Legislature of the State of New York for the main- tenance of the college and for its increased efficiency. The fi,rst president of U ni8n College was the Rev. Jo:hn Blair S1nith, a graduate of Princett:n. He was succeeded on his resig.l1lation in 1799 hy the Rev. Jonathan Edwards, the younger, who died in office in 18or. The next president was the Rev. Jonatl:an 1\Iaxcy, a graduate of Brown and a B~p­ tist, who resigned because of ill health in r8o 4 , when the Rev. Eliphalet Nott, also an alumnus of Brown, but a Presbyterian:, was elected to the presidency. The determining event in the early history of the college was the accession to the presidency of A CORNER OF THE CAMPUS ciples of political and religious liberty. In I 779, while the Revolutionary War was still in progress, 850 citizens of Albany, Tryon and Charlotte coun- ties petitioned the Governor and Legislature of the State of New York to grant them a charter for a college, but the unsettled condition of the times prevented the granting of this first petition. How- eyer, the petitioners persisted in their efforts and in 1785 organized an acaden1y which beca1ne the practical foundation of the college. In 1795, after repeated appeals, the Regents of the University of the State of New York granted a college charter which confirn1ed the purposes of the founders by providing that no one religious deno.1nination should at any time have a n1aj ority in the board of trustees; hence the na1ne \Union.\ This free- dom from church control made it possible for the State to give the college financial support, and fo1· n18.:1y ye8rs appropriati-:-ns were n1ade by the D ~Jet or N ott. With his election the college beg~n a new and aggressive life and the spirit of liberty i.1 which it had been founded bore fruit abundantly. Doctor :.J ott was a man of commanding pre'Sence and inspiring personality, fertile in ideas, progre.:~ sive in spirit and tireless in energy. His rare abi 1 i- ties fitted him for leadership in large affairs. L nder his vigorous adn1in~stration the college grew in ntunbers and ia reputation until it becan1e on~ of the most prominent institutions in the country. In 18r2 the present site of the college, on a hill overlooking Schenectady, was secured, and in r8Ij a comprel-:ensive plan for grounds and buildings was adopted. This plan was the work of Jacques Ran1ce, a French landscape architect, who had been employed by the govenunent in the development of the city of Washington. It was natural that 1\f onsieur Ramee's designs should savor of Old World ideas, and this accounts for the fact, so

B~p­ r8o-t, of the ry of cy of i.1 gre.::; abi 1 i- . 111 1~ of hill r8rj been ment that Old so THE CONC'ORDIENS~S 19 often noted, that the architectural f·eatures and the grouping of the buildings of Union CoUege are essentially foreiga. Doctor Nott holds a place of peculiar honor among the great eoUege presidents of his titn·e. He may justly be called the pioneer of modern educa- tional progress in America. He was the first to break away from Old World traditions and intro- duce new courses of study. As early as r8og he instituted a course in modern languages.. In r828 he established a scientific course, and in 1845 he added a course in civil engineering, anticipating the den1and for technifal training which ahnost every other institution of higher education in America had becQnre the m·ost distinctively national of aH our eclu cational institutions, drawing its students hom .e-very part of the country, especially from the South. Because of this it suffered greatly during the Civn War, the seuthern students withdrawing on the Gttthreak O:f hostilities, and the northern stude lilts. enl~isting in large numbers for the support of tke !F'e~leral cause. Doctor Nott died in r866 at the age .of 93, having been 1]>resid.ent for 62 years, the longest administra- tion in t:ltte history o:f Am.erican colleges. He was succeediea by the Rev. Laurens P. Hickok, who had serve cl .as Vice-President during the latter part of Doct0r Nott's [ii.£e. ln r868 Dr. Hickok. re- ~~ Rll THE p.J<ESID\ENT'S HOUSE has srnce recognized. In still other ways Union College early gained distinction. It gave larger liberty of student life, and for necessary discipline depended more upon moral suasioa than up3n the enforcement of arbitrary penalties. This spirit of tolerance in the governn1ent of stude .nts n1ade pos- sible the establishment of the college fraternity sys- tem. The oldest .of the Greek letter societies, Kappa Alpha, .Sig_ma Phi and Delta Phi, were founded at Union in r825, r827, and 1828 respec- tively. These were followed by Psi Upsilon in r833, Chi Psi in 184r, and Theta Delta Chi in 1847. In the college world Union is therefore designated as \ the mother of the Greek letter societies.\ These departures fron1 tradition, radical in their cl.ay, all tended toward acaden1ic and personal free- don1. They laid emphasis on practical training and they engendered a detnocratic and self-reliant spirit. It is not surprising, therefore, that the graduates of Union achieved n1arked distinction in politicai life and as men of affairs. Before r86o the coHege signed, and in r86g the Rev. Charles A. Aiken was elected to succeed him. Dr. Aiken held office for two years, and was followed by the Rev. Eliphalet Nott Potter, a grandson of Doctor N ott. Under Dr. Potter the college was greatly strengthened and regained much of its former prestige. During his acl1n,i11istration ·Union University was organizrd hy leg-islative acts in 1873, and included the a cad en. ic: and en gin cering departments at Schenec· tady, and the law school, the medical college and Dudley obs-ervatory in Albany. To these several departments was afterward added a school of phar- n1acy,. founded in Albany in r88r. Dr. Potter re· signed in. r884, when for four years the college wa!-J witho ttt an official head, the Hon. J uclson S. Lan- don acti11g as president ad interim. In 1888 Dr Harrison E. We1Jster becatne president, hut be· caus~e of ill health resigned in rR04. and was suc- ceede{t by the Rev. Andrew V. V. Ray.moncl, who continued in office fo1• twelve years, during which substantial gains w~re made. He resigned in July,

In 1895 an electrical course was addecl to the other courses in the engineering school; and in r 902 this course was thoroughly organized under tb·e direction and supervision of Charles Proteus Steinme.tz, the distinguished special electrician of the General El~ectric Con1pany. Through an ar- rangement with this company, whose plan in Sche- nectady is the largest and t:no.st co1nprehensive electrical rnanufa.cturi'ng plant in the world, the college has s·uch special aclvantag:-,es for st.l\tdents in electrical science ns cannot be offered else .. vheTc The general engineering department, offering C:)Urses in civil and sanitary engineering, has a long established reputation and has contribute cl tnuch to the industrial development of the country. Thus the college is able to n1eet satisfactorily the in- creasing cl.e1nand for technical training, while at the smne time it doe£ not depart fron1 its older academic traditions. Two classical courses, a La tin-scientific course and a scientific co1.1rse, are ma1ntainecl, a 11 of which are intended to in1part a liberal culture rather than to prepare directly for any special JJrofession or occupation.

On Friday Bight the Garnet met Syra- cuse ar.d iost by the score of 41 to !16. The Orange had little difficulty in scoring at will during the first half and ran up a high score. In this half Union was unable to find the basket and made a poor showing. In the second half the Garnet showed great improve- r:-:ent both in shoctiPZ ::nd in guatGing but the lead of Syracuse gained in the first half was far too much to overcome. The following evening U nicn n1et Cclgate and lost by the score of 37 to 15. The horne team outweighed Union by more than thirty pounds to a man; but even with this disadvantage and the handicap of a small court Union managed to keep the Colgate's score in the first half down to Colgate 13 while the Garnet tal- lied 11. It was in the second half that Colgate made a break-away and ran up a big score while Union lost the ability to shoot entirEly. The game was unusually rough and in one of the n1ix-ups J.

Dear Sir: I have the pleasure to inform yott that an act is passed by which a free and voluntary gift on the part of the people of this State has been 1nade to tl:e trustees of the college i11 your town of £ I,soo. Apprehensive that the Assem.bly would not accede if a separate bill was brougb-t in for the pur- pose, privatelY prepared tny friends in both houses -=: and tacked a clause to the supply bill. It passt d tlle Senate abncst uN.anhnously, and the Assemh1y with a great n1ajurity; and I have hopes that .tt a future S!.:ssi:;n, irf we shall have tnetnbers eapal>le uf appreciating the advantages which w.iH result frcm the coHege. in Schenectady and of properly stating them to the Legislature, a han.dson1e dona- ti8n of unap_propria ted lands 1nay be obtained ft,r the better support of the institution; especially i ahle professors al!e appointed. If 1\-Ir. Dwig<It could be obtained .to preside in the college as president, I an1. fu'tly persuaded the institution would flourish and that it would be a means of pro- curing further aid from the Legislatur-e. 1 most earnestly, therefor.e, wish to call the attention of the trustees to this i!11.portant object, and entreat that the college may be organized without delay. You are at liher1:y to show this letter to such as rnay have an influence in forwarding :my v1ews on this subject. I m~n, dear sir, Yo~~.-T obedient servant, Ph.

POTTER, '12 UNION WINS ANNUAL DEBATE WITH CORNELL Debating T earn of Seniors Out Argue Ithaca Men on the Negative. of the Sherman Anti-Trust Law. On Friday, February 16, in the ccllege chapel, the Union Ccllege Debating Team defeated Cornell Uni- versity in the second annual cebate. The question was: \Resolved That the Sherman Anti-Trust Law be repealed, and a law passed whereby corporations doing an interstate business be regulated instead of destroyed.\ This last clause did not imply that the Sherman Anti-Trust Law would necessarily destroy corporations doing an interstate business. The speak- ers were: Affirmative, Cornt 11 University -1. Reming- ton Rogers, Law Schocl. 2. H. G. Wilson, Law School. 3. H. B. Knapp, Agricultural School. Alter- nate, J. A. Sourwine. Negative, Union-1. Roy W. Peters, '12. 2. Kenneth E. vVal3er, '13. 3. James H. Potter, '12. Alternate, Hubert Mann, '13. The judges o( award were: Judge James F. Tracey, Albany, N. Y.1 Mr. J. E. Sague, Albany, N. Y., Fred Winslow Adams, D. D., Schenectady, N. Y. The first speaker for the affirmative claimed that the law destroyed the advantages of centralization without removing the disadvantages, especially the power to fix pri:::es; that the law was vague, and that offenders again -:-t it had not been punished. The first speaker for the negative defined the ques- tion. He agreed that the law should be supplemented. He told of the conditions which led to the passage of the law and pointed out that it must be interpreted 4 'reasonably.\ He stated the points which, he asserted, th.e affirmative must prove and outlined the argument <lf the negative. The second speaker for the affirmative said that no change had been made reading \unreasonable\ into the law. He gave examples showing that the law had not accomplished its ends because it does not go to the root of the evil, and stat=d that the affirmative plan of a corporation commission wculd be more effective. The second speaker for the negative endeavored to prove that the law was just and right. That it had been interpreted to meet modern conditions and that only harmful trusts were punished. He brought for- ward instances in which the taw had been successfuL The third speaker for the affirmative proposed a substitute for the Sherman law consisting of a cor· poration commission and a law providing either for voluntary federal incorporation or compulsory federal license. The comtnission was to have the duty of overlooking the business of corporations doing inter- state business and of punishing violations of the law. The third speaker for the negative attempted to show that the law should be retained as a basis for future legislation. He endeavored to prove that the plan of the affirmative would throw too great a bur .. den on the government and that the law was stated not in vague but general terms. He adduced examples to show that the l:tw had been effective and summed up the argument of the negative. In rebuttal both sides gave speeches remarkable for finish and clear rea3oning. A striking point was made by the negative when they brought forward Pres. Schurman of Cornell as an authority. The affirmative repeated their argument that the law must be inter- preted literally while the negative insisted that the \reasonable\ interpretation expressed the true spirit of the law. !I' ..

1'HE CONCORDIENSIS MISSIONARY CEN,TENNIAL OBSERVE,O Tablet Unveiled to Samuel Nott, Jr.-Three Inspiring Addresses Heard in CoHege Chapel Yesterday Afternoon-The Committee in Charge. A celebration of unusual interest was held In the college chapEl yesterday afternoon at four o'dJcl<, when exercises were held commemorating the one hundredth anniversary of the sailing of the first American missionaries to foreign lands. One .o.f the£e five missionaries was SamuEl Nott, Jr., Union, 1S08, a nephew of rr, ETiphalet Nott, Union's most famous president. It was especially appropriate, therefore, that this anniversary should be held at Nott's f. lma Mater. The tablet was made by Wirlian'ls and Com- pany of New York and has been. placed at the right (:Jf the chapel pulpit The exercises were attended by a large audiEnCe\';. and much enthusiasm was in· evidence. President Richmond presided and had charge of the unveiling <Jf f.1e memorial tablet. The inscription on the tablet ts c:s follows: 1812 1912 TO COMMEMORATE THE SAILING.

' nton s EUT LOSES TO WESLEY AN Basketball team, with Captain Fairbairn once more in the game, was defeated by the Giants fron1 Wesleyan en Saturday evening, February lOth. The We~leyan te2m were coached to . take every ad- vantage of their height, and in spite of the fact that they were outpassed and generally ov tplayed by the Garn::t team, had absolutely no difficulty in winning by a decisive score. On Saturday, February 17th, the team again demon- strated the fact that it is a \road team\ by defeating the fast Rochester team on their home floor by a score of 17 to 12. According to the Rochester papers the game was by long odds the best on Rochester's schedule. The Garnet team had possession of the ball fully three-fourths of the pla ing time and their pasEing was so fast as to completely bewilder the yel- low and black five. D. Beaver was the special star in the scoring line, although J. Beaver and Houghtcn were each credited with a ren'larkable shot from near the center of the court. 0 OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS Students desirous of a profitable and agreeable line of work after hours (): during the coming summer vacation would do well to call at 9 Waverly Place, Saturdays from 10 to 12 and 6:30 to 7:30 o'clock.

The disappearance of a book from the reserve shelf of the library brought consternation to a large share of the senior class last week when it was found that this volume was practically the only s3urce of preparing for an examination that was held last Thursday. The majority of thos.e who were to take the examination had doubtless read the text some time before, but a final refreshing of the memory on important points was naturally felt necessary. The act of removing the book from the library was one that could scarcely be said to be characteristic of Union men. Whether it was the idea of the student to have the ex::tmination postponed by such means or whether he wished to have a better opportunity of preparing for the ex- amina,tion, the taking of the book was directly in violation of the library rules and contrary to usual course of action on the part of students at Union .. Unlike many other college libraries the book shelves are open to students at

The library decided to establish open. shelves when the library was moved from its quarters in Washburn Hall ito the present building some years ago. But little trouble has been found by the wrong use of this method and it is boped that nothing further will happen to cause the committee to consider returning to the old method of closed shelves. ~uiou-(!.Inrnt11 ~ebat£ az 1§liefuc!t bt! 1£Iocat Jlrt5fi The following editorial was contained in the Schenectady Gazette for February 20. For the second time Union College has triumphed over Cor- nell in debating. The victory of the speakers r€presenting the local college over their opponents from Ithaca, Friday night, repeated the similar triumph scored last year. The victory was a clear one. The decision was given Union unanimously by the judges. There is also another fact in re- gard to it that should not be overlooked,--that Cornell had the entire university to choose its team from, while that of Union was taken from the college only. When it is remembered that the students in the former outnumber those in Union by the ratio of about seventeen to one, the greater o-pportunity to se- cure skilled men that Cornell enjoyed is obvious. The contest emphasized the value of debating. It is a mat- ter that should have greater prominence in coBege affairs than it does. Logically, it is far more in keeping with what should constitute college work than athletics. Pronciency in it is worth more than skill in the latter so far as the average student is concerned, remembering that as things are at the present time comparatively few take part either in intercollegiate ath- letic contests or compete for positions on athletic teams. It is to be hoped that it will continue to occupy a. leading place in the affairs of Union. The institution will thereby be able to send out speakers·who will not only be better equipped for their personal advancement, but who will reflect credit on their college.

Hough .to Pr01fessor Stoller, tells of an adcli tion to the library in the way of copies -of governrnent reports upon forestry. The reports., three in number, were is- sued by the govcrnn1ent under the supervision of the late Dr. Franklin B. Hougb, an alun1nus of Union and father of the writer of the letter. These are the first :governn1ental forestry rep::;rts iss~.1ed. Romeyn B. H·ough is an author and pttblisher.

Hough, who by the bye was an alumnus of Union College. It may interest you to know, if you do not already, that the forestry movement in this country had its incipiency in an address deliv- ered by my father at the Portland (I\fe.) n1eet- ing of the A1nerican Association for the Ad- vancement of Science in August, 1873. The title of the address was \The Duty .of Governn1ents in the Preservation of Forests.'' Following the reading of the paper committees were appointed to tnetnorialize Congress, etc., as detailed in the published Proceedings of the A. A. A. S., and finally the Division of For- estry of the Departlne nt of Agric1.1ltnre re- sulted and n1y father was appointed its first . . COllll111SSlOner. As being of probable interest to yctt en this connection I a1n sending yon w·ith the above also the following by n1y father, excepting one: Reprint of the Proceedings of the A. :\. A. S.

14 THE CONCORDIENSIS ANOTHER Ut~ION POET Union tnay be proucl to claim another song writer of note besides John I-Ioward Payne. l-\Ie is Rev. Ed.n1und Hatnilton Scars, who was born in Berk- shire county, 1\lass., in I8Io, ancl 'vho served as minister in the Unitarian churches of Wayland, Lancaster and vV eston, 1\1ass. f-Ie aided Rev. Rufus Ellis in publishing the \ 1'Ionthly Religious :\lagazine.\ I-Ie was graduated from Union and in 1849 1.vrote the Christn1as carol, \It Can1e Upon the :Aiidnight Clear.\ The hy1nn was published, as follov-,;s, in I850 and frmn that tin1e has always been a favored Christn1as carol. Mr. Sears died in 1876. The carol follows: 1 t can1e upon the tnidnight clear, That gloricus song .of old, [-<rom Angels bending near the earth, To tonch their harps of gold; ·· Peace on the earth, good-will to men, Fron1 heaven's all-gracious King.'' The world in solen1n stillness lay To hear the angels sing. ~till thrungh the cloven skies they cotne, vVith peaceful wing unfurled; :\ nd still thtir heavenly .n1usic floats O'er all the weary world: Above its sad and lowly plains They bend on hovering wing, And ever o'er its Babel sounds The blessed angels sing. But with the woes of sin and strife The world has suffered long; Beneath the angel-strain have rol:led Two thousand years of wrong; .1\nd man, at war with n1an, hears not The love song which they bring: Oh, hush the noise, ye n1en of strife, And hear the angels sing! And ye, beneath life's crushing Load Whose fon11s are bending low, Who toil ctlong the clin1bing way, With painful steps and slow, - Look now; for glad and golden hours Con1e swiftly on the wing: Oh, rest beside the weary road, And hear the angels sing! For lo 1 the days are hastening on By prophet bards foretold, When with the ever-circling years Con1es round the age of gold: When Peace shall over all the earth Its ancient splendors fling, And the whole world give back the song Which now the angels sing, BAND CON·CERTS SOON The college band, which was organized during last tern1, is holding frequent rehearsals, and i 11 the last few weeks has n1ade c-onsiderable progres:s.

Youth Charged with Stealing Cups From Trophy Room Gets Off with \Promise to Pay\-Another lm· plica ted Thaddeus jeffers, the youth who was arrested in Poughkeepsie while endeavoring to dispose of pieces of silver thought to have been parts of one of the silver cups stolen from the trophy room in Silliman Hall during the Christmas holidays, plead guilty to the charge of stealing the trophies and was granted suspended sentence by Judge Naylon in court last Saturday. It is understood that evidence was intro- duced to show that Jeffers was merely an accomplice in the theft and that there is another who is directly responsible for the deed. The man who is now charged with stealing the cups has not yet been ap- prehended. It is said that the college authorities connected with the case agreed with Jeffers' counsel in recommending suspended sentence to the court. It is also under· stood that Jeffers was let off on condition that he paY a part of the cost of the stolen cups.

FEBRUARY 28, 1912 No. 15 GARNET FIVE VICTORS OVER PRATT QUINTET Union Wins Again in Fast Game Through Good Passwork and Long Shots In a fast but rather rough game Union easily won from Pratt last Saturday evening at the Armory. The game was frequently delayed by fouls which raised the score somewhat. Pratt started with great speed and succeeded in rolling up a few points before the Garnet team had really got started. The first period ended with a score of 6-4 in favor of the visitors. Union took a brace at this poil!t and outplayed the Brooklyn men through- out the rest of the game. The end of the first half found the score 11-7 in favor of the Garnet. Union came back even stronger in the second half and succeeded in caging the ball several times during the first period. Pratt gained seven points which now l~ft the score 21-14. The visitors tried to start the last period in a whirl- wind manner just as they had begun the game. Their efforts were in vain, only netting them four points while the Garnet quintet managed to add six more points to their score thus making a total of 27-18.

COLSON Four Strong Talks on \The Essential Things in a CoUege Man's Rdig,icn\ MARCH lQ.-13. That is the time w1Ien Ralph B. Col- son, the Student Y. M. C. A. Secretary of New York State, is to be at Union and give a series of four talks at Silliman Hall on t~e general theme \The Essential Things in a College Man's Religion\. Ralph Colson is a man who is well known to Union students. As captain of the Ham,Hton Track Team and of the Hamilton Intercollegiate Debating Team, he has come to be known and admired by many m~n at Union. At Hamilton he was recognized as one of the strongest men that Hamilton has ever had, in ath letics, debating, and all the interests of college life. Few men have had the privilege of being as popular or of having as strong an influence upon the student life, as Colson had during his four years at Hamilton. Before his graduation at Hamilton last year the im- portant position of State Student Y. M. C. A. Secre- tary was offered him. In this capacity he has come into close touch with all the college and university centres of the State. Ralph Colson is a young college man of strong per- sonality and of deep convictions. Furthermore, be is a direct, forceful speaker. His straighforward, sincere talks are the kind that cannot fail to appeal to college students. And, what is of even greater importance, his talk is backed up by his life, for he is the type of man who honestly and enthusiastically puts into prac- tice the things that he talks about. ., Don't forget the date, March lOth to 13th! It is hoped that every Union student will avail himself of this real opportunity of hearing these strong talks on ''The Essential Things in a College Man's Religion.\ Dr. Richmond has secured the Hon. Elihu Root, United States Senator from New York, to act as honor- ary chancellor at the commencement next June. ! !

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS THE JUNIOR'S REMlN:ISCEN·CES The Jl!lnior sat alone in his room. It was four o'clock a.m. on the night, or morning rather, of the Prom. 1'he house was quiet except f.or the occasional puff on his pipe. . His last doHar was spent and his nind was on the girls. Unsteady were his thoughts, but throNgh the haze of smoke he dreamed. Many were the girls he saw. His own girl was fore- most in his mind. For ten years he had gone with Jean. [n fact, they had grown up together and many times he had resolved to marry her, that is, when he became a man and was earning money. But there was a grave question before his mind. The many girls he had met, and dan@ed with and flirted with were the cause of it. Was Jean the type of girl he wanted? That Chambers girl was considered the belle of the ball. Her eyes had a funny way of acting and her voice was soft and gentle. Without doubt she was most charming, but he afterwards had l:~arned, that in preparing for the dance, something had gene wrong and she had given vent to her anger by tossing her pump through the mirror. Alas! N J man could live with such a girl. What w0uld happen if he came home late or forgot to put the cat out? · The }1:1nior dreamed on. His thoughts rested upon Miss Cross. She had a beautiful complexion and ac- cording to rumor a large income in her own· name. He passed judgment on her and had about decided that she was· deserving of futher attention, when his thoughts turned to her feet. They were so large and conspicuous. The dreamer had a particular dislike for big feet and at length he decided that the feet he could never stand. Then that little girl with the pearl like · teeth and ·blue eyes demanded his attenticn. She was a most graceful danser and was the cause of many flattering remarks. The Junior had in so·me way heard that her father owned a pickle factory and had no sons. Here, perhaps, was an opening, but suddenly he ren1embered seeing a rat in her hair. This was tJo much.· The days of rats were past and anyway, a girl who was careless with her rats woul ::1 be careless in other ways. The dreamer was of a very exacting type and he ex- pected. the same of others. Several other girls were brought before his mind and dismissed and finally his own little girl returned. The Junior had known her for many years. He knew that, as playmates when they were young, she could throw him but he also well remembered how sports- manlike she was. He recalled that once he had pulled her eat's tail and she immediately flattened his nose. He challenged her to a battle but she said she knew he could J.ick her and refused. She said it was cruel to pull a eat's tail and he sai<ft that he was sorry. She immediately smacked hi:rn on the cheek and said she would go home and stea~ some ·cookies. Such littL· reminiscences kept coming in his mind and at length he decided there was no girl like little Jean. His pipe had gone out ani tble matches were down- stairs, so he decided it was time to retire and on the ' . morr0w write a note to his own little gir 1.

Publication Office The N'ew-Hes-Mor Pri:nting Co., Schenectady Railway Waiting Room Building, 420 State Street m~~e Jtfr.esqmetn ~ult9 While the writer was coming up town recently he met two freshmen. H€ was wearing a class toque and it should not have required the genius of a Sh€rlock Holmes to deduce that he was in college. Neither of the fresh~ men said anything at first, but on being spoken to one gave a grudging \hello\ while the other ·walked on in stony silence. The idea that a fresh- man is required t() say ,.'.hello\ when he meets a fellow student, and to say it . . first; never seemed to occur tp them. ·~~ - The above incident is only an instance of th€ general laxity in regard ·to tbe freshman rules. Especially noticeable is the carelessness about wear- ing freshman caps. By order of the Terrace Council and of the student body the freshmen are supposed to wear only fr€shman caps or toques ex_ _ cept on Sunday, yet it is a common sight to see a freshman wearing plairi · · caps or derbies about town and ev~n ()fl the campu.~. There is no reason

THE CONCORDlENSIS 11 =-=---=--=··=-==~============~======================================~===== for this. The rule has been obeyed by every class for a number of years and the present freshmen have no cause to imagine themselves above it. The rule ooncerning the smoking of cigars and pipes has also been fre- quently violated. The rule which has been most flagrantly violated is the one which states that the freshmen shall remain seated in ehapel until the seniors, juniors and sophomores have left the building. This rule is habitually broken, not by a few individuals, but by the entire class. Matters have now reached such a state that instead of waiting till the last sophomore has passed out, the freshmen begin to get up when the first junior reaches the door, and are coming down from the gallery before the sophomores have started to go out. The thing, however, which shows the :greatest lack of college spirit is the fact that some of the freshmen do not appear to know the college songs. In college meeting, when Alma Mater is sung, there are several men who do not so much as open their mouths, and there are more who do not know the other songs. This is inexcusable for men who have been in college nearly six months, and unless they learn th.e songs speedily, the other classes may find a way of teaching them. D. '13 • H~ ijlfre J!i~tqola_g~ Ifi~rtures Union College students are at present having the advantage of hearing a course of lectures that is unsurpassed. Dr. Hugo Munsterberg, this year's lecturer under the Ichabod Spencer Professorship in Philosophy, has begun his series of lectures on \Applied Psychology.\ Professor M unsterberg, professor of psychology in Harvard University, is regarded as the leading authority on his subj~ct in the United States; and Union College is fortunate in obtaining him to maintain the high standard set by Dr. Angell, last year's lecturer. It is the policy of the college to provide its students with the ad- vantages of lectures by men of pre-eminent scholarship in their various de- partments; it should be the duty of every student to take advantage of them. A college course should be a builder of culture and appreciation of the higher things of life. Psychology is one of the most, if not the most, broad and culture-giving sciences. But besider this it is perhaps the most really interesting and fascinating subject; the science of the human mind is ab- sorbing in the insight it gives into human nature, and the mind's processes and pov,;ers. This is too largely an age of materialism, but the most im- portant matters that concern us are not, and should not be, material, but intellectual and moral. At any rate, our education cannot be 1iberal, our culture cannot be real, without some knowledge of that side of learning that psychology represents. So with such a duty to ourselves and with such an opportunity, Dr. Muns- terberg's lectures should be attended by the whole student body of Union. Two lectures of this series remain; let every one attend them. To regard it in a selfish way, we owe it to ourselves. T. '13

Mr. Echv:ani:s was for nearly forty years engaged in legal and j~l!tdidal activities, having been for a number of years one of the Supreme Cqurt Justices of the thioc-d judicial dis· trict of New York Stat:=. He was born in. Glenville ,, Schenectady County, April 24, 1839, and was prepared for college in boarding schools of Schoharie anJ Wash- ington Counties. He was admitted to the bar in 1864 and after practicing law al0ne .. for a short time became a partner in the firm of Andrews and Edwards vVhen on the bench Judge Edwards was regarded as a .man of impartial mind and sound judgmEnt. In pclitics he was a democrat but when nominatep :for the office of Justice of. the· Supreme Court he received the unani- mous support of the bar of Columbia County without regard to party affiliations. While at Union he was honored for attainments in schclarship and was very- popular a1nong his fellow . . students. Judge Edwards was a member of the Delta Phi fraternity~ 1875---'Samuel A.

f t 1 v a h ~s e, ir lt R. L. )S- d- ~e. ~r,. rr,. M. t&. ~xt THE CONCORDIENSIS 13 DR. MUNSTERBERG, GIVES ·LECTURES On Monday :aNd Tuesday, February 19 and 20, Dr. Mtlnsterberg gave the fifth' and sixth lectures of the series which he is delivering under the Ichabod Spen- cer lecture fund. The cJhapel was crowded to the doors by a large audience of students and towns- people. The lecture on Monday was on t·he relation between psychology and education. :Ur. Munsterqerg spoke of a series of experiments he was making which tended to show that memory reached its maximum not im- tnediately a'fter studying a lesson b11 t after an interval of time had elapsed. He describ~d the methods which a teacher follows in order to secure efficient results and showed that the old way of teaching a child to read, by beginning with th.e alphabet was unscientific. The eye, he stated, does not read letter by letter, but takes in an entire word or phrase at a time. The lecture on Tu'es:lay was partly abcut the re· Iaticn of psychology to education and partly about its relation to con1merce and in.dustry. Dr. Munsterberg described experiments for the measurements of fatigue and advised the formation of special classes for children with n1ental defects. In speaking of in- INTERCLASS BASKETBALL The interclass basketball games for the J0seph Trophy have begun. So far two games have been played. On February 14th, the Juniors and Sopho· mores opened the sedes, the ~913 team winning by the score of 27 to 21. A week '~ater the Freshmen, without the help of the 1915 'Varsity men, fell before the attack of the 1914 quintet in a close game,; the score standing 9 to 8, Each dass will play each of the other classes two games, and the winners of the series will hold the Joseph trophy for a year. T.-OY MEET At the annual indoor meet held in the Troy Armory last Thursday evening, Union secured two first places, La Barron won the six hundred yard run, coming in . ' forty yards ahead of his nearest . opponent. Baker in the high jump with a handicap of six inches, jumped . . six feet three inches, winning first place. The result of the work of all the men representing Union shows that the prospects are good for a winning team this dustry he told of the necessity of adjusting a machine spring. to work at the speed at which the set of muscles which controlled it were most efficient and of having a machin~ controlled by small muscles instead of large. He also spoke of the importance of investi- gations in regard to the iniiluence of light, air, ·positions of the body, social conditions, and mental states, up- on factory workers. HAMIL TON AND COLGATE DEBATES The subjects for both debates is: \Resolved that the Sherman Anti-Trust Law be repealed.\ The team which will receive Hamilton on Thursday, Fe~ruary 29, 1912, will have the negative and will be Roy Peters, H. Mann, and Kenneth W alset, with A. B. Mann as alternate. At Colgat.:: the team will have the affinnative and will consist of Donald Coulter, A. D. Mann and James P.:>tter with R. P.

14 THE CONCORDIENSIS THE 1912 FOOTBALL RULES After working in secret f,or two days upon the football rules for 1912 the Rules Committee an- nounced sometime ago the changes to be made in last year's rules. The rules as changed follow: I -The playing field, now I 10 yards in length, will be shortened to an even 100 yards. This change in itself is 11ot vital but it is made in order to make possible on sm~ll grounds an extension of territory in which the forward pass may be used. 2- An area of ten yards width beyond the g.oal lines is set apart and in this the attacking team will be allowed to use the forward pass. 3- The number of \downs \ to gain ten yards is increased by one. 4- The on side kick is entirely eliminated. 5 -The value of a touchdown is increased fr.om five points to six points, the goal from touchdown and other scores standing as at present. 6- The twenty-yard zone in which the present rules now provide restrictions to interference with the forward pass is eliminated so that the restric- tions will apply now to any ·part of the field. 7- In case of a touchback the ball will be put in play from the twenty-yard line ins.tead of the twenty-five-yard line. 8- On a kick off the ball, instead of being put in play in the center of the field, will be put in play fr.om the forty-yard line of the team kickina <::::> off. Taking into consideration the shortening of the field and this change in the rules the kick-off distance is lengthened by five yards. 9- The field judge is elin1inated. The head linesman will hereafter keep time and be judge of offside plays in the scrimmage. 10- The number of men allowed on the side lines, now three, will be reduced to one for each team. r 1 -A provision wiH be n1ade to the effect that a bounding ball cannot score a legitimate goal. I 2- The resting interval between the first and second and the third and fourth periods is reduced from two minutes to one n1inute. E. K. Hall, of Dartmouth, chairman of the com- mittee, announced the substance of these changes to newspaper men. None of them have been put in code form, but Chairman Hall said that they were all unanim.ously adopted and would be incor- porated in the 1912 rules. A committee was named to codify the new rules and was instructed to have them ready as soon as possible in order that they n1ight be circulated and. studied before the practice season begins. The committee named included Walter Camp of Y al~, Percy I-Iaught.on of Har- vard and William Mords .of Pennsylvania:. It was said that the changes adopted were the work of one individual, but a'fte r two days' discu s:sion they were drawn up as a whcle and passed uHanimously. The prindpal ilnprov~ement which the new rules are designed to ·effect is equalization of 1the changes of the offensive and defensive teams. ffit nas lona been contended that the defense in foDtball wa~ too pow.erful, especia:lly when close to its goal line. The extra ten yards territory in which the forward pass will now he a11owed the attac·kitl.g tea1n is expected to greatly rdieve this condition. The addition of a point to the value of a touchdown is intended to make th!e oon1parative val~tes of the touchdown and the goal from the field .substan- stan tially what they were before the ·recent high develop1ment of the ll:atter ·play. In considering the addition of an extra down, the ques:ti.on aro·se as to whether it would not brincr ~ back the old poundi:ng attack, but the committee felt that it was not !likely to have that tendency in view of the fact that there was now no pushing and pulling in the game. One of .the minor changes in the rules will be a. .provision tha.t the loser of the toss at the comtnencement of the game will have his choice at tne start of the second half as to whether his team shall kick off or receive. Here- tofore there has been no stipulation to this effect. The comn1ittee adjonrned with its n1embers ex- pressing satisfaction with the result of their labors and telieving that i:t would not be necessary to n1eet again unless th~ .codifying con11nittee encoun- tered some snarl w 11ich it could not handle, and even in such event it was thought that the ,matter could be adjusted with the men1bers of the general cornmi~tee by mail. 1\:lembers of the con1n1ittee in discttss ing the new rules furtl:er elucidated the extensi 011 of the for- ward pass territory ten yards beyond the goal line. At the present time th.e ball is dead wl:1en it crosses the goal line on a forward pass. Under the new rule it will be allowed to cross the gDal line and become a touchdovv.n if the baH is recovered by the offensive tea.m and touched to the ground. In the case of intercepted forward passes within the ten-yard zone a tottchback would be scored by the defensive team. The general effect of the changes, said one of the con1n1ittee1nen, w.iU lb e a tendency '' to play the ball instead of the player.\
