The Student Newspaper-of Union College Since 1877 Volume CXXV, Number I Reamer Campus Center is Dedicated courtesy of Public Relations Before the weekend wasover .. taken by the bustle ofCommence- ment, a quiet and moving cer- emony marked the dedication of the Murray and Ruth Reamer Campus Center. OnJune9, 1995 several dozen friends of Norton H. Reamer '58 gathered in front of the building that has become known as the crossroads of the campus. spond. I resolved to build him a monument, and this campus cen- ter is it.\ Constructed in 1910, the Reamer Campus Center began as the horne for the College's Engi- neering Departments. Subse- quent users included the Math- ematics Department and the Graduate Studies program. The building was renovated and ex- panded into a college center in the late 1980s. As President Roger Hull noted, the dedication, at Reamer's insistence, came only after Reamer had completed his gift to the College. Schenectady, New York September 14, 1995 After thanking his wife, Sue, whose help, encouragement, and patience made the gift possible, Reamer talked about his love for his parents, Murray and Ruth Reamer. \One of the things that stands out about Norton is that he never misses a meeting at Union despite a travel schedule of more than 200,000 miles a year,\ the presi- dent said. \He once said that at Union he can do something for a worthwhile institution that is smail enough so that you have a chance to make a difference. Clearly, Norton Reamer has made a difference.\ New engraving marks the newly dedicated Reamer Campus Center (photo by Rick Lederer) \My mother has been a rock and a support and an inspiration for·me. She is alive and well in Florida and is an absolutely won- derful woman. \My father suffered a perma- nently-disabling stroke when-he was fifty two and 1 was twelve,\ Reamer continued. \He never left the hospital and died twelve years later. I used to visit him on Sun- days and rem em bet talking to someone who could never r:e- Several Speakers commented on the fact that the building has established itself as the center of .the campus. Christina Sorum, dean of arts and sciences and professor of classics, said, \It's much nicer to have a building already in use. I don't have to say this building will change the interaction be• tween faculty and students-it al- ready has.\ To Fred Alford, dean of stu- dents, the Reamer Campus Cen- ter is \where we find out whafs really happening. It is the one place on campus we all come, and repeated! y.\ To Diana Sedita, editor and chief of The Concordiensis, the building gave her \a feeling of community\ when she visited Union as a potential student. \I just didn't know I'd be here sev- enty hours a week, fifty of them in The Concordy office.\ To Nate Coffin '95, former president of the Student Forum, A New and Improved Union One of the new emergency lights that will make Union students safer.

This past summer, armies of contractors joined forces with the Campus Opera- tions staff, Office of Computer Services staff, and many others to make dozens of changes. David Grzbowski, Director of Campus Operations, issued a partial list of the recent projects. Renovation has been done in South College, Baily HaH's third floor, Wells House's third floor, Lamont House, 27 Terrace Lane, Upperclass Dining, Ratheskellar Dining Facility, and West College Dining. The steam lines just north of Schaffer Library and the Sci- ence and Engineering Quad needed to be repaired. Paving and sidewalk repairs were another priority Also, electrical lines were upgraded to replace 25 year old cables and to compartmental- ize Sections of campus. Finally, the barren wasteland surrounding the Nott Memorial, created as a result of heavy construction last spring coupled with a summer drought, became a plush, fertile, grass covered field after sod was laid down and aerated. As a result of these structural changes, many departmental re- locations have taken place on campus. The Psychology Depart- ment has been moved from the Psychology Building, where rooms will remain vacant pend- ing renovation, to the tpird floor ofBaily Ha11. The Graduate Man- agement Institute (GMI), for- merly occupying Baily Hall's third floor, is now sharing Lamont House with Educational Studies and the Graduate and Continuing Studies Departments. Fero House, the former house of Graduate and Continuing Studies, will now house Alumni Affairs, the Annual Fund, the Corporate Foundation, and the Federal Grants Support Offices. College Relations, which also fonnerly occupied Lamont House, is now located in 27 North Terrace in place ofEducationa1 Studies and Women's Studies_ In turn, Women's Studies has been moved to Reamer Campus Cen- ter Room 302 (fonncrly known as the College Center). . The relocation of every depart- ment involved moving 70 em- the building's designers did make one mistake- they \didn't put in beds for all of us who seemed to spend all our time here.\ And to Joseph Hinchey '4 7, chairman of the College's Board ofTrustees, \The name Reamer represents ali we aspire to. We all admire you, and we're all in- debted to you. continued on page 3 ployees to new quarters with the aid of student workers and sum- mer help. This massive effort was headed by Richard Patierne and Aaron Lagasse ofCampus Opera- tions. Lauren Rucinski, coordi- nator of campus planning, helped with the logistics of the moves.

Campus News Convocation Festivities by Michelle Ellis News Editor The opening convocation of Union's 20lst year was cel- ebrated on Wednesday, Septem- ber 6th at Memorial Chapel. Fes- tivities were initiated by an aca- demic procession. The proces- sion included administrators, fac- ulty, and th~ 1994::-1995 Dean,s List Students. Welcoming re- marks were offered by David B. Chapnick, Vice Chairman of the Board ~f Trustees, Professor George M. Butterstein, Charinian of the Faculty ExecutiveCommit- tee, and Kenton R. Chase; Presi- dent of the StrudentForum. A memorable aspect ofthe con- vocation was the presentation of the prestigous Phi Beta Kappa Prize for outrstanding General Education Achievement. Laurie Kirschner '98 recieved Honor- able Mention and Sara Saltsman '98 wasthisyear'srecipientofthe award. Professor Douglass Klein, President .of the Alpha of New York Phi Beta Kappachapter pre- sented the prize. Dean's List stu- dents were acknowledged by Linda E. Cool, Dean of the Fac- ulty and Vice President for Aca- demic Affairs The investiture of Jay E. Newman as the R. Gordon Gould Professor of Physics was an ex- citing ·componet of the evening. Gould,.oftheClasssofl941, es- tablished the Chair in honor of his mentor, professor of physics Frank L. Studer. Gould fontlly recalled how Studer had sparked Gould's interest in the physics of light and his love of optics. which resulted in his invention of the laser. While addressing the Union community, Gould spoke of his difficulties in securing the patent on the laser. In his address, President Roger H:t:dl urged the Union community to em brace both social and tech· nological change. In recegnizing both the Sesquicentennial ofEn- gineering and twenty five years of coeducation at Union.

Major Improvements of Facilities by Emily Battis News Staff Over the summer, Dining Ser- vices made many improvements to the facilities they operate on campus. Many areas received at- tention. A new meal equivalency system has been instituted, stu- dents have received new meal cards which are now scanned through new registers, and the dining facilities have been reno- vated. This year students. will be given the opportunity to use meal punches for a meal at the Rathskellar. If students belong to a college recognized sorority or fraternity, they can receive reim- bursement to apply to their house meal plan. Students on the fifteen meal plan can use up to twelve equivalencies a week, which en- titles them to $3.12 worth of food·. Those on the ten meal plan re- ceive seven equivalencies worth $4.00 each week, and students on the seven meal plan are allowed four equivalencies· worth $5.00 each week. If you are a member of a house with a recognized kitchen and you do not tum all of your equivalencies over to your house, you may use the rest of them at the Rathskeller. These numbers are temporary and wi11 change next year to a slightly lower number. Many students on campt~s are annoyed with the new card sys- tem. Students are aggravated be- cause they can not get their validine balance or remaining humber of meals after using their card, as they were able to do in the past. Steve Pearse, DirectorofDin- ing Services, explained the rea· son for the new system. Pearse stated that the old registers were rented year to year, costing the school large amounts ofmoney. He also explained that the imple- mentation of the new equivalency plan required the machines to be updated anyway. The new regis- ters will cost the school approxi- mately half as much as the ol<i ones. This savings will allow the school to finance future improve- ments to the facilities and the food. The kitchen equipment at West Dining Hall was replaced with newer modem equipment. This change, although less obvious to students, will allow the dining hall to produce a higher quality of food. When asked what he thought about the past week and the up- coming year, Steve Pearse was very optimistic. With all ofthe Bi(;entennial hoopla behind him he said, \Now we can get down to business listening to students and improving the quality of food.\ continued from page 1 Norton and Sue Reamer, Chairman of the Board ojTrustees Joseph M.

As an aside to moving into their rooms, lectures~ orientation group meetings, and meals helped ev- eryoneto get acquainted with one another. · brientation groups of nine to twelve people were formed to introduce everyone through an interactive approach. However, many students found the events exhaustive. \It took me three days to ac- complish what I could have done in three hours because I had to go to all the OA group meetings,\ freshman Mike DeMicco said. «By skipping the events I was abl'eto meet more people,\ fresh- man Larry Golden said. Suzy Landolphi returned to campus to educate the newcom- ers on protection against HIV and other sexually transmitted dis- eases.

The most important changes on campus this year, however, were with campus safety. This sum- mer, Campus Operations installed eight traditional green light poles and four emergency light poles. Paul Mantica, the head of cam- pus security, said that \the goal of installing the traditional light poles is to accomplish two main tasks. First, by displaci.ng the older, smaller, ineffective, black, light poles on campus, which are easy to knock over, the new stur- dier green poles present less of a hazard and are less prone to van- dalism. Secondly, the new lights have the ability to deliver a greater amount of illumination and diffusion over a greater area than the old ones. Thus, the re- sult is an effective system of light- ing that is operational 99.9% of the time.\ The new emergency light poles resemble the tradi- tional green light poles, except that they are equipped with the word \Emergency\ and a blue strobe light on top, a red opera- tional button, and a \hands-free\ intercom. When the red button is pressed, the strobe light begins to flash and the user is connected with the campus dispatcher via the intercom simultaneously. These new emergency poles are located near the Union Avenue gate and Alumni Gym, between Social Sciences and the Reamer Campus Center, near North Col- lege, and near South College. Mantica communicated that \these emergency poles were in- stalled in part as a result of the five on-campus, personal robber- ies last fall as well as to upgrade campus security.\ Mantica also said that these new emergency poles are better than the pre-ex- isting phones, which are in boxes on the sides of buildings, because \they are easier to see from a dis- tance, are approachable with greater ease than trying to tackle the shrubbery in front of some of the campus walls, use single but- ton operation, and the strobe light on top signals for immediate pro- tection from passersby.\ Mantica also said that \two additional emergency poles are planned to be installed this year. The tenta- tive locationsarebetween the Fox and Davidson parking lots, and between the Hickock House and Potter House parking lots. If these new devices prove to beef- fective in deterring crimes on campus, more phones will be added as funding improves.\ Fi- nally, Mantica, entering his ninth year of service at Union College, expressed a great concern by say- ing that in his nine years it has been extremely rare to receive· a false alarm from the pre-existing emergency phones. However, there were at least three false alarms last weekend alone. Even after all of the spending, structural changes, and security upgrades, Union College can only be as safe as its students are willing to make it. Engstrom of Health Advocates. Engstrom discussed sexuality, al- cohol, and other drug use, as well as the influences and environ- ments that trigger certain behav- ior. A discussion on the novelBless Me Ultima was led by professors Mary Carroll of the Chemistry Department, AT. Miller of the History Department, Louis Martinez of the Modern Lan- guages Department, and Ronald BucineU ofthe Mechanical Engi- neering Department. \After reading the book, I was disappointed with the level ofdis• cussion,\ freshman Aaron Ziff said. Psychology professor Suzanne Benack led a discussion entitled Behind Closed Doors: Love, Sex, and Date Rape. In conjunction with the discussion national I'e\' search statistics were presented followed by a video dealing with date rape. Bringing the class together through a Semi Formal Multicultut:al Dinner was a great success. Greek salad, Indian chicken and Italian Pesto were some of the dishes served. \This was a great event because it was when the orientation groups really bonded,\ Orientation Ad- visor Andrea Zaremba said. \I thought the International Dinner was a nice idea and it was great to have the whole Class to- gether,\ freshman Danielle Rock said.

The pictures that are transmitted over our television screens are so horrific that the natural 'inclination js to tum away fro~ it and ignore the war or to watch .the pictures and express natural remorse and become desensitized to.the.pictures ~at we see. This is the post Cold War where Desert Storm situations are giving way to intense nationalistic fighting, which means a precarious situation for world leaders conducting foreign policy, The explosion of violence, the ethnic cleansing, the fall of two safe havens, the.detainment ofU.N. peacekeepers as hostages, and the terror- istattacks by mortar shells on civilians in Saraj~vo, the Bosnian capital and a United Nations/NATO declared safe haven, show tllat E1,1rope is far prott!cted even when sheltered under the NATO and American. ·militaryumbtella. This area ignited World War I With the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand from Austria-Hungary-leading t.o World War II and the genocide of Adolph Hitler. It seems the Balkans' grip on our future history is ever present and uniquely tied to current policy decisions. The United States must find the peace in the Balkans with our: allies. This fighting is not the Iran- Iraq war where the Superpowers, Israel, and the Arab nations had a strategic inter- est in keeping these two regional powers fighting, thereby containing two principal threats to the Middle East while advanc- ing national interests. The war in Bosnia threate:ps stability on a continental scale which could result in a consuming war along the Southern part of Europe threat- ening the peace and regional economies. This action could draw the NATO alliance into a deeper quagmire due to treaty com- mitments to Turkey and Greece and cause a flood of refugees that would pour into surrounding countries. The refugee situa- tion is a big issue in Europe which has fos- tered ananti-itnmigration movement in the form of skinheads and neo-Nazis that at- tack and kill refugees. To prevent this deepening crisis, the war situation needs decisive leadership on the part of the U.N. command and NATO. Unfortunately, the same unity that defeated Hitler has not been present to contain the fighting in the former Yugoslavia. There are peacekeepers in neighboring countries to prevent the fight- ing from leaving B6snia, but what can we do in Bosnia? ~·Bomb .Them to the Table and HaiiJ!IIet: Oula.Negotiated Settle- ment\ NATO has launched nearly continuous raids on the Bosnian Serbs' infrastructure, (i.e~ ammunition dumps, radar, communi- cations facilities. and ground~ ta air mis- siles sites). This action has forced the Bosnian Serbs to ·let Serbian President Slobodan.Milosevic represent their inter- ests by negotiating from the American pea,ce initiative as a starti~g point. This new American· plan favors autonomy for the S~tbs which witt ·:1)~ ,a major point of contention for ·th~ Muslims. This new ef- fort was achieved by extensive shuttle di~ plol)lacy conducted by Assistant Secretary of State Richard C. B'olbrooke and NATO's Operation \Deliberate Force\ which has launched over 2,000 air combat sorties against the Serbs. The situation is far from stabilized. If all .sides agree to the peace plan, it might not end the fight- ing. Countless cease fires have been agreed to and abandoned in the past. Even if a peace plan is signed and implemented, the three sides may resort to terrorism to achieve more gains just as the Algerian extremists have dune in France to gain in- dependence from the French backed gov- emment.in Algeria. \Arm the Muslims Unilaterally if Necessary; but Do It\ There have been calls and votes that have been passed by Congress to lift the anns embargo that was placed on the Muslims. After the break up of the former Yugosla- via, the Serbs inherited large percentages of the stockpiled weapons whereas the con- tinued embargo on the Muslims is going against their right to self defense. Presi- dent Clinton ordered American Naval ves- sels monthi$ ago to end their participation of the blockade along the Adriatic Coast instituted by the Western nations. This action caused President Clinton to receive flack from Western European leaders. England and France have said that they would withdraw their armed forces con- tingents, the largest of all nations there, if the U.S. unilaterally lifts the arms embargo. Though the measure passed Congress, there is a loophole that states the President can delay implementation for an indefinite number ofthirty day periods so long as he certifies that it is in the national security interests to do so. If we ann the Muslims, and Jet them fight it out, \ ... would we let Sarajevo fall,\ as Bill Clinton has said or do we take the advice of Bob Dole who said, \The peacekeepers are not keeping the peace but supervising the war.\ The debate becomes even thornier with Clinton's promise to send twenty-five The Concordiensis • September 14, 1995 • Page 5 thousand American ground troops to as- sist in the U.N. withdrawal should it be necessary. If the embargo is unilaterally , lifted, the British and French would evacu- ate along with the rest of the contributing nations. The United States would be obli- gated to send in ground troops, a matter that is not popularly supported by the American public. Bearing in mind that the election year is approaching, Bill Clinton who received 43 percent of the vote, is going to avoid any actions that lead to ground involvement in Bosnia. This is- sue, like so many before it, has become politicized. The grips of genocide are reaching further into U.S. Presidential poli- tics and beyond. Bosnia is no longer strictly a foreign policy issue; it is, in fact, a domestic issue as well. What Remains? The fact that there is an election com- ing up is a political minefield that Clinton wants to avoid. The NATO air strikes can facilitate the process of peace, but they can not do it alone. The American people are in the middle of a shifting policy due to changing circumstances in the war zone. They have no stake in intervening because the case has not been made their own. If the Presidential veto of Congress' repeal ofthe embargo is overridden, there is no doubt that National Security Advisor An- thony Lake and the National Security Council will have to find ways to justify that it is in the national security interests to suspend the implementation of arming the Muslims. The Pentagon has been or- dered to begin planning for a nine month. campaign of air strikes to hold the Serbs at bay while the Muslims are armed. The circumstances are such that a negotiated peace is the only way out. What NATO and the U.N. Rapid Reaction Force must ··do is silence the guns. Anytime a gun, mortar, missile, or any other offensive weapon system is activated, the NATO and the U.N. Rapid Reaction force, which should be augmented with more weapons and better support, should continue bomb- ing the infrastructure (assets used that con- tinue to make war} A credible rate would be ten sites hit for every one site that goes off This policy would be designed to si- lence the guns and push the peace. This policy would have to be strictly adhered to. Credibility of intent is an important for- eign policy tool. Once the decision is made to act, action must be taken or the next time confronting aggression and past appease- ment will be much harder. In Bosnia, the options are limited, but the status quo ·is unacceptable.. 1oo many lives; too much blood, too many sacrifices, and too much money have been invested in the security of Europe.

It is hard to believe that a college two hundred years old has only admitted women since 1970. As President Hull stated in his convocation address, \ We can not afford either to overlook or look through anyone or to allow any part of society to remain invisible not because it is expedient, but because it is right.\ This year the campus community can look forward to numerous activities that will celebrate this landmark of Union College history. This year is also important to the new Class of 1999 who have the entire campus and all ofits many opportunities at their fingertips. It is important for all students to avail themselves of these opportunities in order to maintain the excellence ofUnion College. Scon the Student Activities Office, along with students involved in campus organizations, will host an \Activity Fair.\ This is a perfect opportunity to get involved. No one on this campus should ever say they are bored. This year will certainly be a great one for the Union College community. It is a historical year that will be remember for years to come. ' . . OPINIONS & LETTERS .·. · . . . ' \ Praise for Dining Hall Improvements 0. C.S. Criticized To The Editor, I would like to com menton the addition of ethemet computer connections to the dorms. I appreciate the fact that the schoo I spent the money over the summer to make this valuable upgrade. I do not however appreciate the fact that in order to have my computer configured to work with the new system I have to carry it clear across campus to the psychology building. I think it would be much easier for all involved ifO.C.S. set up a day to come to each donn and set student's computers up in their rooms. I don't feel this is an unreasonable expectation if you consider the amount of money we all pay to attend Union. Also I would like to add that just trying to get an ,appointment to have the card planted into my computor is close to impossible. It appears that either there are not enough people who can cater to those interested in ethemet or the whole process is incredibly inefficient. By Tony LaVecchia Opinions Editor I realize what I'm about to do will be controversial and risky. I'm actually going to praise the improvements made by the Union Co liege Dining Services. I appre- ciate the fact that the food and atmosphere of the campus dining halls seem to be better this year. Don't think I'm getting soft, though. If these improvements are not sustained, I will be the first to complain. You can depend on that. Moving along from the com- forting to the annoying, I have noticed several things happening on campus that I find stupid, but at the same time amusing. Does anyone actually expect me to start having people address my mail with the ridiculous new five line ni.ghtmare we have been told to use? Not only is it too long to fit in the space most forms al- locate for addressees, but it is also ridiculous to expect me or any- one to spend years on the phone trying to convince the various agencies who send us mail to change our addresses. What was wrong with the old address? Are there several Union colleges in Schenectady that have several different'\campus centers\? Anyway, getting back on the dining services track, despite my initial compliment, I do have a few things to criticize. I would like to know exactly what is go- ing on with the new Equivalency system. I have to admit, despite my best attempts, I'm having a bit of trouble understanding what equivalencies can be spent where. It can be argued whether or not the administrations new policy is fair to all involved, but what is perfectly clear to me is the new system is more complicated and confusing than ever. Speaking of confusion, which we seem to have the monopoly on lately, I want to know why I can't see what my \declining\ balance is after I've purchased something. I also want to know why I can'tsee how many meals I have left after each time I use a meal at upper class or west. Why were these previously working systems replaced by systems that make life more difficult for stu- dents and consumers? Another system I had previ- ously understood and been able to use without a problem was also changed over the summer. I found out on my first day back that there is a different system for dialing out this year. You used to be able to dial out by entering eight, fol- lowed by your access number ~d the phone number you wanted to reach. I don't understand what was wrong with this system. Now you have dial nine, plus the pnone number followed by your access code. I'd like to know why this change took place and what the advantage of the \new improved\ method is to students. Call me a paranoid maniac, but it seems as though the college has. made a concerted effort to make things more difficult over the summer. Now even a maniac like me realizes that the college prob- ably didn't try to make things harder for us over the summer. I do think that in the future mea- sures should be made not to make so many changes. Although, I better be careful about what I ask for because I just might get it. If that happened, I would have noth- ing to make fun of in my first col- umn next year. In any event, the year is off and running. I urge all in our commu- nity to utilize all of the resources available to us. I also hope that all students will stand up for their rights as consumers by pointing out and protesting unfair practices on campus.

Up until a few years ago, it was considered a howl to watch a man dress women's attire to get a job, run from the law, or pursue another woman(!} What would Americans have thought in 1959 ifJack Lemmon and Tony Curtis starred as drag queens- rather than unemployed musicians who dress as ladies to find work in an all-female band- in the classic comedy, Some Like It Hot!? In this film, Lemmon and Curtis are on the lam after the speakeasy tbey perform in is closed by the cops. Fleeing and out ofwork, they join up with an all-girls band, and soon find it difficult to keep up appearances- especially when Curtis falls for Marilyn Monroe. Lemmon has his share of problems, too, by at- tracting the attentions of an ag- ing millionaire. In the film's clas- sic climax', when Lemmon reveals to his \lover\ that he is not a fe- male, the man politely says, \well nobody' s perfect.\ In 1982's Tootsie, Dustin Hoffman stars as an unemployed actor who cross-dresses to land a part on a daily soap opera. Un- der Sydney Pollack's dire~tipn, Hoffman convincingly portrays· the kind of down-home lady any aging· guy (a.k.a. Charles Durning) could go for. Once again, cross-dressing onlythrows the character into a series of pre- posterous situations, each one more threatening to his .identity than the one before. In 1993's Mrs. Doubtfire, Robin Williams was embraced by audiences nationwide as a comic father who loses his job and his wife, and decides to dress as a nanny to be close to his children. Ignoring the humor and themes of the story, this screenplay is a psychologist's dream to analyze. A guy who cross-dresses to get a job with his family? And the chil- dren end up m1disturbed in the end of the film? With so much heavy makeup, the talented Will- iams is unrecognizable and pulls off a very unlikely idea, making it an entertaining film. Then came 1994 where view- ers saw an Australian film about the real thing: guys who dress up in drag because they want to. The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert is a likable tale about the travels of three men in the outback on a bus. Whether or not you find the characters' actions revolting, the three drag queens reveal a littlebitabout each other as the story unfolds, and the viewer is brought into the world of people who cross-dress for pleasure. While certainly funny, The Adventures of Priscilla did not aim its humor at the sight of men trying to convince other men they were women to get ahead somewhere. Instead, these guys had no qualms about showing the world what they were • and what they liked to be. Priscilla was not me~nt to contain the pratfalls and happy endings of past stories in- volving cross-dressing, and so filmmaking evolved beyond treating Unnatural habits of.soci- ety as objects ofhumor. Now, the actual cross-dressers were funny in themselves, not only because of what they did. So, Hollywood's answer to a well-made foreign film is an in- ferior butinteresting entry into the cross-dressing theme: To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything, Julie Newmar. The Hollywood solution to making drag queens a film subject is. to make them hu- man as well. In To Wong Foo, Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo are drag queens stranded in middle America. They become saviors to country folk, opening their dull lives to fun and learning the v~lue of friendship among each other. Now, it's not even necessary to poke fun at people who dress in drag. In To Wong Foo, drag is :hip, and drag queen~ are just like everyone else: fun to be around, full of good morals to teach, and even heroic. Plus, they even know how to decorate a shabby hotel room! When before it was only proper to see cross,dressing as a laughable thing to do, in today • s films it is not only a state- ment about how differently all humans behave, but how differ- ently we·live with each other in the same society.

Arts and Ent~rtainment ''Dolores Claiborne'' byLarry Paska Arts Editor Rating: ***1/2 (out offour) Dolores Claiborne, the latest film version of a Stephen King novel, is the perfect m<>vie to open the Film Committee's ~all schedule. It is a suspense thriller which combines superb actmg, · glorious photography, and an eerie mood to create perhaps the flnest.Stephen King movie to date. . . Kathy Bates, who a:lso appear.ed in the Stephen King story Mis- . ery, shines as Claiborne, a reclusive housekeeper ac~used o.f mur- dering the woman she cares for. Jennifer Jason Letgh dehver..s 1t · · captivating performance as Clajborne's journalist daughter who returns toherold:hometown from New York intent on discover- ing what happened to her mother and revealing the secrets from her past. The story unfolds with a series of flashbacks, all artfully done by director taylor Hackfmd, who shoots the present scenes in a dull shade of blue and all the flashbacks in bright colors. Bates · . comes off as a sympathetic and wholly misunderstood character who simply wanted life to be perfect and pleasant '\:ith her f~­ . ily, but sawitall cave in with an abusive husband (Davtd Strathatm, great as always) and the detective (Christopher Plummer) who questioned his death and accused her of murder years before. . Rare is the Stephen King movie that creates an eerie atmosphere without being gory orlacking common sense. DoloresClaibome begs the viewer to enter a world of depression, secrets, a~d !flYS• teries, and leave it questioning the long-held values ofnght and wrong. It is a story where everyone from the prejudiced detective to the .substance-abusing daughter is a villain, but only because they never dared to know the truth.

Page lO·September 14, 1995 oTbe Concordiensis 25 Years of Coeducation Union College Celebrates 25 Years of Coeducation: 1970-1995 The Concordiensis is devoting an entire page per week this year to celebrate 25 years of co- education. The campus will be able to read about current and historical events regarding this landmark in Union College history. The Road to Coeducation: Composing a Union courtesy of committee on 25 Years of Co-education Let's pause for a moment, on the eve of our celebration marking the 25th year of full coeducation at Union College, to co11- sider how the college has presented itself at commencement ceremonies. In this most public and private occasion, the per- son selected to address the graduates may arguably be someone who symbolizes or comes close to representing, by virtue of his or her interests and reputation, current campus culture. In q!her words, the com- mencement speaker probably appears to have some connection to the college, and by his or her very presence, becomes the symbol ofthe day. But it is that his or her question which drives this discussion, so now let's take a look at the gender composition of Union's commencement speakers since women were admitted as full-time, first-year stu- dents. Fall 1970 is distinguished as the first tenn when the Blue Gate opened admit- ting the first women joining Union's fresh- man class. Fast forward to Spring 1971, the first commencement marking the first year of full coeducation, and then travel a generation to Spri11g 1995, the 200th year m1d the 25th commencement since Union decided that coeducation was the way we were to b~. In that time, of the 25 commencement speakers invited to address the graduates, their families, faculty, trustees, administra- tion, staff and honored guests, 4 have been women. Our most prolific decade, in tenns of pre- senting a representative profile pf our changing student body through the choice of commencement speaker, was the '70's, when .3 of those 4 women stood in front of Schaffer Library to inspire a joyous gradu- ating class invoking that tried and true axiom of this ritual right of passage, that the world was their oyster. As for the '80's in terms of women speakers, we experienced a drought. In the '90's, so far, one woman has give the com- mencement address. The Union we introduce in this public event, this ending and beginning, is not the Union we've become. TI1is college, known for innovation, some daring changes in . curriculum, notable mostly in the 19th cen- tury, jumped bravely into the bold new world of coeducation in the '70's. We are poised on the eve of a new century, with a Jess than half a decade to go, and nearly half our student population made up of women. Let us work toward making our public face represent how good we are, how far we have come - the way we are, not the way we were. Bateson to Speak on ''Women in Society'' Mary Catherine Bateson to speak for Co-education celebration in October Mary Catherine Bateson, Clarence Robinson Professor of Anthropology and English at George Mason University, will keynote the \Composing a Union: 25 Years of Coeducation\ eel ebrati on on Sat- urday evening, October 7, 1995.

Features The Concordiensis • September 14, 1995 •· Page 11 The Real History of Union College by Jeeves Features Columni$1 In 1923, Epaullet Nott, thrice removed ceusin of Eliphalet Nott, was traveling from Branden burgh to what became, and then ceased te be East Germany. The train was quick, it rocked from side to side like a broken hobby-horse, and it reeked of combustion. Burning trees--cinder in your eye, eh. It was called the Reamer~ express (to Hamburg). Epaullet stuck his head out of the window; the Reamer rocked,. creaked a bit, left little specks of carbon in N ott's eyes; it passed the Black Forest (you've had the cake) and contin- ued onward (to Hamburg). We all know what was invented ther.e. Epaullet Nott didn't, but disembarked anyway. Incidentally, a man named Reamer was the first train conductor to train a monkey to do his job tor him. A truly great man. Also incidental, and com- pletely irrelevant, Jimmy Buffett, born 1940 CE heard about this wacko, Reamer, and wrote a tune which he sold to the Grate- ful Dead. Truly. \End ofline, yah! Snell!\_said a portly attendant. Nott had been having a conver- Madame Luna's Stars Madame Luna is a regis- tered astrologer. World fa- mous people rely on her pre- dictions to lead a full and exciting life. Let her read the stars and help you! Any per- sonal questions can be sent to CC 303 and will be di- rectly sent to Madame Luna. Aries: (Mar. 21-Apr. 19) This year is off to a shaky start but fear not, there is a Jove interest on the threshold. You and your friends will throw a wild party this week- end and an unexpected guest will arrive. Beware of the Golden drink, be afraid, be very afraid. Taurus: (Apr. 20-May 20) Are classes getting in the way already? Don't Jet yQur mind wander to far because academic woes will catch up to you. Besides you will find something. or perhaps someone, very in- teresting in your class. Study group any- one? Gemini: (May 21-June 21) You'll be crushed when you learn that the fabulous Jove poetry you've been receiving from your loved one are actually themes songs from old sitcoms like \Growing Pains.\ bon 't fret, it's better than \Hey babe, what's up?\. Cancer: (June 22-July 22) All of you crabs out there need to get outside. Go camp- ing, hiking or eyen take a stroll in a garden ... just get outside. The air will re- lax you and get you ready for the term both mentally and spiritually. Just don't look up when a flock of birds fly above you. Leo: (July 23•Aug.22) Sex, sex, sex. Is that all you ever think about you horndog? sation with a bearded old fellow named Nicolai Gogol, despite having his head jammed out the window. They talked about war, about fine cuisine, about kill- ing wild animals and wild women. Gogol smoked opium from a wood~carved pipe-- Nott spoke loudly and energetically over the wind noise which only he could hear. He spoke of young maidens and danger- ous hunts, of exquisite meals and the proper way to shave one's chops. Hepolitely re- fused Gogo!' s offer to partake of the .pipe. Must ofbeen the combustion induced by the Reamer. Burning trees-smoke in your lungs, eh. Well, Sherlock Holmes certainly would have joined Gogo I. One can imag- ine who else might have (not I, for sure- not the pipe, anyhow-perhaps the Nett- shaped Buh-ong, tho). What? Gogo I opted not to disembark, but he got off the train anyway. The two men de- cided to do dinner. They found themselves at Haekel' s~ a small country inn of ill and excellent repute, depending who you ask. Haekel 's is where I work. I used to be 1:! trainer, of monkeys and tigers and the like. Too much excitement for my blood. Any- how, Gogol was regaling Nott with tales of his mistresses and enemies in the Ukraine. Nott, still feeling light-headed from the smoke, was picturing large cossak women wearing furry black hats; he was picturing bottles of Vodka; he was feel- ing pretty good. Which was fine, because Gogol, too, was feeling light-headed from his choice of smoke, and he was lying anyway. He had never had a mistress in his life, because he was exceedingly ugly. To differentiate Nott's visions; the cossak women merely swirled in his head~ the bottles ofVodka were actually very real and across the room at the bar. Just like Brandenburg is very real and situated across the plain from Hamburg, providing one takes the Reamer. Not even Gogol could conjure liP some- thing as foul as the Reamer. Shots were poured. I poured them. To my satisfaction, Nott, still feeling pretty good, was now feeling even better. So it went: I poured, Gogol paused to shoot, and resumed his story-telling. Nott rocked idly in his chair. His eyes were bleary, his brain had convinced him that he was a very attractive man, and he was wiftking at the barmaid. Gogol was describing a sorcerer. He was still lying. \Gogol said Nott, between bites of wurst and sauerkraut. \How would you like to come with me back to America, to New York?\ \I can't get back on that damn train,\ Gogol replied. He began to choke. \Ruh- Ree-muh-crap! He hacked again and ex- pectorated. \Reamer!\ he burst out. \No way!\ \Well Nott began, with a curious gleam in his eye. \I am inchargeofaparticularly fine institution of higher learning which could benefit greatly from your-\ And then I burst in. I saw what was com- ing; I had to do it for the sake ofRohawho \Well Gentlemen,\ I said loudly. \How are you finding your repast?\ And then, suddenly, Nott could no longer find his chair, and subsequently found his repast all over the floor. I must say, he speckled my spats with wurst. It was a smaH price to pay, though-1 couldn't let Nott coax all the great minds to his cousins' fine in- stitution of higher learning. I mean, he would ... well, whatever....! can't tell you everything. Not now. Who am I? You may call me Jeeves. What do I know? I know something about everything, and everything about nothing. I know Nott. History, that is. What be- came of Gogol? Check the books. Reamer? Unfortunately so.

Sports Three Out of Four Ain't Bad by Jason Starr Sports Editor To open their '95 cam~ paign, Union men's soccer hosted a four team tournament that was played on campus this past weekend. New York Uni~ versity, SUNY Geneseo, and MIT came to Schenectady for two days ofhard fought action. The Dutchmen are coming offa disappointing season which saw them finish well below .500. They have been hurt by the graduation of a few significant members.ofthe class of'95, most notably (beet) Stuart Polk. Polk was the unquestioned leader of last year;s squad. Playing sweeper, he almost singlehandedly kept the team close inmore than one game. Stu has given the sweeper reins over to a very capable David Grand wetter wha had the oppor~ tunity to learn from Polk last year while playing right defense. Grand wetter captains this year's team along with fellow seniors Vincent Obermeier and Jon Pearlman. These three captains are the team's only seniors and, with eighteen freshman, the Dutchmen are a young bunch. Union played MIT on Sat~ urday in the late game of the pre- liminary round. The Dutchmen seemed only slightly over- matched. MIT won in the ball control depart:rnentand also man- aged to get off more quality shots on goal. Scoring opportunities· were hard to come by for the Union offenders. Union's start- ing attack ofErik Chu and Geoff Sipperly were neutralized for most of the firsthalf. The halftime score was 2- 0 in favor of MIT. They scored with 18 minutesremaining in the half on a long knuckelballing shot from beyond the eighteen yard marker. The second MIT goal was scored with almost 3 minutes leflin the·halfonahalf- voll~y shot that caught ~Onion: goalie Joe Caruso off-guard .. In soccer, a two goal half- time deficit is very ha.:d to aver- come. In this situation, it is im• perative that a goal is recorded early in the half. But the Du_tch- inen could not muster a score until 37 minutes had elapsed. However, Union's wasdefinitely the best goal of the game from an aesthetic point of view. It was the product of a long crossing pass from freshman Ibrahim Adamu. The ball was one-timed out of the air past the MIT keeper by fellow freshman Sam ir Randolf. These two players came off the bench to provide relief for the starting attack of Chu and Sipperly, but,as it tams out, they are a good sign of the talenthidden within the eighteen faces that comprise the rookie class. This team has a future. Of the four teams entered into the tournament, only ·one would walk away emptyhanded. The school provided hardware forthetopthreeteams. On Sun- day, the Dutchmen did all they could not to be THAT team. They played in the loser's bracket against an NYU team that had lost to SUNY Geneseo the day before .. An early Union goal by freshman d.efender Steve Baumgartner put the Dutchmen up to stay. Some solid second-half defense se- cured the win. The freshman have showed some spark in this young season. Credit is due to head coach Aldo Nardiello and the rest of the staff for a success- ful season of recruiting. The ro0kies look like they will be able to contribute this season and maybe with their effort the Dutchmen will make a run for the top of the standings. Field Hockey Puts the Pieces Together John Gasthalter Contributing Writer The 1994 Field Hockey Dutchwomen began their quest for the. Upstate Collegiate Ath~ letic Association Division III crown August 28 as the team re- turned to the playing fields of Union. The team graduated many of its star players in June and is looking to its twelve rook- ies to fill the void left by the graduates. The team is led by senior co-captains Katie Richardson and Michelle McCarte. Although the team is young, Richardson felt that it would be able to stay competitive atthe collegiate level. \Our team is young, but all twelve of the Freshman came from strong pro- grams and fit in very nicely here.\ Thirteen year Coach Charyln Robert said, \This is our build- ing year, and this is our oppor- tunity to build oltr foundation for the next four years.\ The team opened its season on Friday, September 8, with a 1-0 win over Rochester. The teams were evenly matched and the score was tied at zero at the end ofthe first half. The second halfwasno different. However, Union broke the deadlock with about seven minutes left in the game. With the ball loose in front of the goal mouth, Michelle McCarte took a pass from Tonya Capparello andre- directed it past the Rochester goaltender. Coach Robert was satisfied. \I felt we did an ex- cellent job of putting all ofthe pieces together after our pre-sea- son. The players gave every· thing they had and played the game we worked so hard on in pre-season.\ The team left Rochester and traveled to William Smith for a four o'clock game on Saturday, September 9th. Union came out of,the starting-gate very strong, playing a fast-paced, offensive style game. William Smith scored with about seven minutes remaining in the first half At the end of the half, the score re- mained William Smith one, Union nothing. William Smith came out for the second half strong, and the Dutchwomen switched to a defensive style. Coach Robert felt that by play- ing defensively style in the sec- ond half it, did not give them the scoring punch that was needed to counteract what William Smith ·was doing on the field.\ William Smith scored five more goals ending the game with Union shutout 6-0. Cross Country Runs Away With Victory This past weekend the Women and Men's Cross Country Teams traveled to Oneonta to cotn~ pete in their first meet of the season against New Paltz and Oneota. Both teams came away with wins, leaving the New Paltz and Oneonta runners contemplating their skills as Division III runners. From what I gather from the runners that I have spoken to, the only real competition was Union against Union, as the women showed by sweeping the top seven places. As we get underway this year here at Concotdy Sports, I didh 't have time to get real concrete facts, but I do know who placed where. For the women Amelia Audette came off a summer in which she frequented both the weight room and the track to regain her championship form and place first in the 2 and 1/4 mile course. Tamara Saukin placed an impressive second, followed by Sarah Morse in third. last years # 1 runner Kelly Jamieson, in fourth, Linda Seymour in fifth, Katie McDowell in sixth, and Charity McManamam in seventh. For the men freshman Pete Flynn beat out the best runner on campus Nick Conway by one second in a time of21 :OS for the fourmile course. Jay Goldberg, a member oflastyear's third place 4X800 meter relay team at states, placed third in a time of21: 10. Following a runner from New Paltz and Oneonta in sixth was Dave Kunselman. Also finishing in the top ten were Hugh Meyer in seventh, Jon Comeau in eighth (after a year plagued by injuries), Will Morris in ninth in his first season ever of Cross Country, and captain John \Shaggy\ Metz in tenth returning for his first race since last years Cross Country. The teams are showing a lot of promise here early in the season. As they get in better shape some teams around New York state are going to have to step back and recognize that the Union Cross Country team is a force to be reckoned with.

September 14, 1995 PAGE 16 Women's Soccer Strong in Home Debut by Ken Berman Sports Editor The Union women's soccer teamopened their season this past Saturday and mixed a strong de- fense with an opportunistic of- fense to bagel visiting New Paltz, 6-0. The offense was I ed by Nicole Solomos (two goals) and sophomore Liz Kittleman ( 1 goal, 1 assist), while other goals were scored by Kim Fanning, Emily Retterer, and Rachel Getty. The shots goalkeeper Sarah Retersdorf faced were few and far between, thanks to the solid ef- furt by both the defense and midfield, but she was up to the task on all of them. On this cold, rainy morning, a die-hard crowd came out to watch Union, and the team did not disappoint They domina ted from beginning to end, utilizing their superior speed to put New Paltz on their heels for the ma- jority of the game The first shot of the game was registered by junior Amy Powell, who forced the goalie to make a diving save to her left llnion actual1y had numerous chances- to score before their first goal, and their two best both involved Kittleman. The first was off ofa feed from Fan- ning, who sent Kittleman on a near breakaway, but she didn't quite have the angle for a good shot. Their next best chance came on a two-on-one breakaway with Solomos and Kittleman breaking in against a helpless defensewoman. Once again, however, the Dutchwomen came up empty as they were unable to finish the play. It was not until Retterer pounced on a rebound in front of the net and sent the ball flying into the top right comer that Union was able to get on the board. Shortly thereafter Solomos made it 2MO on a beau- tifully executed breakaway. Fan- ning scored the third goal of the RUGBY: Back with a Vengeance by Kathy \Legs\ Walter Sports Staff Yes, .sports fans, the sport you have all been waiting for has returned; rugby is back for the playing. And as you may have guessed, the Union women are getting out their running shoes and cleats, beating off the dust and cobwebs and in the greatest show of physical prowess to sweep the campus since last spring, are getting ready to take on the league!!! We are breaking in the rookies, scouting out our Kings. and, of~course, building up our tolerances (for pain, that is). Although we are not beginning play until the 23rd of September (at Plattsburgh), we felt it would be appropriate to list the top ten reasons to play rugby. (Let me also add that it's not too late to sign up and play. We practice Mon- day-Friday at 4:00PM at the flagpole and no prior experience is necessary.) The Top Ten Reasons Are: 10. You get to play with rubber balls. 9. You learn new songs that ate guaranteed to impress your friends. 8. Hookers are legal so you don't get in trouble for playing with them. 7. Very little equipment (less time needed to get it oft). 6. It's socially acceptable to \strip\ in public. 5. Cleats for increased traction- enough said! 4. We practice at 4:00PM (not AM!!!) 3. You haven't done it right if you go home without bruises. 2. You can always play more than once a day and no one thinks you'reeasy! 1 Beer, beer, beer (oh, and soda, too). See you in two weeks! ! ! game off of an assist from Kittleman, and the rout was on. Meanwhile, the only shot New Paltz managed was a slow drib- bler that somehow found its way through the defense but was harmlessly saved by Retersdorf: Three more goals made the score 6-0, but more important than the score was the way in which the team played. They completely neutralized New Paltz's offense, and atonce the midfield got back on defense and sent lead balls to the for- wards to break .the 0ffside trap. If they continue to play the gameplan put in by new coach Brian Speck t.heir success should continue.

Lederern'C) Union Offense Falters in Opening Day Loss by Ken Berman Sports Editor As the old adage goes, a good defense leads to invincibility, while a good offense will give you the possibility of victory. This past Saturday, the Dutch- men defender's played more than well enough to give the team a chance to win, but the offense was too anemic to take advantage of this. This all added up to a 9-8loss at St. Lawrence, Union's first opening day falter since 1988. The loss also broke Union\s five game winning streak against St. Lawrence, a stretch that dates back to 1972. Just how well did the defense play? Well, try these numbers on for size: they had six quar- terback sacks, four forced turn- overs, and allowed just 67 yards in total offense. Not only that, but they (along with the special teams unit) put the offense in great field position, which they squandered all day long. Some credit, however, must go to the St. Lawrence defense, who did an admiral job againstthe (pow-, erful?) Union rushing attack, giving up only 61 yards on 50 carries. The Saints managed three interceptions and three sacks against young quarter- backs Ryan Smith and Todd Ellis, recovered two fumbles, and gave up only two field goals. The Dutchmen came into the game as Upstate New York's top ranked team and St. Lawrence last, but this game showed why games are decided on the field, and not in the polls. Union's special teams setup Union's first five points with blocked punts. Junior Shuron Morton blocked the Saint's punt on the fourth play of the game, giving the of- fense the ball on the St. Lawrence 11. They could not convert in the \Red Zone,\ how- ever, and had to settle for a 20 yard Roger Egbert field goal. A second blocked punt by fwsh-' man Justin Campbell provided Union with two more points when the ball was recovered by a Saint in his end zone, and was subsequently tackled for a safety by Junior Jason Greenstein. The defense continued it's strangle· hold of the SL U offense right on through the quarter, as sopho- more defensive back Len Mortimore intercepted a pass at the SLU 41. The offense could not move the ball in for a touch- down, as Egbert had to bail them out with his second field goal of the game, a 44 yard blast (tying his career high). With the way the defense was playing, an 8-0 lead looked aw- fully safe. The Saint's rushed for -21 yards on 23 carries in the first half, and finished with •37. Junior linebacker Mario Maltese~ senior DE Andy Leach, junior DE Denton Randolph, sopho- more tackle James Kochan, and senior nose guard Brad Duffy were each credited with a sack. Senior strong safety Kevin Pessolano had one interception, while Mortimore also had a fumble recovery. Regardless~ one mistake each by the punting unit and the offense would pro- vide St. Lawrence with all the offense they would need. Attlleir own 36, with under two minutes to play, Union attempted to punt away the ball on fourth down. However, the snap was dropped,. which allowed SLU to set up for a20 yard field goal. On Union's very next play from scrimmage, a second fumble gave St. Lawrence first and goal at the 5. On second down, the Saint's threw a five-yard touchdo-wn pass, to take a 9-8 lead. This would be all the scoring they would need for the victory. On Saturday, the fighting Dutchmen will look to rebound against WPI at 1 :30 here on Frank Bailey Field. The Engineers also faltered in their first game, suf- fering a 16-6 loss to Ursin(io Hall)us, and have lost 10 games in a row to Union. If Union is to make a run at the playoffs this year, a turnaround will haveto be in order soon. - - VI t< n VI a n Sl S1 0 a n a a { c t t •

Jere my Smith) Career Festival Prepares Union Students by Adrian MacLean News Staff To guide Union students into thejobmarket, theCareerDevel- opment Center will host the 17th annual Career Festival on Sep- tember28. Eighteen graduate schools and forty different companies will be participating in this year's festi- val. The festival is the largest given in comparison to Union's peer group. Invitations have been extended to neighboring colleges, but the turn out usually consists ofUnion students. Five hundred students partici- pate in the festival yearly. Ac- cording to the Assistant Director of the Career Development Cen- ter, Thomas penham, this is an opportunity to break the ice in the •. job search. \The Career Festival is like a buffet table. You get a chance to sample different schools and companies,\ Denham said. The National Society ofBlack Engineers and the Society ofHis- panic Professional Engineers will host a Career Festival Reception on the 27th. Visiting companies and graduate schools will pay $15 in support of the societies and provide another opportunity for students to learn about them. In preparation for the festival, drop in hours have been created. From September 13 through the 26th, the center's 15 minute ses- sions will be from one to five. Although the office will be closed on the day ofthe Career Festival, it will be open from nine to four on the 27th and from nine to three on the29th. Everyone is encouraged to par- ticipate in the event because the earlier students begin researching, the more options they will have. Denham feels students should make monthly visits to the center as part of their academic learning. At the least, the CDC can help students write a resume, find in- ternships, or just explore ideas. \The students are educating about an investment in the future,\ Denham said, \my equation for employment: E+E+e=E (Educa- tion+ Experience+ extra curricu- lar activities= Employment).\ Students who want to prepare can pick up a memo entitled How to Get the Most Out of The Ca- reer F estiva/. Thr CDC suggests that students try a mock inter- view, which are also available by appointment. Denham's best tip is to presentone's selfwell. This includes dressing nicely, arriving early, having good eye contact, presenting a resume and follow- ing through with thank you notes. \We want them to know they are dealing with Union students that are focused, sharp, polished, pre- pared and hungry for their job or graduate school search,\ Denham said. Most of the schools and com- panies are from New York and the northeast region. This tends to be the trend because of the dense population of students at Union from those regions. Any- one seeking westem opportunities can \tailor career services to their needs.\ To make the CDC available 24 hours a day, they will have a home page on the World Wide Web within the next week. ·stu- dents will be able to receive the connection all over the world.

It is known as Campus Action, aselt:.described 'socially progres- sive' group that supports .I iberal causes in college campu~es around the Capital O.istrict. Started at Union in 1992, Cam- pus Ac.tion is rnade up .of student coalitions, faculty, and staff. The mair.~ goals are to promote a more 'activist climate' on campus and to strengthen communication among the various c1 ubs at Union that are concerned with social is- sues. Although it is not generally in the spotlight, Campus Action has worked very hard to bring about many influential changes. Mem- bers of its board, who also repre- sent other social groups, are cred- ited for bringing an Africana Studies departm(!nt and a Multicultural Resource Centerto campus. In addition to their activities at Union, members of Campus Ac- tion are also involved with state and national concerns. The orga- nization has been responsible for promoting large rail ies in AI bany to protest the state budget cuts that affected low income students and for organizing teach-ms against the Contract of America.

Many students w~re bpJI:Jered ~y t11is. decision because it came without any con- sultation of the student body. Many students protested the an- nouncement, and a few proposed alternatives. A few ofthe alterna- tives were seriously considered, and one was agreed upon after much deliberation and compro- mise. The Student Affairs Com- mittee looked at both the financial effects of the plan and the effect it would have on student life. Starting this fall students were given different numbers of meal equivalencies depending on the meal plan they purchased. These meal equivalencies allow students to purchase a meal at the Rathskellar with a meal punch or declining balance. The meal equivalencies can also be turned over to a recognized Greek kitchen. The plan is very benefi- cial to independents because they are being given a dining option they never had before. The mem- bers of the Greek community on campus are disappointed. The original proposed plan returned enough money for equivalencies to the houses to continue to run the kitchens. The accepted plan does not return enough money to run the kitchens on only equiva- lencies. Out oftwelve recognized Greek kitchens, only four con- tinue to operate under the new meal plan. The Student Affairs Commit- tee announced their decision so late Spring Term that they de- cided to temporarily give more meal equivalencies this year. This year a student will receive twelve equivalencies with a fif- teen meal plan and next year they will only receive seven. Students on the ten meal plan currently re- ceive seven equivalencies and next year they will receive five. The seven meal plan allows four equivalencies this year and will only allow three next year. The new meal plan has caused much confusion on campus. Hopefully with time, the student body will adjust and take the changes in stride. New Profs .... Banner Year for Admissions continued from page 3 from Empire State College.

This year an all time record was broken, as the applicant pool reached 3554. \I really appreciate the friendly atmosphere I recieve here on the Union campus. The teachers and students are defi- nitely more cooperative and will~ ing to assist you,\ said sopho- more Michael Dussault who transferred from Hudson Valley this year. Students are also turning down c-elrege choices like Michigan University, Cornell University, Trinity College, and the Univer- · sity ofRochester.to come to Union for a unique college experience. The class of 1999 is definitely a group of diverse and extremely talented students. Union's in house academic rating which, combines several credentials in- cluding grade point, class rank and standardized test scores, ~hows a promising increase from 11% to 13% in the group oftop class stu- dents. Several of these students have also been. recruited for their excellent sportsmanship and skill. The gender representation of the Class of 1999 is fairly balanced: 47% female and 53% male. But statistics show that the minority population on campus has dropped significantly. \We have noted the decrease in minorities and we will die trying to get their representation back up next year,\ said Dan Lundquist, Vice President of Admissions. \We are actively seeking assis- tance from people who really care about diversity to help us out.\ Union is still one of a few se- lect colleges in the U.S. that con- tinues to meet the full need of stu- dents who apply for aid and about 55% ofthecurrent freshmen are receiving Union College scholar- ships. w Co1 Sta1 ess; gos qui· fon fou pea the Ort rest the: mu ach wil - ena ity, aga ach wil, tan I Iw the in t CIV and tha the gu) tidi om ans

World News byAnandRao ,. Class of 1996 The September 14, 1995, issue of The Omcordiensis asked readers ifthe United States should use whatever means are nec- essary to achieve peace in the former Yu- goslavia. The answer to this question is quite simply \no.\ The situation in the former Yugoslavia is a civil war being fought among three distinct groups of people: the Muslim inhabitants of Bosnia, the Roman Catholics of Croatia, and the Orthodox Christians of Serbia. Mutual resentment and animosity runs deep among these groups of people, and, no matter how much force the United States employs to achieve peace in the former Yugoslavia, it will fail miserably. Our com1try may have · enough firepowerto destroy aU ofhuman- ity, but history.<has shown over and over again that outside intervention does not achieve peace in a civil war. A civil war will only come to an end when its contes- tants grow tired of killing each other. If I were President of the United States, I would be most reluctant to take sides in the Balkan civil war .. The media reports in the United States concerning the Balkan civil war have been outrageously biased and simple-minded. No one should assume that in this war the Bosnian Muslims are the \good guys\ and the Serbs are the \bad guys.\ The si:l;lJ.atio~ in the Ba:lkans is mul- tidimensional and complicated beyond one's imagination. There are no simple answers in this region. Nor should any- one assume, as Mr. S~ndler did,thatthere exists some sort ofMuslirn/Croat Fed- eration against Sefbia. The Croatians have their own agenda, and they prob- ably would not mind seeing the Balkans \ethnically cleansed\ of all Muslims. TheUnited States should also think twice about treating Croatia as an ally. Let us not forget that during World War II, Ro- m at} Catholic Croatia, in collaboration with Nazi Germany, succeeded in mur- dering more than seven hundred thou- sand Serbs. Unfortunately, thanks to the biased reporting of the American media, most Americans are only dimly aware of what Croatian authorities did to the Serbian people between 1941 and 1945. For forty-five years, peace was an elusive goal in the Middle East, in spite of all the efforts made by the United States to bring about genuine change in the region. Peace is now within sight in the Middle East because Prime Minister Rabin ofistael, King Hussein of Jordan, and others finally grew tired of the kill- ing. In the end, it was up to the inhabit- ants and leaders of the Middle East to bring peace to their lands. In the end, it will be up to the Roman Catholic Croatians, the Orthodox Christian Serbians, and the Bosnian Muslims to put aside their religious, ethnic, and linguis- tic differences. It will be up to them, not us, to achieve peace in the Balkans. There is absolutely nothing that Bob Dole and Bill Clinton can do about the back- water of Europe. we ~N~ GUi 1'\\a oe.r\C\1!

Jail is not supposed to be a good place. We send people there as a punishment. Yet many criminals see what really happens and know that we are soft on crime. So we have to go one step further. Executing those who have proven themselves inca- pable of obeying the law and have acted as a threat to others will not only serve as an example to future criminals, but it will prevent these criminals from acting again. There is no good reason why we should support mass murderers, rapists, and drug dealers with our money when it will only help to convince others that the judicial system is weak. That is why New York State is going to and should impose a death penalty. Lawbreakers may then come to believe that we are serious about dealing with crime.

Many of the upperclassmen mentioned events like FitzHugh Ludlow Day and Camp Union. These events included games, barbecues, bands, comedians and fireworks. These events were created to instill a feeling of camaraderie, community and to boost student and faculty morale. Well, what ever happened to them? Most ofthese traditions had been quashed by 1989. Yes, Union still has activities like . Springfest, but usuaHy there is a dismal student turnout. \Vhy? Some sttidents reply that these events have. become \boring \the same thing over and over again, it and 11 dull. '' These activities also seem to lack a feeling of camaraderie among the Union College community. Student Activities organized a concert for this. past Sunday night with \Matthew Sweet\ and \Belly\ perfonning. The turnout for this event was on the verge ofbeing embarrassing. Not even half of the Feildhouse was full. Why? Many students were asked why they did not go to the concert. Most.rept:ied that they had eithernever heard ofthe performers or that they did not want to go on a Sunday night. Two suggestions that earned merit were; 1) Uniol'l. needs to get more popular bands. One student asked, \Why is it that state schools are able to get bands such as \Live\, \The Blues Travelers\ and \The Beastie Boys\ when we here at Union pay more than double than them in tuition?'' 2) Hold the concert on a Friday or Saturday night and begin them fairly early, around 7:00 or 8:00pm. This past Sunday's concert is just one example of the faltering of Union College activities. It is not only up to Student Activities to organize and think ofideas _to promote school unity. It i~ up to certain members of the Student Forum , the students as well as the faculty and administration to help create a \bett~r Union.\ Speak with your repres~ntatives and do something to improve the student activities at Union College. In Defense of the Orientation Program To the Editor: I am writing in response to\\' Adrian MacLean's article in the September 14, 1995 edition of The Concordiensis entitled · \ii:i'rdsh C>rienrarion Not Up to Par\. In the article MacLean gives a brief explanation of Ori- entation and quotes four Frosh and one Senior involved with Orientation, but seemed uncertain with the purpose of Orientation. First let me state that this let- ter comes from the Orientation Committee, a committee of six students chosen by Dean Kate Schurick after a rigorous inter- view process. We were chosen early in Winter Term, and work closely together to plan and pre- pare EVERY aspect of Orienta- tion, from the scheduled activi- ties to the menus of each meal, attempting to satisfy the goals of the Administration as well as the predicted needs of the first year students. We try to acclimate all first year students to life at Union, educate them and facilitate a feel- ing of community with their fel- low class members as well as the school as a whole. In order to do this, The Committee chooses approximately 50 Orientation Advisors without the assistance of the Administration. These OAs work directly with the first year students in small groups. Orientation is always \jammed packed\ with activities for two reasons. First we have a very small period of time to do many things that The Committee and the Administration deem neces- sary. Second, we want to keep first year students too busy to think about being homesick. As for Freshman Mike DeMicco's statement about OA group meet- ings not allowing him to accom- plish the thing he found neces- sary to do, we disagree. First, we schedule time for registration, advisor meetings and department meetings. Second, OA group meetings are designed to impart a wealth of information to the first year students, and are not the waste of time that Mike may have believed them to be. OA's en- tertain questions on everything from academics to Greek life. These meetings allow first year students a chance to ask questions they were not comfortable ask- ing an Admissions officer, a tour guide or in front of their parents. The group meetings, and the en- tire Orientation Program for that matter, are also designed to al- low first year students to meet many members of their class. Freshman Larry Golden com- mented that he was able to meet more people by skipping events. Well, Larry, I'm proud ofyou, but did you ever think that you may have missed something else aside from meeting people. I am speaking of class unity. Larry. Orientation and Senior Week are the only times that you will be alone with your class at Union. Plus, since attendance at many events was high, I wonder how many more people you could have met if you just went to an event. As I have previously men- tioned, Orientation is a time for first year students to become ac- climated to Union College. First year students must make choices about friends, their futures, al- cohol and drug use and sex often on their first night on campus. In order to remind first year stu- dents of their responsibilities to themselves, the Administration asks that Orientation be a time for discussion of these issues. It is up to The Committee to find ways to do this that will engage and entertain the first year class. Suzi Landolphi was part of this plan. Students at Union College are very familiar with Suzi's pro- gram, and it has not changed much over the years. Although some may consider her act of- fensive, or even disgusting, m'?st feel that she is entertaining, and is most certainly not sexist as freshman Jon Gasthalter attests. If anything in the world has been touched by the politically correct Union College, and specifically the Orientation Program of Union College. Finally I would like to com- ment on freshman Aaron Ziff' s statem~nt that the discussion of the novel Bless me, Ultima was not up to a proper level. If Aaron · was disappointed with the level of the discussion, then he should be disappointed with the mem- bers of his class and with him- · self. It was not up to The Com- mittee to come up with wittY, intelligent things for the first year students to mutter about the book. Instead, the discussion was the sole product of the minds of the first year class. I wonder, if Aaron was so disappointed, why he didn't grab the microphone and make an insightful ~ddition to the discussion. It seems that Aaron, and sev- eral members of the Union Col- lege community are suffering from a malaise that allows them to criticize and complain about things. but does not motivate them to work to change things. If Aaron, Jon, Larry and Mike feel that Orientation is \Not Up to Par\ then they should do some- thing about it. Apply to the Ori- entation Committee in Winter Term, become an Orientation Advisor, or at least urge future first year students to make the most out of their Orientation.

Arts and Entertainment The Concordiensis • September 21, 1995 • Page7 ''Crimson Tide'' T-Shirt Design Contest The Union College Jazz Ensemble is looking for aT-shirt design by Larry Paska Arts Editor Rating: *** 1/2 (out of four) When Denzel Washington meets Gene Hackman for the first time in Crimson Tide, the viewer can feel the tension in the air. There sits Hackman, a seasoned veteran of the Navy, chomping down on his expensive cigar and eased back in his chair, an obvi- ous ~ign of authority, Speaking to him is Washington, standing by to take the helm ~f a powerful submarine being sent to_ check out a pqssible nuclear attack. Hack- man detests Washington and makes no real effort to hide the fact. Knowing that they will be spepding the rest of the film 20,000 leagues under the sea with each other brings an eerie chill into the air. Where most films sag at this point, Crimson Tide only begins to warm up. For two hours, the two leads propel theirfeud under- water, as Washington reli'eves Hackman of cmnmand, only to face ins4bordination himself. As the submarine begins to sink fast, quick thinking is the only thing that can keep the sub going, but, with so many devious minds at work, survival seems the most re- mote possibility. It is easy to see this film as a mild rip-offof The Hunt for Red October, in style ifnot in theme. Director Tony Scott (True Ro- mance, TopGun) doesnotletthe pace slow for even a second, as most .of the film is shot in the claustrophobic submarine. Sound purists will delight in the ear-blasting effects, the perfect showcase for the newly-emerging DTS digital sound system in the- aters; adventure lovers will once again discover (after last year's Speed) that it is possible to make a great action movie without a high body count; and fans ofboth Hackman and Washington will find their heroes in top form. Without a doubt, this is Scott's smoothest - and most flawless - film to date, and a sure sign that mainstream Hollywood movies do have their merits. For pulse-pounding momen- tum from start to finish, the only choice is to get swept away by this Tide! (Rated R, Hollywood Pictures) This Week: While You Were Sleeping. Undoubtedly the most charming romantic comedy of the year. Sandra Bullock plays a token booth collector in Chicago who unintentionally masquerades as a hospitalized man'.s fiancee after he was injured.

Chances Are It Wasn't The Movies! by Larry Paska Arts Editor With the summer movie season officially over, it is time to take a look back and examine the films that made the Summer 1995 movie season so important Un- fortunately, there are relatively few noteworthy entries to talk about. Those films which may hold some distinction either came and went too fast or were hardly released at aU to the mainstream audience! There were no record-breaking movies like last year, which had two (Forrest Gump and The Lion King each grossed over $300m il- l ion). At the end oflast summer, seven films had earned more than $100 million, considered the \magic mark\ in box office re- ceipts to ensure a film \hit\ sta- tus. To date, only three films - Batman Forever($185 million), Apollo 13 ($170 million-range) and Pocahontas ($150 million- range)- have broken the barrier, with Die Hard With a 'Vengeance and Casper approaching the mark in second-run movie houses. Speaking of Casper and Pocahontas: they may have been hits, but have you met anyone who actually saw them? Or for that matter, liked them? While 1995 is a better year for films in general, fewer films have become actual huge hits, the kind of movies that play forever and spawn countless sequels. (Those that were sequels will most likely not see anymore offspring in their name.) The lower-budget, \art- house\ films are actually per- forming better than before, earn- ing more money compared to their cost than the gigantic block- ,busters. Maybe the public is fi- nally telling Hollywood it's tired of mediocrity! Or maybe every- one just wants to play it safe and wait for the movie to be released on video. In any case, it was a summer of unremarkable movies. Films like Dangerous Minds be- came hits by default~ there sim- ply wasn't anything better to see! It was a summer where films that feel like they should have come out in the Spring- A Walk in the Clouds, for example - actually saved face because Bushwhacked did not pass as acceptable on anyone's standards. Here's a sample of what Hollywood scraped up for theaters this sum- mer. in case you already forgot: Die Hard With a Vengeance Cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) is now prancing around New York, with the help of Samuel L. Jackson, evading a groupofGennan terrorists. Ifyou can buy the plot filled with more holes than Swiss cheese, you can deal with the unrealistic scenarios and action sequences, and be en- tertained. But what is Jeremy Irons doing in a movie like this?! Rating: ** 112 Brave/teart Mel Gibson directs and stars in this three-hour-long epic of a leg- endary Scottish hero. It's long and occasionaly drags, but there are plenty of realistic combat scenes, and an outstanding sup- porting perfonnan9e by Patrick McGoohan. Must-see filmmak- ing. Rating: *** 1/2 Congo A largely no-name cast heads this moderate hit based on the Michael Crichton novel about a dangerous menace deep in the Congo, killing expeditionary groups there. Tim Curry puts on the worst accent ever heard, and the plot barely skims the last half of the novel. A complete waste oftime. Rating. * l/2 Batman Forever As usual, a Batman movie doesn't actually live up to the promise of its trailer, but Val Kilmer does a better imitation of Michael Keaton than Keaton him- self1 Jim Carrey gets too much screen time, Tommy Lee Jones gets too little, Nicole Kidman is bland, and Chris O'Donnell doesn't even appear until quite a ways into it. Visually-exciting, and a definite improvement over Batman Deux. Rating:*** Pocalrontas Cheap animation (was it Disney or Don Bluth who made this?) and unmemorable charac- ters highlight this feature, which tinkers with history to the point of absurdity. Characters break out into little one-minute songs for no reason, and Disney handles death in a P.C. way that'll make you run for the hills. Badas kids' history (no, son, trees don't talk), and the story is more fit for a Sat- ~rday morning cartoon. Rating: ** JudgeDredd Dredd-ful. Need anyone say more? If you really wantto get a headache, try hitting yourself with a hammer. It's faster, and won't cost you $7.50 to do. Apollo/3 Absorbing (if overlong) bio of the space shuttle flight to the moon in 1970. Even though ev- eryone knows the outcome, it still remains a tense film to watch. Of course, it was a hit because Tom Hanks was in it. The man can do no wrong. So, does this mean that if he appears in Police Academy VI!!, that series will gain a new life at the. box office? Rating: *** Species Candidate for the funniest film of the summer. See Gandhi (I mean, Ben Kingsley) chase after a sexy alien for two hours! See the alien attempt to mate with dozens of men in order to repro- duce! This movie has it all for the guys to enjoy: cartoon ish ac- tion, substandard special effects, and a female alien that is naked for nearly the whole film. Rat- ing:** Nine Months Ignoring the obvious publicity ploy, Hugh Grant is really funny in a role Woody Allen couldn't have done better. When his girl- friend becomes pregnant, he has to learn how to handle responsi ... bility and fatherhood ... but he can't. Robin Williams is a delight as a Russian doctor. Mindless fun. Rating: *** Watenvorld It's over two hours long, yet it never finds the time to tell the viewer how the future works. Instead, we see Kevin Costner fly- ing through the air and swim- ming, killing all sorts of people and going after Dennis Hopper - in his tired bad-guy role. A Jot doesn't make sense in the future, like what that $200 million bud- get went into. This movie is like Costner himself: it wants to com- mand attention, but tries to outdo itself too often unsuccessfully. Rating:** Kids Disturbing and unrelenting, photographer Larry Clark· s direc- torial debut shows a day in the I ife of a group of NYC teens who live for sex, drugs, and alcohol. Re- leased unrated after a huge battle with the ratings board, Kids is too powerful for the average taste, but if you can stomach its themes, you 'II walk away feeling either repressed or glad you never tried to imitate them. Rating: ***1/2 Desperado Robert Rodreguiez's remake/ sequel to his $7,000 El Mariachi follows Antonio Banderas as the mariachi, toting machine guns in his guitar case. Look for cameos by Quentin Tarantino and Cheech Marin. It passes the time, and contains some interesting gun- play.

Rated R, Universal Pictures. Rating: ***1/2 (out of four) Richard Price's 1992 novel set in the Brooklyn projects is trans- formed into a tragic aad gripping film by Spike Lee, in what can ·easily be called his finest motion picture to date, even surpassing the emotional impact of his pre- vious epic-length biography, Malcolm X. Lee, whose films became fa- mous for their controversy and unconventional themes, has mel- lowed out now, focusing on a typical cinematic theme (explor- ing New York drug culture is not exactly a novel thing) but draw- ing out so much passion that the viewer is enveloped in a small world oftragedy. Of course, Clockers is really nothing more that a standard who- dunit, but the players are notre- duced to.stereotypes and their ac- tions (even the good guys) are all devious. In a shocking opening montage, Lee shows the viewer victims of street gunplay against the backdrop of opening credits. A little later on, when detectives Keitel and Turturro are examin- ing the body of a shot store night manager, Lee recreates homicide in true form: the smell of the corpse, the splattered brains, the gratuitous blood. It is all the de- tectives can do but crack jokes over the dead body to keep their sanity amidst the onlookers in the dead of night. Phifer plays Strike, a teenage- drug dealer who is two people at once: a sympathetic loner and a man responsible for his actions. His stress-induced ulcer is not CHOIR! DANCE! ORCHESTRA!

When his \boss Rodney (the superb Lindo), or- ders Strike to kill another deal'er who has robbed him of cash (the store manager), Strike panics. He goes to a bar andsees his brother, who promises he'll take care of the manager for him. Strike's brother, however, is a completely opposite character. He's a hard- working citizen, slaving at two menial jobs to support his family and move them out of the projects. While Strike makes ten times the money dealing on the streets, his brother prefers to live a life ofhonesty and keep dean. So when the murder is commit- ted, detective Rocco Klein (Keitel) naturally suspects Strike, although it is his brother who claims to have committed the crime and turns himself in. Klein is casually racist, believ- ing Strike to be the killer simply because he \'is the type to do such a thing,\ yet sympathetic to him in offering to protect him if only he'll confess. Meanwhile, as Strike's ulcer worsens with added pressures all around him, he opens atwelve-year-old neighbor to his world by shaving his head and showing him how to defend himself. Although the boy's mother tries to protect him, this innocent adolescent becomes a frightened pawn virtually over- night, stealing Strike's gun. Lee tinkers with various images throughout the film, the most suc- cessful of which are Rocco's flashback to the scene of a mur- der committed by the boy, and Rodn.ey's flashback to the first murder he ever committed. Rodney, repeating this scene to Strike in his car, becomes a man whose word cannot be trusted, and who is in all ways an intense madman. Running his \opera- tion\ under the disguise of a store, Lindo's Rodney is the true evil in the film, creating a lucrative busi- nessoffofinnocentpeople. Yes, it's all stuff that has been done be- fore, but has it ever been done so forcefully? · Terence :Rlanchard 's score, while overdone~ provides cool emotion throughout. Perhaps the only real gripe to note is the su- perfluous role for Turturro. For a man who receives second star billing, he never does much in the film; his scenes are mostly con- fined to getting out ofthe car with Keitel and making racist insults in the pof!ce station unintention- ally. A waste for such a talented actor (he was brilliant in Quiz Show). Now that Spike Lee has toned down his themes (last year's Crooklyn was pretty tatne ), he has proven himself capable .of re- working tired formulas into meaningful messages. Clockers succeeds in portraying a seem- ingly '\decent\ housing project riddled with crime and drugs, where lives are lost before they even take shape. Strike, who has a love for trains, has never ridden on anything but a subway - even a pathetic drug dealer is made to have humanity, deep within. In the last scene, when Rocco is say- ing goodbye to Strike, he is asked why he never went ahead and tried for the easy prosecution. It is Rocco's silent response that gives the best answer- never has so much been said in so little.

Dr. Bateson is the author of such well-known books as Peripheral Visions~· Learning Along the Way, Composing a Life, Within a Daughter's Eye~· A Memoir of Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson and · Thinking Aids. Dr. Bateson is Clarence J. Robinson Professor in Anthropology and English at George Mason University. Mary Catherine Bateson's thought is rooted in cultural anthropology and the study of communication. Because anthropologists are accustomed to thinking of whole human communities in their environments, they are trained to search out the relationships be- tween different aspects of human society, from nutrition to leadership to ritual. This means that anthropologists, looking at our own society in comparison to others, often bring a distinctive point of view, recognizing patterns invisible to narrowly defined experts. Her recent emphasis has been on adapting to changes in the life cycle and gender roles. Friday, September 29 4:00p.m. Women's Socc.er vs. Skidmore Help cheer on the team and new coach Brian Speck.

Page 10 • September 21, 1995 • The Concordiensis 25 Years ofCoeducation Union College Celebrates 25 Years of Coeducation: 1970-1995 Florence Buckland: First Woman Graduate and a Pioneering E~gineer Contributed by tire Bicentennial Committee 011 25 Years of Coeducatio11 l11is article is the second in a series about Union College's first woman graduate, Flo- rence Fogler Buckland. Florence Fogler Buckland received her training in engineering at MIT (bachelors degree in electrochemical engineering, 1920) and Union (MSEE, 1925) at a time when few women entered technical pro- fessions. She worked at General Electric for six years in the 1920's, left the work force for 16 years to raise a family, and returned to GE in 1942, where she re- mained employed until her retirement in 1963. T11roughout her career, she was viewed as a pioneer, and she was the sub- ject of many newspaper articles on women in engineering. One of the topics on which she was often quoted was the education of women as engineers and the potential for women in the engineering work force. When Florence Fogler attended MIT (1916-1920), she dis_covered that, although women had been admitted to MIT since 1868, the textbooks used in her course work contained practical examples that were familiar to men, not women. She was able to grasp the concepts by relating them to the workings of household appliances, such as stoves. Thirty years later, this bias against women had not been remedied. Addressing the American Society for Me- chanical Engineers (ASME) at their 1949 meeting, Florence F. Buckland stated that American women would be likely to make significant contributions to engineering if faculty would occasionally \discuss the density of matter in terms of a bar of ... soap instead of a chunk of iron.\ Accord- ing to Buckland, \Physics courses are based on hammers and nails I:Uld puppy dogs' tails, and not on sugar and spice and everything nice,\ and, therefore, did not appeal to women students. She took on educators, saying, \They do not realize how interesting engineering can be to women if its fundamentals are ,presented from the feminine point of view ... Women who become engineers do so because of a deep interest in the phenomena of the physical world, or at least in the physical world that embodies th.eir experience. They are willing to learn whatever tech- niques are necessary, however presented, to understand that world.\ Discussion of gender bias in the examples used in tech- nical education has continued to the present time. Florence F. Buckland provided articu- late examples ofhowhighly technical work could be described in terms that were fa- miliar to the American public, particularly women. In an interview with Tile Milwau- kee Journal in 1948, she described her job at GE: \consultant on heat transfer and fluid flow problems .... My problems come from all over the company and I never know from one day to the next what is com- ing up .... In the back of my head at all times is my experience ... for the Buckland household. Having burned m@re than one cake, and hard boiled more than one soft boiJed egg, ... , blown a fait nUiilber of fuses and broken my share of jelly glasses while pouring hot jelly in, I have a pretty good idea ofthe basic lieattransfer and fluid flow problems. All I have to do is apply my home heat transfer experience and my ex- perience with water to hydrogen or silicon oils or some other fluid and I can usually manage to come up with an answer that is at least reasonable.\ If her outspoken opinions about the edu- cation of women place Florence F. Buckland ahead of her time, she made other statements that now seem outdated. In the same 1949 ASME talk, \Engineer- ing as a Profession for Women\ in which she challenged the engineering establish- ment to remove obstacles that hindered the education of women in engineering, Fogler stressed that women should place societal expectations before their careers, in order to avoid spinsterhood. \What about the run-of-the-mill lady, who has an interest in engineering but an even more pressing interest in the masculine expositor of these matters? Slie will always make the right choice if she puts her femininity first and her engineering second.\ This sentiment was used as the headline for an article pub- lished in a newspaper account of Buckland's talk. A firm believer that women in the engineering profession had Women in Engineering Colltributed by tile Bicentennial Committee 011 25 Years of Coeducation This fall, we celebrate the 25th anniver- sary of coeducation at Union College. In September of 1970, the College opened its doors to women as fully matriculated un- dergraduate students. However, it is im- portant to recognize that the College did educate some women prior to 1970, both in its undergraduate and graduate pro- grams. Indeed, the first woman to eam a degree from Union College was awarded a Masters· of Science in Electrical Engi- .neering (MSEE) in 1925, fully 45 years before women were admitted on an equal footing with men, and more than 50 years before Union would award that same de- gree to another woman. 1l1is is the first in a series of articles about Florence Fogler Buckland, Union's first woman graduate and a pioneering woman engineer. Florence Fogler was educated in the public high-school system in Billings, Montana. Having enjoyed courses in mathematics and the sciences, particularly physics, she decided to pursue a course of study in engineering. Her family was origi- nally from New England, and so she en- rolled at MIT, a university that has been admitting women to its undergraduate pro- gram since 1868, more than one hundred years longer than Union. Fogler was one of two women in her class; she received a bachelors degree in electrochemical engi- neering in 1920. After graduation, she went to work at General Electric Company in Schenectady, one of two women engi- neers employed there. While working in the turbine engineering department at GE, Fogler enrolled in Union's evening divi- sion program in electrical engineering and vector mathematics. She attended courses for two years, and submitted a thesis. In June of 1925, she was one of seven stu- dents awarded the MSEE degree at Union's commencement ceremony. The next day, she married Bruce 0. Buckland, who was also an engineer employed by GE. Fol- lowing her wedding, Florence Fogler Buckland continued for a short time to work at GE, then left the work force to raise a family. During World War II, Florence F. Buckland returned to work at GE. Her daughter, Joan B. Kitchens writes, \TI1ere's a wonderful story (possibly apocryphal) about her receiving her first paycheck as an engineer after returning to GE in 1942 to Ohelp with the war effort. . ... It is said that she stormed into DavidPriuce's office with it, tore it into little pieces, and dropped it on his desk as he looked on, speechless, and turned around and stalked out without uttering a word. Rumor has it among some lady GE executives that she was displeased that her paycheck was not the equivalent of her male colleagues. . .. Whether it re- sulted in policy change I cannot say.\ Af- ter the war, GE allowed Florence F. Buckland to work a part-time schedule (an early \flex-time\ arrangement) as heat transfer and fluid flow consultant in the General Engineering and Consulting Labo- ratory. In this way, she was able to con- tinue working outside of the home, but still arrive home before her children returned from school. In a 1948 article, she com- mented \However there are days when I become so involved and interested in my work . . . that I remain [at GE] the entire day.\ Florence F. Buckland was involved in professional societies and local civic ac- tivities. l11e third woman member of the American Society of Mechanical Engi- neers (ASME), she presented papers at several ASME meetings, and served as an officer of the ASME heat transfer division, and of the local ASME section. She was also a member of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, and\a Jicensed pro- fessional engineer. In 1956, she was awarded the Women's Badge of the Tau Beta Pi association, by the Massachusetts Beta Chapter at MIT. She served as presi- dent of the area League of Women Voters, and was active in local government reform. When Florence Fogler Buckland, Unimi's first woman graduate, retired from GE in October 1963 after a long and dis- tinguished engineering career, the College was still several years away from coedu- cation. the same opportunities for advancement as their male colleagues, Buckland stated that the woman engineer in industry is \only limited by her native abHity. If she makes the most of the opportunity, it will take fme men to woo her away from her profession, and that is what she deserves.\ This year, Union celebrates 150 years of engineering education. Florence Fogler was the first woman to receive an engi- neerinr; degree (indeed, any earned degree) from Union College. In the seventy ye&rs since that time, approximately 400 engi- neering degrees have been awarded by the College to women. Engineering enroll- ment data presented in the September 1995 issue of tlie Union College alumni maga- zine show that, during the past ten years, the percentage of engineering students who are women has fallen significantly. Dur- ing the 1984-85 academic year, 26% of en- gineering students on campus were women; in 1994-95, that figure had dropped to 17%. It is likely that Florence F. Buckland would have had some inter- esting comments to make about this trend, and suggestions for increasing the ·num- ber of women entering the engineering profession. -Infon11ation included in this article has been compiled from various newspaper articles on Florence Fogler Buckland, some provided by her daughter, Joan B.

Features The Concordiensis • September 2i, 1995 • Page 11 Clean Slate: Union's Freshmen Voice by RaqueiMillman Contributing Writer After a full summer of prepa- ration and goodbyes to lifelong companions, on September 4, 1995, the class of1999 began its journey to a brand new world called college. No one knew exactly what to expect no matter how many people they talked to. So they came with everything under the sun, from amplifying antennas to zodiac calendars. They moved in swiftl·y as though they needed to blend nonchalantly into the scene, somewhere knowing in the back of their minds that this place was now home forthe hext four years. This meant bidding farewell to the only home they've ever known, and their keepers (AKA parents). As scaiy as this may have seemed; after the unloaded car pulled away with an incom- plete family inside and the eyes stopped tearing, they began to realize that independence doesn't simply mean farewells, but rather several hellos. · How many people did you meet that very first day of college? Better yet, how many names can you remember? Do you remem- ber saying hello to absolutely ev- eryone even though you had never met before? How dizzy orientation was with all of the speakers, meetings, and still try- ing to find time to unpack mas- sive amounts of stuff into a not so massive room.

One of the interesting parts of this new living arrangement is the concept of a floor. Floor rules, floor gossip, floor friends, even floor bathrooms, all run by the leaders and advisors of the floor. The RA 's are the people who serve the floor somewhere be- tween a parental level and a law enforcement level. They came off incredibly strict with rules from 110 baking foods to no getting baked. Following all of these regulations, they told their respec- tive floors of ideas they had for activities centering around com- munity service. They have taken us under their wing and really bent over backwards to make sure that the class of 1999 feels at home. Another person that has been a tremendous asset to the average freshman is the member of the faculty known as the advisor. Trying to figure out the perfect schedule for the first term is not an easy task, but they have less- ened the agony and nervousness a great deal The first day of college begins not when you enter the gates, but rather when you enter your first class. How intimidating that first teacher seems! How knowledge- able! All of a sudden you remem- ber that getting into Union was nota simple process. At this time you vow that school work will always come first and that noth- ing under a4.0 will be acceptable. Then you remember thinking that in high school. Okay, so a 3.8 is alright too. After all is said and done and ygu are now on your way, the path may sometimes seem lonely, and then your roommate comes back after class. Sometimes he or she can be our only salvation from breaking down. You real- ize that just as you have done in kindergarden, high school, or even sleep away camp, you will now be making new friends. But somehow this seems different Who are the friends our parents most frequently speak of? Guar- anteed it's their friends from col- lege. We are fonning lifetime friendships here. On this beauti- ful landscape, we are creating our stories and memories for years to come. The feeling of developing these relationships is indescrib- able, but one phrase puts it into perspective: Welcome to the best time of your life. Welcome to Union College. Stress Belgian Style by Con or McKenzie Contributing Writer There are many stresses facing a college freshman. But none of them, not even class registration, scheduling your time, or meeting new people cancomparewith the taxing act of making Belgian waffles in West Dining hall. Ever since I ate my first break- fast at Union college (little more than five days ago) I have been drawn to this hands on waffle making process. Unfortunately, it's been an endless source of frustration for me. The first day I tried these waffles there was no 1 ine for either waffle maker and I was able to step right up and give it a shot (an event that I came to learn is quite rare). There I was scoop in hand, batter in front, and waffle maker to ei- ther side (absent from this picture was a set of directions). • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • I poured about two scoops into this cratered behemoth of an ap- pliance and closed the lid. After a while I guessed my wa:ffies were done. I opened the waffle maker to find my waffle split apart and hopelessly stuck to both sides. So, like any responsible diner in at WesH left my mess and moved onto the next waffle maker. Miraculously, I figured out that I neglected to spray grease all over the thing. To make a long story short next time I remem- bered to spray grease, but J ne- glected to flip the thing. After that miserably botched attempt I cooked a nearly perfectly browned Belgian waffle only to drop it into the batter. By 'that time 'f5.mimites had· passed and my companions had already finished their breakfast, so I grabbed a bagel and pro- ceeded out of west with my head hung in shame. After days of therapy and men- tal visualization I felt I was ready to try again. The day was Saturday and I did not encounter the same crowd less phenomena again. There was a person using each waffle maker, so I decided to get in line behind oneofthem. Anyway, after the girl in front of me set a beautiful pick and an- other girl came out of no where and placed herself between me and the waffle maker. I don't easily get bent out of shape and I didn't feel like being an asshole, so I let this incident pass. While I can be nice, I ·m not passive, so after this person drew near the completion of her waffle I prepared myself. Another friend appeared out of crowd with the dear intention of using this very waffle maker next. Well, I wasn't going to take that so I picked up the aerosol grease to express my clear intentions to use this waffle maker as well. She . ' ' . also picked up the aerosol grease, and when her friend moved out of the way, there we were in a Mexican standoff. She stuck the first blow, \I've been here like ten years longer than you, so get out of the way\ (I italicized the word \like\ to show the emphasis she placed on it). Bagels again. Yesterday I finally had a waffle and it was delicious. It still wor- ries me though that something that stressful is made available to freshmen. I was thinking; they don't let us go to the frats during orientation. So, my recommen- dation to the dining gods would be this: Don't put out the waffle machine until second semester. We're just not ready to deal with that kind of pressure this early in our college careers.

·Page 12 • September 21, 1995 • The Concordiensis Prehistory Of Union College ''Greek Sheep''------- byJeeves Features Columnist So maybe you're baffled. Perhaps you're wondering why some freak show is bothering to share this wacky pre-his- tory of the old Union, and why you should really want to know about it anyway. Most likely, though, you're above it all-you are at Union-and you simply don't care. Not that anyone should, Nott certainly didn't. Heh-heh ... Nott, by the way, died that night. Choked on sauerkraut, gave Hackle's a bad rep no matter who you asked, at least for a fortnight. I quit, anyway. Started Roping cows in Touloo, South Dakota, with Liz Phair. She got drunk one night and tried to convince me to screw one. Go figure. · Who would have thought that Eliphalet had a cousin named Epaull et? Really.,. but on the same level, Gogo!' s cousin, the one with dark plaits, had-wait, I'm off track. Sorry folks, I'm rambling; I fell in with some fermented cider after dinner. Broke the barrel, even. Notto worry, I managed to dig up a brieftale anyway. I found it floating with the dregs. By the by, I never did touch that cow, though Liz managed to tip it. Well, before things could heat up with Liz and I, she ran off to Canada with some dark-haired gent, and her girlfriend AJ.i convinced me to jet to New Zealand with her. I guess I 'In a sucker for nice girls with wide ~yes who dangle adventure in front of my face, among other things. Ali is tall and thin, dark haired, and she smells ofEs- cape. How 'bout that? So we went. Just sort of left. Then, at the loading ramp at Touloo Airstrip, I met{random) my high school lab partner, Janice Sloshkowski. Janice was wearing striped coveralls and still smelled faintly ofpoultry, which is as good as any cologne, I guess. Her eyes weren't so wide, which was fine except that she turned out to be the pilot. Oh, and I got to sit next to chickens. 1st class? My a**. Alas. New Zealand turned out to be particu- larly boring. After a week, I had learned several things. ( 1) that there are no cows in New Zealand, which doesn't make for much of a difference because instead, (2) there are sheep. In fact, (3) there are 21.4 sheep per capita, and most folks have at least one or two kicking around the yard. Additionally, (4) there's lots of grass, which is cool, because (5) walking through the grass can be a pretty good time, de- pending on who you're with and how high the grass is. The strangest encounter of the week, aside from the six-foot-high French-tickle- two-leaf we strolled through.(was that rolled?), which only grows in the south- westregion ofNew Zealand and ismighty soft and, aside from its height has ... wait, what was this sentence about? Mum,. oh, right. A most interesting place ... definitely, for sure ... Wickleban Hull's cottage. An ordinary looking abode, residence of an eclecticandrather silly-looking man, it had a three-story loft and parking for four sheep-or one sheep and a Range Rover. Incidentally, the plural of sheep is sheep, and Wickleban had a nice sky-gray 4x4 vehicle parked next to his favorite sheep, Maurice. Just another thing I learned .. Wickleban ran his cottage tight as any ship, shaped his mustache into ahorizon- tally erect worm, and said things like '~ehh there laddy\ and \saa:ve some \o thet po- tato piefurrmee, ehh.\ He wore sweaters made from his sheep. He was missing sev- eral teeth and had gray whiskers down past his ears. And he became thoroughly ex- cited when the topic of discussion tutned to his neighbor, Oklos, and in particular, Features this neighb<?r's sheep. \That pillferrin' theevin' Greek boy!\ Winkleban would exclaim. \His ~urrm-ed sheep arr eatin' all my grr,rass!\ And they were, because Winkleban did not believe in fences, though perhaps he should have. What Winkleban really needed would not be accomplished for another 71 years, by his great-great-nephew Roger no less. What do you suppose that was? Well, Roger didn't have too much trouble get- ting Greek_ boys to eat where he wanted them to, and he did not believe in fences either, though perhaps he should have. Quote: \Lord grant me the se- renity to accept the things I cannot change, ·the courage to cbange · the things I can, and the wisdam to hide the bod- ies of those people I had to kill because they . pissed me off.\ Last Sunday's Concert: Summer of Work? Union Deserves Better by Pete Sorenson Features Writer Lets talk about music. \Music is a lady whom I stiH love,\ said Cat Stevens. She still sleeps with me, you might add. Music is a good thing, I might add, an aestheti- cally pleasing application of wave physics. It's all about image, Daisy Fuentes might add; it's all about pleasure. In some contexts, MTV is all about music, which is OK except that it could follow that Beavis is all about it, too. Let's talk about Union. Well, alright, let's not. How about acoustics, then? How about the acoustics of music in our Memorial Fieldhouse? Or the lack thereof... Remember when you were in, like, sixth grade, and you got your first boom box? You stuck the Beasties in the cassette deck and cranked it...yup, that was the day you might well have learned about distortion, arid the bother of having it reverberate in your head for several hours. The point being, not all music gives that beautiful, free and peaceful ENERGY we want and expect, case in point; Sunday night. Ouch. Why did I mention Beavis before? I'm terribly sorry. Hmmm, maybe he can help me to illustrate a point. Hmmm, maybe not. FYI, the Underground Network hosted the show. They left soon after it started, which is roughly when I left. Remember Springfest last year? The year before? Now, an outdoor music festi- val on West Beach, featuring Reggae, Ska, Mr. Matthews, even Belly, herbal treats, smoking OK .. you get the point. C'mon, concert committee-who went to that show? The bulk of the audience was highschool kids, flannels on their waists, sporting their $18 bucks-a-pop Ticketmaster specials ... Our mature palate's deserve. otherwise. Atmosphere is key, ambiance is every- thing. Beavis might have really enjoyed Sunday's entertainment (there- I used it!), but evidently, precious few of us did. Make great Christmas $ in CT!

Secure your job today! by Mike Kluger Contributing Writer .. : ' ' > • • The National Health Care Syste1h term ' abroad extends to students a different op- portunity than most other Union programs abroad. This summer term abroad allows students to immerse themselves in not one culture, but three. The term abroad kicks off the day after graduation and ends the first week of August, providing any stu- dent the chance to compare the history 1 so- ciology, and philosophy of health care in four very different nations,. while also sneaking a peek into the culture, govern- ment, and social welfare of each nation. After a week of preparation in the good ol' U.S., the group travels to London, En- gland, for three weeks, followed by Utrecht, Holland, for two weeks and wind- ing up in Budapest, Hungary, for the last two weeks. Approximately twenty stu- dents are accepted to participate in this pro- gram, applying in January and finding out in mid-February. This term abroad is not just about sit- ting in a hot classroom five days a week all summer long while being lectured by a boring professor. Some of the physicians and professors teaching the courses are world famous such as Roy Porter, the most prominent British Historian and Medical Sociologist in England. In fact, most of the information supplied to the students comes from visits to hospitals, homes for the mentally disabled, general practitio- ners, geriatric centers, homes for the psy- chiatric impaired, and public health bu- reaus. This term abroad requires the stu- dent to enter these diverse health care fa- cilities and learn abouttheir theology, treat- ment, accessibility to citizens, cost, and function while comparing these aspects to the other nations visited. There is also classroom work, but it is minimal and used primarily to reinforce active visits. The light workload, one test and two essays, allows the student ample time for social activities and sight-seeing in the diffe~ent cities. Upon returning to the Unites States, the student has two months to complete a twelve page paper and a journal of their experiences. ~~; ~~i9-H~fqre, one ofthe m~jor,ajYa!l­ tages of this term abroad is that the stu- dent experiences three cultures in a ten week time frame. The social scene of the three countries varies immensely from what we are used to in the United States. London is all about pubbing until about ll :00 when all Pubs close, and if you are still in the mood to rage, clubs stay open until around 4:00a.m., playing the newest in European· techno. In the Netherlands, the rumors concerning marijuana use are true. The Heineken brewery offers a great beer drinking experience for close to noth- ing after a hot day ofclasses. In Budapest, clubs are the place to be where some of the most attraetive people you will ever see dance and party all night long. For those not interested in these social aspects, mu- seums, operas, theater, orchestral and jazz concerts, ballets, folklore festivals, cafes, city tours, and street entertainers offer the culture hungry students a feast of oppor- tunity. Still not interested? Try Hiking through mountains above the clouds, bik- ing along the coast past castles and wind- mills, trekking through caves, or swim- ming in waterfalls and lakes. With every weekend free and two five day travel breaks during the term, touring is no prob- lem. Perhaps another great academic advan- tages of a summer term abroad is that you get to take one term off before you gradu ate. Many students use this time to study for the LSAT, MCAT, GRE, do an intern ship, take extra classes of interest or to just relax at home. Also, since a two moth Eurorail pass (free train service within Eu rope) is included in the price of the term abroad, many students use the month be tween the end of the term and the begin ning of all term to travel through Europe with new found friends. If you are inter ested in a truly unique term abroad experi ence, contact William Thomas at the Terms Abroad office.

September 21, 199 5 PAGE 16 Dutchmen Defense Carries Union to Win by Ken Berman Sports Editor If ever a team was not prettty in a 44-0 lambasting of its oppo- nent it was your Union College Dutchmen this past Saturday at Frank Railey Field Sure, the defeNse allo\vt:d onlv I 07 total yards (iNcluding only 25 on the ground), and managed four inter- ceptions. A11d yes, you could not ask for a more dominating dis- play by your special teams, who saw freshman defensive back Justin Cambell block two punts. and so rile WPT punter Scott Theriault that he averaged only 14.2yardsoneach ofhis 10 (count em ') punts. However. it was the offense that for the sec- ond straight week displayed a stnking inability to drive the ball in for a score, or at least stay on the field longeneugh togive their defense a rest Union's has no choice but to hold onto hope that the1r young offense will come armind 1n time to complement their dcvastatrng defense The gam c · s tirst q uartcr was either an ugly offensive quarter. or a great defensive quarter, de- pending on how you look at it. What you can't argue is that there were only four first downs, and tliis tepbrter J:Jersbmtlly saw sl\ people popping Vi varin 's to stay awake. The second quarter saw Union squander two golden oppurtuntuieies to score. The offense was unable to move the ball after a fumble recovery on the WPI 24, and the ensuing field goal attempt' by Roger Egbert just missed. A Kevin Pessolano in- terception, returned to the Engineer's 3 1, also gave the Dutchmen a great oppurtunity to score, but a sack and an incom- Justin Campbell gets one of his two blocked punts, and he doesn't even need to dive. Meanwhile, Shuron Morton, #3 7, jumps for joy. (photo by Scott Druckemiller/ The Concordiensis) plete pass later, they were forced to punt. They were finally able to get cin tfie 6oard after Cambeil's first block (which was recovered by Pessolano ). Senior tailback Kojo Attah scored on a five yard run over left tackle, finishing off a 41 yard, 6 play drive. Egbert kicked the extra point to give his team a 7-0 lead, the only points they would need for the day. The score remained this way until the third, when Union put up 16 points to take control of the scoreboard. Campbell registered his second block of the day, on WPI's fourth play of their drive. The ensuing fumble recovery by fellow frosh Ken MacNeil gave Union the ball on the WPI six. The Dutch- men had to settle for a field goal, however, as their offensive in- abilities continued. Union made the score 17-0 on WPI's next possesion, when Kevin Pessolano picked off a pass and returned it 26 yards for the defensive touchdown. Union put together their finest drive of the day later on in the period, when they moved the ball 45 yards in eleven plays, capped off by Attah's second score of the day, this time a one yard plunge. Union's defense again set up their offense, as Cambell picked off a third down pass and returned it 29 yards to the WPI six. Three plays later, sophomore quarterback Kevin Smith connected with jun- ior wideout Jim Manning for a five yard touchdown strike. Later touchdowns were scored by sophomore tailbacks George Tiggle and Joseph Latella. Union will look to improve to 2-l on Saturday against Hobart. If they succeed, it will be their 14th consecutive win in their se- ries, which dates back to 1896. Hobart is currently 0-2, after losses to two ranked teams, dickinson and St. John Fisher. Hobart has allowed 389 rushing yards in these two games (to go with 213 passing), which means Union should be able to break out of it's offensive slumber, and be- gin to play closer to the way it's. defense is. If the offense comes around this season, and the de- fense continues to stop opponents, this team is capable of making a playoff run. But those are big ifs. Field Hockey Sinks Wells The 'Vomen's Lacrosse team is looking for -new players. All wo;men (novices included) are welcome. Anyone interested should contact Coach Charlyn Roberts at x6040 by Jon Gasthalter Contributing Writer The Field Hockey Dutch women opened the week of competition with a one-and-one record, having beaten Rochester and lost to William Smith. Union finished up their three-game road trip with a 4-2 loss to Hamilton College on Wednesday, Septem- ber 13. TonyaCapparello netted both goals in the loss. \We played really well, it's just that every time they had a corner, they scored. We are pretty evenly matched, so we knew it was go- ing to be a good gatne. It just did not go our way, but we were not disappointed with the game at all,\ said Co-Captain Katie Richardson. The Dutchwomen 's home de- but came on Saturday, as Wells College came to Frank Bailey Field. In front of a familiar crowd, on this beautiful early autumn day, the Dutchwomen, eager to return home after their tough road trip, came out with one word in their mind--offense. Union opened the game with an intense offensive burst, putting pressure on a sur- prised Wells team. Capparello capped off the effort,. redirecting a Stefanie Speanburg pass from just outside of the Wells goal. Five minutes later, Junior Christina Jabbur redirected a loose ball to make the score 2-0. Union kept up its intense offensive attack and almost broke the game open ten minutes into the half,~shooting the ball just wide of the net twice. A few minutes later, on a corner, Union tallied for the third time. This time it was Richardson send- ing the ball to Shoko Okado, who set up Jab bur for her second goal of the gatne. Union controlled the first half entirely, not allowing Wells a shot on goal and taking 3 l shots on an overworked goaltender. The second half was no differ- ent. Union kept up its unrelent- ing offensive attack on the tired Wells defense. Jabbur scored the only goal of the half, on a cross in front of the goal mouth, to complete the hat trick and make the score 4-0. Union took 59 shots on goal and did not allow a shot on goaltenders Elana Goldberg and Rachael Rothschild. Co-Captain Michelle McCarte commented, \We sus- tained an attack for a full seventy minutes, which is really good for our team. We never really had to play defense on them, because we were so strong on attack.\ The team plays Tuesday at Albany and then returns home for a seven-game home stand beginning September 22 against Rensselaer.

l I ~ ; ' ' ... . ... our or t£U5t5 The Student Newspaper of Union College Since 1877 Volume CXXV,.Nu.mber III An Inside Look at The National Enquirer by Omar AI-Khalidi News Staff Brian Williams, General Editor of the Nationa/Enquirer, will be giving a 60-minute, multi-media presentation at Union that Will take his audience behind the scenes of the Naliona/ Enquirer. The presentation will employ slides, v.ideo projection, and hu- morous anecdotes about the Rich and Famous. Jn an age when many reporters, including Will- iams, root through celebrity gar- bage, hire helicopters, pay sources large sums of money, and travel the world over for a single story, Mr. Williams' presentation promises to be entertaining. The presentation is being promoted by Lordly & Dame, Inc.~ and will be held in Memorial Chapel at8 PM onOctober 11, 1995. Admission is free. plained that \pub! ic figures have public relations finns whosejob it is' to get their names in the pa- per. Working within the law, (the National Enquirer) gets the sto- ries \ In other words, public fig'\ ures are not living private lives to begin with; they are actually pay~ ing people to help them pub! icize their lives. When asked how the Enquirer deals with criticism of their use of freedom of the press, as many media organizations have to, Williams answered that \the National Enquirer services over 20 million readers. (Our readers) want the story and they like what they are getting.\ Or, in the words of the old cliche, \if it isn't broken, don't fix it\ Schenectady, New York September 28, I 995 In an interv·iew with Williams, it was possible to discover more about the mentality of the Na- tional Enquirer in order to be bet- ter equipped to understand the up- coming presentation. Mr. Will- iams said that the central focus of his presentation will be to take his audience inside the workings of the Enquirer. As the basic human right to privacy often conflicts with the freedom of speech be- stowed upon editors by the first Amendment to the Constitution, Williams was asked to comment on his philosophy of privacy. How far is too far? Williams ex- When asked to respond to sto .. ries ofsideshow-attraction qual- ity or unbelievable feats, Will-. iams said that \most people who question these stories have- not read the Nationa,I Enquirer re- cimtly, lfataiJ:Whendea1irtgwil:h human interest stories, extraordi- nary accounts of individuals makes good news. It is not as in- teresting to publish stories about ordinary individuals.\ When put on the spot to name the most out- rageous story he has ever covered, Williams recalled the Michael Jackson/Lisa Marie Presley wed- ding. Williams said that \even though I saw the judge and the official marriage certificate, I still could not believe that it was le- gitimate.\ Autumn is on the way! (photo by Rick Lederer exclusively for The Concordiensis) Finally, to obtain insight about the brains of the operation, Will- iams was asked \what detennines whether or not a story has poten- tial and where do you get your leads from?\ Basically, these questions depend on many vari- ables but boil dovm to one thing: the source. Williams said, \The National Enquirer has three types of sources. First, we have a worldwide network of people and many connections in Hollywood and New York. Secondly, our readers and tipsters send in many of our leads. Lastly, theNational Enquirer has many of its own re- porters. Altogether, we have a lot of people all over the world work- ing for us.\ Professor Board: A Leader in Union's Coeducation by Adrian MacLean News Staff After 175 years, Union made the decision to become coeduca- tional under the leadership of President Harold C. Martin. Pro- fessor Joseph Board of the Politi- cal Science department and mem- ber of the Committee to Study the Future ofUnion College, felt that coeducation came at the right time for Union. Board studied and taught at the Indiana Univer- sity, and he also taught at Cornell College in Iowa. Both of these institutions were coeducationaL When coeducation became the forefront of discJ,Ission, President Martin ·appointed Board to the committee. He had a fresh per- spective, having only been at Union for a year and a half. ''The Martin years at Union were very exciting years. You really had the feeling that you were part of an institution on the march. President Martin pro- vided· enlightened leadership at Union,\ Board said. In 1967, the committee re- port~d and recomn:ended coedu- cation for Union. According to Board, this was the first official advocacy for coeducation. June 23, 1968, a committee of co-edu- cation was created to form the gro.und work to admitting women. Professor Nemyer, a. former inember of the English ·Department, . was made chair of the committee. Board remembers some of the concerns that arose in the meet- ings- many seeming ridiculous. There were even concerns as fo whether or not women would be as good as men. Most of the ob- jections came from trustees and students because they felt a loy- alty to preserve tradition. \I remember an argument about whether or not there would be enough restrooms for men and women.\ Board said, \One trustee said 'Union would go coeduca- tional over my dead body'.\ Union's peers were also deal- ing with coeducation issues. Prinl'eton had just rejected a re- quest to become coeducational, and they sent a representative to Union facilitate discussion. Princeton did eventually decide to go coeducational around the same time as Union. \The 1960's and 70's were a time of social change in America in general, but there was a move- ment to re-examine social insti- tutions and single sex schooling was one,\ Board said. Once women arrived at Union they certainly blazed a trail. The first graduating class with women had a female valedictorian. Paula Maras transferred after two years at Cornell University. Her Father had been the football coach, worked for admissions, and was the head of financial aid. According to Board, the de- meanor of students changed when women arrived. Women had good verbal skills and wrote well, and this seemed to push the men. Board remembered that men were concerned prior to coeducation that women would be inhibiting their behaviors and change the social scene at Union. If Mr. Williams's presentation strikes your fancy, or you are un- able to attend due to extenuating circumstances, the National Enquirer is currently being filmed for a story by NBC's Nightline. Keep an eye open for it sometime in the near future.

· Page 4 • September 28, 1995 • The Concordiensis The Secret Service Protects the World by Matt Sandler World News Editor One hundred and fortyofthemost im- portant world leaders will be arriving for several' weeks to attend various United Na- tions meetings in New York in celebration of that organization's 50th anniversary. The Department of the Treasury and the city ofNew York are refining detailed plans to protect all these important people. Secret Service and Federal Bureau oflnvestiga- tion agents will be working exhausting eighteen hour days .. Other agencies asso- ciated with the Treasury Department are also involved in protection detail, includ- ing the Internal Revenue Service, the Cus- toms :Bureau, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which is slotted to provide bodyguards. There is a massive reallocation of manpower as Secret Ser- vice Agents are being transferred to New York for this protection assignment. Over J,OOOFederal employees and about5,0.00 New York City police officers are to take part in providing security. \Any time you have one hundred heads of state occupy- ing a geographic area you can put a post- age stamp over on a map, it's a rational concem,\said James K. Kallstrom, theas- sistantdirector in charge of the Federal Bu- reau oflnvestigation in New York City. Police will be positioned on rooftops and there will be motorcades with anned escorts who will be visible. In addition, some sections will be cordoned off to all traffic at certain times during Pope John Paul II's visit. There will be tight security screens with government-issued identifi- cation cards which will admit people into the area; once a person leaves that area they are barred from re:.entering. Police heli- copters will monitor the air situation, and in all likelihood will follow the motor- cades. The Coast Guard will be on in- creased alert to watch the harbor. Navy Sea Air and Land Commandos, SEALs, will probably be used to inspect the hulls of ships and to deal with other maritime security measures. Anny explosive experts will also be used to certify that the build- ings are secure.

The Republican Corner by Marc Foster · WorldNewsStaff In 1988, President Reagan signed the F amity Support Act, a measure that sought to reduce the number of Americans depen- dent on government programs like Aid to Familie,s with. Depertdent Children (AFDC). Seven years later, only 1 I% of the 4.6 million parents of AFDC partici- pate monthly in any oft4e education, train- ing, or job search programs set up by the Family Support Act. Republicans on Capi- tol Hill are proposing fundamentalchanges to the welfare machine. Representatives in Congress have pro- posed that welfare be administered by the states in a manner consistent with the states' individual welfare needs. For the Federal government to devise a one-size- fits-all welfare program for the states would be foolhardy. The states are better able to handle the job than Washington. The social welfare system envisioned by Johnson's \Great Society\ has cost Ameri- cans $5 trillion since 1965. In addition, it is difficult, if not impossible, to discern what we've gained. Among long-term re- cipients, 68% didnot graduate from high school, 39% had no work experience in the previous year, 40% have three or more children, and 67% have never married (De- partment ofHealth and Human Services). The average adult on welfare has eighth grade reading and math skills, and one .. half of AFDC mothers score below the eigh- teenth percentile for all women. One-third ofthose who live on public assistance can- not read a street map or fill out a social security card application. Sixteen percent of welfare mothers have substance abuse problems. Reforms will attack at least some ofthe symptoms of ournation 's wel- fare ills. The House GOP members have proposed that by 2001, 1.5 million AFDC recipients (29%) will work-60 times the number working today. By 2003, one-half of AFDC recipients will be required to work 35 hours per week. The GOP proposals recognize the need for education and training; that without them, the government is aiding and abet- ting poverty in America, disfranchising the needy while augmenting their dependence on the government. The reform proposals come at a time when Americans feel that their generosity has been exploited. Where they should have pride in the social welfare system they have paid into in order to improve the lives of mill ions of others, Americans instead feel resentful that they've fulfilled their obligation to the system. They feel that the system has failed them and those it was supposed to help. Ultimately, the Repub- lican Party holds the same concerns. First, welfare should be a system that does not unduly burden the American taxpayers nor unfairly deny the needs of those whom it intends to help. Second, an individual, not government, is responsible for his or her own successes and failures. After all, there is a reason why welfare is not included in the Bill ofRights- it isn'tone. c;Ctl) J)Ef .. IVI~IlS (~AJ .. J .. : :JIIU •(j5Li5

Conversely, regular physical activity can improve longevity, even for those with BMis in the \overweight\ range.\ source: N Engl J Med 1995;333 :677-85,723-24. There is much confusion and debate .in regard to the true na- ture-of-the relationship between weight.and longevity.

We have also been educated about the risk of being to thin, as the bodies of women and men who starve themselves pile up around us, and as new studies emerge that r.eport that thin people have a higher mor- tality rate.

Mortality among obese women(BMI greater than 29) was more that twice that of the leanest women. Although mortality did not increase until BMI reached 27, the researchers did find trends that indicated in- creased risk for cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease and cancer beginning with lion women and 26 million men (one third of the US population) are overweight (weigh at least 20% more than \desirable\), this study seems to be a call to arms, or at least a call to stainnasters for several of us. This may not be so. The Harvard study is only the newest in a slew of studies looking at the relationship be- tween weight and obesity. Other studies have found that mortal- ity also depends on distribution The giant panda, symbol of international conservation efforts, continues its fight for survival.

Of the 700 species of bamboo, pandas seem to prefer arrow bamboo. which grows at higher altitudes, and umbrella bamboo, which grows at lower altitudes. • About every 40 years, bamboo has a mass die- off. The bamboo plants flower at the same time, disperse theirs·eeds and die. During past die-offs, pandas would move to an area where bamboo was flourishing. Pushed into wildlife preserves by China's expanding farms and cities pandas have nowhere to go when bamboo d1es. II The panda's short intestine is best suited to digesting meat, so pandas do not digest bamboo very well and must eat enormous amount of it to survive. A grown panda may eat 85 lbs. daily.

' Page 6 • September 28, 1995 • The Concordiensis ·Science and Medicine · Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Getting Into Medical School, but Were Afraid to Ask: An Interview with Carol Weisse, Pre ... medical Advisor by Dennis Popeo Science & Medicine Editor \This is the worst year in the history of medicine to apply to medical school.\ This single quote from Dr. Carol Weisse strikes a mixture of fear and de- spair into the hearts of several people on the Union College campus. Unfortunately, it is en- tirely true. In 1995, the number of students applying to our nation's medical schools reached an all time high. Albany Medi- cal College alone has already re- ceived 10,000 applicants for ap- proximately 80 spots in the Class of 2000. The sad fact is that ac- ceptance notices will only be mailed to three percent of the 10,000 applicants. The Under- graduate Health Professions Pro- gram at Union College is here to help Union students be a part of that \three percent accepted\ at Albany Med. alld other medical schools across the country. The Program has been re- vamped this year, with the retire- ment of Dr. Willard Roth, the Pre-Health Advisor at Union for the past 30 years ... The position of Pre-Health Advisor is now held by Dr. Carol Weisse ofthe Psychology Department. Dr Weisse has her Ph.D. in Health Psychology and attended Armed Services Medical School as part of her Ph.D training, so she is quite familiar with the pressures of life in med. school. She is the Pre-health advisor for all seven- year-meds, and all juniors and seniors applying to medical, den- tal, podiatry, optometry and vet- erinary medical schools. Profes- sor Karen Williams is acting as a Health Programs Counsellor, and Pre-health advisor to first year students and sophomores, and also all students interested in the allied health professions, includ- ing physical/occupational therapy, genetic counseling and physician's assistant programs. The team is rounded out by Mrs. Kathleen Hopper, who is the over-worked, but always smiling, secretary of the program. I have known these ladies for quite some time since I am in the middle of the worst part of the medical school application pro- cess - waiting to hear from schools. I spoke to Dr. Weisse one afternoon, and she informed me that several students have sev- eral similar questions about medical school. This brief article is meant to answer all your ques- tions about the medical school application process. \I hate to say that (this is the worst year in the history of medi- cine to apply to medical school) to people. The purpose of my tell- ing them this not to discourage people from applying to medical school. It's to give individuals proper information so that they can realistically assess whether this is something they want to do. The worst thing that I have to deal with now, in this position, is all the rejections. I'm handling everybody from last year who didn't get in and is reapplying this year, who didn't have a back.., up plan,\ said Weisse. Dr. Weisse does have some sug- gestions that can help people get into medical school. \The five things that medical schools look at that determine whether or not you get into medical school are, in order of importance: 1) MCAT scores. \In the past, the MCA T has not been used (as a c~t-oft) as it is being used to- day because there haven't been this many applicants. In the past, ifthe MCAT was a little low, the skills in reading comprehension, Biology, Physics, General and Organic Chemistry and Writing. It is broken into four sections, a Physical Sciences 'Section which is 50% General Chemistry and SO% Physics, a Biological Sci- ences section comprised of 60% Biology and 40% Organic Chem- istry, a Verbal Reasoning section comprised of reading comprehen- sion,. and a Writing Sample in which you are given an hour to write two essays on provided statements. The categories are scored numerically 1-15, with fif- teen as the highest, except for the writing sample which is scored alphabetically on a scale from J to T. The numerical scores of age, and that's not going to get you into medical school.\ The tests are given in April and Au- gust, although it is. commonly preferred that students take the test in April. That way, scores are given to the schools early, and the students have time to prepare themselves to take the test in Au- gust if they need to. There are also several commercial Prep courses for the MCA T, and stu- dents often wonder if they should take one. Dr. Weisse suggests that: ''If you are a self-motivated person, and you can study on your own, and standardized tests don't scare you, and you did fairly well on your SATs, I don't think you need apreparation course for the Medical School Applicants vs New Entrants from AAMC Data of last 35 Years 3 2.5 2 (IJ - c C'Cl a.. ... c w :: (l) 1.5 z - (IJ - c C'Cl (.) c. c. <C 1 0.5 0 1959 1964 1969 1974 1979 1984 1989 1994 Year Starting Medical School As you can see from the graph, this is indeed a time in which it is very difficult to gain admission to medical schools. When the shaded bar is very tall, the chances for a person gaining admission is lowered. The year 1994 was considered the hard-. est year to gain admission since the early seventies. The number of applications received in 1995 has already surpassed 1994 numbers. (All Graphics courtesy of the American Association of Medical CoUeges) other things on the list could pull each of the sections are totaled MCAT.\ you in for an interview. Now, and can range between 3 and 45. 2) GPA. \They (medical Admissions folks don't have the The mean MCA T scores for stu- schools) are still using GPA as a time to .look at all the applicants, dents are on the rise (see \Ma- screening mechanism. and many so the best screening devise is triculating Student Trends\ be- 'places are using a 3.5 out of 4 as MCAT score because it's stan- low).

'\I don't like to say that the third category is extracurricular a:ctivi- ties because then students inter- pret that as meaning; 'I play vol- leyball and am a member of other clubs.' Those things are impor- tant, but it is more important to be a leader in a fraternity. Also, it is important that you ;leave the Union College gates and get in- volved with the community as a volunteer.\ Dr. Weisse admits that many students are unsure where to volunteer. The Program is compiling a list of possible choices for students new. She does admit that volunteering, or participating in internships is looked upon more favorably by admissions committees if it is not used for course credit, but only for the experience. 4) Clinical Background- is nearly the same thing as category three, but this deals with specific, career related experience. For instance, have you had an intern- ship at a hospital, or were you able to \shadow\( follow around) a physician. \Our goal for the Health Professions Office this year is to try to make it a lot easier for people to get clinical experi- ence and community service. I would I ike to see students taking more initiative on their own. Why do I have to go and say «Here is Annie Schaffer's num- ber (a local Nursing home), call them to volunteer.\ 5) Faculty Recommenda- tions. Perspective medical stu- dents arc asked by the Pre-medi- cal Committee to submit several faculty recommendations to the Committee. These letters, along with the thoughts and recommen- dations of the members of the Pre-Medical Committee (who in- clude Dr. Weisse, Professors Karen Williams, Les Hull, George Smith, Twitty Styles, Bill Thomas and Dean Bradley Lewis) are pooled and a single recommendation letter is pro- duced and sent to Medical Schools. \The reason that we even have a Pre-Medical Com- mittee is because a person can- not get into medical school alone. You can go to graduate school or law school without any body's help, but medical schools require applicants to be reviewed by some sort of Pre-Health Committee that will compose some sort of com- posite letter that overviews .infor- mation received from interviews ofthe students and faculty input. Without this, many schools refuse to consider an applicant. The composite letter that I write is a letter in which I quote faculty , and if a student never got to know anybody, and they didn't shine academi·cally so that somebody noticed them, that letter will not say a lot.\ Dr; Weisse did men- tion that it is important to become

This is why Union's statistics of the amount of students that gain application to medical school from Union is not as high as other schools. The integrity and credibility of the Committee js retained, however, because, at times, the Committee will write a composite letter that will notrecommend a candidate. Thus, Union has a very good reputation for being truthful to medical schools in their ranking of students for recommendation. As you can see, the average GPA and MCAT scores of those entering medi- cal schools have steadily increased since 1991. Students should use these standards to gage their chances of gaining admission to a medical school. \If a student is sitting with me and asking \how do 1 get into medical school?' my advise is based upon these five categories. There is also specific advise that Dr. Weissecangivetopeoplewho want to. go to medical school and are sort of confused about what to do when. Below is a brief syn- opsis of what Dr. Weisse feels you should be doing, and what sev- eral of my friends and I (people going through the application process right now) feel is impor- tant to mention, broken down by class. FRESHMAN: \Don't do what most students are doing, which is commg to me saying that they screwed up their freshman year. If you .screw up yourGPA freshman year, you will never pull it up. You can do something about GPA: you can stop partying so much and start hitting the books and get help when you need it.\ It is also im- portant to start to gain commu- nity service experience or clini- cal experience, but only if it will not compromise your GPA. '\If you are a freshman, you should flip through the yellow pages and call places and see if they are open to you doing an internship. One thing medical schools would love to see in a recommendation letter is that a person took the ini- tiative and didn't sit around say- ing 'nobody told me about that.' That is quite frankly what a lot of juniors and seniors are saying to me. It is also important to get known by facultY members.\ SOPHOMORES: Get involved in organizations and activities without compro- mising your GPA Remember, \Geology Energy, and the Environment\ The New York State Geological Survey and The Geology Department at Union College announce: GEOLOGIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, and GEOENGINEERING FIELD TRIPS October 13-15, 1995 67th Annual meeting of the New York State Geoiogical As~ocialion leadership and experience for the . sake of experience are very im- portant things to look for in se- lecting an internship or commu- nity involvement. It is also im- portant to do things that you like to do. If you are in a club only because you think it will look good on an application, you should find another club, or take initiative and start one. JUNIORS: If you want to attend to medi- cal school beginning in the fall after you graduate, you should begin to pull together all the in- formation that you will need to begin applying to medical school. Register to take the MCATand get your hands on the AMCAS or other appropriate application. You should see Kathy Hopper in the Undergraduate Dean's Office (in Science and Engineering) and have a file started. You will re- ceive some questionnaires and blank faculty recommendation UNION COLLEGE Career Development Center forms. Inwintertenn, you should consider the MCA Tin April and hand out faculty recommenda- tions. In spring term all candi- dates will be interviewed by Dr. Weisse and another Committee member (one is assigned to you). After all are interviewed, the Committee convenes and begins to discuss all applicants in detail. Then the student must submit a list of schools where the letter should be sent. The composite letter is then written and mailed to the medical schools on your I ist. You should fill out the AMCAS (the common applica- tion that can be used for the ma- jority of medical schools) and send it in. You should also make sure that all your \pre-med\ courses are complete. These in- clude BIO: 16, 18, 24, 26~ CHEM: 10, 12, 30, 32~ PHYS- ICS. 15 and 16 or 17 and 18; Freshman Preceptorial and an- other English class. Medical schools also like to see a few math courses, and behavioral science courses. You should also take care of any secondary applica- tions as soon as you receive them. It is also wise to seriously con- sider a \back up\ plan, in case you don't get into medical school. SENIOR: By the senior year, you should have all applications and second- ary applications in. You will soon receive letters telling you if you have received an interview, are on \hold\ (it is just the same as being on the phone on hold- nt:r- vous waiting) or are flat out re- jected. Good Luck. Dr. Weisse would like to men- tion that if anyone has que~tions, they should write her a brief note on e-mail (please note the word \brief').

EDITORIAL · ·· ' Food For Thought Disconnected Editorial Reflections -Why do more than half of the tables in Upperclass tilt and move when you rest your tray on them? -Why do people talk as if there were a hierarchy among the divisions of the College? -The US News and World Report college rankings recently appeared, and Union hasn't budged from \quartile one\ (the 26th-35th ranked institutions) to win a place among the nation's top twenty-five colleges. We were also on their B-list in '93-'94 and '94-'95. That's the bad news. Turns out that from another point of view, however, Union is maintaining a higher profile. Statistics in The Chronicle of Higher Education for September 29, 1995 show that in '93~'94 President Hull, at a whopping $17 4, 4 23, was the ninth highest paid among the presidents of that year's top thirty-five colleges--in fact, he made more than the presidents of twenty of the nation's top twenty-five. (The '93-'94 figures are the most recent available.) It is interesting that in these uoubled times such A-list colleges as the following are able to get away with paying their presidents a paltry sum by Union standards: Swarthmore (165G), Wellesley (1280), Bowdoin ( 1700), Haverford (157G), Middlebury {1380), Smith (158G), Carleton (1420), Vassar(l7lG), Bryn Mawr (1470), Grinnell (170G), Oberlin (165G). That's one way to beat the competition! -Why can't the college community understand thattheeditorials printed in The Concordiensis reflectthe opinion of a majority of the Editorial Board, which consists of all section editors and the editor-in-chief, and not one member in particular? Why can't they understand that any opinion columns reflect the opinion of the writer and not necessarily the opinions ofthe staff? Why can't they also understand that letters to the editor do not necessarily (indeed seldqrn) reflect the opinions of the Editorial Board? .._ .

Now I'm cruising along on the superhighway. I may have gotten car sick a couple times so far, but it's been worth it. It's also been somewhat addictive. I had to tear myself away just so I can write this column. If this turns out to be shorter than usual, you will all know why. I realize this probably isn't the first or last time that you've heard this, but GET ON THE NET. It is absolutely nothing less than amazing. If you don't have the seventy dollars it costs to get con- nected, sell something! If you don't have a computer, there is a computer in the \Reamer Cam- pus Center\ (college center to us) that will allow you to access the Internet. I've been looking around, and there is some really cool and fun stuff out there. There is a place to view sports scores, and to find out anything you could every possi- bly want to know about any team or player. There is a news site, which allows you to actually find out what's going on in the out- side world, once in a while .. I even found a place where I could get actual live Rolling Stones au- dio. I could go on and on, but in short if it exists and its cool, it's · on the Internet. Basically , there is something for everyone and every taste out there, and best of all, while you're a student, it's free. The Internet is also a tremen- dous tool for learning. We have been using it in my Japanese class to contact sites in Japan and gather information about Japa- nese politics. Basically, the Internet can be used to research almost any topic in any class. I don't know about you, but I will not miss the library one bit. Aside from the advantages of getting on the net, think of the disadvantages of not being on the Internet. In the very near future, most courses will require you to do at least some work over the computer, either through e-mail or the Net. Those adept at using the Internet will be have a big advantage over those struggling to learn in the middle of a home- work assignment. Once you leave school, knowl- edge of the Net, and of comput- ers in general, will be a tremen- dous asset in a job search. Not only can you actually gather in- formation about jobs over the net, but your knowledge of com- puters will make you a more valu- able commodity within the job market. So l finally wrote an entire col- umn without complaining once. And they said it couldn't be done. Well, actually it can't. THE LINES AT UP PERC LASS ARE TOO LONG. Anyway, get on the net, you'll learn, you'll laugh, you 'II cry, but most importantly you will have fun. Buy all link-up equipment necessary from the Union College Bookstore now and arrange an appointment with the Office of Computer Services at x6293, so they can enstall -the program.

OP/ED The Concordiensis · September 28, 1995 · Page 9 · LETTERS . . In Defense of Student Activities To the Editor, I am writing in response to the Editorial in the September 21; : ·, . I' 1995 editi_on ofthe Cm'lcordien- sis. entitled ·~campus Events.Need ' - . . ~ ~ ' _· . . ' . Improvement.\ While reading t4e article· I kept thinking, \if those who complainedhadbatheredto ' 'cmne up to the student activities office to get the facts, they wou'ld never have written Jhis article.\ They made many judgments based on incorrect information. This letter might help to cleat things up. From the day we were elected into office through the summer and into the first couple weeks of school, we (the Student Forum, the Concert Committee, the Speaker's Forum, Chet's, the So- cial Committee .... every single club and committee on campus) have been working our tails off to start this year off with a bang. And-1 personally think that it has been a great success. For starters, concert committee co-chairs Matt Finkelst~in and Scott Mogelof spent much of their summers con- tacting agents, locating bands, working on publicity etc ... They have been inandoutofmeetings and the student activities office. They traveled to other campuses to post publicity, they worked with WDREand wrote ads for the Gaz.ette. They put ina tremendous amount of work with little help from other students. They went through a list ofbands and most of them weren't touring in the fall, were already booked, were too expensive, or were not available on the one date (a Sunday night) Union could provide a venue. The point made about tuition at Union is completely irrelevant. Student activity fees have nothing to do with tuition. They haveto do with how many students are enrolled. SUNY campuses can bring in big- ger bands because they have thou- sands of students. paying student activity fees and offer venues large enough to host the kind of \big name\ bands mentioned. The reason the fieldhouse was chosen was because we were hop- ing for a larger crowd to help re- coup the cost of the concert and, potentially, be able to .present more offerings this year than has ever been done in the past. The only other venue was Memorial Chapel. When we present there, people complain that it's too much like a church, you can't dance around because of the pews, etc. We are also required by the school to maintain a low sound level due to the structural peculiarities .of the historical building. That Sunday night was the only night that Union College could offer a venue of over 939 seats. In the future we will try to hold the concert on a Friday or Saturday night and we'lllook into starting it earlier. As Vice-President ofCampus Life I began my duties the day I was elected. 1 was in the student activities office racking my brain to come up with events that would be entertaining and would attract the students on this campus. We came up with FallFest, similar to Springfest I spent a large portion of my summer working on this upcoming event. But I guess cer- tain members of the editorial board haven't heard of it because they haven't bothered toattenda social committee meeting, check the many advertisements that have been posted, or even con- tacted me to see what I'm up to.

Why does the college tol- erate this type of behavior? During the Spring term of the 93-94 academic year, the multicultural affairs group drafted a Code of Ethics together with a set of recommendations to the President. The code was sent to the Faculty executive committee who supported the adoption of such a code. Hull and several members of the administration were reluctant to adopt the code formally, opining that,' the issues raised by the proposed code were existing College publications. Consequently, I presume, they are part of college policy. If so, why is nothing being done to enforce the policy? I feel it is time that we formally adopt the followingCodeofEth- ics, articulate it(as expressed) in our publications and develop mechanisms to vigorously en- force it.

Page 10 • The Concordlensis EJ Achtner The position of Junior Trustee is perhaps one of the most important positions that a student at Union College can hold. It is a two-year position on the schools Board of Trustee's, the most powerful administrative and governing body here at the school. It is the Board of Trustee's which decides the future of our great institution. Therefore, you owe it to yourself to elect an indi- vidual who completely under- stands the ramifications and re- sponsibilities of such a posi- tion. In essence, someone you can trust. In the past week, many of you have probably seen signs around campus stating my po- litical platform per say, \No Slo- gans, No BS, Just a Job Well Done.\ My reasoning for this statement is simple; I believe a candidate should be elected on the on the basis of their merits and capabilities, not empty rhetoric and unattainable prom- ises. Last year, I was equally as frustrated as many of you were because I felt there was a seri- ous lack ofcommunication be- tween the student body and the Student Fot:Um. Like you, I felt that in many cases the student government was out of touch with the student body. There- fore, two things I will promise you is accessibility and a can- did look at the issues. Those who know me know I speak my mifld and carefully consider all options. Ifelected, I will bring this mindset along with me. In my opinion, the nature of the position calls for an individual who can weigh many options, yet at the same time, be deci- sive. Youwon'thavetoworry about me catering to the wishes of the Board, for in the end, I must explain my actions to those who elected me.. In the past two-odd years I have been here, I have heard close to nothing about the activities of the Board. If elected, I will work to improve methods of communi- cation (i.e. A dedicated e-mail and voice mail address), so that you feel as if you are well in- formed about my activities, as well as those ofthe Board. If elected I will work to make sure that the link between the admin- istration and the student body is strengthened. Be wary of those who promise drastic change, in many cases it is sim- ply not feasible. These are things that I can and will do if elected, but I can only do it with you help. Please support me as Junior Trustee and together we can lead this great school into the next century with pride and dignity.

Simply by reading this page, you prove that Union students are not all apathetic and disin- terested with the state of our institution. My name is Jesse Karotkin and I hope to serve you as Junior Trustee. In as few words as possible, I would like to present a clear view of who I am and what I stand. for. I assure you that the ability to write \Junior Trustee\\ on my first job application is not a motivating factor for me to seek this position. This office is one which would allow me to repre- sent the interests of my fellow students. I intend to bring about positive changes on cam- pus. Union College has af- forded me many opportunities Diana Sedita A Junior Trustee acts as a li- aison between the Board of Trustees and the Student Fo- rum. Basically. the student trustees make sure that the stu- dents ofUnion College are fairly represented and that the trust- ees know the true feelings and opinions of the College commu- nity. I feel I am the right person for the job because I will push for greater student involvement in the decision making process at Union. I will make absolutely sure that all of your opinions and concerns will be relayed to the Trustees or the appropriate \powers that be. 1 ' As editor-in-chief of The Concordiensis, I have learned to be aggressive and ask ques- tions that some may be too timid to ask-no one has ever ac- cused me of being passive. I can guarantee that these quali- ties will be carried over into the job of Junior Trustee. I will not accept \runarounds\ or \beat- to be a part ofcampus life and grow as an individual. I have been a Big Brother since my freshman year .. As a sophomore I traveled to· China on Union's tenn abroad. I currently serve as an International Buddy, help- ing Union's foreign students feel like a part of our commu- nity. I have also recently be- gun to write for the Concordi- ensis. , I feel just in saying that the time for change at Union has come. I envision a campus where students of all races and ethnic groups feel like members of one campus united rather than divided. I intend to in- crease the social opportunities . for those students who choose to remain independent. I'm sure we can all agree that the Greek system is not for everyone. This year we celebrate the fact that women have been at Union for twenty-five years. Meanwhile, the school logo still reads, \un- d~r Minerva we are all broth- ers\. I vow to work for a more inclusive atmosphere on cam- pus. My ears are open to the student body. I realize that so many of us despise being fed by Marriot. Our call for change should not go unheard. To- gether, there is nothing we can not accomplish. My name will appear last on the ballot. I ap- preciate all of your support. ing around the bush\. The job will be done well. There are three facets of a college ... the student -body, the faculty and the administration. If one of these is not repre- sented fairly~ the college will surely falter and I will not allow that to happen if elected. The only way for Union College to improve and become an even betteracademic institution, is if the voices of the student body are heard. If you want things accom- plished and a true representa- tive, please vote Diana Sedita for JuniorTrusteeonFriday. Student Forum Randy Pellish The student body is the foun- dation and heartofUnion Col- lege, and must he properly rep- resented to those people who sit at the top of the decision- making structure: including our president, deans, and-most im- portantly, the Board of Trustees. Student representation must be a premium on the Board of Trustees due to the fact that this group, through no fault of their own, is disconnected from the mainstream of campus life. The Board of Trustees, more than any governing group, needs solid information on how stu- dents feel and what students need. I am running for this position so that I can ensure that the Board of Trustees knows ex- actly how the students feel about their college, anq exactly what students feel they need t~ improve Union. At the .same time, I want to make sure that the students understand the ideas and opinions of the Trust- ees. We all wantonething,and that is to maintain the greatness ofUnion College. To reach this goal together, I will see that the lines of communication between the students and the Trustees remain open. I know Union's future can be one in which both students and administration alike will feel proud of, but it must happen in an open, cooperative environ- ment where all sides understand each other. With this under- standing, we will maintain all the things about Union which we love, and be able to incorporate the new ideas and projects which can improve our college. I ask you for your vote because I believe I can serve you as Jun- · ior Trustee, representing your collective interests to the Board of Trustees, and maintaining representation as a premium at Union College. Thank you. DO NOT FORGET TO VOTE ON FRIDAY!! ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD IN THE COLLEGE CENTER. . . .

Student Forum Jesse Shafer I offer you no triumphed up promises. If you vote for Jesse Shafer as Junior Trustee; what I can promise is that I will work hard and be fully and completely involved in this serious under- taking. I ensure you that the needs and interests of the stu- \ dent body will not be lost in the bureaucratic shuffle to make ends meet. I want this job and will remain an active voice-. please put stock in my judge- ment to do what needs to be done. Like you, I work, party and live in this environment, too. However, though solid in many areas, there are still issues that the trustees need a student's opinion on. Trust in my opinion: vote for Jesse Shafer as Junior Trustee this Friday. Edward \Ned\ W.

So \ before you choose one, ask some questions. How stable is the company? How solid are . its investments? How sound is its overall financial health? A good place to start looking for answers is in the ratings of independent analysts. Four companies, all widely recognized rel;ources for finding out how strong a financial services co111pany really is, gave TIAA their top grade. IN THE FINAL ANALYStS, TIAA IS LETrER PERFECT. TIAA received A++ (Superior) from A.M. Best Co., AAA from Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co., Aaa fro~ Moody's Investors Service and AAA from Standard & Poor's. These ratings reflect TIAA's stability, sound investments, claims-paying ability and over- all financial strength. (These are ratings of Ensuring the future for those who shape it.SM insurance companies only, so they do not apply to CREF.)

The victim is an insanely obese male, found dead face down in a bowl cf spaghetti. With only a week left to retire, detective William Somerset (Freeman) finds the case intrigu- ing, but wishes to be reassigned for two reasons: he does not want to leave a case hanging when he retires, and he cannot stand his new rookie partner, John Mills (Pitt). Then, Somerset stumbles upon some- thing: behind the refrigerator, the word \gluttony\ is carved into the wall. The next day, a defense lawyer is found,slain in his office - the word •'greed\ is writte11 in blood on the floor. Somerset and Mills soon hit CAMPUS FILM FlLE - \While You Were Sleeping\ by Larry Paska, Arts Editor Rating: ***1/2 (outoffour) Until recently, it felt like Hol- lywood had lost its sense of ro- mance. But then someone got the idea to cast rising star Sandra Bullock in a love story, and a story which not only al- lowed her flexibility but the chance to meet the most illogi- cal yet endearing characters ever to grace a romantic com- edy. Bullock is such a likable ac- tress- the kind of sweet, inno- cent girl every guy wants to meet. As Lucy, a hopeless dreamer who works as a token attendant for the Chicago tran- sit system, Bullock has a crush on one guy she sees hopping on the trains every day to work. Of course, she's never actually talked to the guy, but hey, that's what innocent crushes are all about, right? She has no family (and apparently no friends, ei- ther), so she always works holi- days and wishes she could spend them with someone close. Any sentimentalist will get teary-eyed and sympathize with Lucy's dilemma. And with that irresistible whine, her voice sim- ply oozes out pity and hope si- multaneously. On Christmas Day, her dream lover is taking the train when he is pushed off the track by mug- gers. She saves his life, takes him to the hospital, and then passes as his fiancee to make sure he's alright. Well, the fam- ily comes in, mistakes her for his fiancee and welcome her into ' his family. Veteran actor Jack Warden,. playing the bedridden's grandfather, Saul, adds comic delight to the tale as the one man who knows who Lucy really is. But Lucy is good for the family: the relatives feel closer with her around, and Lucy is able to enjoy her first family Christmas in years. Then she meets her \fiancee's\ brother,Jack(Bill Pullman), who doubts her relationship to his brother but then begins to fall for her himself. And when her \fiancee'' awakens from his coma, Lucy realizes she is not in love with himat all, but in love with Jack. Bullock carries the film, but allows just enough room to let the other actors show their sides of the story. And while the family members themselves are reduced to caricatures most of the time (the parents are blind to common sense, the grand- mother has heart trouble when stressed),. they are so heart· warming on screen. Even with the summer re- leases of films like French Kiss and the forgettable Forget Paris, the best romantic comedy of the year is still While You Were Sleeping. Bullock is the first honest \down-home\ ac- tress to come along in quite a while, and with irresistibly sweet sentimentality throughout, While You Were Sleeping can- not help but be a tbrowback to the love stories ofHollywood's Golden Age.

The detectives instantly discover their suspect tq be in• telligent and highly resourceful~ however, they have no clue about his identity or where- abouts. In the meantime, new bodies are discovered, includ~ ing a prostitute's. As if that premise alone isn't eerie enough for you, throw in director Fincher's c1austropho- . bic sets, dim lighting, and drawn out tension. Fincher, a music video director who made his feature: film debut wi~ the similarly-dark Alien 3, creates characters at the mercy of their predator, much liktt; the coto- nists on the planet in Alien 3. The suspense and riddles are intriguing enough to keep the interest going, even during the lengthy dialogues. But Fincher, too concerned with the visuals, often overlooks some key flaws: such as, why is .the sun shining in a car during the middle of a heavy thunderstorm? Why do the detectives walk throug.h each apartment with flashlights when they could simply flick on a light switch? In an attempt to be extremely dark, the :film hopes to make the viewer miss some key story holes. Pitt and Freeman do a fine job on their own, although one ne'\[er really feels the partner- ship between them. Of course, this is not meant to be a cop buddy picture like the Lethal Weapon series, b'ut Pitt's mav- erick cop and Freeman's cal ci.J- lating Mr. Spock performance ne~er seem to mesh.

The real credit for the fi.Jm 's look goes to Fincher. He cre- ates depressing scenes fille'd with. lots of r~in and very few people. It's as if Mills and Somerset are all alone in this gi- ant urban setting. Paltrow, Pitt's real-life girlfriend and on-screen wife, does not add as much as s:he' d Tike to, being confined as ilie complacent wife who· cooks a meal for the boys and ~lso confides her unhappiness to Somerset. . This aspect .of the story is never explored, so it re- aHy doesn't belong to begin with. Spacey: as John Doe the villain, is a delight, playing his rcle with a stra.ight face - one never knows what is really go- ing on in that mind of his. In the end, Seven delivers a complex and unrelenting story that, if you can stomach it, is definitely above average. Even with the several ten-minute two- .c:haracter dialogues that span the film, the pacing is constant. . ~- '-~ ·~ ~~r Sadly, the story seems to dump too many surprises on the viewer at the end, without re- ally allowing time to figure out now it happened.

· Page 14 • Septe~ber 28,1995 • The Concordiimsis WRUC \We Respect Ugly Sounding Chart Toppers\ by Conor McKenzie Features Staff Don't get me wrong. Many stu- dents here seem to like Dave Matthew's, Blues Traveler, Van Hal en, and other overplayed pop bands, and there is nothing inher- ently wrong with that garbage. I may not like it, but the majority does. After all, they call thatstuff mainstream~ therefore, it would follow that most people should listen to it. In that case, it would also follow that most radio sta- tions would play that stuff so that the highest percentage of people possible would tune in and listen to their sponsor's ads. Apparently, much to the dis- may of many WRUC DJs, WRUC is not a commercial ra- dio station and does not (and in my opinion should not) cater to the tastes of the mindless flocks. Much to my listening displeasure I've found that most of these so- called DJs really wish to play the stuff you hear on commercial ra- dio. Unfortunately, WRUC really cannot compete with the area's commercial stations. Why would the average listener choose to I is- ten to Dave Matthew's on WRUC 0 They could tune into another station and listen to pro- fessional DJs who don't cut off songs and don't have poor radio voices. Fortunately. WRUC does not have to compete with com- mercial radio. Ideally they should be serving two completely differ- ent markets. Before I have all the WRUC DJs defaming my name on the airwaves, I'd like to say that many DJs put on remarkable shows. I've heard excellent Hip-Hop show~ on Friday and Sunday nights. I've also heard several excellent Punk/Ska/ Alternative shows throughout the week. Some WRUC DJs have real- ized that college radio has a spe- cial and influential niche in the music industry. Funding by the college or university allows this difference; theydon'thave to ca- ter to money hungry sponsors. Traditionally college radio has been a place to feature under- ground, alternative, and under- played types of music- stuff like alternative, hard-core, punk, Ska, hip-hop, .acid jazz, techno, house, reggae, dancehall, and funk that is generally underepresented in the commercial radio scene. Gen- erally, college radio is the vessel that transports this music to the masses. This vessel is crucial. Bands like Smashing pumpkins and Pavement wouldn't be enjoying their present-day success if it wasn't for the air play they re- ceived from enthusiastic college radio DJs across the country Most people don't realize how important the college radio scene is. There are several magazines that chart college radio. College radio serves as a major gauge of Cross Dressers at Union College by Jesse Karotkin Contibuting Writer All eyes turned as a tall and mysterious blonde arrived at Smith House this past Saturday night. The fact that this beauty in a tight black dress was .in actu- ality a man came as no surprise to the other guests at the party. That's because the students at the Smith House \Gender Bender\ were all dressed in drag. This is the second consecutive year that Smith House has hosted the event. As a theme house, Smith attempts to create social al- ternatives on campus. The Gen- der Bender was made possible this year due to the support of Dean Alford. Most people in the house would like to have seen more stu- dents from around campus at the party. It proved to be a great time for everyone who was willing to toss aside societal norms for the even mg. The making of a believable character at the Gender Bender included not only the actual cross- dressing,_ but also the presenta- tion. Dan, for example, quickly became Danielle with a dress on, just as Kim was Cameron while flaunting a tux. While one woman, sporting a large beer gut, repeatedly ordered the men to sat- isfy her need for another can of Budweiser, another was satisfied to pack a fat pinch of tobacco under her lip and check out \the babes\. Aside from being treated like objects, the men learned the painstaking process some women go through before going out. The Gender Bender was a night different from anything else of- fered on campus. Even the food which consisted of bananas, whipped cream, and jello added to the humor of the evening. Ev- eryone at the Gender Bender would have liked to see more stu- dents from around campus join- ing the festivity. Those students who dared defy conventional mores while dressed in drag seemed extremely com- fortable with their sexuality. It was a night which most of the them will remember for quite a while. success to the underground mu- sic industry. College radio maga- zines compile the lists of most fre- quently played songs submitted by various radio stations and set up their own set of \charts.\ College radio's purpose isn't just to showcase local and up- and-coming bands either. For instance, my hometown radio sta- tion WRUV (UVM) plays more reggae and dancehall than any other station in New England or Canada. I think I've made my point. WRUC has an identity crisis. This crisis shouldn't be too hard to rectifY. WRUC should use it's status as \The First Station in the Nation\ to take a leadership role among college radio stations. WRUC could prove that it's still number one. I understand that it can take a while to find an identity-they don't exactly grow on trees you know. In the meantime, could I make a suggestion? Next time the college spends 30,000 dollars to bring two big name bands to play on campus, WRUC should pro- mote them-that is if we want more than 700 people to attend them. When somebody calls up (me) asking them to play some Belly the night before the concert, they should be able to find it in their archives and put it on the airwaves. If they can't manage to do that, it might make sense to at least tnention the show on the radio. Finally, Union College Has a Pep Band! by Mike Greenbaum Contributing Writer Yes, starting this year Union College will have a Pep Band, and everyone with a band instru- ment is invited to join. There will be a practice in room 313 of the Arts building this Thursday, September 28, from 7:00 to 8:00pm. Most other colleges ofUnion's size have a pep band to support their athletes and display school spirit. It's about time we had one too. How much longer must the en- thusiasm for our college reside in a few professor emeriti and alumni? You know who I'm talk- ing about, those people at the football games who actually know the words to the fight song. Not the Alma Mater, that begins; \Let the Grecian dream . . . , \ but the actual fight song. · Perhaps you thought that the Alma Mater was, in fact, the only traditional song the school had.

.. ,,:· ·.: ' - Page.15 • Tbe Concordiensis ·September 28, 1995 Living Insanity It Seems by Chris Richards Living Editor I went into a convenience store to get a drink and on walking back through theaisleto the line insan- ity seemed to draw closer with each step. I turned the corner and there they were. My eyes met these horrific noises never before heard; while my virgin ears stood amazed. I walked three feet upon their backs and saw the painter of these words. No. What I heard had nothing to do with wards. They w:ere animal groans. These sounds were created far before language ever existed. They were a partry of three. On the extreme left there was a man who was swiftly, yet me- thodically, pounding his forehead · with his wallet behind stunned animal eyes. To the right ofhim and in front of me there was a \psychologist. To the far right was the tallest of the three. His far away eyes staring down the aisle were buglike, as if his eye- balls were too big for their sock- ets, and had inadvertently been allowed to see too much. But my attention could not be taken away from the thumping I heard at my left. He never stopped hitting himself with his money. The man in the middle tried to sl<>w hitn down, but he had nothing t0 do with reason. There were three peaple in front of us, (and I now include myself as being with them} and an old woman who was slower than nails was manning the register. His eyes were staring at hers while drawing his wallet, to and fro, between his outreached arm and his reddened forehead. He would slowly draw his sacrafice out to her, like a gun, with the wallet fi- nally, dramatically blocking their eyes in this ultimate offering. Each time his gift was neglected it would furiously be snapped back to be stopped by his fore- head. An elastic snap back. He couldn't 1:mderstand what the problem was. Why are you mak- ing me wait? Look at me, I'm standing here and I want to pay! You know, money? This green stuffi'H give you some. Not later right now! '\ DIJI '\'I'' IIJ \\'' '\' luniiJt Tr1111ee /Jn Friday in llle C1J//ege Cenlet. Cel in\\'\''' I got sucked into staring at him and became obsessed with his every motion. The way his eyes moved in his head were sudden, extreme movements. Nothing else e~isted save for his eyes, his wallet, and the cashier's problem. Whafs the problem? Okay so I finally come back and am awak- ened/touched by a noise so dif- ferent, so startlingly ·different from all this chaotic din that I can hardly believe it. I had a sneak- ing suspicion that it was coming from the man on the far right, but I knew nothing anymore. Turn- ing my head away from him I heardthenoiseagain. Coo. Coo. The sound of which comes from no tongue in your or I's mouth but from a beak. It sounded like it came fmm a beak. From a spaz to a bird. These sublime, bird- like utterances were arrows knif- ing through the chaotic din from the man on the left. As ifhe were trying to impart peace upon his friend. Relax relax relax. You know you got to wait. Got to wait. Keep on waiting. All we have to do is wait. Of uniformity there was none. The man on the left woufd look down at his side, moving his head ftom side to side like a snake. Wondering. We slowly moved forward. Slowly. While its true that we were moving slow we were nonetheless out of controL We were getting closer and the playerswere getting louder. The more the left man had to wait the more agitated he became. Hotter and hotter while the man on the right was getting cooler, cooler; slippery enough for his coo to be heard and not crushed. This mad- ness was snowballing some- where, and I had no idea what would happen. The ship comes to port and here we are. Oh what pleasant company! Eye contact is made. The cashier is looking at the man who is beating his head with his wallet. May fhelp you? Who me? Bam. The man in the middle grabs the mans waiJet, puts it down on the counter and points at it. What? More fright- ening eye contact. No reaction. For the first time since we have been waiting there is complete silence. We are the only ones in the store and there is a situation. He paws the wallet with his hand. Stirs it. Squeezes this meaningless thing in his hand as if it were god. The wallet is snatched away by the man in the middle and pulls out a dollar bill. Shows it to him. Hands her the bill. She opens the register and gives twenty cents back to the man in the middle. Change goes in wallet, and wallet is returned back to the unusable owner. Bam. Why couldn't I do that. Bam! The man in the middle then pays for the birdman, apparently from habit. He observed him nowwith complete bewilderment, and me- ticulously observed the transac- tion like a bird on a windowsill. His head drew closer and closer, trying to get a better view. If only he had a better angle he could understand. Putting the wallet back in his pocket the bird raised his eyes as if he had grown wiser. I didn't know where I was. I was going somewhere. Where was I going and how did I get here. They hurled out. I pointed to my drink and grabbed a pack of ciga- rettes. She asked me if that's all and I said yes. The Living Section is Back With Chris and David . . ' . . . . The Dreqmer · . · by David Eder!Living Editor · · · > ' . ' . , . \ . I introduce myself as a realist. Some have disagreed. They call me an optimist or claim that I have a propensity to dream. But I am real and I endeavor to expe- rience only reality. A reality that can sing its song in silence and unlock its beauty in darkness. A reality that is built on truth. A truth that is inevitably beautiful. A conversation with a friend began with this question. \Do you mean to say that there is but one reality?\ \Yes.\ I replied. \But reality changes according to our perceptions. Climb a moun- tain and the world looks peace- ful. Come back down return to the city and the world seems cha- otic'. Learn bad news and you are sad. Hear good news and you are happy.\ This my friend as- sured me was true. But we do not need to experi- ence this change in perception. Our perceptions are affected by three things; our intelligence, our instincts, and our spirit. Unfor- tunately these three are too often used independently of each other. An awareness of these is neces- sary. Our powerful minds which, are gifts from God, are now used to develop arguments that there is no God. Our instincts which are no more than self-defense mechanisms are often confused with our spirit Although, the spirit or soul is often overlooked, it is of the most value to us. Haven't we all set out to \find ourselves?\ Some have traveled hoping to find themselves hiding in a Tibetan monastery or along the canals in Venice. Others search their minds, through medi- tation, for themselves. But what is found? We find out that what we are has nothing to do with our geographic locations or our minds. We are a spirit. We are \part and particle of God\ made up of energy that can be neither created nor destroyed.( An en- ergy that is so far undetectable. That resembles light with out color and sound without noise. An energy that flows through us and all things. This energy holds the mysteries of life and the lack of death. This energy governs the animate and inanimate. It is in this energy that we find our- selves. So we find ourselves ev- erywhere and in everything. This energy is made of truth and love. Love itself being the purest form of this energy is the foundation of ou~ existence. Love circulates within everyone and everything. Understanding that we are greater than our rninds, bodies, and instincts we begin to see re- ality. A reality that can not be disturbed by petty rivalries or fears. A reality that is governed by love. A reality that is inde- scribably beautiful, that can only be disturbed by a few who are still trying to live on intellect and instinct alone. It is the job o[ the realist to help those who are fight- ing these internal battles. Through these altruistic efforts the realist's suspicions are con- firmed. Through servic~, the realist achieves knowledge and tranquility. Once we have accepted this truth about the spirit, we begin to seek out this reality. We lose interest in false realities. We search for that reality in nature. Although, we understand that the loving energy that controls every- thing is everywhere, the realist knows that in nature we find the unscarred version of it. The re- alist hikes mountains. He sits quietly in the woods, observing the animals. The realist is good as well as evil. He holds hos- tage some of the most ugly thoughts. He also imagines ways of helping people overcome pain. The realist is not worried by the label of being bad or possessing evil thoughts. He knows that there is a reason behind every- thing. That beneath the tempes- tuous waves remains the infinite calm of the ocean. A dreamer I am called because I believe us all to be infinite, to have powers which have yet to be tapped. A dreamer because I believe in love and an endless source of energy that holds within it the keys to felicity. A dreamer because I believe that people can become God-like. A dreamer because I believe anything is pos- sible. I do not see myself as an optimist. I am a realist. Reality is beautiful. This is proven by the wide-eyed infant. The child has not learned about fear and social distinctions. A child only experiences the real- ity I talk of. The child is genu- inely happy. Are you? -

I walked three feet upon their backs and saw the painter of these words. No. What I heard had nothing to do with words. They were animal groans. These sounds were created far before language ever existed. They were a partry of three. On the extreme left there was a man who was swiftly, yet me- thodically, pounding his forehead with his wallet behind stunned animal eyes. To the right of him and in front of me there was a «psychologist.\ To the far right was the tal lest of the three. His far away eyes staring down the aisle were bug! ike, as if his eye- balls were too big for their sock- ets, and had inadvertently been allowed to see too much. But my attention could not be taken away from the thumping I heard at my left. He never stopped hitting himself with his money. The man in the middle tried to slow him down, but he had nothing to do with reason. There were three people in front of us, (and I now include myself as being with them) and an old woman who was slower than nails was manning the register. His eyes were staring at hers while drawing his wallet, to and fro, between his outreached arm and his reddened forehead. He would slowly draw his sacrafice out to her, like a gun, with the wallet fi- nally, dramatically blocking their eyes in this ultimate offering. Each time his gift was neglected it would furiously be snapped back to be stopped by his tore- head. An elastic snap back. He couldn't understand what the problem was. Why are you mak- ing me wait? Look at me, I'm standing here and I want to pay! You know, money? This green stuff! 'II give you some. Not later right now! /)tJ ntJI ltJrgel ltJ VtJfe lor Junior Truslee tJn Friday in 1/Je CtJ/!ege Cenler. fJel invtJ!vetl! I got sucked into staring at him and became obsessed with his every motion. The way his eyes moved in his head were sudden, extreme movements. Nothing else ex·isted save for his eyes, his wallet, and the cashier's problem. What's the problem? Okay so I finally come back and am awak- ened/touched by a noise so dif- ferent, so startlingly different from al:l this chaotic din that I can hardly believe it. I had a sneak- ing suspicion that it was coming from the man on the far right, but I knew nothing anymore. Turn- ing my head away from him I heard the noise again. Coo. Coo. The sound of which comes from no tongue in your or I's mouth but from a beak. It sounded like it came from a beak. From a spaz to a bird. These sublime, bird- like utterances were arrows knif- ing through the chaotic din from the man on the left. As if he were trying to impart peace upon his friend. Relax relax relax. You know you got to wait. Got to wait. Keep on waiting. All we have to do is wait. Of uniformity there was none. The man on the left woufd look down at his side, moving his head from side to side like a snake. Wondering. We slowly moved forward. Slowly. While its true that we were moving slow we were nonetheless out of control. We were getting closer and the players were getting louder. The more the left man had to wait the more agitated he became. Hotter and hotter while the man on the right was getting cooler, cooler; slippery enough for his coo to be heard and not crushed. This mad- ness was snowballing some- where, and I had no idea what would happen. The ship comes to port and here we are. Oh what pleasant company! Eye contact is made. The cashier is looking at the man who is beating his head with his wallet. May I help you? Who me? Bam. The man in the middle grabs the mans wallet, puts it down on the counter and points at it. What? More fright- ening eye contact. No reaction. For the first time since we have been waiting there is complete silence. We are the only ones in the store and there is a situation. He paws the wallet with his hand Stirs it Squeezes this meaningless thing in his hand as if it were god. The wallet is snatched away by the man in the middle and pulls out a dollar bill. Shows it to him. Hands her the bi:ll. She opens the register and gives twenty cents back to the man in the middle. Change goes in wallet, and wallet is returned back to the unusable owner. Bam. Why couldn't I do that. Bam! The man in the middle then pays for the birdman, apparently from habit. He observed him now with complete bewilderment, and me- ticulously observed the transac- tion like a bird on a windowsill. His head drew closer and closer, trying to get a better view. If only he had a better angle he could understand. Putting the wallet back in his pocket the bird raised his eyes as if he had grown wiser. I didn't know where I was. I was going somewhere. Where was I going and how did I get here They hurled out. I pointed to my drink and grabbed a pack of ciga- rettes. She asked me ifthat's all and I said yes. The Living Section is Back With Chris and David I introduce myself as a realist. Some havedisag1eed. They call me an optimist or claim that I have a propensity to dream. But I am real and I endeavor to expe- rience only reality. A reality that can sing its song in silence and unlock its beauty in darkness. A reality that is built on truth. A truth that is inevitably oeautiful. A conversation with a friend began with this question. \Do you mean to say that there is hut one reality?\ ''Yes.\ I replied. \But reality changes according to our perceptions. Climb a moun- tain and the world looks peace- ful. Come back down return to the city and the world seems cha- otic. Learn bad news and you are sad. Hear good news and you are happy.\ This my friend as- sured me was true. But we do not need to experi- ence this change in perception. Our perceptions are affected by three things; our intelligence, our instincts, and our spirit. Unfor- tunately these three are too often used independently of each other. An awareness of these is neces- sary. Our powerful minds which, are gifts from God, are now used to develop arguments that there is no God. Our instincts which are no more than self-defense mechanisms are often confused with our spirit. Although, the spirit or soul is often overlooked, it is of the most value to us. Haven't we all set out to \find ourselves?\ Some have traveled hoping to find themselves hiding in a Tibetan monastery or along the canals in Venice. Othen search their minds. through medi- tation. for themselves. But what is found'! We find out that what we are has nothing to do with our geographic locations or our minds. We are a spirit. We are \part and particle of God\ made up of energy that can be neither created nor destroyed. An en- ergy that is so far undetectable. That resembles light with out color and sound without noise. An energy that flows through us and all things. This energy holds the mysteries oflife and the lack of death. This energy governs the animate and inanimate. It is in this energy that we find our- selves. So we find ourselves ev- erywhere and in everything. This energy is made of truth and love. Love itself being the purest form of this energy is the foundation of our existence. Love circulates within everyone and everything. Understanding that we are greater than our minds, bodies, and instincts we begin to see re- ality. A reality that can not be disturbed by petty rivalries or fears. A reality that is governed by love. A reality that is inde- scribably beautiful, that can only be disturbed by a few who are still trying to live on intellect and instinct alone. It is the job o: the realist to help those who are fight- ing these internal battles. Through these altruistic efforts the realist's suspicions are con- firmed. Through service, the realist achieves knowledge and tranquility. Once we have accepted this truth about the spirit. we beg in to seek out this reality. We lose mterest in false realities. We search for that reality in nature. Although. we understand that the loving energy that controls every- thing is everywhere. the realist knows that in nature we find the umcarred version of it. The re- alist hikes mountains. He sits lJUietly in the woods. observing the animals. The realist is good as well as evil. He holds hos- tage some of the most ugly thoughts. He also imagines ways of helping people overcome pain. The realist is not worried by the label of being bad or possessing evil thoughts. He knows that there is a reason behind every- thing. That beneath the tempes- tuous waves remains the infinite calm of the ocean. A dreamer I am called because I believe us all to be infinite, to have powers which have yet to be tapped. A dreamer because I believe in love and an endless source of energy that holds within it the keys to felicity. A dreamer because I believe that people can become God-like. A dreamer because I believe anything is pos- sible. I do not see myself as an optimist. I am a realist. Reality is beautiful. This is proven by the wide-eyed infant. The child has not learned about fear and social distinctions. A child only experiences the real- ity I talk of. The child is genu- inely happy. Are you? ....

Sports Dutchmen Soccer • Reaches Dangerous Depth by J.ason Starr Sports Editor Since we last left our soccer heroes, the Dutchmen have man- aged to drop under. 500 for the second time this seasm:1. However, the team put up agood fight in reaching this low point. In the first game ofthe week, Union maintained a steady enough tread to stay •. above the water line, but they were sunk on Tuesday by a more talented Williams team. So the line has consumed them and they now must struggle totake another breath. The Vassar game was a marathon. Two overtimes did not pro- vide a score and the bout was announced a draw. The Dutchmen took a half to get their engine going but by the beginning of the . secondhalf, Union realized they were in for a battle. The .intensity of the fight brought out the best in both teams and the last 75 min- utes were some of the best soccer of the season. Dan Young and Eric Kujawski played especially strong defense and contributed to the shutout. ,Joe Caruso's five saves were also a help. Unfortu- nately, Union's offense played about as well as Vassar's. Neither could muster a score on eight shots and the final tally was 0-0. This tie however could be considered a loss because of the fall of junior Ted Doran with an ankle injury. Tuesday's game was against Williams and it was over very quickly. Three shots and eight minutes into the game the score was . 3-0. By the end of the half, the Dutchmen had fallen behind 4-0. This was arguably Union's worst half of soccer this year. Sure they were overmatched but they also looked slow and timid. The second half was a little livelier for the Dutchmen. Perhaps the substitution of Brad Funk for Joe Caruso at goalie contributed to Union'sspark. Hehad one nice save of a pointblank Wil'liams shot to preserve his half of shutout goal tending. However, Funk's spark was only strong enough to produce one goal; a penalty shot no less. The penalty came during a scramble in front of the net which turned out to be the Dutchmen's best scoring bid. Freshman Nathan Blodgett took advantage ofthe opportunity with a blast into the upper right comer. The score remained 4-l unti·1 the final hom blew. This loss puts Union~ s mark at 2-3-l.

UNION CREW: Alum Eyes '96 Olympics by Jeffery Druiba '97 & Matt Greene '93 Contributing :Writers Next year's summer Olympics in Atlanta .might be a time to cel- ebrate in the Union community if Peter Schwab '93 has his. way. The Ust ofaccotnplishments for the former Union rower and stu- d<?nt is impressive. Ifa:ll goeswell for Peter, next smnmer will be golden. Pet~r rowed throughout his sec- ondary school years at Brookline High School in Massachusetts. ln a stnmge coincidence that shows how tight the rowing community is. It happens that his fonnerhigh school coach, Tom White, is now the·varsity·coachat{)nion. When he arrived at Union Crew, Peter began a four year run of excel- lence with his fellow rowers. As ·11 freshman at States in 1990, Pe- ter was on an eight that won sil- ver. The years passed and the team changed as Union won some and lost few. During the summer· before his senior year, Peter and his good friend, Matt Greene, at- tended separate lightweight row- ing development camps. When both came together in the fall, they.rowed in a double to train. At thattime, an interesting oppor- tunity presented,itselfin two jun- iors, Matt Kirk •94 and Kevin Puppe '94, as well as junior cox- swain J.J. We-iner '94. What all four decided was they were go- ing to win the gold at Philadelphia's Dad Vail Regatta, rowing in the lightweight four with coxswain. They did exactly that after a season of the most in- tense training any of those row- ers had known. ·Ltd'~ to right: Union Crew Head Coach Jim Crick, Kevin Puppe '94, Matt Greene '93, Matt Kirk '94, J.J. Weiner '94 with gold medals at Dad Vail Regatta Spring 1994. (photocQurtestf)fMike Ferguson} Now, Peter was a Union gradu- ate and his future in rowing was wide open. He rowed at a I ight- weight development camp over the summer of '93. That same winter, he rowed with Boston Rowing Club (BRC) in the com- pany of several national team members who trained there over the winter as well. In the spring of 1994, Peter decided to try out for the national team in Philadel- phia. Along the path to that goal, he was selected to be a part of a lightweight eight and sent to the Royal Henley Regatta in England. They won the Lady's Cup, the race for lightweight eights. The team then returned to Philadel- phia to continue national team cuts. Peter made it through the last round when he was finally cut. That summer, he won the Royal Canadian Henley in the pair with- out coxswain event. The fall rowing season began and Peter competed in the Head Of The Charles, finishing with the silver in the pair without again. He then turned to Boston to train through the winter. That plan would not happen as he wished though .... severe stomach pains wllich Peter had throughout col- lege, and to that point, had wors- ened. The problem faded, but only returned in a new severity. Finally, Peter underwent major surgery that required a huge in- cision in his abdomen. This was not what he needed in his row- ing career. He was out of com- mission until April of this year. At that time, he talked to the na- tional team lightweight coach about his options and was soon giving the team another try in Philadelphia. This is an unheard of comeback especially after missing months of intense train- ing. In the early summer, Peter competed in the American Row- ing Championships and won in the lightweight pair. Finally in July, Peter was informed he had made the lightweight 'national eight. The crew traveled to the World Championships in Tampere, Finland where they The Women's Lacrosse team is Iookifl.g for new players. All women., (novices included) are welcome. Anyone interested should contact Coach Charlyn Roberts at x6040 made the finals. but placed a dis- appointing fifth. That leaves ev- erything that happens next in the air. Much speculation is circulat- ing that the I ightweight coach might be fired soon. With the Olympics approaching fast, it is nota good time for the state of US Rowing to be questioned. The Olympics present an inter- esting opportunity because there has never been a lightweight com- petition. Only a few lightweight events were added for next year's competition, the largest of these being the lightweight four with- out coxswain. In the Olympics, teams are only allowed to have a certain numberofmembers. Thus, to have the few lightweight events added, some heavyweight events were removed, like the heavy four with coxswain that the I ightweight four is replacing. Peter thinks that, with all the confusion, one race will. be de- cided on as \the race\ that deter- mines who represents the United States. With that as their inspira- tion, high caliber lightweights across the country will be putting together lightweight fours and racing for the honor of represent- ing the United States. This, of course, is not a good system be- cause the best rowers aren't cho- sen, only the fastest boat at one race. As the tenn progresses here at Union, Peter's Olympic possibili- ties will be working their way out. We can only hope that he will complete his goals and wish him the best ofluck in reaching them.

September 28, 1995 PAGE 20 Wfr.e ([onrnrUi.ensis Field Hockey Triumphant Two Out of Three Games This Past Weekend by Jon Gasthalter Sports Staff The field hockey Dutchwomen closed the week of competitioA with a four and three record after wins against Albany and Skidmore and a loss to Rensselaer. At Albany on Tues- day, September 19, the Dutchwomen played a good all- around game to beat Albany 1-0. Tonya Capparello, Bianca Prumo, and Katie Richardson excelled in the loss. However, Rensselaer after scoring once held on to winthe game one to nothing. Skidmore was Union's guest on Saturday, September 23, and the Dutchwomen came out scoring once again. Skidmore scored once in the .first halfto put the score at 1-0 at the end of the half. Union came out of the gate for the sec- ond half shooting. They kept up their unrelenting attack as tonya Capparello scored to knot the score at one apiece. Minutes later, Union scored again to break the deadlock and win the game 2-l. Congratulations to Carrie Aheroth who was the UCAA Rookie of the Week and to Michelle McCarte and Tonya Capparello who were Co-players ofthe Week. The Dutchwomen returned home for the start of a seven- game homestand on Friday, Sep- tember 22, against Rensselaer. The game, which was halted for ten minutes at the start of the first half due to a heavy downpour, was controlled by Union. The Dutchwomen came out shooting and took Rensselaer by surprise. The Dutchwomen continue their homestand against Middlebury on September 27 and Springfield on September29. Field Hockey had impressive weekend with three honored playen. (photo by Rick LedereriiC) Dutchmen Defense Sparks Comeback Vict~lfY Over Hobart by Ken Berman Sports Editor The Union Football Team im- proved it's record to 2-1 this past Saturday with a 39-15 win over host Hobart. The defense, as it has been all season, led the team to victory, as it set up all but 7 points This was made possible by five takeaways, and a stingy all-around effort. In three games this season, the Dutchmen have now picked· off nine passes, recovered five fumbles, blocked four punts and a PAT kick, have 15 quarterback sacks, and one safety. The de- fense and special teams have now set up 77 of the 91 points that Union has scored this season. Hobart jumped out to a quick 9-0 lead, and the way the offense had been playing, that loomed pretty large. However, Union roared back to score 3 9 unan- swered points to put the game in the bag. Their first score was a typical Dutchmen touchdown. Robart's offense, unable to do anything with the ball, was forced to punt deep in their own territory. The center snap, however, was too high, and careened into the end zone, where it was recovered for a touchdown by junior cornerback Elton Lee. The PAT by Roger Egbert made the score 9-7. Hobart lost the ball on its next possession, as it lost the ball near midfield on a bad pitch. Fresh- man cornerback Justin Campbell, who already has put up gaudy numbers this season (3 blocked punts, 2 sacks, 2 fumble recover- ies, and I interception), scored his first collegiate touchdown when he picked up the fumble and raced 3 9 yards to the endzone. A two point conversion by junior Len Barbaro gave Union a 15-9 lead, which sent Union on their way to the rout. The defense wasted no tim~ in getting the ball back for their of- fense, as senior corner Charrod Riley picked off a pass and re- turned it 27 yards to the Hobart 15. Senior back Kojo Attah scored his fourth touchdown off the sea- son four plays later, when he bar- reled in from three yards out. Jun- ior Shuron Morton added the two point conversion to make the score 23-9, as the half ended. Union's offense opened the second strongly, scoring on only its second unassisted (not set up by defense or special teams) drive of the season. Backup quarterback Todd Ellis drove his squad 60 yards in just eight plays, finishing off with an 18 yard strike to jun- ior wideout Pete Buscemi, to make the score 30-9. This was the first career touchdown scored by either player. Another defensive takeaway set up Union's last touchdown of the day, when junior linebacker Bobby Champlin intercepted a pass at the Hobart 35 and brought it all the way back to the 14. It took Union six plays, but they finally got the hall in, thanks to the efforts of Attah, who scored his second touchdown of the day. An Egbert :field 7 goal finished off the Union scoring. Union will get it's stiffest test of the year on Homecoming, against Dickinson. The 3-0 Dev- ils come into the game looking to add to their perfect record. Last year, Dickinson shut out the Dutchmen, the first time this had happened in I 28 games, dat- ing back to November 7, 1981. The Union defense, which has thus far carried the team, will try to slow down the Dickinson of- fense, which averages 322 yards __ a game on the ground, to go along with 60 yards in the air. Defensively, Dickinson given up only two touchdowns all year, and opponents are averaging only 2.3 yards a carry against them. The Dutchmen will have to hope that the large Homecom- ing crowd helps them with this formidable foe. ''And the Rooster Just Sat By the Side of the Road'' by Kathy \Legs\ Walter Sports Staff Bringing only 18 players, 3 cars and 'the Rooster', the women ruggers trounced over a 45 player Colgate team and returned home 12 hours later after a shopping spree. In an amazing show of skill and athletic prowess, Union's own Wheaty scored off of the start- ing kick-offto Colgate to make the score 5~0. A strong hurricane wind came up suddenly and blocked the attempt by Sara 'through . the uprights' Gower for the two extra points. After that, Colgate · scored a non-distinct try, we had half-time and they cheated (to score again). (Have no fear, though, revenge was taken and the bodies were removed.) Then after some amazing plays and mo- tions by both the serum and the line, Sara 'launched from a rocket' Gower ran in for an impressive try and made the following kick. . The score remained 12-10 for a Union victory. (Note: Just as academic grades do not always portray the full amount of effort and ability a person puts into a class, so with this final score). Tackles beyond comprehension were being completed in front ofhundreds of screaming fans, feet were being replaced by wheels and support was 'a bubblin' over'. None of this, I assure you would have been possible without the extremely quick and aggressive rookie contingent of Cathy 'Who was that masked wing?' Budgen, Julie 'I'll just fake it' Firman, Shalini 'our periscope' Sood, and Ahnya 'hull's eye' Mendes. They combined with the veteran force ofJen 'Look Ma, no brace' Lelas, Christine 'don't let the hair color fool you' Hoffman, Sara 'call me anything but late for dinner' Gower, Beth 'Look, that's -ny hill over there' Wheat, and Stacey 'but, it doesn't hurt' Fellows in the line (who all combined for an amazing passing and strategy game) and Tiffany 'the trickster' Lussier (who had some great insights which led to extra.meterage offofpenalties),Courtney 'Oh,myGod ifsearly' Brem,Jane 'the . Prop' Seekins, Noelle 'I may have a bruise on my heart, but I'm still going drinking tonight' Somers {who got injured late in the second half), Andrea 'Freak' Schulman, Naomi 'they haven'tkilled me yet' Harel (who has been returned to us from the hospital's most seen list), and Kathy 'I love to tackle when the ground is soft' Walter. We'd like to take this time to dedicate the game to our ref who . showed us what true tackling can get you (we almost didn't want to leave!!!). The Union Women play their next two at home against Albany State (Homecoming Weekend) and Oneonta (Parents' Weekend). Kick-offtime for both games stands at 11 :30 AM, rugby time (which doesn't really mean anything). Hope to see you there!
