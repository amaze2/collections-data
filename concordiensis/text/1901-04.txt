The ConcordieJlsis VoL. XXIV. UNION COLLEGE, APRIL ll, 1901. No. 23. NEW COACH FOR TRACK TEAM. G. B. Wells, a Crack Michigan Athlete and Trainer, Engaged for the Coming Season. George B. Wells, who is well known to union tnen as the star athlete of the local Washington Continentals, has been engaged to coach and train the track candidates this spring. Mr. Wells has had considerable success in this line of work and should do well with the men. He has coached with the very best results the track teatns of the Govern tnent Indian school at Mt. Pleasant, Michigan, Alma college and the Central State Normal college. The new coach is a Michigan State college tnan. While an undergraduate at that insti- tution he wofl for two consecutive years the :all around championship of the Michigan Intercollegiate A. A., which consists of six colleges and universities in that state. He holds at present records in that association for the high hurdles, pole vault and quarter mile run. Mr. Wells has been connected with the General Electric Works during the past year, but has kept up his athletic work to some extent on the Washington Continentals team. l-Ie will follow the coaching methods adopted by the late John Cosgrave who coached Union's crack team of '97, by personally working upon the track and field with the candidates. He will be upon the campus throughout the entire day and will be ready to meet the men at all times. New men who '\'ish to make thetn- selves proficient in any particular event may make appointments with him at any time except during the regular track hours. He particularly requests such men to con1e to him for consultation at once. NEW YO~K MUSICAL T~IP. Clubs 'Start Down the Hudson River April 24. Manager H. J. Brown has announced the schedule of :the spring tour of the musical association. Leaving Schenectady April 24, the first stop will be at Catskill, where a con- cert will be Kiven in the Nelida theatre under the auspices of the Young Men's Society of that town. On l'hursday, April 25, the clubs will cross the riYer to Poughkeepsie where a 111atinee will be given in the Masonic Temple. This will be the first appearance of the clubs in that city. Nevertheless a good house is expected as Union's alun\lni are interested and have prom- ised their heartiest co-operation and support. The next stop will be made at Fishkill-on- the-Hudso~ wh€re V. E. Stolbrand, '78, super- intendent of the Mt. Bacon militat-y acade.my, has arranged a concert for the benefit of the athletic assocjation of his school. On Friday evening an entertainment will be given in the Assembly hall at Newburg under the auspices of the Free Academy Athletic Association. T. Van W. Anthony, '96, was instrumental in securing the date and his aid combined with the assistance of other alun1ni should bring about a social and financial suc- cess. The last concert of the tour will be given in the Carnegie Lyceum, New York, where for the past five years the clubs have played to crowded houses. E. S. Barney, '84, secretary of the Alutllni Association of New York city, assisted by Wagner Van Vlack, 'oo, last year's tnanager of tbe clubs, is putting forth strenuous efforts to have an audience even larger than formerly. The clubs are now worldng to get themselves in the best of condition and are anticipating a jolly and successful trip.

6 THE OONCORDIENSIS. THt 'VARSITY NINE. Captain Parker Rounding Up His Bronchos. Baseball practice in the open field cotn- menced early last week but the heavy rains prevented any further out-door work until this week Wednesday. The first day in the open air the college saw a large number of candi- dates out upon the diatnond. The winter training showed its good efforts in a number of instances. It was rather surprising to witness the avidity witl1 which sotne of the infielders picked up \hot ones\ and sent the ball fast to the h1itial bag. The candidates in the outfield caught a very fair percentage of the flies. No line-up has taken place as yet, as atten- tion. has thus fa1· been given only to perfecting the :field-work of the n1en. Dr. Towne, who by the way is an old Williams baseball man, is giving his attention to the nine evet·y after- noon. He is doing his best to cultivate a quick, snappy style of play in the infield. While there are a large number of candidates for the team it will in all probability be picked from about twenty men. Witbeck and Gris- wold will, of course, be the leading battery and it is expected that the latter will be the only man behind the bat. J\1ahar, a freshtnan, and Schroeder are the other leading candidates for pitcher, although Mallery or Parker might be called upon in eme·rgencies. Paige and Delaney from the law departn1ent and Crain are the calildiclates for first. The second baseman vvill probably be chosen from among Cook, Mallery and Heath. The position at short will be filled by either Mahar or Hulsapple. Terry, from the \'Law and Bunting and Kauftnann are the candidates for third baseman. The outfield will probably be picked from an1ong Parker, Schroeder, Raymond, Mallery, Carver, Moeller and Staeber. It must be remetnbered that these are only predictions for no one can tell but that a little mild weather will bt·ing out several surprises. ' Predictions of the nine's success are scarcely in order at so early a season, hut it looks 9n paper as if a strong nine tnight be developed. Captain Parker wants every man in college who has any hnmediate or future hopes of n1aking the nine out upon the campus every afternoon pro~mptly at the appointed time. !T11e co1nplete schedule of the nine follows. Son1e changes in it may beco1ne necessary if the subscription list is not imrnediately raised. April 2o-West Point at West Point. Api·il 24-:Schenectady State League at Schenectady.

An inter-class cross-country and track meet will be held on the college grounds Saturday afternoon. Light track and field games will first be held and then will come the cross-country run over a course of two miles or rnore. Points in this race will count according to the nutnber of entries, first place scoring the same number of points as there are entries, last place scoring one point. It is expected that this ''introductory\ tneet will be the means of bringing out a consider- ab 1e atnount of new track tnaterial. Every event on the progratn offers a splendid oppor- tunity for fresh material to exhibit itself. The management desires every candidate for the team to enter the conte~ts. 1 ~I

1 ~I THE CONCORDIENSIS. 7 B:QOWN-K~UESI WED'DING. Popular '98 Man Became a Benedict Tuesday Evening. Miss Emily Margaret Kruesi and Mr. Wayne Ramsay Brown, '98, were united for life at' the First Re~onned church Tuesday evening. (The ceremonies were conducted by the Rey. Dr. Sewall of Troy, a fonner pastor of the church, and the Rev. John Sheridan Zelie, its present pastor. A host of the friends of the happy couple were present at the church and at the reception at the Kruesi home which took place imtn.ediately afterward. 1~he church was handsornely decorated with itnmense palms and a profusion of Easter lilies. Tha bride was tastily gowned in a beautiful white satin dress, covered with tulle and orange blos:::;otns. ..... The ceretnonies at the altar were short and simple. The bride was given away by her brother, August H. l{.ruesi, '98. Miss Ger- trude Brown, the groom's sister, acted as rnaid of honor. Paul J. l(ruesi, r9oo, was best man. The bridestnaids were Miss Etn ma Batchelor and Miss Rose Batchelor of New York city, and the Misses Elizabeth W. Strain, Mary Schoolcraft, Olga Kruesi and Clara Kruesi of Schenectady. Messrs. William Morse Wilson, 1900, of Buffalo, Ralph Bradford, '98, of Arnsterdan1, and Edward Winslow Strong, '99, and Theodore B. Brown, '98, of this city, were the ushers) ,. The grootn is a popular young tna n of this city. He is connected with the firm of Peck- han1 ~tnd Wolf, lutnber dealers. He entered Union with the class of '98 but did not graduate. He is a metnber (i:)f the Chi Psi fraternity. P~OPESSO~SHIP FOR DQ. P:QOSSER. -\\ Charles S. Prosser, who was Professor of Geology in Union frotn 1894-'99, has been elected Professor of Geology and head of the department in Ohio State University. 1\'he fonner professor was Dr. Edward Orton who, at the time of his death, was one of the leading geologists of America. THINGS THAT MONEY CAN'T BUY. A college president recently sa,id in an address: '~College professors are rniserahly paid. The full pt~ofessor in a New York State college gets, on an average, a salary equal to that of a rail- road engineer, and an assistant pt·ofessor the same as :a firetnan, while an instructor is equally rewarded with a braketuan.\ Measured in dollars and cents this is probably true, but what does it prove? Supposing that the railroad m:en should even receive more than a college instructor (the pr·esident of a railroad usually receives more than the pr.esident of a college), has anything yet been pt·overl? Is the reward a coHege professor receives :to be judged wholly by the size of the check? Are the advantages of a college education all financial? President Patton, of Princeton, when asked the question, why a young man should go to col- lege, gave two reasons: first, that a young man should have a higher aim in life than mere tnoney-getting ; second, that a tnan should try to make the most of hitnself. Two somewhat similar reasons tnight be given in reply to the question, why a man should teach in college. Only in this case the teacher is trying to n1ake the most, not of hitnself, but of his students. Arnerican colleges are not money-making institutions. Every college in the country puts 1nore tnoney into the student than he pays in tuition fees and college expenses. The profes- sor who quietly declines the offer of a larger salary in sorne other institution and continues to teach in his aln1a mater, tnust find his greatest etnolument in his love for his work and the affection ot his students. For obvious reasons the financial side tnust, to sotne extent, be con- sidered, but a worse thing could hardly befall the colleges than that men should seek professor- ships for the salaries alone. The professor in the chair and the minister in the pulpit, who are there solely for the purpose of making money, have mistaken their calling! -Janles Melvin Lee, in the ''Saturday Evening Post.\ Princeton is to have a new gymnasium which will cost between $zoo,ooo and $25o,ooo.

The other con- ditions are the same as in the Ingham com- petition. SECOND JUNIOQ HOP. The second in the series of hops given by the junior class will be held in the Boat House Friday evening. The cotnmittee promises as good a dance as the last one. Gioscia will furnish the music and light refreshments will be served. The price of admission is $r .50. About one-fifth of the students of the U niver- sity of Pennsylvania are within fraternity walls. purpose of this conference was to give the newly elected presidents of the Student Asso- ciations a broader and clearer vision of the place, nature and scope of the work of the Associations. The conference was conducted by secretaries of the Student Department of the International Con1mittee, assisted by the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Mis- sions, state secretaries, general secretaries of Student Associations and secretaries of Metro- politan Student Departrnents. Or1 two afternoons of the conference separate section conferences were held for delegates from collegeb and universities, and from preparatory schools, in order that questions might be dis- cussed from the standpoint of these two classes of institutions. SMOKER AT PSI U. HOUSE. Psi Upsilon gave its annual smoker at its house on the last Friday evening before vaca- tion. JVJost of the metnbers of the faculty and a large nutnber of students were present. After stnoking and singing light refreshtnents were served. The guests departed at a late hour. HOLLAND SOCIETY ELECTIONS. The Hon. John H. Starin of the Board of Trustees has been elected president of the Holland Society of New York. Dr. Jatnes R. Truax is one of the new vice-presidents. A new dormitory has been added to the college buildings at Darhnouth, at a cost of $45,000. . I I I

. I I I THE OONCORDIENSIS. 9 CAMPU'S NOTES. Baseball subscriptions are due. J. F. Lansing, 'o4, has been eiected captain of his class baseball teatn. Gillette, 'o3, who has been ill with pleuro- pneutnonia has been compelled to leave college. \Trusts has been announced by Dr. Hale as the general subject for the ·extetnporaneous prize speaking. Fenwick M. Thebo was the Union delegate at the recent convention of the Delta Phi frater- nity held in Philadelphia. Dr. H. L. Towne addressed the tnetnbers of the local Y. M. C. A. on \First Aid to the Injured\ last Monday evening. The preli tninary trials for the junior and sophotnore oratorical contests will be held in the chapel next Monday evening. E. H. Rider, 'o3, who was absent ii·otn college last tenn owing to the illness of his parents, will probably not return. The sick roon1 of Meneses, 'o3, at the Ellis hospital has for the last few days been supplied with flowers by the sophomore class. The library building which Mr. Carnegie has prornised the city of Schenectady will be situated at the corner of Jay and Union streets. Dr. Towne will coach the baseball team throughout the cotning season. He is especially developing the 1nen in their ability to bat the ball. The current nnnor that Dr. Potter had before his death secured funds sufficient to cotnplete the Nott Mernorial hall, has probably no foundation in fact. Sophotnore officeholders . are as follows: Captain of baseball team, J. R. Brown; tnanager, R. C. Donnan ; managing captain of track tean1, V. J. Gallagher. The nun1ber of lectures at the Law School has been increased to three daily. This will give the instructors titne to cover their subjects tnore thoroughly than heretofore.

Candidates who do not -work or do not report for assignments need not expect appointments. UNION loses a devoted son by the death of Neil Gilmour-one who exemplified in his life and char- acter the true elements of manhood. When the alumni gather in June there will be very many who will miss his cheery greeting and hearty hand-shake. His presence was always an in- spiration. His interest in Old Union was never flagged from the day of his graduation until his death. Union men will cherish his memory. THE State Electrical School and Laboratory bill is dead in committee-killed by the strict p9Hcy of economy which is being rigidly carried out by ;Governor Odell. There was a Hme during the :session when the chances of passing it seemed very bright. High :political leaders throughout the state were enlisted in its favor,. and support can1e f.rom both parties. The biH, it is under- s~ood, would have passed both houses but it was deemed inadvisable to push it further in the face of the governor's determined policy,. as a prob- able veto might endanger it in the future. Its supporters are encouraged rather than dis- couraged and will hav·e it introduced in the next Legislature. liAS any U uion College man ever stopped to consider what might be made of the Garnet if it were 1~eally published as an University annual? We have our doubts. We in Sche1.1ectady are ratlier accustomed to think of the m.en in Albany as, after all, products of a necessary evil. We talk much of University feeling tllat should be, but we do little towards fostering that feeling beyond .holding a banquet or smoker <mce a year and occasionally paying the car fare of .a crack athlete from the Law or Medica1 to and from Schenectady. A recent conversation with a mem- ber of the faculty of one of the departments who is much interested in the promotion of University feeliFJ.g led to a revelation which is n(!)t surprising when the facts in the case are considered. The vevelation is this-unless existin_g conditions change, whatever support or patronage is now given the Garnet board by the professi()nal depart- ments will, in all probability, cease with the publi- cation of the Garnet now in preparation. But what is more surprising-when one co1nes to think of it-the average Schenectady Union man on hearing such a statement would ass urne an indif- ferent attitude and say-\Very well, let them withdraw. Who cares ?'' lie doesn't, very evidently. And yet he might, if he thought the n1atter o~er. He is the very same man who has been talking about University feel- ing. Perhaps he even thought enough of that feeling to attend the University smok:er in Febru- ary. Yet he must some time come b> realize that ! ' t' ~ ' J .,

! . t' J, : •I ., THE CONCORDIENSIS. 11 if there is ever ~o be sucn a feeHng it must be brought about by some practical means. What has been the relation of the professional school men to the Garnet during the past decade or more? Its rep~esentatives have had their pic- tures inserted in' the board pictures, the class lists and histories have been published, and the frater- ' success-it is in the honor he has brought his alma mater. The losing man, too, has his reward. He has helped the movement, he has put himself in such a position that the following year he can directly contribute to the success of the team. What Union man does not recall with a thrill of nities have received the usual allotment. Draw- pleasure Union's fortner prowess upon the track ? ings and literary articles have been solicited and . · What alumnus of a few years ago does not to this received to a greater or lesser extent. Yet no day sn1ile within him when he remembers that Law or Medical representative on the board has May afternoon when the team put up such a ever received a higher title than that of associate plucky struggle against the California men who editor. It seetns strange, doesn't it? Why shouldn't there be a change in the present system ? Why shouldn't the men from Albany be recognized to a greater extent in the make-up of the Garnet board ? The Concordiensis will dis- . cuss the matter further in another issue. It requests communications from Schenectady men in regard to the question. EACH man in college with athletic aspirations should realize the splendid opportunity offered him this spring to cultivate his ability upon the track and field. Mr. Wells, who has resigned his position in the General Electric Works to coach the team, is an athlete of no little ability and a man who thor()ughly understands up-to-date methods of training. He is especially proficient in the short runs, in the hurdles, in the pole vault and in the jumps, and is well equipped to instruct Union men in these events. If the candi- dates for the team start practice immediately and work earnestly under his direction there is no reason to expect otherwise than that their work will be visibly strengthened. The cultivation of proficiency upon the track and field has a greater reward than the conse- quent increase in strength, agility and health. Here at Union there is a distinct object in view. Every undergraduate wants Old Union to win the New York University meet and to regain the State League pennant which she has not held since Hamilton won it in the spring of '98. The track man's reward is more than in the praise and con- gratulation bestowed upon him for his individual composed the crack athletic team of the West ? And the alumnus of a Uttle later day feels happy when he thinks of how Union walked away with the State League meet of '97. And yet, with one exception-Kilpatrick-every tnan on those teatns \vas developed on Union's campus. The very fact that strong athletic teams have been developed here is an assurance that they tnay and cart be developed again. Anyone at all familiar with the situation realizes that poor track teanzs at UttioJt during the past three years have beer& due to tk1·ee reasons--first, an absen,ce of conscientzous train- ing anzong the candidates for t!ze team; second, an almost total indifference to t!ze tea1-rt's success among the undergraduates; third, the lack of a thoroughly conzpetent trainer and coach. The third defect has been retnedied. A practical man in track athletics is ready to do his best for the teatn. It now remains for the undergraduates to remedy the first two defects. Every tnan in college wlzo has the sliglztest ability i1z track or field everzts should i1n11tediately 1,.ealize his plain duty to !zis college. This is no tilne for false n1odesty or lazi- ness. Active training starts at once, and not to- morrow, next week, or the day before the New York University meet. Track subscriptions will be taken at the college meeting next Monday morning. Every undergraduate should attend and put down his name for every cent he can afford-whether it be fifty cents or five dollars. Let's have a track team that is a track team. Baseball subscriptions are due.

In all respects he was one to whom we may pay the deepest respect. As regeat of the University of the State ofNew I:..,.ork he achieved enviable distinction and his nat-ne will be eve1· associated with the most progressive tendencies oftl1e city.\ ' '60.-Neil Gihnour, president of the General Alutnni Association of Union College,, died sud- denly at his home in Ballston Spa, Sunday morning, March 31. Mr. Gilmour had been in poor health for a long tin1e and ha,O: been con- fined to his hotne for several I1l!Otiths •. His death catne suddenly without irnmediate warning. He died shortlf after breakfasting, at whkh time he was apparently in as good health as usual. Mr. Gilmour w~s always a loyal son of Old Union, for he was continually tnanifesting his love for his alm.a .f\Xater in practical ways. Comtnencetneat week always found hitn upon the can1pus, whetie he joined l1eartily in all the exercises. Last June l1e was elected president of the General Alutn ni Asso- ciation in recognition of his deV:otion to the institution he. loved. But a few weeks later disease incapacitated him frotn ftu;ther activity in business. The \Ballston Daily Journa·l\ contains the following account of his active and useful career : \Neil Gilmour was born at Paisley, Scotland, January 18, 1840, and was therefOtfe sixty-one years of age. He received in his n::ttive land a thorough ·training for college, corning to the United States when sixteen years of age and entering Union Co11ege, graduating with the class of I 86o. He worked his way through college by his own resolute eflot:ts. and for a year after graduation taught in the academy at Corning. He then came to this village and taught for several years in the Ballston Spa Academy conducted by his brother, Rev. J an1es Gilmour, at the san1e tin1e taking up the study of law and being admitted to the ba 1·. \He early identified himself with the Repub- lican party and has been a prot-ninent figure in the organizations of county and sl~te politics. In 1866 he was elected School Comn1issioner for the first district of this t?unty for the term of thl'ee years and again in 1872 el-ected to the satne office. \The legislature of the state in I874 elected l1itn State Superintendent of Public. Instruction and he resigned as School Comn:lissioner to assume the duties of that office, being the youngest man and the only one of f()reign birth I / .i

So satisfactory was his administration of the affairs of that important educational position that in 1877 and again in 188o he was re-elected to the position. ''On his retiretnent and during the tenn of President Arthui: he was appointed Registrar 6f the Land Office at Bisn1ark, N.D., resigning the office on the inauguration of President Cleveland. ''Returning to Ballston he accepted the appointtnent as General Manager of the Aetna Life Insurance Cornpany of the State of New York with office at Albany and continued with the company until I 896, and soon after resutned the practice of law in this village. \He was closely identified with the political and business life of the cotnn1unity, holding several public offices as stated and always with credit to himself and his party and for the good of the State. He was a director of the First National Bank, a trustee of the Cemetery Asso- ciation and also of the Ballston Spa Improve- ment Association. \He is survived by his widow and one son, Harvey J. Giltnour of New York. He also leaves two brothers, Allan Gilmour residing in Albany and a brother and sister in Scotland. \As a man an1ong his neighbors and friends he was admired and loved l?y all, his hearty and kindly greeting being but the outflow of a nature that was always ready to help a fellow being to the full extent of his power and ability. He exetnplified in his daily life the words of the poet he so loved to quote.= 'Then let us pray that cotne it may- As come it will for a' that- * * * * * * That man to tnan, the world o'er, Shall brothers be for a' that ! ' I \During his career in public life he was often in demand as a public speaker at all classes of meetings, political, social and edu- cational, and vvith his large fund of information and Scottish witticism he was ever an accept- able one. \By his death his family loses a kind and loving husband and father and the community an honest and respected citizen of sterling character and sound common sense.\ '78.-Lyman Sanford Holmes is editor of \The Standard,\ a weekly newspaper pub- lished in Schoharie.

The deceased sufrered from an attack of acute indigestion on Ma.rch 19 and had been confined since that tin1e. ,Com- plications ensued which resulted in his death. Mr. Simpson was a well known and popular young man, and had a host of friends. His courteous and ~ffable tnanner in the discharge of his duties at the post office made hitn a favorite with the public, and between hin1 and his fel- low etnployees there was a bond which was more than one of deep regard. Pleasant,. gener- ous and kind-hearted he won the esteem of all with whon1 he came in contact, and his death will be tnourned with sincere regret by all who knew him. Mr. Simpson was born in this city, was graduated from the Union Classical institute in I 885 and completed his course at Union college in 1889. He was a student of n1ore .than ordi- nary ability and for six years after leaving col- lege devoted hitnself to educational \Vork. Ill health cotnpelled hin1 to give up teaching and in February, 1896 he was appointed to the posi- tion he held in the post office. He was a metnber of Schenectady City lodge, No. 319, Knights of Pythias and of Scha·Jgh- naugh-ta-da tribe of Red Men, and was a com- tnunicant of Christ Episcopal church.

The com.Jnittee in charge of the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Albany Law school met Monday evening at the Law school for organization. It is intended that the exer- cises which are to ·consist of a historical sketch of tl1e school, addresses, etc., will take place comtnencement day, May 29. The school is atnong the oldest institutions of the kind in the country, having been estab- lished in 185 I, and its graduates num her many of the most successful men in the profession. The .school is and has been largely represented in the executive, judicial and legislative depart- ments of this and many other states, as well as of the federal government. It became a part of Union university in I873, and begins its fiftieth year as a law school with the coming scholastic year. During its long and successful career it has, in cornmon with other law schools, done much to demonstrate what was at one time doubtful, but is now accepted alrnost as an axiom, that a course at tl1e law school is a well-nigh necessary pre- requisite to a successful professional. career. Its instructors have always been rnen of repute and standing, both for professional learning and personal character. HONORARY COMMITTEE.

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS:. COLLBGE RULES IN 1818. Strict Discipline During the Early Ad- ministration of Dr. Nott. Union college students of today would be greatly surprised if the old college rules of the early part of the century were put into force again. The doctr.ine of 'ln loco parentis was then actively carried out, and students were under the strictest supervision of the faculty. A little pamphlet entitled \An Abstract of the Laws of Union College\ preserved in the college archives shows very clearly that students were obliged to live a tnuch more strenuous life then than now. A case of absence ot· tardi- ness from recitation or prayers, for instance, resulted in a fine of one cent for the offender. At the opening of the first term, the first bell was rung at 6:25, the prayer and recitation bell at 7 :35, a study bell at 9, and a recitation bell at I I o'clock. After dinner, study again com- menced at 2 o'clock and continued untilf, when an hour's recitation was held. Study started again at 7 in the evening. The titne for ringing the first bell and bell for prayers grew later until the beginning of the second term, when the forrner was at 6:50 and the latter at 8 o'clock. The third term s~w the students up every morning at 6 :zo, and in chapel prornptly at 7 o'clock. The laws which all students were required to obey are given below. I.

THE engagement of Miss Caroline Whitbeck of Schenectady, former high school pupil and gradu- ate, and Prof. Eddy of Union college is announced. -Cobleskill Index. Congratulations. THE announcement of the date and program of the annual Student Conference at Northfield is enough to warrant continuing daily work through- out the short season ahead. If men will only . realize that 'it should be unnecessary for the cap- tain and coach to be continually urging them to come out and work, the season will be successful. Earnest, enthusiastic work is the main essential in track athletics just at present. Lend your personal, enthusiastic support to the team. THE Albany Law School with the close of the present session rounds out a l1alf century of use- fulness. Her sister department of Union Univer- sity may well rejoice with her in her obstacles overcome, her victories won, and in the re111arkable success she has had in turning out distinguished members of the bench and bar, both in the state and nation. It would be a happy manifestation of the friendly feeling that is growing between the departments if the college undergraduate body should be 1i be rally represented at the exercises on the day of her rejoicing. THE usual word or two about cheering is neces- sary just at this titne. Everyone recognizes the value of enthusiastic cheering in a closely con- tested game. There has been more than one game ··on Union's campus that has been won out after everyone felt that it would be lost for the sole reason that the men on the side lines have braced up the teatn by their enthusiasm. Cheer leaders should be appointed at once, and systematic cheer- ing practised every afternoon. Another point. Visiting athletic teatns have always been treated fairly by Union men. We should see to it that the slightest infringement of this unwritten campus rule is in every case given in another column. The conference is al~ severely frowned upon. ways of great assistance to men interested in Y. M. C. A. work. It is hoped that Union will be well represented at the annual session. THE track gatnes held this week have plainly demonstrated that there is c0nsiderable athletic material in college which may be cultivated if it will. A number of new men showed up well THIS paper is strongly in favor of tnaking the Garnet an University annual in fact. It believes that if the schools in Albany were represented upon the board in equal proportion to the college, the support and patronage of the book given by the professional school men would fully justify the action. As the book is managed at present, 'i , . I

'i , . I THE CONOORDIENSIS. 11 no one can wonder that the Garnet does not sell in Albany. We in Schenectady cannot expect the men in Albany to purchase a book chronicling our own deeds and organizations and giving little or no attention to theirs. Neither, if we did give them such attention, could we reasonably expect them to support it if their representatives were not put upon an equal footing with our own. The Concor- diensis believes and will continue to ad vocate a system of G-arnet ~management which will have a professional school man editor-in-chief or business manager in his proper turn and which will attempt to give a larger account of student life in the professional departments. It believes that such a book would sell among those men and that if such a systetn were carried out the amount received from Albany advertisers would fully justify the enlargement of the Garnet. If 1903 n1en will take the trouble to fully investi- • gate the 1natter they will find these statements true. COLLEGE CALENDAQ. SATURDAY, APRIL 20. Baseball-Union at West Point.

He says in part: \One can readily understand ·why so many young people are attracted by the glitter of journalism. Newspaper work seems to offer a short cut to power. And there ts no n1istake about it, the reporter does wield the power~ Stubborn and controversial people may be led if they do not know that they are being ~ed. For every man or woman who wi'll ~ccept an editorial dogtna and swallow it as if it w;ere a dose of .tnedicine, there are ten -who will resent dictation, but who will deduce a judgruent from a news report, even though it may he biased and colored, thereby giving the 1·eal authority to the young man who legs around and, gets the ne\'vs. It is perhaps just as well that the thousands of young reporters who are slashing out ,copy in the new spa per offices do not feel the true measure of their respons,ibiHty and in- fluence, or they might atte:tnpt to convert the news colutnns into editorial col urnns, and there- by cuttail the real power of the press. BJ claim that a young n1an. who goes into journalisn1 intent on making a 11eputation and being something tnore than a mere amanuensis or copyist, tnust have a prompting tove for his work, a quick perception of what is to be seized on in passing events, and the ability accurately to narrate or describe on paper that which he has seen or which has been told him. \13ut these three essentials a1·e not provided by any college course. Any editor can tell true stories of men from the best Eastern universities, men with trained n1inds and well-stocked voca- bularies and a vast assortment of general knowledge, who were of no Yal ue in a news- paper office because they were not able to identify a piece of news even when it was lying in ft~ont of thetn and beckoning to thern, or perhaps because a critical self-consciousness prevented thetn frotn writing a sim pie, itn- personal account of an every-day happening. It cannot be said that such men are 'inferior' to the other me11 who fill the paper with valu- able and entertaining tnatter. They were not 'cut out' to be newspaper men. 'The sooner they get out of the vvork the better. \But when the beginner has the natural qualification and college training added he is the best kind of newspaper tnan. There is no othet· occupation in which good-breeding and a general smattering of languages, arts, the natural sciences, rnathetnatics, history and political economy count for so rnuch. In the

14 THEJ: CONOORDIENSIS. course of a busy year the reporter or the editor must deal with .a myriad of topics, usuaUy in a superficial manner, bnt he must have at least a rudh:\N.entary know~edge of tnany subjects. or he war tnisuse tern1s and prove hitnself a clumsy arnateur. And so the college tnan is cotnpetent to vn·1te intelligently on a hundred topics which are 'Greek to the youth who has a gratntnar sch0o:l training and the superficial smartness of the street. It need not surprise any one if, after the indefinite period of trying-out, the coll€ge tna n begins to get the more important assign- ments, and, year by year, forges ahead of his less fortunate associates, and either succeeds to a responsible editorial position or 111akes his neWSJJa:per expeTience a stepping-stone to work wh ieh is less arduous but n1ore perrnanent in its re w~.rds.\ INTEI~COLLEGIA TE.

The comtnittee of the Free Public Library Association, consisting of Willis T. Hanson, A. L. Rohrer and Alonzo P. Strong, appointed to choose a site for the new building, nJ:et last Saturday afternoon and decided on the college pasture site, just east of a possible extension of Q.uackenbos street. The price to be paid is $Iz,ooo. The difficulty of obtaining a suitable site on State street and a feeling that it would be better to have the building retnoved from the business section are the reasons for choosing this site. The developtnent of the college grounds ;tnakes the site not so far removed irotn the centre of the city as would first appear. The proximity of the new High School building is a decided point in its favor and moreover that l<>cality seems destined to become the intellectual :centre of Schenectady. The price for the site will. be paid out 0f the $I5,ooo check sent by the G.ener~l Electric Company to the committee last Thursday. The building to be e1·ected wiU cost $5o,ooo, a gift of Andrew Carnegie. The Cotn n1on Council will appropriate $5 ,ooo annually for the support of the library. It is believed that there will be an open com- petition for plans for the new building. The new building will probably be of classical style or of the style of the Italian renaissance. It will be a relatively short titne now \before Schenectady will have a free library eq·ual to that of any city of its size in the United States. Cornell and Lehigh have inter-fraternity base- ball gam~s. COMMEN:CBMEN'T APPOINTMENTS. Ten Honor Men Selected by the Faculty Prom 1901.

Chief Justice A11on B, Parker of the Court of Appeals to Honor Union. President Raymond tn~kes the pleasing an- nouncement that Chief Judge Parker of the Court of Appeals will deliver the honorary chancellor's address at the approaching com .. 111encem ent exercises. Judge Parker has always taken considerable interest in the wel- fare of the college. But two months ago he acted as one of the judges for the Allison-Foote prize debate. Union's honorary chancellor has always been some distinguished personage. Last year it was the Ron. Whitelow Reid of the ''Tribune\; in '99, Dr. Hamilto11 W. Mabie of the \Out- look,\ and in '98 Rev. Dr. Henry Van Dyke.

A co.rn- mittee consisting of Frederick W. Can1eron of . Albany, Horatio G. Glen of Schenectady, San1uel P. McClellan ot Troy, and Dr. Wtn. M. White of Amsterdam, is engaged in aN effort to locate all the graduates and secure their attendauce cotnrnencetnent week. The comtnittee has so far outlined a sirn _ple and inexpensive plan which still permits of · such expansion as the class desires. H·ead- quarters will be established on the hill and at j the Edison Hotel. An experience meeting of . the full class will be held at which each metn- ber will be expected to describe his varying fortunes during the past twenty years. Letters will be read frotn those unable to be present. In the afternoon H. G. Glen 'vill entertain t·he class at dinner at the Mohawk Club.

The material is in hand t<> expand this into a larger voltune if desired. A large number of favorable responses Julve been so far received to the com tnittee' s in vita.- tion. A few of the members have not been located as vet and the readers of the Conc()r- diensis are ;equested to aid the cotnn1ittee in its search.

[n addition to these courses, the School usually has throughout the winter a lecture each week on son1e topic of current archaeological interest by one or another European scholar of prorninence, and a .continuance of this custon1 may be counted upon, though no progratn can he announced in advance. The plan .of the School is not to burden the student with so many lectures as to interfere with what is of supreme importance in a region like that of Rotne, the objective study of existing monuments and other retnains or antiquity. 1' o assist in this study a considerable an1ount of time is also left free for excursions to places of archaeological interest in the neighborhood of Rome, and in other parts .of Italy; and in the spring the students are encouraged to spend a nutnher of weeks in visiting Greece and other archaeological sites outside of Italy. The annual course of lectures in Potnpeii and vicinity, and in the Naples Museun1, by Pro- fessorMau, has proved one ofthe 1nost in1portant and valued adjuncts to the work of the School. The fee for tuition in the School is $25 a year. This fee is ren1itted in the case of gradtJ- ates of any of the institutions that cooperate in the support of the School, atnong which is Union College. Two Fellowships in Classical Archaeology, of $6oo each, and one in Christrian Archaeology,. of $5oo, are a\\rarded annually, chiefly on the basis <>f con1 peti tive exatnination. rl'he exam in.- ations for Fellowships for the year r9or-oz have already been held : the exan1inations for Fellow- ships for the year 1902-03 will be held March 18-2o, 1902. Bachelors of Arts, or other petsons of rnarkecl qualifications, may be adtnitted as tnetnbers of the School on submitting to the Director (Via Gaeta. 2, Rome), or to the Chainnan of the Managing Con11nittee, Prof. Elmer 1'ruesdell Merrill of Wesleyan University, 11liddletown, Conn.,, satisfactory evidence that their attain- ments are such as to enable then1 to 1nake good use of the opportunities that the School offers.

A comn1ittee was· also appointed to arrange for a theatre party to be given in the near future. The fraternity is in a most flourishing con- dition, its n1e1nbership litnit having alteady been reached, and it is to be congratulated upon ~upplying a long felt lack in the social life of the school by bringing together at its public meetings, for pleasurable intercourse, 1nem bers of the Law department and represen- tatives of the other branches of the University's activities. THE WEST POINT TRIP. The gatne with West Point last Saturday had to be given up on account of rain. When the nine left for down the riYer the weather seemed favorable, but heavy showers set in shortly after its arrival. l\!Ianager Kline reports a small loss. A rain guarantee had been secured.

;· THE OONO'Q:BDIENSIS. 13 SCHENECTADY SHOULD DO IT. Editorial from Schenectady '\Daily Union.\ For more than a century Union College has had its home in the city of Schenectady, con- tributing Qirectly to the intelligence, prosperity and fair fame of the city. When a few yeat·s ago a proposition was subn1itted to the legisla- tut·e, looking toward the removal of the college to a neighboring city, it aroused the spontane- ous, vigorous and successful opposition of our citizens, showing their appreciation of what the presence of the college n1eant to Schenectady. Beyond this protest, however, little or nothing has ever been done to show that the city cared for the college. There is no building on the campus, no endowed professorship, not even an endowed scholarship, to bear witness to the practical interest of any citizen or citizens of Schenec- tady in the institution wb ich \vas for many years the chief glory of our city. It may be ques- tioned whether a })arallel to this can be found in aU the history of American institutions. Surely the time has corne to re1nove this reproach. No city in the state is today more prosperous than Schenectady. It ought to be possible to raise at once, and with little effort, a sum of tnoney to meet son1e one or 1nore of the most pressing needs of the college. There is no reason why Union College should not, under present condi- ti:ons, move rapidly forward. It only requires that a start should be made and who are so interested in effecting this as our own citizens? One of the n1ost evident needs of the college today is· better donnitory facilities. Until these are provided, students who tnight otherwise cotne to Union will turn to other institutions. A new donnitory building would prove a great attraction. It would cost, let us say, $5o,ooo. If this amount seetns beyond our ability, then let our citizens take up the proposition recently made to renovate and retnodel the South College donnitory. This will call for not more than $r5,ooo. That sutn is easily within our reach. Why cannot a corrnnittee be organized to carry the project forward? We believe that the class of '99 originated it, and began to urge it with youthful enthusiasm. While the members of that class are now scattered, we do not doubt that they would be glad to co-operate in every _])ossrible way with a local comn1ittee undertak- ing to carry forward this work. Something 5h ould be done and done at once. The Union invites suggestions and offers its set-vices freely to any undertaking that pron1i~es to :help the college. INTE~COLLEGIA TE. None of the colleges will follow the new baseball rules for 1901 adopted by the National League. The New York State Professional League has adopted the new rules with certain modifications. Columbia ·will soon have a cooperative store ~nder the general supervision of the faculty. 'The establishn1ent will sell books, stationery, etc., for the benefit of the students at a discount ~r frotn 10 to 25 per cent from the catalogue :prices. Cornell has a situilar establishn1ent. The students of Rutgers College have by vote ~bolished the cane rush. A suggestion that it l>e kept up with picked teams was also voted <lown. The comn1ittee of undergraduates sug- gested the adoption of the rope rush~ the teeth ()[war and the cane spree, but the question of a substitute was left over until next term. A nutnber of recent college graduates residing in Albany met last Friday evening and decided to fornl a university club. rrhe project has been :under consideration for sotne titne and last :Friday evening it was fairly started. A tem- J>Orary organization was effected and an exe- <;uti ve committee appointed to look after the <:letails of permanent organization. SCHENECTADY GAME POSTPONED. Rain prevented the game scheduled with the Schenectady State League nine at the Driving =rark Wednesday afternoon. It was postponed and will probably be cancelled.
