E VERY incandescent lamp has a fil~ment. Mount a metal plate o:n a wire in the lamp :near the filament. A current leaps the space between the filament and the plate when the filament glows. Edison :first observed this phenomenon in 1883. Hence it was called the «Edison effect.\ Scientists long- studied the \effect\ but they could not explain it satisfactorily. Now, after years of experimenting with Crookes t11bes, X-ray tubes and radium, it is known that the current that leaps across is a stream of \electrons\- exceedingly minute particles negatively charged with electricity. These electrons play an important part in wireless comnmnica- tion. When. a wire grid is interposed between the filament and the plate and ch~rged positively, the plate is aided in drawing electrons across; but when the grid is charged negatively it drives back the elec- trons. A very small charge applied to the grid, as small as that re- ceived from a feeble wireless wave, is enough to vary the electron stream. So the grid in the tube enables a faint wireless impulse to control the very much greater amount of energy in the flow of electrons, and so radio signals too weak to be perceived by other means become per- ceptible by the effects that they produce. Just as the movement of a throttle controls a great locomotive in motion, so a wireless wave, by means of the grid, affects the powerful electron stream. All this followed from studying the mysterious \Edison effect \- a purely scientific discovery. No one can foresee what results will follow from research in pure science. Sooner or later the world must benefit practically from the discovery of new facts. For this reason the Research Laboratones of the General Electric Company are concerned as much with investigations in pure science as they are with the improvement of industrial processes and products. They, too, have studied the \Edison effect\ scientifically. The result has been a new form of electron tube, known as the \pliotron\, a type of X-ray tube free from the vagaries of the oLd tube; and the \kene- tron\ which is called by electrical engineers a \rectifier because it has the property of changing an alternating into a direct current. All these improvements followed because the Research Labora- tories try to discover the \how\ of things. Pure science always justifies itself. er 1 tri General Schenectady. N.Y. 95·3?7Dj

THE ARCHITECT There are hundreds of young men in our colleges and schools who are inclined either by a naturally sensitive so-called artistic tem- perament or by association with those interested in the arts to look upon the profession o{ architecture or the practice of one of the other arts as an especially desirable :field .af endeavor. They acquire all appreciation, a responsiveness to things we call beautiful, and vaguv ly dream of achieving both material success and a distinct place m the community by following what they beg-in to speak of as their ideals. To such we o1ve much of the progress of the world in the way of creative things from the beginning of poetic expressions to the building of the Greek temples, the wonders of Roman construction, the aspiring spiritual work of the marvellous Gothic cathedrals, the beauty and richness oi the Italian Renaissance. But many are called . who have neither counted the cost nor really found themselves on the only road that arrives-the hard one of unremitting, patient, self- sacrificing \\vork. .. lviere aspirations oi an aesthetic sort are soon dissipated by the discouragements that belong to any worthy creative endeavor and manv failures are blamed on the world that began with the idea that ., in any art there is an easiest way. There's no royal road for the young man in our democratic times and we have been imbued with a very keen sense of the need for definite and well co-ordinated ideas for the accomplishment of any worthwhile results. -Architecture There is one who has battled for you, and he still W ate!'bury Republican Is paying a price that is dear; \Prohibition is certainly a Table Board for College rough· Students While you play he must work, never deal.\ lack:ng the will, Yes, I've given it a lot of sober MRS.

Manager Graham Jeffrey, '22, of Al'bany, is now at work arranging a schedule for t.he musical clubs for the coming season, more extensive than last year's, which included concerts in many of the nearby cities as well as a week's trip to New York, and vicinity, and a trip through the western part of the state and into Pennsylvania.
