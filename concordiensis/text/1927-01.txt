From the top of Lookout Mountain, near Chattanooga~ you may gaze over one of the finest panoramas in the country, andatthesametimeexperi- ence that peculiar thriH which only historic scenes can inspire. The answer~ you think, is obvious. You will leave mountain climbing to those who prefer a withered sprig of edelweiss to the most beautiful .rose from an old-fashioned garden; who would rather grasp an alpenstock than the hand of a friend. Perhaps, then, you do not know that the Otis Com- pany, which lifts men so easily to their offices every morning, is ready to lift you just as easlly to the summit of Lookout Mountain, on the Otis Inclined Railway. 0 T I S ELEVATOR COMPANY Offices in all Principal Cities @[the World '.

A Camel smoker goes straight to the point in cigarettes and demands enjoyment. For there are no better tobaccos or blending than you get in Camels. There is no other cigarette t~ste and fragrance that can co~pare with Camels, because they are rolled of tlte choicest T urkisb. and Domestic tooaccos grown. Ina ciga- rette, as in the smoker, there is noth- ing that can substitute for quality. If you want to know what ex- perienced smokers like, just try Camels.
