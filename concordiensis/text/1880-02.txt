The morning dew in the rising sun, Eetween the blue of the sea and skies, Reftected back from the water's brink The golden rays to the maiden's eyes. She sat alone in her little boat And looked far out on the \unknown sea,\ And sweetJy said, as she floated on, ''I wonder what is beyond fol' me?\ He, too, alone in a little bark Was moving quietly near the shore; His bark was good and his arm was strong, And he longed te voyage the waters o'er. How rough the journey he could not tell, N Ol' yet how far to the other shore, But knew too well, on the '' unknown sea,\ The storms would rise and the billows I'oar. And yet he lifted his <lrooping eyes To steer his course o'er the sea alone, :But caught a view of the other boat That drifte<l quietly towrud l1is own. He watched her pluck frmn the \Vaters deep A breaking bud and a lily fair; And gently plact>, with t?nchanting skill, Amid the folds of her chestunt hnir.

[Written for the CoNCORDIENSis.] HAPPY AS A QUEEN. '' Happy as a Queen\ is a very pleasar1t fallacy of childhood drawn fron1 fairy stories, in which queens and princesses are always living 111 clover and are the guardian ange:lls ~of the unfortunate. But, alas, ho\v \ ery dif- terent is the reality in regard to the li·ves and experience of queens as \Ve find then-. in the world! And the present n1on1ent is a very oppo r- tune one in; \V hich to pass thern in revie \V and learn how different is their real from their fancied history. And to cotntnence with the n:iost noted lady on the list, let us g aze a mon1ent at Oueen \rictoria. For the (-..J first time since the death of Prince Albert she has consented to proceed in state from Buckingham Palace to Westminster to open the Parliament with the brilliancy ot the old- en time. 1'his, it is said, has been done iin violence to her own feelings and sin1ply io show to England her sympathy w1th Disr·a- eli and her deterrniuation to support hirn. Since the death of the husband whom .sbe adored she has had no heart in her po.iti.~cal duties, and has vvithdra\vn trom thetn wi t.h an obstinacy that has at times been ann. y- · ing to a nation that has persisted in seeing . the royal cro\vn through a widow's weeds. The face of Queen Victoria is ever sad and : gloomy, and is seldom lightened up vv1th a . srnile except she hears pronounced the narne · of hin1 with w hon1 all her early love and hap- piness were committed to the tomb. She at • least is not as happy as the tracbtional queen of story. Her neighbor, the Queen of Belgium, has · been a hopeless mourner for years. All her · happiness was \vound up in an only son and · heir, who at the age of ten \vas ruthlessly snatched from her bosotn Just as he was bud- ding into the n10st pron1ising boy hood. When the lad took cherub's wings and fled away ali her happine--ss followed hitn and her bright and cheerful countenance becatne pale and downcast, while her rich hair quick- 1 y began to bleach with n1ental suffering. Since that period she is seen but little at Brussels. She shuns the court, is careless in her attire and given to a species of lethargy oi the heart only broken in upon \vhen she goes to console '\Poor Carlotta,'' of sad J\tlexi- can history, \vho lost her reason by the same bullet that reached her husband's heart on that sad day at Queretaro, \vhen so n1any bright hopes of the young pair \vere crushed. Queen Sophia of l1oUand, recently de- ceased, led a sad life betwee11 a husband that treated her vvith indifference and a son that \V::ts not worthy of her. ~he found her pleas- ure in books and study and becatne the friend of prominent n1en of letters of various nation- alities. Sotne of these, as our historian J\'Iot- ley, she invited to take up their residence at her court that she tnigh-t have around her an intelligent and critical society to rnake arnends fo.r the stupidity and worldly dissipation of her husband's surroundings. The lady \vho no\v bears the irnperial €rown of Russia is, according to the journals of the day, on her way hotne from the warm coast of southern France, where she has

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 67 been tarrying for awhile in the vain hope that the gentle breezes of the land of ihe olive, the orange and the len1on n1ight rest.ore her to health. But she has.more than physical ills to. contend with, and has no\v about given up the struggle against the indifference or neglect of her imperial husband, \vhon1 she has not seen for n1onths •and who seen1ed ready to ]et her die alone in a strange land. In tn id. \Vinter, therefore, she hastens to her northern palace to die an1ong her children, \vell knLYwing that another than she has for som·e tin1e \V0rn the real irnperial crown. For a\vhile she concealed the \Vounded br~east by \vearing on it the portrait of her husband, but it sirnply covered the wound.; nothing can ever heal it. Happy as a Queenr, Indeed ! Some n1onths ago, while driving through the str-eets of Ron1e, there passed us quickly a plain carriage bearing no appearance of royalty and containing a gentle and beauti. ful lady whom we scarcely had time to dis- cover \vas the loving and beloved Margarita, Queen of Italy. We have said \beli)Ved that is of all Italy, except of him from whom she has the right to claim exclusive love. Her sorro\v that she does not possess the heart of the K1ng of Italy has struck: her very soul and she is pining a \Va y into disease. Near the borders of the Mediterranean she is novv seeking the balm of life in the fresh sea breezes ; it is clear,· ho\vever, that she is sealed as the victin1 of incurable consump- tion. But she still retains her beauty and is dying gracefully. Her garn1ents aTe n1ostly of pinken hue vvhich covers the paleness of her face, and her rich black hair is usually adorned vvith purple flowers, \V hich are her fa v or1tes. And what a sad story is that of the late Spanish Queens! Two have been struck by death sin1ply as they \vere extending their arms to touch the cro\vn. · T'he Duchess of Aosta fled from Madrid in the night followed by the cries of a rnadden~d crowd, and she reached I taJ y to die of exhaustion and terror. The beautiful J\tiercedes, the child of but eighteen summers, had scarce:! y lived long enough to learn the sin1ple lesson of young love \vhen she \vas snatched frotn the side of :her boy husband and, beautiful as a rnarble statue, vvas laid a vva y 1n the -grin1 vaults of the Escurial. And HO\V lVIarie Christina of Austria steps in to take her place and put on a cro\vn of thorns. For scarcely had she as- sun1ecl the bridal robes before her trials corn- rnenced. At the very first drive taken in a carriage alone \vith her husband they \vere startled at the report of a pistol \vbich sent a ball vvhizzing by her bro\v that \Vas Uiltended for her husband's heart. Her nerves are so sL.attered by the fright that she n1ay possibly become an incurable epileptic, and now fears to leave her pala,~e \valls or have her hus- band go, lest death m_ight be some\vhere lurking for a royal victi 111. But of all sad and inconsolable mothers of the hour, who can be a greater sufferer than the Etnpress Eugenie of France? She is the very type of a lJ;Jater Dolorosa. She has lost her throne, her husband and her son--her last hope and support. How fearfu 11 y the dagger of the savage that killed her boy in Zululand novv rankles and festers in her poor heart! It has also robbed her of her tnatch- less beau tv-for even this has vanished under J her mental agony. Her face is pale and sunken, and her rich hair is \vhitening apace. The only joy no\v lett to her ori earth is the ·keenest of sorrow. She \Vishes to bury every earthly hope on that fatal spot \Vhere her br)y fell in deaJly conflict ·with the cruel foe, and she is 110\V preparing to n1ake a pil- grin1age to the spot that to her \vill be a shrine.
