I Earl Stri:::kland's Orchestra, the same that made such a hit last time, has been recalled by popular dpmand. This dance. from the ap- pearance of the program, promises to be even bigger and better than before. Not content with mere!~ an ordinary dance, the committee has added some of the best of campus talent to help make the \joint jump.\ Perhaps in your life you have had a gripe or an idea. but you had no way of letting people know about them. Here is the answer to your problem of, in someway. expressing your varied opinions. In this box you can not only offer your own per·sonal cri- ticisms. but you can also help everyone by perhaps. finding a solution to a campus-wide prob- lem. How would you like to wake up some morning and find your- self a campus figure in the spot- light of campus fame'? Now you don't have to be a rugged in- dividualist. and the hero of your football team. No~ all you need is a cool head in order to 1 eason out the solutions to problems which confront our college today. If you keep thinking about a problem you are bound to com-a to some conclusion. Perhaps your· conclusion will be just the solu- tion we are looking for. So remembe, the location of the box and drop your solution in the box. If your answer solves the problem you may even obtain an interview in the paper.

The idea had been rather hastily ·Conceived, and uniforms and equipment for the cadets were not received until after the armistice had been signed, and ·On!:,.· three weeks before the re>giment was dissolved on Decem- ber 30, 1918. During these four months the campus hummed with activity and a Y.:\LC.A. canteen operated in the Kappa Alpha house, and chow was temporarily served in the gym. There were calisthenics twke each day. and an hour of drill. The classe8. most of which were ord- ered by the army, were in some cases only a day or two behind the profEssors, to whom the> material was also new. Pt·ofessor Cline. present head of Union's English department and a member· of the training corps, in recounting his experiences, said that one of his most vivid memories was of the time he served as ser- geant of the guard posted over a prisoner. An army regulation re- voh·el· containing one cartridge was uc~idently discharged by the corporal of the guard. causing no lit.tle disturbance throughout South College.

More !ttlportant, however. was the lesson in coopera- tion between officers and faculty members and the correlation of military and academic work which those few ·weeks of e>xperience taught. ----0--- Town Meeting on Conservation Talk between a cotton business and di- recting and playing trumpet in the town band; his mother taught p1ano and played flute, trumpet, trombone, violin and guitar. His sister Norma is a pianist, his broth- ers Charlie and Clois are well known for their trumpet and drums, 1 cspecti vely. Jack's musical education began at seven, when he started taking lessons on baritone and trumpet, the bariton for blowing power and the trumpet In earnest. But the \'er·non town band had plenty of trumpeters and was short on trom- bonists, so on Christmas of the fol!owing year Jack's dad gave him a trombone. His arms were too short for any but the first four positions, but he could almost im- mediately manage simple hymns and marches. Jack's mother played organ in one .of the Vernon churches, and by the time he was ten Jack was accompanying her on trombone, Two hours or more of daily prac- tice. plus his band and church work, gave Jack a solid back- ground of musicianship. When Jack was 13 his father died, and the family moved to Chappell, Nebraska, where Mrs. Teagarden played the piano in a movie theater and Jack doubled on trombone and relieving the pro- jectionist. Two years later the Tea- gardens moved back to Texas, this time to San Antonio where Jack, at 15. joined his first orchestra. It was only a four-piece combination which moved from one roadhouse to another. but it gave Jack a world of experience. Jack continued to work around Tc>xas for the next three years, playing in more bands than he can ever hope to remember. At 18 h~ summoned his courage and went to Chicago, almost immediately getting his fir·st \name\ job. It was with Red Nichols. who was very near the top of the musical ladder at that time. With the band Jack attracted national attention for the first time. with his trom- bone solos on records made by Nichols. notably \Dinah\, \On Re- vival Day\-one of Jack's special- ties today-\The Sheik\ \Basin \The I of Conser- Street Blues\ and the tune which mportanre is now Jack's signature, \I've Got vation to :-lew York State•· will be the topic for discus- a Right to Sing the Blues.\ cing that he and his family will I take up quarters in the Psi U.

Jack Teagarden started his band , in the latter part of 1939 after ob- taining great fame while featured as solo trombonist with Paul Whiteman.

GRIDIRON BALL This week the Concordy, in following its procedure of first in news on the campus, carries the announcement of Jackson Tea- garden as the band for the Gridiron Ball on Saturday, Octobet· 7th. Needless to say, the Student Council, in conjunction with the In- ter-Fratemity Council, has put forth great efforts to bring Union its biggest and most exciting social event of the season. The com- bined groups are working together to in- sure a delightful and memorable evening, an affair that will live long in the memot·y of Union men leaving at the end of this term to take their places in the nation's war effort -be they civilian or Navy. October 7, then is a red-letter day on the calendar. The afternoon finds Union's grid- iron heroes pitted against their traditional foes, the engineers from R. P. I. The opening kickoff is scheduled for 2:30 o'clock and the last thrilling play should be over by five o'cloek, insuring four full hours before the first notes will come forth from Brother Teagarden's trombone. The joint committee is also planning additional entertainment by prominent local talent. All in all, October 7th, 1944, will be a day that you will long- remember. Of course, we do not want this to be the last of such memorable affairs. The powers- to-be will not permit the expenditure of funds fur similar purposes later if we all do not get right behind the committee and give them our support. AITang-ements for tickets are now being formulated and Chairman David Cohen, '-1i5, says that there will be an announcement next week in which all the details will be reported to the student body. In the meamvhile, let's get busy fellows. If your girl is lost in the ~orth Woods, send out your carrier pigeon now to be sure that she will kno\\' about the big event. If you at'e one of those bashful Xu vy fellows, we a1·e sure that the local USO ca.n provide datable girls. If you are a poor harassed civilian, here's some more good news. The Skidmore College girls will be back We have been given to understand tha.t the~· will have quite a group of eligible gals over there. For those of you who are not acquainted with this popular dance band, on Page 1 of this issue you will find a brief resume of the life of Jack Teagarden. Those of you who are hep-cats from way back, know all about him and this will be the opportunity that you have been looking· for. For those of you who always have in mind feminine pulchl'itude, Teagarden presents l\Iiss Phyllis Lane. N O\V remember, this will be the only big dance this semester, and in all likelihood it will be the only affair until next spring. For those of you who are attending Union for the first time this semester, this is the chance for you to bring- that girl back home up here to see the beautiful campus that has produced such eminent statesmen as Presi- dent Chester Arthur, William Seward, who was Secretary of State under Abraham Lin- coln, Undersecretary of Wat· Patterson and many others too numerous to mention in the brief space allotted. At the last big formal dance held at the college, various members of the faculty and disting-uished citizens in the city opened their doors and extended their hospitalitJ' to the out-of-town dates, affording them a place to sleep. Arrangements are now being- made by the committee to extend this service for the Gridiron Ball. Once again, we urge you, and you, and especiaUy you, to \get on the ball\ get a date, and be prepared to spend an evening that you will always remembe1·.

Pa:Imer has ann(mnced that he is very weH pleased with the re- sults of the \Torture Tests\ last week. The average score has been raised to 69.7. This is quite an in- crease over earlier tests. Note- wot:thy is the ·fact that there was not a t-rainee who tested lower than 55. There are only fifteen men who grunted -out scores between 55 and 60. There were 171 strong men who made scores of over 70 and an ad- dlthmal six scored over 80. This leaves a mere 158 men in the 60-70 bracket. Don \Atlas\ Blake of North Col- lege North, under the tutoring of \Big Nape\ Fritze, was 'high scorer f01' the period. The rise in virility · of Union men is also shown by the fact that there are only two main- tnance men who are still non- swimmers. These men both came in the March increment.

The way to make your vote felt in this poll is to write the name of the girl and what you nominate her for and drop it in Concordy's mailbox in the center of Wash- bum Hall. The g-irl who wins the \most\ contest will be invited to the Gridiron Ball and some lucky fellow will be elected to take her.

n is 13 ed in ds FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1944 Chi Psi's Slugging Defeats ColorfUl Scotia Marine Squad 200 Spectators Witness Contest On Library fi·eld Zangari and Goldstein Homer; Co·leclough Paces Attack With 3 for 3 Monday evening .found the skies over Library field da.rk and dreary but thanks to a colorful Marine softball team opposing the boys from the Chi Psi ship, the gray thanderheads gave way to a bright red t>ackground. Yes, the Marines· supplied the color for the game but the Navy boys gave oat with the runs and Chi Psi picked up a one run lead in the first inning and held on to it until the seventh, eking out a 5 to 4 victory over the Scotia \Leathernecks\. The game was played befm·e a large ct·owd and, though neither team showed the brand of ball that they were known to play previously, the breaks were s8 evenly scattered that the crowd was kept on its toes until the last Marine had faced \Wild Bill\ Fisher's delivery. Pitcher Granduski of the Ma- l ines, pitching a slow and steady game found his teammates falling into slumps in the fielding deJDart- ment and this accounted for two of the runs sc8red by Chi Psi. The Chi Psi boys took a liking to Gran- duski's slow ball and didn't find too much trouble in hitting him. Zangari and Goldstein, both taking mighty cuts at \floaters\ drove the fielders \out .of the park\ for two long homerun drives. Both home- runs came with no one on base. Colclough, Fisher, and Boyle ac- counted for seven of the eleven hits garnered by the Chi Psi squad. \Wild Bill\ Fisher found himself in trouble during the first three innings and then settled down to his usual style of pitching and from then on had the Marines \well in hand\. Fisher found him- self in the same boat as Granduski a& far as his support that evening. The Chi Psi boys played a slow game and their fielding was on the below par side of efficiency. The Marines tagged Fisher for a total of nine hits and it was a <\ombina- tion of these nine hits plus the slow playing of the Chi Psi team that allowed the Marines to push across their four runs. The Scotia club was spirited both at the plate and on the field by their hard hit- ting and fast moving first baseman, R. Mallory. Mallory lead his team in hits with a single and a double for the evening. Bilsby did a fine job behind the plate, allowing no Chi Psi runner to advance to second on a steal. Lt. lj.g.l Palmer, Lt. Ugino, M. C., and AI Ciampa, the men who made this game possible, deserve a vote of thanks for the effort that they put into the arrangements for the game.

SPfJI~T SHORTS Crusher l<eane The searching beam of the Sport- light rests this week on the broad Irish mug of one Robert B. Keane -\Crusher\, to you. These days, Union f.ootball en- thusiasts came away from the field deeply impressed by the ragged line play of a tall, long-legged tackle, all 1'90 pounds of whom stretch oat in a frame weH over 6 feet in height. This, of course, is the re- doubtable \Crusher\, whose name has become syn.onomous with all campus athletics froin the wrest- ling mat to the gridiron.. Bob's football fame goes back to his days at Fordham Prep, when he was rated a·mong the top tackles in the Catholic High Schools Ath- letic Association. His squad's suc- cess as league champions was due in large measure to his brilliant play, for three years on the var- sity brought him valuable experi- ence, and his naturally powerful build made him a mainstay of the fot·ward wall. The \Crusher\ was a first .string lineman on the Union '43 gridiron squad, that ghost eleven that never took the field. But Bob found out- lets for his athletic ability in the intra-mural tournaments that have flourished here during the past year or more. Three times he was the sparkplug of the softball club at NCMS, and, under his direction, the team last June copped the league pennant. In addition to his man- agerial duties, he was key man at the hot corner. and was a con- sistently dangerous man with the willow. Going back a little in the archives, we discovered that the finalists in the heavyweight wrestling division included this same R. B. Keane. Unfortunately, Bob lost out in the final round to a man who had been intercollegiate champion of the State of Oklahoma. Observers The Intramural Swimming Tour- nament came to a close Friday evening after a record number of entries had made their bids for lH,nors. The total number of con- testants entered was 203.

Tex is really hot on those keys, and yoU!' feet just re- fuse to behave when he stat·ts his beat. Still in the jivE> realm comes the Jitterbug contest. The committee still refuses to be responsible for in- juries. but it's worth a try. It's a chance for all you gates and dates to strut your stuff, so hop to it. There's a rumot· floating around that the winner will be excu!:'ed from P. T. for the next week be- cause of exhaustion, but nothing is definite about it. However. if you do get crippled, you won't have to turn out anyway. There'll be prizes for the winning couple. All this and refreshments, too. As before, all college stud!'nts are invited to attend. There is no charge of any kind for this dance, or for the refreshments. so there is no nason for not coming. Every effort has been made to make this dance something extra, but it needs your support to accomplish this. It's your dance, so be there on next Saturday night. A dancing class for studentfl wishing to learn to dance will be held beginning TueRday. for four weeks, it was announced by Mrs. Dixon Ryan Fox at last Wed- ne~day's Chapel prog-ram. The class, open to all Union students, is absolutely frl'e. The purpose of ti\is dancing elM-s is to enable students who cannot dance but would like to attend the Gridiron Ball, to learn in time. A teacher from the YWCA has donated her serv- ices and the USO has promised to supply a numbet· of girls equal to the numbPr of students in the class. However, because restrictions on space, only the first twenty-five applicants can be accepted. P. T. Schedule Lt. Palmer has announced a change in the physical training program to become effective on Monday, September 11th. The new schedule for the basic trainees will include two periods of outdoor boxing per week, one of cross-country, one of swimming, and one period on the obstacle course. The maintenance program will remain essentially the same; one period of cross-country or obstacle course, one of swimming and two of games. The cross-country distance will be increased by one half mile each week until a total distance of five miles is reached.

They float through the ~ur on dust particles until rhey reach a potential victim. And then they attack. A sneeze or a cough in a crowded class- room may start a \·eritable epidemic of colds, measles, or some other con- tagious disease. Now a new ultra-violet lamp, the General Electric germicidal lamp, promises relief to harassed school teach- ers, and death to many air borne germs. The lamp looks like an ordinary fluores- cent lamp. However, it produces germi- cidal rays instead of light rays. A spe- cial glass permits the passage of the germicidal energy produced by electric current passing through mercury vapor. While complete freedom from com- municable diseases isn't likelv to result from the use of these lamps,' they will help. During a recent epidemic only one out of eight children in a class- room where germicidal units were in- stalled contracted the disease as com· pared to OYer half in the unprotected rooms.

He would seP to it that the instruments would be trans- ported to anct from the field and that all the musicians would haw to do is toot. But again our spirited virtuosos voted in the neg- ative.

It is hoped that that organiza- tion will endeavor to display some initiative and skill that will send visitors away ad- miring the \:show\ that l'nion College is capable of giving. Then there is next year. There will be other games played in the vicinity. Let us make certain now that this condition wiH not re-occur. After all, is it tl1e purpose of the band to play only at Captain's Inspection and at Blood Donor Drives, OJ' is it a Union College band that will support Union College activities'? As to the cheering, the next three games are to be played at home. This wiU be an excellent opportunit~· for organized cheering which is an integral part of colleg-e football.

What kind of a cut system has Union? That seems to be the leading question in the minds of the many civilian students who received fmntic calb from distraught parents during the last two weeks in an effort to discover the cause of the Dean's present conste1·nation. Several men have uncovered their woes to find that they have the sum of ii-10 cuts when they were not expecting an~; uproar until they had reached their supposed quota of the num- ber of homs of courses tal<en. At the beginning of the accelemted pro- gram in Jul~· of 1943 it was the understand- ing of civilian students, who had been in- formed l.J~· their respective pi·octot·s, that one would be allowed the number of cuts per credit hours. Today the system seems entirely reversed and regulations f1·om the Dean's Office come issuing forth to an un- infol·med student body. We are told that we must not oppose colleges rules, but may we be bold enoug·h to ask where these tules ori- ~·inate? Seemingly new rules are formulated as every new and individual situation arises. Profs as well as students seem at a loss as to the latest developrhent in the cut system. Dean's list students have received these notices as well as the less fortunate. Please info1111 us. The students are more than slightly interested, their standing is at stake. NO COLUMBIA CHEERS The Dean's Office announced today that it would be virtuall~· impossible to give stu- dents their freedom the moming of Septem- ber 30th in order that they might attend the Union-Columbia football game. It was ex- plained that, with the courses accelerated as much as they are, if that morning were missed it would mean making up any classes missed on some other day. exams come on ~Ionday, Oct. 23 instead of Saturday, Oct. 21 (God f01·bid). In a nutshell, that is why it will be hnpos- sible for any Naval trainees to visit New York for the game. The civilians, if they wish to take advantage of the cuts they are supposed to have, will be al.Jle to attend. lt seems a shame that Union cannot have a decent cheering section for its biggest game, !.Jut Satm·day afternoons are Sattn·day afternoons and between term leave is be- tween term leave.

Part of the program will be broadcast over WSNY from 8:30 till 9:00 P. M. with Ed Flynn of WSNY announcing and acting as Master of Ceremonies for the entire show. Featured on the entertain- ment will be stan' of radio, stage, and night clubs, including the pop- ular Gene Graves, singing M. C .. Eleanor. 'f \Otis and Eleanor\ and Bill Banden, guitarist. Also starl'ing in the show will be Theo- dore \Tecldy\ Karis, dancer, doing the rhumba, tango, and samba. \Tedcy\ is well-known to many of the student <Jbody and earned new honors for hert:elf at last Tuesday's dancing cla~s. PeacheE' Owen.s, who won acclaim at last Satu-day·s NAC dance for his unimitable piano styling will be teamed with Jim Mac Adco, a fellow trainee, in a duet. \Tex\ and Jim will offer some real \down- beat boogie-woogie.\ Sonny and Agnes Wolfe will pre- sent a juvenlle act; Mrs. Alice Whitney is to read a humorous monologue: Betty Fitzgerald will give a lively tap dance, and Mrs. Alfreda Dupont will display the more E\eda:te and graceful soft-shoe dances. Ann Nelson will sing; also Mrs. Nellie Varon Anderson, accompa- nied by Ollie Yettra. While this program is exceptional, the U.S.O. is endeavoring to obtain also the services of Eddie Charett, magi- cian; Miss Helen Lynn, radio's golden-voiced songstress, and other outstanding entertainers. Dancing will be from the close of the show till midnight to the strains of Jerry Carroll and his orchestra. This orchestra is one of the oldest groups in this vicinity and probably the most popular; playing for clubs, parties, and dances. Carroll, who is himself the pianist, promises that his selec- tions wiil be adapted to the desires of the dancers. Mrs. Stewart has just announced that additional numbers have been added to the program, inclLding Helen Lynn, popular vocalist of a local radio station. Miss Lynn's sentimental song styling is known to most loc~l radio fans, so this will be an opportunity to see and hear her in person. Also added to the original show are the services of Frank D'Arm- and, concert piano accompanist. who will play for several of the numbers. It is still hoped that An- nette McCullough. national network singer who has been recommended for Philco Hall of Fame, will 'be able to appear and assist in the entertainment. Over a hundred of the loveliest Junior and Activity Hostesses have been invited to dance and assist in entertaining, and the pl blic is invited to witness a typical mili- tary dance at the U.S.O. During the evening an Honor Roll of host- esses who have served over fifty hours will be unveiled. Mrs. Stewart, U.S.O. senior host- ess, and Mr. Regnier, the manager, especially invite .all V-12ers to come and enjoy the most gala entertain- ment and military dance of the year during which the Center has been aiding servicemen. This is without doubt the most festive amusement presented in this area Saturday ·evening, so make your plans to be at the Schenectady u.s.o.

Wallace addi·essing the Freedom Forum in the Memori·a.l Chapel last Fricay evening. \If the United States can not consume fifty per cent more of goods and services, this country must take up the duck by exporting,\ the Vi.ce President stated. Mr. Wallace piC- tured a post-war pl'oduction of goods and services of $170,000,000,- 000 wltii 58.000,000 people employed. He estimated that 9,000.000 people would be on the farms and 3,000,000 Ill thP drmy. The Memorial Chapel was packed and a crowd was gathered outside when Vice President Walla.ce enter- ed during- the speech of A. J. Mc- Ginty, Area Director of the War Manpower Commission. Mr. Wal- lace wa~ escoJ·ted by a color guard fz·om the V-12 Unit. The Vice Pres- ident was greeted by a roar of ap- plau8e and the audience rose as he walked down the CPnter isle. Rev. Edwin H. ·wilson. Chairman of the meeting, greeted him on the chan- ceL The way to maintain full produc- tion, Mr. Wallace stated. is through free enterprise. \But I do not mean free enterprise for large corpora- tions to engage in monopohstic practices,\ he said. \I mean free- dom and encouragement to small businesses to get started and to operate efficiently. To make that possible. it may be necessary .to re- vb;e the taxation laws to aid be- ginners in business and to encoUJ'- agP risk capital.'' \ ... Knowing that we have the resources. the manpower. and the technology to have full employment after the war, full employment must still be an act of will based on an intellectual appreciation of the fact.\ explained the Vice Presi- c~Elnt. \ ... Full employment will not come automatically in this coun- try,\ he said. \Pa!'l of the problem is economic, part mu~t be based on planning. put is co-operation wit.h labor and agdculture, and part IS political.\ \ .. , We can depend to some ex- tent on exports for a time. It is hoped, however, that we have learned the lesson that we can not export without importing. Will we lend to the right countries in the right way? Will we raise tariffs again to restrict imports?\ How high, the Vice President asked, can America raise its stand- ard of living before furnishing le~d­ er&hip to rl'lise the standards of !Jv- in\' of other peoples. He pictured th~ prob!Pm as a moral question. Speaking of China, which he vis- ited t'ecently.

Will Colum- bia Win? It Seems So ! ! Some rlemented l!nion College undergraduate pinnerl the above notice to the \'arsit;.· Sports bulletin board, Thun;clay evening, hoping, no doubt, to build the morale of the football squad. Is this the Union Col1eg·e spirit'! We don't be- lieve so. itself is not lacking in pep and drive and that constructive criticism is always vvelcomc. Realizing the source of such tripe a.s was posted, the football squad has passed it of! as the inconsequenta.J ravings of a hvisted mind. As for the anoymous author of the note- am sure that the football squad would be \\'illing to meet him at any time in a short scrimmage. If the so-called \gentleman\ at whom this editorial is dil'ected has the guts to put his name under his next literary effort. it would be greatly appreciated. The team undoubtedly feels glorious with such spirit as this behind them after losing three heartbreaking games. Anyone who has watched the football team practice since their first session will realize that the squad THANKS TO S. B. S. We, of the Concord;-; staff. believing: that we speak for the student body, would like to extend our heartiest thanks to Sidney B. Smith for his enviable record at Union College. Those who know him like him and many of the colleg-e man's p1·oblems have found a sympathetic em· in the several Proc- tor's studys that he has inhabited. Always the chcampion of the student's interests, \Sid\-as the majority of us know him- has always been t·eady with constructive suggestions anct has always been more than willing to lend a guiding or a helping hand to auy of the numerous student ventures. Besides recognizing l\Ir. Smith as the ex- cellent librarian that he is, we want to recog- nize him as an excellent adviser and friend. .:\Iany are the times that we in the Con- cordy office have run up against problems . _ . problems that \Sid\ has obligingly ironed out for us. \Sid\ has become as much of a Union man as most of us ever hope to be. We make this statement in view of the line of action that he has followed . . . action that ilas always 'been to the advantage of t!te Union student. ln the past few months he has presented to the lnterfmternity Coun- cil the possibilities of a cooperative effort among the fraternities to buy supplies of al: kinds . . . His efforts in forming this propu::;ition have helped the Council to be- g·in with important past-war planning, so impt•l·tant if Union's fraternity system is to continue. This, however, is just the begin- ning, other events are too numerous to men- tion. All \Ve can say is Thanks, \Sid\, and t:be ucst of )uck to vou. :\lr. Smith has always been on hand in the Coilege Library to help confused under- graduates finrl information on subjects mng- ing from advanced calculus to the life of John Howard Payne. ::--;o subject has fazed him, whether or not the mate1 ial was avail- able in the college librmy. Those who have had research problems will realize this and their appreciation IS great.
