CENSORSHIP AND THE COLLEGE PRESS We were interested this week in a l'eport in the Lehigh University newspaper, \The Brown and White,\ concerning an article by Dean Neil Carothers of the College of Busi- ness Administratio11 there, in which the Dean has some uncomplimentm·y things to say about college journalism. The article appeared in \The College PublisheT,\ official national publication of Pi De-lta Epsilon, journalism fraternity, \vhich is edited on the Lehigh campus. Dean Carothers charges that, -wheee col- lege journalism is concerned., freedom of the p1·ess is constl'ued to mean freedon1 from re- sponsibility. He complains of garbled inter- pretations, malicious attacks, and outright indecency, concluding his attack with a hint that censorship lies in the future for college new.spapet·s unless they mend their ways. We do not pretend to be as close a student of college journalism on a national scale as Dean Carothers may be. We can only say that his reports of \malicious attacks\ seem exaggerated; the \g-m·l.Jled interpretatio·is\ may or may not be prevalent; and, as the Dean points out, \outright indecency\ is confined largely to college magazines, not newspapers. Nevertheless, we \Vish to deny th P Dean's charges of it·responsibility, at least as far as this newspaper is concerned. Almost every- one who knows ansthing a:bout newspapers, from President Roosevelt on down, now seems to recognize that the !.Jest way to l\eep something out of print is to tell the ne\vs~ papermen, with the 1·equest that they refrain from using the information. Fortunately, this doctrine seems to prevail at Union. In fom· years of almost continual questioning of college officials, the occasions on which we have been flatly refused information have been few indeed, and we t•ecall no occasion on which any member of this staff knowing- ly violated a confidence. Significant, too, is the coul'teous attention which has been given all editorial criticism of the college administration in Loth this nevvspape1· and. \The Idol.\ It is not sur- prising that much of this criticism meets little active response; that is another matter. The point is that publications here seem to have the 1·espect of the college authorities and we are grateful for this cooperation. It is true that it has been many years since The Concot·diensis waged. violent jour- nalistic warfare against a college administra- tion. Perhaps that has been a serious omis- sion on the part of this newspaper; certainly there are those who think so. Nevertheless, there has been scattered criticism a-plenty in these columns in the past four years, and almost always it has been treated with courtesy and respect. Both as regards its news and its editorials, this newspaper has been fortunate to receive respect from the important members of the college administration, but we see nothing unique in The Concordiensis. Rather, we think Dean Carothers must be chasing boog-ey-men and sugg-est that he look more closely into the effects of a fJJture censor. ship before he hints at its advisability. A PRESS AGENT FOR PRIZE DAY The tenth annual Prize Da,v, just complet- ed, may be the last for the duration; never- theless, we are ten'lpted to leave one thought behind for whoever may be in charge of the next one. tions this year; nevertheless, we are quite sure that more students would take part if the prizes and their worth we1·e impressed upon them earlier in the year. We would suggest that every instructor in a field in which there is a prize remind his classes of the prize several times during the course of the year, and that even' effort be made to see that The Concordiensis and the campus bulletin boards are supplied with in- formation concerning the prizes early and often throughout the year. A number of men, particularly members of the faculty, have cun1pluined with some won- derment that the students as a group take too little interest in the Prize Day competi- tions. We do not know to what extent, if anr, a lack of interest hindered the competi- UCRS Monday 7:00-Fred Waring 7 :15-Ten Inch Sides 7:30-Campus News 7;35-Dinner Dance Music 7:45-H. V.

V-7 seniors with just one more term to finis·h will con- tinue to graduation. V-1 pre-med- ical students will continue the pres- ent accelerated program set up to qualify them for medical school by January 1. Men accepted by Med· icaJ Schools may apply for a com· mission in class HV < P), but will resign these and become apprentice seamen on Jt:ly 1 and continue on this basis throughout medical school. This also applies to pre- dental students. \V-1 and V-7 engineers and all other V-1 and V-7 men now in col- lege will continue in their present field of study as already chosen by them. \Men classified as engineer spe- cialists will complete eight terms, or a normal four-year course. \Pre-medical and pre-dental stu- dents will complete the require- ments for admission to medical and dental schools. \All others will complete less than their full \four-year courses as follows: \Men who have completed, on July 1, five or six terms, will stay on to complete a total of seven. \\Men who have completed, on July 1, three or four terms, w_HI stay on to complete a total of stx. \All others will complete five terms here. \The qualifying test to be given on April 20 will be used to screen out those unsuited for further Navy officer training. Only men who will have (!ompleted four or \Students from other colleges will ·be sent here to enter t: pper- class courses in line with their previous major interest, as well as others who will enter the basic V-12 training program. \In general, it is expected that the total class, laboratory and preparation time will be 52 to 58 hours a week. It is not yet clear\ whether this applies to upperclass- men too. \As far as can be determined, these regulations will also hold for members of the Marine Corps re- serve. They may ·be sent to a few colleges, where there will be only Marine Corps men, or they may be sent in sma!I groups to train at the Navy colleges. \Men now in the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps will all be called to active service about two weeks after April 26, to enter basic train- ing. These men will be selected .for and allocated to Army Contract Colleges for further training on the \ba.sis of the A-12 test given here la.st weelt, other tests in basic training, and their academic record while in college. \Juniors in the Signal Corp re~ serve electronics training group will continue on an inactive status until gradt:ation, when they will enter active service and be com• missioned after a short period of tra:ining. However. they must con- tinue to pay their own tuition.\ Professor Fox said this informa- tion was taken :from a \College Catalogue for the V-12 contract colleges\.

Larrabee announced this week. Seniors will form in line under the direction of the Senior Mar- shal, George Anderson '43, at the west side of the chapel at about 10:40 a. m., with the head of the line facing the library.

Student Cot~ncil Membel's To Be ii'iducied at Program In Assembly on Wednesday Moving-up Day will be held as oril:dnally planned by the Student Council on Wednesday, April 14, and will ·be the last Daily As- sembly program of the year, George Anderson '43, president of the Student Body, announced last night after a conversation with President Fox. Although the fact that another program had been listed for the laE·t day of the· assembly calendar had given rise to fears that the Mo·.ring-up Day ceremony might have to be omitted this year, .Presi- dent Fox explained th!lt the other program had been listed by mis- take and that the traditional cere- mony could· go on as usual. Included in the .program will be the announcement of the new mem- bers of the Terrace Council and of the Garnet Key Society, the swearing in of the members of the Student Council .for the summer term, and the \moving-up\ cere- mony itself. Ordinarily, the program is ex- tended over the last two assembly .programs, with the tapping of Terrace Council men and the nam- ing of the Garnet Key members on the first day and the Student Council ceremony and the actual \moving-up\ on the second and final day. This rear, however, the entire prog-ram has been condensed so that it may all be held in Wed- nesday morning's assembly.

His first real break came when he was auditiOned for the post of soloist in the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church in New York and secured the position. His study a\broad was followed by recitals, concerts and radio work. For the pa>1 year he was judged \The most popular rna.Je singer of ·classical songs on the air.\ He has\ made two of the mos. t successful concert tou1 s ever r-ecorded in Australia. Mr. Crook.s appearance here was preceded by the Nine O'Clock Opera Company in a condensed· version of \The Marriage of Figaro\; Miss Dorothy ll[a}·nor, sooprano; and Arthur LeBlanc, \The Canadian National \Violinist.\ . Mrs. Antnony Hoadley, who wa.s m charge ~»f ticket sales for this year's co nee rts, said last week that the present series was as much a success as 1 ast y.ear's series. How- ever, Mrs. •H:oadley stressed the fact that with higher prices and ration- ing of gasoline many pepole could not afford t·o \attend such concerts thi~ year. Although the profits Wh!C'h are added to the scholarship fund will not be as large as last year, the series can still be consid- ered a finallcial success. This year•.s concert& were recom- mended by t.he Citizens' Morale sec- tion of thE Schenectady County War Counci.l.

Bob Plunkett, '4\6 recently elected presi- dent of the Council, presided at the meeting. Of prime ·interest to the Council was the problem of whether or not it could co~tinue as\ a student func- tion, although in curtailed foi·tn in the com.ing months when m~ny military and few civilians students will be at Union. Opinion favored continuing the organization by whatever 11::1eans possible until the college can get beck to normal. In connection with this, .c .Plunkett stated that the Navy will proba,bly not use off-campus houses and that t·herefOl'e tE1ey may continue op':!ra- ting in the .present manner. Some of the !rate mities that will be taken over announced that those of their me~bers \'iVho will be attending Umon plan. to rent rooms in town and live together as a fraternal group.

This newspaper and its staff have been faced with a numbet· of difficulties \\'hich, added to our own shortcomings, have been responsible for some of the failings appar- ent in its recent issues. Its successes have been due largely to the excellent cooperation of those to whom we would pay tribute. First, we would, if \Ve could, send a bou- quet in the direction of President Fox for two thing-s which have been invaluable to the present staff. Whether we have agreed, or do agree, with the various steps he has taken in administering the college, he has been unfailingly generous in supplying us with information essential to almost every issue and unfailing·ly courteous in response to our occasional criticism. Next, we'd order a lovely cm·sage for each of the many office secretaries for whom our staff membet·s have been persistent pests in recent months. They too have received week- ly visits with never-failing patience, and they have made possible much of the copy that found its way into this p·aper's columns. We'll send a boutonniere to Professor Gor- don Silber for long and careful effort with pen and red ink after each of our issues has appeared. His accuracy as a p1·oof-reader is truly uncanny, and we venture that not a dozen mistakes in a year have slipped by his close scrutiny. That we have been able to see our mistakes once made has helped pre- vent at least a few more from appearing in print. Similar decoration is due He1·b Houg-hton, too, for \Servicemen's Letters,\ which seems to us to have been an outstanding feature of recent issues, for consistent help whenever a dance issue was in the offing, and for con- tinued and fortunately un-chaplain-like solace in time of need. Masculine adornment is in ordel' for a: whole host of faculty men who have helped the staff collect copy. A few come to mind at the moment, including- Professors Ben- nett, Larrabee, ::.\Iale, A. II. Fox, E. S. C. Smith and Dean Garis and Sidney Smith, but there are others, too, to whom honor is due. A bright red poppy goes to Stanley Green, in appreciation of dance-time poems and con- tinued humor in the vein that is our particu- lar pleasure. Sincere thanks, and, as is all too custom- ary, little else, must g-o to the several mem- bers of the staff, who, since their departures for the armed forces became certain, have continued to labol' conscientiously and with- out much hope for advancement, in spite of the ever-present demands from other sour- ces. These men, as is all too often the case, have done a very considerable amount of work, receiving all too little of the credit. So, credit here goes to Ed Johnson, Jim Smith and their subordinates, without whom even the hard dying Concordiensis would have failed. Lastly, and pe1·haps with most emphasis, a military bouquet to Corporal Bob Hayner, a real newspaperman if one evet· lived, tha recollection of whose personality and ability has helped many an issue to press in recent months. Well, we haven't thanked everyone, but, as far as those mentioned ·are concerned- now we feel better.

The whole story can't .begin to be rold yet. But when it can, you'll be amazed at bow far plastics have gone in wartime, and how many new peacetime jobs they'll be ready to tackle afterward. O NE night Hirohito had a nightmare. He dreamt that Shangri Las were springing up all over and planes were swarming over him like flies. Perhaps that nightmare is nearer reality than his Imperial Nibs knows, For now, in practically no time at all, any open field, even though the ground is soft, can be transformed into a hard runway for American ·bombers that are starring on their way to make hay of enemy objectives. To turn the trick, special steel mats are laid along the field. By means of t·esistance-welding machines, steel bars a~e automaticallv stitched together to form these flexible mats, Guided by elecrronic rubes made by General Electric, everv stitch is accurately timed and placed, and th.e speed far exceeds that of a crew of hand welders. On some dark night, in a deserted spot, our army <::ngin~;ers will unload these steel mats, join- ing them into a smooth, solid runway. And presto! Hirohito's nightmare will become a grim reality.

If all the men are electrical engi- neers, additional instructors in this field will be needed, although in that case all the civil engineering star'f will probably be used. too. \This whole situation is still very much clouded\ Dr .Fox said, add- ing tha~ many final arrangements await further word from the N'avy. ----0---- Graduate Council Will Hold Spring Meeting on May 1 The spring meeting of the Grad- uate Council will be held Saturday morning. May 1, at 10 o'clock in the trophy room of the Gymnasium, it was announced this week by Charles N'. Waldron '06, secretary of that body. Among the items of business· to be transacted at the meeting are the allocation for college purposes of $1503 from the .Alumni Gift Fund · the voting of Alumni Med- als· the action on resolutions on the' deaths of Howard M. Cole '86, and Edward M. Cameron '87; the action on committee reports; and the report on the state of the col- lege by ?resident Fox. After the meeting there will be a luncheon at Hale House. Since the college will be in recess there will be no other events after the meeting. Dr. Waldron said that the spe- cial purpose of the meeting will be to learn at .first hand the outlook for Union and the role the Grad- uate Council S'~Jould play to aid the college In me~Jting the difficulties of the war years. ---o--- Glee Club Names New Officers at Banquet; Seven Men Get Keys William Lasser, '45, was elected manager by the Glee Club for the coming school year at their annual banquet held in Hale House on Tuesday evening, April 13. James Smith, '44, was elected assistant manager at the same time. No student leaders were. elected since it was felt that there were no out- standing candidates and it was ex- tremely uncertain as to who would return. John T. Dempster, '43, manager, announced the awarding of keys for three year's service to the fol- lowing men: Theodore Male, '43, Judd D. Grey, '44, Abram F. Moly- neaux, '44, Glenn Monis, '44, Clair C. Smith, '44, James E. SmHh. II, '44, and Elwood C. Starn, '45. After the .banquet, speeches we1·e made by Dr. Tidmarsh, director of the Glee Club, Professor Warren Taylor, faculty adviser, and the departing seniors. ---o--- Ten Seniors Receive Leave from Services At least ten members of the class of 1943 who have alr>eady entered active service will be present at the Commencement exercises this week- end. These men, all of whom en- tered active service in .the Navy late in March under the Navy's V-7 program, are now stationed at C<;>- lumbia University. Their Tank 1s that of .apprentice ·seamen. These men, who will receive spe- cial leave to be present at the ex- ercises, include Norman Fox, Ken- neth .Sharpe, John Douglas, Robert Groundwater, John Mann, William Wilkin, Parke Branson, George Lie- berman, Donald Quigley, and Charles· Keeler. Budget Estimates Are Proved Exact Average Stltdent Body Was Only Four Below Assumed Figure Despite War Losses In spite of the demands of the armed services upon the student personnel of the college during the past year, the average number of students dn atten·dance was less than five below that estimated in the college ·budget for the year, President Fox said this week. The budget was based on an ex- pected average student body of 685 men; actually the average was only slightly below 681. The presi- dent said that although the re- markable accuracy of the bud'get was a result in part of \good luck\ he felt that credit was also due to good planning, especially with re- r·pect to the arrangement of the accelerated prog1am, which al- lowed members of the Army En- listed Reserve Corps to remain in college. ---10•--- NEWS IN BRIEF Phi Beta Kappa Banquet Lieutenant General B.

M., and the other g1·ou.ps in the For the College The passing of the remainder of the class of 1943 from Union College will mark, in a sense, the end of another epoch in the his- tory of this institution. This class, unique anwng all others in this respect, has left col- lege gradually,-·15 in December, in smaller groups during· the second semester, and now 83 in this 148th a.nnua.l commencement. As each senior has stepped from campus to training station, the college has come grad- ually close1· to the day when it would be dominated by uniform.ed students, studying under military orde1·s. Now, as the rest of this class and so many other students prepa.re to leave in a body, the day is at hand on which civilians at Union will be in a minority. The1·e can be no deny- ing that the college will have to be run to fit plans set up by the Navy. The various b1·anches of this prog1·am will require such a complication of courses that few classes be- yond those set up for the Navy can be offered. This situation is not in the least disaster- ous for the civilian portion of the student body. The Navy's plan of instruction will be broad and varied, and a considerable number of courses should be available for the other students. Nevertheless, the college will be predom- inantly a Navy institution after July 1. In spite of the confused state of preparations as this is written, vve feel that Union is fortun- ate indeed to have been chosen for Navy training. Union will fill its role \Veil in this wa1·, and we know that the men sent here will benefit, not only from theh· Navy train- ing, but also f1·om the very fact that thei1· preparation for duty was taken at this col- lege. For TWo Professors If, as it seems, ::\londay's Commencement mal'ks a turning point in Union's career, a significant symbol of that change is the re- tirement of Johnny ::\larch and George Dwight Kellogg. :\Iuch has been written and said about these two remarkable educators, but what has impreS'sed us most in om· classes with them has been the \Vay in which both exemplify the broad liberal arts tradi- tion. What they have attempted to convey has been the essence of culture itself. Union could not ask these two staunch teachers to continue their work foreve1·, but it can and should ask its other, younger in- structors to try to catch a little of their spirit, the spirit of teaching, in the finest sense of the word. For the Class The class of 1943 has been privileged to re- ceive its education under utterly unreason- able and unusual circumstances. What has been important in the history of this class has not been the difficulties that beset its members, but rather the remarkable extent to which the class has been able to continue in the manner of other classes. It has produced its good men and bad, its scholars and its failures, its bl'ight men and bluffers, exactly like its 14 7 pt·edecessors, in spite of draft boards, reserve corps and de- fense jobs. A number of classes may come and go before the men of '43 can exchange navy blue and olive drab for the commence- ment-parade costumes which are the inalien- able privilege of every alumnus. N evert he- less, it remains for this class to remember, not the sudden departures of its members, not the physical examinations and three let- ters of recommendation, but the fact that it too painted the Idol, drank at Ton~·'s, cheered at AlexaHder Field, listened to the philoso\ phy of Johnny :\larch, and lived togethel', \sous les lois de :\linen:e\. ltecalling· this, its members can perform thei1· next duty for l'nion College, the eventual formation of a st1·ong, lo~·al alumni class. crs.:;ion moves, the FactlJ:t.y wiN fol- On ·receivi-ng word from the same cn·del' aS' above. low them, and will iake seats d•i- Gra·nd Marshal, the Faculty Mar- Places o·f assembly: Graduating t:ect.ly behind th.e students from shal will lead the Faculty !formed Class-in the Hale HoH.se Dining front to .back.

Chapel. One of these attributes, and one of the most important, we feel. can and should be The CollCordiensis. Although we have felt keenly its various failings in recent months, we feel neve1'theless that this ne\vspaper has played its part in l~:eeping the morale of the college on what has been a creditably high level. The experience of the 19-!2 summer term should prove that ext1·a-cul'l'iculm· ac- tivities in general, and a college newspaper in particular, are essential to any student body. There are a number of complicated prob- lems that face this newspaper if it is to con- tinue. Because of the weight of these prob- lems, provision has been made by the Publi- cations Board for it::; status if suspension is necessal'y. To clarify the report of this ac- tion, which led to reports of definite suspen- sion in several other newspapers, it should be pointed out that The Concordiensis will cease publication only when publication is impos- sible. Whether or not that will be possible can be decided only on the basis on condi- tions as the,>· are found to exist after July 1, and not now. Our confidence that this ne\vspaper will be issued until the day it is absolutely impos- sible is derived largely fmm the appointment of Jim Smith as chairman of the Publications Board committee on the continuance of cam- pus publications. He has the ability and the will to see that this institution finds its wa,>· into the best possible hands. For Ourself As this is written, we have completed om· last academic exercise for Union College. It seems to us entirely fitting that our work on this newspaper, begun so early in our cm·ee1· here and forming such an important part of that caree!', should continue to the very eve of our Commencement week-end. For us, as for so many of our predecessors, The Concordiensis and Vnion College have been very nearly synon~·mous. This newspa- per has been responsible fo1· much of the benefit we have received, and it has been either the cause or the excuse attributed to most of our failings.

So, just like patterns for paper dolls, the planners draw the parts to scale on paper, cut them out, and shift them around till ther mesh together in a manner very similar to a jigsaw puzzle. Retiring editors have written, almost to the point of exhaustion, of sleepless nights at a Concordy t,>·pewriter, of tired walk·s to! press, of the thrill of a newspape1· existence. Writing this last editorial, we can undel·- stand theil· desire to try t0 recapture the ex- perience that has been theirs.
