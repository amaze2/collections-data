The reason is simple, The Navy Fiscal Year ends on June 30th and a new pay account sys- tem is being placed in effect, and so all accounts must be closed. This necessitates addi- tional clerical work on the Dis- bur sing staff and thus the delay in pay day.

A couple of weeks ag·o, the inh·amural softball league was started. Its purpose was to provide healthful exNcise fo1· those stu- dents who like to enjoy a good softball game. Gl'eat interest was shown in the leag-ue and those of us who participated in the games del'ived much enjoyment from them. Now, since most of the games have all·ead~· been played, a little backwm·d glunce over the league's success seems appropriate. Whenever students meet in a gm11e, there is a competitive spirit between the opposite teams. This spirit is not harmfuL On the contrarr, it is high]~· recommendaclJle, In fact, games lacking- it, hold little interest for anyone. It helps to spurn the players on to greater effort. Ho·wever, there are times when this competitive spirit lJecomes exces- sive, arguments flare up, and considerable tension develops. This condition is highly de- plorable, and something- should be done to avoid it. It is tl'lle that competition may at times be very keen, that the winning of a certain game may mean very much to one of the teams, that the decision of an umpire seems disputable-but never should the fun- damental rules of good sportsmanship be violated. After all, it's only a game. Nobod,v should take it too seriously. If the players showed n little bit more sportsmanship, both sides would undoubted- ly enjoy the games more_ The old custom of cheering fo1· the other ~eam after a game, might well be reinstated. It might help to clear the atmosphere from the tension of competition that developed during the game and p1·event unpleasant afterthoug·hts. It's such a simple thing, and yet, it may do so much to make the games more enjo~·able for all that it is indeed worth while doing. So, lww about some chee1·s after a game'? We all like a good softball game and we like to fight hard to win it, but when it's ove1·-no matte1· who won-the rivalry should be forg-otten and comradeship substi- tuted. The whole purpose of a game is de- feated if the playe1·s pal't in a mood of dis- satisfaction. Let's look at the reason behinci the whole thing! It's only for enjoyment! It's no fight fo1· life and death. \\'hat does it matter if the \other team\ wins'? As long as it is a good game, it is a success. Let's face it in a more sport~· manner and let's have some cheers aftenvards . No game is reall~· complete without them. AS TIME GOES BY When our new Skipper, Lt. Andreen stated that he was open for complaints at any time, the student body thought it a great idea. We feel that if the Adminish·ation body of the college would take a similar attitude on this problem something- of a beneficial value can be accomplished benefiting both Navy and Civilian students. We feel that this is im- portant enough to warrant full cooperation from all responsible as it pertains to the mat- ter of Tli.\IE. In the condition of the school today, time is a very important element to the Navy and Civilian alike. EveQ·thing we do is based on this essential value. A. schedule based on the clock and bell system as it is today can not be run efficient]~·, The afternoon of 31 ::\Iay 19-U, we decided to run a test throughout sewral lmildings to ascertain the incorrect- ness of .:he bells and clocks. It was found that the clock atop }Jemorial Chapel \Yas the only clock thal agrees \Yith Radio time. How- evel' the periods began four minutes earlier than usual. This is not too serious in the afternoon but in the moming classes beg-in- ning at 0830 a four minute diffe1·ence may cause many to be marked late. WE FEEL THAT THE CLOCK IN THE NAVY CHOW IIALL SHOL'LD BE CLOSER TO THE CORRECT TL\IE THAN IT WAS TODAY. THE SEVEN ::\IINUTE DIFFERENCE IS STRETCHING A POINT TOO FAR We hope that the authorities having control over this situation will take immediate action so that the matter will not be shelved along with several other items. LETS TAKE THE SCAFFOLD DOWN! Almost a year ago a scaffold was erected on the eastern wall of the Memorial Chapel and some repairs we1·e undertaken on the building. When Winte1· came, the repairs stopped. A. long- time has since passed and no more work is being done, but the scaffold is still standing· undisturbed. Is it that the work is not yet completed, or is it that the workmen have merely forgotten to remove the scaffold? In either case something should quickly he done to clear the Chapel from these unsightly boards. They are an eyesore to every visitor of the College. Not only the Chapel, but the entire campus suf- fers in appearance from this neg·Ject. If some more repairs are necessary, let's have them done quickly, so that the scaffold can be re- moved as soon as possible. The boards eel'- tainly do not add to the attractiveness of the ChapeL We all realize that at present there is a sho1'tage of labor and an over-abundance of work at Union; however, the removal of these few hoards would require only little effort and could be done in a few minutes. If the repairs are already finished, or for some definite reason cannot be completed, and the scaffold has merely been forgotten, every further day that it is permitted to mar, the wall of the Chapel \Vill mean ridicule to 1 the campus's appearance and the College's efficiencY. With the commencement exer- ... cises and alumni day so nea1·, every effort should be made to have the College look its best. A little oversight like this may do I much harm to the general beaut~· of the 1 grounds. I -----------------------------------------------------------------1 B~U·Y THAT EXTRA WAR BOND NOW!

Herb Houghton has announced his resignation and will retire to the comparative peace and quiet of Albany to await the Navy's call. Yes, Herb is leaving, he is going into the Navy as a Chaplain, he hopes. He may end up as an Ath- letic Specialist Ol' Machinists Mate though, you never can tell what The Reverend Is going to do next. When he first •appeared on Union's campus back in 1939 he was mis- taken for a member of the entering Freshman class by several students I and one instructor. Says Herb, \The joke was that I took the in- structor for a freshman, too,\ In his first meeting with Union men, at the Annual Freshman Camp on La!{e George, Herb led the boys up Buck Mountain in record time of 52 minutes and went swimming in Lake George three times a day. Since then Herb's day has been a whirl of action and work, striving to pt•omote religious interest on the campus both formally and infOI'- mally. Applied for Navy In his own words, his \office will always be open to any student who wishes to talk to me\ and countless Union students have taken advantage of this fact. Orig- inally in the rear of the Adminis- tration Building, his office was u·ansferred to Bailey Hall this year. In civilian days Herb taught a class in Modern Religious Issues that was very popular. In fact, every- thing that Herb did seemed to be popular. The Reverend Herbert R. Hough- ton came to Union to take over a new ·position, manager of the Chapel and all its responsibilities. It was a difficult task but Herb handled it well, helping out Prexy in daily chapel and Sunday Chapel, helping out Elmer with the Choir and Glee CJu·b, doing everything and anything to help out. All in all he's done a wonderful job. A few months ago Herb applied HERB HOUGHTON School Calendar 'V-5 Activitie_s I uated.

When, howeve1·, the student body joined in a clamor against this decision and the \Concordy\ sponso1·ed a campaign to retain this favorite sport, a re- consideration resulted. AI Ciampa was select- ed as coach and the first call was announced. The team was quickl~· organized, and, in spite of poor weather which prevented early outdoor practice, SfJOn started out with high hopes for a successful season. Now, at the end of the season we can look !Jack with pride upon ou1· team, w-hich, IJuilt up out of an entil·el~' disorganized and motley group and hampered by circumstances, held itself ag-ainst a powerful opposition and gave them a hmd fight. Perhaps some of us were disappointed when the victories did not come in as had IJeen expected. But when we con- sider the hardships that Coach Ciampa must have overcome to even send the team out on the field, we must praise all those who were associated with the team for their ef- forts. In the early days, when everything looked black and skeptics predicted a quick abandonment of IJaseiJall, there was enough enthusiasm and spirit to get the team in shape and to hold it together through the season. Now, at the end, although the team was not very successful in obtaining victo- ries, we know it was still a success. It would have been very foolish not to have had a team. Traditions like having a baseball team should be carried on at all co:.-;t. What would college life be without tradition:_.;·: Some of us thought that we should not have a baseball team IJecause of lack of enough experienced men. But how aiJout next year'! These men that played this season will form the nucleus of next year's team if they are still at Union. If we had aLolished baseball now, we would never have players with experience. There m·e also othe1· reasons for having a l>aseiJall team. The spil'it of sportsmanship is upheld through it. Those of us who were on the team have g-ained many experiences of working with othe1·s in close cooperation and of fail· play. These valu.es are hard th oiJtain in othet· ways. And then the actual pla,ving is a value not to be neglected. Physical training, necessar,v as it is, is seldom enjoyable if it is of the monotonous type. Games, like IJaseiJall, com- bine exercise of a high type with actual en- joyment and satisfaction. Thus at the end of the season we wish to thank the Administration for enabling us to have oul' basebail team. Everyone wanted it, everyone anxiously watched its progress, and everyone enjoyed it. The team showed that it had a:bility and perseverance. They put on a fine showing-, and we salute them for their tireless efforts and good sportsmanship. To Coach Ciampa belongs praise for \making the most out of little.\ To the other members of the Athletic de- partment goes the creddit for supporting the team and keeping the field in shape. All de- serve praise for a job well done. B~UY THAT EXTRA WAR BOND NOW! his port and cleaning the window or the 25 th. If you live approxi·, panes.

FRIDAY, JUNE 9, 1944 5 Cinder Squad Finally Brings Home Bacon -- ~~-- -· --·- · -- ~ -- -- -----~ Garnet Fells Middlebury THE BILGE PUMP Weeping Willie Smiles As Track Coach Bi:H Ketz himself p~1t it this week, \Well we've finally stopped the character-buildil'lg and won a track meet \ which statement sums up anything further we could say ~bout the unfortunate Dutchman cinder squad. Joe and Walt--Tops Whether the Garnet wins or loses, it seems as if we'H al- ways see those two guys, Ricciardone and Sheard, on the top of the heap in their respective departments in the tracK summaries after a meet. Both have copped first place in all of the three Dutchman meets so far, and n0 0ppo!ilent has come near enough to touch either of them with a ten-foot p<Jle. Witho1:1t detracting a b~t from the credit due to Walt Sheard, one of the best pole-vaulters to hit Garnetville in a long time, we think Joe Ricciardone's feats are without a doubt the more spectacular of the two. Joe never tossed a javelin before in his life prior to the current track campaign,· and has been performing in true professional style with the spear. In the first meet his distance was 158 feet, in the second meet it was 150 feet, and in the Middlebury tussle last weekend he flung it 152 feet. Jess Perkins, second in command to head cinder mento1· Bill Ketz, revealed this week that both Joe and Walt have done much better in practice than the meet tape measure indicates. Sheard, pole vaulter extraordina1·y, has hit 12' 6\ in practice sessions which is hot on the heels of the coUege record for that event. Silent Joe, on the other hand, hasn't neared the javelin mark as yet, but Jess and Bill Ketz still have high hopes for the stocky spear-tosser. Big· Timers Now It looks as if two Garnet basebaHers who have their hearts set on big-league baseball after the war are getting started up the ladder where they belong. The two in the spotlight are Teddy Fuchs and Mule Haas, pitcher and first baseman, respectively, of the current Garnetville club. In ordinary times these two, recently signed by the Am- sterdam entry in the New York State League to play when the c0llege diamond campaign is ended, would by this time have been well on their way to professional baseball. Although absence of pay will mark the major difference between their participation in semi-pro ball now and in pre- war days, the experience they'll gain with the Amsterdam- ians will be something which couldn't be bought for any amount of money. Cham peens Congats to the M.S.N.C. intramural softball squad, who walked off with a decisive win from Phi Delta Theta and the intramural crown, too. Behind the invincible hurling of Art Schmitt, the champs waded through all their opponents but two, when they were downed, but they somehow managed to keep their heads above water and come out on top. Sick Ba·y Boasts Flashy Softball Club; Challenges All Campus Teams Boasting an aU-star lineup of¢-------------- some eleven men and a cheering section, the Sick Bay softballers this week beat their chests and offered to take on all comers at the diamond sport. Lost to Chi Psi So far their record hasn't been what you'd call \first rate,\ but, as one of their number puts it, \We're just gettin' warmed up!\ They took a lacing at the hands of the Chi Psi squad the other night by the close margin of 13- 12, but with their spirits un- daunted they claim they're open for all competition. Roster Listed Listed on the roster of this ag- gregation :ll'e such names as: Frey, who covers the hot corner, Sulli- van, on the receiving end of the battery combination, Nagel, who . 10ams the central pasturQs, Hertz, covering the initial sack, Shelley, a shortstop, and Steckman, who patrols the right orchard. Also in there battling are Rati- can, combination pitcher and short:fielder, and Dillon, a second baseman. Chiefs Marvin, Rowen, and Seward, are also numbered among the Sick Bay Zephyrs. Open for Games The Zephyrs are open for any and all teams Qn the campus, either Navy ot· civilian, who'd like to challenge them, says \Boats\ Rati- can, spokesman for the softball crew. 1c 4r: ~ -+c ic -+c Malee an Appoin.tment For A Blood Donation FOUR BARBERS.
