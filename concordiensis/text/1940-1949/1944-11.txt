The efforts and sacrifices which both American civilian and military personnel have rnade during the past three years l::\as fut·ought us nearer to an- other day of victory. Every indication, however, points to the fii·ct that there is much fighting ahead. This term the input of trainees in the V-12 Program is small in comparison with what it was a year ago. According to -plans, there will be no further input into the V-12 Officer-training program. Therefore, the tra-inees who are here now are numbered among the last group of young men in Amer- ica privileged to have the chance at being commissioned via the V-12 Program. Even though you, as trainees, are now engaged in the less dramatic aspects •Of war and no doubt are at times bored by the eternal day- by-day sameness of study and class- work, physical training and drill, you are nevertheless particularly set apart for future preference and a heavier responsibility than .others of your age group in this country. You should strive to be worthy of that preferred status and that future responsibility. I hope that all trainees in this Unit on this Armistice Day anni- versary will dedicate their mental, physical and spiritual resources to the best possible training of all their powers so that when the day comes that they assume the status of commissioned officers •of the Navy, they will be fully prepared to assume the duties and responsi- bilities as well.

In The following members of the I l November 7, 1944 To the Editor of the Concordiensis: j We enthusiastically welcome two kinds of new stud~nts a~ we open the ~econd term of this year. But 1 l't'ally they are but one kind of stu- 1 dents- young Americans anxiouf' to prepare themselves for more effec- 1 tive livi_ng for the benefit of theit• country and themselves. The sail- or~ will eventually be civilians, and many of the civilians will even- tually be soldiet·s and saHors; all of us want to be conditioned and equipped to do all we can for our generation. =. The thirty civilian Freshmen we1e selected from an application list of fifty-four. We can almost say that this class represents the better half of those who had high school dipl()mas and wanted to come. This speaks eloquently of standa+:ds maintained in war time; feWI-;.,@>bl- 1 leges today will show as careful a selection. When educational institu- tions for men face deficits, it takes courage to be careful. I have talked with all our thirty Freshmen and I am proud to be associated with them in their education. The new Navy V-12 come by transfer from other colleges. We want them to feel immediately and completely at home. Union wants to serve their interest as qualified defenders of American principles; and we hope that, later on, as they look back, they will be glad that fate (as represented by the Bureau of Personnel) bt·ought them to our campus. Two Freshmen and five other civi- lian students have borne the heat of war and are here as veterans. We are especially glad to have a hand in preparing them for suc- cessful citizenship. We believe they will like it best if we accept them as \regulars\ without segregating them in any way fr-om their com- panion students. At the same time we thoroughly realize what they have been through to save a great America for us, and want them to feel our special gratitude.

Tide A FRESH START \\'e of The Concordiensis, at the begin- ning of thi·s new term, are desirous of add- ing- vur compiiments to the entering men, i.mth NaYy and ciYilian. Pnicm College is no longer a civilian institution, uor has it been fol' some sixil'L'n months. We do not say this in sad retmspel'i l.mt only in an atten1pt to make clear to lJoth gmups that Union is a nnited institution, free fl'Om group distinc- tioll and prejudice. This paper is, in that smm' light. an organization nmking an hon- est attPmpt tt' present the Vil'WS of the stU- dent body in a way that wiH interest that student lwei~·. This organization is one with equal rep1·esentation of IJ0th of these promi- nent groups and its nmnag·ing- btJard is like- wise divided. A.t this time, at the beginningo of a new term, we makL' the following pledges to the student bod~·. \\''-' pledge to represe11t the opinion of the student populace to the best of OUl' ability, m clem, concise, and honest tenns. \\' e pledge to establish an editorial policy '·: suggestion, critic.ism and pmise, honor- ~::~ any of ~ hP:-;e :ts wr see the necessity \\' e pll·dge to in wstigate and accept, as we st'r:> fe<tsibll', all ..;uggestions and criticism that mig·ht arise fl'Om interested readers, when presented to us in the form of a writ- ten and signed statement. \\'e pledge to present news and opmwns that we feel of interest and of concem to the student body, and do this by the fastest methods possible. Finally, we pledge to present to you a newspaper of mature quality, that we hope will cmTespond to the supposed maturity of coUege students, and to give you a newspa- . p~1· representative of our best effort, one that we hope will please and satisfy you. These pledges are statements of our pol- Icy that we can enforce only with your co- opemtion and assistance. The C'oncordiensis is a student newspa.per-your campus pa.per and your organ of expression. We need cap- able, hard working men who will be willing to accept responsibility. We have now what \:;e believe to be a good staff. Unfortunateb· that staff must be larger to give you the paper that we want and that you want, the paper that we have just outlined. l\len of all courses and classes m·e needed to help. All who have a few extra hours a week are urged to come and see us and work with us. As much as we need these working men, we also need a cooperative student body-a student body that will ans\ver when called upon, that will act when inspired. This type of spirit is necessary to make Union a pleas- ant and busy place in which to live. Only this way can we keep student activities alive- the <~ctivities that sparkplug all of college life in these tedious times. Let's go, fellows! Let's make the Union spirit one for every college to envy and respect. Let's get off to a fresh start and make this tenn an impor- tant one. WELCOME VETS There are several veterans in our student body. The.se retuming- service men have com- pleted their contribution to the war effort, and are now enjoying theii· due by claiming- t'ducatiomtl privileg-es as gTantecl b.v the \GI Bill of Hig-hb\. They are the dimmest shadow of what will happen in the educa- tional institutions of America. The \GI Bill of Rig·hts\ provides, in effect, a college education for any veteran desiring it. It is interesting to speculate on the re- sults of thi::; leg-islation. We believe that our colleges and universities will be swamped with applicants within four years. These ap- plicants will be of more varied and diverse background than eve1· befot·e. Boys who might never have considered taking the time and mone~· for can·ying· their education past high school \Viii seriously consider attending college and using their degrees as the toe- told with which to start scratching for a liv- ing. They \Vill be more serious of purpose than are the usual undergraduate body. Those who have survived combat wiil have a knowl- edge far beyond their years. When life is pared down to the essentials of survival the trimmings are seen in relief. They will have dete1 mined which of these trimming-s is must desirable, and will p1·oceed to obtain them. .i\len who have not served overseas will not take as desperate an attitude about the nec- essity of having these trimmings. N everthe- less, they will attend our schools with a ma- ture attitude and goal. To some of us they may appear scomful and unfriendly. Bearing- in mind the above facts and the idea that at first our leisurely life may seem strange to them, we should have small difficulty in understanding what- ever aloofness we may encounter. We must evaluate these men on their scale, for ours is different. Their expedences are suffi- ciently divergent from ours so that we must search to find a common ground and make these men welcome to the school we hold so high.

In his first year at high school, he held down the left-half- back post on the freshman squad while tipping the scales at 114 pounds. Don never tried out for other sports in high school but was a standout on his class basketball t earn, which captured s.chool honors for three years. Ma tick cites as his biggest sports thrill the occasion when back in high school Amesbury was facing a Massachusetts reform school. Don ·was appointed game captain and got his biggest thrill walking out to shake the opposing captain's hand, Imagine his surprise when he found that the reform school 1 epresentative was an old home- town pal and schoolmate. This year Don came out for Union's grid team unheralded and unknown, but it wasn't long before his line plunging and bone-crush- ing tackling came to the atten- tion of the coaching staff. The opening game against R.P.I. found Don holding down the starting fullbaclt post and giving a credit- able performance.

Fast-Bt•ealt Offense Perkins expects that his new fast- breaking offense will require many fresh players throughout the games. Fur this reason he has used various combinations to familiarize the men with each others' style of play. 1f the Dutchmen require it, they will also use a system of set plays. It was announced thiS' week by Athletic Director \Hal\ Wittner that one more home game has been added to the Garnet '44-'45 cam- paign. He said that the Dutchmen wiil face Cortland State Teachers on December 20. Cortland, inciden- tally, is where Chief Marvin played his basketball. Another home game is with Wo!'- ccstcr Poly on January 26. This game was previously omitted from the published schedule.

Dr. Bennett Dr. Bennett, addressing the Coun- cil in the capacity of the Chairman of the Faculty Committee for the Sixth War Bond Drive and the Chairman of the Council on Stu- dent Affairs and Student Relations, asked for aid from the fraternities in the administration of the War Bond Drive. He then asked the fraternities to take an active part in the postwar planning of fraterni- ties by offering suggestions on the problems that the Committee on Student Affairs and Student Rela- tions have presented. The problems presented were the College's re- quirement of a house mother or a proctor, delayed rushing, non-resi- dent advisor and the collection by the College of all room and board. Post 'Var Plans Dr. Bennett said that this was thP most opportune time in one hundred years to make improve- ment in the present fraternity s)·s- tem. He said the Administration did not wish to force anything on the fraternities but would rather settle the problems with the full C'Ooperation of the .fratcrr.~ities. He said the house mother or proctor would act as a councilor for the student and the fraternity, al- though a-t Union this would not be as necessary as it might be if the fraternity houses were spt·ead throt ghout the city. Dr. Bennett believed that delayed rushing would be an asset to the College ·because it would furthez· class spirit, some- thing which has been Jacking at Union as compared to other col- leges and universities. Under this system the freshmen would Jive in a freghman dormitory for a year before being rushed. This might also lower the number of students dropped in their freshman year. The most important pi,oblem, Dr. Bennett said. was the proposed col- lection of all room and board by the administration. This would stop stuuents from incuning overdue bills in their senior year, saving the fraternities money and finan- cial distress. Closing, he asked the students to bring to him any sug- gestions which would help the committee in finding the solutions 1o these problems.

It is youth that fights wars-but seldom causes them. Students today are fighting. ::\len who prepared themselves for a study of law, medicine, or perhaps even theology are now shouldering a gun. The~· Five years have passed since those faithful Czech students died. At that time, Evil was on the march-today Justice's victory is as- smed. True knowledge will triumph. That is why International Students Day has today a special meeting. The students of the world have seen their unity in purpose-they all want knowledge and the spread of human- itarian principles. This is the student speak- ing-no radical, but youth, unbiased as ;yet from the fascist and reactionary intellectual filth-freedom-loving youth, broadminded ;.·outh, strong youth-the youth of America -the youth of the world!

CONCORDY·s PLEA that 979'r of all war casualties can be saved by the use of this plasma, It's very simple and painless to give blood. Just call the Blood Donor Center, or go down there and ask fot· an appointment to donate blood. Navy men must secure permission of Commander Case. This may be obtained during sick call. If you have never given it before, you can rest assured you will not be inconvenienced, and that the. procedure is simple and pleasant. If you have given blood before, and your two months between donations has elapsed, give again . . NOW. Last \\ eek's Concordiensis issued, in our lead editorial entitled \A Fresh Start\ a statement of our g-oals and ideals for the new term. We made the statement in that editorial that none of these ideals could be reached without the full cooperation of the student body. Only now, as our second edi- tion goes to press, do we l'ealize the full truth of that sentence. Our new staff slimmed down to mo1·e or less of a skeleton force as assignments were handed out. Of course there is the usual number of old faithfuls who, in an attempt to further their own experience and to aid the school, are always present with their contributions. But these men alone cannot prepare the first-rate newspaper that we so desire. Today we make a second request. A re- quest for all fellows desiring to make a favor- able record for themselves and to support their Alma l\Iater ,to volunteer theit· services to this traditional institution~that we are sure everyone would miss-the Concordi- ensis. We are not asking for expedenced men or English majors, but. instead, are ask- ing for men who are willing to work ... and occasionally make a sacrifice or two ... for the benefit of Union's student activities. Not so many terms ago it was considered a privilege to work on the staff of the Con- cordiensis. We, the active members of that SKATING To the Concord.v this week has come several mentions of the possibility of a col- lege skating rink. These queries have been made merely in quest of information. We have been able to give but little information in answer to these questions, but if we may be allowed, we would like to present our suggestions. In the pasts, before wartime conditions prevailed, Union had a hocl\ey team. That hockey team had access to a rink on the south end of Graduate Council field which was established by vote of the Student Coun- cil. At that point the Council had access to certain funds delegated to them by the Finance Committee, but those funds are no longer available. Union has much talent within her boun- staff, still consider it so. We enjoy Olll\ work and we enjoy our contacts. We find the work tough, but inspiring. We are now working- on a plan that will, we think, be appreciated by every reader of the Concordy. With this in mind ... we come to you. Monday night, at 7:00 P. l\I., in the Stu- dent Activities Office in Washburn Hall, there will be a meeting that will include every man that writes for the Concordiensis. To that meeting we invite all newcomers. We are inviting hard workers who are searching for ways to help the college and themselves. If that includes you, then come, and you will be welcome. If you desire a wide FERRo•s RESTAURANT 1115 BARRETT STREET awake and good looking· newspaper then we ~;;;;;;;;;;~;;~;;~~;;~ ask you to be present. ~ A Greek philosopher once placed men in three classifications: Lovers of Wealth, Lov- ers of Honor, and Lovers of Wisdom. After classifying all men, he placed at the top of the list those Lovers of Wisdom. That is what we are doing in this appeal, To all Lovers of Wisdom and Hard Work, if Union's walls surround any such men, we issue this plea. The student activities that we have tried so hard to keep alive need your assist- ance. Expelience with student publications is held in high esteem by nearly every type of emvloyer ..• so it is to your benefit as well as ours. The Editors. RINK? daries-much talent that lies dormant. We would suggest that this talent be proug-ht to the foreground in the form of a benefit show, at some available theater or other suitable spot. Is there no V-12 dance band this term, or are there no possibilities fo1· such a unit to be organized? Are there no outstanding individual instrumentalists or performers in the student body? We doubt these things and we believe that a first rate benefit show could easily be arranged, per- haps by one of Union's self governing bodies -either the Student Council or the Inter- • fraternity Council. Certainly this movement would be to the advantage of Union's population aHd would provide many hours of enjoyment and exer- cise during the long winter months.

I I FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1944 BILGE :PUMP INTRAMURAL FUTURE BLEAK According to various sources in the gymnasium, the intra- mural spGrts ca1:d will be- pretty barren this winter until the basketball season folds up. With Mel Hein and Al Ciampa on leave of absence until March, Athletic Director Hal Witt- ner is ratl;ler short-handed in the instru.cting department. It has been rumored that Jess Perkins will take over the intramurciil Czar's throne untH the \Champ\ returns, but he's got his hands fuH with both basketball coaching and swimming. instruction on the program.· While talking to Jess this week, we inquired about an in- tramural basketball toarney this winter. He would like to have a round-robin tournament, if there is any tournament whatsoever this year, instead of the 1·ather brief elimination type program run off last winter. However, the whole thing is sb·ictly .a question mal'k so far. CIVILIAN BOWLING A novel idea in the form of a bowling league including all of the civilian dm·ms is gl'adually taking shape under organ- izer Phil Sottile of the Sig Phi House. All house managers are urged to consider the project and if favorably inclined to notity Sottile as soon as possible in order for him to find out if such a plaa is workable. It would be strictly an iHfor- malleague with games run off one night of each week. THE 62% STRONGER CLUB Grunts and gToans, the likes of which haven't been heard around ivy-covered Alumni Gymnasium since the first V-12 contingent arrived at Union in July, 1943, have been piercing the atmosphere around that hallowed institution this week, the source of which is the unlucky civilians who are now struggl.ing .side by side with the Navy trainees to keep up with the steady-roar pace of Chiefs Sewards, Marvin, and Rowen in gym classes.

This week the Sportlight casts its beam on that S'talwart Garnet gridder, Walt Short. A native of Syracuse, N. Y., Walter was born there on October 17, 1923. He at- tended Nottingham High School where he gained fame as a foot- ball, hockey, and lacrosse star; On the grid team, Walt capably held down an end post. Came the War, and Short found himself in the V-12 Unit at Clark- son .college. He1·e again our hero displayed his athletic prowess, holding down first string posts in football and hockey. As a gridder, Walt forsook the end poSJition in favor of the blocking back post. It was while playing for Clarkson that he experienced hit~ greatc.:;t sport thrill. This came when thP Engineerg traveled to Walt's home town to engage with the Orange of Syracuse University in a grid- iwn battle. Although Clarkson lost the game, it was a high point in Short's athletic career, for not only were all his hometown friends in attendance, but it marked the first time his parente had ever seen him play football. Walt began the '44 grid campaign as a blocking back on the Gar- net squad, but a shortage of heavy linemen forced the big lad into an unfamiliar position, the guard Glot. The opening game against R.P.I. found our Sportlighter play- ing 60 minutes of football at his new position. He was a standout on the Union line which played Also foreseen with the Unit re- duction was the transfer of Ath- letic Specialist Frank Litras, since he had been the last of the Naval personnel to arrive at Union. This left the school with no swimming coach, since Jess Perkins hii.S been assigned to the basketball mentor's slot. However, even though swim- ming and track have been dropped the school does intend to ca ny on basketball this winter and baseball next spring, Union's last swimming team was the 1943-:1:944 equad. which dropped five matches and gleaned no wins. Although the Garnet had an ex- cellent coach in Chief (now Ensig-n) AI Irwin, they couldn't come through.

At any rate, that was the figure through July of this year. General Electric is building three- quarters of the drives for the high- speed tankers ordered by the Maritime Commission since the United States entered the war. Speed of the 6,000-hp rankers is better than 15 knots, the 10,000-hp ones can do over 17 knots, both are considerably faster than a submerged submarine. General Electric first built turbine electric drives for the Navy in 1909. Chief advantages then and now have been speed and efficiency. In wartime, these are especially important. Tankers must travel fast to keep up with the swiftest ships in the fleet, keep ahead of enemy subs, and utilize their carry- ing space fully. The new high-speed tankers move fast enough and are sufficiently armed to run free on the long treks across the Atlantic and the Pacific. They no longer wait for convoys.

Magnetic Recorder Acquired by College for Later Use as Teaching Aid Union has recently obtained a magnetic wire recorder, which is · able to record \on the spot news\ and to b10adcast this news to our student body. W. R. S.

Last evening, while one of your frustrated editors was racing to his campus .abode in fmntic search of a misplaced news story, he happened to notice a very in~onspicuous little envelope, addressed informally to him, slyly pressing it's presence to his notice the mo- ment he stepped through the door. In his wild fury as he dashed to and fro in search of a stray piece of copy paper, he happened to excitedly rip the envelope to shreds in search of the expected inclosut·e. Inclosure there was, . and to his startled eyes, dazed by the hal- lowed. Ffhe Dean's tranquility was shattered, but the the end of his daily journey-the journey to insanity. Fearing deception he damned his fellow students for leading him astl'ay, and then, his :nose for news forced his conscience to make what he thought would be a fruitless p·hone call. The call was to be made to our own esteemed Dean Ga1is. Dean Garis was not at home. Another call fol- lowed. The Dean's tra<~,uility was shattered, but the editor's mission was accomplished. Fearing a change of heart or some other disastrous blow, the call was promptly severed.

(' LET'S GIVE OUR SUPPORT I Last Monday a new bond drive was start- ed-the sixth war loan. It was inaugurated uecause of the immense need of money for financing the war. The previm1s calls for financial support of the people had not been enough. As long as the war continues, \Ve must buy bonds. The 1·esponse of the people in follo\ving the governrnent's plea to buy bonds was al- wa~·s very good. Each new drive superseded tlw prPviqu:.; oiH' in ib achievement. Now, a new drive is unde1· way. Let us mal;:e sure that it mil top all records. The need is now g-1 eater than ever before. The war has as- sumed immense proportions. A gigantic ma- chine is in opemtion-money is needed to support it. It is up to us to do it. In the last year, the war has assumed a much more favorable picture. Germany is on the verge of defeat. It cannot be long be- fore om· troops and those of our allies once and for all destroy the Nazi regime. How- evel·, til i:s should not make u:s over-confident and negligent. There is still another war to ue fought. J~cpan, all equally formidaule et1el1l.Y. i~ still ramping in the Fm· East. A long· task is still ahearl if we are to oust him from his unlaw fully acquired possessions. His stl'iking- power must be broken. The Far East must be freed from the \Rising Sun\. Our war effort must not lessen lJefore final vic- tory. A slow-down now will mean many years of additional fighting. It will mean more casualties for us. It will mean a greater cost m money. A. quick war is our aim. The short- er. the less costly. Therefore, our full sup- port-to the limit of our ability-is neces- sm·~·. Xo one is expected to contribute money to the government. A war bond is no contri- bution. A wm· bond is a loan. A loan that will be returnect 'dth interest. These loans are necessary to the government. Fo1· us, no loss is mvolved. Investing in wm· bonds is one of the wisest things a person can elo. The main re-ason is, of course, that it is helpful for winning the war. It iR the one easy way in which everyone can show that he is supporting the war effort. Investing your money now is also a means elf preventing inflatioN. Next to losing the war, the losing· of the peace is the greatest threat. A stable money economy after the wal' must lJe insured. There is ha.rdly a better way than by investing in goverHment lJonds. There is no risk involved when one in- vests in government boads. The one institu- tion that is absolutely safe is the United States Government-it is backed by every single American. The1e is no safer invest- ment. r\ good rate of i'nterests is paid on all bonds. The investor derives direct benefit from his investments. Also, ten years from now, 'vhen the bond has 1·eached maturity and is returned plus one-third of its initial value, the income will iasure future security. No one has to fear the future if he can rely on war bonds. At the present tirne many luxl!l·ies and also many necessities are off the marl<et. When these products reappear in the post- war period, the money fr.om war bonds now will furnish the purchasing power. ln a few days it will be the 7th of Decem- ber-the thi1·d annivel'Sary of Japan's attack on the Pearl Harbor naval base in Hawaii. Let us show that we understand the meaning and significance of that day. These inhuman forces must be eradicated from the earth. There is no room for them in a humanitarian wol'id. They must disappear. Om complete and united effort is necessary to accomplish this. Let's shm\· our determination by buying lJonds, by an ~dl-oui support of this sixth war loan drive! MONEY TO BURN One does not intentionally throw away mane~· into the streets if he has been able to retain actual control of it for a while. However, college students, and Union College students are no exception, actually throw away thousands of dollars which they have had plncecl at their disposal. Perhaps the aforesaid sum is large but it is a fact. It has been estimated that by not taking ad- vantage of the presence of well known per- sons-no matter in \vhhat field they are skilled-college students are tossing away dollars. Wh~· should this lJe? It is true that many of us can not attend such meetings because of other duties which are more pressing· at the time, but more of us ought to appear than the size of recent audiences indicate. In spite of the scholastic pressure it is this writer's contention that it would be highly desi1·able to have a larger proportion of the student body present. Social contact with others, the development of the ability to speak easily freedom in the self-expression of thought, the opportunity of first hand information not always readily accessible to many-these and many more are well com- ponents of the well rounded college educa- tion. J.\Iany of our parents are making great sacrifices to send us to college. In some in- stl:mces those parents never had the oppor- tunity for an education and .in still other instances the parents are not informed as to who appears on your campus. Those who invest in you in the way of furnishing an education sincerely wish j·ou to obtain all the benefits therelJy possible. A very recent example indicated either a lack of attention or just plain neglect. When a visitor was accorded a I'eception by a member of the faculty to which stu- dents were invited, the large number of stu- dents present equaled the huge sum of six! While it is true that the entire student body was present to hearth is distinguished speak- er in chapel, it does not seem consistant that so many are willing to pass up the chance to actu,1lly converse with the visitot·. If one had to pay the price of admission, we feel certain that many of us would not have that price. An urgent plea is made to the entil·e student body of Union College to take a more active personal interest in the visitors to this campus. In the final analysis such an interests makes the speaker that muchc more welcome and at home. It is a sign of a growing intelligent student body, as well as an indication ooth to 0urselves and to the administration that the activities for which thE>y have labored ~v:ill not have been in vain'. .... _ ... ,.............,. ~ ..................... ~ Buy that extra Bond Now! ................ \\\\\\\' 2130 to 0200 to the music of Freddy, n.ectady Engineering Counci'l, 2000, Old Chapel.

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 1944 'Me.l/ as Coach and Grid Great Hein Called \Greatest Center\; Fourteenth Year With N. Y. Giants This year Mel Hein made his<$>--------------- coaching debut as head coach of the Garnet gridders. Although Union's first wartime team failed to distinguish itself with a win, observers feel that with the armis- tice will come the Dutchmen's real chance to break into big-time foot- ball. Coach Hein's popularity, how- ever, is not confined to the college campus. II•onman Record ter, pro or college, Rein is in his thirty-sixth year, •stands six feet four inches, and weighs 232 pounds. Among Mel's friends are the many hundreds of opponents he has play- ed against, his grand personality and downright good sportsmanship standing him in good stead.

[t seems rather unfair to include both the Navy dorms and the civi'iian dorms in the same basketball league. That's the idea in a nutshell. The Navy ships, with their hwge num- ber of candidates to choose from, naturally will form better clubs then the smaller-sized civilian dorms, with but from fifteen to twenty-five men in each house. This was 1Jo!'l1e out very emphatically in the elimination basketball tournament last winter, and it made the civilians angry, and rightl,}' so, to rub elbows with a higher-class N avr qu.intet and be eli- minated from the tourney by a lopsided score in the very first game. Of course we don't mean to disrupt the tepid Navy- civilian relations that exist at the p1·esent time, but it \vould add quite a bit of enjoymei1t to all civilian competitors if they could play in a league where the competition was on a more even par. Also, it would make every contest a real match in the Navy league, whel'e each team could compete against teams of its own caliber, instead of including games on its schedule that were \walkaways.\ Highland Brings Home Bacon From Duo of Van ·Cortlandt Park Meets Art Highland, Union's ace har-0----- --- rier, competed in two events laGt I On Saturday, in the I~\ meet, week-end on New York's Van Cort- 1 he crossed the fini~h linG in six- landt Park course and came tcenth spot, one bette1· th&n he did through again with an enviable !aPt year, and topped hi:< le.st yPar'~ time by a matter of forty seconds. record and a medal.
