WHITAKER Pl'Oposals To the Committee on Student Af- fairs: We, of the Interfraternity Coun- cil, after due consideration of the problems which have arisen as a result ot the unstable conditions of fraternity life at Union Col!ege, submit the following proposals to the Committee for its inspection: 1. Since, there are at present no adequate facilities for housing an entire incoming Freshman class, we believe there should be no ·pro- longed segregation of the Fresh- men into individual groups, We do not believe that such a -system will as suggested, foster class spirit. As evidenced by present conditions, cliques rather than class unity have t£nded to be formed. The Freshmen are deprived of valuable contact with upperclassmen and because of this, lack the controlling guid- ance of more mature fraternity members. The fraternities do not want increased membership and otherwise the individual house bills would be increased. Pledging 2. In accordance with our purpose as expressed in Section 1, we be- lieve that the same system •Of hav- ing the Freshmen live in the houses during rush-week can be profitably modified by the formula- tion of a rule prohibiting pledging during this week. At a given time after the completion of this week, bids can be presented by the in- dividual fraternities involved. Freshmen may accept invitations from the vario~s houses for din- ners and other social activities. Under no conditions during this week should a Freshman accept a pledge until after a specified time on the last day of the period. Writ- ten statements of the purposes of the fraternity are desirable to give the new men a conception of the fraternity closes to their ideal. RICHARD B. TOBIN, '46 Professor Hoadley Resumes Duties As Ctmlplroller Has Been Professor and Acting Chairman of Field Of Civil Engineering Due to the recent appointment of Dr. Benjamin P.

O.'s Statement To the Trainees of the Navy V-12 Unit: I welcome you back to hard work after the period of relaxation which you have enjoyed during the inter- term leave. The Unit has now been reduced in numbers but I hope refined in quality. No period of indoctrination is necessary for no now trainees are on board. The term which we now enter should be the most successful term so far experienced in the Navy Y-12 Pro- gram. At least the determination of each trainee's success is a mat- ter ·of his own decision. I wish each trainee strength of character to make the self-denials which always are the price of real success. The United States Navy needs adequately trained officers. It has spent much money in your train- Ing to date. The decision as to whether the Government has made a bad investment in your training is largely a matter of your own decision. F. B. Andreen, Commanding Officer ---0--- Dr. Harold W. Bibber Gives Lecture for Officers of Harvard University Group The Union College chapter of the Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship held Hs first meeting of this term Monday evening, March 5, 1945 in Silliman Hall at 1830. Regular weekly meetings will continue to be held at the same time. All men in- terested in an organization for Christian Fellowship are urged to attend. There are no obligations such as dues and qualifications. The newly-elected mem- bers of the Student Council will meet in Silliman Hall next Tuesday at 1830. Com- plete attendance is impera- tive! The chairman of the Union Col- lege War Information Center is Dr. Harison C. Coffin who is also Chairman of the ·Field of Litera- ture at Union College. Dr. Harold W. Bibber, chairman .of the Division of Engineering at Union College, gRve a series of three lectures before the military govern- ment group in the School for Overseas Administration at Har- vard University. He spoke on elec- trical communication, electric power systems and transportation in Japan. This is the second time Dr. Bibber has been invited to give these lectures. He first spoke to the officers in the School for Overseas Administration in November, 1944.

This is the sixth tel'm under the accelerated pregram, which began in July, 19-13. Since then hundreds of men have come and gone. J.\len who entered then are now in their ~ixth term-are now \upper\ Juniors. Now we continue under wartime conditions. This new term welcomes back several vet- erans of this great world war. A few fresh- men are now entering t•nion's gates for tlw first time. We welcome them for the re<;t of L'nion's student bod~·. fncult~·. and act- Jninistration. \\'e welcome them to a term of work and fun. \\'e will not make an~· rash statements, howevet·, for we realize that this wHJ be the toug·hest term in l'nion's 150 )·ears. Union is faced with the acute problen~ of the lack of undergraduate students. The renowned faculty that has placed Union on the top of the educational rating- list is hen' to provide Union men with the type of an educational background that they desire. The unique and beautiful campus that has been the home of so many hundreds and thousands is now the home of only the fe\Y Navy and civilian students that keep Union alive. The buildings through which have passed engineers, scientists, and social stud- ies men are still the haven fo1· the dis- traught undergraduate. The fraternity houses that have seen hundreds of happ~· da.ys are now closed, and the student now musts go out and search for entertainment on his idle Saturday nights. Schenectady is no longe1· the pleasant city that it was. War- time conditions have brought thousands of new inhabitants into its limits, and hav~ pt·esented new problems to the city fathel's. Life in a wartime college is not a picnic as most of us know. Dr. Benjamin P. Whitaker, the Acting· President of Union College, will be facing a severe test in the administration of the col- lege in this forthcoming term. His fight will be a difficult one, but we know him to Le capable of the responsibility placed in his hands. Let us tr~- to help him. As was stated in this column last term, a college can only be as strong as its student body, and the student body ·ca:n only be aR strong as the individuals composing it. Therefo1·e, in our small way, let us help trJ retain Union's strength through the dec- ades. We can do this through cooperation. Now is the time to cooperate with the of- ficers of the college. Now is the time to co- operate with the professors and instructor~ that stand read~· to make their knowledg;e available to you. Now is the time to eo- operate with the leaders of your student a(·- tivities in an attempt to make Union a hap- pier, a healthiet·, and a more prog-ressive place in which to live. SERVICES REQUIRED To all the members of the student body, new and old, we offer an invitation to join the staff of the Concordiensis. Your ideas and constructive criticisms are desired - now. The Concordiensis has never received anr such criticism.

Activities such as the Concordiensis, the Student Council, the Interfraternity Coun- cil, the Delphic Society and the U.C.R.S., not to mention the ever important fraterni- ties, give the undergraduate a chance to view the inner workings and the mechanism of his school. They allow students practical experience in writing, economics and public speaking-and the chance to demonstrate their qualities of leadership. The social and the scholastic contacts made during participation in schooJ and fraternity o1·ganizations will be a continual soul'ce of stimulation and pleasme to the eager parti- cipant. They create a fraternal feeling, a feeling of brotherhood, and tend to unite the college. As a result of these contacts the in- dividual undergraduates grow to know one another better and to appreciate mutual problems. The opportunity, also, for mental and physical relaxation is ample and should· be considered. Through a medium such as the school newspaper, the Concordiensis, the students may express their views on pertinent topics anct in that way determine to some extent the trend of general educational policies as pursued by the administration and the far.- ulty. Nothing- was ever accomplished by a policy of silence or indifference-words plus action means results. The Delphic Society, for example, was formed because there was a feeling of laxity prevalent among the students when it came to aid for the college. That small group of students performs the many thankless tasks asked of them because they have the gen- eral welfare of the college at heart. The United States, and the world for that matter, will be in dire need of leaders in evetr pwfession during the post war era. They will need men who besides theit pro- fessional training have had the advantage of previous ·work in the influencing and forc- ing of decisions through wdting and social· contacts.

He was a potent back- field threat atCommerce in the fall of each of his four years, and was listed on several all-star teams for the metropolitan district. Came the springtime, and Hal was patrolling the outer gardens for the high school baseball squad, doing yeo- r-nan duty and managing to get himself elected captain of the team.

'Ziff was off to an early start in the hoop sport playing with the YMHA when he was only 12. He distinguished himself as high scor- er in the midgets and juni0r classes. The 5-f0ot-9, 162-pounder has been a Dm·pian since he was four years 0ld and attended Central Par!{ Junior High School. He held the enviable recot·d of captaining every intramural team except one during his sojourn there.

When the final tally was chalked up, it ap- peared that Ziffer's team was on the short end 21 to 17. Zi:ft'et·, in- cidentally, had accounted for all 17 marks. Moving on to the famed Nott Terrace High School, Zif extended his basketball career, playing• on the J.V. Again in the now-familiar role of captain, Ziffer piled up the highest score for the season. The next year Phil played varsity ball but his second season was nipped when he entered Union College in January 1943. Zif also participated in track and cross-country for sev- eral seasons at the near-by high school. Phil now wears a navy blue- jacket and with two others is the remainder of his entering class of 33 members at Union. He is pur- suing the electrical engineering cur- riculum and figm·es to complete his course in October.

Tidmarsh, Union's capable directot· of music gave an all-Bach program Sunday, March 11, in Memorial Chapel. The pro- gram included such familiar works as the \Air from Suite in D,\ popu- larly known as the \Air for G String,\ and the impressive \Toc- cata and Fugue in D Minor.\ Be- sides this Dr. Tidmarsh played numer-ous other selections from the works of the .prolific composer, all of them interesting and abounding in nacreous nuances of tonal color. Playing to an unusually large au- dience, Dr. Tidmarsh handled his difficult program exceedingly well, dexterously manipulating man- uals and pedals, and skillfully changing stops in the midst of dif- ficult passages. The extreme ease with which he handled the program attests to his mastery of his com- plex and difficult instrument. Only those who have themselves contort- ed and twisted over a Bach Fugue can fully appreciate the master's calm as be reels off the most in- tricate passages, apparently un- perturbed. Only rarely did the music become tedious. But this might also have been Bach's fault. \Only the Medi- ocre artist Is always at his best,\ and so one must allow for certain lapses where such a creative I genius as Bach is concerned. Al- though this greatest of musical geniuses may have hts academic moments, his music remains the most universal and the most In- finite.

The g:eneral opmion seemed to be that there :should be one imt that it appeared doui.Jtful whethel' it \Youid be pos- sible. Perhaps if a little interest is aroused. in the student body. we might be able to have another one of those unfmg-etable balls this term. The main question concerning such a dance is: \Are there enough students who would be willing to go'?\ On account of the cut in the \'-12 prog-ram and the relative]~· small civilian g-roup. this is a definite prob- lem. The second difficulty involved is fincting a few students who have the ability and. are willing- to organize such a dance. All of us are very busy and time is ,,·orth gold. How- ever, there ought to be someone who can find the time for such an undertaking. The main reason for having· n ball, par- ticular!~· this term, is that it might be the last one till after the war. A possibility ex- ists that the \'-12 unit will leave Union at the end of the term. In that case, the rela- tively few civilian students would not b~· themselves be numerous enoug-h to warrant ha\'ing a dance. In fact, it would be financial- !,\· impossible. That is why every effort should be made to have one this term. There may never be another opportunity, Because there are greater difficulties in- volved this time than at the last dance, it is necessary that we should start early to make plans. The sooner we begin, the more time we will have. The middle of l\Iay would be an excellent time. It would not be too wmm as yet then but would be warm enough to walk without coats. An earlier date might be too cold. Also, it would not be too close to final examinations. Such dates as ~lay 12th or May 19th seem best. So let's get organized. It is possible to have a formal ball now. There may never be another chance, so let's not miss the. opportunity. The1·e are many students who would like to go. A formal dance is always something special. For those of us who \Vill leave at the end of the te1·m, it would mean an additional cherished memory of Union. For the Freshmen, it will be a new expel'ience-one they should not miss. With a little effort and interests on the part of the student body we ought to be able to put it over. BULL SESSIONS During the past rear, five student-faculty meeting-s have been held at the University of Vermont; the last topic under discussion was \Education at U. V. ;.'.1.\ and it was preside(! over by a member of the facult,\'. At these meeting-s the stuclents offered their opinions on classes, administration, teaching etc., and the facult~· did ever,\·thing- within their pmve1· to understand fully the points mised and to modify their educational methods to the best advantage, As a !'e- sult, a better working relationship between the student ancl the professor has been at- tained. There are no reasons why informal discus- sions of this sort could not be feasible or instituted at this college. Everyone is aware of the accelerated progTam, and if not they ought to be- they are working- under one. Courses have been modified due to Navy requirements, and the schedules are in most cases difficult ones with time at a premium; diRcussions on subjects such as proper study habits and technique, extra-cmricular activi- ties and the modification of teaching, recita- tion and Iaborator,\- work practices, would do much to c1·eate a feeling of better coopera- tion between the student and his professor. Due to the exigencies of war, we are rt1shed in oui· work besides having· more to accomplish. Years of teaching and the study of educational methods and plans have fitted our instructors with the knowledge of our shortcomings and where the trouble lies; but these important topics can not be mulled over in the class room. The individual student also knows why he has trouble with some par- ticular aspect of his work, and in many cases the fault is with the presentation. These two viewpoints should be brought tog-ether and aired out thoroughly for everybody's benefit. The ideal situation would be to have these bull-sessions at the end of the first and the third months, so as not to interfe1·e with preparations for the mid-term and the final examinations. College gives to many the opportunity to mingle both common sense, self reliaBce and independent judgment with the guidance and the advice of those who are capable and ex- perienced eriough to give it. These two as- pects of higher education, if applied care-. fully, can become both a source of rich and constant pleasure and stimulation, and the beginning- of true learning. The proposed discussions should do much to hasten that end. Pfc. Robert I. \Vebstel'.

REMOTE CONTROL HE's a gunner on a Boeing Superfortress. And there's a Jap plane framed in his sight. As he swings around, tracking the J ap, the low steel-lidded turret-which may be yards away-also turns. It follows his movements, and the guns raise and lower. And by pressi-ng a button under his thumb, he can fire a fatal barrage. But those guns don't point where he's aiming. For tied in between him and the guns is the G-E elecu·onic-mechanical computer. It makes corrections for lead, windage, distance, parallax. By flicking a switch, he can take over the control of up to three turrets. That leaves the B-29 protected on all sides-no blind spots for enemy attack! Superforts can fly without fighter escort, hold their own in a scrap over Jap territory.

4 FRIDAY, MARCH 16, 1945 CONCORDY PLAY REVIEW I \The Bower of Wandel\ , Re.gular Term Report :Presented By the Student Finance Com:mittee Bottomley's \The Bower of Wan- del\ and George Kelley's Pulitzer Prize Play, \Craig's Wife,\ were presented by Skidmore's Drama De- partment last Saturday night in their little theatre, \The Bower of Wandel,\ which might have been of interest to an historian, was saved from being merely tiresome and academic by the able direction of Vkginia Brown, and by the> earnest per- formance of the entire cast, notably by Jane Ray, who played Catherine, the object of the King's affections. The production staff CQn- tributed greatly to the success of the play by furnishing a stunning set, no mean job in these days of shortages. Besides the point that a rheumatic old lady in waiting mo- mentarily forgot her character by nimbly bouncing off left stage to answer a luwck on the door, the production came off easily enough. The second production. dealing with contemporary American life had far g1·eater audience appeal. In \Craig's Wife.\ George Kelley pm·trays a type of woman familiar on the American scene the hard, ruthlesslv s<'lfish te1·magn nt who manies ~ home. and who tolerates the husband only because he is necessary for its upkeE>p. Her passion for orderliness dt·ives an aunt, and all the servants, out of the house. and hPr attempt to re- duce her husband to just another house fut·nishing finally pwvokes him to walk out.

The next meeting of this organi- zation will be held at 1830 in Silli- man Hall, March 29, unless the Navy drill for Monday is cancelled in which case the meeting will be held at the regular time on Monday evening. March 26. The officers have expressed their desire to maintain this chapter as a permanent extra-curricular ac- tivity at Union College and they urge all Christian men to attend l'egularly. New members are most welcome to enter into membership with this chapter on your campus. Entertainment and Ring Committees to Function as Integral Parts of Affairs Walter B Goad, newly elected pr·esident of the .Senior class, an- nounced today that of the numer- ous committees set up recently, the entertainment committee has a list of pertinent issues of interest to all members of the student body. The enter·tainment committee, which is comprised of the follow- ing members, James Vollmer, Mor- ris J. Brookner, Walter A. Short, chairman, Rudolph E. Slovacek, Calvin R. Simmons, and Baruch Blumberg, have in mind both a stag party for the Senior· class and a formal dance for the entire un- dergraduate body. Stag Party It was and still is a hope of the Senior class that they might have some parlicuhr function or social event solely for themselves where they would be able to revive past traditions, and promote the already existing spirit of friendliness. A stag party. of the sort proposed, seems to be the ideal thing. Formal Dane·<> The Senior class has agreed to help sponsor and promote a formal dance along with the other organi- zations on campus such os the In- terfraternity Council. There has been a decided spirit of coopera- tion prevalent among the groups on campus, and this promises much for the future of such a social un- dertaking. Ring Committee Another committee formed by and for the members of the grad- uating class is the ring or jewelry committee which has as its mem- bers Abbot Weinstein, Melvin Pomeranz and Richard MacAlpine. Annour.cement is also made that Louis H. Welch is the Student Council representative from North College, South Section. ----o---- Alumnus Freed Professor Joseph D_ Doty, Chair- man of the Field of History, is the advisor of the club. At this initial meeting of the term a discussion on the topic, \Crimea Conference, Its Achieve- n:ents and Significance.\ was held.

Details are being worked out with the Navy administration for the men involved to take irregu- lar morning chow, and no difficul- ties are expected. Plans now call for the sign on at exactly 6:45, im- mediately at the end of the Navy calesthenics period. At this time thet·e will be a very rapid review of the morning headline news, a quick look at the weather, and then a continuous program of popular music. Time signals will be given at frequent intervals to assist the platoons in falling out on time for chow. The program will run until 8:00, at which time the station will sign off until the regular afternoon broadcast period. The morning sel'ines will be on the air six days a week, Monday through Saturday, although the afternoon programs only run five days weekly. As yet, no suitable and original name for the new show has been suggested, but it is hoped that some listener will be able to devise one before the series is very old. The start of the new series will increase the weekly total broad- cascting time of Station UCRS from sixteen hours and fifteen minutes to twenty-three hours and for·ty-five minutes of regularly scheduled programs. The Business Staff of the sta- tion also announces that a con- siderable purchase of new records is to be made this week-end to fill certain deficiencies in the pres- ent collection. The effect of the new group will be felt next week, as it is hoped that the purchase will include some excellent new popular pressings. . -----0------- At the first meeting of the Inter- ft aternity Council, for this semester, Bill Baker was elected as President, while Cal Simmons was chosen as their Secreta1·y-Treasurer. The first topic discussed was the opening of the fraternity houses and related to this was the suggestion that in the near future a meeting would be held with the Acting-President, Dr. Whitaker. The main concern of the Council at the present time is with the problems that will na- turally appear with the opening -of the fraternity houses and their use by the fraternity members before they actually return to live their. It is expected that a second meet- ing will be held with Dr. Bennett at which they will discuss post- war plans for the functions and operations of the now deserted houses. The return to pre-war oper- ations promises t.o be a subject that will take a great deal of level head- ed thinking and planning, for· there are many major and minor points that have to be settled. Formal Planned The possibility that there will be a formal dance in the near future prompted the proposal that the Interfraternity Council should have their proper share in the sp-onsor- ing of the dance because it would not -only give the fraternities the chance to demonstrate their co- operative abilities again, but that a dance of this sort should be the result of the work of the stu- dents and should therefore be planned for their benefit. The hope, that there would not be too much difficulty in this undertaking, was expressed. A third meeting, with Lieutenant Andreen and Dean Gar- is, will probably be arranged at which the dance alone will be the topic under discussion. There is no reason why such a function can- not be a success if the plans are made far enough in advance. Both Vvilliam C. Baker and Cal- vin R. Simmons are the presidents of Psi Upsilon and Delta Upsilon, respectively. The Council's success in the past is highly indicative of their continued activities. -------01------- Sgt.

Meeting Every Friday Night at 7 P. M. in Student Activities Office-Washburn Hall. All Interested Are Invited to Attend. CENSORSHIP A subject that has lain donnant for year;.; has been recently revived-namely the cen- sorship of college newspapers. What effect- ed the revival was the attention given to the banning of an editorial by the college officials of one of om· mo1·e famous southel'll col!Jeges. The editorial advocated inte1·- marriage between negroes and whites and free associations, in all fields of the tw(: races. The author was considered for sus- pension and the editorial ease banned. This unfortunate and embarrassing inci- dent has come at a time when many colleg·e ne\\.'Spapers are struggling to avoid hibema- tion due to the lack of staff members aurl stadent body interest. Perhaps a lack of staff member::>hip of a campus newspaper has little or no bearing upon the issue at hand-the censorship of college newspapers; but it should be remembered that in their present \\\eakened condition, colleg·e paper:-; ma;v become no more than campus news bulletins rather than a means for the e~­ pression of the views of the students aHd the editors. A college newspaper is the undergradu- ate's pape1· and its opinions command r.s much 1·espect as those of any member of the college staff. Iloweve1·, when incornpetenl.. publicity seeking undergraduates attempt tu use such a privilege as an instrument to fu·rther their own bizarre schemes, censor- ship appears highly desirable. The authul' of the \racial\ editorial, as it was called, certainly must have foreseen the furor it would cause. She also could have foreseen nothing but the banning of her literary effort, if it could be called such. It was n case of perverting the function of her col- lege's publication from the purpose for ·which it was originally intended-a voice for ann of the student body. Censorship is not being advocated. It i.;; only recommended when a distraught lmtiil strives to express its wild delusions in thf' form of fantastic plans, that such a cen- sorship be used. The average American college newspa.per is fairly free, within the confines of social conventions, to express its editors view- points. College practices can be criticized and improvements recommended. As a rule a liberal attitude is taken towards sur h criticisms and other expressions as may come up from time to time. The paper's judgements are taken for what they m·c worth, and a difference of opinion has littlt: effect upon the general feeling towards an erli to rial. Censorship is definitely not an Americau tradition, a.!though in wartime, censorship is a vital necessity for the safeguarding of mt>n and material. Colleg-es shape the fu- ture of om· country, and perhaps now, of the world. The~· develop thei1· undergraduates into free ,liberal thinking, competent young citizens. In order for a democt·acy to func- tion in the true sense of the word, freedom of expression is essential. It is through thi:-> freedom of exp1·ession of thoughts that the students leam to voice thei!' sentiments along with others. If restl'ictions were in- tegral parts of our training, would it not become an easy matter for our embryonic leaden; and citizens to fear the open decla- ration of their thought and opinions? ThL; would not be the exemplification of the in- dividualist, whose qualities are essentially American. The term \Freedom of the Press\ would fall upon unresponsive n1inds, not trained to think as individuals. Of course, such proposals as mentioned are highly in:1- probable but are noted only as a possibHity if there were to be such strict censorship. vVe should be heard-providing we know how to express ourselves intelligently. l:nion Co!leg·e offers us an extremely for- tunate ::~ituation in that we are governed by a IH.H~ral l..Jody of advisors. Our newspaper is out· org-an or opinion. Debatable issues are openly discussed without fear of rebuke frm N the authorities, because we have damaged the prestige of a position or g-roup. In a collev:e long noted for its clear thinking Wt~ enjO.\' the privilege of free expression as handed down to us b.\· innumerable geneJ'a- tion::>. A college newspaper may be considered as a \\'eapon. In the hands of competent, skilled manipulators a paper, like a weapon, can use its power for the good of everyone con- cemed. Thus like a weapon handled b~· i u- competent, untrained persons it may also injure those ·who would employ it in the pur- poses for which it was not intended. A LIGHT OF HOPE One of the many necessary functions or the Hed Cross was graphically illustrated to the American public by the recent ca}J- tme of Iwo Jima, by the United States l\IH- rine Corps. One of the most bitter, activr~ battles of the entire island campaign raged on \.:\\It. Plasma,\ (;\It. Sudbachi) so named because of the aid, comfort and life-giving qualities of the plasma administered to Ma- rine casualties. ;\Iany would have died had they not received it! To give your pint or blood is fine-but it is not enough; money is needed to process, and test, and package and distribute this vital material. Figure it out. The prison camps in Germany and Japa11 that are resPrved for American and Allied airmen and .soldiers, a1·e not exactly picnic, health, ot· bathing- resorts. In most cases, if not in all cases, they lack even the barest necessities of life. The Red Cross has con- tinually sent these men packages of food- stuffs and toilet articles and other comforts; these bundles rlo not grow on trees-they cost money and that is where the American public should step into the picture. American servicemen in financial or oth€r troubling home matters have been offerer\ the help of the Red Cross time and time again; in many cases lives have been saved and homes sustained because of their as- sistance. The Red Cross canteen vehicles are al- ways a welcome esight up at the front lines -where they function. To a weary soldier it brings a giimpse of home-the home that he is fighting to preserve. Those trucks do not run around on water and milk-it takes money to keep them going. If the homeless and hungry civilians of the newly liberated territories had the funds to contribute to this organization you can rests assured that they would with all their might; for it is the Red Cross that helps supply them with food, blankets, and the vital m.edicines. Mobs of war-shocked refu- gees, despite their patriotic ardor and their will to live, can not last very long in thP. cold and wet without these essentials. Miracles like that just do not happen. It takes your money to give them those neces- sities!

Finding these threats is one of the many jobs of the Bell Telephone Laboratories' scientists. The \criminals\ are such things as threads of lint, traces of acids, or sulphur compounds in the air-any of which might damage telephone equip· ment. In their interesting war work Bell Laboratories' scientists have been on a new kind of hunt. They have tracked down different materials for those now hard to get, found others that would serve in special conditions, and have detected in captured equipment the kinds of material the enemy uses. These are some examples among many of the ways Bell System research is helping to serve America at war.

Past Training Pharmacist Mate Wilcox has been stationed at the Naval Infirmary since January 10, 1944. Enlisting in the WAVES on he1• 20th birthday, Betty (as she is more familiarly called), received her \boot-training\ at Hunter College, New York City, and from there was sent to the Naval Hospital at Sampson, N. Y. for corps school. From Sampson Betty was sent to the Bro~klyn Naval Hospital, but her soJourn there was brief. To be exact, she was there just a week when she re- ceived orders to report to the V-12 Unit at Union College. Interviewed upon her arrival at Garnetla!].d, Betty said: \I like it here very much. Everybody has been sw:en to me and I've been treated like a queen. The work is pleasant and the corps-men here are a great bunch of fellows.\ Forever the possessor of a pleas- ant smile, Betty could often h~ve been seen to be briskly hurrymg along to some place-usually to the \sick-bay.\ On her off-time, Betty was many times a visitor to the Scuttlebutt for a snack and a smoke with the fellows. Her pre~­ ence was welcomed equally by CI- vilians and sailors who knew her and her jolly mood often times pro- vided just the right incentive to jack one up if things had seemed to go wrong. Betty was friendly with the faculty, who lilted her pleasant personality as well as any- body. Pharmacist Mate Wilcox had suc- cessfully passed her second test so that she might be eligible for the rating of Pharmacist Mate 2c :mt since there was no such openu:~g here, it is expected that Betty Will receive a promotion in rank at a future date. Our M~ssage Union College bids bon-voyage to her first WAVE and sends her the best wishes and God-speed at h?r new station and hopes that she Will always remember us and the. pleas- ant associations that went w1th her stay with us. ---o---- Hal Enstice Gets Purple Heart PII.M./3C BETTY WILCOX College Plan For Future Students New System Now In Effect Whereby Union Alum!Ji Will Register Sons for Admission In response to an inquiry sent out by the office of the Director of Ad- missions of Union Colege to Union Alumni between the classes of 1915 and 1940, Union College now has a system whereby Alumni of Union College will register their sons as future candidates for admission. To indicate that they are being con- sidered for admission to Union, these prospective students will re- ceive a certificate properly endors- ed and signed by college officials which indicates that Union College will consider them for admission upon successful completion of their high school curriculums. It .is expected that these certifi- cates wi!I serve as incentives to their recipients and spur them on to the day when final entrance to Union is at last a reality. From time to time appropriate literature on the functions of Union Colleges and copies of student pub- lications will be .sent to these pros- pective students so that they might know the true nature of college activities. Periodical checks will be made also on the academic progress of prospective college students while they are still in hi·gh school. Devised by Mr. Wilford H. Ketz. Director .of Ailmissions, this proce- dure of registering sons of alumni at an early age is indicative of post wat· plans for Union College. Union College has existed for 150 years and it is hoped that this plan will enable Union to carry on its tradition with the presence of sons of Alumni. ---o--- Fraternities Release Lists of New Pledges U ndC'r the direction of He my Kaiser an effort \Vill be made to collect one hundred and fif't~· million pounds of usable clothing, shoes and bedding. This means that in the areas to be solicited by the drive we will need to collect per- haps as much as five pounds of clothing per person. If you 1 have any kind of garments, shoes Ol' bedding, please arrange to have it collected for this important cause. Almost any type of serviceable clothing is acceptable. It need not be in perfect repair but should be reasonably clean.

There will be no other clothing drive by any organization from now until June. If you have an attic or closet filled with unused or rarely worn clothes please take this opportunity to give them to some one who needs them desperately. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Admin- istration estimates that as many war victims have died from exposure and lack of adequate clothing as have died from starvation.

Although some members were absent due to Navy drill, a quorum was present so the meeting was opened. President Goad first presented nominations for three college com- mittees. These were all approved. Those approved for the All College Discipline Committee were: Cal- vin Simmons and Abbott Weinstein, seniors; Robert Potter and Robert Bush, juniors; Frank Greenwood and Louis Snell, sophomores; and Stanley Sutton for the freshman class. Nominations were also approved for men to serve on the new Sophomore Discipline Committee. 'I his committee had been estab- lished at the last meeting of the Council and as had been approved, the two sophomore representatives in the All college Discipline Com- mittee are automatically members of the new committee. Other men \\he> were approved were: Albert Vo~kman, Stewart Stephens, Albert Dingley, and Robert Veigel. The last committee for which m<>mbers were nominated was the All College Gomplaint Committee. H was pointed out that the nature and purpose of this committee n~'cessitated that the civilian mem- bers do most of the difficult diplo- n:rotic presentation of complaints lo the proper authorities while the Navy representatives could act only as collectors for the most part. The approved nominations were: Calvin Simmons, Albert Volkman, and Louis Snell, civilians with Joseph Hoffman and Edward Hubbard for the Navy. It was decided that these three con,mittees should have a joint meeting sometime this week to state or restate their aims and pre- s<>nt them to the Council for ap- vroval. The Spring dance was discussed. President Goad brought out that at present both the Senior class and the Inter-fraternity Council have tentative plans for a dance and that any dance would have to have the financial assistance of some outside organization such as the N.A.C. or the Student Finance Committee. Goad suggested that the matte1· be dropped till the next mf eting by which time it is hoped the Senior Class and the Interfra- ternity Council will have met to- gether and formulated plans. Louis Welch presented a motion that was approved that the Sopho- more Discipline Committee be recommended to strike out the regulation concerning freshmen use of the Baily Hall-Psi U walk from the Freshman rules. This opened a discussion concerning class rivalry a r,d traditions in which the most pertinent remarks were that n.one of the freshman rules have yet b<'en enforced and that if any class rivalry was lacking it . was in the Sophomore class for the idol is de- cidedly green in color. ---0,--- Tau Sigma Prime to Meet at Physics La.b my outfit only long enough to name Moriarty, Joseph Vorndran.

M. in Student Activities Office-Washburn Hall. All Interested Are Invited to Attend. ------------------ FORMAL DANCE This ed;i.torial is a plea, for all of th1~ groups on cmnpus to agree, as early as pos- sible, 0n a program of cooperation for the planni-11g- of our Next formal dance. Affairs of this s0rt were less of a p1·oblem years back when the student body enrollment was conside1·abl:·: greater, and the students had more leisu1·e time in which to carry out their plans and ideas; today however, due to the fact that we are comparatively fe\'· in n mnher, and our time is practically com- pletely taken up with work--more time ant! cooperation is necessar~· if things are to ru:1 as sm0othly as we wish them to. For 1nan:v of us, this semester is our last at Cnion College. The planned formal dance would gh~e us the opportunity to renew old friendshIps for the future as well as givi 11~ us the chance to enjo;-; ourselves completely for the lagt time on the Union College cam- pus. We 0ught to feel aware and proud of the fact that this year marks the one hun .. dred and fiftieth anniversa1·y of this institu- ticn of higher education and that we, today, are the student::; of a venerable and respected ::;chool. A dance of this sort would be worth while if only to let us see oUI'selves, all to- gether, in that light. The rnany and varied student organiza- tions such as the Interfraternity Council, th'! fratemi ties themse I ves, the senior and other classes, just to mention a few, are extreme!~· capaiJle of org·anizing any social affair with a high degree of efficiency--theil· past rec- ord proves that. There is rnore to the prep- arations for a formal dance than the mere selling of tickets, howeve1·; somebody ha:, to plan .and consti'Uct the decot·.ations, and advertise, and anange for booths, and to see to adequate housing facilities for the date~. and choose an orchestra-in other words any dance, in ordet· to be successful must be the result of practical, combined effort. Instead of one group accomplishing all of this work - it is not fair in the fi1·st place -- the chances for mediocrity are lessened if co- operation is achieved. There is not much time left for indecision--let us start in at once. It is this newspaper's opinion and sugges- tion tim t this topic be discussed, by all coE- cemed, at the soonest possible time-per- haps ~·our next scheduled meeting. We can make this affair a time to remember. POSTWAR CONSCRIPTION When the smoke that rose above Pearl Harbor like a pall, on the fateful day in De- cember, 1941, had finally cleared, the stunted and potentially dang-erous thoughts of the America.11 people should have cleared with it. The pathetic and troubling photographs of our 1940 army should all be enlarged, a hun- dred times, and placed in the squares of every American city, town, and village, as a constant reminder of the da~:s that pre- cipitated our nearly disasterous defeats in the Paci fie after Japan's \sudden\ declara- tion of war. We were caught off guard, and much more important than the humilit~· we suffered, were the Jives lost as a direct result of traitorous unpreparedness. Postwar compulsor,Y' military training· would do much to lessen possible future ag- gression; the proposed plan being- that evel'y American J.Touth would spend from twelve to eighteen months in training camps, learn- ing the fundamentals of his weapons, having constant maneuvers under all possible ad- verse condition, so that if he were suddenly called back into active service when an emer- gency arose-he would be that 1nnch ahead and prepared. The At·my and the Navy offer much to a young man. There is no doubt in anyone's mind that the training is beneficial physi- cally--and healthy youths are the backbone of the natiolL It would not hurt any col- lege age man in the least, to live and eat and work with people who come from different environments, and sections of the country; perhaps if he came to see more of the United States, and the prejudices and hatreds that tend always to disunite the American people --he would be a better student and man. The average college life is, comparatively speaking, a cloistered one anyway; an in· dividual who finishes high school in a speci- fic vicinity g'enerally goes to college in that sa.me area, never penetrating his thin and almost transparent barriers. The practical experience attained as a result of transient service would broaden a man considerablr. However, it would be ridiculous to pose this question without glancing first at the arguments against compulsory military training. In general the educators firml,v believe that the twelve to eighteen months taken away from the college students train- ing, would be disadvantageous. They alsv point out that if an age like eighteen is set as the time of entrance into the armed serv- ices, it might even interrupt the high schools' system of education. But it should appear apparent to ever_yone, that these are ques- tions that can be settled very easily with a litile thought and planning, and settled equi- vocally -if it so desired~ 1\Iany apparently well meaning citizens, have also concluded that such a progTam would be tantamount to a definite reg-ression of om· cherished democratic principles. They fail, however, to consider that without sue~-). groups as the militiR who fought the Indian3 and French prior to the Revolutionary War; the riflemen of the original thirteen colonies who distinguished themselves both the Brit- ish and their mercenary Hessian allies, and other similar org-anizations of the War of 1812-we mig-ht not practice the least of our democratic and American ideas today! The above mentioned men were trained to Pl'O- tect their land, and they knew why they were away from home and fighting. Their t~·pical pioneer spirit, and their simple though intimate knowledge of the use of the rifle i.s unfortunately sadly Jacking today. There are thus two alternatives-- which one seems to you to hold the strong-est anrl most practical arguments? Pearl Harbot·. blazing on December 7th, 1941, held the answer! MAGAZINES The blunt fact that magazines have \mys- teriously\ disappeared from the Hale Hom;e Lounge, was called to our attention recently. The magazines have not been displaced and it is disgusting that at a colleg-e, thing-s of this sort have to be discussed. The numerous publications to be found in the lounge are put there for the benefit CJf all of the students, who desire the few mo- ments of relaxation offered them. There should be no reason for any magazine to \disappear.\ Make sure that before you leave, the mag- azines that you were reading- are put back into their proper places on the bookshelf. They are yours-take care of them! COLLEGE ••••• •••• CALENDAR Satm•day, March 31 No Bowling.

Concordy Review \A DoWs House,. Henrick Ibsen's much discussed drama \A Doll's House,\ con- stituted the evening's entertainment at the Erie Theater last Monday night. It was more or less of an historic occasion because this pro- duct ion mat· ked the first histrionic effort of the newly-formed Ameri- can Theatre League. Playing to a packed house, the cast distinguished itself by its excellent performance, and the director, by his unique touch. But the four-hour long pro- . duction threatened to develop into and endurance contest between the players and the audience, and the players, being in better shape, would, no doubt, have won out. Al- though the action was punctuated by a series of well-done climatic incidents, the connecting episodes were wordy and drawn out, and many a weary G.E. executive must have grown conscious of his seat. The production, however, more than atoned for its deficiencies by its merits: Dale Melbourne's inter- pretation of Nora Helmer was fresh, and unique in the play's his- tory; Francis Lederer handled his part with the assurance of a vet- eran. All the rest of the cast met their requirements satisfactorily, except, perhaps, Keven McClure, who played Mrs. Linde. This young lady is evidently fresh from dra- matic school, and her gauchness will, no doubt, disappear with ex- perience. In \A Doll's House\ Ibsen poses a problem that once aroused a storm of controversy: just how much freedom, and how much au- thority should a young wife have? Norma Helmer, the pretty young wife is the heroine; Society, the villain, is personified in her smug, selfish, domineering husband. As a parallel, Ibsen brings in Dr. Rank, FRIDAY, MARCH 30, 194'5 Navy War Bond Cartoon Service \Maybe YOUR Bmtds are buying automatic rifles, but I happen to know that MY money was spent on silky unmen.tionables for WAVES!\ ---------------------------- ------------------------ Wild rumors are spreading thing to be viewed through a micro- amund campus concerning a well seopl'\.

In a scene which might have been half as long,_ she makes several heroic attempts to get out of the door, and doesn't succeed until her husband calls her back a number of times. So wordy, and so repititious is this incident that it becomes doubtful whether she will ever get out of the door. When finally she is gone, Mr. Hel- mer wanders about the living room, perplexed. Finally he sits down on the sofa, and then he makes a re- mark which practically undoes all the good wo1·k the play has up till this time so tenuously accomplished. With a glib remark, and a flippant shrug of the shoulders, he dis- misses the matter as though he were commenting on the paper- boy's failure to make a delivery. The purpose of this final remark is not at all clear, and it only spoils the effect. Credit for all the merits and failings of the production go to E. S. Bryden. Mr. Bryden has di- rected such laudable productions as \Till We Meet Again,\ and \Mark Twain.\ His handling of \A Doll's House\ is for the most part good. He might have used his scissors mm·e freely, however, instead of writing additional dialogue for an already long play.

Last night, at 7:00, at a meeting of the Interfraternity Council, fur- ther plans were made for the much discussed formal dance. The meet- kg was held with the requested presence .of Dean C. F. Garis and Lt. F. B. Andreen who answered questions a:nd helped lay plans for the hoped-for dance. Lt. Andi,een emphasized that no V-lZ Trainees would be allowed to miss, or be excused from, any of their classes to work on the steadily advancing prom plans. He did say, however, that he would consider allowing late permission for V-12s on the Friday night before prom, to allow Navy attendance at any other week-end activities that might bB planned in conjunction with the f01·mal. He would not commit any definite statement on such a pro- po&al, however. Navy Financing The whole plan now lays in the hands of Lt. Andreen and Lt. Hall and the use of the Naval Activities Committee funds for the support of such a dance. Lt. Andreen stated that the amount designated for the last formal could not again be ap- propriated heca use of the propor- tion of Navy students who attend- ed the last big dance. The whole matter now lies in the hands of all V-12 Trainees who must show their d~li'ire to support a fot·mal. Housing Dates Dean Garis adhered to the state- ml'nts of Lt. Andreen, and stated that the fraternity houses C'OUld be used for date housing if such was t!H desire. He also stated that if the d\'mand was great enough, dances ct•uld probably be slated for Friday night in ot·der to make the week- end something more than a single event. This dance. if held, would take place sometime in Ma:,·. as soon as r.J>\ns could be formulated and com- pleted. -----0------ Fraternity Alumni to Plan On House Contro' Alumni t·epresentatives of all fraternities represented on the Union College campus will meet in Old Chapel Tuesday evening, April 3 to di::::cuss the problem of \How to Reestablish the Fraternities a.t Vnion College.\ The alumni treasurers of each of of the fraternities have heen invited to participate in the discussion which is to decide, among other questions. whether the fraternities. faced by a deat·th of members, shall resume control of their respective houses. or whether the college shall maintain these houses and suffer a loss for the duration. It is as yet unknown whether the alumni treasure!' of these fra- ternities will be present. or who the representatives to be chosen by them will be. It is, however. to be hoped that the meeting will accom- plish its purpose in securing the fratemitie~ on the campus.
