Discussion centered on the winter prom, RPI rela· tions, in tram ural sports, and a plan to promote better understanding between the student council and the IFC. WILLI~l VAN OST prupo$ed that the winter prom be held as a bcnE'fit da nee for t hP Dan: on Run- yon !\1pmorinl fund. His plan was to ha\'e the MPrrorial fund cern· n:ittee help \ith publicity for the dance in thP hopE' that other col· lP~es throu~hout the <'ount·ry would 9dopt the idea and start a series of benefit dances for the fund.

What kind of impres- sion would you have of the college and the men who go here? Would you laugh it off as just a college prank when it cost you money to have the dents tal,en out of your car'? Would you say, \Well college men must be boys\ and leave it at that with no ill feelings toward the school? It isn't likely. You'd probably be so mad you would curse the col- lege up and down. Here is a letter which was written to a Schenectadian by our public relations office as a result of the damage done to his car: Deal' l\Ir. J uron: Your letter of September 30, regarding the unfortunate actions of some young men during the course of last Friday night's college football pamde through the business section of Schenectady, has been tumed over to me. and I hasten to thank ~·ou most sincerely for stating your feelings in no uncertain te1·ms. I can well understand your anger at some of the things that happened. particularly the damag;e to your car through scratching and denting. Assuming; that those who caused the damage were Union ·College students, I am glad that you do not hold all of om· students responsible, as indicated by the last paragraph of your letter in which you asked us to \please considet· all of the above an insult to last night's mob only, not to those v-;ho remained behind to studv.\ There is no excuse for what happened, of couTse, and the kindest thing I can say aLout students or any other per· sons who damage other people'::; property is that they fot·get for the moment that they are supposed to be gentlemen. Evn worse, such students forget that by their actions their college is being judged. The trouble is, of course, that college students, as well as many other human beings, unfmtunately often act dif, ferently when they are in a crowd from the way they would ~s i.n~ividuals. Sometimes crowds collectively do things that mdlVIduals would not do. I am afraid this is what happened last Friday night. This statement does not condone what happened then, but it does point out an all too common human failing. So that you and ~·our \vife will !mow that the oTeat majority of Union College students are gentlemen, anl' con- duct themselves as gentlernen s1wuld, I should like to extend to both of you an invitation to be my personal guest on the campus at some time that will be convenient to you. I am sure, after such a visit here, that you will chanD\e the un- fortunate opinion which you gained through so~ne of the occurences last week. We like to feel that we have here one of th finest g1·oups of young men to be found in this country. We h~pe that you will come here and find that you can agree with us.

THE CLASSIC ILLUSTRATION of my financial instability occurred one pay-day last summer, when for the first time i_n my life I still had some of the pteviO\\S week's cash left when I piCked up my check. Feeling like a million bucks, or at least a reasonable facsimilie thereof, I lined up two dates for the coming weel,end. By R. A. NAVIAS Early this week we got a whiff of the biggest campus \smell\ in AT ANY RATE, to shorten a 1ong and sorrowful story, let me say years. And for those of the studrnt body, especially the fre~hmE>n, who simply that I borrowed $10 from my kid sister for Friday's woman, have not come in close contact with this matter, let us say without and I had to put the bite on the second doll hen:;elf for money to cover qualification that this is one big o;tinlc Those members of the stu- Saturday's check. dentry who travel lipperclass wall< have doubtlessly noticed a rather If Harold Avery or Ben Whitaker have any suggestions, I'll be more piercing aroma, a rather striking fragrance, in the air.

I would the air is not from the crushed and battered nearbv buried bodies of: have been more than glad to pay for advice on the subject, but you fresh and sophs fallen in mortal combat about the Idol. Nor is it due see, it's like this: I had a roll yesterday, and then this guy comes along to the traditionally complainE>d of lack of soap in the gymnasium. and asks me to double date, and it turns out we're out most of the NO, UNFORTUNATELY, we can report nothing at all •romantic night, and first thing I know · · · about the stink of the week. The situation is this; we have a fire in READER, can you spare a dime? the heating plant coal pile. Fires start spontaneously in soft coal piles, William Mathias, superintendent of grounds, told us, when the coal gets wet and is allowed to stand. It seems that the wet coal tends to de- compose. And if the coal is piled ovE>r ten feet high, the heat generated by decomposition is held in the pile and just speeds up the process of decomposition. Most coal contains a small amount of sulphur. and when heated by the decomposition of the soft coal, sulphur dioxide results. It is the sulphur dioxide which has been troubling thP more sensitive noses on campu~. Mr. :ITnthias \\'Pnt on to tPll us that nothing short of actually using up the coal will solve the problem. You just can't put out a coal-pile fire any other way. If you wet down the pile, he said, the pile just burns faster. You can't send a man in with a. shovel and tell him to dig until he gets to the hot spot. He wouldn't last that long. Before the war, when we had a fire in the coal pile, we tried forcing carbon dioxide into the pile through a pipe. To make a short story of it, the idea didn't work We couldn't force a pipe into the coal pile. So now ali we can do is wait until we use up enough coal so that we can get to the hot spots. AND SO, FELLOW STUDENTS, this is the story of why a ce1·tain sector of our fair campus ha~ n bit of an aroma. Not for long. we hope. Before the president or manager of anothe1· student activity comes screaming to us that his pet organization is being scuttled by the board of managers, student council, student tax committee, and any other such group he think,; of, l\t us calmly explain that the board of managers and the student council are going to review all student tax supported activities thi~ lull. Th\ J.mrposc of the review by the board of managers is to find out how and to what effect student tax funds are being spent. The student council is at the same time re- viewing the constitutions of all tax supported a<;tivities. The Book Shelf THE CRACU.

Earlr this week we got a whiff of the biggest campus \smell\ in years. And for those of the studrnt body, especially the freshmen, who have not come in close contact with this matter, let us say without qualification that this is one big stink. Those members of the stu- dentry who travel Upperelass walk have doubtlessly noticed a rather piercing aroma, a rather striking fragrance, in the air. This scent in the air is not from the crushed and battered nearby huried bodies of frosh and sophs fallen in mortal combat about the Idol. Nor is it due to the traditionally complained of laclt of soap in the gymnasium. AT ANY RATE, to shorten a long and s?rrowful sto;y. l,et .me say simply that I borrowed $10 from my kid s1ster for Fnday s woman, and I had to put the bite on the second doll herself for money to cover Saturday's ·check. . , If Harold Avery or Ben Whitaker have anY suggestions, .I U be more than glad to lend an ear-but only H they offer them grabs. I would have been more than glad to pay for advice on th_e subject, but you see it's like this: I had a roll yesterday, and then th1s guy comes along and asks me to double date, and it turns out we're out most of the night, and first thing I know . . . Boys Will Be Boys:? Suppose one of the two cars damaged d-..1ring the parade downtown last week had been yours? What kind of impres- sion would you have of the college and the rnen who go here? Would you laugh it off as just a college prank when it cost you money to have the dents tal\en ()U t of your car? Would you say, \Well college men must be boys\ and leave it at that with no ill feelings toward the scnl}()l? It isn't likely. You'd p1·obably be so mad you wot1.ld curse the col- lege up and down. NO, UNFORTUNATELY, we can report nothing at all 'romantic about the stink of the weelc The Bituation is this; we have a fire in the heating plant coal pile. Fires sta.rt spontaneously in soft coal piles, William Mathias, superintendent of grounds, told us, when the coal gets wet and is allowed to stand. It seems that the wet coal tends to de- compose. And if the coal i,; piled ove>r ten feet high, the heat generated by decomposition is held in the pile and just speeds up the process of decomposition. Most coal contains a small amount of sulphur. and when heated by the dNomposition of the soft coal. sulphur dioxide results. It is the sulphur dioxide whi~h has heen troubling the more sensitive noses on campus. Mr. Mathias went on to tell us that nothing short of actually using up the coal will solve the problem. You just can't put out a coal-pile fire nny other way. If you wet down the pile, he said, the pile just burns faster. You can't send a man in with a shovel and tell him to dig until he gets to the hot spot. He wouldn't last that long.

Here is a letter which was written to a Schenectadian by our public relations office as a result of tlH! damage done to his car: Dear l\Ir. Juron: Your lette1· of Septembe1· 30, regarding: the unfortunate actions of some young men during the com-se of last Friday night's college football parade through tl!e uusiness section of Schenectady, has been tume<l over to me, and I hasten to thank you most sincerely for stating y01.u feelings in no unce1·tain terms. I can well understand yom· angel' at soome of the things that happened, particularlr the damage to ::mtn· car through scratching and denting. Assuming that t h()se who caused the damage were Union College students, I ~nn glad that you do not hold all of our students responsible, as indicated by the last paragraph of rour letter in whi~h yott asked us to \please consider all of the above an insult to last nig·ht's mob only, not to those who remained behind to sttidy.\ There is no excuse for what happened, of course, and the kindest thing I can say about ~tudents ()!' an:> other per~ sons who damage other people's property is that they forget for the moment that they are supposed -to be gentlemen. Evn worse, such students forget that by tlle1r actions their college is being judg-ed. The trouble is, of course, that college students, as well as many other human beings, unfmtunately (){ten act dif- ferently when they are in a crowd from the wa.y they would as individuals. Sometimes crmvds collectively do things that individuals would not do. I am afmid this is what happened last Friday night. This statement does not condone what happened then. but it does point out an all too common human failing. So that ;you and your wife will lmo\\..\' tltat the great majority of Un.ion College students are ge~tlernen, and con- duct themselves as gentlemen should, 1 should like to extend to both of you an invitation to be my })e\'S()Il.al g·uest on the campus at some time that will be convenient to you. I am sure, after such a visit here, that you ·wi11 ;C]tange the un- fortunate opinion which you gained thro1.1g-h some of the occmences last week. We like to feel tlnt we have here one of th finest groups of young men to be found in this country. We hope that you will come here and find that you can agree with us. Very sincel'e!y yours.

AND SO, FELLOW STUDENTS, this is the story of why a certain sector of our fair campus has a bit of an aroma. Not for long, we hope. Before the president or manager of another student activity comes screaming to us that his pet organization is being scuttled t.y the board of managers, student council, student tax committee, and any other such group he thinks of, let us calmly explain that the board of managers and the student council are going to review all student tax supported activities thl~ !all. The purpose of the review by the board of managers is to ftnd out how and to what effect student tax funds are being spent. The student council is at the same time re- viewing the constitutions of all tax supported activities.

Dick, who ran a 4:37.7 mile for Glens Falls High has already been clocked at 15:33 for the three mile run. Right behind Doland are John Larkin and Bob Murray. Larkin has come up with a 16:12 three mile this week. Murray was a star half miler for Newburgh. Coach Ketz has expressed his confidence in these first three men by stating that any one of them has a chance to set sc•me new records. COMPETING for the two backer up slots are Bob Kline, Jan Walker, John Pape, Gerry Murphy, Don Horton and Garry Clough. Of these men, Kline and Walker seem to be showing the most form.

The finish will be ·on the track between the halves of the football game. Coach Bill Ketz has no false hopes as to Union's chances in the meet, picking Vermont to finish first with Amherst second. The rea::;on for this aparent glo•om is that Valentine uf Amhen;t is Na- tional A.A.U. 20 kilometer champ, and Vermont's Randall is one of the best 1 unnen; that school has ever had. KETZ'S number one man is Abe Laltshin, a 21 year-old Junior from Plattsburg, N. Y. Lakshin, a trans- fet· student, running his first year at Union last year, quickly worked his way up to a berth among the first five men on last seas·C•n's un- defeated team. His best time last yeat· over the 4.7 mile course was 27:21, and Ketz considers him in great shape, having been clocked for the first three miles in as fast a time as his fastest last season. The second, third, and fourth positions on the squad will be held down by Alex MacCormick, Dave Brown, and Gus Nirdlinger. Town- send MacCoun., the team's only senior, is number five man, and Bill Wright and Dick Mechanic round out tomorrow's starters. VERMONT will use nearly the same team that was defeated 24-35 by one of the best teams in Union's history last year. Amherst, with a squad of five seniors and 2 sopho- mores, was not on Union's schedule !a.st year. This year, Ketz explained, will be one of development for the Gar- net team. Five of the first seven men are sopllomores, and most at- tention will be paid to gaining ex- perience in O•rder to build up a team for next year. Ketz considers such Sophomores as Nirdlinger and Mechanic, both of whom show great possibilities, as potentially excellent cross country men, but as yet they are not fast enough. THE ADDITION of Amherst to the Dutchmen's schedule br-ings to eight the number of teams the Gar- net runners will face this seas·oon.

READER, can you .spare a dime? By George T. Orick ·::mm::;:::::::mm::::::m::m::m::::m:::::::m:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::~::. Ordinarily a college newspaper doesn't concern itself V:ith oute;- world activities such as international relations, labor, strtfe, a~omJC bombs and cost of living. That is, until any of the above ment10ned matters is brought within the campus. Then it becomes hard to ignore. FRENCH FRIED POTATOES, consumed with moderation, are de- licious. Since we view the world in terms of our likes and dislikes, my first few days at college this term were made inexpressibly gloomy by the increase in price of French fried potatoes at Hale House. To me this was the only major cost-of-living increase worthy of considera- tion in recent years. Assured by my friends that I was not alone in feeling cause for complaint, I went to see William South, manager of Hale House. Some of the things he had to say seemed worthr of publicity. Naturally, because he is under fire almost continuously from the student body on his administration of Hale House, South was over anxious to ex- plain away some of the major criticisms. Some facts, however can not be taken with a grain of salt. They must just be swallowed un- ganished . SOME OF THE FIGURES in the book tell the story far better than either South or I could. The little table of comparative prices below should shO\v you what I mean. Figures are for September, 1948 and 1949. 1948 1949 Lettuce 1crate $6.00 $10.50 Coffee (pound .45 .53 Cabbage <bag $1.25 2.00 Lamb (leg) .62 .64 Squash (bag) 1.00 2.50 Carrots <bushel 1.75 2.50 Potatoes (cwt.l 3.00 3.50 AND SO IT GOES, Some of the items have risen more than others, but there has been a definite upswing in prices since last fall. Beef, said South, is the highest in history. Bread it up 1 cent a loaf. Milk is up three-fourths of a cent a quart. And here's the payoff. Fruit juice has risen $2.00 for each 12-can carton. Hale House lost over $700 on silver theft or loss alone last year. Linen service rates have risen. But South has been able to [{eep wages stable. He seemed reluctant to discuss this, so I won't mention it. Admittedly, there is little asthetic value in the cafeteria. But would most of us be here if it weren't for temporarily expanded college facili- ties? Next time you hear me gripe about Hale House, remind me of my words here.

THIS GAME wiH be a real test ' for the Gamet, who have been able to easily steam-l'DHel' their first two opponents. Someone is bouml ~o end up with a soiled record, and the Dutchmen can be expected to play their hearts out so that it won't be they. Two times in a 1·ow would be hard to take. The Vermonters are really big. By John Oassidy The Un:on college socce1· squad will be looking for its initial win of the season, Saturday, when it Lravels to meet the Orangemen of 'Syracuse Unive1·sity. The Dutchmen dropped theit· opening encounter to the University of Massachusetts b:y : a 5-2 count last Saturday at Am· 'herst. THE MASSAOHUSETTS game was a case ·of too much Red Win· .ton, as the ·carrot-top arP ronnectPd with four goals for the \Vinners. .Eric Sm1th and •Kurt Bi1·klein stood· out in a losing cause, as they con· tributed a goal apiece for the Ga1·· net boaters. · Union startPd strongly, carrying the attack deep into their op·' . ponents~ tel'l'itory in the first quartet·.

The largest, tackle Ed Comolli, stands 6' 4\ and tips the. scales at 220 pounds. The effecUve- ness of this line was discernahle last week, when the Catamounts held St. Lawrence scm·eless.

YARDSTICK NEXT WEEK, when the Gar- netmen travel to Troy, they can. expect to meet up with an old friend on the RPI squad. 6' 1\ 185 pound Daymon Jordan, the leading Engineer ground gainer in '47, did not play last yeat· because of scho- lastic difficulties. However, he is coming back to the team, and he will make his first appearance of the season against Union. Appar-. ently Rensselaer Coach, Ed .Jontos, is saving him for just this, as he will not play against Buffalo this week.

Brud Shaf- fer during the contest, the Garnet line took a heavy onslaught in stride, and led by rugged tackle Pete DelSanto, managed to hold on despite their weaknesses. The shifty Garnet backfield, led by Charley Lewis, Hal Lunstrom, Dave Strauss, Dick Speidel, and Bob Fletcher con- tinued to roll up yardage, as was expected. Rochester standouts were little Frank Reid, who continually scooted around the end of the Gar- net line, and FPank Howd, who managed to get away .a few passes despite the fact that he was being rushed continually. EARLY in the first quarter, Union, sparked by Lewis and Lund- strom, marched 48 yards. Lund- strom bulled his way over from the two yard stripe for the initial score, and Wade converted.

In 1952 Middlebury will be replaced by Haverford College, a Pennsyl- vania school. According to J. Har- old Wittner, directcr of Athletics, this Is being done so that the Unionrnen can expand their foot- ba 11 activities to new territories. Leagues are not a new thing In the football world, and such old standards as the Ivy League and the tradition bound Little Three have been operatir.g for years. It would be an lnncvation if Union could cooperate in forrr.in~ some sort of competition of this sort. Single game rivalries with such ancient foes as R.P.I. and Hamilton leave no Nllltinuity to a foc-tball schedule. If combined rlvalrie>: could branch out into a mythical championship, this would rrake life more interesting- to campus foot- ball followers. MOST PEOPLE w·ho have wit- nessed any foctball games this Fall have nohiced at least one of the rule changes that was brought to bear this season. Unlin:ited sub- stitution when the ball changes hands is the feature spectators may notice mo>'t. During this time the referee stops the clock and makes like ·a: traffic cop, due to the two platoon systems that many teams use. Singlp substltuticns when the rlock -is running, however, are now things of thP past. One other change is that an ineomplcted pass thrown from the end zone no longer counts as a safetr against the pass- ing team. ?s it did in the past. PAUT, FARRELL, ~tar halfback on Middlebury's almo~t undefPated team of last year (if it hadn't ·been for Union l was lest to the team this year because he signed a ·base- ball contract with the Philadephia Phillies.

Altogether six rren have been lost from the powerful 1948 squad. ---0--- WATCHING AND WAITING Last We-e-k Buffalo 26. . .R.P.I. 0 Williams 35 ....... Rochester 0 St. Lawrence 42 ......

Bowdoin Middlebury vs. Tufts Hamiltcn vs. Oberlin 63 Year Old Rivalry Has Seen Many Surprises By J oim Cassidy November 19, 1886, marked the beginning of one of America's oldest and fiercest football rivalries. On that day, the varsity eleven played a game of football with the RPI eleven at West Troy. Union got off on the right foot, with :t 4-0 victo1y, in spite of a referee, well versed in the rules?, ,vho saw mysterious fouls and who was rumored to have money down on the Trojans. A LOT has happened in tlle 63 ~·----~----­ years of rivalry following that first g-ame. Despite the fact that Union has taken 33 of the 46 games played to date, the classic has been the occasion for some standout football. In addition, football sages will tell you that the role ·C•f favorite means little in this time- honored fray. For example, the Engineers were strong favorites to win the 1926 clash, on the basis• of. an ur.de- feated season. The Garnet grid- ders had a mediocre club, dropping three of their first four games. The Dutchmen didn't read the clippings, however, and pushed the Trojans all over '87 field, handing them a 21-6 trc•Uncing. IN THE 1937 contest the Engi- neers fielded a team that hadn't scored a point In two seasons. Union had one of its st;wngest elevens which had copped its first three outings with ease. The Rensselaer men gained a moral victory by balding Union to a 6-6 tie In a game played in the ankle- deep mud. In 1931, the rivals wouldn't settle for one game, so they played two. A total of 15.000 people saw Ur.ion · win both encounters. 7,000 of them saw the Garnet win the regularly three touchdowns and passed for two more in the rout. In the 1942 encounter Bob Bartlett scored four times for the Dutchmen on runs of 53, 49, 33, and 78 yards. In the 1941 clash, Warren Lamke spoiled a Union Alumni homecoming weel<- end by crashing over four touch- downs, as RPI won by its largest margin, 82-0. THE BIGGEST scot•e ever run up In the contests to date was the 45-0 trouncing handed the Trojans in the 1916 game at Troy. Four ties have resulted, two of them were 0 to 0 stalemates. Union owns the longest winning streak, winning ten games in a row, be- tween 1899 and 1916. A Union vic- tory this year would mean two triumphs in a row, since the Gar- net gridders took the bunting iast year, with a 35-14 victory.

McLaughry The so-called split or Missouri. \T\ is a variation of the regular \T\ that enjoyed better than aver- age success last year, and is again showing to advantage this year. Some of the nine successful experi- ments of this attack are the Uni- versities of Oklahoma, Missouri,, and Maryland. In our own league, Williams and Hamilton are using it with good success. THE USE of the word \split\ is confusing, I believe, to >the aver- age football fan. What is meant is that there are splits of varying widths or gaps between all the of- fensive linemen rather than just between the ends and tackles. How- ever, this system of splitting is used by many so-called orthdox \T\ teams also, but is done in a different manner and with some- times different motives. I wi]l deal only with the Missouri \T\, for to delve into the others would be an article in itself. NORMALLY, an offensive team employing a \T\ will split its ends from the .tackles from a half to sometimes a little more than a yard, This is done in order to give the ends blocking angles on the tackles, and to spread the line somewhat to help inside plays. An average spread of such a line is from 20 to 23 .feet. The \split\ line goes a step further and splits the tackles from the guards, anywhere from a foot to three feet, and the guards from the center from sL\. inches to half a yard. This gives a line spread of between 25 and 29 feet, depending on the size of the splits. IT CAN be seen that splitting the line will require the d'efense to make adjustments. If the defensive linemen maintain their normal· in• terval, disregarding the spread of the offense, they will find: them- selves outflanked and open to wide plays. If they spread and play the same relative spot in regard to their offensive opponents, wide .gaps . will be left to the inside. In the split \T\ concept of play, the fewer defensive linemen there are, the wider the splits, and vice versa. Thus against a five man line, the Tomorrow the Union College line will sp1it its maximum dis- FreshiTan Cross Country Team tance, whereas against a seven man opens its season against R.P.I, at line, the splits will be small.

It was later discovered that first term freshman representatives had participated in the voting. Ac- cording to the newly revised Union College Student Body Constitution accepted last spring, first term freshman are not permitted to vote. The second motion made by Van Ost concerning the prom also re- ceived a favorable vote ( 16to 5) at the Tuesday session. It states, \that the Union Co.Jlege Student Council, depending upon support furnished by ti:J.e national rr. emorial fund committee, foster a can:paign to encourage the student councils Qr student .governing organizations of other colleges throughout the country to aid in the fight against cancer by sponsoring major benefit da-nces for the Damon Runyon memorial fund . THE VOTING followed a discus- sion by the council members on what seems to be the general opinion on call\.pus of running a benefit dance. Major objections voiced were that a dance of this type might set a precedent and that students would rather see a benefit dance aid needy students, rather than a distant, national campaign. Weekend Marks Return of Alumni For 23rd· Reunion By Jay Cohn Nearly 800 old grads are expected to return to their alma mater this weekend as Union celebrates its 23rd annual Home-Coming ahtmni festivities. · Harry W. Langworthy, Jr., '32, chairman of this year's Home-Coming committee, hopes for an alumni gathering as large as last year's, when the turnout was the best since pre- war days. Begun in 1923, mainly through the efforts of Rev. W. N. P. Dailey, '84, the late S. P. McClellan, '81, and the late John C. Van Yoast, '87, and continued since then except for a lapse during the war years of 1942-45, the annual weekend has been gaining in popularity each year. Its purpose is to bring the alumni together once quring the fall so that \they can see the col- lege as it actually it, a working in- stitution of learning.\ THE WEEKEND activities got underway this afternoon when alumni visited regular classes and laboratories and the executive com- mittee uf the Graduate Council' held a meeting. Tonight the men are being entertained at a dinner at Hale house . The program tomorrow morning will feature a meeting of the Grad- ute Council at 9:30 in Old Chapel, open to all alumni on campus. Prin- cipal business of the session will oe the election of five members-at- large to the executive committee dnd four members-at-large to the HARRY w. LANGWORTHY Council. Three men will also be ---------------· nominated as alumni trustees, to be elected later by mail ballot. The Board of Trustees will meet in r'resident Carter Davidson's office at 10 a.m. r ..

You won't find it complete because the few ;men working on the project have found it hard to get help from the apathetic student body. But they are trying to open Nov. 1. You will see a soda fountain almost complete and some painting done. The big things the organization needs right now are a plumber and a few painters. ,Look the place over good because the next time you come here you will un- doubtedly be entertained there some time during your visit. The rathskeller is going to sell sandwiches, bee1· and other soda fountain items. It will be open to all students of age and all guests of the college.

McLaughry I have c·n numerous occasions been aslfed why Union uses the so- caned \Wing-T'' rather than the regular \T\ formation as used by .r ost of the college' and pro teams. There a:re n:any arguments in favor of both offenses, but I think in the final anal~sis the use of one in pre- ference to the other is entire!~ de- pendent upon the mater.ial at hand. \THE WING-T\ has, I believe, a little more power than the regular \T.\ On the other hand the regu- lar \T\ allows for a more diversi- fied attack and can better exploit any outstanding speed in the back- field. Both offenses can be very deceptive, and there is little to chose bet\\ een them in this respect. We use the \Wing-T\ here at Union because, with one exception, we do not have any reai fast and ex- plosive hacks. They are mostly power t unnet s who rely on change Jf pace and blocking when they get in thE' broken field. A description of the \Wing 'T' \ tnd its vadations is in order, and I will try and point out the im- ,.JOt tant phases of this form of at- •ack. Most \Wing-'T'\ offenseo •mploy the balanced line, although 1 few such as Syracuse and Ohio 5tate use an unbalanced line. Co- :umbia was one of the earlier ex- ;>onents of the '\Wing-'T'\ and fit sf tsed the unbalanced line; then in !946 they switched to the balanced in e. ThE't e are good argument!' or both, but I think the style of mcklleld maneuvers has more to do .\'ith the type of line used than mything else. )lOST \\\'IXG-'T'\ offenses line JP with a half bnck in one of three 1 Jositiun:;. As a wingback, a yard ' •ack anJ a ya1 d outside of one of he offen~ivc ends; as a flanker :: iUlds or mote outside of the of en~ive end, and finally behind or ust inside of the offensive end tbout 3 yat·ds deep. Columbia em- Jloys its wing back in all three of hese positions. Union lines it: \'ing-back up, in mo~t cases, in the hird mentioned spot, but occasion 11iy in the first. THE PURPOSE of the winr ··ack is to put pt essure on the de· ensive tackle or end, and in the 1econd and third positions men Joned abo\'e it is the end. ThiP !' not possible in the regular \T' ~nless a tlanlter or man-in-motion s used. in which case. Jhe \T\ in 1ctuality becomes a wing \T\. The other two backs, a half-back ·wd the full back, line up in posi- tions three to four yards deep in a number of different spots in the backfield. For example, Lou Little plays his half-back 4 yards deep directly behind the tackle in the side away from where the wing back lined up. The full back takes a position three yards deep about behind the guard on the side of the wing back. This gives a more balanced backfield set-up than some and has its advantages. HERE at Union. we employ a heavily overshifted formation and a close fullback. The half-back Jines up directly behind the cen- - tel; four yards deep, and the full- ba~k two yards deep behind the split between the guard and tackle on the side of the wing back. This gives more power to the side .w,e are shifted than does Columbta s lineup, but weakens our power to the so called \short side.\ There are numerous other backfield align- ments, but these will suffice to give_ you some idea about the whys and wherefores of the so-called \Wing- T.\ ----0'\\'\---- RECORDS The record of the most points scored in a season qy Union foot- ball teams of the past is as follows: 1891-226 points in 6 games 1894-281 points in 12 games 1939-208 points in 18 games f 5 D.

CoJincil Challenge The.re was no need for the student cbuncil f;:trce of last week in which a special meeting had to be called to revote the Damon Runyon Memorial idea for a winter prom. If the council members had been on their toes, they would have known whether the freshmen on the council had a right to vote or not. ' As a matter of fact, entirely too much time is wasted on the council because no one knows what laws are in effect now (except very recent ones). Men are continually taking time during meetings to check back and make sure that this or that motion hasn't been passed before, or that such and such is legal. Why doesn't the president make up a list of all the mo- tions and recommendations of the council which are in effect now? There should be no one on campus who is not aware of them. Above all, the council members themselves should not be entirely ignorant. We challenge the council to get up such a list and guar- antee that we will run a fea'ture story on it as soon as it's completed. · Humor? Under the guise of humor, a columnist named Bill Steh1· has written an article for the current issue of the RPI \Pup\ entitled \Union's Still a Pup\ which is not only humorless but malicious. We don't mind humor directed at us if it is well done and does not harm. We do mind below-the-belt humor bor- del'ing on the libelous. This is below-the-belt, close to libel, and not even funny. We shall not quote the article because it does not de- serve that much attention. Stehr, however, should apologize before we get mad. Elliott Tom Elliott dese1·ves a compliment for the excellent way he presented the rathskeller situation to the Graduate Coun- cil last Saturday. Tom has the facility of saying the :right thing at the right time. The college could use mo1·e leaders like him. Letters to the Editor Dear Editor: This is written in reference to a pseudo-\Pitchin' Horshoes\ article in the October 14th issue of the Concordy, written under the rather melodramatic title, \The Rest Is Silence.\ The author seems to have summed up his article quite near its beginning when he writes, \I have never bothered to orient myself fully in regard. to the construction or nomenclature of your girdles, corsets and brassieres.\ Perhaps he would have felt less need to write that rather desperate attempt at humor had he but reap ali article in the October 15th Saturday Evening Post, entitled, ''Her Half-Billion Dollar Shape,\ by Pete Martin. It might have made him aware that his spurious generalizations would come wide of the mark. I really have little interest in the author's contacts with girls from Skidmore. If he chooses to consort with women who are \dangerous\ and finds nothing but bear traps that's purely his own affair. May I suggest, though, that the author confine himself to a specific subject with which he is familiar in order not to waste valuable space which could be used for another advertisement. I haven't the heart to ask that his articles be interesting. too! Dear Editor, Respectfully Yours, FRED CURE. Having read Dave Markson's article on the young corseted pulch- ritudes at Skidmore college, I am interested in hearing his viewpoint on the ''sweet Sage girls.\ If he is unfamiliar with that territory, per- haps someone else could reply. Since I am asking for a sincere answer I would appreciate my name being withheld-also I'd like to continue attending Russell Sage.

'· Freshman Gridders To Close Season Union Mauls Hobart 39-0; Harriers to Face Williams By Bill Hen•man With a record of one win and three losses, the Union College cross-country team meets Williams College tomorrow at Williamstown. The Garnet harriers lost to Col-· ga.te last Friday by a score of 33 to 22 over the home course. COACH BILL KETZ is planning on starting the same five men as last week, Abe Lakshin, Alex: Me· Cormick, Dave Brown, Dick Me· chanic, and Townsend McCoun., . However, instead of using Don Brigh,tman and Bill Wright as th.e, · sixth and seventh men Don Morr1-, son and Gus Nirdlinger will round out the squad. Williams has the same team as last year, when the undefeated . Dutchman runners defeated them 24 to 33. VeteFan Ephmen back are Kelton, Delaney, Cook, Dorwin, and Hutton. Union was at its peak for that J:l}eet. Laskhin, the only man left from the Garnet squad, finished over a minute behind Wil· Iiams' Kelton. THE COURSE at Williams is the shortest one the Garnet will run this year. Approximately 3.9 miles long, it includes two hills, which may be to Lakshin's advantage. However, the Williams team is more experienced and Ketz says that they will be favored. . In last Fritlay's meet, Lakshm led for the first three and a half miles, but was then caught by Hanlon of Colgate, who then went on to win in 26:38. Lakshin fin- ished second, clocked at 26:45, over a minute slower than his record of 25:35, set three weeks ago. Stultz of Colgate was third and MacCor- mick, the only other Union man in the first five, was fourth. TOMORROW'S meet will start at 12:15 and will finish before the start of the football game instead of between the halves as has been the case. Watching & Waiting Yardstick u.

UNION SCORED thrice in both the first and third periods, losing no time, whatsoever, as it drove to an early score, with George Best skirting right end for 30 yards and the marker on the Garnet's fourth ,offensive play of the contest.

MUDDY field could not slow down Union's shifty, hard running · aces, and quarterback Dave Strauss had little trouble flinging the wet pigskin, for he hit Best in the end zone for a second T.D., soon after Gwrge's initial gallop into paydirt. Both of these early scores were set Union's spirited soccer team will up in part, by Wade, who was run- trek to Williamstown tomorrow to ni~g better than the 1947 \'Alley' take on powerful Williams in an Ghost.\ Union's next score was a effort to gain their first win of bolt from the blue, as a mighty the season after dropping last Strauss heave was taken in by Ray week's contest to Hamilton by the Pomeroy, via a mighty leap. This close margin of 1-0. · end struggled to the eight for a fifty five yard gain. WILLIAMS, reputed to be one of F.our plays later, Spiedel ·cra~ked the best soccer squads in this sec- over to make it 19-0.

This means that much of the Garnet scoring punch is lost, which indicates that the fray may be one of defensive nature. sprints by Wilsey carried to the •aight, from where George Morrow went to work with Snow to blast to the one. Snow went the final yard to tally, which helped to con- sole Charley for his 95 yard cross- country touchdown, earlier in the half, that was to no avail due to a clipping penalty called against the Garnet.
