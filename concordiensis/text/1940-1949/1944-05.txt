No. 9 Palmer, Athletic Officer Takes New Duties Today; E.berlein Succeeds Taylor Two of Union's new officers have arrived and will soon assume their duties. They are Lt. (j.g·.) Wm. F. Eberlein, who will take over the Administrative office recently occu- pied by Lieut. Taylor, and Lt. (j. g.) John Palme1·, who will fill the Physical Training Dept. position left vacant by the transfer of Lt. !j.g.> Zenti. Lieutenant Eberlein has :been in the Nav:y .for 17 months; he was stationed at San Fransico, Cal·if., doing ·Compass and DeGaLssing work. He is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin and the Harvard Graduate School in 1938. Mr. Eberlein received his indoc- trination training at Dartmouth College and was graduated as an engineering oft'icet. P. T. Officer Palmer The new Lieutenant likes the Navy way of Life very much. He is happy to be stationed at Union and says he likes it very much, al- though he has not been here long. Our new Physical Training Offi- cer, Lt. Palmer, has been in the Navy a few months less than two years and likes it very much but he doesn't think he would like to stay in after the war. He has been stationed at Park College, Missouri, a small college just ot: t- side Kansas City, Missouri. He was P.T. Officer of the V-12 Unit there also. Besides his work in colleges, Mr. Palmer spent nine months in San Diego Naval Base, pushing \boot\ companies through their training. After San Diego he put in two months at Norfolk as a \boot\ company commander there. Palmer, originally a Californi- an, he coached High school foot- ball at Oakland, California. He just arrived in Schenectady on Thursday. ----0---- Concordy Dinner Approximately .forty members and guests of the Concordiensis will wine and dine tonight at Ferro's at their annual banquet which will be held to reward the staft' fot· their untiring efforts In putting out the college newspaper.

Schenectady Man Meets Death in Cali.fornia Chi Psi Fraternity Brother Lieut. Robert C. Maxon, former Schenectady physician and gradu- ate of Union College's class of '31, died Friday in the naval hospital at San Diego naval station of \multiple injuries.'' Enlisting in the naval reserve in August, 1942, Lieut. Maxon was assigned to the medical corps at San Diego Naval Air Station. He is believed to be the first Schenec- tady doctor to die in service in this war. His first position with the Navy after completing his indoctrination at the Brooklyn Navy Yard was as medical officer at the newly com- pleted Scotia Navy Supply depot, where he remained until June of 1943. While at the Scotia depot he was commended for his interest in the welfare and physical condition of the men stationed there and was instrumental In getting plans underway for an athletic field at the depot. As a tribute to Dr. Maxon, the field was named Maxon · field. From Scotia he was transferred to the Pensacola air station, to a station in Oklahoma, and then to San Diego. While in Union Lieut. Maxon was a member of the Chi Psi fraternity. Upon graduation he entered the College of Physicians and St:rgeons at New York city. After this, he set up practice in Schenectady, later becoming a member of the staff at Ellis hospital. Lt. Fay Begor Awarded Navy Cross Destroyer Escort to Bear His Name Lt. Fay Begor, Union '37, has <S>---------------- been awarded, posthumously, the Navy Cram for \extraordinary he- roism and devotion to duty.\ He had previously been awarded the Order of the Ptrple Heart. As a still greater honor, a Destroyer !Ds- cort vessel will be named after .him and will be christened :by his widow, Mrs. Fay Begor of Mont- real. Begor graduated from Union and then went to McGill University, Montreal. While at Union he was a member of Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity, the Psychology Club, the Biology Club a nd the Getman ·Club. At McGill he was awarded a medal for outstanding work in medicine, this was presented to him by the Governor General of Canada. In 194() he was married to Miss Kathryn Savage. A daughter, Ann, has been born to them. Enlisting in the United States Navy in June 1942, he went on active duty in September at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. In May 1943 he was transferred to sea duty in the South Pacific Area.

UndH the impression that this marks the established maturity of an import- ant phase of our College service, the Trustees have called a College Convocation. This will be held in the Memorial Chapel at 1:30 P. M. The academic procession will form in front of the Old Chapel at 1:15. The speakers will be Lowell Thomas, famous newscaster of tHe National Broadcasting Company and George D. Stoddard, Commis- sioner of Education for the State of New York. The program and the com·ocation itself. will pay respect to the educational powers of the radio in our time. The hon- orary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters will be •conferred on Mt·. Thomas, as an outstanding repre- sentative of radio journalism. Lowell Thomas Is an author and lecturer of note besides being one of the top news commentators on the air, having been on continuous- ly since 1930. He has been the com- mentator for the 20th Century- Fox Movietone since 1935. Mr. Thomas has become a world trav- eler in his wanderings in official capacities and on his own as an author. He was chief of the civilian ntission sent to Europe by Pres. Wilson to prepare a historical rec- ord of World War I; he accom- panied the Prince of Wales on a tour of India; he was attached at different times, to the Belgian, French, Italian, Serbian, American British and Arabian Armies; h~ was the official historian of the Palestine Campaign and the Ara- bian Revolution. Thesoe last, he has written about in his popular, \With Lawrence in Arabia\. To top this off he has written books about everything from Softball to a Life of Rudyard Kipling. His books are always popular and are written in a style that is spellbinding. . This br.oadcast should be par- tteularly Interesting and all who can attend are cot·dially invited. There will be a special Hale House Sunday Dinner for the families of the Faculty, the Naval Officers, the Naval Aeronautics Staff and their personal guests. This will be at 12:00 Noon. PROM DETAILS PROGRESSING, HOUSING FOR GIRLS PLANNED Final atTangements for the Prom·~ at·e getting under way, with all indications of its being a smash- ing succet•s. Interest seems to be growing day .by day, and a large group is expected to attend. The pt oblem of housing for out- of-town dates is being partially solved. The civilian students have ananged fot· their dates to stay at the Delta Chi ho~;se. As for the dates of Navy men, it is possible that through the kind efforts of the faculty wive<', a number of pt ivate homes will be opened to the girl friends of Un- ion's sailors. It is believed that a list of homes a vailablc for .over- night stay will be released some- time next week. · A/S Thomas R.

Garnet Scores Garnet errors coupled with some good solid clouts delivered by the Yellowjackets gave the visitors a big lead in the second inning which they never relinquished. In the second stanza they piled up a four- run lead, then added to it by put- ting over another counter in the third and four more in the sixth, when Dutchman hurler Chesebor- m:g.h was relieved by \Fireman\ Lefty Sherman. The lone Garnet tally was ac- counted for by Bob Sise, Union third sacker, who singled to left and then was pushed around the sacks by a Jacket misplay and a fielder's choice and then came • across the platter on a wild pitch by Rochester twirler Neal Nelson. Nelson pitched an outstanding game for the JacketS', limiting the Garnet to five safeties. Gweinek led the Rochester hit- ters with three safeties in four FOCU IIA RIIERS.

The breaks,. 0r rather the main break, which occurred in the last half of the n.inth inning, was defi- nitely a feather in the caps of the Middlebary m0b. With none out and Floyd Hand- ley parked on third by virtue of his clean Ieft-center bingle and a two-base error by the Panther sec- ond sacker·, \Mule\' Haas stepped up to the platter to try to bring in Handley with the tying run and Lange, who was on fi·rst, with the winning counter, but Fate ruled otherwise. Pit·t ure hy f'(~te Poulos Here's George \Mule\ Haas, Garnet slugger, taking a cut at the ha 1 l during last Saturday's festivities with the Middlebm-y club. Panthers went on to win, 6-5. Appat·ently \'Mule\ picked up a dr-ied-out bat, because with two strikes on hirn he took a cut at a· ·pitch delivered by the Panther twirl- er Webber and his war· club split, the broken butt end of the stick flying out toward third where Handley was taking a big lead. The apple also was heading that way and looked for a short minute as if it, would clear the Mi·ddlebury third baseman's head, but he snared it to put the \Mule\ on ice. The butt ~;uu or tne bat struck Floyd Hanu- ley 0n the noggin' while he was off the sack, and the Panther third sacker tagged the cushion to make it a double play. Kenny Forbes, next Dutchman to step to the plate, went down tries, and \Mule\ Haas continued his previous pace for the Garnet by pounding out a ringing double to center field. \Fireman\ Lefty Sherman showed up well for the homesters, also, in his hurling relief role. for the count to end the game with the Panthers in the lead, 6-5. z-Limlsa;· .. , , ........ 1 o o o o 0 George Burpee and George Haas Shermau, I> , , , , . , .••• 1 0 0 0 0 0 d h _ _ _ _ __ _ crosse t e plate for the Garnet in Tota!H ......... , .... :t! 1 :J :!'i' 8 z-Battetl for Shennan in !tth. 3 the second and third innings, re- spectively, to give the Union club RudtP'tl'l\- .\B It u 1'0 .\ E a 2-0 lead, but the Panthers re- Vaeth, 3h ... , ... , .... 4 o 1 1 tali a ted with two three-run rai- Fiyun. :lh ............ 1 o o o lies in both the sixth and seven.th ~lark. \\ , . , ..... , ... ;; I l stanzas. :which set the homesters Box score: l\nion- AB R H PO A E :\\ebxm !I • • · · · · · · · • • • 4 0 o 0 back on their heels to the tune of · \\-erner, -lh .......... 5 0 4 n 1 6-2.

And it is most apparent that no one enjoys these stories more than the man who tells them. If the powers in Washington were looking for a man who has an interest in world affairs, they have not erred in coming to Uni0n for Professor Langsam, who has devoted nearly half of his life to teaching history in three different colleges. Raised in New York City A New Yorker, Professor Lang- sam was born in 1906 on the tur- bulent island of Manhattan. He is a graduate of De Witt Clinton High School, an all-boys' school which was then located in the part of the city appropriately called \Hell's kitchen.\ Next came four years at the City College of New York and a B..\\. degree in 1925. Dr. Langsam came through with more than his diploma to show for his efforts at C.C.N.Y.; he had a Phi Beta Kappa ke~·. the Gold. Medal for History, and $150 which he had won for a prize essay. Here he got a taste of cadence and related subjects, enough to earn the rank of cadet major in the ROTC. Later he became a lieu- tenant in the Army Reserve.

In addition to teaching at the schools mentioned already, Dr. Langsam has taught graduate courses in the summer at Duke, Ohio State, and the Univets:ty of British Columbia in Vancouver. His summers in 1928, 1934, and 1937 were spent touring France, Bel- gium, Switzerland, Germany, Aus- tria, Hungary, Italy, Yugoslavia, and Greece. Although he often took time out to participate in his well-known many course din- ners and drawn-out yarn-spinning contest, Dr. Langsam's main in- terest was in studying the recent history of Austria and other Cen- tral European countries. In 1934 the Langsams were in the state archives in Vienna; when their work was finished, they left, and four minutes later Chancellor Doll- fuss was murdct·ed by the Nazis in that very same building. \That Dr. Langsam kidded, \was the closest I ever want to come to revolution. MI s. Langsam and I had seen Dollfues only a few days before at Innsbruck.\ It was in the state archives buildings in Pat·is and Vienna that Dr. Lang- sam studied the manuscripts of Maria Theresa, Napoleon, Francis II, and Josef II of Austria. This matel\ial has helped him consider- ably in compiling his fiv~ books, the best known of which is \The \Vorld Rince 1914.\ Thus far there have been five editions of this book in ten years and twent~·-five print- . ings. It is currently used in over , three hundred colleges; in addi-! tion, Dr. Lang~am is now historical i editor for the Lippencott Publish- ing Company. After spending a year at Colum- bia University, Professor Langsam earned his M.A. degree-this while managing a wholesale aluminum house for \spending money.\ In 1926, while still studying at Co\ lumbia <this time for his Ph.D.), Professor Langsam started his career as a teacher of history in Public Speai>PI' City College.

The \old\ gymnasium, resplendent in its new suit of tropical foliage and Mexican lan- terns, makes one long for the easy moving life of our South·of-the- Border ally.

Dick has been featured at the Park Central, Lincoln and New Yorker Hotels in New York City.

Sweet and lovely Martha Perry has been carrying- the vocals for the orchestra tonight. She poe- sesses that \Voice You Love to Touch\' and a certain wal'mth that makes the fellows cuddle even closer (if possible) to their dates. MarstN·s-Master of Legerdemain As an added attraction Jim Marsters. better known as Marsters the Magician, is putting on one of his best acts. His performance includes the famous linking rings mutine which he has developed along his own line for the past several years. Several s0uvenir surprises are awaiting some lucky girls during the Marsters exhibi- tion. Jim will be accompanied at the Prom by Miss Shirley McKin- ney of Pittsburgh, Fa. Many will remember the fine performance put on by Jim at the smoker last February.

CAMPUS IN SPRING The Barden Bill would use State School Agencies in operating the vetetan education; while the Ran- kin Bill would t se a Federal Agency and superVISion would come directly from Washington. , To the many ne\'1.' Navy students, the cam- pus has lately undergone a surprising· meta- morphosis. Where drc:l!!J, gTeyish colors pre- viously dominated the view, fresh, lively green has suddenly appeared. To those who have never seen the campus in any but its \gTaveyard\ outlook, this is a pleasant change. Yes, ll nion's campus does not always have that \English\, misty appearance-it too can be \young and ~ray\ in Spring:. IJa!Ten. l'etlwps after a \Yhile, they too will disa.ppear. Thl' trees are beginning to exhibit their as .\'et scanty mantle or leaves, and some of the bushes are in full bloom.

To avert bureaucracy, t_he A;me_r- i ican Council on EducatiOn IS m favor of an Amending Omnibus Bill so that selection of institutions and other logical administi·ative mat- ters may be vested in existing State Agencies or agencies that they will create for this purpose. For the oldtimers, this perennial rejuven- ation is nothing to get excited about. They have seen the campus in its most fascinating Summer splendor·-which it will not attain for some time as yet-and to them the dreary Wintertime is only an inten·egnum. The gmss, subject of many arg·uments, no- tices, and editorials, hm;; assumed its .iuicy green appearance and, with its already quite extensive growth, has covered the footprints of the careless Winter trespassers.

Sitting in the executive office, he always seems ready and wiiJling to offer help and advice and malily times a special 'liberty pass or .other favors have been granted by him. The life of Lt. Brubalter centerS' almost entirely around a great edu- cational career. He was born and educated in Kansas. He attended McPherson College ftoom which he graduated with a B. A. degree. While at college, he was on the debating team for three years, the last year being on a team which won the state championship. He. was also Secretary-Treasurer· of· his class, member of the student council and glee club. FoHowing this, he taught in lrtaho for fi:Ve years and also was a principal and superintendent ·of public schools during this time. Coaching fO!\t- ball, basketball, and basebaH a;Jso comprised some of his duties here. His next venture was at the Uni- versity of Kansas where he at- tained his M. A. degree.

When he enter· ed the Navy sixteen months ago, <he brought with him seventeen year·s of coaching experience. For the ,;even years immediately pre- ceding his entrance into the Navy, the Lieutenant was on the athletic staff of Purdue University, holding the postions of bac·kfield coach for foothali, \~arsity coach, assistant varsity basketba-ll coach, and As- sh;tant Profe~sor of Physical Edu- ·Cation. F-ive years previously he was was head foetball, baseball, and basketbal coach at Massachusetts State College. During his long coaching career, Lt. Tau•be has been associated with many outstanding athletes. Cecil Is- bell and Lou Brock of the Packers, John Petty of the Bear·s, and John Drake, formerly of the Cleveland Rams, a1·e all ex-players of Lt. Taube. An athlete of no mean abil- ity hi·msel.f, he was one of the few four-letter men in the history of Purdue. Lt. Taube has a hard time deciding whether football m· basket- ball is his favor·ite sport.

Brubaker served in the Public Shcool System at Pomona, C~li­ fornia as chairman of the Enghsh and Speech Department. Other positions held by him included membership in the executive com- mittee ef Southern CaJi.fornia Col- lege Association for three years, chairman of the academic commit- tee which counciled and recom- mended students for college en- trance, and commissioner of For- en:;ie;; for the Soulhei·n Califot nia Jun.ior College Association for seven years. He was also Secretary- Treasurer of the Pacific Coast sec- tion of Phi Rho Pi, a national Junior College speech association, for about five years. Being a mem- ber of Phi Delta Kappa, an hon- orary national educational fratern- ity proves Lt. Brubaker's high scholastic record. Service Career He also holds membership in the American Legion, having served in the army for approxi- mately nine months in the ranks during the last year. 1 Lt. Brubaker's naval career started upon being commissioned on March 12, 1943, after being selected as one of about 250 edu- cators who have been chosen for the V-12 program. Upon comple- tion of indoctrination at Columbia University for about two months, Lt. Brubker reported here on June 1, 1943, as officer-in-charge of this station. He remained in this capa- city until the commanding officer, Lt. Commander Horner arrived in June 26th after which time he as- sumed duties as the Executive Of- ficer. During this latter part of the time, the •Organization of the program at this station rested on his shoulders and he accomplished this duty very efficiently. ,At present Lt.

A director of the Schenectady Rotary Club, he was recently nominated for the vice- presidency but had to decline in favor· of his new job. The surpris- ing Dr. Langsam is also vice-presi- ' dent of the Benedicts, the local 1 dancing club. To the question, \Do you dance well?\ he replied, .\Put it this way-! lilm to dance.\ He is at present hale and hearty after having given up an even gallon of blood thus far to the Red Cross! A.s one might expect, Professor 1 1 Langsam's most embarrassing mo- ment was a corker. He wa:lked into a lectur·e room full of women at a YWCA in Newark one day and decided to begin his talk cas- ually. Smoothly he sat down on a table-a card table, J:nfortunately- and went down in a heap, table and all. \The agonizing thing about the whole affair,\ complained Dr. Langsam, \was that instead of laughing, these girls kept a dead silence and didn't ct•ack a smile!\ He once won the admiration t if not worship) of 4000 weary attend- ants o'f a commencement program at Ohio State University. The tem- perature was ninety-seven degrees that day, and 'Dr. Langsam .finish- ed his commencement day speech in sixteen minl!tes flat! Dr. Langsam's .two young sons expressed great joy when informed that the family was leaving fat· Washington. \Evidently ventured Dr. Langsam, \the kidS> thought there are no schools down there.\ Professor Langsam was married during his stay in. Columbia to Miss Julia Stubblefield of Chicago. A graduate of the class of 1926 at Cornell, she met Dr. Langsam in New York City. Their sons, Walter Eaton and Jeoffrey Harding are all set to attend Union and thus far their parents have voiced no objection. At present, however, both boys are still cracking their· .three R's in grammar school. Professor Langsam will argue, diS>ct:ss or inform .f1·eely on matters concerning history, but he sternly refuses to do any crystal-gazing. \I know a little about the past and not n darn thing ahout the future,\ hr nff<'n .,a\'.' with an ail uf final- ity Thnt ~~llll> up :ht· vic\\·,; of a man who believes in the applica- : finn of a solid knowledge in:;tcad of inacc male j.; u,., ,;work.

Highland, an old 1 un ha:; a long .Joster uf entrar.ts Union student, now a V-12 Trainee, including C. T. Mathew;, Vaughan, ·already has a long and credible record in track. Thel'e is little won- der when one sees the alm!)E't un- believable fot'm he possesses in his daily workouts. Art comes from Elmont, Long Island, and attended Sewaahaka High School at Floral Park, gradu- ating in 1942. At that school he was on the track team for three years and the cross country team one year. In his senior year, he cap- tained both of these teams. Art confined his activities on the track squad to the half-mile 1 un for which he holds the school record at 2:03. Of his eight starts in his last scholastic sea::oon he won five and took seconds in the remaining three. In 1942 he ·placed second in the Long Island Sectional Meet, forcing the man who defeat- ed him to set a new record, At the end of the season Highland was the high scorer of the team and was chosen as the outstanding track man of the season. In his only year of cross-ccmn try he led the team to a successful season and climaxed the campaign by talt- ing the fifth slot in the Nassau- Suffolk Championships. Upon grad- uating. Art was offered a track scholarship to La Salle Military Academy of Long Island, but de- clined. Highland says that if it had not been for the war he would have eagerly accepted, for at La Salle he would have benefited from the additional year of scholastic competition and coaching that he <Continued on Page 10) Bloom, Malloy, and BiH Webster Bill Eddy stands forth a:i' the lea('- ing hurdlPJ' avai,lable and wHl com- pete in both the hig·h and the low hurdles.

Moving on to the broad jump, Versaci, K8mpple, and Bill Hol!y have been p1 act icing consistently of late while in the javelin Iossing depaltment. Bob Yetra and Joe Ricciardone are the outstanding performers. During the interview, Perkins wanted it to be stressed: that if there a1 e any men on campus who have had previous t1ack experience und who· would be willing to turn out fm· the Garnet track squad, they should by all means communi- cate right away with Head Track Coach Bill Ketz or Jess himself. \There are still many positions on the team wide open,\ stated Jess, \and if there are any other fellows who have had experience, we cou;d really use them right away, as our first meet is staring us in the face·-just a week away.\ Breakfast -Luncheon - Dinner Sunday Dinner 838 UNION STREET We Cater for Parties PATTON & HA.LL I X-RAY FITTING 245 State St. for 5() Years ~~~~~-~---~~--··~----~~~~~ Tonight~s Let's Do the It Night Right A·TTENTION!

The merry-go-round of ex.cite- ment starts when the train pui'Js in. A really terrific idea would be to have a big, blary, brass band on hand to greet the fair guests, but the most .ever accomplished in the Une of planned greetings is for the Union hosts to be fortunate and sober enough to meet the right train and on time. After the ball game, when all have settled in their temporary quarters long enough to scrub their eager faces until they shine, prepared to be doused the next minute with powder, paint and other· face conc0ctions, the time is ripe for starting out on the rampage young America has the audacity to term \house parties\. WhHe dancing (if you do con- descend to dance at all, which is rarely done even among the best of friends) it might be a good idea to keep just one eye -on your date -you know the saying about put- ting all your eggs in one basket. As for beverages more potent than ginger ale or Vichy, capacity is the governing fadot·, but an idea which is amazingly practical is to let the men in the crowd reach their quota only after the ladies have given indications of reaching theirs. May we, in the ben~v·olence of a:H souls, suggest to teetotallers the next best thing; a coke or two at the Scuttlebutt between hops. Good advice to Union car drivers would be, \Have your gas tanks weH filled be.fope venturing forth. \'The old gagR about \not having a drop .Jeft\ when the car stalls had their season long ago. Girls are a little too sharp these days to be hooked by such•like; that is, H they don't want to be •b,ood~vinked, not even a little bit.

C., S. S. -1 rcoster, 1 To you, OUl' dead heroes, we have dedicat- ed this issue of the \Concordy\. We have done this to show our appreciation or your great sacrifice. We me proud of you. Proud, because yol:l are men of Union-because you once were part of tlS. Proud, because ~·o~l are men of America, and as such are not only our heroes, bHt also heroes of all l'ighteous people throughout the world. v\'e wish to honor you, but you have passed into another world. We can onl~· honor your memory. It is a small way in which we can show how highly we value that whieh you have done. You are men of l! nion-gTaduates who went out into the world to find that it was not full of roses but of thorns, and mu.l.er- graduates \Yho left in the middle of your college career to answer the call to battle. You are our heroes. \\'e knew man~· of you as fellow students, as fratemity brothel'S, and as comrades. :.\lany of om· unforg:etable memories are associated \\'ith you. Our grief over your deaths is g-reat. The fact that they shall not have been in vain i.s our on!~· con- solation. You entered the war, knowing that war was necessary fo1· our survival. Some of you enlisted, othe1·s were drafted. You knew that this war would not he eas~· to win. You knew that man~· sacrii'ices would be demanded by the g-od of war. But you also knew that the wa1· would be won. Nations fighting· fo1· jus- tice cannot Jose-their st1·ength is too g1·eat to suffer defeat. You knew that you might never return, and ~·et, ~·ou went fearlessly -you knew that it rnust be, that there was no alternative. anct that it was wot'th the cost. You fought everywhere among the far- flung battlefields-all theaters of war have seen you. They saw you come, they saw ~·ou fight, and they saw ~··ou die-as they llHd seen many others. :Medals have been be- stowed upon you, men-of-wa.r named in your honor, your name has been mentioned in of- ficial citations-you have done honor to yom· country and your college. You died in far-off places. In fox-holes on land, in ships on the high seas, and in planes in the air. Buried in strange lands, you are reminders to the world that we too can fight, and die if need be, for our country. You died in youth. Your life was still ~·oung. Little had you yet seen of the world-the world from which ~·ou had expected so much. Yoms wa.s the greatest of all sacrifices. You could not have given more. You were fighting for your country. You had responded to the call to the colors. Per- haps you did not know wh~·. Perhaps you did not think al.Jout it. You kne\v that it was ,\'OHl' duty, and so perhaps you did not question it. However, some of ~·ou knew. Some ot' yon must ha\'e known the real reasons. No, you die! not fight for wealth, for fame, ol' for po\rer. N m did you fig-ht \to free the wol'ld for democracy\. You foug-ht because you were attacked, because someone wanted to dest1 oy ~-om· wa~- of living-. He wanted to impress his philosophy of lite ltpon ~·on-upon a-ll of us. You fought to prevent that. Yon fou~>:ht to preserve your customs, yom traditions, your institutions, and your right of individualit~·. That is why you fought: that is why you died: that is wh~· we call you our heroes. You did not like fighting. llm\·ever, ~·nu knew that it had to be, and so you did not hesitate. As a matter of fact, you were fight- ing against \fighting\. You wanted this war to be the war to encl all \\'Hl's. \You hopect fer- vently that thi::; would be the last time. You die! eve1 ything- in :-.·our p:1wer to make it that. Yet, a quarter century ago, your fathers too had hoped that it would 'be the last time. It was not. They failed in their attempt. Shall we'? ShaH this war be followed by an- other one in a few decades'? \Ye say \~o\: We owe it to you to make it the last time. Our honor would be stained if we fail again, if another such Internecine camage should de\·astnte mankind. ~ o, we sh~lll not Jet your deaths Le in vain! Your spirit is our inspil'H- tion. For y.um· i1etoism we have only praise; for yout· deeds we haw only appn:ciation; fo1· yom· deaths we have only grief: but for you, we have ourselves. We too can fight! You have done ~-om· taslc We will do oms- no effort shall be too g-reat. \\'e shall over- come all obstacles to make possible the achievement of that etemal peace fo1· which you died.

Our ultimate 1 victory is certain, but it will be costly. And 1 yet, it is worth the price. ~o expense is too great, no task too laborious if our country, our homes, our entire philosophy of life are at stake.

We nonchalantly passed it off with a \C'est la guerre\. We were just trying to be polite alJout it and let it go at that. It seems that our polite subtlety has had no effect. The w~tter is still very cold.

By way of a hun1ble, yet sincere, tribute to what these nine men accomplishted, and what they sacrificed for us, we'd like to recount their sports history while they were at Union. Paul Santee, '42, won his block \U\ in varsity basketbaH during the 1940-1941 season, won his frosh numerals in bas- ketball, football, and lacrosse in 1939, and was the intramural boxing champion in his weight class all dul'ing his colleg€ career, winning every bout by lm0ckout. He was also awarded an \aUa\ f.o1· his participation in lacrosse in 1941. Stanley Rice, '37, participated in varsity swimming, and intramural .sports. G. Dudley Holmes, '41, was captain of the varsity hockey squad during the season of 1940-41, and was co-captain of the lacmsse team in 1941. Too, he was third baseHmR on the freshman baseball team of 1938, and won block \U's\ three straight years in lacrosse, and three straig-ht years he was awarded ''hUt\ for partidpation in hockey. Hany llouse, class of 1941, participated in track. Jack Pearson '42 woH his block \U\ in varsitv cross- country in 1939, 'and' took his freshman numerals ·in that sport in the previous year. lie also was a member of the Gamet track team. A. E. ''Doc\ l\Iaines, '40, was co-captain of the Union cross-country team in 1940, and in 1939 also he won his letter in that sport. He was awarded an \aUa\ and a block \U\ in track while at Union. John Quinlan, '40, participated in varsity tt·ack and football, and won his munemls in freshman football in 1936. Charles F. Clowe, '41, in his freshman yem·, 1939, won his numerals in both goll' and basketball, and was, awarded an \aUa\ in varsitv lacmsse in 1941 Leo Dwyer, '40, participated i~ freshman football and won his \a Ua\ in varsity football in 1938.

New Testaments and Old Testa- ments are pocket-sized editions, blue in color, and are practically a necessity to every sea-bag. ThP Gidt>ons The Gideons, Intel'national. is an organization of Christian business m.en, banded together for fellow- ship and the pr0m0tion of the Gos- pel of Christ to all races und creeds. They have placed hundreds of tHou- sands of Bibles in hotels, hospitals. penal institutions and public schools. Now they have undertaken the tremendous task of supplyin?: as many service men as possible with sact·ed t•eadings. · M1·. SachPr Spealu•r The speaker was Mr. Sacher of the Boys' Reformat0ry, New York City, who outlined many of the good works that religious readings have done in every far-flung cor- ner of the world. He quoted ex- cerpts from many letters from both Chaplains and laymen noting the benefits derived from the numer- ous Bibles and Testaments that the Gideons have passed out. Endorst>d by FDR As Commander-in-Chief, Presi- dent Franklin D. Roosevelt has commended these copies to every man in the armed forces of the United States. On the flyleaf is a special request of the U. S. Naval and Military authorities to the ef- fect that servicemen should place only their names and nothing more on the flyleaf. On no account should organization, post, ship or station appear al any place in the book. This might afford valuable infor- mation to the enemy. ----01---- Lt. Palmer at Big Conclave in N. Y .C. Trainees Should Be Taught To Take Fatigue in Stride Lt. (j.g.) Palmer, Physical train- ing officer, has recently returned from the Physical Training Confer- ence held in New York City, May 22. This conference was attended by all Physical Training officers of the Third Naval District. The principal speaker of the conference was Com- mander Davis, Commanding Officer of Physical Training division of the Third Naval Dictrict. Commander Davis spoke highly of a more rugged physical fitness program and is a staunch ·believer in con- stant conditioning. Physical train- ing officers attending the confer- ence were told of the need of more exercises that tend to build up the arms and shoulders, as these points were points of weakness as re- corded in the results of the last strength tests. Commander Davis quoted many remarks as made by Commander Tunney iri his 15th months tour of the South Pacifk Among the quotations given, these were the ones that Lt. Palmet' thought the most impressive: \At Tarawara there were more deaths by drowning than by bul- lets.\ \Trainees should be taught to take fatigue in stride and not quit at first sign of tough going.\ \Trainees should be taught how to fall.\ \Remember it is the stragglers who die:• During the conference Lt. Palm- er gained many new ideas that might be applied later here at our unit. New methods of doing cal- isthenics, a better and more rugged obstacle course, more combatant activities, and more gumption among the trainees were the main points of the conference. Lt. Palm- er said that he thinks that our physical training program at Union comes up to specifications. !

B, 1 Andreen t·eported to the V-12 Unit I as ·Commanding Officer. Lieutenant ·Andreen has graciously given the Concot·diensis the facts about his past experiences, both military ami civilian. Educator The new Commanding Officer comes from Minnesota,. \The Land of 10 Thousand Lakes\. After com- pleting his elementat·y and second- ary schooling, he attended Gustavus Adolphus ·College in :.\1innesota where he received his degree. The ski.p)JPt· then took ·post graduate work at :'\orth Dakota Univetsity and the University of :.1-!innesota. Upon completion of the post gradu- ate work. Lt. Andreen became con- nected with the school system of Ada, Minnesota, and later was nampd city s~hool superintendent of New Ulin, Minn., and was also ap- pointPd to the Minnesota Depart- ment of Education as Dit·ector of Federal Projects. During the last seven yea1·s he has been associated with the Laidlaw Brothers of Chi- cago, in the publishing of t;xt books for colleges, high schools and ele- mentary schools. Most of this time he served as their North Central States Manager. Military Career During the last war Lieutenant Andreen enlisted .in the army as a privat0 and by the termination of that conflict was a Second Lieuten- ant. He served overseas in France for thirteen months. On March 8, 1943, Lieutenant Andreen was com- missioned in the United States Naval Reserve and sent to the Of- ficers' Indoctrination School at Co- lumbia University. Upon completion of this training he was assigned as Commanding Officer of the Navy V-12 Unit at St. Mary's College in ~innesota. On February 1, 1944, Lteutenant Andreen was ordered to the Bureau of Naval Personnel in Washington, D. C., as Liaison O.ffi- cet· between the Bureau and V-12 Units. This month he received his orders to report to Union College as Commanding Officer. Family to Residf.' Here Lieutenant Andreen is ex,pecting his wife and three of their five children to arrive in Schenectady about June 15th to take up resi- dence on the College grounds. Lieu- tenant Andreen has a son who is in the Army Air Corps and a daughter who is working for the State De- partment in Washington and so thPy are unable to join the family in ·schenectady. Lt. Andreen's Speec:h Last night Lieutenant Andreen formally met the members of the caulty and the tr·ainees of this Unit in Memorial Chapel. The new Com- manding Officer addressed his re- marks primarily to the trainees. He discussed the physical, men- tal and personal selection of men for the V-12 Program and congrat- ulated the men upon their being selected to become part of the pro- gram. Then the skipper pointed oct the great number of ships that the Navy is building or is contemplat- ing building and declared that the trainees at this station and other V-12 Units are destined to serve as the junim· officers on board these vessels. Clarifies Academic and Physical Qualifications Lieutenant Andreen declared that the normal college program of 24 weeks is now required to be com- pleted satisfactorily by Navy Trai- nees in 16 weeks and so it was up to each and every man to do his part without shirRing any of ·the details. He further stated that Phy- sical Fitness Standards have now been set. It is necessary for a man to achieve a score of 50 after eight weeks in the program and 60 after sixteen weeks. Libet·ty The Trainees were then reminded that the Navy considers liberty as a right to be earned and not some- thing that each man has coming (Continued on Page 4)

The first \Gamet\ unde1· this new plan appeared last Fall. Two ::;eme~ters have passed since then and the new \Gamet al- ready overdue, is nowhere in sig-ht. Quite frequent!~· students ask us as to the whereabouts of the yearbook, anrl we are forced to sh!'ug our shoulders. Certainly, the a'bsence of this ye;w's \Garnet\ seems odd <tnd unexplaim~ble. It cannot be cnused b~· lack of student interest, for eveT~·thing points to the contrary. Even the faculty is favorabl~· inclined towards issuing a \lli-termal\ year- book. A tradition of long standing, such as the \Gamet\ should not under an~· circum- stances be permitted to disintegrate. A year- book is of immense value in increasing out- sirle interest in the College, besides fumish- the students with a concrete !'emindei' of their college days at l'nion. Perhaps the greatest forces maintaining alumni spirit are the yearbooks that the g-raduates took with them when they left their alma mater. ThNe is no better means of l'l'Calling one's college days than glancing through the treasurerl pages of a yea!'book. It \mulrl be very un- just to dl'p!'ive tho::;e of us who expect to leave l'nion in the near future of :such an impo!'tant companion through life as the \Garnet.\ It is true that some of om· fellow :-Jav~· sturlents come fHllll other colleges and still maintain their luyalty LtJ\\anb those colleg·es.
