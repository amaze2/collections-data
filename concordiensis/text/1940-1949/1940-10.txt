Civil Pilot Program To Begin Friday Night The first meeting of the mem- bers of the fall session of the civil pilot training program will take place Friday night, October 4 at 7:30 p. m. in the lecture room of the Physics Laboratory. All who expect to participate in this pro- gram should be present, declared Professor Peter I. Wold, The meeting is for the purpose of starting the ground school and to give explanatory material regard- ing the program as a whole. Union College has been asked to train a maximum of 40 students. Over that amount have already ap- plied said Dr. Wold, but at present it is not known how many may fail to qualify in the physical examin- ations. It is therefore permissible for any who have not yet applied but who are interested in flying to to come to the meeting at which time further information will be available. Of the 60 men who took the. course last year 54, received their pilots license. Five transferred and one has as yet to pass. Last year all students who were receiving financial aid from the college or who were working were not allowed to take the course, However, the present requirements are scholastic only.

But it would be un- fortunate if any of these portentous announcements carried false impli- cations. The .president does not speak for his college; the professor does not speak for his colleagues or his students. Taking time off from its prece- dent breaking efforts to defeat a Democratic presidential nominee, the New Ymk Times took an edi- torial shot at the president of Union College Sunday. To those of the c1ass .of 1940 who who is with us and who is against have \commenced\ and who will not read this, I can but murmur a mental and yet very g·rateful thanks for their grand friendship to a bat baric skirted Scot; to the rest-well here it is, with evez·y- us. \EDITORIAL AND REPORTORIAL 11 \The purpose of a college newspaper can be separated into two distinct phases. First of all it serves to convey to the stu1knts !'ads al.Jout college life, and secondly, it seeks to ex- press the opinions of various groups within the school. The firM aim is l'l'J)Olting, the second, editorial.\ In its efforts to report, The Conco1·diensis is trying and \\'ill contimw to try to l.Je entirely unbiased. To present a pape1· worth reading and one which students, faculty and alumni will wnnt to n•ad is our aim. \\'ith this in mind we attempt to fill our pages with new::; directly concerning union College and its students. Our reporte1·s a1·e Cnion reporters, not intercollegiate Ol' intemational reporters. Thus it is the policy of The Concordiensis to be alert to campus conditions in order to convey to the student body the current details on the major questions. ,..\ modern newspaper, at least in \democratic L'nited State::;\ is often dubl.Jed, \the voice of the people.\ It has l.Jeen said that \a newspape1· reflects the personality of its readers.\ These \facts\ can only be true if \the people\ are willing and abk to express themselves whether they are just plain citizens o1· colleg-e students. Willingness is something entirely dependent upon the individual and ability is taken for granted, at least among college students. To encourage such expression and as an aid to the willing and the able, The Concordiensis ha,s included in its makeup a column en- titled \Letters to the Editm·\. It is through this column that the voice of the people shall l.Je heard and any and all such opinions are entirely welcome. So much for ou1· job as reporters. But we have another job and that is to seek and express the opinions of various groups within the school through our editol\ial column. Let us repeat it is not our intention to consi-stently crusade for this cause o1· that for the sake of crusading, or for the sake of filling allotted editorial space. Nor is it our intention to decide the political question of the nation in this column. With college presidents, faculty members and students hail- ing Willkie and International Relations Club member£, other faculty members and still other students sticking by the third term candidate, we have frequently been asked why The Concordiensis is not out on one limb or another. In this respect we have tried to keep our editorial and reportorial policies synonymous. It is with Union's interests that we are concemed and only in so far as the political campaign is discussed or championed by those among us can it be con- sidered strictly of interest to Union. To those who will vote for the first time this fall we urge as complete a study of the pros and cons of the situation as is possible, but to this quar- ter of Union's enrollment, we plan to offer little advice through editorial campaig-ns. There is involved here a very dPlicate rli~tinction as to ncndemic freedom. College teachers are vot- ing citizens and they are a dis- credit to their profession if they do not study thP politiPal situatiol\ conscientiously and reach a deci- sion as to pa1ty alignment based upon sueh reasoning .power and good sense as God has given them. They should not be subject to any external pressure whatsoever. If their students wish to know how they are voting and why, there is every t·eason why they should an- swer frankly and in detail. But, on the other hand, a college teacher has certain advantages OV£'1' his students and may wield a certain power. He is granted hours of each day in which he may oc- cupy the platform alone prPaching or teaching or uttering ex-cathedra statements and frowning upon con- tradictions or eftorts to argue back. It is unfortunate if he usPs his time in such fashion; but it ts worse than unfortunatP. worse than un- ethical, if he uses this power to proselytize for a political party. So we ·may a·ssert that 'presidents and professors are expected to be indi- vidually partisan, but academicaJly nonpartisan. So far as this individual up·State professor is concerned, he has list- ened eagerly to all of Mr. Willkie's speeches, trying to control his tears when he hears of tbose years of virtuous and disciplined youth, and quite sincerely stir! ed by several coura.geous utterances that set a high standard of political cam- paigning. But each speech brings new sur- prise as he finds Mr. Willkie con- fessin·g himself morl\ and more a partisan of the New Deal, with only two important differences that now seem to exist between himself and his opponent. Fils!, he promises to give more money to the undet- privileged, without spending so much in doing H; and second, .he would bring to the task of adminis- tering a government for all of the people an experience that is limited to the management of a light and power company, while Mr. Roose- velt would bring an experience of many years in public administra- tion. I do not like the idea of a third term, but I think it the least important of all considetations at this moment. It is quite possible that these views are not shared either by my college president or by my col- leagues on the faculty. Burges Johnson Schenectady, N. Y., Sept. 25, 1940 The President of Union College wrote to the Times voicing his dis- appioval cf what that publication described P s \the unpressed press.\ Referring to the recent 200th anni- versary of the Univezsity of Penn- s~·lvania in ·Convention Hall, Phila- delphia, the president of Union Col- lege declared that the appearance of the representatives of the press \formPd a sharp conttast to that of t hP rest o.f the audience.\ \::\fast of them,\ says the Presi- dent of Union College, wore no coats or neclities, ·but gave all an excellent view of their suspenders. One woze a sleeveless yello.w polo shirt; another kept his hat on .. ,\ \Why is this?\ the President of Union College asks the New York Times. Is it because reporters, rightly !mowing that they ate themselves more intelligent than most of those that they report ... acquil·e H sort of contempt for pub- lic ceremLnies as a playground for stuffed ;;hirts? ... Is their excessively sloppy ·appearance where it is most embanassing a professional affec- tation?\ '\To soml' Pxtent it is,\ answezs the anti-third term journal. which is quick to add, however, that \the proper uniform for a newspaper· man is one which is not conspicu- ous in any gathering. It is one which will do at a fire or in a flood and also at a wedding. He cannot go home and change to suit the nature of his assignment.\ The Times agreed with Union College's p1·esident that \a journal- ist covering an addzess of the President of the United States at the 200th anniversary of a famous institution of learning might grace- fully take his hat off,\ but contin- ued with the statement that \there is a kind of honesty and infm.·mal-, ity in American reporting which would be lost if reform went much furthet· than this. The kept press I in some European countries can be counted on to wear pin-striped trousers, a ·cutaway with a gardenia and·a high hat. Somehow the Amer- ican reporter, wbose pants may need pressing, but who is free to write the news as he finds it is a happier spectacle.\ Whatever The Goncordiensis, as a rather juvenile member of news- paper .brothezhood, might add to the comments of the New York Times, would almost necessarily ·be anti-climactic. Suffice it to say that, while The Concordiensis wouldn't dare to permit one of its sta·ff to attend an address by the President of Union College in shirt sleeves, minus a necktie, but with suspenders, The Concordiensis might like to try it some day. How- ever this reporter will continue t0 report the news in gentlemanly attire. ' thing I've got.

Fumbles .................. 4 5 Haverford's aerial attack ac- counted for 79 yards and almost beat Union. The Pennsylvanians made 12 first downs to eight for the Dutchmen, but fumbled five times to nullify several scoring bids. Union showed only flashes of the fine offensive work which brought seven wins and a tie game last year. George Norris hung up several long runs on reverses and Eustice compiled a net gain total of 61 yards. Ball lost fumbles ....... '. 2 5 yards to score in four p'lays, three l of which were passes. MaglH tossed zoni, a Rochesterian who officiates at many maj0r football tussels in the east, has been heard around Rochester stating that five of the Rivermen's opponents this fall will get the shock of their lives when they tangle with the Yellowjackets. He concedes that Amherst and Denison -may be too strong for De- Groot's machine-which leaves Ho- bart, Union, Hamilton, Oberlin and Kenyon to survive the shock. Four plays after Co-captain Jack Guibert kicked off to start the game he· broke through to block a punt by Garry Winslow on the Haverford 39-yard line. Quarter- back Di·ck Balch recovered for Union on the visitors' 20. Unneces- sary roughness penalty against Haverford for piling on Balch at the time of the blocked kick recov- ery advanced the ball to Haver- ford's five-yard line. Eustice need- ed two plays to buck the ball over and Guibert converted from place- ment. Haverford Dominates Union led at the halftime, 7-0, but only fumbles and a poor passing at- tack when -in sight of the promised land kept the Scarlet and Black from scoring. Haverford· pushed the ball into Union territory for the first time about five minutes after the start of the second quar- ter and kept it there until horn sounded at halftime. Twice the vis- itors held the ball inside the Gar- net 25-yard marker only to get jit- tery and throw away their chances with wild passes. A fumble by Co- captain Jack Vannier was recov- ered by Haverford on Union's 15- yard line and it looked as if the men of Ray Randall were about to break through. Jimmy Magill lost three· yards on a try at right end, however, and then three attempted passes were smeared and Magill punted from the Union 23 to En- slice on the nine. Vannier booted the ball out, but Haverford came right back as Magill returned the punt 20 yards to the Union 30. Two line plays netted a first down on the 22 and then the attack petered out as Jack Amussen, sterling freshman reserve halfback, was smeared for a 15-yard loss while trying to pass. Haverford had two downs left, but failed to make the necessary yardage and Union took possession of the ball as the half ended. Davis Scores Second Union duplicated its fast first half start by scoring its second touchdown six plays after the third period opened. Vannier took Tom- my Cochran's kickoff on his own 29 and ran it back 10 yards. En- slice hit center for 11 yards and George Norris made 15 on a reverse to give the Garnet a first down on Haverford's 35. A clipping penalty brought the ball back to midfield. Eustice then bulleted a 20-yard pass to Bob Davis, a fleet-footed junior end, who slipped away from several tacklers and outran another pair in a 30-yard romp to the goal line. Guibert's extra point try failed. Shortly after t:he start of the four.th pel'iod, Union began a 73- yard drive to its third touchdown, making four first downs in six plays as Nooris and Enstice ran wild on reverses, and off tackle plays. With the ball on the Haver- ford 25, Enstice chucked a pass into the big mitts of Diamond Ma- rotta on the 12-yard line, where he was downed unceremoniously. Nor- ris took the ball on a reverse forom Enstice and fought to the five-yard stripe, from which point Eustice drove over in two plays. Guibert mi.ssed the placement for point. After four pa.:;;ses were drop·ped by Union players inside the Haver- ford five-yard line in the fourth quazter, Haverford finally got its attack functioning and went 80 Jackpot an 18-yarder to Amussen for the --~,..._-.,.....,_...._...., ..... .--- touchdown after flipping a 35-yard toss to Bob Miller and a 22-yard heave to Winslow.

Too add to his trou- bles, his squad opens this Saturday against a strong Vermont team, and the following weekend travels to New York for a three-way meet with N.Y.U. and Syracuse. At present Co-Captain Doc Maines has the inside track on the number one spot with Co-Captain Don Collins battling Bernie O'Neil for the second spot. Sal Mauriello and Bob Reed have been doing a bit better than average and are ex- pected to round out the squad. In all, the outlook for the two opening meets is none too bright. Ketz is not at all optimistic about the first two on the sschedule but looks forward to the team hitting its peak around the R.P.I. meet. At present Bill is looking to win the Middlebury and Swarthmore meets and possibly one more in be- tween. The squad is at a definite disadvantage in as much as many of the boys have their practice curtailed by afternoon jobs. \Vith the World Series opener in Cincinnati tomor-row and two .top- notc-h football games in Upper New York State -this Saturday, namely, Syracuse-Northwestern and Cor- neli-Colga:te, we're still trying to decide whether baseball lasts too long or football come~ too early. We don't wish to incite the rabid followers of either pastime and: so no attempt will be -made to settle the question for either side. VV'ith baseball fast fading from the spotlight, with the close of one of the most exciting photo-finishes the American League has seen in some time, we would like to take one last crack at it and pick Bill McKechnie's Reds as the series winners in four out of six. Derrin- ger will be the hero with two wins, Walters and Thompson will pro- vide the other two game margin. Loquacious Louis Newsom will win one for the Tigers and Del Baker will have to dig deep into his bag of second rate slow ballers for the othet'. In all probability, Green- berg, York and Co. should be marked as the winning pitchers in any Tiger victor·y. We still feel the Yankees would give the Red~ the best battle of any of their Amet ican League brethern. * It looks like Dulte Nelson is keeping his promise over at R.P.I., namely, to turn out a pretty fair football machine over at Troy this fall. He started off on the right foot anyway, knocking off Trinity last Saturday, 13-7. And Trinity was conceded one ·of the beEt small teams in New England. And among the rest of our opponents, Hobart lost to Amherst 32-7. Only recently a Boston :=portswriter picked Wes- leyan to win the Little Three title, with Williams second and Amherst third. Up in Vermont, the Cata- mounts eased out a close on over Northeastern, 7-0, while Williams' twenty-three lettermen were aveng- ing last year's defeat ·by Middle- bury, 14-6 When Charlie Caldwell bring,; his gang over fr·om W.illiams- 1 , town this fall, the Dutchmen will be facing practically the same team ' they defeated last season. And don't let anyone kid you, thoEe Williams lads will be out for blood. From all reports Dud DeGroot is doing a swell job up at Roches- ter. Not only has he s-old himself to the Etudent body, but has also gotten the alumni behind him and interested in the team. Something that ham't been done for some years. With ten out of eleven of last year'·s first string on hand along with a flock of other bold- overs, De Groot is'nt bothered by lac!! of quantity anyway.

M. C. A., and Oswald D. Heck, '24, speaker of the New York State assembly, discussed na- trona! mmale from .the point of religion and government. Mr. Hecl1 declared that \\\he peo- ple in a representative democracy such as the United States can achieve a higher caJi.ber of govern- ment official, greater efficiency in government service and a better at- mosphere in publ·ic office ·by mere- ly demanding 'insistently for these things.\ In questioning whether Ameri·can Democracy has grown soft, Mr. Heck offered two suggestions. \Filst the government eliminate the ·p1·actice of granting special fa- vors to specia·l groups. Secondly, an intelligent patriotism should be sponsored on behalf of the govern- ment by means of a carefully plan- ned national program.\ \Mol'ale Dr. Ellenwood pointed out,\ grows out of two things: ·a deep conviction that there is some- thing worthwhile to figh-t fot· and just as deep a conviction that it had better be you and I to do the fighting.\ CALENDAR Tomorrow 10:00 a. m.-Daily A<'sembly, At·- thur E.

Preache~r A.tt.ac:ks Sensual P'leasures Divinity School Dean Calls Present Day Sin Revolt Against Nature \Handwriting on the wall\ has appealed in modet·n days just as it did in ·biblical times, Rev. Charles Reynolds Brown, dean emeritus of the Yale Divinity School, prt'lclaim- ed in the sermon of the second de- votional servi·ce of the new aca- demic year hetd Sunday morning in Memo1 ial Chapel. Drawing his example from the d·ebauchery of the Babylonian king, Balchazar, and how his downfaH was predicted by the mysterious handwl'iting, Rev. Brown pointed out that \thei·r sin was a revolt a:gainst ·nature.\ Such a revolt is evident today, he said, ·in the wide- spread appeatance of sensual enter- tainment and idle waste of time, and fO similar down.f·all i.s imminent.

Scholarship Cup Awards To Be Made Tomorrow The Berg Scholarship Cup, since 1924 annually presented to the fraternity which compiles the highest average during the preceding academic year, will be awarded by Dean Charles F. F. Garis tomorrow morning in Daily assembly. At the same time the Dean will present the Garis Cup, the companion award, given each year to the highest ranking dormitory. Last year the Berg Cup was won by the Kappa Nu Frater- nity which attained a cup aver- age of 4.914 and an interfrater- nity rank of ·plus 45, the fifth time It had succeeded in attain- ing the highest scholastic rating. The Alpha Delta Phi fraternity was runner-up with an average of 3.296. North College held a slight margin over South College in the dormitory competition for the Garis Cup and took the Garis Cup with a 2 882 average. Contacts Bands Fraternities Polled To Decide Orchestra For Gridiron Ball A dance committee for the an- nual Inter fr·aternity Ball has been nameu and atTangements f-or Se- C-Uring an m·cheslla for the dance are now in progress, Kenneth Mac- kenzie, '41, newly elected president of the Interfraternity ·Council, an- nounced last night. 'The committee consists of Albert S. Callan, Jr., '41, Laskat· Schwa1tz, '41, Edmund G. Kelly, '·11, Wesley A. Albright, '42, Richard Brickley, '41 and .:'vlacken- zie. The Council named Callan chairman of the committee. Mackenzie, who is in charge of securing an orchestt·a, also report- ed that ·he was in consta-nt com- munication with George Miller '40, who, as representative of t-he com- mittee in New York City is at pres- ent engaged in negotiating with various bands. Fraternities J>olled Among the orchestras which have been mentioned most prominently for the dance and have proved most in demand judging from the Interfraternity Council's poll of fra- ternity houses, are those of Bob Chester, Bob Zurki, AI Donahue, Jimmy Lunsford and Will Bradley. Of the five, Bradley's band is def- initely out, Mackenzie ·reported, after he was informed by Miller t-hat B1ad!ey was scheduled to open at the Biltmore on the 12th of No- vember. According to the present -plans of the committee the dance will be held on Friday night, November 15th. Mackenzie said, however, tha-t if some real advantage were to be gained by holding the dance on the foliowing nig·ht, such as securing the se1 vices nf a generally desired orchestra which could not other- wise be obtained, the committee might again seek permission fi om Dr. Fox to change the date. This was done in the case of the Jmrior Prom last spring when Glenn Mill- er's orchestra could not be obtain- ed except on a Saturday night. Mackenzie said that \every ef-fort was being made by the committee to secure a No. 1 .band for the dance and to malte the ball the big- gest a-ffair possible at the $3.00 per couple tax.\ At five it was still there. Nu- nwt ous people had dressed a.round it but apparently did not nctice the fortune. It remained for a junior to ask others in the room if they owned it and then to take it upstairs to Bill Ketz':-; office. Fifteen minutes later a :JOphomore claimed the money, desct·ibed it cmrectly and walk- ed off without marveling that he had his $14.85. Radio Workshop Gets Tax Support Student Council Elects Crosby Representative On Pubiications Board The Radio Worltshop was accept- ed as a student tax supported ac- tivity at a meeting of the Student Council Wednesday night in Wash- burn Hall, Dickinson Griffith, Jr., -president of the Council, announcN' yesterday.

Several years ago two members of the Union faculty ran against each other· for a position on the city council. Dr. Waldron was the Democratic nominee and Dr. Earl Commins carried the Charter League hopes.

If the Work- shop fulfills the plans it has outlined fo1· the coming season and continues its prognun as a student organization, for the students, of the students and by the students there can be no objection to its \recognized\ status on the campus. It will be to the advantage of the Radio \Vorkshop for its members to see to it that this organization remains truly active; that it lives up to its new position on the campus and that it con- firms the action of the Student Council in accepting its appli- cation. ~····················••.a - • COLLEGIATE CONTEMPORARIES Frank Taylor ,captain of the VERMONT UNIVERSITY grid squad, had to skip practice the other day because he had a date to get married. * * * * A certain .professor at OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY walked into the classroom 15 minutes 1ate to find the class gone.

The Dutchmen will be trying for their second victory of the year, their twelfth undefeated game in a row, and the eighteenth victory in the series with Hoba1t. and not till the last pal't of the game, when their reset·ve:; ran out were they outplayed. The series with Hobart bega·n back in 1896, and with the excep- tion of a four year brea'ii ar0und the war years 0f 1914, the rivalry was unbroken until 1937 when the Dutchmen un:;et the Deacons and spoiled an otherwise perfect record. From at! reports, \Speed\ Wilson's crew are on the warpath this year and out to· taste Dutchmen blood. The Hobart squad has frankly been gunning for Union since spring practice last year, and would like nothing better than to break the butchmen's undefeated record. Many Injmies At the opening of the season it looked like Hobart had a possible combination to turn the trick. How- ever, after their game at Amherst last Saturday, rumors of injul'ie.;; galore have floated down from ~en .. tral New York State. Four of Ho- bart's stars who figured to trip Union up this year, are in the in- firmary, and will be unable to play Saturday. This brings the Deacon'·\ already. small squad down to two teams. Wilson will have a compet- ent starting lineup, .but only three or four dependable reserves on hand, unless the medical staff can patch up the injured sta1·s so they hold together for the game. How much truth· there is to these re- ports remain to be seen. Possibly it is a psychological hoax on Coach Wilson's part. Clare Popa!isky, one of the best passers in the small college circles, and who completed eighteen out of twenty-eight passes against Am- herst, is on the casulty list, but is expected to start against the Dutch- men. He had his right leg badly twisted as well as smacking his head on the bench during the Am- herst game. Popalisky figures heav- ily in the Hobart plans for the game Saturday. He will probably do the most damage for the Dea- cons with his passes, against 'he weak defense in that department that Union has. He will also be 1n there doing all the kicking for Ho- bart, and if his bullseye passing i·m't enough to demoralize the Union defense, his running will. He is the fastest back on the Ho- bart squad, holding the college's 220 yard record. Expect Aerial Attack Jack Shea, the Deacon's star sophomore triple threat back, is laid up with leg injuries·. He is con- sidered one of the best backs in the western end of the state and might possibly take the spotlight away from Co-Captain Popa!idl>y before the year is over. There is a possibility that Shea will be in the lineup on Saturday, and if he is. the Dutchmen will have their hand' full stopping his running, and Popalieky's brilliant passes. Despite the rumored injuri·es they are suffering, and the defeat they abwrbed at the hands· of the Loi·d Jeffs last Saturday, the Deacons are still looking forwal'd to the game with Union tomot'row with confidence and the feeling that they are going to repay past debts. Ac- cording to Line Coach Ciampa, who scouted the Deacons last Saturdny, the 32-7 defeat they suffered does not do credit to the team. Thl)y were outnumbered and outweighed, In expectation of a blitzkreig through the air, the Dutchmen·~ admittedly weak aerial defense has also received· a .Jot of attention. Nels· has been wm king to check typical Hobart plays such as a fiat paes from the single wing forma- tion. 1-'opalisky frequently takes the ball on a fake reverEe aHd from this position flips the p1g~kin ovet·head to either end. On short passes of thirty yards he is re- puted to be able to hit the Imlian on a penny. In the same line, Hav- erford pa:;·ses. in the last periocl made the Dutchl!len look :;ltghtJy pour, as Magill to:;::ecl four go0d one:; in. a row for the Penn:;y l- vanians on.!y :;core. The var:;ity went through two strenuous :;cl'immage se~s1ons thi~ weeli in preparation for the Ho- bart game. Juniors Enstice, Davis and Killian looked hot in ·both drill~, the latter moving up t0 the iir:ot string in George Norris' place. However, Nord,; v.ill be back on the first string on Saturday. Niitc~l­ man does not like to break uo his first string end combination of Marotta and Guibert, but never- the-less, Bob Davis will see plenty of action at Geneva this weekend. His touchdown pas:; against Havc•·- fmd and his defensive play in :;crimmage mark him as a valuable reserve man to have around. Ken Sharpe, third st!ing quarterbaei~. has been playing brilliant ball all fall and should get plenty of ex- perience before the season io through. He has developed into one of the best blockers on the Equad as well as being a smart signal caller. He is giving Lee Sherman a hot fight for the second string job. Low on Reserves The center of the line, guards Baker and CieinEki and center Saw- yer, have looked pretty fair in scrimmage, but the old tackle prob- lem looks even worse for the Ho- bart game. Doug Slingerland, who looked good against Haverfocd !3 not eligible for away games, leav- ing Nels with only four experi- enced men for thai position, Wein- tlaub, Dor>man, ~fara and Eisner. At that, Eisner and Mara have had very little experience, so Dor:;- man and Weintraub should have a busy afternoon. Nels has· been grooming Goldblatt for \Tiny's\ tackle position, and Stewie will get firet call for a relief job. Nitchman has indicated that he might start th·e same lineup that took the field against Haverford. Co-Captain Vannier, who failed to break loose last Saturday, Norris, Balch and Enstice will be in the backfield. Ed has looked good in pt·actice this week, running w1ld against the second. string and t•Js;;- ing some nice passes to wingbarli NorriE. Nels' ace end combine of Co-Captain Guibert and Dime Ma- rotta will be at the fian·ks of the line. \Tiny\ Weintz·aub and Dutch Dorsman will be in the tackle ·>'ots, while Bobby Baker, Union's de- pendable and outstanding linemen, and Adam Oiesinski, will be at the guard po~ts.

B-0. * * While browsing through the rec- ords picking up the above bit of in.formation, we ran across this one. The first coach and trainer of a Union College football team was William Hyland who held that po- o;ition in 1890 when the DutchmeH won tht· New York State Cham- pionship by defeating Hamilton 26-10, Syracuse 28-0 and Rochester 6-4, among others. The only other coach before Hyland that is. men- tioned in the t•ecords was a stu- dent nam'ed \Father\ Brown, who held that position in 1888. * * Noting t·hat few nwn have been able to enjoy many 'Frt•edom:o Fo1' without sacnfil'ing Bume of theit 'Frl'edonls Ftunt\ Profes;;or La.zra- bee continued \H we a.re to be en- abled to choose ftom a wide vatiPty of possibly attaina bit• goud:o, we know that all of us must pay a price in tt\l'ms of the nece:;sa1·y so- cial restraints upon thosE\ of our lib- erties that conflict with one an- other and the general Wt'lfarP.

Lewis led the first varsity tea·m. Two gameti were played that year, one with Albany Medical College which was won by the neophyte doctorf, 8-0, while the second one with R.P.I. wound up with a di:;puted scm·e. We might mention that our J'ecot ds give us the edge, 4-0. The 1887 season opened with a practice game with Albany Medical College, as the scribe o;aid, to find the strongest men students to bolster the Union varsity. Apparently the needed strength was not found ao; the Dutchmen dropped two games to the Ridgefield A. C., one to Wil- liam:; and scored their only vic- tory over Cornell. But by 1893 Union had entet·ed \big time\ cir- cles, playing Comell, Army, Col- gate, Syracuse, Dartmouth and rlochester. In that year Union lo~t only to Army, but still won the New York State Football Associa- tion pennant. \If we are willing to plan for it we can manage to retain a great UP TO DATE STYLES $5.00 up Styles That Fit PATTON & HALLS 245 State St. Unquestionably Favored!

Penalt;o.· Air Ca:mera 'Plays Large War Role Methods of Mappi~ng Military Objectives Explained by Lowent.hal The place of the camePa in mod- ern warfare was descl'irbed by Ar·· thur Lowenthal '41 speaking in dai'ly assembly on Wednesday morning·. Aet·ial photography and ground work were both described. The camera was first introducert to warfu1·e by this country in the Civil War, the speaker stated and although blurred and poor the pic- tures were the beginning of the part played by the camera, in the hands of the Signal Corps, durin3' the Spanish-American war, the Boxer Rebellion and the World War. The difficulty of taking pho- tographs of the modern battle, he explained a·rises from the difference in tactics used, In the Civil War the photogra.pher had before him men in mass fm·mation while under modem conditions all he may see is an empty de:oert or at best a group of men running through a meadow. Desru•ibes Uses Aerial photography may be placed in two categories, Lowenthal continued. First the photographs may be used by intelligence officers to determine what the enemy is do- ing on hi:> side of the lines and sec- ondly the photographs may be used by the engineers to make new maps of certa.in areas or to supple- ment old ones. The difficulty of taking these photographs was em- phasized by the speaker who stated that it involved considerably more than leaning over the side of a plane and snapping a picture. The two types of cameras used are a single Iense and a multiple lense, thE' latter b~>ing able to take a pho- tograph of 15 square miles of terri- tory from an altitude of 15,000 feet. Lowenthal concluded with a de- scription of the various experiments now bE'ing conducted by the govern- ment along the lines of colored pho- tography and expressed his belief that any emergency would find the army photography sections ready and able to go to work.

Eight Cups Rt>tired Since the Berg Cup was first awarded in the academic year 1914- 1915 there have been eight cups permanently retired by fraternities who have gained the honor three times. In 191\1 the Pyramid Club, whic·h is now the chapter of Theta Delta Chi, retired the first cup by winning it three consecutive times. In 1920 the Delta Phi fraternity wao next to obta·in permanent possession of the cup when it dup- licated the Py1amid Club's feat cf '-\inning the cup three times in succession. The third cup went to Alpha Gamma Phi which group later became the Delta Chi Frat- ernity. In 1925 the yearly system was replaced by the granting of the Berg Cup• for each semester·'s work.

In 1931 the cup award was brought back to the original method of presentation, the yearly basis. F10m that time on the Kappa Nu Fraternity has been able to take permanent pos- session of two more cups by being Berg Cup winners six times in the past seven years. The all-men's average for the last academic year was 2.469. The all neutral average was 2.574 an increase of .125 over the average of the entire college while the all- fratemity average of 2.334 was a .13~· decrease from the average. Dean Garis commented on the fact that this high correlatioil betw-een the averages of the neut- ral and fraternity groups is indeerl a healthy condition. -- ·--o---- Black Sees Defeatism Danger to Democracy Warning that the greatest peril to democracy is defeatism, the R~v. Archibald Black, pastor of the First Congregational Church of Montclair. N. J., told a large congregation at Un:on College's l;;ernorial Chapel Sunday that Judas Iscariot had betrayed Jesus Ch1·ist because he was essentially a defeatist. \Judas could very well speak to the young people of America on defeatism,\ the Rev. Black warned . \Democracy and Christianity can- not stand on their own but need a discipleship that is devoted, loyal, true and even willing to die for their beliefs.\ • Symposium Defense Is trnsts Topic for UNION COLLEGE, SCHENECTADY, N.Y., TUESDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1940 AVERAGES FOR THE BERG CUP FOR YEAR 1939-1940 No. of Fraternity Members 1.

Union. students were told today what a \free press\ is in the sec- ond program .relating observance of \newspaper week\ throughout the country. Dr. Burges Johnson, chair- man of English, former editor of ''Judge\ and author, declared by a \free press\ we mean one \that is not controlled by the state, that is not restrained ae to what it shall or shall not print, by an offi- cial censor .... A press that is free to criticise the government.\ Chairman of the symposium which will attract many prominent men will be President Dixon Ryan Fox. Speakers at the event, sched- uled for 2:30 p. m., will be: Dr·. William H. Cowley of Hamilton, Dr. Henry N. McCracken of Vas- sar and Dr. William 0. Hotchkiss of R. P. I.

P. I. On 'Third Term Issue' In Broadcast Program The P.hilomathean Society will engage in intercolleg·iate de·bates with R.P.I., Wesleyan College and Middlebury College late this month, according to an annourrcement ·by John A. Ruskowski, '41, manager of debate. At a meeting yesterday, the or· ganization's executive committee and Professor Douglas W. Camp- bell, adviser, completed plan:'1 for an intensive pl'eparation program for· these debates. Last night the entire membership met for a half hour forum on the third term is- sue. This forum was proposed to clarify debata·ble points in prepa- ration for the first debate with R.P.I. on the subject of a thil'd ter·m. The debate will be broadcast over WGY as a part of the Em- pire State Town Meeting of the Air series on Sunday, October 20. Debate Wesleyan Wesleyan Co;~ege will furnish the opposition for the second de- bate on ·October 24 concerning \Should the Western Hemisphere Form an Alliance or Union Against Foreign Aggre~sion\? This forensic meet will be the las·t debate ~n w~1ich Wesleyan will use t-he formal style of debat- ing. On conclusion of the debate with Union they will begin prepa- ration to debate in the \Round Table\ style adopted by Union sev- eral seasons ago. Unicn\s debaters will journey to Middlebury for the third debate on November 5 arguing on \The For- eign Policy of the United States.\ Rusl~owski indicated that the Philomathean Society will partici- pate in .at least 15 intercollegiate de:bates this year. The series of forums and Round Table discussions prior to each de- bate will be continued, as it is felt that meetings cf this sort will aid greatly in preparation for each particular debate. In addition to the forum last evening, the meet- ing was divided into a number of Round Table discussions on the subject, \The Fifth Column Dan- ger.\ Lucke Predicts Upset To Win Free Passes Franklin and Marshall reach- ed deep into their bag of tricks on Saturday a:fternoon and scalped the Da•rtmouth Indians in their own •backyard. Not only did they scaJ,p Dartmouth, but at the same time deprived thir- teen Union students of two free du·cats apiece to Proct0r's cinema emporium. However the doughty diplomats from down south fail- ed to fox one Union lad, namely, Bob Lucke, who picked them for the upset, along with nine other correct choices, and to him goes the prize, a·long with the dis- tinction of being the best coin tosser on the campus. One other student, Bob Wor- tendy·ke. piclted F. and M. to beat Dartmouth, but spoiled his chances by picking Hamilton over R. P. I. and Michigan State over Michigan. Thirteen ot-her students picked them all correct with the exception of the Dart- mouth game.

Wold Inaugurates CAA Fall Program Sixty Seek Training; Staff Includes Hall Thatcher and Stanley About 60 prospective flyers, in- cluding 20 Union students, gathered in the Physics lecture room Friday night as the Civil Aeronautics Administration fall training pro- gram was inaugurated under the direction of Dr. Peter I. Wold, coordinatm· of the program. After preliminary addresses by Dr. Wold and George C. Havens, directm· of flight training, the class began ground school sessions under the tutelage of Professor Everett w·. Thatcher and Mr. Robert L. Stanley. Introducing the course to the potential airmen, Dr. Wold point- ed out that the course would include 72 hours of classroom lectures and a minium of 35 flying experience. Tentative plans call for two hour lectures each Monday. Wednesday and Friday evenings beginning at 7:30 p. m. The meeting, joined to the Union Conference on Industry and Gover- nment scheduled for the previous day and Wednesday morning and the Convocation of the University of the State of New York in Albany on the day following. will present a complete consideration of the prob- lem of American National Defense. Delegates to each conference will be welcomed to sessions, lectures and discussions of the others. Presidential Campaign Issues Arouse Ca'/11lpus Debate~· Students Give Reasons For Current Election Choices Presidential campaigns upon the college campusee of the nation very rarely develop the white heat of ccntl·over·sy that is to be found in the :non-academic world. This situation has not, however, prevent- ed the student bodies of seveTal colleges. among them that of Union. from taking a keen ihtereet in the most important of all the functions of a democracy-the chcosing of repreeentatives-or from the for- mation of opinions upon the respective merits of those men who wish to lead the American people. Pwbably the only outward manifestation of this function of personal choice are the buttons which begin to blossom on the lapels of many Union students every fourth September and continue their growth until the first of November.

Sherwood's \Road to Rome\ wiH be the Mountebank's fir\'t fall production, Roger D. Mar- shall, '41, the dramatic organiza- tion's president, announced last nig·ht. The decision to present the play was reached yesterday after- noon at a meeting of the Mounte- banks' Executive Committee, and was the result of the revision of production plans for the year, Mar- shall said. Plans now call for the winter production of Nicolai Go- gol\s \Inspector General,\ as was pr·eviously announced, while the third presentation will .be Clare Booth's \Margin for Error.\ \Road to Rome\ Popular Sherwood's \.Koad to Rome,\ while slightly less known than his two most recent hits, \Abe Lin- coln in Illinois,\ and \There Shall Be No Night,\ the latter still a Broadway success, is none the less popular with theatre-goers. It is the story of Hanrribal's campaign against Rome, in modern dialogue, and with a number of interesting parallels to the present European war. \The Ins·pector General,\ is a typical Russian comedy, while \Margin for Error,\ one of last season's outstanding Broadway smash successes, is a comedy-mel- odrama whic·h concerns a Jewish policeman whcse duty it iE1 to guard the life of a German consul. It was also announced that the first reading of \Road to Rome\ will take place in the Mountc- •banlts' Theater tonight, promptly at 7:30.

The ane:ot of some British citizens in German contrclled Rumania seems to be a deliberate provocative act in.ten- ded to invite British intervention and thus provide an excuse for a new Axis thrust in the Balkans. Lt seems reasonable to believe that the British will soon get some re- spite while the totalitarian powet·s elevate their prestige and consoli- cla·te their gains elsewhere. It has always seemed that bombs alone can merely destroy, not conquer rr nation. The Axis power,; apparently realize that now. - John A.

Democratic government contrasts with rule by dictato1 ial force imposed by strategem and violence. 11. Decisions within a democtacy are made by majorities. Major- ities must, however, maintain self-restraint and show due re- spect for the rights of minorities A minority in turn while accept- ing the protection of the state must abide by majority decisiom until by peaceful persuasion these I decisions may be changed. The higher interest of both majority and minority in the commonweal imposes these reciprocal obli<>a- tions. Thus liberty, order, a 0 nd the opportunity for progress are assured. 12.

The Dutchmen started moving for' the Deacon's goal from the start, driving to the 25-yard line in two minutes. A .fumble mom·entarHy re- tarded the drive, but after Hobart kicked· out of danger, Union drove 52 yards in six plays to score.

Much of Union's success was d.ue to the fact that it stopped Hobart's ace-in-the-hole, Popalisky's pasEing threat. Popalis·ky, who completed 18 of 28 passes against Amherst last week, completed only three tosses. int~ the Union backfield, good for 68 yards. Also contributing a great deal to the Union victory was the ace center combination of Bub Sawyer, Bobby Baker and Adam Ciesinski, who tore large holes in the center of the Hobart line, permitting Eustice to break through for plenty of yardage. Due to these three, Enstice was able to run for a net gain of 129 yards. Ed also tossed three pas·ses, good for 49 yards, bringing his. total yardage gain for the afternoon to 178 yards. Complete 4 Out of 8 Passes Union threw eight passes, com- pleting four for a total of 64 yards. Enstice threw three strikes while Co-Captain Vannier tossed the other to Marotta in the first period. Ho- bart tried 15 passes, ten of which were incomplete and two more were intercepted. The Dutchmen did most of their grcund gaining in the first half, running up 13 of their 16 first downs in the first half and 185 of their net total of 245 yards. Ho- ba! t was held for a total of only 31 ym·ds in the first two periods but stepped out to gaing 141 in the last two periods. The Deacons totaled 11 first downs in the whole game. The performance of the Dutch- men was vastly improved over the Haverford game. The blocking and ta~ltling was better and the effects of a week of drilling on pass de- fense were much in evidence. How- ever, the downfield blocking s.tiJ.l needs a bit of polishing in prep- aration for the Middlebury game.

Included among them are some old English sea chants, a group of negro spirit- uals and a few French songs, one of which will be performed in French. A list of regularly scheduled glee club performances is being made up by Kelly at the present time. Tentative concerts are listed for New York City, several cities in New Jersey, Plattsburgh, Bingham- ton, Buffalo, Great Barrington, Green Mountain Junior College in Poultney, Vt., Saratoga Springs and Albany. A combined concert will be held with the Skidmore Col- lege glee club in Memorial Chapel, as will the regular Schenectady Alumni Association concert at the Mohawk Country Club. Sponsors Concert Huge Roosevelt Banner Unveiled During Chapel A huge banner :bearing Presi- dt>nt Roosevelt's portrait and carrying the legend \Carry on With Roosevelt\ caused a fren- zied demonstration for the Pt esi- dent when it was dropped dur- ing the reading of the morning notices in yesterday's chapel. The banner was attached to the upper sash and slithcJ·cd OJ.>en when Paul Schrudt, \43 pulled a string attached to the picture. A wave of clapping followed ty a few boos and then another wave of laughter and clapping swept the aosembly. The cause of the demonst1·atiun was. un- known to Dr. Fox. who waited ... ntil it wa,; over before continu- ing with the intmmmal tmck announcements. \I'm always glad to see si;;ns of stud,ent in- tet·est in politics,\ Dr. !•'ox said. Credit for the stunt must go to Bemard T. Duquette, '42, Vice-President of the DPmocra- tic Club. who put up the banner. Schrudt, who pulled the string ftom the end scat of the choit·.

Mr. I Ha1 ri:;on will anive on the campus on Sunday and will hold the dec- iding casting tryouts that same eve ninE,, at \i :30 p. m., in the Mou!1- teban1w Theatre. The Executive Committe of the Mounte·bank::> have asked all men interested in trying out for parts to examine copies of the play, which may be had in the college llbrat;,. 11om the reserve shelf, Mr. Rust said. Since there are some twenty male parts in \The Road to R0me,\ there are more than the usual ca,;ting opportunity for both experienced and inexperienced ac- tors. Although a large group was present for the first reading of the play, casting wa::> not settled at that time and all parts are still open to all comers. Directed Stars 1 The Mountebanks fell particu- larly fortunate in securing Mr. Hanison's consent to direct their first play because he offers them an expel'ience, a reputation and skill in directing which place him high in the ranks of the theatrical pro- fession, the faculty advisor said. Mr. Hal'l'illon was Henry Miller',; director for many years. Later he directed many farce comedies for A. H. Woods including \Ladies Night,'\' Parlor, Bedroom and Bath,\ I \'Up in Mable's Room\' and a host of others. His greatest success, howevet, was his direction of \The Great Divide,\' the William Vaug- han Moody play which Henry Mil- ler revived in 1917. In recent years, Mr. Harrison has directed several plays in New York, including \Swing Your Lady\ and \Around the Coi·net·.\ Among the stars whom Mr. Hat rison has directed are Alice Brad}, Ina Claire, Claudette Col- bert, Arthur Byron, Mary Boland, Margaret Lawrence, Lowell' Sher- man, Marie Tempest. Florence Moore, Margaret Anglin, Lucile Watson and Maurice Chevalier. During the past summer season, he has enjoyed great success as the director of all the Mohawk Drama B'estival plays, Mr. Rust said. The new director will return to New York City as soon as the casting is completed. He will return to the campus for the final two weeks of 1 ehearsal.

The other kind is an unintelligent form of destruction worthy only of a paid hoodlum. The latter form of campaigning started with a literal smearing activity on the campus last night. The car of a stu- dent. active in the affairs of .a political party was liberally smeared with red paint while the owner was engaging in legi- mate political activities. This destructive policy can hardly be expected to have beneficial results for any guilty part~·. but as in the case of Willkie versus Detroit eggs will produce only sympath;-.· for the injured part~·. The acts of an irresponsible few can not be construed as the will of the majority of the party. As long as L'nion men take as much interest in political affairs as they are evincing at the present, democracy need have no fear of continuance, but den1ocrac~· was never served by a hoodlum with a bucket of red paint. To the 223 students who are of voting age we offer but one pt·ecept to follow. Keep It Clean! NON-PARTISONSHIP Democrats and Republicans get together so seldom in these piping days of bibulous Beta's that it is with relief that the Concordiensis has published in this issue a fine example of non-partisanship, the founding of a joint scholarship by Re- publican Oswald Heck and Democrat Irving Steingut. The choice of the field of government as the basis -of the award is significant for in the words of the assem- blymen \Now of all times, is the crucial period when the best minds should be occupied in upholding the rights and liberties guaranteed under om· fo1·m of democratic govern- ment.\ the highest scholastic standing. port a family of five when hi~ At the close of the last academic father died, he gave up a prcfes- year, it was found rha.t Staley and sional career in music and turned Goodman were tied for first place. to banking. Music, howeve1, is still hence the prize will be divided be- his greatest happiness and he aids tween them. his wife in her brilliant career. Not since the Spring of 1939 when it blasted the mud of the Alexander Field into the faces of the visiting Graduate Ccuncil, has The Concordiensis devoted as much of its ecitorial to the statement of one opinion as it did in Tuesday's issue. A distinguished .group of undergraduates has appended sig- natures to H letter decrying Union's apathy toward the currently mom- entous affairs of the world, and setting forth a correc.tive pt·ogram in six neat steps. For no other 1eason than the editorial space monopoly which the reformers have exterted it is our duty to consider their proposals with care. Because of its presentation it is difficult to avoid some initial pre- judice against the thing . .Surely the plan's drafters, Mr. Schwartz and Mr. Feigenbaum, would have acted in a bit better taste had they waited fm· someone other than themselves to administer the editorial pat-on- the-back. However the point is a minor one; we must strive for objectivity. The student apathy to which the gentlemen in question refer, and the advisability of its correction. have been agreed· upon to the point of triteness. But now -comes along a positive 'project' to clear up the situation, and here we must part company with the reformers. The Open Sesame of American life is the magical word '01·ganize!' T.hat done, all good things follow. Once this country has organized all the Catskill Junction Ladies Auxiliar- ies for the Protection of Night- crawlers in the Village Green it can imagine, it sits back self- satisfied-and more cluttered u.p. The Sshwartz-Feigenbaum plan is a case in .point. Artificially stimulated lecture- attendence and officially promoted bull sessions, more enforced phy- sical training added to our present burdensome program, and another of those mystic entitles, executive committees, acting as the fountain- head of a new campus-wide organ- ization, are not going to save Britain Dt' America or win the war fm· Union. This is the same senti- ment which ·pins 'God BlessAmerica' on the back of our cars and calls national defense complete. We can only win the hard way - by a spontaneous regeneration of inter- est and enthusiam stemming from the individual, and not pumped into him. As for a British benefit proram, it would get our heartiest support, ·but it has no more place in an official college-wide organization than a Willkie Club. Point 2, that 'we logically al.ter' our courses, in effect, to streamline our Truth into patriotic usefulness, is the most dangerously anti-liberal sentiment raised at Union for some months. Mr. Schwartz and Mr. Feigenbaum had better go down to Mr. Murray Butler's college. • \S b;c\\lli U\l t\le GAR Strong J Dutc:hme Vermont 'EI• To Claw Ur Its n·cord twelve CJll te>ts ball team tmv Ve1·mont, tom01. of capturing i v:in of the 19·10 bui y, although Iiams ami Tuf ~eas0n, bo~ts eleven that ca.: the Dutchmen t :J function.

Secretary Tells of Own World War Days At Industrial Meeting Exhorting Union unde-rgraduates to look on conscription as a great democ1 a tic opportunity, W. W. . Trench, secretary of the General ·Electric Com,pany, this morning recalled his own rise from \gob\ to per EDna! aide to Admiral T. P. Mag.ruder in the World War as a direct result of his previous educa- tional training. A great deal depend:; on the at- titude taken by the young man who is suddenly ohoved into military service, ::>aid Mr. Trench in the opening address of the Conference on Industry and Government, but there will be a use for \everything you have ever done in your life ... and everything you ever learned\ in college ::ll' elsewhere. Mr. Trench volunteered for the Navy with 25 years of education. Utilizing his education to help his .;upel'iors and studying navigation in \off-watches ' he was promoted to the office of ensign. Following Mr. Trench's address, conferees gathered in Old Chapel for a forum on \What Principles Should Govern Our Vocational Training Program?\ Chairman was Professor Mortimer F. Sayre, gen- eral chairman of the conference, who introduced the speakers. Lewis A. Wilson, associate commisEioner of education for the State of New York, and Roy C.

The Republican presidential candidate stopped off to sp,ealt for a half hour ~esterday mm•ning while enroute to New York City. An outspol!;en. supporter of Mr. Willkie, President Fox was asked by a member of the local Democratic Omrunittee whether or not he would greet Mr. Roosevelt tmdet• similar circumstances. Said Union's president quietly: \I will be happy to greet the presidential candidate of any other party who chances to visit Schenectady.\ Assistant War Secretary Outlines Colleges' Part In Defense System Alumnus Tells Industrial Conference That Schools Will Be Used to Train Supervisory Personnel for Government Declaring that the \precision gage is mightiel' than the sword\ the Hon. Robert P. Patterson, '12, assist:::n1t secretary of war, told delegates to the Union College Conference on In- dustry and Government that it is not the purpose of the War Department in 1940 to \substitute the camp for the campus\ but will employ the facilities of the colleges\ with a minimum of readjustment\ to train badly needed \~upervh>ory person- nel\ in the vast defense program of industrial mobilization. Pastore Named Victor In Football Contest Two tokens, entitling one Ar- thur Pastore, of the class of '44, to two seats in Proctors movie palace anywhere back of the orchestra pit, will be given scot free to ·said Mr. Pastore upon presenting adequate identifica- tion to The Concordiensis. The reason for the unqua:Iified gen- erosity being that Pastore blanketed the field in the sec- ond volume of the Second An~ nual Concordensis Football Con- test. Pastore wound up with a score of nine out of ten, falling victim to the unforeseen Pitt- Southern Methodist tie, as' did the other fifty odd entrants. Ma.<>on Kronick, '42, finished in ~econd place with eight out of ten, missing on the Pitt~South­ ern tie and the Upsala-Albright classic. Eight contestants tied for third place with seven out of ten. Mauriello, '42, and Good- man, '43, were tied for last place picking three winners. Mauriello entered a second ballot and had better luck with this, spotting seven winners. However, the judges disqualified this on grounds of attempted fraud and extortion. Mauriello not only had the nerve to enter the contest on two tickets, but reached a low level of infamy, along with one, Bob Newton, '42, in picking Middle- bury to defeat Union! Ignomini- OUS\! Radio Workshop To Discuss Plans Group·s First Programs Broadcast Last Week; Extra Shows Arranged The Union College Radio Work- shop will have a record turnout for its organizational meeting to- morrow night at 7 o'clock in Sil- liman Hall, it was predicted last night by the group's executive com- mittee. John Sheehan, '25, director of the Workshop and program di- rector of the General Electric Round - the - World Broadcasting System, John Gilmore, '27, program director of General Electric's tele- vision broadcasting, and Bernard Krause, '39, General Electric Fre- quency Modulation announcer, will be present to discuss plans for the coming year with new and old members. The successful completion of the Workshop's first two programs un- dertaken for this year was also an- nounced at the same time. The en- tire organ concert given by Joseph Bonnet in Memorial Chapel Friday night was broadcast over Station:; WGEA and WGEO. Continuity prepared by William Massee of the Radio Workshop was translated into Portuguese and used for the broadcast, which was \beamed\ on South America. The last fifteen minutes of the theramin concert given Sunday afternoon by Lucie Bigelow Rosen in conjunction with Dr. Elmer A. Tidmarsh's regular organ recital was carried by Sta- tion WGY, using continuity pre- pared by Robert Schulberg, of the Workshop executive committee. Tomorrow night's organizational meeting is expected to result in plans for more regula.r programs l in addition to the two weekly pres- entations already arranged. Speaking at the luncheon meeting today, Judge Patterson said that \today ideas no less than rifles and tanks and. airplanes are among the a1·maments of the nation\ and that the alliance in our past history be- tween higher education and higher strategy \ha::> not been ::>o remote as the nninitiated may suppose.\ Quoting a report of the At·my Industrial College, tl::.e speaker stated that \ene of our basic indus- trial re:>ources is the accumulated store of technical knowledge. To our school::> and colleges belongs in lar·ge measUle the credit for the preservation, propagation, and aug- mentation of this great national asset.\ \The War Department,\ he con- tinued, is fully aware of the essen- tial share that is borne by the col- leges and universities in further- ing the cause of national defense and the fact that the essentiality of that share is inc1·easing in geom- etric ratio in a militarized world.\ Outlining the government plans for coordination with the colleges and universities, Judge Patterson emphasized the fact that they \have no intention of taking over the operation of the country's educa- tional system. There will be no Students Army Training Corps, an institution familiar ... by asscocia- tion or reputation . . . (which) took over the management of many of our college:; in 1917 and 1918, con- vr~rting them into cantonments and disorganizing the undergraduate b.Jdy as students without effect- ively organizing them as soldiers.\ Praising the work of the Reserve Officers Training Corps, he cited the parrelled need of supervisory personnel, \chiefly engineers, civil and aeronautic, and inspectors. To fill these vacancies speedily re- quires not only specialized, but in- tensive, training. Here the facili- ties and faculties of the colleges can be employed to superb advan- tage.\ Elaborating the plan, the assist- taut secretary of war said, \we shall send personnel, both military and civilian, into the colleges and technical schools for additional training, and we shall so distribute these mPn as to create a minimum of disturbance in the operation of the normal curriculum. They will be absorbed into the regular classes or, less commonly, grouped in spe- cial classes.\ A program worked out by the Un- ited States Commissioner of Educa- tion now pending before congress, he said \includes 32 courses in wide- ly diversified subjects with intens- ive periods of instruction of from four to twelve month duration.\ These trained technicians, Judge Patterson remarked, \will command an army of skilled craftsmen who have been undergoing technical training in the country's vocational schools. Already 15,000 of these stu- dents have ben placd in industries essential to defense.\ He pointed out that the nine member committee established by representative:; of 49 educational groups meeting in Wa~hington In August to discuss ways and means of mobilizing the nation's educa- tional resources is designed to \re- present the educational interests of the country in determining the type and scope of national defense pol- icies.\ Although it has no federal recognition, it can be \safely char- acterized\ as the most representa- tive body capable of speaking ex- pertly and authoritatively for or- ganized education, he said, addi11g that the Assistant Secretary of War is taking fullest advantage of this facility, for \WR!et·loo was won not alone on the playing fields but in the classrooms of Eton,\ ·,

Ailyone who disagrees with him is little better than a criminal, if not actually one. He will take no advice. He wiH not study his problems, he settles them off hand as the impulse drives him-often one solution one day and a different one the next. He will co-operate with nobody, and wm settle everything himself. Any means which he employs, however unscrupulous, are moral, because, he employs them and he can do no wrong. Now Mr. Roosevelt has all these marks of the reformer. I will not take space to go over them. They are all well known, and could easily be illustrated by amusing or irri- tating examples. The important points at this elec- tion are that he cannot bear to have strong men near him, and that he cannot bear to deputize authority to others. Reformers are almost regularly like that. The list of capable men who have bePn quite unable to work with Mr. Roosevelt is well-lmown. It is long and honorable. His cabinet is the worst in mod- ern times. There is not one good man on it. Democrats ax·e fond of Hull does, shine in that motley. crowd. But Hull would not shine in a really good cabinet. He would not be on it. Mr. Roosevelt has alw a privati' cabinet. And who are on it? Are they the responsible men of the party? On the contrary, they are all unknown men, inexperienced men, irresponsible men. They are there because they know the Pres- ident like a book. They flatter him with his greatness, and feed him with fresh suggestions of reforms -attacks on business, on the sen- ators, on the Supreme Court. Mean- while ·the leaders of the Senate and the House wait the messianic or- ders. Laws are dt·afted behind closed doors and sent out with the statement-\No amendments are to be permitted on this law.\ Congress has generally submitted. Party discipline and the allotment of funds have generally talren care of that. The United States can perfectly well stand that sort of government fat· a while. It is wasteful and ex- pensive-twenty odd billions in se- ven years-but against that the re- former can take credit for his re- forms. There is no use complain- ing. The reforms and the twenty billions of debt are there, and it is, in general, vain to expect efficient government from reformers. Jane Addams after many years' experi- ence with reform in Chicago said that she had never known a re- former who was also a good ex- ecutive. Mr. Roosevelt only fol- lows the rule. The point I would make is this. Phi Sigma Kappa announce::; the initiation of Thomas, Lewis Par- sons '12. Richard Frederick Hoff- man '43. and Hobert Landis ShejJ- herd ·~3 If we are on the edge of a difficult international crisis-i.i we are per- haps on the edge of war-we need at Washington not a reformer with a crowd of tenth rate men adoring him, and nobody having any dele- gated power. We need a great number of the best men of the country-chosen for ability and not for adoration of the god-and each with his own delegated power and responsibility, and all working to- gether with a mutual give and take.

Pinli Gardner, County C'lerk, will address the group We shall never have such a state of things under Mr. Roosevelt. His behavior already shows his nature.

He cannot be a dictator without Congress, and we have seen that he cannot dktate our choice of congressmen. There is no Jaw against a third term, because when the C<!lnstitu- tion wa~ drawn the idea was dis- cussed and discat ded. Washington himself said that the question would take care of itself, and Ha:m- Hton in \The Federalist\ opposed such a limitation. Only Jefferson fa v01 ed it.

Roosevelt came into office after an orgy of spending under the dic- tatorship of business. Bankers had mismanaged banks, railroad owners mismanaged railr0ads and Wall St!'eet men mismanaged Wall Street. The crash carne, and a frightened govemment and people forced unprecedented power and unprecedented ,funds into the hands of one man and cried, \for God's sake do something!\ Perhaps a man wiser in ,business and govern- mental experience would have been more timid about tackling the job. But he said, quite Himplr. \We shall doubtless mal{e many mis- takes.\ Undoubtedly he did. But he did something; and confidence 1 e- turned. Then the Eame old leader- ship of business said \Now evety- thing is starting off again nicely, and you'd better let us talte over the helm.\ party has yet to lower Itself to the Outing Club Shows Movies extent of defacing college property, In the event you wish to sig- nify a tie, check both teams.

Eighty percent of wealth in the hands of ten percent of the pe0- ple, in a democracy! Government continued to exet·cise its mandate and the fight began. So many of the loudest accusations against Roosevelt have been made by men who were noisy about something that really did not bother them much. They wanted to be rid of him by any means, and those azound him in the government. We heard much about \packing the Supreme Court\; but ten years be- fore, a committf.'e of the American Bar Association advocated almost exactly the same limitations upon that court. We heard of the \purge\ as the act of a would-be dictator; but every presidential candidate up for reelection has tried to influence the congressional elections so that I he might have a supporting major- ity in Congress. Roosevelt has done many things that I do not like; but he has done many more that I do like; and they are things that will make this a better democracy to live in. Mr. Willkie believes that, and so do I, Mr. Willkie is not voting for him, and I am. Or perhaps both of us are voting for him; it's a secret ballot.

Would not the fourth as.sistant secretary of War do everything that Mr. and Mrs. Roosevelt could do at Water- vliet? He might even do it better, since presumably he would know something about it. Meanwhile, business is neglected and awaiting Mr. Roosevelt's personal decisions at Washington because Mr. and Mrs. Roosevelt have to look at Watervliet personally. A newspa- per article a few days ago reported that in the last three months Mr. Roosevelt has been absent from Washington most of the time-on tour.

Vermont Backfield Stars Vermont has switched coaches since Union pulled a 19 to 6 upset to hand the Green Mountain boys their first beating of the season a: Burlington last year. Coach \F•Jzzy' Adams has· installed a new grid ~ystem and has three capable elevens which he can throw at the Dutchmen in an effort to rack 1.1.p the first Catamount triumph ove~· Union since 1935, He'll start :t pair of the best backs the Garnet eleven will run into all season in Frankie Taylor and Johnny Spasyk, both of whom will seek to make up for lost time against the Garnet defense, which held the pair to practically no gain in last fall's game. Have Two Losses Two losses already mar the rec- ord of what promised to be the best team Vermont has had in a decade, but they were both by nar- row margins and with a bit :11ore luck Coach Adams' team might still be in the ranks of the un- beaten. After nosing out North- eastern, 7-0, in their opener, the Cats dropped an 8-3 heartbre.J.ker to Trinity, the team which con- tributed a 7-7 tie to an otherwise perfect Union record last year. Last Saturday a powerful Colby eleven which had already blanked C.C.N.Y. 14-0, eked out a 10-7 triumph, as the Cats muffed two opportunities to score from 'the one-yard line late .in the game. Union will trot out a revamped attack against the Vermonters. Ex- cept for a few passes and an oc- casional end around or reverse, the Dutchmen stuck to straight foot- ball in beating .Haverford, Hob~rt and Middlebury, but Coach Nitch- man has added a new series of plays to the repertoire of his charges for tomorrow's contest and has alEO intimated that Vermont is in for a big aerial blitzkrieg. Last year the team did a little c·x· (Ce>ntinued on Page 3) ments for the fray. The program F h c I for the day will include a cane rush res man ass and a tug-of-war, Ketz said. He added that it would be up to the Student Council to decide whether or not the freshmen, if victorious, will win the privilege of wa·lki.ng on the college lawns, which was gained by last year's class. The victories in last year's con- tests were equally divided between the two ciasses, with the freshmen winning the cane rush to earn the grass-walking privilege, and the sophomores retaliating with a vic- tory in the tug-of-war. After last year's cane rush the class of 1942 attempted to avenge the freshmen's victory with a bar- rage of tomatoes. The ensuing bat- tle ended when an innocent by- stander had been made the victim of a wild pitch, and the freshmen were treated to a muddy bath in the college brook when the sopho- mores overpowered them in the tug- of-war. After the tug-of-war, the two classes joined in a noisy rally near the president's house, the sing- ing of the alma mater around the Idol, and a snal~e dance through the streets of Schenectady. Wyatt Announces Plans For Union-Skidmore Party The class of '44 will be hosts to the first delegation of Skidmore freshmen tomorrow. Mr. Frederic A, Wyatt, who acts as faculty ad- visor, released a program for the party which included the Union- Vermont football game, dinner in Hale House and a dance in Hanna Hall. The Assistant Secretary wrote to all freshmen invited, asking them to inform him if they could not attend. The girls will be met at the President's House at 1:30 and transportation will be provided for the couples to the game. DeWeese, Mackenzie, Judd Grey Win Other Offices in Election John Lee Clowe of Schenectady, was elected president of the Fresh- man Claes at a claes· election held after Daily Assembly Wednesday, it was announced by Dickinson E. Griffith, '41, president of the stu- dent body. Douglas Scott DeWeese, also of Schenectady, was elected vice-president, Richard Fuller Mac- kenzie, of Greenwich, N. Y., was selected as secretary, and Judd Dayton Grey, of Corinth, named treasurer. Clowe, who is pledged to the Delta Upsilon fraternity, was grad- uated from Nott Terrace High School last June. He was a mem- ber of the varsity basketball squad and the student council and was president of his class for three years. He is a nephew of Dr. G. Marcellus Clowe, '11, college phy- sician. DeWeese is a graduate of Mont Pleasant High School and is pledged to the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. At Mont Pleasant he was president of the student coun- cil, a member of the varsity track and cross-country squads, and ac- tive in high school dramatics. Mackenzie is a holder of an open scholarship and is a neutral. He is a graduate of Greenwich High School, where he was president of hie class, president of the student body, and active in basketball, base- ball and tennis. Grey was graduated from Corinth High School and is· a Kappa Alpha pledge. At Corinth he was active in the band, orchestra, chorus, dra- matics and the high school news- paper.

Zook, of Washing- ton, D. C., president of the Ameri- can Council of Education; Dr. Lewis A. Wilson, Associate Commis- sioner of the New York State De- partment of Education in charge of Vocational and Extension Train- ing; Dr. Milton E. Loomis, Associ- ate Commissioner in charge of higher education; President Henry Noble MacCracken of Vassar, rep- resenting women's colleges; Presi- dent William H. Cowley of Hamil- ton, representing men's colleges and President William 0. Hotchkiss of R. P. I., all outlined what col- leges Cl;m do to further co-operative defense efforts. College Services President J. Laurence Meader, head of the college association and of Russell Sage, urged \a program of national defense in our day and age that is a comp1•ehensive, wide ranging and total.\ He outlined as main objectives the building up of our at•my and navy, the strengthen- ing of national morale and the can- vassing and inventory of \the po- tential contributions and coordinate activities of all occupational groups.\ Asserting that \colleges must not permit themselves to become ha- vens of those few individuals who wish to escape a basic duty .to their country\ Dr. George F. Zook ad- vised them to heed the wish of the President and Congress to the ut- most. \The training they acre un- dergoing to become a necessary man in any industry, busines.s, em- ployment, agricultural pursuit, gov- ernment service is necessary to the maintenance of national health, safety and interest,\ he said. Dr. Zook suggested the deferment of service on the ground that stu- dents are already preparing them- selves for a national service. They may enlist at the end of their col- lege ca1·eer. Under the law, a col- lege student may request defer- ment. The speaker pointed out that while colleges and universities will not be turned into the chaotic Stu- dent Army Training Corps camps as in the World WaT, they will nevertheless \be much occupied with military matters during the current academic year.\ The whole arrangement, he believed, was su- perior to the situation which exist- ed prior to and during our partici- pation in the last war. If carefully administered it will enable the higher institutions to render serv- ice of fundamental importance to the successful practice of democ. racy in all Of its phases. Classrooms and Special Laboratory Exhibits; Include Union-Vermont Game ~n Day•s Program Union College will hold its first fall \Open House\ for sen- iors in neighboring high .schools tomorrow, it was announced by Frederic A. Wyatt, Assistant to the Secretary. Over 200 seniors are expected to take advantage of the college's invita- tion to visit classes, Daily Assembly, and the Union-Vermont football game. Luncheon will be served for the guests at Hale House. Chest Campaign To Begin Tuesday Hutchins Has Hope Of Netting $550 During 3-Day Drive The College Campus Chest Drive, originally scheduled to start laE't Tuesday, will get under way Tuesday, October 22, Emlen T. Hutchins, '42, announced yester- day. Conflicting dates on the col- lege's program of activities caused the week's delay, Hutchins explain- ed. According to present plans, the drive, which will embrace every student at Union, will continue for three days, during which, it is hoped, about $550 will be pledged toward the support of charitable or- ganizations. The entire student committee which Hutchins will direct will meet on Monday evening, the night of the drive's inauguration, at Dr. and Mrs. Dixon Ryan Fox's home at 7:45 at which time final organi- zational steps are to be taken. Be- sides the committee, which in- cludes repreeentatives of every fra- ternity and neutral group in the college, the Rev. Herbert H. Hough- ton, college chaplain, Dr. William W. Bennett, Co-ordinator of Stu- dent Activities, and Dr. Fox will ·be present at the meeting. Tuegday morning's Daily Assem- bly program will be presented in behalf of the Campus Chest by the Harmonica Band of the Schenec- tady Boys' Club, which is one of the many organizations to be help- ed by the funds subscribed by the Campus Chest. During the following three days, every student in the college will be asked to pledge a certain amount to the Chest, and will be given the opportunity to pay it all at that time, or in a series of payments throughout the year. Faculty mem- bers will not be included in the drive, Hutchins said, which was set up by the Student Council last spring as a means of doing away with the continuous stream of char- ity requests which have hereto- fore deluged the campus through- out the year, Distri'bution of the funds collected by the drive will be in the hands of the Student Tax committee, which will determine those organizations to receive al- lotments. Twenty-five high schools have accepted the college's invitation, Mr. Wyatt said. The guests will be in vi ted to inspect special lab- oratory exhibit programs in the fields of biology, chemisti·y, civil and electrical engineering, ge- ology, physics, and psychology. Mr. Wyatt said that this is the first time the college has spon- sored an \Open House\ of this ldnd in the fall, although high school seniors have often been in- vited to inspect the campus in pre- vious years. The program for the day is as follows: 8:00 a. m. to 9:50 a. m.-Visits to classrooms. 10:00 a. m.-Daily Assembly in Me- morial Chapel, Freshman Sing. 12:30 p. m.-Luncheon in College dining hall.

And they are not alone: four other Americans and one Briton similarly threatened have dug in their toes. strapped on guns, and called the Jap bluff. ._.Why arc the invaders of China trying to drive l). S. ne\~men out of the country? Because these resolute Americans. controlling vi- tal new~ outlets from the unique and unmanageable citv-statc of Shanghai, stand square in the road of ·Japanese conquest. For Japan must control the mind and morale of its subject peoples. must direct world-thinking the Jap.mese way, if it is ever to realiLe the dream of a '\Greater East Asia\- domination of China. India. the Indo-Chinese pe- ninsula. and all the Ea~t Indies including the Philippines. !P Now that Japan and her allies in Europe have fornnl.Jy threatened war on the U. S .. if any resist- ance is mad~ to such ai!grcssive plans. it is time for the American news rc:!dtr to ~tudy as never before the dispatche~ ol hi> cuur.<gc.;u; corre~p.mdcnts in the Far East. Our typical attitude toward China since the Jap invasion has been the usual fncndly American sym- pathy for the underdog. But now our interest in China goes much further than this. Now the top dog is snarling at us, and every intelligent news- reader knows what a tight spot we shall be in if the underdog relaxes his grip. ..,.. Most Americans are glad to find that our inter- ests coincide with those of the Chinese people. We have grown to like them. their peaceful and philo- sophic way of looking at life. their tenacity and courage in misfortune. the beautiful things they make, and the humorous things they say. Perhaps we don't realize that the Chinese. in their turn. have grown to like us. They are grateful for the medical knowledge that has routed some of their worst diseases. for the industrial technics that have helped them put up such a good fight. Many of them are grateful for the Christian religion. They remember how we backed up their dream of build- ing a new, strong China. And they are glad to get the things we have to sell. Contrary to popular opinion, they like the Standard Oil Co. which brings them the blessings of kerosene ..• and they find a thousand uses for the cans it comes in. ..,.. Brilliant Chinese leaders by the score owe their education to American universities. A chief official of the Chinese information ministry, Hollington K. Tong, is a graduate of the journalism schools of the Universities of Missouri and Columbia. Our schools of journalism have had more effect, proportion- ately, on Chinese newspapers than on our own. The old notion that \You can't understand the In these days of crisis, the free press is more than ever a vital force in making our democracy a living, working success. Therefore, TIME is seek· ing, in this series of advertisements, to give all Oriental mind\ is being dispelled by able writers and journalists of both races. Lin Yutang and Mme. Chiang Kai-shek show us China from the inside- ) ohn Gunther and Carl Crow from the outside. J. B. Powell continues to give us his important journal of opinion. the China \'V'eekly Review, though he is on Wang's blacklist and has to have a bodyguard. And just as important as the books and maga- zines are the day-by-day cables ... from men like A. T. Steele of the Chicago Daily News, the N. Y. Times' Hallet Abend, and Tillman Durdin, and TIME's own T. H. White, who came via Harvard and the Chinese information ministry, and is now on the hot spot in Indo-China. ~Sometimes readers ask why TIME devotes so much space to the Orient. It is because TIME has always believed that the day would come when an under- standing of that area with its billion people, half the population of the earth, might be of the utmost importance to America. How the good will of these people can be chan- nelled and become a force in world strategy is a profound challenge. But on such intangibles world history has turned and tyrannies have fallen. ..,..

The first full rehearsal of the produc- tion will be held Sunday night when Director Bertram Harrison returns to the campus from New York. Mr. Harrison will <:pend the remaining two weeks before the play on the campus, directing daily rehean:als. In an effort to find the maxi- mum strength for the play, Fac- ulty Advisor Gordon A. Rust and the Mountebanks executive com- mittee have been alternating vari- ous candidates in several positions during the past few evening ses- sicnf in the Hnna Hall theater. Last night it appeared that Ralph Tiebout, '43, who will play the part of Hannibal, is the only definite flxt ure in the cast. Enough candi· dates are now trying out, but the extraordinary size of the cast makes it necessary to devote more time to .the priliminary casting op- erations than is usually the case. ~=!~t~~~ ~~e t~~h~\s~~~~=· ~a:s!~~ ticipate in infoi·mal discussion with. begi:mln.g No-:ernbet· 1, two s~u- Harrison C.

Dr. Hu, who received his honorary appoint- ment at the Commencement exer- cises last June, will be entertained during his vi.sit ·by Dr. and Mrs. George H.

Following this appearance in Mem- mial Chapel, Dr. Hu will lecture before Dr. Philip Stanley's class in philosophy at 11:20. Dr. Stanley has indicated that Dr. Hu will be given free rein in •choosing the topic of his lecture, and has expressed the belief that the speaker will welcome the chance such as this to dwell upon his \first love\ namely, the philosophy of his people. Honorary Chancellor Student Council Discusses Status Of Uniform Keys Marotta '41, Elected to Executive Committee; Chest Is Discussed Diamond J. Marotta, '41, of Scotia, was elected to the Execu- tive Committee of the Student Council by the class representa- tive~-at-large at the October meet- ing of the Council Wedne~day night. He replaces Roy Webster, '42, who resigned from the Council. Nominations for three new mem- bers we1·e placed before the Coun- cil, which, according to Dickinson E. Griffith, '41, President, will ar- range for their election after a Daily Assembly program in the near future. Two of the new mem- bers will replace Webste1· and Rob- ert Shepherd, '43, who also has· r·e- signed from the Council, and the third will replace Robert Baker, '42, whose status on the Council was changed from that of frater- nity representative to that of a class president. Webster· and Shep- herd were elected a:~ neutrals and resigned upon pledging fraterni- ties.

The safety of supporting Unhm against R. P. I. while re- siding in Troy is a truly deba- table point, but PhiHJl S. Dorion '89, now p1•esident of Union's Graduate Council, makes no · bones about the fact that he is for Union, through and through. \I have my ·money on Union, you can bet,\ he wrote on a postcard received yesterday by Professor D. Richard Weeks. \R. P. I. is shaking in its boots with stage fright\. Mr. Dorion, a Union supporter of long stand- . ing, claims to have ·been a rooter · at every athletic event in which Union has partici.pated at Troy in many years. This latest evi- dence of his ardent support bears out his allegiance to the Garnet in no uncertain terms.

Dr. Hu Shih is considered by many the foremost Chinese poet and philosopher of his time. lt is believed that except for General- issimo Chiang J;Cai-Shek and hi~ wife, Dr. Hu is the most widely known man in China today. Before he turned his efforts in the direc-- tion of diplomatic service for his country, Dr. Hu is credited with having brought about the literary revolution in China whereby the present day Chinese language has replaced classic Chinese as the ac- cepted form of literary expression. ----0--- Six to Attend Meeting Of Physical Society Three faculty members and three students will leave the campus to- morrow to attend the semi-annual meeting of the New York State branch of the American Physical Society, which was founded three years ago at Union, it was announc- ed yesterday by Dr. Peter I.

Other students and faculty men may be added to the party before tomorrow, Dr. Wold said, Bertram Harrison To Return Sunday Director to Remain On Campus 3 Weeks; Final Cast Complete Bertram Harrison, Broadway di- rector who will lead the production of \The Road to Rome\ by the col- lege Mountebanks, will arrive on the campus on Sunday to take over the rehearsals of the play, it was announced yesterday by Mr. G.:>rdon A. Rust, faculty adviser of the group. Mr. Harrison will have just three weeks to complete prep- arations for the opening night of the ·production on November 15. Casting for the p1·oduction haE been virtually completed, Mr. Rust said. Several changes within the ·personnel of the cast have been made this week, he said, and all but two of the parts have now been finally cast. Miss Lea Einstein. of Albany, has been added to the cast to take the role of Meta, Mr. Rust said. Miss Einstein was a member of the Mo- hawk Drama Festival troupe on the Union campus this summer, win- ning one of the four paying jun- ior memberships awarded for next year. George Fawcett, '42, is the only other new member of the cast. He will take the role of the cor- poral. Compl!'ting Work on Sets Miss Adelle Fortin, and Stanley Green, '43, are other members of the cast who were members of the Mohawk Drama Festival. The first complete run-through in preparation for Mr. Harrison's ar- rival will be held in the Mounte- banks Theatre on the college ground::; tonight, Mr. Ru~t said. Work on the two set:; for the play is drawing to a close this week, Mr. Rust said. Both of the sets were de::;igned by college students, he said, and are entirely original fo1· this production. The first, the in- terior ·of a Roman house, is now complete, and the second, Hanni- bal's headquarters, is nearly so. One of the Mountebanks' ma.jor innovations this year is the design and construction of costumes on the campus, Mr. Rust said. John T. Boyt, '42, is taking charge of this work, preparing a number of the more important costumes. The lighting equipment of the Mountebanks Theatre is being thoroughly revised, expanded and ('C'ontinue·d on Page 4) activities by last year's Council.

Tickets for the dance wilL be placed on sale immediately, and may be secured from members of the Interfraternity Council. Every effort is being made to reduce the price of tickets for the cross coun- try team and football team, in whose honor the Gridiron Ball is being run, but this will depend entirely on the result of the ticket sales. Jack Teagarden and his Orches- tra have played at many of the country's leading spots, including the New York World's Fair, Black- hawk Restaurant, Chicago; Mea- dowbrook Country Club, Cedar Grove; Southland Night Club and the Raymer Ballroom, Boston; Roosevelt Hotel, Jacksonville; Steel Pier, Atlantic City. The dance will be one of the main features of the Hamilton Weekend. This third Gridiron Ball will open a week of football and dancing, with the Hamilton foot- ball game on Saturday afternoon and many dances scheduled for Saturday evening.

Such a method, rega1·dless of what the , intended result, automatically classifies the conb·ibution as i being more or less obligatory. It defeats the purpose of char- I ity itself. Filing an individual's card for the four years of 1 his college career and presenting it to him each ;year makes such action similar to that of tuition payments. Is it impor- tant to know that Tom Jones contributed a half a dollar whereas Dick Smith contributed three dollars? And further- more, must a card be filed showing that someone else failed to contribute at all? CAU~NDAR Tomorrow 10:00 a. m. --Daily Assembly.

However, we would urge that future committees consider the ob.i ections to the present plan and attempt to devise a more favorable one. Could not such a plan as provided by the Student Coun- cil be put into operation along the same lines as the individual campaigns of last year without including the obligation ele- ment of pledge cards? We feel that such a system would be far more favorably accepted by Union students and in the long run produce better results. 3:15 p. m. Empire Stat<?

The anathema of any coaching staff, injuries and sickness, finally caught up with the Dutchmen and \blietzkrieged\ them in no small manner .between last Satmday at 2 p. m. and the time we are going to press. Ed Enstice has been the only first string back- field man to put in any heavy prac- tice this week, as Co-Captain and tailback Jack Vannier went to bed with the grippe, quarterback Dick Balch suffered ;;t badly brolten nose in Tuesday's practice and wingback George Norris is nursing a bad knee from the Vermont game. Nitchman has been non-commital as to his starting backfield and will probably be undecided up to game time tomorrow. As it looks now Lee Sherman will very likely play sixty minutes at quarterback, \Boss\ Kil- lian will be in for Norris at wing- back and Ed EnsUce at fullback. It is doubtful if Vannier will 'be able to gain back enough strength to play, and if he doesn't Sherry Hillick will be in tailback at the opening whistle. Mara to Start New Defense Measures Coach Nitchman has been forced to give his injury Iiddled squad, as he terms it, \the lightest workouts I ever gave a team in midseason.\ Live blocking and tackling practice has been cast aside for fear of fur- ther injuries, in favor of workouts in hitting the sled.

LXIV., No. 12 Sale Of Tickets For Gridiron 'Ball Begins Thursday :Price Charg;ed Footba'll Men Depends on Sum Of Next Week's Sale Tickets for the annual Gridiron Ball on November 16 wHl be put on sale Thursday, it was announced last night by Albert S. Callan Jr., '41, general chairman of the d;mce. There will :be a meeting of the In- ter-Fraternity CouncH, sponsors of the dance, in the Student Activities office on Thursday at which time all tickets for the dance will be disttibuted, Callan said. The regu- lar fraternity t·epretienlatives on the council will act as salesmen for the . 1 dance. Whethet· any reduction in the price ·of tickets will be made for members of the football team will depend entirely on the volume of the early sale of tickets, Callan said. If it ,becomes evident in the first week after tickets have been put on sale that the income from the dance is going to be sufficient without the support of the mem- :bers of the football squad, Callan said, they will probably .be admit- ted free of charge. Otherwise they will have to be assessed the usual fee. Angell Named Rf.>presentative The three-dollar price will pre- vail until two days before the dance, Callan pointed out, when the· price will be raised to four dollars. Cecil E. Ange11, president of the Senior Class, has ·been named one of the three neutral ticket repre- sentatives. Two others will be ap- pointed this week, Callan said. Cal- lan suggested ,that any neutrals in- terested in having a neutral booth at the dance should get in touch with Angell, who has been asked to take charge of discovering the possibilities of including a non- fraternity booth. In carrying out the pre·viously an- nounced decoration theme for the dance, \A Satute to the Americas,\ the committee plans to hang a large American flag at either end ot' the Alumni Gymnasuim. Both ;:;ides of the floor will be lined with the flags of 28 South American na- tions>. The tickets and dance pro- grams will also be prepared along the same theme Caiian said. Both will probably' lie printed in red, white and blue ink. The bandstand, likewise, will ·be decorated in the patriotic mood of the dance. • Heck trnsts Addresses Willkie Club 'f UNION COLLEGE, SCHENECTADY, N.

Ruslwwski, Union Graduate The speakers concurred in the be- lief that women can never enjoy true equality before law un, Jess they first acquire social equal- ity. Mrs. Ros.s, however, did not believe that women should be man's equal, unless some arrangement could be made which would -guar- antee her the advantages she now enjoys under special labor legisla- tion which allow<> for her physical limitations. Mr. Ruskowski, a grad- uate of Union College in the class of 1937 with Phi Beta Kappa hon- ors, was of the opinion that women should .be placed on an equal basis (Continued on Page 4) 1 Mountebanks Head Describes Hurly-Burly of Theatre;!

Unlike the run-of-the-mill honorary chancellor who is about as academic as a pro- duction line, Dr. Hu Shih proved himself a real curricular asset to a Saturday meeting of Prof. Stanley's introductory philosophy class and the combined session of the Coffin Comparative, and the Wainger Am- erican literature courses which he joined yesterday morning.

It may be safely said that he considers the attempts of current philosophy to explain itself as 'the Science of sci- ences' or 'that which starts where science must leave off', as \face- saving\-that (in the words of Dr. Stanley) \It's the business of a philosopher to work himself out of a job.\ It was the honorary chancellor's discussion of the Chinese Novel as \ ... the best lecture I've heard Club Friday night in Silliman Hall.

President Fox to Speak At Educators' Conclave President Dixon Ryan Fox has been selected to address more than 800 educators including deans of universities and colleges, heads of private schools and public ad- ministrators who are expected to attend the ninth annual educational conference at the Hotel Biltmore in New York City on Thursday and Friday, October 31 and November 1. The topic selected by Dr. Fox is \The Independent College and School-Their Necessity.\ The event is spomored by the Educational Records Bureau, the committee on measm·ement and guidance of the American Council of education and the commission on the relation of school and col- lege of the Progressive Education Association. The conference which will ·he addressed by the leading educators in the country will have defense as concerned with education as Its topic. In a poll conducted by the Philo-~-------­ mathean society on October 22 it was found that the Re.publican candidate for President, Wendell L. Willkie led the Democratic can- didate, President Franklin D. Roosevelt by 126 votes. It is In- teresting to note the change in the opinion of the student body in comparison to the poll conducted by the Concordiensis in October of 1936. At that time Republican Alfred Mossman Landon defeated the ulti- mate victor, Mr. Roosevelt by 44 votes out of the 586 votes cast by the faculty and students. The head- line of that time considered this to ·be an amazingly small margin. The campaigning by students, however, had a more unusual note than is displayed at the present. The ma.n who received the third largest vote was oddly enough Ma- jor Amoa Hoople of the well-known comic stri·p syndicate. The dark while were busy spreading the gosple amongst members of other colleges. At State College for Teachers a new candidate was added to the rostrum w.hen Judge Puffle, an- other of Ahern's characters ac- cepted the nomination for vice president. In comparison to the modern theme song of the Demo- cratic party the \F.D.R. Way, ' sung to the· tune of \Franklin D.

Pa:ge Two THE CONCORDIENSIS, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 29, 1940 Library Criticism Answered by Webb '-----0-· ·_u _r ___ D_a_v_] On Thursday last VirginiR Gayda, that Italian spokesman so well known to us now, made a state- ment which may mean a great dea:l Ol' nothing. He said: \The two na- tions of the axis are not impatient to ·end the war soon.\ Anyone· who has been .following the events of the past few months will andoubt- edly choose the first possibility and attach a great deal of signifcance to the sttaement. It is important to note that Gayda took Gccasion to ma.ke this declaration on•ly one day before the historic meeting at Brenner pass; and· even the most uninformed o·bserver lmows that the axis partners are, despite Gay- da's assertions, anxious to bring the war to a speedy and success- ful close. That has always been the desire of every nation at war, not even the Fascists' great reputation for honesty can blind us to that fact. We are forced to the conclu- sitm that either pr·ogress in the British campaign is not what it should be, or that the axis part- ners have other ambitions some- what easier to realize.

The ar- rest of some British citizens in German-controlled Rumania seems to be a deliberate provocative act intended to invite British interven- tion and thus provide an excuse for a new ax:is thrust in the Balkans. It seems reasonable to believe that the British will soon get some respite while the totalitarian pow- ers elevate their prestige and <:on- solidate their gains elsewhere.

Furthermore, he wouldn't have been exaggerating if he had said that there were only 100 Union College students in the huge crowd of 8,000 .
