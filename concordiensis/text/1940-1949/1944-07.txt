We are p1 oud of out· Unit and its officers and we hope that you will all enjoy y!!lur stc.y here. The Commanding Officer, Lt. F. B. Andreen, has said that he hope~· that each trainee fully t·eal- 1 izes what is expected of him so that men who are in trainin~ for, active, efficient and dangerous service will be able to co-operate to the fullest of their ability. He also stated that this will make for a happier and bette1 ship. 1st Hitcht-rs Prt-dominant The C. 0.

If these new men tL rn out as well as thoE>e who have pre- ceded them both the Navy and the College should be well pleased. Of the sailors here now, both those from the fleet and those who have been no closer to the ocean than Coney Island, the majority have done well and have liked their sur- roundings here. We hope that the members of the new group will like it as well. It may not be as tough physically as many other tasks in the Navy but we can assure rou that it requires a great amount of work, both mental and physical. Evening and week end liberty must be ea1ned by meeting academical. physical and military standards. It is easy to get along if the r1.1le~ are rigidly adhered to. In the duration of yot r stay here. we wish you all the luck in the world and hope that you remain with us for a long time to come. ---·-0---- What Frosh Should Understand of Life ----0>---- Wour.ded in the terrific fighting on the Italian peninsula recently have bren Dave Mandeville '45 and U·CRS Presents!

We certainly could not have as vigorous a college life without it. The Navy's hope, as well as that of the College administration, is re- alized when Y-12 men and civilians work together in use- ful college activities, after the strictly a cad em i c require- ments are met. During the past year we have learned how to live together comfort- ably and constructively, how- evet· different may be our backg1·ounds and our immedi- ate objectives, and the Con- cordiensis has been a valued medium of om· self-instruc- tion and certainly a means of general enjoyment on the campus. It is a good paper. Cordially yours, Dixon Ryan Fox. It is worthy of note that of the ·eighty-two civilian frosh, thirty have won scholarships. This is an aclimable percentage and helps to account for the high scholarship standings of our fellow students. As was stated by Prexy last week, the new stt:dents are a good cross section of the neighboring states_ There are 12 representatives from New Jersey, 2 from Connecticut, only one from Massachusetts and the rest are from New York state. Of these. seventeen are from Sche- nectady. In the entering class there are thirty-five engineering hope- fuls, twenty-two pre-medics, nine chemists and fifteen academic stu- dents. Many Legacies Union's alumni have shown their love for the Alma Mater by sending their sons here. This includes Peter King, son of Marvin King '18; Wil- liam H. Meyer, son of Dr. Meyer '28; John Moon, son of the late John L- Moon, '06; Fred Pratt, son of Dr. Pratt '22; Carlton Smith, Jr., son of Carlton Smith, '16; Stewart Stephens, son of Dr. Homer Steph- ens '17; John Randerson, son of John Randerson '12; Edward A. Schaupp, son of the late Harry A. Schaupp '09 and John T. Wallace, son of John M. Wallace '14. There are six incoming freshmen who have, or have had, brothers that were Union men. These are David Fisher whose brother is Ed- gar Fisher; Victor Mattson's broth- er Guy; Richard Palter, Burt's brother; James Welch's brother Harold; Robert Davis, who has a brother Walt here in the V-12 Unit and last but not least Dave Cohen's brother Qeorge who has given his name to a canine friend of ours. There are also three grandson·s and nine cousins of Union alumni.

The new semester has IJeg-un and with it a brand new, g-reen freshman class has en- tered Union. An even larg-er number of new Navv studPnts has also come. The entire student body joins thP facHHy in welcoming- \'OU Fresh men of the class of '-!8 and new .Nm;v students to our cherished Alina :\later. You. civilians came in g-reate1· nui.niJer than had been anticipated-an object of much anxiety to the scattered remains of the Sophomore class. You are ready to start 111 vour colleo-e work and all of us wish you the • <:> best of luck in it. All of vou m·e coming- into an almmmal and unus.ual, perhaps also unexpected, at- mosphere. The Colleg-e wears its wartime mantel. Approximate!~· five-hund1·ed ~avy students have replaced those many students who left for the armed services. An acce- lewted schedule of three terms in a year with a week':.'\ vacation between them has IJeen substituted fo1· the normal two tetms and the long and happy vacations, which even to the few old-timet's are thing·s now onlv v<wuelv remembered. As is to IJe ex- pec.ted ~ s~1ch a situation, the social side of college life has decreased immensel~·-an unfortunate but unavoidable result of the war. This IS perhaps the most outstanding-, the most deplorable, a.nd the most unavoid- able characteristic of our wartime colleg-e life. Anothe1· significant feature of present col- lege life broug-ht on b~· the wm· is the con- tinuous turnover in both civilians and -:\' avy students. Navy students are transferred fre- quently and some civilians are leaving almost every day to serve L;ncle Sam. In spite of these unusual circumstance,;, there is still enough social life at l'nion to make it enjoyable to everyone. Strife be- tween the Freshmen and the Sophomores, although incomparaiJle m extent to normal days, still persists. The Idol still receives its customa1·y paintings, and the Freshman hats will soon make their appearance. Yes, the principal traditions of former da~·s are still maintained. The entire student body is work- ing hard to preserve these relics of the past. That is why we are particularly ~dad to see such a relatively large class entering, for we know that the more students there are, the more firmly will the spirit of colleg·e life be maintained. The entire student IJody is eager to help you to become acquainted with the campus and the other students. \\' e all will do om· utmost m helping you to make your college life a life that will never be forgotten. The limitations due to the war exist, of course, but with your cooperation much enjo~·ment can still be derived. Our welcome also extends to the new- come1·s in the :'\av~·. of whom a few me fur- mer L'nion students. After a few semesters they ma~· be sent away again. Yet, they too will enjoy llnion, its campus, its students, and its life. They too can derive many bene- fits beside those of studies from the days lhe~· spend here. The opportunity is gi\·en-- the~· need only g-rasp it. .-\ll of you newcome1 s are fortunate fo1· coming at a time when the canrpus is in its full natural splendor, when the evening are warm, and softball and tennis are the order of the day. This is indeed a gTeat change from the drean· Winter outlook that pre- sented itself to those who entered last i\o- vemiJel and :\larch. Even the campus is hanging out its welcome sign fo1· ~·ou. Eve1·ything· is just beckoning you, Fresh- man of the class -of '18 and new :\l'avy stu- dents, to enjoy your life at Cnion. Union is an oid college. You'll find its history highly inte1 esting. It's long list of traditions shows the gTeatness of its past. You will take pride in ~·our cullege. ~lany world-famous men a1·e alumni of Union. Fo1· a college of its size, Cnion has pl'O'bably the highest rating as fat· as s uccessiul g-mduntes me concemed. The old, ivy-covered buildings will help to implimt in you the spirit of Cnion.

All of us are welcoming you to enter out· society. \\'e wish you success in your studies, :-·our social activities and ath- letics, and with your friends. \\'hen the war is \\'Oil and you are still at l\nion you will see the revival of the real Union College- the college that it has been for a century and a half. And then, with the .i oint support of all, the College \Viii reaffirm its gTeat place among the famous institutions of learning. 'vVe hope you will like Cnion as much a.s we do, and we hope that it will mean as much to you as it does to us. And above all, keep in mind that college life does not only consist of studies - activities m·e also a necessary part of it. Thus, we welcome you to Union. DANCE?? All of us, including the newcomers, are looking forward to a successful social season now that the new term has gotten under way. Because of heavy schedules and par- ticularly because of lack of initiative, our social life has in the past two semesters fallen into the background. Perhaps now that a new class of spirited Freshmen has entet·ed we may again be able to bring social life at l:nion to a more prominent position. A dance in the near future would IJe an excellent way of g-etting started. It would give the newcomers an oppol'tunit,v to be- come acquainted with college dances and help them to adjust themselves to college life. A dance is one of the few activities that have not been materiallr affected by the war. So, let's have a dance soon. ·BUY THAT EXTRA WAR BOND NOW! 8 nd brought a sacrificial lamb to c Company Silliman Hall.

After spending a. few blissful years prepping for high school. \Foxey\ finally saw the day when he entered Cooley High School in Detroit. Here Bob found time to compete on the school's swimming team for two seasons, participating in both the breast- stroke and distance events. Too, during his high-school days he engaged in two of his favorite activities, softball and hockey. In softball Bob played in one of the numerous Motor City leagues for two seasons and in hockey played wing on a club in the Detroit- Windsor League. After this, Foxey decided to continue his education and chose Union College in 1942. Since entering Garnetville in the fall of 1942, Bob has been a very busy person in regards to athletics. In his first year he sat in several times at the tailback slot of Art Lawt·ence's successful Garnet club of 1942, although he was but a freshman. The winter of 1942-1943 found Foxey as a breast-stroker on the swimming team. As the Dutch- men did not field a horsehide club in the spring of 1943 Bob had to be content to pass a quiet spring- time. This past season, however, saw him back in the limelight serving as a catcher and outfielder on Coach AI Ciampa's Bat Brigade. Incidentally, he swatted a lust .333 for the season. Foxey now licks his chops and looks forward to the fast-approaching football season, when he hopes to get back in ac- tion again.

Recently he was credited with the sinking of two troop laden Jap barges by strafing off Rabaul's coast. For the past few months, Lieut. La Roche has participated in approximately 50 combat mis- ~ions, principally against Rabaul on New Britain and Kavieng on New Ireland. When not on patrol assignments, Lt. La Roche and his fighter squadron fly cover for Ma- rine bombers, \Rabaul and Kavieng used to be a fighter pilot's nightmare,\ said Lt. La Roche. \It wasn't so long ago that the Japs would throw hun- dreds of attacking planes against us. Continuous bombing and straf- ing- attacks have left these flying fields wrecked. Rabaul and Kavieng and their surrounding areas are deeply cratered from thousands of bombs. Although fairlr accurate anti-aircraft fire is still encount- ered, not a single Jap plane opposes these attacks.\ Art La Roche, originally from Binghamton, was a Psi U. at Union and was also in the Glee Club. He was F1·eshman baseball manager and swam on the V~>rsity swim team. He left Union in Feb- ruary of 1942 after preliminary C.A.A. training to enter Naval Avia.. lion, winning his wings as a Mal'ine tighter pilot in July of 1943. News also comes in that Bob Bishop, an ex-Unionite has been commis•sioned as a Second Lieu~ tenant in the Army Air Forces and that Marine Pvt. Edward L. Harris has completed his Marine V-12 re- quirements at the University of Rochester. He has been assigned to Pan·is Island, S. C., for recruit tmining preliminary to officer train- ing. Marine Captain Sherman Parry has recently returned from 22 months overseas duty and has been attached to a Special Weapons group at Camp Lajeune, N. C. Capt. Parry, serving with the First Marine Division, was a platoon leader on an anti-aircraft section (Continued on Page 4)

Dtlring the course of theil' h1 last week's issue of the \Concordy\ fl proposa:l for a danr:e in the near futm·e was made. The sugg·estion. was so well received b~' the student body that we decided to issue anoU1er, more specific call. Through past ex- periences we have noted that only through the most persistent efforts can the present stagnation of the .students in relation to im- pl·ovements in the campus or social fundions be pierced. Thus we shall continue in our crusade for dances at l'nion. With the coming of the football season, a formal dance, to be held the evening after a g·ame, would be very appropriate. Such a dance could be arranged for the middle of ~eptember. A later date might interfere with examinations. These gridiron balls are an old tradition at Union-in fact on eYery campus. The time is most favorable for a formal dance then, since neither the excessive warmth of Summer, nor the icy cold and slush of Wintet· would be present. A committee of some kind should be form- ed immediately to Inake the necessary m- rangements fo1· such a dance. Perhaps an organization :such as the Stuctent Council or the Interfraternity Council could sponsor it. :\lost of the many newcomers to the campus have never been to a college l'ormal. ·This would offer them an excellent opportunity to acquaint themselves with these much-talked- about affairs. Others in our midst expect to be transfel'I'ed soon or to leave the Colleg:: t'o1· othel' reasons. Thus, this may be their last oppor:unity to attend a coHege formal. If the plan:; for the dance are formulated soon, there wili be more time for us to pre- pme ourselevs for it. t.Iany former dances d ic! not succeed as well as had been expected because o£ inadequate publicity and too short advance notice. In addition to a formal dance in the middle of September, we should have a few informa.l ones-perhaps one each month-th 1·oughout the term. This would be highly instrumental in reawakening- om· decadent social life. Such a dance would be vel,\· popular with the stu- dents and lmge numbers would attend. · Let's get o1·ganized for these dances. Col- lege life is practical!~· worthless without ade- quate social activities. 'Ne cannot expect any benefits if we refuse to work for them.

The Spirit of Union is the force that binds the alumni together in their allegiance to the College. Without it, thent would not be any class reunions or alumni dinners. The Spirit of Union is the spi.rit of all of us. It can mold personalities into dif- ferent forms, it can chang-e an entire person, and it directly govel'l1s the course of our be- loved College. Union without its Spirit is not 'Cnion. If [ts Spirit should vanish, Union would be un·- able to remain the citadel of education that it is.

I am Sincerely. A. Nonymous Lt. 1 j.g.l Errington arrived at the L'nion College V-12 Unit Tues- day lo take up her duties here, yes, we said \het· duties\. Miss Erring- ton is a full-fledged Navy Nurse with fifteen months overseas duty. Trt>ated !'earl HaJ,bor CasPs Miss Enington hails from Sacra- mento. and other parts of Califor- nln. She was with the first group of nurses to be taken into the Nurse Corps after Pearl Harbor. Prior to joining the Navy, blonde- haired Miss Errington was trained and served at Highland. Hospital in Oakland, California. After en- listing she was stationed at Mare Is!and in 'Frisco Bay where she helped treat burn cases brought in from the Pearl Harbor catas- trophe. Before she left Mare Island she taught at the Corps school there for seven months. With a group of fifty-five other Navy Nurses she was sent out for over- seas duty. They were the first nur;;es to experience foreign serv- ice of the many that have since been sent overseas. Convoyed Ove.rseas They were split up in the convoy going over, a few girls to each \'hip so that if one were sunk, not all would be lost. There was only one sub scare and a few plane scares but they all turned out to be harmless. Lt. Errington's bluish-grey eyes gleamed when she told about the greeting they got when they ar- rived in Noumea, New Caledonia. The only girls that the men had seen since they'd left the States were a few Army nurses who were living in tents, the1·e on the island. When fifty-six Navy Nurses in spotless whites arrived and march- ed down the main street they were literally swamped. It was one of the high spots in their trip over- seas. B. T. 0, in N. Z. From Noumea the girls journey- ed on until finally Miss Errington wound up in a Marine Corps hos- pital in Wellington, N. Z. There she was in charge of the operating room where she served for fifteen months. While there she treated many veterans of Guadalcanal and other major Pacific drives. Now most of the men whom she worked with have moved on to other is- lands in the push towards Tokio. Liltes Union Returning to the States, Lt. Err- ington was stationed at St. Alban's Hospital in New York City for a short tour of duty. She received her orders to report here about a week ago and showed up here last Tuesday. In her short stay here so far she has been very favorably impressed with her co-workers and with the layout here at Union. Miss Errington expressed her pleasure at being assigned to a V-12 Unit because she has worked with boys and young men much of her life and enjoys being among them. Miss Errington admitted that \one of her specialties\ was sur- gery and that she was very happy to be working under such a fine surgeon as Commander Case. Cute Blond~> Lt. Errington is a short, trim blonde with a very engaging smile. She can be recognized very easily, she is the only Navy nurse on the station for one thing, for another, with the exception of Betty, she is the only pretty girl on the campus in uniform, and we do mean pretty. So far she has been quite busy assisting the Commander in diag- nosing and treating numerous wounds and ailments in Sick Bay. This is a new reason for going to Sick Bay now men, besides light duty slips, Betty, and actual sick- ness . , . of course there are those that just go up every noon out of force of habit or improper mental set or some other silly reason •.

The opin- Ion adYanced ,,·as that, inasmuch as no work was being done and the scaffold definitely did not contribute to the beauty of the cam- pus, it should be removed as soon as possible. At that time particulat· emphasis was laid to the fact that it was nem· commencement time and that, therefore, pains should be taken to remove all unnecessary blemishes and to dress the College in its Sunday suit. Fol' a short time it appearect as if the edi- torial ha.d been overlooked, but at the beg-in· ning of the new semester, it became evident that the repnirs would be completed. \York- men appeared on the scene, a new and larger scaffold was ei\ected and 111 no time at alL· the sound of hammers filled the air. The entire student IJody is happy to see that the wo1·k is being· compieted and that Lhe delay, suspected to be due to Heglig-ence, was due to difficulties caused by the weather and the wm·. Om· complete confidence in the efficiency on this campus has heen restated. In fact, we are full of praise for the magnifi- cent work that has been done in keeping the appearance of the campus up to its peace· time standard. With the numerable compli- cations that have arisen on account of the war, no one would have been surprised if the standm·d had been lowered. However, this is not the case. The campus is kept up as well as at any time, in spite of the labor and ma· terial shortages that the College must un- douiJtedly encounter. Jackson's Garden is as delightful as ever; the lawns are in order, the paths are clean-the appearance of the campus is perfect. .So here's a word of thanks to the College authorities and let's hope that the repairs on the Chapel are soon completed. shipmat<>s.

This week the spotlight falls unanimous!~· upon Ed Fitz. traine1· and g-~·m instructor at llnion fot· over twenty years. To the civilians, Ed is well-known through theil· gym classes. Innumerable are the times that he has led them in calisthenics o1· dit·ected them in setting up bleachers and picking up paper on Alexander Field. How- eve!', Ed's most well-known task is keeping the athletic grounds in perfect condition. The snow has hardly melted awa~·. the ground is still soggy, and alr·ead~· Ed can be seen out on the field, preparing it fot· early baseball practice. The rolle1• and the chalk mm·ker aTe his standard tools. The diamond must be rolled and the track must be rolled. The foul lines must be marked and the hatters' boxes must he marked. There ts work to no end. And then a heavy showet· the following night may undo a few days' labor. But Ed is not discouraged. The next day he Is out there again, toiling in the early Spring- sun. Later, when the baseball and track seasons are in full swing, not a day passes when Ed is not out on the field, planning, arnmging, and repa!l'lng. Always clothed in his tmdi- tional garb-a pair of ,,·hite shorts-hl' lws ah·ead~· acquired a heav~· tan before most of us even shed om· heavy underwear. .:-..:ow, in the Summer, Ed has shifted his centet· of activit~- to the tennis courts. Any- one who has eve1· played tennis, knows the necessity of ha villg a well-kept tennis court. No one can find any criticism with the mag- nificent way in which Ed handles the tennis court situation. Perfectly rolled and marked they are a delig-ht to every tennis player. Besides these chores, Ed also keeps the gmss on Alexander Field in condition by applying the hose and the sprinklers on hot, dry days. All who have ever met Ed, know him as a grand fello\v and a tireless worker. For his great popularit;y, his cheerful spirit, and his twenty-one years of service we give three cheers to our Ed Fitz. FIRST CALL Last .;\londay. the first call for football was issued. Thi.s is some\vhat eal'lier than in 1~ormal times-excepting, of course, spring practice-but this year the season will begin on Septembet· 9th, so that no time can be wasted in getting- star:~:d. A promising group of about seventy-five men showed up and began to limber up under the direction of .\Iel IIein, our football coach. Perhaps it is still somewhat too earl~' to get into the real football spirit. Howeve1·, a little support of the men out for the team by che student body will be highly appre- ciated. Of course, the baseball season is still upon us, a new intramural softball league started on]J· a \veek ago, the major league t•ace is still wide open-in short, the topic of the day is baseball-football is yet beyond the horizon. But not for long. A little over a month, and we'll be over in Troy, cheering Union to its first victory of the season. So let's get into the football spirit. It may l.Je too hot to pla~· the game now, and tennis, softball, and swimming may seem more ap- propriate, but we ought to think a little bit about football anyway. This year there may be greater dif- ficulties than in other years. We did not have an~· team last year and thus have a decided lack of experienced players. Of course, there are those V-12's who have tmnsferred from other colleges and gained some experiences there last year. Except for these and a handful of recent high school graduates, hardly anyone has played any football since two years ago. Thus, .i.\Iel Hein will have quite a task of organizing and training on his hand. The fact that this is his fir:,t year of coaching- at Union will not make it any easier for him. Ilowever, we are sure that these handicaps will easily be overcome once the players have had some more pmctice. It's nice to see that we are having a foot- ball team again this yem'. Last year's omis- sion was unfortunate. Let's make up for it this year with a championship season. \Var.

A democracy cannot be maintained if the candidates that are elected are not supported by a majority of all the people. It is everyone's duty to vote. Detailed information for abst>ntee voting by V-12's has been posted on the bulletin board in mess hall. Everyone over twenty-one should b-e sure to examine it and arrange for his vote. Of course, it is not enough mere!~- to vote. One must also know one's candidates. This is perhaps one of the most important cam- paigns of the United States' history. A very careful choice in selecting one's candidate is imperative. The race will probably be even closer than it was in the 1940 P1·esidential election. A l'elatively small shift of votes in a few large states may mean a shift in the election result and may mean a different post-wat· policy.
