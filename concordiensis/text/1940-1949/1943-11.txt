THE COLLEGE TAKES OVER j had :il).:il it aplenty. 'v\'edne;;cb.1· a!temoon in Assembly, Pl'esi- dent Fox mml.e an announcement which rep- resent;; a great cha.ng·e in the policy of the college toward stuctent activitie;;. lh'. Fox explained that ~ince the college admini~tm­ iion anrl thP tru~tee:s have felt it nece~:sary to exerci;;e a ce1·tain amount of control over ::;tudeut aclivitie;;, due to the 1~bnormal coil- clition~ under which the college i~ operating-, unlike nu1mal peacetime conditio11s wheu little if any contl·ol is foisted upon the stu- dents, they felt it only fair that they ::;hould beat· the financial bm·cten of the activities. \\'e feel that the action taken by the ad- ministmtion \\'a::;, under the circumstances. a conm1endable one in many respects. Since the college· has deemed it neces~mry to ex- ercbe control over the student activities, they are eliminating a major sour·ce of student n:sentment ag·ainst au~· such control by nmk- ing all activitie~ free to all students, \'-1~. \'-.i. alld civilian, and ena.fJ!ing all students to pmticipatl' to as full Hn extent as they may severally desire without any considei'h- tion as to tlw condition of their· pocketbooks. Also, the elimination of the apparent dis- CI imination between navy and civiliHn stu- dents in regard to their voluntary Ol' enforced financial support of student extra-curricular affair;; tends to ama.lg-amate the entire stu- dent body as a single unit. That a certain amount of administration supervision i::; necessary under the p!'esent wartime operation of the college is conceded by a majol'ity of thinking students. Closer supenision by tlw faculty lessens the like- lihood of an activity's degeneration due to the sudden rlepartme of its trained leader~ and participant>;, and l.J~· establishing a uni- form policy pe1·petuates better the quality of the various o1·ganizations. Another advantage of the new scheme of affairs manifests itself in a pmely financial wa~·. Students, who seem to be perennially impecunious, can save an extra four o1· five dollars which can g-o fo1· War Bonds or Stanrps, o1· an,v of the thousand and one ways that money seems to vanish. Few of us would choose to spend four dol- lars for any purpose which might be achieved in the same manner just as well without the expenditure. \\'e can be thankful that the administration has been kind and generous and fair enough to shell out some twelve or thirteen hundred dollars when the:> might have insisted on our raising the money our- selves, with tl~e same proviso that now exists in regard to t].Jeir exercising control. \\'e mig·ht also point out that thb action by the trustees strengthens the already pre- valent conviction that many of the benefits of college are not derived from the purely academic side of undergraduate life.

At a latet· date collectors for each darm wHl be appointed by the committee. Final plans for the drive have not yet been laid, but they will be announced as soon as is pos- sible. In announcing the drive, Chairman Mann emphasized the committee's hope for a very suc- cessful response.

Some confusion was The party will include din- ner at Hale House and a dance in Hanna Hall. This is open to any members of the Freshman class -Civilian or Navy- who register by Thursday noon of next week.

Versaci pointed out, however, that the price will be increased early in the week preceding the dance, and he urged that everyone who plans to attend purchase his ticket as soon as possible. Tickets will be distributed to 1 epresentatives in each \ship\ and dormitory, and the men in the houses can pur- chase theirs from these representa- 1 tiveE'.

The years just after· the end of \\'orld \\'ar [ were filled with hope for the people of the allied countries. That hope, however, soon tumed to despair as events retumed to theil' pre-war }}attern.

That may \Vel! haw happened. But we must not fail to recognize that our pa.rt in losing the peace was also large. X ot until the war was nearly fom· years old did the Allies concede the necessit:.-.· of a unified command. ln this war we have prof- ited from that mistake, the Allied Supeeme War Council being- in charg-e of every opera- tion except those on the Russian front. \The War to End Wars\ did not end \\.'ars. but not lJecause the war itself was not suc- cessful. It was rather the failu1·e of the people of the world to make the peace work, weak though it may have lJeen. In thinking over the gene1·ai course of events during- the past twenty-five years, we are left with the distinct imp1·ession that this war could have been prevented had the people of the world wanted to prevent it. v\·e do not mean to imply that everyone loves vvar.

On the shoulders of those still here when the next .Armistice is signed, v.-ill fall the bm·den of making their sacrifice the first step in draw- ing- the peoples of the world more closely tog-ether. The mistakes made after the last war must not be repeated. We must realize that peace is much more than the mere absence of war; we must realize that international security is best achieved by commtmit.\· effort and commtmit~· sacrifice; we must realize that the bm·dens of making- a peaceful wol\ld will fall primarily on our generation; and \Ve must also realize that peace can only be main- tained b~· actively working for it, not by working against war.

Communique Number I l'eleascd by Head Tige1· Breeding to all ac- tive Tigers on Nov. 7, 1943. The Princeton Eating Club takes great pleasure in announcing the pledg- ing of Ernest Frederick Fearn of Niagara Falls, New York. Fearn. one of the new V-12B, graduated last June from high scr.ool where he was a member of the SPCM. At a cerf'mony held recently, Fearn was advanced from the rank of Cub to Cub Bengal. Communique Number II released by Head Tiger Breeding on Nov. 8, 1943. It is 1·equested that all ac- tive Tigers of the Princeton Eating Club observe daily a ten second silence for each of our three Tigers in the armed services.

Decemb~r 1 featuring Enoch Light and his ~opular orchestra, ar~ well under way, Chairman Reggie Carroll of the dance committee has a~­ nounced. The tickets have been m the hands of the salesmen sin~e early this week, and are now avail- able to everyone on campus through the salesmen in each \'ship\ and dormitory. Off-campus men may obtain their tickets from any one of three men. The on-campus salesmen were named in last week's \Concordi- ensis\. It has been announced that the price of the tickets will go U:P to $4.40 on Dec. 3, and everyone IS urged to purchase his tickets as early as possible. The situation concerning booths for the dance became clouded once again early this week, but the com- mittee has announced the final, definite plans. As originally an- nounced, the price of the booths will be fifteen dollars <$15) for each group, with the money being collected by the ticket salesman as he sees fit. It was thought best to leave the method of raising the money up to the individual group, rather than to have the committee dictate a means, as some houses alrady have funds from which they carr draw. Also, the civilian houses which are \doubling up\ will be able to work together in any man- ner they choose to raise the money .. It was again pointed out by Rocco Ca!andruccio, who is in charge of the booths for the dance, that the booths not only add greatly to the dr..nce and have become an integral part of formals here a.t Union, but they are also necessary for the financial success of the dance, as the funds thus collected are count- e'i on to cover most of the cost of the decorations. Calandruccio also a~ked that all groups desiring booths at the dance notify him 'H' scoon as possible, so that they may be provided for in the plans 0! the decorator. The problem of housing dates for the weekend, which has been bothering l;oth navy men and civi- lians since the dance was first proposed, has finally been partly ec:ved. Official sanction has been granted to the much discussed plan for the civilians to move out of the dormitories and allow the girls :\ take over· for the week\end. This plan, which has been fol- :owed sucsessfully by fraternities 1.1 past years, has always been p.:.pular, as the boys have always fcund it easie1·, and also consider- . bly less expensive. to find places ~or themselves to stay over the \eek-end than to find them for their dates. At the same time, it !s understood that some of the <!ormitories are considering \doub- ling up\ for the week-end, with all the girls staying in one house, ~nd the toys in another. The dance committee points out, however. :'at each house must make its own airangements, and that it sought 0n!y permission for the houses as 1 group. and was not making ar- J·~ngements for any particular house. Unfortunately, such an arrange- ment will not be nossible for the men in the navy- \ships\. How- ~\·er, there is available in the stu- dent employment bureau, a Jist of npproved boarding houses near the campus which will probably have rooms available for the week-end. The Hotel VanCurler also sug- gests that, for anyone planning to stay there or to put his girl ·up there, he make the reservation at lHt.st a week in advance so as to be sure to have a room. Professor Bennett announced that as yet there has been no request to the Finance Commit- tee for any activitv funds.

F ~I 1, I • ·' ~ I I \- ·, l 0 e Last night we received the fol- lowing communication which in our 1 mind is wor·thy of space. ' \It's time I stuck my neck out. The big hullabaloo on campus this , WPek is concerned wtth the article I m the last Concordy on the pres- entation of the r·egimenta>l flag by a group of young Skidmorites. I pt·e- f\r not to use the word 'Skidmorons' ~s the Concordy did. Now it's com- mon sense that the article was writ- ! ten with very bad taste, but after ~~======================;..;;.====~=====....;;===========:dl i seyeral perusals of it, I still don't !Je!ieve it warranted all the out- APOLOGY burst that was unleased over it and its author. Many of the things in the article should ha,ve appeared in a column, not a news story, but stm much of it was pathetically tt\U(>. When the girl:,; of Skidmore College pro- dded tlw l'nion College \'-12 unit \\'ith a reg·imental flag in last week's Assembly, an all-too obvious gap in the unit was filled .• ..\ more> gracious ~rift, or a more appropriate one. \HJUld be hard to imagine. Because of some difficulty iu unfolding the flag at the proper mnnwnt, our fair guests took what is kno\\'n as a ribbing from the audience. This was, howeve1·, all in good fun, and was, we hope, taken as a contribution to the f1·ipndly feeling existing behnen the twn institution~. The comments which appeared in last week's issue of the Concordiensis m·e not to l.Je taken as the prevailing attitude of tho·se at l'niun, be they civilian or in the V-12 unit. fi1e true reaction of the student body to the gitt was expres:>ed in the great lmrst of ap- plause which followed the unful'ling of the flag·. Ti1e entire student body wishes to thank the Skidmore gil'ls for these regimental colors (they were used for the first time in the Armistice Da~· Parade, and made a great hit with those who witnessed it). We hereby offe1· our humble apolog·ies for the rough treatment acc01·ded our northern visitors in the columns of this paper. Our t1ue sentiments can be bette1· appr·oximated l.Jy in ~·erting the feeling expressed. \The important thing about the whole affair is not the article it- self and what effect it may have had at S·kidmore, but the repercus- sions that took place here at Union. l.:p till this year the Concordy could say anything short of libel and nothing would come of it ex- cept perhaps a slight suggestion to the Editor from the President which he would politely listen to and then calmly forget. But today the whole situation has changed cirastically. The Concordy is fast bPcoming merely another house or- ~an. No longer is it the free paper o: the student body created to ex- P'\ess their opinions. It is now merely a pawn in the hands of the Administration and when it is told to print certain articles or to de- lete certain articles, the Concordy must acquiesce.

Eliphalet Nott, president of Union for 62 yeat·s, was well-known as a man with fot·esight; in fact his pre- yision was at times uncanny, so Dr. Waldron opined. William H. Seward, who later became Secretary of State under Lincoln, stud·ied un- der Dr. Nott at Union, and respect- ed his opinions so much that he was wont to ask for advice after his undergraduate days were over. I.n one of his letters to Seward, Nott predicted the establishment of the Republican party five years before its organization. Another example of a man with vision cited by Dr. Waldron was Sheldon Jackson, whose work ;n bringing the reindeer to Alaska has been reported in these columns :.;re- \'iously. Dr. Waldron concluded his 1 e- marks with the observation Lhat the lives of these men have a 'Xlell- sage for Union students today. Thinking on them may help in pres- ent-day confusion, he said. As a parting quotation, Dr. Waldron re- eited the proverb from the Oirl Testament, \Where there is no vi- sion, the people perish.\ ----0--- Naval Chaplain Preaches Sun.

Now it is completely reconstructed with grill and soda fountain and many small tables for customers. At its opening the decorations which aroused great- est interest were the photographic reproductions of campus scenes, serving as panels for the north wall. These were selected and pre- pared under the supervision of a committee of faculty artists. Now the room has been further embel- lished by a group of eighteen en- gravings all having historic as well as artistic interest and all from drawings made 'before 1830 by artists then famous and engraved on copper by the earliest of our American engravers. All are scenes from this region of New York State. The earliest is \McDonough's Vic- tory on Lake Champlain\ en- graved and published in 1816 from a painting by Hugh Reinagle, an American painter who founded the National Academy of Design in 11:\29. Benjamin Tanner who did the engraving ra$s high among early Am-erican craftsman in his I field, a group which includes Pauli Revere. 1 The collection includes five aqua- I tints from \The Hudson River Port I F'olio\ published between 1821 and 1826.

Thomas Jeffex·son invited I r.im to teach drawing and painting at the new University of Virginia 1 but he declined. John Hill did the: engraving and in fact established i the short-lived art of aquatint in i the United States. 1 Twelve of the engravings in the Scuttlebutt were made in France about 1826. The .drawings they re- produce were by Jacques Gera1·d Mil be I-t. Before Milbert came to , New Yox·k in 1815 he was profes- ·' ·sor of drawing in the Paris School. of Mines.

But this announcement is on!~· the most recent in a long- li:-;t of official slights of the Cnion Colleg-e Student Dody of which the College Administration is guilt~·. The first <Umouncement of this appoint- ment was made in one of the local new.::i- papers. The Administration did not see !'it to let the students know what was going on in connection with them before the public was told.. We, in othe1· words, me of only secondary importance in the eyes of the Ad- ntini::;tration. \\'e wish to object strongly to this apparently official point of view. The decision to rlrop football from its in- tercollegiate status was comm:unieatecl to the public before thr students of the colleg-e were notified. The College then apologized for this. and the npolog~· was accepted b~· all. A mistake made once can be forgiven. But when the same mistake is made over and ove1· ap:a.in. human patience reaches the limit of its end u ranee. :\!any times in the past has the Administration failerl to cooperatP with the ::;taff of the Concordiensis in ib weekly search for news. During the past two weeks, two events have occuned which all too conclusively p1·ove our point. The first of these has ·been mentioned above: the nppointment of Jesse A.

The continuance of these presen- tations is excellent .in that it <ldds another to the many cultural activities open to stu- dents at the present time. Students here at coHege are given an op- portunitr to pm·chase tickets at a rate much t·educed from those charged the general pub- lic. It is an excellent oppo1·tunit~· for intel- lectual advancement as well as high class en- tertainment examples of which are f<tr too few in Schenectady.

Those stu- dents vrho app1·eciate music and those who wish to learn to appreciate music can avail them3elves of an excellent means of satisfy- ing their cmvings fo1· good music well-played or sung·. In the past subsc1 iptions for the series have been snapped up quickly by concert-hun- gTy townspeople. A certain number of tick- ets has always been reserved for students, however, but they are not held until the eve of the first concert if all others have been sold. Therefore all students who are inter- e:::.ted in hearing good music at reasonable rates are hereby advised to buy tickets as soon as possible. S.
