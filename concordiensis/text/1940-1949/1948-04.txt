Though bitterly opposed by the Arab League with force and violence, the Jews d-id succeed in founding such a hom£>, small as it was. The problem of expanding the Jewish settlement in Palestine became acute and attracted the attention of the world, during and aftf.'r the close of tho recent war. Under the Hitler regime, 6,000,000 of the Jewish people were brutally exterminated and 800,000 broken and shattct,cd men, women, and chil- dren were left stranded in Europe.

Consist- ing of a group of men hand picked for outstanding qualities of lcade!\ship scholarship, and character, the elass was looked upon as one which would m.ake exceptional contributior.s to the trad.itions of the College. At first it appeared that the predictions had been accurate. In contrast to the apathy ·cur- rent among upperclassmen, the Freshmen carried on a spirited rivalry with the Sophomores,. attended the fall athletic contests in large numbers, and joined enthusiastically in extracurricular activities. Early in December, the Freshmen marched to the polls and elected Sam Newcomer president by a large majority. According to all indications, the Newcomer administration would be lively and pro- gressive. The class spirit, however. which had reached its pealt at the R.P.I. football game, had begun to taper off when Newcomer took office. In an effort to combat this trend, the new president instituted a comprehensive program desi['ned to increase Fresh- man interest in sports, social events, apd class organization. A committee system was established to manage this program, and a class news letter, the \Spirit of '51,\ was issued. But after nearly four months in office, the Newcomer administration has accomplished practically nothing. With the excep- tion of the Hale House investigation and the March 6 danee, both of which were largely managed by the Student Council, no constructive achievements of any importance can be attributed to the Class of 1951. Moreover, Sam Newcomer has failed to live up to his chief responsibility as a class president, namely to create an \espi·it de corps\ among the m.embers of the class. There are four predominant reasons for the failure of the Newcomer administration. First, New- comer has failed to get results from his associates. Second, the Newcomer administration. is monopo- lized by a small clique which has received most of are poorly advertised. Fourth, and most important, the class as a whole is laclting in initiative and mo1•ale. Most of the memhers of the class have To answer the question above, the \official\' nason given by the U. S. was that Partition would nut work anu· would lead only to. \bloodshed\. This reason Is obviou•Iv absurd, and only the very naive have a<'cepted it. 1\ •l<e first place, partition has never been put into effect. ~ntl in the second place, we have done nothing to prevent \hloodshcd\ in Pales- tine in the past. We do not seem to renr \bloodshf.'d\ in GrPf.'Ce or China, sending money and men tL> hnth war-torn rountries! President Truman, with a view to bolstering the \official\ reason, said that the U. S. does not want to send American troops overseas: but this is a distortion of the facts as the presence of American officers in Greece and the Naval \task force\ in the Mf.'diterranean testifies. The real reasons for the \U. S. reversal\ are two-- Oil and Russia. Defense Secretary Furrcstnl <associ- ated with Di!lon·Read & Co., investment firm which manages the Texas Corporation and Standard Oil of California, which jointly own Aro.mco in Arabia) admitted that \our\ oil interests would have to be prot PPled at the expense of Palestine before a Huuse committeP on January 29, 1948.

Ray McKinley and his band will be on hand with his excellent brand of music to provide the blithesome melodic atmosphere appropriate on such a festive occasion. We're looldng forward to that ®---~------------------------- musical prowess which has placed Ray's band among the top three of the nation 0 n the \Metronome\ poll and which will be displayed· on prom night. The Alumni Gym will be a scene of verdant splendor, a veritaqle arbor of gre·en tressles with a gay May' Pole in the certter as a pivot point for the whole vernal setting of~ festivity. Celebate this year's renaissance· of nature by dancing around the May Pole with the girl of your choice. Tickets for the prom are $7.00 tax included and will go on sale next week- When the time comes, g'et your ticket from your nearest frat-ernity or dormitory representa- tive. Tickets :Will also be sold. at the College Bookstore. This year, married veterans will be given the special consideration of half price ($3.50) by a pt'om committee that realizes the close budget these stu- dents have to live on. The arrangement for booths will be much the same as in past times. Fraternities and recognized or- ganized groups. on campus can obtain a booth by the payment of the nominal fee of $10. Flowers will be available at the usual re· duced. prices. A further announce- ment concerning the chann,els and prices of flowers win be made. V\IRUC :w-ill be on hand prom night to broadcast a portion ·of the, evening's performance. Included in the broadcast will be the famed Union Octet which will perform during Intermission. The broaEl-- cast will also include some band· selections. Latest on The Bowdoin Plan Definite plans are now being formulated so that eight fraterni- ties will be able to bring .over- one foreign student each for study at Union College for a minimum period of one year, at the end of which time further arrangements may be made. These fraternities are Chi Psi; Phi Sigma Delta, Delta Phi, Beta Theta Pi, Delta Upsilon, Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Delta Theta, and Alpha Delta Phi. Under the conditions ·Of what has come to be known as the Bawdoin Plan, after its inception at that school last year, the stu- dent's tuition is to be paid by the college, and passage by the country from which the man comes, leaving the fraternities responsible for the books, room, and board. Students are available from most of the countries of Europe, including those under Russian domination. Difficulty in obtain- ing men from Holland· and Bel- gium stems from the policy of those governments of sending students only on the graduate level- French students, as well as those from Germany, face a financial situation which makes it almost impossible to bring them to .this country. The entire program is being handled by Richard Balch, ad- missions, and Dean Huntley, with the co-operation of the In- stitute of J;:nternational, Educa• tion in New York C~ty. / Candidates Clown; Convention Not Confused .Shown above ·is the \color\ provided by several of the candidates at the past week's \Cha11el fracas\ in which campaign managers held forth en their favorite sons.

While the city gov- ernment of Schenectady wagged a negatiYe finger, members of Delta Chi fra- tel'nity started moving fl'om their dormitories in- to their new home.

Injunction Sought Kelsie E. Mead, corporation counsel for the city, said ye::;terday that application for an injunction to halt occupancy of the building at 1227 Weldell Avenue would be made within a day or two. The matter had been dumped in his lap by LeRoy C. Purdy, city engi- neer, who is responsible for en- forcement of zoning rules. McGivern early this morning was confident of the lt>ga lily of the fra- ternity's move, asserting he has been well-advised in the action. He based his contention that the fra- ternity has violated no zoning rules on a New York State Supreme Court ruling in a similar case. The house, once owned by G. E. Emmons, former General Electric Company vice president, was pur- chased April 5 by the Alumni As- sociation of Delta Chi Fraternity, Inc .. for $25,000. Nearly a year of negotiations preceded the purchase. Up to CounC'i! Decision now is up to the city council, which, it was believed by a source close to city hall, will back the plarning commission in its efforts to block the fraternity. Before taking steps toward pur- chasing the property, the Frater- nity. repres<?nted by MC'Givern and Williams, discussed the proposal with residPnts of the exclusive area. No offer to oppose the pur- chase was made, and, said Mc- Givern. some residents heartily endorsed the fraternity's plan. ~owevet·, reported McGivern, Henry D. Wright, 1248 Lennox Road, whose property adjoins the fraternity's Jot at the rear, and whose property is almost directly across Lennox Road from the Delta Phi house, refused even to discuss the matter. He informed the fraternity of his refusal to talk over the plan through his father, W. Howard Wright, 1273 Stratford Road, president of the Schenectady Varnish Company. W. Howard Wright is a trustee of Union College. He also is a member of the city planning com- mission . The fraternity as:;ociation claims 400 members, including a prepon- derance of legal talent since it formerly was a legal fraternity as- sociated with Albany Law School.

It is to this ahout it. The final appro\'al of thE' end that the Stel'l ing Cominittl'e plan is up to t-hat body. The Happy Hour Thet'e are three specific and important observa- tions which can be readily made from the chapel campaigning of the past week, namely, that a large amount of student interest has been created al- though, in certain respects, it might be considered of dubious wortl1, that a number of the candic'ates have taken full advantage of the opportunity pro- vtd.etl for them by the Student Council, and that finally a. much larger number· of candidates has qu·ite misewbly failed to do this. From these ob- :;ervatit-ns. I believe that one can draw the conclu- sion that, though cntain benefits have been accrued ovet· the past week in chapel, the Studer.t Council campaign pre' gram has fallen f\ r short of anything which might be labeled \success.\ Taldng up one of these points at a time, it is pct·fectly obvious that the majority of the Student Bcdy attending these chapel prograrns has enjoyet! it:;;elf immcnse·lr, and that thereby considerable in- tct est has bE'c·n created in the elections. This one might say is certainly sumethir g wotthwhile, and JH'rhaps, in the view of the apathy of past years, it is the> must that anyone could reasonably exepct. It is a rrthet· small gain, however, when one con· sith rs that the aim of these chapels was to promote \intelli1- ent voting.\ It is ~ood to be able to state then that more than student interest through the mostly unintentional comedy hat has ta·ken place has been the result of the> campa-igns. Fortunately a number of candidate\ has seized. the opportunity fer its worth. Simply they have used their allotted time to make as lasting an impr!'ssion upon the minds of' the Student Body as IJOssihla instead of following the rules of general program c.f the Council. Instead of wasting student llme and th<>ir own hy havir.g some nonosylh l>ic illiterate inform his auditol's that his candidate can play football, or sing, or listen to an IRC debate, they have used what time they had to put their names befcre the electcrate. Full realizing the farcical aspects of the situation, they have by divers means, some more imaginative than others, made the best of an unha.ppy an:angement, and for this thE'y dfsen·e credit. For the unfortunates who wet·e tricked ir..to fol' lowing the Cc.uncil program to the letter there can be nothing but commiseration. These candidat<s, eithct· extremely ;;ullible by nature or sniously de· Freedom at Union In the past few months there has been much advetse nitici\m of our Student Council. Some of it may have been well founded and scme may not have. Any organization, no matter what it attempts to du, is open to derogatory remarks from people who know r.·cthing else but to make these same re- marks. As a student at Union College and a citizen of its gove1·nment, you have the right to comment on the Student Council's actions, either pro or ccn. At the same time, the Student Council has the privilpg-e of making its side known. It am not de- fcndir.g the action:> of the Student Council because l do not feel there is any need: for it. Rather I would. hl'e to make a compat·ison between our stuC:.ent government and that of several schools which had delegates at a recent student government conference at Alfred University. Ken Whalen and I attended this conference and had an opp~ rtunity to discuss campus problems wftll delegates from Cornell, Colgate, Russell Sage, Siena, Syn:IC\lSe, RIT, Hamilton, Hobart, University of Buf- fa.lo, and a bout 15 or 16 other schools. The main topics cf discu;;sion were based on the construction and power>< of diffprent stud·E'nt councils and studer.t taxes. Several of the student councils located at the represented colleges were composed of men who represented different organizations rather than the four individual classes. It was general agreed that this form of representation was inadeq]J.ate to ful- fill the nreds of a student body as such, that it could very easily become a tool wielded by the larger, stror.ger campus organizations. Three others. including Buffalo State Teachers Ccllel(e, had councils composed of stated numbers from each department of the school and the figures were set accorcing to the size of the department. This, teo, gave one or two of the larger groups the opportunity. to control the council's actions. The chief point that is to be made a~ ainst the aforementioned types of representation is that ;!most all ·cf the schools whose councils operated undet· a set-up such as that admitted beir:g very weal' when it came to gettL\g any scrt of action. The weakness was definitely in the organization itself, because, although the:\( did have certain rights and powers stated in their constitution, they were IF-- ,FRIDAY, APRIL 16. 1'948 by James A. Baar ficient of mental equipment, have allowed themselves to .be made into a laughing' stock by taking the Council arrangements at face value. They have at- tempted in sober tones to carry but the campaigr.ing, and because of the content in the speeches allowed b:v the Council and the quality of many of the spealt:ers they have held themselves up before the Student Body for nothing but abuse and ridicule. It is in this ftnql factor that the Council pr·ogmm has been a failure of no mean ·order. Though there .is now mu1·e interest in the elections than there was before vacation; though there have been d·effnite gains made in a number of individ-ual campaigns by those who seized a marvelous opportunity for pub- licity through prcper handling and understanding, these cannot be considered grounds for a \success\ t'ecision. There a1e few today on campus who ·know more about the men running f-or ·office other than that they are \good boys;'' \good athletes,\ or \good l'\C'wman Club mem-bers.\ A resolving of this situa~ tic n alone could have meant true success. There is r.o doubt that if a man running for stu- dent government is interested in extra-cur.ricular activ·ities that that is something to credit him with in the overall picture, but it must be in an overall· picture. The only activities which are actually ·Of vital importance in such a: view are those il) which the carl'd·idate has been a leader. We first and last cf all want to know of that. The fact that a candi- date can sing will aid him little when serving as a class officer. Some arrangement should, therefere, have be·en made through which the Student Body, or rather the particular classes, would have had .an oppor- tunity to hear the candidates speak themselves. Thtough this the ccllege would have had at least an inlding as to the menta-l and character stature of these men. This way one is not even cognizant of whether his candidate knows many words. What has happened this week tells us clearly what the trouble is with the present Student Council. The majority of the men composing it were elected under quite similat· ch·cumstances, and the majority cf these men tacitly announce the fact every tf'me the Council meets. The Student Body of Union Col- lebe will nevet• get a.nywhere through legal channels until it has a strong Student Government. It can never el<:>ct on!' by guess work. by William O'Neill unable to do anything because of interr:_al weak- nesses. I we ul.d like to mention Buffalo State Teachers College again. because they had a situation concern- ing their student government that was, as they put it, \rotten through and through\. Their trouble was not chiefly in their structure or in their constitu- tion, but in their ability to negotiate agreements fl'Cm their administration. No matter what they decide to do, whether or not they have the power to perform certain. acts unc'er their constitution, they must get administrative approval in order .to act. In most of the remaining schcols, their student governing bodies were influenced to ;;t. great extent, if not dominated by faculty .members. Now a word concerning the discussions on stu- dent taxes. Of the 25 or so colleges represented, there were only three that assessed a tax that was lower than ours, Siena $3, Nazareth College for Girls in Rcchester $15, and. Rochester Institute of Tech-· nology $15. We were unable to get a complete story on what is accomplished at Siena. but we do know that the other two schools do net have a program of student activities that is even comparable to ours. All of this adds up to one thing in my mind, and Mr. Whalen and I were very outspoken in this re- spect at the conference. Despite the certain amount of griping and complaining about student govern- ment on this campus, we stili have a council that is able to accomplish far more than almost any school ycu might mention. The conference was amazed when we told how· our council was able to f):'eHiy voice the student opinion in a misunderstanding be- tween an administrative officer and the stuC:ent body; how our Student Council refused to accept the denial cf varsity standing to a soccer team; how our student council was able to bring about a complete revision in the athletic award system; of a council whose mee,tings are always open and whose presi- dent is able to meet freely with the college presi- d·ent after every meeting to discuss student prob- lems; ancj about how our student tax funds are completely run by students and open to student appeal at all times. Mr. Whalen and I returned with a mueh more confident feeling in the student ,government at Union. .I During- the pn>t yNJ.l there hns lor·rn a dcfinit<' n<'<'tl fm· bett('r unlit·t :-:t:1ndint.: and mote cn-op(\la- ti\n bt'l wt•en tht· ad min i~tl ation and thP student body.

Record Vote Cast at Election John Hanna was elected~ the president of next -~----- -·-- ~--· --··- ---- Another Round in Housing Fray ·year's senior class, after a rousing campaign and a hotly contested election. John DeBello and Sam Newcomer were elected presidents of the Junior and Sophomore classes re- spectively. The campaigns presented ballyhoo ranging from a sul- 1 tan on a litter, complete with 1 slaves, to a torchlight parade. One form of campaigning or another secured a phenomenal I turnout at the polls of 707c of the student body. This 1 was a marked contrast to the general lethargy and apathy exhibited in the elections of previous years. Action Party Defeated The results of most of the ballot- ing were clear cut and definite. Sam Newcomer, incumbent pr'()si- dent of the Freshman Class, VI on in the most hotly contested cam- . paign. A group, calling themselves the Action Party, was formed to defeat him and verbal!y tore apart his administration of the Fresh- man Class. Newcomer was finally endorsed at the polls by a slim plurality of five votes. The organization of parties add- ed much color to the campaigns and gave much impetus to the get- ting out of votes. Telahpile, which met phenomenal success by sweep- ing a slate of ten candidates into office, led the fiock in percentage of votes with 24 per cent. It loosed a barrage of radio commercials and post cards on the unsuspecting campus. The Representative Party secured the election of seven of its candidates, two of whom were en- dorsed by other groups. It polled 12 per cent of the votes. Among the organized parties, the Action Party of the class of '51 brought up the rear with the election of two of its candidates. The 36 per cent of the votes polled by the Telahpile and Representative Parties proved to be the deciding factor in the elections, since the independent vote was well split among numer- ous splinter parties and independ- ent candidates. New System Used The revised election system which permitted schoolwide cam- paigning stimulated much interest in the contests. In addition to pro- viding a week of chapel programs ranging from the stuffy to the hilarious, this new system ac- quainted the student body with the men who would represent th-em.

Let's see what kind of benefits the average American family of four can count on as a result of this measure. Supposing that this hypothetical family of ours has an annu:l inccmP of $2.500.

Greenery To the tune of tinkling rhythms<$> and soothing songs, Primavera will take over the campus for the week- end, according to plans announced by the Junior Prom Committfle this week. John Pert a, publipity chair- man, cleared the air with the state- ment that primavera is the Italian word, for Spring, and in the spring you know where a young man's fancy tends. ' veterans on campus will attend. · Booths for the prom are avail- able as usual to all fraternities and other organized groups on campus. They may be secured by leaving a signature and $10. at the Student Activities Office. Despite this fine beginning the Council backed water when it came time to reject a bill for $67.50 from the administration for re- painting and replacing parking limitation signs that were defaced recently. It is the Administration's contention that if the Council is to take credit for the good they do for the college, they should also pay for the students' acts of evil. How they arrive at this conclusion is a little nebulous but apparently the new Council agrees with them. So now the Council drops $67.50 into the bucket. The only consola- tion is that there was a job w.eii done. Also considered by the Council was a Jetter from RPI asking for funds (via an ad iil some magazine published by RPI to help send their lacrosse team to England. There has been adv£>rse feeling ex- pressed to any raising of funds at Union for the b-enefit of RPI, by many people on campus who have come in fairly close contact with RPI students. This feeling was expressed at the meeting, and after the meeting by those who didn't want to speak in public against a subject which Bill Ketz had brought up. Killian mentioned that the IFC was considering spending the money and with that the Council sank back and decided to wait for the IFC action. Ketz also announced that Stu- dent Council notebooks were on order and would soon be here for new members. No one could dis- agree with the flat statement so everyone was happy. After the last move by the old Council turned into a -waste of time and the matter of the salaries for the publications' staffs was referred to the new Council, some definite action was final]¥ taken. After glowing harangues by several frosh delegates, the matter was tabled for a week while the Tax Commit- tee draws up a factual summary of the cut system to present to the Council before next Tuesday's meeting. At that time a final vote vvill be taken. Alternatives will probably be complete abolition of cuts, reduction in the size of the cuts or a status quo. The Council was offered space in the CONCORDIENSIS to present thdr view~ un the ~1tua.tion but the offer was turned down by those who oppose the present system. Apparently they would rather dis- cuss these matters in the caucuses in the smoke filled rooms of Old Gym. Dancing girls will flutter and . Union men, dressed as penguins and headwaiters, will cavort. Ray McKinley will drum and Marcy Lute~· will look sexy. Chaper.ones will took the other way as Prima-. vera goes on full blast. Prom Chairman Phil Brady can loose his worried look and festive moods can reign, let's hope nothing else does. As the theme of the dance sug- gests, the gymnasium will be de- corated to look as springy as pos- sible. Flowers, foliage and other assorted greenery will be distri- buted generously ·about the gym- nasium, and there will be some trellises to further suggest the sea- son. And for those who haven't Fund Lack Delays Station Attempt to Join Network Tickets have been on sale since Monday by agents in all fraternity houses, dormitories, and through . the Student Activities Office. The ticket sellers will also take orders · for the flowers, for which they have the complete price lists.

On the face of the general calibre of Student Government on the campus this will undobutedly be at frequent in- tervals. Seconp:ly, the Administration has· given the campus an excellent ex- ample of their inability in divers instances t0 understand the Union undergraduate .mind. T-heir entire treatment of the parking situation has been badly bungled from the beginning, and the destruction of the signs was ah obvi0us reaction which should have been antici- pated. If, instead of taking in- f0rma:l soundings from members of the old C0uncil at a private dinner in his home, Dr. Davidson had called a meeting of car owners on the campus, the picture might have been c0nsiderably di:f- ferent. The day that the Adminis- tration learns that the Student B0dy does not Hke high hand·ed measures wHI be an extremely bright one. Fina·lly through the adumbra- ti0ns of the new C0uncil we have been given an idea of what to expect in the future. Instead of all that was hoped it appears that we are once more confronted with the usual group of quiverers and fiddlers with, or course, the far too few exceptions and that once again the slogan \Thou shalt fear the Administration\ is pasted in every- man's hat, In October, 1947, in a statement issued to the Concordiensis, yo)l stated that during the school year five or more concerts and twelve or more lectures 'vould be sponsored by the college for the benefit of the student body. The aforesaid pl'ogram has been faithfully carried out this year, but with exceedingly poor unclergl'aduate attendance. I shall not argue the merits of the lecturers and artists that have ueen presented this year. But from more than ten personages heard, only ~ ver,y small percentage were people of prominence, at least from the point of view of universal pul.>lic recognition. Granted that general knowledge and acceptance is not the only criteria or guanmtee 0 of an evening's enjoyment as was the case of Tottenberg, the violinist, or .i.\liss Hay Lev, who will be heard on ::\Ion dar nig·h t. But to the majority of undergraduates as is the case with the ordinary laymen the attraction of a well- known artist does have many advantages in drawing a crowd without any depreciation of quality. If the number of concerts and lec- t.~.ues were lessened and the additional money spent to bring in one ot· two larg-e concerts a year plus a few smaller attractions, greater interest might possibly he aroused towards the series as a whole.

You Letters to the Editor Jf'ant Facts Dear Sir; We would like to know if the Concordiensis often prints articles without having full knowledge .of the facts. This letter is in refet·ence to the article (April ~3) concerning the. election results in which th Action Party was mentioned. Your reporter stated, \A group. calling themselves the Action Party, was formed to defeat him (Sam New- comer') and verbally tot\ apart his administration of the Freshman Class.\ This statement is entirely false for (1) the Action Party was formed to help elect men whom we thought would work toward the ad- vancement of the Class of 1951; (2) the Action Party had alt·eady been organized and its policies ·had already been stated before New- comer had even announcd his in- tention of running again; (3) the Action Party attacked Newcomer in ab&olutely no way. The only at- tack made on Newcomer was by Concordiensis re·porter, Don Cregier. Cregier was then a member of the Action Party, but his article was written without the authorization of the Party. Soon after the pub- licaion of that article, Cregier re- signed from the Aetion Party. The Party stated in iis publication, The Foghorn (vol. 1, no. 2), that the article was written without its per- mission. Your reporter also stated that \the Action Party of the class of '51 brought up the rear with the elction of two of its candidates. \The Acti.on Pa.I'ty ran candidates only in the Freshman elections, for the Party believes that the Class of '51 should be left in the hands of the members of '51 without inter- ference from the other classes. The Action Party had two of its candi- date~ elected which is as well as any party made out in the Fresh- man Class. W~ would like to take this op- portunity to pledge our support to a 11 of the recently elected Fresh- men officers. We, of the Action Party, feel that our job has just begun, and we will work to malie '51 a class the college won't forget. We also want to thank those men who have supported our platform ad candidates. Weo feel confident that Harry Petrak and' Walt Free- man will live up to the trust put in them by their classmates. THE ACTION PARTY George S. Bradford, Chairman We fail to Wlderstand how an Actio:n Party candidate can com~ pete for vottes with Sam New- comer without opposing him. As for CONCORDlENSIS articles printed without facts, we have, obviously, given the facts by printing the above letter. Offer Thanks To the faculty -and students of Union College: I wish to thank the students and faculty who helped in any way to malte the recent Eastern Colleges Science Conference a success. Especially, I want to thank Dr. Bacon. and the faculty committee, Dr. Clarlt and Dr. Hurd for their air in acquiring speakers, and. all other faculty members who helped to arrange exhibits. The Conference committee wishes to extend its gratitude to the fac- ulty wives for entertaining the delegates. I also wish to express my appre- ciation to the student committee consisting of Cliff Casey, AI Corbo, Dick Halpern, Mike Heymen, Jim Nelson, Bud Mallery, Bern Mc- Grath, Bob . Varick,' and Bob Walker. These men devoted a great deal of time and effort to making the conference of real value to the delegates. Dear. Sir: Sincerely, Graydon L. Loomis, Chairman 1948 ECSC A. Plea Thi\ iR in regard to the 8truggle of Alpha Phi Omega for recogni- tion on this campus. The move- ment is closely allied with and in- dorsed by the Boy Scouts. As a service fraternity it cuts across fraternity lines and has no desire to establish a house. Its aims are to provide a continuity in the life of those college men who have been active in the Scout movement in their younger days. It puts the prestige of a national organization behind those scouts now on the campus who are voluntarily giving a great deal of their free time to help local scoutmasters with their troops. These students need such recog- nition and they deserve it. The or- ganization will work in close co- operation with community ·leaders in the various youth movements- by publicizing such movements· by forming scout troops; and by w~rk­ ing with scoutmasters in this area. This work throws the student in contact with the type of men he will want to associate with in later life; it gives him the experience in civic leadership that should prove a valuable background and a fine recommendation for prospective employers. Lastly, it provides a closer link between the community \the real world\ and the college. ' Peter M. Kelly '51 Hiram J.

His belief that Russia will abandon the C0hintern and allow the U.N. to have an armed force larger than any other country, despite all indications to the con- trary. 2. His belief in the peaceful in- tent of Russia despite the evi- dences of unjustifiable aggression in Eastern Europe. 3. His belief that \a Wall Street military clique\ in Washington Is the cause of the present tension between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. 4.

His myopic generalizations, which though they contain some truth are in fact half-truths which fail to consider all the evidence available. 6. His evident bias to Russian interests when they conflict with those of his own country. 1. His nauseating insistence that he is ·an ultra-liberal and a cham- pion of the masses while he makes no protest against the murder of liberty and freedom in Eastern Europe.

The position ·Of manager of any of the intercollegiate sports her.e at Union entailliJ more than merely placing the equipment in order be- fore each game. The manager has complete control over the financial transactions of away games, plus the arranging of the necessary rese1·vations for the m'llmbers of the squad. Any freshman who is interested in becoming a candidate manager should contact Frank Touramini or Coach John McLaughry as soon as possible.

The over- whelming victory was contradictory to Bill Ketz' pred.Jctions.

Ray Mullane, who has done a superlative job in coaching the track team during Bill Ketz' ill- ness, coached the team in this fray. The Garnet cindermen garnered first places in all the events ex- cept one. New Records Set Ken Whalen captured first spot in the 16 pound shot event to set a new record. Whalen's toss sailed 47 feet and 1 inch which bettered the mark set in 1931 by over two feet. John Noonan, Trinity star, hurled the discus 138 feet and 6 inches to break the record in that department. Noonan's effort was the only first place that Trinity snared. Ollie Personeous turned In a stellar performance for the Dutch- men by taking first spots in the 100 and 200 yard dashes and in the broad jump.

Fred Wyatt, lacrosse mentor, is very intcHsted in try- ing out an operation similar to the one cooked up by \Howdy\ Myers at Johns Hopltins. A contest be- tween the stickmen and the dia- mondmen, the lacrosse men using nothing ·but their sticks in the field, should prove a darn good con test, not to mention the fact that such a unique tilt might result in some good publicity for the College. The lacrosse-baseball contest at Johns Hopkins proved to be very enlightening to the overconfident baseball squad, who were swamped by the lightening-like fielding of the \noggin knockers.\ I hope that diamond mentor Art Lawrence can see a way to fit such a contest in his schedule this year. The ideal date woud probably fall on Saturday, May 8th, when both the teams are idle. The only difficulty in a match of this sort is the lack of a pitcher for the lacrosse team. I think that perhaps one of the Garnet pitchers would be very glad to help the stickmen in their dilemma. What do you say, Mr. Wyatt and Mr. Lawrence? Are your teams ready and willing? . I realize that May 8th is a pretty 1mportant date· on the Union calen- dar; but the proposed intrasquad match would certainly add color to the already colorful Prom Week- end. How about a 7 inning ex- hibition game? The laughs would more than counteract the effort -expended and it certainly would be a contest to go down in Union's annals. I'll guarantee that the fe- male element on the campus that weekend will go home with some- thing to tell the folks about. * * * Mullane's Cup Rlllllleth Ove1• The Mul·lane coached track team in drubbing that Trinity squad, 90 1!3 to 34 2/3, must have given their emergency coach a great deal Golfers Lose O.pener The Syracuse golf team had little trouble in disposing the Union \muffin-men'' at the Drumlins Countl'y Club last Wednesday.

Th.e one point difference was made by the disqualification of Joe Tofel, for what the judges called an \il- legal'' !tick. At the time, Coach Mullane re- frained· from making any conm-ent; but to others who saw the meet there was definitely a \nigger in the woodpile.\ The whole handling of the meet by the judges was defi- nitely not in the accepted manner.

J. McLaughry's varsity football squad started formal s~ring practice last Monday which will run for a gruelling three weeks. This weel{ has seen 52 spirited varsity aspirants working out the winter kinks on one hand and picking up a few new ones on the other. Fundamentals have been stressed along with ·orienta- tion of a comparatively complex system designed by Coach Mc- Laughrr to keep the opposition guessing. In addition to the squad present- ly worlting, there are approxi- mately ten varsity football men on the baseball. track, and lacrosse teams who put in a football ses- sion earlier this term. All during March and most of April, various groups weer holding informal prac- tice in the Alumni Gym.
