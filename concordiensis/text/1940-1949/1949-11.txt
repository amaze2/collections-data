And, as much as I enjoyed the notoriety, I began to get a little worried. THEN, HOWEVER, I heard a somewhat similar story about an analogous incident, and my mind was considerably eased. It seems that once upon a time, a Harvard student anonymously published a volu~e of poems which poked fun at his school and its professors~and that the book wasn't too well recei-ved by certain persons connected with the college, Headlines in the Boston Post asked if the \Student Satirist\ would be kicked out of school, and President Lowell was forced to issue a statement to the effect that no action would be taken. The reason why that story makes m~ feel better, you ~ee, is that the author of those poems turned out to be none other than the president of Union College.

Dear Editor: I wish publicly to thank President Carter Davidson for inviting to ihe campus the world-famous evangelist, Dr. Bob Jones, Sr., to speak to the student body at chapel Wednesday noon. Previously there have been invited to the week-day chapel pro- grams a :Mormon, a full-fledged Jew, and men of the strongest kind of liberal tendency in their theology to speal~ to us. This is to be expected at Union which is a liberal institution and professes to hold to no stated creed. Now Dr. Bob Jones, who is an inter-national figure, and one of the most outstanding men in his chosen field, a man who believes the Bible and preaches the Gospel of Christ, has been invited and has been heard by a large number of Union students. Those who heard Dr. Jones Wednesday I am sure recognized his straight-fordwardness, and could not help but feel that here was a man with deep com:iction, rr long !ifP of experience to bear it out, and •wmethin)!; duwn to earth in Christianity to offer men today. Thank you, President David;;on. STUART H. MER1UAM Dear Editor: As editor of our publication, the Good News, for the above men- tioned organization <Goodfellowship Corset Club, Inc.), I read with interest tlle enclosed article in Monday's New Yorl,{. Post (UP release on David Markson's article on .Skidmore) and would appreciate a copy of same to publish in my next issue. I feel sure this article will prove of interest to our many readers, totalling over 500 people in our industry. Thanking you in advance for a prompt reply, Very truly yours, JACK CHlPROUT Dear Sirs: Cornelius Burns, one time mayor of Troy, N. Y. was heard to re- marlt, \I don't care if you say anything good about me, I don't care if you sn~· anrthing had ahout me. Just say it.\ I, as president of the student council, am glad that someone is finally interested in goings on !n that body. Machinery is already in operation to clear up the matter of a freshman vote, in the form of a new constitution which we hope will cover very adequately any hazy matters now confronting the council, such as that of a freshman vote. We plan to,:-be ready to vote on this new constitution at the last meeting in Nov. It will be drawn up by our general activities com- mittee, headed by Jack Fischel, aided on this matter by Richard Roberts and Clarence Simmons, who have recently completed con- stitutions of the Pre-Law society and rathskeller respectively. To return to the freshman vote question once more, I did decide that they would have no vote, that is true. Our present, inadequate constitution, is extremely vague on that subject. Last fall freshmen council members had a vote in all matters, due no doubt to ignm;ance or misconstruance of the constitution. Our recommendation to the committee drawing up the new con- stitution, one which we hope and sinc~rely believe will be in all ways adequate, will be thai. Union College freshmen will have a vote in all manners pertaining to student policy. This year those men will not have a vote in the council until their status in that body becomes \permanent.\ At present they are \temporary representatives,\ per- manent elections to be hPld in November. I am sure, likewise, that I as president of the student council will accept the challenge ol'fered in your editorial of 28 Oct., 1949. Sincerely, J, L. COURTER, JR. By Arthur Covell Back in 1941 the Golden Gate Quartet illustrated their revolu- tionary character when they intro· duced Negro spiritual music to cafe society. On Friday, Oct. 28, the Quartet introduced at their recital another musical inn-ovation. It featured a unique and sensitive blend of bop and Negro spiritual music, which offers :Popular music a new direction toward which it may expand. THE TECHNIQUE used was for the baritone to carry the melody of \Old Man River\ with the other three members of the Quartet pro- viding a .backgr-ound of restrained bop which was varied with refrains from the melody. The effect of this new method is-(pardon me, Hollywood)-spectacular. Its great- ness as an innovation is not entire- ly due to the new technique but due to its beh1g a new synthesis. The Quartet also sang some nar- rative .spirituals including \Swing Low Sweet Chariot,\ \Fare Ye Well,\ \Jesus Met the Woman at th~ Wall\ and \My Old Kentuclty Home\ by Foster. The most en- thusiastic welcome I've witnessed at any musical event this year was rewarded with two encores-\Don't Cry Joe\ and \Dry Bones.\ I've never heard the former sung better. DOLORES MARTIN had a diffi- cult task singing on the same pro- gram with the Quartet, but proved her merit by giving an excellent performance. Her provocative voice, friendly stage manner and her per- derstand her popularity in New York cafe society. On Wednesday evening, Novem- ber 2, the Musician's Union, Local 85, presented a symphony concert at Memorial Chapel. Edward A.Rice co.nducted. Miss Francis Keelan, soprano, and William H. Kennedy, baritone, were assisting artists. MISS KEELAN gave a talented performance in \Voices of Spring\ by Strauss. The selection \Ballet Music\ from Gounod's \Faust'' was successfully interpreted by the or- chestra. Discords, imperfect tuning and lack of coordination made the ·playing of \Pilgrim Chorus\ from \Tannhauser\, by Wagner, l!nbear- able. The marble walls of the chapel may have contl'ibuted to the brazen, shrill tone of the tri- angle. Cornell (General Series-High Polymers) \Condensation Poly- merization\. TUESDAY, NOV. 8. VOTE!

NOT SINCE last year's Vermont contest have the Dutchmen tasted defeat and not since 1942 has Wil- liams turned the trick. For one quarter,· the natty Ephmen with- stood two challenges within the ten yat·d line. Then, early in the sec- ond pel'iod, Union passed for a score, added another in the fourth and then yielded a futile Williams tally. On the third play of the second stanza, AI Wade returned Captain Stu Duffield'R punt to the Purple 36 and four plays later Union scored. Dick Speidel charged to the 34 and Buzzy Busino grabbed co-captain Dave Strauss' pass on the 20. Hal Lundstrom bulled to the 17 and cl.Dothcr Strauss-Busino collabm·a- tion netted the touchdown. Wade added the extra point .. UNION had to stop a 45 yard drive in the fourth quarter to gain theil· other sc01·e. Pete DeLisser and sophomore John Morrison had advanced the ball to the Union 28 on alternate end sweeps. Defensive halback Rube Johnson spilled De- Lisser on the 31 with a jolting tackle on a fourth down attempt to gain the necessary three yards for first down. Lundstrom and Speidel brought the ball to the Garnet 43 where an offside penalty set Union back to the 38. Strauss connected to Busino on the 50 and ten rushes by Strauss, Charley Lewis, Speidel, and George Best, the leading Union ground- gainer of the day, advanced to the 20. Strauss hit Busino on the 10, Best ran to the 8, and a holding infraction put the Dutchmen on the 3. Wade· dove over for the score and added the point. AFTER WILLIAMS got the ball, they consumed just thirty seconds of game time to score. Duffield completed four straight passes for a first down on the Union 26. South- paw :\[orrison, the leading ground gainer of the day, took a pitchout from Duffield and heaved a touch- down pass to John Kulsar. Ray Pomeroy broke through from left end to block Ernie Mierzejewski's kick. Cookie Sherwin had pre- ,.iously blocked the attempt, but Union was offsides.

The Dutchmen's Raths- keller will not be opened this weekend, as had been previ- ously hoped, according to Charles F. Lindstrom, busi- ness manager. THREE REASONS were given for postponement of the opening: failure of stud,ents to co-operate in doing the volunteer work neces- sary for completion of worlt, failure of many freshmen to fulfill pledges of funds, delay in shipping and installation of a sewage pump. The decision to _postpone opening was made at a meeting of the rathskeller executive committee last Tuesday.

Letters to the Editor Dear Editor: November 9, 1949 Interfraternity Council Prom Committee Union College Dear Sirs: This letter is to notify you that the Student Council of Union College feels that the program presented on Monday, November 7th, in Memorial Chapel under your auspices for the purpose of advertising the Gridiron Ball was laclcing in refinement and decorum.

John's first year was spent mending a broken group of supposedly potential foot- ball stalwarts Jed by Union's me- morable Hal Enstice and Ken Whalen. The season ended statis- ti.cally 0e same as the one pre- Vlous, w1th many of us wondering what all our hard and extra knocks had brought. One year later we were to know. This conscientious genius of grid- iron .strategy has two factor that are becyond comparison in regard to the boys he coaches. That is, the respect and authority of those that a.re encircled by his whip, A casual smile :means about as much as a million. words,. but those few smiles a.re so limited that we have a dis- ting-uished society among the team.

However, even though \the whip\ had to dodge Star's butter- fly nets and Nistad's catty basket- balls, John gave birth to Union's '48 backfield. The real pre-season test of the winter perfection came in the spring when we trotted away from our afternoon naps to draw equipment from \kindly'' Fred Parks. During this three-week period, football took the place of love as a substitute for spring fever, The summer passed and Labor Day found Union's Library F1eld shuddering every time John wet his wisdom lips and blew his alarm clock whistle.

Philos In Debate The Philomatheans debated the topic of socialized medicine at the Schenectady YWCA last Tuesday night. SPEAKING for the affirmative, Klaus Eppler and Donald Miller pointed out that present medical service is abysmally inadequate especially with reference to low in- come and rural groups. They also pointed out that socialized medicine would not lower the standards of the medical profession and that the patients would be able to pick their own doctors. Roger Fenwick and Richard Rothschild decried the plan as a foul attempt to introduce politics and ·bureaucracy into medicine. They emphasized that the cost of such a program is too great to undertake at this tim€ of unbal- anced budgets. lJfcKinney Reveals Noony in Conference The study of the Noony began on the Union College cam- pus last Wednesday in Memorial Chapel when Dr. Fred Mc- Kinney, professor of psychology at the University of Missouri revealed that a Noony was, among other things, the average confused college student.

WILLI Alii VAN OST, chairman of the chapel committee, started the dehate by asking the council who was responsible for the pro- priety of the chapel programs. Van Ost stated that if the council was going to have to censor the pro- grams he would t·esign as head of the chapel committee. Stewart Stephens, chairman of the prom committee, admitted that the pro- gram had not been up to par and stated that he was willing to apolo- gize for material that President Davidson and a number of students found objectionable.

SINCE COACH McLaughry installed the winged \T\ for- mation against Williams after the loss of the great Hal Eu- stice in '47, the Dutchmen have won 16, lost 2 and tied 1. Union has raced through 13 games without suffering a de- feat, dating back to the 7-6 loss against Vermont last year. Now being the only undefeated squad jn upper New York state, the Dutchmen started the cam- paign with a 25-16 victory over St. Lawrence to continue the 5 game winning streak carried over ft·om last year. In the home debut the following weeK, Rochester was downed, 26-7. Revenge was the lmynote in the 27-7 triumph over Vermont in what was probably the best game Union turned in all year. THE TRADITIONAL R.P.I. bat- tle was fought in the mire, and three goal-line-stands by a hardy Union defensive line were neces- sary to earn the 14-6 verdict. The 39-0 homecoming victory over Ho- he,rt was merely a tune-up for the c!imax game with Williams the following week. The determined Ephmen were the most talented crew faced all year and they fell. victim, 14-6, in a bitterly fought contest. Middlebury pulled a stun- ning surprise as they held the Gar- net to a 14-14 deadlock in snow and t~ain to partially avenge the upset of 1948. The Hamilton game was a com- plete sm·prise to nobtJdy. Union scored 10 touchdowns, four of them by George Best, in their finest of- fensive display of thE) year. Best tallied twice in the first three min- utes of play and from then on, it was no longer a contest.

Although there have been many magazines and publica- tions in the past this is the first weekly student newspaper at St. Andrews and the editor should jUE\tlY be proud of his work. During the last year the need for a university newspaper made itself increasingly evident. In Oct. 1948 the extreme left wing political ele- ments issued a scarlet paper called \Unity.\ Later in the year the Conservatives issued an anti-scarlet paper called \Veritie.\ A smudged copy of a thing called \Chastity\ (Markson and Skidmore please notel was purported to have been published by a Christian faction in the university but the contents of the document make this doubtful. ·The appearence of these papers made it obvious that there was a need and a sufficient number of so- cially minded people to warrant the issue of a university newspaper, and pressure having been applied to the students' representative coun- cil, we now have it.

Van Ost stated that if the council was going to have to censor the pro- grams he would resign as head of the chapel committee. Stewart Stephens, chairman of the prom committee, admitted that the pro- gram had not been up to par and stated that he was willing to apolo- gize for material that President Davidson and a number of students found objectionable. James Murry, chairman of the board of managers, asked who had complained to the president. He asked if the letter requesting an apology was the personal attitude of the three men who signed it <Van Ost, Courter. Elliott) or that of an administration official. Thomas Elliott then admitted that Mr. Wilford Ketz, coordinator of student activites and advisor to the council, had suggested the writing of the letter. Ketz then revealed that President Davidson had planned to take away the chapel credits for the program that had been found \off color.\ Ketz felt that since the men who came to the chapel had done so in good faith they should not be penalized for the quality of the program.

Dear Editor; My congratulati~:ms .to the Class of '53 for successfully throwing off the yoke of oppressiOn 1mposed by the S.D.C., namely those silly fresh- man caps and pins. LAST YEAR I was often joined by u charact~r whose methods of study were composed of one part actual WOl'k, one part short ·snoozes, and one part moaning that he wasn't going to pass. Usually, after several hours of wailing, he would full to his. knees and pray. ·\Please God,\ he used to say, \let me pa,;s this one and, honest, I promise I'll study for the next one.\ After this, he would go back to the .first as- signment in his text, rip out each page as he read it, crumple it into a ball and toss it into the middle of the floor. Then, when he was ready for the ~xam, ·he used to burn tlw pile in sacrifice. The guy, incidently, went through four years here with that method.

Mr. Jones has been accused of trying to establish autocratic rule in the Mountebanks. Let this be a plea to your readers to read carefully the feature story about him in this issue. As college men we should base our opinions on facts not gossip. Let's give a new man a fair brake ... let's be men not back-stabbing old wives. THE USUAL weekly tea pot tempest has blown up to a full fledged gale, and now just about fills a Halehouse soup dish. The whole thir.g started when Art Kean and a few of his ass·o•ciates put on a chapel program on Monday, Nov. 7, to help out the IFC prom com- mittee. Apparently some people about campus objected to the pro- gram on the basis that it w2s \in bad taste\ and then a letter signed by three members of the student co•uncil protested the cha.pel :program and demanded an apology. At this point, the rumors tee met and wrote the letter which appeared in the Conc.ordiensis last week. For more information, we 1·efer you to the news story about the st?den.t council meeting, and the editorial columns. We maintain the three council members who wrote the letter did not speak for the student body, that at least two of them were not sincere, that they were duped by admin- istration officials to take an action by threat which they would not have taken themselves, and therefore that they represent an administrative point of view and not the stu- dent body's.

At the meeting Tuesday night, members of the council wanted to know what authority the three had. Some felt that the whole council should have approved the action. The time factor would have prevented that taking place but nevertheless what kind of an executive committee is it if it doesn't re- present the views of the members?

Bill Van Ost admitted in council meeting Tuesday night 11e signed the letter only be- cause he was told the choice was: sign the letter or have the chapel point taken away from each student in attendance. That's where they were duped. If they had stopped to think they would have realized that taking a chapel point away from men who went in good faith would jeopardize the whole chapel system. The question would arise each day: do we get credit for going today or do we waste our time (credit is at present the only 1•eason for going to chapel) 'l In other words, by a threat which would have had conse- quences that no administration official would like, the boys were tricked. Received Second Hand Reports Tom Elliott was not even in chapel that day. He got sec- ond-hand reports just as the administration did, yet he signed the letter. The question is this: if people were worried about bad taste why didn't they object to the previous Wednesday's chapel? Why wasn't a letter written then? We feel student council officers have a duty to the student body to express officially only opinions which come from students, and with which the officers sincerely agree. If the officers don't take the initiative; if the ideas expressed by them do not come spontaneously from the student body to them directly (without going through an administrative member first) then the officers should keep their mouths shut.
