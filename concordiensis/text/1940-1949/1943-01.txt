For every $13.75 put up by an·y Union fra- ternity, the Interfraternity Council will add $5.00 to it for the purchase of a wat· bond.

The accelerated g-raduati0n of part of the class of 1943 deprived us of two valued edi- tors; in the recent electim1s we have tried to find sub~titutes to contiime their efforts. ln assuming- the responsibility for this edi- torial space each week, we plan no d1·astic changes of policy and ask for none of the fanfare that usually goes \Vith a chang-e iH editors.

The present staff. ex- cepting the two men who have been grad- uated, is much the same as the one which has been putting the paper out \veekly for several months. We have been trying in that period to make this the kind of newspaper most valuable to a campus at war; we shall miss the help of those who have gone, but we shall continue our efforts in the direc- tions they established.

THESE TWO ARE ESSENTIAL Smith, James E. Smith II, *Daniel Wit. Bachelor of Science-Harding H. There can be no denying that Union Col- lege, as an institution, has done its best to play a constructive part in the wa1· effort thus far. Certainly every effort has been made to comply with the wishes of the fed- eral government, so far as they have been known. The same thing- cannot be said, to such an extent, for the individual efforts of those who comprise the college community. A few have been extremely active, but ali of the students and almost all of the faculty and administmtion staff have found themselves far too entangled in the maze of individual problems connected with the armed forces to pay enough attention to such things as blood donations and the promotion of war stamp sales. a student best serves his country now by re- maining a student as long as possible, until called. But certainly that is not enough. We in college now must justify the deferments that keep us he1·e. We are just as much re- sponsible fot· an all-out war effort as any civilian. That is why the appointment of commit- tees to conduct ddves fo1· blood donation~ and war stamp sales by the President last week cannot be considered \a good idea\ or \a worth while gesture\: these committees, and the successful completion of their drives are absolute essentials, if Union is to con- tinue to go \all-out\ for this war. Little can be said for the value of war stamp sales or donations to the Red Cross blood bank that has not already been said before. The only point that needs emphasis here is that, in the case of the blood dona- tions, students and their parents may be sure that absolutely no harm can come to a donor to the Red Cross blood bank.

The announcements concerning- the status of the reserves made as college closed for the Christmas recess have removed most of the confusion plaguing us at that time. It is defi- nite that most of the students now in college will finish this semester. :Many know that they will remain beyond that time. Now that we know what we are doing, where we are going-, it is time we turned our attention to individual efforts in the war. those who buy blood from \professional\ ·~LJI'w.<--1..\} donors. Beyond this, it should be obvious that both drives demand a maximum of Vaughn Monroe Every intelligent thinker has agreed that support.

Bad passing 'by both teams mar1·ed the earl.y part of the game. A few missed set shots early in the first half apparently discouraged most of the Union cag- eJs from later attempts, as they passed up many opportuRlties for long shots. Both teams used zone defenses, which kept the score down, neither team solving the other's zone to any exteRt. Bob Bartlett, with 13 .points, aad BiH O'Neil, wi-th eight, led the Uaion £coring. They were matched by bapham, Middlebury captain, and Bishop also of Middlebury, with 13, and 8, respectively, See->Saw Battle A foul by Bishop for· Midd'lebury opened the scoring, but Union went quickly into the lead on a basket by Bartlett. Field goals ·by Lapham and Bi:::·ho.p and a foul by McGarry· gave Middlebury a six: to two lead. Two fouls and a field goal by Bill O'Neil tied the game up for Union. Two foul tries by Lapham sent the Panthers into the lead, bHt Clowe quickly tied it up again with a set tihot. A field goal and a foul by Adsit sent Middlebury into the lead aga:in, 11 to eight, ·but with field goals by Baz·tlett and Jones the Garnet forged into the lead. En- singer's field goal and McGarry's foul gave Middlebury a two point lead, with the half drawing near a close. A field goal by O'Neil tied the game up again, and as field goals were matched by Lapham and Bartlett, the half ended in a 16-16 deadlock. At the opening of the eecond half, Bartlett ·put Union in the lead with a J}eld goal, but Middlebury over- came it and went one point ahead on a field goal and a foul by Bishop. Martuscello then made good on two foul shots to send Union ahead 20 to 19, but a hook shot by McGarry g·ave th:e Panthers a lead which was short-lived, as two baskets by Bart- lett, one on a set shot and one on a follow-up, regained the lead for the Dutchmen.

WHAT GIVES TAKE YOUR CHOICE T HE U.S. Army Air Force can test airplane engines at a! titudes of 40,000 feet, where it's 67 below, or at low altitudes over deserts where the temperamre soars to 120 F-without taking the ships from the ground. Testing is done in a laboratory where refrigeration equipment, electric heaters, and air evacuating equipment take over for the elements. One such lab, for which G.E. is build- ing electrical equipment, will house several test chambers, in each of which engines will be tested under different conditions. To accomplish this, air will be partly conditioned and then delivered tO various test chambers. At each test chamber the air will be further conditioned to obtain the exact humidity, temperature, and pressure for the particular condition desired. Then the air will be delivered to the engine carburetors. PIP£ DREAM T HE War Emergency Pipeline, largest oil trunk of its kind in the world, will go into operation in January. Exuending 531 miles from Longview, Texas to Norris City, 1Hinois, the \Big- Inch\ pipeline (so calJed because it is 24 inches in .diameter) will help alleviate the oil shortage in the Ea:st. G.E. JJecently shipped, five weeks ahead of schedule, the .first two of fifteen 1500-hp motors it is building for the line. Built of cast iron to conserve steel plate, the motors will be used to drive centrifugal pumps in booster statioas along the line. These pumps will keep 1,330,000 barrels of oil flowing at a rate of 4 miles per hour-a delivery rate of 300,000 barrels a day at Norris City. By June it is expected that the remain- ing section of the line, 857 miles long, will connect Norris City and the Atlantic seaboard.

The contt\ibution was the proceeds of a collection taken at the Christ- mas Carol Service on December 13, 1942 and amounted to $181.50. The text of the letter follows: \'0 behalf of our Committee, want to thank you for your recent contribution to the World Student Service und and to send you here- with an official receipt. \You undoubtedly !mow that we have tripled our goal for this year -but that the need has more than tripled. In addition to increased numbers of student victims of war in all our old categories, they are now found in various parts of the world never before reached by our China commlttei· and our commit- tee in Europe.· 'Russian students whom we are helping are illustra- tive of a great new group. Student relief needs have begun to strike home more directly too. In addi- tion to the refugee European stud- ents in this country whom the WSSF has always helped, we are now carrying a large responsibility for the American students of Jap- anese ancestory who have been eva- cuated from the west coast and who must be relocated in colleges in unrestricted areas. American prisoners of war 'being held in the Far East of cour&e hold· a prom- in.ent place in our list of beneficia- ries. \Your contributions will help us no end in meeting these needs. You will rejoice with us, I know, in the fine response we are getting from American colleges and universities and from individual friends of high- er education.\ • trusts DIMI WRITES ON STUDENT COUNCil,.

The Council was almost evenly divided on the l!Uestiun of whether its revision should :be referred to a committee for stud,- OI' whether the proposition to disband should imme- diately be set before the student body. A motion .by Edward L. John- son '44A to establish such a com- mittee was finally passed by a vote of 16-11. Ext>cutivps' Recommendation Discussion over the status of the Council began when Chairman GPorge Anderson '43 read the re- port of a meeting of the Executive Committee, recommending that the Council disband and leave the ex- ecutive group to handle \any busi- ness that might come up\. Deme- trius Calogirou '44 immediately ob- jected on the grounds that such action would mean virtual aban- donment of student government. After Frederick Wikoff '43, Ken- neth Sharpe '43, and Edward C. Green '43 had protested the ineffec- tuality ?f the Council and the pre- occupatiOn of its mem•bers with other affaii·s, the motion to refer the question to a group consisting of the Executive Committee and two other members of the Council was set farth. Question of Time As one aftet· another member of the .c~uncil expre>·sed the gen- eral opmwn that the organization as n0w established was worthless and futile, it became apparent that thP only issue would be whether the Council should take steps to- ward immediate disbandment or whether some effort should be made by a committee to attempt to re- vitalize student government in a form somewhat l\imilar to the pres- ent one. After the committee plan had been chosen, Calogirou and John- son were named as the two council- men who will join the Executive Committee in the study of a new constitution. ----o---- Sidney Smith Made Faculty Director Of Mountebanks away.

A huge affair it is with the entertainment in the centre of an cblong bar, a Ia NYawk's Hick- ory House.

Valerie Lee, a blondined pt·etty whose voice was charmingly his the final word to say what the readers read today. Prolmbly the outstanding- feature of stu- dent goYemment at Cnion dming the past four years, and before that, too. for all we know, is that mo.st of the time and effort used on the Student Council has been either in perpetuating it through nominations or elections. or trying: to ehange the sy~tem around. ::\ow the boys are at it again, this time with the most radical suggestion sincl' the class of HJ-13 entered. \The whole system is a waste of time; there's nothing· ,,.e can do: if something should happen the Execu- tive Committee can take care of it: let's go home\ they said at Tuesday's meetiE~\·. ::\ ot a voice was raised in defense of the p1·esent system or the present Council. Few parliamentary bodies in the histoiy of the world can have been .so unanimous in the as- suranet' of their own worth!e~snes,;. l.lut for the olljections of a few men who favored re- \'ising- instead of abandoning: the present machinet·y, the Student Council srstem at L'nion would have been bidden a teal'le:,;s farewell. The trouble with the Student Council :,;ince we have !mown it seems to u::; to have been that its only function was to keep itself g-o- ing. Earlier Councils had g-iwn a\\'ay all their duties and man~· powers; no one came forth with any plans for action. Xothing was forced upon the Council: it looked for nothing to do. It Could There vvere exception~ to thi:,; rule and there might have been many more: that i,; what the pre~ellt Council forgot in its :,;elf- disgu~~t. Forg-ottEn were the stand takl'n o:1 the policy of the admission::; committee to- ward athletes in 19-W-:11: the occa:,;ion on \\·hich a strong student council could have told the administration how to anang·e the Yacations in 19-H-1~. but hesitated until the question was taken to the student body: the recent occasion on which the adn1llll:s1ratwn houn; morr. !!':f.' cnn:pu~ must got its reports on the sentiment of the stu-, lou!;: P< bf:'autiful a> 0ver now with its .b:ank<'t of snow.

Should one of the neutral groups be the winner, their prize will prob- ably be divided into war stamps, to ·be awarded to the members of the group according to their help in the drive.
