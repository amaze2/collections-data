College Requires Houses for Dorms For Navy in Nov. On Wednesday evening of this week, the first meeting of the Inter- fraternity Council was held in Old Chapel for the purpose of electing officers and for a discussion of ct:r- rent fraternity problems. The council elected Charles B. Grimes of Phi Gamma Delta fra- ternity to the office of president over Philip Sottile and Jamie Den- nis, A-S, after two closely fought ballots, while Orin C. HaBsen de- feated John M. Hickey', A-S, and l:>hi!ip Sottile for the secretaryship. Grimes was elected by the flip of a coin after he and Sottile dead- locked the election with six votes apiece. Sottile said, \Tails.\ Mr. Grimes, whose hometown is Hollis, is a pre-medical student, and was recently appointed chairman of the Sophomore Discipline Com- mittee.

Fit·e PTeventioJ\ Week,\ and ''Go to Church \Veek\ are only a few ef the various obsn·vances that clutter our calendUI'. In view uf such a motely assemb- lage, we feel tlutt our own particular sug-- g·estion for a \Pay as You Go Week\ ·wiH 1o10t meet \\'ith too n1uc h opposition. During \Pay as You Go Week,\ the on!~· ritual will be that all students here at L'nion will pay admission to thei·r classes individually, an admission which \vould umount to about one dollar. We sug-gest that the professor m.igh t 'stand outside his classl'Oom door and collect h·om each student as he entered; such a practice \\'CJUlct also facilitate taking attendance. But th-e main pU\'pose behind this ritual would be to impre:os upon the student the teiTific cost of an education. The l'e:mlt, \Ve hope, would be to cause some students who have never done it before, to sit duwu and a::;k then1:selves, \\\'hy am I in colleg·e, and is it worth the money'?\ The money, however, is only a part of the expense, -a mere $5fJ60, which amount in- clude::; tuition, books, and seventy-five dol- lars a month for living expenses, exclusive tJf the four months each year taken up by lhe summer vacation. What is perhaps more important than the money is the time: the four yea1·s that a st l!dent spends in the pro- tected and secluded atmosphere of a college campus are four yetus wasted from the point of view of acquiring experience, and learn- ing life in the real v:odd. Our present mode of education puts the cart befm·e the horse: in· college we learn the g·eneralities first, and after· we g-raduate, we learn the specific instances that sup:po::;edly illustrate these g-eneralities; in colle~·e we leam the theories, and after we graduate, that they do not appl;t.·. The result is that college graduates m.ust either unleam their foolish notions,- usually at the expense of their spiritual de- velopment and their pocketbooks, or they must reconcile the world as it really is to theii' own idea of it, with the result that these inclividuals will forever have H mis- taken notion of what goes on around them.

This n:mrning the world received the news as yet unconfirmed at the time we go to p1·ess that the Japanese Government is will- ing to accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration. According the teletype Press: to the Associated Press over this morning at the Gazette \The Japanese· Domei Agency announced that Japan was l'eady to accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, calling for Tok~·o's Unconditional Surrender, so long as Emperor Hirohito was permitted to retain his prerogatives. \Domei said that the Japanese Govern- ment, acted in obedience to Hirohito who, it was ~aid, 'desires earne::;tly to bl\ing about an eal'ly termination of hostilities.' \ Ben Ayres, Assistant \Vhite House Press Secretmy, said this moming that he had no official information regarding the Jap- anese announcement as relayed by the ,-\s- sociated Press. \The Potsdam Declaration was issued Jul~· 26 by President Tmman, then P1·ime :\Iin- ister Churchill and President Chiang Kai- Shek. Soviet Russia associated herself with the Declaration when she declared war on Japan two days ago. \The declaration telling Japan she must sunender unconditionally or be utterly de- stroyed, was reinforced by President Truman last night in a raclid broadcast to the Amer- ican people. One of the biggest questions to 1·each agreement on is what is to be done with the Japanese Emperor. There is no specific mention made of the Emperor in the Pots- dam Declaration.

In light of the Yale Commit- tee Report on Religion, Union Col- lege might well benefit by this re- 'port and ma:lte plans now to estab- : !ish a separate department of re- ligion. Religion should be sign~ft­ cant on the campus and become an essential factor in the college life at all colleges throughout the na- tion. Last Saturday evening the first ~'AC in- formal dance of the team was held, The at- tendance at this all-campus affair included upwards to the number of fifty couples. It is particularly gratifying to see that student participation-both naval and civi- lian-in college activities still continues at Union. For the most part navy and civilian students at Union have shown their remark- able capacity to work and play together, and above all-what is more important-to keep alive our activities. At Williams College, according to the cam- pus publication of that institution, \The Williams Record,\ of August 1, navy and civilian units failed to cooperate in dance planning. Blame was placed on bungled man- agement and disinterest. This incident is only cited to show what can happen. Let us not follow the way of Williams but rather carry on with fine spirit; so that incoming freshmen and new naval trainees of the com- 1 i-ng November term can be made familiar with it. While the music presented may not have been to the best liking of all the dancers, at least it had tone, was daneeable, and 1 1 ' I p easmg to the ear. Nevertheless there was a place provided, a good orchestra, smooth floor and with dim lights. All this was with- out charge as well. Sincere thanks go to the NAC Commit- tee and to all others who gave so genemusly of their time and effort. According to latest word there is to be another NAC Dance scheduled for August 25. If this date conflicts with any other activ- ity for the evening, will notice to this ef· feet be given immediately to \Okie\' Owens. So come on \ye Union men,\ reserve August 25 for a dance with ;your gal of the evening- and have a grand time! Buy that extra Bond Now!

Brown's bid for the Hall of Fame ~--~------~--~--~~----------------------~------------ In September of 1936 a tall, gangling. youth stepped upon the Union College· campus. Before he was to leave, four years later, he was destined to set the greatest football record ever made by any- vne who has ever worn the Garnet and Gray. He was Sammy Ham- merstorm. football player extraor- dinaJ·y. Higll ~chool Star At Jamestown High School. in the western part of the state., Sammy was a bri!Uant athlete. and a fine scholar. but for the first three yea•I:s of his col,lege career he was just a good player. He made letters in all the sports he tried for and occasi.onally made a writeup in the local papers, but it looked as if .Sam was to be just another good football ·player. But suddenly he started to dick. In the opening game against Haverford the big, blond Swede galloped :for three touchdowns, kicked an extra point and passed for another TD. He ca.rried the ball 22 times and every time he carried he racked up 6.2 yards from the line of scl'immage, as the Gar- net romped to an easy 41-16 win.

Sy1·ett attended Oceanside High School for three years and playE'd football during- hi:< last two. Willie went aut for ri·ght half back but the coach decided to ,play him as right guard on the varsity during his last year. Oceanside has an im- pre::;sive record for that yea.r, win- ning fouv. tieing one. and dropping only four. Oceanside's policy was to play anyone who challenged them. This was in contradiction to the league rules. Accor·dingly, when Oceanside battled it out with Poughkeepsie, they sacrificed their eligibility to compete in the play- offs. Malverne and Long Beach were deadlocked for the Class B champtonship and inte1:estingly enough. Oceanside had downed both of them. Long Beach finally won the hono1·s but had previously succumbed to Oceanside 33-0. Mel- verne had b,qwed to Oceanside 14-13. Syrett was captain of the rifle team during his last year and held the highE'st average of 97 out of a possible 100. The team placed third. competing against all the public schools of Nassau County. Willie also supported the track team, running the half mile.

Upon the completion of this course he was assigned to the Aviator Section of the Navy in New York city where he was classified as a specialist. After a few months in New York he requested a .change of duty and was .subsequently assigned to the classification board at the Naval -Air Station in San Diego, California in March of 1944.

Presence Of Staff Members Imperative! USO Buffet Suppers Every Sunday night groups of Schenectady womeH descend upon the clubrooms of the USO bearing packages filled with appetizing· delicacies, prepared to satisfy the hung-1y servicemen who await this treat. Most of us are inclined to take this generosity fo1· granted, because these weekly ~uppers have become a habit with us. vYe, of the l!nited States Navy V-12 Unit at l.!nion CoUege, owe a deep debt of gratitude to these women, for most of us go to the l.'SO on Sunda~· night to enjoy these delicious treats. The buffet suppers are graciously prepared and se1·ved by the various women's clubs, and fraternal auxiliaries of the City of Schenec- tady. :\Ir. George Regnier, assisted by his staff, contacts these societies, and arranges for a night convenient to the women. These women receive no monebn·y reward for their unselfish endeavors; no fanfare ot· publicity accompanies their service; their only reward is the satisfaction of a job well done, and the contented smiles on the faces of the service- men who have finished the meal. It would be impossible for each Soldier, Sailor, and :\Iarine to personal1y thank each of the women responsible for these fine sup- pers. We therefore wish to publicly express our appreciation to every organization that has so benevolently showered the hospitality, for which Schenectady is so well known, upon the men and \Vomen of the Armed Forces who are stationed in this area. None of us will ever forget the many acts of courtesy, generosit~· and the neighborliness shown to us by the citizens of this great community. The spirit of the fundamental precepts of democracy that has made our countr;; the greatest nation in the world has revealed it- self in the peoples of the Cit~· of Schenectady and of the su!'l'ounding area. WITHIN OUR POWER Gratefully after many days of suspe:u;e and anxious waiting, the world and <tlong with all of l'nion College \Vas overjoyed be- yond words to learn on that memorable August 14 of the unconditional surrende1· of Japan. With the factories whistles gwmg forth their welcome blasts, and with church bells pealing forth joyous tones, some of us rushed downtown to partake in the unrehearsEd fes- tivities there. To many of us ou1· first thought went to Him and we quietly and humbly entered our respective places of wor- ship and gave profound thanks to the Al- might~·; for peace at last was upon the world. For a lot of us the war's eno means that we may never be exposed to the horrid and grim tasks of wa1·. To others of us, the end of the war meant that beloved brothers, fathers, uncles, friends and other acquaint- ances will no long-er be subjected to danger and may soon be on the wa~· home.

Shintoism must go. It must be destroyed unless we are willing to assume the gamble for a survival of a permanent enemy in the Pacific. There must be hard realistic treat- ment for the people and leaders of Japan. llnless we insist upon the complete re- moval of \The Soul of Japan,\ then the Jap- anese people \Viii happily and proudly recall the imperial words of the present en1peror's grandfather that \Japan is the parent nation of the wol'ld. He who is hosble to this na- tion opposes the will of God. The imperial family are parents not only of the Japanese race but of all nations on earth.\ This is pure unadulterated bunk. The Nazis tried their master race creed too. Their signs of power are not more. And so it must be with the Japanese. By our recognition of the emperor with all of his royal prerogatives, we have strengthened the Japanese feeling of supe- riority. There must be a complete liquidation of the military clique that has ruled so long and the probable elimination of the :.\likado as the embodiment of the spirit of Japanese will to conque1· the world. By maintaining a broad policr of unselfish imperialism in the world, by unhesitant par- ticipation in international affairs, and b~· control of necessary Pacific bases, >ve can be sure of victory in the Pacific. This atti- tude necessary for the future safety of America and of a free wol'ld 1·esults from the arrogance of Japan and her unrepentant attitude. GRIPES At the chapel in the past few weeks we have noticed that there seems to be a de- cided lack of coordination among both the civilian and naval student bodies about the exact and right time in which to rise for the speakers. At times the assembled people in chapel represent sectional jack-in-the-boxes. A gl'oup will half rise here and then anothe!' will make a feeble attempt to arise else- where. Everybody is at a loss. This matter is partially our own fault but not entirely so. Let the administration come forth as to just when we should arise. Should it be when the Choir comes in or after or if not either of those two times, should it be when the presiding official appears? Dignity is lacking in our chapel programs. The attendance from the civilian student body especially among the upperclassmen is poor indeed. There is something to be gained from such a weekly meeting even if we don't have a humorous time in attending. Those of us who will be assuming the re- sponsibilities that go with citizenship must see to it that WAR MUST NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN. It is within our power to be con- stant and vigilant guard fo1· any signs of dis- sention and extinguish them before they break out into world wide conflagrations.

They have lost 3 games, one to Art Schmitt's boys and the other two to Neil McAllister's second place C-1 outfit, 10-0, and 2-1. Despite the fact that both the first and second place teams have lost the same number of games, B-2 has been given the nod because they lead in percentages by .013 points. C-1, it is true have beaten the champs twice but the Brewers had a tie game with Lou Zangaris' B-1 team, and shortly after this tie Mel Hein ruled that no tie games were to be played cff, and so these few percentage points have made the world .of difference, B-2 the champs C-1 second place.

Possessor {)f a great arm, Eade caught three runners stealing in in .one contest. Not satisfied with defensive honors alone, he also hit a homer, to cap the most thrilling contest in his memory. On the grid iron Bill played a slashing game at right guard for two seasons, where the experience gained refending that old home plate stood him in good stead. Eade even tried his hand at coaching, albiet it was only a grade school basketball team. One thing I'll wager, though ... that his kids finished on top. Number Two: E. F.

Each manager was asked to pick his choice for the best player at every position and to also include one reserve pitcher·, infielder and outfielder. Each pil0t was also asked to pick his choice aB the best manager of this super squad. Because of the large num- ber of votes that were cast it is only natural that some ties would result. The final decision was based on a scoring system giving one point to each man for each position he was named for, the man with the ·highest points was given the posi- tion. If a man obtained more points than anyone eles for the infield 0r outfield but was outscored for a particular position then he was given the utility role. The Civilian team was picked by an oral vote of each manager fol- lowing this week's Chapel period. In the Navy league Br.own and Cameron were the only unanimous choices each grabbing 6 points, McAllister. Fischer and Schmitt were next with 5 apiece, the latter having his votes spread over 4 dif- fuent positions. Bonk, Zangari and Spicer were next in line with 4 apiece.

Tickets- Philip Sottile. The campus is buzzing with rounds of question asking by in- ttrested persons of those \in the know\ about the type and size of the band. The interest which is be- ing shown is indicative of the de- sire by Union men for these proms held each semester. In the light of the talked up interest, it is highly probable that the Anniversary For- mal wm be as successful, if not more oJ, than any in Union's his- tory during the accelerated pro- gram. Freshmen who seem to be hav- Ing no trouble in getting acquaint- ed with the young ladies in town will have an excellent opportunity to demonstrate their date getting ability at this forthcoming social highlight of campus life. ----•0---- Net Show Follows Old Union Medium The Union College Sesquicenten- nial pl'Ogram on NBC from 7:30 to 8:00 p.m .. Eastern Time, Saturday, September 15, is probably the most pretentious radio project sponsored by this college which was ·founded in 1795. But radio is not a new medium at Union College. In fact, one of the first t·egularly scheduled radio broadcasts in the United States came from Union's campus nearly a quarter of a century ago. For 18 years the Sunday morn- ing church services in Memorial Chapel on the campus have been broadcast by the General Electric radio station WGY. Radio Often Used Dr. Whitaker, former director of the budget for the State of Con- necticut, joined the Uniop faculty in 1939 as professor of economics. A year later he was appointed chairman of the division of social studies. He served as comptroller from 1943 to the beginning of his term as actifig president. Stctly.

Broadcast by WGY, these Sunday afternoon discussions of important state and national is- sues have attracted and held a large audience. A graduatt;l of Colgate University in 1921, he received his master of arts degree from Yale University in 1925 and doctor of philosophy from Yale in 1931. Dr. Whitaker was r·esearch dirt;lctor for two com- missions in Connecticut, a member of the faculty at Yale and a staff consurtant for Brookings Institu- tion in Washington before coming here. ----0---- Dr. Elmer A.

For three years a group of Union College professors has been inter- preting the war and its develop- ments each Sunday night on WSNY. Several other series of Union pro- grams have been conducted during the last decade. Probably Union CoHege has done more in radio than any other small college for men in the country. It is only nat- tural, therefore, that the institution should celebrate its 150th anniver- sary by radio. ----0---- Union Grad of 1921 Decorated by Italy Lt. Col. L. A.

THI<; VEIL 1'HAT HIDES THE DARRNESS UFTEII: (No. 6) This week H gives us g1,eat pleas- ure in introducing to you one of the well !mown men a:bout cam- pus. As u mattet· of fact, he is the originatol' of many a wHd stot·y we have he:u·d emitting from U.C.R:S . This time, however, the tables have been tunte<.l and we a•re act lu~t able to reveal Mr. Edward \X\ TuttlE' Jr. in his true appeat:ance. Mr. Tuttle, the baby-snatchet·, is not content with making acquaint- ances with intelligent and mm'e mature women but, instead, .pushes himself on to the younget· genem- tion. Accol'ding to his own confes- sion, the ba·by-sna.tcher admits he ha~ a twelve yea1· 0ld girl friend but he l'eiterates his only t'eason for knowing her is that she is the only person who bel-ieves EVERY- THING he says. She cer~ainly must be an exceptiona:J.Ir gullible pet·son. Mr. Raymond Aloysius McCoy rerta inly has been living a rugged life during the past few days. One thing after an0ther has occurred to make Mac's life just one prob- lem after another. It all began last Sunday at Lake George where Mr. McCoy had accompanied the U.S.O. on a picnic. One of the host- es~es daringly asked Mac if he didn't want to jitte1·bug but his reply was negative with a decided distaste added. But to add insult to injury, Mr. McCoy happened to heat· the Boy Scouts shouting \Sea Srcuts,\ as the Unit marched along upper State Street Monday night. ~----- This was too much for our salty f·rieml. who was on·ly able to reply with several j'lrofa·ne sentences muttered undet·neath his breath. Om· deepest and sincerest sym- pathies to Aloysius. . E. J. McMalwn has been attrrb- uted with the -latest achievement in p'layi·ng football. In a t·ecent game dul'ing P.T., \Kangaroo-pouch\ Mc- Mahon, exhibited his latest tech- nique in the correct way to catch a football. Now that the Navy has begun d,ischarging a la·rge j'lercentage of its men. Harry Snyder says that he is goi·ng back to his J'!Pe-wa.r job which consisted 0f working for an undertaker-mode'ling coffins. We consider Chuck Kelly and Don Isaacson two of the m0st con- scientious students on campus. As an example, we saw these tw0 eager-beavers crouched over the steps of the C.E. building a few days ago. Knowing thei·r desires for stctdies, we quietly approached to find them both seriously engaged in a stirring game of tick-tack-toe. QUIP O·F THE WEER recently occu.rred in Tom Male's Drawing class. Tom was energetically ex- plaining the intracitics of Descrip- tive Drawing when he stopped to ask the class if they knew what a prism wa:s. Bob Flesher intelli- gently l'eplied, \Oh that's the place whet·e they have bars on the win- dows and keep gangsters, isn't it?\ In finishing the column this week, we would lilte to mention the U.S.O. committee that sponsor- ed the recent picnic at Lake George. Here's hoping that there a•re more soon. FR'IDAY, AUGUST 31, 194'5 The Passing Scene It Is Time to Judge The war in Europe officially end· ed May 8, but it was not concluded on that date. No c0nflict of such tremendous scope, and sacrifice could ever have been fally termin- a-ted by democratic nations without full and complete punishment 0f those who brought the war on this civilization. This week has seen the culmination of many months 0f in- vestigation by trained legal and military officers who have gone in- to the multitude ef facts, and evi- ,dence to draw hlp indictments against these w.ar criminals. 24 persons, a prelim.jnary list, the hier- archy ef Ute Nazi w&r machine, wHl be br0ught to trial in the Nazi shrine city of Nurenberg early in November. The Roll Call of Crime Just what the heil is the matter'? Just why this apparent lack of interest in the stHdent activities on the campus'? We per- smulllY asked a cross section of the student body ~-hy they didn't attend last Saturday's dance, where some excellent dance music was provided free of charge. Some of the replies were: \It wa::<n't adYertised\ \Nobod told me about it\ or \\\'e never even heard about it\. The fault always seems to lie with the sponsoring group. The Conconiiensis gave the dance top billing on its front page. There was an announcement made at the weekly chapel exercises. Station ll.C.R.S. each eve- ning reported on the dance in their broad- casts. And still many people never paid at- tention to this event. sions, and the.ir relative importance in the ..

Rosenberg and Ley, the ideological strategists, we similarly indicted. Master of the Nazi money~ bags, and economic war expert Schacht must acoount for his multi- fel'ious doings. Not even the sacr·ed munition makers have been spared in the accusal, for the head of the mighty Krupp worl•s must also stand before the -bar of world jus- tice, and explain his right to live. 'Ve have found that the .Germans utilized every branch of their oo.on- omy and ·governmental system to wage war on the rest of the world; it is just that these leaders pay for the greatness of their guilt. The AmericaJI Position It's about time that more students in this college woke up to the fact that they are a pal't of this college community and that the,\' have come here for something more than education. To these persons with a \don't care\ attitude, we say that it is their decided interest to find out at least what is g-oing on and participate in whatever extra-curricular activities time \Vill permit. By the looks of things, it will be a long time before we will see anothe1· dance spon- sored by the N.A.C. free of admission charges. Let each man ask himself if he was partial!~· to blame'? For a Common Background In Education Is it not a bit strange, that on a colleg-e campus, where the long 1·ange interests of the enti1·e student body should be the same, there exists such a thing as factional strife·; The strife ·we speak of is not serious: prob- ablv no lives will be lost on account of it; ami yet, this strife reveals a deeply-rooted defect in om· educational system, for it indi- cates that our values are not all the same. The strife itself is good insofar as it stimu- lates thought which might otherwise never come into being, fo1· many college students awaken from their mental slumbers only at the sound of a fray. And yet this strife, which sometimes gives rise to loud!~· articu- lated feelings of superiority and contempt, is not good, for it indicates that not all of our precepts are in harmony. The strife we speak of exists between the students of our different departments, notablv between our engineers and social studies men, who, it seems, nevet· tire of tell- ing bad stories about one anothe1·. Social studies men will claim that no engniee1· can tell the cliff erence between an adjective anct a noun, and engineers will say that no social studies man can add a series of fig- ures totaling to more than ten without tak- ing off his shoes. Good humored though this strife may be, it is nevet'theless an in- dication that our educational system is not doing what it should, for it has not given the student body as a whole the common back- o-round which is necessary if democracy is to function properly, or to enable us to handle competently the forces of nature which our scientists have succeeded in harnessing. The problem is indeed a serious one.

Sesquicentennial Ball Fo1· the last few weeks, plans have been under way for a formal dance to be held 111 the latter part of September or the early part of October. The dance committee has been hard at work and if one can judge by their enthusiastic and confident way of walk- ing about campus, the~· really have some- thing \up their sleeve\ this time. )!any difficulties have presented them- selves to the committee. Everyone is still thinking of the recent war. There is still so much irreg-ularity m these times that it is not easy to arrange a formal dance. For one thing, the student body at union numbers roughly three hundl'ed students now. Unless all the student cooperate, such a formidable undertaking as a first-rate formal dance may encounte1· serious financial difficulties. In peace time, with an enrollment of eight hun- dred. Nevertheless, plans are underwa~· and the signing of a prominent band is expected any day. The committee is doing a wonderful job and if they keep it up and luck is with them, Union will be host to one of the greatest for- mals in its one hundred and fifty years as a college. Everyone's support is a prerequisite, of course. Nobody who can possibly attend should fail t0 do so. The annual autumn formal is an old tradi- tion of Union. This year again, in spite of all obstacles, the tradition will be kept up. In a way it is a symbol, showing that in this one hundred and fiftieth year of -Union's hist01~y, a year marred by the traces of wm, its spirit is as strong as ever.

The year after Bob left, Baltimore competed for the national cham- pionship in footbaH at Miami, Flor- ida, but this time they came out second best. In the tank these Maryland men also excelled, win- ning the state championship for eight consecutive years. Bob at- tributed this to the fact that his school had a 40-yard indoo1· swim- ming pool.
