It is unfortunate that time does not permit lea.gue competition in basketball, but certainly the tournament comes as a welcome surprise to most of us who thought that an~· basl<etbal1 competition was out of the ques- tion. ling toumaments in past years have a!'oused gTeat interest on the part of the participants, the student spectators, and even Schenecta- ciian sports-lovers. Since hours are fewer when the g;rm is available fo1· intramural competition, and the toumaments might take longer than heretofore, it might be wise to announce plans fo1· these competitions, if they can be held, in the neal' future, even if the nctual bouts will not take place until next term, so that prospective participants can prepare themselves adequately.

Dr. Tidmarsh played Borowsky's \Marche Solenelle\ and \Elegy\ for the postlude and offer- tory. Mr. Houghton spoke of prayer as \contact with God.\ He called lJrayer the \most avoided subject in the Christian Church,\ because the Church tends to have a gliilty feeling about prayer, due to its failure to make the effective use it ought to of this instrument. The suggested new evaluation of rrayer is based on the teaching of Christ that the greatest command- ments are to love God and to love 0ne another. These two are in reality one, for loving others is identical with loving God. Conse- tluently, acts of kindness and love to others are as much acts of prayer as is formal praying. \Con- tact with God\ is then the same as contact with fellow men. For \everyday\ use, people who find formal prayer difficult to appre- ciate, may find new value in this different meaning of prayer. It is still true, however, that all of us, in times of crisis, find direct prayer essential, and we should not dis- card it. \/HOTEL\( JY\QHAWI\ The following lettPr to Dr. Har-~·Union men with me including Bill<fbest.

In speak- ing of Dr. McKean shortly after his death in 1927, the Union Alumni Monthly said: \ ... There was that about him which invited confidence. The home of Dr. and Mrs. McKean in North college. be- side the Garden, was a place where the boys liked to go for they knew that they were welcome. And so it became a center of influence-a good influence-felt by many who , have gone out f'rom this cam- pus to make homes of their own ... \ the civilians might occupy one of the center sections. Others sug- gested that all students sit by rlasses, with each Navy man's class bPing determined by the number of terms he has been in col- lege. Another suggested that all the Navy students and the civilian sen- iors sit downstairs; while one member asked why policing would be easier under the proposed plan than under the present anang~­ ment. Civilian police were sug, g;ested af' a counterpart of the pro- posed Navy police. However, num- ~rous objections were found to most suggestions, by both Dr. Fox. and Council membel'S.

She was a member of the congre- gation of First Presbyterian church here, a member of the board of C1Jlby Junior college, New London, N.

Mrs. McKean became ill in August while at New Lond·on and was in a hospital there for a time. She returned home last month. She is survived by three sisters, Mrs. Charles Hoag- la.nd and Mrs. George Braden- burg of Newark, and Mrs. Eugene C. Carder of New York city. Dr. and Mrs. Mc- Kean had no children. Funeral services were held on Wednesday afternoon at 2 o'clock at the Union Coilege Mem.orial chapel, with Dr. Edward Ellery and President Dixon Ryan Fox in charge. 1\idiiiAAW w :~arvey Kayne, '44 Now 1\viation Cadet In Navy After a prolonged discussion, it was agreed by the Council that the present plan should not be chang- ed in order not to create ill will. The Council members pi·omised: to try to persuade the students that it is their duty to remain quiet sa that their neighbors can enjoy the programs. The Council seemed to be of the opinion that the stu- <) ents should be mature enough to realize that the rights of others should be respected, and that if the problem were presented to them in a rational manner, the f'ituation would be greatly im- proved, if not entirely remedied. In response to a query from one member as to the reason for the long, once-weekly assembly, in- :-;tead o.f the shorter, thrice-weekly assemblies of last term, Dr. Fox said that in order to conserve a half hour of light for early classes which, due to wartime year-round daylight saving, had been conduct- ed before sunrise. and to enable Navy men to sleep a half-hom lonO'- er, the new schedule of classes had teen drawn up. He stated at the same time that in March the light situation would no longer be a problem, and that the old sehed,Ile might well be resum0d next se- mester.

THE BELLS ARE RINGING The bells which beg-in and end classes have of late been woefull~· wrong. They ring earlr, usuallr three or mort> minutes before the rig-ht time. The reason is that the clock \\'hich controls them is not a good one. It cannot be replaced now, but it ought to be recognized by the college that there is such a thing as the RlGHT time. This is gen- erallr accepted to be the time as given by the Naval Observatory in Washington. Radio stations keep fairly closely in step with this time. The bells ought to ring at the right time if the college and Navy officials are to con- tinue to demand that students anive at classes on time, particularly the first class in the morning. The present situation is un- fair to the student, \Yho must each day try to outguess the diabolical machinations of the duck in order not to be marked late, and to the instru·ctor, who must either be com- pletely heartless and Hlark late anyone who arrives afte1· the bell has nmg, even if it rings six or seven minutes early, as it has been known to do, or sacrifice that many minutes from his class session if he decides to start his class at the right time and disregard the bell. 'v\le are reasonably sul'e that if the clock were set every day before the first class, it ·would remain fairly accumte for the rest of the day. At present, the clock accnmu- la.tes an error each day which adds up to a considerable time over a period of several days or a week or more. LIB'ERTYl BUFFALO AND JEFFERSON It has been called to our attention, to use a very tl'ite cii·cumlocution, that with the \coke\ and candy machines in all the Navy houses, all swallowing enormous numbers of nickels, the nickel situation on ca·rnpus is desperate. Ordinarily honest and upright students have had to resort to all kinds of subterfuges to get hold of a few nickels. The main sources of supply seem to be the Book- store, the Scuttlebutt, and Hale House. But none of these eve1· have enough to satisfy the demand, and ration their meager supplies as though each nickel were a sirloin steak. The situation is indeed gTave. A naive out- sider who nonchalantly asks a student, \g·ot a nickel?\ is greeted with stares of amaze- ment, enough to suggest that the paddy wagon is already on the way. All of \vhich leads up to the crux of the matter. What is ·to be done'? The answe1· seems simple enough. One of the three places mentioned ought to take upon itself as a patriotic duty the maintaining of a nickel supply adequate to meet all demands. No great effort would be required. The Comp- troller's office could just as easily get more nickels when sending to the bank. We fear that unless something is done, a black mm·ket in nickels, or slugs, awful thought. may develop on campus. Our own estimate of the need is a:bout fifteen hundred nickels a day, or ten thousand a week. A FLAG ON A FLAGPOLE We hesitate to make a suggestion which may seem to be unkind criticism. We do not intend it as such, but as a gentle hint. The flag of the United States of America ought to fly from the flagpole evet·y day except in inclement weather. We have noticed l'ecentl~· that not only has the flag not been flov.-n on some days, especially Sundays, but it has at times been carelessly flown. It would take little effort to secure the f.lag firmly and neatly, as we have had the opportunity to learn firsthand. The problem of having the flag up every day is perhaps harder, but someone ought to be made responsible for seeing- that it is done. In the past, the flag has been rather haphazardly treated b~· the college, but with a Naval unit on campus, it seems as if a little more care might be taken. HIT OR MISS GOVERNMENT We \vish to register a protest against the rather haphazard manner in which the Stu- dent Council is being run this term. short time before. Also, one man is still listed on the roll of the Council and still votes at meetings who is no longer a member. Tuesday night an important meeting was held at which time it was determined how futm·e \Vat'time elections of members should be held. However, several members were absent from that meeting because they had received no notice of its taking place, and the chairman of the committee, the report of which was the meeting's raison d'etre, was present only because he happened to hear someone else talking about the meeting a Probably the principal reason for such mix- ups is the changing secretaryship, which is no\v in the hands of the third man this year. However, merely because there may be reason 1ur sucn difficulties, there is no ex- cuse for the Council's being conducted in such a slovenly manner. If the Council is to be anything other than a burlesque of stu- dent government, it should be managed in a more orderly fashion.

N. WALDRON '06 Colleges. like families, have their ups and downs, and Union ~arne close to disaster in the thirty years following Dr. Nott's death. The cause was Pn untsual combination of mi::>fot tunes. There was, as we have seen, Dr. Nott's failure to organize for changing conditions. His four successors in the pt·esi- dency were unsatisfactory. The trustees shirked their responsibility to such an extent that in 1868 the students publicly expressed thei·r contempt for that body by holding for them a mock funeral, with coffin, procession, and even a tOJnb- stone. But this was not all. The fact lty quarrelled with the president, and the alumni teak sides. A state of civil war existed, which forced President Potter to resign in 1884, and thereby alienated a most influ- ential group of alumni. The faculty and their followers chose one of their own number as preE'ident; and before he, in turn, resigned, the college had almost 1 eached the point of closing its dears. Under the leadership of Andrew Van Vranken Raymond, of the class of 1875, who was elected in 1894, the tide turned; and he, with his sup- porters, laid the foundations of the Union we know today. The period of decline had had its bright spots and plenty of vigor in student life. It was the time when intercollegiate sports. and sttdent activities generally, had their be- ginning. The undergraduates' in- itiative and work gave us our first gymnasium, now a dormitory. These years also saw the inaugur- ation of football. a crew. and the SUlLIVAN'S GRILL Known For Our Hospitality •.• TO .•. UNION MEN Stato St. Near Plaza Theatre choice of our ·College colot·.

However, Harvard was in .the asso- ciation and that was the priority which counted. Our boys gave in and chose garnet; but the hubbub had attracted the attention of Harvard alumni, and their old oars- men pointed out that the first color displayed was crimson, this being the hue of the large handkerchiefs which the members of their first crew had bought to tie about their , heads for their first boat race with Yale. Tht s the much-fought-fot magenta was discarded by both the disputants. So Union boys wore garnet in their first intercollegiate boat race, 1875, and their track team wore the same color at the first meeting of the I.C.A.A.A.A., which, in those days. were both held at Saratoga Springs.

The subject of last week'>' Town I\'[eet!ng was the work of local and state government in post-war ·em- ployment and producthm. The 1 spea·kers were Dr. George Robin-· son and Mr. Brevard Crihfield. Dr. Robinson, the director of the Bureau o'f Planning of the N. Y. State Department of .Commerce, spoke of the work being d'Dne by the .state authorities. The machin-: ery has been set up to absorb the I men and women of the armed forces back into .peace time occu- pations. The con version of factories back to peace time production has also been investi-gated by a com- mittee for economic development. Mr. Crihfield, directcr of the Schenectady Bureau of Municipal Research, presented the work be- ing done by local authorities. He stated that after the war we mt st not go back to the thematically prosperous status of 1939. The Bu· reau is helping in this wor!{ by .planning <>. market to buy an the produce of the area under its in· vestigatioB. He ended by flaying that industry could f.ind j~bs by it- self if it started priming now. Last week in this c·olumn, we said that the Red Rooster was won by South College, and that the Litt.Je Red Hen was captut·ed by the Chi Psi ship. We unfortunately mixed our sig- na·ls, and hereby offer a:ll kinds of apologies to the offended parties. Company B seems to have taken the chicken family under its protection. Psi Upsilon took the Rooster last Saturday, and the rest of the campus wondered how to break up the monopoly.

N. J. The Dutchmen will be gun- ning for their third win of the current campaign, having taken only two of their first six starts. Jess Perkins, Union mentor, ex- pects to start the same quintet which began the Rochester fray; Rive! and Stegeman at guards, Haas at the pivot spot, and Schwartz and Passineau or Salmon at forwards.

He Jed the Garnet cagers in the Roch- ester game in the \total points\ column, piling up a total of thir- teen markers. The presence of Jim Salmon dur- ing the Rochester game was sorely missed by the Garnet quintet, who seemed to lack the ability to swish those tough ones from the corners. Salmon, will probably see action in the Stevens Tech match, however. Turning on a final burst of speed in the closing minutes of a tilt with the Garnet last Wednesday night i nthe Alumni Gymnasium, the University of Rochester came through after· a nip~and-tuck chas(! throughout the third quarter to down the Dutchmen, 47-42.

THE ORGANIZATION OF UNITY At the basketball game last Saturday an incident took place which should not have happened. The Radio Society, lending a help- ing hand as usual, installed a loudspeaker system for making announcements. Dming- the intermission at the half, the system was used to play 1·ecorclings of colleg-e songs. The motive was excellent. but since when has it eve1· been necessary to resot·t to synthetic renditions of the college songs on the cam- pus'! lt is a sad day when the students of the college do not care enoug-h to sing the college songs and give the college cheers at a basketball game with one of our oldest J\ivals. This was not an isolated incident. It was one of a series of events which have shown how seriously lacking· is a real pride in the college. Two reasons fo1· the lack are the tempo1·~:u·y destruction of the fratemity sys- tem, which was the backbone of college life, and the destruction of the class system, which gave the st1·ucture a sensi.lJ!e organi- zation. The failure of both of these systems to operate has left the college without any rallying point fo1· unity. The inhabitants of \Devil's [sland\ are pet·- haps the most unfortunate victims of the altered conditions of om· life. They live, eat, and work at the college, but with a few ex- ceptions they are no more a part of the col- lege than if they were attending Nott Ter- race. They are truly a neglected and friend- less lot. No group of the men who have been to college before has made any effort to orient these men in the wars of college life, o1· to bring them into the social life of the rest of the college, such as it is. The results have been seen in aca-demic ways as well as othenvise. The loss of coliege spil'it is more than a loss of the \mh-nth\ attitude. lt is a serious lack of morale, which is one of the prime es- sentials of the learning process in college. No instructor enjoys teaching a class which is present in bod~' only, and which takes to in- struction only in a sullen way. Our own sug-gestions for improving the situation are pe1·haps inadequate, but at least they are a start. 1. Resto1·e the class system, which is the fundamental stniCture of all education on a higher level, whether in civilian colleges or the military institutions, West Point and An- napolis. 2. Let the Student Council throw off its self-aggrandizing political leadership and as- sert its right to seek the welfare of the students. 3. Let the Student Council, or anyone else who has the initiative undertake to set up social life on a large scale-dances every week, just plain parties, community sings, bridge games, even poker games, if you will. 1. Let the College recognize that the larg- est group of its students are more than \trainees\, they are individual students, who need a no1·mal social life, which cannot be provided ap1trt from the college if the college is to be any more than a factory. ii. We would advise complete revision of both the weeldy (or tri-weekly) and Sunday assembly plans. Now is the time for vigor- ous, courageous action, not the dilettante conservatism whi<:h plagues the Administra- tion at p1·esent. The problem is not a newly arrived one. 1t has been with us for many months. The Student Council has merely deplored it, when it has noticed the difficulty at all. The Col- lege Administration has tried to suppress its manifestations, as for example, the strife which became apparent in these columns last term, without even being aware of the real seat of the trouble. The civilian students have grumbled a little, but having been less affected, have simply withdrawn a little more into their shell. The Navy students have hardly been aware of what has been happening to them or, rather, of what has not been happening to them. The faculty have noticed it as it affects the morale of theil· classes, but few have thought to try to do anything about it. The sum total of all this is: The morale of a group which should be a cocky, hig-h- spirited unit, is lower than a snake's foot. The whole life of the college has suffered as a result. No one has done any- thing about it, and it's about time some- one did. God, preserve us from people who are afraid to t1·y something new! The fact that no other college has been able to solve the problem should not prevent Union from making the attempt.

Also, he did much to heal the rift which the Noted P-hysician Added to Staff of Medical College Potter feud had made arr.ono; alumni. It was in 1S01 that another stal- wat't alumnus who both loved and had faith in his college took an office which, in his hands, became the chief source of our physical rehabilitation. This was Frank Bailey '85. From that date to the present time he has been treasurer of Union College. He insisted that we live on our income, no matter what the pinch; and except for one year during the first World War. the College has been run without a deficit. No alumnus has ever given Union as much as he in ac- tual dollars, but his greatest gift has been the management of our finances and his insistence that it is teachers and not buildings that make a good college. His skillful Dr. S. Eugene Banara has been appointed professor of Neurology and Psychiatry in the Albany Medical College and Nemologist and Psychiatrist-in-Chief of the Albany Hospital. This announce- ment is made by Dean R. S. Cun- ningham of the Albany Medical College and by Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox:, Chancellor of Union Univers- ity. Dr. Barrara was horn in New York City in 1900 and educated at Columbia College and the College of Physiciams and Surgeans, where he received his degree of M. D. He was an interne at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal and in 1930 was appointed to the staff of the New York Psychiatric In- stitute and the teaching staff of the College of Physicians and Surgeons. He served also on the clerical staff of the New York Post-Graduate investments brought in profits on School and Hospital. and up to the! securit:es which not only built up time of his Albany appointment was· college funds but provided sur- executive officer of the Post-grad- pluses to be used for improvements uate course in Neurology and Psy- He was a perfect man for the task chiatry, College of Physicians and and he, more than any president Surgeons.

Although there is no doubt about the team's abiHty, it can never be a consistent winner un- less it gets an ample share of \breaks\, and so fa1· the \breaks\ have been going the wrong way despite the prodigi1ms efforts of al! its members. It seems that every time we have victJry within our grasp, some unforeseen catastrophe manages to upset the applecart. In the thriller with R.P I , Union was ahead by four points at the half, and with Salmon in excellent form, it locked as if we were ac- tuaJ.Jy going to score an upset. In fact, the grandstand coaches who lrnew nath-ing about the two teams before the game mistooh Union for the favorite, instead of the high- ly-touted Teehmen. Then, as the second half began, the \breaks\ went against us in full speed. Without warning, Salmon dropped to the deck as his ankle gave way under nim. Schwa1tz was put out en personals. Stegeman began miss- ing shots as his stomach, which had been upset all day, literally cramped his style of play, Things started to pop. It was R P.L shoot- ing and making impossible shots off their ears. From then on Union fought a lost cause. Not even the little ball-of-fire, Brud Passineat. could prevent R.P.l.'s unstoppable attack. Yes, we lost ... but only because the breaks were against us, not because we were the in- ferior team. Wednesday night against Roch- ester, it was the same old story but this time we started the game with a swinging strike against us. \Fish\ Salmon's ankle did not heal well enough to permit him to play, so we had to do without his dead- eye shooting which has already scored seventy-eight points in fiv~ games. Well, as the game got under way, it was apparent that Union was a determined, inspired outfit. As the score began to roll up in om· favor, the Rochester reputation of being one of the best teams in the East was forgotten. Schwartz was out of this world. He did everything imaginable; he even drew enough fouls to put two Rochester men out of the game. \Rebel\ Rive!, a V-5 making his debut wth our Var- sity did splendidly as he pivoted thirteen points into the hoop. At the half we were ahead 30-24, a sc-ore which alone was a tribute to the Union spirit. But the \second You!' Favoritl' Newspaper Ahvays on Hand CARL'S NEWS Quality Tobaccos 114 Jay St. Patronize Concordia Advertisers In Schenectady It's for ~ Shirts half jinx:\ reared its ugly head aga-in. Schwartz was stopped, sub- >titutions weakened the team, Pas- sinea.u couldn't brea·k away, and Rochester got terrifically torrid. To say tha.t Union fought as well ?.s could be expected is an wnder- statement; you just ha.d to be there to get the rea·! pi_cture. Men who ;>lay without true spirit do not c1urt!e theii· bodies across the court 0r grapple with two-hundred pounders ta g~in possession of the ball. The players did that-and more. We can he right proud of om· basketball team, a team that plays in spite of the breaks, a team that will put up a fight no ma·tter what the odds are against it. There is stilJ anothe1· quality 'l.bout our cngers that adds to their laurels, and that qua-lity is sports- manship. Usually sportsmanship goes on unnoticed unless a Jack of it prevails. Probably the best recognition of Union's ability to play the game right, is the letter that Hal Wittner received from Captain H. A. Badt, Commandant of the Sampson Naval Trainin\' Statio~. Ca-ptains do not usuall~ take t1me out to write \thank you\ notes, which means that the fJI- lowing letter is a tribute to the team members who are upholding the good name of Union College.

This treatment employs the application of hot damp packs to the patient to relieve pain and reduce muscular spasms, and the washer provides an improved way of heating and wringing the heavy woolen cloths used. In the bottom of the tub, which does not have an agitator is a Calrod immersion heating unit that can bring the wate; to a boiling point, permitting the use of the machine for contagious cases. The wringer has been speeded up and its pressure in- creased to 700 pounds-thus wringing the packs so dry that, even though heated to 180 degrees, they can be ap- plied to a child's skin without causing burns.

SCHENECTADY, :N.Y., FRiDAY, JANUARY 28, 1944 LETTER TO STUDENT BODY To the Student Body: There have been elections in which ballot..:box stuffing has ·case doubts as to the fairness of the results. In the poll to determine student p1·efe1·ence for next term's schedule, there was a different kind of defection. As many of you noticed, not all students received ballot blanks. However, the totals indicate that a lm·ge majority of you are in favm of the present plan with its attendant Wednesday afternoon chapel period. Since the vote was so conclusive it seems useless to hold another referendum on the ques- tion. However, if a petition req11esting it is presented with the signatures of one-fifth of the student body, another ballot will be taken. I wish to extend my apologies to those who were un- able to vote, and also to apologize t0 you all for my mis- management in this affair. Alibis and excuses are not suf- ficient to expunge my failure to insure the right to vote to all citizens of Union's student body. Good student gov- ermnent requires an interested student body which is given a fair opportmdty to exp1·ess its preferences by direct vote o1· through the agency of its elected representatives. While in this instance the result was not affected by my failure, it is necessary that future votes be carefully taken and that fuhn·e planners p1·ofit by my errors. The method of dis- tribution was planned to prevent illegal balloting, but suc- ceeded in failing to provide for legal votes which should have been cast.

Recently the program had been carried .by stations WHN, in New York, and WOL, in Washington, D.C., in addition to WGY.

Many of the best-sellers of the past few years have been reviewed on the program. The author to be subjected to the critics' wrath on the \Speaking of Books\ program in the Old Chapel tonight is James T. Farrell. He has just written a book en- titled \My Days of Anger\ which will be the subject of discussion on this week's program.

Before the war, he was a newepaper man and playwright, having just received a contract to write motion pictut·es when he was called to the colors. A thirty year old son of a news writer who gave his life in the first world war, Stradley left college to support his family in 1935, and has had many varied experiences since. Mr. Stradley expects- to answer the question \What will they be like when they come home?\ in a manner deeigned to display the reality of the situation. ----0,---- Sunday Chapel The Right Rev.

Whitaker, Professor of ·Economics at Union College, formerly of the Yale faculty and director of the budget of the State of Connecticut, on the s~;bject: \Can Industry Take Care of Post- war Employment?\ This program can be heard over WGY. The pub- lic is invited to attend and question the speakers. ---o--- War Prisoners Get Books The Rev. Herbert R. Houghton, Jr., college chaplain, has announced that the book collection for student prisoners of war will begin at Union next week. He asks that all stu- dents who have tooks to donate leave them at the college library be- fore February 5. The following types of books are needed: sV:ndard worl{s in English litemture. standard detective stor- ies, language books and grammars, and books on professional subjects. Books with military significance, advanced technical books, European histories since 1914, magazines, and newspapers can not be sent. All pencil and ink markings musl be removed, as well as any labels, stickers. and inked or perforated stampings. Refreshments Also Served A new chapter in entertainment history at Union College will be i written this evening as the fi-lst I V-12 Smoker makes its debut. The 1 affair wiH be held in the Alumni Gymnasilm and will begin at 1900, after evening chow. The program for the evening in- cludes many interesting events. All V-12 tr?-inees at the college are in- vited tb attend, and the members of the college faculty and admin- istration and officers of the Naval units have been invited. The main features of the evening will be four boxing bouts, one of five rounds and three of three 10unds each. They will be held be- tween professional boxers, import- ed for the purpose. Ed. Fitz is ex- pected to act as referee for the bouts>, and the judges and time- keeper will be selected from the members of the Physical Education Department of the college. Music by V -12 Swing Band Another attraction will be the V-12 swing band, which will render up-to-date tunes in the approved modern style. It will be accompan- ied by several vocalists, whose names have not yet been an- nounced. Refreshments will be served through the good offices of the wives of the faculty and officers. To forestall anyone who may con- sider mere refreshments as ·beneath him, there will be a pie-eating con- test to sate the appetites of gour- mands. Mr. South will provide the consumable supplies for the con- test. Lest anyone think that the title of the affair is a misnomer, there will be an ample supply of smokes on hand to keep everyone happy. The master of ceremonies for the evening will be Professor Walter C. Langsam. of the Field of History. ---01--- Usual Quota of V-12 Men Arriving Marc:h 1 Despite sct:ttlebutt that the V-12 program is to be discontinued the Naval Training Unit at Union will 1 eeeive its full quota of men March 1 when the new term begins . It was suggested in Congress that the elimination of the ASTP and V-12 college training units, by eliminating financial support, would possibly save many pre~Pearl Harbor fathers from the draft. Nothing has been done on the sug- gestion as yet. If appropriations were stopped it is pointed out that the programs would probably continue to the July 1 after the law was passed as Congress appropriates money on the :basis of the fiscal year. ---0•--- Resolutions Adopted At a meeting of the Association of Colleges and Universities of New York State last week in New York City, President Dixon Ryan Fox was chairman of the commit- tee on resolutions. The main work of the meeting was to consider pro- posals for post-wat• education. The Association adopted two reso- lutions dealing with the plan sug- gested by the Board of Regents. It endorsed the plan for increasing the amount of state scholarships to $350 per year, in order to keep up with the rising cost of coll'ege edu- cations, and for increasing the num- ber of such scholarships from about 75() to 12000 in each year. Another part of the plan endorsed by the Association would set up about twenty vocational institutions in the state. The resolution had certain reservations about this plan. how- ever. It condemned the suggestion to set up s•pecialized institutes, on the grounds that they would tend to become too much lilre colleges, with dormitory systems. etc., where- as the purpose of the institutes would -be to offer training to peo- ple not suited for regular college education.

YOU CAN HELP Next week a book collection drive will be- gin, under the direction of Herb Houghton. the college chaplain, during which students are requested to donate ce1'tain types of uooks for the use of student prisoners of war. Book collection drives at Union College have in the past, in our opinion, been much less successful than they should have been. We feel that it is little to ask an~·one to give a generous share of the books which lie on his bookshelves gathering dust. :\lost college students wish to save a large numbe1· of their texts, out ver~· few of them ever read them after the course is finished, except fo1· tho;,c in certain technical courses where the bookf' 1 , are used as 1 eferences. Also many low and· medium-priced novels of various sorts are 1 purchased b~· students which are read once ' and then forgotten. Since there is a need for books to send t-o students who are less fortunate than we, who cannot go to the nem·ests liurary or bookstore to get what- ever tome he desires to peruse, is it not just tl,at we should give all those bookr:: which we are not absolutely certain to want· in the future for such a worth~· purpose'?
