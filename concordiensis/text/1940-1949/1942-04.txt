The eleven o'clock serv- ice will include the following se- lections: Election to Be Held Next Week; To Provide for Summer Nominations of the men who will comprise the popularly-elected bloc in next year's Student Council were made by the present Council Wednesday evening. The Council also made provisions for student government during the summer term, and President Abraham Dorsman announced that election of class officers would take place next week. Election of the men nominated will take place during the Friday Daily Assembly program next week. Both fraternity and neutral repre- sentatives-at-large were nominated. Nominations for officers of the various classes will take place next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, ac- cording to the announcement by Dorsman. The Class of 1945 will hold its nominations at 10 o'clock on Monday morning, while the other two classes w·ill meet at one o'clock on the next two days, 1944 on Tuesday and 1945 on Wednes- day. Actual election of the men nominated will be held on Thurs- day of next week. Upon the motion of Joseph Fur- long, '42, the council voted unani- mously to approve the suggestion of the council's executive commit- tee as to the procedure to be fol- lowed during the summer months.

Buurtl-LtJon J a co IJ:;un, J erume Weill· 'AND THE STONE WAS ROLLED AWAY-· \And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they came unto the s~pul­ chre at the rising of the sun. \And they said among themselves, Who shall roll u·s away the s.one from the door o.f the sepulchre? \And whm the·y looke-d, they saw that f.·he stone was ralled away, for it was very great. \And entt:r·ing into the sepulchre, they saw a young mcm s,itting on the right side, clothed in a Ic.ng white grament; and they were af.frighted. \And he saith unto them, Be not affright· ed: ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here; behold the place where they laid him.\ Fo1· untold centuries man has looked to the EastL'r season as the ~piritual symuol of the natural phenomenon we call Spring. He has found, in the course of the pass- ing of late winter, that the entire worlrl. shortly after the sun \crosses the line\ on its way northwarrl, begins to awaken from its slumber through the bleakness of the p1·eceding months. And he has found that at thi~ time more than at any othe1· time in the whole year, it is easier fol' him to awaken himself, ph,vsica!ly, mentally, spirit- ually. He has taken stock of himself, his ideals, his faith. his whole geneml outlook on this strange arl\'entm·e we ca.!! Life. .;\lore than this, he has reaffirmed his faith in himself, in mankind, and in his God. And he has felt better al>out it all. This year, more than ever before, is just that kind of spiritual reconditioning neces- sary. It is the time for all of tls to ex~mine our faiths and om· ideals, and to reaffirm these faiths and ideals. These are times when men are beginning to see that they 1I1Ust fight and die fol\ what they believe. An American playwright once wrote words to the effect that \a man must die for what he believes-if he is unfortunate enough to ha \'e to face it during his generation-for if he fails, he ceases to believe in anything, which is worse than death.\ Sooner Ol' later, a great majority of us here at Union will he called upon to fight and to die for our belief in our way of life. When ~'OU look at relig-ion this way, it seems to iose the names it has been called, \escapism\, and the like, and takes on the appearance of something that may be the final bulwark of America at war. How About You? The Good Friday service this evemng and the Easter sel'Vice on Sunday morning in Memorial Chapel, to be sure, aren't abso- lutely necessary elements in anyone's reli- gious experience. But there they are, for anyone to take advantage of who is so in- clined, standing as reassurances that the an- cient story told by Luke has not been for- gotten, symbols of an experience that can belong to anyone. SCHOLARSHIPS The announcement. eal'ly this week, that the college would make scholarships avail- able as usual for the summer term, came as a welcome note to many of Cnion's draft- pr(lsserl stud(lnts, who until then, had given mol'P than one ner\·ous thought to the finan- cial problem \vhich was to confront them in taking the summer course. To some who, with typical collegiate cynicism, regarded it as .i ust another desperate move to \save face\ in the sumnwr school venture, it made little impression. That both these opinions existed, there is no rloubt. The fallaciousness of' the latter opinion is pointed out in a let- ter from President Fox which is printed elsewhere on this page. The letter does more than to explain the why and wherefore behind the trustees' latest move. It puts a definite eud to the theory that the summer session has not really been taken advantag·e of by enough students to make the whole tremendous ef- fort by the college wor·thwhile. ate that the War Time Commission has been so encumbered by the \democratic pro- cesses\ as to force the colleges to volunteer to carry the weight of the problem. It would seem that now the government's responsi- bility in the matter is clear-cut. And the newiy-developed V -1 plan is fairly good evidence that the government will eventually \do something\. It realizes, we feel sUl'e, the plight of the colleges, as well as the value of college men as office1·s. The \·-1 plan will \earmark\ about one-third of the freshmen entering American colleges in the fall for ultimate dutv as officers. In do- • I ing so, it will necessarily have to stand in · back of the colleges, if they are to continue to tum out officers for Uncle Sam. vVhatever happens, let it was not the colleges \went out on the limb\ other ·ways, to co-operate sil>le with Washington. us remembel' that who delayed, but financially and in in eve1·y way pos- To the Editor of The Concord·iensis: Sir: YOU!' statement in Tue:;day's pa- per was correct as to the action taken by the Trustees in permit- ting scholarships to run <luring the summer term of 1942. But the re- ported student interpretation of their motive was quite wrong. It was not a despera-te expedient to save the s1,1mmer tet·m, as the sum- me.r term ha:d adequate support at the start and the awa1•u of schol- arships is anything but a rPVPRUP- producing device for the College.

The problem besetting the coaches is that of getting sufficient reserve power of a sufficient caJ.i- her to make it possible to replace fit•st string men without greatly re- ducing the strength of .the first team, besides., of course, lowering the quality of performance in both attack and defense. Baseball Nine Shaping Up Well The weather man has put a monkey wrench in Art Lawrence's plans for baseball practice. Last Friday the nine went outside for the first time, and it held a long practice on Saturday on Alexandet· Field. This week coldness and rain have pt·evented the diamond squad from holding many practice ses- sions, but a long drill was held yes- terday afternoon. On the off days nothing much can be done in the brym, .for the difference between practicing there and outside is great and is of no particular bene- fit to the team now that sessions have already been held on Alexan- der Field. Pepper games are play- ed indoors, but a good portion of the time is spent in picking the ball out of .the nets in the gym. The muddiness of the field has hindered any good work for the outfielders in chasing fiies, and the squad had to practice on the lower part of the field yesterday. Batting practice, infield dri11, and shagging flys 0ccupy the time of the team.

The questionnaire will be sent by local boards at first only to those men who made the third registration. Later it will be sent to the men who made the first and second registrations and to all future registrants. When the data is obtained it will be forwarded through the state directo1·s of selec- tive service for use by the National Roster of Scientific and Specialized Personnel in lo- cating persons with professional or scientific backgrounds. It will also be used by the U. S. Employment Service to locate workmen with special skills in critical trades. This questionnaire has no connection with the regular questionnaire form 40 sent to all selective service registrants to obtain information on which classification for possible militat'Y service is based. The new form will not be sent to men already in military ser- vice. The questionnaire is presented here for study, and to assist those who will fill in the regular forms later on.

Hitherto conducted by the Interfraternity Council, the contemplated song contest this year is being planned by Edward Schulze, '42, a co-leader of the Glee Club. As yet, plans are indefinite, since Schulze does not yet know just how many fraternities will enter the competition. The Interfrater- nity Song Cup, which goes to the winner of the competition, will be offered again this year, Schulze said. Houses wishing to enter the Sing this year are urged to get in touch with Schulze as soon as possible, since there are but three weeks remaining in which to complete the venture.

For tonight Union is at last co-ed. -----------------<!)• Tonight, under the benignly ap- 1 proving countenances of adminis- trative and academic leaders of the college, dainty feet .trip lightly in pulsating rhythm across the time Require Payment Of All Seniors In 'Garnet' Case New Publications Staffs Also Elected at Meeting Of Publications Board In its last meeting of the year last Wednesday, the Publications Board voted to require seniors to pay the now-famous \Garnet\ sit- ting fee, elected next year's editors to the Garnet, the Idol and the Freshman Record and named next year's senior business staff of The Concordiensis. The Board's vote was taken after a committee to which the \Garnet\ situation had been referred, had, in turn, referred it back to the Board with a \no verdict\ opinion. By the Board's vote of last Wed- nesday, all seniors who had their pictures taken for the yearbook and who have not yet paid the one dollar sitting fee will be required by the college administration to do so before graduation. David Rosenblum, '43, and H. Melville Messenger, '43, were elect- ed Business Manager and Assistant Business Manager, respectively, of The Concordiensis for the ,Year 1942-43. Rosenblum, a member of Kappa Nu, comes from Newburgh, and, in addition to his Concordien- sis duties during this year, ha.s served as Business Manager of The Garnet. Messenger, next year's manager of football, is chairman of the Junior Prom Committee, was instrumental in inaugurating last winter's intramural debating program, and is. a member of Sgima Chi fraternity. His duties next year will be principall>· directed toward circulation. Thomas Hanigan, '44, of Sche- nectady, was named successor to Arthur LeRoy, '43, as editor of The Garnet, while Harding Brown, '44, was elected Business Manager of the same publication. Hanigan, a member of Psi Upsilon, has (Continued on. Page 2) honored floors of Alumni Gvmnas- ium. Here, where less than a week ago, men fought ·bitterly for the right to be champions, and blood and blows filled the air with pas- sion, now reign the arched eye- .brow, th.c sparkling smile, the po- lite pater of gay humor. Now, and may we say it's a:bout time, the fair sex has at la.st rear- ed its lovely head, and, egad, it's J.unior Prom! What with Charlie Spivak in one corner and soft drinks in another, and women all over the place, E!iphalet Nott would ha·rdly know the place. From the close harmon- ies of the Stardusters to the lov- able harmony of feminine voices, Alumni Gymnasium sounds more pleasantly to the ear than it has since the fall of Buffalo some weeks ago. So Prom is here, and Union has again set out to dance more, laugh more, play more, and stay awake more than it has for many a month. Earlier this evening, the Mounte- banks cocked an ear to old Erin, and extracted assorted chuckles, belly-laughs and guffaws from an audience of Prom\goers. Ten o'clock brought Union its first close-up view of Charlie Spivak, who follows capably in the train of such illustrious maestros as Russ Morgan, Glenn Miller and Benny Goodman. Charlie, whose band is called \the fastest rising band in the country\ seems well on his way to adding another suc- cess to his record. Ten-thirty brought Union's dance to all the great Northeast, as WGY broadcast a half-hour of Spivak swing. Throughout the course of the evening, a young man who is, by now, beginning to feel lilte Santa Claus in Tiffany's, has been distrib- uting favors to all who would ven- ture to the running track upstairs and exhibit some portion of their Prom ticket, or reasonable fa<J- simile of winning smile. College juniors and seniors and young college graduates who wish to obtain commissions as Ensigns, U. S. Naval Reserve, through the V-7 training program, must act without delay, it is announced by Lieutenant Commander W. Pratt Thomas, USNR. senior member of the V·7 Selection Board, Third Naval District. A Bit of Old Erin In Hanna Hall Tomorrow morning, be-tuxed and be-tailed young men will follow milkmen to dormitory rooms and the homes of friends, where, pack- ed like the wilted flowers in their dates' corsages, they will sleep. But enthusiastically. Lieutenant Commander Thomas pointed out that the present V-7 program will end on May 1, and thereafter no candidates for that class will be considered except those who have enrolled in the Naval Reserve V-1 program as col- lege freshmen or sophomores. For the remainder of this month, college ,graduates and members of the junior and senior classes who are native-born, unmall'ied, male citizens of the United States not less than 19 and under 28 years of age may apply for enlistment in Class V-7. Candidates should apply in person at the Office of Naval Officer Procurement, 33 Pine Street. Those who are accepted will be enlisted as apprentice sea- men, and when they have success-, fully completed four months of I specialized training, will receive theh· commissions ·as Ensigns, j USNR. Bright and early Saturday after- noon, the couples will be re-united, s~me to picnic in the chill spring au·, others to watch Union's la- crosse victory. Saturday night will find seven- teen fraternity dances, each minute replicas of tonight's affair. And Sunday will find 600 sleepy people. In fact, 600 damned sleepy people. ---0•---- String Quartet to Appear With Tidmarsh on Sunday The Schenectady String Quartet will assist Dr. Eimer A.

The ordinary grind of hour cx<t.lm;, term paper::;, and lectures which constitute the pur:;:;uit of knowledge is intenupted occa- sionally in order that the fatigued students may relax. This weekend is dedicated b~· unanimous agreement to that pursuit. So it is that Cnion College welcomes you, the apples of our eyes. to this pm·ticular \high point\ in this particular college yea.t'. \\'e have been prepar.ing for this event for ::-;ume time now, and we have dedicated om·- selve.s to the firm resolve to make this week- end the best that we, or· you, have eve1· seen. This J uniur P1·um is rather unlike any of the others that have come and gone during our college experience. There is a spirit pres- ent which has not existed before, symbol- ized, in a way, by the red. white and blue decorations of Alumni Gymnasium. The chill of war finds its counterpart in the chill of a Pt·om-night v;hich falls this year a full month ahead of its normal place in the cal- endar. The p1·esence of patriotic sacrifice is felt, too, in the absence of corsag-es and the visible evidence of financial support to a cause involving the armed forces of the na- tion.

Ander·son received 233 votes and Macomber, his neutral oppon- ent, .got 135. This morning's balloting clim- axed three consecutive days of vot- ing, during which time the number of candidates was cut from seven on Wednesday to three on Thurs- day and, finally, two today. Voting in Union's first popular I ~lection. for the Student Body pres- Idency m many years began a day ahead of schedule, Two Daily As- 1 sembly periods had been set aside for campaign speeches, but, since 1 all seven of the eligible men re- . fused to deliver talks, Abraham I Dorsman, '42, present president of the student body, read each man's record and asked him to stand be- l fore the audience on Tuesday and balloting began on Wednesda~. No Speeches Gil''len Although this absence of cam- paign speeches was in direct viola- tion of the student body constitu- tion amendment passed this winter no action had been taken to rectify this situation by one o'clock today. . In the voting on Wednesday 1 Richard Hoffman, Phi Sigm;_ Kappa, received 41 votes; George Weed, Delta Phi, got 14 votes· Fred Wikoff, Chi Psi, received· 5S votes; Anderson received 115 votes· Bodenstab and Duford neutrals' received 26 and 23 votes 'respective~ ly, and Macomber got 53 votes. Under the terms of the constitu- tional amendment, the lowest four men were eliminated, since no one had received the required simple majority. On Thursday, Anderson was gi':'en 154 votes, Macomber 98, and W1koff 77. Anderson missed elec- tion on this ballot by 14 votes. Anderson, who entered Union in the class of 1942, is a resident of Springfield, Massachusetts. He re- mained a neutral until a few weeks ag~, when he was pledged by Delta Ph1. He was president of his class his sophomore year and has been a member of the Student Council. A.I.E.E.

ABOUT THIS SUMMER One important field has so far been prac- tically omitted in the formulation of plans for the coming summer ::;ession, at least i11 the way of official announcements from the administration. It is a factor in summer school organization that can not be overlook- ed if the summer school is to be of real value to those who enroll in it. That factor is the recreational factor. After becoming accustomed to many sum- mers of either complete ease or at least a change in work, it will IJe a difficult adjust- ment for many to IJe gmnted IJut one week or so of \vacation\ IJefore plunging back into the summer curriculum, not to ease off again until August 29, only a few short days before the regular winter term for 1942-43 starts. Added to this is the fact that Union students have also become accustomed to a schedule of classes which includes very few \every-day-in-the-week\ courses. In fact a good proportion of the students who will re- turn this summe1· never have taken college courses which meet every day in the week, and now they are thrust into a program in which classes will IJe meeting every day in the week, with only Saturday missing from the schedule. These two factOI's, we think are going to be telling ones in the matter of student morale and student aiJility to \speed up\ with the rest of the nation. The two adjustments mentioned above can and will IJe met by most of the summer stu- dent IJody. However, it would seem desirable for either the administration or the Student Council to look into the matter of recrea- tional facilities, facilities which mig-ht be used to help in making the adjustments. 1 Thus far, we have heard only rumors. First, [ we have heard that the \~keleton\ Student i Council will have an appreciaule sum of' money at its disposal, to be used for the pur- pose of sponsoring- at least one all-college dance during- the summer. Second, Bill Ketz mentioned unofficially the other day the pos- sibility of a regular recreational program for the summer evenings, shaped along informal Qthletic lines. These tv,·o suggestions seem to us to be the ve1 y thing Union will need during the hot summer months to come. But if the sug-1 gestions stop at two, we shall be disappoint- ed. The field, although limited, offers a fair- ly wide choice. Perhaps the faculty should be included in the program, for they will find the long days of a Schenectady summer no more pleasant than do the students. Fac- ult~·-student g-olf and tennis tournaments, and other things of that type might well be considered, IJoth from the \interest\ stand- point and from the obvious recreational standpoint. This is Union's first summer school. All concerned are hoping that it will IJe a suc- cessful one, that it will do more than provide a place where students may speed up their college curricula and graduate early, in short, that it will still be a college, Union College, with all the things that name con- notes. We think the side of the summer stu- dent's life which we have been considering is of utmost importance in accomplishing this aim, and from what can be gained by hear- say, so does the administration.

Why not serve where your college training will do the most good? Under the Navy's newest plan, you can en- list now and continue in college. If you make a good record, you may qualify within two years to become a Naval Officer-on the sea or in the air. Who may qualify 80,000 men per year will be accepted under this new plan. If you are between the ages of 17 and 19 inclusive and can meet Navy physical standards, you can enlist now as an Apprentice Seaman in the Naval Reserve. You will be in the Navy. But until you have finished two calendar years, you will remain in college, taking regular college courses under your own professors. Your studies will emphasize mathematics, physics and physical training. After you have successfully completed 172 calendar years of work, you will be given a written examination prepared by the Navy. This examination is competitive. It is de- signed to select the best men for training as Naval Officers. ~ How to become an Officer If you rank sufficiently high in the examina- tion and can meet the physical standard§, you will have your choice of two courses ~each leading to an officer's commission: 1. You may volunteer for training as an Aviation Officer. In this case you will be per- mitted to finish at least the second calendar year of your college work, after which you will be ordered to active duty for training to become an officer-pilot. Approximately 20,000 men a year will be accepted for Naval Aviation. 2. Or you will be selected for training as a Deck or Engineering Officer. In this case you will be allowed to continue your college work until you have received your degree. After graduation you will be ordered to active duty for training to become a Deck or En- gineering Officer. Approximately 15,000 men a year will be accepted. If you do not qualify for special officer's training, you will he allowed to finish the second calendar year of college, after which you will be ordered to active duty at a Naval Training Station as Apprentice Seaman. Those who fail to pass their college work at any thne may be ordered to active duty at once as Apprentice Seamen. Your pay starts with active duty. Here's a rea:l opportunity. A chance to enlist in your country's service now without giving up your college training ... a chance to prove by that same training that you are qualified to be an officer in the Navy. DON'T WAIT.

For the best blackout techniques today, even moonlight is 100 times too bright. But although air-raid wardens can't do anything about the moon, for overcast nights General Electric's illuminating lab- oratory has developed a special street light which produces illumination about equal to starlight. The fixture contains a IO-wa tt lamp, so concealed that the only light visible comes through a circular narrow piece of plastic around the side. A projecting black canopy screens the light from the eyes of aviators. The light output, equivalent to that from a single candle flame, seems at first sight to be practically zero. But after a little time eyes become adjusted, as they do in a movie theatre, and objects can be dimly seen 30 to 40 feet away. Specifications for the new lamps are based on the experience of the British in their blackouts. ELECTRON WHIRLIGIG WHETHER you call it a \rheotron\ or \betatron\ or by its longer name of \induction electron accelerator,\ a new science tool recently built by Dr. Donald\\'. Kerst in the G-E Research Laboratory is one of the world's most potent merry-go- rounds. On it, electrons ride to a speed Close- ly approximating that of light -equivalent to that produced by 20 million volts. Copper bombarded by these dizzy, super-speed elec- trons becomes temporarily radioactive, and other interesting possibilities are being investigated. Dr. Kerst, young professor at the Univer- sity of Illinois, got the idea for the device, built a small model, and came to General Electric to build a bigger one. Like the much-publicized cyclotron, except that it accelerates electrons instead of positive ions, the device chases the charged particles round and round in a magnetic field, adding to their speed at every revolution. Scientists are reticent about predicting what the rheo- tron 's chief use will be, but it is promising enough so that a bigger one is being built in the G-E laboratory to give speeds of roo million volts.

FRIDAY, APRIL 17, 1942 GENERAL 6 Thief Takes $91 I From Kappa S igs, Betas On Sunday SCENE German, French Proficiency Tests Scheduled For Friday, April 24 Dormitory Rooms for Summer Session 1942 Crimes Are Similar To PrevioMs Thefts; Grow, Hill Lose Most Two more Union fraternities paid their :;hare of tribute to the notor·ious campus thief last Sunday night when mE'mbers of Beta Theta Pi and Kappa Sigma were robbed uf a total of $91. The thief took $61 from the Beta house and relieved the Kappa Sigs of $30 in cash. All the details of the crimes match perfectly those of previous robberies on the campus. Nothing was ta·ken except cash, a-lthough at the Kappa Sigma House the thief did keep some of the wallets. In most cases, as in the past, he mere- tv took all the money BUt a·nd left t'hP wa.Jlets lying about on desks or bureaus. The Betas found their rooms badly mussed when they got up Monday morning, with rlothrs thrown about and wallets lying open. A check-up revealed that Bill Hill '-!4, had lost $15 and Johnny Grow '42, had been robbed of $18. Other members of the fra- ternity lost lesser amounts. The thief extt·a vagantly left all the lights in the Eappa Sig house turned on. left drawers open and clothes strewn about. He had two doors through which to make his entr-ance and escape. both the front and rear doors -being open that night. 0 The Corn Is Green The Faculty What a Man:! This column sal1:1tes Dt·.

Bennett during the early part of the Summer aging Board last F1·iday after- noon. The paper will print 30 issues next year, regular issues to appear on Thursdays. The first issue will ceme out during Freshman Camp, and will be distributed to the campers on September 4. The move was made neces- sary by the increased cost of publication, a ,;erious depletion in the staff, and the increased work load placed upon upper- classmen by the fac·ulty's de- cision to require a:t least five courses of all students in the college. It was pointed out that dur- ing World War I, the paper was forced to suspend publica- tion during the period in which the campus was turned into an army training camp. N0 such action is planned by the pres- ent Managing Board. This is the last regular issue of The Concordiensis for the current year. A special Com- mencement Issue will appear on Alumni Day, May 9.

Up until 5 P. M. yesterday, regis- tration for the summer session totaled 180, the Dean's Office said, with 25 students still to hand in their elective schedules and still others as yet undecided about their summer plans. It was also an- nounced that this total included four students from other colleges, while the rest was mad:e up of Union undergraduates taking ad- vantage of the summer courses of- fered as part of the college's \speed-up\ war effort. Clearing up a controversial question which has been the subject of universal inter- est ever since the Summer Session was approved by the trustees last winter, the Administration said that no women would ·be admitted to the summer school. Meals in Hale House All students attending the sum- mer session and rooming on the campus, either in the dormitories or in fraternity houses on the .col- lege grounds, will be required to take their meals at Hale House, according to an announcement by President Fox. Meals will be served in Hale House Monday through Friday only, the days when classes will meet, but will be closed over the weekends. Arrangements made with C. N, Cease, manager of the Plans for the college's annual Hale House dining hall, have put Moving-Up Days, scheduled for the weekly charge at $6.40, or $1.28 Tuesday and Wednesday of ne~t per day.

It was not easy for the .:\lanaging- Board of The Concordiensis to make the decision that transforms the semi-weekly status of the papet· to that of a weekly publication. .:.'llcmy are the results of such a move which will tend to lower the high standards that the Cm1cordy has tt·ied to maintain during the past two decades, as we!I as previous to that. Equally numerous, howevet·, were the forces which made colltinuance of a twice-a- week publication scliledule impossible for next year. We shall lose a good deal of the \spot- news\ value which the paper, by publishing twice a week, has always had. It is true, the \scoops\, when the Concordy got them, were scoops only in the journalistic sense that no othet· newspaper printed the same news be- forehand. Yet there were occasions when the at·rival of the paper in fraternity houses and dormitories on the campus caused a good deal of excitement through the surpring or the exclusive quality of i:ts new.s. These, of course, will occur just half as often in the future. Then, too, many news-worthy events will, of necessity, be overlooked, if they should happen to occm· just after publication on Thursday, or early in the following week. Also, a good deal of the value the Concordy had as a sol't of \announcement sheet\ for the college activities will be lost.

Bailey Hall, 201 On a brisk Saturday afternoon in the fall of 1939, we experienced what, until the other day, we have always considered the biggest sp01'ts thrill of our college career: we stood up and yelled ourselves hoarse when Sam Hammerstrom and Company soundly trounced the hated Purple of Williams as the outstanding achievement of that memorable, outstanding season. We felt much the same sort of tingling sensation up and down the spine the other day, when we watched the Garnet lacrosse team run circles around Bill Orange of Syra- . , . Or some star baseball player cuse. Perhaps It wasn t as tmpot·tant as all might pull Union to a mythical that but coming in the midst of a sea.son 1 penn~nt and ~in th~ prize because '.

We have a hunch they'd been waiting just like we had. did not directly bPar on his achievement. Therefore the prize needs amend- ing in this way: 1. It ought not to be given every year but ·at the discretion of the HALE HOUSE faculty. 2. The rules should be changed so that the award will cover not only an individual achievement but the general college conduct of the individual as a whole. We are happy to note that the expected opposition to the Administration's decision to require all students living- on campus this summer to eat in Hale House is apparently not so strong as it was, at one time, rumored to be. At least that was the impression gained when it was learned that the Dean had contacted all but two of the fraternities on campus to check with them on student opinion on the matter. The Administration is logically sound enough to touch even the reason of Union College. For this reason, we seriously doubt that there will be an undue amount of crabbing about eating at Hale House. It is almost sure to save every stu- dent a good deal of time, and probably a good sum of money. To have the dining-hall open all the time was out of the question, if there could be no guarantee of the numb€r who would eat each meal there, and, since the fraternities had earlier declined to do anything about the boarding of fratemity men, none of whom will be able to board at their own houses, the college made its deci- sion and made it wisely. UCRS AGAIN Hitting· the front page of this newspaper consistantly has been the habit of Union's \baby\ activity, the Union College Radio Society. It does it again today with the an- nouncement that the Society will carry on during the summer months with a fopr-day a week schedule of programs. The Society was able to do this larg-ely because if will be blessed this summ€r by the return of just about all its personnel, thus finding itself in a position unilke that of any other activity on the campus. Yet the deci- sion to carry on during the summer should not be minimized by this fact. It will be a difficult task, but it will be one which is typical of the enthusiastic, driving spirit which has characterized the Societv's activ- ities ever since its beginning-, Thanks This is the last SCENE I shall write for The Concordiensis.

FRIDAY, APRIL 24, 1942 GENERAL 6 Schedule Examinations for 1942 On Being An Alumnus <AJ.l examinations will ·be held ln.~•>-------~­ ·--------- -- By C. N. WALDRON, '06 You, as underg-radua:tes, have lived in a time which prided itself on being hard-boiled and reaJi.stic. For this reason I have stressed the material advantages which have come to you because others, who have gone before you, have been good alumni. As the saying goes, it has meant dollars in your pockets. The same holds true to a lesser de- gree when you join the alumni body. for your Union association•s may well prove a personal ai.d to you in many ways. You are hkely to find that older Union men wiH give you a helping hand. An ex- ample of this is, the work of Fred · V\Tyatt in the Placement Bureau. Before the war, jobs were a matter of great importance to seniors. and to young alumni generally; ~nd Fred helped hundreds of Umon men to find employment. There is another advantage which wil'l come to you as alumni. Its value depends on you rather than on others and it increases with the years. Bear with me while I .state it, for in doing so I realize that it is an idea your generation has not been taught to cherish, as was mine. I can assure you I have found it important: and you wiU too, when you have had time to try it out. I am speaking of happy memories and of the friendships we make in college. Both give us corn- fort and even streng.th. as we meet the bumps of life. Cultivate them and you will find a kind of rich- ness you cannot buy; keep in touch with your classmates and you will surely receive a cHvidend the like of which cannot come from any other investment. And so in closing this series, I urge you to be a good alumnus and support your College for your own sake; it will increase your self-respect and add to your joy in living. -- ---\0\\ ---- First Aid Students Finish Defense Course Sixty students and faculty mem- bers who a month ago completed training as stretcher bearer!\ and first-aid assistants to serve Sche- nectady County casualty station ~o. 1. located in the college gym- nasium. have finished a ccurse in gas and fire defense by Deputy Chief William A.
