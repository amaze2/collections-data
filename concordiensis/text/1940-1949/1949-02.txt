The president continued by pointing out that there are certain areas which the college authorities would like to put wholly under the direction of the students. Tliese include social and· athletic events, student living con- ditions, extracurricular activities, and the general conduct of the stu- dent body. In other fields, how- ever, the faculty and administra- tion should be supreme, namely in determining the curriculum, setting standards for degrees, anc;l settling questions pertaining to the aca- demic side of college life. In many case,s ,said Dr. Davidson, there is room for close cooperation between the students and the col- lege authorities. He spoke of the faculty-administration committees on admissions and discipline, which also include student .members. In the latter committee, the president said, there is almost complete stu- dent authority, with the non-stu- dent, members usually refraining from voting. Dr. Davidson offered the analogy of the three way divi- sion of power in the federal and state governments and the separa- tion of constitutional powers be- tween the national and state authorities as comparable in many ways to the situation at Union. • Delphics Choose Red Blazers was a possibility of changi:p.g the of any segtner.t of the community production plans so that another and that no action be initiated that play could b~ substituted in defer- may pcssibly disrupt the harmo•ny The Delphic Society, honorary ence to the sensitiveness of the of the community. · Union College organization, bas Jewish community.

The Mountebanks will meet tonight faced with the question of whether or not they will present the drama \The Merchant of Venice\. Rabbi Speaks Mind The decision has been ma,Q.e necessary by protests of the Schenectady Jewish Commun- ity Council, members of which have complained that per- formance of the Shakespear- ean comedy by the Mounte- banks would offend and an- tagonize many Jews in Sche- nectady. A meeting was held Wednesday night at which the Mountebanks, the Jewish leaders and representa- tives of the Schenectady Citizens' Committee aired their views. Three courses of action appeared open to the Mountebanks: 1-To cancel the play. 2-To restrict the audience to staff and students of Union College. S~To present the play without attendance restrictions. The Jewish group protesting the play bases its action on the con- tention that the portrayal of Shy- lock, one of the central t}gures in the cast, as \typical of the histori- cal character of the Jew\ would be offensive. However, the protest, spearheaded by Rabbi . :r. Leonard Azneer of the Nott Terrace Syna- gogue, revolved a\Qo1 an alleged breach of faith by Union College in its dealings with the Jewish group regarding the play. Early in January Jackson Davis, faculty advisor of the Mountebanks, conferred with Azneer in an effort to determine possible reactions of Schenectady Jews to production of the play. The consultation, accord- ing to both Davis and Carter David.o ~ son, president of the college, re- sulted from a suggestion by David- Photo by Navias son that Davis confer with .Jewish Rabbi J. Leonard Azneer, standing, is shown speaking in protest of the production of \The Mm·chant of Venice\ by the Mountebq.nks. Other members· of the Jewish delegation are Ellis P. Eisenstein, seated to Azneer's left, Harold A. Friedman, chairman of the com- munity relations committee of the .Jewish Community ()onncil, and Harvey Handelqtan, both seated to Azneer's right. Preceflent for Dispute \ A precedent in \The Merchant of Venice\ controversy was set in 1940 by the Mohawk Drama Festi- val which originally had planned to perform the Shakespeare play and then cancelled it. The performrnce was scheduled for August 27 throu[h 31 and was changed to \A Mic'summer Night's Dream\ before the cast got into rehearsal. There is nc• information ·as to who made the decision but a :.eries of letters does exist in the Festival files of correspondance betwetn the late Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox, for- mer Union College president, and a rabbi from a local synagogue. 'l'he letters are not open to the public. A check cof the Union-Star, a local newspaper, revealed no men- tion of the discussion. The only indication of the change was m a revised schedule including other changes as well. Harry J. Linton, superintendent of Schenectady schools, 3ai:l in a statement to the U11ion-Star yes- terday that study of the play was removed from the curriculum of city schools several years ago by general agreement of members of the boarc of education. It is reported however that the play is being taught in the Scotia High School. leaders. Two days after the initial meet- ing an informal conference was held by Davis, Azneer, Frank Thyne, an instructor in the English department; Harold A. Friedman, chairman of the community rela- tions committee of the Jewish Com- munity Council; and Dr. Walter S. Gross, president of the Council. Davis and Thyne have reported that they left the meeting with the impression that while the others did not like the play, no formal pro- test action would be taken. Azneer and Friedman have reported that they meant to give no such im- pression, but that they understood that. Davis would inform them ot furthell. steps taken by the Mounte- banks. Davis has insisted that he made no such agre~ment. About a month later Davidson received a letter written by Fried- man, stating the position of the Jewish Community ·council.

The Reader Writes Dear Editor: Regarding your dastardly front page editorial attack on certain policy formers· within the hierarchy of this college, perhaps I am alone in writing, but if I am, I shall remain unwavered. I wish to go on record as in no way agll'eeing with your editorial, and further, as questioning your right to publish such underminilllg information and comments. When I first viewed this editorial regarding the attempt of a student to place somewhere within the woode·d acres of this ca~pus a box for donatic•il to the \M-arch of Dimes,\ 'I was highly insensed at your attempt to ridicule those administrators who sagaci- ously blocked his .efforts. I have since re-attained my equilibrium, and therefore write concerning this matter without emot:ion. I feel cailed upon to censure you, lest you at .some future dal;,e unleash another bolt at the mem- bers of some other campus group who are equally unresponsible for their actions. The members of the administration to whom this student appealed, are victims of a bureaucratic set-up. Such red-tape has been going on in !lOlleges for decades, in our own for. virtually centuries. Why suddenly pounce on these few men? Is· it fair to ask them to make a decision on such an important matter as this, the allocation <4 $150.00? Thing of the ramifications if support to the Match of Dimes was not popular with the student body? I write merely to expr(lsl! satisfaction that your · dangerously radical ideas were unable to ftll in the ruto in the road which have tl).ere been worn by re· peated action throUgh time. Let this be a lesson. I flaunt bef.cxre you that the March of Dimes and polio are over and dorLe with for another year, unaided by yQli. Vance ~hurston explanation. ' Would to God tl;iat fuan might know His all; And knowing thus might then impress. For truth, like youth, knows the painless fall And climb again, in saying, \I confess.' The chi1ch·en running1 rc·und about and round. The wincswept nights when stars do shine. Speak and ever lmow the haPP.Y ground And sweet elixir flowing into wine. Cry out and sing of all the happy days! The brol~en bough hanging in the wood; Help the lad who holds the oaken trays. Sing the song of everlast.ing good! Sc• let it go and when the day is done, Know that well the miller was uncouth. The bounding main, the silent scorching sun- All know the nothingness of truth. Unclassified Coach Art Lawrence and his charges will hold a service at the hockey rink at midnight. The. pl.ayers, who will appeared dresse(l for a game,. will gather about the boards and entreat the god · of winter to bless them. They might just as well .. So far this season, there has not been enough ice to play a game on. • A group of married veterans a.re drawing 1lP a petition for the college to do something about the lower end of the upperclassmen walk. Their aim is to have steps put there before 1967. 'They don't wa.nt their sons to risk broken bones, as they have been doing each winter. It is hoped that 18 years notice wm prove suffiCient for the administration: ' to do something about the hazard.

George T. Orick Campus Chest Reminder The story on the front page concerning the \Fire Dance\ deals with the teamwork which has gone into the preparations. The teamwork must go a step further to the students whose money is needed if the Phi Delts are to benefit. The dance is the biggest single effort in ,behalf of them. It will give the Phi Delt-s a lump sum of money to be used where they see fit and there is no ques- tion that they still need help. We urge you to attend the dance ot·, if that is impossible, to bu,y a ticket anyway. Benefit Needs Your Help One of the most effective weapons college students have against reality is forgetful- ness. Promises at the beginning of a term to change stud~; habits. fm· example, are promptly pushed into warm oblivion when a choice has to be made between a few beers and disciplined study. It seems to us that forgetfulness of a dut~· to the Campus Chest Committee by students has caused the com- tnittee to be over $1,000 short. We hope that the students who did forget to pay their pledges find this sufficient reminder. The Reader Writes Dear Editor: It is one of the thankless returns to an editor that brilliant writings go unrecognized whiJoe only a poor editorial will provoke comment. We here specifically refer to your most recent editorial, almost an antithesis of its direct predecessor. In this editorial the following appeared, \The origlinal mista,ke was made by the college wben_it sought advice about a matter which should have been kept on the campus.\ Compare this statemer.t with the tenor of the ecitc·rial on \Superiority\. In this issue the Union College student was decried for placing himself on a strata above the rest of the community of which he is a part. · Again, in the most recent editorial, you referred' to the fact that \some of the Jews on campus were at first convinced that \The Merchant C•f Venice\ should be produced regardless of the consequences.\ Do you agree with those who ad.vocate academic freedom to the extent that the possible consequences of that freedom are unimportant and Immaterial? Wouid the Concordiei).sis disregard the effects on Student Council Airs Blazers The moral to this long and wandering tale is just this; when you sign up for a dormitory room, Mister, you've got it! Hamilton Men Apologize This letter, an apolOfiY for vandansm to the Union Campus by Hamilton students the night before the Union-Hamilton football game, was sent to President Carter Davidson and forwarded by him to the student council where the letter was read Tuesday night. The game was played on November 13 at Clinton.-(Ed, note). My cear President Davidson: The student council of Hamifton College -con the behalf of undergraduate body expresses its sir.cere apology for the vandalism committed on the Union campus prior to the Union-Hamilton football game. Unfc:rtunately, the conduct of the few students who were responsible for the damage done reflects upon the entire college. We assure you that the great majority of the undergraduates had no part in this affair and are sincerely sorry that it happened. · In order to prevent any reoccurance of such a· performance the council is placing a resolution be- fr-re the dean recommending severe disciplinary action, to the extent of expulsion from colleg~e, for any future violators. The Union-Hamilton rivalry has always beell! a healthy one and we intend to keep that rivalry free from any ill-feeling. The malicious mischief evidenced by the vandals is re- pugnant to us. We intend to see that it stops. We thank you, sir, for yd'nr courtesy and con- sideration in this matter. Sincerely yours, Bruce Prum, President Hamilton College Student Council the community under the guise of a purely campus matter at the same time advocating recognition of the college heating plant as an indication of the world of reality? Or would you recognize as you did in the previous issue that we are part of the c·c-mmunity and that an ·effected group in the com- munity has the right to make known the possible results· of our actions. · We mention this in hopes that should ever again an instance of simiiar nature arise, these factors would at least be considered in making~ a decision. We recognize that the present Mountebanks affair has gone beyond these ca.nsiderations. We can only hope the Jewish Community Council does not read into the actions of the Mountebanks or the college intent of anti-Semitism; that shoUld the Jewish Community Council feel the Mountebanks have erred, they believe that the errc•11 is one of judg- ment not of intent. Sincerely yours, MERTON SARNOFF VANCE THURSTON <Continued from Page 1) introduced the motion to curtail further Delphic concessions. However, as the discussion pro- ceeded, It appeared that emotion rather than reason ruled.

One spec- tator added, \The more trivial the matter, the more time and feeUng the council puts into it.\ James Hogeboom, who defended his granting of the concession to the Delphics, and John Hanna, whose objection centered about a remark by Hogeboom to the effect that the council has accomplished little. When Hanna objected to \criticism of the decorum of the council,\ Hogeboa.m amended his criticism by admitting the council had at least one accomplishment ·to its credit: the regulation of buHetln board announcements. the council: the adoption of a sys- tem of ritual to govern chapel programs. When a vote was ·called on the blazer Issue, a seven-to-seven tie resulted. The deadlock was broken· by James Penirick, chairman of the council, who voted against the cUrb on Delphic concessions. One council member was. severely rep- rim.anded by ~emrlck for allegedly' votmg accordmg~ to the· instruc- tions of another councilman.

MR. HOADLEY pointed out, however, that the program does not cover students n:aking personal trips while attending school. For exa-mple, If you break an arm while escorting a Skidmore girl home, the plan does not cover you. Also the program does not extend bene- fits to• students who have accidents while travelling to and from home at the opening or clOsing of college or during vacation periods. Corrective operations for physical defects will not be paid for, nor will fees for dental work. In case of injuries received in inter-collegate athletics or physical education classes. the college will pay for the full surg-ical fees, pri- vate nurse !if necessary), and the cost of dental work required as a result of the injury; The proposed work must have the approval of the college physician and the di- rector of physical education prior to the time the work is done. I went to Dr. Arony's office to find out how many men take ad- van!age of n:edical service that they pay for. THE DOCTOR was examining a student's arm as I entered the in- firmary. Two or three others were sitting in the outer office waiting to be treated. Miss Eleanor .Sa- wicki, the nurse, asked for my name when I came in. I told her I wanted to tall> to the doctor about the health plan. According to Dr. Arony, approxi- mately 40 students appear on sick call each day. The ailments are mostly minor: sore throats, colds, bruises and the like. The doctor's office hours are from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. On Saturdays, he is at the infirmary from 9 a.m. till noon. There are ten beds in the infirm- ary's convalescent room. At least one of these has been occupied at all times so far this year by a student whose ailment is such that he requires more attention than can be given at the dorms or fra- ternity houses. STILL MORE serious cases are treated at Ellis hospital. During the last semester five students were so hospitalized. Three of these men had appendectomies. The plan paid all the costs of their hospitalization. In addition to running a \clinic Dr. Arony gives physical check-ups to students who feel that they are in need of them. He also gives free physical examinations to men who wish to reinstate their G.I. insur- ance. The college physician is available fo1' house calls to any student liv- ing withjn the limits of Schenec- tady. He says that he averages one house <!all a week. This ser- vice is part of the plan. I put the same question to him that I had put to Mr. Hoadley: \Will this plan cover such- a thing as sinus trouble?\ He amwered that he does treat Public .Relations Public relations publications of Union College won top honors at the District 2 meeting of the Am- erican College Public Relations As- sociati{)n at Cornell University, Jan. 13-15. The meetings were attended b~· Francis C. Pray and Robert R. Callander of the college public re- lations office. UCCA Dance A dance will be held at Silliman Hall Saturday from 8:30 to 12:00 p.m. by the Union College Christian Society. The dance will be free and will feature games such as ping pong and darts. Girls from the area will attend to furnish partners for men without dates. This dance is the first in a series to be sponsored by the UCCA. only those that are acute in na- ture. In other words, the plan does not allow him to treat a stu- dent who has been suffering from sinus trouble over a period of years. If it did, he pointed out, it would also have to make provisions for treating other disorders that stu- dents had before entering Union. This would be impossible because· there just isn't enough money al- lowed by the program. I ASKED HIM why the college doesn't raise the price for each stu- dent. He quoted President David· son, \The college wishes to keep the cost of the plan low. To do this, the types of coverage must be limited.'' Dr. Arony pointed out that stu- dents desiring more coverage can get it at an additional cost of ten dollars. A private concern, with the sanction of the college, offers this insurance. Letters explaining this have already been sent to stu- dents' parents. The additional cov- erage would Insure the student for twelve month.s in the year whether at school or at home. It would also extend to accidents not necessarily in \line of a college student's duty,\ Dr. Arony indicated that he tries to mal!e the plan cover as many cases as he can. But he added, \It is impossible to include all ail- ments since some cases very de- finitely do not fall within the limits set by the program.\ ___ ..!!L_ For c~r Troubles. See a UNION MAN William H.

One part con- cerned Whipple's experiences at Union, as related by Professor Mortimer F. Sayre of the Division of Engineering. Another part of the program featured Dr. Short- ridge Hardesty of New York Citly, who described Whipple's accom- plishments in later life. Dr. Har- desty is a civil engineer and, like Squire Whipple; a bridge desigJter; in addition, he designed .~he famous · 'rrylon and Perisphere o:f the 1939 New York World's Fair. The pro- gram was completed by Carlton B. Jansen, president of the Dravo Contracting Company of Pitts- burgh, bridge builders, who com- mented on future development in American engineering progress. REVIEWING WHIPPLE'S life at Union College, Professor Sayre pointed out that in this century Whipple has •been recognized as the only American engineer ranked with the seven greats who havt;l earned the title of \Milestones of Engineering Science.\ Newton is also on this list. Sayre noted that it was partly Whipple's own retin- ence to seek public life that kept him from being recognized as a great engineer until well into his later years. Whipple's writings in the College Archives were men- tioned.

' ·<Continued on Pa¥e 6) Whipple's thoughts were evidence of A:rr.erica's desire for progress. \Bridges\ he added, \are the prime example of the consequence of man's impatience.\ SQUIRE WHIPPLE was born near Hardwick, Massachusetts, in 1804. His father was a farmer and the owner of a small cotton mill, in which young Whipple worked when he was not attending school. Squire moved with the rest of his family to Otsego County, New York, in 1817. After attending Fairfield Academy in Herkimer County and teaching in tbe local schools for a short time, he entered Union College in the senior year and graduated at the age of twenty-six. Living as close as he did to the route of the Erie Canal, Squire witnessed the construction of this remarkable waterway, and it is believed that here he acquired his interest In engineering as a vocation. . Mter his graduation from Union, Whipple was employed in various engineering capacities with such concerns as the Erie Canal Com- pany, the New York and Erie Railroad, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. His special talent, however, lay in the designing of mechanical contrivances; among these were several new types of surveying instruments apd a scale. for weighing canal boats, which was adc;Jpted on the Erie Canal in 1840. WHIPPLE IS best remembered. of course, for his innovations in the field of brid,ge construction. He was tpe designer of the first iron highway .bridge truss and devised the trapezoidal form of truss fre-. quently used in bridges during the nineteenth century. In ~847, Whip- ple published \A Work on Bridge Building,\ in which for the first time the fundamental laws of framed structures were outlined ana exact rules were given for de- termining strains on the different parts of these structures. It was bridge building.\ ,.. IN DISPOSITION, S<iuire Whip- ple was modest and retiring, but to his close friends he was a gay com- panion. He was a vegetarian, chiefly because he disliked the taking of life. His views on this subject are presented in \The Way to Happiness,\ a little book pub- lished by him in 1847. When he revised his bridge building text in 1869, Whipple made the woodcuts, set the type, and printed the book on a hand press, all with his own hands. Squire Whipple died at Albany in 1888, age eighty-three. At the close of the exercise Presi- dent Carter, Davidson conferred the honorary degree of Doctor of Engineering upon Mr. Hardesty and Mr. Jar!l3e.P. Proceedings of the exercises will later be edited by Dr. Harold A. Larrabee, head of the division of social studies at Union, to become a number in the annual publicl:!-tion of \Union Worthies,\ a series of booklets featuring famous alumni M Union C<Jllege. Facts On O'Meara By Bob Navias MARTIN J, O'MEARA, JR., newly appointed chairlllan of the student tax committee, is a serious minded, affable chap. When cor- nered in his room in the Delta Up- silon hoUse, he said he had been born and raised in Hartford, Con- necticut, and had been subjected to the usual twelve years of public schooling in that city. During this time, he said, he actively partici- pated in student activitites. \One of a family of six happy children,\ O'Meara said. He claims to be of Irish descent.

The Reader Writes !I' Dear Editor, LET ME commend you on your coverage of last week's Student Council meeting. It was covered completely ar.d totally reported. Also some b~uque~s to you for the \'ery ·subtle way you edJtorlahzed m you1· column·-1 must be the first to adm~t that ruu are improving, perhaps by practice. on ycur :;lyle and manner of doing such. However, U1is is not a letter to criticize you that is done all too often by certain elements on .the campus. I would like to state why I. voted agamst the Mountebanks issue as brought up m the Student Council meeting. No I wasn't scratching my head, as a matter of fact I 'had washed my hair the night before. I'm sorry my vote was misinterpreted, but if yo~ h~d checked the minutes of the meeting, as reconed m the Student Activities Office the following! day, you would have<cfound that there was one dissPnting vote, ubviously me. UNIOl'li COLLI~GE, as I sqe it, is an educational institution made up of three elements, namely, ad- ministration. faculty, and· students. Are these ele- ments separate7 No, one element can no more afford to disregard the others than it can attempt to function efficiently without the full coc·peration of the other groups. Can we separate a football teatn from ito; coach and expect results? Specifically, in the ~lountcbanks issue, I agree with ;,·ou that the original mistake was made when the college sought advice on a matter that should have remainetl L•n campus (Editorial-Feb. 11th issue of the Concordiensisl. I do not thin~ there are any students who will disagree with that. HoweYer, realizin;; this rnbtal{e, the students cannot separate themselvPs from the faculty and administration. While discussing the issue in Ha!P House on<' noon, n student said to me, \\Vel! why should the studPnts suffer from a mistake e-n the part of the adminh•tration an<;! faculty?\ This is the wrong attitude entirely, for here the student was attempting to separate our group from the fundamental \tl io\ that makes our collegP function so efficiently. Why shouldn't the students take it in their own hands to rC'ctify the mi5takes? Certainly the vote to put on th<' play was not an attempt to c!ea1· up the situation ·-rather one of seeing how far the Jewish G1·oup would f·O in the matter. I'M NOT sayir.g that the students do not have the right to put on the play-the President left it to the ::1-lountebanks to decide, (showing, by the way, the close cooperatic·n that functions from his office toward the studPnt body>, but my feeling is that the Mc·untebanks should not have put on the play -on the basis that their decision could not help the standing of out college. Remember, my definition of the college the \trio\ uf students, 11dministratiun. and faculty. each <'ienwnt being <)~p~n<knl upon the other elements. I hope that this situation will p1ove to the various elements two things; 1st-That they can never ask a person's opinion, then disregard it, without causing bad feelings. The bad feelings resulting a1 e directly propot·tiona I to the amount the self-esteem is torn down. 2nd--That in all matters concerning our college. the three elements must ~;ain the full confidence and cooperation of each other. Remembr the quotation -\Divided we fall.'' I hope that in the ,future, the college will become a more close-knit group, made up of homogeneous \elements.'' Sincerely, JOHN F.

Aside from getting nostalgic, which is an easy task for one of my age, I found ft quite revealing. Somehow, i' appeared that the previous gen- et ation, who>;e uvemge college ag•' was somewhat IC'ss than the pres- , ~nt average student age, was filled with a bit mot·e zest and life than their modern counterpart. The stu- dent ·body was approximatciy half the size it is todRy and yet the news indicated much more activity in progress and a greater numbei· of individuals seemed to partici- pate. This activity was not only . rpJegated to the extra-curricular variety of clubs, publications, etc., but also included ·cultm·a! purl'!uits, • • • boards of managers, conferences and round-table ·discussions ·at- tempting to clear up muddled thinking on how things should be done, where and when and how. Programs of indoctl'ination on stu- dent participation in activitles\Were pz:epa:red for incortiing and present student members. But the sheer joy aiJU thrill of utilizing energy in just simply doing something was complcte'iy lost. The many hour~ and ·days lost in useless n~ination would have been' mot·e valiJab!y in- vested in ordinary bull-sessions with a few ·instructors on matters pertinent to the normal course of studies. · • supplementing the clnss rooni ma- terial. The paper itself seemed to he a more hont>st representation of the student .body, and it was pub- li~hed twiee a weE>k. This Is in no way a reflection nor .an indictment of the present paper and its staff. There are many technical and eco- nomic reasons for only one issue a week. The lack of a sustained stu- dent interest may be responsible for the lack of proper representa- tion within the pages of the pres- ent Concordy. But when I roused myself from the tra·ppings of the past I was not as alarmed with the .present conditions fl.S I had though;t I would be. Sev:eral instances have taken place in the pa$t few days that have allowed \me a new look at the Un·ion College student, and it has· been a pleasant one. for a change. Late last week the Mountebanks decided to present for their third production of the year, \The Front Page.\ Several days later, the ex-· eeutive council of the theater group, at the suggestion of the membership at· large, voted to pre- sent this attraction at tl:ie Spring Prom week-end.

When the Mountebanks decided to present the play for the Spring Prom they contacted John DiBello, Committee Chairman, wh.o was quite en.thusiastic <~.bout the. whole Idea. It was very enjoyable to see a student member of some or- ganized grou.p :;tand up and inake a dcc'ision without first spending 10 day~ in roundtable discussions evaluating the feasil:>ility of such a move. This may or may not be diplomatic, but it does certainly show that independent action some- times has merit. Btit DiBello was certain that the rest of the group would be in accord with his de- CISIOn. He .stated that it was the belief of the committee that the .more events on the progl'apl the better the weekend. He also re- vealed that certain transactions were in progress in an .attempt to secure one of the most unusual musical combinations to be pre- sented at a small college dance. PROMS AND student activities ar-e not the most important things at college. But often. times the manner in which they are handled can .be a r.efiection of intelligence and understanding that comes from adult responsibility, which is in some measur-e a product of educa- tion. The instance of the actions of the Mountebanks and .Junior Pro{ll Committee cited above are indications of independent initia- tive and maturity. I may be over-emphasizing the importance of a mere play and a me1le week-end. The decisions for each are in all probability of little. ctlnsequence. But the attitude that was exhibited and the trend of mind that was implied by- both parties was not of little conse- quence nor of small import. There was a certain quality of mood or enthusiasm that reached out and allowed me for the first time in my college career, of very long standing, to look forward to such a small item as a Prom week-end with anxiety and anticipation. To paraphrase the words of an ob- scure American philoso~her, it ain't whatchya do, but the way In h\'W ya do it. By Robert Navias Thanks a million to you all.

VANCE THURSTON Dear Editor: ON MONDAY, Feb. 14, 1949, the student body of Union College was honored by having Mr. Farmer as guest speaker for the noon da~· chapel program. Mr. Farmer spoke mainly on the subject of dis- crimination and persecution of the Negro in our society, He pointed out that by continually stereo- tylJing minority groups we are aiding in this self same discrimination and persecution. He illustrated the stereotyping of the Negro by pointing· out our frequent picturization of the Negro in such rol€s as: the submissive Uncle Tom, the little Negu-o boy eat- ing watermelon, the servile role played by th Negto in radio and in Hollywood, such as Rochester, the Negr·o lolling in the noon dl!-Y sun under a large shade tree.

Note - The following letter was writeen by Robert Tan, a Chinese student who was at Union College during the t•ecent wa1•, to Freder!c A. Wyatt, director of al Uilllli relations.) Dear Fred, I REGRET very much to have lost connection with my friends of Union, but C>nce you are in this part of the troubled w0rld, there's very little you could do to contribute to your Alma Mater or to cultivate closer friendship with your former school- mates. I want to take this opportunity to thanlt you for sending me regularly the Alumni News and other printing. matex·ials which keep me informed of all the Union current activities. Undoubtedly :>·uu have read in the newspapers and come to realize that my c•·untry is now in a mess. The Communists are sweeping through this country and are at the doorstep of my home. My people have finally realized that we are facing the greatest crisis in our Jives. Pt·eviously, we com- plain·ed about how corrupt our present government is and want a change in the regime, but now with our personal freedom at stake, we are all thinking of fleeing far far away to get away from the Com- muni:sts. There is an American movie showing in Shanghai called \Thu Muacle of the Bells.\ The title is most uppt up1 iate during this Christmas time, for everyone of us is hoping for a miracle to descend upcn us to relieve us of our troubles. MY COt:NTRY is in deep trouble, but therl' isn't a single thing that I can do for in• China our civil war is not only a stru~o,gle between the Com- mu!hlsts and· the Nationalists, but also between the capitali:sts and the very poor, between the educated and the illiterates. The Communists, comprised of the ve1-y poor and the illiterates, thus talte up a much Jarget· percentage of the whole pc•pulation '!'han the Nationalists and are bound to overrun the entire country except for the following handicaps which may upset the issue: 1. The poor and the illiterates don't even !mow what Communism is. They will certainly stop fight- ing once they are not given food, clothing and shelters. 2. The Clunese Communi:sts who take orders from Moscow so far will not listen to Stalin any longer once they become too powerful. There exists definitely a got·d chance fur a break between them and Moscow. ~o leave my job behind to go to South China or to i ·J the United States, My Company is mo•st willing to : 1: help me, but as I wa13 hired locally, I am not. · I privileged to be transferred to the South o1· to the· 1 u.s. :I During this troubled time, my ambition is to re- : · turn to the States once ag•ain and really learn some- , thing worthwhile there.

I am ceeply interested in the .oil business, shipping, sales expel'ience and factory production method:s, please see if you could or· through your· influence obtain for me a job a:fC.ng one of these lines.
