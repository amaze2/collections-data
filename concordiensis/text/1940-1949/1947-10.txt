VOL 70, No. 2 Union ·Given Navy Plaque ForV-l2Work: Dr. Davidson Presented. Tablet by Naval Officer At Tuesday Assembly By JIM MURRAY Capt. M. T. Farrar, U.S.N., addressed the student body at Tuesday's Chapel assembly on the occasion of the presenta- tion of a Memm·ial Plaque by the United States Navy in appreciation of the service rendered to the fleet by Union's outstanding contribu- tion in the training of some 2,000 naval officers. Prexy Accepts President Davidson accepted the plaque on behalf of the students, the faculty and the alumni, stating that Union College is proud of the men trained here who play-ed an active part in winning the victory and considers them very much as Union men and alumni. Laughter sprinkied the Chapel at Captain Farrar's acknoVI:ledgement that Union was not entirely strange to him for he has been Command- ing Officer of the Naval ROTC unit at R.P.I. and he hoped that the student body would not hold that against him. The captain de- clared that associating with the young reserve officers during the war was the grandest experience of his life. A Naval Academy man himself, he was quite shocked at the actions and the accomplish- ments of these reservists who had no inhibitions concerning Navy Regulations. Citing that these trained men taught him more than he had learned in all his years at sea, Captain Farrar asserted that \these young officers violated every principle of going to sea, according to an old sea dog's standards, and yet they were able to accomplish any assignment.\ Anecdote Relating a story concerning a Union V-12 trained officer who came up to the occasion with bril- liant improvising, Captain Farrar told of a whole convoy of ships in Milne Bay off New Guinea that were being held up because of winch and anchor chain difficul- ties on the lead ship of which he was in command. Reluctantly having given the order to break out a torch and cut the chain he was non-plussed to say the least, to see this young officer come for- ward without saying a word, pour a buciH!tfUll of sand on the winch and anchor machinery, calmly step over to the controller, turn it to \hoist\ and step back to watch the anchor chain be hoisted up onto the deck. What impressed Captain Farrar with this incident, in his own words, was \This young officer had been taught to think.'' Briefly describing the acute situ- ation the U. S. Navy faced with shortages of trained men and with the war plans indicating that attri- tion would be high, Captain Far- rar expressed in part, the gratitude of the Navy for the cooperation shown by Union in organizing and satisfactorily operating a naval training program on such short notice. With a lack of complete plans so that methods to be used, curriculum and other details were left up to local decision, Union Col- lege met the Navy's need and top priority was given to start the Pl'O- gram rolling. The Navy did not, however, completely leave the de- tails up to the college for prac- ti<!ally in each mail instructions word received from the Navy. Expressing Union's accomplish· ment as \doing the impossible in the shortest time,\ Captain Farrar concluded by reading a letter ad- dressed to President Davidson writ- ten by Rear Admiral R. S. Berkey. Acting Comma.ndant of Third Naval District. In part, the l-etter said thal \the Navy Department was according Union College a Bronze Memorial plaque to commemo.rate Its participation and cooperation in the wartime Naval Training Pro- gram.\ Founded at Union College in 1877 SCHENECTADY, N. Y., FRIDAY, OCT. 3, 1947 Davidson Receiving Navy Award ''Doc'' Clowe Back Again In Old Post Family Illness Brings Resignation of Wagner; Alumnus Named Aide President Cartel' Davidson receivPs JU~morial Plaque for Union's V-12 Training Program effmt from Captain M. T. Fal'l'ar, USN in Thur&day's Chapel program. Union Collt\ge was cited for rendering an outstanding contribution to the flt'et by developing over 2,000 naval officers. The appointment of Dr. G. Mar- cellus C!owe as acting college phy- sician, with Dr. Marvin A. Hum- phrey as his as~istant, was announ- ced today by President Carter Da- vidson, to get her with the resigna- tion, effective October 1, of Dr. Murra~· Wag-ner. The resignation was necessitated by the illness of Dr. Wagne1's paz·ents. He is re- turning to Toronto to set up a prac- tice where hecnn be near his family. Familiar Facp Returns Dr. Clowe is well known already on the Union College campus and needs little introduction to many of the students. A loca I product, he graduated fl'om Schenectady High School in 1907 and entered Union as a pre rr:ed student. During his freshman and sophmuo1'e years he played on the varsity basketball team. He be.came a member of Psi Upsilon fratemity in which he has remained active as an alumni ad- visor and until recently was presi- dent of its Board of Trustees. En- tering Albany Medical College in 1910. he graduated in 1913. During World War I he served in the Arrr.y Air Forces as a flight surgeon with the rank of Captain. Since his dis- charge in 1919 he has been active in medicine in Schenectady. Be- side his private practice he also held the P·Ositions of Chairman of the Medical Board, President of the Staff and Senior Attendant on Medical Service; all at Ellis Hos- pital.

It is rumored that the orchestra has already been secured, but those \in th.e know\ turn a deaf ear to all inquiries. The only clue so far, from one source close to headquarters, hinted : \We have procured a much sought-after band.\ 'Old Union' Theme The annual fall formal, whose theme will be \Old Union,\ will be held from t-en until two in the A I u 1ll n i Gymnasium. Although exact details of the decoration have not been completed, it is expected that fraternity booths will be ar- ranged on the track to give more spac·e on the dance floor. In an- ticipation of the expected record attendance, the handball courts at the north end of the main floor will be utilized for dancing. A new bandstand, given to the college by the I.F.C. last year, will be in use. Football, Cross Collllh'y Beginning with the Ball, a week- end of activities will be in order. Saturday afternoon will be high- lighted by the traditional Union- Hamilton football game, while the cross country team will be in action against Mohawk College. Saturday evening will feature the traditional fraternity open house, which has been so popular in past years. All Union College men and their dates are cordially invited to drop in for dancing and light refreshments by all houses on campus. The fra- ternity houses \ill also be deco- rated in an \Old Union\ style. A prize will be given to the Greeks producing the best \Beat Hamil- ton\ display, which will be judged by a committee of several reliable faculty members. -----0---- Union Choir Plans Season's Program The Union College Choir under. the direction of Dr. Elmer Tid- marsh has begun prepa.ration for the coming season of public appear- ances. This year the organization will have an assistant director, Prof. Robert J. Hicks. The choir now broadcasts over WGY each Sunday morning as a part of the services in Memorial Chapel. In addition to the programs of Christian music which will be pre- sented, there are plans for s-everal concert tours during this term and next. On November 22nd the choir will join the Elmil'a Girls College Choir of about 80 voic.es for a joint concert to take place in the Chapel. Trips tentatively scheduled in- clude tours in New England, up- state New Yorlt, the Ne'v Yorlt City area and a joint concert with a girls' college in the spring. Rehearsals for the choir are scheduled at noon on Mondays, at 4:30P.M. on Tuesdays and F1·!days, and a:t 9:00A.M. on Sundays, -------- Library Lighting Finally Improved Recordings Also Added To Library's Collection \Twenty-five hundred dollars worth of new equipment in the form of new lighting and recordE has been added to the college li- brary this fall.''

Support Your Team! The Freshmen will be out in 0 full force tonight for the first Pep Rally of the season. All cheerleaders will be assisted by six ferrmes from our neighbor to the North. Skidmore. While they will not be on deck at Saturday's game they will ap- peal' at the Hobart game on Homecoming Weekend, October 25th. The-y created quite a sur- prise when they appeared in Union colors and gave their all for the Alma Mater. On a Homecoming Weekend which will see Irlany alumni on hand they should cause even more astonishment and delig-ht. the excitement will start on Council Field at 10 P.M. with the college band leading the way. A gigantic bonfire will highlight the action including a round of the cheers with the more lively college songs led by the cheerleaders. Pep Rallies have always liv- ened the interest of the students for the first football game and it is expected that this first post-war, band-led rally will be the rally of them all. This will be the first of three Pep Rallies scheduled for this football sea- son_ There will be another tlight preceding the Williams game on November 1st. The third Pep Rally has n.ot as yet been scheduled. Tonight the cheer- leqders. under the direction of Jim Baar and Jim Landry, will Introduce some new cheers and they should be well !mown by game time if the rally goes off as planned. Again this year, following the precedent set last year, the It is exoected that Coach McLaughi\y- will say a few words during the rally and un- doubtedly there will be some of the team thet·e to watch the festivities from a safe distance.

Price JOe Chan First Speaker For L~ecture Series The Union College Conc~l't and Lecture Series \Viii com- mence :\londay evening at 8:00 P. :\I. in .Hemorial Chapel with Dr. Wing-Tsit Chan, authority on Chi•na, as guest speaker. The se1·ies, provided fell' by endowments and indi- vidual gifts, is for the pUl·pose of promulgating the cultural aspect of college life. A provocative list of lecturers and concert artists hus been procured for the academic year which will enhance the reputation which the series has built up in the past. To Open Series WING-TSIT CHAN -------- -- -- Rebuilding Starts On Old Blue Gate Reconstruction F nderway Frate1·nities Git•e ,llone3· By AL CORBO Victim of old age and numerous motorists, built, rebuilt, and again rebuilt, the Old Blue Gate is again in the process of reconstruct10n. The project is being financed by a gift of $6,000 from a _committ.ee composed of members 01 SIX socml fraternities. In spite of the fact that the new gate, designed by Lawrence ~rant White of New York City, w11! be of steel gates mounted on granite pylons, the name will be retained. The old name was derived from 1 the original ga.te of wooden pic~ets which were painted blue. The flrst gate was erected in 1813, and a succetision uf wouden gates follow- ed, each to fall in its turn. Finally, just prior to World \Var I, the wooden struct u 1 e \'.as replaced by a wrought iron gate supported by granite posts. A third of a century and the ma- chine age spelled the downfall of this gate. The main pm-tion of the gate was felled by an unknown motorist in 1942. A chain was then placed across the opening bet•veen the pylons. This, In turn. disap- peared. Finally, one of the pylons was demolished by another motor- ist last year. Then the fraternities took matters into tl:eir hands. The group, including Kappa Al- pha, Sigma Phi, Delta Phi. Chi Psi. Theta Delta Chi, and Psi Upsi- lon met, formed a committee and named Hiram C. Todd '97 chair- man. The gift was the result of the work of this c o m m i t t e e through which it was anuounc.ed. ---o----- Pre-Med Students Organize Society Originally Spencer Lectures The lecture series was originally sponsored by the Ichabod Spencer endowment fund, and consisted of a series of lectures on philosophy. Gradually, other topics found their way into the series, but it con- tinued to be sponsored by the Ichabod Spencer Fund until last year when the series was reorga- nized and was extended to Include contributions in addition to the endowment fund_ This year, some of the speakers will remain on campus two days and partake in some of the college activities.

'Xith the advent of the football season and initial freshman indoctrination, the perennial question of school spirit ha::; once ag'ain a:;;serted itself. Perhaps those of you who have not become surfeited with the endle~s pleadings of' other issues will hear with a short discussion of some brand-m·c\', tw.ists. .-\t one stag<'. in the oft·qUDted past, it was the upperclassmen who knew the College lot·e and .it \VHS their te::;ponsibility to inspite the ne\vcomers \\'ith l'nion e\prit-de-corps. Strang'ely erwugh the shuL' seem::; tu be on the other foot this year. .-\s fm as \\'E' can ascertain, it seems that the new freshman class spirit ex<:eeds the sum total of all others. In fact. these nwn have e\·en ex- pressed rli::;appointnll'nt at the careless ad- mini::;tration of freshman 1 ules, infe1 ring from this that some one sold them a hill of goods on \college life\. At that, the freshmen are being thwarted one way or another in theit· noble efforts. In the first place, by some form of mag'llifi- cent oversight, no freshman cheet·ing block has been provided. Although all parties con- cerned greet queries with a blank stare, it is apparent that planning coorctination broke down pitifully either in the administration, the Student Council or its Soph[)]nore Disri- pline Committee. Secondly, freshmen and others were left voicing wildly enthusiastic and fond farewells to an imaginary football team in invisible buses. The real procession took another route. Another morale boos- ter~ It seems unfair to foist our own short- comings on men with superior spirit just at the start of their careet·. Tonight at the pep rail;,;, we uppet-class- men h<n'e one more chance to redeem our- selves; to prove that, for one night at least, we can match the pace set by our freshman wards, less blase and world!:-· as they ma;v he. 1 And above ail, the raiiy should be the kind j deservecl by our hard-working, fighting foot- 1 ball team and coach. ' Addenda On Hale House Since the appearance of the last editorial. I action has been taken on the sugg·estion con- 1 1 ceming later hours in Hale House. :\Ir. South immediately offered to extend the 1 hours to ten-thirty, providing sandwich con- cessions were discontinued. Proceeding at an unusuall~· mpid pace, the Administration cancelled these on the spot. As it tm ns out, this action puts J.h·. South in a dilemma: he is now committed to later hours but does not have the help to earry the plan out. Outside labor is at a premium, so the burcten must fall on student w01·kers. This too seems difficult since efficiency, quoth J.Ir. South, demancls a steady, five-night-a-week worket·.

The first of these will take place on Saturday evening, October 11, with Phil Brady as chairman of the dance committee. Dancing will be from 9 P. M. to 12 P. M. to the music of Carmen Lawrence and his band. The college radio station, WRUC, will broadcast the dance from 9 to 10. A volur:tary contribution (approximately $1.00) by those who would, will take the place of ad- mission. The second dance is scheduled for the 25th of Octobet' after the lio~art g<~.me .,n4 coincide~ with Alumni Weekend. On this occa- sion, Frank Fleming and orchestra will perform the musical honors. From past expezience, the Student Council looks forward to a large attendance at both affairs.

Good Frosh Turnout Last term the regular elections for the various offices were held on April 29-30 with votir.·g machines, provided by the City of Schenec- tady, being used to give the elec- tions a more official tenor and at the same time acquaint many of the students with the workings of the voting machines. It is hoped by the men in charge of the coming special elections that all students will exercise their privilege to vote. While it is doubtful that official machines will be used next week the elections will be handled with accuracy and efficiency. The Sen- ior €1ections will be held in Dewey Hall, Juniors in the Old Chapel and Sophomores in the Memorial Chapel. Voting hours will be be- tween 1:00-1:30 P, M. and 4:00-5:00 P.M. which should give all students an opportunity to visit the polls.

Delayed Since May Work on the project has been de- layed since last May when funds appropriated under the Federal Public Housing Authority, pre- decessor to the PHA. were ex- hausted Dr. Davidson's trip to Washing- ton was made to encourage action by the PHA, which had failed to give a decision on contractors' bids for the project expected over a week ago. It was not known yes- terday whether the full amount needed for completion of the work has been set aside by the PHA. If not. it would be necessary for the college to supply the balance from its own funds.

Work on the sets has been pro· gressing slowly but surely accord· ing to Rolar.d Baldwin, Production Manager. In a recent statement Baldwin said that one of his biggest problems at the moment was tr design a small boat that would roll and rock at the will of thr stage crew.

This re· duction over last year is made pos- >ible by the expected record break- mg attendance. During intermission, the U1.ion ~ollege Octet will entertain with a number of favorite songs. No stu- jent at Union will have to be re- minded of the fine performance given by this group last year. One detail has still not been ~!eared up a.t this time. That is U:e question of Saturday morning ~lass£>s. At last report it was under discussion in official circles. To the average student the outcome will make little difference.

The now famous \Pep Rally\ of last Fri- day night, its angry and confused after- math, and its possible consequences deserve the impartial scrutiny of every student on the campus. Unfortunate!~·. all t'nion men seem to be familiar with but scattered seg- ments of the total picture. Tempel's also flared above normal following a series of articles by a columnist who evidently is the self-styled champion of the common working man in his struggle against that detestable c1·eature and mortal enemy, the callow col- lege youth. Before proceeding to more serious points. we might make this observation on said \columnist\ of note: he is known to be con- tinually concerned with expanding unpleas- ant events to their printable limit, oft-times this being the stomach of his readers. His slanted \journalism\ is only mentioned here because various students >:napped up the bait offered thus allowing themselves to be dragged into a neatly executed piece of bacl\- alley, sensationalized mudslinging . _ . pre- cisely what was hoped for.

What Happened However, the uncomiortable part of the affair !'emains: the facts stated in the col- umn, while unfairly combined, were sub- stantially correct. Althoug-h thrill-seeking hangers-on may be partially blamed, l'nion men were part of the near-mob that invaded Proctor's Arcade (broken lights), took over the Plaza (one door damaged, patrons dis- turbed), and crashed a dance at Nott Terrace (confusion. possible panic, general ill-will). These facts were carefully checked with the Police, theatre managel·s, and the Nott Ter- race Principal. Those pajamas were rather conspicuous. Significantly, the incidents occUlTed after the regular rally had ended at the Van Cur- ler. The spirit exhibited before this turn- ing point was the best in yem·s, a boost for the College and certainly, from all reports, sanctioned by the townspeople. However, unlike Williamstown and others, Schenec- tady is not a \college town\ and will take just so much graciously. Without moral- izing, let's examine the possible results of the Rochestet· rally as they might have affected each of us. If Our Luck Wet·e Bad'! First, there is the financial drawback. The stage covering in the Plaza Theatre is worth $1,000, the new-type screen $10,000. If these had been p 1 a y f u 11 y and unintentionall~· destroyed, every student would have been assessed. Definitely poor business! Second, had a weak-hearted theatre patron died dm- 1 ing the innocent fun, we would be damned up and down for years. Then the trouble- brewers would really have a talking point. Third, what about public relations in g·en- eral? This is vital to your life here and even more so to Union's community position. Have you ever seen a merchant in full swing after his property and business had been threatened? Or perh.aps a four-~olumn p?o~o i of the police breakmg up a rwt and mc1- FRIDAY, OCT. 10, 1947 The Van Curler, Turning Point A Briton Meets Football By BOB NAVIAS ANTHONY J.

The plan was conceived by the Union Alpha Delta last Spring and it is expected that other chapters will continue similar gatherings in the future. The synousia will af- ford the visitors an opportunity to meet socially as well as to ex- change valuable information during the informal business sessions. It is ah;o hoped that a visit to the Union campus by students of other colleges will help to spread the name and fame of Union.

With that thought in mind, the committee planning \A Weekend at Old Union\ promises students that they will be able to tl'ip the light fantastic to their hearts content at the first large all-college social event of the year. Donahue, who plays the saxo- phone, will m::rke his appearance with an aggregation which varies considerably from other dance bands in the country. Donahue be- lieves that the \better the rhythm, the better the dancing,\ and he also feels that the smooth rhythm .of the sax eection is often marred by the tootling of a clarinet some- where in the background. Accord- Ingly he has discarded clarinets and guitars to the added perfection of rhythm. The critics of the trade maga- zines, Variety, Metronome, Down- beat and Billboard, the men who know music best, hail Donahue as the purveyor of modern dance music. They put his band in a clase with Stan Kenton, Elliot Law- ·rence and Les Brown, as a member of that exclusive clique that is set- ting the pace with modern designs in music. Favorable reaction to Donahue's new music wherever he has been seen and heard, and danced to, has been immediate and has led him to conclude that his new patterns in music have been both accepted and admired, Tickets for· the Gridiron Ball will be on sale next week, according to committee chairman El Modlin.

With 0ver 1500 students enrolled and at- tending Union only 177 men registered at the polls. Such a showing points up that the work entailed in the running of the student government is falling upon the shoulders of relatively few men. Fraternities Organized The results of the election show that more interest is being shown from ft·aternity men as a group, for with the exception of one office all of the newly elected officers, both class and student council are fraternity men. This does not im- ply that the fraternity men are at- tempting a monopoly on the of.fices for any group on campus could easily be beaten in an election if every student ·on campus exercised his right to vote.

Homecoming Weekend to Furnish Thrills for Many By JIM MURRAY 1!>·--------------- Offense and Defense Plans The large Union family will be togethet• again for the traditional Homecoming Week-end Oct. 24 to 26 this year, according to Mr. F. A. Wyatt, director of alumni relations. Homecoming Week - end was started in November, 1923 after a suggestion made by the Rev. W. N. P. Dailey, '84. It was •originated with the idea of acquainting the alumni with the teaching. and work of the faculty. The idea caught on quickly since many alumni had sons who expected to be entering the Blue Gate soon themselves. That year, the week-end was also held the week of the Hobart-Gnion football game. There were approxi- mately 72 men in attendance. It was not called Homecoming Week- end in those days but Alumni Day, and then College Day. Homecoming Week-end was the successor to Col- lege Week-end and since it has remained. The Week-end was sus- pended during the war, the last meeting previous being in the fall of 1941. Last year marked the Mountebanks Play Opens at Sa.ge Buren C. Robbins, Mountebanks director, has announced that the cast for A MINUET, which is to be preeented next Saturday, Oct. 25, at Russell Sage wiil feature Clark Potter in the !'Ole of the Marquis,. and Lucille Kenney, Director of Speech Activities at Albany High School, as the Marchioness, while Hugh Wisoff will play the Gaoler. The one-act play, which takes place in France during the days of the \Terror shows the meeting of a Marquis and his wife for the first time in several years, just before they are both to be excuted. Re- hearsals are being rushed. as the play is scheduled to be presented at 8:15 P. M. in the Sage Auditorium as part of their Drama Festival. Robbins also stated that the play may ·be presented here to form part of a one-night's entertainment, for which plans are being tenatively laid. Mr. Robbins' Play Production class is now preparing two other one-act plays, and it is hoped that the three will be presented some evening before the Christmas vaca- tion. Specific dates for the showing of THE GENTLE PEOPLE, a five- night run just before the Thanks- giving vacation, will be announced next week peacetime renewal of Homecoming and the largest numbet' of alumm in history attended, six hundred in number. A full week-end has been ar- ranged for the alumni and their guests. The visiting of classes and laborator·ies is as old. as the Week- end idea itself and this year Fri- day afternoon and Saturday morn- ing will be devoted to this. On Friday evening, Dr. Tidmarsh will give an. organ recital and· there will be singing of college songs. Also, station WRUC will be open for in- spection Friday evening. Satur- day's highlights will be a luncheon at Hale House with Mr. Chat·les N. Waldron, '06, Secretary Emeritus of the Graduate Council as speaker. Of course, the Hobart-Union foot- ball game and the cross country meet between Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute and Union will occupy the afternoon. A I'eception and tea will be given for the alumni late Saturday afternoon at the home of Presicent and Mrs. Davidson with Miss Esther G. Ely, former Regis- trar, as guest of honor. Sunday morning, services will be held in Memorial Chapel. PI·e-p1me activities for Union will include the invasion of the RPI campus to paint the scoreboard a more fitting color; air bombard- ment of Troy with leaflets; and the deciding of the strategy to be used to repulse the inevitable raid of the Engineers on Union's Idol. Blue- prints of this strategy call for a fence guard composed of freshmen under the direction of Stuart Mc- Allistei·, lookouts placed in strategic positions outside the campus, and the operation of a radio-equipped pat1·o1 car. The headquarters of defense will be the USRS radio stu- dio, which will be on the air all night, if necessary, to relay infor- mation on points of attack and to insure reinforcements in case of pmergency. A public address sys- tem will keep all guards posted on new developments. The Navy \Gen- eral Quartei·s\ alarm will be rung to wam of impending attacks. On Satun'ay Octobei· 18, a motor- cade. composed of the football team's bus, students' busses, and the cars of the students who are going to the game, will leave Me- morial Chapel at 12;30 P. M. All students whn are going to the game (Continued on Page 3) Nurses Like Campus- Disgusted About Dates Twenty-two student nurses who 1'------·--- ·-- study biology at Union College voiced a very definite opinion on upstate New Yorlc, but some come the campus, course and students in from the metropolitan area.

You Have a Right As a natural 1 eartion to last week's ex- citement and in preparation for the week- end's joust with nensselaer, campus affairs seemed to reach a lull dming the past week. However, this in pm·t is mere cteception. In the student council and other govemment groups, preliminary discussion has begun on several vi tal questions.

This sentiment hos so often swelled in my gorF?-e that I must rid myself ' of it now, both for my own relief [ and for the dubious edification of 1 the buffoons who elicit it. I do not know Doctor Tidmarsh personally; by and large, I do not care for the music which he plays; at times I am at variance with his , technique; his programs are an- nually repetitious. So much for that. Now let me say that the con- duct of the students ( ?l of Union . College at our Friday chapel assem- ' blies is vulgar. stupid, and incre- dibly ill-mannered. It is a study in doltishness to ob- serve these assemblies: the spread haunches, the slacl< face. the con- tinual murmur, which, so far as I can ascertain, is principally com- posed .of scatalogical subject mat- ter. Out of this cacophonic mutter, if I may be permitted an apparent contradiction of terms, one per- ceives a rare glimmer of interest, an occasional forlorn face seeking to follow the rrelodic line, or to ap- prehend the harmony. For the sal{e of the!;'e unusual individuals, who are seeking to gain something from Friday Chapel, a modicum of quiet might be maintained, since the as- semblage seemingly refuses to do so for Doctor Tidmarsh, who is merely playing the organ-therefore being apparently unworthy of either re- spect or courtesy. ing this he probably stiN will be. God Imows how I am going to catch up with either 0f them. Maybe you think that it is pretty stupid to be writing about a headache. and maybe I agree with you. But let me tcl•l you one thing: this whole incident c 0 uld .have been avoided had you never picked up this .papc·r to start with, or had you written this column instPad of me. If, however, you are the type of person who l·ikes to let the other guy ma~e a foe! of hi·mself, then the least you could have done is brought me a drink so that I wouldn't feel so bad. and then maybe I could have written some- thing that would have been more intcresUng. Fur- thermore it is my headache and I have to Uve with it, and you're not helping it a bit by making me write this column. As a matter of fact, if you had any humaneness in you at all, even the tiniest mote, you would call up the editor of this blat and make his life as miserable as he is making mine. But no, I know you, you'll sit around Friday night after dinner and in between belches make mention to your equally gaseous friends that this stuf·f stinks, and then th-raw the whole business dawn on the floor and walk all over it on your way t0 a ·bar ta get a drin•k which I can't have. Then the next thing you know it wil'l be collected as trash and be sentenced to the incinerator, or, mare ingloriously, be put into use as a Hner for some garbage bucltet. At any rate all of my suffering will have been for naught, and the world will go whistling on its merry way com- pletely uneducated about the little drama which has tal{en place. O.K .. it's all right with me, I don't care . I won't have any hard feelings about it. And I wouldn't have any hard feelings if you tripped and broke your neck as you went out the door, or H you choked to death on that drink. Whatever you do is ' no concern of mine. I don't care if you blow the whole town apart, hut please make it some other town, and please, please, please be quiet about it.

The squad turned in a commendable, spi1·ited perform- ance against a team that has been together for 3 or -1 years. Union Marcht-s Vermont won the flip and elected to receive KeR WhaleR's kickoff. Unable to make aRy headway through the Garnet line the Cata- mounts kicked. Ta·king the ball on their owR 30 yard line the Dutch- men opened up their offensive by sending Hal Enstice thr-ough .the line, behind beautiful blocking, the full length of the field on a 70 yard run for their first tally.

When guided into rational channels, it becornes a basis for our competitive reputation; it cements various opposing factions into an integrated form; it provides the spark of interest upon which our activities depend; and indirectly, it af- fords training in loyalty which is prerequi- site in a culture demanding constant enthu- siasm, false 01' otherwise. Our spirit should result in this. However, to the honest ami fairly acute observer, it is apparent that while the first and last aims have been achieved in a way, the middle two have long since been aban- doned in the eyes of the upperclassmen at least. And the spirit of inter-colleg-e com- petition backed by an unreasoning display of loyalty has itself become a reckless, heed- less affair.

Next Year, How About Broken Arms? • • by V. C. De Baun ®------------------ 1 ! 'It\ tic tendencies of a few super-patriotic morons in both colleg-es who justify them- selves with oh-so-sincere crys of \Union Union!\ or \Rensselaer!\ Are these the same heroes who indiscrini.inatel:y administer freshman haircuts with the bland explana- tion that \it builds up their spirit?\ -Sig- nificantly enoug-h, little was done this year in the way of constructive discipline to sup- plement these altruistic aims. Sometimes we wonder just what we should be learn.ing here. In the future, it would seem advisable for the student councils of both colleges to agree on definite targ-ets. If this cannot be car- ried out, better the boys pick up their toys and play in their own sandpile. Reprint (From March 15th issue of the 1937 IDOL) \While this periodical was going to press, Mr. Webb and Mr. Hoadley went into a huddle and discovered that the library's indirect light- ing system was too expensive. So the sixteen lights were rewired. There is some refreshing madness in their method at any rate, and a few of our bright remarks upon illuminatory mat- ters must be taken with a grain of salt.\ This excerpt further proves the thesis that we students are not very original in our problems. But at least we can report in this case that rest is ours. The library lig-hting is ~xcellent, if ten years in the process; credits to ;\lr. Webb and Mr. Hoadley. For Yom Information. I Advisers Bulletin Cards have been mailed to all new freshmen informing them of their faculty advisors. Any freshman who has not yet received such a card should report to the Dean's Office immediately. Uppe-rclass advisors are now being assigned by the appropriate divisions and cards are being sent out to upperclassmen rapidity as possible by the Dean's Offiee. It is expected that this process will be completed within the next ten days, a.nd that by such time all students in the collegp will have been notified of their advisors. Make· Up Tests Registration fm make-up tests to be given on Monday-Tuesday, November 3, 4, must be completed at the Offi<'e of the Registrat· before five o'clock Wednesday, October 29. Students must obtain at the Registrar's Office a slip to be signed by the instructo1· giving the course and return the slip to the Office of the Registrar for the Dean's signature.

On the face of it, such a statement seems maw- kish, a close co11sin to the things written on greeting cards for Mother's Day.

It is vaf uely un- settling to feel that one does \not be!Qng\'; but one canrot \belong\ to something which seems false and trite.

Hams in Autos Spot Techmen Up until last Friday night the ': amateur division of the Union Col- ; lege Radio Society had remained : more or less silent partners. How- ' ever, after their daring performance during the engJgement with the , R.P.:I. invaders, it is well apparent , that these \silent partners\ saved ; the campus from being overrun. i Amateur station W2GSB had two l radio equipped patrol cars which ; flashed the enemy's position back i to the studios where it was re- l broadcast on standard frequency by :station WRUC. The <>perators of these cars de- ' serve special commendations for · working through the night, several . times risking their own safety in .' order to investigate enemy activi- ties. At some future date WRUC has announced that it will broad- cast several recordings made dur- ing last Friday night's activities. *In conjunction with Home Com- ing Weekend WRUO will have its studios open to visitors tonight, zs wcll as Saturday from 1:00 to 4:00 P.M.

Other organizations on campus took an active part in the wcrk, notably the Outing Club which was respon- sible for the area around Wells House; Chemistry, Biology, Stu· dent Chapter of ASCE, and Physics Clubs whose members cleared everything alor g East Lane; and married veterans who, under the c'irection of Don Treanor, went to work en Dutchmen's Village. Each fraternity was responsible for a designated piece of land sur- rounding its house. Fraternity Presidents all submitted w or !1 sheets whi(h showed more than 500 man-hours of work. Of those fraternities living in dormitories, the Phi Sigma Kappa and Kappa Sigma men worked en the area that included Elmwood, ahd the Phi Sigma Delta and Kappa Nu members cleaned up around Beaver. The s t u c e n t committee that worked with Mr. Wyatt included Cliff Brown, chairman, George Lowe, Fred Winslow and Bob En- gisch. In a state men t made thrcugh him, the committee stated that the money accumulated from the cleanup prcgram would be ap- pt·opriated to a fund for the con- struction of a nrw field-house. Al- though the total sum has not .been figured as yet, it is based on the college rate of 65 cents an hour.

I Physics Building To Be Dedicated A modern physics laboratory con- structed within the walls of the old Philosophy Building, erected in 1852, will be dedicated at Union College on November 8, 1947. An- nouncement of the ded-ication was made October 22, by President Car- ter Davidson. To be known as the South Physics Laboratory, the building will provide laboratories, shop, and classrooms to supplement the North Physics Laboratory built in 1926. The utility of the building has been greatly enhanced by the most modern equipment of lighting acnd ventilation. The new construction was large- ly financed by a gift from the Am- erican Locomotive Company .. FRrDAY,~ OCT •. ~4, 1947 I - - . Pysch Dept. To Start New Child Tests Next Wednesday the psy- chology department will be- gin. operation of its new child testing laboratoq _ A control group made up of Schenec- tady children will have the honor of being the first to 1mdergo this testing program. Under the direction of Pro- fessor Ernest Ligon, a grou]J of graduate and undergradu- ate students will operate the v a r i o u s test rooms. This method of testing children has long bee11 an interest of D.r. Ligon, ancl the completion of the new psych0logy labora- tory has afforded an excellent opportunity to carry on the work. The object of the program is to determine a child's abilities, his short comings and various other aspects of his mental and physical make up. By taking these into consideration, the .parent and teacher can plan the child's edu- cational program in a way that is most liable to give a satisfactory adjustment. The tests will give a good indication of whether the child should tl·y to become a d'oc- tor, lawyer, beggar or thief. Ac- cording to Dr. Ligon, if we take into consideration the over all re- sults of such a battery of tests, it is possible to save a young per- son a gread deal of unnecessary difficulty caus·ed by f o r c i n g a child's capabilities. It will also re- veal present maladjustments be- tween child and environment. The dedication will be a part of the fall meeting of the New York State Section of the American Physics Society.

Against c'efeats by St. Law- rence <27-6), Rochester <!1!8-13), and RPI (33-24), the Dutchmen will go into Saturday's contest with the same season record the Statesmen have. Old Rivalry The game tomorr0w will mark the 32nd contest in the grid rivalry which was established between Union and Hobart in 1896. In this time Union has defeated the States- men 21 times and Hobart has won nine times against the Garnet. There has been one tie in the en- tire series. Last year the Garnet was arain victor in the series, de- featir.g the Statesrren (19-7). The Orange and Purple gridsters are striving to perfect an aerial defense aimed to stop Hal Enstice who may play tomorrow if his services are imperative. If Enstice does not play the Statesmen will stHI be very leary of the beautiful passwork displayed by sophom0re Dave Strauss in last week's fray. Hobart's offense is still lacking a great c' eal too, While the States- ' men made 13 first downs to Trin- ity's 6, the Orange and Purple could not get together and push the ball over the white line. Fum- bles and irterceptions robbed the Statesmen of their power. Head coach Eddie Tryon emplovs 5 of- fensive formations. the \A \T\, \Y\, \L\, and a winf!'back. The Orange and Purple backfield is fronted by a big line which out- weig-hs llie Garnet line. From ·out- ward appearances the game tomor- row should be pretty well matched. Hard Battle Last week's contest with RPI · was not at all what the final score · would int'icate. It was a close, haJ'd fought battle with extra weight and reserve power telling the final story. Ur. ion opened the cent est up last Saturday, re('eiving RPI's kickoff and rolling down the field in six plays to draw first blood. Hal Enstice ran the Techmen's kick back 30 yards to get the Garnet machine rolling. Then \Big H\ made eigh~ more yards ·off tackle. The Enstice -Coppola combination gave the Dutchmen a .first down on the RPI 43 yard line, via the airway route. Catching the Tech- men completely off guard in a sur- pise play, Enstice was on the re- ceiving end of Ken Whalen's pass. Taking the pass and putting it in his back pocket, the Garnet star went all the way down to the RPI five yare line. Lundstrum took the ball through center on the sec- ond try. AI Wade's conversion missed its mark ar:d Unicn led 6-0 to open the game up with a bang. It was on the next play that Enstice was injured and forced to sit the remainder of the g arne out on the bench. College physician Doctor Clowe reported that Eustice had a torn cartilage. The grid star may be able to play in to- mcrrow's contest. However it is hoped that the s<rvices of the Unian mainstay will not be neces- sary, and that the ir:jury will be given sufficient time in which to heal, Art Beard, flashy RPI back, tied the score up late in the first quar- ter on a play that was set up by a beautiful quick kick that caught the entire Union squad asleep at the switch. Union retaliated immediately by rolling c'own to the RPI 12 ya1·d line. Then quarterback Ken Wha- len sent Tony Coppola out on an er·d-around play and the local boy went all the way standing up for Union's second tally. Again Wade's placement was short. Score Union 12, RPI 6. Coming back before the close of the half, the Terhmen marched 55 vards down the field to score again. This time Armstrong's kick was good. The score at half time stood RPI 13, Union 12. Union again opened the scorir.g in the seccnd half, when substitute back Dave Strauss heaved one of (Continued on Page 6) f:IRST IN BASKET· BALl.!

Phares You probably know a number of men in your class who were pilots in the wartime Air Force. They are the best advertisements for the Aviation Cadet program. Talk with them about it. Chances are, they'll tell you their service as pilots was one of the most interesting and exciting phases of their lives. Fast action, comradeship, and the chance to serve their country paid them dividends they don't forget . . . added something to their stature and poise that they couldn't have gotten anywhere else. Cadet life today is no different. As a potential pilot in the new U.S. Air Force, you serve at a time of equal importance to the nation. Freedom, responsibility, the chance to use your own initiative are all yours. The training you get is the finest your govern- ment can provide ..:.. $35,000 worth for every Cadet. You're taught by skilled instructors, fly the best airplanes. YoUl' living facilities are excellent. Learning to fly today opens profitable fields to you in aviation- which is expanding more rapidly than at any other time in history. Pilot training is open, now, to single men, 20 to 26:1!2 years old, who have completed at least one- half the credits for a degree from an accredited college or university- or pass an equivalent ex- amination. Cadets completing the course will be commissioned Second Lieutenants, ORC, and as- signed to active duty as pilots with the Air Force. During their tours of duty they will be given a chance to qualify for Regular Air Force Commis~ sions. This is your opportunity!

These states comprise the second district in the United States, of which there are eight, and four men will be awarded scholarships from each district. In addition to the 32 scholarships available in the United States an- nually, 16 more have been added for the year 1947, thus making a • total of 48. These may be divided i between regular candidates and . \ War Service candidates at the dis- ' cretion of the district Committees of Selection. There are now two types of scholarships available for appli- cants. In addition to ordinary ap- pointments which require two years of undergraduate work, sing:le marital status, and age not exceeding 24 years, war service scholarships have been created by the Rhodes Trust for men who served for a period of one year in the armed forces or in war work. For this appointment, marriage is no bar, only one year of under- graduate work is required, and the maximum age is 32 years. Candidates are chosen for ap- pointment on the basis of four standards of qualification. The first is literary and scholastic abil- ity and attainments; secondly, qualities of manhood, truth, cour- age, devotion to duty, sympathy, kindliness, unselfishness, and fel- lowship; thirdly; exhibition of moral force of character, and in- stincts of leadership; and lastly physical vigor as shown by interest in outdoor sports. The Union College Rhodes Com- mittee is composed of Dr. Joseph D. Doty, chairman, Dr. Gorden R. Silber·, Dr. Orin J. Farrell, and Dr. Harrison C. Coffin.

Orit'k Fair Deal Or Fast Shuffle? The officials of l'nion College have from time to time made reference to the colleg·e's role in fitting- the student fo1· participation in the competitive worlct beyond the campus. Allusion is continual!\· made to the necessit\· fo1· providing the ~tudent with a \weli- rounded education\ and to this end extra curricular activities haw been encourag-ed to supplement academic instruction. The school has been described as a testing- g!'ound for new ideas and new means of meeting current problems. But incidents haw been occurring- lately which lead to a suspicion that there are members of the administrative staff who believe students shoulct occupy themselves only with matters which conform to the per- sonal dews of these officials. Opposition to the formation of an American \'eterans Com- mittee chapter here is an excellent example of what appear to be attempts by one official, the Co-ordinator of Student Activities, to keep rigid control of campus organizations, a duty not implied by his title. The facts are: Since :\larch, 1946, several students who are members of the A YC have sought ad- ministratiYe approval for organization of a chapte1· here. They have been refused a meeting- place on the campus. Petitions bearing- sig-natures of students who would join the chapter if its formation were per- mitted have been submitted to the Office of Student Activities and the Committee on Student Affairs and Relations. The matter now rests in a sub-comrnittee of the student affairs g-roup. But Wait How fine it would be if our recital of facts could stop here, for we have described order- ly negotiations between a group seeking- recognition and the officials of the college. But now we must give you the behind-the- scenes details. As we understand it, the Committee on Student Affairs and Relations will not allow a member of the A YC to be present at its meeting- when the matter is discussed. In- stead the committee will make its decision on the basis of a report by the sub-committee assigned to investigate the AVC request. Even this lack of democratic procedure could be overlooked were it not for the fact Lhat the Co-ordinator of Student Activities is chairman of the sub-committee. His attitude towa1•d the A VC has been anything but im- partial. On one occasion in the early days of the contl'Oversy he is reported to have said \The A VC will organize a chapter here over my dead body.\ The .Student Council, at a meeting Wednes- day night, passed a resolution recommend- ing- denial of permission for the A VC chap- ter. The resolution was precipitated by a discussion started by-yep, you've guessed it. Xo representative of the AVC was pres- ent, and the motion was pushed throug-h without proper consideration of all aspects of the issue. A good share of the blame falls on the Student Council for allowing- its policies to be strongly influenced by one man_ Those who aspire to powe1· invariably defend their seiz- ure of ccmtrol by pointing- to apathy of the groups involved. The Council must decide whether it will be a rubber stamp for one member of the administration or a mirror of student opinion. Co-liege Arguments The college has so far opposed the A YC with two arguments. It is feared that use of the colleg-e name for the chapter would somehow involve Union or imply endorse- ment of any political stand of the organiza- tion. Also it is feared that allowing the group to meet on the campus would open the wa~- for similar demands by other national associations. However, the college does not hesitate to recognize and subsidize the International Relations Club which discusses controversial matters. And examination of the A VC setup should disclose a connection with a national parent o1·ganization no stronger than that of some of the fraternity chapters here with their father bodies. The A YC wants to use the college name solely for g-eographical identification. Neither endorsement nor subsidy is asked by the A VC. Is it possible that there is a hidden motive behind the college's stand? Is it possible that the college seeks to suppress an organi- zation which has raised issues of considerable embarrassment to those who persist in what the A YC considers to be unfair treatment of the Yete1·ans? If such should be true, then LTnion Colleg·e would nullify its past policy of allowing free discussion and of fostering interest in national and world problems. \Ve have t·aised three questions, each of considerable importance to the student body: Is it right for a group which is interested in problems facing a majority of the student body (war veterans) to be denied a meeting place on the campus? Is it right for a college official to circum- vent democratic processes and become a one- man pressme group against an organization representing a larg-e portion of the student body (in this case the 60 men who would join the AVC if a campus chapter were allovved) because that official is greatly prejudiced against the group? Is the student council deg-enerating into a \yes\ choir for a man who seems to regard himself as director, not co-ordinator of stu- dent activities?

Take \M\ Out of UMT BY BURGES JoHNSON The recent action of the .American Legion, and of some other organizations in favor of universal and compulsory military training of young men and young women makes it certain that this question will be taken up promptly at the next regular session of Congress, and that it then will be debated with renewed vigor and greater degrees of heat through- out the nation. Opponents of such training i'ear it will encour- age \war-spirit\ in the minds of our young people and make other wars more inevitable. Proponents insist that readiness for war is the best assurance of peace, the world as it is; and they seem to have historical evidence on their side. But I should like to point out that the debate thus far has paid too little attention to the fact that we alr.eady have in operation a compulsory universal training Ia w for all of our young with only the term \military\ left out; and no agitators in behalf of war or of peace seem to pay any atten- tion to that fact. What is meant by \military training\ when we· discuss this question'? Surely not an effort to pre· pare each young citizen for some particular tech- niques of warfare which may be obsolete in ten years. .Am I not stating the case fairly when r say that the proponents of such training want our young men to be physically fit, better disciplined in mind and muscle than they have been in the recent past, able to think quickly in emergency, and able both to obey and to assume command? But such results of universal training would be as valuable to a nation at peace as to one at war; yet we know that our compulsory universary school- ing as it operates today does not provide them. We are shocked by the high percentage of physical un- fitness among our high school graduates, the pre- valence of nervous disorders, and the increase of juvenile delinquency, Why should not the word \military\ be left out of the phrase \universal military training?\ If that were done, we might bring both sides into hearty agreement as to what should be added to the disciplines in today's public school training. If our high schools could teach their hundreds of thousands of students not only the textbook curriculum, but also self-discipline in the matters of diet, healthful exercise, the importance of sleep at regular hours, training in obedience as well as ability to command, would not the advocates of universal military training be satisfied? And would not its opponents who feel that the war against juvenile delinquency and debilitation of our youth must still he fought in times of peace, also approve? This would not call for six months or a year in camp between high school graduation and employ- ment. o1· between academy and college, but it would call for a thorough study of the present high school program, as well as the content of its courses and its outstanding objectives. Our present academic year was determined in a day when our pioneer population needed children on the farms in planting and harvest time. We have never since been able to shake off our absurd school calendar, with one vacation so long that any disciplinary gain of thirty weeks is lost in the twenty weeks which follow, And the word \disci- pline\ in our schools has come to have some absurdly narrow meaning which suggests corporal punish- ment in the principal's office, rather than self- command and self-control. Why do we argue about the wisdom of intropucing universal training of our young people when we already have it, universally accepted as part of our democratic pattern? All we need to do is to agree on how that compulsory system of public education, now in existence, can be best used to make our young people fit in mind, body, and morale for all future emergencies, whether of peace or war.

The thing_ that I don't like about having it rain cats and dogs 1s that the ground is always covered with poodles. Speaking of dogs, and if we weren't speaking of do=s before we are now, I once knew a fellow that w;;, a rabid hunter. His chief trouble was that he cou.ld never find a dog that could keep up with hlb:l on a long hunt so finally, in desperation, he cross~ci a Doberman Pinscher and a Dachsund so .that the mutt had short front legs and long hind .leg-s. That made the dog think he was going down- ·hil'l all the time and kept him from getting tired. A~d.tltEn there was the fellow that crossed a chicken and a dog so that he could have poached eggs. Getting back to the topic of weather that we sta.rte!l out on, I've always enview meteorologists be- ·cause they could look at a girl and tell wheather by the gle.am in her eye. .And now that we've finally gotten around to girls we're on a completely inex- ·ha.uslible topic. But I'm going to fool you, I'm not going to talk about women er girls or sex or any- thing I ike that, I'm going to keep on about the weather because the weather is always a safe topic and no body can censor you on it. .As you all know, Governor Dewey closed the for-est areas because of the prolonged dry spell. No ·w .that ·the rain is here the woodlands can be opened up again to hunters, Boy Scouts, beer parties and Bennington girls. Pretty soon the papers will be full of stories about people shooting each other and eather others cars, bicycles and horses. Speaking of horses, there's an old saying that you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him, but that old saying has no rightful place in this column so I wo n'.t repeat it. As l<Jng as I've mentioned our chief executive, I might .as well wax political and say that we want Ta:ft, or Dewey% We received a note· from one of our astute political observers today pointing out the fact that GE should be elected governor due to its a.mazing rain making propensities.
