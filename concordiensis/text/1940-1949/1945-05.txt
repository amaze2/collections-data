Bennett an- nounced yesterday that the Union College quota for the Seventh War Loan which will take place from May 14 through June 30, is $13,000. This quota is for the college em- ployees and students. All bonds that are to be credited to the college quota must be bovght at the Comptroller's Office in the Administration Building. This wa1· loan, known as the \Mighty Seventh\ is a nationwide drive toward a goal of $14,000,000,- 000. The insignia for the \Mighty Seventh\ is based .on the flag pho- tograph taken at Iwo Jima. Readers may wonder \Why this biggest of quotas Now? Haven't we already reached the peak?\ A fair question-requiring a straig.ht answer. The Battle of Japan has just be- gun. It mut be backed up, paid for fought for by a free people, int~nt on sweeping the Pacific clear of fascist hate-forever. Make your bond purchases now! Seniors --request that your gifts be in bonds and stamps, and see that they are bought at the Comptrol- ler's Office. This is the first war loan drive of 1945, and there will be only one more. Your invest- ments will help put Union's Quota on the official record, and will pay yc.u $4.00 for every $3.00. -----0 Phi Gamma Delta Initiates Seven Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, Chi Chapter, announces that last night at a formal meeting held at the chapter house two civilians and five naval students were initiated.

Active at Umon Dr. B. P. Whitaker and Lt. Franz B. Andreen Address Congregation Tuesday afternon, May 8, 1945, at 4:30 saw in Memorial Chapel special V -E Day services with the college community in attendance. The services opened with a color guard followed by the Glee Club and Choir, which sang \Onward Christian Soldier\ together with the congregation. Lt. Franz B. Andreen, Commanding Officer of the V-12 Unit, and Dr. Benjamin P. Whitak- er, Acting President of Union Col- lege, were next in line of the pro- cession. The Choir gave fine renditions of ''The Battle Hymn of The Repub- lic\ and \Prayer of Thanksgiving.\ Numbers which the entire congre- gation sang included \America \The Star Spangled Banner,\ and the \Navy Hymn.\ Words of Merit Dr. Whitaker in addressing the college community said that \all of us are glad to see an end of barbaric slaughter and cvruelty across the Atlantic. But we should remember that until our foe in the Pacific is conquered we still have in store for us mus:h sobering news.\ There was a brief pause to offer a prayer of thanksgiving and to ask for strength for the work! and sacrifices ahead. Lt. Andreen called V-E Day not a day of celebration and rejoicing. \It is a day of rededication, a day when we must readjust our efforts to finish the task ahead of us in the Pacific . . . Today we the living citizens, fighting free men of America, whether we carry on as civilians or in the uniform of the armed services of .our country, take from the fallen hands of our dead, from the faltering hand of our dis- abled, the flaming torch of liberty which they have held high.\ Professor Warren C. Taylor read \The Service Flag\ an address of the late Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox, Presi- dent of Union College, which was delivered in Memorial Chapel, Sun- day, December 3, 1944. A native of Plattsburg, he be- longed to Sigma Phi fraternity at Union and received scholastic awards here including the Warner Cup for high scholastic standing, and the commencement oratol'ical prize. An honor student in history and philosophy, he was on The Concordiensis board and a member of the Terrace Council, honorary undergraduate body. At first associated with the pub- lic relation;, department of the Panama Exposition at San Diego, Calif., Watson soon became a mem- ber of the \Chicago Tribune\ staff. He resigned this post in 1917 to join the first Illinois Field Artil- lery. Decorated fot· meritorious service overseas, re reached the rank of major during World War I when he was assistant chief of the press section for the AEF general staff. After the Armistice he was in charge of \Stars and Stripes\ Army newspaper. Since that time he has been a member of the \Baltimore Sun\ editorial department, in which ca- pacity he covered the Sicilian and Italian campaigns and action in Germany and France. He has now returned to this country. -----0 ABEE Student Branch To Meet Wed., May 15 The Union College Student Branch of the AIEE will hold a regular meeting .on Wednesday, May 16th, at 1900 in Old Chapel.

Refreshments will be served. 0 Christian Fellowship Meets Tuesday at Silliman Hall The Union College chapter of the Inter-varsity Christian Fellowship has been meeting regular every Tuesday evening at 1830 in .Silli- man Hal). Although the attendance has been gradually growing, it is desired that more men on campus become interested in this organiza- tion and come to its meetings, which are very simple, since they are devoted to singing, prayer, and Bible study. \Coal and Oil for Transportation\ is the subject to be discu.sGed on the 252nd Un.ion College Town Meet- ing, Sunday afternoon, May 13, when it is broadcast by station WGY from 1:30 to 2:00.

In some of the most famous and impressive phrases of our language, we find a cause for which we fight: It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task re- maining before us-that from these honored dead we tal{e increased de- votion to that cause for which they gave their last full measure of de- votion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain. ----·o--- Reverend William E.

Halpin Speaks to Class Ticket sales for the Starlight Soiree, featured event of the Prom Weekend will start on Thursday, May 17, it was announced by Rob- ert E. Hempton, chairman of the Committee in charge of prepara- tions for the June 2nd weekend. Ticket representatives will con- tact all men in the Navy platoons and civilian dormitories in an ef- fort to ascertain the number of men planning to lodge their girls in the fraternity houses. This will enable the college to decide on the number of fraternity houses to open. It is hoped that Sigma Phi, Phi G!!!mma Delta, and Chi Psi will be opened for the influx of co-ed visitors. Ticket prices have been fixed at $4.80 for the Starlight Soiree. There will be no change for admission to Friday evening's entertainment for those who are attending the dance Saturday evening. The admission price was decided upon after a careful study of the results of a poll to determine what price would enable the most men to attend the Prom Weekend. Music for the Starlight Soiree will be supplied by Doc Zanella and his fifteen piece orchestra. The band is well known in the Capital District and has played many re- turn engagements. Dancing will ·be from nine to one. ·Chaperones for the dance will be ann01.:nced next week ·by Thomas Carney, who is in charge of this part of the dance. The selection of the position of the booths in the Alumni Gym will be made in the same manner as at other formals, by choosing posi- tions from a hat. The spaces will be assigned after all requests for booths by fraternities have been received by Cal Simmons, head of the Booth Committee. Deadline for the requests is May 25th. Frater- nities with only a few men plan- ning to attend the Starlight Soiree are asked to combine to give more efficient proportioning of the furn- iture. Navy platoons do not need to make requests as they already represented a sufficient number. Furniture will ·be taken from the fraternity houses in the usual man- ner pending approval of the college authorities. This permission will be granteq as soon as the amount of chairs and davenports need~d can be estimated. John L. Halpin, former Assistant Conservation Commisisoner, spoke on his experiences in State political campaigns and outlined the work of the State Committees before Professor Harold A. Larrabee's class on Political Science 12b on Thursday morning. Mr. Halpin fol- lowed a number of local figures who have been invited to give the class the benefit of their practica! political experiences, among them City Manager Charles A. Harrell. who has appeared twice, Mr. Her- bert M. Merrill of the Liberal Party, and Mr. Milo Lathrop, EducaUonal Secretary of Local 301, UER&MWA, An invitation has also been extend- ed to the county Republican com- mittee to be represented in the series at an early date. Posters advertising the Prom Weekend will soon appear on the campt:s thanks to the interest of Warren Tarshis, who has consented to do the drawing. With the •backing of the Prom Weekend by the Interfraternity Council and the Senior Class, 100% attendance by members of these organizations is hoped for. Support of the Starlight Soiree and its ac- companying features will insure future dances on the College Cam- pus. ---a---- Victory Ship Named For Union Launched Dr. Benjamin P. Whitaker, act- ing. president of Union College, was notified by telegram yesterday that the victory ship named after Union College is being launched at Portland, Ore., today. The sponsor of the vessel is Mrs. Claude F. Palmer, an employee at the ship- yards of the Oregon Shipbuilding CorporatiOn. The representative of the college at .the ceremonies is Mr. Henry B.

Meeting Every Friday Night at 7 P. M. in Student A.ctivifies Office.-Washburn Hall. All Interested Are Invited to Attend. UNION'S 150TH YEAR A lot of water has flowed over the dam since the educational institution we now call Union College was fouHded. The school has weathered wars, both civil and otherwise, de- pressions <md false prospe1·ity-b\:lt it still stands as one of the foremost schools of quality in the country. Union College has every right to be proud of the fine sho\ving it has made in the training of its students- judges, lawyers, engineers, professional men of all types and a president have added to Union College's glory and traditions while also enhancing to the greatest degree the prorgress of democracy and democratic pro- cesses in the UHited States. Ft·om the date of its founding in 1795, during the admin- istration of George 'vVashington, down to the present day Union College has been a beacon of higher learning and training to those who wish12d to better themselves for their own sake and for the sake of America. With the gradual and steady rumble of g-uns from Asia and Europe, Cnion's men went forth, reluctantlr but proudly. ~ow they are scatte1·ed on all of the \\'orld's far flung battlefronts and the t·ealization of their part and the part that l_:nion College has played and will play in the shaping· of their innermost thoughts and ideals is evident in their letters. To them the celebration of the sesquicentennial year is meaningful; Union CoUege was a home. There is a @rive on at the present moment fo1· funds; these funds are not needed by the c:ollege to make up any deficits what- soever. Scholarships are contemplated in memory of both the late president of Union College. Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox, and the men \Vho gave their lives in this second great world conflict. Surel;r everyone can give something· in view of the cause for which the money is destined. We realize that this plea comes al a bad time; \Ve will not dodge that issue at all, but we all have our re- sponsibilities-oms not anybody else's. The students of the co11ege at the present time would feel a great deal more pride if thesy realized consciously what undoubtedly ther have felt unconsciously-that they are at the present time the life blood of the college and that their school is now in its 150th year. The buildings, the statues, the acres or ground would take on more signifi- cance and meaning, and the feeling that they are a part of the great tradition of l!nion College would spring almosts instantaneous- ly. The funds that all of us should contribute are ior a worthy cause; make the drive a success. BONDS AND BEER Prof. Ligon has enumerated eig-ht factors in \attention getting·.\ (How are \\'e going to get from Prof. Ligon to the Seventh War Loan, you ask? Don't worry, we will.) Promptly forgetting attention, we will re- late an allegedly humorous anecdote; but as the pmpose of this editorial is to remind you of the Seventh War Loan, don't fret at interruptions. This is a ,,·ell aged story, oft told by old gentlemen over their pipes and beer. Voici! T·\\\o village idiots met outside an inn. (The modem generation calls them \morons\). One held up clasped hands and invited the other to guess what he had in them. \WAR BONDS'?\ asked the second. Afte1· due in- spection the first said no. \A rhinoceros?\ asked the second. The same answer, and the process was repeated. Finally the first idiot revealed that he had a handful of money. \Let's buy some beer!\ yipped his com- panion. (Obviously he hadn't heard of the SEVENTH A~TilCARELESS SPENDING WAR LOAN.) The first idiot promptly en- tered the tavem, plopped his lucre on the zinc, and called for beer. \You can put it in my hat,\ said he. The bartende1· filled the !1at, and mentioned that the customer had more coming. \Put it in the brim,\ said the idiot, dextrously inverting the hat. \0. K., Jackson,\ replied the grinning schoonel'- pusher, and filled the brim to the brim. (lla~) (Buy WAR BONDS!). The idiot returned to his friend and showed him the brim full of brew. \Is that all ya' g-ot, ya' dope?\ he howled. \Hell no! The crown's full too,\ replied idiot number one. \Look here!\ and he promptly turned over the hat to prove it. Having read this far, ~·ou will probably go on to the end, so we can say what we want to get over. Everything possible has been written to promote the sale of War Bonds. The idea has been glorified, and subjected to extl'eme tau- tology. It is not oue purpose to detract in an.r way from the worthiness of buying bonds; we desire only to REi\IIND you that the Seventh War Loan is on. Need anyone say more? UCRS Station LTCRS has three objects in life· to provide entertainment for its listenrrs. experience for its operators, and to be g-~n­ erally useful and effective as a medium for the circulation of news and ideas. The third point is handled expert!,\· br the featuring of campus and wol'ld news skillfully and interestingly presented at stra- tegic hours ·of the day. On the first and second counts, howe,·er, there is room for impmvement. Still, to ~ug-­ gestions that the station present more planned programs, which involves prelimin- ary writing and rehearsal, the reply has been that such a policy requires too much time and labor, with the emphasis on labor. Someone must be interested in writ;ng for radio production, and there are doubtl-2sF many who would enjoy taking oral pmt ir such productions. A little \vell-written hu- mor to supplement Campus News would Cl·l'· tainl~· be welcomed by everyone who enj cys Campus News, and from evidences in Chow Hall, that means practically the entire stu- dent body. Planned programs: skits, back-chat, ancl their like, seem at least \\'orth the attempt; and at the sa-me time, it seems unfortun:1.tr that the large, recently acquired selection of Victor classical records should lie dormant and dusty on the floor of Studio A. The Union College War Informar tion Center will present the second in its new !;eries of transcribed broadcasts on the .San Francisco Confel'ence from Station \iVSNY at 2115. Commander Harold E.

Ben~fit The proceeds of the \Saturday Swing i:5ession,\ under the sponsor- ship of the band itself, will go to- ward the purchase of an instru- ment recently .stolen ft·om one of the band members. It is hoped that a large attendance will be forth- coming ft·om both civilian and Navy groups. This informal dance has been arranged as an All-Col- lPge affair to accommodate the en- tire college community. H is hop- ed that attendance will be large after this attempt has been made to provide an inexpensive weekend before the prom weekend of June 2. Arrangements To aid the committee in charge of this affair the USO has post- poned their \Aloha\ Formal, which will be held later- in the term. UCRS President Ed. R. Schiff- macher made the statement that a P.A. system could be installed in the gym to circulate the rippling rhythms of the college band. The Schenectady Local of the Musi- cians Union has sanctioned this dance to be held in the .Alumni Gymnasium. The Dean and the C.O. have commended the efforts of the committee for their pur- pose in staging this dance.

Suppmt Needed An invitation is extended to an members of the college faculty, and Ship's Company, and their at- tendance is desired as much as that of the undergraduate body. It is to be understood that this swing session is not in opposition in any way to the Starlight Soiree to be held on the following week- end. To the contrary, this \Satur- day Swing Session\ is to provide an \inexpensive\ weekend of enter- tainment before the .prom, and to establish an atmosphere apropos to the big weekend to follow. Make your arrangements now! Plan to support this sudden splurge in the social activity at Umon. If a successful dance is the result, other such affairs may be planned for the rather blealr future that faces the Union social calendar. -----0 wide along the coast and in the mountains. In his own words, Dr. Stewart admits that this subject is his .favorite, and an evening with him out to prove very enjoyable in· deed. Education In 1920 Dr. Stewart received his A.B. from the West Virginia Wes- leyan College. From 1922-25, he was head of the History Department at the Fairmont State Normal School, West Va. Dr. Watt Stewart was ap- pointed a member of the State Col- lege faculty in the fall of 1940 aft- er leaving Oklahoma Agricultura1 and Mechanical College where he had been teaching for 12 years. He earned his doctorate at the Uni- versity of Chicago in 1928. It was there that he developed his intense interest in South American history and affairs. Since going to State College, his interest has culminated in a book, Builders of Latin Amer- ica, written in collaboration with H. F. Petersen of Buffalo State Teachers College. Prior to entering the teaching profession, Dr. Stewart was editor of a small town newspaper and an officer during World War I. His teaching experiences have varied from teaching a back hills grade school as a high school student to earning a teaching fellowship and directing a teachers' college history department. He was appointed Chairman of the Department of So- cial Studies at State College in March, 1943. This meeting of the IRC will ·be held at 7:30 p.m. in the English Reading Room of Bailey Hall. All members are urged to be .present and all other interested students and faculty members are likewise cordially extended an invitation to be present. ---o--- Fellowship to Meet Prof. Taylora Advisor At the regular meeting of the Umon College chapter of the Inter- varsity Christian Fellowship next Tuesday evening, May 22, 1945, at 1830 in Silliman Hall, Prof. Warren C. Taylor, the chapter's advisor, will lead the discussion. Professor Taylor of the Civil Engineering De- partment is a familiar campus fig- ure.

Six Man Versiora A/S Thomas Reid, who is in charge of the ticket sales for the Starlight Soiree, anmlUnces that ticket sales for the June 2nd week- end have been good f.or the first three days. Tickets were first of- fered on Wedne sday. Ticket repre- sentatives will make a person to person canvas tonight to aid all men in purchasing their tickets ea:rly. It is suggested that all stu- dents get their tickets as early as possible because this will enable the Prom Committee to enlarge their plans i.f ticket sales permit. Early purchases of tickets indi- cate that attendance will be above that expected by the Prom Commit- tee. Sorry- Substitnt~ Acting Pr·esident Benjarr1in P. Whitaker and Athletic Director \Hal\ Wittner announced ·exclu- sively to The Concordiensis today that there will be no vat•sity foot- ball at Union College this ·com:ing fall. According to the r·elease ft•-om the Office of College Public:ity, \o;everal thorough surveys'·' w-ere \conducted by Wittner and Nel Hein, Union's football coach, and after consultation with the stud-ent council, the decision to scrap -:t:he usual varsity slate was reached.\ Six-Man The question of housing for dates for Prom Weekend has been slowed up somewhat due to a statement by Anthony Hoadley, Comptroller of the College, that the current labor shortage will place too great a burden on the school to open fraternity houses. However, the Prom Committee has promised to do everything within its power to obtain the best possible facilities f.or both Navy and civilian dates at the lowest possible cost. It is hoped that the plan to open the fraternity houses wlll be changed so as to permit the gals a tem- porary home on the college cam- pus, both for the atmosphere of the thing and the convenience for men who are bringing dates. It is possible that some arrangement may be worked out whereby the students can aid the college in solving the labor situation, and thus answer the ptXlblem. HEAD COACH MEL HEIN The release goes on to say t:;ha:t \There may be a mild form of six- man football, touchball, or ot:i'ter similar sports conducted on an in· tramural basis. There might even be some gate-free inter-sclk ool matches scheduled. But with -the Navy V-12 unit reduced and a dearth of students, either civilians or Navy, with any football expoeri- ence whatever, the prospects of anything remotely resembling- a football squad was too bleak to warrant any serious plans for a season being contemplated. •• Hein's Statement Phi Gams Hosts NavyShow(ontest To Albany Belles Awards Offered Weather permitting, the Phi Gams will be host to Phi Delta Sorority at Albany State Teachers College at a picnic to be held in Jackson's Gardens, Saturday, May 19.

In the future it is to be a policy of the Christian Fellowship group to have a well known speaker or minister give a talk at the meet- ings. This week's meeting, wh.ich was led by Mr. Neheel of the First Presbyterian Church was most suc- cessful and a record attendance was had. It is hoped that future meetings will attract an even larg- er attendance and that more men will take advantage of this organi- zation-Union College's own group for Christian Fellowship. ---o--- J. K. Mickelsen Announces New Pledges for Phi Defts A/S John K. Mickelsen has an- nounced that the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity has pledged two new men. They are William Bahr, and Robert Fasake. Phi Delta Theta has been on the Union College Campus for 12 years. The present Chapter House was built in 1914. The senior members of the stu- dent chapter were guests of the City of Schenectady yesterday when they visited the city .incinera- tor. There the men witnessed Sche- nectady's efficient handling of com- alate of Union College, and in bustible wastes. Mr. M. Cohn, grad- charge of the plant, showed the men through the plant. .After visit- ing the incineratot· the class went to the city sewage works, where 60 per cent of Schenectady sewage is filtered before being emptied into the Mohawk. Ferro's has been selected as the site for the Senior Class beer party it was announced by Walter E. Short, chairman of the enter- tainment committee. The fun will start on next Saturday night, 19 May, at 1930, and continue until closing. All members of the Senior Class, both 7th and 8th, terms are invited to attend, and bring along any friends they wish. The affair will be stag. Walt Short has stated that there will be plenty of the amber for all and that ..refreshments other than liquid are also planned on the menu. A softball game is being pla..nned for the early evening's enter-tain- men~, and the results will be print- ed m next week's Concordy.

Meeting Every Friday Night at 7 P. M. in Student Activities Off,ice-Washburn Hall. All Interested Are Invited to A.ttend. ALWAYS AN ANSWER Last week the Conconliensis was subject- ed to the unholy wrath of station UCRS ... and now we 1·eturn with our answer. By this time we think that l!CRS should realize the constant desire of the Concordiensis Staff to return blow fot· blow in any argu- ment instigated ag-ninst this -publication. If not, they should realize it now. We have gTeat admiration for the ability of UCRS to remain on the air six days of the week, and we only wish that we could make a v.ocation of the Concordiensis by publishing- every da~·. The misconception af- forded last Monday night by the unnamed UCRS announcer that the Concordy is a one- nig-ht job should be corrected immediately. The Concordiensis is a four page paper com- prised of some 396 inches of copy. This in- cludes ad copy, heads and cuts. In cleat· languag-e for the announcer, one typewritten sheet constitutes about 6 inches of copy. Advertisements have to be subscribed for and copy made up which requires more than a few visits every week by om business staff; cuts of pictures appearing in our issue have to be made at the engniVers, and take three days apiece; dozens of inches of copy have to be written-more than one nig-ht of work; and make-up has to be done for every page. Reporters and feature writers have to obtain the facts for every story before the story is \\Titten. Choice has to be made as to the importance of every article, and some knowledg-e of the general technique of news writing- is necessary. IS THIS A ONE NIGHT JOB? At this time we would like to bring to mind an editorial written for the issue of ~ovembel' lOth, 19-1-1, at the time your pres- ent editol' took office. In a list of pledges to the student body this pledg-e was included: \We pledge to establish an editorial policy of suggestion, criticism and pl!aise; honoring any of these as we see the necessity arise.\ Since that day, we have tried to follow our pledg-e as well as we have known how. It is true that we have made mistakes-can l'CRS admit the same? We have corrected every mistake that has come to our atten- tion, and we do not think that we made a mistake in our last week's editorial. isfaction lies in some of the lette~s we have received from Union men on all fronts thanking us for bringing- their college close to them while they cannot be here with us. It gives us g-reat satisfaction to receive let- ters of both criticism and praise from you, the members of our undergraduate body. These letters show an interest from the men we are trying to serve. In fact, this last blaz. ing show of enthusiasm on the part of UC'R'S does more to inflate our ego than to tear i·t down, since it shows a reading interest in our editorial column. We have always felt an affinity toward the members of UCRS because they have been one of us in their desire to see activi- ties continue at Union. Even now we do not believe their recent explosion to be the at- titude of all its members-not even the at- titude of many of its leaders. Perhaps we are wrong in this assumption, but we most sincerely hope that we are not. We do not intend to blast any individual except the one, or ones, who concocted the rather stupid charges of late, in answer to our mild suggestions fo1· improvement in our last issue. If UCRS is in need of more men to make their dreams come true, let them appeal for them as has previously been the habit of the small group of student activities still existing at Union. We have heard of no such appeal in the last few months. Althoug-h the recent battle has created an interest within the student body, we hope that other -occUITences will not ap,pear. Let UCRS not again carry this fight to the rath- er foolish depths to which it was carried last Monday night. R.I-I.B. FOOTBALL THIS FALL It seems that in the last few weeks some \polls\ have been taken on the very im- portant and touchy subject of football for Union College this Autumn. We never heard a word about them! The staff of the Con- cordiensis is always eag-er for news on any campus topic, particularly this one, and up until today when the official notices were sent to us nothing had been heard of. From. the evidence seen in the statements \He's already broken all of his resolutions except the one about buyin' more War Bonds I\ FRIDAY, MAY 18, 1945 UCRS Brings Us Columbia in face Of Bad Weather Last Thursday evening, in spite 0f the ·onsla:ught of Schenectady's unseasonable snowstorm, Station UCRS presented its first program horn another member college in the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System. Despite the fact that the power J.ines into Psi Upsilon were damaged by a falling tree some time before the scheduled hour for the broadcast, the station was re- turned 10 the air t0 present it. The technical staff, dh·ected by Rocky Howard, i-nstaUed an emergency power system to operate the essen- tial broaceasti-Hg equipment, and at'l'anged to light the studio by candlelight. Since a good portion of the lines used by the sta.tion to transmit to the dorms was damaged by falling trees a·nd snow, the exact extent 0f coverage dul'lng the program is unknown.

Since that time it has been the stu- dent organ of expression, always open to constructive criticism.

That room still exists. of Acting P1:esident Whitaker and Athletic Director Wittner we gather that they do not think it plausible to arrang-e for a varsity football schedule for Union this fall. They ~ state their reasons very clearly; we have read their .statements thoroug-hly. We do not know whether they personally want to see Springtime Since we noticed an undue amount of bit- terness in the UCRS attack last week, we will answer with bitterness. The charge that this publication writes only to fill space is entirely en·onious and out of place. Might we ask the staff of UCRS if their \News\ broadcast every night is composed of only the facts and figures signified by that great word \news\? That broadcast under the name of \news\ is a slander on the very word that has signified so much to joumal- ists and radio men for many, many years. It is true that the Concordiensis is far from perfection-we hasten to admit that. We merely have tried our humble best to relate important and entertaining facts to the colleg-e community, and our greatest sat- a continuation of football here this fall- but that, at the moment, does not matter at all. What we are concerned about is why they even bothered to mention the thorough polling that was supposed to have taken place. As far as we know no polls have been taken in the Navy dormitories and the civi- lian students are also blank on the subject. The Student Council was mentioned in the statement issued by the administration as having been a consultant in the case. What we of the Concordiensis are plainly annoyed by, is why an org-anization like the Student Council, set up by and for the students, did not present the tenets of the problem to the ~tudents. They had very little to do with anything, it seems. We expect, and demand alij answer in the very near future, and that should mean the first of next week. • lS SCUTTLE BUTT TIME FR Bt So C-~ The day wi· ·Cl'OSSin smoke away, 1 fOI' the the 0!( Nation tories · G-3 on 8-1 sco over P with h J'>OSitiOJ Carner< .750 cl' the pi base k: four t Carner< ous dri ·of the mored outfielc ing th clout. walked Thei' over ~ the prE aided 1 counte and ge trips t Andy, in fou with a bot fo Monda snappi' seen t base a Camel! the ple forts o bowed thus f: The V\ 7 aS b1 the la LeaguE over N fifth il carne \Flip\ Lynch to ope carne clout- in thE bigges almost team· their f \Spi< ged it. ship h a 13-3 Neutn gained the H home two m the , ·'Spiel' <the 1 cident. \Splck what With every trolte! out e sour ~ pire !I AI C-1 E:l-2 A-2 Neut.

When the smoke of burning horsehide cleared away, C-1 and B-2 were deadlocked fat· the American League lead and the Old Gym Dorm emerged as the Nationa-l League leader. C-1'~ vic-· tories were slugfests with A-2 and G-3 on the short ends of 12-8 and 8-1 scot·es, respectively. The victory over A-2 was a slum\bang affair with both sides ripping up the op- r>osition's pitching staff. \Blaster\ Cameron, currently hitting at a . 750 clip, led his mates of C-1 at the plate with four resounding base knocks, two of them good for· four bases. Gil Talbot followed Cameron's example with a prodigi- ous drive into the left field hurdles ·of the obstacle course. It is ru- mored that Art Classon, flashy A-2 outfielder, broke all records climb- ing the wall to retrieve Talbot's clout. Th1:1s, William's Wallopet·s walked off with their first victory. Their second was a wal-k-away over C-3. Starsnic not only held the pre-med platoon to one run but aided his mates in procuring eight counter·s by drawing three walks and getting one base knock in four· trips to the plate. C-l's ace hitter, Andy Anderson, garnered four hits in four tries to lead the league with an average of .84L Gil Tal- bot following his hero's lead of Monday, and pulled off one of the snappiest double plays we have seen thus far. Gil guarded third base as closely as a new pack of Camels while holding up his end at the plate. Despite the strenuous ef- forts of \Butterfly\ Drzewiecki, C-3 bowed in their only appearance thus far. The closest game of the week was between two teams mired in the lower half of the National League. C-2 emerged victorious over N.G.S.S. but only after a quick fifth inning rally. The big inning came when C-2 was trailing 3-1. \Flip\ Filipowski and pitcher Lynch punched out sharp singles to open up. Then Bill \?\ Dersch came through with the big base clout-good for two bases-dl\iving in the tying runs. Probably the biggest mrpt·ise of the day was the almost ert·orless baH played by a team which had fumbled badly in their first start. \Spiel(' O'Brien's B-2 team slug- ged its way into a tie for leader- ship in the American League with a 13-3 win over the Off-Campus Neutrals. \Frankie\ Santerian gained an option on a wt•eath in the Hall of Fame by clipping a home run into right field driving two men ahead of him. He wasn't the only slugger, though, as ''Spiel'\ OBrien' blasted a triple <the longest hit of the game, in- cidentally) into deep left field. \Splck\ also made four bases on what appeared to be an easy out. With the aid of errors by almost every man on the Neutrals, \Obie\ trotted around the base paths with- out even stopping to look. The sour grapes of the day go to Um- pire Moriatry, however.

The 6-foot-1 155 pound at:hlete delved in lacrosse for three years, played soccer -one, and donned his skates for two years of hockey. Oddly enough, Wells played goa-lie on all three teams. Jarboe's best year in lacrosse oc- cm-red when he was a sophomore. After steam-rollering their way to a championship in their league, Poly Prep was conceded by sports authorities to have the best high school team in the East. NEAL McALLISTER, at the hot spot, and TOM GALVIN, in center field, have proven themselves to be hustlers in thP Bingo Department of the Garnet nine. man on base which accounted for the first Union run. Bill Fisher, Garnet right fielder put the game on ice when he drove a solid three base hit with Ed Henk on first and Bill Holstein on second in the ninth stanza. That proved to be .the gil-me winning hit and came at an oppor- tune moment. Brown pitched good ball throughout, allowing the los- ing team no extm base hits al- though he was touched for nine hits. The Union hitting was well divided, no one man getting more than one hit. Ross Spicer was the big gun in the Garnet fielding. In the sixth inning he caught a man trying to mal'e home when his peg fmm right field hit the mitt of Jim Albrecht for a perfect throw. Again in the ninth he ended the game when he caught a runner trying to make third with two out. Middlebury's lone run scored on a balk by Lowell Brown in the fifth inning. Every-body hit safely except for Zangat•i and Spicer for Union. The Garnet nine had 21 assists, which shows you what kind of ball the team is able to play.

During Jarboe's one year -0f soc- cer, Poly Prep had an equally suc- cessful season. Wi-th four shut-outs in an eleven game season, they ex- perienced n-o difficulty in winning the Private Cities Championship. Interestingly, their opponents suc- ceeded in scoring only eleven points throughout the campaign, an aver- age of one point per game. Sub- sequently Jarboe was chosen for the All-Star Team of the league and held a berth on the sec-ond team. Jarboe entered the V-12 Unit at Union College in July 1944. During the summer he indulged in a little intramural softball playing for B-2. Wells is pursuing the civil engi- neering curiculum and figures to graduate in February 1947. Besides the normal voices of nor- mal sailors, Wells enjoys sailing during his leisure time. A tribute to this athlete is evi- denced in his current success on the Garnet nine. Without previous experience on an organized school team, Jarboe has succeeded in gain- ing a first string slot with Coach Wittner's proteges. ---01---- Tennis Progresse·s Gradually plans are forming for the operation of Union's unofficial tennis squad. Professor Doty has definitely taken over the reins as coach. He is writing to Albany Academy this week to set a date for a match with them in the near future to be probably run off on a Saturday afternoon. Arrangements wili probably be made to travel to Albany the first half of the series since the courts at Union are not expected to be ready for play at that time. -Courtesy l~nioll-Star Forty-Niners Win Ping Pong !l~ns Volleyball Tilt ~~ec~-~nt 0 !g~!~ 1 ~o~-~- Showing an abundance of power, the C-1 Forty Niners proved their ~uperwrity last -Friday night at the gymnasium by defeating the C-3 enough hits to capitalize. ment under Mel Hein's careful guidance has broken into the fourth round well ahead of sched- ule.

The Forty Niners played steady ball throughout the match, winning in three successive games. The first two games were won by com- fortable margins of 15-10 and 15-11 but the last game proved to be a thriller which went into overtime, although the Mud Hens at one time led by 11-2 in this game, the boys from C-1 pulled the game out of the hat by tying the score at 14 all and then forging ahead to win bq 16-14. Standouts for the Forty Niners wel'e Dick Palla and Dave Wente who showed valuable steadiness while Willy Williams proved him- self to be a thorn in the side of the C-3 team by ma-king spectacu- lar recoveries of Bill Fisher's over- head spotshots from the net. Fish- er showed himself to be the main- stay of the Mud Hens' aggregation with his putaway shots from the net and his all around steadiness. Members of the victorious C-1 ·Forty Niners are: Morris Brook- ner, Victor Starsnic, Wente, Palla, Williams, and Harry Luff.

The Concordiensis has intimated In respon:oe to last week's editorial in the Cuncordiensis ou the footlmll issue, several comments have been ethereally issued from 'the Student Council to the effect that the polls were taken to determi1w the eficacy of scheduling- games. We reitemte that we did not hear of them; and as the news-eminat- ing- Ol'g'<lll for the student lJOdy of l'nion Col- lege we feel that we had a definite right t<' hear the fads and sm vey the proceedings. Also, according· to the Student Council, \Yery few\ were in favor of turnir:g out l'ol' var- sit~· football-still no statistil's were offered for publication. \Vhy was there no open and systematical poll 'tvhere everyone could par- ticipate? Is this que:otion insig·.1ificant enoug·h to be passed over without fuH backing from the student body? The Concol'diensis humbl.r suggests the foHowi.ng policy as an airl to the entire stu- dent body: The Student Council should draw up as clearly as possible the reasons for dis~ continuing football this fall, and present them to the Concordiensis for publication. \\' e will in tum attempt to present the op- posing argument in favor of those many undergTaduates in favor of continuing school spirit tl\ rough varsity football. Secondly, im- · mediately after the publication of these is· sues the Student Council should see to it that p1·oper polls are taken, to include EVERY man, on the topic. These polls should be thorough and open and should touch every platoon and every civilian dorm. Then if the majority of the student body con- cludes that a football season is impractic.tl due to the number of men who will voiun- teer for the sport-we will be satisfied; but not before that time. Vv'e earnestly hope and believe that almost everyone will want to voice his opinion on this pertinent topic.

We present this as a sincere, constructive criticism. AS. Richard Knob presented to the ath- letic directors the results of an independent poll in which men ,,·ere asked if they would participate in football this fall. This list grew to the surprising number of fort~·­ eig-ht men \rho were more than willing to take part. To this list the Concotdiensis can add four more names of men who have stated their desire to try out for varsity positions -a total of fifty-l\ru. This pull admittedly is incomplete-b.\· no means were all men contacted. 11' this list is as incomplete as re- ported, some interest is pruven to l..Je forth- coming. Wa:o the HUl'Yey as complete as is reported by the Student Council? The many members of the student body who have ap- ploached us have indicated that football is hig-h in the minds of the undergraduates. Surprisingly enoug·h, it has come to mn· attention, through reliable outside sources, that a ~e\\' York All-Cit~· guard and a play- ing mate of his, also vmsity material, arl' seeking admission to l'nion College this sum- mer as part of a large incoming class. We also realize that nlthough man.v ~avy \'-12 students will be leaving soon, man~· of lhe remaining· -:\avy men, civilians and incoming veterans want to play football and keep Union's football tradition high and clean- as it has always been. We can appreciate their feeling-s and s~·mpathize greatly with them. The alternatives of six-man football and intramural \touch\ games, though good enough, do not make up fol' the loss of one season of V~lrsit~· footbalL The announcement by athletic and admin- istrative leaders to the effect that not enough colleg-es in our class could be worked into a~ varsity schedule seems prematurP- as did their cancellation of any varsity at- tempt here. Through exchange papers en- tering this office, the indications exist that R.P.J., Rochester, W.P.I., and Columbia in- tend to field teams this fall. An undergrad- uate leader at Hamilton College has informed us that plans are now being laid to pt·oduce a winning squad therer. A reflection on last year's schedule reminds us of the five game roster played dming- the summer term. This schedule was arranged with R.P.L, W.P.l., Rochester, and Columbia - fom· of the schools who indicate their desire to continue this leading- spot·t. We still cannot find the indication of the ••thorough surve,\ s.\ We hope to confirm the iist of schools above by publication date next week. Let us try in the future to do things in a clear cut manner, so that issues may be weighed carefully and pmper decisions made accordingly. The .sloppiness of certain of om campus activities does not appeal to us at the moment-and we are also at fault; things have slid downward for too long-it is timf' we started progressing.
