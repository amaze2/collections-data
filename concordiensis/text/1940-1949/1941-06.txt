Larrabee. The volume will be the fruit of eight years of teaching in the required sophomore course in \Methods and Problems in the Social Studies,\ which was a pioneer attempt to breal1 away from the traditional logic courses by a direct attack upon the d_iff:i- culties of scientific yet humamst-Jc thinking about social issues. Pro- fessor Larrabee has used an ex- perimental edition of the _book in mimeogra,phed form durmg the present academic year, and plans to make further changes before final publicat·ion.

It recognizes that students are often confused by the wide gulf which seems to separate their courses in literature and history, on the one hand, from those in the so- called social sciences, such as an- thropology, ~ociology, and econom- ics on the other. Therefore it at- tempts to show in detail how far the mechanical, ex·perimental, and statistical methods of science are applicable to the understanding of human behavior; and where and why they must be supplemented by the historical method, which ta.Jtes account of individual uniqueness. In this way the beginning student may come to realize that his specialized· thinking in his advanced courses is only a part of a great endeavor to understand human nature in all its varied manifestations.

Archibald MacLeish, according to his class yearbook, was destined \to take up the study of literature.\ But actually he did a great many other things before he settled down to writing the poetry that .has made him famous. He served 12 months .in France during the World War, was an in- structor in government at Harvard, ·practiced law in Boston, served as contributing editor of \Fortune\ magazine for 10 years, (19'Z9-1939), was curator of the Nieman Collec- tion of .Contemporary Journalism at Harvard University, and, since October 1-939, Librarian of Congress.

The world of today, however, is dif- ferent from that which saw l!nion's first Commencement, or even the CommencemeNt which preceded this one. \Ve are in the midst of talk of armed com- bat, of threats to the Ame1·kan way of life, of the doom of the American private enter- prise system. You, in the field of private en- deavor and of g·ovemment, are faced '\vith the problem of meeting these pressures and of helping- to lead America onward in spite of them. We in college are faced with the same pressures, but our problems assume slightly different form. 'vVe, 'vho have grown up in an era that has called for \planned lives\ have suddenly been confronted with immu- ttvble forces which make \fully planned lives\ impossible. We are attempting to meet these challenges as adequately as you have been meeting your challenge. Our lack of age and experience makes om· chief utility in the present crisis that of implementing and as- sisting you in meeting the questions of today. We recognize also, as you do, that thet·e is one great problem v.-ith which all of us who are connected with Union are collectively concemed. This problem we face in common with all the private institutions in the country. We are in a period v,·hen collegiate enroll- ment is decreasing sharply, in which a tem- porary tidal wave demanding one to be \com- pletely 'practical'\ is driving students away from the pursuit of classical and arts courses, in which financial exigency has made it im- possible for the small private institutions of the Uni,ted States to depend solely upon a few very wealthy donors to tide them over difficult times. We undergraduates have recognized the existence of this problem. We have made several attempts to meet it: (1) The Student Tax Committee has made a general and thorough survey of all extra- curricular activity. Recog·nizing the inevit- able reduction in total student tax revenue that will result from decreased enrollment, the committee undet'took this spring to make a general slash for all activities budgets, em- powering the retention, however, of all major functions. (2) Some campus fraternities have taken measures for early purchase of foodstuffs to negate the possible rise in prices, and have levied special taxes to meet next year's prob- lems. (3) l\lany undergraduates have cooperated with the Admissions Office in distributing matel'ial about Union, and in advising theit· friends to apply for admission to the colleg·e. The advantages of undergraduate activity are those of retaining campus spirit and of campus consolidation. Working together we can best realize that the most important and at the same time most difficult task before us in this day is that of remaining in college. We have heard and seen that you are do- ing much to meet the problems that are fac- ing Union: ( 1) You are adding to the advnn.tag-es to be gained b~· students here by financing such projects as the much needed I'e-su1·facing- of Alexande1· Field.

Your trustees' committee is attempt- ing- to plan ahead to meet all eventualities. It is true that we are liviHg in a day when new pressures and p1·oblems arise contin- uall~·, a day in which many institutions that cannot stand the stntin of adversity will go unde1·. As long as all those who are connect- ed with l 1 nioll-\\'hether as undergmduate, graduate, faculty member, Ol' administration officer-will cooperate, we need fear no diffi .. cult times. We would like you to know that \\'e have enjoyed meeting you all very much. Why don't you make it a practice to visit the cam- pus much more often'? KEEN LOSS :\lilton Enzer, assistant to the President for Public Announcements, has asked for and has been granted a leave of absence for one year. He has told us that his future plans do not call for his retum to the official fam- ily of the college, but that he will always keep Union as his avocation. To tell the story of illilton Enzer at Union is to recapitulate Union's history during the last decade. From the spring of 1929 when his undergraduate activity in promoting· the building of the present illountebanks Theatre was recognized by the award of the Bailey Cup to \the man who did most for the col- lege,\ to June of 1941 when for the last time, he prepares to report the Union Commence- ment fot· the newspapers of the nation, the thread of :\lilton Enzer's life has been, by his choice, closely intertwined with the develop- ment and progress of Union. Whethel' he was acting as Director of the News Bureau, as advisor to the Radio Work- shop which he organized, as script writer for one of the college's radio programs, or as ad- visor to the Mountebanks or The Concordien- sis, he continually amazed all those with whom he had contact with the quality and quantity of the work that he did . .!\lost of us could not understand how one man could work so steadily, so happily, and so well for seven days and nights of the college year, and almost the same period during the sum- mer. A major reason for the prodigious amount of work that he did was that l\Iilton Enzer loved his job, fol' the successful pe1·formance of his work meant advantage to the Union College that he has always loved. J\Iilton Enzet·'s has been a difficult position to hold. One responsible for public relations in a living institution of many men has never an easy task, nor may he ever expect recog- nition commensurate to the services he ren- ders. In his departure from the official family of the college, however, Milton Enzer will re- ceive that recognition, He will receive it from the college, which realizes that it is losing a faithful servant who will yet make Union his \hobby.\ He will receive it from those of us who knew him as our friend and who will feel the loss of his presence. With men like Milton Enzer in its ranl<s, Union need never fear for the future. And we thought Tony Kaist>r, '40, was bad! Examinations Examinations have gone quicl,er and smoot·her for the avet·age Union :;tudent this year. The weather, al- ways an important factor in an- swering the question of whether to study or not, was generally cool. The gym was comfortable tho11gh a trifle c0ld and clammy- a we·Jcome change fr·om the hot weather of last yea!'. Joe, the ice cream man, who has peddled his sticks, by ann0une- ing his an ivai by 1 inging his bell loudly, was a·bsent but unrnissed this year. Nor was there an event compar- able to Zi·p's alarm clock two years ago. Then 'Zip, who had experienced dif-ficulty in seeing the gym clock and in finishing his examination within thr·ee hours, br·ought his trusty Big Ben to the exam. Others. seated around him, quietly set the clock for 10:15. The whole gym was startled when it rang includ·ing the jokers who wer·e almost blasted from their seats. By Friday tho?Tf' was the usual anwtmt of poetry, dr:awings, scratch not~>.s and names on tht> wrapping p-aper covNs of the board tables. For awhile Monday, May 19th those taking examinations experi- enced a fifteen minute period not unlike an air raid in a shelter. Outside the tree spraying ma- chine, coating the gym trees with a white anti-bug liquid, made sounds like those of a siren. The noise which floated into the gym rose and shriel{ed, dropped and whispered, as if to indicate the ap- proach, the bombing and the pas- :;age of enemy aircraft overhead. But there were no casualties ex- Cl'pt scattered Fs! 'Milt' .•. .•. Gone! We had always thought that 'Milt' Enzer, the Assistant to the President for Public Announce- ments or just plain \publicity di- Jector\ would be a fixture here for- ever. Somehow we had visions of him pounding ~:~. typewriter in some distant future age, grey but as full of energy and enthusiasm as ever, still getting Union's name in news- pa,pers and magazines throughout the length and breadth of this coun- try.

For four short years we've lived and studied here. The first three years we spent as many men have done, with nothing muc,h to interfere Wdth easy living college men enjoy. But this year we have been somewhat annoyed. There's been no great increase in quantity Of beer and cigarettes that we've employed, And yet a sense that every hour must count, That every minute must be wrought to give Its last and fullest ounce of pleasure out, Providing talks and such, to let us live. The nearly singular uncertainty Of future life that all of us must face Has made us seize the few remaining hours To multiply our memories of this ,place. We think that we are unaffected-proud That we are undisturbed by someone's war, But ,think again and you'll remember then The t•houghts that none can easily ignore. However difficult it may he to do We'll keep on beirrg unperturbed a while, Despite an inner turbulence that won't Be stayed, and greet the world with dauntless smile.

Alone in his room at Union College one day in the fall of 1806 during the height of an illness, his thoughts turning to his frieads and famBy at horne, 1 he followed his natural inclinations 1 and gave utterance to his feelings l \·by reducing the pleasures uf home 1 to doggerel.\ The poem writtea at that time was included among the papers of Harmanus Bleecker of Albany, a friend and patron of Payne during 1 his college course, and it subse- quently found its way to the li- bral·y of Union College where it was brought to light and first pub- lished in 1913. This poem enti tied \Home Dear Home,\ is the imrna· ture expression of those sentiments which years after culminated in the masterpiece that was to make the name of its author immor,tal. Thus, Union College becomes the Home of \Home Sweet Home.\ John Howard Payne did not re· main to complete his course at Uaion College, fot· in 1808 his fath- er's failing health and broken for- tunes made it necessary for hj.m to actively assist in the support of the family, Obtaining a reluctant con- sent from his father, he decided to put his dramatic talents to use and after spending a few months in preparation, he at last ful·filled his boyish wish by making his debut as an actor at the Park Theatre, New York City, on February 24, 1809. Payne On Stage Payne was not yet eighteen years of age when he became a professional actor. At fourteen, he had attracted unusual attention by his amateur acting and especially by his dramatic criticisms. At six- teen, he had written most of the verse published by him in 1813 as \Juvenile Poems,\ and he had also made his first attempts at play- writing. In other words, before he was eighteen years of age, Payne had foreshadowed the chief activ- ities of a long and eventful life- his acting, dramatic criticism, song-writing and his plays. Payne's later career, it must be admitted, however, \was the un- happy one of disappointment, a his- tory of baffled aims, a life nowise proportioned to boyish promise.\ His achievements were the less re- markable the older he grew, and his struggles were like the \flutter of a bird against its bars trying them all in turn and in vain,\ yet \whatever may have been his life, his successes, his disappointments, or his character, no post, actor, editor or consul was ever laid to rest with higher honors\ than when on June 9, 1883, thirty-one years after his death, the remains of John Howard Payne were brought- Back to the bosom of his own loved land,- Back to his kindred, friends, his own Sweet Home, and re-interred in Oak Hill Ceme- tery, Washington, D.

Killian, '42, president of the student council and of the student body, so that he will be able to l{eep in touch with members of the council and mem·bers of the various campus committees dur- ing the summer. Names of those who will head and will be members of the dif- ferent committees such as: Orien- tation, Campus Function, Fresh- men Dance and the ·Campus Chest will be announced in the ·first fall issue of The Concordien- sis, Killian said. During the summer plans will be made 'by the various commit- tees and they will be informed of the exact nature of their duties so that they will be able to func- tion at the start of school rather than several weeks later. But one organizational meeting will be needed in the .fall, Killian said, if the committees and committee heads have corresponded. Thus freshmen rules, party plans will have been made and there will be no hesitation about application of them during the first two weeks of school.
