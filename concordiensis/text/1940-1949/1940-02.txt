Epolte in daily assembly Thursday morning and recounted a few intetesting ex· periences he had while travelling up and down the Persian Gulf ad- rninietering medical treatment to the Arabs under dange1ous and difficult conditions. The theme of his talk was pri- marily concet·ned with the many habits of the Arabs and their un- familiar characteristirs. \The Des- ert Doctot\ told of the time when he wa.s greeted in the market -place of a town by a tall, well-built na- tive who asl1ed him in a very com- mandeering voice to open his mouth. The doctor complied to the request and was astoni>Ohed to hear the Arab exclaim, \Yes now I am sm e that there are gal d teeth growing in your mouth.\ Although he tried his hardest to convince the awe-Etricken Atab that the gold teeth were put there by a dentist and not by an act of God, Dr. Har- rison soon found himself sunound- ed by a large group of natives who :ooked with amazement at the gold teeth in his unwillingly opened mouth. This was the first time that any of them had seen any but real teeth. The speaket used this incident to illustrate the scientific and observing attitude that the Arabs display. On the other hand, :'The Dese1 t Doctor\ ~aid, it brought out their ignorance and the backward conditions of that country. Describes Battle To point out the fighting ability and fearlessness of the Arabs, Dr. Harrison desctibed a battle in which a group of Arabs partici- pated. At the conclusion of the fight when the chief was leading his men home, the doctor asked the chief how they happened to cap- ture the thirty-seven machine guns they had with them. The explan- ation was >imple: he had merely sent two hundred men armed with swords against each machine gun nest and if two of them got through to each weapon, that took care of that gun.

Dr. Cowley was born in St. Pete I sburg, Virginia, and attended Dat·tmouth College, 1 eceiving a Bachelor of Arts degree from that in- stitution. After leaving Dartmouth, he became a prominent figure in journalistic circles as a member• of the \Bo::;to.t Transclipt\ staff and later as editor of the \Journal of Education.\ fie enter!!d the University of Chi- cago a:; a graduate student and subsequently became the executive sect etary of the university's voca- tional guidance and placement bu- reaus. Leaving Chicago he went to the Ohio State University as assist- ant professor of psychology and head of the personnel division of the bureau of educational research. Dr. Cowley remained at Ohio State until he was inaugurated as Presi- dent of Hamilton College on June 11, 1938, succeeding Dr. Frederick C. Terry. Publishes Books Dr. Cowley has published several boolts dealing with psychology, the best known being \Psychology of Leadership,\ \Psychology Tech- nique in Personal Administration\ and \Problems of Highe1· Educa- tion.\ Last year, in celebration of the 144th anniversary of Union College, Professor Samuel Elliot Morrison of Harvard University and Dr. George Dwight Kellogg of Union College were the principal speakers. Professor M o r r i s o n discussed \George Washington and the New Deal of 1789\ while Dr. Kellogg spoke about \The Ever Resurgent College.\ Professor Morrison re- ceived the honorary degree of Doc- tor of Laws from President Fox and the Board of Trustees at this time. Hamilton College. is Union's friendliest rival college in the state and their association has been in- timate since the founding of Ham- ilton College in 1812, for Union granted degrees to Hamilton sen- iors until the Boat d of Regents gave the degree-granting privilege to Hamilton. It was Dirck Romeyn, pastor of the Dutch Reformed Church in Schenectady, and General Philip Schuyler, of Albany, who led to a successful conclusion the sixteen yea1 s' petition to the state legisla- ture for permission to establish the fitet non-sectarian college. In the meanwhile the Schenectady Acad- emy had been organized in 1785 so that when the charter was granted to Union College Fe-bruary 25, 1795, the college literally began to func- tion at the same time with a fac- ulty, student body and buildings of the Schenectady Academy. ---0--- Tidmarsh Will Feature French Composers The works of French composers will be featured by Dr. Elmer A.

John Phillips Assistants Granger Tripp Solomon Blechman Robert Hayner Friday, February 2, 1940 SIGNIFICANT GESTURE This issue of \The Concordiensis\ carries the announcement of the choice of Dr. William D. Cowle:y·, president of Ham- ilton College, for the s·peaker at the annual Founders' Day celebration on Feb1·um·y 21. We feel it not amiss to emphasize this as another example of the friendly aspect which the rivalry between Union and Hamilton has always taken. Except for the years 1890-92, when football relations with Hamilton were temporarily suspended, Union and Hamilton have always existed in ut- most harmony. Despite the frenzied athletic strifes which have marked our relations, once the field of battle is left the men of Union and the men of Hamilton find cordial wel- comes awaiting in the halls of either college. We salute President Fox for his invitation to the official representative of Hamilton College to address the students of Union on this day of note. We salute President Cowley for his gracious acceptance of Dr. Fox's invitation. We sug- gest a most hearty welcome for Dr. Cowley and a large chapel attendance on Founders' Day. C. 1\I. F.

There can be no doubt that Mr. Frederick's advice- namely, that the applicant should present as much evidence as possible that he possesses the qualities of character, per- sonality, intelligence, industry, and initiative-is sound. However, a little consideration is due the more important phase of the question: the development of real qualifications for success. Fooling the interviewer into making an offe1 cannot permanently assm·e the appEcant of success, as a great many of us seem to assume. Getting a job is but a small part of the long and arduous task of achieving success. In the words of Thomas A. Edi- son,. \Success is 10% inspiration and 90 0- perspiration.\ A good healthy desire to earn a place in the world will do much to remove this distorted viewpoint, and a candid recognition of the fact that hard work is an essential to success will be an asset to every senior who entertains high hopes for the future. Perhaps the most helpful solution would be achieved if every job-hunter would mentally survey himself, coldly and rationally appraising his qualifications and, putting him- self in an employer's place, determine his worth on the basis of his present qualities. Let's get down to earth and realize that· success is not automatic. Let's realize that thousands of others are in the same position all over the country, and that all cannot get to the top. And finally, let's realize that it's going to be a struggle into which we must put the best effort that we can muster. C. R.

The elect! ical engineering student, who has been a high scorer on Union cage teams for two sea- sons, is president of the Stu- dent Counci:J and w0rks in Hale · House. His duties have enabled him to attend only one practice 1. week, Nitchman revealed, and have forced hirn to drop basket- ball from his already crowded schedule since he feels that he cannot give the sport the neces- sary attention. Last season, Carr averaged 9.9 points for 10 games, totaling 99 to trail Co-captain Herb W!lltson by only 13 points who played in all 18 contests. Lou played his last game this :.;eason against the University of Rochester and at the tirne of his t esignation stood fourth among- lhe Garnet scorers with 27 points in five game.

BODENSTAB, '40 Campus Supports Finnish Relief First Four Days Of Student Drive Net $172.73 With but four days of the Finnish Relief Campaign complete, Louis J. Carr, '40, who, with Dr. David S. Morse heads the committee in charge of the solicitation of funds, reported today that a total of $172.73 had been received from fra- ternities, dormitories, faculty mem- bers and members of the college secretarial staff. Sponsored by the Student Coun- cil, the drive will be concluded on Friday. The proceeds of the c<.m- pa!gn will be used for civilian re- lief alone most of which will be forwarded to Finland through a committee fm· Finnish Relief head- ed by former President Herbert C. Hoover. Faculty Committee Named Fraternity house representatives, as wei! as representatives from the formitories, were appointed by Carr to assist him in the war!{ of collecting and soliciting funds. The faculty committee included: Dr. Morse, Dr. Gordon R. Silber, Dr. E. K. Bacon, Dr. Ernest E. Dale, .Professor 0. J. Farrell, Dr. Everett W. Thatcher, Professor F. C. Chill- rud, Professor E. S. C.

Bodenstab Names Seventeen Seniors To Manage Drive The Young Alumni Support cam- pa·ign of the class of 1940 to in\ crease Union's endowment wi11 be- gin within the next week, Senior Class .Pre:;ident Ernest W. Baden- stab, chairman of the committee in charge of the campaign an- nounced yesterday. The drive will be conducted along essentially the same lines followed by the class of 1939, originators of the \young alumni\ plan oJ sup- port, Bodenstab indicated. Each member of the Senior Class will be appr·oached .by a committee repre- sentative and will be asked to sign a pledge catd as an indication of his wilHngnesti to subscribe to the plan. As in last year's drive, seniors will be offered alternate methods of participating. Under the regu- lar pledge plan, pledgees ag1ee to contribute $10 annually for ten yeats following graduation, while under the :special insurance policy an angement students subscribe to a regular life insurance policy with the stipulation that Union College rather than the insured, receive $100 of the policy dividends. The face value of the policy and the time which must elapse before t·he college receives its $100 share of the dividends vary with the ar- rangements offeted by cooperating insurance companies. No Legal Obligation In the event that a pledgee en- ters graduate school after leaving Union these annual payments are postponed until he has completed his studies. \There is,\ said Baden- stab, \no binding legal obligation to compel a student to fulfill his pledge and while we feel confident that every subscribing student will be as good as his word if, for some reason, he is una·ble to make his annual contributi0n he is under no obligation, save a moral one, to do so., \I believe that the class of 1940 will show at least 100% improve- ment over the record of the class of 1939 which received pledges from 60 of its members,\ he said, basing his ·prediction on the fact that this year's committee is start- ing work on the project months earlier than <lid the committee in charge of last spring's campaign. The seniors who are serving on the committee include: Wallace Baker, Anthony Barbieri, Frederic!{ Burns, Burdick Brittin, Louis Carr, Robert Eisner, Sheldon Evans, Merlin Fay, Everett Hafner, Ed- wa·rd Kane, Richa-rd Kearns, George Miller, F1·ederick .Patrie, Lawrence Pellettier, Thomas Rals- ton, Chester Robinson and Angelo Sederis.

The classes will continue under the direction of Dr. George Dwight Kellogg, Chairman of the Field of Ancient Classics. President Fox intermingled anec- dotes concerning his own experi- ences as a public speaker with general advice to his listeners. \No public speaker likes to be called an orator,\ President Fox said, explaining that the function of a good public speaker is to con- vince his audience that his ideas are sound, not that he has oratori- cal ability. He continued with a discussion of the techniques of re- cent chapel speakers and outlined basic requirements for the suceess- ful preparation and presentation of a speech. . Discusses Utilities \Many problems dealing with the regulation of .public utilities are still unsolved,\ Public Service Com- missioner George R. Lunn told an informal group of government stu- dents in Hale House. The group was a class in State and Local Government, taught by Dr. Vernon A. O'Rourke. Socialist Mayor of Schenectady in 1912, and a congressman from 1916-18, Mr. Lunn has been a Pub- lic Service Commissioner for New York State during the past fifteen years. Mr. Lunn suggested that utilities be given \some incentive\ to get a larger return from their property, as under the present regulations a utility is limited to a six per cent return. Any excess profit is eliminated by a reduction in rates charged to the consumer. He sug- gested that \if a company earns seven per cent, one-half of the ex- cess should go to the stockholders and one-half to the rate-payers, thus supplying an ihcenti've for good bUsiness management.\ In conclusion Commissioner Lunn stated that the generai pubiic gen- erally has no right to charge utili- ties With \exorbitant\ or \discrimi- natory\ prices.

Issue Editor ........................................ James Twining Assistants Granger Tripp Armand Fiegenbaum Robert Hayner Tuesday, February 6, 1940 AFFAIRS In 1935, that hectic year when Ethiopia was awakenec:IJ from its Middle-Age slumber by an Italian invasion, and when the Lea-gue of Nations groped about for a puni- tive policy which it was determined not to carry out, the :Balkan Herald appeared in December with 1Jhese headJ.ines: \1935 was historic year for the Balkans\. The Herald· went on to say in one o.f its columns: \Rumania in 1935 was politically the quietest of the Balkan coun- tries. But the Italian war on Abys- sinia . . . has pt oduced con t11ovet-sy in commercial as well as political circles, for Rumania is a large ex- porter of oil, timber, and agricul- tural products to Italy.\ By merely substituting \Euwpean wars\ for \Italian war on Ethiopia\ and \all European belligerents\ in place of \Italy\, we get EOme idea of the Balkan problem In 1940. The Ba-lkan nations ate the \rug- ged individualists\ of Europe. Jeal· ous of their in'd ependence, and ex- tremely envious of their· neighbors they have always been a source of friction. In 1912 they united long enough to drive Turkey practically out of Europe, only to let Turkey ct eep back when they began to fight over the spoils. In 1914 the Balkans provided one of the imme- diate causes of the World War, and fouad themselves on opposite side;: when the struggle came. Today the Balkans ate once more a sore spot in Europe. This is not surprising. Whenever rich resources are com- bined with internal disEenEicn the result is bound to .be a clash of in- tet ests on the part of the great in- dustrial powers, partic!llarly i.f the:): are at war. The Balkan nations should have learned long ago that their strength lies in unity and co- operation, but at this late date it is still very doubtful whether they have ::een the sagacity of sacrific- ing individual to group interests. LaEt ·sunday marked the end of a series of conferences conducted by the Balkan entente at Belgrade, Yugoslavia.

IN THE MAIL To the Ed·itor: Are we or a.re we not a neutral people? This question has appar- ently been answered in the nega- tive here at Union. Else how can we countenance the movement which has recently received a great deal of support on the campus, namely the drive for contributions for the relief of the poor, starving Finns. If we are to be truly neutral, as most Americans <deluded fellows) claim we are, does it not follow that we should do the same for the poor. freezing Russians. Unless all the newspapers in this country, are maliciously propagating prevarica- tions, the Finns are in much more comimtable condition than the Russians. Seriously, though, I can see no logical reason for openly sending aic! to one of the belliger- ent countries in Europe, whatever our sentiments. Such an action cannot, by any stretch of the im- agination, be said to harmonize with a true neutrality. Besides violating our neutrality, such action only serves to ·build up among our people a feeling and emotionalism which we should strive to subdue at such critical times as these. By starting such movements to \do our bit\ insigni- ficant as they may seem at the moment, we are only opening the way toward the day when we de- cide to join the great conflagration. and \do our bit\ by offering our lives on the altar of Mars.

Hamilton, boasti-ng a fast break- ing, alert sextet, outplayed the Gar- net in a rough melee before a gay winter carnival crowd. Sonny Dale, sophomore wing, scored two of the three Continental tal'lies unassisted. The stellar play of Goalie Dull Holmes kept the scoring at a mini- mum. The home team monopolized the play throughout the entire first pe- riod, notching two goals. The Gar- net returned in the second period to threaten Ed Remis, Hamilton goalie, but the rubber didn't find the nets. Several fights broke out in the third period while the play con- tinued briskly. Late in the game, Holmes was hit by a flying puck and temporarily knocked out; he returned to the game after a short rest. Win Rubber Game from Lardes With Joe Russom and Jim Smith ta;llying for the Garnet, Union took the rubber game in a three game series from the St. Lawrence sex- tet by 2 to 1. Russom scored un- assisted while Bob Baker passed to Smith for the .second goal. The Dutchmen had previously lost to the Larries 4 to 3 at Lake Placid but later defeated them 7 to 1 in Schenectady.

Moure, a member of the sta.te labor relations board, said that he heartily agreed with Mr. Groat 1 e- garding the proposed a·mendments, com paling the act to the Constitu- tion of the United States which has been amended 21 times. He ex- plained, \Not harm, but good would be dune by modifying t·he state- ment of policy of the act. Since we· have always given careful attention to every petition from an employet· we have not the slightest objec- tion to having our investigations of :;uch petitions mandatoty.\ Groat Citt>s Labor Disputes Groat, counsel to the Ives Joint Legislative Committee on Indus- t-rial and Labor Relations, related his many experiences during the past two years in w-hich disputes bet ween worl!ez·s and employers wer·c I esolved when the state labor relations act was thoroughly ex- plained fO that each group knew it:> rights. He suggested that some sy~tematic means be authorized fo1 educating .both the employers and em·ployees as to theii· rights under the state act. Later, Moote added, \I further agree with Mr. Groat's suggestion that thet e should be a lowering of the barriers which seem to discour- age conferences between employers and wo1 kers. Such conferences can injure no one so long a.s there is in thPm no element of coe1·cion 01 re- stt·aint by the e-mployer.\ The only difference of opinion evidenced by the two ,;peakers azo:;e over a technicality. Mr. Moore. who was tec·hnical adviser and acting director of the National La bar Rei a tions Board f1 om 1933 to 1937, referred to the New York State Act as the \little Wagner Act,\ which Mr. Groat contended it wa;:; not, explaining that the :;tate act was far more broad and \equita·ble\ in it> operation than the :-Ia tiona! Act. Dr. Johnson Reported 'Resting Comfortably' The condition of Dr. Burges Johnson, chairman of the Field of English, was reported a:; much improved late yesterday.

Loudon, exchange scholar from St. Andrews Univer- sity, Scotland, de,;cribed his alma mater in war time and drew a comparison of the two institutions in a·n address to the student body in assembly Wednesday. \St. Andrews in war time is very different fl'Om St. Andrews in peace time,\ Loudon Eaid. \Right now 75 1 ;f of the men students are freshmen; the other 25% are en-. gaged either in completing their degr ee.s m· in research. In Britain medical students who have com- pleted their second year are exempt from military conscription until they have finished their course. Women predominate ... because there has been an influx of women meciical students from the Univer- ,;.ity of London. Sports have conse- quently -been affected by this and not only is the .standar.d poorer but the match schedules have been greatly curtailed. Nightly Blackouts \Eve1y night there dre b!a~kouts There are never any lightE :n the street, and every room io; blanketed with thick curtains to avoid even the slightest escape of lights. When car·s are out at night, they may use dim lights only or special blue bulbs which can 'be se<'n only at a range of 50 yards.\ Women students nave to be in at 10 o'clock, an hour earlier than men, and movies end by then. All the big dances for this year have been cancelled, although a special concession was extended at Christ- mas time, he said. \An air raid siren has been placed in a central position ·in the Quadrangle. Should a warning be gn en during class hourE, t'he pro- fe~sor an<l students rise quietly and walk to the air raid shelters which I have been constructed under the Graduation Hall.\ Townsend and Epstein Will Debate Relative Merits of Old Age Plans Dr .Francis E. Townsend ,author~--------------­ of the Townsend Plan for old age security, and Abraham Epstein, na- tional secretary of the American Association for Social Security, will discuss \Which is the Better Provision for Old Age, the Town- send Plan, or the Federal Social Security Act?\ at the Empire State Town Meeting of the Air to be held in the Old Chapel. Sun- day, at 3 o'cloclt. Dr. Townsend, who fostered the plan :which bears his name will discuss his widely publicized meth- od of levying a sales tax to raise the money for distribution to the aged, who will in turn, be required to spend it within a month, thus theoretically aiding bu~iness in general. Mr. Epstein is the national execu- tive officer of the association which organized oentiment that led to the adoption of the present Federal Social Security Act. The editor of the monthly publicat.ion, \Social Security,\ Mt. Epstein is also a frequent contributor to leading na- tional magazines, including \Cur- rent History,\ \The American Mercury,'; \The New Republic,\ and \T'he Nation,\ DR. FRANCIS E. TOWNSEND store at 751 State Street. For oc- casional br•owers, for those who come with a specific idea of what they want to buy, or for these happy citizens who merely want to tal·k, Mr. Robson is always ready, willing, and able to converse with anyone about anything. Former associate in the firm of Robson and Adee, Printers, of Schenectady and Saratoga, he has learned much about local history, in which many Union alumni have figured. Among his many anecdotes is one which describes an under- graduate prank on the campus about twenty years ago: a band of students broke into the base- ment of the library and filched a collection of plaster busts of an- cient Greek philosophers and poets. The merry marauders, feeling no ~ompunction about havi-ng broken up this learned colloquium, toted the brittle likenesseE out onto the baseball diamond, at that time sit- uated on Library Field, and perch- Conde Describes Massacre of 1690 Local Historian Portrays Destruction Of Schenectady Edwin G. Conde, Schenectady historian and graduate of Union in the class of 1893, yesterday de- scribed in daily a.ssembly the mas- sacre and destruction of the city of Schenectady which occurred 250 years ago. The speaker described in detail the plan of the city, the popula- tion and the quarrel between liberal and conservative landowners which resulted in the gates of the little frontier outpost being unguarded. Describing the approach of the French and Indians and their at- tack, Mr. Conde sa:id, \Sixty per- sons, men, women, and children, met death before the first fury of the savages abated .... The sav- ages took 27 p1 isoners back to Canada. The raiders lost but two men in the :;ack of the town, but l4 more were killed by Mohawlt warrior·s who pursued them almost to the gates of Montreal.\ The only persons not harmed in the raid, said the speaker, were the members of the Glen family who dwelt just across the river, and who were spared because of the kindness >hown to French prisoners. In conclusion, the historian stated: \Thie briefly, is the story of the Schenectady massacre, the greatest calamity that had befallen the colony up to that time. The invasion is said to have been the deepest inroad ever made by a foreign foe in territory that is now the United States of America.\ Mr. Conde will address the mem- bers of the Schenectady chapter of the alumni association. next Tues- day night, on the history of Union College. ---0,--- Dr. Blodgett Contributes To Whitman Exhibit Dr. Harold W. Blodgett has con- tributed five items to the current Walt Whitman Exhibition in the Library of Congress. Because of the wide attention attracted by the exhibit it will be held over for sev- eral months. The exhibition commemorates the 120th anniversary of the poet's birth, and Dr. Blodgett's work, \Walt Whitman in England,\ de- scribes Whitman's r<:cognition as a great poet by such famous Eng- liEh literary figures as Rossetti, Swinbm ne and Tennyson long be- fore he achieved any degree of fame in America. Dr. Blodgett's contribution which is on exhibition together with four articles on vari- ous aspects of the same subject, first appeared in \The American Mercury,\ \American Literature\ and the \Dartmouth College Alumni Monthly.\ ed t•hem p1·ecariously on pedestals at the bases. According to M-r. Robson, \there was Socrates on thil'd, Plato holding down the home- plate, and some other Greek pitch- ing for the Acrop:Jlis Nine.\ He recalled the glamorous hey- day of the passenger traffic on the old Erie Canal with a story 0f how one of the great land-marks point- ed out to sight-eee1·s. on the canal boats was Union College. Mr. Roil:;on, Known familiarly in Schenectady at \L.H.S .. \ has c0me. to know a score of tales ab0ut the college, among whi~h is one of the trouble Eliphalet Nott had keep- ing his turkeys from being adopt- ed by undergraduates for their Thanksgiving dinners. One such incident was climaxed by the s-hrewd old doctor's recapture of the stolen bird and his invitation of the culprits to a holiday feast where they had to dine on their own stolen goods. His version of the reaeon the stucco has clung so steadfa.stly to the walls of North and South College dormitories is because the architects, before they applied the stucco preparation, mixed it with, of all things, skimmed milk.

Members of the Executive Committee of the Union Student Council will be the guests of the executive group of the Student Union of the Rensselaer Poly- technic Institute on Sunday eve- ning. This joint meeting marks· an- other in the series of steps being taken by student leaders of both institutions to foster more cor- dial relations between the col- leges. The two executive groups w-ill dine in a Troy re~taurant and · following dinner will adjourn to the student club rooms on the Troy campus to discuss matters of common interest. A report of this joint will be made at the Council meeting on night. meeting Student Monday Council to Act On Campus Chest Design for Uniform Key Will Be Considered At Meeting Monday The recently proposed plans for the organization of a Campus Community Chest will be among the several matters to be discussed by the Student Council in its Feb- ruary meeting which is to be held in the Civil Engineering Building at 7:45 on Monday evening. The plans for the concerted char- ity drive, as outlined in Tuesday's issue of The Concordiensis, were, with minor changes, approved by. the Executive Committee of the Council in its meeting on Tuesday night, and will be submitted to a vote of the Council itself on Mon- day. To Discuss Honor System The committee appointed to sug- gest a design for the uniform ac- tivities key will offer drawings of the design it has chosen for the approval of the Council. The award has been designed by Don- ald Campbell, '40, who worked in conjunction with representatives of the tax-supported activities which grant keys to members. A motion will also be made to amend Article III, Part 2 of the Constitution of the Council which states: \The first meeting of the new academic year shall take place on the first Wednesday in Octo- ber ... \ The amendment which is to be offered would place the date of the initial meeting in Sep- tember. A proposal calling for an inves- tigation of the feasibility of in- troducing an honor system will also be 0ffered for the consideration of the group. This suggestion was ap- proved by the Executive Commit- tee at its Tuesday meeting. 'Tune Detective' DR.

USI( 'Tune Detective' Will Trace Sources Of Modern Songs Sigmund Spaeth, the \Tune De- tective\ of the radio and one of the most active figures in American mu~ic, will lecture tonight at 8 o'clock in Memorial Chapel on the subject \Fun in Mucic.\ Dr. Spaeth's lecture is sponsored joint- ly by Union College, the Schubert Club and the Thursday Musical Club. Dr. Spaeth is the author· of sev- er a! beaks on music, ranging from disEertations on the claEEics to hu- morous appraiEals of populaor mu- sic. As Dean of the Wurlitzer School of Mmic, largest institution of its kind, he heads a nationwid'e enter prise of thirty thousand mu- sic students. He is at present the president of the :i'olational Associa- tion for American Composers and Conductors, having succeeded Law- l'ence Tibbett in this ·position, and is also the chairman for the Na- tional Committee for American Music. Music Critic One of the most interesting phases of Dr. Spaeth's musical ca- reer has been his participation in trials involving musical plagarism. Bee a use of his a•bility to \ferret out\ the sources of melodies, he is frequently called to testify in law suits involving alleged stolen or copied songs. Bot n in Philadelphia of musical parents, Dr. Spaeth -became ac- quainted with music at an early age, playing the piano, violin and other instruments and later singing in choirs and glee clubs. On his graduation from Haverford College in 1905, he became a teacher at Princeton University, meanwhile qualifying for his doctorate of phil- osophy, by doing music research work. His knowledge and often .humor- ous approach to mueical subjects have brought him to .the attention of newspapers and he has served as the music critic and editor of several papers including the \New York Evening Mail,\ \New York Times\ and the \Boston Tran- script.\ In addition to his news- paper· work he has served in the capacity of music editor for \Mc- Call's Magazine,\ \Life \The Liter- ary Digest\ and \Esquire\ and his articles are familiar to .the readers of many magazines such as \The New Yorker,\ \Harper's \Scrib- ner's,\ and \The Saturday Evening Post.\ Author of New York March Dr. Spaeth's talent for directing the avetage person unschooled in music toward -a greater apprecia- tion is revealed particularly in his boolts. His more serious works in- clude \The Art of Enjoying Music'', \The Common 'Sense of Music\ \Music for Everybody\ \Great Symphonies\ and \Stories Behind the World's Great Music\. His lighter and mor-e humorous works are \Music for Fun\ \Read '·Em and- Weep: The Songs You Forgot to Remember\ \Maxims to Music\ \Batber Shop Ballads\ and \The Facts of Life in Popular Song.\ Recently, Dr. Spaeth wrote the words and music of \Our New York\ now recognized as the offi- cial anthem and march of the metropolis, of which Mayor La- Guardia said: \Evety New Yorker should sing this song, to express an honest pride in our city.\ ----·0--- Rochester Educator Will Spea·k Sunday Justin W.

Issue Editor ........................................... Paul Becker Assistants Gtanger T1·ipp Solomon Blechman Thomas O'Connor Friday, February 9, 1940 COMRADES BEWARE! Fellow students, are we going to sit idly by and allow our- selves to be duped by the obvious and nefarious plot of a malicious college administration? Are we to fall prey to the blandishments which these ogres wave in front of us to lure us from a normal, carefree undergraduate existence to one of their own c1·eation '? Consider comrades the insidious scheme which even to- night gets under wa,y. A di<:tbolical plot which will continue throughout the month of February, unabated. Unable to catTY on the campaign itself, the administration has enlisted the services of Dr. Sigmund Spaeth, Dr. Francis Townsend, Dr. A. K Heischauer, Governor Herbert Lehman and Dr. Cowley to aid in its foul purposes. These are certainly men to test the mettle of any student and we must be resolute in our determination not to be swayed by them-we must not, as a matter of fact, even go to see or hear them. What greater evidence of a dastardly, reprehensible motive can we find than the fact every single one of these lectures is free-- yes, comrades, free. Need we say more'? The administration has been shrewd and cunning in choosing men of such calibre to conduct its nefarious work, but the sham is a gossamer one; and patently a ruse to lure us from our dearly beloved traditional lethargy and indiffer- ence. In these attempts to achieve this odious goal what does the administration offer us'? Cultural opportunities, opportunities to hear statesmen, historians, scholars and pl'Ominent national figures! Though the lure be tempting, we must be strong, keeping in mind that we have our price- less heritage of academic and intellectual indolence to main- tain. Consider the bait waved front of us tonig-ht: Dr. Sigmund Spaeth. Although D1·. Spaeth is one of America's foremost musical experts, is famous for his ability to explain music to the uninitiated and would probably help us attain an appre- ciation that the majority of us lack, consider the sacrifice we are asked to make: the renunciation of the indifference of our predecessors! A thousand times no! No comrades, we must thwart these crude attempts with the same methods we have employed for years. We will play bridge, attend the movies, join in a bull session or \have a few with the boys,\ but we cannot weaken. What though previ- ous experiences have proved that a finesse will work once for every two attempts, that the movie formula of \boy meets girl, boy lose.s girl, boy marries girl\ has changed little in the past decade, that we have been bored by all the argu- ments, pro and con, on the inevitable bull session topics of sex and religion or that the following- day always leaves us wishing that the previous evening had been a more temper- ate one--no matter how jading these defense measures he- come we must be Spartans, brace ourselves to the ordeal, follow our sacred tradition and stay away. -or should we?

For when it comes to carrying parapher- nalia ranging from pick axes to flour and bacon, they're tops. But good as burros can be, they haven't a chance in modern large-scale mining opera- tions; they're completely out in the cold. Electric shovels and dredges, for example, are part of one California company's equip- ment. Scooping out the pay dirt in great gulps, the shovel dumps it into barges containing the recovery machinery-and there's the gold. Aiding such modern miners are G-E engi- neers, Test men and ex-Test men alike. For this particular job they supplied a motor-generator set, a hoisting motor, and various contl'ol and auxiliary units. What chance has the lowly burro? GHASTLY REALITY T HE citizens of Schenectady, General Electric's headquarters, have long been looking at the giant that is radio a,nd say- ing, \I knew him when!\ For G-E radio engineers have made scores of important contributions to radio progress. Now they are gtvmg Schenectadians some- thing new to boast of in a radio way. These engineers, headed by C. A. Priest, Maine '25 and ex-Test man, will soon put in opera- tion a station based an the revolutionary \frequency modulation\ system of broad- casting developed by Edwin H. Armstrong. Among the features of this new system are extremely high fidelity, better signal cover- age, and virtual elimination of static. In fact, so life-like was a recent demonstration broadcast that an English journalist simply said, \It was ghastly in its reality.\ GENERAL fj ELECTRI.Q Page Three Frosh Complete Hockey Season The yearHng hackey players hung up theit· skates yesterday after- noon when their final game of the oea,;on with Albany Academy was cancelled because of bad weather condition~. This leaves the fresh- men with a season record of two wins at the ex,pense of the Dar- row and Hoosac Schaols and one l0~s at the hands of the Albany Academy puck chasers. The freshmen scored a total of twelve points, averaging four each game, and were scored on !'even times, five 0f them by Albany Acad- emy. Bo'b Cooch, ~peedy center for the Garnet yearlings was high scorer with five goals, scored againsl Darrow Scho0l. Fred Wik- off was next with three goals, = whi'Ie Bob Gt•otmdwater, Norm Fox, Carson Thompson and Bob Shep- herd each tallied once. The freshmen opened their Eea- son against the Hoosac Schaal on January 13, winning, 4-1. Fred Wik- off starred in this contest pushing the puck into the net three times as N<H'm Fox scored once. In its sec0nd :otaTt of the season the year- ling sextet was easily overpowered by a strong and capable Albany Academy olitfit, 5-1. B0b Ground- water 5aved the freshmen from be- mg shutout when he scored in the closing minutes. The fre::hmen clos- ed their schedule on January 27, when they shellacked the Darrow School 7-1. Cooch scored five times and Thompson and Shepherd each tallied once.

President Speaks for Trustt>'-\S Dr. Fox's letter follows: It would be hard to make cleat how deeply gratified the Trustees alumni and other friends of Union ate to find that the Class of 1940 is so resolutely with them in the com- panionship of loyalty on which the financial future of out coUege so much depends. W-ith the fairy god- fathels and godmoth{:1'S being tax- ed oul of cxi<>tence, we m.ust lUi n to the living endowment supplied each year by the host of men who believe that Union is good enough to be made better by their modest, but 1 eliably anticipated, individual gifts. Modest the individual annual gift may be, but if every former student of Union. Col!ege were plac- ing ten dollars each year to our col!ege funds it would mean as much as an additional endowment of $1,625,000; it would increase om resources by over a third. We could have more professors and thus more wo1k with individual students. We could have a larger lib1ary and better equipped laboratories, mote adequate gymnasium facilities, more scholarships, more placement aid, more of nearly everything we need. The individual as well as the Col- lege, in these enlightened days lives on a budget. He has to calcu- late the percentage of $10 in his expected income. I! it is $1COO the first year, $10 represents one per cent; within their first decade as alumni most men hope to rise wei! beyond $2000, when the payment would represent one-half of one per cent.

Union; R.P.I. Delegates Meet Executive Committees Of Student Groups Discuss Problems With the object of establishing bette1· relation<> between the two in- dit utions, the executive committees of the Ren»Jelaer Polytechnic In- :>titute Union and t!-:e Student Council of Union College met Sun- day night in the Rensselaer club 10oms for an informal discussion. Methods of encouraging better understanding were ::;ubmitted, sev- et'al of which may be put into ef- fect in the near future. One of these was the suggestion that stu- dent a>sPmbly ~peakers be ex- changed. It was also proposed that each college send a man to the othet's freshman camp in the hope that by Coing this, the \destruc- tive\ type of tivalry will be dis- couragPd from the .s-tart. The ic]ea of holding more meet- ings of a similar nature was put forth aF a means of creating good will. Both gt·oup<' agreed that the practice should be continued. The possibility and advisability of Union and R. P. I. booking \big name\ bands on successive nights, maldng for a substantial savings for bo-th colleges was t'horoughly discussed. The two executive committees also compared the forms of student governments that are in existence at R. P. I. and Union, and dis- cussed cooperative buying for .fi a- ternities, hospitalization and rush- ing. ~~~~~--~~-- Author of Pe.nsion Plan Claims Social Security Is 'Vicious' Act Denouncing the FedN·aol Socia·! Security Act as \the most vicious most harmful piece of legislation ever enacted\ and \such a hodge podge that ie only fit for the scrap heap,\ D1. Francis E. Town.send, author of the Townsend Old Age Revolving Pensionf PJa.n, staunchly suppotted his own ideas at the Em- pire State Town Meeting in Old Chapel on Smoday. Dr. Townsend outlined tr.e pro- visions of his \new\ plav which would provide to everyone ove1 the age of 60 on a pro-rata basis the income fl om a levy of 1\, c. per cent u·pon the \gross incom-:\ of every per.son earning $250 or more pe1 month. Under such a plan, the 1ged would receive $5@ a rr.onth instead of the $200 he has advo- cated their l'PCeiving for the pa;t ~ix yeats. Illustrating his observations that a Ceca de ago not even 10 COO old men and women were given public ~upport outside the poorhouses and that today 2,000.000 cf om aged re- ceive old age .grant:;, Ab1aham Epstein, executive secretary of the American A,;sochtion for Social SecUI·ity, pointed to the progreso that ha,; been mace by the United State:; in the pa<t uecaCe in caring fo1 the aged. A retum postca1d has been attached to the one bearing the president's messa-ge, and parents will be asked to indicate whethet they pt efet· to bear costs of possible illne:,-·s them- selve~, m· whethet· they would favot· a coopet·ative ;y;;tem. The postca-rds are now being prepared and will be rl'ady f01 distribution within a few days, A plan similar to the one pro- posed has been used at R. P.

The papers represented were the Rens- selaer Polytechnic Institute \Poly- technic,\ the New Yorl~: State Col- lege for Teachers \State News,\ the St. Rose College \Rosavarian the Russell Sage \Quill the Skid- more \News\ and The Concordien- sis. The delegates held two discussion meetings during the afternoon in Silliman Hall and were the guests of President and Mrs. Dixon Ryan Fox at a tea. An informal dinner in Hale House and attendance at the Union - Hamilton basketball garnP compktPd tht' prog-ram. At the first of the two discus- sions, points of mutual interest were brought to the floor by mem- bers of each delegation. Included among the topics considered were make-up, personnel, expenses, ad- vertising policy, the use of col- umns, editorial policy and style. Papers from each institution were examined and comparisons drawn. After tea at the p~esident's house, the group returned to Silliman Hall where Mr. Peter Bradley, city edi- tor of the Schenectady \Union- Star,\ delivered a short address. Most college editors, Mr. Bratl- ley pointed out, do not consider to any gL·eat extent those reading the Mr. Pett>r Bradl(ly, city editor of the Schenectady \Union Star\ spealting befOl'e the delegates to the six college newspaper confer·- t\nce which was hf'ld on the campus Saturday afternoon. paper who have not so close a con-I Mr. Bradley's talk was mainly de- tact with the campus as do the stu- voted to style and make-up of the dents, the result being that proper coi!ege paper.

If efforts to obtain Miller should prove unsuccessful, Mackenzie said, the Prom Committee would ne- gotiate with two other orchestra!:, already under consideration. During last week, the Prom Com- mittee circulated a ballot on which students -were asked to designate their choice for Prom band, Miller's name was not included on that list. The lead-ing bands on the poll were those of Jimmie Dorsey and Jan .Savitt. ----0~--~- Reischauer to Present Spencer Lecture Dr. August Karl Reischauer, for- mer eL ucat ional missionary to Japan, will deliver the second Icha- bod Spencer lectme in the Old Chapel at 8:00 o'c!ocl{, Friday eve- ning, on the subject \The Impond- erable Elements In the Conflict in Eru:t Asia,'' A graduate of Hanover College, the University of Chicago and New York University, Dr. Reischauer was professor of teligion at the Hihon Shingal{ko, founder and ex- ecutive secretary of the Woman's Christian College in Japan, and has written several books on the reli- gion of Japan including \Japanese Buddhism,\ \The Task in Japan,\ and \Pet·~onal Immot'tality,\ Student Counci:l A.p.prov-es Formation Of Ca:mpus Chest For Annual Drive Ur-~if-orm Key Design Accepted at Meeting; Carr Submits Oral Report on Dinner Of Union, R.

The group voted in favor of appointing the chairman of the annual concerted chal'ity dl'ive rather than electing him as vvould be the case undet· the altemate plan offered in the ol'ganization of the Chest, and approved a mo- tion to remove the scholarship loan fund from the list of organizations eligible for a shm·e of the campaign proceeds. ------~ The uniform key design, as pre- Spea.ker Outlines N S FA Functions Louise Beinietti Skidmore Delegate To Annual Congress Miss Louise Beinietti, member of the senior class at Skidmore Col- lege, addr\esse.d the assembly in chapel this morning, relating the functions of the National Student Federation of America. As a repre- st>ntative of Skidmore at tht' an- nual NSFA congress at the Uni- vt>rsity of Minnesota this past De- Ct'mbei·, Miss Beinietti stated that conferences of this nature \pro- vide an opportunity to collect widespread viewpoints on any sub- ject imaginable.\ She outlined briefly in her talk the history of the founding of this organization since its .inception at Princeton University in 1925 with representatives present from 245 universities and colleges of the United States. Among the various activities of the Fe.deration to which she called particular atten- tion was, the \NSFA Reporter\; official publication of the organ- ization, which recently published a survt>y of the nation's college pro- fessors with respect to their varied systems of grading. Or·cht>stra St>rvict> One of the most practical aspects of the Federation, she said, was the function of an orchestra serv- ice, which was established in order to help smaller colleges obtain good and even top-ranking bands for their dances. Since the activities of the organ- ization were aided by the estab- lishment of a national office in 1928, Miss Beinietti stated that it is evident that the National Stu- dent Federation has serious objec- tives in view. \Colleg.e people are really preparing themselves to meet the problems which will arise in thP futm·e,\ she said, ---0--- Schenectady To Be Scene Of Home Football Games Union College has accepted an offer of the Schenectady public school system to play its home football games on the Mont Pleas- ant gridiron this fall, Director of Athletics, J. Harold Wittner, an- nounced last night. Groups who feared that the Col- lege might accept one of the Al- bany Stadia to play its home games during the reconditioning of Alex- ander Field, expressed their ap- proval of the final outcome of the situation. One of these groups, the Schenectady Chamber of Com- merce public relation committee, headed by Robert L. Gibson, had paTtkulHdy uq.;o·d that the home games be pla~·ed in this city. Mr. Wittner explained that Mont Pleasant High School field offers facilities comparable to those at both Blee!{er and Hawldns •Stadia in Albany, and has the added ad- vantase of keeping the games in Schenectady. This is more advan- tageous not only for the students and faculty, but also for the towns- people and merchants who have supported Union football in the past, Mr. Wittner added. 'The college will transport some of its bleachers to the Mont Pleas- ant field in order to accommodate lal'gel' Cl'owds in the fail, pared by Donald Campbell, '40, was accepted by the Council. Copies of this design will be sent to firms Pngaged in the manufacture of such awards who will be aslwd to submit estimates as to the price of sup- plying the keys, Chairman Carr submitted an oral report of the joint dinner of the Executive Committees of the Rens- 'elaer Union of R.P.I. and the Union College Student Council which took place in Troy on Sun- day night. Orchestra Bookings In addition to discussing mutual problems and considering methods of fostt'ring more cordial relations bPtWPen Union and R.P.I., the exe- cutive groups also advanced a pro- po,;aJ calling for cooperation be- twe£'n the two schools in bool~ing an orcht>stra for the spring dances h£'ld by rach college. Accozdin3 to the proposal made at the meet- ing, Union's Junior Prom and R.P.I.'s Sophomore Soiree would be held during one week-end so that the ~arne orche<tra could be sign- ed fm· both functions, thereby ef- fecting a lower rate than is pos- siblt> with the current system un- det· which each institution books an Oleht>:<!ra independently of the othet·. Provisions would be made to altemate the date of the dances so that the Prom would be held on Friday one year and· on Saturday in the following year witn the Soit·ep being scheduled on Saturday wht>n the Prom is held on Friday, and vice versa. This is the same method which has- been UBecl by Middlebm-y College and the l.':.i- versity of Vermont in arranging their spring dances. No definite action was taken on the suggestion to establish an hon- or system at Union and after a discussion of the matter by the Council, Chairman Carr appointed a committee composed of Robert Molloy, '41, Chairman; Dudley Holmes, '41; James Smith, '41; and Bruce May, '42, to investigate the possibility of adopting such a sys- tem at Union. Mountebanks Report A report was made of the spe- cial Mounte>banks presentation o,• \The Pursuit of Happiness\ which is to be given on March 15. The proceeds of the showing, less basic royalty and operating costs, will be turned over to the Student Em- ployment Bm·eau's work scholar- ship fund, The final report on the campus dt·ive for Finnish relief showed a total contribution of $286.70. Of this amount, $67.20 was given by students while members of the faculty and college staff donated $219.50. The Fighting Fund for Fin- land, Inc, of New York City will recci\'e $104.50 of this sum and the Schenectady drive for the Finnish Relief Fund, Inc. will be given the remaining $182.20. A committee composed of Cecil Angel, '41, Chairman; Chester Rob- inson, '40; Gem·ge Peck, '40; Chris- tophE>r M. Fahy, '40; A. Drennan Kay, '42, and George Anderson, '42, was appointed to consider the pos- stbtlity of amending the Council's constitution, This group will con~ sider changes in the section which places the date of the first Coun- cil meeting of the academic year in October, and will investigate the practicability of electing and in- ducting. a new council in the spring instead of electing the group in the spring and delaying its initial meet- ing until the fall, as is now the case. In respon~;~e to a request by Freshman Class President Bruce May, the group agreed to under- write any deficit which might be incurred by the class of 1943 ih sponsoring a dance to be held on March 9.

P. I. Student l'nion and om· O\Vll Student Coun- cil on Sunday night when, in an attempted whispe1·, he con- fided to a friend, \Hell they'1 e pt·etty swell gents after all.\ Following the dinner, the executive groups adjoumed to the lounge of the student club house \vhere they discussed problems of common inten:st, compat·ed the respective stu- dent governments, considere<l methods of fostering better relations between the schools. The attitude of the two groups was a combination mutual rPspect, cordialit,y and sincerit,r·. Exchange assembly speaket·s were decided upon as one of the simplest methods of dispelling the lack of understanding between the two institutions, and arrangements have already been made to have 'Charles Lounsbm·y, President of the R. P. I. Student Union, ::;peak in Daily Assembly on Saturday morning. Othet· suggestions included similar speaket·s at ft·eshman camp, joint pep rallies, and probably most interesting of all, the proposal that the colleges cooperate in setting dates for their spring dances so that m·t·angements could be made to have the same band play at the two dances, thereby making possible a substantial saving in the price of the orchestra. The extention of the intramural program so as to include contests between winnet·s in the R. P. L and Union competi= tions, it was agreed, should aid in strengthening the ties be- tween the schools. Let us hope that Sunday's dinner-meeting fulfills its prom- ise of being the fit·st in a long sel'ies of pleasant and cordial relations between the Dutchmen of Union and the Engineers of R. P. I.

CHARLES F. GARIS. DPan. DISC-CUSSIONS The biggest and best news deal- ing with popular music records to auive for some time concerns the impressing of two new discs by Raymond Scott and his newly or- ganized fourteen piece orchest1 a. The four numbers are two oldies- Just a Gigolo and The Peanut Vendor, and two new ones by Scott--Hucklebt\rry Duel• and Busi- ness Men's Bounce. The arrange- ments are extremely colorful and not unlike Ute ones he used for his six-man \quintet.'' Some of the lead- ing members of the new out1it are Cht·is Griffin playing trumpet, and incidentally doing some outl'tand- ing work on Bounce, Pete Pumiglio on clarinet, Dave HatTis on tenor sax, Hnd Walter Gross at the piano. Scott's got something here! Jess Stacy's two side recording of Breeze, as a fox-trot and then as blues, i~ top-notch \jamming\. Lit- tle wondet. as most of the boys in his band come from the Bob CIOs- by crew. Stacy'.s playing on both sides is beautiful and always in the best taste, and Fazola's clarinet has never been better. . . . Andy Kirk's waxing of Getting Nowhere With You and It Always Will Be You offers nothing especially inter- esting except the usual fine vocals of Pha Terrell on the \A\ side and June Richmond on the reverse .... Johnny Green has grooved his two most popular tunes - BoQy and Soul and Out of Nowhere,--and as could be expected, they alE' Green at his frequent best. Varsity Records offers the \Var- sity Seven\ an all-star \jam\ team whic'h is heard on two new records -How Long How Long Blues, A Pretty Girl Is Ulm a Melod'Y, Sbake It and Break It, and Pom Porn. The outstanding performance on these recotds is !:he beautifully phrased and continually interesting tenor saxing of Carleton Harins, whom I .frankly believe to be Cole- man Hawkins playing under a pseudonym. Consistantly good per- formances are turned in by Danny Polo on clarinet, George Wettling on drums, Joe Sullivan at the piano. S. G. ---o--- Nixon Describes Tides Of Spiritual Life The tides of spiritual life we1 e described by Reverend Justin W. Nixon, lecturer at the Rochester- Colgate Divinity Sshool, as he as- sailed \Pessimism in Religion\ in his sermon at devotional services in Memorial Chapel Sunday morning, Reverend Mr. Nixon pointed out that interest and faith in religion increase and decrease almost re- gularly with the years. He gave as examples the remarkable religious fervor of the 12th century in Eng- land and the \atheism of college education in the 19th century.\ He stated that the 20th· century has brought a new era of religious fa:ith. \For a long time the tide of spiritual life goes out; then it comes in,\ he stated. \For long centuries we have periods of skep- ticism; then we have per1o® of be- lief,\ AFFAIRS Strange things arc happening in Europe these days. The diplomatic activities may be compat·ed to an iceberg; only an exceedingly small .portion is allowed to appear on the surface. But Europe is the land of dictatorshi·p and, consequently, cen- sorshi..p. It has fcrever been thC' land of secrecy simply because even a .-;eemingly unimportant act in one country m.ight have seii·om effp~tg in O(hPl'H if diR~O\'Pl'Pd. Jt is a land of trickery, intt·igue treachety, and double-dealing; it has fm·ever been and will appa.r- ently forevC'r be ··uch. Can thP United Sta:tes b1 ing ordet· out of chaos? Po,;si•bly, bu.t the United States means 130,000 000 peop'ie ot a good majority thereof. This does not mean that they wm a.H partici- pate directly. That is not implied in democt·acy. It does mean, how- ever, that the people will at least know why their representatives are being sent 011 a mi~sion of peace, if that be their mi~sion, and what procedut·e, generally, they int•md to follow to achieve ultimate succe~s. Some :;ecrecy is essential, of ·course, but only dm·ing the actual negotia- tions. Too much sect ecy leads to suspicion. America's ambassador to Russia, Lawrence Steinhardt, whose recall was recently demanced by a gr onp · of Congressmen as a prote:·t against the Smriet Union's invasion of Finland, is temporarily ab\'ent from his pest. Where he is no one seems to know. FirH we heaz· that he is on his way home, then he suddenly appears in Finland, and la:ter his p1 esence is r<!pOI·ted sim ul- taneously in :;everai other coun- tries. Either Stein hat dt is trave·ling faster than any man has ever travelled before, or reporte1·s are still seeing strange things. On Februm·y 17, this )C'ar, My.ron C. Taylor, the noted steel magnate. sails for Italy to take up a new post. His duty will not be a drange one. There have been 1 ep- resentatives at the Vatican before. The Pope, it will be 1 emembered, has with President Roo<evelt pro- posed many plans fot the fettle- ment of European differences. The Pope is the spiritual leader of sev- ezal hundrP.d millions of Catholics throughout the wol'!d, and as such he exerts a tt emendous in f I uence But why a delegate to the Vatican at this time? Does the President seek better relaticns with the Cath- olics, or does he hope to collabor-ate with the Pope in new peace pro- posa·ls? It is imposfible to say what is in the President's mind. It should be made clear, in all fair- ness, .that Myron Taylor goes to Italy not as American ambassador. but as personal rept·esentative of the President. Yet a few words from Roosevelt would terminate much of the .speculation, and would silence a g1·eat many rabble-rousers who see in the P1 e<ident's gesture evetything from an alliance with the Catholic against Russia to the humble submission of the United States to the .sovereignty of the Pope. On the same ship with Taylor will be Sumner Welles, A.~sistant Secretary of State, who is going to Europe to visit the capitals of at least four imp01tant countries. What is the purpose of hi.s visit? No one can say. We only know in which countries he is going to stop and that Soviet Russia is conspic- uous .by its absence. Many observ- ers see in Welles' departm·e a re- enactment of the wot k of Colonel House before the la~t war. They do not heEitate to remind us that House was entir·ely unsuccessful in his attempts to avert hcstilities and that the United States was in the conflict by 1917. There is, how- ever, one great difference between House and Welles, and it compli- cates matte1s Eomewhat now. House travelled as merely a priv- ate, American obset·ver, reporting his findings to Pt esident Wilson. Welles holds the official position of Assistant Sec1etary of State. HE', too, travels as a representative .of the President, but even though he is to have no right to make treaties or agreements of any kind it is hard fot• Americans and even more so for people of other nations to distinguish in their minds .between Welles, the private citizen, and Welles, the Assistant Secretary of State. Ame1 icans are constantly being called upon to make decisions through elections on vital problems which confront the nation. How can they do this when they have no way of knowing what is taking place about them? Our interests as Americans are firmly bound up with those of the President and the State Department. We gain to- gether and lose together. Democ- racy commands that we pay with our lives if necessary for their mis- takes, but democracy commands also that we ·have a part in them. And so we say, \Mr. President, we are willing to assume our share of the burden. Tell us, therefore: Why is Myron Taylor going to the Vati- can at this time, and what will he attempt to do? What is the nature of the work which Sumner Welles r is about to undertake? Where is 1 Lawrence Steinhardt and why?\ Alumni to M·eet At Dinner Tonight, Conde and Bronner Scheduled to Speak: Hamiltor:. Men l:nvited ANNALS OF ST. ANDREWS By JOHN P.

One fourth }·ear mc.n herP who h~.d expected to get a comn:is- sion in the artillery in March has now been informed that vacancie~ in that ~ervice seem to be a matte1 of the di>'tant future, and that his best altet native for \eat']}·\ partici- pation is entry into the signal corps. Having a:ccepted this advice, he will be called up \some time alter March\ will receive \two ot' three months elementary training\ \eight months specialized training\ and perhaps see active set·vice in theh spring cf 1941. There seems to be a fairly .strong belief current in the country that there will be no active service to entei' a year from this spring. Per::onally we call such prophecies pathetic optimism. The local calling-up situation took an even more ironical turn this week when the editor of the 'vat·sity magazine, a conscientious objector, went into his uniform months befm·e the embryo office1·s. Beca:u;;e of his sentiments he volun- teered fo1 the Royal At·my Medical Corps, and will pr·obably be in F1·ance in two and a half months. Of cou!'se the whole pictm e will be revised if an active spring cam- paign entails a heavy officer casu- alty list. The Amez :.::an Consul in Dundee gave us something of a shock this last Wednesday by coolly inform- ing us that om passport had ·be- come invalid at the cutbr eak of war and that whether the \state department\ as he rather grandly called himself, would extend it was an extremely problematic matter. We had visions of ourself either making a premature depa1 ture from the land of the Scots or, hav- ing ignored the Fot eign Service of the United States, being smuggled back into the country this summer. Iiowever the cloud.s dispersec! wnen the consul mentioned that he came from Wells, Vt., just across the border from Washington County; thus we have om· passport extend- ed until late July, but only after being sworn, · photographed, and finger-printed.

Bill Davi~. Bob Henry and Rich Geer accounted for Hamilton's spurt with three set shots. Rcore Is Tied Once again the score was !matted at 20 all as the two teams scored almost alternately in rapid succession. From this point on, Union built up a lead which was never threatened by the Buff and Blue quintet. Watson did much to start the Garnet drive, scoring three successive baskets after one by Buchanan to run the score to 28-20. The half ended with the Dutchman lead increased to 35-21 on baskets by Turchick and Wat- son and a foul shot by Buchanan. Union increased its margin by 10 points in the second half with Watson making eight points, Bu· chanan, seven and Palmer, six. Charley Keane tried to keep Ham- ilton in the game, but his six points were hardly enough to stem the tide. Scores by Turchick, Palmer and Buchanan helped increase Union's lead early in the second half while Henry and Keane plugged for Hamilton. Two knee injm·ies made the Buff and Blue assignment hard- er than it would ordinarily have been and many of the visitor's shots failed to drop. With about three minutes left to play, Watson and Buchanan wc1e replaced by Walt Swart and Lee Sherman. Watson was called upo~t a moment later to replace Rath- lev who was ejected from the g>'.me on fouls. Watson re-entered the game to score the Garnet's last two goals, one from his favorite set position and the other a follow-up, making it Union's victory by the largest ma- jority this year, 63-39.

P. I. Since '28 Union's va:rsity swimming team, which now boasts a record of two wins against one defeat, defeated R.P.I.'s tankmen for the first time since 1935 Saturday afternoon in Foote Memorial Pool, 42-33. The meet was decided again by the last event, the 400 yard relay, in which Captain Burt Brittin, Chucl' Passe, Ed Keers and Dave Wilder com- bined to beat the Engineers in three minutes, 56.4 seconds. The work of Captain Brittin made this win possib'ie. Swimming in the third leg of the relay, Brittin made up a seven yard deficit to give his anchor man, Passe, a two yard lead for the fourth leg. Passe easily won his race to give Union the victory of the race and the meet. Passe, besides anchoring the re- lay, took tw0 individual firsts in the 220 yard freestyle and the 100 yard freeEtyle. Brittin's performance in the relay was equalled if not ex- ceeded in his other events. He placed second by only a hair to Passe in the 100 yard freestyle and won the 50 yard freestyle equalling both the Foote Pool and Union Col- lege records with his time of 25 seconds. Harry Palml'r, number eight, flipping a succt\..ss ful toss from umler the ·basket during the Hamilton gamt> which th!' Garnet won Saturday evening. In back of Palmt>r is Jack Vannier, number seVlen. AI Turchicl<, number six, is in the foreogrotmd. Reynolds set a new R.P.I. record b~· taking the 150 yard backstroke in the time of 1:45.4. This also broke the exisiting Foote Pool rec- ord for this event. Freshmen Down Albany Academy After a slow start in which Unioa'.s freshmen had much trou- ble with both their offen::;ive and defensive play, the Garnet yearling five overpowered the Albany Acad- emy quintet in the preliminary game to the varsity contest with Hamilton in Alumni Gymnasium Saturday night. Union's trouble came during the first half while during the third quarter the cubs moved into a commanding lead an:! played steady ball throughout the last quarter of the contest to win thE'ir second game of the season, 35-21. \Beezer\ Sequin again led the freshman five scoring 12 point.s and playing inspired basketball from start to finkh. \Whitey\ Carnwright and Bob Carpenter tallied .;ig·ht and seven points, respectively, to aid the yearling cause. Mahoney and Touhey made seven points apiece to pace the Academy squa<l.. At the end o.f the first quarter Albany led Coach AI Ciampa's quintet 4 to 2, but the visitors fell behind during the second quarter which was considerably faster than the first and Union led at the half, 14 to 12. From this point on •he Garnet lead was inct·eased and proved too much for the Albany five although the two teams played even ball for most of the final quarter with Union winning by 14 points.

As has been pointed aut in these columns no one pays anything Uke the cost of his college education when he discharges his tuition bills. This is as it should be: Union Col- lege should be open to a~ many as possible; we have no desi.re to · chmge the high tuition billed at some of the women's coiiE'ges, and at Rat·d, St. John's, etc. Of course, no graduate who has paid his bills at thP Comptroller's Office \owes\ u;; anything in a legal sc>nse.

The Spen·cer lecturer is also the author of many books, the best !mown being \Personal Immortal- ity\ written in Ja.pane~:e, \Studies in Japanese Buddhism\ and \The Task in Japan\. Most of his writ- ings have centered on the problems evolving from the relations between Christianity and Buddhism. Dr. Reischauer has in addition, trans- lated many books from Japane~:e to English. Chief am<Jng these are \A Buddhist Catechism\ \Budd~ hist Gold Nuggets\ Genshin's \Ojo Yosh\ and \The Educational Work of Fore4gn Missions in Ja.pan\.

Questioned as to the failme of the bus to leave last Saturday night as scheduled, Gehrmann said that although t·here was considerable student intereE! in the expedition only twelve men signed. At least eighteen fares at fifty cents a round-trip were necessary to operate, he said.

Rev. Houghton's proposal to the freshmen, sophomot es and juniors was that they cons!det· ::pending theit· time thb :summer a,; a coun- selor in a boys camp. It makes no diffet·ence whether the camp be a charity organization 01 private es- tablishment, the important feature is the valuable experiences that can be gained from the contact with the } oung:;ters. He conl:'idered it a g1 eat joy to watch and direct the chi!dt·ens reveling in the simple I things surrounding them. Houghton ! summed up his talk by saying that, \Not only would the students gain 1 in educational value, especial!y : those who desire some insight into 1 the teaching technique, but there would also be the healthy buildup acquired through a summer in the sun which would be valuable in catTying them through the long wint-ry months in school.\ \Tho:;e who are intere>ted in , serving as counselor should make a-1 rangement::; ooon, tor the better camps are already starting to build i' up their ~tails.\ concluded Rev.

Council, Dean Approve 1 Change in Dance Date I From May 10 to II Glenn Mil'ler has signed a con- tract with the Junior Prom Com- mittee cal>ling ~or his appearance at the 1:940 Junior Prom, which will be held Saturday, May 11 between 9: p. m. and 1 a. m., it was announced today by Kenneth MacKenzie, '41,' chairman 0f the Prom Committee. The shift in the date of the Prom from Friday, May 10, necessitated by Miller's planned appearance in Buffalo on that night, was ap- PI'o:ved last night by the In terfra- ternity Council. Dean Charles F. F. Gat·is and p,residenL Dixon Ryan Fox gave their approval yesterday afternoon. Miller's contract calls for a fif-, teen hundred dollar guarantee with an additional revenue of sixty pel cent of all receipts over two thou- sand dollars. The trauitional procedure of holding the Prom on Friday eve- ning, with fraternity dances the following night, wHI of necessity be reversed this year. Dean Garis, in giving his approval of this change, announced that the fraternity dances must be over at 1:00 a. m. Signed This Morning The action of the Interfratemity Council and administrative officials in approving the date change left tne way open for Chairman Mac- Kenzie to continue negotiations with Miller for the Saturday night date. MacKenzie left Schenectady for New York late last night, meeting Miller's representatives there this morning. He telephoned his an- nouncement to the concordiensis as soon as negotiations were complete. Con£ideration of Miller began a week and a half ago when the Jun- ior Prom Committee approved the passing of pledge sheets, to deter- mine whether three hundred men would af!irm their intention of at- tending the Prom with a six dollar bid. coordinator of Student Activ- ities William W. Bennett and the Student Tax Committee gave their approval to negotiations with Mil- ler as soon as the required three hundred signatures were obtained. Glenn Miller's Orchestra has been called by the swing magazine \Downbeat\, \the most popular col- legiate band in America today\. Miller's organization skyrocketed to fame shortly after his appearance at Glen Island Casino and has since enjoyed widespread fame through the country. Because of Miller's r actio con tracts, the orchestra will not be able to broadcast from Alumni Gymnasium. ---o---- I. 0. C. A. Members to Be Guests of Outing Club Union College will be the host at the Fourth Annual Intercol- legiate Outing Club's \get-together\ next week-end, according to plans formulated at the Outing Club's Executive Committee meeting Mon- day. These week-ends have proved so successful in the past three years, that plans are being made by the Club to entertain from 50 to 75 outdoor enthusiasts from nu- metous ,colleges throughout the East. In addition to \Ski-haben the Outing Club's Cabin, a hay how in a near by barn has been procured, in order to enlarge sleep- ing facilities. The program calls for the arri- val of the skiers after supper on Friday night, and a full day of skiing on Saturday. There will be no competition of any kind, since the purpose of the meeting is for good-will and fellowEhip. On Sat- urday night, a square dance will be held, and skiers will return home Sunday night after another full day of skiing. Reservations have already been received · from contingents from Radcliffe,· Vassar, Cornell, and Skidmore, and many more are ex- pected.

GLENN MILLER Lounsbury Tells Of R. P.l. Politics For four years the National Youth Administration and the Campus Mailman it pays, have been saving college offices sub- stantial amounts yearly. Previous to this time .all inter-departmental communications went through reg- ular maH channels. Now the inter- office po~tman carries at least 50 and often as many as 250 notices, bills and inter-office communica- tions every day. According to Mls8 Frances Travis, who, as director of the stu- dent employment bureau, takes charge of the campus mail, attrib- utes the origin of the idea to Mr. Anhtony Hoadley, the college comptroller, who also provided the system's mail boxes. Craig Miller, '39, was the first Campus Mailman and held the office for two years. He was follow- ed by Johnny Cone, '40, who serv- ed throughout last year. Louis Da- cundo, '42, is this year's \Mercury Miss Travi:l said. Campus Mailmen receive $11.20 a month for their services, which take about an hour a day to complete. The adrnlnlstration b u II d i n g The mailmen p10bably average about eight miles of walking in the course of a week's work, Miss Travis said. Snow, rain, hail and the other adversities of campus transportation have thus far failed to hamper the efficiency of the mailmen's service, she added. Most of the 'special envelopes printed for the use of \Campus Mail\ contain notice:l, instructions and information, Miss Travis said, but added that Campus Mail also handles all the dormitory bills. Books and small packages often creep into the mailman's bag, as well as an occasional Christmas card These last are strictly con- trary to regulations, as ax·e com- munications to fraternity houses, which are never delivered by the mailman. \We don't want to get in trouble with Mr. Farley's organi- zation,\ said Miss Travis. Student communications are similarly ta- boo. Explains Institute's 'Combine System' In Daily Assembly \My only other comment on the 'Campus Mail' system would be to remark on its smoothness of opera- tion,\ Mr. Travis concluded. \All our mailmen have been very effi- cient, carrying out all the famous traditions of the United States Post serves as the central office for this mail-delivering system, Miss Travis Office.\ The ideal campus political situ- ation is one \where sub rosa clique meetings <>.nd predetermined ballot- ing are unknown\ Charles W, Lounsbury, Jr,, President of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute .Student Union told the student body •in daily assembly on Satur- day. With general campus politics as his subject, Lounsbm·y explained that, \regardless of ideals a-nd be- liefs, everyone who does not have retmmi.st tendencies comes to ac- knowledge the presence of 'campus politics' and plays them for what they ate worth.\ Explaining the political situation at R. P. I., Lounsbury told of the two combines each composed of a group of fraternities which meet regularly before variou:: elections to decide how campus positions should be a.pportioned and what help should be given an opposing combine's candidate. This he char- acterized \as simple a solution as 1 is possible, if politics must exist I because everyone is either on one side OJ' the other.\ Prize To Be Offered For Best Senior Library A prize of $30.00, given by Florence H.

Dr, Fox went on to describe the familiar details of Washington's career in the light of his character and contributions to the country he served. \Washington was his country's son before he became its father,\ Dr. Fox said discus.sing the first president's strength of character. \He was largely a self-made man, becoming at the age of 20 the mas- ter of a vast edate, and at 21 the leader of the first sally in the war which was to finally drive the French from this continent.\ Creator of Colonial Troops \Early in his cat·eer,\ Dr. Fox went on, \Washington began his activities <>.s a legislator and an in- tx epid defender of local ]i,berty.

There can be .no greater difference in the theory of state than that between the Russians and the Japanese. Russia's influ- ence in China is real and threatens to increase.\ To most people in Japan, \Rus;;ia is the great and natural enemy rather than China,\ he said. Explaining that a shrinkage in Japan's world trade forced her to turn to the continent for economic solutions, the speaker .said, \Were Japan not in control in Manchuria today, Russia would be.\ \Japan's claims south of the Great Wall are less valid. Whoev!'r started the present conflict, its de- velopment has been different from what was antici·pated. This has brought a change in the immediate objectives.\ Hope for New Order Ceremonies Mark I 45th Anniversary Of Union College Dr. William Harold Cowley, pres- ident of Hamilton College, will de- liver the principal address entitled \Two Gentlemen from Union\ at the Founders' Day exercises in Me- morial Chapel tomorrow morning marking the 145th anniversary of the chartering of Union College. Professor Helmer L. Webb, college librarian, who has been chosen as the faculty speaker, will deliver the opening address at 10:00 a. m. on the topic, \The College Student's Reading a Hundred Years Ago.\ Dr. Harold A. Larrabee, profes- sor of Philosophy and chairman of the committee on public cere- monies, will again act as marshal, leading the academic procession down the center aisle of the chapel at the start of the ceremonies, He will later introduce the two speak- ers. Dr. Cowley, the feature speaker, was born in St. Petersburg, Vir- ginia, and received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Dartmouth Col- lege. Gmduate work in the Univer- sity of Chicago followed, after which he accepted a teaching posi- tion at Ohio State University. Ham- ilton claimed him as its president in June, 1938. Schenectady Academy Founded Tomorrow's ceremonies recall the founding of Union 145 years ago. In 1779, while the colonies were still fightmg against England for their independence, Schenectady residents first petitioned the Board of Regents for a charter, a .petition that was denied as were several succeeding ones. Dit·ck Romeyn came to Schenectady two years later, and through his intensive ef- forts Schenectady Academy was finally founded. Dutch Reformed, Anglicans, Presbyterians and other religious faiths continued their pe- titions for a non-sectarian college and their efforts were finally re- warded, Schenectady Academy be- coming chartered as Union College in 1795 by the Board of Regents. Union students are generally aware of traditional rivalry which exists between the Dutchmen and Continentals, but few have heard of the cooperation that existed be- tween these two colleges many years before their meetings on the athletic field. Hamilton was found- ed in 1812 but Union granted de- grees to the graduating seniors of the former institution until the Board of Regents con:ferred upon Hamilton the privilege of grant- ing degrees.

February 20, 1940 UNWIELDY When the new Junior PI'Om Committee arrangement was passed by the Student Council, creating a lm·get· and more representative committee, there was considerable opposition to the new system on the grounds that the larger gl'Oup would be unwieldy. If the committee in charge of the 19..11 Junio1· Prom is unwieldy, we suggest that larger and more unwieldy committees be chosen in the future. Item one: free bids. F1·om time immemorial it has been a quaint Union custom for all campus org·anizations to line up at Prom time with palms out, waiting for complimentary tickets. Terrace Council members, class officers, campus edi- tors, members of past P1·om committees, and Student Coun- cil office1·s fought to find a place in the long line. Result: either a large number of non-paying guests o1· a great deal of ill will. Th·is yea1·, however, the group in charge of the dance has decided to be businesslike about the matte1·, and has very sensibly discontinued all free bids. Even membe1·s of the committee will pay to attend the prom. Item two: Favors. One of the most distressing factors of pa:st Proms, we feel, has been the relatively large sum ex- pended fol' favors. Committees have spnt from $150 to $200 for these trinkets which were 100 ~;. impractical, and which had an average life of somewhat less than a week. In several instances the amount paid for these favors have spelled the difference between a profit and a loss. The 19·!1 committee, however, has tightened its belt, and has chosen to budget but $50 for favors. The saving effected on favors will be applied to the amount which the group plans to spend for a band. · Item three: band. Rarely, if ever, we feel, has a Prom Commi·ttee been so since in its desire to secm·e the most popular ot·chestra for the dance. At the vel'Y outset the committee, through the medium of a campus poll, afforded the ~tudeut body an opportunity to de:siguate the band of its choice. Campus wiseacres ridiculed the possibility of the committee's abi!Ry to secure Glenn J.\liller fo1· the function, as the band was commanding $500 more for an appearance than the budget would permit. The tax committee, the group was told, would not consider advancing a loan to serve as a de- posit until the Prom Committee could justify such an outlay for the band. Instead of accepting defeat, the committee went into action and, between Saturday noon and l\Ionday morning secured pledges from ovee 300 students, promising to purchase tickets at $6.00 if l\liUer were signed for the dance. In view of the fact that such an attendance would gmmmtee the financial success of the Prom, the Tax Com-' mittee approved the loan. The recently announced signing of .Miller for the dance is a tribute to the conscientious efforts of the Prom Committee. May all future Prom Committees prove as large and un- wieldy as that of the class of 1941. THE CONCORDIENSIS, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1940 AFFAIRS President Roosevelt is on a \mystery\ cruise. This my~tery however, is nothing compared to another in which he is involved: what is hi:; attitude towat·d a thitd term? There \iE still another my~­ tery which come~ to mind in this connection: what will voting Amer- ica do if the President decides to run again'? With the d-ates already chosen for the Democratic and Re· publican national nominating con- ventions, it might be well to devote some at.tention to such questions. NaUonal heroe~ have a very great influence on American J.ife and policy. Leader~ of aH kindo 1 ealize this. One of their favo! ite and most effective tricks !::; to at-1 tac-h a famou:; name to any cau:;e I which they are trying to forward, I and suC'h a name can easi-ly be found. Two great heroes are ccm- sta.ntly mentioned in connection with the third t-erm issue: one i. George Wa~hington and the other I i'~ U!y::;~e:; S. Grant. Few Americans will deny that I Washington was a grea·t man. It i~ nece~smy to sta-te, however, even I a-t the 1 i,;k of being accused of his- torica-l ~acrilege, that in his time he was not the demi-god he is to- day. He de~paire.:t a't the enmity I' of a good portion of the press. His political opponents increased. Peo- ple did not lind conditions as ideal as they would like them and did not hesitate to say so. Aftet· eight year~ he 1·etired from the presi- dency, weat·y and ::ad. He received little gratitude for hb great accom- plishments. Yes, he opposed a third term. Eight years of 'biting criti- cism was enough for him. Ulys:>E':; S. Grant was one of the heroes of the Civil War. He was a gt·eat general, but !Htle else. He wa:; no politician, and whether we like it O!' net American democracy requites that a sta.te:;man, to be ::;uccessful, must be a politic-ian as well Grant wa\ honest, no doubt, but he made the fatal mistake of thinking that everyone else was. He had a rnilitaty mind and' treat- ed his cabinet and whole staff like an army regiment. As a result his administration wa.s throughout a hot-bed of conuption of the worst <~ort. Yes, he opposed a third term. Eight years of corruption was enough for him. The Founding Fathers were ex- tt em ely able men. They did every job thoroughly. They instituted a ~}ftem of checks and balances in which each branch of government so elf ecti vely checks the others that nothing is accomplished. One of the great defects of American gcvernment is that it prohibits the cPn tering of responsibility any- where. It does not allow a capable leadet to use his talents to .the full- est extent. If America is to cope with its problems effectively, we must get over t·he suspicion that there is a would-be dictator lm k- ing around every corner waiting to spt·ing into the presi,dential chair at the earlief!t opportunity. It ~eem~ real:lonable to 'believe that any person who has dictatorial as- pit·ations can seize power as easily in four yeats or eight years as in twelve, and it does not take more than a few years to distribute all the available spoil~. There i!:l an inte1·esting story about a conversation of two Amer- ican citizens.

Dutchmen Win Final Home Contest to Even Record with Troy Rivals; Score '50-4'5 With Harry Palmer leading the Garnet forces with 21 points, Union'.s varsi,ty basketball team scored an impressive victory @Ver R. P. I. in the final home ga1ne of the season Saturday evening, 50-45. The victory evened the score with the Engin.eers who had defeated Union earliet· in the season in a game played at T1·oy. The Dutchmen stepped off to !'~--- quick lead and were never behind 1 ,-------------~-, in the fray. Rensselaer fought to a tie midway in the second half but a Union rally put the game on ice. Palmer's nine field goals and three free tosses made him high scot·cr. He scored seven of his 21 tallies. in the first mi·nute and a hal!. \Rusty\ Carmen scored 15 of the visitors' p0ints. It was UNion's first. V·ictory in three starts against the Engineers. Union stretched its lead to 11-3 before the Rensselaer attack ~tart­ ed clicking. Holding the Garnet. scoreless for seven minutes, the Trojans ralHed and evened the count. F1·ee tosses by Al Turchick and Captain Herb Watson momen- tarily pushed the Dutchmen ahead, but Burt Hawks sank a foliow-up to knot the score once again. Larue Buchanan, who accounted for 11 Garnet points, put the homJ team back in front with a lay-up ehot. Palmer c'ropped in three more in rapid succession to put the ~core a:t 21-13. At the halftime mal'i(, the count was 24-16. Nitchman to Start Spring Football Drills Although the heaviest snow of the yeat• fell yesterday, i·ndica- tlon that Spring is not so far · away were evident when Coach Nel~on W. Nitchrnan. announced that i·ndoor Spring football drills would start next week. All men expecting to play with the 1940 varsity gridil'on · squad must report to Head Coach Nitchman in the Gym- nasium at 12:45 p. m. Frid«y when they wiU be measured for uniforms and discuss plans. Dur- ing the next week the cand·i- dates will run through play~ which will make up the Dutch- men's offense next Fall. Indoor practice sessions wtll continue until the weather per- mits outEide work when Nitch- man and Line Coach AI Ciampa will give individual instruction to the candidates. In Y ear•s Last Game Q~:~intet Still Spirited Frorn Saturday's Victory Over Rensselaer Still spirited from its victory over R.P.I., the vat sity basketba!( team will travel co WilliamEtown tomorrow night to face a powerful Purple team in its la>t game of the season. Coach Nel::;on Nitchman is ex- pected to start the sam<e five !hat' functioNed so well against the H!n· · gineen; last Saturday night. H~·l'l'Y Palmer, who scored 21 points against Rensselaer, and AI Tur- chick wiH be at the forwai•d spots. Captain Herb Watson wiU be in the pivot poEt, with Larue Buchanan and Mickey Ra·lhlev a,; guards. Although the Wi·Iliams quintet hasn't compiled the most impres- sive record imaginable, the Purple has shown itself to be a smooth working, fast group. Captain \Butch\ Schriber, forward, is the mainstay of the five. Schriber, a high sco1er and a good team play- er, recently tallied 19 points against American International College, one of the better New England teams. Humby Quintana, at a guard post, is also a certain starter. The other three men probably will bt' Frank Bu~h. forward; Ray Egan, center; and Bud Boyer, guard. Egan is a tall lanky man who has improved as the season has pro- gressed. Action in Second Half of R. P. I. Game Captain Herb Watson and \Rusty\ Carmen of R. P.

One lm·ge lccked mail box will be in>talled in the lobby of Sou~h Section, taking the place of the pigeon hole box now in Ufe there. Une student will have a key and wiH distribute the mail, placing it undt>r the re- spe;;tive doors. This c,yotem was ~uggested by South Section resicents and the c0st will be borne by them. Last ye:u· dormitory students rejected a proposal to install a central- ized rr.ai'l r·oom alter ::;eveeal mail~ had been lifted from cif- fcrent cormitorics. Last Mountebanks Films Monday Two members of the Union de- 'bating team pat·tidpated in 'l. no- deci~·ion debate with Hamilton <o.t Clinton last night The topic was, resolved: That the United Stdtes can best serve the intere>t~ of de- mocracy by remarmng neutral. Those who participated were Mar- vin Lazaru:;, '40, and WH!iam Nu- gent, '40. Hamilton expl'essed a desrre be- fore the meeting to use the Union system of roundtable discusdon, · which consh:ts of a variation on the theme and holds the conftict ele- ment at a minimum. This produces a tendency toward roundtabl.! tX· actness of information rather than emotionalism raised by fo:·mal vra- tmy, according to Lazarus. To Meet Cornell Although many of the delegates are expected to appear on Friday night, the fil'l't activities will take place on Saturday when non-com- petitive skiing will head the pro- gram. A square dance in the eve- ning will follow. On Sunday, the skliers will again take to the trails and slopes adjoining Gore Moun- Review of 'Cavalcade' And 'March of Time' To Conclude Series Next Tue:;uay night, Febr:Jary 27, two more members will t\nter a debate at Cornell.

T., Dart- mouth, Vassar, and Skidmcre. and although these institutions are ex- pected to be represented the largest delegations will probably be from Radcliffe, Vassm·, Cornell, Yale, Dartmouth, and Skidmore. The res- ervations from Union will be re- stricted to 25 men, Mr. Wyatt, an- nounced, due to limited accommo- dations.

Garis. The curfew for the May dance has been extended from one until two a. m. The reason given for the change concerns the recent propo;;al that Union and R.P.I. hire the same band on successive night to reduce costs. Louis Carr, president of the Student Council, is discussing such a proceaure with repre- sentatives of the R.P.I. Student Union, although action during this college year is not expect- ed. The plan calls for the \'ame band to play at one institution on a Friday and at the other on the following Saturday, and, by so doing, to reduce the cost for· each. To make possible this plan. President Dixon Ryan Fox and Dean Garis have agreed that Prom may be scheduled for a Saturday night every other yea.· and that, on those nights, the dances may continue until t-.vo a.m. The announcement from the Dean's office indicates that he is considering this year's Prom as a scheduled Saturday affai: and. as such, is allowing it to continue until two.

Dr. Cowley chose Fran- cis Wayland of the class of 1813, president of Brown University, and Henry Tappan, class of 1825, after- ward the first president of the Uni- versity of Michigan, as having been the \vigorous torch beare·l'S in the advance guard of higher educa- tion.\ Education Authority Following hio speech, Dr. Cowley received the degree of Doctor of Letters from President Fox who in his citation praised him a.s \one of the countr;,'s few authorities on the history and theory of college edu- cation; author of books on leader- ship and now illustrating his prin- ciples on an imtitution with which our own has had a peculiarly close and friendly relationship for nearly a century and a half ... \ Francis Wayland and Henry Tap- pan's \contributions to the develop- ment of American higher educa- tion,\ said Dr. Cowley, \were so im- portant that they will always be crmnted among the great edu:a.tors of the nineteenth century; they were g1eat men because they saw that rtew social forces we1e accum- ulating strength and that the col~ lege needed to reorganize to meet the demands of the new day which the,-e for·ces were producing. Against tremendous opposition they set about to modernize higher edu- cation.\ Through books, speeches, and articles in the journals of the day they pleaded the cauee of scientific education; Bnd as the presidents of two important universHies they manuvered cur1·icular and organ- izational changes to provide for sci en ti fie instruction.\ Fought for Modern System After a desct·iption of the trials of the two educators in introducing their s~stems of modern education, the ~peaker said \Almost a century ha:; pas,-ed since Wayland and Tap- pan finished their work. We have learned, for example, that scientific and utilitarian education have con- tributed tremendously to American life .but that they have created as hany educational systems as they have ~olved. We have learned that the German system of education stood on feet of clay. More impor- tant than anything else, we have learned that the wlutions found for the problems of one generation will not satisfy the next gener- ation.\ In conclueion, Dr. Cowley said: \On this day of genuflection to the past, we pray that Union College may in the twentieth century pro- duce educational leaders compar- able in intelligence, breadth of vi- sion, and social-mindedness to her two great sons of the nineteenth, Francis Wayland and Henry P. Tappan.\ Webb Tells of Student Reading The student reading at Union College a hundred years ago was desctibed by Librarian Helmer L. Webb in the second address deliv- ered during the hour ceremony.

Paul Becker Assistants Solomon Blechman Bob Hayner Granger Tripp Friday, Febmary 23, 1940 A YEAR AGO- Just one yea1· ag-o, The Concordiensis carded a story stat- ing that do11nitory residents had rejected a plan proposed by the administration which called for the installation of a cen- tral mailbox in Washburn Hall. Of the 121 men reached by letter, only 63 replied, and, of this gToup, 2.,1 favored no change. The proposal was put fo1·th because dormitory residents were the victims of a disturbing number of mail robberies. In today's issue of The Concordiensis may be found a short article which shows that the same situation exists today. Residents of South College have banded together to form their own central box in an effort to stop the l'Obbel'ies. North College and Oldg-ym Hall, it would appear, will con- tinue receiving mail as in the past and trust to luck that the thief will not choose to run off with any one man's monthly check. Condemning the robberies is useless because they are for- ever being condemned and still they continue. The point in question is their prevention. Last year the administration proposed prevention. Criticising the present residents of the dormitories for the attitude taken then is unfair because, in a large amount, they are different men. Should the administration, however, again offer a plan which \vould check the thefts, would these men accept it? Last year, the Comptroller's office agTeed to construct a single unit of locked boxes in the portion of Washburn Hall now occupied by the bookstore should enough students desire it. Obviously, such a unit could not be constructed thet·e to- day. It might, howeve1·, be placed in Silliman Hall. The prin- cipal objection that would be presented by the dormitory resi- dents, the same one that was presented a year ago, would be the inconvenience of location, yet a short daily walk seems a small price to pay for a safe mail delivery. When one com- pares the distance dormitory residents would be forced to walk to the distances that students at such colleges as Yale, Wesleyan and Penn State, to name but a few, go for their mail, the point seems insignificant enough to lightly brush aside. Still all of this is conjecture. The administration might not feel disposed at this time to construct a central mailbox. There does exist, however, a good chance that it will, but only if the men whom such a unit would affect show enough interest-and intelligence-to ask for it. If, however, the dormitory residents are polled on the question once more and 63 out of 121 men answer and 24 of these favor no chang.e, let such idealistic ideas as stopping the robbery of United States mail die on this newspaper page, R. s. s. ANNALS OF ST. ANDREWS Br ,JOHN P. LEWIS, '41 SatUJ day classes are t~boo. at St. Andi ew~. so the weekends are a·l· way~ good things. This one, how- evet· a three-day affair has :been particularly admirable. and we claim to have mace worthy u~e of it. Armed with a bonowed pair of slds, ~nd :;om~ ,;erviceable poles ac- quil·ed at a recent auction of un- ' claimed odds and ends which have ; been cluttering up the sto1 e-roon:s · of the residence, we headed into the hills .;outh of Pet·th and tcok advantage of Scotland's heavy win- ter. The snow wasn't perfect, but there wa,; plenty of it, the hills were good, and it :;eemed marvel· ous to have wood under one's feet again. The attitude o.f the average Scot -of the town, not the be-gowned variety- -to decent winter weather is deplorable. Week after wee·k of arctic fogs, rain, sleet, and sta.bbing wet wind bz ing<: forth not a mm · mur from hi,; patient lip:;, but let a few inches of good, white, 5kia:ble Enow assault him and there ·are un- ending complaints about \this fdghtful, . . . this blooC:y . . . weather\. Probably this reaction is due to ·the disgusting a.ftermath 0f olm:h which any snowfall bring~ tc thi:s galoshles~ land because of an apparently complete and general lack of knowledge of the theory and practice of ~now-removal. It is teported that most towns and coun- ties a1 e the proud posH»£01'>' of a road plow or two-in fact so proud that they almo<:t never submit their property to the cruel ministration of the elements. As for a private citizen'e shoveling his own eidewalk --it ~eem,; to be rarely con:;idered let alone done. While 1 eturning from ::kling ~ es· tel day, as we wet·e pushing, rock· 1ng, ::md roaring our way along an un-plowed trans-moor road, there was uniquely displayed to us the way this inability to cope with mow is hampering the fighting fot·ces. Stucl{ in the ruts-iron- ically enough-of an army lorry, was one of tho~e wee Btitish car:; which should neve1· be aJ.lowec' within sight of a ·snow-d1ift. Its occupants were two uniformed gen- tlemen, a Scottish captain with a heavy Fife accent -not too compe- tent at this point alter a patriot· ically lat·ge consumption of his na· tiona! beverage-and his lieutenant a very bored and sane Engli,hman who talked frightfully, frightfully Oxford. There was really nothing that we could do for the marooned Army; we hope it didn't spend the night there. Here, though. was symbolized two interesting fea:tures of Britain to- day. First, we saw strikingly dif· played Mr. Hore-Beli>ha's democra- tization .of the Army-the passing of the every-officer-with-a-univer- sity-degree principle in favor of the man tisen ftom the rank::. That much of the democracy and infor- mality which British officers of the 1918 vintage at once openly de- plm·ed and grudgingly admired ·in the raw Yankees who came undet· their observation, has infected the new army of Wol'ld War II, is a recognized fact. For example we tecall Pn A1gyll and Sutherland pri- vate admonishing his blustering :;argeant who was trying to hustle him and some of his fellows out of a public swimming pool \some- where in Scotland\ \Och away, Angus --gie UE a.noother five min- utes.\ The second con:;ideration which struck us about this particular cap- tain and lieutenant arose when we \uddenly asked ourself why it seemed particularly democratic for the one to be the other's supe1 i01. Certainly not because one was English and the other Scottish. It would have seemed quite as un- usual if the lieutenant had been a Scot who spoke without an accent -as do most St. Andrews students. The whole distinction, then, seemed traceable to the way the two pro- nounced words. The question of British class dis- tinctions is one on which Ameri- cans are apt to form unfounded snap decisions, and one which we personally have so far avoided de- livering ourselves upon, although it must be admitted that we on occasions have expressed a heated opinion or two, as when dUI ing the last week, for instance,. one of the residence officials expressed his disapproval of students' carrying on any conversations with maids. One friend of ours .here who has had thil·ty times as long to observe the situation as we have, has the interesting theory that class dis- t.inctions would perish a natural OUR COLLEGIATE CONTEMPORARIES In a poll conducted by The HOBART HERALD recently, it was found that Lowell Thomas was preferred to aill other news commentatol'S ,that \The New ¥orlt Times\ had· more readers but fewer subscribers than \The New York Herald Tribune,\ nnd that \Life\ was the :favorite magazine of the Deacons. j death in Britain if two things could I be standardized throughout all in- 1 come, titled, and un-titled groups- , those two being speech and eti- quette.

M1·. Leopold Stokowski and Mr. Eugene Ormandy have brought to· gether somt' of the most accom- pli~hed musicians in the wo·rld and have built up one of the countr·y's best 01 chestra,;. The string section i» acknowledged to be a~ fine as any in the world. Although some people consider that the excellence of the string ,;ection has led to its ovet·-emphasis, such empha»is only add~ distinction and individuality to the orcheEtla. In spealdng of this, it should be noted that the customary positlon:otl arrangement O·f the >-trings and brasses is re· versed. The concert-meister, men- tioned that the large velvet curtain behind the brass section was prob- ably the cause for a great degree of ,;ound abs:orption, making the string ;:ection particularly notice- able. It is interesting to note that the concel't-meistet· considered the accoustic,; of the concert hall to be excellent, with this one exception. At the same time we understand that a pl'Ominent New England orche~tra h9.s refused to give a concert in Schenectady due to the \notm·iously bad\ accoustics of the Plaza Theahe. • f'it>C('s Accent Each Other' Frcm the opening chorale-pre· Jude, \0 Mensch, bewein' dein' Sunde gross,\ the excellence of the program was manifest. It is only the greate:;t of artists who can ar- 1 ange a program so that the in- dividual pieces accent each other by the proper degree of contrast, and yet form an integral part for the movement of the program as a whole. The two chorale-preludes, arranged for orche5tra by Mr. Ormandy, set the \tempo\ for the progt am itself. The intensity of religious feeling was expressed in the first through simple harmonies fully orchestrated. The orch~:stra­ tion of the second, \Wachet auf, zuft un:; die Stimme,\ was perhaps too highly emphasized, loEing some of the es5ential c'haracteristics of Bach. The chorale-preludes were fol- lowed by Caesar Franck's on!~· symphony. This symphony con- tinues to be one of the most pop- ular as well as beautifully expres· sive piece• of music ever written, despite the fac that it was poorly received when first played. It must be said that it fm·med one of the pointE of the evening concert. The placing of the 'cello section at the front of the stage was particularly effective, as they played an im]JOI· tant pal t in the symphony. The admirable execution of the Dmonor symphony was surpassed only by the Daphnis and Chloe Suite. Ravel, the wizard of modern orchestration, leaves no opportu- nity to escape his phenomen•li ~ bil· ity to utilize the orchest:·R in its entirety. And it must be included that Mr. Ormandy did TI'Jt al10w a single dmmatic phrase to fall 5hort of the mark. Ravel and Bel'lioz Included It is important to observe that both Ravel and Berlioz were in- cluded in the program. The formi!l' is considered the greatest m~t<ter of modern orchestration. Not only were both these composers featured in the concert, but the selections were placed so close togeth'\r that comparison could be made easily. It was apparent that the mastNY of Ravel in the field of orchestra- tion excelled that of Berlio:r.. Nevertheles~. the emotional content of the music of Berlioz was con· sidered, by this critic, to bt) more beautifully expressed. Although it is not customary for a symphony orche.stra to play an encore, we wet'e graced with one by Mr. Ormandy. It seemed a point- less denounement, and whilf) the \Ride of the Wall{yries\ .may be a delightful piece in the opera, we see no reason for th'mt to be dragged in as an encore. We are thankful, however, Finiandh was not played, as a belated tribute tu the struggling Finns. It would seem that the Schem:c- tady audience has acquired a few \concert-going\ manners since Mr. Smeterlin and Mr. Feuermann were here. Although it received the Philadelphia Orchestra right well, and noisily too, it only had one opportunity to applaud in the wrong place. The one slip wa2 cor- rected by the hissing of the few music lovers who knew better. We are long suffering individuals given to ignoring such ineoponsible material as b presented .from time to time in, that noble example of college journalism, the Concordy. Now and then, however we are awakened from our lethargy .by eon:e pal ticulai' item expressed therein, rnd complain to whomever is convenient of the item's fault; or in extlaurdinary cases, ·being stir· red to halfhearted action, we write a let tPr to the eCilor_ This latter and Ja;.t dit~h action has been brought about by, what is to u:;, a parti;,ularly obnoxious article in the Tue~C: ~y edition titled \Aff.ai1 s\. The article terms it<:elf \an ap- peal for u rational appPoach to the third te1 m issue\ which i-s admit- ted·lY an exemplary undertaking. We find it carrying out this aim with !1 ;·upe1·ficial Liscu,;sion of the t•eg,·ons that two \national he1·oes\ G. vVa:ohington <the man m>t the coffee) and U. S. Grant, had for opposing third te1 ms. The reasons given, we might even question those givea i:n the case of Grant, at·e neither complete n0r compx.e- henfive enough to warrant belief. We shall be tolerent, nevertheless \lnd pass over to riper (like cheese) fields. We quote: \The Founding Fathers were extremely able men. They did every job tho1oug!y. They instituted a <ystem of checks and balances in which each ·branch of government ~o effectively checks the othets that nothing is accom- plished.\ We pause awe stricken and consider the procerb ''where angels fear to tread .... \ We cannot cite dates, for we never •eern. able to re- call them, but H seems to us that cur government has limped along rather successfully for a aum- ber of yea.rs now unCer this system of checks anti balances. There have been publi•hed some rather good b:>Oks by some rather learned. men dealing with this particular innovation of the Founding Fath- Let's not stop here, thete are mot•e fields to conquer, or should we say more fields to plow up so that a .few seeds of reflective thought may take root. Again we quote: \If America is to cope with it~ problems effectively, we must get over the mspicion that there is a dictator lurking about every cor- ner waiting to spring into the pres- idential chair ~ t the earliest oppot- tunity\. Firstly we will admit that the term \dictator\ has been us-,d a'! a sca.rehead in the past few years. We then pclnt out that the use of the word \suspicion\ in the a'bove quotation is a use of the same technique that has applied \cictator\ with ·so much success. Thus the author is guilty of the same wrong of which he convicts othet·s. Let us turn now to the thought 0f the quotation. When people are setting up private gov- ernments all around us we feel that a continual watch over our own leadet·s is not unwise. Perhaps one of the reasons that we are still liv- ing in ~- democracy is the fact that we have been diligent in maintain- ing this watch. We believe that one reaches a destination a lot sooner by auto than by airplane, if the air- plane has a faulty rudder. One last quotation: \What is one te think of American democracy when it loo·ks backward for guid- ance P. century and a half when it should be looking forward.\ We think highly of American democ- L'acy in regard to this habit because one is usually better guided by events in the pa~t than those in the future. Roger Marshall SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY The University of Buffalo A four year curriculum completed in three calendar years, by means of the quarter plan. (Four quarters of eleven weeks each, to the school year.) The dental and medical schools are closely affiliated, instruc- ticn in the hasic medical sciences being under the supervision of the medical faculty. Clinical practice of dentistry, in all its varied afpects, is supervised by the dental division, and there is an in- timate as~ociation with the clinics of several hospitals. Periods of internship in two general and one children's hospital during the senior year, offering unusual experience in clinical observation, diagnosis, and treatment of dental conditions. Next regular session will start the first week in July 1940.

York s c A PECK OF SPORTS Williams College is the pos- sessor of an excellent new gymnasium, 1Jt:1t not many people use it because there were only about 200 on hand to witness the Union-Williams game Wednesday night. . . . The at:<:1osphere in the gym- nasium wa·s very stmnge and even before the contest start- ed it was evident that it would not be Union's \night to howl\ .... The season is over and it cou·ld have been· better but accepting it for what i.t was, there are now sorne bouquets to hand out. ... To Captain Herb Watson, General Electric Company em- ployee who has a heavy scho- lastic curriculum, fo.r leading the team in scoring the sec- ond consecutive year. . .. It was a joy to see the Captain sink 10 field goals against Williams. . . . To Harry Pal- mer who got the \break\ he had been waiting for two and a half seasons when he crash- ed the starting line-up and made the most of it, scoring 43 points in three games to win the mythical \most im- proved player\ title .... To Larue Buchanan, whose con- sistent performances made him a real team-man and sec- ond highest scorer. In this group are the three starting seniors, two of whom have competed in their last inter- collegiate games as Union un- dergraduates, while Palmer will be seen this Spring on Alexander Field (we hope) as co-captain and catcher of the varsity nine, who distinguish- ed themselves although they played with a team which lost more games than it won. Etc. The best way to describe the Williams game is to say that it was the Union-Hamil- ton contest with Union's role reversed .... The most inter- esting home contest of the year' was last Saturday's R. P. I. game and it bears out this corner's contention that the R. P. I. rivalry is the best from the spectator's point of view because no one ever knows what's going to hap- pen. . . . .. Swarthmore was by all means the most impres- sive team meeting the Dutch- men here this season, al- though Rochester was cer- tainly expected to fill this spot. . . . Attention Sons of Lord Jeff!!!! The Union-Am- herst game supplied the Gar- net seniors, all of whom have been at many other colleges as visiting athletes, with their first opportunity to visit your institution. Their reaction was~\No oth,er college has, or no other college could have greeted a Union team with such fine treatment!\ And now that \finis\ is written to the varsity basket- ball season, all thoughts will turn to baseball and the su- preme question: \Will Union be able to play any games at home on Alexander Field this Spring?\ THE CONCOHDIENSIS, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1940 Herb Watson, With 127 Points, Leads Courtmen Varsity Loses To Williams In Final Game Watson Scores 20 As Courtmen Lose Ninth Game, 61 AO Williams College gained what it might call revenge for the defeat in football at the hands of Union Wednesdar night when it register- ed a Gl to '10 basketball victory in its own gymnasium. The Dutchmen never had the lead and it was only Captain Herb Watwn'::: accurate eye which liept the Garnet in the fight at all. rhe Union team got off to a very poor start and unable to keep pos- 5ession of the ball as the alert 1-ur ple :;:quad recovered the Gar- net fumbles ana combined a speedy passing attack with the ac- curate eyes of Frankie Bush, Cap- <ain Butch Schriber, and Humby Quintana to score the rout. Although the Union team was much taller than the hosts, it could not penetrate the wedge-like zone defense set up by WllliamE to :::core on its usual play down the center. Watson won the plaudits of the crowd (a very small one numbering some 200 people) for hi:;; accurate set - shooting combined with a few lay-ups to give him a total of 20 points.

Hoadley Seeks Return Of 'Labeled Hardware' The modem genetation of Union men, it would seem, learn not only the \·integration of sine pi\ but also the disintegration of the la-belled hardware placed about the campus at convenient spots to wam those afflu:ent few with cars of lurldng dan- gers. To put it plainly, Anthony Hoadley, comptroller, in.formed the Con em dimsi~ that ~everal ruffians had removed the ttaffic signs. In particular, Hoadley J'oin·ll'd out, the 'bump' sign esconced neat· the Biology Lab- oratory and hard by the Ka.ppa Alpha lodge had by it~ protract- ed absence <occasioned by its re- m avail created a distinct traffoic hazard. Signs have also been taken from several othet places on the cam.pus, including stop :;igns in f10nt of the chapel, and the warning sign o·n the lane lead- ing to the back of the library. Since all the :sigm; are neces- sities and will have to be re- placed, Mr. Hoadley estimates the los;: at a!bout thirty dollars. Anyone wi>;-hing to ease his con- science and the weight on the walls of his room may do so by returning said signs to the comptrollers office or theit orig· ina! positiom.

Gilmote, '27, program directot· of the General Electric televi~ion station W2XB, was guest last night at a meeting of the Union College Radio Wol'ltshop. Mr. Gilmore and John Sheehan. '25, directcr of the Radio Workshop and program manager of short- wave stations WGEA and \VGEO, discus;·ed talent for future pr a- grams with ·about 30 students in- terested in radio and television. The meeting was originally s~heduled as a serie~ of auditions for prospective perfo1·mers on the Genetal Electric stations whic.h Mt·. Gilmore and Mt. Sheehan manage. However, in order to provide .better facilities for the judging of the stu- dents, stucio appointments were made fat· thi:; week. Tho~e pre~ent engaged the two men in informal discussions of varioue pt·oblerns of radio and tele- vieion technique. Mr. Gilmore, ex- plainin~ some of the requirements of a television program, pointed out, \:.fovement does not neces- sarily mean action. Most musical prugt·aml', for ·instance, would have movement, but it is often difficult to ·inset·t into them sufficient ac- tion.\ He went on to outline vari- ous methods cf producing television progmms, comparing them with THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1940 Sidney Edlund,· Placement Expert To Offer Advice to Job Seekers By GRANGER TRIPP ~-- \Pick your job -and land 'it\ says Sidney Edlund, New Yol'lt sales executive, placement expert and director of the \Man Ma·rket- ing Clinic\. Mr. Ed.Jund i:; to t·epea·l this -advice to Union College on tht ee occasions this week-end, and will tell his audiences jmt how to go about it. Speaking first before a placement discussion. thPn in Daily A~sPmbly and finally during the Town Meet- ing of the Air, Mr. Edlund will out. line the theories of job-getUng which have given him a wideEpread reputation for succe:os. Thie teputation ha:; •been brought to the attention of a nation of job- hunters through two mediums: first the book, \Pick Your Job- and Land It\ w.ritten by Mr. Ed- lund and his wife, and second, by an at ticle of similat' title, \They Pick Their Jobs-and Land Them\ which appeared in \The Reader's Digest recently. The \Reader·~ Digest\ article empha:izes the worlt done by Ed- lund in hie Man Mat·lteting Clinic. \Every Monday night, in a large office in midtown New York, one can find Edlund and his a!'sociates pa.tiently preeiding over the weekly clinic, ·held under the auspices of the .Sales Executives Club,\ say Ray Giles and Paul W. Kearney in the \Digest\, which condensed its article from the magazine \Yom Life.\ Disappointed job-hunters re- ceive sympathetic suggestion\ and criticisms from members of the Clinic. Letters of application are 1 ea:d and ct·iticized, and interview- ing technique is discmsed. The elements of Sidney Edlund's one great ·b3~'ic principle are £Um- med up in th·is ;;eries of quotations from his beak. \Decide what you want to do, Wyatt Announces '39 Employment Record then make sure you are qualified to do it,\ Edlund says. \Put into sell- ing yourself all the effm·t and plan- n·irrg .and intelligence that you would give to the job you. hope to sell yom·self into ....

Edlund will ·bring with him to his three talks at Union the ex- perience gained as an advisor to the 12 000 j0b-hunters whom he has helped in his Monclay night ses- sions of the Man Marketing Clinic. He conducts the~e clinics 0ut of a sense of public service. For him, \Man Marketing\ is a ho·bby, and not one of the members of his clinic hHs ever 'been charged a fee. ''Edlund has fcu:nd that rr.ost peo- ple are naturally too modest in taHting a·bout theil own accom- plishments,\ says Messrs.

Whitaker, Chairman of the Thompson Eco- nomics Prize Essay Contest, open te students of all fom· classes and canying an annual pl'ize of $25. The first phase came on Octo~ her 14 last. Mr. Thompson spoke in assembly on the voluntary safe- guards which busineE>s has estab- lished to p1 otect the pub:ic, such as the Audit Bmea u of Circula- tions·, of which Mr. Thomson has been president for mme than 25 ~·ems.

In fact, c:nce it is in that group which do not provide required com ses in public speaking, Union leans quite the other way.

Mountebanks Cast Awaits Arrival Of Jose Rubens Boy+, Stage Manager, Acting as Director For Early Rehearsals Rehersals for the second Mounte- banks' production of the \year \The Pursuit of Happiness\ have pro- gressed to a point where it is ex- pected that a complete show, minus costumes and scenery, will greet Director Jose Rubens when he azrives on the campus Friday. John Boyt, '42, stage manager of the pro- duction, has been acting as dit·ector pending the arrival of Mr. Rubens. \The Pursuit of Happiness\ is scheduled for presentation on Fri- day, Saturday, and Monday eve- nings, March 15, 16, and 18. One of the performances is to be given for the benefit of the newly es- tablished Student Council work scholarship fund, P~ay Has One Scene The play has but one scene,. the parlor of a New England farm- house in colonial days, which is being designed by Boyt. The unique feature of the set is the large four poster bed about which the so call- ed \bundling\ scene of the play revolves. The play it>elf has been labelled a \social satire\ by New York's drama crities. The authors' satire is expressed through the lines of Max Christmann, the por- trait of the Hessian deserter who goes to the side of the colonists to .. pursue happiness\ in which role Donald G. Houghton, '43, plays his first Mountebanks lead. The principal character of Colonel Mortimer Sherwood of the Virginia Light Horse Cavalry is being por- trayed by Andrew Speziali, '42, the Captain Stanhope of \Journey's. End.\ Ralph Tie bout, '42, is play- ing the Reverend Lyman Banks, the character whose opposition to \bundling\, creates the comic situ- ations for the play. Jacob H. Van Aernam, '42, has been cast as Mose, the colored servant of the pie.ce. John Boyt is playing Thaddeus Jennings, who forms the third corner of the tri- angle of which the Hessian deserter is a part. Albert S. Calian, '41, and Henry C. Meadow, '40, are the two \Sons of Liberty\. The three prin- cipal female roles in the comedy are taken by the Misses Roberta McWade, Dian Lasher, and Marion Minst, all of Schenectady. Governor Lehman To Speak on Campus Governor Herbert Lehman will ~peak before the class in state and local government Wednes- day evening, March 6, in the Old Chapel, Dr. Vernon A. O'Rourke announced yesterday. Governor Lehman will talk on the subject, \The Function of the Governor in State Government\. The address will be open to all students, Dr. O'Rourke stated. The speech i:: one in a series given by men prominent in government positions before the students in Dr. O'Rourke's class. The speaker:: generally discuss the phases of government in which they are active. During the course of the year, experts in almost all fields of government meet with the class either for- mally or in round-table dis- cussions. The appearance of Governor Lehman, however, will mark the first time that a governor of the State of New York has come to the campus to speak to the group. W. E. Benjamin, '80 Dies in New York William E. Benjamin, '80, a des- cendant of Dirck Romeyn, aca- demic founder of Union College, died in New York City late Satur- day evening. Mr. Benjamin was a collector of rare books and paint- ings. He was 81 years old. President Dixon Ryan Fox made the following Etatement when he learned of hLs death: \Mr. W. E . Benja·min was of a type more f·a- miliar to the eighteenth century than to our own~a gentleman of leisure concerned with his collec- tions of rare books and paintings. Perhaps it was not merely a co- incidence that he sought particular- ly the paintings of Bir Joshua Re\ynolds. He was a loyal son of Union College, whose library he generou:;ly enlarge<;! from time to time. Buch men conserve the cul- ture of past times for the benefit of the present.\ Mr. Benjamin donated $75,000 to the Library of Congress to esta'b- lish a chair in Arherican histery. Scorning publicity, word of this gift ·Was discovered only by accident. In the Libra•ry of Congress annua:i r e- port, a notation of the donation was uncovered. He prepared for Union College at the Union Classical Institute, a Schenectady Public School. Meets Opposition Phi Beta Kappa Likeness Charged; Plans Are Delayed Several groups. on the campus have questioned the right of the Student Council to approve the new uniform key design on the grounds that the new keys would be similar to Phi Beta Kappa keys, Student Council Chairman Louis Carr announced last night. Because of this opposition, no further ac tion will be taken in getting esti mates and placing contracts for the keys until it can be ascertained whether or not the Phi Beta Kappa Society has the rectangular shaped l~ey copyrighted. The new key design, which is similar to the honorary society's key in shape only, was approved at the last meeting of the Student Council. The uniform key will be given for all activities instead of the former practice of each activ ity raving its own key. Simila1·ity Accidental The question of similarity to the Phi Beta Kappa key is purely acci dental, Carr explained. Donald Campbell, who drew up the new design, was not copying the soci ety's key but rather was following suggestions of several reputable jewelry concerns and of the Stu dent Council's committee on uni form keys. A letter has been sent to Phi Beta Kappa, asking w.hether their key's shape is copyrighted. As yet, no answer has been received Although a crrawing of the key makes the design appear flat, ac tually two scrolls, bearing the name of the college and the activ ity, and the college seal will be raised. The Phi Beta Kappa key is flat, with all inscriptions en graved on its surface. As soon as the conflict over sim ilarity is settled, Carr said he wil forward drawings of the key fo several jewelry concern1> and ask for bids. Although he admitted he was not sure when the keys would be ready for distribution, Carr an nounced thai the contract would be awarded before Spring Vaca tion. Houses Prepare Balance Sheets Purpose of Reports Is to Determine Solvency Forms for a complete financial statement were distributed to fra- ternity treasurers at a meeting yesterday afternoon by Anthoney Hoadley, comptroller. A report from each house will be due on May 10 and the reports are to be correct to April 30. The purpose of the investigation is to discover if all houses are solvent, Mr. Hoadley explained. At present, the college has no knowl- edge as to the financial position of the various houses. The investi- gations, in each case, are to be made by independent auditors hired by the fraternities and at their expense. They will prepare balance sheets which will be turned into Mr. Hoadley'·s office. The state- ments will show the current opera- ing expenses and assets only. Monies owed on mortgages or house im- provements. are considered tQ be the responsibility of the alumni organizations. Last spring, Dr. Donald Emblen, instructor in social studies, audited the account. of each fraternity at the request of President Dixon Ryan Fox. Dr. Emblen's report suggested that ali money received by a fraternity be deposited in a bank and that ali expenditures be paid by c4eck, with the exception of small items paid from a revolv- ing petty cash fund. He also sug- gested that the chapter treasurer send a copy of the monthly state- ment to his local and national fra- ternity representatives, and that the chapter's accounts be periodical- ly checked by an independent auditor.

The depart- ments of chemistry and physic::; find it well nigh imperative to change their texts frequently, even yearly when new dis- cove!'ies involving these sciences nre published. Upon the professors in these divisions, we p1 ess our congradulations for their progressive attitude. We hesitate, on the other hand, to bind any lam·els on the brows of the non-scientific branches. Frankly, we are in no position to examine their maturer judgment. All that we can do is suggest to the heads of these departments that they make a satisfactory explanation to their students. Smely the Languag·e and Literature Division cannot feel that enough change has entered into litel'ature, French, German, and English, to \'\:arrant insisting that new books must be used every other year. If they can present as stwng a case as the sciences have, we will be only too glad to retract these statements and to suitably honor them.

THE CONCORDIENSIS, TUESDAY, l<'EBRUARY 27, 1940 AFFAfRS 1 !<'rom the many conflicting 1e· ports whl·ch le:IVl' :Vlu~cow and Hel- :;inld every day, v<. e can draw on!) one conclmion which seem.:; ju~ti­ iied and true: the Russiams have captmet' several >'mall cities a few port:;, and some poEi·tions in the M•annerheim cetenseo, and if help doe~ net come soon Finland will be Jo,-·t. Help due:; not he-!'e mea-n only loan:; and a.nununltlun: it means man-power. That is Finland',; chief deliciency Thi,; b no n:ere guess Appe:1ls for t1·oop>0 have been made otficiaHy by President Kallio and Premie1 Risto R~ti to Britain, Fran·~e, and especially Sweden hsve these nation>' not responded? Can they afford to stand by whi:e colloquially ,;peaking, Finland has he1 back to the waH? There is little doubt that Blitain and !<\ranee would help Finland ~ubstantiall~ il troop,; and ~upplie; could be pa:;:;ed through Sweden. rhe immediate enem~ ot the allies i,; Germany. but there is. no doubt that they 1·egard Rus::;iA. a,; a po- tential foe which should be crush- ed at the earliest opportune m::- ment. The allieo may thus bE' ex- cused at lea•t temporadl~·. But why dues Sweden stand in the w J.y'? Appal ently little was aceomplish•:t' at the Scandinavian confen'ncc· held shortly befme the Suvtel Union's offensive. There seems to be only one explanation of ~v.e­ den's attitude. An~· permi;;sion by Sweden to allow troop movement:; th!Ough her ten itu1-,· would be construed by Get many and Ru:;sia a,; the abanJ- onnment of a neutml policy. The Ruo;sians and Nazis fear with good rea:;<:>n that allied control of the Scandinavian and the Baltic will follow allied troop~. The Ge1mans obviously cannot allow such con- tiD! if they hope to win the WHl They would, thet efore, be ~orce.l to p1·event it at almost any eo~t . What would the Jesuit be? The two Emopean wars now going on sim- ultaneously would be merged mto one great one. and action on the weste1·n front would be trans- fat red to the trenches in Sweden far out of ~ight of the mighty Maginot and Siegfried li.1e::;. What would Sweden get out of all thio? O!!e of the greatest blood bath·; :;he ha\ ever had paralleled In mode1n hi~tory only the carnage of the Spanbh \civil\ wa1. But thet ~ i> anuthe1 side of thi:; p1 oblem to consider. The Russians invaded Finland becau,e that ;mall country was supposedly nPce~sar,- for Russia's defenses. Supposing the Russians \hould decide. when and if they cc•nquer Fin!and. that Sweden too i~ necessary for defense purposes? A g1 eat military machine is ha·rd to stop once it get,; r.olling. Sweden is, however. appa1ently willing to trust to luck. The Swelie>' in the meantime are content to help the Finns as best they can under what they and the Germans and Rus- ,;:ian:; cun\ider a neutral flatus. Time will determine the sagacity of Sweden's choice We hope for her oV\ n welfare that she has made the better one. John A. Ru,;kowski. .. 0 Fraternity Officers In respon>e to several requests.

DISC-CUSSIONS Jackson Teagarden'::; greatly im- proved outfit makes listening to his recm ding of The Moon And The Willow 'l'ree most enjoyable, although his solo on this side is rather ta:;teless. The reverse i, You, You Darling', which, I think, will become ve1y popular . . . . · Another new group that has im- p! oved noticeably is the Harry James band whose waxing of l'uxedo Junction offers fine solos by James and Vida Musso on teno1 sax . . . . Incidently, both Tea- garden and James now record for Varsity .... The late \Earl C'arroll Vanities.. introduced, if nothing mm·e, one of the most popular mclodie:; of the day, The Stralit How•, which is given the usual ,op-notch tl eatment by Bob Crosby's 01 chest1 a .... The famou,; \oldie .. remptation has been jazzed up with rather disasterous result,; as t·he number juH isn•t suited to an~ \jazzing up··. The King of the Alto Sax, as far as I m concerned, is Johnny Hodges. who. with his seven piece combo from the Duke Ellington organ- ization, does two originals which ohould make every admirer of his s!t up and take notice. I .Know What You Do features brilliant solos by Johnny. whose tone on the saxophone is something to rave about, and Cootie Williams, play- mg a well executed \growl\ trum- pet. The coupling is Dream Blues played at a slower tempo, which features Hodges' thrilling sax on almost the entire side. The rhy- thm section composed of Ellington piano>. Sonny Greer (drums), and Billie Taylor (bass) is also worthy of note . . . . Proving that the spirit of the Raymond Scott Quintet lives on. Rex Irving's seven piece group has disced Gossip and Seoond AvE'nue Clambake. As could be expected, both sides are over- arranged. but amusing. The famous rhumba Para Vigo ME' Voy emerges in swing tempo as Say •·si Si\ as played by Woody He1 man's band. and I am glad to say that this \jazzing up\ is really good . . . . A group of musicians from Andy Kirk's outfit have made a new platter under the heading of \Six Men And A Girl\ which offers some good \jamming\. The out:otanding performances on the two sides. which are Tea For Two and Mary Lou Williams Blues, are the expert piano playing of Mary Lou and the fine guitar plucking of Floyd Smith. The performances of Earl Thompson on trumpet, and Dick Wilson o.1 alto sax were only fair .... One of my pet hates is loud, tasteless \swinging out\ which almost emerges aE just noise. Such a record is Major And Minor Stomp and Kee11 A Knockin' as played by the J. Dorsey crew, whose one re- deeming feature is Jimmy's solo on the \A\ side. S.

Mr. Pinza has been called \The greatest basso in the world\ by the San Francisco Chronicle, and has drawn superlative comments from other newspapers and re- viewers.

At the conclusion of this game the winning team in the National League, the Kappa Sigmas, will play the second place team in the American League. Thus two team~ will be eliminated altogether and the final playoffs to decide the ·basketball champions will be played on Friday night.

A st1ong fourth-period rally by the tatler Trojans overcame the slight two point lead gat nered by Union during the previou<\ stanza and resulted in the margin of victory for the Engineers. \Beezer\ Sequin was again high ;ccrer for the Ga1·net forces with 10 points, while Hecht and Hoskins accounted for nine points apiece for the R.P.I. team, the final score , eading, R.P.I. 28.
