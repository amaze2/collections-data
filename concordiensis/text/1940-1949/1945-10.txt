TO THE PROM DATES Every now and then there comes a high point in the ups and downs of normal college life. The Ol'dinary gl'ind of hour exams, term papers, and lectures which constitute the ptn·suit of knowledge is in- termpted in o1·der that the fatigued students may relax. This week-end is dedicated b~· unanimous agreement to that pursuit. To vou flower of voung; American womenl;ood, who are contrlbuting· so greatly toward this much-needed relaxation, l.'nion College extends its heartiest welcome, and hopes that you, too, will return to your various pursuits wi-th the firm conviction that vou have not lived in vain. Yo~ will find, we trust, that the gentle- men who matriculate here are gentlemen at 3:00 Ol' 4:00 a.m. as well as at all other times. When ~;au at last rest your heads heavy with sleep yet to be had, on the soft downy pillows, forgive us our trespasses, for remember that since many months, we have existed in a semi-barbaric state of seclusion (with now and then an exception). Un- schooled as we are in the finer adjustments to society, some of our behavior may not meet with the approval of you who come to us from the upper regions. In om· rude way, however, we shall do our utmost to provide for your small wants. Om· hos- pitalit~· springs like the flowers which ron won't see in Jackson's Gardens, straight from the brown earth. (The ga1·dens me still worth .vour attention.) Dine with us. Wine with us. Walk with us. Talk with us. Ride with us. Abide with us. Don't walk out with fmtemity brothers. I~ecall not too avidly advices of mothers. Accept with good graces our rude welcome to y'awl. And ;-.:ou, my dear Lynn, are most welcome of ail. S. S. MEN NOTE (This is a reprint of an article appearing in the Concordiensis on June 2, 1945.) Loud cries of anguish emitted from Bailey Hall last week when the elective schedule for next term \vas posted. Future Ja·wyers, businessmen, authors, diplomats, teachers, and just plain loafers were tearing their hair and racing from prof to prof in search of seminar courses. The reason for this madness was obvious; the sum of twelve whole courses were being offered in the whole division. Of these twelve courses, six are underclass courses. Of the upper class courses, two are History courses, one is a government course, and one is a philosoph~· course. Fo1· a school ·which was once pre- dominantly a liberal arts institution, this curriculum is almost absurd. Are we to presume that Union College is to someday discontinue its Social Studies Division? Are we to presume that the college does not feel this division to be important enough to continue in full force? Are we to presume that the undergraduates now in this division are to be slowly eliminated from this great educational in- stitution? We sincerely hope not, but we have our fears. It is a near impossibility for any man in this division, regardless of his desire, to majo1· in any field. Are S.S. men to be completely excluded from the elective s~·stem '? From the number and types of courses offered, this would be our assump- tion. \\\e do not understand why, nor do v;e ask why, the administration has not been more generous with this key section of the college. We cannot, however, understand their action. Is it well to have such a condition exist when advertising the at- tributes of Union College to prospective students? Is it weii to let the present members of this division take what they can get, and let it go at that? Has Union College failed in its attempt to provide the type oi courses which the students want'? \\\hat has become of the great \liberal education\ of which Union has been so proud for 1;)0 years'? ;\lust the Social Studies Division become a war tragedy while the other divisions en- larg·e, or at least remain constant'? Is there no way a man interested in the \relations between men,\ as the study of liberal arts is purported to p1·esent, to obtain the kind of subjects in which he is most inte1·ested? We believe that here is a legitimate squawk.

The famous Redding, California, athlete Cfrme to Union in 1943 and has w0n the friendship and respect of the faculty and stu- dent body. But let's take a closer look at Mel's sporting career. It was natut·al .for the Giant star to make his mark in high sch0ol sports and this he did in foot-baH, baseball, track, and basketball. But Mel really made a national mark for hi·mself after he ·entered Wash- ingt0n State University. Mel Intended t0 concentrate on crew but his football career at center overshadowed that and alsc his discus throwing and basketball work. With the big man in the n:iiddie of the line, Washington rode into the Pacific Coast Con- ference Title and went int0 the Rose bowl. Mel played sixty minutes in that gruelling game and watched Ala- bama's passes put down his team 24-0. Nevertheless. Mel and his team-mate, Turk Edwards, made All-American, and pro teams fought for the privilege of signing them. Steve Owens' Giant team finally won and Mel started the first of his fourteen seasons with the Owens men. For eight consecutive years Mel made all-pro first team and sev- eral other times placed second. Another title was National League's Most Valuable Player. As a climax.

A. E.E. banquet brought together twenty- six student members and six profs. Throughout the meal and the after-dinner speeches, it was defi- nitely a noteworthy 0bservance that no bitterness pt·evailed. In fact, cheerfulness was the keynote of the evening. Throughout the meal, which was truly Ferro's best, it was decided that \Cheerful Charlie\ Brockner was the \Good Humor Man\ of the evening. In truly S. A. fashion, shrewd Judgement was used in the seating arrangements so that those stu- dents who got along least well with certain pros ! especially if they weren't on speaking terms.) sat next to each other. After the banquet, \Yap Yap\ Zangari read a speech prepared oy some of his more literate colleagues. The speech, which was cluttered with words beyond \Yap Yap's' comprehension and so drawing no end of hilarious laughter, was a take ·off on all the prof's present. This included both favora:ble and derogatory remarks which added to the joviality of the evening. Those profs present were, \The Good Doctor\ Gr0ver, \Cheerful Charlie\ Brockner. \Gold Mine Gil\ Harlow, \Bitter Bob'' Stanley, \Ter- rible Tom'' Male, and \Jocular Jaclt\ Whinnery. Additional good humor was added when, as each of the profs arose to speak, one offered his bit of humor which was later equaled by several of the S. A.'s. The boys were determined that the profs should not outdo the ~tudents in a contest of \Can You Top This One,\ although the S. A.'s do conceed to being inferior to these learned men in the academic field. In general, the event was con- sidered a success in furthering the S. A. doctrines to, perhaps posterity.

Five miles east of Schenectady, New York, is a site that offers special ad- vantages for a \House of Magic\ of the future. On a rocky cliff overlook- ing the Mohawk River, it is partic- ularly adaptable to work with radar television, high-frequency, jet en~ gincs, and x-ray.

Since its birth the G-E Research Laboratory has contributed much to better living, not only through scien- tific achievement, but through in- creased efficiency, as in the case of the modern incandescent lamp. And in the future G.E. will continue and expand the work it has begun.
