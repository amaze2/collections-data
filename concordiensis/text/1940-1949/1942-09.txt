Secretary Stimon's statement fol· lows: Stimson's Staiement \The enlistment of college stu- dents in the A1·my Enlisted Reserve was authorized by the Secretary of War in the belief that the training afforded by study at colleges was useful for their preparation for service in the Armed Forces and that a substantial number of those enlisted would prove qualified for selection as candidates for training as officers. By such enlistment stu- dents have the satisfaction of plac- ing themselves immediately at the service of their country to be call- ed to active duty in the Armed Forces whenever the Secretary of War finds that the exigencies of the war demand it.

Present will be Presi- dent Fox, Professor Gordon Silber, represen- tatives of the Gazette Press, and members of The Concordi.ensis managing board. \The stepping up of the in tensity of the vital combat in which we are engaged and the growing need for enlarged forces make it clear that all young men fortunate enough to have the physical and mental qual- ifications to enable them to serve their country in the Armed Forces are destined for that service. Fur- ther, the exigencies of the war have now become such that it is now expected that by the end of the college term or semester be- ginning in September those student members of the Reserves who have reached Selective Service age will all or for the most part be called to active duty and those reaching that age during subsequent terms will be similiarly called. President Fox, the second prin- cip:J.l speaker Ftt the exercises, hail- ed the end of isolationism m the United States, declaring that \VI-e will be in evrey great war. The only way to keep out of great wars is not to have them.'' J.s the college entered its third accelerated semester under a com- plete war-time program, Archduke Otto reviewed the history of the Au.;trian nation and outlined rec- ommendations for winning the war an1l the peace. · The Archduge urged that the l.Jnited States make an outright declaration that Austria be re3tored after the war with recognition of an Austrian government-in-exile now. \In these last four years,\ the Archduge said, \the Austrian un- derground resistance has continu- ed unabaited. It today extends not only to the Austrian territory oc- cupied by Hitler, but also to that occupied by the Italians. This un- derground is supported by over 90 per cent of the Austrian popula- tion. Naturally, I will not reveal to you details about our underground work, because any knowledge on the Austrian underground activities would give indirect help to Hitle~. . .. The Austrian Nation today is more united than ever. The differ- ences between political parties and creeds have completely ceased to exist. The Austrians today are united in one great underground movement which has but one aim: the defeat of the Axis. Turning to the part to be· played by the United States, the Archduke said that it is essential for the Umted Nations to show their soli- darity with the Austrian Nation by t·~cognizing an Austrian representa- tion abroad, composed of people who enjoy the confidence of the Austrian people back home. \At the same time,\ he said, \the Aus- trians abroad should be given a chance to fight under their own flag for the liberation of their home country.\ Dr. Fox, in his address, declared that the United States could guar- antee its integrity only by follow- ing . Britain's example of. \seeing to 1t that no nation dominates Europe.\ Admitting the patriotism and public spirit of those who had been isolationists, Dr. Fox warned that these people must not return to their former policy after the war. He suggested a cooperative world or~er to insure a lasting peace. . In the destin:r of Union College, th1s newly realized world order means a change in the whole spirit of c?llege and American men,\ the president said. \Now that so much of our personal happiness or mis- ery is coming to be directed by large group action through govern- ~ent _ag~ncies or giant corpora- tiOns, 1t IS obvious that everybody has to know more about political and . economic organization and funcbon than was formerly the case-and about world affairs.\ T?e A1·chduke was accompanied durmg his visit at the college by Henry Count Dagenfeld, his aide. The .two men were entertained by Pres1dent and Mrs. Fox. 01----- 0rgan Recital Program Dr. E~met' A.

Whateve1· happens, though, we feel sm·e of the wisdom of their choice. Union, in many ways, has as much to offer as it ever did. It remai11s only for the Class of 1946 to find it, in different ways, perhaps, fro1n those which we made use of, !Jut never- theless holding fo1· those who find it every lJit as much value as a college education ever had. The Class of 19-!6 will know a diffet·ent Union College from the one we knew prior to last December. Class lines have even now be- come almost eradicated, to such an extent, as a matter of fact, that --we are 110 doubt being grossly inaccumte 1n t·efening to the enter- ing class as \19\16.\ Activities are to lJe cur- tailed, not only because of de-emphasis as non-essentials in the war effol't, hut mainly through lack of student desire to put time into the \frills\ of college, when higher standards of scholars:J1ip ~:nust lJe maintained if students are to remain in deferred classifi- cations. Then, too, the burden of responsibil- ity in all matters relating to activities which carry on during the war years will inevitably fall on underclassmen, for they are sure to be in the majority. Fratemities, too, in their all-important role in Union's existence, will feel the full force of this new condition. Thus it is that the new class can look for- ward, at !Jest, to college careers fraught with a good deal of uncertainty and the prospect of a good deal more \work\ and a good deal less \play\ than peace-time conditions per- mitted. Yet by their verr presence he1·e, the mem- bers of the Class of 1946 give evidence of the qualities which will .stand them in good stead through the years which lie ahead, perser- verance, co1:1rage and faith in theil· nation. We wish them Godspeed. CULTURE AND CASH \Ve have, on earlier occasions, pointed out the praise which we believed should be ac- corded those responsible fot· the series of College Concet·ts which proved so populm· last winter and which filled so great a need during the recent Summer Session. They have brought to the college entertainment and a taste of culture of the highest type and quality, and in these channels alone have more than justified their inception and con- tinued place on the colleg-e calendar. \\'e are sure we are not alone in our sense of gratification to those who have made these series possible, as well as our pleasure in l1eal'ing that plans are now under way for sponsoring a third series this winter. At the l'isk of being called materialistic, we would point out another worthy cause \vhich has lJeen immeasurably aided by the Concert effort, aside from the artistic view- point. It has t·ecently been brought to our attention that proceeds from the six concerts held in :i.\Iemorial Chapel last winter and this summer made it possible for the college to grant scholarships to five members of the freshman class \Vho otherwise would have in all probability lJeen unable to enter college this fall. The record speaks for itself. WEEKEND? The Student Body, ever zealous in its vigil to safeguard its \rights\, noticed with a raised eyelJro\v the seemingly glaring omis- sion of the usual Interfratemity Weekend in the college calendar for 1942-43. Since that time we have heard the subject mentioned in a hundred diffe1·ent bull sessions, in which all participants \Vere heatedly debating the subject, but all on the same side. As a matter of fact, there is a case both for ann against social events in present rla.v college life. The govemment has said as much. They have officially \frowned\ upon them ever since college students started ask- ing for draft deferments. And yet dances and only slightly curtailed weekends have been held at colleges throughout the country, all without serious governmental repercus- siOns. After considerable debate, it will be re- membered, the Summer Student Council sponsored a dance last July, and one will have to admit that the amount or quality of the work being done by summer students was not detracted from to any great extent. It helped to ease the tedium of the .summer session and proved sufficiently popular to quell any fears along financial lines. We suspect agitation for a fall weekend will get under way presently, and we also suspect that the college's attitude will very likely lJe similar to that voiced not long ago h,v a faculty member, when he said, \There will probably lJe a dance if the students want one.\ Such an attitude would, we feel, be lJoth safe and sane, for we feel that the Stu- dent Body does not expect an elaborate week- end, and that it will show characteristic level-headedness and caution in the matter. A LIGHT FROM THE DARKNESS The following· is reprinted from the last spt·ing issue of the Skidmore \News\. It is taken from an edito1·ial commenting on the fact that Union men last year voted Skid- more their favol'ite \voman's college: \There is a great deal of 'good neighbol'- liness' between the colleges, in spite of all rumors to the contrary. They even have the same Vespers speakers! 1\Iany are the lo~·al 'Union girls' among us, the editorial board counting for three m· four, but we never knew the feeling was mutual. \Events social, academic, extra-curricular, that Union and Skidmore have in common \vill long remain in our memories, long after Union '40, '41, '42, and so on down the line have become successful businessmen, and long afte1· we have become settled house- wives, playing bridge and gossipping for en- tertainment. \As for good-natured rivalry, long may it last I Continued next year.\ Free Delivery Phone 4-7445 Pleasant Valley Food Market Interested in Schenectady Interested in U N I 0 N OUR MOTTO MAURICE B. • GRAUBART 11 Quality - Service Satisfaction The Jay Street Jeweler 1, · 166 Jay Street I Watch and Jewelry Repairing I a Specialty PARKER AND SCHAFFER PENS • 598 B'way-For Better Values Let Us Serve You With the Finest MILK, CREAM, ICE CREAM and Othe Dairy Products CLOVERLAND CREAMERY 919 STATE ST.

(Glass and metal may be tight at one temperature, but when they are heated, the glass will either crack or separate from the metal.) The larger the seal, the more difficult is the problem, so it has been necessary to develop special iron-nickel-cobalt alloys for large seals in vacuum tubes. Recently, however, Dr. Albert \V. Hull (Yale 'o5) and Dr. Louis Navias (C.C.N.Y. '18), of the G-E Research Laboratory, developed a means for producing tight seals between glass and iron without the use of nickel or cobalt (vital war metals). They have devised a series of glass compositions whose rate of expansion is very close to that of iron. IN A HURRY T HE graduates of technical schools and engineering colleges were in a great rush to get on the job last June. In fact, some of them didn't even wait for the graduation exercises. They weren't hurrying to be the \early birds\ who got the work. (They didn't have to; there was an estimated shortage of 82,000 tech- nical graduates!) They were anxious to start producing fot war. About 700 young engineers joined the G-E \test\ course and reported for duty from two to six weeks earlier than usual. Immediately put to work on military equipment, the test men will have an opportunity to study advanced engineering in evening classes sponsored by the Company.

He was quick to point out, howevPr, that thPre would be a full corps of cheer- leadets on hand at game time Sat- unday, and it was hoped that any enthusiasm lost because of the can- cellation of the rally would be more than made up for on Satur- day afternoon. Principal reason for the decision ca-me about after GiHie's conver- sation with college officials late yesterday. Due to the fact that Schenectady's streets can y u heavy traffic load at the time when foot- ball rallies are usually monopoliz- ing the downtown area, it was de- cided that such a venture would be most unwise. ----0--- 23 Freshmen Join Newspaper Staff Wired-Wireless Station Improves St.udio, Hears Freshman Candidates The Union College Radio System, Station UCRS, win begin broad- casting with the presentation of \Club Matioee,\ at four o'clock Monday afternoon. The UCRS held its first meeting on September 15 to wel'come prospective freshmen meHibers and give try-outs for pro- gram men. The studio set-up has been altered and a survey made of the 8,000 feet of transmission wire. A new feature, suggested by Pro- fessor Fox, will be included in tne near future. It consists of snort Morse code practices immediately following the regular scheduled progt·am. J,eft to right, above, are Lieut. Taylor, U.I\'.N.R.; Lieut.

I Joint Presentation Board Ouflines Five Enlistment Chances In a two-hour all-college assem- bly on Tuesday mo1·ning, a joint presentation board consistin-g of five officers, one from each of the atmed services, told the Student Body the details of each of the t:.:nli.:;tment opportuntiies in each of the services, as well as answering many questions put to them by interested students. Durmg the assembly, which lasted for the full two hours which the board remain- ed on campus, the representative of each of the branches presented the facts about the branch which he represented in 15-minute talks, while the remainder .of the time was devoted to answering student queries. Wikoff said that an earlier re- quest for permission to hold the week-end had been denied by the committee, which consists of Dean Charles F. F. Garis, cha-irman, Dr. Charles N. Waldron, Professor An- thony Hoadley, and Professor WH- Iiam W. Bennett. However, a re- consideraton of the problem has been under way, on the basis of a Jetter sent this week to the com- mittee by the council. First Refusal Concordiensis Meeting Hears President Fox Call Activity Essential New programs include \Music as You Like It\ and \Your South American Neighbors,\ the latter featuring music by well-known orchestra leaders of the southern nations. Scrap Metal Drive :War Work Takes Collection Saturday The board which appeared here on TuesdFJ.y will be followed in three weeks time by a similar board, whose stay here will be -longer, and whose duty it will be actually to re- cruit men for the various reserve classification. The first indicaFon of official dis- approval of the week-end came last spring with the publication of the college calenda!' for this year, which failed to mention the weelt- end. Confirmation of the belief that this omission 'had not been ac- cidental was received early this fall when representatives of the council approached Dean Garis on the mat- ter. The alternate plan suggested by the committee was for a single dance to be held Saturday night after the last home football game, with no social events on Friday. This plan was termed unsatisfac- tory by the Interf1 aternity Council representatives, who felt that it would not sErve to replace the old weekend, and that it would not be successful financially. The council officers included in their letter to the commiltee the following points which they con- sider to be the most salient argu- ments in favor of their request: 1. Though the government frowns on social functions, U. S. 0. dances are frequent. 2. This year we have more work and more pressure since marlts must be kept up for the enlisted reserve. Students should have re- laxation to relieve this pressure. 'T'wenty-three freshman candi- : dates for positions on the board of , The ·Conc0rdiensis heard an ad min- , istration leader, a faculty man, a representative of the Gazette Press and members of the managing :board describe the importance of the newspaper in a war-time college and were given details of the com·· petition by means of which the new board members will be chosen. The speakers included President Fox, Mt·. Gordon Silber, Concordien- sis faculty adviser, and Mr. Harlow Delaney, of the Gazette Press, where the newspaper is printed. The managing board was represent- ed by Robert Hayner, editor; and Norman Fox, photographic editor. The Gazette Press was also represented by Mr. Frank Chesky. President Fox, calling the news- paper, \an essential\ outlined the functions, responsibilities, and op- portunities open to members of the staff. Mr. Silber explained the func- tion of the faculty adviser, empha- sizing the freedom of action open to members of the staff.

And we can still off, win, lose or draw, and that peculiar sen- sation we wouldn't even try to describe, that you just can't help feeling, when you see that first Union touchdown chalked up. Incidentally, we've seen few football teams who have evinced as much good old fashioned spirit as has the squad this year. And the spirit which they've shown, the willingness to work, the willingness to shake off those bruises and stiff muscles through the early weeks of practice, those thiags go quite a good way toward making a good football team. And, also, if anyone is interested, we think this one is going to be just that. It's fall, and fall still means football. Long may it wave. BASIS FOR OPINION To say that student opinion is solidly be- hind the Interfraternity Council's move for reconsideration of the 1·equest for ~l Dance Weekend this fall, we think would be a p1·etty \Vell-founded statement. And we think there is basis fm· such student opinion. Union men have watched countless other colleges hold full-scale weekends, not during the regular term, but during the so-called \accelerated\ summer schedule. They have seen all branches of the service grant leaves of ab- sence to men on active duty so they could play football, baseball or even pay off their personal debts through prize fights. They have noticed these things, and it is not un-natural for them to wonde1· why the govemment should fro\\·n (and it would seem that this frown must be rather half-hearted) on \social events\ at colleges. And they won- der just how great the pressure really is on Union College. The points of arg·ument advanced by the Council seemed to us to cover the situation rather thoroughly. They are well-founded and are worthy of a good deal of thought on the part of the Committee on Student Af- fairs. Incidentally, if the pressure on the Committee is as great from above as it is from below, the problem it faces is indeed a ticklish one. As we noted a week ago, we do have faith in the level-headedness of the Student Body. The sensible way in which they have gone about bringing the matter to the attention of the Committee would seem to bear out this fact. We think, and we believe that the thought is prevalent all over the campus, that if such a week-end were to become a reality, the problem of curtailing it would not be a difficult one. We think they realize the necessity of \toning down\ any dance they might be permitted to hold, and that they would be only too willing to co-operate. METAL, NOT WOOD Under normal conditions freshmen would, tomorrow evening, be collecting wood for the traditional pre-season bonfi1•e on Council Field. Instead, the football rally has been cancelled, and, by coincidence, freshmen all over the campus are being asked to take part in the city-wide scrap metal drive. Here is an excellent example of how war turns and twists the not·mal activity of any given group, supplanting their customary offices with those having a part in the war effort. Some may call it ironical coincidence. We call it an excellent opportunity for Union College's student body to make its contribu- tion, no matter what the quantity, for there is no such thing as a \small\ part in the task of winning a war.

Little is known of the precise strength of the Trnity Blue and Gold since they will also field a squad that is not composed of many veterans. Howevel', they wil'l have the edge on the Garnet in sc; far as experience is cancer ned. The Dutchmen have been prac- ticing diligently for two weel's in an effort to start the season off on the right foot. Art Lawrence and Ralph Semerad have put the squad through long sessions every after- noon in order to mould a tea:m which will probably give a good ac- count of itself. The spirit of the eleven is excellent, and it has shown a great deal of zip in its practice sessions. Inexperience is the chief worry of Lawrence at the moment. Only two seniors wiH be in the starting line- up. Ken Sharpe is slated to start at center while Dick Hoffman will flank him on the right as right guard. Three juniors were named to start. Cliff Platt will be at left end. Bill Hill will start at left taclde while Greg McKennis will be at the right end post. Four sophc- mores were named to start their first varsity game. In the line, Hal Fox will be at the right tackle posi- tion, while in the baclif·ield Reggie Carroll will be at quarterback, Bob Bartlett at left half back, and Chet Marvin, who has come along nicely, at the right half back post. Two freshmen, Bert Muhly and Hal En- stice, were named to round out the team. The former will be stationed at left guard while the latter will be at the fu!J.back post. Trinity Veterans The Trinity squad, coached by Dan Jessee, will start four seniors, five juniors, and two sophomores. Freshmen are eligible for varsity ball, and Jessee expects about four yearlings. to see action. The Blue and Gold was hard hit by gradu- ation and the loss of Paul White, junior fullback who averaged eight yards per try last Fall against the Dutchmen, and who is now in the Navy. Seven men on the Trinity squad saw action in last year's game, Bill Black, left ha!fbacl,, will proba:bly bear a great deal of watching as he is a dangerous runner who may be shaken loose on one of the many quick opening plays which Trinity uses. The squad is not a very heavy one. Consequently Art Lawrence expects Jessee to bring a fast ag- gregation with him. Captain Art Heubner will start at one tackle while John Dolan, another veteran, will be his·running mate. John Fink and Bill Moyer are slated for the end posts, while Mike Goodspeed and John Bonee will ·be at the guard posts. Bill Starkey will be at center. An all-veteran backfield will start the game for Trinity. In addition to Black there is Chuck Foster at right half, who was a reg- ular last year, Bank Knowles, who will be stationed at quarterback, while Frank Dubovik will be at fulll.Jack. Art Lawrence is counting on his reserve strength to contribute a lot to the fortunes of the Dutchmen. Leroy .Siegel is certain to see a good deal of action in the backfield as well as Karl Klarman, Don Quigley, Hank Hoculi, and Bud Green. In the line, Johnny Newton, a fresh- man, and Ed Bates at the ends, Bill Howard and Don Carstens at tackle, Harvey Kayne, Max Slee and Ed Smith at guards, and Bob Mendelson at center should also see action. Earlier this week Trinity held a scrimmage with Springfield College and scored three touchdowns and a field goal in the one and one-half hour session. 1942 Unio:n Footba:U S.q:ua,d Off the Record Through the farsightedness of~--- the Athletic Department, the ad- ford to cut down the basic train- ministration and the desire of a ing period. It is only because per- number of students, Union Col- sons are soft, both physically and lege is taking a further step in mentally, that the Army has been the direction of effective physical held back in its attempt to hasten training for the student body. Last the training of atctlcs and the spring, cempulsory physical educa- shipment of men to the various tion for all students was authoriz- theatres of war. It is estimated ed, and now the Col'lege has made that three months ~:>f training arrangements to teach \commando could thus be saved. judo\ in the gym classes during the late fall and winter programs. We are the first college in the coWltry to adopt this kind of train- ing, and the decision to inaugurate t·his program is a tribute to the realistic understanding of the pi·es- ent woi'ld situation on the part of the administration, the athletic de- partment, and representative mem- bPrs of the student body. It is to bt> hoped that other colleges will see the sense and advisability of instituting such programc as nec- essai'Y pre-induction training for college students. Too many colleges have been adopting chicken - hearted pro- grams, and some are even on a voluntary basis. Perhaps this is a result of the complete lack of ap- preciation of the circumstances un- der which we fight for life today. It is indeed a reflection upon the easy-going ways of American so- ciety which are to be recommended in proper times and which are cer- tainly admirable in some cases. There is a good deal of evidence to support this proposition. What this <'ountry must h·arn is to be tough and not take the easy road. There is no correspondence rourse composed of ten easy les- sons which can teach a person to use a bayonet, let alone to defend himself. The art of self-defense it- self has been neglected, for it is ronsidered that those who pur- sue this ldnd of training are tramps or gangsters. To be able to defend oneself was the foremost demand in life many years ago. Today it becomes a necessity again, and learning this art does not remove the cultural dignity which is associated with colleges. Training for defense against an enemy who has train- ed fo1• physical combat since he was a child cannot be done over- night. If such training can begin ·before persons are inducted into the Army, then the Army can af- Interested in Interested in Schenectady UNION MAURICE B. GRAUBART The Jay Street Jeweler 166 Jay Street Watch and Jewelry Repairing a Specialty PARKER AND SCHAFFER PENS The idea of \commando judo\ was eoneeived by Brooks Mendell, a Syracuse graduate in the class of 1926. He applies both the phil- osophical and psycholigical ap- proaeh to this system. He has grouped together principles con- cerned with the building of the body and mind. It is defined as stressing \physical fitness through body contact and rigid, mental dis- cipline to understand and accept endm·ance, severi~· of training -and even pain.\ ME>ndeU paces his teachings according to the age, physical, mental, and psychological makt>up of each student. The end re.sult is a int<>gt•ation which leads to a sound mind through a sotmd body. Today the program serves as basic training for unarmed de- fense. It is not intended to gen- erate organized or small-scale or individual brawls as some high- minded people might think. It is not necessary to be an ath- lete i:n order to lParn the funda- mentals of \<'omrnando judo.\ So long as one has two a1•ms and two legs, he can master the com·se. The Army, Navy and Marines are now adopting such programs. The Union College program is of the same na- ture, and the colleg·e is to be con- gratulated for organizing wa.r courses direeted towru·d not only the technical problems relating to the industrial aspect of wart'are, but the pre-training of manpower for the physical aspect of war as well. Perhaps this kind of train· ing and the stimulation to be tough will create the correct cone!\pt of waging war-by offensive tactics and not defensive techniques.

The Theta Delts upset \Bullet\ Bob Hayner's highly touted D.U,'s as Whitey Carnwright intercepted a pass intended for Hayner and ran it 20 yards for a touchdown to win 6-0. The Psi U's showed considerable strength in defeating the Betas by 8-0 while the Phi Gamms encount- ered considerable difficulty in eking out a win over the Sig Chis by virtue of yardage in the over- time period. The Neutrals forfeited to the Kaps, while the Kappa Nu-Alpha Delt game was postponed. The Kappa Sigs won handily over the Delta Phis by 12-0, the Phi Sigma Delts won by the margin of a safety over Phi Sigma Kappa, and Alpha Phi Delta beat the Ph1 Delta by 8-0.
