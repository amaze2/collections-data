She was born (as we think everyone of us here to- night was). Her birthplace was Anaheim, Keukamonga and Anazuza. The year of that fateful events was 1776, and the great spirit of liberty marked her life, since from her earliest days she would allow no one to dominate her ways. Gloria displayed her independent attitude when, at the age of 10, she left home and enrolled at the Slipless Academy for Primary Erudition. Originally in the class of '28, she has worked industriously and will grad- uate this May, after 18 years of undergrad- uate life. Always active in extra-curricular activi- ties, Gloria achieved fame last Fall when she single-handedly organized the Joy Girls of It is with deep regret that the Concordiensis announces the pass- Slipless.

Mustering severely weakened forces around this point, the Union Army is dig- ging in. From here they will at- tempt to hold off a siege whiqh is expected to begin around 10 tonight. Situation Oritical The Dutchmen have little hopes of surviving for long. Union Su- preme General-in-chief Walter J. Wiggins in what may have been his last communique from the tiny garrison said, \We are outnum- bered. All my men have are small arms, effective in close combat, but of little value against mechanized resistance. We are tired, improp- erly attired, and our stomachs and pockets are empty. What can we do?'' Amazonians Prepared The Amazonians anticipated a final .successful assault. Boasting superior equipment, they are pre- pared to come. to see, and to con- quer all. The Confederates are ready for a seige and at eight o'clock were doning war paint in prepara- tion. Heavily armored and trained in the latest types of strategy, they should be able to overcome all re- sistance, Supreme Confederate Commander Ginny Joyce Gregory expected to over-run the dug-in defenses With little effort. She issued a com- munique saying that pillaging and looting would not be tolerated and that every Amazonian would be · assigned one prisoner to care for after the defenses collapsed. The enemy camp rang with the strains of \Bold and Ready,\ the Confed- erate battle hymn, as the attack- ers made ready for the final push. r -~ I

In issues before us, there have been eulogies which far surpass any efforts we might make. i\Ien who have gone before us have paid trilmte tu you through their tributes of the dates of ;vesteryear. But never has the sentiment been more intense. Neve1· have you been more welcome than you m·e tonight, tomonow, always. Some of you come from fa!' campuses to grace the Mohawk Vale. Others are the product of nearby Schenectady. Some of you are collegians. Others m·e workers. All of you are welcome. We have had the example of better men. We have seen the work of more clever writers. We have viewed the loquaciousness of more erudite editors. But, they, poor fellows, have not had the inspiration of YOU. They have not felt the warm glow of YOUR presence, seen the radiance of OUR dates for Prom. They have not known YOU. Today, you came to Union. Tonight, the college is ablaze with a splendor which may neve1· be equalled. You have been feted and petted by us. You have .seen us at what we hope is our best and have seen Union-many of you for the first time-lighted with a victorious gaiety which our predecessors were not privileged to witness. For this is truly Union College's first postwar Prom. For the first time, vast numbers of the students are retumed and are tasting the fraits of their conquests.

It has been long a fond ambition of many of the fraternities to institute a system of cooperative buying here at Union. Several times in the past, the initial step has been taken only to be thwarted by the disapproval of various alumni groups or by lack of con- certed action on the part of certain fraternity groups. Statistics have proven conclusively that there can be much benefit to the fra- ternity s;-,:stem as a whole derived from the practice of common buying. When the Interfraternity Council took up the task agaiH this year, there were the usual number of protests and the same general apathy evident which has caused the failure of such a project in othe1· ~·ears. Now, however, those of the houses in favor of this move have kept the problem before the Council in hope that at least part of the Fraternities might join and benefit from the cooperative enterprise.

Operating as a mem- ber of the 631 Club, he was noted for his uncanny ability in clearing the bar. Baseball was his first love, how- ever, and L.M.W.W. returned to Union soon afterward to resume play. In a tilt with R.P.I., he got caught attemptiny to stretch a hit. In the process, his head re- sumed its normal shape. There was only one thing wrong. The space above his eyes was hollow! Said the Queen Not dismayed, he turned his at- tention to lacrosse, becoming the first player with a built in racquet. But, alas! Again trouble. A ball got stuck in the opening. It hadn't been bad when the flrst two had gone in, but three was too many, and the good doctors, Clowe and Rourke, started to operate. Here our tale ends. Lawrence Melvin Wilfred Wittner lies buried beneath the Idol, and his only love, Yetta Sam- aver. can be seen to this day on the opening of each baseball season, mourning there, and longing to have been, offered the honor of throw- ing out the first ball. ----0,---- West Point Whips Hein Footballers Men Hein's Union College football team went down in defeat yester- day afternoon to a powerful West Point eleven, 193 to 0. at Alexander Field. The Union backfield was unable to move against the Army line, while the Garnet line showed as many openings as a basketball net. The best Union effort of the afternoon was made by fullback Bob Dake, who took an off tackle play and was thrown for only a se-ven yard loss. Andy Anderson was outstanding for the victors, scoring thirteen times and booting seven extra points.

I sU!l had hopes, after all she might have-as Johnny Mercer puts it--a well developed personality. Arriving at the club, I finally spotted the waiter through the smoke and the fan dancer's per- fume, and soon we were seated opposite one another. At last-we could confide in one another. As I rubbed hollow legs with her I began our conversation. After talk- ing about the nylon shortage and hinting that I knew where I could get some, I asked her if she'd like to dance. She sang some of the verses of \I'm A Big Girl Now\ in my ear while I exhibited my two variations of the basic two step. Finally wrenching ourselves apart, we returned to the table for one more drink. Looking through my wallet, I separated the dollar bills from the risque jokes and paid the waiter.

Having considered the question of compulsory attend- ance at Sunday Chapel from all sides, we recommend the follow- ing: I. RequiFed Attl'ndance at Fom• Sunday Chapt>l Services for Ea<'h Semt>stt\r. (a) Due to extended military service, many men haven't been home in yea-rs and since Sunday morning service interrupts the weekend, this reduction in the number of required services will enable these men and other stu- dents to have more weekends free. (bJ More than four seven-day weeks of required presence is un- favorable to the general welfare of the student body. II. Credit for Unavoidable Ab- sence. With an increase in student ac- tivities such as athletic teams, glee club concerts, etc., many stu- dents will be unavoidably absent from Sunday chapel services. Therefore, since they are partici- pating in official college business, we recommend that a half-credit of attendance per unavoidable absence be given these men. III. Collt>ctions Be Restrictt>d to Guests. Collections should be restricted to the center aisle, where guests, coming of their own volition, should be seated . IV. Honor Systt>m Instead of Written ExcusPs . We recommend that an honor system be established for stu- dents attending services of their own faith, thereby eliminating the hypocritical practice of re- quiring written excuses . V. Daily Assrmblit>s BP of a Gen- l'ral Chamcter . For next term in order to strengthen school spirit, we strongly recommend that daily assemblies be of a general char- acter <student speakers, faculty speakers, athletic rallies, band programs, choir and glee .c~ub programs, visiting celebnt1es, etc.) VI. A Broad Vit>w Maintained By All. As a final recommendation we believe it is essential that the students, faculty, and administra- tion should take a broad-minded view of this situation.

The report lists suggested improve- ments in the present system for the curr·ent term. The .report states: We of the Committee feel the need of a basic amount of religion in college life. Having considered the question of compulsory attend- ance .at Suml.ay Chapel from all sides, we recommend the follow- ing: I. Requir<'d Attendance at Fom Sunday Chapel Services for Eaeh Semester.. <a) Due to extended military service, many men haven't been home in years and since Sunday morning service interrupts the weekend, this reduction in the number of required services will enable these men and other stu- dents to have more wee!{ends free. (b) More than four seven-day weeks of required presence Js un- favorable to the general welfare of the student body. II. Credit for Unavoidable Ab- sence. With an increase in student ac- tivities such as athletic teams, glee club concerts, etc., many stu- dents will be unavoidably absent from Sunday chapel services. Therefore, since they are partici- pating in official college business, we recommend that a half-credit of attendance per unavoidable absence be given these men. HI- Collections Be R~>sb•icted to Guests. Collections should be restricted to the center aisle, where guests. coming of their own volition, should be seated. inauguration will be by ticket only. Miss Travis at the Dean's Office still has a limited number available for students desiring to attend the cet·emonies. The Student Council has been requested to assemble at Old Chapel at 9:45 tomonow morn- ing to take its place in the inaugural procession. Clases will not be held tomor- row because of Dr. Davidson's inauguration. College Placement Bureau to Resume Action This Term The graduate Council Offices of the CoHege has made the following announcement: \The College Placement Bureau is having an important meeting for all 7th and 8th term students at 12:45 p.m. on Tuesday, May 14, at Old Chapel. Members of the Senior Class will be requested to submit applications outlining thei!· employ- ment plans in order that the bureau may be of assistance to them dur- ing the balance of the ·spring term. Each member of the class will receive a personal copy of the Union College EmpJ.oyment Bulletin outlining the vacancies which have been received by the Bureau to date. It is expected that a second bulletin will be issued by June first. Men graduating will have an op- portunity to order Placement quali- lication sheets. Since 1937 and until the outbreak of the war, the College issued such sheets to all members of the senior class interested. 525 of the sheets were printed for each man at an approximate cost of $5. to the· individual. 500 were dis- tributed to 500 companies seeking IV. Honor System Written Excuses. candidates with his qualifications as Instead of outlined. The balance was turned We recommend that an honor system be established for stu- dents attending services of their own faith, thereby eliminating the hypocritical practice of re- quiring written excuses . V. Daily Ass~>mblies B~> of a Gen- €\ral Cha1•aeter • For next term in order to strengthen school spirit, we strongly r.ecommend that daily assemblies be of a -general char- acter <student speakers, faculty speakers, athletic rallies, band programs, choir and glee .c~ub programs, visiting celebntles, etc.) VI. A Broad Vi~>w Maintained By AIL As a final recommendation we believe it is essential that the students, faculty, and admin~stra­ tion should take a broad-mmded view of this situation.

The employment oppot·tunities are many, but with the return of the balance of the men in the Armed Forces with their quest for employ- ment, it is expected that the market will become tighter during the next several months.

V\'e want to thank the Administration for g-iving us an opportunitr to prove that not every dance l'nion has is a financial failure. The results of this one show that ueyond a doubt. Also we are grateful for being· allowed to have om dance on a Friday night and to have it run from ten until two o'clock.

Thanks also to our chaperones and those members of the faculty who aided om cause. Their help was deeply appreciated. We can not expres~ our gratitude to that small group of men who moved the highly essential fmnitme to the gym, and to the even smaller group who struggled to get it back to the val'ious houses after the dance. The Interfraternity Council is also deserv- ing of praise, as are the fraternities which compose it. It was largely through the effort of the Greeks that Saturday house dances were held and their 100 per cent : u~r,criptioP to the affair as:oured ib success.

Rumors have reached our humble ears that the editorial polic~- of this paper, if any, is patterned along lhe lines of thought of a certain clique on the campus and that it does not express the sentiment of the majority of students. Some have even gone so far as to state that our editorial policy should be controlled by the Student Council or some other student group other than the staff of the Concordy. In other words, the right of a free press is very fine, ml long as it pleases them, but when it irritates them it should be smothered. Natmally we don't think very highly of any person who would ue so bold as to pmpose this remedy to the situation. He evidently lacks any kno·wledge whatsoever of the problems of newspaper publishing. \Ve, and most editors, write about a subject because we have some feelings on the matter.

If the situation is at the point where cve1-::one is willing to criticize but none is \villing to help, why have a college paper at all?

In order to promote intelligent action regarding the matter, the Council members voted to hold meetings in the campus dormito1·ies, thus gaining an insight to student opinion before settlement of the affair next Monday. Fall Dance lt was announced by p1·om com- mittee chairman Wally Wiggins that a profit of $300 had been real- ized from the \Paris in the Spring\ dance two weeks ago. Discussion of another affair, to be sponsored by the Council later this month, was halted with the passing of a motion of postponement until the fall. It was decided that, under the super- vision of Spencer Gowrie of the Council, the Delphic Society would handle the matter as part of the freshmen orientation program. President Olsen announced that the Council's proposal for the es- tablishment ,of a course in journal- ism had been agreed to by Doctor Davidson. Such 8. course is to be set up in conjunction with a radio Financial Wo1·k The Council also voted tnat the staff of the Concordiensis was to be remunerated for their services, details to be arranged by the stu- dent tax committee. Other financial business consisted of the announce- ment of a possible fellowship in relation to the chapel coBections and the World Student Service Fund drive to be held on campus in the near future. The p.ossibility of establishment of a loan agency was dropped as unfeasible.

The International Relations Club is having the most intensive educational activity of its 21 year history, according to Prof. Joseph D. Doty, faculty con- sultant. Bi-weekly meetings throughout the spring term have attracted an estimated quarter of the veterans in the student body. The term pro- gram was concluded two weeks ago by a conference held in coopera- tion with the Schenectady League of Women Voters and attended by more than 250 students from 41) area high schools. Student members of the Unicn College group led discussion groups on control of atomic energy, prob- lems of empires, roll of the small nation in world peace, Russia and the Western powers, and economic and cultural international world cooperation.

SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES Since shortly before tile past Prom, Pnion has been coming nmre and more under the clouding- inflHence of the gusts of smoke billowing almost steadily from the towerin~· smoke stacks of the neighboring industrial establishments to say nothing of the college's own heating plant. It has become accepted that students and professor·s wi[:J walk to their appointed tasks through a dismal, odious pall of low hanging coal-dust. Class- rooms with open windows are i·nvaded regu- lal'l~' Ly the cmse. \\'indo\VS, desks, beds, floors, tallies, all the uncovered objects in the neighborhood are coated with the lly- product of inferior fuel. It is true that there is not much that any of us can do to remedy the unfortunate situation which places .a man in sach a position as 1.o dictate the policies of hall' a nation. It is true that the problem is much more than a local one. But it is also tme that there are possible solutions which can ue taken to lessen the discomfort afforded by the labor situation and its natmal t·e- actions, in this case, the smoke screen which has descended on Union town. Union College boasts a number of eminent scientists. The local plants have on their staffs men of practical experience in dealing with such nuisances. The problem lies in getting tog-ethel' and dissipating the cause of the complaints. We have been informed that there are mechanical contrivances which c:m easily do a way with the g-reatest part of the smoke. These controls are no doubt costly, but, in the light of the present situa- tion, it can hardl~' be doubted that any cxpenditme for such a cause will be well \\'orth the extra time, money, and care. Furthermore, it may well be within the power of the college to convince the various civic groups affected that such remedial H1easm·es might easily IJe carried out on a cit~·-wide basis to the benefit ·Of both the college anrl the neighboring parties.

FRESH:MAN ORIENTATION PROGRAM What has happened to the oft-discussed Freshman Orientation Program which was to be considered by the Student Council this term·: :.\Ia tters have p1·ogressed to such ~~ point as would \VaJTant immediate action although there is no evidence that an~· such action has been taken. Earlier in the ~'ear, the Administration announced that the plans for the Fall term provide fot· the admission of nearly three hundred r~resbman students. These men, coming to l'nion under extrao1·dinary cil·- cumstances, \Vill not find the old systems of orientation in effect. There will not be the same college spirit as was evidenced years ago. The1·e will not be the strong organiza- tion, nor the effective lectmes of ~·ester:vear. Several organizations here on the campus proposed that there be instituted a new and more efficient plan for introducing the Freshmen to the college, These propositions were, natut·ally, handed to the Student Coun- cil for conside1·ation and action. It has been relayed to us that then were committees appointed to ~\ct on the above mentioned propositions and to see that the ground worl' necessm·y for such institution be made before the termination of this semester. Where are the l'esults? Are we, the students of the College to be kept in ignor- ance of matte1·s which affect us all directly? Can there not be at least some statement of policy presented to the student body by the august body of concilors '? In line with the previous suggestions, the Concordiensis has amassed the most prac- tical. We feel that they can and should be acted upon before this term begins and the Freshmen descend on the campus v.:hich, as things stand, is not ready to receive them. First, there is the matter of songs and cheers of the college. The last few classes lwve been woefully ignorant of the ground- >mrk of the colleg-e spirit. For songs and ::heers are a large part of College spirit. We feel that the Student Council should act immediately to find a Lody capable of teach- ing and rehearsing t!)ese staples. The F'ratemities do their part but, in light of the proposed delayed rushing system, their part will be much smaller than usual. Second, the history and traditions of the college. There is not now an organization designed to handle this all-impo1·tant prob- lem. Very few of the Union men now in attendance can give more than the slightest outline of Union's long and honorable history. Can the Student Council not find some g-roup willing to undertake the task'? If they can't, the Concordiensis might suggest that the~' refer to their minutes and discover that the Delphics have offered to do just such a job. There are many other matters which might justifiably be ressurrected at this time but this paper feels that the Student Council will have sufficient activities to in- vestigate if they but lenct their talents to the above-mentioned. Therefote, we sugg-est that the Student Council spend some of their valuable time in considering such important problems as these rather than high finance which, while admittedly impmtant, is beyond their scope. If but a portion of the energ-y expended on trivia be devoted to pertinent matters, the Council may well feel that they have accom- plished the purpose for which they have been elected by their fellow students, who are in this case theil· employers. HAIL AND FAREWELL The time has come, as it must invarialJiy, to say our last farewell to the illustrious class of 1946, Skidmore. These lassies \\'ho have afforded us so man~· happy, leisurely hours, v<;ho have graced our p1·oms, have at last reached the goal toward which we are all striving. Theirs is the world. We have laughed with, cl\ied with, dranl\ with, walked, talked, dined with them. We have cried for them. Some few of us have died for them. And now, by virtue of the Skidmore faculty, they are leaving us to solitary brooding- over our bool\s. This week, Skidmore graduates one of its most distinguished groups. Sunday after- noon, many of them return to fm·-off homes out of om· reach but not out of om· hearts. To those we have never had the pleasure of meeting, we can only say that we are sorry never to have made their acquaintance. The die is cast, the Rubicon crossed. We have reached the crossroads in our short but eventful f!'iendship. So, we, on behalf of the students of Union College say Aloha to the class of 1946 and hello to the class of 1950. Pertinent Points Related By Experienced Observer ~rom Camera-City College Editor~s Note: Bacl~ in December of 1939, a rather clevt•r ai•ficle was printed in the Concordy.

R E S·E A R C H AN D ENG IN E ERIN G KEEP G EN ERA l El E C TR I C YEA R S AHEAD LIGHTING AT GENERAL ELECTRIC T HE amount of knowledge accum- uln ted in lamp making is enormous. Some of this knowledge is committed to paper, but much of it is to be found only in the minds of techniml and production men in the laboratories and in the factories. Among these men are scores who, on leaving their teC\hnical colleges, have since directc-d their sperial training to developing better lamps for less money. The manufacturing opei'ations of General Electric's Lamp Department are far-flung, its 36 plants being scat- tered about the rountry in 17 cities. Altogether they add up to 94 acres of floor space roughly equivalent to an eight-story, mile-long factory a hun- dred feet wide, The goal of G-E Lamp Research has always been to produce the best possible lamps for every lighting serv- ice-at the lowest cost. Over the years lamp prices have been repeat- edly reduced while lamp efficiency has steadily improved. For example, the present 60-watt lamp bulb is 56 per cent brighter than its ancestor of 1923, yet costs only one-quarter as much. General Electric Co., Schenectady, N.Y.

Perhaps it shall be produced by the return of football, oe by the retum of fratemities to their own hoHses, or by the arrival of a new group. Wha teve1· be the cause, we certainly hope that there shall be one. Such impetus, however, should not be necessary. School spirit, the cooperative urg-e, is an innate thing. It should not have to be forced upon the students. In the fall. when we return to normalc~.: for the first time in many years, the Con- cordiensis shall attempt to reorg-anize. Two major steps shall be the acquiring of a larger office and the pa~·ment of the Editorial Staff. The big factor', however, lies in the hands .of the student body.

IlQw can anr one person say farewell to such a class as that of 1946. It is tme that there are among the g-raduates some few who originally were members of the Fresh- man group who entered upon l'nion's campus some four rears ago in 19!2. It is true that many of these men have been fo1·tunate or not so fortunate in the matter of remaining here at l'nion dming the war years. It is, however, equally true that there are among the graduates representatives from virtually every class from 19-12 to 1948. :\len have re- tumed unexpectedly to complete their col- lege courses; others have accelerated and will leave the college before their normal time. The class of 19~!6, for· such it must be termed, is unique in that it embodies not only the spil'it of past and futm·e classes but also includes a substantial numbet· of their members. When the class of 19-16 first carne to th.is campus, it was collectively confronted with the transition fr·om a peacetime college to a wartime machine. The class was, and is, to this day, disjointed, confused. The acceler- ation program brought man;\· of its members to premature maturity~thr·ough the sober- ing medium of total war, others were shoved unceremoniously forward to places in classes far ahead of them. The class of 19.t6 has never had the advantage of complete unit~· and the organization which unitr of itself entails. Despite the obstacles thrown before it, this me a program.
