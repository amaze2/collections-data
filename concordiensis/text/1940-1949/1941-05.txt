Born about 1823, living at one time in Albany, Spencer emba1 ked upon a turbulant academic career at Hobart College, where he stayed for nearly three years. Unfortun- ately, the college administration at length found it difficult to sympa- thize with his effervescent enthus- iasm for getting into mischief, and on May 7, 1841, he launched his sec- ond endeavor to succeed scholas- tically, entering Union College. His tenure at Union was :brief, but not too brief to ena:ble him, in the re- cesses of the South College that now stands, to inaugurate the em- biyonic structure and rituals of the Chi Psi Fraternity. The official da:te of the founding was May 20, 1841, in conjunction with the eight other immortals of Chi Psi: James C. Duane, Alexander P. Berthoud. Jacob H. Farrell, John Brush, J·r., Robert H. McFaddin, Samuel T. Tabor, James L. Witherspoon, and William F. Terhune. In July, 1841, Spencer left Union, and received a warrant as acting mid-shipman in the United States Navy, through the influence of his father, John C. Spencer, Secretary of War under the Tyler administra- tion. After a ·period of instruction in the New York Navy Yard, he Tidmarsh to Feature Modern Composers The music of the ·more modern of the French, EngliEh, and Ameri- can school of composerE will be featured by Dr. Elmer A.

There are really only two bases upon which men on a single campus may make an up- pmisal of the worth of a national fratemity. One base is the history of the fratemity as a national organization and that of the men who T1ave been its members. The other base is the record of the cmTent achievement and membership of the fratemity chupter on the single campus. Consideration of both these l.Jases com- mends Chi Psi to the Union campus as a group of friendly, cooperative, and capable men with a history of which any group could be proud. The history of Chi Psi Fraternity is one of the active part taken by chapters on over twenty-five campuses in the develop- ment of thei1· respective colleges. Added to it, is the record of men of ability from Philip Spencer. the fratemity's founder, t·ight down to the present, and the contril.Jutions these men have made to the l'nited States. The .story of the Chi Psi mother chapter on the l'nion campus i:s one of full assump- tion of a sense of responsil.Jility for the wel- fare of the college community, of democracy of membership opportunity, and of gem·ral cont1·ibu tion toward making the campus a friendly place. Chi Psi men have taken the bm·dens of l.'nion campus, athletic, and activ- ities responsibilities and have carried them to successful completion in many fields. From the ~ootl.Jall field with leadership of such men as Guibert. Baker. Norris, and Sharpe, to social activity through the agency of Prom Chairman l\IcCandless to debate work of :\Iarshall to this very newspaper where Twin- ing led very ably, the life of Cnion has been implemented and made more effective bv the activity of Chi Psi men. · One hundred ~·ears of sustained leadership of this sort can only lead to many more years of the expansion of and contribution by Chi Psi Fraternity. We can only wish the Chi Psi's anothH centmy of similar leadership among the col- lege men of America. Our Collegiate Contemporaries University of Minnesota students and .faculty mem- bers are planning their first joint hobby show.- fACPl .. Fitst men's college to :buy an ambulance for the Brlfish-American Ambulance corps, Amherst college has received a permit for ambulance No. 394.-<ACP) Conference To act in this fashion would be, to our mind: 1. To offset the psychological p1·essm·es upon members of the student body, a pm- gram should be organized by the administra- tion to make clear to the student body that, while the task of remaining in college and continuing a normal college caree1· is diffi- cult, it is nonetheless the most important task before them. A portion of this program should be devoted to practical exposition of the place a college student could take either in the existing emergency or in the 1·oad back from it. The men of the week are most certainly the members of the Stu· dent Committee for pemocracy who efficiently handled the three d·ay conference of \Colleges In De- fense of Democracy.\ Scene tips its hat! Housebreaking The Russell Sage delegates to the SCD conference thought the Waldron home \heaven.\ Break- fast in bed and Mrs. Waldron's raised eyebrows because they made their beds in the morning contrib- uted to their fine opinion of their hosts. 2. A courageous and thOl'ough recast right now of all extra-curricular activities so that the most good may be derived from the in- evitable reduction in total student tax reve- nue that will result from decreased enroll- ment. This implies intelligent slashing- and allocation of funds only to that combination of activities wherefrom the student body as a \\·hole may gain the most advantage. It is no longer adequate for student and faculty agencies to allocate reduced funds on the basis of activities accounts many of which were instituted under different needs and pressures. 3. A specific outline made available by the faculty to the student l.Jody as to the amount of college credit they may count upon, should the exigencies of current affairs force them temporarily to terminate their collegiate careers. 4. A continuation of the present policy of uttempting-, by alumni and other private donations, to enable the college to offer the same educational opportunity as it has in the past. To take action of a consolidating nature when the need for such action is not directly upon us is always difficult. For Union to profit best by the example of World War I and to enable her and her student body to weather best the present storm, however, such action should be begun now. To beg-in action now is to enal.Jle the mem- bers of the three lower classes-and the members of the class of '45-to feel in their own minds that their college, at least, is an institution whose policy for the next few years of the current emergency has been clarified. It will ena:ble them to feel that their college is one rock upon which they can always lean. But that wasn't what we wanted to say. One uf the girls was in a hurry to change .for the dance Sat· urday evening and found herself locked out of the Waldron house. Her date was due to take her to dinner any moment and she des- paired of being ready. So she cried on the shoulders of one of the Union delegates and he became her Sir Galahad. He dE-termined to break into the house despite her pleas not to. After a struggle with the window of the guest chamber and a bout ..,vith the cm·tains he climbed out on the roof over the Waldron's back porch and then came the break into the Waldron's home. First trouble was with the screen. A loose slate pried it up and Sir I Galahad climbed in-to find him-~ self standing on top of a wash bowl. Lost, he groped for the stairs., found the kit.t\hen. opened the back door and let thP girl in. A Bit Sharp Best story of the whole confer- er.ce is the one about the delegate from New York who mistook the c]e:J.r boullion served at Friday j night's dinnPl' for tea. He squeezed the lemon in, put two spoonfulls of sugar and asked for cream \for his tea.'' Told there was no cream. t.e muttered something about al- ways having cream in his tea at home. The tea, he said, \was a bit sharp.\ Socializing Factor The best part of any conference including the SCD was the chance to meet people, especially members of the opposite sex, the delegates agreed. With this in mind we pass along a few items. A female delegate from NYU was being shown Jackson's Gar- dens by a Union man. They raced paper boats for a soda but never got one because she fell into Hans Groot Kill while trying to rescue one of the boats. A Union junior <who wished to remain unknown) reported success in reviving a Skidmore romance dead since his freshman year. The Smith delegate was driven from Smith to Union by her Duke \steady.\ The week-end was a grand lark fm· both •of them. They attended Dr. Langsam's lecture to- gether and missed the rest of the conference. But they did enjoy the athletic events, the concert and the dance. 'Twas a grand excuse for a week end together with no permis-[ sions to make. Bow you get late news ... so early So much that's imp~rtant is happening today-in America,' in Europe, Africa, Asia.

Thomson, Union, '00, Glenridge, N. J., ditectot· of public relations of the Western Elect ric Company, as the president of the Union College chapter of Chi Psi, the \Mother Alpha\ of the 25 na- tional chapters spread from Maine to California, presided at the pub- lic exercises in the Memorial Chapel, and at the presentation of the Chi Psi's centennial gift, an en- dowed \alcove on human relations\ in the College library. ·President D!Xon Ryan Fox of Union College said: \The national fraternity of Chi Psi, now ,com- memorating its .foundation at Union College a hundred years ago, has shown high intelligence in choosing the forms of it..s memorial: In en- dowing an alcove in our college li- braty it has indicated that any un- der-graduate chapter exists only as a part of its college. In choosing books, and a continual stream of books as its gift, it has recognized that the social education which the student acquires in his fraternity house is but supplementary to his intellectual development under col- lege auspices.\ Fraternity Position in Democracy Regarding the 1 elationship of fra- ternities to higher education, Pt·esi- dent Fox concluded that \A well managed fraternity chapter is, in my opinion, an educational asset on any campus.\ He emphasized that \if· wise leadership fait<> Is . .fra·tern- ities may degenerate into useless- ness and death, like any other hu- man institution.\ The Rev. Dr. Rockwell Harmon Potter, dean of the Hartford ThPo- logical Seminary and a graduate of Union College, whose academic founder, Dirck Romeyn, was his great-great uncle, spoke on the place of college fraternities in American democracy. He said: \The measure of a man's participation in the higher things of life-his hope, his faith, his love too- is the meas- ure of his identification with his fellow men.\ Mr. Thomson then introduced Dr. Carl E. McCombs, director of the Institute of Public Administration in New York City, a graduate of Union College, as the author of the official centennial song. Dr. Mc- ,Com'bs led the audience in singing it. Mr. Merrill said that the Chi Psi centennial gift to the college is an expression of assurance to \all edu· cators that we propose to carry on the important part which repre- sents the national fraternities' con- tribution to the country's system of • higher education.\ Mt·. Todd, prominent New York attorney, in accepting the gift, ple- sented the \affectionate greetings\ of the four fraternities which pre- ceded Chi Psi at Union: Kappa Alpha, Sigma Phi, Delta Phi. an~ Psi Upsilon. He said the .Chr Pst alcove represented a dona.tion of \life blood\ to the \heart of an edu- cational -institution\-the library. He added later the hope that \the spirit of human relations, of which Chi Psi is such a notabl<> exemplar, may soon find a way to replace the great -Churchill's vivid slogan of 'Blood and Tears, Toil and Sweat,' with the most cherished blessing of Christ's birth-'Peace on Earth, Good Will Toward Men'.\ A delegation o.r Chi Psi members, headed ·by past president, Albert S Bard, made a -pilgrimage to the Al- bany rural cemetery and placed a wreath upon the .graves of John C. Spencer and his wife. the father and mother of Philip Spencer, \martyred-hero\ founder of Chi Psi. Philip was executed at sea, one day's sailing from land, on a charge of alleged mutiny on the U. S.

I Prom Closes Ticket Sale I E~idemic _of Measles Hzts Hamzlton Campus Wednesday Hamilton College suffered an outbreak of over 12 cases of measl8s last week forcing the Redrawing for Booths cancellation of their sub-freshman , , I weeliend, an a-capella choir per- Wednesday; Fmanc1a rarmance. and the possible can- s I P d • t d ce!lation of their houseparty UCCeSS S re IC e weekend. The ticltet sale .for the 1941 Jun- ior Prom will be closed at noon on Wednesday, May 7, it was an- nounced today by Edward R. Eu- stice, '42, chairman of the Junior Pt om ticket sales committee. At this time all tickets must be turned in to him at the Student Activities Office between one and one-thirty P. M. by the fraternity and neutral representatives. Thereafter all ticket sales will be hand:ed through the Student Activities Office or through sales at the door on the night of the Prom. Eusti-ce rPpor~ed that ticl,et sales were going very well and expressed complete confidence that the Prom would be a financial success. There are no exact figures on the total sales to date, but evety indication points toward a large turnout. Re- ports which have come in ft om the fraternity representatives show that a very large delegation from this group can be expected and several houses are setting new attencance records. Although it is difficult to make such an early ptediction about the neutrals, Enstice said that from the reports which had come in a large neutral turnout also is expected. Due to a misunderstanding in the first drawing for the Prom ,booths two weel>s ago, a red1awing will be necessary. This redrawing will take place in the Trophy Room of the Gymnasium at 1:15 on Wednesday. All r.epresenL<ttives are to meet with Robert Davis, '42, at this time, and any group that is not rep1 e- sented will have to take whatever booths are left aftel the drawing has been completed. The final arrangements for the Prom 'broadcast at 11:30 over WGY have been completed 'bY the Radio Workshop, and at the present time Milton Enzer is working on the pro- gram that will be presented. Early this year two Union fra- ternities and one dormitory were quaranteened because of measles. The 12 Hamilton students are suf- feting from German Measles, a mild version of the disease. They have been ordered to spend three days in the infirmary. The Ger- man Measles usually do not last over 48 hours. Since April 17 there have been a total of 21 cases of measles at Hamilton. Funds Are Needed For Organ Repairs Replacement of Valves Desired Before 500th Tidmarsh Organ Recital In anticipation of the 500th weelt- ly organ t·ecital, an effort is being made to collect funds from which to mal'e necessary repairs to the organ. William J. Stillman, '42, has written a small leaflet which has been distributed for purposes of re- ceiving ·money fot· these repairs from the large audiences that have attended the 493 recitals that have been given since 1925 The Casavant Freres organ in the Memorial Chapel is considered one of the finest organs in the r:ountry. Outstanding artists who have played on it have commented on its fine tonal quality and instant response. Dr. Tidmarsh ·has been successful in bringing such distin- guished m·usicians as Marcel Dupre, Harry Rowe Shelley, and Joseph Bonnet to Union College for con- certs. Brigadier-General Hershey, acting director of selective service, has in- terpreted the amendment by stat- ing, \In our opinion the induction of a registrant at the normal time may result in •unusual individual hardship' if the registrant requires additional time within which to complete a course of training or instruction, take an examination af-ter completing such a course.\ Four other situations are also in- cluded in the interpretation. The amendment to the regula- tions and its interpretation are as applicable to a student completing a course dut ing a summer session as during the regular academic year, the American Council on Edu- cation points out. They also may a·pply to any studenf regardless of his course or year in college. Such postponement of induction, how- ever, is not on a blanl,et basis, but the local draft board must make its decision on the facts of each case pt esented to it. Future Groups Deferrt-d Discussing the possible applica- tion of the new regulation to col- lege students next fall, the Amer- ican Council on Education said after many conferences with the national headquarters staff of the selective service system: \If as now seems proba-ble, t)1ose who have :be- come 21 since last October 16 are 1 equired to register on Oct. 16, 1941, such student will fall within the group for whom unusual hardship will exist, as they will .be well into the semester's work before their order numbers are determined. If registration is held during the sum- mer, the same principle will also apply to the new registrant:.\ The bulletin of the American Council on Education also outlines the conditions under which college students now registered under the selective service act may be defer- red after the close of the present semester. Colleges and universities are ·permitted to ask local draft boards for six months' deferment of students in training in preparation for an occupation necessary to the national health, safety, or interest. Students so deferred are classed as 2A, and alt,hough classification and deferment is for a six months' period, it may be renewed if th<> student still is in training. Many pre-medical, engineering, and other students are expected to receive de- ferment. ----a---- Make-up Registration Students Discuss Price Management Radio Audience Asked To Pick Best Speaker In Sunday Broadcast Four Goodrich-Duane extempor- aneous debate contest finalists agreed that the implications for American democracy of President Rooseevlt's executive order estab- lishing the office of price adminis- tration and civilian supply at·e prac- tical and individual and that each problem the office attacks has its separate procedmes and results in the Empire State Forum Meeting broadcast Sunday afternoon. The four students, who with Pro- fessor Douglas W. Campbell, dis- cussed this topical problem were Edgar Fisher, '42, Raymond Male, '41, Robert Frelick, '41, and Roger D. Marshall, '41. \We can',t generalize about this agency,\ said Prof. Campbell. \It is a coordinating agency that is try- ing to use persuasion and it is try- ing industry by industry, commod- ity ,by commodity, to tackle each problem that comes up :before it,\ As an example, the tecent freezing of prices in the steel industry was mentioned. In the ·beginning of the round- ta-ble discussion, Fisher pointed out that the agency is designed to cut out \price spiraling, profiteering, price speculation and hoarding.\ As it has been set up, it will at- tempt first to handle the problem of national defense and later that of the consumer. Matshall taised the question of whether this agency would attempt \to run the entire defense show,'' however, it was generally agreed that it is more of a coordinating than a pressure committee, drawing its powers from many sources and acting in an advisory capacity to the president. Function of Price Managemi\nt The debators were agreed that the rise of wages must be carefully watched to prevent the appearance of inflation, which Marshall defined as \the malplacement of income.\ Frelick pointed out that it is to the government's advantage to lteep prices down and that the ·govern- ment was taking out of the hands of private interests many problems which they have not coped with with a great amount of success. Male stated that it is \a middle road between the speed of dictator- ship and the slowness of democ- racy.\ A general disagteement a!bout the relative good and bad points of democracy's slow action l'esulted. In summing up, Prof. ·Campbell said, \We are trying to find ways to equip om·~<'IV<'S fm· national de- fense, 'but we ·are still not <'ertain of how much of the new deal is necessary for normal times.\ The radio audience was asked to submit its decision as to who was the best spealter in the roundtable discussion. The results will be made known in several weeks. Dr. Taylor, who i~ faculty ad- vieor, spoke of the value of sing- ing \together\ as a uniting force in the national crisis whtch faces AmE'rica today. \Mu~ic can both entertain and bind people to- gether,\ he said. In the future the club would re- member sna.tche~ of the hymn~ they had sung and might find them a r·eal comfort, Dr. Taylor thought. ThPy had prond helpful to him nnct had helpPd to keep his ~pirit strong in times of need. SpirituaJ Quality P1·aised The fmall mistakes of the club were dismis<ed af nothing by \Herb\ Houghton who pointed to the spiritual quality of the club which had created an organization that could not be beaten down. He invited the club to sing at his wedding because of the very deep attachment he has felt for the or- ganization. Surprise at how far reaching and how many appearances were made by the club was expressed by Dr. Tidmareh, faculty director. He laid the \undefinable spirit of this or- ganization\ to hard work and to the devotion of its members to music. He pointed out that only one-third of the freshmen stay out for the club but those who do are rewardtd by a sense of achieve- ment and four years of pleasure through contact with an organiza- tion that seeks to bring the most out of every man. \The ~urface does not hold the treasure.\ he said. The fellowship of the trips was called a second fountain of youth when Dr. Tidmarsh explained that \nothing keeps me as young as going on trips.\ \You have all been gentleman,\ he said. \I have never had to scold or warn. The Epirit of being a gen- tleman and a member of the Glee Club are synonymous.\ Draftees Speal• Draftees James Stillman, '42, El- wood Starn, '44, and Walter Thies- sen, '42, felt that the Glee Club was something to look forward to through a year of Army life. Kenneth Mackenzie, retiring co- leader, pointed to the advantages that the club offered in bringing its members a love of good music, a sense of responsibility, and a chance to lead and to co-operate. Both he, Paul Be,;t, and Edmund kelly paid tribute to Dr. Tidmarsh as teach- ing them to strive for perfection and of being truly critical of their own work. Manager Kelly released a report which pointed out that the club had made forty-three appearances this season compared to twenty- three last year. \Usually the Glee Club is an expensive activity to the student bCJdy and the loss has been in proportion to the number of ap- pearances. However. this season has been a great financial success and a fine surplus has been re- alized. The new piano in Memorial Chapel has been purchased through a loan from the director, Dr. Tid- marsh, and the balance will be paid to him from this ~·ear':< sur- plus,'' the report read. Final details for the drawing of the favors at the Monte Carlo rou- lette tables are being worl,ed out by the committee under Jacob Van Aernum, '42. As such a large ticket sale is expected, more than the four tables originally planned for will have to be used. Arrangements are now being made with Balfour for two more tables. Having six tables to use in thP drawings instead of four will greatly speed up the pres- entations of the favors, he stated. The leather valves of the \Choir Organ\ are weating out, and they need immediate replacement. In order to keep the organ in -good condition it is imperative to make these replacements now to prevent serious deterioration. The cost of the -repairs amounts to approxi- matE-ly $600. If sufficiE>nt funds can be raised, a harp will be added to enrich th£> calm of the organ. This appeal for a donation is be- ing made to the friends of the Col- lege and to the music-Joveis of the Capital Distl'ict, Registration for make-up exams to be given on Monday, May 12, must be made at the Office or the Dean before five o'clocl{, Wednes- day, May 7. Students must obtain at the Dean's Office a slip to be signed by the instructor giving the course. ret urn the slip to the office and pay a registration fee of one dol!aL', Radio station officials stated that this discussion, which was entirely unrehearsed and unprepared, was one of the best student 10undtables ever to be presented, and they also exp1 essed the opinion that it was one of the most interesting Empire State Town Meetings to be present- ed since its inception. Gold l'eys were awarded to: Her- bert R. Smith, John L. Grow, George W. Clark, Edward P. Flie- gel, Franklin Atwater, Paul Jones, Walter Thiessen, Edward Schulze, Baldwin Lucke, and Elliot Hertz- mark. The 43 Glee Club appearances will have been made between Sep- tember 28, when a quartet was teie- vised over W2XOY, and June 8, when the club will combine with others of Dr. Tidmarsh's Male Clubs in the Memorial Chapel.

We hope that you had an en.i oya.i.Jle tl·ip to Schenectady, and that you arrived in :mffi- cient time for an early dinne1· tonig·ht. You have already heard Anna Kaskas and a por- tion of Benny Goodman's prog-ram; the rest of the Prom dance, house parties, picnics, the :Mountebanks' play, athletic contests, and host of other events remain before you. Dickinson E. Griffith, outgoing Chairman of the Student Council and President of the Student Body, was a Council Chairman v;ith whose ideas on the theory of Union student government we disagreed. Despite this dif- ference of opinion-which is perhaps the essence of democracy-we always recognized Chairman Gl'iffith as a man with a sincere interest in doing a good job, and as one who was a conscientious perrorme1· of his duties. .. Dick\ Griffith was a campus leader with the !.Jest inte1·est of the college at heart. He has set a fine example as an interested, sin- cere, l.'nion man. To nwst peop1e, howc>ver, we think the thing that lingers long- est is the choice, priceless way that feminine gaity lightens the u~ual academic drabness of the ftaternity house. The light spring costumes, the clatter of high heels, and the sweet musical laughter of gil\lish voices. These are the things that remain in memory. Especially t.he night after Prom at the never- to-be-forgotten house parties. House parties that begin by being bubbly and remain bubbly through- out the evE>ning. House parties that incur the feverish flitting from PUC part of the campus to the other in ,search of better music, and bet- let· company with better spirits. There are those that prefer the sanctity of their own fraternity houses, but we arc of the opinion that those are either too lazy or t•oo imbuPd with their own good spit·its to det ive any special bPnP- fit fl'Dm those any one else may ha V(' to offer. v. hich \this ain't nothing compared ~~;;~;;~;;;;~~;;;~~~;; to.\ A newspapet· to read the likes r; \\ou may find your esco1·t full of activity.

Right now, ·while you are in Prom inter- mission, the Union campus wants you to know that it is great having all of you ·with us this week-end-and that you all look beau- tiful.

We wish to point out again in these col- umns our suggestions for meeting two of the many pt\oblems vdth which the new officers will be faced: 1. The student government elective system under which we no\v vote is one that reduces student body participation to a minimum. It reduces student body interest to a minimum, thel'efore. The system needs changes that will: a. ~lake norninations open and permit membet·s of a class to nominate at least a portion of the men whose names will be placed before them, as against the present system when the small Student Council group in the class above makes up the list of nominees. b. ;.\lake more than 5 ~( of a student body of 750 men eligible to vote for Student Body President-Student Council Chairman. c. :\lake times of elections known suffi- ciently early so that students may arrange their schedule so as to be able to cast their vote. d. Make public the record of all men whose names appear on the ballot so that all voters may know all those up for election. 2. The campus sorely needs a series of small, inexpensive, informal social functions for the next academic year. Support accord- ed the Glee Club dance and the Sophomore Hop has demonstrated that the student body will back functions of this sort, These functions, beyond affording oppor- tunity fot· an enjoyable aftemoon or evening _ for all concemed, would have the effect of § TO UNION MEN and UNION DATES: Every Prom Weekend has certain thrills- One of the most important is a visit to the VAN CURLER TAP ROOM - - James Henry Meriwether Henderson, graduate stu- dent at the University of Wisconsin, received a lettPr mailed in Washington, D.

There were also house favors for the girls. In the early twenties the favori·te dances of prom goers were the Shin,mc>y, the Black-bottom and the Charleston. Another Union alumnus told the Concordiensis that dancers used these dances as often as promguers jitterbug now. \The Concordiensis\ editorialized against the shimmey as dangm·ous, degrad- ing and immoral. Dr. Bronne1· recalled that every prom was distinguished by a prom song, a song uf the year. \You just don't have a single song anymore that everybody wants to hear. We used -to have one and it was played six or seven times during the eve- ning. Songs like \Whispering\ and the \Japanese Sandman,\ he said. Thet·e was much more drinking than there is now, Dr. Bronner said. \Every student had his hip flask and private stoclr. It certainly was possible that some of them made their own, he guessed. Students knew who the bootleggers were and one or two students picked up small change doing a bit of bootlegging on the side. Prohibition agents were never attracted to the campus as fat· as Bronner knew. Today stu- dents drink less because \they can get it anywhere\ Dr. Bronner said. \Big Time\ Orchestra Then, as today, the prom com- mittee Imported \big time\ orches- tras. Often, because of the uncer- tainties of motor bus transporta- tion, they were late. Only the other day Dr. Bronner ran across an item in one of the newspapers saying that Witstein's orchestra, which had played at his Junior Prom, was still going strung in Bermuda. President Richmond, unlike the Foxe~ appeared only at the prom and then for a brief time. He and I Mrs. Rkhmond did not attend fra- ternity house dances. Fraternities then did not have the democratic spirit they now have. Most of them would not let members of other fraternities above the first floors. Invitations to out- siders were fewer. Dr. Bronner re- called an old DU trick of organ- izing couples into single file and pai'ading through fraternity houses fl·om the back to the front doors. The group his junior year proceed- ed through an amazed Phi Gamma Delta house and then started through the Beta Theta Pi house to be met by Betas and their dates in a singing circle before the fireplace. The DUs were frozen out. \Yes Dr. Bronner said, \they did more, much more during their weekend. in the twenties but they didn't have a better time than you will Friday night.'' -------· ----- Notables Present at \Nels Nitchman Day\ Union gave Nels Nitchman, retiring basketball and football coach, a r~.>al send-off in daily assembly yesterday.

Dick Balch, who quarterbacked Nel's teams for the past three sea- sons, made the presentation.

Tomorrow's will be its first official match, though it has played two practice tilts with Wil- liams, coming off second best in both. Uaion will thus reign a heavy favorite. Union and the Fighting Engi- neers have met twice in lacrosse. In 1938 Union won, 15-3, and last year the Engineers bowed again by 15-0. In their first practice ses- sion with Wiiiiams, the Cherry and vVhiters were beaten, 10--3. No rec- ord was kept of the return match. The Engineers will find Union back at full strength. The Dutch- men were hampered by the ab- sence of regulars Paul SanteP and Bob Corby against Williams. Both were ineligible, but will probably start tomorrow.

Pictures now at the college show cap-and-gowned undergraduates gathered around the old Nett Elm in these same ex- erci::es more than a half-century ago. The original Nott Elm, planted just across the college brook in Jackson's Gardens in a natural am- phitheatre by Eliphalet Nott, was cut down several years ago. A shoot of the elm has been nurtured, however, and is fast growing into another giant elm.

The program tonight wi'll conc!ud~ ~he 1940-41 activities of the assocratwn of which Dr. James M. Dunn is president. . . Mre. Fox will speak on \Pamting the History of Schenectarly and the College,\ and will illustrate her talk with a large painted sketch which she used as a basis for a mural 20 feet by eight feet, ohe paint~d in the Sigma Phi place on the campus. In this mural she has woven the Eignificant features of Old Schenectady and Old l.'nion into an integrated picture which has attracted considerable atttm- tion. Mrs. Fox began her art career in Cleveland. She painted an in- dustrial mural for thn McKinney Steel Company. After teaching art at Oberlin College for three years, she moved to Schenedady when Professor Fox joined the Union Col- lege faculty in the maih<}rnatics de- partment. While here, Mrs. Fox has tauo-ht in the Brown School, Nott Ter~·ace High Schooi and Central Parlt Junior High Schools. She sens her sltetches to department stores and newspapers. Hamilton's epidemic of German measles has apparently ended and the annual spring house parties were held as per schedule last Saturday night. Letters informing all the dates that the college had had a mild outbreak of German measles wer·e sent out by Dean Campbell Dielt- son early last week. The letters stated however that there are at present only four cases in the in- lirmary. The Germa-n measles were brought to the Hamilton campus by Elwood G. Dre:,er when he re- turned fr·om his spring vacation at Ridgew0od, N. J. HE' gavE' them to his fraternity brothers, the Chi Psis, who \mov- ed their lodge, goat, room, and barrel to the Infirmary. To Unveil Statue At Commencement Huge Chester Arthur Monument Presented For Campus Landmark A ten-foot bronze statue of Chester A. Arthur, 21st President of the United States and a gmduate of Union in 1848, has been pre- sented to Union College. It will probably be unveiled during the commencement exercises, President Dixon Ryan Fox revealed recently. The statue formerly stood on the Fultonville estate of the late Com- modore John Starin. The statue arrived by truck last week and preparations for its erection are now being made for its installation on a granite base. The site has not yet been chosen. At present, the statue is lending its imposing appearance to the heating plant yard. The more than life-size casting was made at the order of the late Commodore Starin in the 1880's and since stood in a prominent p!J- sition on his estate. Commodore Starin was a leader in the transport business in New York Harbor·, and built and man- aged numerous steamboats en- gaged in freight and passenger service. The property recently passed to a Roman Catholic sisterhood. In the settlement, the gift to Union was made by Miss Marguerite Spraker of St. Johnsville and New York City, a grand-daughter of Commodore Starin. President Arthur himself, was born in 1830. After a long career in politics, he was elected Vice- President under President Gar- field. Upon Garfield's assassination, he assumed the Presidency, and soon earned the right to this high office through his high-minded and incorruptibility. 0·----- 1820 Reports Reveal Contemporary Analogy Actions of the Trustees of Union College on problems which have contemporary significance were discovered in the Trustees' Minutes for July 26, 1820 recently by Sid- ney Smith, assistant college li- brarian. Faced with a financial crrsrs such as is expected .during the next few years because of curtailed en- rollment due to the draft and the war, the Trustees resolved \that twenty per cent be deducted dur- ing the present depressed state of the college funds from the salary of the President and Professors.\ The same day, they resolved ''that no student shall enter college hereafter under fifteen years of age.\ The practice of compulsory non- resident student dining on the campus was also originated when they decided that \if any student not belonging to Schenectady shall board off of the college premises he shall be charged and pay to the Institution twenty cents per week during the time he shall so board. In case of sickness or necessity the above charge shall be remit- ted.\ Even today, 11 dormitory resi- dents are required by the Trus- tees to eat at least five days a week in Hale House if they do not eat in fraternities or work for their board.

Ralph H. Tapscott, '09, president of the Consolidated Edison Com- pany, who knew Dr. Berg when he wa.::; \consulting professor of engi- neer-ing\ in 1908-09 at Union before his formal attachment to the fac- ulty, will be toastmaster at the din- ne;. F. Michler Bishop, '24, exec- utive secretary of the New York C:ity Alumni Association of Union and an M.S. in E E., will speak on behalf of the alumni. President Dixon Ryan Fox will accept the portrait for the college. One of Union's most colorful tra- ditions will be resumed this Thurs- day and Friday at Daily Assembly when the annual Movi:1g-up Day ceremonies will take place. It is the symbolic \moving up\ of all clas>es, seniors back to the seats they held as freshmen four years ago, and present freshmen down- stairs from the hated seats in the balcony. It is a ceremony that, for the seniors at least, will conjure up many a memory of the past four years, which have moved along with the startling suddenness pe- culiar to year·s spent in college. As has been the case in the paEt few years, the ceremonies will oc- cupy the assembly periods for both days. On Thursday, fifteen mem- bers of the Class of 1943 will be cho~en as memberE of the Garnet Key Society, the honorary Junior Class Group. Then will take place the historic \tapping\ of the men chosen to be next year's Te!\l'ace Council. Following the time-honor- ed custom, the present Junior class will march around the chapel and pass in front of the current Ter- race Council, who will be gathered in the chancel. The claEs will march around until Eeven members have been \tapped by means of a ma- neuver somewhact similar to a fly- ing tackle. On Friday, ceremonies of a more realistic and practical nature will be added to the purely traditional. Newly elected delegates making up next year's Student Council wti! be sworn into office by President Dick- inEon E. Griffith, '41, outgoing offi- cial. In addition, the officers for next year, Robert E. Killian, Abra- ham Dor<man, and Avery Beer, president, :;-ecretary, and treasurer, respectively, will be inducted. Grif- fith will charge these new men as to their duties throughout the com- ing year. To clo~e the program on Friday, the traditional \moving up\ of the classes will take .place. This part of the program originated back in 1903. It all started when a gentle- man named Guy Griswold, a mem- be,· of the graduating class that year, and a campus leader, seized a Sunday School banner which had been left in the Old Chapel, and began to march around with it. His class fell in behind, and they marched to the seats of the fresh- men. The other classes moved up one notch each, and a tradition had been started. Behind it all, though, it oeems, was the desire by the seniors to have one day in the spring in which they might be free from classes. So, at the close of Chapel on that memorable day in 1903, the graduating class marched from the portals of the Old Chapel with cries of \Bolt bolt!\ Despite faculty disapproval, The Concordien•is of May 12, 1903, pointed out: \Something more than a bolt lies behind the ceremony Seniors are moving out as freshmen into the stream of life from which they will rise. cheered by the mul- titude until they reach the final 'moving-up,' which men will re- member with tears.\ So. as the Class of 1941 winds its way up the step\ of Mem o• ial Chapel to sit once a.gain, if only fm· a day, in their seats of four years ago, the College will have witne~sed another moving up of men to join the long, Ion~ line of the past, and to star·t moulding a Future for themselve:i', for Gnion, and for the world.

New Date to Affect Million Men; CAA to Have Summer Program Washington-UPl-Army and se- lective service officials· have de- cided upon July 1 as the date for registration of approximately 1,- 000,000 men who will have become 21 years old since the first selec- tive service enrollment last Octo- ber. The registration will take place at the headquarters of the 6500 lo- cal draft boards now functioning. AuthoritieE have said it would be a \fairly simple job\ compared with last fall when 16,500,000 mPn, 21 to 35, were signed up for poss.ble mil- itary training. The date for the new registration will be formally fixed in a procla- mation by President Roosevelt. Authorities indicated that the day now tentatively agreed upon was chosen to give the new group of prospective military trainees time to learn whether they are apt to be called for service this fall so they can arrange their school or employment plans accordingly.

Berg, whose retirement as chair- man of the Electrical Engineering Department had just been an- nounced, when the May issue of \Th~ American Swedish Monthly\ pubh~hed an article a-bout the Swedrsh -born engineer, whose work in_ the fiel_d_ has already gained him wrde pubhcrty. The art~cle, which includes a pic- ture of hrm at work in his labor- atory, _deals largely with his pioneer work rn electricity as an associate of the late Dr. Charles P. Stein- metz. The article speaks of his as- sociation not only with Steinmetz but also with Heaviside and hi~ personal friend, Einstein. ~erg's early life in Sweden is de- scnbed as well as his eventual ani- val in_ this country in 1892.

PROM WEEK-END-1941 One of the finest Prom week-ends in union hi-story has come to a close. Compliments are in order for all those ·who contributed to the success of the event. Chairman :'llC'Candless and his committee deserve particular credit for arranging a splendid Prom dance. The affair was suc- cessful from every standpoint. The decOl·a- tions were the most attractive that we have seen at a Union dance, the o1·chestra \vas out- standing· in personality, appearance and sheer musical ability, and the friendly spirit that is so necessary fo1· the enjoyment of a \big dance\ permeated the entire evening's enter- tainment. Thanks by the student body are also due to the \friends of the college\ \vho planned fo1· :\liss Ann Kaskas' appearance and to 1Irs. Fox for arranging the concert. The really brilliant performance of the ~-oung operatic star keynoted the week-end in as fine a fash- ion as any college ,social event could hope to be introduced. To these events must be added the frater- nity houseparties, the athletic contests, the :.\lountebanks' excellent performance-and, of course, the \softball in tails\ games at 6 a. m. Saturday. Come what may, pleasant memories of the week-end of :\lay 9, 10, and 11 will remain with a sizeable se,e:ment of l'nion College for a long, long· time. THE BAND PLAGUE Other colleges have become awake to the unfair treatment accorded committees trying to sign name bands. The latest college news- paper to protest against the high-handed methods of the booking agency is \The State College News\ from which we quote. Sairl \The Commentator\: \Everone who knows about it is sick of it and everyone who has had anything to do with it is com- pletely fed up. Every year, the several colleges in this district, as in other districts, sponsor a number of formal dances-·dancPs which require music and consequently the services of fairly decent bands. There are, of course. agents in this district who pay rather high income taxes as a result of monies col- lected as commissions for supplying these colleges with musical organizations. On the surface, the setup is a rather nice one-except for one big fallacy, namely-music committees seeking dance .bands in- variably end up with an outfit that they had not agreed to in the ·beginning and were forced to accept because of contract obligations and the pressure of time. These are not idle words-for details, the chair- men of music committees for the ma.jor formals of this year have on record sheaths of telegrams, let- ters, and exchanges. The following -instances are but brief examples to illustrate the point. ·\The junior class this year dealt with agents whom we shall call Smith and Jones. These men promised the music of \Red\ Nichols and his band for the February 21st affair. Long days of waiting, wor.ry- ing, telephoning, conversations, telegrams, and letters about the Nichols contract ·brought only excuses from our reassuring agents and promises of speedy action. Finally came an announcement that \Red\ Nichols had no band! Barred by a contract clause promising to deal with one agent, Matthews was forced to sign KaveHn, a more obscure band. The climax to the affair came with the two agents, who had pteviously tried to cut each other's throats, calling each other c10oks, each claiming commission money. They were not far wrong in the names they were calling each other and the whole affair left a nasty odor in the nose> of many. \Soiree offered a repeat performance with one of the aforementioned agents. They had profited by the experiences of the Prom committee, and made an agreement releasing the committe from the clutches of the agent if not satisfied by an agreed-upon date. They went .through the sensations of nearly hiring Dean Hudson, Dick Rogers, and Terry Shand-and finally gave up in disgust when the final signings fell through time after time. Fortunately Bill Grat- tan's fine .performance at the swing concert, was still fresh in the minds of students and old standby Bob Reid was available. The -Sophomore were pulled out of the position of having no band a dozen days ,before the dance. The Soiree committee not only pulled Soiree out of the fire but carne fhrough with the largest crowd in years and a neat profit-something like stumbling over an object and picking it up only to find It a pocketbook full of -bills.\ \There are two distinctive points to this invective tirade which should be made at this time. First, we sohuld not sit back and allow ourselves to be stepped on 'by unscrupulous agents as we have for altogether too many fol'mals. Future committees should feel bound to deal only with the agents of the individual bands or the band leader himself. They must, by all means, steer clear of all free lance agents who have continually promised but failed to produce. The col- lege student agent has time and time again proven himself no match for an agent who is acquainted with the legal ropes .by which the agent can strangle the college committees into submission and \commis- sion.\ Perhaps some enterprising college students in this district might form an agency and do themselves and the district colleges a good turn.'' \I probably would havP amotmted to something i-f I had gone to co!Legl'> and studied-but soml'ho·w I could never spare the time.''

Anna Kaskas nities. Open house to rull was the rule and the constantly changing groups in each house added new life to the party. The Kappa Sigma-Phi Gamma Delta balloons were seen all over the campus during the evening and on Sunday.

Twenty - three Dutchmen ~aw service and eight of them scored. Leading the attack was George (Boxer> Bedell, who rang the beil three times. Also participating in the blitzkrieg were Co-Captain Jack Guibert, Ronnie ·Ostrander and George Norris with two goals each, and Ed Ward, Ronnie Ma- comber, Bob Marshall and Fred Wikoff with one apiece. Marshall got credit fer a goal the R.P.I. goalie accidentally kicked into his cage. Quicl{ Victory The Garnet stege gun8 wasted no time in firing the first shot. Ostrander caged a fast toss after slightly more than two minutes of play. The first period ended 3-1 in Union favor. The Engineer\ seem- ed to have misplaced theit· slide- rules in the second session, for they were unable to score and watchf'd the Garnet parade to six goals and a 9-1 halftime advantage. The third quarter was less of a rout, but Union scored twice and took and 11-1 lead. It jumped to 13-1 before R.P.I. came through with two goals in the last 10 min- utes to alter the picture slightly. Summary: Union R.P.I. IH Bedell . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

It was the unbeaten Fa·culty's third :stt·aight win. Thursday they play Kappa Nu and get their annual steak dinner. Going into the last half of the final inning, it looked as the Phi Gams were going to spoil the peda- gogical record. They had tallieu twice in their half of the seventh to take a 6-5 lead. Then with two out in the final frame, the Faculty loaded the base8 and \Toby\ Champlin walked Maxie Wainger, forcing in \Twinkletoes\ Enzer with the tying run.

NOTT TERRAC~ and STATE ST. 1--------- SobE\r Tt>am Stars Kappa Alpha surprised everyone by putting a completely sober team on the field, collecting three home runs and beating Sigma Phi, 5-1, in a four inning struggle on Library Field Saturday morning. Avery Beer pitched and the Sigs didn't get a ball out of the infield, though they refu.!'ed to strike out. A large crowd, including two Betas, an ex-D.U., four Kappa Nus, two Neutrals and three chamber- maids saw the game. They were thrilled as Bob GilEton, Dick Brick- ley and Beer swatted four-basers, shocked as a Sig ran the bases the wrong way, and confused by the antics of \Wink\ Kempf, who um- pired. Late the next aftenoon Kempf could not recall umpiring and thus was very surprised to hear of hie near-fight with Hurler Beer over a called fourth ball. Norm Diedrich toiled on the mound for the Sigs and got very poor support. His outfielders were all playing second base most of the game and he had to resort to ctrilting out the Kaps at every pos- sible occasion. Like Houghton, he was clothed immaculately, aE were the Grey twins for the Kaps. An unknown Sig with a plumber's plunger turned in a fine all-around game, using it for -both a bat and glove. Members of all four teams ex- .pressed the hope that the Prom games will become a tradition. The ELITE TAILOR 516 Union Street Tuxedos for Rent J. CORNELL, Prop.

THE THE PLAY'S THING \Threu Men on a Horse.\ act- ed by the Mountebanl'~ before a full hous~ Saturday night, has occasioned one of the hotte:;t thea- trical controversiPs in a long time. This column on April 11 said that we thought the Mountebanks made a poor choice in picking their third comedy of the year for pro- duction because \Three Men on a Horse\ was a vulgar insignificant r-lay about unimportant people. We stuck by our hand. Mr. Harrison. the director, called our column \a bad notice from Boston.\ Ernest Staley in his review called the play \inconsistent\ and we believe that everyone who has seen the play will agree. He, and we .believe he made a mistake in including it in his review, attacked the choice of the play, too. But everyone so far seems to have overlooked the fundamental question of whether the play was entertaining or not. The audience last week thought it so. If we judge by that standard, the Mounte- banks have succeeded well. There- fore we say their belief that a light farce would be entertain- ing has been borne out. They have succeeded in putting on an amu!- ing play for \the moment\-bui not for rPflection. We think that Mr. Bertram Har- rison, the director, has done an ex- cellent job with the play. It is the director's job to plot the ac- IN THE MAIL ro the Editor: According to the college bulletin, \The Student Lounge in Hale House is an attractively furnished room used by students for leisur·e reading, informal social or group meetings, and a.:; a place where they may entertain their friends o1· relatives.\ Far be it from one who has com· muned wiVh his fellow students in that lounge during some 800 lunches and dinners to deny that statement. And, likewise, far be it from one who has spent hundreds of hours there to see no opportunity for improvement in that convivial atmosphere. I find two serious deficiencies in the lounge: first. regarding educa- tional facilities, the lack of news- papers; second, amusement, the subscription to \Esquire\ which is also missing. I unde!stand that both these items are within the power of an administration committee to bestow on the 100 students who spend a total of perhaps 50 man hours a day in tho Lounge.

Waldron Reviews Last Two Decades Urges Americans To Become Again \Plain People\ The moral outlook of the past two decades bas unfitted America to withstand a crisis, but a greater and finer tradition of Abraham Lincoln's \plain people\ sta;nd ready to buttress America's moral de- fense \if we take .the trouble to know it,\ Dr. Charles N. Waldron said Wednesday morning in the final \American Faith\ address of the year. He made an appeal to \go ahead to form a finer place to live,\ renouncing \sweet words and no action.\ Dr. Waldron pointed out the weaknesses of the country during the twenties. He viewed the· decade as \the American nation on a binge and trying to think it was not.\ Americans in the twenties he went on pretended things wer~> not what they were and turned their backs individually and eollectively on re- ality and everything embarrassing. That was the weaknesS' of the dec- ade. WhPn the crash of 1929 came, evPn the NPw Deal couldn't PscapP the heritage of the twenties \to get something for nothing\ and \want- ing to be cared for,\ Dr. Waldron continued. The decade of the thir- ties continued in a similar manner. He said that there is a far differ- ent American tradition, of the plain people, the pioneers who took a risk for the future, commending the modern counterparts of these strong, plain people, such as scien- tistS> and social workers. \What- evet· we do plain men of the past will give us strength to go ahead to form a finer place where we can live,\ he finished.

All the members of the junior class were asked to stand in the aisles with their faces toward the wall and each of the present members tapped hiB selection.

Wikoff, Jr., student council mem- ber. The second half of the moving- up ceremonies took place this morning when Griffith charged the executive com.mittee of the student council with their new duties. The new president, Robert Killian, took office along with Abraham B. Dors- man u.s vice-pt·esident and Avery J. Beer as secretary and treasurer. As is the usual ritual the seniors took their place in the chancel and the sophomores moved to the junior seats as the juni,or moved to the seat8' vacated by the outgoing sen- iors. The erstwhile freshmen mov- ed from their place in the balcony to the places left by the sopho- mores, !<laving the upstairs vacant and the college without the pres- ence of a freshman class.
