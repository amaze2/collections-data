Other institutions conferring de- grees on Dr. Hu include Duke, Bryn Mawr, Clark, Wesleyan, Sweet Briar and Yale. Writing in \I Believe,'' edited by Clifton Fadimen and ·published by Simon and ·Schuster, which cen- tains articles by the most eminent philosophers throughout the world, Dr. Hu reasserts his own .philos- ophy of \intellectual responsibility\ which he still embraces even after his eleventh-hour efforts to settle the differences between China and Japan had failed and after he had witnessed' the first thirty-one air raids on Nanking. Friend of Dr. Danton Dr. Hu states: \To think slug- gishly, to thirt·k without strict re- .gard to the antecedentro and cense- quences of thought, to accept ready-made and unanalyzed con- cepts as premises of thinking, to allow personal factors unconscious- ly to influence one's thinking, or to test one's ideas by working out their results is to be intellectually responsible. The discovery of a microscopic bacillus may benefit millions of people, but a wrong theory of political or social recon- struction may cause centuries of bloodshed.\ Dr. Hu quoted Huxley who expressed the same idea even more emphatically when he said: \The most sacred act of a man's life is to say and feel, 'I believe .such and such to be true.' All the greatest rewards and all the . heaviest penalties of existence cling upon this act.\ Dr. Hu will renew a 20 year old friendship when he comes to Union College Monday morning and onc13 again meets Dr. George H. Danton, chairman of the field of modern languages. Dr. Danton and Dr. Hu studied together at Columbia Uni- versity and were neighbors during the 12 years that Dr. Danton taught at Tsinghau University in Pelting, where they both worked to <ConUnued on Page 6)

FROM THE PLATEAU- Blodgett to Instruct Kollin Assumes Duties As Government Interne Binding- the laurel on those who are about to leave our At Summer Session midst, those whu are auout to gu out and face the Cl uel, cruel world fo1· the first time, those who, it is said by most editors, have recently spent the \four best years\ of their lives and are to leave the shelter of their favorite alma mater, is the sad, tradition compelling duty of a college edi- tor. Commencement time is a soli. of plateau from which we can 1·eview the pa:st, ouserve the present, and perhaps make predictions about the future. It is with a great deal of pride that we revie\Y the past. It would ue an easy task to bind the lau1·el on the class of 1940-easy with such members as the Thayer Trophy winner, the Daggett Prize winner, the Phi IJetes and the Sigma Xis from which to make our selec- tion. To go into detail would be to repeat what has been said time and time again throughout the last four years. As for the present, The Concordiensis welcomes the alumni who have gathered here for the annual festivities. There are some among them who remember well another time when a Union Commencement was under the shadow of war clouds. :\!any who remember the lines \;\lore than half of the Senior class have been gTaduated in absentum .... \ We are thank- ful that that line. which appeared in The Concordiensis of June 13, 1917. does not have to be 1·epeated today, however black the outlook may be. And as for the future and the class of 1940 may \Ve mel'ely say farewell and the best of success and good luck to each and every man who has shared life with us in the past few years. A college does not stand still-it either progresses or deteriorates. It is good to know that Union is going in the pl'O'per direction and fitting to praise the efforts of the graduating class which have so helped the college to stead- fastly continue in that direction. To our seniors we extend out· congratulations on the suc- cesses which they have attained and for which they are now receiving due acknowledgement. We wish to make no pre- dictions as to the future. There will be those who will achieve fame and fortune in the years to come and those who will go forward unherald'ed. Whatever may be their fate may they ever remember that they are Union men.

Harold Wittner, this week. Coach Nels Nitchman's team, which went throug-h its 1939 cam- paign undefeated, will open Hs sea- son this fall against HaYerford at horne on September 28. On the fol- lowing Saturday, October 5, the squad will travel to Geneva to face Hobar-t E Deacons- who return to· the sc-hedule atter a two year absence. October 12 will find the eleven en- gaging the Middlebury Panthers at Middlebury, while on the 19th it will take on the Univer.tiity of Ver- mont at home. The ancient rivalry with R. P.

Williams will come to Schenectady on November 2 in an attempt to even the score for the trouncing it took at the hands of the Dutchmen last fall. On Novembe1· 9 the team will go to Rochester to meet the Yellowjackets, who will be playing under Coach Dudley De Groot for the first time.

The last month spurt of Kappa Sigma puts them in second place with 1205.517, which is the thil d largest total in the five years of intramma:ls. Ketz pointed out that,. although in second place, the Kappa Sigs ha·ve won but one contest. The showing of the house was ex-plained by Ketz as being due to the fact that they had a high percen-tage of entries, gleaning many extra points thereby. Three of the twenty-one groups that enter·ed the competition had one hundred percent of their men entered in one of more contests. Ther·e were eighteen intra·mma-1 events that a single man could have entered, 'but the highest total entries score was made by Gil Kopf with twelve. Kopf, with sixty games, also participated in the most contests. Arnold Ha·rwood of Psi Upsilon ran Kopf a close sec- ond, entering an equal number of events, ·but participating in only fifty-three games. 74% Participated Five hundred and eighty-six men participated in intramural competi- tion during 1939-40, making a total of 74;\lf of the entire student body. The number of men participating is higher than ·in any other year, but .the percentage total is the same as resulted in 1938 when but five hundred and fifty-seven men took part. There were more fresh- men active in the program this yea-r than there were men from any other class, 187 yearlings playing at -some time during the year. Jack Guibert and Dudley Holmes·, both members of the junior class, were named co-captains of varsity lacrosse fm• the 1941 season at the meeting of the sport's ''Block U\ men held this week. Guibert has excelled at the post of center for the pa<t two years, while Holmes, until the injury in the Williams game, which put him out of ac- tion, was considered one of the hardest working goalies that Union has hacl Holmes, a member of the Kappa Alpha fraternity, won freshm:an numerals in baseball and in hockey He was also awarded a \Block U\ in lacrosse last year, and -an \hUt\ this season. Had .250 Average The lacrosoe team wound up its- seawn with a .250 average, gain- ing two wins as against six de- feat!\. The club dropped games to Hobart, Swarthmore, Stevens, Col- gate, Williams, and Syracuse, while pulling wins against R. P. I. and Lafay-ette.

Competition in which fewest men took part was fencing, with but nineteen men taking up foils. The ELITE TAILOR It was ali\o indicated by Coach Bill Harkness that Co-Captain Guibert has been selected to play on the Northern squad in the North - South intercollegiate la- crosse game that will be held at Baltimore on Saturday, June 15. The North-South contest commem- orates the one hundredth anniver- sary of the first organized lacrosse game in this· coun.try and will be held under the auspices of the United States Lacrosse Society.

Richard Weeks, '28, editor, assumed tl:e task of evalu- ating the service the retiring fac- ulty chail·man has rendered the college. Mr. Weeks said: \Chemistry was not exactly a subject of major importance at Union in 1904 when Dr. Ellery came to the campus. He was the entire staff of the chemist! y de- partment. He was to reign supreme in the one laboratory with its dingy lecture room adjoining it. \This June he will retire fi om a department now housed in its 0 :'-'n building with its own laboratones, t·eseai·ch rooms· and class rooms The one-man department of HJ~4 has grow.n to such a size. that tt requu es the services of .

Through- out his years as a faculty member and later as Dean of the Faculty, Dr. Ellery Eerved the c.ollege on many important commlttees·. It was natural, then, when ill health made it necessary for Dr. Frank Parker Day to take an extended leave of absence, and later to re· sign the pi esidency of the c?llege, that the trustees sho.uld asstgn to D Ellery the exactmg dulles of Tendered Dinner But the c nemical laboratories and admini::;trative offices were not the only places in which the stu- dents and members of the faculty met Dr. Ellery. In 1909 Dr. Ellery and his bride moved into the resi- dence in the south end of South College. That was the beginning of the hospitality which so many of ,the student:: and all of the fac- ulty ·have known and enjoyed for so many years, and which has re- mained even af.ter Mrs. Ellery's death in 1936. On April 10 members of the fac- ulty and their wives, w·ho had been associated with Dr. Ellery for 15 years or more tendeted Dr. Ellery a dinner at Hale Hause. Dr. John L. March, senior professor, gave the address of the evening after which Professor George D. Kel- logg pre<ented Dr. Ellery with a testimonial volume with the fol- wwing insctiption: \We your de- voted ftiends of the Union College drcle, who for many years have enjoyed your kindly hospitality and unfailing personal regard. unite in expressing our lasting af- fection and deeply regret that in the years to come we shall less frequently has you amon::st us ~o help us by your coumel. r. . g on the college worlt ..
