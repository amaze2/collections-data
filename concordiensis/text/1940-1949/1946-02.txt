Wold, late head of the department of physics at Union Colllege, last week as the mechanism he helped devise furnished the earth's first man- made contact with the moon. Dr. Karl T. Compton, president of Massachusetts Institute of Tech- nology, praised Dr. Wold's work in a letter addressed to Dr. Benjamin P. Whitaker, acting president of Union College. A specialist on the electrical properties of metals and vacuum tube phenomena, Dr. Wold was sent t<J Hawaii early in the war on a secret resea~:ch project for the Navy Bureau of Ordnance. He car- ried out liason and survey work in the development of radar until his death at his horne on the college grounds on June 17, 1945. The text of Dr. Compton's letter to Dr. Whitaker follows: \Now that the strenuous war ef- fort, for which so many speciali~ts from academic institutions were mobilized, has come to an end, I am taking the liberty of sending letters of appreciation to the heads of some of the universities and colleges which so generously made available the services of members of their staffs to participate in the cooperative development of radar in which M.I.T. had tbe privilege to serve as contr;:~.ctor. \Notable among the services ren- dered by physicists was the work of your Professor Peter I. Wold. Among the several activities in which he was engaged two were outstanding. One of these was his service as Scientific Consultant to Commander D. T. Ferrier, the very able head of the Naval Liaison group at the Radiation Laboratory. In this capacity he was a most valuable interpreter of the tech- nical features and possibilities of radar to the responsible Naval offi· cers, both in Cambridge and in Washington, and reciprocally he was of great assistance to the Radiation Laboratory personnel in maintaining effective working re- lationships with the Navy. His wide experience, good judgment and co- operative attitude command respect and promoted a constructive. atti- tude throughout the organization. RPI TlCI\:ETS Civilian students whose programs will not be prepared at the Dean's Office will be notified to report to a member of the Faculty to prepare their programs. Contrary to previous re- po:r:ts, tickets are now avail- ahle for the RPI game in Tr«Jy tomorrow night. Pro- cured through the efforts of H. Gerald Rock, presi- deilt of the Student Coun- cil., the tickets will be on sale at the gate of the R. P.I. gym, in reservation for Union men. All programs for students now in College who expect to return for the Mat•ch Term must be prepared before leave begins.

STASSEN Town Meeting to Be Broadcast by WG Y Sunday Two medical plans which may af- fect the ultimate welfare of the ma- jority of New York citizens will be discussed on the Union College Empire State Town Meeti~g brolld- cast over station WGY at 1:30 P. M. Sunday, February 3, it was an- nounced here today, Two nationally known advocates of medical care plans who will form the speakers panel will be Mr. Lewis H. Pink, president of the Associated Hospital Service of New · York, and Dr. Ernst P. Boas, chair- man of the Physicians Forum in New York. Dr. Benjamin P. Whitaker, ading president of Union College, will fill his usual role as moderator. Ente:r·ed Politics Early Stassen entered politics imme- diately after his graduation from the University of Minnesota Law School and, after practicing law for a year, was elected County Attorney, an office which he held until his election as governor of the state in 1938. Extremely popular with both management and labor, he was re- elected even after his announce- ment that he would join the Navy before his second term expired. Disregarding all opposition, he named his successor and left for the Pacific in Hl42. During his time in office his fame spread, as his popularity in the state increased, and he made his first appearance on the national scene as Chairman of the Gover- nors' Convention in 1940 and in 1941, when he found himself pow- erful enough to bring the conv~n­ tion to his own state. Becomes National Figure His national position, however, was not truly assured until after his fight for an effective United Na- tions Organization and his stand against isolationism. Finally he re- ceived the added stimulus of be- ing recalled to appear in San Fran- cisco as a representative of the United States. It is because of this semi-na- tional and great local popularity, his ability to get along with both management and labor, and his popular views on international af- fairs that he has been mentioned time and again as possible presiden- tial timber. Freedom Forum Presents \The second major contribution was made during his tour of duty in Washington, where he oJ•ganized and carried through a survey of the performance of one of the most important and secret aspects of the radar art as disclosed by its per- formance records as reported from the actual operations in the active theaters. This service was rendered at a critical time in the over-all planning of the American program for research and development in the field of radar and had consider- able bearing on the further direc- tion of this program. Throughout negotiations with Dr. Wold i~ con- nection with his initial penod of service and also the second assign- ment for which Union College granted him leave of absence, Dr. Wold was always very conscious of his responsibilities to the College and I know he was only persuaded to ask for these leaves of absence after he had been convinced that the job was important, that he was peculiarly well qualified to per- form it and that there was no one else who appeared to be availa~le and similarly .qualified. I menbon this point because of the rather unusual degree to which Dr .. Wold kept the responsibilities to h1s o;-vn institution in mind In evaluating the strength of the call to perform these special war services. ---o·--- Or.

History la (History of Wt>stem Civilization-first term) 3 Hours Section 1-T.Th.S.; Period 2; B.H. 210 Mr. Pink, for many years active in municipal and state-wide health programs, has an intimate knowl- edge of the living problems of Americans through his association, not only with the New York Blue Cross, but through his activities as president of model housing ex- periments, his activities in the na- tional public housing conference, etc. His background in health serv- ice includes directorships on the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation. a visiting nl.lrse service in New York, and trusteeship in the Na- tional Foundation for Infantile Paralysis of the Greater New York Chapter. Dr. Ernst Boas, son of the late Professor Franz Boas. noted Co- lumbia University anthropologist, is an author of .books on chronic disease and treatment of the older patient, and is a practicing phy- sician as well as chairman of the Physicians Forum which devotes itself to the study of medical care. Once again it is the Schenectady Freedom Forum that brings this worthwhile opportunity to the stu- dents of Union and to the local population. Directed by the well- known Rev, Edwin H. Wilson, the Forum, which is always ready to present any worthwhile speaker, has brought many excellent speak- ers here in the past and has al- ready laid extensive plans for the future. Such programs as a Town Meeting on Labor Problems and an address by Corliss LaMont Na- tional Chairman of the Friends of the Soviet Union, on Soviet-Ameri- can Relations have already been arranged and will be held in old chapel. \With sincere appreciation of Union College's attitude through- out, and with cordial personal re· gards.\ :Dr. Earold A. Larrabee, Profes- sor of Philosophy and chairman of th€ Division of Social Studies, will address the Liberal Arts Majors and all freshmen at Russell Sage College on February 7th at 8:15 o'clock in the Little Theater. The topic of Dr. Larrabee will be \First Steps 'Toward Philosophy.\ IJr. Larrabee is a Harvard grad- uate, A.B. and Ph.D .. and has also st-udied abroad. He has taught at Harvard, Radcliff and Columbia. Aside from his duties as a Profes- s<>n he is one of the editors of \The Humanist,\ \The Journal of ,P:hilosophy\ and \The New E~g­ la.nd· Quarterly,\ and has been vtce president of the American Philoso- phical Association, Eastern Divi- si<>n. His writings include, besides tnany articles, two books: \What P'hilosophy Is\ and \Reliable Knowledge.\ The latter is the text boolt used in Professor Larrabee's L&Jgic course. At present, \Reli- able Knowledge\ is in its second p:rinting, The book has been widel;y accepted by many colleges and um- v<3rsities in the country. M.I.T., Skidmore, Syracuse, and the Uni- versity of Penn. are among the few offering courses with \Reliable Knowledge\ as the text. 2-M.W.F.; Period 2; B.H. 201 History lb (Histm·y of Western Civilization-8econcl tt>rm) 3 Hours Section 1-M.W.F.; Period 3; B.H. 101 2-M.W.F.; Period 1; B.H. 101 History II (Second term-Navy) 2 Hours Section 1-T.Th.; Period 7 B.H. 201 2-T.Th.; Period 5; B.H. 201 3-T.Th.; Period 7; B.H. 101 4-M.W.; Period 3; B.H. 201 5-T.Th.; Period 5; B.H. 101 6-M.W.; Period 1; B.H. 201 7-T.Th.; Period 1; B.H. 201 Naval History-3 Hours T.Th.S.; Period 1; B.H. 210 History 23b (Em·opean War and Politics Since 1815) 3 Hours M.W.F.; Period 4; B.H. 210 HistoJ•y 25 (The French Revolution and Napoleon) 3 Hours M.W.F.; Period 5; B.H. 101 History 27b (Ninetet>nth Century England) 3 Hom·s M.W.F.; Period 1; B.H. 210 History 32b (Social and Intellectual Histo1·y of the U.S. from 1838) 3 HI'S, T.Th.S.; Period 4; B.H. 201 History 33b (The United States in the Twe111tieth Century) 3 Hom·s T.Th.S.; Period 2; B.H. 201 Economics lla (Elementary-fil'st term) 3 Hours Section 1-M.W.F.; Period 7; B.H. 204 2-T.Th.S.; Period 2; B.H. 111 3-M.W.F.; Period 3; B.H. 204 4-T.Th.S.; Period 3; B.H. 204 Economics llb (Elementary-second term) 3 Hours Section 1-M.W.F.; Period 2; B.H. 205 2-T.Th.S.; P~rio.d 2; B.H. 205 Economics 30 (Development of Economic Thought) 3 Hours T.Th.S.; Period 1; B.H. 202 (Continued on Page 4) Dr. Boas is a membet· of the American Medical Association, the Harvey Society, and a Fellow of the New York Academy of Medi- cine.

The action of the RPI Studei1t Council in making 1Wailable to L'nion college students a block of tickets fo1· the L'nion-RPI game being held in Troy tomoi'l'OW night deserves high commendation. A capacity crowd is expected at the contest and HPI has taken a step in cementing the relations between our two schools by offering to furnish us with tickets, thereby enabling- us to witness this annual battle in om· intense rivalry with the college in the Collar City. With RPI taking steps such as this and cooperating wholeheartedly with the L'nion Student Council's goal of getting as many men as possible to attend the game, there seems to be no reason why the Dutchmen's cheering section should not be able to make its presence well known to all. :\Iany of us are newcomers to Old Union and have no recollection of the spil'it and tradition that accompanies this moss-covered athletic series. For their sake then, let us deviate for a moment and see how, why, and where this rivalr~: developed. L'nion unofficially opened its basketball competition with HPI on Febnlal'Y 17, 1899, in a game pla~·ed on a court in Troy. This makes the series the oldest collegiate rivali·y of its sort in New York State and one of the oldest in the country. Cnion meekly bowed to the Trojans in that year, and also in another game played in the winter of 1903, when basl<etLall be- came an officiall~· recognized sport at our school. RPI continued to dominate play for seveml yem·s but Union soon took the lead and broke into the winning- column. Now we have a 40-25 edge in the 47 years of competition and with support the team may chalk up win number -11 tommTow evening. During the ;years the Union-RPI feud has flared up bitterly at times. On several occasions, in fact very often, the student bodies of the hvo institutions have paid nocturnal visits to each other's campuses. Paint cans have spewed forth their contents readily, much to the consternation of college officials who have had to have the damag-e undone. RPI was once even so rash as to try and remove the Idol from its sacred pedestal. Needless to say the attempt was foiled, not because the Union students were un hand to prevent this vandalism, but be- cause the weight of the mass of stone was more than even the conniving Engineers had calculated. In l'etaliation, some Dutchmen attempted to remove a traditional cannon from the Troy campus, and were equally unsuccessful. Pranksters have been few in numbers at both schools in recent years but isolated instances of the intense rivalry have flared from time to time. Now is the time to stamp out the harmful aspects of this strfie and foste1· the spirit and tradition which have accompanied it through the many years of its existence. Bearing this in mind, we all should joumey to Troy tomorrow with the pleasant feeling of friendliness to\vard our ancient rivals. Let the boisterous animosity, dying, give birth to a calmer, better esprit de corps. Our Student Councils have mutually taken the first step forward in promoting cordial relations between our two colleges. Let us make theil· task easy! Remember we are gentlemen, and above all Union men. HORSE AND BUGGY AGE? While we realize that conditions on the campus are overcrowded these days and the situation is far from normal, there appears to us one problem which could readily be solved by some person of authority. That problem deals with the present congested traffic conditions on the campus and the sadly apparent lack of parking space for students. Reconversion appears to have showered more than one burden upon our deat· old Alma Mater's well loaded shoulders. Up until a few weeks ago the automobile situa- tion on the campus was tolerable, if not pleasant to all concerned. Occasional viola- tors of parking regulations were warned by the college cop and matters were soon corrected. ~Iany of us have been told that parking on the lawns \vas prohibited, that vehicles could not be left standing in front of the classrooms merely because it was more convenient there, and that we naturally couldn't double park in the parking lot behind the gym. What we are wondering at this point is whether the regulations which used to apply and with \vhich we of necessity complied, have been rescinded, or whether these new- comers have higher parking priorities than we poor students have. Are the parking lots now open to be used as each individual driver sees fit? l\Iay we double park where we please? ·Can we leave our cars stand:ing in the roads on the campus and can we cluster them around Bailey Hall like so many flies around a piece of sugar? A1·e the la\vns in front of the Psychology and General Engineering Buildings now available for parking as well as the many other lawns around here? Do we now have the right to breeze along the college lanes and toot our horns as a signal to unsuspect- ing students that we want the roads cleared fo1· our use? Just what rights and privileges do we students as automobile owners have, granted that we may be only a small percent- age of the student body, but to many of us they provide our sole source of transportation.

Just inside Payne Gate, on the right, stands the second college Greek Letter Society founded in America. Just inside Payne Gate, fronting a shaded lawn, stands Union's second contribution to the fraternity system. Sigma Phi So- ciety, one of the most stalwart and conservative fraternities in the country, was founded here on March 4, 1827. Wc.rli B!'gan Y!'ar BefOI'!' Work had been progressing in this direction since the year before, and by March the founders had al- ready laid the foundations for a sound fraternity and had chosen new initiates. It was because the conception of the fraternity was made public and six more men were talten into the organization on the fourth, however, that that date is accepted as the time of the brotherhood's official founding. As incongruous as it may seem the Sig pin did not come into being until over a year after the first initiation, and it is a matter of record that in the beginning the original members were even op- posed to any public symbol. None- theless, the infusion of new broth- ers and the passing of time seems to have changed the ideas of the first Sigs, and the badge in its present form of a pearl studded Sigma upon a golden Phi was finally adopted. Credit for the pin's design can be given to no one in- dividual, but was a cooperative effort on the part of the entire fraternit:y,. Soon Consolidated Position Once founded the Society consoli- dated its rather unstable position on campus, and in 1831 opened the Beta Chapter at Hamilton. Far overshadowing the fact that this accomplishment was an outward proof of the fraternity's strength, is the new precedent that the Sigs had set for the other secret socie- ties then existing in American col- leges. Never before had a colle- giate brotherhood attempted to ex- pand to other campuses. Sigma Phi was the pioneer in the idea of in- terco.Hegiate chapters. Sig Phi Grew Slowly The fraternity grew slowly but steadily after the Hamilton suc- cess; but so conservativtl was its policy that only six more chapters had been established by the Civil War, while petitions from such colleges as Yale, Amherst, Dart- mouth, and Bowdoin were refused. One of the chief reasons for this was the predominance given the plan of closly knitting the fratern- ity in New York and New England around the original charter at Union. A trend in change of policy I was noted just before the outbreak of the Civil War however, when a chapter was founded at Ann Arbor, and finally after the· Reconstruc- tion period the more libral ele- ments in the fraternity won out resulting in the founding of chap- ters at Lehigh, Cornell, Wisconsin and the University of California. Meets Two Crises During this period of expansion the Union Chapter steadily grew meeting only two great crisis of any importance. The first of these came I in 1873 when Nicholas Van Vran\ ken Franchot. the only Sig in col- lege, held weekly meetings which he alone attended; and the sec- ond in 1885 when a transfusion of brothers from Vermont kept the Society alive. Since that time, how-l ever, the Alpha Chapter has re- mained on the solid ground upon which it was founded.

We want to take this opportunity to bid adieu to you students, although few in number, who will end yom· undergraduate careers at Union with the close of this sernester. l\lost of you have come to Union and matured here during the war years. Some knew our college a few years ago before war had left its m:u !<. and have come back to finish whe1·e you left off several years ago. In any event, L'nion has left its mark upon all of .vou and we hope that impression may be cal'l'ied with you always. No doubt in days to come you may reflect upon the past glories you reveled in while ~·ou were here with us. These happy care- free collegiate days will be mellowed by the vears and seem all the more pleasant. Other things ma~· fade but we hope that the place the college along the :\lohawk \'ale has taken in your lives will l'emain forever in your hearts. A number of little things have been moulded together during these years and to you, and to us, they spell UNION. The traditional paint fights around the Idol. Sporadically they have flared, and although the paint may have been splashed libemlly on ourselves as well as on the mass of stone, which reposes so peacefully on the plot of grass behind the gym, everyone enjo~·ed himself. The cheering sections at athletic contests have rung with your shouts of encourage- ment. You stuck by your teams through bad years and g·ood. Intercollegiate feud;,;, such as the moss-covered Union-RPI l'ivah·~·. have had their effect upon ~·ou. And then there were the college dances; although not frequent enough to satiate all your social desires they still provided a welcome break from the normal humdrum of collegiate life. Occasionally you sojourned to the far Northland and risited our famed sister in- stitution of lenming-. Those moments were indeed happy and enjoyable. In fact, a few of you found the company there so pleasant that you have indicated a willingness to make a lifelong bond 1rith it. Skidmore, Smith, Sage, \'assar ... soon they will dim in ~·our memo1·ies and then be revived at some future reunion when they will likely be the topic of much discussion. Tony's too, may pass the \ray of all flesh, lmt those welcome b1eaks from long study hours will be well remembered. And don't forv:et .:\Ieaney's, the VC, Beanie's, and all those other spots wherein ~·ou passed man~ idle hours. Along with the sweet always comes the bitte1·, classes of course. Remember strug- gling along the wind-swept upperclassman's walk on the way to an 8:30 class in Bailey Hall or the Chem Building'? And you .n- gineers, wasn't there many a day when you wished that ~·ou cculd trade your sJirt,~ rules and heavy text books for the much lir.:ht,~l· volumes of an SS man ? It has been a long tough grind, but FU made it. The question may have beP.E in doubt many times, especially on those :>~rlt1- ingly endless nights before exams wheu the midnight oil bumed abundantly. Pag--~ by page you covered the material until finalb the whole thing was just a jumbled mass. .:\Iany times you were almost ready to giw it up, but your perseverance now places you on the threshold of yom final reward. Just a scrap of paper, but symbolic of several ~·em·s of combined pleasures and hardships. We have rambled along, hitting the hig;1 points of college life, of your college life. These things, and l'nion, are ones that we hope you never let die in your memories. Take them all and the spirit of Union with you. Take them with our hearty congratula- tions and best wishes for all time to come. IS UNION BEHIND? The Concordiensis has a suggestion fo1· study and consideration. We believe the subject to be one of major importance to any clear thinking, progressive educational institution. Visual education is not an innovation in the field of liberal education ... nor is radio education. Both have been used in high schools, colleg·es and industry for many years as H supplement to the various other t~·pes of teaching. Leading educators have favor- ably expounded upon the effectiveness and efficiency of these methods, and psychol- ogists have attested to the same . Today Union College has in its possession a General Electric Wire Recorder, presented many months ago as a gift from the com- pany. The machine is capable of recording radio broadcasts, individual speeches, or an~·thing the operator desires. The machine is simply operated, a.nd the wire may be played back in part or as a whole. Anything recorded on the wire can be saved or \erased\ as the operator desires. Other disc record- ings are available from many different sources on man~· cliff erent topics ranging from Shakespeare's plays to t€chnical lec- tures. Are Union's teaching methods so stereoptyped that we cannot or will not take advantage of these valuable sources? ;\lust valuable speeches and events be read about when they could be heard or seen? Are actual words and scenes more impressive than black type or white paper? We believe that these questions should be considered and answered to the best advan- tage of the student. What is the purpose of education if it is not to teach the student in the most practical and feasible manner? Why is Union behind? R. H. R PATRONIZE OUR ADVERTISERS An earnest plea is made to the readers of the Concordiensis to patronize our adver- tisers as much as possible. By doing so each one of us will be contributing to the con- tinued appearance and success of your campus newspaper. if, when in the establishment of one of our advertisers, you said something like this: \Oh yes, I saw ~·our ad in our college news- paper.\ Not much more than that need be said-unless the clerk is really good looking and you're looking· fo1· a good date. 1Iany of us have certain weekly purchases that have to be made and the aggregate sum Union HMother of Fraternities 'J Delta Phi Fraternity was found- ed at Union College on November 17, 1827 by nine members of the junior class, marking the close of a page in the history of American society. Within a period of scarcely more than two years, three secret organizations had been successfully to1·med on campus and were grow- ing steadily. What was latet· t0 be' known as the Union Triad was here to stay and t-he path had been blazed for the future. Ending the l'eriod The last of the Triad was found- ed only six months after her sister organization, Sigma Phi, but unlike the latter it was established in a manner that seems to f0retell of the approaching storm that Ameri- can fraternities were soon to meet. In the beginning the idea for the society had taken rcot quite con- ventionally enough in the rooms of the founders then residing in North College, but, instead of hold- ing their first official meeting on campus, it was held on the Schen- ectady shore of the Mohawk under the first span of the 0ld Scotia Bridge. The stated purpose of the found- ers of Delta Phi was \to consoli- date their interesis and at the same time to mutually benefit each other,\ but originally it was also fo1·med with the idea of having a literary and de bating society as well. This literary character was maintained for a long time after founding, eventually, however, to the fraternal side of the society, which has remained dominant ever since. W!'ath!'rs the Storm It was not long after her found- ing that the threatened storm broke. Anti-fraternity feeling swept the country and the Triad shud- dered under the blast. Secret or- ganizations smacked of subversive activity, and as a result the Union College faculty announced the banning cf fraternities. The other two societies on campus ceased wearing their badges, but John Jay Hyde of Delta Phi appeared before the faculty and trustees, and as spokesman for the fraternities was able through his eloquence to sway Dr. Nott there·by saving the college fratermty from obliteration. Conservative Expansion Having bucked opinion and sur- vived, the fraternity entered into a period of slow conservative ex- pansion. Chapters were founded at Brown, N. Y. U., Columbia, Rut- gers, and Pennsylvania during the next quarter of a century, and two more chapters were added before the Civil War. Chapters at Har- vard, Princeton, and Michigan were founded, but were abolished by anti-fraternity feeling; Harvard and Michigan being eventually re- vived. Finally Southern chapters were .added, but the majority of them were lost during the 1860's. Following the war, expansion con- tinued slowly until today twenty- one chapters exist with fifteen of them active. The last of these was founded at Kenyon College in 1940. On!' Man Rule If any one indivic1ual could be considered responsible for the growth of Delta Phi it is James Duane Livingston. who devoted his entire life to the development of the fraternity. From his initiation in 1876 until his death in 1936 Delta Phi was his dominant in- terest. He served in various ca- pacities throughout his life time, but his purpose was always the same, the growth of Delta Phi. No more fitting memorial could be raised to this man than the one that was constructed with his own hands. Alpha Chapter The original chapter here at Union has been in continuous ex- istence since its conception in 1827. It met for a time in rooms on and around campus, and was one of the first fraternities to provide living quarters for its members. renting a place on Nott Street. In 1913 it migrated to its present lo- cation overlooking Council Field where it built its first house. The house has been remodeled and en- larged since that time. In many instances our advertisers are Union graduates and any boost we give them is greatly reciprocated back to the college in the form of good relationship between local business men and Union. Now it may be difficult to make known that you are from Union whenever you buy your pur- chases. However, it would mean a great deal Delta Phi Today spent is quite a sizeable figure. We ma'ke Delta Phi at the present time here no attempt to dictate to anyone where finds itself in a simialr position t d h\ b · with scot·es of other college fra- 0 spen IS money- ut If you have some- ternities, emerging from the ruin thing to buy and a Concordy advertiser sells of war.

Slow Start The game opened at a slow pace and Union broke the ice with a foul shot by Dingley. Five minutes had gone by when Union dropped from its lead to a 5-5 tie. The first stanza was almost half over before RPI could edge its way ahead, but from then on it steadily eked out a larger margin. The half ended with the Garnet trailing 13-20. RPI gradually widened its mar- gin after the intermission and used its speed to further tire the al- ready fatigued Dutchman. Coach Whitey Boehm employed several substitutes in an effort to bolster the heighth which his team lacked almost three inches to a man against RPI, but his efforts were of little avail The RPI reserves did . almost as .weil as the first team and kept on an even basis with the Garinet to win 50-33. -----------~--·-- Season Record 1945-1946 Union 54 31 61 62 34 58 28 39 45 61 35 66 32 31 33 62 Oppont'nt Brooklyn Poly 30 J(ings Point Middlebury Williams Columbia Rochester Syracus!\ Stevens RPI MiddlebUI'y Wesleyan Hamil tun Stevt-ns Syracuse RPI Hamilton 42 28 31 51 45 69 46 44 38 34 30 45 69 50 57 is made up of naval trainees and· they will all be out of Union before the next cage season rolls around.

Among the Navy boys saying adieu to Union college basketball tonight will be: Bill Fisher, Garry Stauffer, Burt Biss, Tom Redden, Howie Young. Bob Dunn and Casey Colman. The civilian players who may terminate their careers tonight are Al Dingley, Whitey Marks, Dave Lennek, and John Hanson. Dick Thompson and Rog McCormick have already been transferred to active duty by the Navy, and the one remaining member of the squad, Bob Webster, being a vet- eran is the only member certain to be baclc at Union next year.

The dance, ta be c8!11ed \Freshman Frolic\ will be the culmination of the series of events designed to complete the orientation of the incoming men. -:!>-- -- . ·- - ----------- ----- A new series of lectures crit- icizing our State Department will be Initiated tonight and will be carried over into the March term. Mr. Kilb and Mr. Leighton will sponsor the lec- tures before the group, Dr. elect Carter Davidson, p1·esident R bb • TTT-\ G of Union College, will malte a l ~, lSe uest his second appearance on campus Sunday when he will p1·each at the worship· service in Memorial Chapel at 11:00 a. m. The an- nonuced tHle of his sermon this 1 Sunday is \'Salt and D)'namite,\ i which will be broadcast over sta- ·I tion WGY. Today is a notable day for _it marks the start of a new phase m this term's routine. From now un- til our leave starts we wHI spen.d our week-ends in Schenectady. No longer will our work be distracted by joyful jaunts to Skidmore and Vassar; no longer will we return . penniless and pleased from the· world's greatest metropolis. Indee.d. it is a great experiment and 1f Schenectady can take it we may took the thermometer out of my mouth first?\ Freddie Gray and his orchestra, who delighted so many after the Union-RPI game here, will play from 9 until 12 on the evening of March 16th. The Student Council in the interests of all Union men who have not as yet become ac- quainted with the beauties of the Mohawk Vale, has established a Date Bureau. Those interested should contact their nea:rest Stu- dent Council representative im- mediately, because n0w is the time to be thinking of a date for the spring prom. There will be no ad- mission charge to the \Freshman Frolic.\ As previously announced in the Decem.ber Hth issue of the Con• cordiensis, Dr. Carter Davidson was chosen the thirteenth president of Union College and the seventh Chancellor of Union Cnivet:sity. ~e 1 will officially take- over h1s dut~es I as p1·esident of the college With the commencing of the !'.'larch term. Ordained to the ministry of the Congregational-Christian Church in 1935 a year befor~ he became pres- iden~ oi Knox College. Dt': David- 1 son is the eleYenth president of 1 Umon College with a ministerial! bacltground. His activities in th~ i Congregat'ional Church have been ' numerous. HE' is a former prl'sident of the .Jllinois Conferl'nce of Con- gt·egational·Cht·istian Churches, a member of the executive commit- tee of the :-latiunal Congreagtional Board of Home :\!issions. a member of the committee for the war vic- tims and services of the General Council of the Congregational- Christian Churches, and a director of the Chicago Theological Semi- nary. This being- Dr. Davidson's MC- ond appearance before the student bod\' it will be to the interl'st of us ~·II. hoth individaully and col- l~ctively, in endeavoring to know our new president. His policies wi 11 have a direct E'ffrct on each of us: thus it is strongly ur?,\ed that the student body talte advantage of hearing and seeing Dr. David- son Sunday. Typt> of Man BR. CARTER DAVIDSON --~~- -------- Wounded Returns Late Vet To Union Casualty Receives Officer Travel-pay and Allowance A 365 pound veteran returned to Union College today and was ad- mitted for special study in the college library. Wounded in action but without a purple heart, the dischargee, a 36-volume set of the \Encyclopedia Italiana,\ came from Washington on a travel allowance of $9.96 from the Army Security Agency, \the hush-hush of Arlington Hall,\ by which the nine-foot giant had been drafted for secret work in 1943. During- Dr. Davidson's stay at Knox ·College he was exceptionallly diligent. The amount of work he can do in a day is comparable to the amount done by the avern?,\e person in a week. Union College is honored b~· having a young. l'igorous. and energetic man. full of new ideas on education and en- thusiastic about all enterprises. April of 1942, the \Journal of Higher Education\ published an ar· ticle by Dr. Davidson entitled \The Coll~;re of Modern Democracy.\ In th£> a-rticle he stresses the oppor- tunities afforded in learning dem· ocr-acy through the daily activities of a college. With the change of social events in this world there is a correspondin~ movement in ed- ucational nract ice. According to Dr. Davidson there are three easily recognizable principles governing the educational movement. \first that the student rather than the body of learning has become the center of all our thoughts and endeavors: second. that our curric- ular and classroom methods must be governed by the techniques of the psychology of learnin?,\; and third. that the ultimate objectives of education must include service to sociPtY os well as the individ- ual.'' In ·concludin?,\ the article Dr. Davidson sa;ys. \It is easy for us to preach democracy in our pulpits and e1·en from our classroom desks, but if we are to preserve it in our livE's. we must learn to live it in our daily acti1·ities. Our campuses must be organized as democracies, not tyrannies or oligarchies or even ar·istocracies. Our students must become our friends, co- wor-kers in the building of a better society. The essential prin- ciple of democracy, as It is of Christianity also, is the sacredness of the individual. Closely allied to this is the appeal to reason rather than force. and the pursuit of hap· piness in the full life.\ An ideal worthy of thought in building our society. Librarian Helmer Webb said that the draftee \is the greatest en- cyclopedia in the world in spite of the fact that it was put out under Mussolini.\ As one of the few com- prelu>nsive reference works on Europe available in the United States during the war. it served an important part in developing high strategy. Detailed information in its 36,000 pages may have been used, he said, in plotting landing points, battle campaigns and other offen- sives in which precise knowledge of Europe was needed. .-----------------------1 I ~ I I '\'\:[u.m sun.g ..n.~s tau.ratt I I I Chinese and American Food l I I I • I i I SPECIAL LUNCHEONS II : 1 and DINNERS • I I: I • I· I OrdPrs Prepared to Take Out ~ : . :' I 135-Broadway 1 , Purchased from the Benjamin Fund in 1937, the set was drafted at the same time that the govern- ment was appealing for snapshots, tourist guides and other geograp- hical information about Europe, The Union College library's com- pl~te set of \Baedecker's\ was also drafted by the government but has not enough \points for release.\ ThE' \Encyclopedia Ita!iana\ will b .. \at home\ to friPnds in the dis- play cases of the library for the next week.

In observance of National Broth- erhood Week, February 16-24, speakers repx·esen ting the two prin- ciple divisions of religious thought in this country, Judaism and Chlis- tianity, were PI'esented in assemb'y last Wednesday. Rabbi I. Aa1on Wise of the Nott Terrace Syna- gogue spol{e as a represent tive of the Jewish faith in Arrericn. ·while Chaplain C, Victor Brown of tl:is college presented the views of Chris tlan ity. In his talk, Rabbi Wise fiist ex- plained the idea behind National BrotheJhood. Week. Each year, in the month of February, Chr isti1ns and Jews come together to express fellowship. He described this week of fellowship as an \exhibition of good will.\ The advent of the atomic bomb, in his opinion, has neces.sitated a year-round expres- sion of fellowship. The devastation wrought by atomic energy fearfully foreshadows the dire consequence of future intolerance. His ideal purpose for National Brotherhood Week is for- it to challenge our thinking. to get us to ask probing questions, not merely to say pleasantries about Judaism and Christianity. His aim for the ob- servance is to have it spread over the entire world throughout the year. In conclusion, Rabbi Wise opined that with brotherhood we live, without it we are doomed. Chapla.in Brown. in his speech, agreed that the achievement of brotherhood is a \must\. He, too, stated that the atomic bomb has hastened the need for this universal tolerance. The Chaplain said that, if the rights and privileges of men are exalted above all other things in the United States, it can do a great deal for world unity. At the close of the speeches, Sey- mour T. Pearlman and Howard T. Clayton of the student body ques- tioned the two speakers. In reply to the one question which time allowed. the speakel's agreed that Jews aJ\e per-secuted for religious. social. economic and political rea- sons.

The talk of the campus seems to be the movie, \The Lost Week- end.\ One trainee comments. \That cures me.\ Another bell-bottomed intellectual says, \Obviously insi- dious propaganda instigated by the Coca-Cola Company and the W. C. T. U.\ Harr0ld W. Blodgett, head of the English department, says that he liked the book and that Charles Jackson the author, was not an alcoholic: Supposedly Cyril F Kilb, Union history instructor, is only worried about the effect on his brother-in-law's business, but that is neither here nor there. Everyone agrees that it is a movie that we should aH see. Last week over an obscure UCRS news program there was amazingly enough some worthwhile news. Because the facts are true and because the before mentioned program has a meager audience, I will quote part of the broadcast. This story concerns a member of this unit who went over to sick- bay for treatment on a recent Sunday. \Upon entering he was confront- ed by a bedridden patient running a teamperature and feebly attempt- ing to help the watch with his un- accustomed duties. Having bravely overcome that pitiful sight he mus- tered up enough courage to ask the trainee in charge for something to relieve his cough. The watch didn't know what to do so our coughing victim asked to have his temperature taken. Finally a ther- mometer was dug up by our ama- trur doctor who tried to stick it into our patient's mouth without cleansing it. After having the ther- mometer in about three minutes our friend noticed the watch- slander going through contortions in the vicinity of his face. \What are you trying to do?\ gurgled our shipmate. \Read the thermometer,\ was the brilliant comeback. To this our friend replied, \Don't you think it would be wise if you JAMES F. BURNS 206 EVERYTHING ELECTRICAL CLINTON STREET FOUR BARBERS.
