The fi·rst schedule change was made necessary by the revision in the college calendar. Albert Sp~JJd­ ing, famous violinist, was to have presented his concert on March 20. However, since this date now falls within the spring vacation, Mr. Spalding has consented to present his concert on Friday, March 27. The second change was neces- sitated by a revision in the sched- ule of Paul Robeson, negro bari- tone, who was to sing on January 16. Under the new sched.ule, Miss Helen Jeps-on, coloratura soprano, will sing on that date, while Mr. Robeson will present the February 6 concert. Mr. Robeson's concert will include an appearance of the college glee club. Thus the concert schedule now is as follows: January 16, Helen Jepson; February 6, Paul Robeson with the glee club; and March 27, Albert Spalding. President Fox, commenting on the concert schedule changes yes- terday, issued the following state- ment: \The far-reaching fingers of World War have reshuffled the events of the Union College Con- cert Series, though happily with- out damage to any of them. \When Jussi Bjoerling, the lead- ing ten.or of the Metropolitan Op- era Company, decided that war conditions made it impossible for him to r·eturn to America for his 1941-1942 season, about $70,0:10 war th of concerts already booked thr.oughout this country became a problem to his managers. For his dates it was necessary to seek the cooperation of a comparable artist. In consequence Paul Robeson will be dnging far up in Canada the evening before his scheduled ap- pearance at Union College on Jan- < Continued on Page 6, Col. 2) o--- Naval Reserve Takes Conly Under V-7 Plan Richard Conly '43, is the first stu- dent to be accepted in the Naval Reeerve under the V-7 program. Seven others have passed their physical examinations and are awaiting their interviews prior to being sworn in at the Albany office. These seven applicants include three seniors-David Clowe, Fred- erick Schmelzer and William Birdsall-and four juniors-Parke Branson, Norman Fox, John Mann and Robert Groundwater. This plan enables college juniors to enlist in the Navy and gradu- ate from college before being call- ed to duty. In the summer of their junior year these men take a month cruise after which they are taken into the midshipmen class. Following graduati.oh they take a three months course aboard the Prairie State, after which they be- come ensigns in the Navy. A sal- ary of $175 per month is paid to those who work on surface craft, while those serving on submarines receive $250 per month. To qualify for V\7 one must be a college junior. There is also a requirement of a one year course in college mathmatics bes-ides the physical examination. It was disclosed yesterday that a course in mathematics for the students in V-7 wili be announced shortly by the Dean. ----0---- No Concordy Friday Because of the concentration of mid-year hour ·examinations, there will be no Friday issue of The Con- cordien.sis this week.

They made no report on Union College, over which they crossed in aero- planes shortly before the blackout ended. FDR Order 'To Insure Victory' Excepts Men Previously Registered Washington, Jan. 5 - Preside!lt Roosevelt yesterday set February 16 as the date for registration of men between the ages of 2(} and 44. inclusive, who have not registered previously, the United Press re- p.orted. Although recent changes in the select!ve service act permit regis- tration of men from 18 through 64, the President called for the regis- tration now on only those eligible for milit:uy service-men in the age bmckets of 20 through 44. Men who had registered under the pre- vious 21-35 law need not register again. Mr. Roosevelt by proclamation ordered the regi~tation in the United States and the territories of Alaska, Eawaii ar.d Puerto Rico, Monday, February 16, between the hours of 7 am. and 9 p.m. The proclamation ordered all unregistered men who were born on or after February 17, 1897, and on or before December 31, 1921, to present themselves for registra- tion. 'To Insure Victory' The new registration will be required, the President said, \to insure victory, final and complete, over· the enemies of the United States.\ He urged private employers and government agencies to give those in their charge sufficient time in which to fulfill the obligations of registration. Exempted from the proclama- tion, in accordance with the selec- tive service act, were officers and enlisted men of the armed forces. cadets of the military and naval academies, members of the fed- erally recognized active National Guard, the various Reserve Corps and diplomatic representatives. The registration will be conduct- ed by duly designated registration officials or local selective service boards-. Persons subject to registration but prevented from registering on February 16 by circumstances be- yond their control may present themselves as soon as possible thereafter. The President called on gover- nors of the states and territories and local draft boards- to carry out the provisions of his order. The first registration for those between 21 and 35 years of age took place on October 16, 1940, more than a year before our first actual participation in the present conflict. The second registration was held July 1, 1941. -----0--- Former Professor Dies in Florida Dr. Frederick Robertson Jones, 59, former professor of history and sociology here, died one week ago Saturday at Winter Park, Florida. A native of Maryland, Dr. Jones carne to Union after studying at Western Maryland College and at Johns Hopkins University. He was assistant to the late Professor Ed- ward Everett Hale from 1899 to 1900. He left U11ion to enter the insur- ance business in 1905. Of the two campus lights which remained on for almost .six min· utes, one in South College could :be called almost dangerous. Charles Keeler '43, apparently leit his room shortly ·before the blackout without turning off his lights. They illum- inated the rear court and were fin- ally extinguished following repeat- ed calls by residents of Oldgym HalL The other was located in the attic of the Administration Build- ing. The light was noticed by The Concordiensis which reported it to air-warden headquarters. Mr. Johnson was sent to extinguish it. Before he could turn it off, Mrs. Fox called her husband who was sitting' in his blacked out office. He turned it out. Light shone from the top of the boiler house and through cracks in the door. Anthony Hoadley 'Z3, in charge of the ·blackout, said that he doubted that it projected very much light a:bove. If it did he said the observers would report' it to th~ college. He pointed out that the ·bright moon, reflected from the skylights of some of the college buildings, offered a far better target than any light showing. Anticipation Averts Surprise The blackout actually came as no surprise to many in the college. Word got around that it was scheduled for 9 p. m. and many also guessed the time. In addition, a fire siren sounding at about 8:50 p. m. caused Oldgym Hall to black- out completely and served as an alert to others on the campus. Lights in fraternities were turned off. During the blackout members listened to the broadcast over WGY, stood and watched the blackout or engaged in a \bull ses- sion,\ In the library students went down to the cellar where the lights were not turned off. They contin- ued to study there until the \all clear\ sounded. The Concordiensis blacked out and did not continue office work. Reporters were spread over· the campus to watch the blaclwut. Flashes of light occasionally showed in the Delta Upsilon house. They came from an unguarded flashlight. Members of Pl:i Upsilon watched the blackout from the rooftop. Kappa Sigma said that the traf- fic l~ghts continued to flash, de- stroymg an otherwise perfect ·blackout. All fraternities noted the lights atop the gas tank. Only two small accidents were reported. Seymour Pearlman '44 fell over a chair in the Kappa N~ Annex during the ·blackout. Wru·- ren Hoffman '44, broke his glasses during a free-for-all in the Phi Sigma Kappa house, also during the blackout. Professor Edward S. C. Smith marched up and down before North College checking on all Hghts, in his capacity of air-raid warden. North College residents reported that the lights in the parking field were extinguished at once. The Delta Chi house, which is located across the street from the fi.re station at Nott and Hattie streets said that the:,.· had no trou- ble hearing the alar·m as an engine was brought out and placed almost in front of the house to help sound the blackout. Most other houses and students complained of diffi· culty in hearing the alarm. The Chi Psis reported that they CContinued on Page 4, Col. 6)

ADAPTATION TO WAR There is little doubt in anyone's mind that we shall soon be forced to accept sweeping changes in both public and academic attitude toward the colleges of the land. It is a mat- ter of record that certain calendar and curri- cull:l.r changes have already been made in American colleges to the end of altering, in some CQlleges, both the nature of t1·aining in the humanities and the development of the chronology of the academic yeaa·. It is important, ho\vever, to recognize that these changes have not and will not become undisciplined trends; limits are already be- ing set for the extent to which the changes may go: The meeting of the American Association of Colleges at Baltimore was bluntly told last week that the War and Navy Departments do not favor any extension of military train- ing to the colleges, The Association ratified this proposition by going- on record as de- ploring an~- curricular changes in the teach- ing of the humanities which would destroy the essential ends to which training in such fields is aimed. No Army Camps Thus we may be reasonably certain that American colleges, whether they be tech- nical or liberal arts in nature, will remain colleges during this emergency period. We have appGrently l£amed well the lesson that World War I taught of the futility of at- tempting to turn colleges into army camps. Because the patients are rendered immune from one virus does not mean that they \Vill be inunune from another. Colleges may well be little changed in their fonn, but that does not indicate that they will have the financial competence with which to live in that form. It is a simple rule of economics that sup- ply and demand must alwa.ys have a near equality; this is no less true of the supply of and derna.nd for coilege educations. Any number of facto1~s are at work today in re- stricting the supply of men and women who are able to pursue further education. That this is true can only mean that rocky days are ahead of Americatl colleges. The financial p1·oblem of continuing the existence -of American colleges is far less simple than the political problem of retaining their curricular natures. It has been claimed by many academic sources that the financial problem before American colleges just has no solution-there is nothing that the col- leges themselves are able to do outside of at- tempt to weather the storm of the future years. Academic authorities are now claiming i.hat this present period will se~ the depar- ture of many of America's marginal colleges -those many institutions with small endow- ment or none at all which operate from year to year on the \hotel plan.\ It is pointed out also that certain technical schools of low financial rating will enjoy a mushroom-like grmvth dm·ing :the present period, but will be no better off than the marginal schools when the war effort has ended. We are fortunate, in the case of Union, in having a college whose roots are deep in the soil and one that rates well among all Amer- ican colleges in quantity of endowment. As with the other \better colleges\ we are yet to be faced with some difficult years, and we must expect them. WE BLACKOUT The college. did a good job during the blackout. Lights went out with dispatch, wardens were on the job, and a general spirit of healthy cooperation prevailed throughout. As might be expected, there were the one or two characters without whose exhibitions any \first expe1·iment\ would be incomplete. There was the man who amused himself on the top floo-r of South College by thro·wing lighted matches fram his window, and the man who kept a veiled light, but a light nevertheless, in an Oldgym Hall window. All in all, however, there can be nothing but praise for the college community in its newest venture. We shall be prepared in the future for other facsimiles of the grim real- ities that are abroad in the world. BUSINESS AS USUAL It is in the order of things that student supported activities report back, at necessary periods, to the stude11ts who support them. It is rather because of this necessity, than becal:lse of a desire to memorialize any change that The Concordiensis makes clear its \future plans\ and status. It is, as a matter of fact, only necessary for us to reiterate that which has appeared in these columns for many years on the job and purpose of this newspaper: The Con- cordiensis must furnish the campus with ac- curate, thorough, living coverage of the news that is being made, and it must help to build and sustain campus morale. The Concordiensis is not and should not be a war journal nor a record of national af- fairs; that function is being ably performed in other qumters. The concem of this news- paper has been the Union College campus, and such it will remain. The Concordiensis will continue to publish as a four page, six column, semi-\veekly newspaper which is distributed to the col- lege community and to Union men in the service. We may have to change some of our theories in respect to the place and even- tually the physical form of extra-cunicular activities in the \war college\. We must, however, recognize that continuing certain of these activities is fully as necessary now as it ever was, and possibly it is more neces- sary. Business as usual is and will be the order of the day. THE CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR If there is one characteristic that distin- guishes the man who has benefited from his education from the man who hasn't, that characteristic is the possession of tolerance. The tolerance must be shown at all times, and not only when the abundance of peace and plenty makes it a virtue easy to observe. Consider, for example, the case of the con- ~cientiou\ objector. These men and women have their burdens to bear in periods of war emergency, and are particularly bothered by the less well edu- cated segment of the population. Certainly our particular segment, with its opportunity to obtain the education available to but few, should not also fall into the trap of bothering nncl per:-1ecuting them. letters Praise SC'reen' 'Smoke Two \S1noke officials terday. letters, both pra;ising Screen,\ were •received by of that organization yes- One from Howard C.

In the first place, thP weather- man hasn't been cooperating with Lawrence at all. Snow before Christmas vacation prevented him from giving his team any practice before the Placid tournament. Then snow came again Saturday night practically to ruin the team's chances of getting onto ice this week. Then there's the problem of man power.

If the ice can be cleared at Col- lins Lake in Scotia or at Central Park, the team may practice today or tomorrow. Examinations will prove troublesome. The team needs practice badly, as some of the can- didates have yet to work out. Coach Lawrencp has 10 men he can take on the trip this week end. He said last night that he will probably start Bruno Schulze in the goal with Brett Smithers, Fred Wikoff and Bobby Panoff on the attack and Jim Pinkston and Bob !Fatty) Nothackei·, a new recruit, as defensemen.

If a.t times it seem as though a clique has banded to- gether to restrict student partici- pation in the organization, it often- times means that after a serious fruitless attempt was made to se- cure help from the general student body, the old stand-bys had to as- sume leader::;hip in t!1e v:J.cant po- sitions.

The result was a plan for a general meeting to bP held on January 14, at 7:30 in their thea- tJ·e. Anyone who i~ interested in any phase of play produetion is urged to nttend this reorganiza- tional meeting. It is hoped that there will be enough persons pres- ent so that a complete· working staff can be organized for the next Mountebanks show. Tho:>e inter- ested students who are not able to devote to.o much time to this pro- duction will be offered smaller po- sition::; in pr·ograms with which the Mountebanks hope to expand their work. These programs will be in the form of one-act plays and ra- dio presentations. Students will not be left waiting around before they discover whether or not they will be needed for the next pro- duction. Jobs will be assigned at the meeting after the available tasks have been thoroughly dis- cussed. Previous experience in theatrical production, while desir- able, is nat a requirement. We will give the experience if you furnish the interest. \It has been estimated that al- most one-half of the student body has never even seen the inside of the theatre. The Mountebanks ex- tend their invitation to include these. We feel sure that once these new-comer>O are made aware of this interesting building, they will be anxious to work in it with us in producing shows which are truly representative of the combined ef- forts of the L'nion CollegP student body.\ ---- -o-- ---- BLACKOUT l Cont!u ued from Page 1, Col. 6) were ready for a visit from the burglar who paid them another visit on Thursday evening.

President Fox canH' out for Willkie, joining Presi- dent Cowley of Hamilton in a joint lettez· which told why they switched from Roosevelt to Will· kie. Raymond E. Aldrich '42 and J. Clark Albert '44 headed the Will- kie College Club. They organized a student group which distributed cit-cular::; at the General Electric Company, brought Republican :'pcaket s to the campus and sought to furthPr the cause of Wendell \.Villkie in every way. Willkie has been a successful utility head, and since the cam- paign an unofficial :advisor to the President. He toured England mak- ing a report on their war effort and upon the amr>;:nt of American aid needed. He has 'cpresented the mm·ing picture bu~iness before the Sena:t<' and sought to protect them from an isolationist witch hunt.

The colleges of today, it was being- affirm- ed and reaffirmed, \vould not fall into the er- ror that the colleges of 1917 and 1918 made in changing- theil· essential nature. \College must be kept college\ we were told, and were fm·ther informed that such a policy meant retention of those so-called \extras\ which have become essential to the modem Ameri- can college - varsity and intl'amural athle- tics, as well as extra-curricula!' activities.

She feels that even though the war has temporarily driven \isolationists\ and America First sympathizers into the ranks of the \war party,\ we must not be- lieve that they will remain in that position for any length of time. l\Iiss Thompson feels that these people will eventually begin to set up a wail against our sending- any of our production to Eng- land, and that they \Vill soon be developing blocs against certain important national measures, and that they \Viii always be fer- tile ground for the conciusion of a negotiated peace. She holds that \isolationists\ and \Ameri- ca Firstists\ are often that way either be- cause of essential anti-Americanism or be- cause of sheer stupidity, and she insists that they are a group to be feared. We agree witlt J.\Iiss Thompson on the lat- ter point-so far as some \isolationists\ be concerned, but we cannot ag-ree with her analysis of the motivation of most of them. We feel that the great majority of the group tabbed \isolationists\ was neither anti- American nor stupid. Only Unaware The isolationist g-roup was, on the con- trary, simply unaware of the true nature of the war in which we are today eng-aged. They saw little difference between this war and wars about which they either heard or saw, wars tabbed glibly enoug-h \waes for markets\ and ''wars of personalities\ and \economic wars.\ They failed to recog-nize what was, at the time, manifest in all the declarations of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy as to the true nature of their movement. They failed to recognize that the Fascists and Fascist phi- losophy neg-ated the importance of all that \ve held dear; that they publicly sneered at our \economic man,\ a man whose interests are individual and whose tastes are satisfied by his own hands. They failed to recog-nize the fact that the Fasci-sts really meant what they said when they spoke of their young men being \predatory men,\ men whose in- terest was not economic, but was fighting, and shooting-, and \living gloriously.\ They failed to recog-nize the true sig-nifi- cance of the prophetic titles of the books that were being- written in America by men who had been in Germany to the effect that \You Can't Do Business With Hitler.\ They failed to recognize that an economy based on money and a political philosophy based on individualism just cannot live in the world with an economy based on power and a po- litical philosophy based on the complete un- importance of individualism. They fail- ed to recognize that Fascism, by its nature of \continual war,\ can never stop in con- quest unless the world belongs to it. Contrary to Miss Thompson, we think. that the majority of the mis-named uisola- titmists\ will certainly not return to that be- lief for this war anyway. For they recognize now what the leaders of the nation recog· nized early in 1940-it is ultimately not possible for democratic Unite·d States to live in a world in which there exists a strong Nazi Germany and a Fasi:ct Italy and Japan.

It was rumored last week that the committee was con- sidering the ::;ubstituti~n of mass calisthenics for the in- tramural sports program . * * * \' Neither Hal Wittner nor BiU Ketz had anything to say on the subject last night. Wittner dis- clcsed, however, that the faculty committee had con~ented to the scheduling of varsity athletic con- tests through April 29. * * This action will allow eac.h active varsity team to play 60 per cent of its originally sched- ulPd contests, the othet·s being cancelled becausP of the pre- matm·e closing of college in I~la;y. \\'ittner said the bas!.' ball t<>am will IH'Obably play six of its orig·inally scheduled 10 games; the tracl' tl.'am three of five meets and the lacrosse team about 62 pt>r cent of its scheduled matches. * * Wittner also said that there had been no action toward. pet·mitting freshmen to participate in varsity spor·ts either this spring or next year. He said he had received no inquiries on the subject from col- leges with which Union maintains athletic relations, though he had learned that the Little Three < Wil- liams, Amherst and Wesleyan) may consider such action. * * * No one was n1ore surprised than Phil Sisldnd, Phi Sigma DP!ta sophomorP, when he pick- t-d up a copy of thl.' \N~>w York PoRt' sports page last wPek and discovered that Stanley Frank had devoted his entire daily eolumn, SO inches, to the athletic achievem\'nts of his (Siskind's) fatht>r. * * * Siskind the elder was the only Jewish football player Fordham University ever had.

Lee Shct man put Union ahead :ess than a minute after the game sta1 ted and the GarBet had the contest pretty well under control t hP 1 Pst of the night. When hostil- ities ended Union held the long end of a 50-29 score. \Vith their re~ord balanced at cnc victo1y and one defeat, the Dutchmen leave the campus late this afternoon ior Harliord, Conn., where they'll play Trinity Col'lege tonight. Fol~ owing tonight's game, Coac:1 Ralph Semcratl wi.Jl take his· team to Middleblily, Vt., to play Ben Beck's rather moth-eaten Panthets, who have yet to win a game. Cluwe Goes Hot Buffalo gave Union a real battle during the first half Satmday night, but the second half was a different story. Highlighted by an excellent display of teamwork and E\parked by the clean sho.oting and passwol'l~ of Johnny Clowe, Union completely mastered the Bisons in every department. Union took a 13-6 lead midway in the first half, only to have Buffalo creep up to tie the sco1·e at 18-all 2 minute before the intermission. But Union rallied to gain a 22-18 lead at the half on field goals by Frank Jones and Seymour Meisel. Pe1haps it was a pep-talk, or a shot of adrenalin . . . Whatever the cause, Coach Ralph Semerad's five demonstrated one .of the fin- est bits of offensive strategy a Garnet quintet has shown in some seasons. Buffalo got weaker as time went on. Sccring 18 points in the first 12 minutes of the second half, Union took a 40-19 lead to put the contest on ice. Clowe went on a spree to ta·lly eig:1t of these 18. When the fil·st team had gained a 50-25 lead, coach Semerad inserted t:he re- set ves, who finis·hed the game. Clowe took scoring honors for Union with 14 points. Whitey earn- wright was a close second with 10, while Sophomore Meisel scored nine. Leading scorer for the Bisons was Carl Impellitier with 10 points.

That's what Frank Beniord (l'. ot \Iichigan '10) and \\'. :\. Ruggles, oi the c;-E Research Labora- tory, found when they tested 37 kinds of mirror suriaces. Silver evaporated onto the front surface ot the mirror fwm an electric filament reflected 95 per cent of the incident light . The initial score ior a.luminum was onlv X~ per cent. But six months later the alumi;.wn mirt'or was just as good as ever, while the sil\'el' one had deteriorated considerably . c;old, incidentally, scored third among the pure metals, reflecting X:: per cent .of the light.

A capacity audience is L'Xpect<'d to hear M1ss Jepson, who Is replac- ing Paul Robeson in this, the first concert, due to booking· difficul- ties, will appL'ar here in thP :<Pc- ond of the series, Febr·uary 6. Tick- ets to all the concert:;, which were sold only m strips of three, wPre in such demand that the ChapP! was \sold out\ a few :;hart we<>ks after the seats, all of which are re- served, went on sale. Mi,;s Jepson i:> expected to ar- rive in Schenectady some time Fri- day afternoon. and will stay, dur- ing her stop here, at a downtown hotel. After the concert in the eve- ning, a reception in her ic.onor will be held at the Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity. Rcht>dule ChangPs The shift in tile concert sched- ule was made necessary by th<' Inability of Jussi Bjoerling, Metro- politan tenor to retum to this country because of war conditions. Thus, the managers at .thP Metro- politan were facPd with tht' situa- tion of having to fill, with some- one else, some $70,000 wm th of concerts already booked. for Mr. Bjoerling in this country and Can- ada. The shuffling of p<erfornwrs was accomplished without sPrious harm coming to the Union Concert schedule. Miss Jepson and Mr·. Robeson merely traded places on the calendar, while Arthur Spauld- ing will appear one week later than scheduled, on March 27, since his original date fell dming the pe- riod of the college's new spring va- cation. All dates remain on Friday evenings. It is expected that, due to thP fine sale of tickets, about $1,000 will be realized by the college. all of which will be turned 0ver to the college's Scholarship Fund. ----0--- 'Vic:tory Book Drive' Group Appointed by President Here President Fox announced yeste1·· day that appointment of the local members of the Victory Book Drive. Kenneth Hayes, chairman. Sydney Smith and Cadman Hislop were named to the group, whose purposE' it is to send books to men in mili- tary camps, who are desirious of pursuing their \intellectual curio- sity\ while in the army. The slogan of the drive is, \GivP the book you would like to keep.'' No plan of activity has been an- nounced as yet by the new commit- tee. Dr. Fox, in commenting on thP appointment, said, \Under Mr Hayes' leadership, I know that Union will do its part.\ Three-Year Plans (Continued from Page 1> for the Navy have been added to the college program. Students will have vacation» during July, Au.gust and part of September. Lafayette will reduce its courses from four years to three for the duration of the war. The program calls for lengthen- ing the college year to 41 weeks with no extended vaca.tions and calls for the opening of rollPge im- mediately after Labor Day and closing late in June. Students in ·Cornell's Law School will now 'be able to complete their work for the degt·ee of Bachelor of Laws in two years by working through the Summer. Oberlin has provided for a col- lege yeat· of two years, eight months.

Previously it had been scheduled for March 7, following t:he culmina- tion of a long fight to set a date in the spring. Originally initiations were scheduled for December, but the desire of a num.!Jer of houses to have an opportunity to get a better picture of their pledges as well as to get reports on the mid- year scholarship marlts of the pledges militated against this date. The December date went into effect in 1939 following a de- mand that initiations be moved up so that they would not in~erfere with the winter sports schedule. So far this year, several groups initiated men in December in ac- cordance with the schedule at the beginning of this academic year. Several fraternities have held spe- cial initiations to induct upper class men. ----o---- Professor Bronner Heads Local History Organization Professor FrederiCk L.

Much emphasis was placed upon a greater specialization of the work required .before the curtain is raised for the regular audiences. An innovation will provide for a pre- view performance to be attended by students from the four city high schools in order to get preliminary reactions as well as added funds to help carry on the ·present Mounte- banks' expanded program.

Besides the election, the Coun- cil voted to set up a committee to confer with the l<'aculty Committee on Education, heard Frederic A. Wyatt, ,Director of Admissions, an- nounce that the Chailman of the :::Jtudent Council would sit in on the Admissions meetings and elected William Wetter·au '43, to replace Douglas Slingerland '43, who has joined a fraternity.

The Council voted this suggestion down, and it was then moved that all otficers of the Council who in- tend to run for office resigv. their p1·esent offices before the election. l'his motion was also voted down. Killian then announced th,at all Council members in Category B were eligible for election. That included Avery Bee1, Abraham Dorsman, . .l!;dward C. Enstice, ltob- er·t Newton and Ben Jakobowski. As membees individually nominated, Mel Messenger '43, got up and nom- mated them all as eligible. Elected on F:i,rst Vote Dorsman was elected on the first ballot but failed to obtain a clear majority. Killian then ruled, after a reading of the constitution, that another vote was necessary, and the two lowest men were stricken; tram the ballot. Dorsman was then etected. The runner-up, Edward c. En- stice, was unanimously made secre- tary. The committee, which is to meet with an equal number of members Olt the Faculty Committee on Edu- cation, will consist of the Chairman of the Council and the presidents of the three upper classes. John Grow '42, in making his motion, pointed out the necessity of the committee, and the Council quickly agreed with him when it passed his motion without a dissenting vote. It is believed that the com- mittee will be expanded at the next meeting. Approve Dance The Council gave its apjnoval to the joint Freshman-Sophomore Dance. However, the date was shifted from February 21 to March 7 so as not to conflict with fra- temity initiations. The class presi- dents announced that a joint Sopho- more-Freshman meeting will be held in the Old Chapel on Monday dur- ing chapel period. Raymond E. Aldrich '42, Chair· man of \Smoke Screen,\ was voted $5.30 to cover his mailing and wrapping expenses. Wyatt, through the Council, thanked the students for the work they had done over the vacation in seeing students. The President of the Student Body, whom the Admissions Com- mittee picked as the representative ft om the Council they wanted, will come as an observer, Mr. Wyatt said. He will discuss admission problems, offer suggestions and pre- sent the student viewpoint, but Will have no voice. For him to serve as an actual member would require the approval of the Faculty Committee on Educa- tion, and \everybody from the President down would vote against that,\ he said.

Question on THE FRATERNITY ·wAR PROBLEM' There is a profes·sot· named Bennett T , M • everybody's Ups, \Which is east, Who !Jives on statistics and rennet. rustees eetmg. which is west?\ There are those in authority who are claiming today that an effect of this war on the academic scene wi:ll be the destruction of most social fraternities. While there is little either in the realm of fact or logic to recom- mend this opinion, it is yet wise to deter- mine why \authority\ is feeling impelled to predict the doom of an institution which be- gan some 117 years ago on the Union campus: It is, in the first place, important to recog- nize that the \war problem\ does not, of it- self, constitute, any new fraternity problem; it merely magnifies old ones. These stand- ard problems that are constantly before any fraternity may be placed in two maj.or cate- gories: The first might be termed \mqintenance of intrafratemity cohesion and interfrater- nity acceptability;\ the second is best class· ified as ''economic survival/, 'Cohesion•, 'Acceptability' The first problem has never presented any great difficulty to Union fraternities. To be sure, chapter houses have varied in their de- grees of respect for college regulations, for study, and for wise policies of freshman orientation; l:)ut this variation has never faced Union with serious problems. Clearest illustration of this point may be found in the fact that Union all-men's aver- ages never differ significantly from all-fra- ternity averages on campus, and that it has been many a year since the colleg-e has been forced to take disciplinary action against any social group. Union f1·atemities, through this tradition of an essential decency and an essential respect for the institution of study, have built for themselves a foundation that might be expected to weather strong storms. So far as the college is concerned, there seems little reason to expect that the effect of the war will be the destruction of this •·•mainteBance of intrafratemity cohesion and int~rfraternity acceptability •. \ We do not make this claim for all frate.rnities. As a matter of fact, a glance at .several other \fraternity colleges\-some of which are now waging bitter warfare over the value of their social groups-will show j.ust how im~ portant the record of Union's fraternities really is. 'Economic Survival' With the second problem-that of eco- nomic. survival-our groups have also enjoy- ed success. The number of houses which have passed from the campus ken because of financial mismanagement is very few in- deed.

Justifica- tion for their claim, they say, is in the fact that their house was the Republican stronghold during the 1940 campaign while the Beta House was a Democratic stronghold. The Betas lean to the bond of membership. It is really on this latter point-economic survival-that Union fraternities will exper- ience difficulties in the future. It is really this economic question, and all that it con- cerns, which constitutes the \war problem\ for social groups here. 'l'o rolks who are ill He gives a green pill. J:lut its contents he never can tell us. The Corn Is Green Prices are beginning to spiral upward at the same time that college enrollment is be- ginning to spiral downward. The acute buy- ing problems which are beginning to face fraternities have already been recognized on some campuses which have announced the establishment of \Fraternity Business Man- agement\ groups. Manager's Council It is extremely fortunate that steps to- ward group cooperation and group buying among the Union fraternities have been taken. The Interfraternity Manager's Coun- cil has been established in workable form. It is fortunate because the war has raised financial problems for Union fraterNities which makes it absolutely imperative for them to cooperate, to work together, and to buy together. The question of group buying is no longer a question of good theory alone -it is o11e of practical necessity. Fraternal groups-particularly those less fortunate financially-must recognize that sheer necessity is driving them to infuse strong s:pirit into the Manager's Council- and that it is necessary to their successful existence to do so.

The College Needs: A renewed Pyramid Council attempt to se- cure a game room for the non-fraternity men. An addition to the Defense Council, now conce1'11ed with physical matters, to provide sthldent sp.eakers for the community, to have charge of student collections (books, cigar- ettes) for men in the armed services.

We hope Editor Green begins such a return to the lit- erary magazine policy which the Idol is sup- posed to pursue. A change in the elective system of the Student CouReil, so that the Student Council Chairman may be elected by the entire.

The College Has Benefi.fted: From the action of the Student Council to appoint a four man committee to meet, as a co;nference committee, with a similar num- ber of faculty members. for the discussion of mutual problems and for the presentation of the student viewpoint.

Monday Miss Law will begin work ir.. the personnel department of the General Electric Company. Professor William Whipple Bennett paid tribute to Miss Law when he pointed to the tremen- dou::; work the job involves, the loyalty ::;he has given and the ef- ficient way in which she has handled the work. Miss Law said, \My associa- tions and work here at the col- lege have given me a gteat deal of happiness, and I shall never for- get the kindly thoughts and friendly greetings received from so many of Union's students. It h cet·tainly a grand family and I ~hall miss being one of you.\ Education Department Officials Speak Here \Mobilizing Schools for Civilian Defense Training\ will be the sub- ject of the Empire State Town :\1eeting on Sunday afternoon.

Announces aTelescoped' Year Troy-Following Union's lead a month later, RPI had announced a \part time war schedule\ which will allow seniots to graduate on May 17. After Union had cut her schedule, RPI students scoffed at the action as being unnecessary and panicky. In announcing the action which will be recommended to the Spe- ci:J.l Defensr Committee of the Trustees, President William Otis Hotchkiss said, \Seniots and Jun- iors will have their advance re- view and examination within each week period, while the Sophom0res and Freshmen will continue their regular schedule without change with the exception of Trip Week which has been eliminated for all divisions. Thet e will be no Satur- day classes.\ The same reason was given for the move as was given at Union. Seniors will enter the armed forces and industry a month earlier while juniors will also \enter employ- ment at an earlier time to contrib- ute to the toal war effort.\ Examinations in all classes will be given on Saturdays during the fitst seven weeks of the second srmester. No mention was made of a \three year plan.\ including sum- mer sessions. 0 Glee Club to Sin~ John Grow '42, manager of the Glee Club, has announced that the choir will give its first concert of the year on Sunday at St. Paul's Church in Troy.

Wyatt, Dir ec- tor of Admissions, announced yes- terday. The students will travel to Gar- den City with Mr. Wyatt on Feb- ruary 9, spending that night at the homes of various high school stu- dents interested in Union. The program at Garden City, on Feb- ruary 10, will ·be at a general as- sembly of all students, while those at White Plains and Poughkeepsie will be held for all interested students. The discussion. which will be aE informal as is practicable, will be intended to answer as many ques- tions as possible that high school students may have about college. It is expected that emphasis will be placed on college problems in general, without specific reference to Union. The round-ta·bles will be followed by question periods . Principal's Suggestion Mr. \Vyatt pointed out tha.t these programs are 'being undertaken at the suggestion of the principal of the Garden City High School. The principals of the White Plains and Poughkeepsie High Schools have been enthu!>iastic about the idea. If these pzograms are succesEful, others will undoubtedly be ar- t·anged in other parts of the coun· try, he added. The students who are planning to make this first trip include Clarence Woodward '42, John Dutcher '43, Granger Tripp '43. Jules Viglielmo •44, Andrew Com- rey '44, Alden Opie '45.

The cessation of broadcasting was necessitated by a series of changes in the equipment which are now unC:e1 way, Mills said. It was felt that the changes could be completed more effectively if broadcasting were suspended while they were under way. Mills said that when UBS begins broadcasting again, it will be with a new and longer time schedule, with emphasis on live talent pro- grams pertaining to the campus. Another new feature of the pro- graming may be the re-broad- casting of ce1 tain national net- work programs. Arangements for this are now under way. Whether tr:ey will be successfully completed or not should be determined in the near future, Mills said. The lJBS is also making arrange- ments to purchase complete studio Pquipment, in order to facilitate live programs of a more varied nature. Recent action by the Stu- dent Tax Committee will make this possible, Mills said. To Extend Coverage Still another ventm·e planned by the organization for its time off the air is the exten;;ion of tbe wtring which joins the station's transmitter with the various fra- tPrnities and dormitories. Mills said that since the station began its activities in the fall, the cost of the wire had been doubled. Defense priorities are also interfering with the purchase of certain pieces of equipment. although for the most part dealers still have stocks of the equipment needed. During the pez iod in which UBS is off the air, both the .engineering and program staffs will be in- C! eased. Mills said that students mterested in work in radio would be welcomed. Engineers should get in touch with Paul Yergen, '44, and program men with Mills. ------a------ Anderson, Klarman Head Joint Dance Committee Andrew ::VI. Anderson, '45, and Karl Klarman, •44, have been ap- pointed co-chairmen of the Fresh· man-Sophomore Dance. The ap- pointments were made on Monday, January 11. Anderson and Klarman have al· rc>ady begun work on the dance. The announcement of the names of men on the full committees is expected before Friday. Anderson and Klarman said yesterday that .they had already begun work on the task of pro- curing an orchestra for the affair, which will be held in Alumni Gym- nasium on March 6.

It is even necessary to weather a barrag-e of criticism when one timidly sug-gests that answers to certain pt·oblems may not be quickly, easily and a:ccurately forthcoming, even though the individual or individuals mls\vel·ing are sup- posed to be qualified by virtue of \experi- ence.\ It should be with some trepidation, there- fore, that we question whether the Graduate Record Examinations, for which seniors are now tegistering, are quite the magic that some have claimed they are. It should be with the same trepidation that we question the ability of any fact-accumulation exam- inations to be set up a.s self ordained arbiters of what a colleg·e senior \!mows\ in a given field. John P. Lewis, '41, had this to say in The Ccmcordiensis of Februa1·y 21, 1941: \Victims fo1· the most part agree that the exams are an infemal nuisance. They resent appearing at eight a. m. and departing· four hours later saddle-sour and humiliated. But if our objection is to a nui-sance alone it will not prove enough of a rallying cry for an effective opposition. \The Graduate Record Exams, however, I believe are frankly dangerous to the curri- cular life of the college as it now stands. They cannot be assimilated; they may, on the other hand, act as the roots of a new teaching program. \Of necessit.v the exams me objective. They test fact-accumulation and for the most pmt, only that. The man who fares well is the one v·:ho reads ·with a retentive memory. Dic- tated by the limitations of scoring tech- niques, this weighting of emphasis only fol- lows the ruling obsession of modern Amer- ican \learning\ from kindergarten to Ph. D. But he1·e at Union and at othe1· intelligently staffed institutions, recent!~· there has been a tendency to teach students to think as well as to learn. Some instructors have tried to rate men less on what they know than upon what they can do in rounding up their own nntcrial, in anal~·sing, interpreting, and pre- senbng it in 0rganized fashion. Seni:ors, so treated, have found their misled activity re- flected in non-flattering G. R. E. profiles. \Y say, however, a 'tempest in a teapot. \\'e admit that ti1ese exam::; are no bargain, but after all they don't have the dit·e conse- quences ~·ou suggest.' I'm not at all sure. When G. R. E. originated seve1·al years ago, they were just a happr little game. Not so now. The examiners are modest about their proteg-e in the first half hour of conversa- tion. Then thei1· epic confidence appears. Last ~'eaT, I believe, a Union ~enior ·with a colleg-e standing of la::;t in his field led the g-roup on the G. R. K When queried on the matter by a department which had been working with the student for four ye~u·s, the Carnegie representative Rerenely replied, 'I'm sor1~·. but you gentlemen will have to revise your estimate.' \G. H. E. are on the way to determining entry to the best gTaduate schools in the country. Proponents state blandly, 'They will not be used a.gain::;t you.' What is the obvious inference that any discerning admis- sions official at Harvard will make if Oscar Jones of l_Tnion Coilege (where they have G. H. E.) doesn't suumit a profile \vith his application'?\ \Vhile there may oe room for question of some of :.\Ir. Lewis' abstractions, his analysis at least demonstrates that it is not partic- ularly wise to think of a.ny four hour exam- ination as a magic score sheet for a senior's knowledge or even, in some cases, as a suc- cessful standard for determining- an upper- chts:oman's knowledg-e in relation to other U)perch1ssmen. It further demonstrates that l.hel'e is room fm· argument over the merits of the Graduate Hecord Examinations. It might be desirable if some of that argu- ment arose here, as Lewis indicates it did, to a minor degree last spring. We wonder if Am~rican colleges are not often too prone to seek out and determine this form of easy answer which, in the minds of too many peo- ple, puts an indelible stamp of \Good\ or \Bad\ upon a man's college training. 1ssimo~ she was truly superb.

Capacity Audience Of 1300 Hears Jepson A capacity audience of approxi- mately 1,300 attended the recital giver.. •by Miss Helen Jepson last Friday night, accordin.g to Mr;o_ Dixon Ryan Fox. Although there were some empty seats, because of the failure of tickethoider·s to attend, the concert was a sellout. If there had been any more seats ava-ilable, they could all have been sold, Mrs. Fox said. Right up until the beginning of the concert people continued phoning to inquire whether there were any tickets to be had. While waiting at the Alpha De:ta Phi house until her train left at 1:00 a. m., Mis::, Jepson told of her experiences at other colleges. She chatted informally about how .some students in the middle west took her on a fishing trip. Although a novice she was the only member of the pa1·ty to hook any fish, Miss J cpson said. Mrs. Fox pointed out that Miss Jepson sang \Home Sweet Home\ one of her encores Friday, at the home of John Howard Payne on the occasion of the one hundredth anniversary of his ·birth. -~----o-~- !Bowdish, '42, Married Cli!ford Eber Bowdish, Jr., '42, of Al·bany, and the former Miss Shirley Heien Wendell were mar- ried on New Year's Eve at Sara- toga Springs, according to a recent \Albany Times-Union\.

THE UNION FRATERNITIES College Receives Correspondence Portrait Of Hamilto~ He went quietly and with the full l'nowledge that no matter what •a man may have done on this cam- pus, he fades quickly from the memory of underg-raduates. We have followed with a great deal of in- terest the concentrated fire that \The Wil- liams Record\ has been centering upon the fraternities at that college. The Williams newspaper has charged social groups there with disinterest in coope1·ating with the ad- ministration in certain important college ac- tivities, and \vith failure to pursue the proper educational goals. The campaig-n is of all the more interest to us, at \vhose college social fraternities originated, because it enables us to square up our fraternities and their achievements with those at another college similar to our own. And, on the whole, the squaring up process (if \The Record\ be read) is in our favor. Insofar as 1·elations and cooperation with the administration be concerned, we can find no more favorable situation anywhere than that which exists here. An outstanding ex- ample of this is to be found in the ease and freedom with which the fraternity presi- dents and the adminish·ation changed and changed ag-ain the date for fraternity initia- tions.

TUESDAY, JANUARY 20, 1942 Union's Financial Problem :Is New First World War Raised No Sueh Diffqculties as Are Now Faced, Waldron Says Dul'ing the last war Union had no such tinanctal wornes as n nuw has, Dt·. Charles N. V\ialdrun, Secre- tary of the Collef(e, indicated yes- terday. Dr. Waldron reca'lled that the po- sition of aJ.I colleges during the last war was assured by the govern- mt>nt which paid full tuition tor all students. In retun1, the students were obliged to enlist in the Student Training Army Corps by the ~C,uv­ ernment. Besides paying either $250 or $300 for each stutle:lt enrolled in the college, the govel'lmwnt handlPJ the admissions by admitting all who volunteered tor thC' S1'AC.

Mrs, Young replaces Miss Anna May Law, who resigned her position to work in the personnel department of the Genet al Electric Company. Miss Law completed a five yPar term as sect,elary on Friday. Dr. Bennett, in making his an- nouncement, said that Ml's. Young would not •be able to begin worlt for a few days. In the meantime, a substitute, Miss Lois Holly of Schenectady, wil'l ca·rry on the duties of the office on a part time basis. In considering appJi.cants for the po:;ition, the Student Tax Commit- tee examined the possibilities of en- gaging a part time worker perma- nently. Howevet·, it was decided that this would seriously hamper the wo1 k of the ofHce, and con- sequently. ::Ylrs.

Butzer, of the Westminster Church in Buffalo, said in his sermon in Memorial Chapel Sunday ''Fait·h is indi~pensable to cour- age, patience, determination, and hope,\ the Rev. :!lllr. Butzer went on. \We cannot do our .best now without faith in the future.\ \I su,;pect that many of us now have a certain fear of the future\ the speaket said. \·We are tempt- ed to assume that there is nothing to do but wait and wonder. What nonsense! The futut·e is what you make it. It is in your control\. Turning to the feelings of men who are about to be drafted, the Rev. Mr. Butzet· admitted that there is a natur·al tendency for them to say \What's the use?\ He described his own experience with a similar situation in the fitst World War. pointing out that he and his comrades had to adjust themselves to the conditions of military life. \Ever.. life in the Army and Navy is what you make it\ he said. \Men must plan to return from the war to carry out their present plans\ he added. \We mmt have faith. Our prob- iems can be solved\ .\llr. Butzer said. Answering the arguments of thoee ·who point to those whose faith has not been justitfied, the Rev. .\fr. Butzer said that the faith we need is not an ecu;y go- mg optimism. \Humanism will •be one of the unwept casualties of this wat·,\ he said. ------0---- tCo·ntm ued from Page ll \The Idol\ could take would :be one to re-open the pages of the maga- zine to campus contribution, and to make a determined effort to get those contributions.

Thatcher, co-ordinator of the program, said today. He explained that the story car- ried last week in the town papers and in The Concordiensis was writ- ten from information given him verbally 'by the CAA inspector. No official confirmation has come through as yet from either Albany, Washington, or New Yolk although \we are keeping the wires ·burning for details of the spring program.\ The CAA is at present waiting for official applications, contracts, assignment quotas, and all the other necessary information before going ahead wit·h the course. \I .believe that we will be under some regulation much like those affecting students in the V-7 class of the United States Naval Reserve which would allow students to com- plete their college education and theii ·CAA education before joining the Army Air ·Corps. Dr. Thatcher will announce all further information on the CAA in The Concordiensis as soon as it is received. ---a--- Graduate Record Exams Scheduled for February Graduate Record examinations for seniors will be given late in February, Miss Charolette Rap- pelje, ·secretai·y to the Dean, said today. No da~e has as yet ·been set for them. Sophomores r will also take an ex- amination more similar to the Sen- ior Graduate Record examinations than ever before. These will be kept on file and will ·be compared with the senior examinations. 0 I Gresham, '44, Pledged Phi Gamma Delta fraternity an-1 nounces the pledging of Jack.! Gresham '44 of Schenectady.

The first prize, a pair of shell- bach .burettes, was won by Sey- mour Meisel, '44. Dr. Fox's Statem.ent In a statement to The Concordi- ensis, President Fox said: \During the next few years each of us will be living two lives. We shall be normal, civilized human beings part of the time, each with his problems of personal growth in every way, and of ·maintenance, pt·oduction and general community coopet·ation; we shall also be war units either in present direct serv- ice or in training for more valuable service than we can now render. \The college experience, as it happens, builds toward meeting both needs. The well-balanced, hard working student will be as- sured that he is simultaneously pre- paring-loading up, we might say- for his greatest effectiveness in war and peace. For trained minds and even well informed minds are a national asset in time of war. \General Hershey, the Dit·ector of Selective Service, desiring that college students, so far as possible, complete their intellectual train- ing bef01:e going to war, has indi- cated that it is unlikely that young men will be called before they be- come 21 years of age. The cofleges on their part, are making it possi- ble for the aver age student to graduate at about that age by affording the opportunity of a complete course in three years. So far as I can learn every college with men students in this state will offer such a plan. Union will keep its two present academic terms. and will take students on the old four-year schedule if they desire to run the risk or if they are not admitted to the three-year; but two fourteen week summer terms permit those who can carry them to shorten the course by a year. \The summer term of 1942 will start on May 18 and will 1un to August 29. The registration for the fall term will begin on Sep- tember 8. \Many details, such as those touching upon tuition charges for the summer, times of payment, possible Pxtra loans and scholar- :<hips, etc., will have to ·be an- r.ounced later. A year-round pro- gtam of physical education, which n,ay affect time schedules may ::oon be suggested by a Faculty (Continued on Page B>

As it must to all colleges, the three year course came last night to l 1 nion. It came a::> a result of the desire l.Joth of the college and the national g-overnment that students be enabled to complete a~ soon a::; possible their formal underg-raduate tnlin- ing; it was developed on the basis of meas- ured judg-ment after the needs and require- ments of the students and the college had been keenly analyzed. We can have nothing but the utmost of admiratian fer the versicm of the three year plan that the administration and the Com- mittee on Education have worked out for Union. With a minimum of dislocation and a ma~~i:mum of utility, it has fitted the pecu- liaT pmblems of the Union College commun- ity to national dE:mands. In an era in which educa,tional institutio-ns are shooting off thei1· tops in making comp·lei:ely unrealistic changes in their structure, it gives us the greatest satisfa:dian that Union has fallen prey to none of ihe traps that war hysteria is setting today. Features of the Pl.an lt should be noted that we retain here the semeste1· system and the great ma.i ority of the course::; wllieh \H:re taught before the beginning of the war. Further, those courses which will be offered for the first time this summer and fall are well chosen. An exam- ple of this is the course that the Social Stud- ies Division will offer as S. S. 37 A, \Prob- lems of Labor and }la.nagement.\ In these days of insatiable demand on the pat·t of in- dustry fm· men who are able to act as assist- ants to the foremen and managers who are now forced to work up to sLxteen hout·s a day, any program of study \Vhich gives an insig-ht into the managerial p·roblems of in- dustry can only l.Je extremely valuable. It should be noted that Union's three year plan makes degree requirements in the shortened course just as severe as the~· are under the present fom· year setup. No man will be granted a degree after three year::> of work unless he completes just al.Jout as many semeste1· homs in just about the same fields as the men who will gmduate with the class of 1942 this }lay. It should be noted that there is no com- pulsion, either direct or indirect, on the part of the colleg-e for a student to take the three year course in preference to the four. There is full opportunity for either o-ption. it should be nofe,d that the summer term is -considered a summer session, rather than a ''summer semester\-an important distinc~ tion. The load of courses in this summer session may thus be developed with a prac- tical eye to the season of the year in which they will l.Je pursued, and to the problems which the season will engender. No man in a three year schedule will be loaded with a full five course burden for the duration of a sticky Schenectady summer. It sJwuld be noted that there is opportun- ity for men to take their summer work in other accepted institutions. To certain stu- dents in the college this will mean great con- venience. In Substance In substance, the Union three year plan facilitates the educational progress of a stu- dent rather thml confuses it-the case with many of the three year curricula now spring- ing up. It makes possible the retention of those values which are now accepted by edu- cation, to the exclusion of those less mean- ingful, less practical, and more radical \val- ues\ now being developed elsewhere.

More With the necessity fo1· permitting a stu- dent credit for each semester of a two sem· e:;l.cr course, there is reason to fear for sur- vival of the year-course plan at Union.

Exploratit)n \The most certain source of ad- venture is exploration. . , , Today there -are relatively few parts of the earth left unexplored, but there is one field which is abundant in new tenltory to .be discovered. In- deed. it has the curious quality that the more of it we explore the more there is unexplored. This is the -realm of truth. And of all the forms of human endeavor, I would hazard the guess that research in thil' realm has given high adven- ture to a larger percentage of its explorers than any other, 'be they arctic expeditions, aviation, travel, or fighting. \Of course within this realm of truth there are many different paths to follow. Almost every member of our faculty is exploring in one or another of them. Their talks reveal that all of these men are equally thrilled with their ex- periences. \When one examines <as the psy· chologist does) the possibilities of the human mind, the findings are startling <and adventurous) to say the least.

Professor Everett W. Thatcher, coordinator of Union's ·program yesterday exhibited orders from the n&tional CAA mentioning an order of May 1, 1941, directing draft hoards to defe1· CAA trainees. Dr. Thatcher has received a form let- ter which wHl be sent to all draft boards under whose jUlisdiction en- t·alees fall. Details of the p1og1·am have not ) et been worked out. It is not !mown whethe1· students must take CA.A course continuously while they stay in college or whether they will be· permitted to take the primary com se, then take no air training until the final semestct· of thei·r college com ses. Cmuse Starts February Professor Thatcher pointed out that present juniors are practically rssUJ ed of completing college if they take the CAA course starting in early February. They may take tl;e primary course this semester, the seconda1·y dllling the summer session and cross-country course will be instituted here during the fall term if there is sufficient de- mand. After cornplet\ng requirements for graduation by next Decem- ber, the trainee could enlist in the At my or Navy A it· Corps or take the full time CAA instructor;; course to qualify for an instruc- tor's certificate. Employment in defense instruction of pilots or in cr.mmercial flying would further defer the cltudent from compulsory service. Quotas Received A quota of 30 primary trainees Rnd 20 secondat·y students has been received for the spring program. Age limit has been lowered to 18 yPal'fl of age so that now the re- quirements for registration provide that the applicant must be between the ages of 18-25; he must have at least two years of college or one year in college providing that he is registered in college at the pres- ent time; and he must pass a physical examination. The ·government has agreed to re- fund the fees paid by pilot training student for medical examinations and for insurance on completion of the cou1 sc. Because the medical fN• is $12 and the fee fm' insurance !s seven dollars this would repre- ~ent a saving of 17 dollars by stu- dents completing the cou1·se suc- cessfully. 'The only remaining charge will be $10 for ground training. Dr. Thatcher said that the first meeting of applicants will take !'lace carl~· in February and that lette1s of notification will be sent to those men already registered. --a---- Plan to Revitalize Managers• Council \Mem.bers of the Managers' Coun- cil feel that the war has made group cooperation and buying all the more necessary,\ said Philip Thompson, '43, yesterday when he told The Concordiensis that the Council will begin meeting regu- lnrly in about a week Thomson said that he had been in contact with several fraternity representatives in the past few clays, nil of whom were convinced that it might be of great benefit tel the houses if some of them could cooperate during the summct· program. Thomson pointed out the financial advantages that would be obtained if two houses, with reduced summer membership, were to combine during the months of June, July and August. Further necessity for group ac- tion is found in the ,problems that fl'atcmity houses now face with rpduccd membership. Thomson pointed out, for example, that the Chi Psi house now has eight less r.\en at the>ir table . Adequacy of Illumination, Reference Books Desirable in Mernorial Library Firs1' A.rticHe of Series '?@.•e--------------- --------- -· ·------------ 1o Be Conducited Sfresses Importance of Sore Spots One of the traditional questions asked by visitors to Union after thei·r f.irst view of the campus has been, \What is that peculiar circular building out there?\ This is usually accompanied by a ges- ture toward the stately dome of Nott Memorial Library standing, as it does, in the heart of the campus, surrounded by green lawns and reared against the gentle arc of Washburn Hall. The library, one of the original buildings designed by Jacques Ramee nearly 150 years ago, stands today not only in the geo- Dr. EJ.iphalet Nott Potter. Its present-day status as the College Library was not definitely de- termined, nor did it receive its present name until after the turn of the century, in accordance with the Nott Memorial Celebration of 1904, in honor of Union's greatest president. Since that time it has served as the place of study and research for the college commu- nity. It was refurnished in 1936, when the present circular desks were installed. They were formerly oin use in the old Seth Low Library at Columbia University, brought here when Columbia built its new library building.

Saturday was ·officially designated as \Concot·diensis Day\ by Presi- d(nt Fox early last week. According to the advance pro- gram, issued late last week, \Con- cordiensis Day\ ceremonies will be- gin with Saturday's pai!y Assembly program. During the program, a distinguished Union alumnus, for- mer!~· a member of The Concor- diensis staff, will be awarded a scroll in recognition of his work in the field of journalism. The name of the winner of this scroll will be announced on Friday. WinnN' Will Speak After the presentation of the scroll, the winner will be invited to address the student body. The second scheduled event of the day is the press conference to he held in The Concordiensis office at 2 p. m. Students interested in juurnalism from some 60 high schools near Schenectady have been invited to attend and take part in the discussion. Members of The Concordiensis Senior Board and n group of Concordiensis alumni -who are now prominent in jour- nalistic fields will act as discussion leaders. The climax of the day's program will occur at 6:30 p. m in Hale House. when the anniversary dinner will be held. Musical Satire After the banquet, the winners of the 1942 freshman editorial com- petition will be announced. The men so named will be those recom- mended for positions on The Concordiensis staff for the next year. Another feature of the annivers- at\Y dinner will be the presentation of \Let the Grecians Scr•eam,\ a musical satire written by members of the staff and presented under the direction of Stanley Green, '43 . The cast will be made up of mem- bers of the staff. Some 20 members of the college faculty have been invited to be present at the anniversary dinner, as have some 50 alumni who are forme!' members of the staff. The alumni and the present under- graduate staff will form the basis of \The Concm diensis Club\ which will be officially constituted at the banquet. More than $7 worth of the orig- inal $10 worth of Defense Stamps purchased by the book- stot·e for sale last week have al- ready been sold, Mrs. Jenkins, manager, said today. She predicted an even greater sale of the .25 stamps when the campus become better acquaint- ed with the fact that they are being sold by the bookstore. The stamps were put on sale last wee]{ without much public- ity. Students have discovered that they were being sold there from an announcement placed in the window and from a small article in The Concordiensis. The bookstore also has albums to paste them ln. Debate Schedule~~ Emphasis Shifted Shifts in emphasis for purposes of discussion work for the varsity debaters has been announced by Harvey Fishbone '43, manager of debate. This semester the Philo- mathean squad will study the ef- fect of war upon the domestic scene, prepar·ation for peace as a result of attitudes and forces oper- ating in the country, and the post- war world. Debates have already been sched- uled with Skidmore College, Boston University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Clarkson Institute of Technology, and Columbia Univer- sity, while arrangements for a New England trip are underway.

Are the reference books which the library buys suitable for the needs of the students m their various fields of study, and are these books used extensively by the students once they are pur- chased? Are the books which are considered \good\ in their fields only to be found among those which have long since been out· .dated? Lighting System What is the answer to the question which develops between the data compiled by lig\hting en- gineers in 1936, which holds that the lighting on library desks. is adequate for comfortable study, and the testimony of students and faculty whose number is legion, to the effect that any possibility of efficient study at the library desks is impossible due to the dim· ness of the illuminating system? The answers to these and other questions is to be found only through a thorough investigation, and the results of such an in- vestigation of this type will be printed on these pages in suc- ceeding issues. 36 Men Withdraw Half In Services Poor Marks Cause Six To Leave; Nine Work; Finances Affect Two A list made public today of the names of Union students who have withdrawn from college showed that of 36 men who have gone, ex· actly half are in the service of the United States in one form or an- other. Of the other 18, 6 have left col· lege because of poor work, 9 be- cause of work, 2 because of fin· ances and one for no reason at all. Five men, who have left the sen- lot• class, are all in the Army as are the 3 juniors. Of the 12 juniors, five are in the a1·med forces and of 16 freshmen, only four are in the Army although one more may join soon. Those working at•e all in defense industries. Some are emp!.oyed lo· cally by the General Electric Com- pany, American Locomotive Com- pany, while the others are in air- craft at Pratt Whitney and Cur- tiss Aircraft. No More Than Usual Last Thursday Dr. Fox in his statement referring to the number of students who have left college said that the figure\ ... represents scarcely more than the usual num- erical loss.\ Those who have left school to join the armed forces include: 1942, Robert K Baker, Air Corps; Charles F. Clowe, Air Corps; Rob· ert K. Killian; Alft•ed A. Knopf, Jr., Air Corps; Frank S. Thyne, Jr., Advanced CAA course. From 1943, Frank W. England, Reserve Officers School: Manuel A.

Next Registrants Will Not Go Soon Officials Say Earlier Drawings Will Provide Majority of Selectees WASHINGTON, Jan. 26-0nly a few of the 9,000,000 men who will 1 egi,ter fat· select·ive service Feb! u- ary 16 are likely to be called to the colors soon, officials have indicated, the United Press r€ipot·ted. The bulk of the manpower in the immediate future will come fl·om the 17,500,000 already registered, selective service author.ities said. The number of men over 36 years of age who will be called to com- plete this year's 3,600,000 man army will be \proportionately very small,\ it was said. Although definite plans :have not yet been made, a new order list wi.Jl .probably be created to deter- ·mine how the new age groups- 20 to 21 and 36 to 44- will be called up. Brigadier-General Lewis B. Her- shey, Selective Service Director, hinted at this procedure when he said, \if you have gr,ass already cut, you'd better get it in the barn before you begin cutting any more.\ Another reason why new t egis- trants will not be integrated among present order lists, as they were after· last summer's lottery is that we're at war now-we're call- ing men for active service, not for training alone and speed is essen- tial, officials said. Sources available for new selec- tees, exclusive of men registering next month, were listed as .follows: !-Approximately 1,000,000 men from 21 to 28 who already have been classified 1-A and are avail- able immediately. 2- An estimated 200,000 to 400,000 whose l·B classification probably will be changed to 1-A under a wa.r-time relaxation of physical re- qmrements. 3--Approximately 800,000 men of 1-A callber who were deferred under last summer's policy of ex- empting men between 28 and 35 wheJ,ever possible. 4---Ap.proximate-ly 50,000 men who were classified 4-A and deferred because they already had received military training. This totals aibout 2,100,000 men which is 200,000 more than would be necessary to reach the 1942 goal of 3,600,000. Secretary of War Stimson last week set the Army's present strength at 1,700,000 men. Officials indicated that machinery for tapping manpower registel\ing next month would be set up im- mediately qJter order numbers have been determined b.y lottery. They said numbers would be drawn out of this historic \fish bowl\~.for the third time since the selective act was passed late in 1940 -\about a month\ after Fe-bru- ary 16. Thus, men in the new age groups may expect to receive question- naires next spring . Selective service officials expect about 60 per cent of t-he 20-21 acre group to meet 1-A requirements while all but 5 per cent of the 36-44 group will probably be in- eligible because of dependents and physical deficiencies. ----0•---- Houghton Home Renovated The floor, electric light system. pla.stering and plumbing have been completed in the new Hough- ton. house on the third floor of Silliman Hall.

There are thirty-six such men, eighteen of whom have left for military purposes. It is difficult to over-emphasize the im- portance of this data. It clemonstrates that Union students have taken seriously the re- quest that has been made to them by the President of the lTnited States, by the War and Navy Departments, and by the college through P1·esident Fox. They have remained in college so that the~· might complete theil· tmining and be of much gTeater value to the nation thereby. l.lany Union men are earma1·ked for vari- ous forms of militmT duty-son-ie in the m m~·. some in the navy. Certain other tech- nical!~· tmined students will entel' defense industries upon their g-raduation. Pnion students are and will serve their nation. They have recognized sensibly that their present duty is that of remaining in college following a normal pattem of life and doing as good a job as possible of their obli- gations.

These last year's seniors had had four years of experience with the Council system behind them and by virtue of that fact alone were qualified to pass judgment on its virtues and faults. under the present system of elections in which 3 1/3 ~;. of the student body elects the man who is termed Student Body Chairman, or one in ·which nominations are secret.

Pressure of \Val' and of attendant calendar changes made it impossible for action to be taken thus far this year; the need for such action yet remains. One can expect a strong and active student govemment with strong and active student interest only when there is full reason fo1· such strong and active reason. No such interest is possible under the present system of elections in which one spring morning in chapel-a moming \vhose date is kept secret so that the Student Body is presumabl;\· taken by surprise-all elec- tions are held. No such interest is possible The entire Student Body should be permit- ted to vote on Student Body President, nom- inations should be open rathe1· than secret, there should be some opportunity for men in a class to nominate members of that class who will stand for election, there should be full publicity of the names and records of the men up for election, and the day set for elec- tion should be widely publicized some days before it is to dawn. Such changes in the system of elections would mean a wo!'ld of good to Union stu- dent govemment. THE RECORD EXAMS AND CRITICAL SPIRIT So far as we know, discussion on Graduate Record Examinations has scm·cely taken place among Union students. That this situ- ation is unfortunate is only painfully clear; when men take a series of examinations which are supposed to pass important judg- ment upon their college training, they should at least be sure of the claim to make and score such examinations which is possessed by the examiners. It would seem to us exttemely wise if col- lege upperclassmen wer·e to discuss these examinations among themselves and with faculty members. Thete would, by the time another examination period had rolled around, be some adequate base for under- standing the \reason for being\ of the testf!., and more opportunity for students to agree or disagree with their principle. In this case, at least, lack of discussion has ·Jperated entireiy on the side of the exam- iners: we have been prone to accept obj ec- dve examinations of our college training \Vithout at all questioning the examinations. Certainly one purpose of a college education is the development of a c1·itical spirit, par- ticularly in respect to those things in life which lay a claim to being accurate formulae fo1· something or other. A SENIOR DANCE Appropriate affair with which the class of 1942 shauld conclude its active under- g•·aduate days is a senior social function. This function might well be a Senior Dance, to complete the class dance cycle which was begun in 1939 by the present seniors. The advantages cf such a danz:;e as an op· portuntiy far the senior class tO> come to- gelher for' the last time c.s an undergraduate grc;up need not be detailed. Acting Presi- dent Furlong of the s£nior class should ap- point a committee to begin planning an af· fatr of this nature.

liJt (llntttllfllttltSlli TUESDAY, JANUARY 27, 1942 FEATURE The Concordiensis Studies Questions On Curricu lunz L·ibra~y Was Badly Lighted Then. Too Meisel Reviews 8 400 Million• By SAUL MEISEL Benefits of Intensive Or Extensive Programs For Students Discussed Since the function of a college newspaper IS to evaluate the cur- ricu:um of its college. The Con- cordiensis is conducting a self- evaluating mvest1gat10n mto !Ius problem and will seel{ answers to the following questions: How well adapted is the curri- culum to offering a broad edu- cation to its students·: How wt•ll suited are the various courses to placement? Do we ha\'e adC>quate placement opportunitiPs? The present organizational cate- gory provides for four d·ivisi0ns, with various fields in each di- visions, and aschedule of requhed and elective coursPs in each di- visiOn has been estab:ished. This article will concem itself with the Social Studies De pal tment. and sub:sequenl artides will deal with the other th1 et• divisions. nanwly. Literature, Science. and Engineer- ing. The Social Studi!.'s Division pro- vides that in .their first two yea1·s men are required to tal~e four so- cia-l :stuclie:s courses f10m a group uf five, besides two years of a foreign language, a freshman cour::;e in English, a science com·se in the freshman year, and two ·electives in the sophomo1·e year. A total of ten courses is therefm·p taken by the underclassmen. Upperclassmen in this division are required to C'hoose a major. Unde1· this system, four courses, two each in the junior and senior year. must be taken m the field of the major, while four electives chosen in any other field are open to the individual student. Thus, upperclassmen take eight courses in their last two years. although they may take more. Two Theories of Stud;~: There a.re two theol'ies concera- ing the planning oi a program for undergraduates. One holds that a student should concentrate intensivdy in the field whi<:h he selects for his major. The other. and opposing themy. maintains that a student shou:d major in one field, but at the :::arne time prepa1·e an extensive, rather than an inten~-in• program, thus giving him a bl'Oadpr pPrspertiw. Proponents of the first thPon· point out that students. in go:tting the long mnge values, me likely to lose a foothold in th<>ir original field. Thus. they tPnd to go so far from thPir ba:'le of opPrations, that thPy lose sight of their orig- inal objective. On the other hand. protagoni>'ts of the lat!Pl' thPon· contend that an extensive progr~m give:\ mot'E' expression to combining training for a broad field. Men concentrat- ing intensively in. for example. advertising, accounting, m· busi- ness, will find thPmselves losing out after a certain point, fm· they will lack understanding of politi- cal problems, human natu1·e, and the world in which they live. The field of Social Studies, if the analysis of its fluid organiza- tion and curriculum is correct, allows for and envisions a broad course of study, a selection of a major, and elective courses in branches of science. English, his- tory, philosophy. The danger of losing th<> original objective as a rPsult of thP hrnail fiPld nf stui!v is precluded since the proponent~ of the extensive .program of study argue that there should not be \too much breadth so that the program is too shallow,\ nor should there be \too· much con- centration so that br.eadth is neglPcted.\ In the opinion of Social Studies professors, its cliiTiculum. a sched- ule of requirements, electives and majors provides an opportunity ·. D'ti/i,n:l.1 iJnA.iir: £A,;I· UJ~·· FO.f.JIJS. fur a broad education leading to a broad perspective which, in the final ana:ysis, is conducive to a better preparation, training, and Pqni-pmPn.t frw the future. A move in the di·rection of in- tPgrating courses of stu.dy with plaPPmPnt is in the formative stages at present. The plan is to bring lPaders in various fields to the collPge, for in.formal, socia.J gatherings to discuss problems a»pects. and orientation in fields of law, public sen:ic~. l'tC'. Further considerations of the many problems connected with the curriculum and placement will appear Friday. 0 ·successful Book Campaigna' Hayes \The Virto1 y Book Campaign has bN•n a success so far,\ Ken- neth C. Hayes, assistant librarian in charge of the d1 ive on the eampus said today. 590 books have already been col- l!.'cted on the campus with over one half of the fraternity houses yet to contl'ibute. These books have been sorted and are ready to be shipped as soon as the national leaders of the drive inform the library where to send them. About haH of the books are fiction while the other half is made up of former text books and other nun-fiction. ~1r. Hayes requested all men who had books which they c\mld give, to give them as .soon as pos:;ible. Professor V\'ebb revealed that someone had given the library copies of love stories, popular be- fore the !ast war and still carried by ·many newspa•pers in Be·t'ial furm.

It shows the !He of the people in the cities and the life of the people in the country. It introduces you to the China of the coast, and to the China of the provinces. The \F'our Huncdred Mi:lion\ is not, as one might expect, a travel- ague. A travel'ogue usually pre- sents a country in one light, that in which the to11rist and· casual visitor a·re interested, the inter- national settlements, the glamour- uus night life, etc. This picture does not pull any punches. It presents the Chinese people as they really are. Through the medium of its exceptional photog- raphy and the marvelous narra- tion of Fredericlt March. this lJiC- ture shows the best qualities· of the Chinese whi:e not omitting their faults. It shows. how the Chinese are u\urully hard working and peaceful. It depicts them as they are, or were, a•n uneducated, backward. people whose main in- terest in life was to get enough rice to feed their families. It shows them working in the rice o1· wheat fields behind their plodding oxen. It portrays the Chinese families in theil· homes, at worship and at play. It shows how a few square miles of that enormous countrr which contains one fifth of the population of the world. can contain both memories of the China of two thousand yf'ars ago and thP sign~'< of modern China. Finally. with great vigor and moving force. the \Four Hundred Mil:ion\ reveals the .fight that the New China is making to preserve its democracy and its age old traditions against the Japanese invaders.

<1 ld 65TH ANNIVERSARY GENERAL NEWS Vol. LXV. No. 34 I 'II'(·)~-I'\' Editorial 4-0133 '' .,,, f'l'~HS 4-!141 The Student Newspaper of Union College SCHEN'ECTADY, N.Y., fRIDAY, J.ANUARY 30, 1942 AP Correspondent Meter Test Proves Library From Lighting 'Adequate' To Receive Award Is Definitely Far From Concordy Given R~>bert Parker '30 For Distinguished Reporting in Europe Robert B. Parker '30, a former associate editor of The Concordi· ensis, will receive that newspaper's award for distinguished journalis· tic service tomorrow in Chapel. Mr. Parker returned from Europe last June with \hair raising stor- ies\ which he is now transcribing into a book. For the last few years he has been a toreign correspon- dent for The Associated Press, covering first the Spanish Civil War and then the second World War from behind the German lines. He was with the German armies when they swept into Po- land and will probably recount some of the experiences he had or some of the things he saw to- morrow. Before the war he was stationed ·in the Balkans for eight years and was with the Hunganan armies when they invaded Slovakia af.ter Munich. Editorial Writ.E'r For a tin1e he was an editorial \niter on the Newark Evening News, the largest newspaper in New Jersey, specializing in foreign affairs. Former staff members of The Concordiensis suggested Mr. Park- er for the award because of his AP stories filed from behind the lines. It will be given him tamar- lOW with a citation and he will respond with an address to under- graduates. Parker came to Union f.rom New- ark, New Jersey. Besides serving as associate editor of The Con- cordiensis, he acted in The Moun- tebanks for four years, was asso- ciate business manager of the 1928- 1929 Handbook, a member· of the Interfraternity Council, of The Cosmopolitan Club, of the Press Club and finally associate editor of tne 1930 Garnet. He was a member of Sigma Phi ir..tternity and of \Tiger's Eye.\ ---a---- These Were Lead Stories in First Issues There were no lead stories in that first Concordiensis titled Vol. 1 No. 1,-at least only one that would provide the present college paper with a story meriting \the number one spot.\ Under paragraphs we read that: \The Chi Psi Fraternity has with· dr&wn the charter of Union Chap- ter.

What You've Seen In The Concordy·--- News, Investigation, and Columns Past Year's Issues Have Given Complete Coverage of Events The Concordiensis' interests have ranged far and wide within the last year. The paper attempted to achieve complete news coverage and it came up, largely with the aid of outside events, with some of the biggest news stories it has ever carried. It also has followed a con- sistent edito.rial policy and has written opinions on subjects never before touched. Starting chronologically last Feb- ruary 18 the paper presented a new editorial page makeup. Scene, a column of campus events involving the small actions of people, The Corn Is Green, a record and thea- tre column, and the first of a series on \Union at Work\ graced the page. The front page carried the results of an IRC war poll con- ducted with the aid of The Con- cordiensis. A Friday column of front page editorial opinion was inaugurated and carried until everything that could be said, had been said and the column was dropped. <$>- --- -----------~ ------ Council meetings, something never attempted up to then, was started. Meetings were reported as they happened and personalities that gave meetings fire were brought into the story. ln the editorial col- umns a campaign was started to make campus government \more democratic,\ to remove the election rights from the hands of a few and give them to all, to make the stu- dent body take a greater interest in the workings of the student gov- ernment. A year long fight has finally borne fruit when the Exec- utive Committee of the Council passed a constitutional amendment that will mal{e e:ections \popular.\ The Skidmore News combined with The Concordiensis in an issue which jointly covered the combin- ation Glee Club-Choir Dance, the Student Committee .for Democracy meeting which had largely been originated and carried through ·by \f!orts of Concordy staff mem'bers. An issue later a complete and ac- curate report of the conference with some critical reporting was carried. The fact that the editor of the newspaper was one of the sponsors did not prevent the man- 1'.ging editor from criticizing much that he saw there. During their centennial weekend <Continued on Page 2) Junior Party Tomorrow Ni9ht An almost perfect attendance at the Junior ·Class Beer Party, was predicted by Garnet Key president, Richard F. Hoffman '43, today. Hoffman pointed out that more than two-thirds of the class have already purchased tickets for the stag af- fair. The affair is limited to juniors. Hoffman said that class members who have not yet obtained their tickets may do so by getting in touch with any members of the Garnet Key society. The tickets are priced at twenty-five cents. Refreshments at the party will in- clude free beer and soft drinks. Hoffman reminded class members that they should ·bring their own containers, adding that glasses would be preferable to paper cups, since \beer doesn't taste good in paper cups\. According to pla:ns released last night, Albert Ciampa, instructor in Physical Education, will be guest of honor at the party. Entertainment at the affair will be provided by members of the class. No professional talent has or will be secured. The party is scheduled to begin at 8:15 p.m. \A few surprises are in store for those who attend\ Hoffman said last night, adding that a good time was guaranted to all. ------------------------~------ • Shrouds of Popular Mystery Cut at Last Among the minor mysteries which persist on Union's campus is the exact meaning of the wot·d \Concordiensis\. That this should remain a mys- tery has seve,ral advantages. First, it lends the newspaper an aura of oriental mysticism which is perhaps unique Bcmong publica- tions. Then, too, investigation has proved that \Concordiensis\ can't be translated by a single word. Letting it remain a my::- tery would save much .time and breath. Intetests of journalistic integ- rity must prevail, however, and the explanation advanced ·by Pro- fessor George Dwight Kellogg, Chairman of the Field of Ancient Classics, shall ·be reported. \Concordiensis\, says t~he learn- ed doctor, is a Latin adjective meaning, literally, of, or pertain- ing to, Union. Used as it now is, the word is analogous to the magazine title, \New Yorker\. \The New Yorker\ connotes ref- erence to everything pertaining to Gotham; \The Concordiensis\ infers a similar function as t·e- gards Minerva's campus. And that gentlemen, is what you may tell your great-aunt, the next time she asks. UBS Begins 4-Day Schedule Monday Myron Mills '42, president of the Radio Workshop, announced yes- terday that UBS will broadcast one and one-half hours each Monday, Tuesday, WJ:dnesday, and Thurs- day, from 5:15 to 5:45 and 7:15 to 8:15, commencing Monday, Feb. 2. The Workshop is planning to in- crease the length of its weekly presentations beyond this, with em- phasis upon campus talent and original scripts. To improve reception of its pro- grams. UBS will soon change its frequency. Announcement of the change will be made before it be- comes effective. During the past two weeks mem- bers of the technical staff includ- ing Francis Czech '45, Don Brate '45, and Paul Yergin '44 have been building new equipment for the system. It is hoped that present studio and equipment deficiencies will soon be eliminated. UBS has been off the air for the past two weeks, during which time the technical improvements have been begun, and the program changes planned. Before this time, UBS operated one hour a day, three days a week. Mills repeated earlier invitations to students interested in radio to come out for work on UBS. Mills and Yergin will arrange for activ- ity .by program men and engineers, respectively. \Colonel Pickett ought to raise the cross-walk at the Blue Gate, and not compel us to swim .to ln eakfast more than two or llu·ee winters longer. \The Gymnasium looks lively about these days. Mr. Vanderveer i.o the right man in the right place surely. We suppose that it would be difficult to find another athlete ~o excellent in all branches, and at the same time so obliging and en- terprising. If he continues as well as he has done so far this trouble- some department of the college is well .provided for, and our promi- nence in collegiate athletics is guaranted. The Faculty ought to give him a little money to make needed repairs.\ Small class dances were pushed in both the news and editorial col- umns and the campaign culmin- ated in the revival of some of the dances that were almost dead. The joint Glee Club concet t with Skid- more was also pushed in both the new·s and editorial columns and ac- cording to news reports afterward turned out to be one of the \nicest\ small dances to be held on the campus. The ·practice of publishing tum- orous items in small boxes was started'. Professor Johnson's wood· en Indian was proclaimed feminine, the freshmen dance dates gave opinions of their escorts, the antics of Ronald Macomber's bed were carried in them along with a host of other items. And The Air Was Rent By 'Hosanna' As Anthony Did Reopen The Portals From the second issue. \We solemnly protest against removal of the milch kine from the College pasture. We miss the pleasant sound of the milk streaming into the washcpitchers at all times of the night, while occasionally you could distinguish the voice of the milker, reciting select passages from profane history, as a well- directed kick caused him to re- linquish his hold, and pick himself and the shattered pitcher from the lacteous ruin around him. Now it requires five able-bodied men to milk a cow properly. One creeps up and wakes the \critter from her placid slumber, and seizes her by one horn; two more come up and lay hold respectively <not re- spectively of the other horn and the caudal appendage: another pro· ceeds to the active duty of drawing off the milk, while the fifth keeps off and guards against the inter- ! uption of officious intruders. Milk- ing here requires experience and decision.\ The prom cancellation was fully covered, Union was interviewed as to its opinion and the campus opin- ion that Dorsey ought to be forgot- ten quickly ascertained. A large sub-freshman issue was put out detailing all study fields at Union, the sports picture of the col- lege, and the social opportunities. An April first \gag\ issue was published and was so successful that a -trustee of the college took it sel'ionsly and was perturbed over the possi·bility of a bar in Hale House. Through news items and editor- ials The Concordiensis pushed the construction of a campus wired wireless which became a reality this fall. Then staff members of The Concordiensis conducted pro- grams over the station. Complete dr·aft news was publish· ed, some of it only minutes old when put into print. Opportunities for officers training in all branches of the service was investigated and reported on. Complete cover age of Student By FELIX (Ed Fitz, Jr., '40) from The Concordiensis of March 26, 1940 i>-- --------- --- --- ·- And it came to pass, on the eve of the Paschal Feast, that a cer- tuin man, having spent forty days in fasting and prayer, girded his loins and went out fl'om his broth- er's house, And he went down among the multitude seeking his brethren. He took himself up into the house of Anthony, a certain publican of the tribe of Di Sienna. The people therein did know that this was the new house of their friend An- thony, who had. been delivered from fire and brimstone. For it had been, Ia. these five moons since he had had his friends in his house. And behold, this was the promised land and he was glad in his heart. Now this man was of the tribe of Beta, and he sought out his brethren. He was named Witbeck according to the laws of his people and he was a wo1thy man. And there was a Babel within, and through the confusion a voice cried out unto Anthony, \Two morP lagers, Tone!\ And the man who spake did give unto the merchan, two talents of silver. So Witbeck did hearken unto the voices in the inn, and he did find his brethren, singing \Hosanna!'' And there was joy in his face, and he did make merry. Now he was il1 company with his brother named Chappell, and they were much seen. For the multitude did cry out their names saying, \Bring us six more, Billy.\ And Witbeck did wait upon the multitude, and Chappell did share the plenty. Now there was a bar in the inn which had been ouilded in length ten cubits and in height three cubits. And on the waUs there were panels of the wood of the pine tree Behind the bar were flasks of many colors and of man.v shapes and sizes filled with t::.\ juice of the hop plant which had been gathered in from the fields. And they did cry out and make joyful noises with both psalter and harp. Yea, some of them did fall upon the ground and smite their heads. Now the people did put their pieces of silv.er into a strange de- vice which had upon it many lights, and they did gamble therewith. And there was yet another device into which they did put their coins, and music did blare fm·th therefrom as of cymbals and trumpets. And there was handwriting on the wall which did say in fiery letta•·s the magic words of \Beverwyck\ ~md \Pabst.\ And upon yet an- other wall there was hung a like- ness of a certain Custer and a tribe of wild men, who made combat and gave much slaughter. Now this likeness was the fit of Wit- beck, and he had gone as a mes- senger into the land of Milwaukee and had fetched it to the h<'use of Anthony. And the house of the chosen people, and of the Pharisees, and of those who did learn, and of the people of the city did all mag- nify the name of Anthony, and did wish him full well. Then, Witbeck arose and rent his mantle, and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground, and worshiped. Ed.

Members of these classes will be excused from their regular college assignments on these two mornings. The exam- inations will begin at 8 o'clocl• each morning and continue until noon. 65TH ANNIVERSARY GENERAL NEWS 12 Pages Price Sc Council leaders Approve Popular Vote On Chairman Executive Committee Favors Nominations By Student Petition Amendments provid~ing for a possible popular nomination of Student Council members and pop- ular election of the Chairman of the Student Council and President of the Student Body were drawn up by the executive committee of the Student Council Tuesday after- noon. Pt·esent at · the meeting were Abraham Dorsman, chairman, Jo- seph F. Furlong, John L. Grow, Robert Newton, Avery Beer and Edward C. Eustice, the secretary. Student Nominations Allowed The amendment to Article II, part 2. section B of Title Two pro- vides that the Council shall still continue to nominate members of the incoming Council. The names will probably be published in The Concordiensis for public record and. then the student body will be allowed to nominate :my addition- a~ ~ames ~or Council positions pro- Vtdmg thetr petition bears the sig- natures of fifteen per cent of the members of nominee's class. The petitions must be presented to the executive committee of the Student Council within one week of the date of Student Council nomina- tions. The petitioner's name will then be added to the ballot. The other requirements will re- main the same. They are: \The ballots presented to the respective classes of undergraduates w,ill list the nominees in alphabetical order in . two separate columns, resig- natmg fraternity and non-fraterni- ty men, each member of the class being free to choose the required number from both columns shall declare as elected, t·he' de~ig~ nated proportionate number of ~raternity and non-fraternity men m each class receiving the -greatest number of votes.\ Popular Election The popular election of the Stu- dent Body head and Council chair- man is provided for in the proposed amendment to Article V. part I, of Title Two, providing that· \Chairman of the Student Councii shall be one of seven seniors elec- ted from category B. In order to become e•ligible for the slate each candidate must make a ~hapel speech. After the candidates have made chapel speeches, their names appear on the slate, to be present- ed to the student body and voted upon. In order to become presi- dent, a candidate muR~ rPN'iVI' a simple majoritv of the ballots cast. In the event that a candidate does ~ot receive a majority on the first ballot, the three highest will appear on a second ballot; in case a majority is not reached then, a third ballot of the two highest shall be presented. Election for the office of secretary and treasurer of the Student Council shall take place in the first meeting of the Student Council in the following school year. These offices are to be filled from category B.\ Absence Rule Change An absence rule change will al- s~ be proposed. Article III, part 4, !ttl~ Two, is to be changed so that tt wtll now provide that failure of a member of the Ccuncil to attend any regular meeting will automati- cally constitute a resigntaion from ti:e Counci~, unless a member pre- vwusly nottfies and presents an ex- cuse to the chairman of the Coun- cil. No membet· may be excused from more than two meetings. Va- cancies in the Student Council may be filled by a majority vote of the Student Council. These amendments will have to be passed by a 2-3 majority of the Student Council and then by the Student Body in a Student Body meeting. Abraham B. Dorsman, chairman of the Council, praised the amend- n:'ents as bringing a Council elec- !tor: to the students, the people tt . ts supposed to represent. He sard that it will be the most im- portant bit of business' to be trans- acted at the next meeting.

Till• Staff A THANK YOU NOTE It is with much gratitude that The Con· cordiensis writes this blanket ~'Thank you note'' to all those members of the college community who have aided the staff in pre- paring its sixty-fifth anniversary celebration. We wont p-articularly to thank those who .s.ant u:s notes of congratulation, . and those mem'bers of the faculty and alumni bodies wiihou.t whose memories this special issue would never have been made possible. SIXTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY It is neither weariness noe naivete oH the part of the staff which has been causing- ghosts of The Concord'iensis past to rise these past few nights. Rather it is the in- tangible, yet tangible effect that a tradition has upon one when he begins to feel it mo1·e and more strongly. In a dynamic institution, in a day wherein the future is the most important of all things, we tend to forget or to minimize the past. But that is not always possible, partic- ularly when one is working late leafing- through yellowed pag·es of 65 years of publi- cation. Attention is inevitably drawn to pattern after pattern of lives both on The Concord- iensis and in the college-all so similar to our own-yet now but names. Reading· of the hopes, the failures, the tragedies, the successes, the joys and the sorrows which have passed on and through the pages of The Concordiensis one becomes more and more conscious that he is a cog in the slow de- velopment of a great tradition. The 65th renewal of the staff of Union's newspaper has, in this anniversary edition, attempted to present a picture of well over a half century of newspaper publication and of the college whose life The Concordiensis has reported. With a humility which is surprising to it and contrary to the average man's no- tion of a \college boy\ it takes a great joy in adding this edition to the long s~ries of Concordiensis editions which have gone be- fore, and to the long series of editions which yet 1·emain fot· the future to publish. LBRARY LIGHTING IS INADEQUATE Perennial 4Ue:stiun pu:sed fur the :students and faculty of Union was answered last night when a General Electric lightmeter showed that lighting in Nott Memorial Li- brary is inadequate accot·ding to all accepted standards. At its best, on a front row of desks, libmry lighting produces eight foot candles-authority sets fifteen foot candles as a reading minimum. Tests throughout the entire study floor of the library show that, with the possible ex- ception of the Chi Psi Alcove, eig·ht foot candles is a maximum for the library. As one moves back from the front row of desks he finds light decreasing to five, to three, to two foot candles. There are some portions with one foot candle of light. Even the Chi P:si Alcuve :showed only eight fuot candles where it was impossil.Jle to turn its lamps to full power, although the lamps at \full\ pm- duced eighteen foot candles. Only portion of the libt·ary found to be adequately lighted was the second floo1· whose shelves showed twenty to thirty foot candles. The meaning of this data is only too obvi- ous. Library lighting-, admittedly a make- :shift affair, may at one time have produced from eighteen to twenty foot candles; it certainly does not so pl'oduce at the present time. Immediate action should l.Je taken by the college, whethet· of planning change ot· of making some improvement right now. CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES-HIGHLY DESIRABLE The Executive Committee of the Student Council, in amending election provisions of the \Constitution of the Student Body\ has taken the first step toward making the most important changes Union student govern- ment has seen since 1938 when the present constitution was written. The amendments, which the Executive Committee will present to the Student Coun- cil and Student Body for approval, will re- move from student government many of the factors which have tended to draw student interest from it. Popular election of Student Body Presi- dent-Student Council Chairman is most sig- nificant of the new changes. It will enable the entire student body to select the man who will head it, rathet· than put that elec- tion in the hands of but 3 1/3 ~ of the body. It will enable the student body, as a result of chapel appearances of all candidates, to make a far better evaluation of the relative merits of the men up for office than is possible under any other system. Removal of the provision to keep elections \secret\ will mean that the student body will at last have an opportunity to see pub- lished the names and records of those men who will be presented fol' its vote. It will dispose of a system, originally intended to \stop deals\ whose only effect has been to make selective the number of groups which are able to participate in the deals. The opportunity for nomination by peti- tion from among the class which is to vote on a man will mark an immeasurably g-reat improvement over the present system in which no member of a class is able to nom- inate any of the men who will be presented to that class for vote. It is also highly advantageous to make definite the policy to be followed when a man has to be dropped from the Council for non- attendance. All in all, the Executive Committee of the Student Council has started the ball rolling toward making the most important and most prog-ressive constitutional changes Union student government has seen in some years.

(Continued from Page 1) On the mechanical side of the on the campus, The Chi Psi frater- paper, the editors redesigned the nity was honored with almost a'----- -------------- special issue of The Concordiensis. The story of the fraternity, of Philip Spencer, the careers of the undergraduates in the house, pic- tures of the founder, of his room, of the present chapter house and of the library alcove were carried. The prom issue of The Concordi- ensis, as with the Interfraternity issue of the paper, was distributed during intermission so that dancers would all receive the paper at the same time and couples could read the paper together while waiting for the orchestra to return to the floor. • The commencement issue was pointed towards the alumni and an effort was made to tell them of the needs of the college. Complete texts of class day exercises were carried so that seniors. who kept the paper, would be aided in re- membering what was said at the exe1cises marking their last day in college. Summt>r Issue A summer issue was published on August 25 and sent to all freshman and June g1·aduates in addition to the regular undergraduate body. An offer, since snapped up, was made to send The Concordiensis free of charge to an former Union stu- dents now in the armed forces of the country. This pasc fall the paper also pushed the intramural debates, football spirit, a price investigation into the amount paid by fratern- ities for food, the Interfraternity Council, the Managers' Council set up by the Intrafraternity Council to see what could be done with joint purchasing, the Intrafrater- nity Ball and organized the peti- tions to Fred Waring which cul- minated in his playing the Alma Mater during his program.

The telephone plays a vital role in army communications. So the Bell System is helping to school Signal Corps men in practically every phase of telephone construc- tion, operation and maintenance. This training job is but a small part of the tremen- dous task Bell System people are doing in this national crisis. They're setting up telephone systems for new camps, bases and factories- handling an enormous volume of calls needed to coordinate the Nation's war effort. Throughout the country, Bell System people are wholeheartedly cooperating in the drive for victory. To men and women of their high caliber, there is real satisfaction in a difficult job well done. 3 G~ Tc U1 toni, tory lege four hC'ac llll:lS rr1ar Jo c;hot play day, a ht ntay perf w char ishe yest lean SCOl' 39 r hopE l.:) n he , !eng w Can agai ing agai weei sess tran H• wee· Pnd fine1 men thar Itha in 1 only by 4 cour win L< Dut sP.as Hob gam H agai Co a line inst clos Kee two In top han p~n· pla;y Co a (

~~f QtnutnrbttUBtS· FRIDAY, JANUARY 30, 1942 The Concordiensis, As Union, '92, Saw It ------------------------- THE CONCOBDIENSIS. 4:1 E90:itori&I. IT is the duty of every college man to ::::rupport every ~ollege enter- prise, whether it be athletic or social. This is written with special refer- ence to the Junior hops. Whi1e these hops are given by the junior class they are nevertheless college dances and ought to be attended by college men. The committee do all in their po\ver to make these dances a success and should receive hearty support. But when there are only a half dozen college men present at these dances it is no wonder that the committee begin to be discour- aged and to talk of discontinuing them. The attempts whether will- ful or otherwise on the part of any- body of the students to interfere with these dances should be dis- countenanced. There are plenty of times when they may hold their meeting so as not to interfere with these dances. * * \' THE system of having marshals to lead in the college cheering, which was tried. at the last foot ball game proved a great improvement on the old ::;ystem of indiscriminate cheering. Two new arc lights are to placed on the college grounds. be The third Junior Hop was given last night in the Gymnasium. The Freshman Society, T . ..d. Y. held its initiation Friday night, Nov. 6th. Prof. James R. Thmx filled the pulpit of the First Reformed d1m·~h on Sunday, Nov. 8th. Freshmen should take notice that the fire alarm boxes are not intended to be used as mail boxes. The last league game was played with Ha1nilton, Friday, Nov. 20 . .A.n account of the game will be given in our next issue. Mosher '92, and Fields '93, were appointed at a recent college meet- ing as marshals to lead in the college cheering. The full K. A. delegation is as fol- lows : Albert S. Cox, Geo. E. Cook, Henry L. Dwight, Harold Harder, J. Henry Seburger, all of '95. The scores in the league games already played are as follows: Colgate 22, Syracuse 16. Colgate 22, Hamilton 4. Hamilton 26, Roches- ter 4.

Concordy Of Town Friend Papers Shares Pictures, Stories, Reporters With Gazette, Star Published without a break since 1877, The Concordiensis is older than both of the present town newspapers though their ante- cedents go back further than the college newspaper's. The general founding date of The Schenectady Gazette is given as 1894 while the combined Union- Star dates from 1911. However, The Evening Star was founded in 1855 and The Schenectady Daily Union 10 years later. Relations between The Concor- diensis and the town newspapers have always been good. Many members of The Concordiensis staff have joined either of the papers after graduation. The Coucordiensis is printed in the plant of The Schenectady Gazette by the job printing de- partment.

The oldest known college news- paper still publishing is The Miami Student, founded in 1827. It ·is a semi-weekly. The Middlebury Cam- pus was first published in 1830 and fhe Dartmouth, later The Daily Dartmouth, in 1839. These papers stand as pioneers in the field which saw such papers as The Amherst Student, The Wes- leyan Argus and '.t'he Colgate Mar- ron enter in 1868. Many college papers were found- ed in the '70s. They included The Rutgers Targum, 1870; The Lafay- ette, 1870: The Bowdoin Orient, 1871; The Harvard Crimson, 1873; The Rochester Campus, 1873; and The PI incetonian, 1877. Following the founding of The Concordiensis, The Yale Daily News, 1878; The Hobart Herald, 1879; The Smith College News, 1879; The Cornell Sun, 1880; The M. I. T. Tech, 1881; The Swarth- more Phoeniz, 1881; The R. P. I. Polytechnic, 1885; The Williams Record. 1887: The Hamiiton Life. 1890; The Michtgan Daily, 1890, and The Brown Daily Herald, 1894, were established.

The first issue ot the Concordy contained a some• what sophomoric editorial encour- aging participation in the new sport. \In our optmon, the article states, \football is the best spot t going, and an hour's warm work will do a man more good anti give him more genuine satisfaction than can be measured by all the gentle and inactive amusements vut together \Cheer on and .encourage your nine; applaud its good plays and do not dishearten the players by continued adverse ct·iticism,\ was the advice given by one loyal son in the Concordy columns of this er·a. Early Concordys didn't have any- thing like the exclusively spmts page of the modern age. But news of football and baseball and inter- v.·ere printed in every issue.

Edison moved to Schenectady the electrical business that has grown into the Schenectady Works of the General Electric Company. During the years the relations between General Electric and Union College have been close. Charles P. Steinmetz, world-famous General Electric engineer, served on the Union faculty. The late Edwin Wilbur Rice 1 Jr. 1 President of General Electric, served as a trustee of Union. And Union has made reciprocal contributions to General Electric progress. Among the graduates of many American colleges who now form part of the G-E personnel, the sons of Union are playing an honorable and conspicuous part in apply- ing electricity to the task of defending the American nation and the American way of life. GENERALttELECTRIC could scarcely walk contended for her honor on the football field, he, instead of giving them encourage- ment and support, would wager his money on their opponents' success, he would exult in it and gloat over the paltry sum he had won? No! It is impossible!\ But how about those guys who successfully picked Union to lose in football pools all through the fall of 1941? Praise Now Eighteen ninety-~wo marked a new departure in sports news. The Concordy deigned to praise the Univet·sity of Vermont baseball team. Before this, Union ·was al- ways \unlucky\, \outweighed\ ot· \the victim of circumstances.\ In 1892, the Concordy declared, how- ever. that \The University of Ver- mont is unquestionably the best team that Union has crossed bats with this year, 1f it is not the best college team in the state.\ (Ver- mont?) Basis for this glowing re- port was Vetmont's 6-0 victory over Union on the diamond. When many city newspapers be- gan a crusade to stam,p out the barbarous sport of football just after the turn of the century, the Concordy fought tooth and nail for its preservation. Union journalists stated that gridit·on injuries were caused by lack of training and backed their statement with ex- amples of teams which came through bitterly-fought contests without any injuries. SPORTS Just before America's entry into World War I, in 1916, the Concordi· ensis form was changed into some- thing closely resembling that used today. From that time until about five years ago important athletic events always rated the No. 1 positions on the front page, Today they are confined chiefly for the Rakf.' of convenience and make-u.p, to page 3. Contra.ry to almost universal belief, Milton M. Enzer was not the f!,·st sports editor of the Concordy. He was the second. Robert E. Woodwot th, '29, whom Milt suc- ceeded in office, was the first sportswriter honot ed with the title of editor. FirsL Columnist Enzer was, lwwever, the first sports columnist the Concordy ever boasted. His \Campus Sportlight,'' a semi-weekly feature, occupied half a page regularly. Under the Enzer regime sports news occupied the principal front page columns, topped by big, black headlines. These usually told the same story. Union teams were nearly always \stubborn and they neatly always lost!\ Like the rest of the paper, the Concordy sports news has come a long way since 1887. However, the1·e is stil room fot' a lad with originality and imagination to pat allel that of the sportswriter who fostered horse racing in the college pasture in 1908.

l10 30 a ns oy of lr- l'S II 7 Pai:ne '10, First Underg:raduate Magazine Editor Many Publications Saw Light of Day at Union During the 19th Century By CODMAN HISLOP Union's first undergraduate edi- tor was an olive skinned ycmng Byron, a society beau, and, whis-, per it softly, a \play actor!\ He hadn't wanted to come to \Dr. Nott's Seminary,\ in the fall of 1806, but his guardian thought Schenectady's isolation might cure him of the \increasing and deso- late effects of democracy.\ His name was John Howard Payne. His life here was a confused af- fair of studies under Tutor Allen, elegant letters to a legion of cor- respondents, awkward gestures of friendship toward his classmates, and bitter complainiiig over money, Money, or the hope of breeding a little of it, gave rise to Union's first student publication, which appeared early in 1807. The Pastime \On suitable encouragement,\ wrote young Payne in his most ornate style, \it is proposed to is- sue a Weekly Paper in this city to be called The Pastime. Such per- sons as are disposed to promote a project of this nature are requested to affix their names to this sub- scription. The editor will not impli- cate him<'elf in promises which he may not be able to perform; but he pledges himself that no exer- tions shall be wanting on his part to render the Pastime a spirited auxiliary to the cause of polite literature.\ The spirit embodied in the all- enclusive sweep of that last state- ment was the spirit of the paper. \The matter, original or selected,\ was \exclusively literary.\ John Howard dunned his classmates for \lubcubrations\ as he called all contributions; they were usually re- prints of ,poems and' essays, trans- lations from foreign works, and not infrequently, grandio&e poems of his own. Apparently The Pastime made money, for its editor kept up his work until 1808 when he for- swore Union and all the tryanny of his guardians for the more ro- mantic, and, for John Howard Payne, the far more lucrative life of America's leading juvenile actor. The Pastime is important to us, however, not only because of its famous editor, :but because it was our first Union College publication, probably the second undergraduate paper printed in this country, if we allow Dartmouth's claim of priority. The Floriad Three years later the Floriad flowered, with the same bouquets of poems and essays and reprinted material which had filled the pages of The Pastime. Altl!nugh we have not ,been a,ble to examine a com- plete edition of this second Union paper, we know that it withered and died with number fourteen of volume one. The ability of the undergraduate to stomach the over- powering odor of romanticism and imported culture is wonderful to contemplate as one turns these faded pages. Elegance and Refine- ment, well capitalized, absorbed a vigorous life from the ink wells of these forgotten editors. In 1823 came the Miscellaneous Cabinet, probably published by 18TH CENTURY PAPERS 6 THE CONCORDIENSJS.

Here again we need assistance if we are to succeed. We shall also endeavor to more closely unite the different departments of the Unive'rsity. We send greetings to the Law and Medical schools, and bespeak their active interest. Finally, it. is our purpose to bring to bear upon Union the ambitions and EDITORIAL. achievements and prevalent spirit of other col- leges, and to obtain for her among them the consideration which she deserves. We already foresee many difficulties to be encountered, and are conscious of the unfitness and inexperience we bring to meet them. There- fore, we feel the greater need of assistance and support from all who desire success for a live paper, devoted to Old Union's interests. We make our bow to our exchanges as we enter the circle of college publications, mod- estly, as befitting newcomers, cordially, as col- lege-men. We request from all a lenient judg- ment upon this our first issue. It is an unpleasant feature of the past that the college paper should have been discon- tinued by class dissension. In the past let it remain as a warning for the future. The classes of Seventy-nine and Eighty'now undertake to supply what has lately been the greatest defi- ciency of the University. To accomplish this, we banish all class-spirit. We desire that THE CoxcoRDIE.:\'SIS shall be a genuine represent- ative of the culture and scholarship, the man- liness and enterprise, of Union, and to this end we invoke the hearty co-operation of students, Faculty, Alumni and friends. To them we beg to offer the following pro- spectus: First, we desire to increase literary in- terest by inducing an emulation and pride in ability as writers, and in taste as readers, which shall be worthy of our institution. Touching In the January number of the \American Quarterly Review,\ under the title of \Bom- bast in Education,\ we read a criticism ·of Union College in which the statement \Vas made, that far more studies were given in the catalogue than were actually studied, and that not one graduate in ten could read the Latin in The Fi.-st Editorial Page of The Concordiensis persons close to the college, al- though apparently not an official college paper. It appeared from June 12, 1823 until January 3, 1824, twenty-six numbers in all. The Student Album Volume one, number one of The Student Album, June 15, 1827, con- tained one of the typically light tales so dear to the reader of those days of gothic literature. \Le Soli- taire\ 'begins with this happy reflection: \There is a calm un- earthly feeling that permeates the soul, at the still hour of midnight, when universal natm·e is slumber- ing in the arms of repose; when the busy and the bustling scenes of day are over; and the mind, collected within itself, feels the bright glow of intellectual joy, which is known only to the mind of the sentimental and the refined.\ Possibly the readers of The Student Album were not sufficiently senti- mental and refined; at any rate the paper expired with volume one, num,ber one. From Novem•ber, 1832, until July, 1834, Union supported a really am- bitious student publication. True, The Parthenon and Academician's Magazine still reflected that tor- turous and ghoul-haunted region of the horror story, and still smelled of the odors which rose from the iambic sweetness distilled ,by the contemporary poets, but it had an imposing make-up worthy of the best magazines of the day. In the first number the editors deplored \The Present ·State of American Literature and Our Own Pros- pects.\ \We have no acknowledged clas-s called authors,\ they sorrowed. \We hear it daily asserted that we have no national character.\ Eng- land is be1 a ted for berating Amer- ica. A challenging call is issued to all young writers to use the pages of The Parthenon to prove how wrong the calumniatot·s of this new country were. And the young writers responded. We find such stories as \The Somna,bulist and His Daughter,\ a recurring title. \D u t c h Reminiscenses,\ under which are gathered a number of flowery tales of old Schenectady and the Mohawk Valley, such poems as \The Battle of Lexing- ton\ and \How Worthless Seems Life.\ In this first volume is a stir- ring report of the arrival of the dreaded cholera in Albany, and its strangely holiday effect on Union's student body.

Ran- 1882-83 Until I received your letter I did not know, or .had forgotten that The Concordiensis was such an in- fant when I was a member of the Board. It certainly was a pallid creature. Incubators and vita:mins had yet to be discovered and it received scant nourishment from contributors either editorially or financially. It is only fair to state that the field was very restricted, the student body was small and the meager advertising was in the nature of a compliment. The budget was frequently unbalanced and deficits were no rarity. The second year I was on the Board, I took over the business management. The magazine was printed in a little job plant on the second floor of a building on State Street next to the railroad tracks. The end of that year, luckily, found dall could always be depended on in an emergency. A. B. Bishop was class poet of '85 and contributed freely. He was a poet of no mean ability. The year '84-'85 saw the resigna- tion as Pr·esident of Union of Dr. Pottet·. Judge J. S. Landon acted as president ad interim through 1R8fi. Thi~ pPriod saw. al~o thP pass- ing of Professors Price and Haw- ley. The last number of Volume VII show~ James Stoller as Pipe of Peace Orator and Dow Beek- man as Historian. J. T. Morey, '85 1886-87 My recollection of my editor-in- chlefship of The Concordiensis is that I took myself mighty seriously, thinking that its success rested on my shoulders for the time being. This led. me to lock horns with an associate editor whose copy I re- jected--he claimed the right to hav<\ his matter publis-hed and took the matter before the student ·body at a meeting in thl' Chapel and during this debate I r·esigned. Later this gentleman Pntered the min- istry and became rather noted as a preacher and lecturer--which I take it pr·oves that I used poor judgment in respecting his writings but I claim that I atoned for that when I removed myself from the !Padership and I hope history will allow my claim. \Vith best wishes for the success of Th£> Concordiensis as well as for you sevPrally and collectively, I am. Edward D. Very, '87 1887-88 I think it was in 1886 that I was Editor in Chief of The Concordien- sis. I remember it was published ten months in the year. Also as I remember it, there appeared in each issue two articles by eminent graduates, and we also had a spe- cial dt>partment for the Ubrary. It did not occur to us that The Concordiensis would ever get to the point where is would be issued twice each week and become solely a news organ. I congratulate the College, The Concordiensi-s and its editors upon the paper as· it now exists. It is a real credit to all. H. C. Mandeville, '88 1893-94 I do not know why I was honored by .being made an Editor of The Concordimsis. I do know that it was one of the highlights of my ex- periences at old Union. I have fond memories of the four years I spent in those revered gray walls and on that campus>, whereon so many men of honor and qistinction nave trod. Again and again I have lived in restrospect the days when my loyal board of editors and that good right-arm, my businC'Rs manager, H. L. Baggerly, wor·ked so faithfully and untiringly to make succes>sful our pffor·ts to maintain, if not sur- pass prPvious record..,. I am proud to have had a share in contr·ibuting to the success of The Concordiensis, one of the out- \tanding college papers past and present. My hat is off to those who have in successive years carried on. Ashley J. Braman, '94 1895-96 A congratulatory line to The Concordiensis on its sixty-fifth brrthday. If it is in order to make a sug- gestion. it would be along the fol- lowing lines: In the days of the nineties I do think the old \Con- cordy\ gave the ·boys more inti- mate hea-t t to heart, elbow to elbow news, or· I might say it was more of a \home town\ .paper than you are publishing toda-y; and in a col- lege the size of Union I believe the boys want to know what is going on personally and socially on the campus, with a bit of gossip thrown in now and then for a relish. My very best wishes to you all for continued success. Major Allan Twyford, '96. born thirty years too soon. The present paper is newsy, fresh and breezy. In my day The Concordiensis was quite dignified in size and style. Professm•s Truax and Hale were our mentors. I am grateful to have an oppor- tunity to confess that my experi- ences in reporting the news of the social in telectual and athletic ac- tivities of the college have helped much to keep my interest centered on the college. The intimate friend- ships with faculty and students are a cherished memor·y. My home has a Union College room. The walls are covered with pictur·es of the buildings of my day and of class reunions. So the col- lege is a part of my daily life and in spirit I commune frequently with the members of the faculty of that time. George C. Rowell, ''99. 1899-00 Your letter is a pleasant remind- er of my thr·ee year·s as a member of The Concordiensis staff, and, while you are good enough to in- vite reminiscenses from me as one of the editors who served during the magazine's long life of 65 years, I am loath to take advantage of the opportunity thus presented. Even if only 50'7r of those 65 editors are still living, I he·sitate to think how much space would be occupied if 30 such remmrscenses were laid end to end. Indeed, I am afraid. any of your readers who ar·e patient enough to find their way through such a mass of his- torical data might be ready to rec- ommend that the best thing that could happen to the aforesaid sur- viving editors would be to lay them end to end, and call it a day. May I, therefore, in the exercise o~ a modicum of self-t•estr·ain re- fer your readers to the pictur·e of the cditol'ial board in 1900, which I am told is the only pictm·e thus preserved ih the college archives. Why this should be, I do not know, bPcause, as I remember it, we had that picture taken by an Albany photographer in lieu of. his paying cash for his advertisement, and as a custom which we sought to in- augurate, but which our successors apparently farled to emulate. I look back upon the training I 1 eceived in a year as a Concordien- sis reporter and two years as its Editor as an experience which has been extremely valuable to me in a business career of thirty-seven- years, most of it in the field of writing. During that time I have st>en like experience on the part of many others capitalized in business and professional careers, and I can, therefore, heartily recommend such training to undergraduates who have a liking for, or skill in, such work, as an extra-curricular activi- ty of great value. My sincere congratulations to you and to those who will follow you in maintaining The Con- cordiensis in the forefront of col- IE:ge journalism. Philip P.

As we had no opportunity to correct proof, the results were appalling. Dr. Raymond promptly rut his foot down, much to my satisfaction, and the typography thereafter was subject to little criticism. The greatest trouble in my day was to get any assistance from the assistant editors. This generally re· suited in the editor writing the en- tire issue, and he always had the job of conecting proof. My only industrious assistant was John p. Guthrie and I appointed him my successot· hy the st10ng arm method o: personal disignation without consultation with the authorities who were supposed to have charge of the matter. Porter L. Merriman, '01. 1903-0<i May I extend my sincere con- gratulations to The Concordiensis on achieving its sixty-fifth birth- day. Sincerely, Archibald Rutledge, '04. 1905-06 When I was editor of the \Con- cordy\ in 1905-06, it was a weekly publication; at times, I confess, \weakly\ would also be a fair de- scription. I have been interested and pleased to watch its develop- ment since then and feel that changes made since that time have definitely improved its field of usefulness. With the growth of the college and the growing divers- ity of interests within the college, it~ more frequent publication has been we 11 justified. With ·best wishes for the con- tinued success of your Board and those who follow you. Daniel F. Imrie, '06. 1906-07 After all these yean; Concordy is sc,mewhat hazy in my memory. Of course, we took it seriously, but I doubt if anyone else did. As I look back on it now, it must have been pretty terrible at times. We were usually late in getting out the copy, which meant trips in the middle of the night from the campus down to the Gazette office, where the printing was done. Albert H. White, '07. 1907·08 I wonder whether there is any el:'sential difference between the Concordiensis of thirty years ago u nd the Concordiensis of today. In looking over my cherished files of 1907-08, I am impressed by at lE'ast one striking similarity. In a reminiscent number you are going to recall the experiences of editors of bygone years. In March, 1908, that same idea found partial ex- pression. My connection with the Concordy started in freshman days, when Dan Imrie, '05, then its editor, gave me assignments as a general re- porter. I serve.d successively under Stub Ellenwood, '06, and Bert non,\ the first number of which appeared in Novembet·, 1832. During ~ur sojourn in colleg<\ it seemed as if we had been drifting too decid- edly toward the matelialistic and away from the classical. Hordes of rnathematical-minded engineering students with their desire to meas- ure human affairs by the sliderule, T-square and theodolite had <it seemed to us) caused a general de- viation from the older pat-hs of academic higher education. For sl·me tinw, the student editors of the Conco1 dy r·epr esenting the non- engineering minority, considered cloing 'something about it. (If edi- tcrs don't do something about something they are always un- happy.) The classical tradition and the Parthenon tradition, it seemed to the editors, fitted togethet· perfectly. Why not, we argued, revive the Parthenon. ideals? Unanimously agreeing that in this way could we best save the college, an editorial appeal was published. In part, it said: \As a monument to the older period, the Parthenon was one of the most successful maga- zines of its day, and was widely read. Its successor, The Con- cordiensis, is, like the majortiy of its contemporaries, valuable only as a recm·der of passing events. Still, to some extent it b supposed to inhel'it the 'old literary spirit of the Parthenon. To create an atmosphere as near·ly like that of the early period as possible, The Con- cordiensis will appear as a Par- thenon Number on March four- teenth.\ Followed, then, an appeal to alumni, faculty member·s and undei·- graduates fot· litetary contributions. l'here rr>sponded one faculty mem- hpr·, three alumni. and five under- graduates. Most of the five contributions ft om thP undpr·graduates were wheedled, cajoled or forced from junior members of the Con cor dy staff, under pain of instant dismis- sal. One, however, desen·es men- tion, summa cum laude. It is pre- served to posterity in print over the simple initial \.C\, followed by the class numerals '\10.\ I am quite certain, however, that its author was S.am Calvert, who was later to become on<\ of Union's sons distin- guished in the ministry. This article was in the form of a rever·ie. Its author drifted back in memory .to the early days of the college under Dr·. Nott. \Then he c.wtinues: \I thought of what a pioneer Union College had been: The first college in America found- ed on a non-sectar·ian yet Christian basis, and that, too, at a. time when infidelity on the one hand and de- nominational bigotry on the other run rampant; the first college to receive a charter from the Regents of the University of New York State; the first to establish a school of science as a separate depart- ment; the first to give modern lan- guages a place in the· curriculum.

While I do not have the pleasure of reading every issue of the paper, I follow it with some regularity and take pleasure in. ob- serving the high standard of the editorial performance. The anniversa1 y is particularly interesting to myself because it re- minds me that my term in the chair happens to have occurred just twenty years ago, and that be- ginning with the fall se\\sion of col- lege that year, the paper was issued in the physical form in which it now appears. Before that, The Con- cordiensis came out in book form as a weekly, a sort of a combination news and literary magazine. Ernest W. Mandeville, '17 1917-18 When I joined its staff the Con- curdy, like the whole world, was at the birth of a new era. This was in 1914. VolcanoeR wer·e everywhere in eruption. From a little weekly mag- azine the Con em dy was presently to break forth and illuminate the campus three times a week with the make-up of a four page news- paper. It was then. under the aegis of Knight. '17, as editor, and Man- deville, '17, as business manager- two daring adventurers in journal- ism, I followed Knight as editor and Kennedy, '18, as businees man- ager. In those first days of the tri-. weekly Concordy our guiding prin- ciple was to combine the best fea- tures of classical scholarship with the fierce enterprise of a modern newspaper. We had our editorial office in Washburn Hall. Its furnishings were meagre. The typewriter was in the best tradition of a newspaper shop Pleasant Valley Meat Market House of Sunshine Meat Products 586-592 Broadway PHONE 4-3181-2-3-4 with all the loyalty and enthusiasm As nearly as I can recall, I \went· which a1 e a part of the under- \out for\ the Concordy as a fresh- .!;;;;==============0:.1 -shaky in the keys. The publish- ing house was up a rickety flight of stairs in South Centre Street. The head of this establishment was Con1eau, an obliging gentleman usu- ally frantic because Conco1dy copy was late. The type was set at a Socialist newspaper office several blocks above the Armory. I used to go there mornings to read pr·oof and a-fternoons to Comeau's to put the paper to bed. I sat up late or <:~ometimes !'use early to write edi- torials and news stories. I learned to sit in fmnt of a typewriter and stare until something finally ap- peared on the paper-a philippic, a lampoon or a pasquinade. This training, together with that I re- ceived by practical experience in making up the paper at Comeau's, was invaluable after graduation when I had to earn my salt in newspaper work. Frederick G. Bascom, '18 1921-22 I was delighted to find in your letter tangible evidence of the con- tinuing virility of the· Concord- iensis, and to leam that this fine old college publication will cele- bi ate its sixty-fifth anniversary of service today. It was my pleasure to be asso- ciated with the staff. of the Con- cordiensis both before and after the World War, and to serve as editor-in-chief in 1921-22. Lou Se- bring, now night city editor of the New York Herald Tribune, was managing editor, and Charlie Locke was business manager. The editorial office was in South College, between the chapel and the bulletin board. In these favor- able sui roundings the staff wrote copy, conveyed it to the printer downtown, and assisted in \make up\ even to the extent of placing type in the forms. Friendly relations were had with the editors of other publications and with officers of the Press Club, and through these working arrangements the various editors created, in the Concordiensis office, . an inter-publication council known : as The Ink Spot.

The editoria.l offices you now have on the :oecond floor ef Silli- man Hall and which I examined on a recent vit!it to the campus in- dicated more than a mere collegiate reproduction of the city room of a daily newspaper. It also indicated that The Concordiensis had de- Vt'loped from a campus publication for the dissemination of college news into a newspaper in its own l'ight.

The heads to go over the story are decided upon by their relative importance. The rest of the paper is dummied in and the issue editor and his assistant start writing heads.

For instance all heads start- ing with B are italic, X two line. Thus BX14 is a two line 14 point bold italic head such as is used at the top of stories set with more white space around them than usual.

11 THE COLLEGE What Union Needs The College ~~----- -------- Union College-1942 The Curriculum departments, one hundred beautiful campus. Difficulty with physical facilities is not a function of the facilities themsel·ves, it is a function of the I failure of the college to make full- est use of what it has on hand. I Everything from one of the .best , small college theatr;es to a beautiful i and spaC'i<>us garden are available, 1 but used far from capacity. Week- end migrations from the cam.pus ! would not be so lai~ge scale a move- ! ment if there were some more suc- 1 cessful attempt to demonstrate to I the college that it has a splendid I plant at hand. Union's curriculum, divided wise- ly on a divisional basis, is more 1 than adequate to the needs of the , college. hnprovement would be of . deg-ree rathet· than of k-ind; t\igi~- ! Hies might well be loosened tn cetta-in scieHce cul\l'icul~ in wf1.ich: electives are al-most tmposs1ble; 1 new co.m·ses- should be added in : literature, part<icu:larl~· in the. mod- 1 ern novel; there should be devel- opecl more incentive toward honors, , or seminar work, in the social· studies i It might well be wise, aftet· eight 1 , years of opet·ation, to recast the ' divisional system, to d-rop coutses· in which interest and training na.ve lagged and to add -othet·s for which there has been demand. Serious at- tention should be given to estab- lishment of readily accessihle op- portunities for \inter-di·visional majors\ ·particular emphasis to- day being on such fields as indus- trial management for trfrining in which Union might well be emi- nently qualified. Changes needed include, most vitally o.f all, improvement in light- ing of the library. After that comes some m01·e adeqHate means for The Faculty Union is a weU staffed institu- t-ion and the quality -of its instruc- tion has been on the upswing in the past decade. Men of high ca1i- bre have been coming here to in- struct, some to head departments and divisions; it is a young faculty and the carryovers from an earlier Union are, happily, capable , and highly qualified men, who add a de- gree o-f continuity to the academic process hel'e. The faculty is well geat·ed to close student-instructor contact al- though there have been factol's operating against fullest employ- ment of such opportunity. That a portion of it is not as much \used\ as it might be is more a function of external factors than .it is of pro- fessorial reluctance. In adviser system the faculty demonsttates one of its faults, since it has not been sufficiently aggres:sive in de- veloping the opportunities for aid to student that it .presents. Apparently desirous of modern- izing government of the college, the faculty has developed its Commit- tee on Education, whose move- ments a-re far too closely veiled ft·om the student eye. There should be est-wblished a faculty conference committee of four ·or more men to con.fer with the similar body set up by the Student Council for the purpose of discusscusing problems of mutual interest. The Campus Physical facilities a.vailaJble to Union ,students are second to none in this area, surpassed but by few institutions in the United States. There is adequacy of buildings, al- most a .plethora of scientific equipment in some of the science A footbttll spirit rally, one of tbe n11bs of tbe r!JJ!ire tradition tbat is tbe college. Union-1942-is a well staffed, intelligently administer- ed college whose student body has before it opp0rtunity amazingly divet·sified for a small institutimt ... in academic, activities, athletics and social fields . These opportunities, with but few exceptions, are supported well by physical fa- cilities and physical plant. A liberal attitude whose tone was set in the founding of a union colleg·e in 1795 is still the outstanding characteristic of Union-1942. lt pervades student-faculty relationships (Union was the only college of which we know where a stu- dent poll had effect upon the institution's decision to tele- scope its year), it is seen in \Vork done in classrooms, it is demonstrated in the policy adopted toward events in the world without our walls. Chief faults in Union-1942-flow from the same char- acteristics which make her virtues. There is failure to use the facilities available-both human and physical; there is often displayed a complete lack of imagination in fields, both athletic (in respect to schedules) and courses (in respect to new ones) ; there is need fm· development of new physical features-better library lighting, remodelling of the interior of the gymnasium, as well as for developing a student union with bowling alleys and game rooms so that non-fraternity men will have greater opportunity to become part of the col- lege. Union's assets overbalance her liabilities; unlike most col- leges she is dynamic and receptive to suggestion. Perhaps the trials through which she has gone have protected her from the academic dry rot which is now eating at the vitals so many American colleges vainly attempting to gear to the war effort. Her roots have gone too deep into American soil to fear for her future; her chief difficulty will be that of all private colleges-adjusting herself to the present emergency in a manner whereby she may retain most of her present nature. controlling evening ,park·i-ng during defense training courses, a·nd, if the money will ever be available, remodelling of the interior of the gymnasium. The Students Athletics Union 'varsity athletes play for what they can get out of the game in pleasure and physical fitness; the college is amateur both in spirit and practice. Cycles of success and failure usually find Ga1·net squads at the five hundred mark; when they drop from that point there often develop radical attempts to change the theory of athletics here until the return to winning ways dis- poses of the opposition. Equipment is satisfactory; it could be better. Schedules are wise fmm the standpoint that we never venture from our class in sports like football, and that we play Bchools of our standing in sports like basketball and baseball. Chief difiiculty with schedules is that they lack imagination; there are ob- stacles to the athletic department's scheduling colorful contests which would add to each sports season. College spirit behind athletic:> is good; this past year it became outstanding. 'Varsity sports are those for which there is de- mand; Union is somewhat unusual in its being one of the lacrosse Echools of the nation. There has never been enough demand for wrestling or boxing teams, while fencing has lived from year to year. Extremely successful is Union's system of intramural sports in which well over 60 per cent of the college participates annually. This particular branch of sport could well use an additional appropria- tion; there should be no recurrence of the need for the several teams in the basketball league to pay a portion of the gym lighting costs during the games. ~············································•••J D • Going downtown for Sunday dinner? • • • • • • i Congratulations i Dine with us and be Satisfied.

DIXON RYAN FOX Activities Union has always had too many successful activities; this paradox accounts for their alway3 being, almost by definition, understaffed. Physical facilities for activ,ties and appropriations for them are highly satisfactory. The college newspaper has one of the most fully equipped publications offices in eastern col- leges, the dramatists are well set up, the choristers have line masi- cal equipment with which to wok, although they well des:rv.: in- creased appropriation for rr.usic. Lack of competition fo~· activities posts is pat tially due the lack of prestige attached to many, in fact, most campus posts. This is w.,;l true of student government which has, up to now, operated unrter an \out of this world\ constitution which was supposed to rem,,ve politics from student government and instead virtually removed ~tu­ dent gover·nment from student in- terest. Tax Committee supei vision of student activities has .been wise and successful; it has failed in the respect that it has permitted too many activities to continue on campus, and even new ones to enter. There is need for a survey of Union activities, for appt··lfA ia- tion to be withdrawn from <hose few which no longet accomplish any objective and in which •here is no longer student interest. Fraternities A fraternity campus, Un10.1 fl'atemity-col'lege relationshi:ps have been very happy in the past decade. Frauernities have been noted for their attempts to conform with college regulations and with study policies, generally with succe:>s. Great need on the part of fra- ternities is for development of more effective inter-fraternity c)- opel at ion both fi·nancra-lly ant! in t·espect to rushing. Fraternities should makr a more determined effol'l to becon1e more a part of thP collrgl•'s aHPmpt to orient ft·eshmPn to thP campus. Neutrals Long needed by Union's neutrals, a gan1e t·oom has always beE:n !tilled by lack of action on the part of that very group. Numet·ically far sti anger than any other group on cainp)ls, the neutrals are yet un- ab:e to gain sufficient cohesion among their membership so as to bn able to stat-t the beginning toward a Union ver·sion of a Gar- field Club or a Lor J Jeff club. Too many non-fraternity men fall prey to the tendency to look upon college as a place where classrooms are attended-and that is all. Both neutrals and college suffer as a t·esult of this. The War Outstanding characteristics of Union's approach to the war effort nt·e the wisdom which the college has displayed, -and the degree of cooperation which has taken place within her walls. Making the decision to telescope her year in a fashion in which student opinion played a large por- tion, developing her three-year course with an eye to maximum accomplishment and minimum dis- location rather than to other less academic aims now abroad today. the college has set a pattern that might well be followed for the duration. Chief needs now are for increase in courses offered during the sum- mer session, for an adjunct to the Civilian Defense Committee to be formed which will perform such duties as supplying a corps of stu- dent speakers for county organiza- tions, for an attempt to develop \interdivisional majors\ whose goal i,; training for useful occupation ·but who attain the goal without sacrificing any great measure of present academic opportunity.
