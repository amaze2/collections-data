Founded at Union College illt 1877 SCHENECTADY, N. Y., FRIDAY, SEPT. 26, 1947 Price 10c: Entrants Cream of Long· Application List Garnet to Attack Larries· in Grid Opener 0----------------------------------------~----~----------------------~ Ripton Reports Class Figures; Frosh Attend Annual Camp J. Harold Ripton, Director of Admissions, has revealed the statistics on the entering class of 288 Freshmen. These freshmen represent the cream of the applicants considered, in all, more than 3200. Difficult Task The Committee on Admissions, consisting of Dmn Huntley, Messrs. Silber Bronr er, Clark, Balch, Tay- ler, Wittner, Wyatt anc' Ripton. was thus confronted with the most difficult selection job in thE' history of the college. It was necessal!' to raise the required scholastic average to 85 percent. 1950 i~ter­ views were given and 15,000 pieces of lit erature were mailed out. ?f all the applicants, only one m eleven was admitted. Scholarship was not the only factor considered, though any applicant with an av_erage under 75,% was hardly cons1dered. .Stu- dents in the upper third of the!r classes in prep or high school were seriously considered on rec?m- mendations of character, ambition, or ability. Veterans were subject to the same standard requirements of courses studied and admission;; procedure. Only in the testing pro- gram was there any variation. Ten percent of the Freshma.n Class are sons of Union alumm; 41 are relatives of Union under- graduates. Relatives of alumni or students are given preference over other applicants. Geographically the class of '51 is composed of men from thirteen states and three foreign nations. The Capitol District claims 28% of . the class, and New Jersey, Massa· . chusetts, and Connecticut leading the out-of-staters. A student each from Canada, Germany, and Iraq are the international representa· tives. Over 550 candidates for admis- sion have already sent in applica- tions for the class of 1952. \Selec- tivity\ is the key word with the Admissions committee, with prefer- ence going to those recommended by alumni and faculty. Veterans and other students are given equal consideraUon. Examinations for the Class of '52 will start in January. Not Marl•s Alone A total of 145 Freshmen attended the Freshman Camp at Pilot Knob on Lake George. The camp was (Continued on Page 4) Library Annex Work Underway Union's campus is buzzing with construction as new housing and more class buildings 'are being put up and completed to alleviate t~P crowded conditions which prevail. lit is hoped that new living quar- ters will be completed by Christ- mas. The main additions are the Mod· ern Language Building, which will be in use next week, an annex to the main library which will be built behind the Alpha. Delta Phi frat- ernity house, and a new engineer- ing building. The library annex will serve to store books overflow- ing at the main library and will also provide more reading room for students. This building will have rows of bookshelves running across it. Down each row will be two lines of desks facing toward the shelves, There will be one hundred of these desks. Continuous fluores- cent lighting will run overhead. These three buildings, which are of simUar construction, were built during the war by the government. They were dismantled and trans- ported here in sections to be put together. The library annex came from Rome Ah• Bas. lfc°C5 1 ·' Efficient Registrar Mrs. Charlotte.

GarnPt Upset Last Year Tomcrrow's opener will mark the fifteenth meeting on the gridiron betwE'en the two schools in a rival- ry which began in 1907. Last f~ll's contest, which ended in a 14-0 de- cision for the Larries, was the first meeting of the two clubs in 19 years.

Your Column Last year, we were continually disap- pointed by the lack of Letters to the Editor. Response was practically nil. This may have been due to the general apathy prevailing or perhaps to the belief that the letters might be subjected to a quick shuffle.

Heading the list I are the two backfidd Ie!iables, Hal Enstice and Ken Whalen. Finish- ing a brHliant grid c:reer at Union, the newly-married Hal has been diE:p!aying both an exceptional pass- ing arm and a shHty bit of open field run·ning. Whalen remains a triple threat in the fullback slot. Big Ken's 214 pcunC:s v.iH be used to fuH advantage when th. t neces- sary yard is r.eeded for a first down. Vylng for blo:king back berths are Chuck 'Duggan of New Britain, Connecticut and Walt So:r erville of Schenectady. Somuville, who has had no former football experience, has ·been doing a very commen- dable job to date. He'ding the wingback candidates are Charley Snow from Nantucket, Massachusetts, AI Wade of Green- wich, Connecticut, and Bob Fletch- er of Garden City, Long Island. The center berth is well filled this fall in the persons of Brud Schaf- fer of Ballston Lake, Bill Hartnett of Coral Gables, Florida, and Ed Layden of Whitehall. In the heart of the Garnet line guard candi- dates John DeB~llo of Oneida and Jack Weiss of Adams, Mass. make a smooth working combination which will be tough to beat. TO BROADCAST GAME Union's opening game against the Scarlet and Brown of St. Lawrence will be broadcast by station WGFM. This program will be picked up and rebroad- cast by WRUC. WRUC will come on the air at 1:30 ·and game time will be at 2:30. WRUC expects to broadcast all Garnet games. The tackle candidates include Bud Mills of Verona, N. J., Chuck Abba from .Schenect~dy, Tom Crone of Fayetteville, Ohio, and Bert Na- pear of Forest Hills, Long Island. Rounding out the Union line are ends Tony Coppola, Schenectady, John Brisson, White Plains, Roy Westlund, Cedarhurst, and John Chapman, Broadalbin. Chapman Only Injury Chapman is the only injury to d_ te, having broken his nose earlier in the season. Several other hope- fuls reported to Coach McLaughry at the beginning of the week. These include Josh Titus and Joe Fucigna, both members of last year's squad. Opposing the Garnet in the initial encounter are 17 letterrr. en from last season's St. Lawrence eleven. However, Coach Roy Clogston of the Larries will have to dig deep into his reserves to fill the two vaclnciee left by Jim Hefti, who s c o r e d both touchdowns against Union last year, and quarterback Oscar Cochi.
