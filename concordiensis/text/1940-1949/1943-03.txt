Well, as far as I can see, the campus chest becomes the one big solicitor who continuously approaches the stu- dents for money.

Swim Team Defeated By Rensselaer Poly The swimming group, which, un- der the tutelage of J.esse Perkin&, had been swimming regularly aN winter, climaxed its season in a meet with R. P. I. last Saturday. Howie Parsons teok the only first for the Garnet when he negotiat- ed the quarter mile in faster time than any Errginee1· was able to. Joern Schmey, who was expected to win the breast stro]{e, was, like'. other Union swimmers, bothered by the fact that the Rensselaer pool is heated while the Union pool is not, and could do no ·better than· second.

CHt Sk1dmore ljps,Low It should be pointed• out that any connection between this article and a recent talk given by Mr. Herbert Houghton in Memoria!. Chapel is not quite coincidental. Since it_ can- not be definitely established which is the more effective authority on such delicate subjects, we wish to supplement Mr. Houghton's views with: those of a coHeague in the art. This article might also serve to clear up certain doubts which :may have arisen from the afore- mentioned talk by Mr.Houghton. An Old Union Custom Friend Emily starts on a reassur- ing note: \To the mothers who are inclined to fear that it cannot be pr<Jper for their daughters to stay in fraternity houses, it should be explained: House-Party Week has been an accepted custom for gener- ations in colleges and fraternities that have always upheld highest moral standards.

Graduation Issue Ends Publication Of \Concordiensis' The future ·of Union College pub- lications was discussed at the reg- ular March meeting of the Under- graduate Pu·blications Board hdd in the Administration Building yesterday. The Board voted to suspend the \Concordiensis probably for the duration of the war, after the con- clusion of the present term. This action was taken after it was de- cided that there would be :insuffi- cient funds and almost no staff after the coming commencement. The fate of the other publications was not decided at yesterday's meeting. At this meeting, also, David Platzer, '45, was formally elected .business manager of the \Concor- diensis\ to succeed 1farvin Cramer, '44 who has left school. Platzer had already assumed the duties of acting business manager as of the date of Cramer's leaving. Robert Cartoon, '46 and Arthur Shapera, '46, were elected to the business staff of the paper to assist Platzer.

StiH, we're all glad to be in service.

'YOU'RE ON THE AIR!' with all sincerity that all the lies which Mussolini and Hitler have preached are true. Some of the Italians don't even remember any- thing before Il Duce. They've been convinced that they are the down- trodden peoples of the earth and that ruthlessness and barbarism is their only way to salvation. They've been taught and they practice race prejudice. And they ve been fed a steady diet of hate and intolerance. Actually their sense of values has been so altered that human life and suffering other than that of their own peoples means nothing to them. They've lost their ability to think in their own way.

For the past three ye~u·s, r niun College has sponsol'ed various sei·ies of fifteen- minute talks on <:>tntion WGY by memi.Jers of the faculty. \\'e won't a1·gue here the value of such series as ••Learning and the Wal'\ \The American Faith\ o1· \The In- tellectual Adventure\. Whether or not the~· do any good, the~- certainly can't do much ham1-so long as they remain on WGY. What we do not approve is the p1·esence of the identical talks in :\lemol'ial Chapel on week-day mornings. This usc of Dail~· A~~emlJly as a rehearsal lwll fo1· \YGY, or the use of \VGY as an encore studio for Daily Assembly, depending- on the point of Perhaps the problem could be solved by requiring- the faculty speakers to write en- til'ely different talks for WGY and for the assembly. That seems like a lot of work; instead, we suggest that, the next time Union arranges a series of WGY talks and a se1·ies of faculty assembly talks, they be given by separate groups of men. The same material might be covered, but it seems obvious to us that the student audience would benefit more from speeches prepared v;:ith their tastes in mind. A liberal arts college is supposed to give its students a taste of knowledge in many fields. A carefully prepm·ed 5eries of as-1 sembly talks, aimed directly at the students, I \vould do much to accomplish that end.

Features U~niont Depot Fives ·Ofiicers' Quintet to Meet Dutchmen in Cage Contest At Alumni Gym on Saturday Union College's varsity quintet wiH meet a five composed of of- ficers of the South Schenectady Army Depot at Alumni Gym Sat- urday night as the main feature of a sports program for the bene- fit of the Red Cross war f.und. The program is scheduled to begin at 8:00, and should be over :by 10:00. The Garnet starting team will probably be composed of the usual five, namely: Johnny Clowe and Hal Enstice at forwards, Bob Bartlett at center, and BiN G'Neill and Reg- gie Carroll at the guard spots. The Depot quint will include former stars from several colleges. Lieuten- ant Walt Raider, a Hamilton Grad- uate will be renewing an old ac- quaintanceship with Union teams. Lieutenant Dave Reed, who for- merly played with the high-scoring Rhode Island State machine, is an- other of the Depot cagers who ie likely to cause trouble for the Dutchmen. Sbould Be Close Contest The Garnet five will enjoy one particular advantage as they are playing on their home court where they have not lost since the open- ing game of the season against Middlebury. However, Coac·h Seme- rad's charges have not had much formal practice since the regular schedule was terminated two weeks ago, and in addition have had a strenuous weekend which no doubt has taken its effect physically. Nevertheless, ·Coach Bob Murray and his officers will have a tough game on their hands when they invade the Union stronghold, and have accordingly practiced diligent- ly t'his week. The Depot team has not had the benefit of a regular season, and probably will not have had the chance to develop as much teamwork as the Dutchmen have during their ten game schedule. B()xing, Wrestlin);', Fencing Bouts The evening's program will be- gin with exhibition boxing and wrestling matches. An exhibition fencing match between Lieutenant Francis L. Butt, who formerly stal'l'ed for Johns Hopkins team, and the local Y. M. C. A fencing instructor is another of the many features of the varied program. Also included on the program is an interview of Harold Henessey, Nott Terrace graduate who recently returned from active duty with the American field service in North Africa, by Carroll <Pink) Gard- ner.

4 d at hip to ~avy con- pref- the ~ular is ted duty s FIN•A:L EXAM SCHEDULE PAGE 5 College W·el:comes 100 Sub-Fresh:m:en · In 3-Day Prog!r am Fraternity Sing, Cinema, intramural Bouts Feature Entertainment for Guests Nearly 100 prospective c01lege students are being welcomed to the coUege campus t0night as Union's annual Sub - Ft•eshman Week-end gets under way with din· ners at the various fraternities. Although the limitations on tra-. vel and the probable reduction in civilian enrollment have cut the' numbers of the guests considerably, this Sub-Freshman Week-end offers one of the most complete programs of entertainment ever arranged for the high school and preparatory scho0l men. Mostly June Entrants In •contrast to the usual situation at the spring week-end for sub· freshmen, viortualiy all of the guests are .expected to entel\ some college in June, rather than Sep- tember. About half of the men were in- vited by the members of the vari- ous fratern•ities, whHe the rest have answered direct invitations from the college admissions office. Besides the out-of-town men who have to be invited, a general invi-, tation has ·been extended to stu- dents in the Schenectady hig-h schools to attend the various func- tions. during the week-end. Following the dinners at ·the fra- ternities tonight, most of the sub- freshmen are ~pected to attend the Interfraternity Sing, an inno- Vi!-tion on the program .fot· the ...;;eek-end. There they wiU be wel- comed by President Fox and will have an opportunity to witness what is expected to be the college's first Interfraternity Sing in which all houses compete. Others of the guests may attend the Mounte-. ·banks' performance of \Twelfth Night.\ Glee Club in Chapel All classes will be opened to the sub-freshmen tomorrow morning, and a special Daily Assembly pro- gram featuring a brief recital by the college glee club has been ar- ranged for the ()hapel period. Spe· cia! laboratory exhibits will be available to the prospective stu· dents after Daily Assembly, as well as the 10:25 and 11:25 classes. To replace the visit to the Gener· a! Electric company plant, custom- ary for Saturday afternoon in for· mer years, but now unavailable for the duration, Professor E. S. C. Smith has arranged for a showing of \Algiers\ in the Old Chapel. Probably the most popular fea· ture of the week-end's program will be -the intramural boxing and wrestling matches scheduled .for .Saturday evening. All of tbe bouts will represent the final con· tests in their divisions. \Twelfth Night\ will again be offered on Saturday evening. Sunday's program includes the regular Sunday chapel service, din- ner at the various fraternities, and the organ recital by Dr. Elmer A. Tidmarsh in Memorial Chapel at 4:00 p.m. Guests for the weekend will in· elude the following men: Robert W. Alexander, North Creek, N.Y.; Frank W. Blanchard, Jr., Albany,. New York; Walter N. Catino, Bloomfield, N. J.; W. Peter Cockshott, Summit, N. J. Frederick P. Cole, Rockville Centre, N.Y.; Raymond N. Collins, Pelham, N.Y.; David C.

Mr. Grew·s talk will be the main item on the .program for the 148th annual cornmencement exercises, which will see the comparatively few remammg members of the class of 1943 graduated from the college . When it became the lot of Joseph C. Grew to be the American repre- sentative in Japan when that coun- try decla1·ed war on us in 1941, it was not the first time that he had been in such a: situation. In 1917 he was the counselor and charge d'affaire al the United States Em- bassy in Vienna when this countt·y broke off relations there as she entered the war against Germany. This time however it was the Jaopanese that were doing the breaking. .Ambassador Grew ·had to wait six long months before he could reaeh home to tell the Ameri- can people of those last months ·be- fore war and to give them a pic- ture of the Japanese as they would appear as an enemy. :Began ·Ca.reer in 1904 Born in Boston ln 1880 and edu- cated at G!\oton and Harvard, Grew is noted for the fact that he is one of the few men who has risen to ·be an ambassador after having passed upwards through all the lower ranks of the diplomatic service. Although not unusual in the services of European nations, such a rise as Grew's is outstand- ing when compared with American precedent. When Joseph Clark Grew went on a Tig-er hunt in China in 1904, he probably didn't expect that it was a prelude to a long career of diplomatic experience that would lead to his being called the num- Fox said, \that while the navy makes its inspections, the college administration is not forgetting that it will have a number of civil- ian students to house, too.

We cannot help but envy them their opportunity to begin study at Union in a few months, and it seems fitting that we should attempt, in this issue of The Concoediensis, to tell them a little about what they will find he1·e. Not all have availed themselves of their col- From Mort :Robbins, soml'Wh!:'l'l' on tlu• British Isles. action, I'll be happy for a while.' t~e open and discHssed. m places Believe me, it's harder to get in.to ~~k~ our Sunday ChaJ?el m as real- the combat zone than to stay out' Istlc a way as poss1·b!e. I believe ;\lost students, looking back on their own expel'ience as freshmen, cannot deny that they would enjoy beginning college an over again. True, the next freshman cl~1ss will see a vastly different Union College from the one that gTeeted most of the present student bod~·. but we have the definite assurance of those in cha1·ge that a civilian college will continue here as long as there are students to take its com·ses. While that civilian col- lege continues, its students will find that much that has characterized Union in the past will remain. In spite of the wm· and the presence of a unit from the armed forces, part ·of Union will continue, as a liberal at'ts college, to offe1· umestricted teaching in a wide variety of fields. As that instruction continues, so, too, will continue the spirit of this institu- tion that has made it mean ::;o much to its many sons in the past 148 years. To most of these men, Union has meant an opportunity to absorb as much knowledge as they felt in- clined to secure, a chance to gain practical experience in many fields through val'ied extra-curriculm· activities, and a place to meet informally and easily a group of exper- ienced faculty men, some of whom have been famous, many of \<:hom are extremely able. lege's opportunities; perhaps no one of us feels that he has gai11ed all the benefits available but those whG have put forth the greatest effort to grow in and with Union certainly feel that thei·r labor has been t'e- paid. This college has never been famous for a large group of students whose cat·eet·s were obtained without effort on their own part. Perhaps too many have had to take advan- tage of Schenectady's many chances for out- side employment; in any case, the men who have achieved their degrees in the face of great difficulties are numerous. New prob- lems will be added to the traditional diffi- culties of time and money for the next class that enters Union, but '\\'e know this group wiH meet them successfully, just as have so many Union men in the past met their prob- lems well. For those members of this group who worry lest their best place at this time be with the armed forces, we would say this: never, in more than two years of continual correspondence and conversation with ser- vicemen, have we found one who resented the presence in college of any qualified stu- dent. They recognize, as do man;v who are in authority, the acute need for trained men in all fields, now, and after the war. This is the same campus, full of rain, eager hosts and an ambitious program of entertain- ment, that greeted us as we made our way here four years ago. The college has changed in many ways since then, but the essential characteristics, as well as the rain, the hosts, and the entertainment, still remain. A CERTAIN RE-EMPHASIS There are two points in this story on the fit·st page of this issue concerning· the navy's inspection which seem to us to need re-em- phasis and special attention. The first of these concerns the fact that no valid deductions can or should be made from the visit by the navy men here this week. Although almost everyone concerned with the college feels considerable confidence that the navy will see fit to esta:blish some sort ·of training base here, no one can pos- sibly know \\'ith any accuracy what sort of a unit will be established, how large it will be, or how long its members will spend at the college. In this same connection, it must be re- emphasized that the visits paid to various fraternity houses do not indicate that the houses visited will necessarily be used to house navy men. Even if the houses are found satisfactory and contracts are offered, the option to decide upon the future of its property still remains with the individual houses. Some may be ruble to keep on a civilian basis. In no case will fraternities be commandeet·ed. Those who are not offered contracts will be able to accommodate the rest of the civilian college. That brings up the second point, which concerns the continuance of the civilian col- lege. We have already emphasized the fact that the college will continue to offer civil- ian courses while students remain to take them. What we should like to point out here is that no matter how large a navy unit might be assigned to this college, those who wish to remain as civilians need have no fear of lacking adequate facilities. We are as certain as one can be about anything today that the administration will be able to ac- commodate all of them efficiently.

He held this office until February, 1932 Vill en he was appointed our ambassador to Japan, a position he held for almost the next ten years. It was while he was at the Japa- nese post that Grew did his most notable service for the United :States. During the whole period of his residence in Tokyo, 'Grew work- ed unceasingly to promote a genu- ine friendship between the United :States and Japan. In this regard, he addressed his efforts mainly tov.>ar·d those Japanese who had their interest in international trade and hence in peace. Grew was deeply interested in the Japanese as a people and gained the high personal regard of countless Japa- nese. One day in 1934 when Grew was walking in one of the Imperial palaces in Toltyo, his dog. Samba, who was with him skidded and fell thirty feet into the moat of the old cast!e. Sambo was rescued without harm by several persons 1 nearby. Shortly afterwards, Grew had an audience with the Emper- or. As usual It was a highly formal affair g-overned entirely by prece- dent and l'itual where the Emperor spoke only Japanese. As Grew was bowing out, however, at the close of the ceremony, the Emperor sud- denly aslred him in perfect English, \How is Sambo ?\ This is one of the very few informal remarks ever made by a Ja·panese Emperor in public. --. --o,--- UCRS Broadcasts Fight ?'he lJnion College Radio Society Will ·b1·oadcast over its station.

They are presented in the belief that some of the college's sub-freshman guests may wish to take copies of this paper away with them, the better to recall the campus they are visiting this week. Admittedly, most of these views show the campus at a different season from that in which its week- end guests are welcomed. This is the campus at its best, pictured a:s it will appear once more with the coming of spring. In the upper left hand corner is a picture of the college library, dedicated to Eliphalet Nott, the president who first built Union college to a position of prominence in the middle nineteenth century. To the right of the library is a picture of the Idol, traditional scene of underclass scraps fo1· many yea1·s. Although the paint- fights have lost much of their vio- lence in recent years, the Idol is still the center of college spirit for Union men, as was indicated ear- lier this year when they protested violently against a suggestion to move it from its present location. Directly below the Idol is the main gate to Jackson's Gardens, for years the favorite campus spot during Junior Prom week-ends and long the scene of class day. The gardens were long the pet of Cap- tain Isaac Jacl,son. instructor herP about a century ago. In the lower right-hand corner i>\ thP Alumni rrsmm1~ium, ht>ad- quarters for varsity athletics and the extensive intt am ural program. Directly below is an aerial view of the campus, to the left of which is a picture of the Memorial Cha- pel, built in memory of the Union College men who gave their lives in the fil·st World War. The picture directly to the left of this story was taken of a room arranged to look as nearly as pos- sible lil';e the room of a typical unde! graduate a little more than a hundred years ago. The original dormitory buildings, recently reno- vated, still remain. 5 All t! 0 il Stu S< tl 0 S< g, 'ii'H 9 Alt Bio Bui ChE Gee Ge1 Ph1 Ph~ Ps, Soc Soc Spa 2 ApJ F.

TESTING BACK when Herbert Hoover was i11 the White House, four specime11 rods of an alloy steel used in steam tur- bines were imprisoned in a thermo- statically controlled electric furnace at one of the G-E laboratories. The purpose was to study the effect on the metal of prolonged high tem- rerature and stress, in order to improve the design of the turbines. Usually these \creep\ tests are run for only 1000 to 3000 hours, but the engineers never took these four speci~ mens out of the furnace until the other day-thus obtaining what they belieYe to be the first data based on a 100,000- hour test. In the event of trouble during the test, a red light would flash and a bell would ring, summoning a watchman who could get one of the engineers out of bed to remedy the situation.
