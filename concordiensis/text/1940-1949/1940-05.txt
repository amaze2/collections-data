Irving Langmuir associate di- rector of the General Elcctl'ic Com- pany resea·rch laboratorie::;, addJess- ed the ;;tudent body at the daily as- sembly on Thursday morning. The honorary fellow advocated the sub- stitution ot moraHt:,:, which he de- fended a::; \the experience o.f a race\ for the \cause and effect\ method of analyz'ing and describing events. Tracing the acceptance of cause and effect as a scientific explana- tion Dr. Langmuir said that about a c~nt ury ago scientists d'iscovered natur·al laws of cause and effect and since then the~· have ·been studying individual atomic phenom- ena whkh is a new development in :>cience. Cause and effect, the 1932 Nobel prize winner in chemistry stated, became popular as a scientific method in the law courts where it was used as a means to determine between right and wrong, guilty and not guilty. The public wanted a decision one way or another and this method was used to aid the de- cision, Dr. Langmuir stated as he pointed out the great effect in r e- cent years of science upon the pub- lic mind, particularly \the mass of ·people.\ The speaker pointed out the im- por,tance of individual events which mar have verr small beginnings and stated that \humans 'have as much effect on the causation of events as any single fa.ctor,\ and this point is ignored in the scien- tific method of cause and effect. \Science itself is finding individ- ual events which overshadow aver· age events,\ the eminent scientist continued, \it was· not non-scientific to use individual events in the ex· planation of natural phenomena.\ In conclusion, Dr. Langmuir said \Instead of using science as a basis why not use morality-the experi- ence of a race-the question of right and wrong in describing phe- nomena.'' Wednesday afternoon, Dr. Lang- muir, addressed the members o.f the faculty on some interesting phe- nomena concerned with the weather. In the discussion he stressed the importance o.f various wind currents in the prediction of weather. The knowledge of wind conditions for use in glider soaring was also ex.plained to the gathering. The greatest number of student leaders will be from the class of '43. They are: Lyle Dean, Jr,, Paul R. Dwye1, Frank, W. England, Norman w. Fox, Robert E. Horton, Wallace H. Macmillian, Jr., Paul B.

Fox Announces New Rating Plan Prospective Employers To Obtain Information On Men's Cooperation To the Editor of the Concord·iensis: Emplo~ ers looking over gradu- ating Seniors, and admiosions and scholarship committeeo in graduate and ptofes:oional schools, during the past few ~ears have .been more and more inquisitive about every part of a man's record. So far a~ I can see they have not r·elaxed. their primary intere~t in his academic performance. which roughly indi- cate~ how much he knows and also. in eome degree, the strength and steadiness of his will-power. The:,: still select somewhat upon appear- ance and manner ae they come out in the interview. But their ·blanks and other inquiries now insist on definite information a::; to the man':: record in what may >broadly be termed human relations. One definite question under this head is as to the man's record in cooperation. This has to rest on subjective judgment, but it certa·in- ly is inadequate to rely only on the judgment of the officers in om building, even if ~upplemented by opinion of a few professors. We should have the testimony of those who have lived with the man. After due consideration the Col- lege has ·decided to take a \cooper- ation rating\ on each dormitory man as judged periodically by the board of proctors. But whatever advantage there is in this sc·heme might well be applied to the other residential relationship of the cam- pus, that of the fraternities. At a meeting of the Interfraternity Council and the Graduate Coun- selors of the fraternities, held in Hale House, April 30th, the College was advised to ask a similar \co- operation rating\ from each frater- nity on each man to be made up b~ a committee in the fraternity. The first repm t is to be made on Fe·b- ruary 15th next. A similar general meeting will then decide whether the ex·pe1·ience with the plan has been such that the data obtained ought to be used in dealing with outside inquiries. The judgment is to be formed purely on ~ man'!' citizen,;hip in the . dormitory or in the fraternity. Someone may say that the Col- lege is becoming too \nosey.\ May I repeat that it is the world :that is nosey. All of us have always had to face the judgment of public opin- ion, but these things seem to be in- creasingly sized up on a !'tatistical basis, if we permit a generous lati- tude in the use of that word sta- tistical. College is not the only place where these r·atings are to be met. One encounters them in large and well organized businee:;es, like the Gene1·al Electric Company, all along the line and year after year. In calling attention to t.heir im- portance I do not want to over- weight them. Any semi,ble em- ployer or admissions committee knows that a man can be a very good chemist, or economist or an:,:- thing else and not be a good fra- ternity man, and the other way around. But, apparently, they do (Continued on Page 2) Mountebanks Act Moliere Com~dy· Tonight At 8:15 Tickets Now On Sale For Prom Presentation · At News Bureau Office MolieJ·e·, \The Doctor In Spite of Him.,;elf' will trod the boards in, tne MountebanKs Theatr·e tonight when t11e cut tal!l dses pr·omptly at X.15 o clock.

McCarty Thomas O'Connor Friday, May 3, 1940 IN SPITE OF HIMSELF In 1804 the fil'st (as fal' as can be ascel'tained) Union dra- matic organization p1·ese1ited ib fi1·st all-student p1·oduction, \A Bold Stroke for a Wife\. Since that time Dutchmen have witnessed the thespian efforts of thei1· fellow students Llll- ceasing-ly for 136 years. Far flung praise has been fol' some. embmTassment and ridicule for others, but for all. real en- joyment and sincere effort. Tonight the :.\Iountebankf!l will raise the cm·tain on their third production of the ;year when Moliere's \The Doctor in Spite of Himself\ is presented in their theater in Washburn Hall. \Vhether this effort will be praised or ridiculed remains to be seen, but we have much in mind pointing- to exaltation and approval of tonig-ht's comedy. In choosing a :\Ioliere comecly a!\ the Prom 11ight procluc- tion, the :i\Iountebanks revive a custom which was prevalent at Union mol'e than a half a century ag-o, interrupted by the outbreak of the Civil Wm·; in choosing Edwal'd L. Canoll to direct the production, the Mountebanks pay fitting tribute to the man undet· whose direction the dramatic organization at Union has grown to a place of distinction since 1928; and in choosing to present \The Doctor in Spite of Himself\ in its entirety the Mountebanks insul'e theit· audience a fast mov- ing, highly interesting 90 minutes of entertainment. Moliere's farce-comedy, filled with good-natured satire and a seventeenth century frankness so often \censored\ in ama- tur productions, is an excellent choice for a campus produc- tion. Its amusing, somewhat spicy lines, leading to risque scenes characteristic of the great French dramatist, will amuse even the most \doubting- Dutchman\. Mountebanks pt·oductions of the past have been recom- mended fot· any number of reasons, ranging from superb act- ing to the magnificance of the setting and design. We recom- mend \The Doctor in Spite of Himself\ for these and one other reason-downright enjoyment and fun. OUR COLLEGIATE CONTEMPORARIES The health of students of MASSACHUSETTS STATE COLLEGE has improved considerably in the past year acc<mling to a state- ment made by the oollege physician. \Our students are slowly com- ing to the idea of having their illnesses treated in an early s1age\ the doctor explained aftet• making an UIJ to the minute survey.

In answer to questions asl•ing what posi- tion they would take in. event of different kinds of war, the 164 freshmen taking the poll displayed! so sti•ong a feeling of isolation- Ism that only 58 voted to give their unqualified support to any war In which the United States might become Involved. * A school for training in the latest methods of sewage treatment was started two weel.s ago at RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE with the co-operation of the State Department of llealth, the State Department of Education and the New York State Sewage Works Association.

THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, MAY 3, 1940 I Cha:irman P·rai·ses Prom Comm.ittee Cites Smooth Working Of Junior Prom Plan Recently Inaugurated KennNh MacKenzie, the cha·ir- man of the class of 1941 Junior Pt·om, told the students assembled · in ME.'morial Chapel for the Wed- nesday's daily assembly that \l feel that a .great deal of gratitude is due the Student Council for the inaug- umtion of the Prom Committee ar- r·angement that is in use this year.\ The chairman outlined the plan as being a:; follows: 1. Every ftaternity has one repre-. sentative, and the Neutrals have six representatives on the Prom Committee. 2. The Student Council and the offi'cers of the Junior Class choose seven of the';)e men, one as the Chairman, to act as the executive committee and to ar- range fat· Decorations, Band, Publicity, Printing, Chaperones and Pati·on>, Programs and Gymnasium preparations. 3. The elltire committee t23 men) is to act on the ticket sales committee, with the chairman as treasurer. ·'Thus the duties of the Prom Committee ate divided among many men, eliminating the possibility of a slip-up, ohould every item be handled by only a few, MacKenzie continued, ,;tating that this sort of representation makes fot· harmony of action.\ He offered the spontan- eous reaction to the canvass of the campus for pledges a» being indica- tive of this fact. MacKenzie lauded the members of his committee for their cooper- ation in the sale of tickets. He pwved the statement by saying, \that ah-eady -ten days before the Prom, they have sold more tickets than have ever before been sold at a Union Pl'om. even up to the last minute of the dance itself.\ The address was concluded with an outline of the advents scheduled for the entire Junior Prom week- end, including the various sports events, fraternity dances, Mounte- banks play and the Julius Huehn concert. -· --0 --· PLEDGE NOTICES OALENDAR Today 8:15 p, m. - Mountebanks Per- formance of \The Doctor in Spite of Himself.\ 8:30 p. m.-Schubert .club Con- cert in Memoria.!

Varsity Baseball Art Lawrence left with the var- sity baseball club yesterday after- noon for a two-day swing through Pennsylvania to meet Haverford and Swarthmore on thelr horr.e grounds. The Dutchmen are out for their first win and after thl:'ir per- formance against Symcuse, Law- rence is looking forward to the trip with a bit of optimism, \es- pecially if they hit as they did on Wednesday.\ Chet Robinson will receive the m<lund assigumcnt against Haverford on Friuay and \Swede\ Hanson will pitch at Swarthmore. AI cut the middle finger on his right hand on Wed- nesday afternoon and is not ex- pected to be able to pitch. Law- rence announced that the only change in the lineup will be Rasso in left field in place of Raifstanger, who is not eligible for away games. Haverford has a weak and in- experienced ball te:im thi:> year and tiO far has had little su~ces:; in their schedule, losing all of its games on their spring trip as wei! as tills with Drexel and Susquehanna. Swarthmore has h<:.d a mor0 suc- cessful season and may provid<l more than enough opposition to the Dutrhmen. So far thl! Little Quak- ers have downed Wesleyan, Muhlen- burg and Hami!t% ::lnd lost to Blue Ridge, Colgate anu Delaware. Freshman Baseball Coach Ciampa's yearling base- ball team open their season to- morrow at 4:30 on Alexander. Field when they meet the Tt oy High nine. This is the first game for the freshmen as the initial con- test on the schedule was canceHed at the tequest of Amstet·dam High School. Ciampa announced that the bat- tery for the game will be Bill Cum- mings doing. the pitching and Fred Smith 01· Toby Champlin on the receiving end. The infield will be Don Quigley at first, Hank Wysocki at the kel:;tone sack and Stan Steingut at third. Either Salomone or Carnwright will get the nod for the shortstop post. In the outfield Ciamapa will start Doug Slinger- land, Jones and Kaufman. Varsity Track The varsity track team makes it:; second start of the season Saturday when they meet the trackmen of Hamilton at Clinton. After losing to Vermont last week the squad should be in fine shape to chalk up a victory against the Hamilton squad. As far as practice is con- cerned the Union men have the edge. Hamilton has been forced to train indoors because of the bad weathel'. According to reports the vaulters and field men have suf- fet·ed most from the handicap. If this report is true the Dutchmen should come out ahead. Tbe Union entries for Saturday will be, in the 100 yard dash, Ericson, Enstice and Baas; 220, Ericson, Muther and Ehrcke; 440, Bothwell and Muther; 880, man, Johnson, Robinson and Hast- ings; mile, Hastings, Maines and Varsity Lacrosse Collins; 2 mile, Melewicz and Bl . 11 Conly; high hurdles, Plummer, Mar- Harkness' stickmen will try rison, Bothwell and Daly; low bur- to bring their record for the seas >n dies, Bothwell and Plummer; shot, up to .500 on Saturday afternoon Bodenstab, Ciesinski, Shaw and when they face the Stevens Tech b c 1 L'b F' ld 11 D t h Goldblatt; discuR, Bobt'nsta , a- ten on 1 f rath·y, te · 1 h Jb ut c f- Jan and Shaw; javelin, Brittin. men are res • rom P: r 1·ou '' 1 K.... . d M .. , . h · •t · , M .

No guns rumbled nearer than the Sylt. The good burghers of Oslo were safe in their beds. ... At half past midnight the city heard a noise like a thousand angry motorists stalled in a traffic jam-the raucous bel- lowing of air raid sirens. At 7:45 the next morning, Stowe and his colleagues, Edmund Stevens of the Christian Science Monitor and Warren Irvin of N. B. C., watched Nazi bombers roar over the trim Norwegian housetops -not in sky-darkening swarms, but by twos and threes. No bombs fell. Scarcely a shot was fired. ... By 2 in the afternoon, the incredible had happened. The tramp of Nazi boots was echoing through Oslo streets. The conquerors, marching by threes, made the thin gray column look longer. People gaped like yokels on the Fourth of july at the spectacle of 1500 Germans taking possession of a city of 256,000-a handful of invaders so sure of easy conquest that they had a brass band! Was this an instance of awesome Nazi might? ... of a little neutral's pathetic un- preparedness?

A story of a free people infested through and through with spies, who could never have crept into key positions with· out the aid of traitors. .... Chauffeured by a fair compatriot with a smiling comeback to German gallantries, Stowe escaped to Stockholm and gave the world the news of Norway's gigantic in- side job.

The dinn('t', hPld in the cor- POl at ion's exhibit at thP NPw York World's Fair. had as its theme \Opp01·tunity for Youth in Building the World of Tomor- row.\ As a part of the evening's pro- gt am a discussion on the order of \Information Please\ was held. Questions submitted by the students were discussed extem- pmaneously by D:r. Karl T. Compton. president of M.I.T.; Dr. Etnest M. Hopkins, pre:;i- dent of Dartmouth College; Gen- eral Hugh S. Johnson, columnist and former N.R.A. administra- tor; and Charles F. Kettering, vice-president of General Mo- tors.

Cunningham, dean of the Albany Medical College, will address the freshman and junior pre-medical students of the college in the Old Chapel tonight at 7:30, it was announced- yesterday by Dr Leonard B. Clark, chairman of the Pre-Medic Committee of the fac- ulty. Dean Cunningham will speak on the subject of \Aspects of Pte- Medical Training.\ A dinner in Hale House just pre- ceding the lectlll'e is also being planned for Dean Cunningham by the Pre-:Vledic Committee. Dr. Clark indicated that at it the com- mittee will discuss several phases of the subject upon which Dr. Cun- ningham is to spealL Dr. Clark pointed out that the subject of pre-medical training has become a highly controversial one of l:ite He stated that the chief point of contention today is whether 01 not a science pre-med- ical b!lcltground is more effective than an academic one. To this por- tion of the ;;ubject of pre-medical training, Dr. Cunningham will de- vote most of his speech, Dr. Clark said.

Prom Maestro GLENN MILLER Fraternities Sing Tomorrow Evening Song Contest Revival To BeHeld Wednesday In Jackson's Gardens The annual Jnterftaternity Song Contest will be reoumed tomorrow night after a lapse of one year, it was announced yesterday by Aus- tin White, '41, who is in charge of :u rangements for the events. Plans .urmulated by the Interfraternity .:::ouncil committee which White heads, calls for the contest to be- gin in JackBon s Gat den's Nott Elm Glade at 7:30 p. m. At least eight fraternities a1·e expected to be rep- t•esented in this ) ear's Sing. White indicated that each group will be asked to sing two numbers a college song and a fraternity song. In the event of a tie between two or more of the competing fra- temitie;;, they will be a.~ked to sing a third ,:ong of their own choosing. Judges Announced The judgeB ior tommTow night's sing will be Mrs. Benjamin P. Whit- aker, Professor Charles T. Male, and Dr. Elmer A. Tidmarsh. Each group and its selections will be an- nounced by Edmund G. Kel'y, '41, newly elected manager of the Glee Club. The last Song Contest of this type was held in the spring of 1938, when the winner, Psi Upsilon, pe1manently tetired the trophy. At that time, Kappa Sigma was the runner-up, while Delta Upsilon was third. No contest was held last year, but this year, in an effort to re- vive inte1 est in the Sing, the Inter- fr atemity Council has donated a new cup which will become the per- manent possession of the winning fraternity tomorrow night. This is a departure from the custom of other year·s, when, in order to retire the cup, any one fraternity was re- quired to win the conteet on three different occa~ions. Chairman Re.ports Best Ticket Sale In Prom History MacKenzie Also States Drawings for Booths Will Be Held Thursday The large>t ticket sale in Junior Ptom history has been realized al- though the dance is still four days off, it wa:; announced last night by Kenneth MacKenzie, chairman af the Prom committee. MacKenzie reported that 373 tickets have thus far been sold and that a net profit of $350 ha,; already been realized on the dance. MacKenzie also indicated that drawings for booths would be •held on Thursday afternoon at 5 o'clock. According to the final arrange- ments, following the acceptance of the proposed plan to conserve space booths have been moved back nearer the walls this year and will be devised with less em- phasis on the \drawing room\ ef- fect. In addition, the large amount of space offered by the hand-ball court has been utilized by convert- ing it into booths. Many special anangements have been made to the end of providing for the un- rn;ually large number attending the Prom, MacKenzie indicated. \Terrace Cafe\ Planned A distinct ieature of the Prom decorations this year will be the \Terrace Cafe\ which the commit- tee has arranged for the section of the balcony facing Alexander Field. Card tables for the establish- ment of the cafe are being provided by the fraternities. Colored lights will play on the arches of the bal- cony and the cafe will be illumi- nated by small lamps on each ta- ble. All decorations will be in ac- cord with the predominant motif of the PI om--the Glenn Miller \Moonlight Serenade\ theme. \All groups having booths should bring their furniture to the gym- nasium not later than Friday,\ MacKenzie said in conclusion. North College is the only neutral group that will definitely have a booth this year. In this connection, it was pointea out that the Hale House lounge will be open Sunday morning. The 1940 Junior Prom will begin promptly at ten o'clock Saturday evening, May 11, and will close at two o clock Sunday morning. Chap- erones will be: Mr. and Mrs. Thomas C. Desmond, Dr. and Mrs. Dixon Ryan Fox, Dr. and Mrs. Charles N. Waldron, Dr. and Mrs. C. F. F. Garis, Mr. and Mrs. Os- wald D. Heck, Mr. and Mrs. Charles A. Harrell, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Bailey, Mr. and Mrs. W. Howard Wright, Mr. and Mrs. Walter C. Baker, Mr. and Mrs. Mills Ten- Eyck, Dr. John and Miss Mildred March. Mr. and Mrs. James E. Leath.

The plan i-s basically good, and, as Dr. Fox points out in his letter printed in this past Tuesday's Concordiensis, such rating plans are used in large businesses such as the Gen- eral Electric Company. A word with the psychology depart- ment of this colleg·e, however, would suffice to show that they are not used in the way the recently approved plan would be. Seve1·al, not one, persons rate each man in, for instance, the General Electric Company. In the do1111itories, each procto1· necessarily will rate the men under his charge, even though the entire boa1·d of proctors will approve the rating. In the fmtemities, a committee of brothers will rate all of the men. In both cases, the principle objection concems the matter of too much subjectivity: in the dormitodes, because only one man will do all of the .i udging; in the fratemities, be- cause college men are not mature enough to pass over their own likes and dislikes. Any fmternit~· man will admit that, although he appreciates his house and his brothers, he is not too idealistic about the fraternity system, that he cannot really like all of the men with whom he lives. Uoth of these factors are potential!~· very dangerous. A subjective rating scale that does not speak well for the student it concerns can cause much trouble. Granted, the administration will say that professors have mted students for several years. A gToup rating such as this. from an im- personal point of view, although perhaps not infallible, can- not stray too far from tmth. A rating by one man, Ol' a small group of students, can. A high rating for some students no doubt will be of advantage to them, but is it worth the harm a low rating can do to another grou.p of students'? By admission, t\vo dormitory proctors have exp1·essed the view that the cooperation rating sc<de will be something to \improve the dorm situation\ and \to hold over the heads of the students.\ This tells its own story, the stor~· that stu- dents all over the campus expected to hear when the new plan was approved. The stor·y is simply that the entire pro- cedure can and will be used as a disciplinary measure. Such action in a liberal college cannot be condoned. We suggest that the administration and the Intel'fl·ater- nity Council retrace their steps and attempt to find another method for discovering how a man cooperates. The method should cut down the subjectivity of judgment and dismiss the element of discipline. Then a student will still be able to say proudly he attends Union, a truly liberal college. R. S. S.

'i Pag~'Four Greene and Barnes Discuss Emba.rgo At Town Meeting Declare United States Should Stop Economic Support of Japanese \The United States should stop its economic support of Ja·pan dur- ing the present Far Ea:sloHn cun- flict,\ a;greed Dr. Harry Elmer Barnes, and Roger S. Gr,eene, prin- cipal speakers at the Empire State Town Meeting in Old Ghapel on Sunday. During the discussion of the question: \Wha·t Should Amer- ica DGJ A'bout China and Japan,\ both Barnes, historian and author- ity on world politics, and Greene, chairman of the America·n Com- mittee for Non~Participation in Japanese Aggression, asserted that nothing would justify the execution of wa·r on Japan to protect our in- terests in the Far East. 1 Ba.rnes Favors Impartiality Dr. Barnes, former professor of economics and history, stated that \some will say that ... we should give China every possible aid ,;hart of war. I would agree, if we could be sure that such aid would actu- aUy stop short of war . But with every step we take to curtail J ap- anese supplies, the more certain we are to force Japan Into some des- perate stroke which will either in- volve us in war or will turn over the Far East to collusion between Japan and Rmsla.\ During the discu~sion following, Barnes, a newspaper columnist, was asked whether he felt that England and France are \standing between the United States and destruction.\ He replied that he had felt that way in 1917, but that he now realized that if we \fall for that bun!'\ again there will be \another Versailles. another World War. and another Hitler, all of them greater than the previous one.\ Bellevue Quality Bakery 2625 B'way Phone 4-6248 BREAD- ROLLS -PASTRY PHONE 4-5614 Everything Electrical JAS.

He showed no signs of his musical des- tiny until his mother gave hi~ a saxophone on his fourteenth bJrth- d!tY· Naturally adept, he. soon achieved local fame on the mstru- ment, playing in his spare time at dances and social gatherings. Later, Mr. Huehn became a boiler maker in the steel-plate mill where his father was Vice-President and Geneml Manager. He worked nine hours a d<J.y for six days a week and never played hb saxophone again. He started vocal lessons with Anne Griffiths. Within a year he had won the Pittsburgh and Penn- sylvania prizes in a .National Radio Contest. The followmg year he. ob- tained a fellowship at the Julhard Graduate School to study under Mme. Schoen-Rene. While still there he was chosen to create the leading baritone roles in the pre- mieres of two new operas, the Erskine-Gruenberg \Jack and the Beanstalk' and the Erskine-Antheil \Helen Rerties.\ Immediately after this he was engaged to the Metro- politan Opera Association, an.d found himself fully embarged on h1s singing career. ---a--- Christian Association Names McCain Head Clarence H.

Will Swing for Prom Goers Saturday Evening p. m. tomorrow evening in the Alumni Gymnasium as the first bars of \Moonlight Serenade\ open the Junior Promenade of the Class of 1941. Further reason for Miller te feel \rig·ht at home\ will ·be the decorations (the motif of which), as planned by Chairman Kenneth MacKenzie and the Prom commit- tee, will •be the bespectacled trom- bonist's famous theme. Attendance, which will be, by .far, the highest in the traditional event's history, will be drawn from as far from the campus as Win- netka, Illinois, and from. as near to it as Union Street. The Prom- goers will not only enjoy Miller's \sweet and swing\ but will also have at hand the beauties of flood- lit Jackson's Gardens and be en- abled to view a full program of athletic events planned to give the fair visitors a taste of Union hos- pitality. The Mounteban·ks will ·re- vive a custom, dormant since the Civil War, of presenting a Moliere play during the Prom festivities. \The Doctor in Spite of Himself\ is the vehicle chosen by the dra- matic group to be given tomonow night. Terrace Cafe Highlights of the decorations will be the \Terrace Cafe\ effect with soft lights and gay furnishings to embellish the scene. Card ta'bles for the establishment of the cafe have been provided by the various fraternities. Each table will have illumination furnished by small lamps and will hold free contain- ers of Chesterfield cigarettes. A completely different system for refreshments than that follow- ed in past years, including a Hale House annex to be located within the gym, will also be installed. The annex will be placed• in the two rooms at the north end of the run- ning track. Mr. Walter Cease, manager of Hale House, has plan- ned a complete set of electrical equipment for the preparation of light refreshments, coffee, and soft drinks. Junior Week will be officially opened tonight when Julius Huehn leading baritone of the Metropol: itan Opera Company, steps onto the chancel of Memorial Chapel at 7:45 p. m. to begin his concert. Im- mediately upon the conclusion of Mr. Huehn's recital sixteen frater- nities will hold their traditional house dances which will last until 1:00 p.m. Executive Committee In addition to MacKenzie the Executive Committee is com~osed ('f: Edwin W. Scantleb\1ry, Robert Corby, Laskat· Schwartz, Albert S. Callan, Jr., Mason Hutchins and Cecil Angell.

On Monday afternoon the Dutchmen travel to Syracuse where they will tangle with the Orangemea for the second time this season. Bill Hark- ness' lacrosse squad will also see action against the Red Raiders from Colgate this afternoon on Library Field as part of the activities scheduled for Junior Prom Weekend. To- morrow afternoon the varsity tennis team will entertain the M. I. T. netmen in their fourth match of the season. Odds a·re heavy for the Dutch-~ men to snag their second win of the season this afternoon when they face HamHton; earlier in the season th~ Continentals were nosed out by Swarthmore and in t-urn the Dutchmen whitewash e d Swarthmore 5-D with Bob Hanson wielding the ln ush wtth a three hitter. In the only other game of the season :the Dutchmen lost a close one to Syracuse, 12-11. Hamilton has a veteran team but has been handicapped by lack of practice, resulting in etra tic field- ing and hitting. With practice and experience under their belt they may give the Dutchmen trouble this afternoon. Hamilton will line- up with Sackett, a sophomore at first and the veteran Jim Williams at second. Joy, who has played for two years against Union teams will be at shortstop and Bob Forbush, another senior who has tangled with Union teams on ·basketball courts, football fields and dia- monds for three years, will round out t.he inf.ield at third. Captain Davis will be at center .field, flank- ed by Bob Williams, who pitched against Union last year, in right and Miller at left. In all probabil- ity Les Young, a sophomore, will get the pitching assignment with the veteran Petronio behind the plat~). Regulars tv Start Coach Lawrence has indicated that he will start his regular team in the field with Captain Charlie Brockner at first base, Ned Reilly at second, Mickey Rathlev at shortstop and Bobbie Garnett at third. AI Turchick will be held back as a reserve infielder and might .break into the tussle in Ned Reilly's spot at second. Freddie Patrie, who is leading the team at bat will be in center field, \Tiny\ Weintraub in right and AI Rasso in left. Lawtence decided at game time to give the pitching assignment to \Swede\ Hanson instead of Chet Robinson. Hanson recently pitched a brilliant three hit shutout against Swarthmore. Both men have To Pitch Tomorrow AL MOULD day. With a veteran infield and outfield anc1 two sensational pitch- ers up from the freshman team they are expected to give the Dutchmen a strong tussle with the odds even as to the winner. So far this season the men from the banks of the Raritan have gained decisions over Manhattan, Wes- leyan, Brown, Princeton and La- fayette while losing to N. Y. U., Lafayette and to Fordham. Lead- ing the Rutgers club at the plate will be the heavy hitting Jim Kuhn, Jim Wallace and Lee Dwu- let. Rutgers also has a strong pitching staff with sophomore Les Perkins and Ozzie Day leading the way so far this season. chalked up victories over the ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ varsity. In 1938 Robinson pitch- !Fr ed a masterful 7-3 win over Hamilton in their two years with the Continentals, allowing but five hits while fanning nine. In 1939, \'swede\ came out on top· 10-7. He allowed but six hits but six errors in the field spoiled his game. AI Mould will get the nod against the Rutger.s club tomorrow afternoon, while Robinson will go to the rnound against Syracuse.

The team has not made a very impressive show- ing so far this season having drop- ped three matches, to Swarthmore, Haverford and Williams. Coach Doty was more optimistic than in the past with his comment on the ga;me tomorrow. His state- ment was that if the team played as previously the Engineers should fall the victims of the Dutchmen. The probable line up will consist of, in the singles Tom Ralston, : Doug 'Schatton, George Miller, Le- , land Beik, Clancy Woodward and Phil Potter, Douglas, Ralston and : Miller, Schatton and Swart, Beik i and Ed Kane.

This year the editors have improved considera•bly upGn the methods of treatment, failing, however, to treat prope1·!y some of the major aspects Gf college life. The seniors have been dealt with in the usuaJ. directory style. There is nothing especially poor about this treatment, but neither is there anything especially good. One is left as completely indifferent by this section of the Garnet as he was by his high school, or pz·ep school yearbook. Technically speak- ing, one sympathizes with those seniors whose faces were half chop- ped off because their pictures were incorrectly mounted at the edges of the pag#S. The commentary technique ap- plied to the sections on athletics, activities, and fraternities is a laudable innovation. The informal HENRY L. CROSBY, JR.

Kenneth MacKenzie, chair- man of the Prom committee re- ported that four hundred and sixty- seven .bids were sold for the dance. He said twenty-three committee- men were given free invitations while appt·oximately fifty faculty and .guest couples were also pres- ent. Junior Week was officially open- ed on Friday night when Julius Huehn, leading ba·ritone of the Metropolitan Opera Company, sang in Memorial Chapel. Following Mr. Hnehn's concert, sixteen fratern- ities held house dances. Also on the week-end's progra·m wez e three athletic contests. The baseball team met Hamilton and RutgPrs, w;hile the varsity 'lacrosse team played Colgate. Saturday night, the Mounteban·ks revived the custom of presenting a Moliere play during Prom week-end with the production of \The Doctor in Spite of Himself.\ Among the innovations of the Prom was the absence of official booths. Furniture was placed around the floor in an informal manner. The theme for the decor- ations w·as maestro Miller's \Moon- light Serenade\ with a background of the evening sky set up in the gymnasium. Hale House Annex Built into the decorations were a Coca Cola booth on the dance floor, and a Hale House annex on the balcony. The balcony was set with caid tables that had been loaned by the va·rious fraternities and which were used for the dis- pensing of the food that was cook- ed in the gymnasium, equipment hgving been installed there by the Hale House management, .Secondly, where 1~ any mention California for three years he worked made of .n?~-fratermty m~n, apart 1 in the Park Service during the sum- from. actrv1ties, though thts. gt·oup mers.

Also present were Miller's vocalists, Marion Hutton and Ray Eberle. Eberle handled the softer numbers while Miss Hutton took care of the fa.st arrangements.

Wyatt; '32, ad- visor to the group. Mr. Wyatt indi- cated that no positive action has yet been taken by the Outing Club on the proposal. The purpose of the general com- mittee to whose membership the Outing Club h;iS •been aslied is to promote, publicize, and finance the development of Youth Hostels in this area which will be used to a gr.eat extent, the committee indi- cated, by college students. The first hostel to be opened In the new campaign will be dedicated on May 18.

The play, which will be broadcast from 4:00 to 4:30 p. m .. is a fanciful 1 drama of everyday life concerning pre-destination and transmigration of souls. Forkel's drama concerns itself with a young lawyer who encoun- ters a woman whom ·he has never seen before, but who claims to be his wife. In the course of the play, which incorporates the themy of the transmigration of souls, she complicates the home life of the lawyet· and the drama ends with the suicide of both.

Adams, \will give you faith not only in engi- 1 neering laws but also in the greater laws of human relations.\ Citing his long tenure teaching engineering to col·lege students, Dr. Adams said he was convinced that a sound condition was possible only through sound logical thinking. Students, he explained, came out of schools accepting approximations as facts. Intermission found a !a.rge num- ber of couples going to Jackson's Garaens which was arranged with floodlights for the occasion. Special benches were set up .for the bene- fit of the Prom-goers. In pointing to the large attend- ance, MacKenzie, indicated that the affair was a huge success from a financial standpoint. He reported Lhat all bills not yet paid would be disposed of as soon as possible and that a large profit would be real- ized from the dance. ---a--- Student Pilots Pass Ground School Finals A!l . the members of the Flight Trammg Ground School which has been operated by the college for the past 12 weeks. under the aus- pices of the Civil Aeronautics Au- thority have now passed both the local and the Federal examinations on the Ground School subjects,. it \The curious confusio: In the was announced today by Professor world today,\ the speaker contin- Peter I.

Coming out at the stat·t of the second half the Dutchmen reversed the posi- tion ana the Red Raiders' attack soon proved futile agaimt a deter- mined Union defense which held Colgate to one goal in the second half. Union tallied once in the third period and twice in the four·th but could not overcome the six goals scored by Colgate in the fir::;t half. Duke, Vogle and LaPierre had all slipped shots past Holmes before Jack Guibert, Union center, man- aged to make good on a shot for the Dutchmen. Vogel scored twice more for Colgate in the second period and LaPierre made it six before Guibert again tallied for Union sec- ond:: before half time. Griffith, Nothacker and Ostrander dropped shots into the Colgate cage in the last half while LaPierre was the only Raider to score.

Pag·e Four Delegates Attend Faiir Conference Be·nnett. Crosby and Twining Among Those Present at Meeting Over four hundred representa- tive,; of eighty colleges in the cuunti y were guests of the General Motors Cot·poration a week ago last night at the Highways and Horizons Building at the New York World's Fair. In an effort to make \coHege men understand the po- sitions and aims of big busines::: rather than to particula·rly publicize the automobile industry\ General Motors entertained the college rep- resentatives at a banquet and dis- cussion, based on the \Information Please\ radio program, on the topic \Opportunities for Youth in Building the World of Tomorrow.\ Nut only did the Cor!Joration as- sume the complete week-end ex- penditut·e:; of the gt·uup, but a li8t of celebrities were in attendance, including Genet·al Hugh S. John- son, Alfred P. Sloan l·Chairman of General Motors), Grover Vi-'halen, and James A. Farley. l<~xperts QuizzE'd Following the u:nner at the Fair, the students had an opportunity to hear quetitionti, culled from over 600 submitted by undergraduate re:ll·esentatives. answered by a bo-at d of \experts.\ In a pt·ogram conducted by Clifton Fadiman the questions were an:;weted by une in- dividual and discu.sed by the board including General Johnson, Dr. Karl T. Compton, president of Mas- sachusctt~ Institute of Technology, Dr. Et nest M. Hopkins, p1 esident of Dartmouth College, and Mr. Charles F. Kettering, vice-pre8ident of General Motors in charge of Re- search. The Union repre:;en!atives at the General Motor\ Con terence were Dt·. William W. Bennett, Henry L. Crosby. and James E. Twining.

May 26 and 27. for the benefit of the organization's Fel- lowship fund. The seven·award. \fOUl star\ film, now playing in New York City, stars Orane Demazis, Femandel, and Gabriel Gabrio and was directed and pro- duced by Marcel Pagnol from the novel by Jean Giono.

Fox Announces Method For Use of Rating Plan The method by which the col- lege will put into ef.fect in the dormitories the new plan to ob- tain tatings on cooperation for seniors' placement bureau r·ec- . ords was outlined today by President Dixon Ryan Fox. Dr. Fox said that in each dormitory the seniors will ·be judged on co- operation by the Proctor, the Assistant Proctor, and the Stu- dent dormitory council. In North and South Colleges, this council is composed of th1'ee residents; in Oldgym Hall it is cemposed of two. At the same time, P.1esident Fcx announced the assistant proctors for netx year. In North College, Robert L. Stanley, In- structor in Engineering, will be the assistant ·proctor.

The film, one of the most unusua:l of its nature ever filmed, carries the audience to the actua:l lands of these .four empires and graph- ica:J.ly depicts the ruins of the great temples, monuments, tombs, and whole cities er.ected by the rulers, It takes the spectator to Egypt where the first world empire in re- corded histery arose; then to Ni- neveh, ancient capi·tol of Assyria, the second vVorid Empire. From there the film travels to Bagdad which J.ies in the ancient territory of Babylonia. Persia, the fourth and largest of the empires depicted, is shown to particular advantage in the presentation of the ancient capital of the Persians.

Some of the bull-sessions wlll discuss among other things: \Civil Liberties and How to Pre- serve Them on the Campus,\ and \Jobs and Their Effect on Student Futures\. The NSF A's sponsorship of La tin American toms is ·based on the idea that, although the war has made it impossible to travel i:n Europe, it should not destroy the summe1 travel of American college students.

In discussing the history of Wood's Hole, Dr. Scott said, \The laboratory was founded about fifty year ago by several oustanding biologists for the purpose of study- ing marine life. This institution was established not far from the Leper Colony that Louis Agassiz inaugurated.'' The Pyramid Club, the neutral students' organization, held a ban- quet TueEday evening at t :-.e Uni- versity House on Union Strec t as a conclusion to the club'R activiti~3 for the present school year. Four volumes of plates entitled \Birds of America,\ drawn by John James Audubon, ornitholo- gist, are on display in the college library, Helmer Webb, college li- brarian announced. The prints were purchased on July 15, 1844 by Eliphalet Nott, in his capacity as president of the college, for $1,000. Recent as<essments place its value in the vicinity of $12,000. In addition to the engravings the library will also ad·d the supple- mentary four volumes entitled \Ornithological Biography. These books tend to give descriptions of the plates included in the original \Birds of America.\ It is these books that have earned the author the reputation of the foremost bird authority in America. The principal trip to be develop- ed by the organization is that call- ed \NS'FA Goes to Mexico.\ T·his group offers six weeks of intensive study of the Mexican scene, with a Mexican guide. ---0---- Library Lists Titles For Summer Reading After developing the garden, Pro- fessor Jackson determined to mai.te it a \Play-place\ for students. That alumni appreciated this undergrad- uate haven is illustrated, she said, by their continuing interest in the garden. Some alumni, one 97 years old, still send annual contribu- tions to maintain the garden, Mrs. Fox also described the de- velopment of the campus tree,;, The first fifty elm trees were pur- chased by Dr. Nott for $9.37'h and he tried various species of trees, but finally was· forced to employ only the native American elm which still flourishes. Since th~ campus was a pastureland when purchased, Dr. Nott planted all the trees, with the exception of t-.1e giant Nott Elm that has since been destroyed. Dr. Elmer Tidmarsh will be ac- companied in the Sunday recital by Pianist Hugh Sha:pe, Jr., ·~s. This is to bEl the last 111 the senes for the year, except for the c?n- cert to be given June 9, at which time Dr. Tidmarsh will be assisted by Dr. Spross at the piano. He will also present a male chorud com- posed of singers from Troy, Sche- nectady, Kingston, and Pough- keepsie. The Sunday recital will i:1cludc. I. Ballet-\Petite Suite,\ Claude Debussy Prelude to \The Afternoon of a Faun\ ........... Debussy II. Sonata-The 94th Psalm, Julius Reubl{e III. Rhapsody in Blue, George Gershwin \The outstanding advantage of this labor a tory to ·scientists,'' Dr. Scott continued, \is that both salt and fresh water marine life can :be studied. simultaneously. At the Cape, cold water from the Arctic Ocean biings northern forms while the southern tip is bathed by the warm water of the gulf which brings southern forms of life. There are also many fresh w.ater animals in the ponds, found only a few feet from the ocean.\ Dr. Scott pointed out that ani- mals had been interchanged f.rom their natural habitat and that sur- prising changes had taken place in the lddneys. Immediately following th~ din- ner the club held a busineds meet- ing at which time the revisad con- stitution was t·ead and approved by the members. Elections or officers for the coming college year eon- eluded the activities. Richard Wata- nabe '43 was elected president; Ed- ward Fischer '42, vice-president; Robert Bishop '43,. secretar~·, a I'd Everett McCarty, '43, treasurer. The Newman Club also heLl its last meeting of the present schuol year last night in Sill!man Hall, at which time James O'Coanor ·.n, was elected president; Edward De- Feo '41, vice-president; Feliciano Juan Gonzales '42, secretarY; Rob- ert Marin '42, treasurer, ant! Don- ald Giroux, '43, reporter. Displayed in the case are also addition Audubon engmvings illus~ trating the \Vivipar-ous Quadru- peds\ in America. The various ex- hibits date from 1827-38 and form some of the most valuable posses- sions of the library. In order to insure the showing a great variety of the prints the Hbrary staff an- nounced that the plates will be changed twice weekly. In connection with the ·summer t•eading program, proposed by Pro- fessor· Larrabee for the class of 1942, the library will, so far as pos- sible, supply the titles to students signing u.p for the program, Hel- mer Webb, Lib1arian, announced. The books on the list may be bor- rowed from the college library for periods to suit the convenience of the students. Other books not in the popular reading class will as usual be charged out for the entire summer. Arrangements for this privilege should be made directly with Mr. Webb after the examination period. Famous naturalists, including John Burroughs visited Union be- cause of the garden, that continued as a private venture until the death of Mrs. Jackson Then the col- lege took over the care with John C. Van Yoast in charge. When he died five years ago, Mrs. Fox was asked to take chargQ,

Since this is the last issue of The Concordiensis until June 8th at which time the commencement issue will mark the close of activities upstai1·s in Sillinmn Hall for the year, The Concordiensis will not be able to print the names of those honored at the cere- monies, and it is appropl'iate at this time to offer our con- gTatulations in advance. During :\Ionday's assembly period seven members of the Junior Class will be \tapped\ for the Terrace Council by the graduating members. In congmtulating these men, sup- posedly the most prominent of the Class of 1941. we v.-ish again to question the inactivity of this group in recent years. :\Iany elaim that the Council, steeped a.s it is in tradition, should remain as a purely honorary group with few if any duties to pel'fo1·m. To this argument is presented one which would have the Council revive itself and once again become the most vital campus organization it was at its inception. Certainly, we feel. if the latter of these viewpoints was acted upon a gTeater incentive \\'ould be offe1·ed all students aspir- ing to become members of l'nion's senio1· honorary society and a Terrace Council Key would again take on a worthy significance. :\luch the same situation exists with regard to the Garnet Key Society. Annually its new!~· elected membe1·s meet and make extensive plans as to its activities for the coming· year and annually these plans fall through or are sidetracked. The fall parties for the Fl'eshman class, once the responsibility of the Terrace Council. have recently been assigned to the Gamet Key members. Yet much of the work and prepar- ation is done either by members of the administ1·ation or by one or two of the more consciencious men in the honorary Junio1· Society. POLICY- ::-,)\ewspapers throughout the entire world carry screaming headlines telling of the holocaust in Europe. Their pages <u·e filled ·with descriptions of the \second \Vodd War.\ of the claims of the allies, of the claims of the Germans, and the denials of both. Day after day exchange copies of college publications al'e received at The Concordiensis office contain- ing stories of peace movements, student \anti-war\ meet- ings, world peace conferences, mass \stay neutral\ demon- strations, and editorials on the conditions of the wol\ld. So much is happening in this connection that we felt obliged to explain the policy of The Concordiensis. Nothing· of the world war, foreign conditions, or domestic policy has appea1·ed in the pages of Union's student paper except the opinion expressed in the Affairs column and so far as is in our power, nothing will. Although student demonsh·ations may indirectly concem all college students nothing resem- bling mass meetings, voicing one opinion or another, have taken place at l:nion and so long as her students have been content to read their war news in the daily papers. The Con- cordiensis has continued and will continue its policy of the past to serve Union's best inte1·ests with student and cam- pus Bews exclusively.

The four top tunes from the new show \Higher and Higher\ ~ung by one of the stars in the show. Miss Ross' delivery gives the .oongs an added something that I am sure they do not have on paper. The lyrics of the first tune are espe- cially clever. Yours Is My Heaz·t Alone and Down by thP Old Mill Stream- Benny Goodman and his orchestra. :-<orhing out;,;tanding on these two sides, but the fine performance of the band is sme to please the B. G. fans. Helen Forrest delivet·s her usual pleasant interpretation of the lyrics on the \A\ side. Lady Bt> Good and Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams - Frankie Trumbauet· and his orchestra. F1 ankie's band is coming right along. None of its perfm·mances to date have been really bad, although none have been exceptional. Tram's saxophone is heard to good advan- tage on both :;ides. This Is the Beginning of the End and Believing-~Bob Crosby and his orchestra. The band's performance of the first side is hardly up to Crosby's par, which is due mostly to the bad arrangement of this pop- ular numbet· from \Johnny Apollo\. Performance is better on the re- verse although the ballad is on the trite ~ide. Easy DoPs It and Louisiana - Count Basie and his orchetra. Su- perb Basie from every angle. Buck Clayton's muted trumpet work on the \A\ side and Lester Young's saxophone solo on the platter-mate are the high-spots in addition to the Count's piano solo on both Eides. Percy Have Mercy and Look Out -Louis P.t·ima and his orchestra. The first side contains some of the inconsistent Prima's best horn work, in addition to some amusing vocals. The reverse i~ a bad steal from ··In The Mood''. Swing That Music -~ Louis Arm- strong with Jimmy Dorsey's orches- tra. Certain to please all those who have been insisting that Louis should have a better band than his own to back him. Of cout·se his trumpet has never been surpassed, and if at times his hot·n blowing does not represent him at his best, as in this number, he is so far ahead of anyone else who plays this instrument that his perform- ance could nevertheless be termed more than satisfactory. Body and Soul and What Is This Going to Get Us'?- -Billie Holiday.

The Purple squad showed marked superiority over the Dutch- men in every department and only sensational stops by Goalie Holmes in the openiug fra:me kept the vi,;i- tors' score from mounting. This was the :!Hth loss for the Dutchmen of the year and they now appear head- ed for another prolonged losing streak. Williams threatened often in the fir:;t period as the play continually centered around the Union cage. Potter and Brown repeatedly tossed the ball at Holmes but Lady Lucl{ was with the Dutchmen and the first period ended with no score. Harvey Potter, sensational Wil- liams center, finally found his eye in the second period and started the ball rolling for the Purple shirted players with a score mid- way through the frame. Shutout; Reilly Hits Two Johnny Ricey, knocked out of the box in his pi'evious appearance against the Dutchmea on Alexan- de·r Feld, came back to pitch the upstate teaom to· a three hit shut- out victory against Union on Mun- day afteraoon on the S-yracuse campus. Ricey completely spiked the Garnet's sluggers as Patrie, Palmer, Weintraub and Brockner went hitless for the aftcmoon. Ned Reilly, diminutive ~econd sasker, was the only Dutchman. who could solve Ricey's deliveries with any consi~tency as he collected two of the hits while Al Turchick rapped him for the other. \Swede\ Hanson, starting hurler, lasted three innings, allowing eight hits and three runs, before he re- tired in favor of AI Mould. Mould was mm·e effective than Hanson, allowing but two hit~ in five in- nings, but four wa1ks got him into trouble. In the sixth the Syracuse club scored two runs on one hit, two walks and an error by Harry Palmer. Ricey, Sy1·acuse hurler, fanned seven Dutchmen while his mates. stole five bases Ol'l Harry Palmer.

It could hardly be ex- pected that the Union defense men could offer much resistence as most of them played well into the second half with no rest.

He has passed on to some private and personal Nirvana of his own, where every typewriter has all its keys and a bottle waits at every four-alarm fire. And the only epitaph he would have wished is this .. . \He was a good reporter.\ His greatest, and most unconscious, character- istic was an insatiable curiosity. He seethed with questions. Nothing was as it seemed, and he picked frantically at s~trface facts until the shell broke and the muck. or' the treasure, underneath was exposed to his greedy mind. ..,_With or without the vine leaves in his hair, his sense of news verged on the occult. He knew bish- ops and gunmen, politicians and pickpockets, and treated both the great and the sham with the same casual impertinence. His mind was a brimming pool of assorted facts, which he turned on and off like a tap. Under a glass-hard exterior, he had a heart as soft as mush. He rooted fiercely for the underdog, perhaps because he was so much the underdog himself. He got paid very little-and when other people talked of the \profession of journalism\ his was the loudest laugh. ..,_ Sometimes he grew out of it. Sometimes he be- came a famous columnist, a noted author, or even an Editor. But mostly he grew old at 45. And when he saw a new youngster in the City Room he figured the best thing he could do was to take him across the street and say to\ him: \Kid what the hell are you doing around here? Get out of it. It's a lousy business ... \ But the youngster never took his advice. Year after year thousands of new youngsters decided there was only one thing in the world they wanted to be-a newspaperman. And the American press grew up. The old-time reporter has passed from the scene. But he left behind him a legacy of incalculable value to the nation. For he established the tradi- tion of good reporting as the foundation of a free press. lY\but buppmed.' lf' bo did it? lf' bere? lf' hen? Why? ..,_ As long as these questions can be asked hy good reporters free to write the truest and frankest an- swers they can find, freedom will have survived. True, since the days of the old-time reporter, both men and minds have changed. The reporter of today is a better man than his predecessor. He bas to be. He is better-educated, better-paid. Neither he nor his editor can get away with the cheap sen- sationalism of yesterday's Yellow Journali~m-and neither of them insists on any special license to get drunk. The reporter's passport today is re- spected everywhere, and he is expected to Jive up to the code of his profession. .... Too, America's appetite for news has grown sharper. It takes some 25,000 local reporters and l,KHS daily newspapers to gratify it. Altogether, 300,000 men and women are engaged in telling you what is happening in the world. with all the trimmings you\re accustomed to-comic strips, women's pages, photographs, society notes, advice to the lovelorn. columnists, cartoons, editorials, crossword puules . :Jjut whatever the extra values newspapers and magazines may offer today, one thing remains the same ... the heart of \ free Pt'eH is still tbe good reporter. It is still the man with the nose for news, as peculiar and au- thentic a possession as the eye of a painter or the ear of a musician. ..,_Perhaps good reporting is the reason, above all other reasons, why the Newsmag- For the Newsmagazine has. as grist for its weekly mill, all that has been found out by all the world's good reporters. Sometimes these good re- porters are TIME's own correspondents or legmen. Sometimes they work for one of the great Press Associations. Sometimes they are obscure people whose nuggets have been buried on page 10 of some little-read publication. Sometimes they are men and women in TIME's home-office, who-at one end of a wire-probe a reporter three hundred or three thousand miles away until a few confused facts become a well-ordered, living story. The world is the good reporter's hunting ground. No man can tell where a nose for news may pick up the scent. Stories may break in the White House, the Holland tunnel, the Balkans, the South Pole, Number 10 Downing Street, or 1913 Central Ave- nue, South Bend. ..,.. No man can anticipate TIME's stories. The News· magazine is as unpredictable as the warring, struggling, creating, cock-eyed human race, whose historian it is. Only this is certain ... In today's world the true adventures of your fellow humans, gathered and told by good report- ers. make more absorbing reading than anything in the world of make-believe. This is one of a series of advertisements in which the Editors of TIME hope to give College Students a dearer picture of the world of news· gathering, news-writing, and news-reading-and the part TIME plays in helping you to grasp, measure, and use the history of your lifetime as you live the story of your life.
