The shades of night were falling fast, As through the streets of town thet·e passed A Sophomore with lofty pate, Approaching slowly College gate.

ANOTHER year has rolled around and an- other Senior election has been held. The election passed off \vith, perhaps, less ill-feel- ing than usual, but lett one riddle to be solved. The question as to whether blank votes are to be counted in deciding if a per- son has a majority or not, has 6 always been a disJ?uted one. We hold that Mr. Lyon was fairl J elected Prophet on the first ballot, receiving tvven t y votes to niqe teen for Mr. Johnson, and three blanks. Precedent in the elections of '8 r can be cited to show both that a majority was required, as in Freshman year, and that-a plurality elected, as in last spring's election of CONCORDIENSIS editors. Justice would seem to demand that the of- fice be given to Mr. Lyon. All knew that there \Vere but the t\VO candidates, and if then a person voted a blank it showed very cl.early that he had no choice between the t\VO rn~, and so the votes of the ren1ainder ought to decide.
