THE CoNCORDIENSIS !VOL. ~¥LYiVIII. U1V!OJT :COLLEGE, J,U ... VE 17, r905. ~.Vo. 29 'COMMENCEMENT WEEK Opened by Baccalaureate Sermon The exercises of the 1.09th commence,ment were for1nally opened with the Baccalaureate sermon, which was delivered by Rev. Clark Seelye, '57, president of Smith College. The services were held in connection with the 225th anniversary of the First Reformed chul'ch. Union college was founded by the Rev. Dirck Ron'leyn, D. D., the seventh pastor of this church. It grew out of the Schenectady academy, which was organized and built by the people of this church in 17 8 5, at the corner of Union and Ferry streets. After ten years of prosperous life and mainly through the influence of Dr. Romeyn, the academy merged into the college, which was char- tered in 17 9 5. In 18 0 4, the year of Dr. Romeyn's death, the college was removed to the new edifice now known as the Union school. Union college has educated about 15 0 ministers of the Reformed Church of America. It was therefore, in every way proper that the commencement of Union col- lege should be closely connected with the First Refonned church. Long before the service opened people had be- gun to arrive, and by the time that the ministers, faculty and seniors marched in, clad in their caps and gowns, only the seats reserved for them were left vacant. Dr. Raymond introduced Dr. Seelye, who said in part: \I cannot tell you tlie pleasure it gives me to be once more among the students of the college to which I owe a large part of my training, and to stand once more within the church which was my spiritual guide while I was in college. \I take my text from St. John, 17 iii-'And this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.' \In this definition Christ does not attempt to explain the primal mystery whkh life involves. \Vhen. life is, ·whence it co1nes and whither it goes are questions to which science today cat1 give no satisfactory answer. In the last scientific analy- sis of the primitive Hfe cell there is found only a mingled mass of minute :filiaments, so marvelous- ly interlaced that it is impossible to discern either a beginning or an end. T\vo things, ho\vever, may be predicted of life which will serve to unfold the :.neaning ·of our text. All life must be fed; for all life there· is food. 'l'he first act of life is the search for food and its first appearance is in a body \Vhich it has created out of the food which it has found. X o po\ver can make things grow if the h1.ner vital force be wanting, and no life can exist without suitable nourishment. \Vhen fro1n any cause food is taken a way, or the inner force fails to assimilate it, death ensues. \The second thing we note is that for all life there is fo.od. Accidental causes may produce te1nporary famine, but it is now a ·well established fact that there is no species of life, vegetable or animal, for \Vhich there cannot be found in na- ture appropriaate food. \The life spirit has the same characteristics, al- though it involves a greater mystery, for spiritual life has a capacity t.o accept or reject the good it needs. \Vhich is no\vhere seen in the natural world. But notwithstanding spiritual life is thus radically distinguished from other vital processes by its baffling capacity of self-determination, it corre- sponds with physical life in the t.\vo factors which are essential to its existence and growth. There is the inner mysterious personal force which dis- tinguishes each one of us from every other being in the universe, and there Js the unseen force not ourselves, by which our personality must be con- stantly fed. \The n1.ind will not grow unless nourished by other minds, and its strength and breadth will be proportional to the quality and quantity of the:

·, 6 T!-JE CONCORD!E'\VSIS. mental nourishment. Intellectual isolation is in- tellectual starvation. \ 'Knowledge is the food of the soul,' is an old trite saying, and men have always found that un- less it is supplied in sufficient quantities to ap- pease the n1:ental hunger, the mind wiH decay. The thirst for knowledge is the instintive craving of the intellectual life fo1· that which is essential to eq:ual care for the preservation and perfection of spiritual traits? Is not that expectation strengthened by the evi·dence \Vhkh nature gives that man is her cro\\vniHg work, for which the who're c:reai:ion groaneth and travaUeth. together its existence. ''In the higher personal qualities of which the heart stands as the symbol, the craving for love must be satisfied with the ·COl'esponding love of anM othe1· heart. The n1an \Yho has no one to love hi1n, no friendly sympathy, invariably degenerates. However great the learning or the w<:>alth, unless the human heart have the vivifying touch of another's love, it will eventually sicken and die. A man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth. In the 1nidst of much goods and full storehouses, his best affec- tions may give up the ghost and leave only a sepulchre. ''To make man ·what he ought to be, to bring the human spirit to its full stature, he must kno\Y the best characteristics of other spirits. But man hungers for one vvho does not die as men die, -vvho is not ignorant and vveak and sinful, as men are, whore love is not exhausted by our de- mands, nor alienated by our neglect, who has in himself eternal life and is able to give it to us abundantly. \If this brief span of existence between the cradle and the grave be all there is of spiritual being, and the soul with the body is to vanish into the manifold physical forces around us, then the cry of the sensualist. \Let us eat and drink, for to- morrow we die,\ \vill become, at last, the domin- ant cry. Against this fatal creed the best hearts in every age have uttered an effectual protest. in. pain until now? \Just after the publication of Darwin's work on the 'Fertilization of Orchids,' in \Yhich he showed that thek existence depends on the insects which their color and nectar attract, so that for the structure of eYery orchid there should be a corresponding insect to fertilize it, some one found in 1\li.adagascar an orchid ·with a nectary eleven inches long, implying, according to the Darvdnian theory, that. there 1nust be an insect with a tongue of corresponding length. This see1ned incredible, and as no such in~ect had ever been found with a tongue of such enor01nus length, the Darwinian theory was doubted by some critics. Darwin re- plied to the sceptics, 'the existence of an orchid with a slender nectary eleven inches in length, and \Vith nectar secreted at its tip, is to me most con- clusive demonstration of the existence of a moth. 'vi>th a tongue eleven inches in length, even though no such moth is known.' Darwin's faith ,vas finally justified, for a few years later such a moth was found. \In the struggle for existence in the natural ·world, science tells us that no individual peculiar- ity, however slight, that tends to the preserva- tion and perfection of life, has ever been neglect- ,ed. In the struggle for existence in the spiritual world, if that would be under the control of the . same Being, should we not expect there would be \May we not \Vith equal confidence affirm that the existence of a person, with the capacity for eternal life, with the craving for infiinite knowl- .edge and love, is as conclusive evidence that there is an ever-living God, who can satisfy this need, so that the human soul may realize its highest possibilities of being? If this be not so, if the hu- man soul has no one to satisfy its deepest vital need, then it is at variance with all we know of life else\\rhere. In the emphatic words of John Fiske, 'All the analo.gies of nature shout against the assumption of such a breacll. of continuity be- t\veen the evolution of 1nan and all previous evo- lution.' So far as we can detennine, there is no such breach. A God has been revealed who an- swers every need of the human spirit. Men have lived only as they have known Him, and their knowledge has ever been the 1neasure of their Yitality .

t e •'Jesus Christ, by his revelation of the eternal righteous God and Father satisfies the otherwise inappeasable hunger and thirst of the human soul. Wherever he has enabled men to know God bet- ter, there has been a more abundant li~e. His ·words have brought forth in the family, in. the state and in the church the noblest examp,les .of affection, of patriotis1n and of religion. Ey the strength and hope whic11 hi:s words have g,ivet1, men have subdued kingdoms and wrought r,i:g-h:t- eousness and vanquished their spiritual foes. Through this kno\vledge of God in Jesus Christ they have followed unfalteringly those whom tbey have loved <into the unseen world with the finn conviction that there life is to be enlarged. an.d perfected, an.d that there the deepest cravings of mind and heart will be satisfied, and every trace of death reiD.oved. * * * * Grove Exercises The Ivy Exercises were held as usual Mon.day afternoon ir1 the garden. The day had been cloudy and this fact doubtless kept many a \'.ray but there was nevertheless, a large crowd ranged around the :\ott Elm to see the tilne-honored ex- ercises.

The orchestra had discoursed light music for ~orne tilne when President Frank I. Losee arose from his chair on on the platform and made his farewell address to the class. Mr. Losee- af;:er reciting the virtues and abilities, of the glori0us class, referred to some of the pleasures the Inem- bers of its departments ·were having. 'Tho care and work-free days of the Classical 1nan \YE'l'e no 1nore, he said; the Bachelor of Science faced a lonely road, uncheered by the familiar sight of the busy Harmatococcus and Paramoedum; The Ph. B. \\'ould miss the ever ready ~lp of his faithful steed; the C. E. the daily an\cdotes of the Brooklyn Kavy Yard; and the E. E. must pay a ;long farewell to \incidental\ visits to the Assist- ant Treasurer. /. ~'< The Class Historian, James R. Stevens, then told of the doings of the class in the four years of its existance, its scraps ·with upper and under classes, its struggles with \financial reform,\ the survival of the fittest from its original meinber- ship and the friendship \Yith \Vhich all experiences had cemented their hearts. Clarence S. Arms delivered the c:lass oration, the title of which was ''The Professional School and the College.\ After speaking on the develop- ment of both institutions he brought out clearly the former's tendencies to\vard narro\Y training and compared them with those of the latter to- ward high ideals of honesty and all that makes for broad citizenship. C. Malcolm McGregor, class prophet, told the future of the members of the class as it was revealed to him by a spirit living in the year 1925. The members of the class \Vere at that time filling various roles in the world, a philanthropist, a superintendent of the General Electric Co., a circus barker and a col- lege president being among them. Some of the members of the class were having varied exper- iences in n1atrimony. The class poet, Louis C.

One n1ore class has been added to the long list of Cnion's ah1n1ni. Twenty-nine n1en of I 905 have received their clipron1as and kno\v no longer the joys an·c1 sorrovvs of undergraduate clays. It is vvith regret that we \vho are left behind see then1 go, for to all it n1eans the loss of n1any true and tried friends. Dropping the responsibilities of stu ~len ts, the n1en of 1905 have assun1ed a respo:\1sibil- ity wh~ich seen1s to us as great if not gr.:ater. The roll of Union's ah1n1ni is long, and as illustrious as it is long. Every ~-nan in leav- ing the college is put on his tnettle that he n1ay lessen in no way its fan1e. It is this re- sponsibility that is now taken up by rgos. Knowing the n1en of the cla .;;s as we do, \\'e need ha\'e no fear that they will not acquit then1sehTes well. Farewell n1en of 1905, you have done vvell in college~ your training school. l\Iay the san1e success attend you in the life upon which yon are entering. As we pause to look back over the college year which has just no\v clra\vn to a close, \\·e \vill surely be pardoned the glo\v of satisfaction \vhich that look causes us. In all branches has there been a \vholeson1e re- vival. That line of college activiities to \vhich the n1i11d of the college n1an seen1s naturally to turn first is athletics. Our rec- ord here certainly brings to 1nincl the tales \vhich we hear so often of a fonner po\v- eress. In football, \VOticlers \vere accon1- plishecl with what seen1ed at Erst a very or- dinary hunch of tnen. The season \vas n1ost successful fron1 all points of vie\v. The sa1ne n1ay be said of the baseball teatn, the tean1 starting slowly but \vincling up the season in fine style. The tract tean1 \von for the first titne in years. \\\rith all of these successes, there has been a g·ood. health, .. in- L • crease of college spirit, and \vhich \ve are sure is still on the up\\·arcl path. :\11 of this is pleasant to conten1plate. hut

Th\e \vorking abil- ity of the different clepartn1ents has been i111proved.

Rider, 'on, captain for next year. The election 1neets \vith the hearty approval of all. \I.(en\ has played :first base for three years, ahvays standing high in fielding, and this year leading the tean1 in batting. \ Vith all the old tnen hack. and with the active assistance of this year's successful captain, Capt. Rider should turn out a winning team next year. Shortly after the Rochester n1eet, Charles ~. \Valdron, 'o6, \vas elected captain of the track tean1 for next year. \Valdron n1acle the tean1 in his freshn1an year and has been a steady and reliable perfonner since, at all tin1es having been credited \Vi th a large share of the points n1acle by his tean1. The selection is as popular as that of the base- ball tean1. The prospects here are also bright for next year. All of this year's tean1 vvill return -vvith the exception of Capt. Ray- lnoncl and Becker. The hardest \vork \vill be to develop a ne-\v hurdler. ~coMMENCEMENT !Degrees and Prizes Awarded The oile hundred and ninth annual commence- ment of Union college was forrnally brought to a close \Yednesday rnorning by the g1·aduating ex- ercises, \Yhich were held in the First Reformed church, 1wettily decorated for the occasion, and .cro\Yded LO the doors with friends of the gradu- ates and of the cellege.
