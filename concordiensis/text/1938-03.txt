After considerable study, they have come to the con- clusion that the easiest method whereby they can help their own college is through life insurance policies.\ Contribution Pa,inless \At Williams,\ President Day said, \seniors take out insurance policies on their own lives and name W.i!liams College as the entire beneficiary. The college is endowed by the amount of $200 per student and the student pays $7.50 annually for 25 years. The student gets abso- lute]~- no personal benefit for him- self or his family from this special life insurance policy.\ President Day explained that a Union that there are not so many men who believe they can malre such a large annual gift Realizing this a plan has been evolved that would malre every contribution ab- solutely painless. Premium S1nall The plan suggested by President Day, outlined briefly is as follows: Each student will taJte out an ordi- nary $1,000 life in.surance policy naming anyone he desires as bene- ficiary. When he signs the contract each student makes two stipula- tions. First, if he lives, the interest on his premiums which accumulate during the first 17 year<J, amounting to $100, shall be turned over by the insurance company to the college. Second, if he should die within 17 years of his taking out the policy, the college will receive the accumu- lated dividends up to that point, plus enough from the face of the policy to make the total $100. The beneficiary will in this case get a sum between $900 and $1,000. A student, aged 20, talces out a pol- icy that will entirely be paid for in 30 years. He pays a premium of $22.22 annually for $5.78 every three months. He actually pays $66.60 in premiums during the 30 years. President Day redu{)ed these fig- ures into simple terms by saying, \you can drink it easily in one weelc-end.\ It is hoped that permission will be granted by the Dean to hold the party in Hanna Hall where last year's party was staged. At the party, the announcement of the election of the new Editor in Chief and his Senior Staff will be made. The Publication Board may also award Conc.ordiensis keys at this time for those who have completed three years' service as a membe1• of the staff.

This year, with C'.oach Joe Wheal!-€)'\ nursing it, the team made . great ·strides, (or should we say strokes), .and. ha.s given promise of even greater ones.

Five Holds Last Practie!es In Preparation for R. 'J>, I. Game Saturday's game with R. P. I. on the Union court will climax the final week of basketball practice for the Dutchmen and end the 1937-<l8 Gar- net season. Idle since Feb. 19 when it eked out a 32-30 victory over Rensselaer in Troy, Union's quin- tet worked out yesterday and today and will drill each day through Fri- day. Coach Nitchman is emphasizing passing and shooting this week and has been working up an unusual de- fense. He may also change the of- fense slightly. In addition to intra- squad drilling the courtmen will scrimmage three times with the freshmen before the last practice is over. Not certain about his starting lineup for Saturday, Nels expects a close and rough game from the Engineers and the order these days is \give and go.\ The R. P. I. lineup will probably include Preston, whose speciality is a left hand pivot shot, Shako, a good faker, and Carlson, who fol- lows up well. Captain Ward may be counted upon to speed up the pace, for he's a hard driver, and Ludke, another probable starter, IS a boy with a fair eye. The election of a hockey captain, scheduled to be held Monday, will take place on a later date to be announced by the Athletic De- ~~•ctmm<. ~~~ REVERBERATIONS II LIBRARY SMOKESTACK There has been quite a fuas up at the University of Rochester over the problem of spring football prac- tice. Varsity Coach Cox proposed a fourteen-day period of spring practice in fundamentals a!'ldscrim- mages to begin just before the Easter holiday. Though there was considerable opposition to the plan because it was thought it W{)Uld in- terfere with spring sports, Coach Cox's plan was adopted by the ath- letic department and will be put into operation. Practices will con- sist of one and one-half hours' work each day for fourteen days. a total of 21 hours. The first half-hour per day is to be spent in fundamental drill, the next hour for the fi1•st four days in dummy scrimmage. the next ten days in scrimmage. Captain W. E. Young's business for thirty years was shark fight- ing above and below the seven seas. \Shark! Shark!\ is his ac- count of many adventurous tussles with the marine I\azor-tooth. A professional contributes to the steadily increasing stock of shark lore. Donald Cullross Peattie's \Alma-- nac for Moderns\ takes a well earned place in the long line of distinguished contributions from the literary naturalists, and re- minds us that Gilbert White's \Natural History of Selborne\ W. H. Hudson's \:Hind in Richmond Park.\ and the works of Thoreau, John Bvrro1;1.ghs, Richard Jefferies and John Muir stilL make absorb- ing and exciting reading. The sec- ond volume of selections from Wil- liam Brewster's journal, ••()()noord River'' is a painstaking and beau- tiful de~cription of all the well known and rarer .birds of the New England countryside. David Fairchild's ''Exploring for Plants\ is a record of scientific ad- venturing in the tropics frem West Africa to Java. Fairchild is a traveller-scientist sufficiently free of the purely technical o11tlook. A common impression seems. to prevail that trees are plants which generally do not produce flowers. Walter E. Rogers in a large, hand- somely illustrated volume called \Three Flowet's\ does a convincing jo·b of dispelling this misconcep- tion. John Mills in a \fugue in Cycles and Bels,\ considers the re- lations between science and music, !1-nd speculates on what. electrical discove.ries will add to the music of the future. * .. * Vermo11-t University's tennis team will play a twelve ma.tch sche·dule this year. Six of the net contests will be played at horne, six on the road. The season for the Cata- mounts will open April 21 with a match at Worcester and -will end on Memorial Day. This year Ver· mont plays Union at Schenectady on May 6. * * .. The Hamilton track team has rather poQI' prospects this year with only two lettermen returning from last year's squad. Coach Winters is employing the method of indices, previously used at the University of Iowa, in judging the relative strength of his candidates. There seems to be a d'efinlte correlation between an athlete's index and his actual performance. Dalton, Dodge, Soper, Bramley, Kellogg, and Pow· er are Continental traekmen to be reckoned with this s-eason. Union faces Hamilton in track on May 5 at Clinton. .. * * * Despite rumors to the <Jontrary next yea1's bowling season won't run, much longer than the one just finished. The expenses involved would be too heavy on the keglers. Incidentally, a te>ta.l of 148 students teok ]Jar t · in this year's railings. * We learn from Bill Ketz that the new handball court is provina very popular. It is in use each day steadily frorn 1:30 to 6:00, and gam~s are often arranged for the morning. If you haven't seen it yet, you w~mt to take a look. It's quite the stuff. And if you :z1eed a partner, Henry Seider, the big fellow in the Idol picture, will take you on any time. • Plan on attending the Block \U\ Din11er this year. It comes on March 30. The committee 'In charge is wo,rking hard and promises an unusual program. It should be well worth your while. Lacrosse activity will not get un- derway for the 1938 season until next week when Coach Bill Hat k- ness is expected to Ieturn fr:om Florida where he has spent the winter. .As soon as he arrives, it is likely that indoor work on fundamentals will take up the time of the candi· dates as long as the cold weather ~ontinues; but as soon as the balmy days of spring al'!'ive. the players will resort to outdoor activity. The date of Monday, March 7, has been set for the call of fresh- man for the candidates of the la- crosse team, which will also be coached by Mr. Harkness who is re- placing Frederic A. Wyatt as year- in_g mentor. Mr. Wyatt, however, Will probably help Harkness in the preliminary coaching work. The meeting will be held in the trophy room of the gymnasium. Time Marches on and around the middle of the month Carnival ~==============-, Night, climax of the winter intramural sports, will be staged. Finals in II 1 Basketball \21 boxing, wrestling, and fe11cing will be run off then. A INTRAMURAL$ feature that might add interest this year w~l1ld be a little set-to between I our varsity five and Art La\vrence's champio<Jnship all-intramural quintet. 1:.;;;;;=============-d..' * * We think one of the reasons why Union is not widely known in ath- letic ,circles is the fact that it does not, as a rule, send its athletes to intercollegiate competition:s. I's true that we enter men in the I. C. 4A cross-country meet each yeai' and occasionally in other events v.rhen \v·e have particularly outstanding athletes, but all in all we are not regularly represented in these all-college affairs. We are invited, though, time and again. We believe that eve-n if our men pla<eed last•in every event, parti- cipation would be worthwhile.

In an announcement <lisclosed today by Jaclt Nott, '38, chairman· of the campus function, Schenec- tady's Station WGY and its inter- national short-wive unit, W2XAF, will pick up the music of the Hud- . son-De Lange band for a half-hour program some where between mid- night and one o'clock. No definite time has been selected as yet, since negotiations are also underway to. broadcrust the proceedings at the ball over the national hookup of 'the NBC network, an attempt be- ing made to do so either between 12 and 12:30 or 12.:30 and 1 o'clock. Heading several novelty attrac- tions planned will be the choosing of a \Favorite of the Ball,\ the most attractive feminine guest in attendance, mostly by a student committee with the aid of a simi· Jar faculty group. The committee bas intimated that only a short while remains before the price of the dance, lowered to three dollars from the original quotation of $3.30, will be raised. \The quicker the tickets are sold, the better the dance will be for all,\ Nott has stated. ln this con· nection it was added that the tick· ets are believed to be the most unique ever printed for a college function, with the face along dis· tinct modernlstlce designs printed on special paper flown to Schenec- tady f.rom a qOD-mile distance.

Thursday, Mar. 3-A gr<lup of eight seniors today indicated that they would be willing to take out insm ance policies to start a system of class endow- ment funds according to the plan outlined Tuesday morn- ing by President Winte1 ton U. Day. This group lepretlented one-half of the number ·of sen- iors who declared they would be willing to subscribe to the endowment plan on the ques- tionnaire turned in last Tues- day. Statring today the campaign will formally begin to solicit each senior individually. The men who met with the repre- sentatives of the insurance company, Henry Gulnac and Douglas Smith, '34, are E. Aug- ust LaWJence, Herman. Kessler, Victor Cohen, Armand A. Cam- marota, Richard Angle, John J. Hardiman, G. Edward Otis, Robert Denzler, P1eston T. Reed, Hyman A. Enzer, and Winterton Day. On the suggestion .of Otis a tentative plan has been anang- ed to have each fraternity meet with an insurance agent some night within the next three weeks to get more convenient individual discussions. The sen- iols of the Theta Delta Chi fraternity have arranged a meeting next week when they can talk more privately with Mr. Smith on personal problems concerning the taking out of insurance. Play Class Giving \Coriolanus 15 .. 16 Modern Dress, No Scenery Features Shakespeare Vehicle William Shakespeare's \Corio- lanus\ is the second production of \social significance\ for the college Play Production Class, which will be presented Tuesday and Wednes- day night, March 15 and 16, in Mountebanks Theatre. Dr-. Harold W. Blodgett's Course 21 in the Drama of Shakespeare is working in conjunction with the class to produce the play. The contemporary version of \Coriolanus\ will be unique in three days. Whereas the regular version has been somewhat unpopular be- cause of its length, 28 scenes, it is now being reduced t() 1'5 scenes. Also, the drama becomes a vehicle of social importance when put into modern costumes and uniiorms re- sembling those of the Faclst regime. Orson Welles' \Julius Cae·sar,\ cur- rently playing in New York City, makes use of the same technique of dress. The staging of the play is radically removed from the modern conceptions. The old Elizabethan forestage is being resorted, mean- ing that the whole theater will be a stage, and the audience will be considered as actually sitting on the .same plans as the actors. Student Majority Favor:J Insurance Large Percentage of 279 Students :~oting Willing To Subscribe to E ndowmell-t Plan Tuesday, :Mar. 1.-The 1~esults of the poll taken today in daily assembly to determine how many students would be willing to subscribe to the plan for class endowment insur- ance sl10wed that a majority of the voting students favored the plan. Almost 40 per cent of the 279 students who voted declared that they would be willing to take out insurance with the college as beneficiary of the first accumulated dividends up to ~1()0 <>JL a $1.,000 life insurance policy. About 26 per cent indicated that they \Were still uncertain. The 1emainder, about 34 per cent, answered no to th'€ question, although many said they would be willing to subscribe later. l'fndercla.sses Give Strong Support The largest number of affirmative answers oea.me from tl:e freshman and sophomore classes in which 50 per cent ·of the voting studen.ts gave positive replies. A total of 77 sophomores and 85 freshmen voted. Only 48 members of the junior class turned in the questionnaire, 30 per cent of whom said yes. There were 68 seniors who r-eplied. Many valuable student comments on the plan were received. Repr·e- sentative of the statements were these three ~:>pinions: \Inasmuch us the student's beneficiaries get most of the :benefit in case of death, it seems little enough to do this for one's Alma M.ater.\ \While this plan does not give the college a.J1Y' great total am<>unt in any year, it can be able to supply a regular yearly fund which could go a long way in improving the college.\ \I am preparing for graduate school and at least for- the nex:t three years will be unable to bear any financial responsibility. However, I approve of the plan.\ Very few students indicate that they did not ucnderstand the J)roposal as outlined by senior class president Winte1·t()n U. Day, but such en- couraging suggestions were made as: \'The plan needs further explanation to smal.l groups where details can be discudsed.\ Some students wanted to know to :what uses .the endowment would be put, whether larger individual poli<:les with g1•eater benefices to the college could be made, and whether alternate plans for raising funds could be used. Alternate Plans Being Consiclered Nothing but general discussion of the uses oE such a fund has been held by the Student Council. Larger policies wit.h additional provisions for the college can be taken out. In answer to the third question, there is ll'<> compulsion on the stu- dents to ta\{e insurance with any one company, but the Council is aware of the need for unifo1mity to give tlle plan real force. Consider- ation of other plans, however, is being made and .an alternative to the present proposal may be offered to tho uadergr·ad uate body. Almost all of the comments on the questionnaire were seriously made by the students. Only one student said he wa.s ·•entirely against the whole thing.\ Other skeptics said that \one c!Winot predict the status of insurance companies 15 years hence.\ Others blamed the \recession that is on us\ and \present conditions a.s reasons for not supporting tile plan. Another critic said: \I fall to see why sach a plan is necessary. We pay for the cDllege while we are here. It is up to the individual to say whether he contributes.\ But such statements were rare. Favoring the plan were such argu- ments: \It is a means of raising much-needed money without heavy burden on a few loyal alumni.'' \The <:ollege has helped me to get my educa.thn through the Wolfe Schola1·ship. I am willing, on graduation t() belp the college in any reasonable way.\ \Unqualified approval. It involves no special ·sacrifice on my part.'' \I am carrying fmternity insurance, but I am more than willing to take out another policy on such a plan. Tl::e endowment will succeed if the entiro student body supports it.\ A student with $2,500 of insurance said: \Far the amount put into each policy each year the benefits are remarlta.ble.'' \After college we have much to pay, bllt even so I should be wilting to take out such insurance.\ (Tr.is student sa.id he was already obli- gated with fraternity insurance.) \Perhaps deserving students would be al>le to receive help rather than some of the types receiving aid now.\ A strong argument advanced by a freshman was: \An employer would be more willing to employ a inan whQ llas foresight enough In his future to insure his life.'' Another first-year man said: \A little ex:tra Insurance is good to have and I am willing to share its proceed::..\ Perhaps most ex.pressive was the statement: \YES if I graduate.\ U. C. C. A.

Schulberg ---=-=-=-~====================== Friday, March 4, 1938 REAL ENCOURAGEMENT The results of the questionnaire which less than one half of the student body re- plied to this week concerning the method for increasing the endowment fund through class insul'ance plan proved unusuaHy satisfactory. Almost all who answered believed they understood the plan and a very high major- ity indicated that they would be willing to take out insurance as outlined by th€ pro- posal. It is not too healthy to be optimistic over such results, but the seriousness with which many of the students replied to the questions gives justifia:ble cause to believe that the in- surance plan is at least getting some thought. The pril1cipal reasons offered by students for not taking out insurance now were these three: 1. Insecurity of financial status for im- mediate future, either because stude·nts have no definite :prospects for jebs or are plan· ning to go to graduate school. 2. Inability to take on more insurance be- .cause of other insurance holdings. 3. Desire for alternate plans to pxovide for more convenient forms of payment. Among several of the other objections were alleged high rates for .premium.s, too long a period for payment, too small a pro· vision for the college and request for com- pulsory fo1•m .of insurance. The problems of questions one an-<! two can be answered only by individual who is considering taking out a policy. Yet it is very sig11ificant to note that almost half of the seniors and some unde1·classmen who said they would be willing to take ortt poli- thel . 1 · 11 v·eStiUellt Ol' estab'll'ohment of ocholai·- ful D., L.H.D., Litt.D., LL.D~, D.C.L., \Capehai't\ South College-ers are \ \ k 1 .Presi''ent of Union College, w. e getting a liberal musical education; wrec , f oppy \ h h ships, or physical enlal'ge-tnent. and slopp)·, Holy Heck!

In addition to his specific reply to the editorial on Spencer Lectures which appeared in last issue he has written a complete sta.temeRt on the va- ri.ety of lecture possibilities at Union and the extent to which they have been accepted by the students. His letter follows: May I compliment you on yom<!•t----------------- editorial on The Spencer Lectures which appeared in Friday's issue? It brings up the kind of question which should be constantly before us and comments upon it with good tem- per and good sense. As I understand your argument it is that the desig- nation Spencer Lecturer should be reserved for visiting university pro- fessors or those of the same general kind and quality, though other lec- turer without that title should be welcomed. I think it is a practicable distinction and one that we might draw more carefully. Unfortunately, for our public lec- ture program we have an annual budget item of only three hundred dollars. This is not only a small sum but smaller than it should be, T fear, on strictly ethical grounds. The amount of money given by the Spencer heirs many years ago yields a return larger than that, but in the depression that we began to experience at the beginning of this decade the stated yield was cut to that figure and the balance applied to fundamental educationa.l 1ecessities in the class-room pro- gram of the College. This consti- tutes one of the very few slight and temporary trust diversions which the Trustees found neces- sary in the emergency- a far smaller number than would be found in most college budgets- and we hope bettering circumstances will provide more money for lec- tures. As it is, some of them are paid for out of the President's Emergency Fund, a small sum of which is expected to care for every- thing not pre-calculated in the bud- get. On this also falls the cost of advertising all these free lectures. Honorary Fellows Help Several years ago it was the cus- tom for va.tious departments to nominate a total of three SpE'ncer Lecturers for the year, it being ex- pected, or at least hoped, that each speaker would make one additional appearance in the classroom. 'rhey were, for the most part, professors in other institutions. The need fm thi.s sort of academic ministration is now somewhat less, because of our institution of honoraty fellows. It may have been remarked that their official visits have not come this year so far, except in the case of Dr. Walter G. Kellogg, but they have not been forgotten. Those of Mr. Arthur Pound, Mr. Clayton Hamilton, Dr, Frank P. Graves, Mr. Sheldon Cheney and Dr. Tyler Den-· nett have been arranged for the £.n- suing weeks. Dr. Irving Langmuir will spend a considerable amount of time on the campus in the imme- diate future. The untimely death of Mr. George Daley prevented nis fulfilling an elaborate program of appointments here last month. Un- fortunately, Dr. Henry S. Canhy':o calender will probably prevent his appearan<!e here this year, though correspondence with him, running over several months, has not yet. been closed. The Honorary Chancellor's special visit ls well remembered. When I talked with hi min New York last Thursday he expressed the inten- tion of returning for another visit about the first of May. Up to three years ago it was the practice of the College to rent its halls to cer.tain reputable organi- zation for lectures or concerts. That is still done in some instances, especially where the organ is in- volved. But as an alternative ar- rangement now, still carefully con- sidering the quality of instruction or entertainment to be offered, we permit the organi!lation. to have the hall, on the consideration that our students may be admitted without charge on showing their athletic tickets. Under class Competition Announced for Soplwrnore And Junior Idol Boards An open competition for next year's sophomore and junior hoards was decided upon and two juniors . recommended for addition to the present junior board at an Idol Board meeting held Friday, :Editor Edson V. Draper announced. James C. Wade and John M. Malone, both of Schenectady, are the two jun- iors chosen. Rules for Competition The competition, open to all un- derclassmen, will be directed to- ward the discovery of the literary ability, the critical acumen, and above all, the initiative, which are the prime characteristics of a good editor. 'Therefore, every candidate will be required to submit either an odginal contribution, taking the form of a story, essay, poem, or even photograph, on which his own met it may be judged; ot a con- ,;tructive criticism of the Idol, de- tailing what is wrong with the mag- azine at present and what specific measures the candidate, if an edi- tor, would take to bring about im- provement. His critical ability will be judged on this basis. Preferably, the candidate should submit both critique and contribu- tion, but in order that individuals who have little literary ability but much editorial sense may have a chRnce, the former alone will re- ceive plenty of consideration. The above, plus personal talks, if possible, with present Board members, will constitute the entire scope of the competition. All can- didates should submit entries to Editor Draper, other board mem- bers, or Pwfessor Blodgett, faculty adviser, before Friday no(}n, March 25.

The an n u a 1 Concordiensis questionnai:t:e will be submitted to the student body tomorrow morning in daily assembly, A faculty questionnaire will also be given at the same time in the various offices. These should be returned to the Concordien- sis by campus mail. This year, The Concordiensis, in addition to asking the usual questions on what is wrong with the paper and how it could be improved, asks each student a series of general quest i o n.s centering around the functions and activi- ties of the college. Several .of the questions that will be printed in the question- naire will require some previous thought by the students, if the desired results are to be obtain- ed. In consideration of this fact, several of the questions are in- cluded at the end of this arti- cle. Please read them carefully so when the questionnaire is distributed tomorrow, you will ·be able to cover them conclu- sively as well a.s intelligently. The following are some of the questions: What .suggestions do you have for the more efficient and interesting cover age of the Concordiensis? What source of news has not been sufficiently coveted in the Con- cordiensis? Educators Discuss Secondary Schools Shte Principals' Society Meets With Fox: at Hale House Monday, Mar. 7 - Twenty-five leading secondary school adminis- trators held on ali-day conference in Hale House lounge today on \Outstanding Issues of Secondary Education\ and heard suggestions that would radically alter the pres- ent public school system. Speakers at the conference, spon- sored by the Associated .Academic Principals of New York State, were Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox, Dr. C. Currien Smith, professor of education at New York State Teachers College, and Dr. Goodwin Vvatson, profe.s- s·or of education at Teachers Col- lege, Columbia. President Fox suggested that a fiffh year be added to the college eurriculum for the benefit of stu- dents who avoid secondary ~chool teaching becaru=e it re<J,uires devo- tion of one-quarter of their aca- demic career to teaching courses. Dr. Smith, criticizing the secon- daty school \for it.s tendency towa1d smugness and complacency,\ urged that \some provi.sion be made for five million maladjusted youth who are wandering about in a state of befilderment and disillusionment.\ What suggestions do you offer: for the improvement of The Idol?· Is the Library being run efficient-: ly?

Dr. Black Speaks On Ideals of Freedom Sunday, March 6--\ 'Tis for free- dom that Christ set us free,\ said the Rev. Hugh Black of Montclair, N. J, in the Sunday Cha:pel Serv- ise this morning. Dr. Black cited as the Ch1istian principles to which we must ad- here in order to find freedom, the faith to live an individual life, the strength to avoid the influence of intolerable public opinion, and sense enough to obey the laws of health, truth, life, and love. \Whatever liberty and freedom that man has now is the achieve- ment of the ages, not the natural heritage of the 'state of man',\ Dr. Black declared. \We can no longer revert to the romantic myth of the free and no- ble savage to explain why we a•re or should be free, for the sa va.ge wa.q himself a slave to taboos and superstitions. \But to find the ideal freedom we must seek the answer in the Chris- tian life which calls fo.r an in- dividual who can maintain an in- dependence of thought and yet live in complete unison with other be- ings,\ tlle. speli\k\lr ..,~jc!, \Dictatorships hate Christianity because it searches deeply f01 free- dom,\ continued Br.

Invitations to the brawl a1e be- ing issued this week to friends and critics of The Concor diensis and its staff. Heavy Villain Role Open in •u nder the Gas Light' Three Bodies The revised constitution, as it now stands, calls for three different governing groups: 1. the student body which is comparable to the voting populace; 2. the student coun- cil which is comparable to an as- sembly of representatives elected by group one; and, 3. an executive council elected by the student coun- cil and subordinate to it, Group one will meet tluee times a year; group two six times (or ap- proximately once a month); and group three will meet when the large representative body does not meet. The genctal counc.il will be com- posed of about 40 students nomi- nated and elected by four different \parties.\ The first of the.se will be automatically elected to the conncil: the presidents of each class. The second are the selected tepresenta- tives for each tax-supported activity. Organizations such as The Con- cotdiensis, Glee Club, Radio Club, College Christian Association, etc., wilt elect one representative apiece to serve on the council.

Mountebanks Feature SemiaRealism In Prison .Sets for 'Criminal Code' T1vo conce-rts by the glee c'lub, a danC'e with music by the Ga.rnet Goblins, and an organ r;ecital by Dr. Elmer A. Tidmarsh featured the glee club trip to Binghamton last week-end. The club, together with Dr. Tidmarsh and the re- cently revived Goblins, left the campus Saturday noon. Arriving in B.inghamton about three o'clock, they were g.reeted by membees of the Theta Sigma Sorority, who act- ed a.s hostesses for the visitrn·s. Affiliations will be placed on the ballots, but any students may vote for any men-with the previous un- derstanding that only a certain number from each group will be put on the Council. Thus, if the ratio is 4 to 3 for fraternity men, and six fraternity men have higher votes than any of the neutrals, only the highest four of the fraternity men will be elected and the highest three neutrals, and vice-versa. Editor's Note: Designing the sets for The Mountebanks sec- ond production of the year \Criminal Code,'\ has involved considerable effort because of the variety of scenes in Martin Flavin's drama. o·f prison life. A descriptive account of how the sets have been drawn and why has been written for The Concordiensi.s by the designer. By GEOR.GE HART The set .designs for the social epic, \Criminal Code,\ to be pre- sented by the Mountebanks March 25, 2&, and 28, have incorporated realism· only as fas as necessary and practicable for stage business. Stage properties consist of the es- the thought that in any case a stimulated imagination is stronger than the actual object. The play opens in the modern- istic off.ice of the District Attor- ney, bright compared to the som- ber sets to follow, but rendering a grim note in the suggestion of the prison bars to come by the filter- ing of light through venetian blinds on the set. This foregoing suggestion of prison is comple- mentary to the celerity with which the unfortunate hero, Robert Gra- ham, is taken mercilessly from a night club brawl, through the me- chanics of the uncompromising law to his confinement .in the state penitentiary. Here he learns. to re- spect the Criminal Code as he had the code of the society that ostra- cized him. At &:00, the group went to the Masonic Hall, where the club set·- enaded the Binghamtonians, 'With Kenneth Streeter and Charles Berger taking the spotlight w.ith sev1n·a1 solo numbers. A verv re- spollsive audience greeted the club's <Sfforts spontaniously, and the skit, \Union's Big :Broadcast\ receiv:ed much applause, Executive Comtcil The executive council will be composed of seven men: the chair- man of the Student Council, the secretary of the Student Council, one member from each of the above four \parties\ elected by their rep- resentatives on the Student Coun- cil; the chairman of the Student Tax Committee and the coordinator of student aetivities, who will also be a non-voting member of the Stu- dent Council. No duplication of representation will be permitted any individual or group and in order to facilitate elections the various \parties\ will elect at different times-sometime before Moving Up Day exercises this year.

Peck Tllesdaty, March 8, 1938 QUESTIONNAIRE To facilitate the answering of some of the questions whit2h will be asked in itr> poll tomorrow in daily assembly, The Concordien- sis i·s publish:iug· :some of its queries in to- day's issue. Students are mged to look them over carefully-on the f1·ont page--and be prepm·ed with some careful answers. Questions sucll as ''What changes should be ma.de in the faculty and administrative staffs of the college a.nd why~, will :permit many students to g·i ve vent to their feelings on individualmenbers of the college without the responsibility of haviiJg their 11ames attached. Under coveT of anonymity we expect that some students will take unfair advantage of their position and m.ake criticisms which may be unjustified. However, the question \why\, we hope, will act as a guide to in- telligent app-raisal ()f individual faculty members and others. Sug-gestions as io the improvement of The Concordiensis a.nd The Idol h.ave been a.sked and we expect that there should be many of thos.e if students could only organize their comments befo1·e hand. Lack of time does not permit our asking specific questions about the college departme11ts, such as .publi- city, placement after and during undergrad- uate work, a11d the Graduate Council. But some :pertinent roemad<S about the Hbrary, student tax, Hale :House, daily assembly and student activities will be solicited. The faculty at the same time will be given another questionJiaire and in addition to f'>UCh s<>l\ious questions as \Should a larger freshman class Le adm.itted each fall and re- quirements for mm1ai11ing in college be made stricter?\ such qu.estions as ••What else have you done for a living besides teach 7 and \Do you like acaden~ic processions?\ will be asked. longer thc1e ... the two Syract1se me·nl Bureau; of evening lectures Stanley Woodward, su~cessor tc Daley as debators who spent the week-end . the finest short subject in many. by our own staff, especially in some l ..J't f th H l'd· 1 , - 1 , '!] b on the cam.pus were duly initiated years, you might profitably count of the clubs, all open to the inter- spor ~ e'lll Ol' o e era · · lT~UIIe, Wl e b;· some of our Union l>ids.

Preston High Scoref' Preston, a transfer from Ohio University, and Fazioli were the heroes of this last ditch drive. In the space of less than a minute Fazioli hammered in two of the most brilliant baskets made on the Alumni floor-. The first was a tow- ering set shot from beyond mid- court; the second was a running one bander from the corner. Pres- ton's long set shots and left band- ers gave him fourteen points for high scoring honors. \Vatson and Millei' Outsta.nding Close behind Preston were Herb Watson and George Miller, sopho- more forwards. Watson .three in four baskets in fi,ve minutes in the first half, and tacked on t\vo more in the second half. Miller, who had been way off the mark in the first half opened and tossed three short set efforts before accmulating his fourth personal foul. Smith Stars All the Union scoring was done in individual spurts. Besides Miller and Watson, Charley Wiberly had a three basket string in the first half. The real star of the game from a Union point of view was Captain Grant .Smith, Smith scored sii points and did yeoman service on rebounds until he aggravated an elbow injury- and had to leave the game, George Doyle, the remaining Garnet starter, starred defensively and helped to steady the sometimes jerky Union offense. The victory left Union with a record of five victories and nine defeats in the toughest schedule a Nicthman-coached five ·had ever played.

AMERICA'S OUTSTANDING YOUNG ELECTRICAL ENGINEER DR. CHAUNCEY GUY SUITS, research physicist of the General Electric Research Laboratory, in Schenectady, has been named by Eta Kappa :'ol\n honorary electrical engi- neering fraternity, as the outstanding ymmg electrical engineer for 1937. Rom in Oshkosh, Wisconsin in 1905, Dr. Suits attC>nded the University of Wisconsin and grad- uated from the Technischc Hochschule in Zurich, Switzerland (Sc.D. •29). An ardent skier, he spends most of his spare time on the snowy slopes around upper New York State. but also finds time to indulge in woodworking. amateur photography. and pla}ing a clarinet. As a member of the Research Laboratory staff, his work has beeu on the fundamentals of elec- tric arcs, showing bow arc temperature can be measured hy sound, and it was for lhis work that the Eta Kappa Nu award was given him. Other activities for which Dr. Suits is noted include the investigation of nonlinear circuitR, high-pressure arcs, and the development of automatic tuning for radio veceivers. LasL year the award was given to Frank M. Starr, U. of Colorado '28, G-E Test •29, who is employed in the Central Station Engineering Department of General Electric. The Test Cour8c, of which Starr is an ali.lmnlls, provides a practical edueation supplementary to the theoretical knowledge obtaittcd in college. GENERAL#j ELECTR!2

Dur- ing his four years in college he played on the freshman football team and for three years on the varsity sq_uad, as guard and tackle. Among the games in which he took part was that against Union Col- lege in the fall of 1916. when he played opposite Hal Wittner. Am- herst was defeated. Woodward played fo0tball with such enthusiasm that he underwent eleven major operations for Injuries suffered on the gridiron. He became noted fo1· playing while wearing his glasses, which he succeeded in do- ing by wearing a special mask.

Thursday, Mar. 1D-By a close two-thirds vote the Union College Student 1.,ouncil finally okayed the functional form of student govern- ment and passed a constitutwn which has been considered since eal'ly Ja,;t September. A year ago last December the functional fm m of student govern- ment was suggested and brought befme the Student Council. Atter one public discu;;sion on the sys- tem the enUre plan was put into committee and then forgotten. This summer Vilmar K. !:lose, '38, dratted a constitution along lines which had been ;;uggested by van- ous member·s of the outgomg coun- cil and other students. l::lis proposeu a.IticJes v.er e immediately taken up by the present Council concunently wtth the specific .recommendations made by .!:\resident Winterton U. Day in a speech in daily a.,;.,;embly. Avoid Committee Action Each article in the constitution was talten up individually by the en tier council, for as· Day expressed it, \putting the constitution into committee meaJJ..S !tilling it.\ The second half of evety Council meet- ing was devoted to consideration of various articles and meetings were called once every week while col- lege was in regular session. Since the Council was first or- ganized in 1933 there have never been more than 14 meetings for the entire years. Today's meeting was the 17th of the year and two more months yet remain. For the next three weeks, before the Spring \Vacation the active campaign will be continued with a minimum of 25 per cent of the sen- ior class set as the goal for that time. Since ttze balloting in daily assembly last week represented less than half o:f the entire student body, many of the undergraduates have not ye't indicated whether they would support the insurance plan. The plan calls for at least a ~1,000 life insurance ]Jolicy with provision that first dividends up to $100, which accumulates Ln about 17 years, be donated to the colleg.e. This sum represents· pure accumulation of interest and is not deducted from any money which is put into savings on the insurance policy. Any underclassmen or seniors who desire to ,take out insurance policies on this benefit system for the college have been requested to get in touch with Hyman Enzer at Silliman Hall at any time.

Precedent Established Lon Barringer Is Chosen Editor-in-Chief Of Idol \Vednesday, March 9 - Meeting this afternoon the publications board unaminou.sly elected Fred- eric W. Hequerobourg, '39, of Rem- sen, editor of The Concordiensis for the coming year and Lon H. Barringer, '39, -of Charleston, W. Va., editor of thG Idol. Also elect- ed to the senior board of the Con- cordy were Robert Walter, Jr., of Detroit, Mich., managing edito:·, Robert Saaf of Schenectady, news editor, H. Wyman Hitchcock of Cambridge, N. Y., copy editor, and Jerome Smith of Albany, sports editor. Take Control Immediately The new staff will take over con- trol of the paper immediat<'ly al- though the retiring editors will con- tinue to serve In an advisory ca- pacity until the end of the year. The new junior board of the pa- per will be made up of Christopher Fahy, of Newport, R.

Mr. Wyatt pointed out that be· cause the Sub-Freshman Weekend falls during the Spring recess ~~ roost of the preparatory and high schooLs, a record number of pros- pective students ate expected to avail themselves of the oppottu- nity t~ see Union College in its various \normal\ aspecl.s. He e:r:n- phasized that this character of the Sub-Freshman program is espe- cially appreciated by headmasters who want their students to choose a college intelligently. Mr. Wyatt also announced that 115 alumni living in 20 different states, Washington, D. C., and Can- ada, are representing the College Admissions' office in their terti- tories, interviewing prospective •stu- dents. :Mr. Melchior requests the an- nouncement that this concert is given to Union College in compli- ment to Mrs. Walter C. Baker, by 'vhose devoted interest in the col- lege he has been constantly im- pressed. At a meeting held with Mrs. Fox last evening, the Terrace Council appointed Frederick B. Hawley, '38, to take care of the general ar- rangements for the concert. If a sufficient number of students in- vite guests from Skidmore or Russell Sage Colleges, there is a possibility that bus transportation will be provided. The Interfraternity Council met yesterday afternoon lo cot1sider the possibility of social functions in the various fraternity houses preceding the concert, and also for the distribution of tickets to fraternity men. A committee of neutrals is being forme<i to take care .of the tickets for the non- fraternity men. They may also ob- tain tickets from the members o,f the Terrace Council. Mrs. Jenkins ln. the book store will have charge .of ticket& for the faculty.

Despite a revolt in the Council which almost overthrew the func- tionalplan after it had been worked over for foUr months a committee was selected to work over the final articles. The report of that commit- tee last night was approved to- gether with the other articles which had been voted upon une·by-onc.

At deadline, although nothing definite could be staled about The Coricordiensis Student Poll, several illuminating facts had been dis- closed in the answers to the Fac- ulty questionnaire. For example, the average Union faculty\member is reluctant to reveal his age; spends his summers studying-, \resting traveling, staying on campus; isn't quite sure wheth:r or not he approves of acadenuc processions. He is not in favor of increased armaments and believes that an armament pro.gram does not help the financial co.ndition of a country. He attends the movies infrequently. He believes Hale House food should be served warmer, and Hale House prices re-- duced, but that there should be \less belly-aching about it in the paper.\ New Coneordy Board Meets For First Time He made his debut in the role of Silvio in: Bajazzo at the Royal Opera in Copenhagen in 1913.

J.\Iay I wisl'l the new staff the best of luck in all it unde1takes, and express the hope thnt the Concordi will have an acc'l!rate, hard-hitting editorial policy and plen.ty of interesting news next year.

It's an easy matter to bequeath to it the headaches and th.os>€ late nights befo-J!e the issue that are part of put~ ting out the paper. But it's harder to give up the pleasant aspects: the bull ses.sions, the compan.ionsbip, and-well, the who-le ex- perience. It's b.een a lot of work but great fun. If the new board has taken to heart all the good advice the retiring seniors. have given in th>€ past, The Concordiensis will be good next year. And it undoubtedly will ·be.

Carry on, fellows, but not too much. Henry D. Hartmann COMMENDATORY COMMENT Wherever Union College gets the good fortune to IJe honored by a private concet·t given by one of the country's most popular opera singers, it is certainly to be blessed. Within. less than two weeks the college will have an opportunity to hear Lauritz l\lelchoir in the Memorial Cl'lapel as a gift to the members of the college from Mrs. Walter C. Baker and Mr. Melchoir.. Tickets will be distributed free to all students and their guest.s by all fratem.ities and the Terrace Council, and we expect that the Memorial Chapel will be filled to overflewing on March 23 as Union goes to another party. \' 'f. :;. The Interfraternity Ball on March 18 ex- emplifies the spirit of cooperation which has moved all fraternities on and off the campus to diseard their private parties on that night for one big social event. With a name band of the calibre of Hud- son and DeLange to provide the music and every student, fraternity man and neutral, realizing the importance of such a breaking down of the so-called social barriers, the dance should be a great success. We con- gratulate the Fratemity Council for its fine aims and achievements and in final editorial parting say-we'll see you at the Ball.

These parleys, which consist of a series of speeches and roundtable discussions, are sponsored by the college body of Wesleyan. The sub- ject for discussion this year was \Higher Education in a Democ- racy.\ Several prominent educators as \veil as men outstanding in other fields addressed the parley-. The prlncipll.l address was given by Henry :M. Wriston, President of Bl'Own University who stated that \The tiD!e for a revolution has come In liberal education,\ The majority of the educators agreed with this thought, but differed as to the form the revolution should take, some urging a return to the classics, while others emphasized the need for vocational training. It was generally agreed, how- ever, that underprivileged youths should be given an opportunity to attend college if they show latent ability, and that the state should aid In tl!is respect.

The play has been con- densed from twenty-eight to fifteen scenes in an attempt to heighten its dramatic effect and to retain the !;>est portions of Shakes}leare's poetry. .. In colorful, militant modern d-ress, the characters will appear with swords and other equipment hang- ing from their belt. As in Orson \Ve!letS' \Julius Caesar,\ there will be no sets and effect will be gained through unique lighting. The play is being produced in collaboration with Dr. Blodgett's c<>urse in Shakespeare.

The sub- ject for discussion this year was \Higher Education in a Democ- r·acy.\ Several prominent educators as well as men· outstanding in other fields addressed the parley.

De yo Friday, March 11, 1938 OUR GOAL We have assumed our responsibilities as editors of THE CONCORDIENSIS with a single guiding ideal, to make our policies confonn with the best interests of Union College. Other than this we have no defin- ite editorial policy. We do not expect that a college newspaper appearing twice a week can hope to be a medium for distributing sensational and \hot\ news. But we do expect to print an accul'ate and comp.Jete account of campus events that have a general news value to the college and its friends. Such a policy does not make it mandatory for us to print articles that in our opinion are better left unsaid. In other words, we will \print all the news that is fit to print.\ We desire THE CONCORDIENSJS to fur- nish a constructive social service to the col- lege. Through our €ditorial columns we will hold an open forum for the discussion of col- lege problems. Through this medium we will point out the faults of the college, as we s.ee them, and offer remedies for their correc- tion. We also desire that the faculty, admin- istrative officers, and student body will feel ft,ee to use our \In The Mail\ column at any time to present any criticism of our policies or any controversial subject mattel'. We do not want to be branded as a group of \rabble rousers\ b-ut if we feel that it is our duty to enlighten the college o.n some phase of college life, we will not hesitate to act. We do not desire to make enemies, but if we cannot present the facts without doing so, then we will suffer the penalty. Our motto will be: News fi·rst, last, and always. method.

INTRAMURAL MANAGERS The athletic depa1tment took a great step forward when it enlarged the scope of intra- mural athletics th1·ee years ago. This action followed the present trend of educational thought, a sound hody help-s to make a sound mind. The intramural cup competition ha:s now been in operation for over two Y.ears. Under this SJstem athletic com.petition is no longer restricted to the few members of the student body who participate in intercollegiate sports. Last year over 50% of the student body participated in at least one intramural event. A further manifestation of student inter:est in the intramural competitions is the practice of each dormitory and fraternity group selecting one of its group to act in the capacity of manage1· of intramural activities. These men are charged with the responsi- bility of looking out fm the best interests of their individual gl'Oups. It appears that the athletic department has acted unwisely in not recognizing these 1nanagers as an offidal part ·Of the intra- mural program. No provision has ever been m.acle for each manager to be present when the \draws\ are made for individual or gToup pamngs. By not asking the group representatives to be present when the con- k'stants are formally paired, the intra.:mural head.s have left themselves wide open for criticism of unfair practices. This situation coukl easily be remedied by notifying each manager through THE CONCORDIENSIS or an announcement i11 daily assembly when a draw is to take place and request that they be present. Such a plan would completely protect the intramural department and at the same time please every fraternity and dormitory group. ...,,, ers who have graced the history of black and white.

THE CONCORDIENSIS, TUESDAY, MARCH 15, 1938 '38-' 39 Basketball Captain C()mm~ittee Probing New Cheer Policy On ·recommendation of Professor J. Harold Wittner, director of ath- letics, the Student Council last week appointed a committee of three students to inve13tigate possi- bilities of improving the organiza- · tion of cheerleading at Union Col- lege. The principal suggestion made to the Council was that cheerlead- ing be put in the control of the student government, rather than the athletic department where, re- portedly, it has been inefficiently. handled. H. Laurence Achilles, '38, chair- man of the Council's committee, made several recommendations, one being that only outstanding seniors be elected to positions as cheerleaders. However, other sys- tems will be considered. The other members of the committee are John S. Wold, '38, head cheerlead'er and David B. Miller, '39, also mem-· ber of the present cheerleading squad.

The victory places the Phi ·Sigs in a tie with the Lambda Chi A.lpha team for first place in the playoff matches. The final game for the title will be played tonight at 7:30 o'clock. The Phi Sigs eom]lletely outplay- ed their opponents in the first half, op.ening the game with nine points before the Neutrals were able to score on a foul shot. The Phi Sigs showed one of the best offenses and passwork seen in an intramural game this year anCl at the end of the first half were leading 20 to 6. In the second half the Neutrals be- gan to click and .in ten minutes held the Phi Sigs to five points while scoring 17 points for them- selves. In the last quarter the Phi Sigs staged a rally and held the Neutrals to two .foul shots to win, 34 to 25. Paul gained honors for scoring with 17 points and was followed by Schultz who garnered 11 points. Barbieri was high scorer for the Neutrals with 10 points and also played a good flo()r game, break- ing up many Phi Sig plays. Paul and Schultz wer-e the outstanding men on the floor- not only in scor- ing but also in setting up plays and in stopping the Neutral attaclc in the last quarter. The game, though rough, was une .of the best intet·fra.ternity contests seen on the gyxn floor this year. Both teams were cut to 'il'in and played a hard, fast and aggressive game to fill the contest with action and thrills.

Hamilton took back 264.8 pointo and Hobart trailed the meet with 240.8. Foil, Epee, Sabre Bouts To Be Staged 'Tonight Tonight at 8:00 p. m. the semi- final fencing bouts will be held in the handball room in the Gymnas- ium with five foil, four epee, and four sabre bouts being staged. The quarter-final matches were fought Thursday with Leonard Perless trouncing Feliciano Gon- zales, 5-1; Bob Herman beating Edward DeFeo, 5-2; Frank Mele- wicz elting out Stanley Gertz 5-4; Larry Schwartz blanking Bud Keough; Emanuel Dejnozka down- ing .John Bigwood, 5-2; and Schwartz defeating Melewicz 5-4. In the semi-final bout.s ten men will vie in the foil matches, eight in the epee, and seven in the sabre department. Of the list, Holmes, Schwartz, Hose Freire, Art Lawr- ence, Dejnozka, Frank Mele, Her- man, Myel' Ries, Warren Kimmey, and Ellis Eisenstein will handle the foils. Kimmey, Schwartz, De- Feo, Mele, Walker, Dejnozka, Freire and Max Len will wield the epees. In the sabre bouts Freire, Gertz, Bud Eisner, Keough, Dej- nozka, and Melewicz will partici- pate. The pa1ticipants are acting un- der the guidance of Coach Merton L. Zubres and the finals will take place Saturday, March 26 along with the boxing and wrestling finals. The intramural wrestling pro- gram g()t off to a good start last night as a large crowd watched fourteen elimination bouts held in the handball room. Two even bat- tles took place with Ken :MacKenzie beating <lUt Dan Braman and Hud Tanner subduing Garry Fuller in time advantage bouts. Defending champion Art Lawrence had a fair- ly easy job of flooring George Greg- ory. The grappling and pugilistic en- thusiasts are looking forward to Wednesday- when the first boxing bouts will be staged. The matches last night were run off during the Phi Sigma Delta-Neutral basketball game and this lessened the crowd that was expected to witness the bouts.

If we desire peace, we will have to do our part to maintain it. The Confe1·e·nce on World Econonuc Cooperation is thus worthy of more than passing notice. Only through such efforts can we hope to avoid a 1·epetition of the past World War. It is impe1·ative that we take precautions aga}nst war now, and not wait until it is upon us. OUR CHAMPIONS It 1s indeed gratifying to see a small group of students act on their own initiative to :pa1'ticipate in the name of Union College. This is the case with the unofficial Union College ski team composed of John Senn, '41, Claude Wiley, '38, Jack Bergstrom, '38, War- ren Gammons, '39, Donald· Klock, 'H, and Floyd Van Ladd, '38. You perceive, so I illLagine, that at present I employ a Style of writing sho,..,ing leanings toward a state of paranoia, Like a gaudy-painte-d canvas by Picasso or by Gcoya; And I need a double. pc:>rtion of a most efficient splenic, Which will cur-e m;y grand delu- sions and my pature schizo- phrenic. Well, to tell the tr~th. the Cider Mlll is wrestling: next week, And the prospect fo:1· a victory is very very bleak- So unless I get infected with am- nesia or aphasia, I will have to tal1e a tumble in the poorest of g:yi!Ulasia. Hence I've got to raise morale by just repeating aad repeating, With my m.ind upon a victory, and not upon a beating: I'm a rarln' tearin' ailimal from Dr. Fax's ZO(). I'm healthy as the best of them; I'm healthier tmaa you. Across the Footlights By ROBIDRT H. B'IDRGUSON Coi'ioirunJs I:'his matter of Hale House is getting boring. It no longer has sei:a.sational value. Yet if I were to give it up, never again to be dis- cussed in this column, I would tacitly admit that t:he only reason I criticized the commons in the first :place was to .-,ause comment and gain readers for the column. 'Dhis is not true . I was, and still atn, sincere in my belief that con-· ditions are awful and that the only sol-ution is the engagement of a new manager. Therefore, I will have to keep punching, until some concrete result of my criticism ap- pears. I will state my position in full with a letter to the editor in T.uesday's issue. 'The biggest story of the week, pertaining to beer. just to give you a hint, and also to columnists, is a dead story. H-ence there will be nothing on it herein. However, yo-u can notice for yourself that the Healthy Animal now roams on Ja.oie's grounds. So long, Bundgus. 'Tbte ()ider Mill, by couching its in- sults in obscure phraseology, makes sue to give no offense. 0 0 0 {'lh HDH, it's all right for you to pick a Fredonia N\ormal girl as the most beautiful in the Concordy Exchanges, and send her paper a notice to that effect-but to use News Bureau stationery, so that all (}Ver the papers of the United States the news was spread that it was Milton Enzer's choice-- th_at's going much too far. 'That's plenty. H. M.S. l'he Concordiensis on behalf of Union College extends a wam1 welcome to its In- terfmternity Weekend guests. We sincerely hope tha.t your short visit to our campus is l>oth happy and eventful, but above all we b.ope that the college as u whole creates a favorable and lasting impression upon one a.nd all Th.ese men without any aid from the col- leg-€ formed a ski team this past winter and participated in two intercollegiate meets. At the Saratoga Winter Carnival in January, they defeated Comell's second team, Syra- cuse, St. Lawrence, and R. P. I. Last Satur- day at Cold Brook, they won the New York State Intercollegiate Ski Championship by scori11g over Colgate, St. Lawrence, Ham- ilton, and Hobart. Tht•ir efforts have been rewarded by de- served outside publicity for Union College, but no-thing official has been accorded them by Union itself. Although they m·e not seek- ing :personal glory, an award of some kind would be in accord with their achievements. It also seems fitting to suggest that the C()Jlege Athletic Department make some provision to equip and train these men next year and incorporate the activities of the ski team into the winter sports schedule. Again the Play Production Course has g-iven us a drama \packed with political significance.\ Perhaps we're stUJlicL-but we'd like someone to explain the \timeless and timely\ signifLcance of this piece. Well, Shalt.espea.J:e has been accused of a lot. The timeless quality of Shakes- peare is his searchiD.g ana.lysis and portrayaJ of individual conduct- which doesn't mean \political sig- nificance.\ The \most significant note,\ to use our pet phrase, was the mod- ern dress presentation of this, one of Shakespear-e's .....,eaker efforts. In our humble opinii.on., despite the usual faltering atteoopts at makeup characteristic of the campus thea- tre, the use of moder:n dress was quite effective. 'f11e Interfraternity Dance Conm1ittee ande1· the efficient leadership of Jack Nott, '38, has worked conscientiously to make our first iillerfrat.ernity dance a success. A \big name\ l>and, Hudson-Delange, has been se- eured to play for this festive occasion in the gail.y decorated Alumni Gymnasium. Ar- ra11gements have als() been completed to i.Jmadcast part of the dJ:mce over a national and intel'national hook-up through the facil- ities of WGY and W2.)(AF. Several innova- tions to Union dancing parties ·have also i.J€en added by the C()mrnittee, which re- p<n:ted last night that the dance was a com- plete sell-out. In fact, indications can lead us to <mly one conclusion, a successful week- end is assured. MOTION The last time Arsene Lupin autographed some- body's safe for the silver sheets be was none othe1· than brother Jawn, of the Barrymore clan. Well, Arsene LuJlin Retw-ns, not as Mr. Barrie but as Mr. Douglas. :Melvyn's the name. Arsene has always had the French police up a figurative French tree, you know, so it's gratifying to learn that it takes a good old American detedive to put him in his place. War- ren William is the detective; Virginia Bruce is the girl; m. E. Clive and Nat Pendleton are Melvyn's associates; George Zucco is the French pollee; John Hallida.y and Monty Woolley are the rest of the cast; The forceful inte!\]lretation given several of the roles, rwtably those of Barringer, Steve][lson, and Day- ton, was thoro,ugllly enjoyable. But on the whDle, we thought the Shakespeare w-as po.:Jrly read. How- ever, that's only OILT opinion. Alone by the enthusiasm it arouses, as eviden~ed in. its pro- ductions, the drama cc:>urse should aid considerably in developing his- trionic talent at U' nion. The last two plays have p!-oduced several pieces of acting ex::tremely credit- able for amateurs. A little e:x:peri- ence in Union's Eamed :Mounte- ba.nlt.s should brh1g farth some polished studemt ac-tor.s.

As a result, Student Body Ptesident Winterton U. Day announced that another meeting at the student body will be held. one week from today. Following President Bay' .s open- ing remark in favor of the new doc- ument, Staniey Luke, '39, threw the fi.rst bombshell to destroy the pro- posed con.stitution when he charged that the continued practice of nom- inations by the Student Council is \undemocratic and he demand- ed that the constitution be reject- ed until this clause is amended. Donald Ford, '38, sup~rted the practice by claiming t·hat open nominations make for ••cteals.\ Luke retaliated with the state- ment that \the Student Council it- self ooalt.es the 'deals,'' and one clique will nominate ao.other for office.\ Frank Van Dyke, '39, took the floor at this point and aslted to have those members on the pres- ent Council who oppos~ the con- stitution to present the t\eas~ms for their opposition. John Krull, '40, stated that he felt the Council under the new con- stitution would be too large to be effective, The author of the constitution be- fore it was revised by the Student Council, Vilmar K. Bose, tushed to the defense of the eonstitution by saying that the new constitution was more representative. (Continued on Page 4·) Will Speak Thursday ALEXANDER 1\ERENSKY Kerensky, Russian Exile.

Peck Assistants Larry Pelletlier John Lewi::; Donald I Iaigh Tuesday, March 22, 1938 \OUR FRIENDS\ The old argument that only large colleges and univet·~itie·s can offer their students ex- tensive eul tum] anrl social oppot·tLmities will be disproven ag-ain tmnunow night, when :\11-. Lauritz :\lelchior, the Metropolitan Op- era Company's leading Wagnerian tenor, presents a. \g·ift\ concert in the Memorial Chapel. This is the second time in as many year::; that Union College has IJeen given the privilege of hearing one of the world's great- est voices. Lust _ye<.tl', l:nion College was given the oppo1·tunity of hearing anothet· famous :\letropolitan Opera singer, Mr. Fredrich Schorr. 1\lr. Schorr's concert was made pos- sible thl'ou~:h the generosity of the same two people who are sponsoring l\lr. 1\Ielchio!·'s visit to our campus, .i\h·. and l\Irs. Walter C. BakeL Union College is indeed fortunate to !)ossess such loyal friends. Their many gifts to Union College have been pxompted by no thqught of 1·ecompense other than that they be appreciated. It is therefore our duty to see that every seat in the Memorial Chapel is filled tommrow night. We'll ~ee you there! SUPERI<'ICIAL ARGUMENTS Like many other undergraduates, the Student Council is tired of hearing the con- stant stream of criticism that has been hurled against the present form of student govermnen t each year because of its ineffi- ciency in managing undergraduate affairs. Yesterday the C<>uncil presented its new functional constitution to the student body with the hope that it would be passed and thus terminate a great deal ·Of friction. The meml>ers of the Student Council who voted fo1· the new constitution did not ex- pect that it would be a final solution to all 1. It would be undemocratic for the out- going Council to nmninat-e its own success- ors. badly was the meeting managed The WeelJO: end: The band . that absolutely nothing was accom· brass ...

As the new constitution provides for a larger Council,. it would 1le too Hnwieldly and make for a great confusi(;m of responsibil- ities. These arguments are superficial. If there is sufficient student interest in nominating a man to the Student Cou.11Cil, his name· may be submitted to the Counc:il for consideration as a nominee. Moreover, it seems that the only successful way to eEninate \deals\ and· to counteract student lethargy is to allow a unified body like the Co11ncil make nomin- ations. ever to justify its existence this past . . .

The executive committee is responsible io the Council <!lnly to the extent tha't the Council may veto any of its actions. Another meeting has lJ..een called for next .Jlonday morn·ing to recomider the proposed constitution. At this time it will be neces- sary to \iron out\ all di:f.ferences, if Union College is to get a \new deal\ in student govemment this year. We can gain very little by delay. ~~~~~ WHY I<'RATER.NITIES? It is not strange that a divided opiniDn exists today as to the wisdom of maintain- ing fraternities as a part of col'lege life. The average college fraternity has not pr<>ven it- self intellectually, socially, or culturally worthy of being perpetuated. Some colleges, notably Harvard, Yale, a..nd Princeton, have abolished the so-called \secret societies,\ while others are seriously- con.sid.ering taking similar action. By integTating their group life with that of the colloege, our Union fra- ternities seem to have found a plausible ex- cuse for their existence. The fraternities clearls showed that they did not consider themselves socially \better\ than the rest of the student body last week- end, when they discarded their traditional house dances for an open ball in celebration of Interfraternity Wee]\end. Earlier this year the fraternities cooperated with the Student Council in hold.ing two successful \All-College\ dances. Union societies have also p1·oven themselves scholastically. At other colleges the scholetstic rating of fra- temity men is generally far below that of Lhe non-fratemity student; here the average of the two groups is practically undifferen- tiated. Besides proving ~that they are intel- lectuall~· and socially sound, Union fraterni- ties have shown that thoey are interested in furthering their culturaJ aptitude by spon- soring conceits featuring prominent artists. A::; long us Union fraterl1lities continue t<> set such a commendable example, there can be no doubt that they are a. worthy part of college life. ~~~~~ \KOLLEGE KIDS\ Century Club to influence boys and to adjust .them ...

Baker, Union College was the tecipient of a beautiful dining ·hall and two magnificent lounges-- in the building we now call Hale Hou:;e. The iounges wet e placed in the capable hands of Mrs. Brigg$ whlle the management of the din ing hall was placed in the hands of Mr. and Mrs. Cease. Because I have forcibly stated in my column The Cider 1\lill, that I am not in agreement with the policies pur sued by the latter, I fear that my criticism may be taken as lack of appt eciation of the Bakers' gift. The purpo:oe of this letter is to rectify any such impression. Lounges and commons, despite minor wear and tear, are as beaut! ful now as when el'(~cted. Mazazines are read avidly. Mrs. Briggs is as nice. Frank Agostini, the headwait er, is still a prince. The other wait er s are still efficient, pleasant, and likeable. The same may be said for kitchen men. When. I enjoy the pleasant atmosphere of Hale House and think of the off-campus places I, as a non-fl-aternity man, was forced to eat in previously, I cannot help thanking Mr. and Mrs. Baker, if only silently. But . . There is a tragedy, ~pecificall' in the commons. The delightful sur roundings lose their flavor and their power for good under a wave of discontent in food and prices. (\Bet ter fcod and lower prices\ was the chot us of .sentiment in answers to the Concordy poll.) The manager, unpopu!a.r personally, cannot achieve that sprit of comradeship with the boys which could make the place mm e than a filling station-· a de lightful cooperative club. Despite compulsory attendance for fresh- man and sophomores, despite rates raised in a period of prosperity and left at the same level when the re cession sent commodity prices scut rying downward, despite large scale buying and the attendant savings, the manager cannot make money. Hence he offers little choice, badly balanced starchy meals, no popular priced sandwiches~why go through the list of faults? He finds it necessary to crowd students oc- casionally at lunches in order to re- serve space for ouf:Bide banquets. He pays off his debts, evidences prosperity, but this is the result of his other interests, such as his at- tractive rco;taurant at the Locor.no tive Company. Bad management has spoiled the Hale House picture. Since Mr. Cease i~n't making any money and since at any rate Hale House is non-profit-making, I feei that he would lose nothing in resigning, so that a mm e popular man might take his place. It is to bring this about that I have conducted my column as a propaganda organ. I believe that only when harmony and con- tent prevail over the dining hall will the students receive the full value of Mr. Baker's generosity. Sincerely yours, Henry M.

Some- what embarrassed, Day confessed that he did not have a copy of the old constitution cr the by-laws with him. As the students were growing restless, Robet t Denzler, '38, point- ed out that :;tud<>nttS at Iowa State College were now trying to obtain a government like Union's present set-up and to discard a plan similar to the one the new constitution puts forth. Chairman Day called for a vote - at thi~ point and their was a loud outcry from the assembed· body who felt that they should vote on the que.stion. Day then called for an oral vote on the question wheth- er the student body should vote then for the new constitution. The· \No's\ made just as much noise as the \Aye's\ so Day called for a standing vote. 'The question was: Should the stu- dent body vote immediately on the new constitution or delay the· pro- cedure? The opposition won by a close margin, so another week was added to the long, uphill fight which has brewed over tne question of \functional representation\ for the Union College student body. ----a---- Interfraternity Dance Is Gala Social Occasion <Continued from Page 1) was awarded to Miss Josephine Ropek, after a. period of thirty min- utes' consideration un the part of the judges.

Under these terms the total Joss on the Union College campus during an exam period would be 1,490 pounds. Accmding to the Bu- reau, professors and textbook$ are as much to blame for this situation as the student. Often the instructors do not present the material in a clear manner with the result that the student is involved in a mass of facts and ideas and has to resort to cramming. Then, too, the text- books often are written in a manner that is above the cpm- prehension of the average stu- dent.

Two-Thirds Vote Needed Schenectady, N. Y, Ma1. 29 -The Union College chapter of Si;;ma Xi, the national honorary scientific so- ciety, celebrated its 51st year by electing eight associate members from candidates in the senior class. President Edward S. C. Smith of the chapter announced today that the following were elected to asso- ciate member·ship: Carl B. Booth, Benjamin Co ben, William J. Jaco- ber, Jr., Cromwell Mcintosh, Jr., Willard L. Male, Ralph S. Pearse, A.rthur C. Santora, and John S. Wold. Election to membership in Sigma Xi is the highest scholastic honor available to students majoring in the pure or applied sciences. Selec- tion is made on the basis of high general scientific or engineering ability, particularly as a recogni· tion of promise of ability in re- ~earch and con.structive independ- ent wo1k. The Society of Sigrua XL was founded at Cornell University in 1886, and the third chapter was established at Union Collegl.l in 1887.

Phillips Tue>;day, Match 29, 1938 THE HALE HOUgE QUESTION Hale Hou~e has been subjected to a con- stant torrent of uest:mctive critici~m since. it wa~ given to the college three years ago. It \Hts intended that it should provide a cung-enial place for students and faculty meml:Jers to eat and enjoy companionship. The Concordiensis and the college adminis- tration took little notice of these vitriolic g-run1Llings. They we1·e passed off as being minority opinions of a few students, who could not appreciate the \better things\ of li fP. The admini-stration further felt that any justifiable criticism should be presented to the Hale House Committee, whkh had been appointed to handle student complaints. Last week, the colleg·e lost its indifferent attitude.
