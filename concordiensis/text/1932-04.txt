After you get your degree WHAT THEN? * A COLLEGE TRAINING is of marked advantage in solving the problem of how to live, but what are you going to do about solving the p~oblem of how to m:ake a living? If you do not ;plan to teach, sell bonds, or offer unskilled service in a market in which the demand is for skilled service, would it not be advisable for you to learn to do some one thing par- ticuJarly well? In brief, having learned how to live, learn how to make a living. If you contemplate fitting yourself for a husine~s career ~f~er graduating from college, select the branch of husntess adminiS- tration which appeals to you and specialize accordingly. You should be able to decide whether you prefer to specialize in buying, publicity, selling, traffic management, credits, or account- ing and finance. The Bentley .School is the largest professional school in the United States which is devoted exclusivdy to trai11ing men to become specialists in accounting and finance. Nationally-known corporations engaged in mam.i:~a~turing, p~h­ lic service, foreign trade, chain- store merchandlSlng, hankmg, and insurance, send representatives to this school each year to select men from the senior class to develop in their organizations. Completion of our training mquires two years of thirty-nine weeks each. ':fuition, $235 a year. Living accommodations in fmternity houses, dormitories, and private homes, at reasonable l'ates.

A con- stant use of precedent by the young lawyer destreys any desire he may have to accomplish legal reform. Lawyers should not be com:peHed to rely almost entirely upon that which has gone before, but should be trained: to rely upon statesman- ship. In the future we will prob- ably develop a superior group of lawyers, trained, not in precedent, but having a thorough understand- ing of cbusiness, corporations and the economic system with which he is dealing. Professor Maley furthe·r stated that in a representative court it was found that over half of th& civil cases consisted of automobile negligence cases. In order to han- dle these cases more efficiently and to relieve the pressure on the civi:l courts, he ~avored the f?rmation of a special court to deal With cases of this nature. He advocated, instead of the ex- ecutive appointment for judges in the New York State courts, a sys- tem of election of the judges of the. Court of Appeals, the Appelate court and possibly the Supreme. Court. All judges for the lower courts according to Professor Ma- ley's plan, would be •appointed by these judges. This method, he states, would aid greatly in improv- ing the present legal system. \The training that a man gets in law school has little relation to the work that he does later,\ he said in discussing the difficulty of training lawyers properly. \'The legal profession is faced with the difficulty of finding a satisfactory test that can be expressed in the terms of a written examination. The moral qualification is the most important, b~t tll.e impossibility of judging a moral standard cannot ·be overcome.\ -------0<------- unpopular with the majority of the ·~tu.' d• en· -ts' Lt.ierary·. ..H'lOrrow ~Ignt,this organization will Friday night in the Mountebanks ~tuctent body.

Because of the cold weather and the bad condition of the track, the times were not good, and do not serve as a true indication of what the Union trackmen -will accom- plish during the approaching season. As was expected, the team show- ed up well in the middle distances. Kazmierczak ran the two-mile race in 10:47.8, while Sleight ran the half mile in 2.9. Holleran turned in a good performance in the mile event.· · Captain Cohn won the 120-yard lligh hurdles, while Reeder sur- prised by winning the 220-yard low hurdles. Because the pit was not put into sha.pe until Friday, the high jump, broad jump and pole vault events were not contested. By a series .of c_o:r;rtests Co!'l-ch, Nitchman, who 1s dnllmg the kick- ers and conducting the tournament, and Professor Hatfield hope to dis- cover among the material not only punters and drop-kickers but also· capable forward-passers, runners·, • centers, kick-off men and punt han- dlers. ----·0--- GYMNASIUM ELECTIVES During the remainder of this week, all freshmen and sophomores may elect new spring sports for gymn.asium credit. The sp~rts which may be elected are swim- ming, track, tennis, golf, fencing,· and lacrosse. ---0,--- SOPHOMORE NOTICE More sophomores are urged to compete for manager of lacrosse. All those so desiring are asked to report either to Ed Medden at the Beta Theta Pi house or to George Codman at the Phi Delta Theta house. The main purpose of the time trials, to find out who is to run against Amherst on Saturday, was accomplished, however. Burke, Cor- bin and Van Wert wil probably re- present the Garnet in the dashes, while Cohn, Turner, Miller, and Reeder will run in the hurdle events. For'bes a.nd Hill will be the quarter-milers, and Sleight, Holler- an, and Kazmierczak will be the outstanding runners in the middle and long distances.

Coach Ketz realizes that Union's opening track meet with Amherst on Saturday will be en- dangered by the stars which the Little Th't'ee team pla:ns to bring here. The Purple threats include Sweet, mile champion, Lockwood, in the two mile event, and Nash and Curtis, hurdlers. 'l\'hese .men were among the gro:up of Am- herst .trackmen who b~oke college records in practice th'is spring. The Little Three team's pmctices, incidentally, have been held for a much longer period tl:Lan those of the Garnet, as Amherst utilizes an indoor cinder tracl\. --UNION- Coach Harkness wa.nted a cal- endar badly yesterday- afternoon. He was reading a letter\ from the Army lacrosse coach which offer- ed the Garnet a game on the 1933 ticket at West Poin.t. '·'Eill\ want- ed to check the date offered but had to postpone his checking un- til he reached home. Since dozens of teams try vainly to schedule Army in lacrosse, Uni<ln is justly proud of cordial rela iicms exist- ing between the college and the academy which are sufficient to elicit such an offer. Coach Harkness commented on the stickmen's opener at Geneva on next Saturday, sayi:ng that Ho- bart's tea·m has been as bad•ly 'handicapped by the los·s of men as t.he Garnet's, and that theie is a fair possibility of revenging the 2-·0 defeat Union sufferEd here last ·spring. --UNION-- Fairly definite information is circulating that the :faculty will organize an indoor base ball team. Whether the erudite nine will compete against fraternity teams, or whether more than o~e faculty outfit will play has n<lt been de- termined. 8 ALL'S Shoe Rebuilders CLEANERS and DYERS PHONE 2-3456 State St. and N()tt Terr. 0.

At the ehapel services on Satur- day just p!1ececl.ing the Spring Re- cess, the student body received a very inspiring talk from Dean El- lery. Although the theme of his speech was supposedly one concern- ing \What Union stands for\ the main point he brought forth was forgiveness. In this connection, he mentioned the recent action of the Discipline Committee, which organ- ization examined the case of a stu- dent guilty of cheatil'l.g at an exam- ination. As those who attended will 1emember, Dean Ellery urged the students to forget this unfortunate occurence in the light that it was a mistake and should not mar the remainder of this student's career. In the expression of this idea, the natural kindness and sincerity of the Dean were car'ried over to the Student body and it applauded leudly. But in my mind, this doctrine of forgetting is entirely inconsistent with the empirical world about us. THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, APRIL 22, 1932 TkrH It is a noble and inspiring idea, without doubt, and true to the teachings of Jesus, but of what use is its expression when it is not on- ly impossible to forget but impract- icable as wen? As Dr. Day pointed out very recently in a talk before the Student body, Graduate schools, especially the Medical, are ¥ery particular about the type of men they accept as candidates flor high- er degrees. Scholastic standing, personality, character, integrity and e¥en neatness of appearance are important factors in the selection of students. In concluding this talk, Dr. Day cautioned the students that everything an undergracluate does counts for or against him in the role he is to play after he is grad- uated. In short, we have two views comf:ng from the same chapel plat- form, from men of the same col- lege, and yet, both are at variance with one another in spirit. Dean Ellery urges the students to forget the mistake of another undergrad- uate and Dr. 'Day cautions them that everything is remembered with a specific purpese in view. Alth0ugh these two approaches to a problem might possibly be made compatible, it is evident, as Dr. Day intimated, that .the world does not and cannot reacl.ily forget. And f0r that matter, neither does the college forget and forgive. If I make an unfortunate mistake in a philosophy examination and write down the incorrect answers to sev- eral questions, I fail that examina- tion and no one forgets about it; that failure remains on the college record's fore~er as a monument of my incapacity to deal with philos- ophical questions. Yet, when some one fails to know the answer to a question in history and resorts to unfair methods to obtain a, Dean EHery 1uges the students to forget it. [n my mind, there is somethmg inconsistent in such action; if we are going to forget a cheat and cheating, we should also forget a drunkard and drunkenness, a rob- ber and robbery, a prostitute and protitution. For after all, they are there is no reason whatever, to for- casioned even more laughs than give or forget.

The Athletic department has de- cided to promote spring sports for the faculty members, provided there are enough men interested in the project. If enough men respond, two baseball team.s will be made up to oppose each other, but in case only enough for one team are in- terested, games will be arranged with fraternity teams. So far 13 members of the faculty have signified their desire to play baseball. Coach Ketz, who ran the recent faculty round robin hand- ball tournament, is in charge of ar- rangements. ---o---~- STUDENTS ATTEND MEETING Alan S. Miller, '32, and Gordon R.
