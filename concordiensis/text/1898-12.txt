n \ E a a, :: .·- i- d I I n :::: The Collcordicllsis VoL. XXII. UNION ·COLLEGE, DECEMBER 2, 1898. No. 10. The progress of civilization is tnos:t ad,mirably il:lustrated by the cl1anges in naval at·chitecture and its constant devel~opment from the pri1nitive canoe to the invincible steel fortre~s of today. This development from a sanitary point of view was the subject of :the lecture delivered in the ch.apel last Friday afternoon by J amei Rufus Tt·yon, '58. Prior to the opening of the recent war with Spain, Dr. Tryon was surgeon-general of the United States navy and his .many years of experience made his paper particularly inter- esting. From the very earliest time in the history of • the world the problem of the navigation of the sea has occupied the human mind. When man first departed frorn his natural surroundings on land and trusted himself on the arti-ficial environ- m,ents of the sea, he was followed by death and disease. The first essential elements in the problem of ship building were speed and safety of the craft. No regard was paid to the com- fort and health of the crew. Men were plenty and cheap, vessels were scarce and expensive, hence more attention was paid to the preserva- tion of the vessels than the crew. When the navies of the old world began to sweep the seas, they soon found that the most expensive tnechanical instruments are men, yet it was not until a recent date that any particular regard was paid to the health of the crew. The first war vessels were propelled by oars. They had no deck nor protection for the oars- men. The tactics of the time demanded great speed and we find men crowded very close when all oars were at work. They were, how .. ever, in the open air and no serious eflects from over crowding were experienced until the next step in the progress of naval architecture when an upper deck was added as a vantage ground for the fighting men. The, vessels at that time were built of green unseasoned timber, because it was more easily bent. The seams were constantly drying open, allowing the water to run in. Yet it was not until tl1:e :fourteenth century that vessels were veritablie holes of disease, for prior to that time they were not used constantly but were drawn up on the shore and allowed to dry. The soldier and sailor .of that day were one and the sam,e, sotueti mes he fought on land and sometimes on tha sea. With the dawn of that era came the compass and the cannon. The former allowed men to strike out boldly into the oce~n and made sol- diers into sailors and the vessels their constant home ; the latter not only changed the tactics of naval warfare but changed the con•truction of the vessels-vessels with oars now became ships with sails. For a time oars and sails were both used at once but gradually the former were dis- continued. The fifteenth century produced larger vessels with more guns and more sails, and at the same period port holes were introduced. Spain had vessels with three decks and one hundred guns. The seventeenth century found England's best vessels carrying r 20 guns and 700 men. Guns were even placed on the loweat deck, and port holes only r6 inches above the water-line allowed the se~ to flow in freely, and tnix with the ballast of sand and gravel from which it could not be pumped. Candles were used to illuminate the interior of the vessel and their smoke added tnuch to the unhealthy condition. The \rater in the hold became filled with disease gerrns; the air vvas foul frorn the ever present can<lle smoke and the lack of sufficient ventila- tion. In stormy weather hatches and port holes were closed, thus cutting off all means of ventila- tions. These causes combined to make the gt~eate;t dangers to human life in the vessel itself. The crews were constantly attacked with various diseases, especially scurvy and

THE CONCORDIENSIS. fevers. As late as the eighteenth century the English channel fleet was obliged to make port after a ten weeks' cruise owing to scurvy and fever arnong the men. These diseases w~ere due to impure air, dampness, lack of exercise and amusem,ent. The dampness and lack of ventHation had their eflects not only upon the lives of the men hut upon the life of the vessel, and ~oon devices for artificial ventiiation w~ere introduced. Wind sails were first used but w·ere successful only under certain conditions. On a calm sea, in port, or when hatches were c'losed, this scheme for ventilation was useless. Air cavities and channels and copper covering for the hull were introduced in I 8o6 and added materially to the life of the vessel. Glass port . holes catne in due tim~e and candle smoke decreased. Then came the sick room and improved tnedical attention. The rank and standard of surgeons were r~ised at the same time. The first twenty years of the present century mark t11e first and most itnportant efforts in behalf of the health of sailors and from that titne mortality atnong them has rapidly decreased. In 1823 the surgeons found that rheumatism and puhnonary diseases were prevalent and were due to the too frequent washing of the decks, which were never dry, and in fact water stood on tbetn five hours out of every twenty- foul·. Sailors were on the cold, damp decks with bare feet and wet clothing, having no place to warm themselves or dry their clothing. Officers refused to subordinate the appearance of their vessels to the health of their men. The flooding of the decks washed filth into the hold where it accumulated disease germs. Steatn as a propelling force for vessels, was introduced in 1822, and f·or a th11e steatn and sail were both used on the same vessel. Crowd- ing increased. There were more tnen and less space for them as the macninery was bulky. The sleeping quarters of the crew were con- taminated more than ever before, more filthy, more heat, less space per man and less work on deck. The conditions fo1·ced many to sleep on dec]& when the weather permitted. It was not until r84o, when metal super- seded wood as constructive material that the perfect health of sailors was insured. The interior of an iron or steel vessel must be kept d.ean and dry to prevent rusting-· . it is a matter of preservation, hut sanitation pl;ofits by it in no s:maU degree. Iron vesse~s were cold in cold weather and · the opposite extre.tne in hot w:eather, so naval architects have devised systems of steam heating and forced ventilation by m~eans of which the crews in our :ruodern navies are insured perfect health and comfort. Drinking water was formerly the source of many diseases but aU modern vessels are sup- plied with distUled water. In closing Gen. Tryon said tl1at from now on naval architecture and sanitation will go hand in hand ; he then paid a high tribute to John Blair Gibbs, a graduate of Rutgers, who enlisted as a surgeon in our navy at the opening of the war and was the first American. killed in Cuba. Football (1e$Uine. On Thursday, Nov. I 7, the .curtain was rung down on the football season of '98, and a tnost 1·emarkable season bas it been tor Union. In fact it tnay be said without exaggeration that this has_ been the most successful football year in the history of the college. 'rhe teams Union has cotnpeted with have been representative teatns fron1 the sn1aller colleges and the record is one which sends a thrill of pride through the heart of every loyal son of Old Union. It is a record of eight games won out of a possible nine-of I55 points to 23. At the opening of the term the prospects were anything but bright. The graduating class took fro1n the eleven Crichton, Hoxie, Mallery, Book- bout, Thotnas and Poole ; and Wilson, Mess- msr, and Robinson were in military camps. It was soon ·evident that the freshmen would be well represented on the tea:m, for the candi- dates were showing up finely in practice, and when the 'varsity lined up for the initial game there were seven freshmen who had places. = 'I n v h I } 1 { 1 t

Burrows, Printer, 4I.4 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. EVER since the present senior class bas been in college, and years before, tlJe:re has been a con- stant cry for a closer relationship between the college and the Albany departrnents. This cry culminated in a University :Banquet last year, but it seems as if the two branches were as widely separated as ever. It is true that each of the college organizations receives the support of one or two men from the Law or Medical departments, .. excellent material too, but beyond that there seen~s to be no fraternal bond. The pages of The Concordiensis seldom contain news from either department, and the Albany students give the paper very little support. It is well enough to talk of closer relationship but as long as they will not support a University organ there can be no common bond. The Concordiensis is ever ready to publish news concerning all the depart- ments whenever it is obtainable. We wish to thank those who have made contributions so far this year and hope that others will enable us to give the Law and Medical colleges proper repre- sentation. student who lives far away can go horne to his Thanksgiving dinnel\ but has to eat what he can get at his boarding house. Union students rcan not compla.ia of any aa.ck of generosity on the part of the fac-u:lty in this respect. The college is ever ready to do the right thing. THE footba.H season. of 1898 is over, and Union can view U with an unalloyed feeling of pride and satisfaction. We· had one of the best football teams that ever represented Union, and every member of the 'varsity deserves a great deal of credit. They worked hard and faithfttl:ly, and throughout the season showed great inter·est in the game. To the coach, Physical Director Pollard, the gratitude of the student-body is due, for the zealous attention that he gave the team. The one defeat in the league series, that deprived us of the pennant, does not influence by one jot or tittle, the genera.l result. AN UNPLEA.SANT circumstance connected with the Thanksgiving recess, was the absence of heat in the library; and we dare say, :that ah11ost as many students were working there during those few days as at any time during the term. It may be argued that the library is kept open during vacations merely for the accommodation of those students who remain on the hill, but when students haYe assignments that must be reported alrnost the Yery next day after the close of the recess, it is ve1·y disagreeable to have to sit in the liht·ary and shiver while they are at work. The students do not reqnire very much heat, just enough to prevent a small sfzed fog between the eyes and a book, at every breath, or about the amount that would prevent the formation of icicles on steam pipes. ..

.. J' THE CONCORDIEN,SIS. 9 (From the Utica Observer.) On 'Thanksgiving day Han1ilton in a hard fought football game defeated Colgate university and won the footha.ll ·championship of the inter- collegiate union. The eleventh annual reunion of the Union coUege a~umni association of New York, ·will be held at the Hotel Savoy, New York city·, on the evening of Dec. 8. The business meeting will be caUed to order at six o'clock by Silas B. Brownell, '52, president of H1e association. The The final score was five points to nothing. The weather was suitable for the participants in the game, but decidedly uncomfortable for spectators.. Yet nearly a thousand turned out and gave the rival elevens a good reception. . banquet begins at seven o'clock. The list of speal<.ers has not yet been fully determined upon. Dr. Raymond, of course, will be there and will speak in his official capa- city as president of the coUege. Dr. Perkins will represent the faculty and Douglas Catnpbell, '94, will represent the ~'younger alumni.\ A number of prominent speakers have signified their intention to be present and the college quartette has been invited. HatnHton scored her only touchdown in the first half. The ball finally landed on Hamil- ton's tw.enty-yard line as titne was called. The second b.alf was a series of terrific line stnashes, end plays, tandems, tnass plays and an occa- sional double pass. It was aU straight football, with neither side taking any risks on un.tried playes. Only once was there a real opportunity for cheering, and that cam~e when Mason ran forty yards, dodging eight Colgate players. Hamilton's line was strong and held titne and again against Colgate's attacks. In the ends Colgate was superior. Hamilton's half backs outplayed Colgate's but Cramp's work was better than that of Robertson. 'There was an occasional fumble, for the ball was slippery. Hatnilton's men indulged in less individual play and their team work vvas superior to that of Colgate. It was a hard fought contest, with the best eleven winning, and no disgrace to the vanquished.

l The Coll.cordieJl.sis VoL. XXII. UNION C,OLLEGE·, DECEMBER 13, 1898. No. 11. Ceetur~ OQ CSI]omas {Jloore. Michael Monahan of Albany, delivered an unusually interesting lecture on the subject, \Thomas Moore,\ before a good sized audience in the chapel last Friday afternoon. Mr. Mona- han proved to be a very entertaining ta~ker and thoroughly a~cquainted with his theme. The Irish poet was treated in a delightful manner, and, as the speaker said, by one who had only the deepest adn1iration for the writings, deeds and character of the subject of his sketch. The speaker considered that Moore was the greatest . of all Irish poets as well as being second to none : of the many fervid patriots of the Etnerald Isle. He was the product of an oppressed people, one of the means through which the feelings of his . subdued countrymen were found out. He was the idol of the cultured, the champion of the lower classes. Thomas Moore was born in 1779, and his life work, as a result was intimately identified with the Irish struggles for liberty in the first part of the present century. Endowed with an emotional, sentimental nature, he was also possessed of wonderful musical talents. As a result of constant cultivation of these gifts, and of the fact that he was surrounded by a people most fervid in character, it was but natural that Moore should have been the great poet and patriot that he was. The poet's rare skill at the piano and his strangely fascinating voice enabled him to feelingly interpret his sweetly worded songs. His bewitching Irish minstrelsy, his strange secret of poesy, his infallible receipt of Irish wit-all combined to make him the center of an ad1niring public. As a poet and as an author of prose, Moore was in a class of his own. No man before him had been able to so effectively combine music and thought. Moore blended the two in a wonder- ful manner, his deep tender nature ~ nd his remarkable delicacy of ear enabling him to accotnplish these brilliant results. He was prince of lyrists. Our literature has 11othing :to compare with his works in pathos, tenderness and joy. Shelley acknowledged him his superior, while Coleridge considered his lyrics more beautiful than those of any other man. Mr. Monahan cited other examples of promi- nent men of culture who have testified to the exquisite harmony and the simple purity of his works.. The Irish people have today lost but little of the jealousy which is inherent in their very nature, and it is to this that the attacks of his own countrym,en are 1nainly due. The satirical s~ide of the poet n1ust not be underestimated. It must be taken into active consideration in any discussion of his merits. Moo1·e did not lack the courage of his con- victions. Threats and prosecution in no way stopped hi1n in the execution of what was to him his duty. He was outspoken, courageous and fearless. His constant, devoted patriotism placed him by the side of O'Connell, Brian Boru and other great Celtic patriots. The lecturer read in a very pleasing manner a number of apt selections from the poet's works, criticising them both as to their good qualities and defects. The lecturer said the chief criticism against Moore in his \ Lalla Rookh \ seems to be his seerningly exhaustless store of fancy, felicity and divine confidence, of which others would be glad to have a very little., '' The life of Byron \ was his greatest work in prose. No other man ever received such an eulogy at the hands of another author. Moore was a splendid example in the matter of his private life. His contentment, his peaceful unswerving devotion to the home ties, both con- siderably increased the happiness of the home in which he lived. Moore's character was noble and generous, and at all times were his thoughts and actions consistent. Wit,

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. will and courtesy were at once embodied in hirn : and helped to raise biln to that height of , immortality which he longed for. The sadness which o'ershadowed his late years only. aided to strengthen his character. As he fel1t his powe~·s gradually passing away, he labored only the more zealously. When he died, it was with tlle sati·sfaction that he had lived a life fraught with many beneficial results to others and espedaHy to the country he so loved to call his owFJ.. Dr. Ja<:~sor}'s C~eture. The last and one of the tnost interesting and instructive lectures of the faH term was delivered in the chape:l last Friday afternoon by the Rev. Sheldon Jackson, D:. D., who was moderator of the last general assetnbly of the Presbyterian church. His subject was, \Alaska and the Klondyke.\ In introducing Dr. Jackson, Prof. William Wells, one of the early tourists and explorers in that far north land, repeated a statement that he himself made some years ago in the sam,e place and on the same subject, that \ Union college invented Alaska.\ William H. Seward, one of Union's most famous sons, when secretary of state purchased Alaska, and Sheldon Jackson, another son, whom his alma mater loves to honor, was created for the pres- ent period to aid in its development. Dr. Jackson opened his remarks by saying that Prof. Wells might have gone a step farther, for president Chester A. Arthur, another Union man, gave Alaska a government, for it was ten years after we purchased it before we took actual possession and established a government over the territory. The speaker gave a lesson in the geography of the territory '' not for the students\ as he stated, '' but for the faculty.\ Alaska is a land of constant surprise, in its size, climate and resources. It has an area of 6oo,ooo square miles, equal to that of all the states east of the Mississippi river. It is 2,200 tniles in length and 1,400 in breadth, and the most western island of the Aleutians is 1 ,ooo miles west of the Hawaiian islands. Alaska is the home of glaciers and its mineral springs can not be equaled anywhere in the world. The Yukon i:s <70 miles wide at the mou~h and navigable £or z,Soo miies, and its tributaries are all nayigable for several hundred tniles. Alaska is the only tradt which the United States has ever purchased which has paid for itself by returns to the United States treasury. It cost $z;7oo,ooo, and thus far the seal skins from the seal islands have pro- dttced a revenue of $12,ooo,ooo. The I,ooo :m~nes of cod hanks along the Aleutian islands are a hundred times 1nore valuable than those uf Canada, and there are also extensive sal:tnoR banks. Im:mense coal deposits a1·e found evetl north of the arcti~c circle and one bluff of £ve sea.ms on the coast furnishes hundreds of tons mined by nature for the whalers. Iron ore, ~copper and crude petroleum are among the m1any resources which only await developm:ent. A gold quarry is ,being worked and furnishes quartz for the largest quartz mHl in the world, which produces $6o,ooo worth of bullion per month. In 1897, Circle City was a growing city of log houses but rich finds on the Klondyke attracted its population and long before the news of that bonanza reached the states every claim on the river were taken. Experts pronounce Alaska the largest gold belt in the world. Dr. Jackson described the miners and mines at some length but advised men to keep away from Alaska as ths cost of living is so great and the surroundings are so demoralizing. Means of transportation are the great needs of the country. It does not produce food for its people as it is Lot an agricultural country, hence it is necessary to import food. It is easily brought by boat to points along the river, but the cost of transporting it to miners who are located some miles back is enormous. Horses cannot endure the clhnate and dogs are slow and expensive, but Providence has provided the reindeer which is exactly suited to the con- ditions. Reindeer are to the artics what camels are to the tropics. The territory fuYnishes pasturage for millions of these animals which supply all the~ten1poral and physical wants of the jnhabitants. A reindeer can be driven aU day and when turned loose at night will £nd his

TltE CON,OORDIENSIS. food under the snow in the shape of tnosses. One of the govern.tnent agents made a journey of 2,ooo miles with a team of r·.eindeer in less · than five months. Son1e years ago Dr. Jackson visited the • northern coast of Alaska and found the natiYes starving, owing to the scarcity of whales, their ma~in food. He then imported reindeer from s;iheria to supply their needs. . The first concert of the season was .given by the Musical Association at the Van Curler opera house, Thursday evening, D~ec. I. The audi- ence, while not large, was a representative one and showed its appreciation of the faithful work · done by the various clubs in prepairing for this event. Encores were frequent and well merited, for the selections showed the results of hard and continual prac.tic,e. . t\ At the present the govern.ment ts suppor tng sev:erai .schools in Alaska besides those managed by the n1issionaries. The various denomina- tions partitioned this vast territory between them and now each has its sphere. The natives are anxious to have their children educated and sorne teachers are oblighed to hold two and three schools per day. Or. Jackson closed with a high tribute to the · sacri'fi.ce and devotion of the tnissionaries who live in the isolated settlements where cotnrnuni- ca:tion with the outside wodd is possible only once a year. Christianity is fast making it safe for miners to go to Alaska. fllumf}i ~ote. Lucius C. Rice, ex-~94, was elected to the office of Treasurer of the State of Idaho, in the recent elections. He was supported by the Den1oc1·ats and silver Republicans. Mr. Rice was born at Riceville, Fulton Co., N.Y., in 1867. He came to Union college in · 1890, and left in his second year. Soon after- wards he went te Idahu, and located at St. Anthony, Fremont Co., where he has since been engaged in the merchandise and banking business. He l1as taken an active part in public affairs and has shown himself to be an enter- prising rnan of considerable merit. fllli$OQ-Foote Debaters. The literary societies have elected their speakers for the Allison-Foote debate, which will take place during the winter term. Ketchum, '99, Loucks, 1900, and Winterberg, 1900, will debate for the Adelphics, and Noel, ~99, Wright, '99, and Reed, 1900, for the Philomathians. The appearance of ou1· victorious football team in the boxes was a pleasant innovation, and very appropriate on such an occa·sion. The clubs are :m:ade up as follows: Glee club.-Frank C.

LAST week was a remarkable one in some respeets for Union college: General Da.niel Butter- :field, '49, delivered an address befo1·e the Colonial society, President Raymond had the toast of honor at the banquet of the St. Nicholas society, and Prof. Franklin H. Giddings, \77 spoke at the New York Alumni banquet. Each one spoke strongly in favor of expansion, and theh· speeches were fully reported by the New York papers.

The r 5th Annual Report of the State Geo- logist~ published last su1nmer, contains Pm. 4 t I of a Monograph by Professor Prosser, on the class.ification and distribution of the Harnilton and Chemung series of New York. The reprint mak~s a quarto book of 140 pages, with a colot·ed geographical map, numerous structurial , secti&ns and half tone iHustrations. A paper of : greater local interest in the satne report is one by Prof. Prosser and E. R. Cumings, '97, on the Lower Silurian of West Canada creek and ' the Mohawk valley, in which the Trenton Falls region and the Mohawk valley from Little Falls. to Schenectady, is quite fully described. The department wiH also be very strongly rep11esented in the I 7th Annual Report which goes to press this winter ; for it will contain three reports by Prof. Prosser, one by Prof. Pros.ser and R. B. Rowe, '96, and one by E. R. Cumings, '97· In these reports Prof. Prosser describes the Devonian formations of the Cats- kills and northeastern New York, and the Sil- uri~n and Devonian rocks of the Helderberg pla:teau. The papers by Messrs. Rowe and Cu1t1ings were submitted as theses for special ho~t()fS in geology, Rowe's being on the geology of the southern Helderbergs and Cumings' on · and typical sections. The first of these volumes will be the Geology of AU~gany county, by Dr. O'Hara, which is under revision by Profs. Clark and Prosser. The second series of reports is kno\vn as the syste111atic, in which the corre- lation and description of the formations will he fully considered by periods, :together with the palentology. The first volum~e of this series on the Devonian systetn, by Prof. Prosser and Mr. Rowe is in course of preparation, and the second one on the Upper Silurian will be by Prosser and Cumings of Union. The musical association gave the second con- cert of the season before the mernbers of the Riverside club at Lansingburgh, last Thursday evening. The club house was :filled with a large and appreciative audience, and the work of all the clubs was uniformly good. In the absence of F. L. Greene, the T<errace song was well sung by H. A. Barrett, 1901, of Lansingbut·gh. After the concert an iaforrnal dance was enjoyed. This concert together witl1 the first one, formed a basis for the make-up of the several clubs during the rest of the season, so that the per- sonnel of the clubs on the western trip will be nearly the sa:~.ne as at the opening concert. This western trip will he made during the Christlnas recess and will include concerts at Newark, Rochester and Au burn, on Dec. zo, 21 and 22, respectively.
