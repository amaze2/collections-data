The more complete equipment of the Department of Latin at Union, which has been urged upon the Trustees at various times, might well receive encouragement from the recent report of the United States' Commissioner of Education, the .Hon. William T. Harris. The statistics cited in this Report are conspicuous evidence that the dassics are less moribund in the present day than. some people appear to imagine. These statistics have reference to secondary-school studies, and exhibit in tabular form the total ·enrollment of students for each of the eight years from 1890 to 1898, and the rate of increase in the enrollment of pupils for each of a series of subjects taught in the schools daring that period. If for the sake of brevity we take the figures referring to the beginning and the end of the period mentioned, we shall have the following tabulated resu 1t : Enrollment Enrollment Percent'g STUDIES, in in of 1889-90. 1897-98. Increase. 1. Latin, 100,144 274:,293 174 2. History (except U.S.) 82,909 209,034 152 3. Geometry, 59,781 14:7,515 147 4:. Algebra, 127,397 306,755 141 5. German, 34:,208 78,994 131 6. :French, 28,032 58,165 107 7. Greek, 12,869 24,994 94 8. 'Physics, 63,644 113,650 79 9. Chemistry, 28,665 47,4:48 65 Statistics for English are not sufficiently com- plete to render a statement on the subject advisable, but it is to be hoped and is generally believed that this study does not fall behind any of the rest in popularity. It is significant however that the study of Latin in the last nine years has gained in the enrollment of pupils at a rate greater than that of any other secondary-school study, with the possible exception of English. In point of absolute numbers Latin also e11rolls more pupils than any other study, excepting Algebra and (probably) English. Moreover the total gain of 17 4 per cent. is more than double the percentage of increase in the total enrollment of students in the schools. This percentage is figured at 86, in as much as the total enrollmertt of pupils in the various secondary schools rose from 297 ;894 in 1890 to 554,814 in 1898. There can be little doubt then as to the growing popularity of Latin in the .secondary schools. How about Greek? Is Greek on the decline, as many persons suppose? The figures show that the enroll- ment for this subject has been at all times (within the period referred to) below, and very consider- ably below that of Latin. But they show also that Greek is gaining rapidly. The ,enrollment has almost doubled in eight years. Moreover, as Prof. West has remarked in his report on this subject for the Classical Review, ''the g-veat gain in Latin is likely to accelerate the present rate of gain in Greek very soon. '' The inference then regarding Greek is that it too is growing in favor, and that some day not far off it will take its place beside the Latin in popular esteetn. A few considerations suggested by these statistics may not be out of place here. It is evident that the Latin courses at Union have material enough to draw from. That is: there are young men enough and to spare who are leaving school every year with a greater or less knowledge of Latin, and who may be induced to enter College, and become 'can- didates either for the A. B. or the Ph. B. degree. Consequently there exists no necessity for any College (merely for the sake of adding to its num- bers) to admit to its Latin Department those pupils who are poorly prepared-those, in short, who have had less than the minimum. Latin course of four years duration proposed by the Committee of Twelve. The College that admits students with a preparation of one, two or even three years dura- tion only, must for sotne reason be g~eatly in need of students, or it must be willing to do its work on a lower basis or by a lower standard than the average. The latter would conceivably be the case when students were accepted and entered for the Latin courses w.ho could not ''get in'' elsewhere. It might also be the case where it seemed to be of paramount importance to swell the total number of students in the College. In that event advantage might easily be taken of the fact that young men who, through accidental circumstances, had been prevented from acquiri11g at school all the Latin they desire are seeking to make up this lack at College, if they can only persuade the College authorities to \give them a chance.\ The tempta~ tiou to increase the size of the incoming Freshman class on the basis of this argument is very great, and there is no doubt that the law should be some- what elastic and exceptions made at times,

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. Exceptions are made, in fact, in all Colleges and Universities-with advantages on both sides. But in general this results in a lowering of the standard, and at Union we have :the President's word for it that the standard of the Latin Depart- ment must be maintained at a level with the aver- age taken for the ''Colleges of the Eastern and Middle States, and Maryland.'' The question then suggests itself whether the exceptions just referred to are more numerous and frequent at Union than they ought to be in the light of the President's policy regarding the standard. Statistics tnight be furnished to the reader in reference to this tnatter also; but per- haps an expression of opinion wiH suffice. In my humble judgment the exceptions are very con- siderably in excess of what they should be--in excess in fact of the minin1um num.ber which is compatible with the preservation of the desired standard. It does not mend tnatters to say that students who are unable to \go on with the class\ tnay be dropped. A pupil once adnrti:ed is entitled to every allowance. If his work is poor he must in every case be given the benefit of the doubt. He has been told in effect that he is worthy of classi- fication with others who are in reali 1:y far ahead of hin1 in the studies of the College class room, and jf he works hard, it is distinctly unfair to him to tell him that he cannot keep up. He becomes a victim rather than an offender, and the College which is only too glad to increase its metnbership by placing his nan1e on its rolls has iu truth done him an injustice. Where then lies the remedy? At Union College, as no doubt elsewhere, there exists a desire on the part of all persons interested in the success of the institution to see a long list of names in the book of entry. The Trustees as well as the Alumni in general are in the habit of gauging the usefulness of the institution from year to year by the number of the incoming class. The sporadic questions of the graduates as well as the specific interrogatories of the authorities themselves relate invariably and almost solely to the quantity rathe1· than to the quality of the Freshtnen. The pride and interest of the President and faculty are thus appealed to, and tempted son1etitnes beyond the possibility of resistence, to adtnit n1any young n1e11-. especially to the Classical and Mathen1atical courses-who ought either to remain a year or two longer at school, or else \to seek other spheres of influence\ than those which are attainable through a College education. One remedy lies then in the acquisition of courage to say \No\ at the right time-a difficult thing to do, but a thing no11e the less right and proper because it is difficult, Moreover it is a distinct error, of which many of us s0 called educators are guilty, to suppose that the College which employs us would suffer through a refusal on our part to receive into our class rooms those young men who are not prepared to do the work which· is presumably represented by the degrees conferred (with not a little eclat) at our Commencement season. A few students more OF less would make but a slight difference in the reputation of the College, when the question of the integrity of the degree is the thing to be considered. In the long run there would be a decided gain in reputation, so soon as it became known that the Union College degree is difficult of attainment. Again, it does not follow of course that a large number of pupils taking Latin in the preparatory schools implies necessarily a corresponding num- ber taking this study in any given college. The boy who has completed a sound and thorough course of study in a school naturally expects that the advantages offered him at College will corre- spond with those which he has enjoyed during his year of elementary training. The College must be prepared therefore to carry him along into the higher branches of his favorite pursuit and to offer him facilities for improvement which cann<>t be readily secured in the school. His choice of a College \Vill be largely determined by this con- sideration. If then the study of Latin is as popu- lar in the secondary schools as it would seem to be, to judge from the statistics already cited, the continuation of that study along lines more advanced and effective is a sine qua non in the College course. Is Union College doing all she can to induce the better class of students (I mean those who have taken the minimum four years course of the better schools) to seek advanced instruction in this subject within her own portals? I have already pointed out in these columns that an equipment that was all that could be desired in the days of Dr. Nott is meagre and insufficient at the present time: that without undertaking to institute post-graduate courses at Union it is nevertheless imperative to offer to undergraduates many things which were scarcely thought of twenty or thirty years ago. There is not space to repeat here the details which were quite extensively alluded to in the issue of The Concordiensis for November 8, 1899. Eut it may be said that the facts there given contain a suggestion at least of what Union stands in need of in order to render her Latin courses more complete and, as it were, \up-to-date.\ The question of expense it is not my part to discuss. I may say, however, that the additional outlay would not need to be great. It would consist chiefly in an allowance to the Latin

i I t THE CONOORDIEN:Sts. Department of at least three hundred dollars a year for books, journals and other apparatus,- for the maintenance and steady increase of a ''working library'' in ancient literature, epigraphy and archaeology-without which no really good work of the higher kind can be accompHshed. I say \an allowance,\ not a fixed sum, for such a library must be a growth; in no other way can it be rendered thoroughly effective and useful to student and teacher alike. The lack of s\lch an allowance must ever render the classical departments at Union College in a large n1.easure deficient in apparatus absolutely necessary to the work of undergraduate students, in those studies which, begun in the grammar and the hi-gh-school, should be continued at the College on a broader basis and in accordance with the new and increased demands made by the more advanced scholarship of our own day. SIDNEY G. ASHl;\{ORE. ALUMNI BANQUET. The Northern New York alu1nni association propose to hold a banquet in Albany sotnetime in the near future, probably during the first week in February. No banquet was held last year but the committee intends to tnake this year's feast a tnemorable one in the history of the organization. Dr. Raymond and several other protninent speakers will address the assemblage. THE PI PHI DANCE. The Pi Phi boys of the Union Classical Insti- tute gave their annual holiday dance on the evening of Friday, Dec. 22. The affair was held in Yates' boathouse, Gioscia furnished the music, and in every respect the dance was suc- ·Cessful. Dorp's fair ones were all there, and the Union tnen present were: Frank Cooper, '93; J. C. Cooper, '97; P. B. Yates, '98; T. B. Brown, '98; E. vV. Strong, '99; D. W. Paige, 1900; P. L.

While the Principals' C<>n:vocation was in session at Syracuse, during tbe recent holidays, a banquet was held by the Union .college men in attendance. Nineteen gathered at the '·Grand Grill,\ and after the dinner spent the thne in telling anecdotes of their col:I!ege days and com- paring notes as to those who w-ere absent. An association was formed, Howard Conant, '92, of Penn Yan, being e;lected president, and A.M. Blodgett, '97, of Corning, secretary and treasurer. By having a regular organization, the members can be of assistaHce to each other in school work and can be in:fo nned concerning vacancies in good positions. The secretary, Professor Blodgett, would be glad to be infonned of other 1J a ion tnen teach- ing in the state. The following were present at the banquet: John H. Clark, '7o, of Flushing; Arthur E. Barnes, '95, Unadilla; John N. V. Veeder, '95; Hobart; Horatio M. Pollock., '95, Albany High School; M. G. Thomas, '98, Schaghticoke; George J. Dann, '96, Liberty; Edwin W.

8 THE CONOORDIENSIS. THE LAY OF THE IDOL. In shelter beneath the sturdy trees, My thoughts leap over the storm-tossed seas, To a country in the west; By a gentle stream with its dancing gleam, With nature's beauty blest. 'Twas here in a shady wood 'mid flowers And trees surrounding like stately towers, A deity I stood, And the people came and spoke my name Throughout the echoing wood. And each in homage, on bended knee, Did then present his humble plea For a blessing to ht!:; soul; With a favoring nod, I lightened his load, And peace within him stole. * * * * * Those days. are past, of celestial hue, Yet homage still to me is due, Though only once a year; For the freshman sing with devotion's ring, And drop the silent tear. My thoughts go back to that far-off land Where my sturdy trees like towers stand, And my loved ones call me there; But the longing's vain, for ne'er again, Will I see that land so fair. -JOHN McNAB, 1901. TH~EE MEN ON FOU~ WHEELS. Three Men on Four Wheels is Jerome K. Jerome's rather eccentric title for the series of humorous stories which he has completed for The Saturday Evening Post, of Philadelphia. Every one who has read Three Men in a Boat- and who has not?-will wish to follow the mis- adventures of Mr. Jerome and his two com- panions on their tour through Gennany astride a tandem and a safety. Mr. Jerome's wit is no less keen, nor his humor less ki1_1dly, than when he scored his first great literary succ~ss ten years ago. The first story of Mr. Jerome's series appeared in the Post of January 6. .· ALUMNI NEWS. Items of Interest Concerning Union's Graduates. [Every student and alumnus of Unio'Jt is i'nvited to send to ike Editor-in- Chief items of interest for insertion in this department. News ofa personal nature, about any alumnus, will be gladly recei- ved and printed.] '55.-The Saturday Evening Post of Phila- delphia in a recent nun1ber says: \The utiliza- tion of reindeer in Alaska is due to the efforts of the Rev.

Dr. Jackson devoted many years of his life to work among the natives of the frozen north, and his idea of supplying rein- deer for food and as an aid to transportation was generously supported by Mr. Shepard. At the historic missionary meeting in Carnegie Hall several years ago, Dr. Jackson was one of the most interesting speaker's, and according to his latest report the work has progressed greatly since its inception.\ '56.-Rev.

Y., as second- class matter. Chas. :Burrows, Printer, 414 State Street, Schenectady, N. Y. WE TAKE pleasure in appoin~ing to the board of editors Mr. John D. Guthrie of the sophomore class, who will serve as a reporter during the remainder of the college year. As was announced last October, competition is always open to students in the junior and sophomore as well as the fresh- man classes, and when the character of the work warrants it, appointments will be made by the board. class. Now there are other class customs which n1ay be continued or dropped at the will of the class in question, but when the whole student body is involved then the will of the upperclassmen is law. Now the freshman class, in its brief but glo~ious existence, has seen fit to depart from the usual order of things and give up several class customs. So far, so good. But when a college custom is deliberately 1gnored, it is time to stop. Now it is an unwritten law at Union that every student shall speak to every other student when n1eeting on the hill or in town. And it is the duty of the underclassmen to speak first. This is the rule as laid down to the class of 1900 three years ago, and observed by them ever since; but many members of the present freshman class not only fail to speak first, but even ignore the salutation of the upper classmen. Ignorance of the rule can no longer be offered as an excuse, and it will be to the interests of the freshmen to bear in mind what is expected of them. THE twentieth century is not quite yet a reality, and this is well, for as the closing year of the old nineteenth century stretches before us, it is essentially fitting to pause for a moment and con- template wherein we, as Union college students can add during the year to the honor of Union. Though it was the eighteenth century that gave our alma mater birth, for her history she points to the century just drawing to a close. Hand in hand have college and century walked, and renown ha& . cotne to both. But soon their paths will diverge. The century, having fulfilled its days will cease to exist, while the college, full of the hope and THE CoNCORDIENSIS thinks it about time the vigor of second childhood will go ever forward freshman class be informed that there are in this carrying on its grand work of mental, n1oral and college a few insignificant specimens of humanity social elevation. known as upperclassmen, who are supposed to have one or two privileges besides sitting in chapel Monday mornings and applauding the freshman yell. A majority of the class of 1903 seems to have lost sight of this, if it was ever brought to their attention; but the fact remains that there are certain college customs here at Union the observa- But ours is still the Union of the nineteenth century, the abundance of whose legacy to the twentieth should be enriched by definite achieve- ments in the line of progress during the year to come. In the sphere of u1,1dergraduate activity there is much room for improvement. In the first place, elections should be cleansed of politics. If tion of which is under the direction of the senior we are to have successful organizations, the best f ( .

( ' ' '' THE CONCORDIENSIS. 11 men in college, irrespective of society and other con:siderations, should be chosen as managers. The present system of subscriptions for the various interests, athletic and otherwise, is unsatisfactory, as is also the system of class 'Collectors now in vogue. For t~e remedying of all of these defects The Concordiensis pledges its cooperation, and the editors will he glad to print any suggestions with that end in view. We believe, too, that at present there is need of an association of upper- classmen which shall exercise a supervision over all undergraduate affairs, and represent the student body and its sentiment. Such councils have been tried at other institutions with success, and we expect in the near future to formulate definite plans for an organization of the kind at Union. Another project which should have the coopera- tion of every student, is to make the commencement of 1900 the most successful in the history of the college. The Concordiensis believes that in a great measure this can be brought about by inter- esting especially alumni of the decennial classes. With this in view the editors now make the first call for items of interest about alumni in any qf the usual reunion classes. These personal notes will be gathered and published by classes and each alumnus put into communication with his classmates. In this way the old class ties will reawaken an interest in the college, and a large and enthusiastic body of alumni should attend Commencement. The editors realize that the col- lection and arrangetnent of such an amount of material is no mean task and accordingly we call upon every reader of The Concordiensis to send in any such information as he may be a ware of or able to obtain. If all will cooperate in this way we feel sure that the results will be very apparent TALK ON THE HILL. Items of Interest Discussed. by the Students. Prof. Bennett spent the holidays at his home in Chicago. A number of students tried examinations for state certificates last week. Prof. Howard Opdyke spent a part of his vacation in Plainfield, N. J. Prof. T. W. vV right spent the Christmas vacation at Galt, Ontario, Canada. John E. Parker, 1901, was the guest of Frank Little, '97, of Rochester, during the recent vaca- tion. John L.udden, 1901, has been elected a vice- president of the Alumni Association of LaSalle Institute, Troy. \Jim the Copper\ was confined indoors Saturday with an attack of muscular rheumatism. He is now again on duty. On Thursday afternoon Prof. Wright slipped and fell on the roadway near the round building, and received a severe scalp wound. Tha sympathy of the students is extended to Charles E. Palmer, Jr., 1900, who suffered the loss of his tnother during the vacation. Prof. Frank S. lloffn1an spent the vacation in New York City. He also attended the n1eeting of the American Sociologi~ts held at New Haven. in the last week of June, and our labor will not Robert B.

Orations will be due from the sophon1ores, on Feb. 2. Articles should be about five hundred words in length. The subject is left to the choice of the writer. James G. Perkins, 1903, of Albany, who broke his wrist by a fall in the gytn. just before the Christmas holidays, has so far recovered as ' to be able to resume college work. E. G. Brownell, 1900; T. B. Brown, '98; P. L. Thomson, 1900; H. J. Brown, 1901, attended a reception held at the Ri versicle Club I-Iouse, at Lansingburgh, during the holidays. Dr. E. E.

The American School for Classical Studies at Rome has re-engaged the Villa Story, which they have occupied for three years, and which affords convenient quarters in a healthy part of the city. Prof. Richard Norton, who has held the chair of Archreology for two years, has been appointed director of the school. The significance of the appointn1ent is that Archreology is likely to receive more attention than subjects like Epi- graphy and Paleography, which have heretofore been considered n1ore important. Professor Platner, of Western Reserve University, will be engaged during the present year and will lecture on epigraphy. Other eminent Archreologists, resident in Rome, will lecture at the school as heretofore. It is expected that the same facilities as in previous years will be afforded for study in the Vatican and in the many museums in w liich Rome is so rich. It is also believed that the day is not far distant when excavations will he permitted. An effort has been tnade during the present sun1mer to secure a fund of $1oo,ooo as a foundation, a third of which has already been raised.-Rutgers Targum.

The exhibits which the more important American universities are planning to make at Paris in 1900, will be of a nature .somewhat different from that at the VVorld's Fair in 1893· Each university., instead of. having a c~tnplete exhibit representative of all of the work done in that entire institutio~ as was the case at Chicago, will devote itself to an exhibit of· some special department of its activity. Harvard will exhibit its astronomical work, Coluinbia its pedagogy, the University of Chicago its collection <>f crys- tallizable minerals, Yale its geological speci- mens, Princeton its uniyersity publication's and charts, illustrating the' history of the organiza- tions of the university, and the· University of Pennsylvania will exhibit, among other things, its Archreological collection. INTEQCOLLEGIA TE. At tl1e University of Pennsylvania a War Men1orial Tow·er has recently been erected in memory of those who fell in the late war with Spain. The trustees of Bryn Mawr have decided that students tnay no longer live outside the college wall. A. course in law has been added to the electives. The accession to Princeton's library during the past year numbered, exclusi~e of periodicals, 18,380 volumes. This increase is the largest in Princeton's history. An1herst College used to be one of the great feeders of ministry, but only hvo of the class of '99 are at divinity schools, while fifteen are teaching, ten are studying law, and twenty-five are in business. The treasury of the Princeton University Atl1letic Association, which includes the ac- counts of the football, baseball and track organi- zations, shows a deficit for the six months to August 1, of about $3,500. Tl1e question which has been submitted for the Micl1igan-Pennsylvania debate is as follows : Resolved that the formation of trusts should be opposed by legislation. The debate will be l1eld in Philadelphia, March 9, 1900. In addition to the cup for the intercollegiate chess championship-won by Harvard the last £ve years-tl1ere is a trophy this year valued at $1,500, the possession of which will be decided by a cable match between an American college tearn and a team from Oxford or Cambridge.- Rutgers Targum. At a· tneeting of the Oxford and Cambridge officials recently it was decided to send a team of college athletes to this country next April to ·compete against the track and field athletes fron1 Yale and Harvard. The contests will probably be held on Manhattan Field, New York.-Cor- nell Daily Sun.

Her P·osition O-utlined. The following comtnunication is the report in full. of the committee of the Union Athletic Boanl a:tl the n1atter of the Union-Han1ilton f0otlla:U·game of Nov. 11, 1899.. This report w·as given to the press on ·\Vednesday, Jan. 17, and its unbiased treattnent of the facts in the case gained for it wide publication throughout the state. The atticle is in1portant as clearing Union CoUege from the gross· charges tnade against her studet1ts as a result of the game ; and accordingly it will be read with pleasure by alumni and friends of the institution. The controversy between Union and Hamilton colleges wh.ich has received co~siderable attention in the press for the past two months has now, it is believed, been terminated. It arose over the Hamil- to.n-Union football game played in Schenectady on Nov. 11, the Hantilton men alleging that their coach; E. R. Sweetland, was treated with violence by the Un:ion students at that time. This report was w-idely pttbli~hed. and natu.rally it did not reflect eredit upon Union. Accordingly both colleges appoi·nted investigating.committees, a joint meeti.ug.Qf which was held at Schenectady on Nov. 24~ At that thne. the Ham.ilton committee presented its o~eial ebarges in brief as follows: 1. Tha.t Unio~ manifested a spirit of anilnosity before and during lbe g.am·e. 2. That sufficient order was not preserved among the· s~pe~ta.1or~. 3. Thi\:t viQle.uee was used against E. R. Sweet- land, Ha.mllton '.s. coaeh. A ma3i of writt.en evidence \Vas collected by both sides .and eschanged, and Union's answer to the charges in the sh:ape of the following ultimatum, dated De<:.. 30, was s·ent to Hamilton on Jan. 7. On Jan. 13 Hamilton took action to withdraw trom the New York State Inter-collegiate Athletic un~ion. The document is interesting as setting forth briefly Union's attitude in the whole matter, !tnd it also shows that Hamilton withdrew from t~e league only after Union bad severed athletic rela- tions with her. ''To the Hatnilton College Athletic association- Gentlemen : At a meeting of the athletic board of Union College, held Dec. 16, 1899, Professor Opdyke, in behalf of Union's undergraduate investigating committee, reported the charges made by Hamilton College in reference to the Hamilton-Union football game of Nov. 11 and submitted the work of the Union and of the Hamilton committee, together with the correspondence and papers in the case. A thorough discussion of the matter was had., cer· tain conclusions drawn, and a committee appointe(} to submit such conclusions to the representativesof Hamilton College. The case in brief appears to us thus: The Hatnilton team appeared upon Union's grounds Nov. 11 with a Hamilton alumnus to act as its official, 1-Iamilton 's manager having ·.pr~ ... viously written Union for its official, saying ·that he believed that in league games it was necessary to have other than a man from one's own colleg-e, and Union's manager having in reply named its official, a Cornell man. Union protested, but Hamilton refused to play unless its alumnus was allowed, and Union yield.ed. This discussion took place on the campus a:nd occupied some time and delayed the commencing ()f the game when darkness was likely to come on too soon. The action of Hamilton in this ·particular was not likely to inspire the onlookel\s with respect. The game was played on the college campus, .a level grass-covered field. A rope was str-etebed along as a barrier to keep the spectators <df ·il\e players' field. Two policemen were in attendan.ee, the college officer and a special. These are tbe usual precautions Union has heretofore foun.d sufficient to preserve order. Mr. Sweetland made himself obno~i9U.S tQ tb.e spectators by repeatedly going on the l'la.y~.n'\&' field beyond the side lines and disr~g-art:ll~g requests to keep off; by apparently coaching his team; and by walking along one side .of the rope:~~

THE CONCORDIENSIS. the spectators being on the other, and there exhibit- ing some bills to the spectators and asking who would cover them. The Hamilton referee tnad.e some wrong decisions, at least once refused a measurement when one was called for, refused to reverse himself when convicted of an error and convinced the spectators that he was .not altogether fair. .He even became a stake- holder for some of Sweetland's bets. The Hatnilton referee was several tin1es requested to keep Sweetland off the :field while the play was in progress, who replied that he would do as he saw fit. The acts on the part of the referee and the coach naturally exasperated the spectators. Finally towards the end of the gatne when it was growing dark and the play going on, Sweet- land rushed on the field to one of his men and touched hint. As Sweetland starJed the crowd shouted to the officer to put Sweetland off the field; an officer ran to him and a number of the crowd likewise. His friends claim he was roughly handled. Perhaps he was, but the statetnents subn1itted to us by the Union committee do not show anything very serious, while the statements submitted by the Hamilton committee are sOine- what conflicting, one being that the officers were shoving Sweetland off the field, one holding him by the coat near the throat with one hand, while with the other he brandished his club near Sweet- land's face; another that he saw Sweetland struck and kicked, always from behind; while a third says the policeman had no n1ore to do with taking Sweetland off the field than did any other tnan in the crowd except that he opposed him (Sweetland going off the :field backward) and took a leading part in rushing him back; while another says he has personal knowledge that policemen beat Sweet- land with their clubs. Sweetland himself·makes no statement. At all events it is clear that Sweetland during the game was frequently on the :field, where he had no right to be; that his conduct was offensive and exasperating, and that he was irrepressible in unreasonable meddling with the play. We regret exceedingly that Hamilton insisted upon having an alumnus act as its official; we regret that Mr. Sweetland's conduct was such as it was; while we, at the same time, are of the opinion that, had Hamilton chosen an alumnus other than of her own college to act as its official and restrained Sweetland within proper bounds, the game would have passed off to· the entire satis- faction of all concerned. However much we may deplore the effect upon the spectators of an incompetent referee and an ()Ver-zealous coach, yet we do not hold ourselves responsible for that mental phenome~on . a~d, it seems to u.s, ought not to be held responsib(e for its mallifestations. As to the charg~ that Union ·was anima~ed by a spirit of animosity towa~d Hamilton before the game, we believe that no such spirit existed. ~ut for the occurrences during the game we do not believe Hatnilton would have entertained such a charge a. moment; and t.hp$e occ\lrli~nces we. think, . ~ . . . i\' are referable to Hamilton~s coach and' tefere,e.

Miniature lakes were scattered over the surface (and a few underneath) and what snow the rain had left was just right according to public opinion. A.s the Sophs came out of chapel they wet·e geeeted with a volley of snowballs by some F1·()sh and so the fight was brought on. The usual exchange of frozen compliments which give the name to the scrap, but play a very stnall part in the afl1·ay now, had lasted but for a short time, when the Sophs showed good leadership in changing their headquarters from in front of cl1apel up the lane toward the woods, as this brought thetn further fron1 the terrace. The Frosh finally realized the main obJect of the fight and began dragging 1902 across the earn pus, wiping up the sn1alle1· pools and dis- tributing the larger more evenly. Nearer . and nearer to the ''grand old seat of stone\ sur~ed the battling cotnpound of humanity, water and mother earth. The Frosh had the advantage of numbers, or rather would have had it if so many of their tnen had not tried to stand around among the upper classmen, and when they decided that a tnan should go over he went, and the . ' ditlerent attitudes that were assumed in going down the slide and into the water would have furnished a school of artists \vith tnaterial for scores of pictures. At last the noble leader of the freshtnen acquired the faculty of escaping and immediately i rnproved his opportunities. His wretched followers gazed enviously after him and wished they had the self-same faculty. Under this treasonable blow the Freshmen lost heart and the Sophs, who had lost about everv- ., thing else, con1ing to a silent mutual agreetnent, dissolved themselves an~ evapotated into the dense fog which surrounded them.

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS. MIN;t,I;UI' COLLEGE ENTRANCE 'RE- llJlREMENTS IN HISTO:RY. Under tbe tyranny of the classics, history was taught in the preparatory schools as a sub-ordinate subject. J:t was barely tolerated and then only as a hand-maid to Latin and Greek. It is truly a commentary upon past educational ideals that ''the most human of all studies should have been a slave to the bttm ani ties.'' But the day of emancipation is at .hand and the time is not far distant when history will take that position in the preparatory school curriculum that its merits as a disciplinary and educational power demands. When well taught, there is no subject that trains the mind, strengthens the powers of judgment, and creates a .proper perspective better than history. But tl1at is just where its educational thraldom has been most harmful to it. Prior to the present reform, any one was considered competent to teach the subject. In the preparatory schools especially, it had been passed from the teacher of physical culture, to the teachers of dra·wing, tnusic, and wh~t not nntil its representatives had become thorough.ly disheartened and wondered if next it would be confided to the tender mercies of the scrub-woman and the janitor. Since the memorable reports of the Committee of Ten, the Columbian conference, and the committee on colleg:(!-~ntrance requirements to the National Educational Association, a remarkable change has taken plac~. The Madison Conference on History, Civil Go-vernment, and Economics submitted its conclusions to the Committee of Ten in 1892. That year mark~ the beginning of scientific reform in the teacb.in~ of history in the preparatory schools. The conclusions of the Madison Conference have a fitting climax in the admirable report of the Com- mittee of Seven published during the current year. The peri<>d of six years between the publication of the rep<>rts of these two committees has ·witnessed the growth of a healthy sentiment towards the study of h.istory in the preparatory schools. It has resulted, for the most part, in the liberation of history fro-m its subserviency to Latin and Greek. Students should no longer be taught Roman history .solely that they may the better appreciate Cicero, or Grecian history that they may more satisfactorily comprehend Demosthenes. It is 3:lmost reversing the true order not to do so. History is the help-meet of the Ron1an and Greek classics but not the slave. The emancipation of history being an acconl- plished .'fact in the best preparatory schools and its restoration to its proper place in the curri- culum being .rapidly advanced .towards accom· plishment, it is in order to as~,.wh ... tis. tba~ proper place? In oth~r words ~nd from .an9tber ,point of view, what should be the minimum coll~ge-=-~ntrauc~ requir~ments? From a theoretical and general point. of. view~ oue of the recom·mendations.of the Committee of ·s~ven for a four years' course in preparatory schwls is without exception. It is as follows : First year.-· Ancient History to 800 A. D. Second year.-Medireval .and Modern European History. Third year.-English History. Fourth year.-· American History a11d Civil Government. Each subject should be taught at least three periods a week throughout each year. No exception can be found to this schedule from a theoretical and general point of view. But, as the committee frankly admits, in its application to specific conditions, it might be necessary and, in many cases, it would be well to modify the schedule. In the State of New York, this would seem to be advisable. Not that the recommendations .might not in time be carried out to the letter--on the con· trary quite the reverse is true-but that from the point of view of expediency it would be better to modify the existing preparatory school curriculum than to revolutionize it. Such has been the remark· able improvement made in this State in the posi· tion of history in the school curriculum that modi:fication according to the ideal schedule of the Committee of Seven would not be the almost impos· sible task that one might think. A table* is appended that will illustrate this fact. This table has been arranged from material collected from over a hundred students now in residence at Union College. In selecting from their material, care has been taken as to the following important points: 1. That only the best and most complete cases be selected. 2. That they be taken to represent those pre- paratory schools that are geographically dis- tributed over the whole State. 3. That urban and rural schools be approx- imately equally represented. 4. That cases be taken from the Senior, Junior, Sophomore, and Freshman classes and from all the different courses. 5. That good, bad, and indifferent ·schools be proportionally represented. The table is given merely for illustration ,,a:nd claims no scientific valu~. .It :lJJ~Y . b~ .ew~n .ml~,.

By far the most pt·ominent sub- jects taught in the preparatory schools are, as would be naturally supposed, United States, English, Roman, and Grecian history; 2.) the percentage of students taking United States and English history has steadily increased within the last fOl,tr years while almost the reverse is true \Vith respect to Roman and Grecian history; 3.) tl1at the portion of a year devoted to United States history has steadily increased while with respect Senior 27 44:~ \% 3 4472 7-2 3~ 83 1 2 Junior 11 52;2 12 3~ 5372 ·~ 373 7~ ~ 2!4 63~ ~ 3 Sopho- more. 22 55 % 3%; 50 72 3 86 ~ 3~4 w;~ % 372 I~'resh- man. 40 88 %, 4: to the other three 110 material cha11ge has taken place; 4.) that while the number of periods per week devoted to the study of United States, Roman, and Grecian history has steadily increased, no material change has occurred with respect to English history ; 5.) that with respect to all four subjects the average ntunber of periods per week i.s three. If wider and more careful investigation prove that these conclusions drawn fron1 this table are, in the main, indicative of the actual facts, then will we not be warranted in claiming that progress in history in the preparatory schools of this State is evolving a schedule that is not very dissimilar in essential points to a schedule for four years recommended by the Committee of Seven? And furthermore, could not the following schedule serve as a working basis for our preparatory schools from which to work up to the recommenda- tions of the Committee of Seven? If our table is at all trustworthy this schedule is, in fact, an average of what the schools are offering at present in history. Points in favor of this schedule might be urged apart from its character as a temporary basis from which to work towards a better, but to do so would be to attempt more than we set out to do. This is the schedule so proposed and the one furnishing the basis for entrance requirements to college: First year.-Grecian History-3 hours a week. Second year .-Roman History-3 hours a week. Third year.-English History-3 hours a week. Fourth year.-American History and Civics-3 hours a week. Of course, modifications of this to fit a two or three years' course could be arranged on the basi~ THE SOPHOMORE DANCE. Soiree to be Held in Memorial Hall, February 23.

Y.,. as second- class matter. Chas. Burrows, Printer, 414 State Street, Schenectadv, N.Y. THE ATTENTION of the students is called to the annual oratorical contest between Rochester, Syra- cuse and Union which will be held this term at Syracuse. There have been six contests before this, Union's representative winning the key twice, and we must add another victory to our record this year. Men should be as ready to represent Union on the platform as on the gridiron or diamond, for all add to her honor. Any member of the literary societies n1ay enter the prelhnin ary contest to represent the Garnet. Let the cotnpetition be sharp so that the best tnan will have to hustle for the place. WITH commendable enterprise the Press club has appointed a con1mittee to get the students to send their Concordienses to the preparatory schools from which they entered college. At the opening of the college year we urged the subseribers to keep files of the college weekly. Some are doing this, while others-and these are the majority-do not the iatter that the Press club now makes its appeal. If heeded, it will certainly be the means of better keeping the college before the prep. schools fr01n which she draws her students; and will also probably result in turning toward Union many a young fellow as yet undecided where he will get his college education. THE REPORT of the Athletic board comn1ittee on the trouble over the Hamilton-Union football gatne is published in another column. Unbiased and fairminded, the report is typical of Union's whole course throughout the controversy, the details of which are known to all. But now that athletic relations have been broken off, The Concord i- e n sis , as the representative of Union's under- graduate body, wishes to call attention to son1e facts and draw obvious conclusions therefrom. In the first place, note the conduct of both colleges immediately after the much-discussed game. Hatnilton, believing her coach has been ill-treated, rushes into the public print and hurls innumerable charges against Union without the slightest proof to back them up-charges that in the official cor- respondence were not even preferred. This public demonstration of hot-headed calumny is followed by the appearance of a so-called college paper, \The Han1ilton Life\ (well named, forsooth) its columns filled with wholesale abuse directed against the football team of Union College, her student body, all her athletics, her morals, her methods, her traditions-in fact everything and everybody connected with the institution. On the other hand is the attitude of ·union, sutnn1ed up as it n1ay be in one word-dignity. At the first intimation of the word unfairness on her campus Union appoints a committee to investigate, and then, though Hamilton continues her attack, Union maintains a dignified silence, only asking for equal fairness on Han1ilton 's part, till charges at·e officially brought and answer made. The investigating cotnmittees of both coll~ges hold a joint n1eeting. Hatnilton presents her charges, elsewhere enun1erated, and Union on her side makes objection to the attitude of the public press and that of Hatnilton College. As a result of preserve the papers after they are read. It is to the meeting there is made public a statement that,

THE OONCORDIENSIS. 11 ''The joint cotnmittee regrets that many unofficial and decidedly biased accoants of the game have been printed, and in justice to both colleges desires that no tnore be published until the worlc of the investigating comn1ittee is finished and a !eport submitted.\ :By ''a report\ was explicitly under- stood a joint report. Very well, this is the agree- tnent. \Vas it lived up to? In its next issue The Goncordiensispublishesan editorial indignined protest against the attitude adopted by the Hanlil- ton Life, a protest written at the suggestion of the Union committee and \Vith the consent of Mr. Andrews, chairman of the Hamilton committee. So n1uch for Union. How about Hamilton? In the issue of .Dec. 4 of the Hamilton Life, the editors, after deprecating any further correspondence between the two committees, boldly advocate that Hatnilton have no further dealings with Union. But that is not all. In the Hamilton Review for Decen1ber the vituperative abuse is continued and at least eight separate statements are tnade, as distinctly false as any ever in print. And all this after the understanding that nothing more was to be published. This is the way Hamilton keeps faith l In the ultimatum referred to, Union's main point was that Hamilton express regret for the publica- tion of unfair articles in the press. Here is Hamil- ton's reason for not complying with the request. ''They cannot express regret for anything over which they have no control.'' This, then, is a sad state of affairs. The student body of Hamilton College has no authority over the ·undergraduate publications or the college correspondents for out- side papers! But the weakness of the argument is self-evident. Grant that the Hamilton students are not responsible for what was published. Then if they do not agree with the stand taken by their press, why do they not cotne out like men and acknowledge their regret for it? Or i£ they do agree with the sentiments there expressed, why cover up their true opinion with a -flimsy excuse? But how about their cotnmittee 's entering into an agreement which it well knew could never be ful- filled in so far as Hamilton was concerned? A sad condition of affairs indeed. At Union, we are glad to say the motto is not ''Everyone for himself\ but ''Individual opinions always secondary to col- lege interests''; and tbrougbout this controversy there has been at Union' an entire unanimity of feeling, in marked contrasit~ tlie dissent of factions at Hamilton. Now we have briefly outil ined the history of the trouble, and attempted to point out the grounds upon which each college based its claims. Union was willing to make certah.1 concessions, for, as in every question, she realized that in this there were two sides. And so with true sportsmanlike spirit she proposed arbitra:tion as a. means of adjustment. The offer was declined. Comment is unnecessary. The case judges itself, and is dismissed. SUNDAY AFTERNOON'S SERVICE. Quite a large nutnber of the students gathered in the chapel on Sunday afternoon, and had the opportunity of listening to the Rev. Herbert C. Hinds, Union '82. Mt-. Rinds took for his text, \Run speak to this y()ung man.\ His text was well suited to his t;fu.erne, and his discourse was one which cannot fail to exert its influence over the students. ''Youth '' he said ''~is a most precious thing. It is the Spring time oflife, the morning of the day of existence, the time when we take firm hold on the present. It is unscarred by the battles of life, unstain~d, and full of hope. Youth is the time for young men to settle their destinies, a time of opportunity, a time when we pass the crisis in. life, and the titne for us to beco1ne Christians. 'lhe great men in history are those who settled tl1eir destinies in youth, when the he~rt of tnan is soft and pliable. The speaker then urged n1anliness as a cardinnl virtue in the young n~~n, and closed \vith an appeal that more stt.Hlents be drawn into the religious work of tl1e college. A meeting of the executive cotn tnittee of the Albany Alumni Assoc ia.tion was held Mondav . \ to prepare for the an.uual dinner, which will be held at the Ten Eych, Albany, Friday, Feb. r6. i' I .

The regular weekly meetings, with a full attendance of the men1bers, are the only tneans for securing this strength. Every n1an can add something by his presence, and by expressing his opinions. i\.s the time is short, an appeal is made that the members turn out in full force at the tneetings of their respective societies, and also that those who are not yet enrolled as rr1ernbers, join as soon as possible.

The college is to be congratulated on securing Dr. Richards, of Plainfield, N. J., to preach the sermon on the Day of Prayer. Dr. Richards is very popular among college men and each year has many invitations to preach at eastern colleges. Those who are attending Dr. Truax's Eible Class at the First Presbyterian Church speak in the highest terms of the course. The text book is the Drama of Job, and is studied as any masterpiece in literature would be. The beauties that were obscured by the old-style method of printing have been brought to light by Prof. Moulton's work. Those who have taken class room work under Prof. Truax, know ho\v admirable be ·is fitted for just such work. lie is always glad to see any of the students, and many find the hour between 12 and ron Sund~y~ spent in his class, interesting and profitable.

T'he recent agitation in regard to the adoption of a uniforn1 system of college entra11ce require- tnents and exatninations has resulted in several conferences between the presidents of the insti- tutions concerned. The following is the result of the action taken at New York City during the hoi idays. Dr. Raymond acted as Union's repre- sentative at the conference. NEw YoRK, Decernber 22, r899· At the tneeting of the Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools in the Middle States and Maryland, held at Trenton, N.J., Decem- ber 2, the following resolutions were unani- tnously adopted: Resolved, That this association urges the early establishment of a joint college admission examin- ation board, composed of representatives of colleges and of secondary schools in the Middle States and Maryland, which shall endeavor to bring about as rapidly as possible an agreement upon a unifonn statement as to each subject required by two or more colleges for admission; to hold or cause to be held, at convenient points, in June of each year, a series of -college admission examinations, with uni- form tests in each subject, and issue certificates based upon the results of such examinations. .Resolved, That in case such a board be estab~ lished before the ne:xt meeting of this association, the Executive Committee be empowered to desig- nate the representatives of secondary schools to serve upon such a board until December, 1900. Resolved, That the several colleges in the Middle States and Mat·yland be requested by this asso- ciation to accept the certificates issued by such joint College Admission Examination Board, so far as they go, in lieu of their own separate admis- sion examinations. Resolved, That these resolutions be printed and the secretary instru~teq to forward ~ copy to the president or principal of each institution on the membership ,roll of this association. In accot·dance with these resolutions the following call was issued Decetnber 14: In view of the resolutions unanitnously adopted a:t the n1eeting of the Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools in the Middle States and Maryland, at their n1eeting held December 2, 1899, urging the early establishment of a Joint College Adtnission Examination Board, an invi- tation is now extended to each college in the Middle States and Maryland having during the present year a freshman class (courses in arts and in sciences being counted together for this purpose) of not less than fifty n1embers, to send a representative to a tneeting to be held at Coltunhia University, on Friday, December 22, at 10 A. M., to undertake the establishment of such a Board. It is hoped that the response to this invitation tnay be pro111pt and cordial, inastnuch as thet·e is every reason to believe that public opinion is ready to welcome the step contemplated. It will be borne in mind that the resolutions referred to contemplate a Board on which the secondary schools shall have formal represen- tatives, and in accordance with those resolutions it is the purpose to ask the Executive Committee of the Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools in the Middle States and Mary land, to natne the representatives of the secondary schools who are to serve upon the proposed :Board for the first year of its existence. Respectfully, CHARLES c. HARRISON, Provost Univ. of Pennsylvania. SETH Low, President Columbia University. A. v. v. RAYMOND, President Union University. JAcoB G. ScHURMAN, President Corn~ll University,

THE OON'OORDIENSIS. In response to this call, the following dele- gates n1et at Columbia University on December 22, at 10 A. M.: Prof. Butler, Coluntbia Uni- versity; Dean Crawshaw, Colgate University; Prof. Latnberton, University of Pennsylvania; President Low, Columbia University; Chan- ceUor McCracken, New York U niv.ersity ; D·ean Putnam, Barnard College ; President Raymond, Union University; President Scott, Rutget·s College; President Taylor, Vassar College; President Thon1as, Bryn Mawr College ; Dean Van Amringe, Colutnbia University; Professor West, Princeton University; Dean Van Meter, Woman's College of Baltit11ore; Dean White, Cornell University; Mr. Fan·and, Newark Acaden1y; Dr. Goodwin, Mixed High School, New York; Dr. Sachs, Collegiate Institute, New York. President Low was elected Chairman, and Mr. Farrand, Secretary. The following is a sun1tnary of the action taken at the meeting: It was voted that the Conference proceed to the organization of such a board as is described in the resolutions adopted at Trenton and in the call for this tneeting, it being understood that every college shall be free to take part or not to take part in the adtninistration of the Board so established, and to accept or not to accept the results of ex~uninations as certified by such Board. It was voted that the Board be known as the \College Entrance Examination Board.\ It was voted that in the judgment of the Con- ference the Board should consist of the execu- tives, or their representatives, of the colleges concerned, and the representatives of the second- ~ry schools to be appointed by the Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools of the Middle States and Maryland. It was voted that a sub-cornn1ittee of five, consisting of three representatives of the colleges, and two of schools, be appointed by the Chair- man to draft a constitution and rules for the College Entrance Exatnination Board, and to report at the next meeting of this Conference. It was further voted that the Chairman be requested to. appoint Professor Butler chairn1an of the sub-committee, It was voted that the Report of the Committee of the National Educational Association on College Entrance Requirements be recotnmended to the sub-co1nn1ittee as a guide in their deliber· ations, and that the comn1ittee be further reeomrnended to secure by conference or other- wise, information concerning systems of exa- minations in this and other countries. rt was voted that the ne:xt ;meeting of the Con- fet;ence he held at the call of President Low. After the reading and approval of the minutes the tneeting adjourned. The following Sub-Cotntnittee was appointed by Pxesident Low: Prof. Butler, Chairtnan ;· Prof. West, Prof. White, Dr. Goodwin, Mr. Farrand. WILSON FARRAND, Secretary. A TWENTIETH CENTUQY QAILQOAD. There are graduates of Union who tell of cotning to college by stage coach or canal packet. The story is always interesting as showing the progress which has been 1nade in means of transportation within the tnetnory of 1nen still living, but the story is not cotnplete until the contrast is made with the largest and best facilities offered today. N O\IV here can this be done better than right here on the line of the Nevv York Central railroad. There are rail- l·oads and railroads, but in many respects the New ):.,.ork Central is the railroad of America, with its four tracks, its splendid equipment, and its almost perfect service. Whatever is found to add to the safety or comfort or con- venience of travellers is in11nediately adopted. Those who are fatniliar with the history of the road a1·e warm in their expressions of apprecia- tion of the present tnanagement, and among all the officials no one is entitled to tnore praise than George H. Daniels, the General Passenger Agent, since it is doubtless through him that the improvements are introduced that concern t11ost closely the traveling public. The students of Union who profit by his enterprise l1ave reason also to be grateful to him for special · courtesies. May the New York Central prosper as it deserves, and George H. Daniels prosper with it. - '.•i ., ..... ;<:

8 THE ·CONOORDIENSIS. Judge Landon's Appointment to the Court of Appeals. The many friends of Hon. Judson S. Landon, especially his friends who are ·connected with Union whose interests he has had so tnuch at heart and has so diligentlJ served for tnany years, are glad to know that he has been tendered a seat on the bench of the N e·w York State Court of Appeals and has seen fit to accept the appointtnent. The appointtnent was tnade by Governor Roosevelt on January first and was accepted the following day. Two other appointn1ents were tnade the satne day, all in pursuance of an act of the last legislature providing for the appointn1ent of three associate justices of the court of appeals in order to relieve the extretne pressure of business which has been accumulating on the calendar. Judge Landon's high reputation and talent as a jurist rnake it plain to all that the appointtnent was a wise act and well deserved. He was born in Salisbury, Conn., in 1832, and received the major part of his education in the Amenia and New York Conference Sen1inaries. He taught for a tin1e in the Princetowl'l Acadetny and was given the degree of Master of Arts by Union in 1856. He studied law and was adtnitted in I856. He cotnmenced practice in Schenectady and was soon after elected district attorney. This office he held two terms, and served fro1n I 865 to I87o as county judge and surro~ate. In r865 he received the degree of LL. D. from Rutgers College. Judge Landon \Vas a metnber oi the constitutional convention of 1867-8 and was elected to the suprerne court, fourth district, in I 873, at the end of his term being reelected as the candidate of both parties. l-Ie was appointed to the general term by Governor Cleveland and to the court of appeals by Governor Hill. After the dissolution of the then court of appeals he returned to the supreme court bench and was later assigned to the appellate division by Governor Morton. It is from this bench that he is raised to the court of appeals. Judge Landon has always been a firm friend of Union College in nutnberless ways. He has been trustee for n~any years and was its presi- dent ad lnterltn frotn June 1884 until June r888. A series of lectures to the senior class, delivered by bin while president, was published by Houghton, Mifflin & Co., Boston, and is cited as autl1ority on constitutional history and governtnent or the United States. He is at present a lecturer in the Albany Law School. Judge Landou is a member of Delta Upsilon. :LirEQAQY NOTES. The topics editoriaily treated in the American Monthly Review of l{eviews for February are the Nicaragua Canal proposition now before Congress, the Canadian and Erie Canal projects, underground transit in New York and else- \V here, the currency and business situation, the Treasury and the banks, the popular election of Senators, Mr. Beverige's speech in the Senate on the Philippine question, our tariff policy in Puerto Rico and Cuba, the meaning of \neu- trality\ in the Boer war, and the strength and weakness of the Boer position. The number includes articles on Dwight L. Moody, Gen. Lawton, and Lord Roberts; \A French View of the Gertnan E111 pire\ ; ''The Perilous Posi- tion of England\ and \The Treasury and the Money Mar :ket.\ Honot·able 1'l1omas B. Reed, in writing of the tnodern trust, does not seem to regard it either as an \octopus or a bugaboo. \ My notion,\ says he, \is that while Providence and the higher laws which really govern the universe are, in rnen~s talk, n1 uch inferior to the Revised Statutes before th.ey are enacted, they are always found to be quite superior to thetn after they are enacted. In fact, Nature abhors a monopoly as much as it does a vacuum.\ Mr. Reed's paper on Monopolies-which is to appear in The Saturday Evening Post of February ro-is a suggestive discllssion of the methods of vast corporations. It discusses in a striking and original manner one of the most pressing ques- tions of the day.

THE CONCORDIENSIS,. THE CIGA~~s AlOMA.. I wonder is it the moo11ligh.t, '\Vith its beams so wondrous fair, And the almost blissful stillness, That drive from my :soul the care? Can it be the scents of the roses, '\Vhich rises on the evening air, That make me forget ihe present And think of things that were? Is it the gleaming brightness, Of the moon bean1s 011. the sea, That awakens old thoughts and old fancies; Past pleasures, enjoyed by me? Or is it the sound of th.e 1nusic, Pealed out from the organ's heart, That bids me look higher and higher, From the vice of the world apart? No, 'tis not the odor of flowers, Nor the tnoonlight gleatning afar. 'Tis not the soft strains of n1usic, But the scent of my soothing cigar. -AR'l'HUR G. PICKENS, 1903. ALBANY ALUMNI DINNEQ. It has been decided t<> hold the banquet of the Alutnni Association of North-eastern New York at Hotel TenEyck, in Albany, on Friday even· ing, February sixteenth. Extensive prepara- tions are being tnade for the event, and it protnises to be an occasion of unusual Interest. Many pron1inent speaket·s are to be present, and a large number of the alumni from this part of the state, as well as from more distant places, have promised to attend. The executive com- mittee, which has the banquet in charge, is cotnposed of the following alumni : Grenville ~I. Ingalsbee, '68 ; Franklin W. McClellan, '83 ; Col. vVilliam F. Fox, !'6o; Edward P. White, '77 ; Prof. Cornelius E. Fra11ldin, '8o; David Muhlfelder, 'So; Frederick W. Cameron, '81 ; Dr. Andrew Macfarlane, '84; Allan H. Jack- son, '86 ; Prof. Albert 1-I. Pepper, '87 ; Robert F. Gilmour, '94; Willis :E. Merriman, Jr., 'g8, and James N. Van der Veer, '99; William Platt Rudd, '73, is president of the association; Sey- mour Van Santvoord, '78, of Troy is vice-presi- dent, and Charles F. Bridge, '87, secretary and treasurer. llOOSEVEL'T CHANCELLOR FO:Q 1900. The Governor Accepts Election of the Trustees. At its regular semi-annual meeting of the trustees of the college held at Albany, Tuesday afternoon, Governor Theodore Roosevelt was elected honorary chancellor for the year 1900. Ron. Daniel Scott Lamont of New York, and Williatn Birch Rankine of Buffalo, were elected life trustees to fill the vacancies in the board caused by the decease of Lemon Thotnson, '40 and Robert Carter Alexander, '8o. The gov- ernor has accepted the office, and will address the graduating class at commencement. The newly elected trustees are both Union men and have national protninence. Daniel S. Latnont, '72, was Secretary of War during the term of Cleveland's second administration, and acted as his private secretary during the first term in the presidency and throughout his administra- tion as governor of New York. William B. Rankine, '77, is a well known New York capitalist, and is at the head of the Niagara Power and Construction company, which has succeeded in utilizing the Niagara Falls water power on a magnificent scale. The trustees adopted resolutions on the death of Mr. Alex- onder, and appointed Howard Opdyke at the head of the department of physics with the title of assistant professor. INTE:QCOLLEGIA. TE.

Y., as second- class matter. Chas. :Burrows, Printe1·, 414 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. THE DIENNIAL state convention of the Y. M. C. A., to be held at Kingston, February 15-18, ought to attr~ct several representatives from the college branch. An interesting program has been arranged. THE UNIVERSITY l3ANQUET, to be held at Hotel Vendome in this city next Friday, ought to attract a large number of students and alumni from all departments of the university. It is the duty of every tnan hi college to attend. JUST A WORD about our advertisers. They con- tribute very largely toward the support of The Concordiensis, and it is only fair that those who aid the college organizations should in turn be patronized by the college students. The firms are all reliable ones, and we recommend that when in need of any goods the students glance through our advertising columns. THE ATTENTION of the students is called to the communication printed in another column. Just at this time it comes with special appropriateness, and should be read carefully by every man in the university. Editorial cotnment is impossible in this issue owing to the late hour at which the letter was received. We shall hope, however, to have something to say on the subject next week. BASE BALL from now until the end of this college. year ought to receive a large part of the attention of the students. Every man in college should be willing to lend whatever aid he can, whether by training for the team or by his financial support. The men have been put to work earlier this year than heretofore, and since it is hard training of good material that produces the fast team, there is every reason to expect that the season ·Of 1900 will be a successful one for Union. The schedule of games as arranged by Manager Tuggey is pub- lished exclusively in another column. THE COLLEGE authorities are to be congratulated upon the early appearance of the catalogue. For some years past its publication has been unneces- sarily delayed until near the end of the winter term or even as late as the spring term, and in the meantime applications for it from prospective students have had to remain unfilled. This year we are glad to see that such a state of affairs does not exist. In line with this idea The Concordi- ensis desires to call attention to the excelle~t manage1nent at the college office. Under the efficient direction of Mr. McCord the work of the office has been thoroughly systetnatized and the order there is now well nigh perfect. The students appreciate this,- and so must every one else who has come into contact with the 'Workings of the office. AGAIN the editors wish to bring to the attention of the students the rule of the faculty which offers as a substitute for essays and orations literary productions published in The Concordiensis. The majority of men in college do not seem to

THE. CO.NCORDIENSlS. i1 ' stand that the paper is published not only by the students but jof them. The Medical, Pharmacy and Law men should realize the advantage thus offered, or su.rely there would be more enjoying the benefits of the system. When approached on the subject the average student ridicules the i:dea of his turning out a story for the \The Concordy\ but ten to one that satne man will grind out an oration of a thousand words, commit it to memory, and deliver it in chapel. The faculty wish to encourage the literary side of the college paper and they are willing to accept in lieu of an oration from each student a literary article of aln1:ost any type-narration, exposition, description, or ''what-not\-provided its merit is commensurate with the standard of tbe paper. Stories, character-sketches, and essays on timely subjects, if well written, are acceptable matter, and due credit for all such will be given in the department of Rhetoric. Orations will be fee~ that the -controversy with Hamilton is their matter too, and should feel no hesitancy in standing , by the ''Garnet. '' Let us look again at the seal.

Sir : I beg the privilege of a small amount of space in the '' Concordy '' in order to make a plea for more university sentiment in Union. The seal of Alma Mater reads Universitas Con- cordite. This seal is printed on the cover of the paper representing the Universitas and within the cover is evident a most apparent lack of University sentiment. Why should teams, clubs of different kinds 1 and other organizations be known as representing Union College? Why not Union Unh-ersity? JJ1ake the Law, Medical and Pharmacy men feel and realize that they are Union men, that they are sons of Uttiversitas Concordice. If an earnest effort be made to establish closer relations between the college and the departmeuts at Albany, I atn sure from what I have seen, it will be successful. There is no way to do it e:xcept to }{eep pounding at it until the end beaccomplish.ed. Will The Concordiensis do all in its power to bring about better relations, not only between the departments, but between corresponding classes in tl~e departments? Have representatives from all departments on committees; do everything to estab- lish a sentiment for Union University.

12 THE .CONCORDIENSIS. FI~ST JUNIOR HOP. Jack Frost Fails to Subdue 1901's Hos- pitality., 1901's initial entertainment as upper classtnen Friday ev~ning, proved a decided success. Notwithstanding the fact that a frigid temper- ature accompanied by a cutting wind prevailed without, n1errhnent reigned within the Boat House. Through the efforts of the cotnmittee, the dance proved anything but a failure. Many of Dorp's fairest w.ere present, while the total attendance was considerably augmented by the presence of a nun1 ber of men from the General Electric works. The music, the floor, the refreshn1ents,-in fact everything that goes to make a college dance successful, were of the highest order. No programs were used and thus the dance was made much more informal and attractive. rhe patronesses 'vere several of the young married ladies of Schenectady. When the last quivering notes of the violin ceased shortly after two o'clock, everyone left for hotne, declat·ing the hop a royal success. Those present were: Mrs. J. H. Jenkins, Mrs. Hubbell Robinson, Miss Sumt\llerhays of New Rochelle, Miss Backus of New York City, Miss Sanford of Rocl1ester, and the Misses Schuyler, Price, Fuller, Paige, Mabel Horstmann, School- craft, Maude Horsttnann, Dora Yates, Clark, Beattie, Walker, Furman, Kriegsmann, Harbi- son, and Lewis; JYiessrs.

Plans Outlined for the Coming Season on the Diamond. Manager Tuggey has been hard at work d ttr- ing the past few weeks arranging the base ... ball schedule for the season of 1900. Owing to the disturbance in the New York State Intercollegiate Union, the list has not yet been fully completed. The manager has endeavored to arrange gan1es strictly collegiate, and to avoid contests with professional and setni: professional teams. While the number of gan1es must necessarily be limited, yet an average of two games per week has been reached. The season will be opened by a couple of practice games on the campus with some local teatn on April 14th and 18th. The schedule, as it stands at present, is as follows : April 21, West Point at West Point. April 2f, Vermont at Schenectady. April 27, Columbia at Albany. April 28, C. C. N.Y. at Schenectady. May 2, Syracuse ( ?) at Schenectady. May 5, Hobart ( ?) at Schenectady. May 10, Middlebury at Middlebury, Vt. May 1 I, Vermont at Burlington, Vt. May I 2, Vermont at Burlington, Vt. May I 7, Tufts at Schenectady. May 23, Colgate at Schenectady. May 26, Middlebury at Schenectady. May 30, Dartmouth at Albany (2 games). June I, Syracuse ( ?) at Syracuse. June 2, Hobart ( ?) at Geneva. June 6, Willi a n1s at Willhnnstown, Mass .. June 9, Colgate at l-Iatnilton, N. Y. This schedule has not been rati fled as yet by the Athletic Board, and is therefore subject to change. R. H. Robinson, 1 gor, was compelled to return to his home in Middleburgh last Thurs- day, owing to a severe attack of tonsilitis. Dr. James S. Riggs, of Auburn Theological Seminary, will be· the speaker at the vesper servtce in the chapel on Sunday afternoon.

THE OONOORDIENSIS. 13 ~ .... _ ... ,. THE VE'SPEQ SE.QVICE. D.r. Ripton addressed the students at the Sunday afternoon service in the chapel. He gave some questions that cam.e to him during the sertnon last Thursday and the answet·s to them. The first was: \ Why should we have a Day of Prayer for <:oUege men more than for other nten ? \ Business men, or men out in the world in any positio11, certainly have even tnore temptations than college men. The answer the speaker gave to this was, because the college man has greater opportunities to do good in the world than other rnen. A day of prayer for colleges is especially appt·opriate, because there is a close connection betw·een religion and educa- tion. We have only to look back, and w~ find that the universities of Europe had their origin in some religious sect, and in the United States we have sectarian schools to a greater degree than do other countries. Except with Christians, religion and education have no connection, as will be seen from the ~ncients who had various forms of nature worship. They saw no distinc· tion between man and nature. But Christianity sees in its foundet- the Son of God, and shows us l1ow we rna y be made partakers of th.e Divine nature. Another question that arises is, \ Why should thet·e be in the United States that peculiar t·elation between education or schools and religion?\ A reason for this is found the characteristic feature of our country democracy. The Christian religion is democratic and teaches us the worth of every individual. The great value of religion is sl1own by the fact that the deepest life of a nation is its religious life, and every nation is best xnO\VU by i~ :religion. True education is also den1ocratic, f()r tbe highest ideal is only to be :attained through democratic principles. WASHINGTON A.LUMNI BANQUET. The fourth annual re-union and dinner of the Union College Alumni Association of Wash- ington will be given at the Hotel Raleigh next Monday evening. The dinner will be preceded by a reception to President Raymond of the university. TALK ON THE HILL. Robert F. Barrett, 1903, spent a few days of last week in the Metropolis.

President Raytnond will preach in the Brown Memorial ~burch at Baltimore next Sunday. The students are glad to vvelco1ne back Harry A. Barrett, 1901, wbo has just returned to college. The condition of his father and 1nother, who have been seriously ill for the past tnonth, is much in1proved. W. Scott Hunter, '68; Robert J. Landon, '8o, and Dr. Herman V. Mynderse, '84, were last week re-appointed to the School Board of Schenectady, by the .tnayor. Dr. Mynderse will resume his position as President of the Board. ALUMNI NEWS. '49.- J.
