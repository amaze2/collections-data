Vol. 111 I No. I Flashback: 40 Years Ago The fol.lowing article is reprinted from the CON- CORDIENSIS, September 19, 1941, exactly forty years ago. - The more things seem to change, the more they remain the same. Starting with a JUeeting of Freshmen in Old Chapel at lO:OOa.m. Monday:morning, the newly formed Freshmen Orientation Committee is ~eginning an active campaign for the enforcement of fresh- man rules. Although the pur- pose of the meeting has not been revealed it was announced that ' attendance would be taken and that the freshmen should bring their songbooks. The Freshman Orientation Committee was founded by the Student Colincillast June to fill the important gap left by the gradual deterioration of the old Sophomore Discipline Com- mittee. The- new committee aids tlte freshman by acclimating him to his new home. It is supposed to teach him the songs and cheers, insure ,_his frequent attendance at athletics contests, instruct him in the varied and ancient lore of the College, and see that he obeys the college rules for freshmen. Freshman Rules The following rules for fresh- men have been issued by the Student Council and will be ·enforced by the Orientation Committee: 1. Freshmen are to wear a Freshman Cap until the Christmas recess except on Sundays, recesses, or when out of town. These may be pur- chased in the College Book Store ' and are to be worn beginning Mopday, September 22. 2. Freshmen are to remain · seated in Daily Assembly until the upper 'Classmen have left the building. 3. Freshmen are to learn all the college songs and cheers. 4. Freshmen are not to walk upon the college lawns. The privilege of treading on the college lawns, an honor · usually reserved to upper classmen, may be granted to the freshmen by the Student Council until their victory in the annual cane rush. No plans for this year's .cane rush have been announced. ege.1877 Schenectady I New York September 1 9 I 1981 Garnet and White· History The Union of 1985 has been bequeathed a noble inheritance. This inheritance is the rich traditions, values, and history of Union College. The Orien- tation Committee .of 1981 believes that rediscovering Union's past will generate a greater sense of. pride in the college._ Discovering ''roots\ here at Union ties one to the past, helps in the understanding of the present. From its foun- . ding in 17.95 fl~ the first non- - denominational college in America to the present, Union -has served as a leader in American higher edJ.Ication. · Union has always been a place of firsts. It is now upto the Class of '85 to carry on in the spirit of the 189 Union classes that have preceded. '\' Did you know that ... Union was the · first college · charterred by the Regents of the State of New York and the original che.rter can be found in Jean Pelletierre's office in the library. Union's campus·, or more familiarly \The Grounds,'.' was the firstin America to. have an articulated architectural plan. It was designed in · 1813 by French architect Joseph Jacques Ramee. Union College is \The Mother of Fraternities.\ The first . college fraternities in America were established right here at Union: ·Kappa_ Alpha (1825), Sigma Phi (1827), Delta Phi (1827), and later, Psi Upsilon (1833), Chi Psi (1841), and Theta Delta Chi (1847). The first gymnasium erected in America, Old Gym Hall, was completed in 1874. The Nott Memorial \11nquestionably the symbol of Union College,\ is one of two 16- sided buildings in the Western Hemisphere. (The other is said to be_a Holiday Inn in Nashville, Your Orientation Committee Tenn.). \The Nott\ begun in 1858, is listed in the United States Register of Historic Places. The inscription, in Hebrew, reads, ''The day is short, the work is great; the master presses the wo1kmen.\ Union's radio station, WRUC, is America's first college radio stati<m. · South ·college, built in 1612, is the oldest continuously inhabited male dormitory in America. Eliphalet Nott was president of Union from 1804 to 1~66, the longest tenure of any American college president. He was president of Uni<m when Abraham Lincoln was born and was still president when he was assassinated. The movie, \The Way We Were/' was filmed at Union. Robert Redford stayed in a trailer behind South. College during the filming. Hans Groote's Kill (the \brook that bounds through ye Old Union's Grounds,\ as the alma mater suggests) . was named after a Dutch 'farmer whose fields covered much of the present campus. (Until the mid-1960s it was tradition for freshman to clean up Hans Groote's kill during orientation. Jackson's Garden was l>egun in the 1820s by Professor Isaac Jackson, whose home stood alongside North College. His toolshed can still . be found behind North College, ·near the Gardens. Within the Ga1den are twa Ginko trees (the first brought to . America from Japan), remains of a trench dug by · an ROTC unit during the Civil War, and more than 100 species of rare plants, trees, shrubs, and vines. The Universities of Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, as well as Vassar, Smith, and Elmira · Colleges all count Union alumni as their first presidents. Union alumni include a president of the United States at least six cabinet secretaries, 13 United States Senators, 91 members of the House of Representatives, 12 governors; 149 important diplomats, 200 judges, and 86 college presidents. Union's Ctllors--garnet and white-were determined by ·the results of a crewirig race with Harvard. Harvard, which also laid claim to these colors, lost the· race. Its colors are now crimson and white. Until the mid-1950's freshman hazing was an accepted practice at Union.· Freshmen were required to dress up in their pajamas and parade through downtown Schenec- tady. At one time there was a path that led to the center of campus that only seniors were allowed to walk on. The path was located between Lamont House and the Hwnanities building, and was named Senior Path. Union's first president, John Blair Smith, received a salary of $1,100 per year. He also was a close associate of James Madison in carrying through the Federal Constitution·in the Virginia State convention. FitzHugh Ludlow,_ Class of 1656, was the author of the College alma mater and a -...... reknowned author in his day. He was also a heavy drug user and an expert on their effects, types and ingestion. A library in San Francisco devoted to drugs and their harmful consequences is named in his honor. Chester Arthur, Class of 1848, succeeded James A. Garfield as President of the United-States in 1881. His administration saw the passage of a Civil Service · Reform Act and the creation of a new, strong navy in addition to the style and character he brought to the office. He ascended to the presidency upon Garfield's assassination but was not renominated for the office in 1884. . In the Memorial Chapel, a portrait of William Seward (1820) faces that of Robert Toombs (1828) as the men faced one another in 1861, when one, was the Secretary of State in the Federal ·Cabinet and the other held the similar position in the Confederacy. Squire Whipple, Class of 1830, the inventor of the iron truss bridge, whose 1847 publication, \Work on Bridge Building,\ was used as a guide in the construction of bridges span- ning the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi Rivers, truly opened the Western Frontiers for settlement. One of his original iron truss bridges was restored and now spans \the brook that bounds;' behind the rink. , Frank Bailey, Class of 1885, was Union College. Treasurer for 52 years and has been called \Mr. Union College of the Continued on page 6

Page 2 CONCORDIEN818. September 19, 1981 Aid OfficiO Is ·Predict Surprised· Students (CPS)-Mary, about to start her first year of law school at Vanderbilt University in Nash- ville, says she'll have to \take it step by step. I can't make it through three years· without (financial) aid.\ If she can't get enough aid, Mary (not her real name) will .. either drop out of school, or wait to go, or just forget about it.\ Mary's not alone. Like millions of undergraduate and graduate students this fall, she's feeling the first effects of President Reagan's cuts fn federal student aid programs. Financial aid officials aroWid the country seem to agree that while this year's cuts will hurt students, the worst effects are probably a year away. \The full impact of the changes won't start to be felt until next spring and swmner,\ predicts Dallas Martin, executive director of the National Association of Student Financial Aid J\dministrators. Fonner U.S. Secretary of Education Shir.ley Hufstedler confirms they'll \hit in full and evil· flower next year.\ The impact then will be \shat- tering.\ The relative scarcity of federal student aid \will literally foFeclose the op- portunity to go to school\ for some students, Martin says, For others, the cuts \will cause students to·maybe delay enrolling\ while they hold a job, and \will most likely cause a shift in enrolhnent patterns from more expensive private schools to public colleges,\ be adds. Indeed, some are predicting a rapid disappearance of all but the strongest private colleges. To· meet higher tuitions, a greater percentage of private college students uses federal aid money, according to a February, .1981 study by the National Center on Educational Statistics. So \when the axe falls,. it might be the end of many sp1all, private colleges,\ speculates Carol Skribel, aid administrator at private Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. \We depend on strong financial aid to attract students.\ Traditionally black colleges, where it's not unusual to find 100 percent of the student body using some sore of federal aid, are also expected to be hit especially hard by the cuts. Most public college aid of- ficials were reluctant to predict just how many of their students won't be able to re-enroll because of the cuts. One - Jerome Sullivan of Iowa State - at one point speculated ISU could lose 20 percent of its students, but that they could be replaced by transfers from private colleges. \We expect a large number of .students will be affected,\ says George Brooks, aid director at the University of Missouri- Columbia. \We don't know how many yet. We're certainly not going to be able to fund every student who needs it, which has been our commitment since the mid-sixties.\ At Texas, \we don't know how it will translate into the number of students lost to the in- stitution,\ says Michael Novak, the university's aid director. \But the quality of the students' experience will • be affected,\ he predicts. The immediate impact will probably be on the poorest students, officials say. David K. Smith, Vanderbilt's student aid director, worries about \a return to the old days when Vanderbilt was lmown as a rich man's'school.'' He worries the school might eventually be forced to admit students \in the bottom .five percent of our· applicant pool\ according not to their academic abilities, but to their abnity to pay their own way without aid. ''That would be destroying what we've always win·ked for - a diverse student body with a good sprinkling of minority students and lower-income students,\ Smith mourns. Missouri ''hasn't discussed going back to ability-to-pay (admissions) yet,\ Brooks says, \but I can see it coming up, Everything's going down the drain on this thing.\ Confusion over congressional · intent and an administration delay in processing aid ap- plications last spring have caused the most trouble for this fall's students, aid directors say. Most of the changes in aid awar.ds go into effect October 1, but aid administrators didn't know that until well past June, when most aid \packages\ are usually completed and an- nounced. Vanderbilt's Smith complains of trying to arrange aid for students in the face of \con- fusion and conflicting direc- tives'' during the summer. Two weeks before school started, \we still do not have an official notification of a payment schedule\ on which to compute awards. Brooks tried to reach his students well before the new August 23 deadline for Guaranteed Student Loans (GSLs), but doesn't know how successful he was. \A lot of people are going to be awfully surprised when they come back this year, and find they won't be able to get as much money as last year,\ Brooks frets. \You're going to see some terrible anxiety (among students this fall),\ Martin suggests. Many \students just aren't aware of the changes.\ There are other, immediate effects, ''many of them invisible for now,\ Martin says. He recalls talking to a textbook publisher who complained that bookstore managers, unsure of what to expect, are \ordering books conservatively\ until they can more accurately gauge demand. Other obs·ervers foresee temporary lapses in services like campus food operations, whose directors ·may have withheld ordering for the school year-until they saw how many students had to drop out because of an inability to pay. Smith estimates that 175 of the 500 students in Vanderbilt's nursing school ·would have had to drop out if \we hadn't made it up with ·about $100,000 in in- stitutional funds.\ But \I don't know what we're* going to do next year\ if Congress doesn't refund a nursing loan and . other aid programs, Smith says. BOOKS A change of heart is unlikely. Stockm8Jl is content with this year's cuts in (Guaranteed Student Loans) is as loony as David Stockman himself.\ says Jerry . Roschwalk of the National ASs.9-ciation of State Universities · and Land-Grant Most Washingtonians promise even deeper cuts next year. \Anyone whO- believes that / · C()lleges. ~- ________ Founded at Union Coli~ 1877 ___ ~--- SUBSCRIBE TODAY!

Night Life On Campus By BARTON LEVINE The 'Skellar. The Pub. Do these names mean anything much to you right now? Probably not, right? But not to worry, because you must believe me that within the span · of as long as a term or as little as two nights, Union , College will have taught you two new words. The 'Skellar (short for Rathskellar) is an underground beer skellar modelled after the beer skellars in Germany in the early 1900's. Famous for its ''grease'' burgers, popcorn, beer on tap, and rowdy juke box tunes, many a night will disappear into oblivion in.these hallowed halls. known secret is that during the day, this is a pretty quiet place to work. For those who want to sit, talk, mellow out and make a few points with your date by impressing her with your knowledge of Namibian bird calls, this is the place- for you. On Thursday nights, the doors opposite the mailroom open up to the Cabaret room. Two shows ' (9:00 and 11:00) are presented by the students. If you sing, tell jokes, or just look funny, this is your opportunity for fame and fortune {just watch out for the flying peanuts!). The Concert Committee usually puts on two concerts a term (recent ones: James Taylor, Dave Mason, Harry Chapin, Spyro Gyra). The film • • • never, never underestimate ...., '' the .fall term .for a couple o_f blow-out parties.'' The Dutch Hollow Pub (along with Mrs. Marra's office and the maili-oom) is at the heart of - the student center. The Pub opens early for breakfast, and provides inexpensive lunches and- dinner specials. At night (when the boards come down), the Pub is transformed into a mixed drink bar. On weekends, there is often live music. A little Committee puts on flicks on Wednesday nights and weekends (good movies this . term, watch for the schedule!). Keep your eyes open for the 10,000 signs that announce each and every social function on campus and never, never un- derestimate the fall term for a couple of blow-out parties. Garnet History Continued from page 1 Twentieth Century.\ Among his many contributions to Union was the donation of what is now Bailey Hall, endowments of scholarships and grants-in-aid for needy students, establish- ment of three professorships and a half million dollar gift to support teaching in the Elec- trical Engineering and Economics Departments. Baruch S. Blumberg, Class of 1946, was the 1977 Nobel Prize winner in medicine. We hope this article has demonstrated some of the pride the Orientation Committee feels for Union. In closing, here is an excerpt from the 1961 Union College Freshman Handbook: \You'll be' called upon to 'adjust' to the campus society, to 'participate' in its many · phases, to exhibit 'school spirit' . . . But a college is a world of aims and not ends. You will make the greatest contribution to Union through the exercise of your individual personality and intellect. \Union will be our college for as long as we live. Let's hope that we may always have the insight to sit back, reflect, and appreciate what Union has done for us and what we have done for Union. For although Union has many strengths in its own right, its greatest strength is its people, a \Union of People.''

Page 4 OONOORDIENSIS, 8eJJtember 19} 1981 Welc,ome From the Editors • Wake up at 8:00!! Go to dinner now! Reg1ster at these times only! Have fun! Orientation is filled wit:h all kinds of rules and suggestions that are bound to oveiWhelrn the incoming student. Not only are you unsure .about what to do, but the other580 people you .are with have a similar dilemma. Understandably, it can be difficult. There are several ways to ease this potentially traumatic ad- justment. , First, relax and enjoy uie Orientation events. These four days have been carefully designed and planned by the committee to provide you With many opportW1ities to have fun, and get acquainted with life at Union. Second, become involved and interested. The latter point is perhaps more important in the long ·range goals of the Orientation Committee, and the College. The best way to become familiar with the Union College lifestyle and .feel comfortable and at home is to become a part of the activities that make up Union College. The clubs and organizations at Union, as a complement to the academic curriculum, are an excellent way to achieve this goal. Every organization on campus has something to offer the individual, and every individual has something to offer the College. All benefit from this type of involveme-nt. Ooncordiensis typifies such an organization .. This newspaper, Which is 104 years old, has a distinguished history of providing the College with a good, consistent and interesting source of information. We strive for journalistic ex- cellence by reporting noteworthy events, human interest stories, and presenting opposing viewpoints on pertinent topics. The newspaper provides students with an opportunity to develop their creative and journalistic talents. Where else can you express your opinions and know that they will be read by over two thousand people, including alumni across the country and abroad? _.;-- For those interested in the many other aspects of the journalistic world, we have \Qusiness positions where the students can acquire practical experience in dealing with subscribers, advertisers and fiscal matters. For those who are consider:Lrig going on to business school, or pursuing a related career, this is a valuable opportunity to develop your talents, and test your inclinations. In addition, there are other departments of the newspaper that offer the .prospective journalist or budding editor a chance to exercise their influence. The sports, features, arts and culture, and commentary sections are all valid vehicles for the interested student. ConcordieMis is also an excellent place to exercise your social skills. The individuals who work on the newspaper are outgoing and fdend.ly, and are quite willing to teach someone or talk about the \tricks of the trade.\ We attract a wide range of people, from all parts of tne college community. Putting together the paper is a real experience. The benefits of working on the paper are many, but nothing compares to the satisfaction and accomplishment that one feels when the paper is actually in print on Thursday. Everyone reads the paper that you worked. on, sold ad- vertising for, layed out, or wrote an article for. Ooncordiensis is the newspaper of Union College. Being a part of that is very special. Ooncordiensis. is a great way to become a part of the Union College community. Working on a newspaper afford~ you the opportunity to explore your potenti~l and enjoy the production of a quality piece of journalism. _r Of course, working on a newspaper is not for everybody. Given the myriad of student activities offered you 1 we are confident in stating that you will find something to suit your interests and talents. As upperclassmen, we are keenly aware of the academic pressures that are inevitable at a school like Union, but we also know the importance of the phrase \well-rounded individual.\ Resist the temptation to limit your life to classes, homework, food and sleep. Make time for extracurricular activities. None of us have limitless free time, so it is important that you choose carefully the activities that you will be devoting time to. Ask questions and find out about clubs and organizations on campus. Your O.A.'s are importanrand valuable sources of information. Tap their knowledge. Second to academics, extracurricular ac- tivities play a most important role in your college·life. Through activities such as Ooncordiensis, the radio station, student government, sports or ~cholastics; you will find that it will be quite easy to wtderstand the spirit of Orientation and become part of the \Union of People.\ We welcome you to Union College and look foiWard to meeting you in the. future. Paul Grossman '82 Rachel Mandel '82 Editors- in -Chief J(nowledge, in truth, is the great sun the .firmament. L~fe and power are • zn scattered with all its beams. Daniel Webster June 17, 1825 To the freshmen: Early Words Dear New Students, Since 1795 new students have been arriving at Union College with hopes and trepidations. For as long as this has oc- curred, there has been a need forOrientation. The Orientation Committee and all others directly and indirectly involved are here to ease your transition into our college community. With your entrance into Union College you become a part of an elite group-a Union of People. Orientation epitomizes the concept of a Union of People. It all began with seventeen dif- ferent individuals who shared the desire for a successful orientation and who had a strong affinity for Union and a belief in this community. But by no means could these seventeen individuals accomplish alone tlre task of organizing Orien- tation. The college has many resources-all of which were tapped for this important event. We would like to thank all those people· fmm the Pnion College communitY who participated so generously in this· group effort. For the most part our deed is done. Now it is aU up to you. , Enjoy these four days. We hope · you, like us, get caught up in the spirit of a Union of People. To the Transfers: Good luck, KeHy and Brian It Much to Add As transfer students you may be wondering why you need a second Orientation. The truth is that you don't need to be orientated to college life but you do need to learn about Union College. We, as members of the . Transfer Sub-Committee, have been working since last spring to provide a program for you that Will do just that. We realize that you. have different needs from the incoming freshmen. Therefore, we have geared our program toward these needs. Your attendance at as many activities as p_ossible will not only help you le~;~.rn about Union but also make you. feel a part of Union right from the beginning. There is something unique about every college. After you have been here for a while you will realize what Union has to offer. You will also realize what you have to offer Union. You are, in a sense, .starting fresh again. However, your ex- periences at other .schools in the past should not be forgotten. Orientation gives you the · chance to. share these ex- periences with others who are in a similar situation and can understand their significance. It is for these reasons that we stress your participation in your Orient~tion prograrri. We hope that you feel as much en- thusiasm for this Orientation as we felt in planning it. Orien- tation only occurs once at Union. Make the most of it. Enjoy! Matt Cohen, Julie Isgro, & Jeff Steinberg A Warm Helllo I would like to say a few words about the nature of an 6'rientation program. The beginning of a college career can be _,. an exciting and stimulating time. However, it can also be terrifying. ''Where do I go now?\ \What am I supposed to do, next.?\ \Are my roomates really going to like me?\ \Where's the library?\ \Where's the laundry room ... the labs?\ \Who are those people with the name tags?\ \What do I do about my cour~ ses?\ It may seem overwhelmingly _confusing but out of this mayhem we call Orientation _ there is some sense of order and purpose. The people with the Editors-in-Chief Managing Editor Staff name tags are Orientation Advisors ·and Orientation Committee Members. They'll answer· nearly all of your questions. The overstuffed packet and schedule will tell you where to be and when to be there. The whole idea of the Orientation program is to provide a smooth transitionary period from the \real world\ to the Union College way of life. We hope 1 the transition goes well and that your adjustment to Union is rewarding and problem free. Welcome- to Union College. Mike Andolina Assistant Dean of Students Paul Grossman, Rachel!.

OONOORDIENSIS, Septeml'Jer 19, 1981 Page 5 Union Fall Rush Begins By JEFF STEINBERG Wednesday, September 23, is not only the first day ·of classes but also the first _ day of the formal 'rush' period. Rush has been a traElition at Union (\the Mother of 'Fraternities\) since . the first fraternities in the country were formed here in 1825. Kappa Alpha (f. 1825), Delta Phi (1825 )-, and Sigma Phi (1827) constitute the \Union Triad\. Currently Union has sixteen fraternities as well as thref;l sororities. With so many houses for a student body of approximately two thousand, Fraternities and Sororities unavoidably play a major role in the sociallife·on this campus. In the next few weeks most of the men and · many of the women in the Class· of ·s~ will receive dinner in- vitations, party invitations, as weH as personal visits from various \Greek\ up- perclassmen. The individual houses are connected by the Interfraternity Coundil (IFC). for the men, and the Pan- Hellenic Collflcil (PHC) for the women_. Approximately 30 percent of all students here are fraternity or sorority initiates. The percentage of men involved is actually much higher (about 50 percent). What happens durin·g rush?

OONOORD1ENS18J September 19J 1981 Page6 The Turf is Greener • • • In recent years, Union has taken giant steps towards modernizing its athletic facilities, notably the. resur- facing of Garis Field with gtass, and the construction of a multi- purpose artificial turf field next to Achilles Rink. The need for an all-weather field was realized way back in the early 1970's. It was at this point that Union began to admit women, and consequently, enrollment began to increase quite sub- stantially in a very short time. With the addition of several varsity sports for women, Union rapidly outgrew its already obsolete athletic facilities. At this point, a seed was planted for the construction of a new artificial turf field which would ease the competition between intercollegiate and 1 intramural • sports for available field time. The construction of the field was begl,lll in November of 1980, at the conclusion of the football season. The overall cost estimates, according to John Hauser, Vice President of Finance, ran ~lightly over $1 million, with 90 percent of the funds coming from the Bailey Endowment Fund for Union College, and the remaining 10 percent being drawn from unrestricted college resources. The artificial surface promises to be an excellent long range investment, having several advantages over natural turf. These include very little maintenance, all weather use, and flexibility for many uses including intramurals. Athletic Director Dick Sakala estimates ~maintenance costs to be ex- the difference is . • • the difference is • . . what we carry the difference is . . . excitina aifta the difl'er.ence il . . . distinctive stationery ud cardt the difference il . . . your kiad of clothes IIIUWCblrp•visa comer liberty and aouth ferry at. 382-7600 tremely low, with the field needing only to be washed down with high pressure water and vacuumed once or twice a year. Intramurals had been figures heavily into the project from the beginning. Union's available intramural facilities had to be considered sub-par at best until the addition of the new field. Sakala stated that intramural contests are already booked on the field until midnight, six nights per week, starting in the second week of school. The new field is clearly an asset to Union's expanding intercollegiate sports program. In addition to that, says Hauser, \The uses of the field are almost limitlesss.\ Already outside events, such as the State High School Soccer Cham- pionships are booked here, with other dates being considered, providing that they do not conflict with Union's schedule. The new field has to give us a feeling of pride. Union's con- temporaries in the academic world, like Williams and Amherst will be hard put to match the out~anding athletic facilities which we now have available to us. Let's all take advantage of our new resour- ces.

The intramural program offers a wide variety of team and individual ac- tivities for both men and women. Whether your interests be football or foosball, ice hockey or backgammon, the intramural program has something for you_ The fine athletic facilities to be found in the Memorial Field House, Achilles Rink, and Alumni Gym, not to mention the new athletic field, afford the Union College community ample opportunity to participate in all kinds of intramural activities. These activities are fun and, with the added incentive of t· shirts ahd trophies to be awarded to intramural champions, there is reason enough to get involved. A complete schedule of events can be found in the Intramural, Recreation ·and Physical Education Handbook or the Intramurals Activity Calendar. However, here is a sample of what •s <:oming up this Sep- tember: for men and women separately and C(}rec teams, there's flag football, entries due Sept. 2a, and mini soccer, en- tries due Sept. 28.

Don McLean, who once again regained popularity with his smash single ''Crying•• last summer, has always been popular with Union students as \American Pie\ is often heard · on the Rathskellar jukebox. It was the album American Pie -WE DELIVER- 374-1888 with which Don McLean said his farewell to rock and moved to folk music. His songs are delivered with such conviction that the emotion comes through ·without being overbearing. His triumph, \American Pie,\ is by c itself a ~reat song, but then one thinks about bow the music died and the significance of Buddy Holly's death. According to Pete .Seeger, whom McLean follo-ws stylistically, McLean is \a 'n()rmal, t~lented, un- pretentious, nervous, relaxed musician trying to use his songs to help people survive iri these perilous times.\ Don McLean will be preceded by a per· formaa-<le by Livingston Taylor. Livin~ston, who has spent much ()f his professional career in the shadow of his brother James,. performs his own songs in a very laid-back, mellow style. On this leg of his tour, Livingston is being backed up by a b~nd which contains ex- members of the Pousette-Dart Band. This should prove to bring a lively~ funky sound to Taylor\s music.
