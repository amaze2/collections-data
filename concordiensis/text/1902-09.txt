-· ' . '; THE CO.NCORDIENSIS ! VoL. XXVI. UNION C()LLEGE, SEPTEMBER 24, 1902. No.1. COLLEGE YEAR BEG1NS. Im:pressive Ceremoni~es are: Held tn the Chapel. The formal opening of U niori college oc- curred Thursday morning when the first chapel exercises were· conducted, PresideJ.ilt A. V. V. Raymond presiding, assisted by Dean Benja- n~in H. Ripton. T'here was a large number of students present, the incotning 'Class being especially strong. The seniors occupied their custo1n.ary places at· the left of the chapel, the juniors on the lower left hand side, the sophomcres the mid- dle and the fresbtnen the right hand side. A nutnber of members of the faculty vvere seat- ed in the front part of the room. A few of the younger alu1nni were also in attendance. The services began with the singing of a hymn, followed by the reading of the scrip- tures and prayer by President Raynond, after which he addressed the students, givi!lg them a cordial welcome and extending best wishes for a prosperous year to all. Dr. Raymond in his remarks alluded to the delightful times which the stude11t body was passing through, trusting that the affairs which were now absorbing the attention of the under- graduates would give way to weigh tier n1atters. '' Sooner or later;\ he said \you will find that there is something more in life th.an a col- lege career before you and you nust train yourself to meet this future. \ Strive after intelligence,\ he continued. \This is what the college tries to give and if you are men you will make your work serious, but if you are boys you will a1noun t to nothing more than good fellovvs. Together with in- seek ability to concentrate energy some task until that task is accotnplished, for it is the men that apply themselves to their work, that accomplish things in the world.\ ''The most i1n portant of all is that you have character, a devotion to right.. Let nothing lead you to sacrifice your integrity. Have the power to do right at all times and under. all circurnstances. The great problems of the age cannot be solved without intelli- gence, concentration and integrity, so that it devolves upon you as young men soon to enter the strife of the world to reach after these requisites. If, after all, you should fail; lay not the blam.e upon the college, but upon yourself.\ 1906. The enten.n.g class this year is one of the largest in several years and shows promise of being a very good one. It gives us pleasure ~ to print the names of about seventy who have registered.

A. to the freshman class was held Friday night in Silliman hall. Nearly all of the freshman class and most of the other students, the faculty and clergymen of the city were present. After giving the men an opportunity to meet each other and chat, short talks were given on topics of interest to undergraduates. President Raymond opened with an address of welcome. The next speaker was Coach Whitney, who talked of the football prospects and urged eve~·y man who had football ability to try for the team. Captain Gulnac talked next and after laying emphasis on the remarks of Coach Whitney, spoke of the efficiency of the coach and the necessity of his receiving the support of the college. The men present, led by the Glee club, sang some college songs and then President Pearce of the Y. M. C. A., introduced Manager Don- nan of the baseball team, Editor-in-Chief Howe of the Concordiensis, Manager Peck of the musical association, who spoke in regard to the portion of the college activities which they represent. R. C. Donnan talked of the work of the Y. M. C. A. and urged the students to sup- port it. The Rev. Nr Zelie of the First Reformed church spoke to the college students in behalf of the churches of the city, alluding to the importance of the college man in church work and the necessity of him using his influence for good.

THE CONCORDIEN.SIS. .'1 FRESHMXN REFUSE: TO PAINT IDOL. So-phs Get Worsted. in the First Scra:p. The freshman and sophomore :classes of the ·college had their first fight on the campus Fri- day morning and the result was a victory for the freshmen. It was such a decided victory that even the sophs admitted that they had the small end .. 'fhursday night some freshmen put a coat of red paint on the idol, and as it is the business of the so phs to 1nake the frosh keep it paint- ed green, they forthwith \ pinched\ three freshmen to repaint it. There were about a score of so phs and as they were taking their men across the campus toward the idol, the freshmen classes in French and geotnetry were excused. This was very unfortunate for 1905, for the whole bunch of frosh charged them, liberated their captives, and in about three minutes two or more frosh were very comfortably seated on each of the sophs. This was very easy until another crowd of sophs came along looking for trouble and they got what they were looking for in scripture measure. The frosh who were occupied with the other sophs got into the newcomers and pretty soon the members of both classes '\Vere helping get the wet grass dry soaking the water up in their clothes. It was evident that the sophomores were up against it, though, for they were outnutn- bered and .(}utweighed. It must be said though that the S()phomores, in spite of the odds against them, fought with the valor born of desperation, and never stopped till they had some big frosh seated on them. The freshmen were handicapped because they did not know each other nor could they tell t~e sophs from the ft·osh. Indeed, several times two freshmen were found very indus- triously scrapping and it took a lot of persua- tiQn t9 seJ?arate the1n. The sophs that were walked on the most were the men who have been the most promin- ent in the hazing. Every frosh had his eyes on them, and also the rest of anatomy most of the time. Aftel\ about 15 or 20 minutes of scrap, the upper classmen out of pity for 1905 and to keep that class from being exterminated, pul- led the frosh off and made them go home, leaving the disgruntled sophs to get their breaths and ·to talk mournful] y of how they had each been overpowered by at least five freshmen. REMODELLING OF SOUTH COL.LEGE. Owing to the financial support of the alumni given to the college, our dormitories in South College have been so renovated that we may now feel that old Union possesses as fine a building of dormitories as any other college of its size in the country. The old hall floors, which had stood the test of time for many, many years, have been replaced by concrete ones : the old inner walls have been so reno- vated that they now have an entirely new coat of plaster : the inconvenience of stoves in each room has been overcome by steam heat, and oil lamps as necessary lights are things of the past. Each suite of rooms has hard wood floors, and a bath has been placed on each floor. The traces of long ago have however, to a certain extent, not been removed, and upon looking around at the wood work, we cannot but be reminded by initials, numera·~ and Greek letters, of those who have left the college decades ago. From outside appear- ances South College looks as it did when Dr. N ott was our president, and no one can fully appreciate the change which has taken place unless he himself sees it. Honesty, truthfulness and industry are prime factors in the success of life. Ivie ll w4o po~s~s§ tQ~§~ are always in dePl~n<l,

' . 8 THE CONOORDIENSIS. ~·------~----------------~----------~------~~~----~----~------------- MUSICAL. ASSOCIATION. The Glee Club was organized Wednesday afternoon in the chapel. For a short time the chorus will be carried along to enable Mr. Stremple to become better acquainted with the voices. The names of the successful candi- dates for the Glee Club chorus will be pub- lished next week. ~\he Mandohn Club will be organized next week. Mr. McClure of Albany will be present to try the merits of all candidates. A meeting of the Mandolin Club will he held for the pur- pose of electing a leader for the year. An attempt wil1 be made to organize an orchestra. It seems very probable that there is sufficient material for such a club. All who play are requested to hand their names to the management at their earliest convenience. Manager Peck is at work on the fall itiner- ary of the clubs and a good trip is anticipated. In the spring the New York trip will occur. All candidates for the clubs are reminded that a deposit of $s.oo tnust be left with the man- ager. This is to cover and insure against all unexcused absences fron1 rehearsals and con- certs and was adopted by unanimous vote by the musical association. ELECTION OF' EDITORIAL BOARD Owing to the resignation of W. E. Kreusi, 'o3, from the position of Editor-in-Chief of the Concordiensis, for the ensuing college year, a special election was held at I 1-30, Wednes- day, September 17, in Silliman Hall. The board of editors elected at this tneet- ing is constituted as follows: Samuel B. Howe, Jr., 1903, editor-in-chief ; Arthur E. Bishop, 1903, business manager ; J. G. Fen- ster, 1903, literary editor ; A. S. Peck, 1903, news editor ; Raymond C. Donnan, 1903, athletic editor ; W. E. Hays, medical, 1905, medical dept.; B. H. Mills, law, 1903, law department. The associate editors and reportel~s are the same as elected in May. DEATH OF PROF. OPDYKE'S MOTHER. Word has been received of the death of 1virs Henry V. Opdyke, a beautiful woman of great nobility of character and the mother of Prof. Opdyke. l\1rs Opdyke died in Frutigen; Switzerland, on the 3 rst of August. This will not affect the plans of Prof. Opdyke, who is stu dying at Zuruck. VESPER SERVICE. President Raymond preached in the college chapel on Sunday morning and gave a n1ost interesting talk at the Vesper Service in Silli- ,man Hall in the afternoon. At this service he based his remarks upon the story in Genesis of the visit of Abraham's servant to the house of Bethuel and his refusal to partake of the feast spread before him until he had told his. errand, thus putting his master before himselt: his duty before his pleasure. After speaking of a sense of responsibility as the clearest evidence of manly worth bring- ing everyone who has it into fellowship with hiln who said \Wist ye not that I tnust be about my Falher sbusiness'' '·and I tnust work the works of Him that sent me,\ President Raymond made a direct and practical applica- tion of his subject to college life. Every man con1es to college with a definite obliga- tion to be fulfilled-his own developn1ent in those things which will gi-ve hin1 power in the world and the ever-recurring question of college days is '' Wh~~~~shallcome :first,. his duty or his pleasure ?\ Before 'him are spread all the enjoyments peculiar to the college world, for the most part innocent and right in thetnselves and appealing not only to his desire but to his need. It is not difficult to persuade himse1f of his right to these. Nevertheless he n1ust choose each day whether or not he will tell his errand before he eats, whether or not he will put the serious work of college before its pleasures, and that choice is th~ one cleter- minin~ fq~tor in hi? life, 1'h~ right choi~~- does no1 No stuc college higher 1 :spectre it-no tl hours oJ The p to meml tions. be a paJ hitnself pleasure to fail it A fina ment o: every o must co ate.

THE CONOORDIENSIS. 9 does not mean that he turns from pleasure. No student gets so much enjoyntent out of college as one who has first been true to his higher mission as a student. 'There is no :spectre sitting at the feast when he comes to it-· no thought of neglect to rob his leisure hours of their best returns. The principle of responsibility was applied to membership in the various college organiza- tions. IVIetnbership in these organizations may be a part of the duty which a n~an owes to hitnself and to his l\1aster, but to enter for his pleasures only, with no sense of obligation, is to fail in his trust. A final application ·was made to the develop- ment of the spiritual life, the duty which every one owes to his higher nature. This must cotne first if men are not to be degener- ate. A standard once lowered is not easily raised. The worship on1itted to-day becomes difficult to-morrow. Neglect becon1es a habit, till the best that life has to offer is lost. CHAPEL. MEETING. The first chapel meeting of the college year was held on 1\'Ionday morning. Mr. A. S. Peck presided. 1\IIr. Hart, 'o 5, was elected secretary pro tetn. G. vV. Parker, 'o3, was elected to the office of secretary of the Athletic Board. Mr. Bolles offered the motion that a campus tax of $ro be levied on the student body, ~~5 payable imn1ediately, and the balance in in- stallnH~nts of $3 and $2 at the beginning of the ·winter and spring terms respectively. Carried, Manager Peck of the musical association announced that competition for the position of ass is tan t manager is open to members of 'o4. Mr. Pearce announced that the position of 1nanager of the track teatn must be filled owing to the resignation of Mr. Pritchard. Mr. Howe gave notice of the Glee Club trials. Captain Gulnac spoke on ,loyalty to the football team. Manager Gou:l d of the football asso.eiation announced that candidates for the office of assistant manager of that association should report to hin1 irnmediately. 1\he class co Hectors made their reports. Seniors $8o, Juniors $4o.5o, Sophomores $so, Freshmen $7r. START RIGHT. Patronize O·ur Advertisers. Many business r.nen of Albany, Schenectady and other neighboring cities have for years contributed large sums of money to college enterprises by advertising in the college pub- lications. It is right, and necessary to future success of the papers, that the students should give their trade to those who are so courteous to the college. 1~his method of returning favors has not always been employed by the students, but in the future let it not be pos- sible for prominent n1erchants to accuse the students at Union of neglect in this respect.

'The new Board of Editors feels heavily its responsi. bility. The paper will be conducted along the lines laid down in the issue of May 28th, 1902. Attention will be given to all departments of the University and to all branches of college activity. The literary side will be made more prominent under the new literary editor. For Mr. W. E. Kreusi, the retiring editor-in-chief, we wish the highest success in his future college labors. In the short time in which he has had charge of the CONCOR· DIENSIS he has set us ~ high example and is to be con· . gratulaled upon the results of his efforts. From the alumni of Union University we bespeak support in the form of subscriptions and also of frequent contributions. No college enterprise can be successfully carried on by the sole efforts of a few men, the manage· ment. Every student in Union should take· an active interest in the official publication of the student body. Now, what is meant by an \active interest?'' As we understrnd the expression, it means that every man in college should pay his subscription of $2.00 for the present year to Mr. Bishop, within a reasonable time. It means that the news department be kept busy with items of interest handed in by the men; news of our :alumni is always of interest,, the records of class meetings. college talk, college happenings, all these should appear in this publication. Original short stories, verses, essays, etc., are earnestly solicited. I906 The class of rgo6 gives evidence of hav- ing abundant material for athlectics and for the musical association, and its attention is called to the fact that each member owes Mr. Bishop $2.oo, ''payable invariably in advance.'' This trifle satisfactorily adjusted' their attention is called to page 17 of the \Freshman's :Bible,\ where they will find the following paragraph: '' The editors of the Concordiensis are chosen aanually by the Advisory Board, which consists of .on~ member of the faculty and the editors of the preceding year. Com.:. petition for positions on the staff of this paper is open to all students. Registration for competition closes on December first of each year. From the Ft·eshman con- testants five men are chosen on the basis of work per· formed to serve as reporters during the Sophomore year.\ Then by a process of elimination the Junior and Senior boards are successively chosen. Those freshmen who desire to compete should register at once with the editor- in-chief, Notice is called to the rule passed at a recent meeting of the :Board.

THE CON·CORDIENSIS. 11 COACH WHITNEY. Through .the efforts of the Alumni Coach Committee Mr. Geo. S. Whitney of Cornell has been engaged to coach the footbaU team for the coming season. Mr. Whitney has a splendid reputation in the footbaH world. He was Cornell's star tackle in his under-graduate days and has since served as athletic director and coach for the U n'iversi ty of Texas. Union is very fortunate in securing a. man of such marked ability and experience, and whose record as a player is such a brilliant one. It remains now for the student body to turn out a lot of material, and to support every effort of our coach to build up a winning tea1-n. In short, we owe it to our. alumni to show them that we appreciate their loyalty and generos- ity in furnishin&\ us with the services of a coach, and one of such recognized efficiency. The Concordiensis takes pleasure in pre- senting to its readers some of the refer- ences of our coach. They are as follows. \To Whom It May Concern : ''It is with a degree of confidence resulting from five years experience in college and university athletics, that I assume)he responsibility of recommendi11.g to an institution any man for the position of foot ball coach. If I am qualified by reason of having played on a university team for three years and coached a university foot ball team two years, to recommend any man as competent for the latter position , then I will say that it is with the utmost confi- dence that 1 recommend George S. vVhitney,of Cornell, as such. Heretofore I have been associated with Mr Whit- ney on the gridiron, and since that time have with much gratification followed his record as a player, and will say that in my opinion Mr Whitney would be an efficent man for a position as coach in college or university. \DANIEL A. R:EED, '' Head Coach at Cornell. \ ''MR. A. L. BANKS, Texas. Dear Sir: '' I have your letter of July I2 inquiring about Mr. vVhitney. He has played foot ball at Cornell for the last four years, being on the regular team the last three years. He is a very conscientious, hard worker and knows the game thoroughly. He is also a fellow of good habits and does not use intoxicants nor tobacco. I was coach at Cor- nell one year when he was playing and my brother is cap- tain at Cornell now ; so that I am well acquanted with Mr. Whitney, and believe he would make you a valuable coach. I think you will make no mistake if you secure his services. \Very truly yours, ''GLENN 8. WARNER, ''Ath'letic Director, Indian School.'' '' I take great pleasure in recommending George S. vVhitney to anyone in need of a first-class coach for all around athletics, viz. : track, base ball, crew, and foot ball. As a trainer for aU Cornell athletic teams , I had many opportunities duringtne past two years of observing Whitney's work in each of the above branches and always found him a reliable and painstaking athlete ; and no mat- ter how proficient he became in any one branch he was continually striving to improve, A man of this stamp will always prove invaluable to any college on other association which strives to advance its athletic interests ; for he is in .love with his work and it takes a great deal to satisfy him. He is a splendid speci- men of an athlete, possessing one of the most symmetrical physiques'IJhave met with in. my experience of twenty years in athletics. '' My Dear Whitney ; \ Yours truly, \JoHN F. ThfoAKLEY. '' Trainer at Cornell \ It gives me great pleasure, in replying to your re- cent !etter, to certify to your ability as an athlete and especially to your success as a foot ball player. Your ear- nestness and natural aptitude in athletic sports, that was so prominently seen in your connection with the Cornell team, pron~ises well for your success in such lines in the future, and I sincerely trust that this success may be yours. '''rVith kindest regards '' Yours very sincerely, '' L. l\1. DENNIS, \Prof. of Chemistry and l\1ember of Foot Ball Rules Com. \ vVith such a coach at the head of Union's athletics the outlook in football can be nothing but hopeful. And probably no coach at Union in recent years, with a new team to create, has had n1aterial at hand of so super- ior a quality. The men are new, but there are lots of them and they are willing to work. There have been no interruptions in pr.actice this year such as last year hampered Coach Smith's work at the beginning of the season. Active out-door work began on Monday the 15th, consisting of ,catching punts, falling on the ball, etc, Before the end of the week Mr

12 'rHE OONCORDIENSIS. vVhitney had the rnen lined U;p in two teams, and rapidly learning defensive tactics as well as breaking through the line. The students miss many familiar forms in the line-up,. but two or thr,ee of the old Var- sity players are out every day. Captain Gul- nac is still found at right half. He has put on weight during the stunmer and fills his position better than ever bef()re. He is a fit man to control the interests of any team. Oln1sted 'o4 will undoubtedly be another star on this year's eleven. Those who have seen him play in the past have no fears as to the right end of the line. Probably nothing in connection with the \velfare of the team has exceeded the satisfac- tion that the older students have felt at the announce1nent that Griswold, 'o 3, has returned to his place at old Union. H,e will be a tower of strength to the tean1 wherever he plays and add a feeling of security to those who \Vatch the eleven get ready for its first gan1e. Bolles is another likely candidate for the line and will probably play as he did in. the fall of 1899. Patton and E. IZing, 'os, who won their foot- ball U's last season are again~ being tried back of the line. Mulvaney will prove a valuable full-back and Staeber, 'o3, is out again at end. As to where the new 1nen -vvill fill in it is too early to predict. The first -week's practice has found Varsity and scrub men as yet undi- vided. \Vhere Coach 'Vhitney intends to play the new men will probably con1e out before the gan1e with Fordham next Saturday. Our next issue will give the approxilnate line-up of the two teams. Coach VVhitney means business and had the men out twice on Saturday. His guarantee of in1partial treatn1ent should bring out the forty men for which he asks. No team can be built up without good practice; and that means about twenty-five men on the scrub. Let every man who expects to try for his class team. feel it his duty to come out and play on the scrub. He will then be doing no more than his obligation calls for. The schedule of gaines for the season of 1902, as arranged by Manager Gould, follows: Sept. 2 7-F ordham College on Can.1pus. Oct. 4-Cornell University at Ithaca. Oct. I r-Amherst College at Amherst. Oct. r 8-Rochester University on Campus. Oct. 2 5-Stevens Technology on Campus. Nov. 1-Lehigh University on Campus. Nov. 4-Laureate I3oat Club on Campus.· Nov. 8--\Vest Point at vVest Point.

The college year has opened for Y. M. C. A. with the brightest outlook the association has ever witnessed. This is due in a large measure to the size of the incoming class, an unusually large number of which have already joined. Twenty-seven n1en out of the class are already members, and there will probably be more later. So many Freshmen have desire d 1 to join the beginning Bible Class,. that it will be necessary to divide the class into two sections. Coal, 'o4, will have charge of this class. It not due to the Freshman class alone, however, that the association is more pros- perous. More interest and work is preva- lent an1ong the fellows in the other classes than had been heretofore. I\1uch of the as- sociation's prosperity is due to Dr. Silliman, '46, through his gift of Silliman I-Iall, which has now been the ho1ne of Y. IV[. C. 1\. over a year. The object for which the building vvas intended, namely, a place where the fel- lows might congregate outside of recitations, sectns to be more fully appreciated, and es- pecially during these opening days ·has the building been of great utility. It is to be hoped that this will continue throughout the year, and that all will feel that the association gives them a hearty welcome to its home, with the co-operation of the student body, the efficieJ most to m C.

Even to a casual observer, there is In uch about the college ca1npus to justify the name Old Union, which is such a fatn:iliar designa- tion of the institution. But more and more as we delve in~o the past of our college are we ilnpressed with the extent and glory of its his- tory. Few facts bring this point more for- cibly to our notice than. an exa~nination into the records of our two literary societies. rrhe Philomathean Society was founded in r 793 and the Adelphic Society in I 795· Surely these two organizations in point of age should satisfy the n1ost fastidious. For over a century, the necessary rivalry between these two societies has furnished training for some of the foremost me11. of the . nation. The fact that legislators and la\vyers of high renown have traced their fluency and power as public speakers and debaters to the two literary societies of Union College should at least stilnulate every college man-old or new-to a thoughtful consideration to the claims and opportunities of this branch of col- lege life. He is a wise man that profits by the life and example of those who have gone before hin1. Yet this is not all. A part from the exe atnple of others, there are splendid reasons why every 1nan should at once identify him- self with one or another of these organiza- tions. First of all, the very fact that a man enters upon this work voluntarily-that it is not something required for his degre.e-gives this branch a strong clailn to support. The prin- ciple of original research is becoming more and n1ore recognized and helped on in the col- leges of the country by the extension of the elective systen1. And while Union's electives are more limited than those of so1ne oth~r in- stitutions, there is in the work of the Philo- mathean and Adelphic Societies a :field for en- deavor as original, earnest and thorough as you piease. rfhat is a general advantage offered by the literary societies; but there are also specific ones. Among others, there is excellent train· ing in public speaking and debate. In this day, when the duties of ahnost every public office call for at least a fair ability to present a subject clearly and forcibly fron1 a platfonn, in this day of almost numberless organizations of more or less public character, the value- the necessity-of gaining sorne knowledge of public speaking is all but self-evident. No one o:f us, ·with any shovv- of certainty, can assert that his life work will Bot demand just such practice. During the struggle prelilninary to the \Var of the Revolution, a certain Englishman ac- counted for the seeming in1possibility of get- ting ahead of the colonists by declaring that nearly every n1an of then1 was a lawyer. \iVhether those san1e men vvould now come within the catalogue of lawyers or not, it is certain that there was an1ong the early colon- ists a \VOnderful knowledge of public affairs. Their field of thought on subjects that con- cerned them in a political way was li1nited to their own relations with the mother country. But in this day of progress and expansion the interests of these United States are world- wide ; and in so far as possible the interests of each .citizen should be as broad as the lla- tion's. It is the aim of the literary societies, by the use of live, up-to-elate subjects for de- bate, to keep the 1nen1bers abreast of the times, to give then1 a wide outloo1{ into all that should concern a wide-avvake citizen. Another advantage which must not be lost sight of, is training in clear, logical thinking. Debate does not consist in the n1ere joining of sentences, but in a process of thinking things out to their source and of putting reasons in their proper order. This faculty is gained in the more or les~ severe school of experience,

14 THE CONOORDIENSIS. Training in criticising is an important item in the benefits offered by the literary societies. By \'criticising we do not m'ean a pi~king to pieces with no end in view, but rather a sin- cere desire to find faults where they exist with a view to their correction and avoidance. Such training is necessary if we are to profit by the mistakes of others. So far we have considered 'vhat the literary societies can do for you. Now, what can you do for the literary societies ? The answer might be briefly co1nprehended in the words, \Support them.'' But to be more explicit : First, join one of them ; second, attend the meetings faithfully ; third, enter heartily into the spkit of the progratn ; fourth, don't kick when you are asked to debate, but show up and do your best ; fifth, when it comes time to elect 111embers of your debating team for the inter-society debate, vote for the men who, in your op1n1on, will do the best work for your society. There is one other consideration which should bring the work of the literary societies up to the top-notch of importance this year. Last April, Union sent a debating team to New· Brunswick, N. J., to take part in a de- bate with Rutgers. The men who represented Union were S. B. Howe, Jr., '03.; J. A. Bolles, 'o3; L. T. Ijunt, 'o3; apd W. H. Ada1ns, 'o2, alternate. Union lost the debate; in view of the fact . that this was our first experience in intercollegiate debating, there is every reason for encouragement. So1netime during the college year, Rutgers will send a team to meet us here on our ,own ground. Let the work of the debating societies be earnest and vigorous throughout the year, and let the competition for p~laces on the team be Hvely. PERSONALS. President A. V. V.
