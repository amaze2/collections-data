The Proposed Leagu,e It would be a collo·sal task Ito put the damper on the huge. investments made by the larger American universities at this. late date, but bhe suggestion of the :f(>l'mation of leagues among the smaller colleges -with purely amateur athleltics as the basis, sounds to us like one \'hich can iiD tilr)e root out collegiate pro-. f~ssionalism. ~resident Day proposes te insrtitute the plan in this section of the C[e)i:mtry wilth a league composed of Hamilton,' R. P. I., Amherst, Williams, Wesleyan, and Union. Organizing such a league will not be as easy as it sounds, but from ·Oilr ex- perience with Dr. Day we have found that when he starts some- thing he finishes it. The results are ·going to be inlteresting and it is up to Union College to get heh'i1.1d \prexy\ and k_,ep tlris thing moving. * * * * StartVn..g a New Year Right. The basketball team started the year in athletics fo1' Union in the pTOper man11er Wednesday by taking Albany Law in't.o camp. It is to be hoped that this was a sign for a great year in sports for the Ga1net. With three teams opening their sea-· sons tomorrow, tJhel'e will be plenty of action seen on lthe c·ampus for the next few months. The baskethall, swimming, hockey, and hash basketball teams have difficult \schedules ahead of them and they will need all ·of the skill acquired during their :practice sessions to show a nraj ority of victories alt the end of the season. Here's hoping. Medals for Lacrosse' Team. We hear that om· undefeated lacmsse team is to 1·eceive another reward for being I'anked in first place in tbe intercol- legiate ra·tings. The team will reccjve gold medals fr.om the Uni·ted States ln!tercollegiate LaCl'osse Association. These medals ar·e given ea.ch year to the tea:m which rates fil'st in la.crosse. This year the Navy was tied with Union for}irst plac-e and as a result both teams will 1~eceiV'e thirteen m.edaJs ea,ch. Union had fifteen leltber men in lacrqsse last season and since most of the men put i:n about an equal amount of playing time. it was pl'obably ra.the-1' difficult to .clwose the thitteen to whom medals were raward.ed, We certainly wouldn't have 'vanted !the job. It certainly wo11ld seem that the other two men should be given some suitable reward for their efforts just as the thirteen did. Perhaps the national association would give the college permission to have tw•o more medals made if the college would pay fol' tl1ein or i:f not ·that, the hvo me:or not getti~g medals might be given gold lacrosse ·sticks ol' some .other suitable awa1·d.

One of his latest accomplishments· was the design of the recently com-· pleted Detmit Windsor bridge whkh is today the longest suspen- sion bridge in the world. Discusses Bridges In last night's lecture Mr. Fowl- · er discassed the various types and designs of bridges with the aid of slides. He mentioned the earliest. types of arch bridges, constructed of tnud brickes and built by the Babylonians. Stone slabs and fell- ed trees also served as b-ridges in the early days. The .Gothic arched· bridge was firs-t brought out in • Persia, according to Mr. Fowler, T.he bridges built by the Romans vter~ of a solid massive ·type as exemplified by the acqueducts still in existence. ln i9I9 Mr. Fowler rebuilt the Niagax:a bridge. By jacking the center of the bridge apart and re- placing a shim by one of different .size the strength of the structure was increased sixty percent. In the White Pass railway bridge in. Robert B.

'~----~------~--~----' playing floor and the wrestling room are mot crowded, it means that not enough students are getting exercise, for work outside· is obviously impossible. But l)lore often, when the gym is far too crowded, studencts are unable to have sufficient facilities for; exercise. One basketball court, one wrestlimg mat, one golf net, one swimming pool, a shott running track, and a few miscella.n-, <!OUS paralell bars are all that Union can offer students for work indoors. No O'll'e appdeciates the lack of facilities better than the college administration and progress has b-ten made in in- creasing them, but there is still a long way to go. A larger gyn1 would help, but tliat of course costs money. A Little Less Critici.~m. Everylthing about the basketball team has been cdticized-He schedule, the material, and the attenda;nce at games. Fortun- ately for Coach Hardman, basketball is not one of those sports where it is the thing to do to e1-iticize the coach no ma!tter what he does. The schedule •has been called unstimulating 'and in(;xcus~ abLe for this college. The attendance has been criticized .as piti~ fully small. The last criticism is pTohably th:e best founded. This year ilt is customary to see one side of the gymnasium al~ most entirely vacant at every game. Anything else would be a surprise, but a pleasant one. If more students would boH1er themselves to see a real game of bas:ketball as played on the Union court, there would be more cause for criticism of oltl1er aspects of the spo1·t. · Until then, how-ever, the1~e should be no. complaint. The Swi1nme1·s Meet R. P. I. It is very dish.eartening for any team to open its season with. such ultber defeats as did the swimming team las·t week-end on its eastern ;trip. Nevertheless there is <no reason for discouragement. Union has a wealth of material on the squad, ~rund a captain whose record last y~car was extremely cxeditable. Tomormw we meet R. P. I. in the final meet before exams. This time we are not going on an arduous bus !trip to colleges beyond our calibre and of a mettle wh.ich Union has never tried before. We are in our own pool, meeting an aggregation from a school very familiar to us. A victm~y for the Garne-t wouid not be sm·p:~.·ising unless the swimmers think themselves licked. They shouldn't. Union's New Hockey Rink. When a child gets a new toy and then is unable Ito use it, we commonly feel vHy sorry for it and offer our .sympathy. Now when a gtoup of sport enthus:Uasts receive the ve1·y thing they. have been longing for, a real hockey rink on tJhe campus, and tl1en the weather is too wal'm--well, ;the paltJws is no less evident. Nature has certainly cheated the hockey men so far this winter, You can expect to shovel snow off the ice every othe1· day. There are people willing to spray the surface of the ice every nigh!t. All :tlhat is taken for granted. But to have no ice is beyond the p~tience of man. It takes more than a degree to make an engineer It's pretty hard to keep your mind on a study of fatigue-of-cable-sheath- alloys, when you are thinking of the joys of artistic creation. And why try? There is work aplenty in this world for engineers and artists~ for doc- tors, lawyers, builders, salesmen. The difficulty is that the individual doesn'talways connect up with his work .. Too many college men never take the trouble really to analyze themselves. Self examination now with the aid of your faculty advisor may save years of groping later on. And at grad- uation it will help you off to a good start. Wesf'tnt Electric 8 INC E 1 J 11' 2 M.ANVF.A.~TURERS FOR THE BELL SYSTF-1\11 \

He sees the desoriptions of London in the works of Gals- worthy as a sort of t.cst subject, having lived there all his life, for any anthor writes best about the things experienced in his early days. t·hc great modern writers of to- day seem to have sprung up im- mediately following the great war, and the majority have had a ten- dency to break way from any old and established traditions in the literary world. This is something that is surely needed and could easily be placed under the field of experimentation. ·Not al:l stories written with the aim of i11troduc- ing a new phase of literature will be a success but they are necessary to pave the way for the future. Many writers of today compared with those of yesterday may be said to write from nervous com- pact and American novelists of these modern times are working for a new reality. These are the individuals who can be expected to produce the literature of totnot-row.
