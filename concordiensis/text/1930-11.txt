Telephone designers years ago shut the door on many hybrid styles-seeking first to work out instruments which could best transmit the voice, then milking these few type's in great quantities. This standardization made possible concen- trated study of manufacturing processes, and steady improvement of them. For example,-the production of 15,000,.000 switchboard lamps a year, all of one type, ~ed to the development of a highly speciat machine which does in a few minutes what once took an hour. Manufacturing engineers,. with their early start in applying these ideas, have been able to develop methods which in many cases have :be• come industrial models. The opportunity is there!

Bill Hardman has a herculean ta•sk cut out for him if he is to turn out a winning quintet from the unimpressive material that has turned out for the squad. With only two playel'S of any class on the floor, he must de- v·elop a team f.rom the substitutes of last season a·nd from 'the . f·ew men coming up from the freshman team of last year. * * * * Swimming is in bad shape this year. Not a lette1o~ man is back and Coach Leona1·d is faced with a difficult task in trying 1 to tm·n out a winning agg1·ega tion. He has however been work-. ing hard with his squad and a decided improvement has become evident. A Good. Scrap We noticed in the Roches'ter Times-Union of last week the notice that the Rochester team did not come through the Union game withont any injuries. One player injured his hand, an- other received two bla.ck eyes and a third also had one colored op!~ic. It is some satisfaction at least t'O know that the Garn-et put up a hard scrap before they were downed. i&oaruilalr ltTlnmrr ~ ijop H. E.

Valves the • mtcroscope Burnished mirror-bright, etched in an acid-bath, a shiny square of steel is placed in the projector microscope in the metal- lography room at Crane laboratories. To the layman, the texture disclosed is surprising as the filigree design of magni- fied snowflakes. Sometimes it is like a relief map of mountain ranges, sometimes like finely veined marble, sometimes like cumulous clouds. But to the scientist in meta:ls who judges it with a connoisseur's eye, the surface tells a fa~· wider story. It discloses coarse uneven or beautiful fine·grains, tells of disproportions and proportions of con- stituents in, the a..lloy, speaks volumes concerning malleability, ductility, hard~ ness ... gives a key to action of the metal in servi€e, all based upon know ledge of the product. Careful metallographic records of all metals used in Crane valves and fittings, painstaking microscopic examination of all new metal's offered for possible use, are a part of the check and double check and triple check which is routine in Crane research and manufacturing. The full story of Crane application of chemistry and science to metals. is told in a fascinating book,\ Pioneering in Science.'~ I tis a valuable reference bookforstudents. Let us send you one.

Since the victories ove1 China and Russia, Japan realizeE.' she must support a large military force to retain her standing as a world power. This farce is a tre- mendous burden on the poor people of Japan. In concluding, Dr. Morris said that all these problems could be solved lf approached in a reason- able manner. He stated that war with Japan is impossible because of the economic .ties between Japan and the United' States.
