A r.eorganization of the government may be made by January, but the Council should not he afraid to be deliberate.

WEEK-END The opening home game of the season to- morrow with Hobart College begins the cam- pus social whirl for 1937-38. Skidmore fresh- of circumstantial evidence had been built up. Be- cause the news services play up the North-South pr~judlce angles of the case, the affair assumes a na.tiJ>nal significance and an eminent New York at- torney offers to defend the accused. The defendant is found guilty and sentenced to die, but the govB!·- nJ>r risks political oblivion with a commutation to life imprisonment. Then the murdered girls relatives an:d :friends take the law in their own hands, Whatever flaws may exist in tlle plot itself are· glossed over by the brilliant direction of Mervin Le- Roy. For brilliant is the only word for the way he suggests the violence of the murder and subsequent lynching, and builds the melodrazna. up to a ldnd of throbbing crescendo calculated to make the in- dividual squirm in his seat. And tbe story itself has an air of casual inevitability that is even more hor- rifying than the climax. You \Won't forget Claude Rains, Clinton Rosemond or <Horia Dickson.

The several sophomm·es in the line- up have tasted their first . bit .of varsity competition; practice in timing punts has been stressed in this week's sessions until Brock- myer has become adept at the maneuver; Adams has become ac- climated to his new position at cen- ter; and the team as a who1e has had the benefit of worlt.jng to-. gether the full playing time of a gance. In the scrimmage on Wednesday, several points slood out which might be factm·s in the issuse against Hobart. Tyler Dennett, whose pl'Omising last year's per- for.mance was not apparent in early sessions this Fall, looked like a million dollars in the few minutes he played and drove consistently th10ugh ,the frosh for considerable gains. Used at the right times on the right plays, he should pile up the yards in huge strides tomor- t·ow. Hammerstrom's passing- to , ) Brockmyer was the acme of per- fection, with two perfect contacts ,between the two made in the final \ scrimmage:r until·Sam had to retire with a bmised ankle. Amazon used good judgment in calling plays neat' the goal line, and the varsity scored imptessively when near pay terri- tory. These several points, occur· ring tomorrow as on Wednesday, would do much to m.ake the game as hard-fought as it is hoped to be. Hobart, on the other side bf the queution, will arrive >with prac- tically the same team which ran up, a 26-0 win over the Dutchmen at Geneva in the last meeting of the two. Only Tom King, Hobart's nomination for All-America hon- ots, will be sorely missed, and the outfit has already added one scalp· to its belt. The team is now com- posed. chiefly of seniors who have performed brilliantly for the past two years in regaining the Ge- nevans prestige in the football world after two years of consist- ent losses. Coach Speed Wilson, famed for his bag of fancy tricks, will un- doubtedly present a team adept in the use of tricky aerial plays, clever reverses and plenty of power plays. Mil\!)r, the dynamo of the backfield, Ferris, the broken- 'i field expert, Bowling and Silver will round out the veteran baclt- i' field, while the ends will be Bab- i cock and Armstrong. Co-captain ' Narraway and Grygiel will fill guard shoes; Courage and Dick- inson will be at tackle posts, and Harter or Benjamin will do the passing from center. Nitchman will have Ladue to use at tackle in this game, for Bill is ineligible for away games and has been awaiting his first teet this year. Otherwise, the eleven will re- main practically intact. Lewis and either Mulcare or Busino will flank the line, with Ladue or Kluge and Ladd at taakles. ·Lynn and Mulcare oi' II\ish at guards and Adams at center. Jake Amazon will call sig- nals, Thomas, Brockmyer, Ham- merstrom and Dennett will be used in the backfield combination.

From what we heard from Colby, Sam had a bit of difficulty in getting his kicks off, while Brock did a nice job.

Fred Patrie start- ing his first game for the varsity after a tVIo years apprenticeship on the frosh gave a performance which convinced Nels he has six seawor,tby backs whom he can trust in a game. 1Io~a11i Fumbled Often The best thing about Hobart from a. Union standnoint was its penchant f.or fumbling on the brink of a touchdown. Once their backs led by Hugh Miller, the hard · ' runnJng co-captain, arrived in the vicinage of the opposition 20 yard line, Uni()n would become the bene- ficiary of a welcome fumble. A little> less loose ball handling in the vital zones might have changed the games complexion decidedly. The Dutchmen set the style when Hammerstrom and Patrie lost pos- session during Union's first quarter rush, and. Dickson, Wright and Co. fortunately followed. Hobart threw thirteen .passes, mostly Intended for Ferris. They completed three. After the lead Nitch expected a ftood of passes and accordingly held Bill Thomas on the bench, using the taller Ham- merstrom in the safety position to better protect against any aerial adv.ances.

The fact is that our yells, few and spiritless as they are, are not known by a great part of the students, or, judging from their bewilderment on Sat- urday, by some of the cheer leaders themselves. This is a serious sit- uation. Cheering is an important factor- in winning any game but it cannot be effective unless it is peppy, colorful, and well-led. The \var- sity yell\ and the ''Number 1,\ for example, don't have any significance for the Union student. They are too much alike.

Following Football Games Wednesday, Oct. 6--Popular in- terest in organizing the non-fra- ternity men on the C!ampns for so- cial affairs was evidenced today when 35 students attended a meet- ing in Silliman Hail and made ten- tative a~;rangem.ents for tea dances following the R. P. L and Roches- ter footba}l games. Through the kindness of the I!'aculty Women's ·Club, with the assistance of the Pyramid Club, the non-fratern,ity lll.en will be en- abled to hold the dances in Hanna Hall. A temporary committee vol- unteered to work in con,junction with a committee appointed by the Faculty Women's Club. Arrange- ments for the first dance on Sat- urday, October 23, will be made by next week, Wrap]led in cellophane means somethfng more to Dominick DeLisa than juJilt an advertising phrase, Last year, as a sophomore studying botany under Dr. E-rn- est E. :Dale of the biology de- partme:t:~t, he experimented with mountlr~g plants in cellophane, and as a result of his work in the Union laboratory submitted an article on his findings to the bi-monthly journal of the Tor- rey Botanical Club. The article was printed last June under the title, ••Herbarium Mounts in Celloplun e.\ The initiation has tentatively been scheduled for Friday, October 15, in Hale House at 6:30 o'clock, to be followed by a dinner at 7 o'clock. The group also voted to .ask Dr. Oscar E. Voorhees, for.mer· secretary of the United Chapters of Phi Beta Kappa and its present historian to be the guest speaker. DeLisa shares the credit for this method of handling herbar- Ium nounts with W. Dwight Pierce of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. The sp..:~cimens of. plants, which compose a herbarium, retain their >Color very well under cellophane, DeLisa reported in his article, and they can be ob- served without difficulty. Anot.ller advantage of the cellop~ane mounting is that periodic fumigation would prob- ably be unnecessary if the mount were perfectly sealed. Wold Revises Text Kimball's 'Physics' Famo\1$ Standard Work Put Ou:t This Year by H. llolt Company Henry Holt & Compan:y an- nounced the publication of a re- vised edition of Kimball's \College Physics\ this year by Dr. Peter I. Wold, .professor of physics at Union College. Considered a classic in physi<:s texts, Kimball's work has for maEiy years been used a.ll over the coUJltry. · Alth<>Ugh much of the material became. out-of-date the general ar- rangenent and approach of the text was considered so excellent that Dr-, Wold was requester by the publislurs to revise it and bring it up to date,' This :Dt·. Wold has been doing for the p11st two years. In the revision of this tex:t of over 700 pages, about one-thil'd of the material has been entirel;y rewritten and numerous changes made throughout the re- mainder. Much of the old material has be-en omitted in order to make room for ne.w matter of more than passing, interest. Dr. \Wold states that in the text as it now stands, the general em- phaslo; is placed on. the :Physical rather' than the mathematical method in giVing definitions and explanations; never.theless, no ef- fort bas. been: made to avoid the concls..e mathematieal. formulation whlch appeals increasingly to the seriotu student. Such mathema!lcal formu:Jation lends itself as does no othel! to a quantitative treatment and umderstanding of the phenom- ena in the science of physics-a field -which is the example, par ex- cellence, of a quantitative natural science. Kappa Nu fraternity again head- ed the fraternity list this time with two members elected, while Sigma Phi, Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Sigma Delta and the non-fraternity group wet·e also represented. Perhaps not since the Union chapter was established in 1817, the first in New York State, have all the members elected typified lead- ership not in scholarship, but also in extra-curricular activities, fac- ulty members declared with pride.

Extensive Social Work Planned by U. C. C. A Tuesday, Oct. 5-The primary de- sire of the Union College Christian Association is to contruct a strong internal program, and to p1·omote activity among the students by their participation in work on the campus and in the environs of Schenectady. To this end much importance is. placetd on the solution <lf many practical problems of the kind with whicb tlle future scientifically and tecmically trained men must be familiar. A recent incomplete re- port from the publishers shows a· list of 31 institutions-including such institutions as Yale University and John Hopkins University- whicll have adopted the Kimball- Wolil text In t.helr physics courses. This was the principal topic of discussion when the organization met tonight in Silliman Hall to draw up its calendar of activity for the current year. Members of the organizational committee volunteered to make a planned sm•vey of fraternities to, investigate Interest and enlist those willing to help a four hours each week in active social work. A program for the year, as ap· proved by the committee of 24 stu· dents of all classes, was also adopted.

They have one man 1n particular-<>ne Buzz Eberle--who ran forty-some yards last Fall to register the lone score, and a. line which is heavy in the right places --«t the guard and tackle posts. They have a determined spirit in a score .of veterans. And finally, they are opening a season, which is al· ways the .highlight of the schedule. We may count on a game well· worth seeing, .. . . Although the squad has been re- ' duced once more by the sudden de- parture of one man, reducing the , total of 23, the team is in the best . shape it has been since the advent · of the season.

Directoi' Carroll Begins Wo1·k On \No Mo1·e Peace\ a Musical Farce With Director Edward L. Carroll back after a year's absence the Mountebanks formally began their 26th season yesterday afternoon with the first rehearsal of Ernest Toller's \No More Peace\. Rehear- sals will be held regularly every' ·day until the actual production which will take place on December 3, 4 and 6. The cast of 25 acto·rs has been chosen by the executive com- mittee and the play promises to compare favorably with those pro- duced last year by professional di- rectors from New York City. \No More Peace\ is a satirical anti-war play similar to the form of \Johnny Johnson\ which had tre- mendous success at Vassar's Experi- mental 'I'heatre and at the W. P. A. Theatre on Broadway last season. Ernest Toller inserts characters bearing Biblical titles into a rood- ern setting, combining his concepts of both heaven and earth. Affair to Be Held Following R. P. I. Game; Other Events Will Follow A tea dance following the R. P. I. foGtball game here has been ar- rau.ged by the Faculty Women's Club ·and a special committee of non-fraternity- men, as the first step in the social organization of the neutral group on the campus. Tomorrow afternoon at 1 o'clock in Silliman Hall all non-fraternity students will meet informally tG consider further plans for the first social gathering of its members on Saturday afternoon, October 23. Hanna Hall will be used for the first event and dancing will be held in the Green Room also. Frank Fleming's orchestra, which per- formed at the Skidmore-Union freshman party, will provide the music.

The music, which is similar to that olf a musical comedy, although it does not play such an important role, will be accompanied by a Ham- mond organ, to be played by Tony Sharpe '38. The musical theme is more along the lines of a chant, like the rhythm of a Gilbert and Sulli- van play, and will be carried by a chorus of voices picked by Sharpe last week. The dance will be given with the cooperation of the Pyramid Club, under the guidance of Vilmar K. Bose, '38, and a special committee appointed by the Faculty Women's Club. Mrs. Fredericlt J. H.

Purt of the increase in efficiency that has come about in the power-generating field in the last fe1v years bas been due to increased steam te1nperatures and pressures. As a result, the nu>dern turbine shell nms, almost literally, ret! bot. This shell must withstand pressures such as exist half a mile down in the ocean and must keep a 20-ton rotor spinning perfectly in linP. lleat softens metal. just as it softens candy, and permits it to stretch. This stretch, however, l.liUSt be kept to the ntt · rc·•t rrrrp- - ahcmt onp part in 1000, if the changes are uniform. In the Schenectady Works turbine sbop, auto· n1at~c electric furnaces hold samples of turbine steel at the temperature which will occur in the ttnbine. Gauges, which indicate changes of one part in a million, measure the creep as the 11ieces are exposed to beat for years at a time. From these tests, the best steel is selected. .{t; has been largely due to this research carried on by General Electric that the temperature and pressure of steam used in power generation have been raised to unexpected highs in the last few years.

MUSIC By HERBERT 0. FOX Dup•·e Concert R~vie-w <Continued from Page 1) I . ite can be given the whole attention · of the player. This last fact - or ill imaginatlc:m • . To compose a piece before · a large , aud · ience, without a stop and with- out e.ven a glance at the theme :be- forehand demands a sensiti.ven~s : and imagination so acute that no : oppo1 tunity is lc,;t to utilize this great knowledge of music in de,.,el- . oping and beautifying the cornpasi- . tion. M. Dupre's feat is one 'Wil:.ich we have never before seen and vtfl.l ' probably never again see unless it is once m01e by this genius. The same qualities mentioned in 1 ee;ard to - the improvisations 1vere ' also present, though pet haps not as · vividly, during the first part of -th.e concert. The program wa!:l ope·Jled with Bach's Fantasy and Fugue In G Minor. In this selection M. Dupre played with the greatest of con- ' fidence and precision. His technique ' is impregnable; his strong, sure fin- gets neve1 produce a blurred (.()ne, ' · so common in organ playing; a~d he has an infinite ('apacity · for !<mal coloring and expression. He brought Bach to life as a vibrant, colorful composer; not a labored techni-<:ian as he is so often presented to u:s . Another high point of the eve31lng , was the playing uf his own compo- sitions. In his Ballad for Pla.no and s Organ he was accompanied by his J daughter, who is an accom.pli:shed 1 and facile pianist. We will noi at- - tempt to pass judgment on this t work as it is much too intricate to t grasp at one hearing. The ch~lcest t. . piece of music heard on the pro- 1, gram was Dupre's Angelus. This compO'.,ition paints a vivid plctUI e : s of a country church and peasants r - kneeling in the fields as the cD.lmes :s herald the approaching nigb.tfall. The accompaniment to the chimes t- creates a sense of hallowed peace , d which affected the audience to the ~- extent that it hesitated several sec- OI;Ids before applauding. This was •e followed by a Prelude and Fug-ue in •1- A Fiat, also by M. Dupre, The f'ugue ~r consists of two themes instead of rt the customary one, whi~h blend t~ .s' gether gracefully amid reve . 1sible a- counterpoint . .is Tht o~ghcut the evening M. bu:pre 1g was qmet and dignified in his pres- .ic entation.

Vermont, which was so1.mdly trounced by 'Vi!Hams . Satm day should by pre- game forecast · be an easy victim but agai.nst the temperamental Union squad anything can happen . Swarthmore> Scores Fit·st A spirited Swarthmore eleven took · entire charge of the first two period:; of the game, blocking kick$, charging thi ough the line and, after· the first real hr . eak of the game - · a pass interference on the Union 15- yard 'line with 55. seconds to ~o un- til tlle intermissiOn-completmg a neat pass into the end zone from Ed Jakie to Weltmer, who leaped high and snatched the ball from Sam - Hammerstrom for the first score of the game.

Then another drive was begun, this time it;auguratet.l . by Billy Thomas who prcked up th1rty yards in two attempts. Hammer- strom re-entered the game, passed a \beauty\ to Dennett for ten yards, another to Busino who _miss· ed the ball but made the gam as the referee, now seemingly on Union's side awarded interference. He duplicated the act a minute later and awa-rded the ball to Union on the ~ yard line as Jakie played push and pull with Ray Lewis . Hammerstrom and Brockmeyer then combined efforts and put the ball over in two tries as the min· utes ticked along. But Lewis was offside and the ball bent back to the ten yard line. It was apparent that there was , time for just abo.ut one play, so Amazon called the inevitable - a · try for field goal. The stands were tense as La.dd stepped back for the attempt, but at once broke into a frenzy when the ball split the crossbars, bringing to a close a dramatic afternoon of football.

THE NEW STUDENT GOVERNMENT The Student Council, meeting as a committe8 of the whole in its :present.attempts to put through a new constitution based on rep- resentatlDn of all organizations a,nd activities of undergraduates, has ma:de some dt:astic changes in the method of Student Bady function- ing. Some of the new recommendations are; 1. Freshmen will be given the rigbt to vote on all matters. 2. To hold only three meetings of the Student Body each year: the Monday ~allowing the opening of college; the first Monday after the opening of the second half of the year· and the first Monday in May. ' 3. Alth~ugh special meetings may be called by petition, regular meetmgs of the Student Body will enable passing of resolutions, repealing or enacting specific legislation. 4. The Student Body may express approval or disapproval of de- cisions of the Student Council at meeting, though such expres- sions need not be binding. 5. A quorum of half of the Student Body must be present at all offi- cial meetings. Fox Defines \Ideal E~pstein Addresses :~College Graduate\ Government Course In Fir s.t Lee ture Speaks at Sesquicentennial Exercises at Franklin And Marshall Thursday, Oct. 14 - President Dixan Ryan ·Fox, in a speech to- day at the sesquicentennial anni- versary celebrations of Franklin and Marshall College, defined what the \idea-l gtaduate of a liberal a1 ts college\ .should be.

A general invitatian to all non-fraternity men is being made and the interest al- ready shown points to a large turn-: out. Erie Stock Company Plans Broadway Hit Free Grid Games At Johns Hop·kins Dr. Fox defined his ideal grad- uate as a \scholar gentleman, philosopher and a healthy animal\ who, after sampling \the various special interests of life and has chosen the most congenial to him\ assumes a \special function in a complicated society.\ He feels sure that, although one cannot earn his living by schola1ship alone, \the .votld needs a scholarship in every phase and will pay for it.\ Dr. Fox explained the part which the college played in producing this gtaduate. First, it should be an important factor in produc- ing a gentleman, \a man who has a >et of desirable cultural and social tastes that were once associated with a class hut are now available to almost everyone who will work for them.\ Then too, the college must aid in making good citizens, 'who know what is going on in the world and what types of or- ganization may be relied upon to remedy or encomage social and economic tendencies.\ It serves so- ciety best when it encourages young ciUzens to undetstand the mstitutions and practices, appraise them carefully and satisfy them- selves as to what parts are best. Thursday, e>ct. 15.-Political in- terference in -the constitutional con- vention for :New York State in 1938 will render almost any attempted imptov<'ments in the state govern- ment ineffectual, declared Henry Epstein, s<>licitor-general of New Yot k this nlOE: ning in the opening public lecture in the course in State and Local govErnment. The additional income thus re- sulting has been appropriated among the other student activities, with the new Freshman Record necessarily being favored:. The fi- nancial report of the tax committee on the Model League, the Student Council, Debating and Publications Board, are included in this issue of The Concordiensis. Debatin.g During the year 1936-37 seventeen intercollegiate debates :were held. Eight of these :were at home. Nine debates were broadcast. The Union debaters enjoyed a very successful year, losing only to Bowdoin, and defeating Middle- bury, Wesleyan, Williams, Tufts, Hamilton, St. Rose and Dartmouth. N a-decision debates were held with Seth Low, Fordham, Massachu- setts I n s t i t u t e of Technology, Swarthmore, Rutgers, Buffalo, Ni-. agara, Elmira and Cornell. Union was represented this year at the New York State Inter-col- legiate Convention held at Syra- cuse, N. Y. Approximately thirty men were active in debating at the begin- ning of the year. :By the end of he year, the number had decreased to about twelve.

Their airplane is smashed be- yond repair, railroads are non- existent, rivers are frozen over. What is there to do but radio for assistance and wait for that assist- ance to arrive. It is a long time coming, thanks to dashing Das- com's aerial double crossing and the unexpected appearance of Clara Wilson <Millicent Barr) one of Dinsmore's cast-off fiancees. How Dascom wins Ethel, how Clara wins Sir James, is the pur- port of a tale that twists and turns with laughs and surprises. Kimo. Little Seal, and Snow Bird, three :Esquimax, are played by Robert Regent, Sandra Waring and Helen Pitt, respectively. Robin Batcheller and Douglas McMullen are also in the cast. Day in 1930 An innovation, which Dr. Frank Parker Day, former president of Union College, predicted in 1930 would eventually come about, is· being initiated this wee!< at Johns Hopkins University. Henceforth, there will be no charge for admis- sions to football contests but only those who have received \invita- tions\ will be admitted to the games. Dr. Day, then president of Union for only six months, made his pre- diction in an address before the National College Athletic Associa- tion in New York City, January 1, 1930. In it he said: \Again like little David, I take up my ill-shaped pebble and shoot, but make no dent upon the forehead of the giant.\ But with these forebodings he made the following suggestions: \First that we stop making money and do away with gate re- ceipts. \Second that we give up profes- sional coaching, scouting, subsidiz- ing, dhecting from the sidelines, and come back to amateur coach- ing. \Third that leagues be formed among Jocal colleges that wish to play truly amateur athletics . \Fourth that no compensation of any ltind whatsoever be given to college p'ayers who participate in stadiUm games.\ At that time many of the news- papers reported the suggestions as 1. \Day Dteam,\ but many colleges\ are slowly coming to follow his ideas. Union has adopted most of his suggestions, the outstanding ex- ~eption being the abolishment of gate receipts. Library to Exhibit Ra1·e Book of Chauce:l\'s Taltes This newly adopted pollcy of . Johns Hopkins has done what was called the \most impractical\ of all of Dr. Day's suggestions, but ·they, too, now believe in the truth of his statement. ----01--- With his addrefls before the class of Dr. Vernon A. O'Rourke in Bailey Hall, Mr. Epstein launched the \practical\ p:rojects of the gov- ernment courses here. He is the first in the year's set ies of govern- mental executives and experts who will visit the campus to speak with Btud~nts on specific problems, ac- cordmg to Dr-. O'Romke who has succeeded Professor Patterson H. French in directing this work. 0 LTnion-Skidmore to Hold Joint Concert and Dance The Union College Glee Club, un- der the direction of Dr. Elmer A. Tidmarsh, will officially open its 1937-38 concert season at Skidmore ::::allege on December 4, when the two schools will present a joint concert and dance. According to an announcement issued yesterday by Elmer Johnson, manager of tae Glee Club, this is the only concert that has been definitely decided upon so far. Arrangements are being made for concerts with St. Lawrence and Clarkson Universities. A joint con- cert and dance with Bennington College is also being considered for the near future. The Glee Club is planning its yearly trips to Buffalo and New York as well as one to Binghamton. Arrangemenas are now under way to have the Union alumni or Boston, Mass., sponsor a concert. In what \Wa:s termed by many of the students as one of the most lucid lectur-es heard on a govern- mental Jl!Dblem, M•l'.

The Student Council in its appro- priations for the year 1936-37 spent $40.00 for the Keepers of the Jug, traditional sottish duty of the leading imbibers of the senior class. What resulted from the expenditure could not be determined by the general student body since the con- tents of the Jug were swilled on Class Day, two days after most of the undergraduate body had made its annual June exodus from the ·campus. At the first meeting of the Philo- mathea.n Society held last Tuesday evening in the Old Chapel, it was announced by President Robert :Oenzler that the society's first de- bate would be with Vermont on November 11 over station WGY . The subjeot of the debate is to be: As the faithful few who made Saturday mor·ning as~em­ bly tramped tneir weary way back aeross the path to Bailey Hall they found their usual uneventful procession inter- rupted by t11e presence of two comely Nott Terrace coeds blindfolded, kneeling, and mur- muring greetings of a very timorous nature to the tide of tired college men under the di- rection of a body of very stern taskmasters who were master- ing the ·ceremony. • .

The projects in Schenectady, the di- rection of two groups of under- privileged boys at the Y. M. C.

Y. A. project to enforce cain- pus traffic and parking regula- tions at all times, employing five boys 160 hours. The library has the highest number of students working on one project, 15 being engaged in general tasks and research bib- liography for the .professors. The Engineering <lepa.rtments will ab· sorb the 267 hom·s of effort on the part of eight students in com· putation, drawings, and chart making. The list of expenditures for the Student Council are among those reported to the Student Tax Com- mittee for the past year.

A large audience of about thit ty candidates, of which twenty were freshmen, listened to an address by. Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox. H.e showed the practicability of de'ba.ting in later life and how the training that . the debater received while looking up the material for his debate ·would prove a great a.;;set to him in later life. Dr. Joseph Rotundo. faculty coach, also spoke. He sh<>wed how deba.ting developed a flex:ible view- . point in presenting both sides of an issue and thus helped to eliminate prejudices and to aid the <lebater in latet· life to think without the hind- rance of outside influences. A new method for choosing the debaters who will participate in the Vermont debate has been worked out by Charle:; B. HonikeL, manager of debating. Eight new members will pat·ticipate in t1 ial debates, and the best men will be chosen to rep- resent Union against Ver:rnont. Bewildered for the moment the tide stopped, not !mowing What to think or do. But no, there was one in their ranks who grasped the situation and as C. Lewis Witham, '38, that blase veteran of many other- wise embarrassing situations stepped forth and loudly pro- claimed, \Who will give this poor young lassie a penny,- certainly not I.'' The crowd was moved to applaud this generous action from one they !mew so well and promptly showed t.heir appreciation when Preston Reed tossed out the soul saving coin.

One of a group of thirteen students of Phi l:ligma Delta Fraternity, Munzer w1ll be the guest of the Union Chapter and U.nion College. He will major in economics. Munzer was to have arrived in time for the regular fall registra- tion, but unforseen difficulties in obtaining a visa have delayed his arrival, He will be enrolled as a Junior, though -his scholastic stand- ing is probably somewhat higher, and will receive his degree as of the Class of 193!}. During his two years at Union. he will assist Dr. George H. Danton, chairman of the field of modern languages, in conducting a pronun- ciation class for those students who are having difficulty. He will also hold conve1·sation classes in Ger- man, and will assist Dr. Danton in his research. Munzer .was graduated at the head of his class from the ReJ'orm- Realgymnasium Musterschule, spe- cializing in foreign language. Since his graduation, he has been work- ing in a bank and privately pursu- Ing active interes.t in language, music and art. At the announcement of Munzer's appointment last year, Dr. Fox said that \no more significant step has ever been taken by any fraternity group in this country\ than the work which Phi Sigma Delta is do- ing in bringing outstanding Ger- man Jewish students to this coun- try and arranging for the C(mtinu- ance of their education.\ Of the thirteen German Jewish. students already in this country nine will have received graduat~ fellowships or instructorships, said.

The purpos-e .()f this editorial is to solicit intelligent critieism from the student body as to what the Jibrary's schedul€ should be. According to th-e most reliable I'-eports made by me1nbers of the library staff, the greatest number of students use the building in mid- mol'lling. An<! the statistics sh-ow that the librat-y is never filled to its capacity. We heartily ag1·ee with an proponents of the scholarly nttitude that the Jibmry should be u;;ed and u,;erl exten~ively. 'Tlw number of 'book:; tak~n out each w~ek from the li- brary shelves. t.he number of students who make use of the m1>st incidental services of the library, andl. the great amount of work that th:e staff has done and still has to do are arguments enough, we feel, against keeping the bui[di ng open Sunday n-ights.

TO THE SUBSTITUTES 'lhe unglorified second-stringer on the athletic team who has been so often g·lorified in pulp and pre-season print is the theme of our address. He is the unsung slavie of the g-l'idiron, the diamond, the track and the court-and he probably deserves to rernaiu u llSungo if athletic prowess means anything. But we feel that all substitutes, especially the faithful, should be given an oppo1-tunity to c:ompete in intercollegiate contests. That, after all, is where the athlete can redeem a week of drubbing at the hands of mates. 'lhe theory that athletics are for the good ·of all is incompatible with the genel'al desire ·that va1·sity and freshmen teams be victor- ious in all their engagements. Yet we cannot help but assert the belief that ev-ery conscientious athlete who com- petes for a varsity or freshman position be g-iven every opportunity to take part in the ::>aturda.y contests. It may not be in the strategy of a football offense to have a new line suddenly ins.erted just to give the sub- st.itutes a chance, but it would be in keeping vnth our small college attitude towards sports t-o have all players participating when. the op).>-ortunity is presented. Like all Paramount musicals, Artists and Models has: (1) a. good score, {2) a good cast, (3) a good orchestra, (4) a generous lack. of plot. To explain more fully: the score contains \Whispers in the Dark,\ \Stop You're Break- ing My Heart,\ and \Public Mel- ody No. 1\; the cast includes Jack Benny, Gail Patt'ick, and the Yacht Club Boys; Andre Koste- lanetz runs the band.; and the story has to do with a.n advertis- ing agency, \Townsend Silver- ware,\ and Ida Lupino. All this is endurable mainly be- cause Jack Benny has never been better. He gags his way through the script (we speak slangily) superbly, and with the help of Donald Meek and Rube Goldberg furnishes two of the best com- edy scenes were witnessed in some time. '(Jnfortunately for Artists and ModPls his comedy re- lief, as supplied by Ben Blue and Judy Canova, is relief in the fed- eral sense,--it just doesn't work,* Judy, however, shows up to ad- vantage in a number by the Canova \family.\ The photog- raphy and lighting incidental to the Kostelane.tz rendition of \Whispers in the Dark\ are very c·lumsy. but s u c h trivialities should be overlooked when the pic- ture has the magnificent Martha. Raye-Louis Armstrong specialty to its credit. Volume II of this week's edition is Sophie Lang Goes West, which is ne1t?er. good nor bad, but very, very md1fferent.

In. these parlous times, she seems trymg to lead an honest life but without much success.

FOX Opera came to the campus for the first time in the history of the college last night in the· pet·- son of Rudolph Thomas, E.uropean conductor, who gave a lectut·e-re- cital on Wagner's Tan.nhauser. 1'bis program was the first in a series of seven to be presented in tb.e Old Chapel in the next six months. These lectures, through tb.e co-opera tie>n of Mrs. Eat'le E. Rice, are free to students. Mr. Thomas opened· his talk with a brief summary of the events in Wagner's life and his personal traits which led to the writing of this, his third great work, He emphasized the \dualism\ of Wagner's individual character which formed the basis for the plots of most of Wagner's music- ·dramas. This constant struggle in the man between the Sl!nsual and the religious natul'e provided the inspiration for Tannhauser, Tristan und Isolde, and Parsif'a.l. This struggle is evide.nt in Tannh.auser from the overture to the closing strains, exempliflet:) by Tann- hauser's spiritual love for Eliza- 'beth and his sensual passion for the goddess, Venus. AI though Mr, Thomas is an in- t~rest!ng and informative lecturer, hl.'l p1ano playing lea. ves much to be desired. His careless technique, . tain comes .down. The play did not run as smoothly as last week's performance, but this may be attributed to the fact that the players rehearse during the afternoons of the week proceeding the performance. As they are giv- ing a different play during that week, tht'y have a great deal of difficulty in learning their Jin:es. Tonight's performance was saved , . by the excellent acting of Wylie ' Adams, who covered up for Miss ·Willison several times. _Next week. the Empire Players ~tll PI'e~ent another Broadway hit, :The Ntght of January 16th.\ This ts qutte a novelty, as the jury for the trial scene is chosen from the ~udience. The play has two end- mgs, according to the verdict rejtched. on, the poor piano, often produced qUtte 11npleusant and blurre·d ef- fects. N evettheless, as the purpose of these programs is not an eve- ning of _inspiri~g music by an easy and pamless mtroduction to the history, story, and music of these operas, this shortcoming can be overlooked. Iils method of com- bining a recital on the music of the operll; and a. !Peture on the plot is the st~piPsl, most effective way to ·acquam~ a comparatively untrain- ed audtence with the important parts of an opera.

Game Garnet Has Easy Time Defeating Catamount Eleven Hammerstrom and Brockmyer Account for Touchdowns; Ladd Kicks Field Goal Engineers Coming Troy Team Will Count Season Succ-essful If It Wins Contest With Union By BEN RATHBUN To correct what seems to be a preva:lent campus opinion, Union is not playing R. P. I. next Saturday as a wal'm·up for the Williams game. R. P. t. happens to regard us as its chief J•ivaJ. It is in a position somewhat analagous to Syracuse which has ·not won a game from Colgate In more than a decade. If the Cherry and White should top Union next Saturday, Troy is theirs. Mr. Hank Kurnpf, the present To- jan master mind, can quit worry- ing about his status. The harried coach and his much maligned team can return home, the past forgot- ten, all forgiven. It is such a sit- uation producing that almost fa- natical will to win, which changes setups into upsets. Yale defeated Princeton that way in 1934, and Syracuse thumped Cornell for prac- tically the same reason only last Saturday. Nowadays such reversals fo form seem to be the rule rather than the exception. Ask anyone who plays the football picking cal ds on Saturday( or anyone so utterly foolish as to publish his pi·edlctions). Union Scores First To escape fi'Dm this amateurish imitation of Schopenhauer on the ~ports page, there is the matter of Union's 17-6 win at Burlington Sat- mday. With Jake Amazon calling the plays and chaperoning ball carriers all over the place with his slam bang blocking, and Van Ladd attaining an almost professional ability with his deadly placekick- Ing, the Garnet won about as it pleased. It trailed in the first half when D. R. Jones, 160 pound Ver- mont half-back from Nott Terrace High, scored on a wide sweep from the Union three-yard line. Prior to this adverse saore Union had led when Van Ladd kicked a field goal ·-his third of the season-from the twenty-yard line. The ball had to , go through the posts at about an ·. eight degree angle, and a combina- tion kicker and golfer like Ladd never misses from such a lie. During their first period march Vermont took advantage of the Garnet's close backfield defense. · The defending halfbacks pulled in toward the middle and the Cata- , mounts' fast backs ran outside and · threw passes for their major gains. After Jones' touchdown Nltch- man plugged the leak and there- after Vermont's offensive went nowhere. Aerial Attack Used . Since Vermont stuck to the seven man line of which Knute Rockne was the ahief modern advocate, the Dutchmen opened up their offense. Hammerstrom threw fiat passes and the others used laterals to great advantage when the oppor- tunities presented themselves. It was a lateral which set up the first Garnet score. Merlin Brockmyer, the former Scotia flash, ran thirty yards from scrimmage and after being tackled tossed laterally to Amazon who carried on twenty yards further. Brockmyer's hard running was consistently outstand- ing. Sam Hammerstrom (contrary to the New York papers) scored the first touchdown. Later he suffered a recurrence of an ankle injury and had to be carried arway. Dur- ing their offeMive drives the Dutchmen continued to exploit the Vermont 7-2-2 by mixing fake re- verses with passes. In the second half Union added another touchdown accompanied by the customary Ladd conversion. T y Dennett an d B r o c k .my e r s-parked the last touchdown march. They ate up the necessary sixty yards in a hUl ry, Brockmyer going the final twenty In one gulp. At this point injuries took their toll. Adams, Hammerstrom, Patrie, and Kluge were all disabled and none of them .played in the fourth quar- ter. Union Vermont LE Lewis . . . . . . . . . . . . .

A pass from Tillar Shugg to Guy Bat tun in the end zon8 put· the ball in pay-off territory., Shugg's attempt at conversion from placement failed and the score re- mained 6-0 at the end of the half. At the start of the second half the Betas kicked to the Ph! Gams who were unable to score in four plays, Miller kicked over the op- ponent's goal line an.d the ball was brought out to the ten. On the .first play the Betas fumbled and Dave Tiedeman, Fiji backfield man, nabbed the ball on the 11 yard line. On the next play Shugg tossed to Miller in the end zone; then Miller ·converted from placement to in- crease his club's lead. to 13 point£. The Phi Gam's win necessitates the playing of .the final game in the tournament this noon, Phi Gamma Delta vs. Beta Theta Pi, since a team must be defeated twic in order to be eliminated.

Frosh-Ilion Game Results in 0-0 Tie Yearling Game Shot Through With Errors; Second Tie of Season Although the Drama Festival Is over, a group of stage struck fresh- men donned the moleskins and cleats, and gave a joint presenta- tion with Ilion High of \A Comedy of Errors\ in a Saturday matinee on Alexander Field. The action was extremely slow in spots-even the score was written in 0-0 time. The referee was the severest critic of the play, penalizing both factions quite freely. The game-it really was a foot- ball game-was featured by fum- bles and penalties, the referee be- ing a consistent ground gaine1· all afternoon. Each team had several chances to score, but neither was able to shove the ball across th-e pay marker. Union had pushed the ball down within Ilion's ten yard line when the half ended, putting a finale on Union's most serious threat during the whole game. Although the team was essen· tially the sam.e team which has shown cons.iderable power agamst the Union varsity in scrimmages, it lacked the finesse and verve which it has shown in practice. Three times Ilion reached down into the moth balls, emerged with a \Statue of Liberty\ play, and made appreciable gains each time. The most outstanding man on the field was \Stub\ Spencer, dim- inutive back for the Ilion team, who was very elusive, and reeled off several nice runs: Union Frosh Ilion High LtE Bothwell .. , . . . . . .

Mike Marotta, Blue Devil hill- and-daler, came in first, breaking the course record set by Paul San- toro last year, when he completed the three-mile course in 15:14. San- toro set the record at 15:24 last sea- son. Don Buell finished second, also breaking Santoro's record by five seconds. Robert Reed placed sixth and was the first neophyte to break the tape. His time was 15:53. The other yearlings to finish are as follows: Bradford Hastings, 11th; Sal Mau- riello, 12th; Don Colllns, 17th, and Leo Mrray, last. Since the first five men to cross the finish line were Terracians, the visitors were de- clared automatic winners, and the frosh were given the usual forty points. BELLINGER PAINT CO.

A victory over Union would mean a successful season to the Engineers, no matter what the rest of the season has in store. The drastic defeat suffered fro1>.1 the hands of Middlebury last weekend does not give a true indi- cation of the real strength of th.e 1937 R. P. I. grid squad. Coach Henry Kumpf, taking no chance.s of injuries Wt'ecking his first stringers, played the weak second team against the Panthers during most of the contest. After its vic- tory against Brooklyn College, 13-7 two weeks ago, the entire squad felt very optimistic about its an- nual cont~st with the Dutchmen. \The fi.1·st defeat of Union in fou.r years was prC>mised by the squad in lusty loud cheers in the locker room after the game,\ writes th.e RensselaeJ• J.>olytecbnic, the R. P. I. student newspaper. Union riding on the crest of a three game winning streak, is giv- ing the Tutes very little ccmsider- ation as a rival with a chance of marring the Garnet grid recot'd e>f three wins .and one loss. The Gar- net line has begun to operate effec- tively and the backs are carrying the ball with the zip that goes to make up a good team. With pros- -eects of the squad being at fuJI qtrength again Saturday, it seems offhand that the coaching staff of \Nels\ Nitchman and \Duke\ Nel- ~on should have very few worl'ies. The Engineet's have a veteran '.ine. Five lettermen have returned to this year's squad and have play· · · '' .ry well in its games thus fa.r. This line compares very favorably with the Union front guard, both tipping the scales at an average of 180 pounds. The backfields are be>th evenly matched in weight also, averaging over 170 pounds. The R. P. I. backfield is headed by George Shako, a sophomore viho did not pl.ay on last year's fresh- man squad, bllt who is a real triple tht'eat back. King Ward is the.

A seriousness has been developed and a scholal\ly pet·spective · introduced which is gradually raising Amer- ican students to the higher .standa!'ds of Emopean education. Yet even when that standatd has been · attained there will still be the belief in youth's importance. It's a healthy physical attitude and we sincerely believe in it. How- ever, the dignity of scholart>hip and s tHdy obviates the kind of puerility that is usually exhibited where youthful spirits m·e hig·h. There have been several instances recently where the excesses of collegiate en.tl11:1siasm have overreached the bounds of good fun. It is highly probable that the \fooling; on the telephone\ and \ragging\ of townspeople walking on the campus are incidental exan:l- ples of buffoonery that should not be blamed upon college 1nen. At any rate pointless practical joking is something that should he mutually condemned. FREE CULTURE L. Pellettier J. Steidle F. Hequembourg There seems to be a certain aversion among the .students to getting anything- free. The paradox is still more emphasized by the fact that within this week two I'ecitals, one in music and one in drama, were given on the campus, and students were to be admit- ted without charge. Friday, Octobet· 22, 1937 ~'URTHERING SCHOLARSHIP The opportunities of hearing the story of the opera \Tannhauser\ by Rudolph Thomas and of hearing- the monolog-ues by Wilfred Walter went almost unheed.ed by the stu- dents of the college. The reason fol' the apathy may be lack of knowledge about what the opportunities are, but it seerns almost improbable that 100 students shouldn't know what is going on and that at least 50 of those 100 should not avail tlternselves of the occasion.

The Union College chapter of Phi Sigma Delta, one of the most active groups in the national organization, is bringing t() Union one of those thirteen students. With the con:unendable generosity of the administra- tion, the Phi Sigs have made it possible for Hans ;\lUilzer to enjoy an academic liberty which has not been felt or seen in Frankfort for sevet·al years. active in bringing part of a different kind of II II world into the city. The jeers which follow M 0 T I 0 N such importations may in part be justified, ~==========.dl As an example of the praiseworthy effort the American Jews have made to help solve the pl'()blems of a strange people with whom they have little in common except perhaps a fundamental religious belief, the action of the Phi Sigma Delta fraternity is one of the best. The exchange of scholm~ship which Union began with St. Andrews University three years ago was based upon a mutual und-er- standing of academic philosophies. There is no such happy relation between American and German institutions. It is therefore for the obstacles of nationalism and prejudice. which the Phi Sigs have in part overcome. that they are to be commended for bringing Hans Munzer to Union College. but there is nothing like observing culture in its various phases. There are oppo1tunities galol'e here. Don't be frightened off by the fact th~t you don't have to pay anything fm· them. OH R. P. I. The editorial cliches are about to be un- slung once moTe in the semi-annual recog- nition of an athletic contest between Union and R. P. I. Yet we find it difficult to re- mark about the spirit which will be displayed over and upon the scarred battlefield of 52 Falls. However, we can sincen~ly and heartily welcome to our campus the new generation of R. P. I. students who will be watching as well as playing today's contest. The presence of the visitors from Troy will always he stimulating. To the respective coaches and :players of the four different sports teams we offer our . best wishes for interesting and successful competitions.

Rain and wet grounds have not hampered practice and many defects have been corrected as a result of these long drills. Sammy Hammerstrom is still hin- dered by a bad leg injury and if he is not ready to start, either Ty Dennett or \Rabbit\ Thomas will be given positions in the starting backfield along with Fred Patrie, Larry Brocltmyer, and Jake Am- azon. Last Saturday's game with Vermont saw Union go to the air the first time this year for many long gains. So, Saturday's game should see more ·Garnet passes than were thrown against Swarthmore and Hobart. + • * The first game of the Union-R. P. I. series was played in 1886. Since then athletic relations have been broken off several times. In the matter of victories Union is cred- ited with 28, R. P. I. 4, three end- ing in ties. The last time the Engi- neers defeated Union was in 1933 by a. 16-0 count. • • * Acting-captain Van Ladd has placed Union in the collegiate spot- light for the first time since Ralph Semerad gained All-American rec- ognition in 193·1. Ladd who has ·been well labelled \Nevermiss\ is tied with Rozman of Lebanon Val- ley with three field goals so far this year. Van also, strangely enough, leads the Union scoring with 13 points.

In practice this week Coach Bill Ketz has been priming his runners with speed workouts in an effort to break the scoring habits .of R. P. I.'s first five men. Eddie Wells and Howie Sheffer have shown more speed and it re- mains to be seen whether or not they can \turn it on\ this Satur- day. Assuming Johnson, Santoro, and Hawltes maintain their past performances, it is Frank Melewic.z whom Ketz is expecting to show improvement.

Tobias, senior secretary for Negro work in the Y.. M. C.

The con- sensus of student opinion seems to be that the library should be kept open on Sunday nights until 9:30 o'clock. Citing the failure of the Wash- ington peace conference in this re- spect, Mr. Tobias told stude.nts that in dealing with the :problem of war the world is faced with something deep-seated, the atitudes of one nation to another. \These don't change with conferences,\ he em- phasized. Having spent much time during the past months in Europe, Mr. Tobias is well-qualified to· discuss international relations. He cited many concrete incidents he had ob- served of the attitude of European peoples towards each other. In conclusion, Mr. Tobias re- peated the theme of a talk given by the late Frank A. Vanderlip, noted financier, to a group in Ger- many during the post-war .period, in which he said, \Europe's trouble· is spiritual, not economic. As long as there is an absence of good- will there can be no possibility of reconstruction in Europe.\ Science has brought no solution out of its laboratories for the prevention of war, Mr. Tobias warned his listeners. \It is a matter of atti- ( Continued on Page 4) Frosh Are Guests At Skidmore Party At Hanna Hall The first non-fraternity tea dance sponsored by the Faculty Women's club was reported highly successful by students, Mrs. Dixon Ryan Fox, Mrs. Frederick Burkett, chairman of the committee for the affair, and Vilmar Bose, '38, of the Pyramid Club who assisted in making the arrangements. The danee, held in Hanna. Hall following the R. P. I. game was so well attended that definite plans are being made for another similar affair to follow the Rochester game on Nov. 6. Approximately thirty-five couples were present at Hanna Hall which was especially lighted for the dance by Alfred Borden '39 of the Mountebanks Executive Committee. Mrs. Burl(ett reported that her committee was particularly pleased by the response and aid given their effort by neutral students who aid- ed materially in the arrangements for the tea by cleaning the theatre and washing dishes after the tea was over. A silver tea set dating from the ·early nineteenth century and pur- chased recently by the Faculty Woman's club, was used for the first time at the tea dance. The committee of the Faculty Women's Club in charge of the tea dance was composed of Mrs. Fred- erick C. Schmidt, Mrs. Douglas Campbell, Mrs. Vernon O'Rourke, Mrs. Frank J. Studer, Mrs. George J.

Five other 'Union fraternities re- ported that lhe majority of their members were in favor of the plan; there were only two fraternities whose members as a group did not favcr the proposal. Although few opinions of non· fraternity men were received, twenty neutr-als replying to the Concordiensis\ questionnaire were in favor of the plan while tbere. were only two dissenters. Helmer Webb, college librarian,. said he bad no statement to ma.ke' in regard to the results of the poll. The poll brought out several sug- gestions for improvements of the library. Several students expressed the belief tl:t.at not enough men would u.se tl:J.e library on Sunday nights to wa.tTant its being kept open, out a.t the same time they said they w~uld like to have the library kept open later at nigbt during the week. Several other students suggested that the library be closed on Sun- day afternoons and kept open Sun- day nights.

Spectators alternately groaned and cheered as the rain fell at intervals, let up,. · then fell again in torrents, con- tinuing .for the entireity of the afternoon a:nd thoroughly drench- ing everyone concerned. R. F.

P.

In the first quarter the ·neophytes were deep in Engineer . :territory, and Jack Vannier faded a stragetic position within a few minutes and proceeded· to take every advantage. Union, forced to , punt on her own 20 yard line, was penalized half the distance to the goal when Van Ladd was charged with a ·kicking penalty after the to Dennett being the most pr:ofi- table, The games between the two schools now stands at 28 Union wins, 4 for R. P. I, and four ties. baclt, passed the soggy ball to Jack Guibert who wheeled and lateraled •, it to Adam Ciensiski who battled his way over the goal. The attempt ·,at conversion failed. In the second quarter the Engineers made .their most serious threat of the after- noon when, as a result of a 53 yard run, they drove the ball to the Union five yard line with first down. The Dutchmen put up a gal- · bali had left Brockmyer's toe. The ball was surrendered to the Tro- jans who sent A1 Andrews over for the score in four plays. The at- tempt at point after touchdown was low and wide of the mark. The enthusiastic foliowers of the Engineers, whose spirits were about the only things not damp- ened during the afternoon, went literally wild as victory seemed possible. The early score seemed to be a comfortable margin as Union failed. to produce anythinb worth mentioning and bogged at crucial moments. The production of the apparently established second half rally brought Union again into her own as Billy Thomas, showing great ability, squirmed upfield for 25 yards on two end circuits, placing the ba.ll on the Union 30. Brock- royer then took over the burden and climaxed one 21 yard dash with another nine yard jaunt through tackle to nullify the Tro- jans' margin. Van Ladd, put on the spot under difficult conditions, miss~d his first placement of the year as the ball slithered off to the right of the crossbar. From then on it was a case of weathel'ing the storm and neither tewn maneuvered any advantage until the final minutes when Union worked up to the R. P. I. six yard line. With precious sec- onds left to play two run)ling plays lrl.oto the line wexe stopped dead and a final thrust at the end was halted as the closing whistle st}unded.. R. P. I. was joyous, Union dazed, for no one thought that the end was so near. * • • The aftermath of the struggle proved fully exciting as anything .produced during the regulaJtion 60 minutes. Pouring out of the stands, the Elngineers raced to the goal posts at the south end of the field and. launched an attack upon. them. A quick call for Union men brought and. emergency squad of Dutch- ment and a bruttle royal raged for half an hour until the last R. P. I. supporter was suppressed.

P. I. squad on the local course Saturday by the impressive score of 22-33, and broke a twelve meet winning streak enjoyed by the Engineers. The Tutemen had won their last two meets by perfect scores, while the Dutchmen had dropped two meets by one point margins. The team score of ·the event was of almosot secondary importance, as most of the spectator attention was focused on the outcome of the race between the respective cap- tains: the two Bills, Hitchcox and Hawkes. The Trojan captain had defeated Hawkes in their last two meetings, a:nd as both are seniors, lanky Bill of Union was out to avenge these previous defeats by a. victory in their final meeting . Rangy Bill Hawkes in running togs, minus shirt, driving to the finish line, and showing the effects of having run four miles in a heavy rain, wasn't from a purely aes- thetic sense, a beautiful sight, but consider-ing the fact that Bill was leading HitchcoK by about 150 yards, it was for those Union root- ers who appreciated the signifi- cance of the rivalry, one of the finest spectacles seen on Alexander Field, and Bill was given a very generous round. of applause. Hawkes' time for the run was 27:51.3, which although approxi- mately one minute over the Union record, is very impressive when the condition of the course is taken into consideration. Hitchcox was timed at 27:50.3. Paul Santoro, running his usual smooth race, finished third. O'Rourke barely nosed out Ed Wells for fourth place. Union gar- nered the. next two places when Frank Melewicz and Bill Johnson came down the stretch ahead, of Hover.

Since his l'e- . turn to America in 1923, he has taken interest in many current problems such as world peace, can be justified in certain cases when it is the only effective solu- tion to the problem of war and it~ prevention. Thel'e are some occa- sions when only force can be used. It must be resorted to since the situation is so utterly had that kindness and goodwill have no effect. As an illustration of this point he showed that the only time Jesus used violence was in driving the money-changers out of the temple for it was only by the use of force that this could be done.

That sound.::; valid. Coming from the student body it sounds also like something of an accusation. From a library staff not altogether be- yond reproach in previous matter;; one would expect an immediate move. There has been none. Now the editox·s suggest shifting respon- sibility to the students. LPt the motion come ft·om them, they write. Naive to expect a form of con· certed· action from the collective group. The whole matter promises of unhealthy delay. The problem has been presented. It becomes the problem of those under the Great Dome. Theirs is the staff, theirs the obligation of service. Let them engage themselves in experiment and survey on average library at- tendance during the week-end. The students create the need.

So successfully do they do so that ,one could almost congratu- late Darwin on his discovery for Clarence Day's sake; or maybe Clarence could have dispensed with Charles. It is all too possible that you will laugh over LIFE WITH MOTHER, but if you have read about Father, consider yourself collapsible when you read about Mother. American Victorianism have seldom taken such a beating; it is also doubtful whether its representatives have ever enjoyed themselves so much submitting to one. Clarence Day died in December, 1935; so Ameri-can satire will have to be content with the lives of Father and Mother as the char- acter studies of a still too signifi- cant generation. It rnay be that the rather sad, serious look on many of the phi- losoph.ers' faces is there because they have bunted too long to find such an appt•ec)ativ~ iilterpreter as Clarence. His English is peculiarly easy to follow, and that would be too much to say of most modern writers. We don't mean by \intel'- preter\ that he speaks no one language of his own: we mean that he says in an easy, sometimes colloiJ. uial sty 1 e, w hat many bearded ones have tried to say be- fore. At any rate, no reviewers we know of have told us what Clar- ence Day has said. Their reviews were filled with laudatory, but silly, adjectives.

The election of the committee was held unexpectedly in daily as- sembly Friday, under the auspices of the Student Council, and the count of the ballots showed that 1<!5 men out of a junior class of loO were present in chapel that morning and voted. It was hoped by the council that by calling the elec- tion without announcing it, politi- cal deals would be prevented and a fairer ve1·dict rendered. Five men presented objections to the council concerning the conduct of the election. However, theit· claims were not seriously consider- ed because of their failure to pre- sent any evidence beyond declar- ing the election was \unfair.\ The council in its meeting tonight ex- pres .. ed their unanimous approval of the results of the action and stated that to their knowledge deals had been completely eliminated.

For that reason mernber:ship on the committee has been consider.ed almost a su- preme 11ecessity. Editors of The Concordiensis, The Garnet, and The Handbook in the :past have made their positions honors that :P?Y. The same has applied to other m~mey-rnaking oi·ganiza- tions and nothing has been done about it. By making \an example\ of The Garnet the Student Council has established what we hope will he a precedent. The clear definition of the salaries of student managers of profit- making booies and the strict adherence to a budget which is carefully made up by the Student Tax Committee evet·y year will be one way .to eliminate the cuese of honorar- iums. There are innumerable difficulties to be overcome in the supervision of the student taxes. But we feel that the Student Council has taken an action indicative of the proper unselfish spirit which should be taken in the administration and control' of student activ- ities from now on. Let us put student activities on a strictly business b2sis where finances are concerned. Let us maintain the amateUl' spirit ()f college activities where such spi.rit will not be con- fused with. monetary considerations.

TEST CASE The power of The Garnet to levy a tax of five dollars upon fraternities for group photographs was declared illegitimate by the Student Council Wednesday night. The deci- sion of the council was based principally upon the assumption that the additional in- come to l'he Garnet had not been included in the budget for 1937-38. The result of the hearing cast no ill re- flection upon the intenti()ns of the editors of the yearbook, for they made intelligent and willing argument in suppo1t of the tax on the basis of improving The Garnet typo- graphically, pictorially, and editorially with the $80 or $90 which would accrue through this tax. Yet the council bravely rejected their re- quest on purely constitutional grounds, and did S() with as unprejudiced an attitude as could be taken. lost its progenitor. With the death of the Nott Elm ends the oldest living example of all traditi<Jn of Union College--in fact of America. The tree, stripped of its g-lory after sev- eral hundreds of years in the center of what is now Uni()n's beauty spot, has been phys- ically dead for many years. But the tradi- tion surrounding it has long passed into im- mortality. All we <!an commemorate now is the fact that the artificial supports no longer hold up a majestic, dying elm, the symbol of an American tradition. The g-reen~ young tree which will grow in the elm's place can only substitute for a symbol of nature and an- tiquity wll.ich can never die so long as there are minds to thi.nk and dream. ANOTHER HALF-CENTURY The idolization of football as a national sport has some foundation in tradition among the \Ivy Leaguers\. In the days when Union defeated Harvard crew in the Sara- toga and Poughkeepsie regattas even before Yale did, and played such teams as Yale, Cornell, and Dartmouth in football. tUnion met some ()f her small college <>p}lonents who are today still on the athletic schedule. The case of The Garnet raises a number of qu.estions about student aetivities at Union College.

High School Teams Play Annual Game Here Today The sixth game in the rivalry between Mont Pleasant and Nott Terrace High Schools will be played Tuesday on Alexander Field. The series began in 1933 when the Red Raiders from Mont Pleasant won 25-0, ~;~nd continued winning ways for the next two years by scores of 20-0 and 6-Q, In 1935 and last year N ott Ter- race came back to win both times by the same score, 13-6, and. is favored to even the count at three games this year because of a bril- 'liant passing attack. In the whole series, the Red Raiders have scored 63 points and the Blue Devils from Nott Terrace have scored 26. Each year Alexander Field is used because of better accomoda- tions for the large crowds which these games attract. As a result ~f this CGurtesy, Union College stu- dents a.re allowed to see the game on pres en ta:tion of their athletic cards. ---•0•--~ Frosh Teams Encounter Williams Men Tomorrow The freshman tea.:ros, the eleven and the cross-ccmntry squad, ac- company the varsity footba.ll team to Williamstown tomorrow to en- gage in their final contests of the 1937 by meeting the respective Williams College teams.

Wheatley is about to start his first season as \swim- ming professor\ of the college. He has taken over the remnants of tea.rns which have not won a swim- ming meet in the past two and one- half seasons, and with a fair sup- ply of new material, is working dil- igentlys, and wasting no time about it either, to get the 1938 edition into shape so that we may win a few meets this year. To Mr. Wheat- ley The Concordiensis sports staff extends the best of luck in this dif- ficult taslt. $ * • And speaking of swimming, we recall the R P. I. game last Sat- urday and suggest a bit of praise to all those who did not let the rain dampen their ardor but came to see the Dutchmen play in spite of it; and some long and loud boos are in order for those who stayed under cover and listened to the Yale-Cornell or some other big- time game. • * • Perhaps Coach Ketz has found something in the person of Bob Erison who stepped off the 100 yard dash a.nd 220 in fine style during the recent intramural track events.
