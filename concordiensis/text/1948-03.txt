Employee Poll Shows Girls Enjoy Work Questionnaire of Ladies Fair Gives Air to Facts So Rare Dm·ino· the week of Febru- ary 23, the Concordiensis con- ducted a poll of the secretarial staff of URion Col'lege with the aim of discovering some- thing of the background, per- sonal interests and opinions, and future plans of the em- tll'oyees of the College. In the, near future, the ground crew II of fhe College w:n be polled in a similar manner. I Of the 71 secretaries employed by the College, 42 filled out the : questionnaires which were distri- buted. From those questionnaires which were returned, the following facts were gleaned: Some Pertinent Faets Founded at Union .College in 1877 SCHENECTADY, N.

Fear of Russians Mr. Kerensky opened his lecture by commenting that after a little more than two years, nothing re- mains of the strong bond of ft'iendship which existed between· Russia and the United States dur- ing the war. He remarked that all admiration and syl;llpathy for the Russian people had been dis- solved by suspicion, fear, and hate, and that if or the first time in his- tory diploma:tio relations between the two countries are now eng,aged in a \cold\ war which may chan&\e at any time to a real conflict, Mr. !Cerensky added that \we are living in a strange time when all is pas- . sible, nothing ineYitable.\ March 3, 1948 To the Editor of the Concordiensis: This letter is addressed to the whole stu- dent body. 'since the Concordiensis is the student body's authorized medium of com- munication, I would appreciate your pub~ lishing it in your columns. The past week has apparently been one of disappointments. Certain members of the student body have expressed their dis- appointment when the administration made the customary routine request that fi·ater- nity officers take note of the regulations concerning house parties which the Inter- fraternity Council itself set up in the fall of 1946. The only new wrinkle was that chaperones, we thought, :might in courtesy be privileged to make any comments they saw fit after the party. This, I might note, has been the approved college prac- tice on most campuses for many years. It is no reflection upon the conduct of the parties, but is a protection of both the fra- ternity and the college against unfounded charges. The error in judgment, freely admitted by the administration, was in making these requests in a letter to the fraternity presidents instead of calling these officers in for discussion in advance. Because of this, the request for reports from the chaperones was waived until the matter can be discusse dwith the fraterni- ties. The aforesaid students have also ex- pressed disappointment that .some adminis- trative officers have spoken critically of student conduct. In the first place, the freedom of speech and of the press should apply both ways-if students desire free- dom to criticize the actions of the adminis- tration, equal freedom must be granted to faculty and administrative members to criticize the actions of students. Also, it .can certainly be assumed that those of us who have invested our careers at Union are quite as concerned about the good name of the college and its students and their activities as is any student. In fact, some of the officers have as their chief responsi- bility the maintenance .of reasonable good conduct and student and public relations, and are expected, if they do their job well, to be cognizant of student attitudes and performance, The disappointments, however, have not been all on one side. I have been deeply disappointed that students, instead of using the duly constituted democratic stu- dent organizations set up for the expres- sion of student opinion to the administra- tion, have descended to irresponsible vili- fication, the circulation of unverifjed rumors, and other acts in extremely poor taste. It is disappointing that, instead of settling our problem in .conference on the campus, they are spread abroad to hurt the good name of Union. It is especially disappointing that, as soon as a disagree- ment in opinion appears, some students immediately take it for granted th&t the motives of the administration are sinister. If we cannot both concede some sincerity and good purpose to the other, discussion becomes difficult and the situation is im- possible to arbitrate. Perhaps there is consolation in the thought that these have been misunder- standings rather than fundamental dis- agreements, that the exaggerated expres- sions of opinion have been individual aber- rations rather than general student atti- tudes, and that out of frank discussion of such problems may come a stronger unity of campus morale. Of one thing I am sure -at the houses I visited Saturday evening the atmosphere was full of fun and at the same time respectable. Carter Davidson PRICE 10c Calm Prom~ildcat Sheet, No Reports After Conduct Row An aroused campus has demonstrated in the past week . that the much-talked-of student body apathy has disap- peared for a while. A mass meeting of fraternity \\vheels the publication of the Discordiensis, a statement by the Presi- dent and forthcoming statements from the Chaplain. and the Administration as a whole have keynoted the past week of furor. Clarification Due Soon The row, originally stemming from a letter from the Dean's office pertaining to House Party conduct, was fanned by the appearance of a cartoon and two vitriolic issues of an unsigned \newspaper\, entitled \The Discordiensis\ Concordy cor- respondence has reached an un- .precedented high with letters per- taining to the argument. The Administration, yielding to student body agitation, Friday aft- ernoon recalled the order requiring chaperones to send in reports of conduct at the end of the parties. P r e s i d en t Carter Davidson has written an open letter to the stu- dent body that is printed in this paper commenting on the past week's activities. Crowning blow of the week were two mentions of the squabble in the column of a would-be Walter Winchell in last night's Union Star. Odd fact was, House parties, living up to their usual selves, were quiet, moral affairs. (See Page 2) ---•0 Campus Chest Donates I Yesterday the campus chest committee donated $3,750 to two local organizations, and three college benefit funds. The money is the bulk of the sum collected in this year's Campus Chest drive. Approximately $400 came from larger sums than $5, and the remainder from smaller sums. $3,784.65 has been collect- ed so far, of the $4,940 pledged in the course of the four month drive. The 228 members of the col- lege community who have not as yet paid their pledges are urgently requested to make their contributions as soon as pos- sible. They may be left at the Student Activities Office in Washburn Hall. <b-------- Dr. McKinney Is Chapel Speaker Cites Importance of Intellectual Awareness\ Pres. Richard I. McKinney, Ph.D., of Store College, West Virginia, and representative of the American Friends Ser- vice Committee addressed the chapel assembly on Wednes- day. He stressed the import- ance of correlating educational efforts at the present time so as to eliminate unnecessary and ineffectual lines of en- deavor. 'Why College \Give one good reason why you are in College,\ he challenged. No definite answer exists for all col- ·leg,e students but there is a gen- eral purpose behind the imp-ort- ance placed on education in the United States. Throughout our history, the tremendous advances made possible by technological learning have been graphically illustrated. Hitherto, further ad- vance has been sufficient warrant for s~udy, but now the world has reached a stage where the know- ledge gained in the past .Presents a serious threat to the continued existance of mar.kind. Now the student must turn to the study of himself and his fellow man to find the means of curbing physical forces of atomic rank. Peace Varies \'Peace' has changed its mean- ing today,\ he said. The requi- sites for peace in any section of the world is peace· everywhere in the world. Technical advance has made the globe shrink and society swell. If anyone is to have peace, it is necessary for his neighbors to be at peac·e, but neighbors to- day are citizens of all sections of the globe. Hale House Innovations Meet Student Approval In response to the frequent outcries of various persons around cam- pus, William South, manager of the Hale House dining hail, with the cooperation of the administration, had added another service for the · benefit of the student body and faculty.

Continuing, Mr. ;Kerensky said that the developments of tomor- row depend on an understanding of the causes of tension between the two nations.

As J,ng \\ an agreement is in force it should be lived up to. \\'hl'n one does not approve of an agreement, h<' should at tempt to modify it, not violate it. J}, ing in l'llllC'g-e, we are assumed to he men, and \~ \u\h are expectnd to live up to accepted standards of guod taste and discretion. Insulting a guest is indt•fcnsilJ!c, and it's not stretching it very far to rail a chllp<'l speaker a guest. One's moral code is one's own affair, and a bull spgsion, not a college newspaper, is the place to dis- rugs it. Last week's -Concordy reminded me of noth- ing s\ mueh as a group of little boys standing on a \\' nf•r us in~-:\ bi~ russ words to prove how manly they :or<'. It was no cr~dit to the college. the student body, or thP editurs. Sincertoly, Donald R. White \Picturing many of today's college girls as inse- cure and anxious to please, the Chaplain said that sexual promiscuity often results from girls' willing- ness to conform to what they believe to be accepted patttorns of conduct at house parties.\ All Man's Fault? It is very interesting indeed to notice the natural convergency of the points of view of these three speakers >vho throw all the responsibility for low morals to men. Everything which is \bad\ would come from the man and the part of lhe woman or girl would be only compliance. If we were in France, that would be fine and I would agree wholeheartedly with these statements with this difference that the kind of girls which correspond to the American college girls behave much better <consequence of their education by French men.) But we are in which amazes the which is given to females are! the United States, the country world for the privileged place women; how spoiled American Jf' oman Pott'er When men do associate, it is for the well being of the population as a whole (except few men clubs where the purpose is to get a>vay from women.) But when women do associate, it is most of the time for THEIR well being. To get an idea of the influence they have, one has just to look at the number of the magazines for women and how many are sold. To realize their \achievements\, look at the facts. They own 70% of the U. S. wealth (how did they acquire it?), buy eighty percent of the mer- chandise and ~~uld, if they were smart enough, control the pohtlcs of this country (they have the majority of the voting power and they can no !anger say that war is \man's fault.\) It has been held in certain circles that for the \capital sin\ affair and others, the initiative is to the man. But we are here concerned with sexual pro- miscuity which is relevant to social manners. By the fact that it is a behavior practised in public (before other than the party couple) it is approved (meaning spinsters with a harsher voice would scream it and women would refuse \even\ their compliance.)\ Marriage Wreckers By having suppressed prostitution women did not change the character of those who would have been in normal circumstances (supply and demand) prosti- tutes. This kind of women let free in a society is doing more damage by wrecking good long marriages. In Reno I saw them operating by transforming them- selves into gold diggers (after the gold has been dis- covered) marrying old bankers <I am sure that some were connected with the cigar industry.) These women do break homes, and they are harmful to society. lr If the moral status today in the United States is, such as it is, the cause lies with the women. The kiss is not a unity in itself and it is said that our ancestors far back didn't know it as such; anyway, it doesn't mean anything these last few years. Single Standard U ph.eld Today in the case of a double standard boy he can very often but trust the future. In the case of a single standard society, if the boys profit of the conditions created by the girls (permission to kiss them and light love-making) and do not try to change them. they made a choice, They prefer \having a good time\ now, they won't complain, they expect the same from the girl they are going to marry. In s'!ch a society, there is no reluctance to marry d1vorcees as well as girls. The ~ystem p:oposed hereby would be groups of boys gomg out w1th groups of girls without the idea ~f \possession\, an even number not being necessary. _,.o dutch. You do not owe anything to a girl more than sh? does. There is an equality of enjoyment. The pr1vate datmg would be justified if you like a girl very much, and the kiss would have a meaning of l~ve_ and the payment of going out should not be a d1ff1cult matter to settle. .Time is marching on! It is time that the pendulum swmg back. Let us unite MEN! It plu\'•·d th:ot l'ln· >'llllil'llt \l'il it \'\·' n••t dc·nd hu1 nnlr ~k··pin~.

His time \Vas 5:35.9 as compared to the pl'evious record time of 5 :41.4 set by Bob Oppenheim in 1934. Garnet Inexpel'ienced This is Courter's second year in competition and his record is the second set by a Garnet swimmer this year. The other was set by Joe Tafel in the McGill meet. With one exception, none of the Union mermen have seen competition be- fore Coach Muliane's arrival at Union. Their remarkable improve- ment is something that both Coach Mullane and his proteges may be proud of. The hearbreaking 38137 loss to Trinity was due mainly to the dis- qualification of Tafel in the 200- yard breaststroke because of an \illegal\ kick. He actually won the race with apparent ease. Otta- viano showed much improvement in this race and placed second. <S> -------- ------ Fir«t place winners for Union were Mike Samal, 50-yard freestyle; Paul Sharadan, diviQg; Jim Courter, 440- yard freestyle; and Dan Mead, Tafel, John Barbet, 300-yard med- ley.

If the defending player feints or fakes for the ball. the aggressor will almost alwa-ys get a foul shot on the decision. On the other hand if the defense is pressing the opposition down court anything goes. Usually the scramble wHI result in a jump ball. Modern basUettball is now a much faster game than was orig- inally played. If the officials call the game the way the rules de- mand, the game is too slow. Let the officials relax a moment on their decisions and nothing short of mayhem will result. Somewhere between these two eKtremes their must be a happy medium.In the old game there was a jump ball First Call For Track Candidates Is Issued Coach Bill Ketz issued his first call for candicates for the Garnet track squad this week, and any men interested should report on Monday, March 8.

This rule was an eKcellent stabilizing factor. It at least slowed the game down so that the officials wouldn't he swamped completely. Something is wrung with the wholP set up on fouls.

Trying to find the underlying causes in this unfortunate situa- tion, Everett Dean, Stanford bas- ketball coach. is heading a Re- search Committee of the National Associa lion of Basketball Coaches of the United States. This commit- tee is conducting an extensive sur- vey of all college coaches. Results of this survey will be mad·e known at the annual National Com·ention of the coaches in New York City on March 22. At first sight it may seem a bit late in the game to conduct this research of basketball. But it is evident from the nature of this study that full seasonal informa- tion is necessary before any defi- nite action can be taken. I hope that something tangible results from this study. Basket- bali cannot continue in its pr-esent state of confusion. * * * CHEERS FOR JEERS There may be some hope of doing something about the present dis- graceful cheering set up at Union. At its meeting two weeks ago the Student Cou·ncil set up a commit- tee to investigate he shortcomings of the cheer eaders. This commit- tee, headed by Jim Landry, will work in conjunction with Hal Wittner. The laxity with which cheering assignments have been handled this year has been un- comfortably evident. It has been recommended by the Council that cheerleaders be pres- ent at a specified number of ath- letic functions. How absurd that the Council should even have to make such a recommendation. Must we thank our eKponents of school spirit for making an ap- pearance whenever they feel the urge? What a farce!!!

StudP.nts Oareless Few of the secretaries who have been here for any length of time find the post-war Union greatly changed from the pre-war College, with the exception that they con- sidet' the student body more ma- ture and the facilities cmwded. Most of secretaries polled seem to be satisfied with the conduct of the students, except that some of the latter seem at times to be a little careless in their manner::!. Many of the staff express a regret that they cannot come to !mow the students better. As to school spirit, one quote will cover the situation. \Present day students lack the spirit of the student body of ten years ago. This cannot be wholly attributed to the higher age group. Too many students feel that cheer- ing the team is a child-like pro· cedure and gains them nothing in- dividually.

New Rules Sqtted The new rules being recommend- ed to tli.e Flaculty Council for final judgment are as follows: 1. That every student ma- triculated at Union College be permitted to participate fully in Section One (major). 2. That students who main- tain an index of 2.0 or better be permitted unrestricted par- ticipation in the field of extra- curricular activities. 3. That students with indices below 1.0 are ineligible to par- ticipate in the extra-curricular program. .

At Vassar Last Year Political Activity Mounts In Intensity on Campus A committee for the purpose of supporting Henry Wallace for President has been formed on the Union campus it was learned in a recent interview with Bruce Wallace (no rela- tion), a member of the committee. Possible affiliation with the \Students for Wallace\ a national campus organization, was also mentioned. The committee has no formal organiza- tion, per se, rather, interested and activated students will be members and formulate plans for having speakers, rallies, etc., as the campaign progresses. Things Are Poor At its meeting Monday night the Council expressed the feeling that all was\not well between the Chap lain and the college community and that something should be done.

The first conference was held at Vassar Col- lege, in 1947. At this m-eeting 28 colleges were represented by 105 delegates, of whom five gave papers in biological and psychological scienc-es, nine in physical sciences, and five in chentistry.

The recital. sponsored by the Genera:! Electric Company, will begin at &00 o'clack, Monday, the f5th of MarC'h. Some general admission tickets will be sold at the door. The price will be $1.80. It was felt that at no time since the dispute on campus began was Chaplain Br?wn given the oppor- tunity to express his views on the matter. We pl'esented him with a list of SIXteen questions per- taining to his actions and those of the administrative committee. He felt unable to gh'le some answers .and these we obtained from the president, including them in the editodal. It is hoped th.at this in· formation will afford the student a better idea of the other side and will ser~e as a supplement to the In· formation whi<'h wlll result from the open meeting held tonight in Old Cllapel.

I wish to acknowledt;e with appreciati~m receipt of your list of 16 questions pertaining to matters now uncer discussion on the Campus. I have read them with care and feel that they are relevant to the basic issues. I shall not atempt to answer all of them. Answers to some of them could best be given by other mem- bers of the college commw1ity. However, I am glad for the opportunity to make my position clear on certain basic issues, now undet· consldfration, In which your questions appear to be rooted. Th!'se issues a~ I lnk>rprct them arc as follows: what are- my views on morals, what have I said and done con- cerning standards on tile campus and what do I think of the function of the Chaplain to bE>? .My answer to the question, what are my views on murals must be preceded' by a statement con- cerning' the nature of man. I do not want to lift this question into the realm of the abstract, for you want a down to earth answer. But my answer would be of little value unless I put it into the framework of my own philosophy of life. Man, accor,ding to my undet·stanc'ing and belief, is one of the unfinished products of a purposeful, creative all fairness would at lEast advise the students universe. Inherent in man's nature is the divine of the committee's action. The point here is essence, the eternal spark, the holy center, the soul or the image of God, call it what you will.

This is what rect the error of poor pubhc relatrons m the Lao-tse meant, in his view that we must exemplify future. in ourselves the Tao, the law of the universe which One Solution Perhaps One of the important factors in this dis- pute has been the eagerness with which the students jumped on the administration. This is in the most part warranted, we feel. How- ever, we offer this alternative now that the jumping has had its effect: it is evident that the relations between both the President and Chaplain with the student body have been those between strangers; that for reasons of little time and personality, both have gained few of the campus sympathies. Both wish to spend more time in friendly, informal talks with the students, in order to know them as well as possible, and to hear their frank opin- ions. If the charges against the chaplain are unfounded we believe he should be given the opportunity to do his job with some real understanding from the students. This has never been forthcoming from any important student source on campus. The students can also aid by using their council more freely, and by using their own initiative and right to discuss any matter with the above officials or any other member of the administration. Lastly, it is hoped both factions will meet socially, informally in the future which may make the relationship something more stable than the suspicious, cold, and inefficient formality it has been until now. is also the law of man. This is what the Sufis meant, and the mystics like Meister Eckhart within the Christian tradition who, almst in the words of he Stoics spok~ of the soul as the Funklein Gottes, the \little spark of God:\ This view does not over-look the obvious. It recogn~zes that man is also animal who stands, temporarily, on the top rung of the ladder of bio- logical evolution. As animal he is driven to satisfy certain needs, one of which involves sex. Man, 'lpl- like other animals, has the unique task of co- ordinating his physical drives and impulses by bring- ing them under the control of his inner spiritual nature. The interrelationship and interaction be- tween man's spiritual and physical nature makes it impossible to separate the two aspects of his being without experiencing initer disunity, anxiety and the loss of creative power. . When spirit, mind, and body are focused and integrated each aspect of man's nature functions in the best interest of the whole being. This results in integration, wholeness, peace of mind and an inner sense of power. Each of our many drives may be thought of as a rank individualist. If each is allowed to express itself without reference to the other there is inner conflict and chaos. If each is coordinated into a working team you have an effec- tive unit capable of great achievements. My views on morals are implied in the above statement. With the creative center as master one can ,without repreSsion and 'without physiologic'al or psychological injury, bring his sex drives under the sway of his spiritual nature. This can come about by redirecting the attenti-on to values, purposes and goals which marshall all of one drives and poten- tialities, for effective living. One so organized ex- periences fewer inner tensions than those wl)o' fail to coordinate theiJ,• faculties. There are many levels of relationship; between the sexes. No one can clearly differentiate between the levels and label some good, some bad. Some patterns of relationships between the sexes enhance the respect of each for the other and contribute About 18 months ago the Interfraternity Council, drew up a series of rules concerning conditions to be main.tained in fraternity houses when .girls were present. These rules antici·pated the use of beer, the presence of chaperones, etc. It was expcted that they would be enforced tvom within. N<> one -in the administration wanted to play the vole ·Of a pol:ice- man. As far as I know no one has done so. Most of the fraternities, at one time or another, have .in- VJ·ted my wife and me to join the fun. We f·espon.ded to as many of such invitations as time permitted. We have enjoyed these affairs greatly. But it has been of some embar,rassment to us that in a few cases there was evidence of strong,er drinks th!l;n beer. Being present as guests and desiring to sh!lre the life of the party we did1 not wish to think of ourselves as representatives of the college, .but as friends. We could not forget, however, the r-egula- tions. The dilenuna was difficult. I attempted to re- solve it over and over again by suggesting that house presidents be invited in for consultation in the hope that through f1•iendly consultation the slack would be taken up. Mter a recent discussion with another member of the administrative staff he agreed to pro- pose au evaluation of house party experience. The pvoposal was made and five people, including my- self, sat in on the discussion. I hoped that the dis- cussion would lead to an invitation to house presi• dents to attend a con:ference. The actual decision, however, is familiar history. The Chaplalh of a col- lege is not a disci,plinary officer and does not want to be a moral censor. My chief interest in, the :mat- tel' was to help to create a condition favorable to helping me-n live up to their agreement. By li\vlhg up to an agreement, spoken or written, one main- tains the lntegl'ity of his own spirit. Last fall the President of Green Mountain Junior College asked me if I would visit the college to give a talk on relationships between me nand woxnen. (\An expert is an ordinary guy away from home.\) I went up late in January or early February. I went not as a representative of the college but on my own. · I have some reliable information concerning con- ditions in Colleges in various parts of the colllltry. The over all pictw·e leaves much to be desired :from thE' point of view of the liberal not to mention the conservative. I was told that they wanted a frank, down to earth talk designed to be of as n::nich practical help as possible. My talk consisted prin- cipally of an analysis of some of the findings O<:f the Kinsey report. I reminded them that American men are inclined to idealize marriage, home, children, parenthood, but tllat lh my judgment the means followed by some in dating and courtship would probably make the ends difficult of att~inment. I have consulted my extensive notes on the talk and find no evidence that I said there was promiscuity at college house parties. I did, however, advise im- matnre girls, who a1·e unsure of themselves, and wlto feel that they need special attention from meal. to prop up a Sa.gging ego, to refrain from attending college house parties, including those at Union. I think most of the men in the college. will agree that such girls are ill-equipped to handle themselves with much confidence Gr poise at a college house party. If any men at the college resent my rexnaJ-ks at Green Mountain they should remember that I did not have Un.ion specifically in mind and that the talk was made for the purpose of being of the greatest possible help to girls who hear all too few practical talks about such matters. I do not know what a Union alumnus said in Pittsburglh for I have not talked with him since read·ing a report of his talk in a mimeographed paper which was in circulation last wek. I don't understand how he could have given this impression of wide spread pro~iscuity at Union College. I lmow of only one Isolated case and info1>mation about it was given by a member of the house In- volved who wanted advice. This information was never officially reported to the administration. ~en I was invited to oome to Union by Dr. President Davidson Clarifies Chaplain's Duties at Union ~~e~t~/~~~~i~~t:ei! ~~~~iag~u~l~dr~~ii~~!h~~~;%~: tion ~or a rich and mutually satisfying family life. I bel!eve that those who are continent before mar- riage generally find greater· satisfaction and hap- piness in marriage than those who are not. How- ever, I have not statistics to support my belief. Whttaker, who was then acting as President he ~old me that he wanted me to study the reli~lous mterests and needs of students and worlt out a pro- gram. The pro~am has evolved slowly. We llire still in tl1e expen:mental stage. As a rPsult of unu8ual empha8is on religious and mural b~w·\ dtll ing tht' past few weeks, there has hf'Pn \'ir,!Pnt di\<cus;;ion of the function of the chap- lain al t:nion. I fl'Pl that some explanation is due to th<\ studl'nt~ of what tlw cull,·~c ttustees and ad- ministration hditove a chaplain Hhould do here. l:nion Col!rog\ is a non-scc·ctrian institution of high0r It arning, ont' of the first so egtablished in America. As such, it is op(·n to qualified men of all faiths and undNtakPs to meet the educational, voca- tional. physical. m01al. and spiritual needs of all its 8tudPnts. One fR<'t is elear about the <'haplain in such a coill'ge-he do!'s not dPsir!' to prosPIY!e. He does not wish to change th<' faith or ri'Iigiotls affiliations of any man; Pach student, rPgardlcss of his religious position, Rhonld hf' helped to grow in terms of the religious convictions which the student holds valid. The <'haplain wants no program of \sawdust trail\ evangelism. Another area is also foreign to the chaplain-he is not a disciplinary officer. Studl?nts discipline at Union Is in the hands of a committee consisting of three students, th<' Dean, and the President. The ordinary routinPs of discipline arP handled through the Dean's office. Th!' cllaplain never imposes penal- ties, nor does he wish to sen·e as a \moral policeman\ or \1fsciplinary detective.\ There arl', as I see it, four areas in which a chap- lain can be of real service to students and the college as a whole: (1) His fundion is to teach courses in the field of l't'ligion-Comparative Religion, the Judaeo- Christian Ethic, the Bible, the Philosophy of Religion. All such courses should be electives at Union (de- nominational colleg-es have a perfect right to require [hem), and should be taught as objectively as possi- ble, using all the materials of modern scholarship. fn a college curriculum, as in the life of our nation and the communities. religion is such an important area that, like Economics or History, it cannot be omitted. (2) Ws function is to al'l'ange for non-sectarian sel'Vices of worship In our beautiful college chapel, \'hich was erected with such set'Vices in mind. Stud:nt attendance at such services is not mandatory, but 1s encouraged. The chaplain presides at such services on Sundays, speaks occasionally himself, and invites outstanding representatives of Judaism and Christianity to preach. In my opinion, the quality of our Sunday services, helped by an excellent student choir, has been very high. (3) His function is to be available as a personal counselor to students, on any matters they wish to bl'ing to him. Such conversations are, of course absolutely confidential. If they were not thei~ effectiveness would be spoiled. That they ar~ effec- tive is evidenced to me by the hundreds of such con- sultations which have taken place. The chaplain never reports such matters to .the dean or president; the student need have no fear of disciplinary action. Naturally the chaplain does gain general impressions of campus life, on which he occasionally advises students, but he is prevented by his professional ethics from naming names, times, and places. His function is the positive encouragement of spiritual growth, not the n~gative or \Puritanic\ condemnation of sinful man. ( 4) His function is to serve as adviser (if invited) a~d coordinator of student groups desiring religious discussion and expression, or wishing to develop sen·- ice projects to help meet the needs of the larger community: Occasion_ally he may be embarrassed by the excessiVe enthusiasm or questionable taste of such groups, but he can only advise-he is not the organizer and pro1noter. A chaplain, :whether Catholic Protestant or Jewi?h•. will as. an ordained m~nist~r naturally have conviCtiOns wh1ch he cannot m conscience violate and on which his vows will not allow him to remai~ silent. These areas would seem to offer plenty of work t? a chB;plain, an~ they seem to me needed in a college hke Umon. I bel1eve our chaplain has tried sincerely to give of his best in all these fields. Carter Davidson The movies, magazines and modern literature place an uncalled-for accent on sex. The mores that govern relationships between the sexes today are considerably freer than those which were in effect a few years ago. I doubt if the freedom is leading to the emancipation of the mind from pre- occuation with sex. If the Puritans erred in damm- ing sex, it is possible that we have erred in making it such an important factor in our 'daily mental diet. The IUnsey repot·t shows that the incidence of premarital experiences is higher among people who do not go to college than college trained people. Perhaps college men and women who are draWn toward a significant life goal will help to develop new mores that will be an improvement over re- pressive Puritan morality on the one hand and onr present accepted standards on the other. . Even if the Kinsey report concerning the in- Cid~nce of prerr:-arital sex experience among collegte tarmed people IS correct, I doubt if many such ex- periences take place on college campuses. On the ?ther hand some patterns of sex play which do not mvolve \going the limit\ may not prove to be mut:rally beneficial when evaluated for their physi- ologiCal, psychologieal and spiritual effects. You ask about my views on drinking. The use of alcohol as I see it is not bad in itself. The danger in the excessive use of alcohol is obvious to every- one. People who do not drink should not make others WlCo'mfortable. N eithet· should people who like their \beer\ create an atmosphel'l~ In which the nim-dl'inker feels left out of things. Many people can have a wonderful time at a party without the help of alcohol in any fm·m. I hope this continues to be true and that drinking does not become one of the s.ocla;I \musts.\ There are people who would be happ1er if they had never talten their first drink. Those who understand the power ·Of example will want. to consider their influence upon younger men. Not everyone on the campus is a seasoned veteran. The Chaplain of £!ni.on or any other college should ~ave hrs own conviCtions abo1,1t religious matters, JUSt as other men. But he\'respects the convictions of ~thers and trusts that that respect is reciprocated. WJ:t!le from the philosophic point .of view some re- hgwus .co~victions possess greater validity than othe.rs rt 1s my hope, which has. been partially realiZed at least, to _help men grow into a de~per-· uuderstandmg of theu own religlious tradition.

NUSBAUM'S 3 \~oo~!~s~nds_· __, Bigger and Bl'tter Awa1•ds Now that the Student Affairs and Relations Committee has offi· clally okayed the prop0sed award system as requested by the Block \U\ Society I feel thD:t there is one smai! item that could still bear some investigation. Under the old athletic award system aU managers and team captains received Hfe passes to all athletic even-t, at Union. This is a small gesture on the part of the administration to show its appreciation for the serv- ices rendered by these men while they were in school. I think that this plan i:; fine as far as it goes, but it is inadequate. Why limit the distribution of these· passes to just the manager,s and the team capta·ins. Do the team members themselves put in any less time in their particular sport than these other men do. I cannot believe this last. Certainly the team members expend just as nmch blood, sweat and tears as do their industrious managers. I understand that this little item is .on the agenda for consideration. by the Student Affairs Committee at its next meeting. Just don't overlook it gentlemen. Sport Sh.orts Coach Ray Mullane, Union's swimming mentor would like all the men who are interested in tak- ing Senior Life Saving Comses or Water Safety Instructor Courses to leave their names in the gym- nasium office.

This information will be necessary for the planning of classe:;; for those men who want to be pre- pared to take water safety jobs this coming summer. * * At a recent meeting of the hockey squad, Rufe Burlingame was elected captain of the 1948-49 Garnet hockey squad. Burlingame, a junior, served as center on this season's hockey team. * * Spring track practice started this week in the Alumni Gymnasium. Practices are being held, starting next week, every Monday, Wednes- day, and Friday afternoon at 3 P.M. * * It was moved, seconded, and car- ried by the Student Affairs Com- mittee on Wednesday that students enrolled in the College of Phar- macy, part of Union University, aze eligible to compete in our athletic program, if certified as eligible by that school. .J ARE YOU On Wrestling and Boxlng With the renewal of intramural boxing and wrestling a very inter· esting possibility comes to my mind. I cannot see why boxing and wrestling do not offer a defi- nite possibility for introduction into the regular intercollegiate schedule of sports at Union. This is of .course a long range sugges- ticm, hut I think that it is one sug- gestion that the administration might give very serious considera- tion. As t·o the added financial burden, initial pquipment for a boxing and wt·r>stling \'llln<i would in my esti- mation he a nPgligible item. Of t·ourse a l'oach for the new enter- prise might pnsP somethi.ng of a proh!Pm. Possibly we have a mem· her of our pre5ent athletic staff who could handle the assignment of being mentor for the pugilists. There must certainly be some talent along these lines on the campus. I am convinced of this after watching some of the match- es held in the gym during the intramural competition. Boxing and wrestling are two sports which are especially suit- able for small college competition. Cornell College of Iowa, a college about half the size of Union has reputedly the best wrestling team in intercollegiate competition In the United States. This would cer- tainly verify the plausibility of in- troducing boxing and wrestling into the small college budget. All that is lacking at Union is a concerted drive by the students to put the new sport across. Prexy is definitely interested in the possi- bilities offered by the new sport. r would he very interested to hear tny comments members of the stu·· dent body might want to express along these lines. If we want to see boxing and wrestling intro- duced into the athletic schedule here at Union then let's do some- thing about it. * * * Block \U\ Banquet Big plans are underway for the Block \U\ banquet scheduled for next month. Plans are for the gala affair feting the athletes are under the chairmanship of B!ll Grant and Dick Roberts. Guest speakers for the evening will include Tuss McLaughry, pres- ent coach at Dartmouth, who coached the College All-Stars to their 16-0 victory over the Bears last year, and Jack Lavalle, scout for both Notre Dame and theN. Y. Giants. Lavalle has not missed an Army football game in three years. Movies of the Columbia-Army foot- ball game will be shown. From all indications the athletes are In for a real evening of pleasure. ,. UNAWARE Of UNDERWEAR?

The best pa1>t of these contests Is that in three of the four categories, the idea is all that you have to submit. Wviting ability and style are unnecessary. Wide Va.riety Deadlines Set Backed ·by State Group This club has the endorsement of the New York State Young Repub- Hcan Club as well as being finan- cially ·aided by that group. It is also .planned to have speakers rep- resenting the opposition so that by debate the points will become more clear. The Young GOP group is not openly supporting any one Re- publican candidate, .but following the convention in June it is ex- pected that the group will suppo!!t the nominated candidate and cam- paign in his behalf here at the college. Interest Needed The Idol contest covers all the possible methods of literary expression: poetry, short stories, essays, editorials, and sketches. The material submitted will be judged by Union Col- lege faculty metnbers, and the author of any pparticular piece wlll be unknown until after the awards have been made. Each piece of work is to be submitted under a pen name, with the author's real name In an envelope with the pseudonym on the outside, included. If, in the opinion of the judges, one entry is overwhelming- ly superior, the entire sum may be awarded to one entry, otherwise, awards of sums of not less than $100 will be allotted as the judges decide. (This Is your chance to make any of the judges pay for flunking you in one of their courses. All you have to do is write the best entry. Can't you see his face when he finds out he gave YOU $1000!!!) Other Opportunities Writers Talent Scout, Inc. was established to promote the procurement of new writing talent Remember, if you don't win a prize your entry may be sold anyway, and you'll receive royalties. Before you send that short story away, though, enter it in the Idol Contest. These awards are set up to develop literary ability at Union, and material must be submitted if the awards are to be continued in the future. Deadline for the Idol is April 19, 1948; for the Writers Talent Scout, May 31, 1948.

There are three D.C. dynamos, among the first which were produced: by the Edison Elec- tric Co., forerunner of the G.E., and one has a patent date of 1882 on it. These machines were brought to the department when it was first organized in 1895.

When the kids down the block began picking on the kids in his :neighborhood, the fellow got pretty mad. He was a pretty big guy and he gathered all of the kids he liked around him and they went down the block and he bought .some boxing gloves and they kicked hell out of the kids that were making aH the trouble.

Therefore, the new group has decided that supreme authority in the club will rest witil one man, the Chairman, who will remain in office until he can talk someone else into taking over for him. The by-laws make it possible for almost anyone to join the Pub- lications Club, the only limitation being that the member must sup- ply his own beer and cigarettes at each meeting and that he must supply a small sum of money which will go into a pool from which beer and cigarettes will be bought for speakers and guests. In the organizational meeting it was also decided that to avoid con- fusion, meetings would be held wherever and whenever those members of the club present de- cide that a meeting shall be held.

Five Student Council members will be elected from each class. ----------------------------~ 15 Seek Scot Scholarship President Davidson has an- nounced the names of fifteen men being considered for selection for the St. Andrews Exchange Scholarship. The plan provides for the ex- change of one student in his junior year with St. Andrews University in Scotland . The exchange was founded in 1935 under President Dixon Ryan Fox, and continued until 1941, when it was interrupted by the war. Last year the scholarship was resumed when William Warner was selected as the St. Andrews scholar and Anthony J. Easterbrook came here. St. Andrews, the oldest university in Scotland, was founded in 1413. The following students were named as candidates for the scholarship: Edward Layden, Mitchell Rabbino, E. Arthur Kean, Wright Scidmore, Lionel Furst, Richard Hall, William Hauke, George Jamieson, Adolph Kunkel, Erich Loewy, James Nelson, Ralph Reed, James Rosen, Thomas Strong and Robert Walker. The scholarship provides free room and board for the exchange student, who pays his normal tui- tion to his own college. The stu- dent arranges his program to .'lt into his curriculum and receives full credit for the year spent abroad. Open only to sophomores with a 4.0 index or higher, engi- neering students ·are ineligible for the exchange because St. Andrews has no engineering curriculum. Family men also are ineligible as only dorm facilities are available there. A committee composed of the President of the Student Council, Tony Easterbrook, Prof. John Lewis, St. Andrews Exchange Scholar in 1939-40, the President and the Dean will examine the records of the group and select three or four top men. These students will then be called before the committee for an interview. On the basis of the interview, the committee will decide which man will best represent Union College at St. Andrews University and profit most from the opportunity. Procedure Change The nomination of candidates for this election will proceed in a slightly different manner than in previous years. In order to receive a place on the ballot, each candi- date must submit to the Student Activities Office, on or before March 31, his name, the office he is seeking, a list of his college ac- tivities, his campaign manager, and fifteen supporting signatures from members of his class. During the week of April 12, following Spring Vacation, daily chapel programs will be conducted by the Student Council, in which each campaign manager will make a short address introducing his candidate and de- scribing the latter's college activi- ties. Following this introduction, the candidate will make a bow to the audience but will n,ot speak. It is hoped that this innovation will help to familiarize the student voters with the various candidates and encourage increased participa- tion in the election. Balloting on April 20 and 21 will be held at llanna Hall. Voting machines will be used to choose Council members, but paper ballots · will serve in electing class presi- dents. Advertising Invited A candidate may run for both Student Council representative and class prrsident. If elected to both offices, however, the candidate must accept the office of class p r e s i d e n t which automatically gives him a seat in the Council. The candidate with the next high- est number of votes will receive the vacant Council place. Those candidates who wish. to advertise their campaign are in- vited to do so through the Con- cordiensis and WRUC, the College radio station.

Union College by the Chi Psi fra- ternity and is under consideration by other fraternities. Under this plan, the Bowdoin Plan, selected foreign students are subsidized by any group on campus and the col- lege provides the tuition from un- . used scholarships. Need For Plan The plan was first proposed by members of the Chi Psi fraternity of Bowdoin College, who were alarmed at the rate at which the number ·Of foreign students has dropped in comparison to last year (about 40%). The necessity for the plan was emphasized by a State Depattment announcement which reported an enrollment of 18,000 foreign students instead of the ex- pected 50,000 in American colleges. This number is expected to drop to around 5,000 due to the high cost quirements for admission for most of living in the United States and colleges.

The form of this gift has not yet the Editor been decided upon by the Council, thPrefore, I should like to venture a suggestion, with all due regard to the members of that body. It might be a sound idea if therP were two <2) types of awards given, rather thnn the one now being planned. The awards would be much more appreciated if they were useful objects which the recipients could use in whatever profcsshm tlwy launch upon after graduation. ThcreforP. I ~u~gest that one type take the form of a pr neil eharpener, built in a miniature, gold replica of the Idol, for each man in the Senior Class who ha~ 'urmount- ed all of the obstacles put befo1 e him, by the college faculty, during his memlH'rship here at Union. I suggest that the second type award be the most modern style Cadillac cr,nvcrtible, able to be obtained at the time of graduation. for the Seniors who have found it in their ability to not only equal the performance CJf t!-.eir fellow- graduates, but also to talte an activ<>, elevating part in every extra-curricular otganization, of any import, on campus. While everyone is in an awatd·giYing mood, may I further suggest that all nwmhers of the student body be given an eight by t<'n garnet colored blanket, each inscribed wilh the man's respective name and class year, done in appropri- ate grey. This award would discomage the present tendency of holding Fraternity House Parties and would encourage all our f;ustrated souls to bring \SEX\ out into the open where they can, \prepare themselves to get the most out of it\.

Away Intramural Jottings Intramural basketball and volley- ball closed las week with the championship frays being held in the Alumni Gymnasium. Top honors in the basketball circuit went to the Black Fleet, an inde- pendent group that earlier cap- tured the National League title. Vieing for the top berth in the American League were Kappa Nu, Beta Theta Phi, and Alpha Delta Phi, but Kappa Nu edg~ed out the aggressive Beta squad in the play- off only to succumb to the Black Fleet 44-25 in the final. Koualczayk was high scorer for the winners with 10 points, and Scheier and H. Strauss shared top honors for the losers with six tallies each. In the volleyball championship, the Beta team outdid the Phi Gam squad to take the first position for the second consecutive year. The Eastern League finals ended with Delta Phi, Sigma Chi, and Beta Theta Phi tied for first place, but the Betas quicltly eliminated the -others in the playoffs. In the finals, the Betas took three of the four sets 15-11, 15-6, and 15-9.

In a quiet, w-ell organized and impressive pro- gram under the auspices of the Student Council, Director of Ath- letics for the College J. Harold Wittner presented awards to the participants in each of the above named sports. At the end of the program natty cheerleaders led the student body in an enthusiastic cheer of appreciation. So stirring was this ceremony that I was al- most moved to tears, as were many other members of the student body --Yeh!!! tears of disgust. Yesterday's chapel -program was undoubtedly the biggest \faux pas\ ever pulled by any organization before the student body_ Ostensibly the whole hodge-podge was a prod- uct of the Student Council. When I asked AI Hill about this little matter he said that the Block \U\ Society was responsible for the program. Upon questioning mem- bet·s of the Society, I found that they wei'e laying all the blame with the Department of Athletics and poor old Hal Wittner. \Button button, who got the button?\ Any athlete desiring his letter can pick it up at Hale House some noon- time. Bill' South thinks it might draw a crowd. That's what I call real organization! To begin with the whole mess was late in starting. Hal Wittner's timepiece was five minutes slow. The student body managed to amuse itself during the interim by watching the antics of two very clever dogs who ran capriciously up and down the aisles of the chapel. During the prolonged reading of the usual humdrum announce- ments Mr. Wittner slipped in quiet- ly and took a seat behind AI Hill 'vho \\as reading the announce- ments. The president of the Stu- dent Council was unaware of this little by-play until he turned around and discovered that Hal had been there \all the time\. After this bit of comedy it was an- nounced that the purpose of this particular chapel program was to make athletic awards. This came as a complete surprise to the audi- ences which was by this time pre- pared for anything. To continue my narrative, Hal got up and dramatically read off a iist of names, inhn·pesed with some brilliant repartee of his own. of-fact listing, the men who were of-fact listeni-ng, the men who were ·to receive the awards straggled to the front of the chapel from wher- ever they had happened to be sit- ting, whi-le the students clapped and the dogs barked and general pandemonium reigned. Thei'e was a slight interruption in the festivities at this point while Jack Tway sent out a general alarm for a cheerleader. Jim Lan- dry was among the missing; so Ken Dean was called upon. Look- ing very sharp in a beautiful naval officer's topcoat, Kenny led the stu- dent body in a clever and original cheer-fifteen \rahs\ for the team. Everyone had their shoes off try- ing to count to fifteen; so the cheer rather fizzed out. In the mad rush for the exits, which procedure seems to have be- come the traditional ending for all chapel programs at Union College, Hal Wittner tried to make an an- nouncement about the Block \U'' banquet. He wasn't sure, but he thought the banquet was to be held the 17th of next month. In any event, \Jack Lavalle is a hell of a good story teller.\ Don't miss it boys. He'll have you in the aisles. This officially closed the chapel program for March 18th, in the year of Our Lord 1948, and the student body staggered dazedly out into the bi'illiant sunshine, not quite sure if what it had just seen (Continued on Page 4) Multiply your savings for Easter finery or fun-by going Grey. hound.

Surveys Colleges A guest of the college, Avirett's visit here was a stop in a program of survey tours from which he is gathering information regarding in- dividual colleges, as well as getting a cross-sectional picture of the Am- erican eollege seene. Arriving on the campus Monday, Avir·ett's first official meeting was with the Pub- lications Club at 8 p.m. In a very informal atmosphere of beer and questions Avirett met with staff members of the Concordiens.is, Idol, Public Relations Office- and other publication-rn!nde<;l students and guests. His greatest concern was the manner in which the \Chaplain- morals\ issue was covered by the Union press. After a thorough dis- cussion of all points the topic changed to the international scene. Avir-ett queried the students as to the imminence of war with Russia· and the question of its inevitabil- ity; this topic kept the group busy for another hour and •a half. Speaks to Student Body In Tuesday Chapel, the Tribune editor hastily covered the broad topic, \A Good Press.\ By \A Good Press,~ Avirett explained that he meant the overall outlook and meaning of the term press. Citing figures on college enrollment and predictions he described the higher educational scene in America through 1950. It was Avirett's hope that the small college, Union, Am- herst and the like, would continue the \quality job,\ by seeing to it that their men were endowed with an education and not just training that might enable them to build the \better mousetrap.\ A member of the Amherst chap- ter of Alpha Delta Phi, Avirett lunched at the Alpha Delt House on Tuesday and later met with the faculty where a discussion of edu- cational public relations problems ensued.

This action followed a very heated and lengthy debate, which concerned the merits and \in- equalities\ of the system. Confusion, Littlt• Information The Publications· Cuts created much confused and partisan dis- cussion after a motion from the Board of Managers had been made: it was moved that the top three men from all activities whose revenue from the Student Tax Committee excet:d $:)00 sh<mld re- ceive a rebate of the tax fund. re- troactive from February 1948. Such a move, it was reported, would compensate for the \hard work and long hours\ spent in extra-curricu- lar work. in Yiew of the fact that members of the Publications were said to \cash in on the gravy train\. The College Band, WRUC, the Glee Club and the Mountebanks were among the activities repre- sented at the meeting and who voiced their disapproval of the cut system in any manner, shape or form. This dissension manifested itself in the form of a motion from B. T. McGivern to abolish the cut system. But the discussion which followed indicated that much in- formation in regards to the history and origin of the Cut system was lacking. A member of the Pub- liCations' Board present at the meeting attempted to present some of the previously hidden facts con- cerning the establishment of the monetary awards instituted by Dean C. F. F. Garis in the early thirties. McGivern's motion was defeated, and in order to bring to light all of the facts in this dispute a com- mittee of five men was appointed to make a thorough investigation; Robert Heidell was chosen chair- man to be assisted by James Hoge- boom, Clark N.

At long last, WRUC has gotten its plans for a Radio Drama Woi'lt- shop out of the realm of pt·obabil- ity and into a concrete working model. For the past three or four weeks the Workshop has been hard at work going through possible scripts for production over WRUC and has been giving auditions to the many students that have re- sponded to the requests for talent made over the Radio Station. Students Direct The workshop is worlting under Charles Rourke, George Hendon and William Reeder who have spent a considerable amount of time in setting up and directing this section of the Program De- partment. The Faculty Moderator is Professor Buren C. Robbins of the English Department who has had his Script Writing Class work- ing on this priject. The .first producing, will be \Gramp's in the Balcony\ and is expected to be ready for broadcast in a few weeks. The group is in need of more experienced actors and scriptwriters. Those interested in this work should contact Charles Rourke at WRUC or at the Psi U House. Also wanted by the Work- shop1 are any scripts that students may have written.

Now it was the time to get baek to the old· routine, but as one might susp·ect, buii sessions began to form in the rooms of Old North Hall. There were six men, however, who had definite business to per- form. Two of them, Robert Mor1'i-. son and John McMillan Wilson, early in the fall, had formulated a plan and after drue consideration,· enlisted the aid of four fellow students. These were Robert· Thomson Drake, John Wolfe Lindley, Ardivan Walker Rogers and Andrew Watts Rogers. At this time they pledged themselves to keep their meeting secret. The next three days saw their plans com- pleted. The year was 1848. The place-Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. The purpose· of the meetings was to form a brotherhood based on the highest ideals of mankind. And so, this year, men ail over the world are celebrating! the 100th anniVersary of the founding of Phi Delta Theta. Campaign Managers to Feature Coming Elections for Council and Class Officers Students were aroused from their customary Chapel slumber by the appearance of the band in Chapel Thursday with Miss Marion Mahl, 5'9\ blond songstress.

At long last, WRUC has gotten its plans for a Radio Drama Work• shop out of the realm of probabil· ity and into a concrete working model. For the past three or four weeks the Workshop has been hard at work going through possible scripts for production over WRUC and has been giving auditions to the many students that have re- sponded to the requests for talent made over the Radio Station. Students Direct The workshop is working under Charles Rourke, George Hendon and William Reeder who have spent a considerable amount of time in setting up and directing this section of the Program De- partment. The Faculty ModeratO!' is Professor Buren C. Robbins of the English Department who has had his Script Writing Class work- ing on this priject. The .first producing, will be \Gramp's in the Balcony\ and Is expected to be ready for broadcast in a few weeks. The group is in need of more experienced actors and scriptwriters. Those interested in this work should contact Charles Rourke at WRUC ot· at the Psi U House. Also wanted by the Work· shop, are any scripts that students may have written.

The third offering, Besler's \The Barretts of Wlmpole Street.\ was by far, the best of the lot. With the exception of Martin Gersten, who played Robert Browning, the whoiP cast was several cuts above the amateurish. John Sargent. as Barrett, gave a professional per- formance. We do not know Mr. Sargent, bill we do know that he is no amateur actor. Particular praise must be be- stowed on the settings of all three plays, but particularly the last. To return to the plai~s: this busi- ness of cuttin!\ is more or less a doubtful business. I could not be sure. as I watched, whethei: I was following the cut version, or supplying material from what I remember .of the fuiJ versions. I am in no position to judge the cut plays in themselves. In summation, as Demosthenes lised to say, we saw three amateur plays, none wholly good, none wholly bad; we saw a mess of acting students and a few stu- dent .actors; we saw not-too-ad- mirable work done unc.·er a wholly admirable program.

Warm words of commendation are due the thre-e producers. We admit e their bravery. Cutting rr full len~th play down to one act is a frightening business in itself, but add! the tortures of directing, the pains of casting, and the madden- ing proble.ms of design and set construction, and we have a minor nightmare.

The Dutchmen had chopped this lead down consid-erably by half- time when Mohawk led 34-41. Early in the second half a field goal by Schultz and a conversion by Markes tied up the game 44-44. From then on, it was gravy for Union. April WeslE'yan Romps Wesleyan College skimmed over the tired Garnet in the next fray of the season, easily taking the game 68-50. The invaders displayed a smooth working squad that eas- ily won, despite top scoring honors for the evening going to Jim Pem- ric}!: with 22 points. The Garnet scored first in the opening seconds but the Wesleyan powerhouse soon started and the Garnet was out of the running during the remainder of the contest. After a four~game losing streak, the Garnet culminated its mid- winter slump by scoring an im- pressive 72-56 win over the Con- tinentals of Hamilton in the Alum- ni Gym. The Dutchmen got off to a slow start in the first half of the contest, but came back in the third to stage the biggest quarter of the season, racking up 2B points to Hamilton's six. Drop Middlebury The Middlebury game in vermont brought the season to a 5-5 mark by Union's victory 72-46. At the end or the first period, the Garnet was behind 16-11. However, the final three stanzas were a Union landslide. Half-time saw Union in front 31-24. The lead was in- creased to 48-29 at the end of the third. Upset R./P.I. Jim Schultz walked away with a big 25 points under his belt in the R.P.I. upset which Union took 63-58. As usual when Union plays R.P.I., this was an excellent and hard-fought battle from the spec- tators points of view. At one time in the first stanza, the Engineers were out in front 11-4. The Dutch- men hacked down this lead to 17-13 as the first quarter closed. At half- time, Union was leading 3G-25.

With three minutes left in the fourth, Union was b-ehind 49-45, but in a last minute spurt, successive shots by Pemrick, Schultz, and O'Neil produced the mf+rgin of v:ictory for the Dutchmen. Pemrick and Rob- erts each had 13 points. In the final game of the season in the \jinx\ Troy Armory, the Garnet lost 59-48 to the Engineers of R.P.I. The height of the Cherry and White under the baskets told the story. Bartlett and Markes played their last game for Union in this contest. Union defiinitely wasn't ''on\ in this game and never saw the lead except at a point in the first when they led 8-7. At hHif-time the Garnet trailed 25-17.

Schultz tallied for 157 points and a game average of 9.8125. The center slot was held down by Tim Shea and Bill O'Neil. Both did yeoman service for the hoop- sters and their height was vital in several games in the bucket position and getting the ball off the backboards. Dick Roberts and \Whitey\ Markes held back the opposing waves in the guard spots for Union. Both were veterans of last year's team and sparked both the defense and offens-e at many times. The 1948-49 Garnet hoopsters hav:e bright prospects. The only regular players that will be missing next year are Markes and Bob Bartlett. The hoopsters will miss these two men who have done stellar service throughout this season.
