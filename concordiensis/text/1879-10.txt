,, p d I ' 8 THE CONCORDlENSJS. A MYST'ERY SOLVED. ()ccasionally a notice appears on the bul- letin board announcing a rrleeting of \ The Theological Society_.\ The Freshman sees it and \vith surprise and reverential awe turns a \vay thinking that there is sotnevvhere on Union's grounds a cotnpany of sober-sided, dignified, long-headed Seniors, and, possibly, ] uniors, \vho have banded themselves togeth- er to search into the n1ysteries of revelation. The Sophon1ore reads it until he comes to the \vord \'Theological then retnem bering that he has seen it before, but knows nothing of its n1eaning here, passes on, thinking that tteology is the last thing to occupy the mind of a true Sop horn ore. The Junior and Senior see it but have long ago cotne to the conclu- sion that the \ Theologues\ are a secluded, unkno\vable cro\vcl and the society is the n1ost secret in the college, for during their stay they have not learned \vhen it \vas establish- ed, \vhere it meets, ho\v it is conducted, or for what it exists. And so the n1ystery retnains unsolved. Not, ho\vever, unsolvable. Every college in the country has, or ought to have, a Christian association. Union has none. The 'fheological Society, ho\vever, takes its place, and is in reality the same thing, and does its \vork. The tr1ystery, then, is solved, this is the Theological Society, and this is its \vork. '' ()nly this and nothing \ more. It was established years ago and its pri- Its name confounds the Freshrnan, fright- ens the Sophomore, convicts the Junior and shames the Senior; but this need be so no longer. Respect for its age and its old n1.en1- bers is, perhaps, the only reason that its name is not changed. Let all remember, however, that it is simply the Christian asso- ciation of lJ nion College and that this is all it claims to be. l\1eetings are held on call only, generally in the prayer roon1 and atter the prayer meeting, and are called only when there is busi11ess to transact. All Christians in the college who are will- ing to do anything for the ad vancetn ent of religion are invited to join, no matter of what class or society. 1\Ioreover, every Christian student ought to connect hrmself \Vith the as- sociation and in this way, if he will not in any other, ackno\vledge his al~egiance to Christ. J 'rHE ADELPHIC Society has again rene\ved mary object was to discuss theological ques- tions ; but no\v besides the secret societies, there are two other societies for debating questions of all. kinds, and as most of the \Theologues\ belong- to one or the other of these, a third seen1s to be unnecessary. Thete- fore, the Theological Society has been al- lo\ved to abandon all literary work. It does exist, however, but now, as said above, sim- ply as a Christian associaticn. As such it is gaining tttan y ne\V n1em bers and is in a pros- its -vveekly n1eetings. Unusual activity is tnanifested this tertn by all. Although the Society lost many prominent n1em bers by the graduation of '79, yet the interest in the \vork is not diminished. Their spirit see111s to rest on those who are left. ;\lread y a large nun1ber of ne\v members have been initiated. 1'he n1ost promising feature of the Society is the interest tnanifested in the library. The shelves are not filled -vvith Patent Office reports and books \Vhose only · value is in the n1aterial of which they are cornposed, but \vith the works of the best authors. A catalogue of the n1embers of the Society since its institution in 1797 has been published in pan1phlet form. It shO\VS a to- tal membership of nineteen hundred and eight.

THE CONC~ORD!ENSIS. 9 WE WOULD like to say a \vord about the 1 their part in the struggle, n1ost en1phatically Idol. This object, interesting to us as indic- retract any staten1ent depreciating the pluck ative of a rude civilization that existed cen- of '8 3. •' ,• turies ago in a retnote corner of the \Vorld, has recently been decorated in a n1ost becoln- ing n1a11ner. 'fitne, money and labor have been expended upon it, in order to .m,ake it as it now stands a fitting ornan1ent to the College Park. ''l e regret to see that certain persons have already scribbied thei• narnes upon its time-\vorn back, and other sz';nilar trash. Don't do so any n1ore, \Ve beg of you. Recollect that the Idol is an object of rualue to the antiquarian, the ethnologist and the student of history, \vhile, at the same tin1e, it 1s interesting to us as con1ing fron1 a buried city recently unearthed in a far-distant land. It has passed through epochs of a nation's history of \V hich no records exist and of \vhich not one liying soul to-day kno\veth one jot or tittle. It is a 1nonun1ent of a departed and n1ysterious age-a binding link bet\veen the past and the present. vV e comn1end it to your earnest and thoughtful study, and trust, if it excites no interest in you, that you \vill at least preserve It for others, -vv ho do care for it and vvho \vill profit by the lesson~_ it silently teaches and by the problems of history it so aptly suggests. AFTER \VE had gone to press the rush can1e off. It is not necessary for us to give any long account of it, as it has been very, if not too n1uch discussed in the daily papers. It ren1ains only for us to say that it was very closely contested, lasting over twice as long .;; as any previous rush for several years. The Freshmen fought bravely, though the Sopho- mores finally got possession of the cane by carrying it down town and hurriedly putting it in a secret place. It is to be hoped that before the next rush son1e regulations may be adopted and the Freshmen know the goal, ~~: -.>: vVhile our vievvs on the rush in general re- i~ r- main as in another editorial, vVe il1USt, fro1n ··~:H =-======:'::::::::: - ------ __ -_ -- ======::--:-=-===== LOCAL. -'82 has three new men1bers. -\Vho is the black horse in '82? -vVhen \vill the library be open? -Freshn1en, \i\rhere is your foot ball? -Not n1uch enthusiasn1 yet over base ball. -· '83 has a representative from Stng Sing. -All the Senior elections were carried by a vote ot r6 to I o. -Van \V agenen and \Fan Buren from Am- herst have entered '~2. -''Some Freshn1en cant carry canes even the third term.\-Soph. -Fan1iliar sight on the carnpus and in the co\v pasture--Engineers. -\lt I \van ted to carry a cane I'd carry one any \vay. \-Freshman. -Rope rr1atting has been put on the chap- el ffoor.
