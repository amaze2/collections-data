COURTESY IN COLLEGE MEN The return to normal conditions iollowing the world war has · restored to Union college men a majority oi the traits which have for so long m·arked them above'\their fellows. The spirit of the col- legs is more alive than ever. There is every evidence oi a hearty loyal- ty and interest. Virtually everything that could be expected has been done to eliminate vestiges of a day when men left the ~allegiate paths for military ways. One trait, however, ha:s not entirely returned. That is courtesy. Courtesy not only in fraternity life, but about the campus, in class room and in the general everyday contact of student with student A college man, when he is graduated, is expectd by the world at large to have something of an air of culture and good breeding. If this is lacking, the man's actions are apt to cast an unfavorable light upon both graduate and alma mater. College is a training g-round and every student should make certain that in his training is included at least some of the more sensible and necessary Chesterfieldian characteristics. Those who enter fraternity houses should be treated as honored ' guests and shown every courtesy, regardless of their clothing, man- ner or station in life. Disrespect or inattention to the presence of a fellow student should be regarded as almost a sin. Lack uf good breeding on the part of any student should be a matter for adjust- ment. There should be an air of stately dignity about campus life in its more formal aspects like that of former years, but which bas not returned to the campus since the war. / Deficiency may occasionally be noted among Union men off the campus. It was only recently that three Union men boarded an irt- teru.rban car in a nearby city. They occupied two full seats, piling the vacant space high with coats and bags. As the car gradually filled and there was only standing room for the late comers, the men paid no attention to the comfort of others. Persons standing in the aisle, some of them women and children, received not the slightest consideration. Finally the conductor requested the young men to mov their belongings that the seat might be used for a passenger. The young men, Union men beyond a douht by their dress and con-. versatio11, took the condttctor's admortitibn ih rather ill humo1· and· made little or no attempt to comply. It was only when that of:ficia1• took suitcas.es, bags and other phlara'phan.eHa and piled theni a:t .the· forward end of the car, seized the back oi one seat and· {orced. ori.e . . oi the men to tise while he mov~d it and almost by ma_in strength . dislodged the feet of the others, that he was enabled to provide a seat 269 State St. Schenectady, N. Y. l!iliorf or Croolr,cs Tt:.le . ' '. 1., 1 ,, •/ ' How Were X~Rays Discovered? S IR James Mackenzie Davidson visitea Professor Roentgen to find out how he discovered the X-ra.ys. Roentgen had covered a vacuum tube, called a Hittorf or Crookes tube, with black po.per so as to cut off all its light. About four yards away was a piece of cardboard coated with a fluorescent compound. He turned on the current in the tube. The cardboard glowed brightly. Sir James asked him: \What did .you think?'' \I didn't think, I investigated,\ said Roentgen. He wanted to know what made the cardboard glow. Cnly planned experirpents could g:ve the answer. We all know the practical result. Thousands: of lives are sJ.ved by surgeons who use the X~rays. Later on, one of the scientists in the Research Laboratory of the General Electric Company became interested in a certain phenomenon sometimes observed in incandescent lamps. Others had observed it, but he, like Roentgen, investigated, The result was the discovery of new laws go-verning electrical conduction in high vacuum. Another scientist in the same laboratory saw that on the basis of those new laws he could buiJd a new tube.for producing X-rays more efifec- tively. This was the Coolidge X~ ray tube which marked the greatest advance in the X-ray art since the.origina.l·discovery by Roentgen. Thus, scientific investigation of a strange phenomenon led to the discovery of a new art, and scientific investigation of another strange phenomenon led to the greatest improvement in that art. It is for such reasons that the Research Laboratories of. the General Electric Company are continually investigating, continually exploring the unknown. It is new knowledge that is sought.· But practical results follow in an endLet>s stream, and in many unexpected ways. ,. ·. - • ric • . - ....... . . . ' I football on (Con tim selections Qy s ates.

They are as good as it's Camel QUALITY is always maintained at the same high, exclusive standard. You can always depend on the same mellow-.mild refreshing smoothness-the taste and rich flavor of choicest tobaccos-and entire freedom from cigaretty aftertaste. And remember this 1 Camels come in one size package only-20 cigarettes-. just the right size to make the greatest saving in production and packing. This saving goes straight into Gamel Quality. That's one reason why you can get Camel Quality at so moderate a price. Here's another. We put no useless frills on the Camel package. No \extra wrappers[\ Nothing just f0r show! Sueh things do not improve the smoke any more than premiums or coupons. And their added cost must go onto the price or come out of the quality.

Bantham, '23 Saturday, December 3, 1921 UNION'S MAJOR SPORT The present de1apidated condition of the Athletic Board exche- quer, which apparently makes necessary curtailment of activities and trips of the basketball team, naturally leads to the question as to what should be considered as Union'B major sport. It would be obviously unfair to criticise th.e athletic board in any way because of the debt, far it is a generally recognized fact that every member has worked e\·ery moment for the greater glory of Union. It might be wise how eYer, for the student body to make one or two suggestions to the gove1ning hocly as to what should he Union's policy in sports. [<or a number of years Union teams have been reported 111 th~ press quit:: frequently as \putting up a goo:l fight\. Victories have been scarce. Defeats have been prevalent. The most q:)!nm.on re suit of the contests was a \moral victory\ for Union. a score which so shaded that of the opponents that there was little feeling of satis faction for either team. That has been the gerteral situation in al lines of sport. It ·would he an entirely feasible plan if Union shouH elevate its sporting endeavors to one or two branches. If it can he determined in -..d1ich 1mtnch Unicn is most proficient and has the most material that should he adopted. Once the sport or sports have b::en agreed upon, a schedule should he arranged wh-ich would give Union th:: greater chat1ce at victory and an opportunity to run up a total season score ,Yhicb wou 1 d aitract attention by its \\ery extent. It is perfect ly proper and splen:i icl sportsmanship to put up a guo I fight against Qver·whelming oclds, but a review of the collegiate sporting world and results, indicates that the average college, or the colege that is seeking a sporting reputation is today so diplomatically arranging its sch~dules that its team at least appears to he of championship. calihre. :\ year of real victories would do more to put Union on the, sporting- map than a <lecade of \moral Yictories\. The football teams (Jf st·\·eral leading- institutions this yea-r are regarded as victorious,· simply because they played a schedule which was so obviously easy ·as to be a joke. It is not necessary fur Union to go to that extreme, but it might be a good policy to adopt a few of the tactics of the man- ag-ements which planned such schedules. \-:\'o sah, Ah don't neber ride on dem things\ said an old colored lady watching a merry-go-round. \Why de other day I seen dat Ras- tus Johnson git on an' ride as much as a dollah's worth, an' git oH at the very same p-lace he got on at, an' I sez to him, 'Rastus', I sez, 'yo' spent yo' money.

F·ortenbaugh, Jr., '23 Saturday, December 10, 1921 THE INTERFRATERNITY CONSTITUTION The Interfraternity Conference is to be congratulated upon its activity in proposing for adoption a workable constitution. The I document has been needed for some time, although fraternity life. in Union college has been l::_emarkably peaceful as regards relations and co-operation between various societies. It is to be hoped that the new constitution, when it has been .adopted, will be so seH-sufiicient that it will cover every possible emergency which may arise. It should be so constructed and so un- derstood that· it will be unnecessary for any member of the confer- ence to seek aid beyond the college walls in presenting an argument or pressing a point. The docum.ent should not be so narrow in scope that it cannot provide ior possible changes, but it should be provided with \teeth\ which can be shut tight when it is found necessary to enforce ruling-s. De{inite provisions should be made for the introduction of new members ~vho haYe successfully weathered a test period. This should apply to national as well as local fraternities which come to the campus. Such prO\·isions would not only protect presEnt mem- hrrs, hut woulcl insure a continued prestige ard inviolable standard of action for a.ll societies which may desire to become affiliated with• the existing organizations. The Interfraternity Conference, under the new provisions, should include all Greek-letter fraternities on the campus, once they win recognition. This would mean that not only the national and local fraternities he recognized, but also the class, honorary, literary and similar organizations. Although the purpose of the societies ma.y differ, their positions and prestige on the campus, if they be worthy organizations, should be similar. Such provisions would . insure the continuance of only those societies which are a source of benefit and would exclude those which may in any way be a detrj- ment to college or student.

The man who plays in the band is serving his Alma Mater just as much as is he \vho fights on field, court or diamond. His part is not as spectacular perhaps, and certainly not as mush appreciated; praise and cheers are quite entirely lacking; the crowd notices but little except to find iault and to pick flaws. But somewhere there is a justice, though they say she is blind, who sees the bandsman and hears 11is honest, well-intentioned \tum-tetum\ or \bla-ta-ra\ or whatever else he produces and marks down to his credit in her book. A band can be made a credit to any college, ii it be given ~roper support. And support means more than praise or interest; it is the par~icipation of every man who can play an instrument oi any kind that is useful in band work. The m,an who will do this can ieel that his efiorts. are worthy and that he is doing his share. * BIBLE THOUGHTS--- DO GOOD TO ALL DO YOU KNOW MEN :-Let us not be weary That there is an Otis Elevator in the in well doing: for in due Statue of Liberty? -o- i My career as a literal\y genius is 1 1 mostly confined 'to say.in' a Little some- thing and quittin' when I'm through.

S IR James Mac,kenzie Davidson visited Professor Roentgen to fincl out how he dtscovered the x .. rays. . Roentgen had covered a vacuum tube, called a Hittorf or Crookes tube, with black paper so as to cut off all its light. About .four yards. away was a piece of cardboard coated with a fluorescent compound. He turned on the current in the tube. The cardboard glowed brightly. Sir James asked him: \What did you think?\ \I didn't think, I investigated,\ said Roentgen. He wanted to know what made the cardboard glow. Cnly planned experiments could give the answer. We all know the practical result. Thousands of lives are saved by surgeons who use the X-rays. Later on, one of the scientists in the Resear!3h Laboratory of the General Electric Company became interested in a certain phenomenon sometimes observed in incandescent lamps. Others had observed it, but he, like Roentgen, investigated. The result was the discovery of new laws governing electrical conduction in high vacuum. Another scientist in the same laboratory saw that on the basis of those new laws he could build a new tube for producing x .. rays more effec .. tively. This was the Coolidge X~ray tube which marked the greatest advance in the X-ray art since the original discovery by Roentgen. Thus, scientific investigation of a strange phenomenon led to the discovery of a new art, and scientific investigation of another strange phenomenon led to the greatest improvement in that art. It is for such reasons that the Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company are continually investigating, continually exploring the unknown. It is new knowledge that is sought. But practical results follow in an endless stream, and in many unexpected ways. Schene()tad.y, N.

It is a delight to have such an occasion come yearly when paper and read- ers can feel the mutual bond o:f mid-winter happiness and new year resolution. It has been a pleasure for The Concordiensis to serve Union col- lege and the many readers through the past :few months. The paper is looking forward to even g-reater service in the months which re- mmn. The compliments which have been received during the year just ended assures the staii that its el:forts are appreciated. The kindly criticisms have enabled every member to correct mistakes and to learn not only what the reaaers want, but what is demanded of a news publication. The spirit of co-operation has been most hearten- ing to every man on the staff regardless oi his duties. Again, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! COLLEGE MEN AND THE JOBLESS Union college men should welcome the opportunity to be o:f practical assistance to the unemployed men and women o:f Schenec- tady. It is delightfully refreshing to contribute to a purely local cause, the results of which will be so apparent at home. The situa- tion should appeal to college men, because they, in spite of the popu- lar idea to the contrary, know full welt what it is to go -about with an empty pocket. They can also realize the advantages and benefits whjch will accrue :from making the benificiaries work for what they receive. It is quite unnecessary that college men should contribute a large amount weekly to the fund for relieveing unemployment. It occurs altogether too often that students, moved by stress of emo- tions, pledge more than they can well a:fford and thus cause hard- ship not only to themselves but to the people at home. A small amount, continued during the period of depression, will not only aid quite as much, but will serve to keep the college man's mind and at- tention focussed on what is gs:>ing on about him. . The aid given by Union college men should also promote the admiration and respect of residents of Schenectady :for the college. It is often true that residents have quite another opinion of college men-and sometimes their ideas are justified. This opportunity, however, provides the means o:f both cultivating respect and of show- ing that the college man's heart is in the right place. INTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATES Union college men are to be congratulated upon their work this year in in tercollegiate debating. Platiorm work is an art which can- not be cultivated to unfortunate e:x:tremes, for the more extensive the activity the greater the derived benefits. Intercollegiate debating should be encouraged because it proves to an incredulous public that college men are not only thinking, but us.ua. over the hadk ya·rd. cities.

Other subjects dis,oussed in detail by the speaker were the various uses of telephonic and wireless oommunka- tion on the front during the war, and of the publication of t.hese in peace times. He also showed pictures of the re•ce11tly developed automatic tele- phone eJ!!chq.111ges, and of the apparatu>S which enabled five mesages to be sent at once over one pair of teLephone wires.

W HAT structure is better known or is more typical of America than this Statue at the gate of New York. Countless thousands from the old world pass under the uplifted arr:n that holds a light which means to them worlds more than to us, though our millions know it and lov-e it for the symbol it is. It is fitting that an Otis Elevator should carry passengers up through the base to th.e foot of the Statue.
