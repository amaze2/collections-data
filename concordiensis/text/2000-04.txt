The report, which is available ()nline at http:// www .union .edu/ Academics/ AcademicAffairsJCommittees/ AAC1Reports.html, which will soon be solicited to the Academic Affairs Committee for a vote, wollld drasacally affect t11e way Union stlldents take classes. This proposal; whkh would take effect no sooner than the 2002-03 aca- demic. yeal', W()uld require students to take four classes twice a year. · The Calendar Conunittee, which is compttsed of students and fac- ulty membeis., is currently sabmit- ting feedback from many groups on campus, including varioU:s aca- demic departments and the Student Forum. A.fmalreportwill soon be submitted to the Academic Affairs Committee. If it passes that com- mittee, it wm theri be submitted to the faculty who will vote on the proposal. After the faculty votes, the proposal will then move to the president's office, where President Hull and the BoardofTrustees will ultimately reject b:t accept the pro·· posal. After a vote, where the continu- ation of the trimester system passed by a thin margin, the sub- committee was created and charged with drafting a proposal fot a semester calendar. The proposed semester system would require students to take four classes two times per year. The first semester would begin before Labor Day and run no later than December 20, withbreaks for Labor Day, a four-day Fall Break, a five-<;la.yThanksgiving break, and a four-day reading period before ·finals. Afterafourweekbreak, the second semester would begin the first week in February or the last week in January, and a have one week Spring Break in the middle of March, with classes endin.g the second week in May, f'mals would then begi.ll after a four or five-day reading period. The academic year would end with graduation on the fourth Sllllday in May. According to the draft report available online, the semester sys- Sl01a11 Mlller/CP Professor Seth Greenberg works on the Calender Proposal tern would allow for four different types of terms abroad. Students will be able to take full semesters abroad, mini-terms a. broad during the Jan11ary break, similar to the Jamaica and B~i1 mini-trips, sum- mer terms abroad like the current National Health Systems term, or virtual terms abroad, with collabo- ration with foreign students com- bined with travel as in present term in Turkey. Another notable feature of this proposal would be the implemen- tati(m of a year-hong thesis for some departments. Were this sys- tem to be appro-ved and eventu- ally implemented, each academic department wouldl'evamp its own curriculum and cotJrse content. Students would ttake fewer, but longer classes. Fout classes for eight semesters would make stu- dents take thir:ty-flvo classes, four less than the current regimen of thirty-six, altho11gh engineers would either be required or allowed to take more. However, Monday/ Wednesday/Friday classes would last sixty minutes and meet forty times, totaling 2,400 minutes per course, as opposed to the 1,950 minutes that the current system allots. Tuesday/Thursday classes would last ninety minutes and meet twenty~seven times, totaling 2,430 minutes, more than the 2,000 m.in- lltes that the trimester system cur- r~ntly allots. A brief survey of the faculty shows mixed results. Professor Seth Greenberg of the Psychology Department is a strong proponent of switching to a semester system. Greenberg questioned the dissimi- larity of Union's calendar with other institutions, saying, \Many students will go on to law school, medical school, or graduate school on a semester system.

T. Miller's tenure. The Faculty Review Board de- nied Professor Miiler tenure last May and since then he has sub- mitted an apneal and a request for reconsideration. File l\hoto still weighfu.g his options and re- viewing the case. Professor Miller's petition for appeal GOlD!llented on several pro- cedural problems. The :first of these problems wasthefailureoftheFRB to notify Miller ofthe specific rea- sons for their dedsion. ••Although the faculty manual states that can- didates will receive noti:fication ... of a negative detennination ... together with reaso11s for that determina- tion.\(Petition for Appeal) ult)' .<~t the end of this school year. Deoan .of Academic Affairs Chris- tinaSormrt was contacted in respect to tile situation and commented, \All J can do is assure you that all our]l'tocedures were followed. We have a very carefully developed pr()ce;s for tenure decisions and for ajppeals that is designed to be as fajr as possible for the candi- dates; and the College.\ The process· for tenure begins . with the formation of an ad hoc committee. The committee reviews the professor's research and pub- lished work, student evaluations ap:dhis or her depattrnentalreview. They then give this evalmition t<J the Faculty :Rtwiew Board(FRB). Professor Miller lec-tures in front of class The second complaint is that Professor Miller feels that new negative inf~rtnation was indepen- dently introduced after the ad hoc committee presented their case to the FRBbecause several members of the ad hoc committee were shocked by the fmal decision. Ot1e ofMiller's continuing sup- port~rs, Senior Peter Melito said that Ihe does not undetstaad why this.:IJ.as taken so long, \If he was a badprofessor it would be cut and dry ,but ififs taken this long there is an ()bvious discrepancy. ~A.T.] epitomizes community service, ac- tion a!ld involvement.\ The FRB considers the review and all the information in order to ·but ··did describe t}le process in detaiL make a decision within i few da-ys. · Ifa member of the faculty does In Millet'scase it took a\\<nitfive not get tenure; they have the right weeks. to a})peal the decision on the basis Upon receiving a briefletter de-. of \inadequate consideration.\ nying his tenure~ Professor Mi:ller : Thisrneans that the appeal is based wrote the FRB teq11esting Tecon- · onaflaw :iJ;I the evaluationprocess, sideration of.their decision.

After nine months, the FAC ap- proved Professor Miller;s a:ppeal, but for confi<lentiality reasons Pro- fessor Baker could not comment on what basis, the appeal was ac~ cepted. The FAC report, wvitten at the end of Winter term, was sent to the FRB. The report requested that the FRB review their original deci- sion but a week later the board de- cided there was no ground f()r re- consideration. At this point President Hull has the ultimate decision. He lias .un- limited options and can deny or grant tenure and even require the FRB to redo t~e entire process. At the printing .of this articJe, tbe President had no comment and is Another problem arose in that \hundreds of letters, petitions, phone calls,, public rallies and E- :tnails from stu.dents, faculty, par- ents, aluroni, staff and community members\ were sent to the President's office. At Professor Miller's request they would not provide him. with a list of materials and went so far as to deny the pres- ence of anyof these items.

Scholars Arrive at Union for Visit byKatrinaL. Tentor Editot-in-Chtef On Sunday,April 2, 2000the col- lege campus was invaded by _ ~ighty-five high school seniors that llre eligible for the Union's Scholars Program. Students and parents were invited to preview the program before applying. Prospec- tive students stayed in residence halls, the Symposium and Smith House with current Union schol- ars. Adniissions received over 4,000 applicatio:Q.s for the Class of2004. Of those applications, the top ten percent, ( 400 students) were ac- cepted as potential candidates for the Scholars Program. Selection is based on SATs, academic perfor- mance, extracurricular activities, and overall resumes. Associate Dean of Admissions Dianne Crozier stated that the week.. · end went well. \The weekend went very smoothly in spite of the rainy weather;\ stated Crozier. lf after the open house, students wish to apply for the Scholars Pro\' gram they must submit an addi- tional application and e.ssay. Scholars ate then selected by a committee Of faculty and one per- son from the Admissions Office. Thisyear' s freshman class has fifty scholar students. Dean of Fac- ulty,Christine Sorum would like to also have fifty scholars in the up- coming class. The Scholars Program is fairly newt<1 Union's academic curricu,.. lilin. This year's senior class is the frrst:c1ass to complete the program. It is currently directed and handled by English Professor Hugh Jenkins. Next year's program is under the direction of Anthropol- ogy Professors Karen Brisen and Stev~ .Levitt. The Scholars' Program consists of ten classes a year, instead of nineolassesoverthree terms. Ad- ditiotial coutses are at no extra cost to tuition.

Page 6 • April. 6, 2000 • C!Inncorm.ensis Camp11s News Schenectady Water Main Break: Potential Hazard by Kristen Zadourian News Editor The emergency prohibition of drinking tap water this past week was the result of a water-Inain breakage near Eastern Parkway on Sunday, April2. The pip.e burst at around 10:38 AM in front of:?rice Chopper and sent an estirnated amount of six million galkms of wa- ter gushing through the streets, homes and businesses on Eastem Parkway. According to The Albany Tim:es Union, the water-main is thirty-six inches in diameter and is used to pump water from wells ranging from Rotterdam to Niskayuna. Al- though the actual cause of the rup- ture is unknown, it has been pre- dicted that the cause may have been due to tremendous water pres- sure on the pipe, and as a result of old age. The pipe was installed in 1917. Most pipes of this nature only last about sixty years. Schenectady County officials declared a state-of-emergency, ad- vising everyone to not drink any water from a tap unless they boiled itfmt. Furthermore, it was suggested that those needing to wash their laundry should wait until the prob- lem wasrectified, as to avoid rui,n- ing OI damaging clothing. It was suspected thatchemicals or bleach now infested the water, which would obviously damage clothing washed in the water. According to G. Jack Parisi, the County's director of Enviromnen,.. tal Health, boiling-water advisory was a precaution to prevent any disease or illness in those who in- gested the water. As of Tuesday, this ban remained effective until the water had been sufficiently tested· for any water-borne diseases. According to Campus Safety, Union College was notified ofthe problem at 6:25PM on Sunday evening, which caused a scare with the drinking water. Campus Safety advise~ through electronic mail and voicemail, that all students on campus boil any water before using it. Some residents of Seward Phice learned of the incident through visits from Campus Safety officers. Unfortunately, those living off- campus were not notified of this problem either by the College or the community of Schenectady, and many off-campus residents expressed dis:p1ay at the lack of notification. Senior Greg; Williams noted, \I drank the water all night I also drallk it on Monday. I did not learn of tile problem until Monday after- noon when I entered the Campus Center for lunch.\ Senior Erin Wittes echQed the sentiments ofWilli~. \I wish that there had been some sort ofnotifi· cation for those living off-campus. I used the water Sunday night and Monday until! an:ived at school. Once I learned of the situation~ I told. everyone I knew. It seemed as though many students did not knQow what I was talking about.'' Another question that remains unanswered by campus offic-ials deals with the fact that Dutch Hal~ low was not notified of the prob- lem until after 8:00AM that water sh()uld not be serve d. Co~coraiensis asked a campus safety officer about this delay, hut he was unable to comment. Luckily, there have been no re,... ported severe side-effects due to this delay in notificatio11.

Page 8 · April 6, 2000 • CIJ:om.orbiensill Health Notification The recent water main break in Schenectady produced a hazardous .situation for all those who reside in the city. Unfortunately for the city's residents, this meant that .in order to safely consume tap water, it must first be boiled. The :local news reported this information often throughout the day, however Sunday is a day when most students wake up late and do n0t often watch the news. Homework is a much more common pastime on Sunday afternoons. As a result, it does not seem unreasonable that a better method of notification be used than the one which was chosen by the college. Though there were signs on the soda dispensers in campus dining locations, not all students used the machines. Voicemail notifications were not sent out until Monday, an entire day after· the health hazard presented itself. This is a serious problem. If the water was not safe to drink, /~-~ · Get back !\ere, \.

While knocking on doors may be an extreme solution to the problem, perhaps instead could have been posted in all on-campus bathrooms and on water fountains. In- stead, we are left to hope that we do not become ill simply be- cause we did not watch the news on Sunday morning. This hardly seems just. The reasons for the college's set of operating procedures may not be clear to us, but what is clear is that we· as a community should quite possibly be more aware ofthe world around us. There are no walls around~Union College behind which we can hide, and we should take some measure of responsibility for ourselves and our safety. Perhaps we shoula:.watch the news more often, anll pay closer attention to what is going on in the city around us. Obviously it is in our interests, in fact, in our health interests, to do so. While as students at an academic institution we have come to expect, and even demand, an added layer of protection from the outside world, it certainly would not hurt to be a bit more aware, in general, of the surrounding environs. In a short period of time there will not only be no walls between us them, but there will be no fences, either. Perhaps a few sick students is what it will take for this student body to realize this, however ideally that would not be the case. The result of this situation is a campus community that is some- what disgruntled, perhaps justifiably so, but hopefully a commu- nity that is better prepared for future problems, as well, and one which will be more responsible.

Sure, we have a lot of reading, papers, and assign- ments to do, but at least we have the opportunity to spread it all over a ten week interval. If we think we are the ()nes who have it rough, then think again. As students, we tend to think that we are the busy and stressed ones dn this camp11s, but we fail to recognize the people who make Union what is really is. These people are the faculty and staff of Union College. While we have on average two or three hours of class per day, and maybe even a day off here and there, the staff of Union have has to work for eight hours a day, five days a week! They are under intense pressure during the first couple weeks of the term just as much as we are. Let us focus on the bookstore. Sure, 1 have heard various remarks and comments made by my fellow classmates about the bookstore, such as, \Why do they have t'O make us leave our bags by the door?\ and \Oh my god that book . is so exJle~i'Ve !\ Now, put yont negative v3ews a:bout the book- store asi<le for a nrinute and think about i~im]Jottance here at Union. Where else can you buy the books and office su:pplies that are essen- tial for it.ll rom classes? Think about this: 'i'Vhile we were home on break: ba.sk:.ing in the sun on those bea.l.Jt:iflll Cancun and Florida beaches. the employees of the bookstore,..,erebusy working their usual .day·t()-day shifts even though there were no studeats there.

While you are in college, the only benefits you have for getting good grades is a good feeling when you get a slip of paper and a dinner and celebration if you make it on the Dean's List. This means that somebody with a 4.0 GPA is the same student as somebody with a 2.() GPA. Now; I am not saying that you should increase the sta- tus of the student with the higher GP A, but that person should get some sort ofbenefit or benefits. One that comes to mind for sophomores, is, ietting those with higher GPA' shave the flnlt chance to get the Seward Street apart- ( . ments: After all, why shouldn't someone who works harder and gets higher ;grades benwarded with the benefit .of getting an apartment or getting off c&mpus?

One .of those that directly relates with academics is a possible preference in ch(')osing classes. A.nd, if it is true that our dorms do not have cable because it would take us away from our work, then why couldn't we give cable to those who do their work and have proYen it? I d!oh 't feel that any program like this will provide an incentive for students to work harder, although it mtght. If the cut off point was a · 3 .. 0, and a student was going into the spring trimester with living con- diti()ns for next year on the line, I wollld imagine that that person would try a little harder to get the grade. And, if cable in the dorms was on the line, I'm pretty sur~ they rnighttryalittle bit harder. But even if a policy like this was imple- mented, and grades did not im- prove at all, it would be nice for students who work harder to get something on this campus. After all, shouidn't we support those wh() get higher GP A's? As much as I hate to admit it, your GP A determines y<lur status. That is the tool that we uset<J sepa- rate students. So, why can't we make it a little better for those who succeed here? Wby can'tthey see the benefits of their hard W()rk now? It might just be nice. Dear Sirs, I read your article concerning a rumor of a fraternity merger. I'm glad that the rumor is bein,g dis- pelled as untrue. I think thatmerg~ ing brotherhoods would be a bad precedent. I am disturbed by Dean Schurick's comments, though. From your article, there was no mention of the Dean basing .an anti-merger opinion on any docu~ mented crimes, poor academic per- formance, or mischiefs of the indi~ vidual prospective Sophomores that were proposed. Instead, the pres~nted basis of arguement was association with Beta Theta Pi and Delta Upsilon. The basis of arguement was the group of be- ers.\ John Rocker would, likely, be proud to call Dean Shurick a friend. It's quite ironic that the last \Union College\ magazine featured a picture of members of the 1989 ECAC Champion Dutchman Foot~ ballTeam.The great majority of play- ers on that team, including those pictured in the photograph, that Union College claims to be so proud of, are brothers ofBeta Theta Pi and Delta Upsilon.

Although [believe -The Difficulty with Genes by Ste'Ve Ayers Sta:ffWriter Recently, he:atth care reform has become a popular topic within the presidential nee for both the Democrats an.d Republicans. At the heart .o_f tltis debate is t-he challenge. of pr~viding quality care for:the large nwnber of Americans currently with()ut insurance, at an affordable cost. This problem is not new, and it has long bee11 known that the aging of the American population will force tough choices in the near future. However, one potential crisis which may have been overlooked is that produced by the development ~f effective gene therapies. Some illnesseshave been known to run in families for a long time, and those with a family history of such conditions have a high probability of contracting them. For some diseases, including some forms (}f breast cancer, we have actu11lly been able to find genes that correlate with occurrences of the disease. This means that tho~e predisposed to the disease ca.n take action to prevent it or help detect it, whether this is through ;a true genetic test or merely a test for the disease itself eurtently, the public perception of these therapies has been · 've. Patients are now able to determin.e what illnesses they are predisposed to and take some form of early action against them. This is a dramatic improvement over the old system, in which those patients who were .predisposed to an illness would \,have no way ofknowing this, and 'the treatment options would be limited. However, as more different types of tests are invented, several po- tential problems also emerge. The first of these is confidentiality. The patient who is predisposed for breast cancer obviously has an interest in not letting those around her know this. Knowledge of this condition could prompt discrimina- tion from employers. Statutes for the protection of this kind .of information are now lax. The inherent problem of privacy protection could be· aggravated by the nature of our healthcare system. Health care organizations would be pr()vided with a natural incentive to avoid those patients who are predisposed to illness, possibly resulting in an entire class of patients who most companies are reluctant to insure. These patients would be m()re likely to seek out the most compre- hensive health care plans available. However, they will requit-e more care than average, resulti:ng in health care companies paying more for care ofthese patients than they receive from them. this could lead to the bankrupting of the insurance companies. . In either of these scenarios, the consequences would be severely negative. In one case, our entire health insurance system could collapse; In the other case, the patients who most need healthcare would be those who would have the most difficulttirrie obtaining it. The solution to this problem will p,robably involve a difficult deci- sion making process on how to limit the care that our health care sys- tem is capable of providing. This is a process that America has been especially reluctant to undergo, because it is so contrary to our high value of individualism, but some form of this could be necessary in the future. ·· Eventually, the discovery of ef- fective genetic Q:eatments could help to ease the difficulty that this problem poses. A disorder caused by the presence of a certain gene in a patient could, potentially, be cured by the modification of that patient's genes. This type of gene engineering could give rise to an entirely new set of moral dilemmas, but it WQUld .at least provide a simple solution to the current dilemma of genetic testing. The eventual rewards to genetic test- ing and therapies .could he great, but if we do not prepare for the moral dilemmas of the near future, the costs could be as well.

Fifty years in business seems to IJe the benchmark of success for a company. It is a landmark occa- sion that usually involves offering new products, imprdved conunu- llication lines between the consUitl- ers.and CEOs, and sometimes even technological advances. The mil- lennium year marks the fifth de- cade celebration for two larger known companies, Dunkin' Do- ll!Jts and those respcmsible for Silly Futty. As of.this year, it's been \time to make the donuts\ for approxi- mately 17,600 days.

Recept commercials have done <1 great job announcing the ~rrival of this momentous event. The company is even allowing people t() vote on their favorite donut! The year 2000 is also a milestone fo()r the company that ifivented Silly Putty. In order to commemorate fifty years in business, the com- pany has announced a new c:ollector' s color.

You do not ilave to think when playing Mario Kart. The less one has to thitlk out of the classroom the better they feel. Mario Kart provides this feeling (;)f contentment. Another major reason that so many people like the game is .that it allows for friendly competition between friends. The game accomodates up to four players participating in the mortalcombat that is Mario Kart. There is some~ thing very satisfyinJS about screw- ing over a competitor .and winning a close race. Leave it to \Kart as it is called for short, to provide a multitude of ways 1() destroy and punish those who dare race against you. The game offers· almost ten different ways to malce other play- ers' race more mise~able. My per- sonal favorite is the lightning bolt. This nasty little option allows for you to shrink all the other oppo- nents_ Now some people have called the lighting llolt the toll of the no-talented, but I believe that it is a game equalizer. Other en- emy destroying options include banana peels, red and green shells, lightning, invincibility and the ever annoying blue first place seeking shell. (Note: I feel this is th.e weapon of the n()-talent play- ers) Still another reason for the ap- game value is high. Unlike most games, every race in Mario Kart is com- pletely different from the race be- fore. You might win two or three races in a row, but change the play- ers you are playing against ot the character you are racing with and the whole dynamic of the race is altered. Thousands. of different race combinations exist so that as a player you feel that you are play- ing a new game every time you take up the challenge of \Kart.\ The last reason that Mario Kart is so much fun and the real reason that it is a G.P.A. killer is that the games are quick. No game lasts more than three or four minutes. This quick game play allows for several hundred games to be played in a several hour period. And like the saying goes, ''o.nce you pop you can't stop.\ It is very hard to race just one race, let alone ten races. It is not uncommon to sit down and before you realize it, find several hour~ have gone by and while those h~urs~n, y~ou~ve_ been domg your homework. Hence the reason forthe label ofG.P.A. killer.

Starling Shows Promise· ·Erin Brokovich by AJex Chase Contributing Writer Sustainer is the debut album of Ottawa's Starling, a new pop-rock group that could have the poten- tial to break through in the States. The band's popularity has been slowly rising; theyplayedwith The Tragically Hip ata New Year's Eve bash at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, and have songs airing on both an episode of Providence and on the soundtrack to a new film entitled Ready to Rumble, starring Oliver Platt, David Arquette and ScottCaan. It seems that the band's sugary sweet sound may guarantee them a spot in the pop music scene of the states. Their music blends experimen- tal studio antics with soft, atmo- spheric guitars. The lyrics alm0st always explore the same emotions of fourteen-year-old sadness in- volving the loss of a loved one, the formula of a pop classic. Although the band does play on safe ground as far as a gentle sound and harmless lyrics, the band's studio experti~e easily shows through on the album. Tile band produced the album them- selves, and their handiwo~ shows through on each track, from the clock-like ticking on \Best Behaviour\ to the smooth riffs on \Delusional.\ The first single off the album, Seeing that as college students we have so much time to do read- ing that goes beyond what is as- signed in our classes, I thougllt that it would be beneficial to start a Union College weekly book re- view.

The song exemplifies how \al- ternative music\ has been swal- lowed by the mainstream, produc- ing a grunge influenced sound that comes off with much less emo- tion, tamed guitars and relaxed drums.

The band comes off as. another mere \college rock\ band, playing swearing out loud) but also is the spitting image of actor Bruce Willis. What ensues is, at the same· time both very amusing and extremely disturbing. Mr. Eringer, however, does a fme job blending the themes Can Starling re- main loyal to Cana- dian fans and still · make it big? Or will they follow the tragic path that the Hip have cho- sen? Starling has a few shows com- ing up; April14 they will play the NEMO Convention Show at T.T. The Bear's in Boston. April 17 there will be a show at Maxwell's in Hoboken, N\ew Jersey, and on April21, at the Bowery Ballroom in New York City.

Check these guys out, they might just be the next big band, whether in the States, or north of the border. ety might not be one hundred per- cent accurate. One problem that I had with the hook, however, was the fact that JeffDalkin had Tourette's and is a Bruce Willis twin. by Jessiea Brearton Staff Writer I'm a sucker for those little guy (or girl) versus the big corporate behemoth tales, so I guess I was predisposed towards liking this movie. What I was surprised by was how much I did. The title charac:. ter,. Erin Brockovicb, is a down on her luck former beauty queen, left alone to raise three young children . without any marketable skills and · little experience. The film opens with a job interview, one we feel is the latest in a. string of failed at- tempts. Erin flashes her winning smile and boasts of being great with people but fails to convince the doubtful interviewer. Erin ends up indebt and desper- ate for a job. She returns to the office of the lawyer who had guar- anteed (but failed to get) a settle- ment for an accident that left her . with $17,000 of medical bills and · virtually demands a job. He gives it to her, partially be- cause he is a g'Ood man who real- izes that he promised something he couldn't deliver, and also because he seems unable to deny the force that is Erin Broc:kovich. Erin is, it turns out, a force to be reckpned with. When she discovers a medical report in a real estate file, some- thing she finds odd, she begins an investigation which will, ultimately, lead to a large-scale legal-suit, one of the largest in hi~tor'y. She takes the initiative and uses her brains, her personality,. and sometimes her looks to get what she needs. She has found something she is passionate about, and dedicates herselfwhole-heartedly. The movie is not just about the battle between the wronged little people and the evil corporation that hurt them. view any way you want. I do hope, however, that if you see a book in this ar- ticle you will go out and read it. The editor sent the fJrSt book that I will review. . •·\\'·'i)n.e··problem:,,that··.r,. . . ftcid with the boolv. While each situation that arises out of these particu- lar traits are funny, it is over- kill that Dalkin has both Tourette's and the Bruce Willis thing going. The other major problem that I had with the book was the way it ended. I liked the ending; I do not want to give the impression that the book is a had book because of the ending. I just feel that · Rather, this serves as the back- drop for the story of Erin Brockovich, the twice-divorced single mother who almost single- handedly gatheredpeople together for what they desetve.d . Lo Mein is a work of fic- tion written by Robert Bringer, is at its core about the lunacy oftoday's soci- ety and the world we live in. [t presents this lunacy of life in such a way that the reader cannot help but laugh. The story revolves around two men and the events that bring their lives to,.. gether. The main character of Lo Mein is failed artist Willard Stukey. Fed up with his failures, Stukey travels to Walt Disney World t() perfomi, as he calls, \an exhibitiott of live art.\ The other major char- acter is a trouble-shooter hired by Disney to deal with Stukey's exhi,. bition, named Jeff Dalkin. Dalldn is a man who not only suffers from Tourette' s syndrome (prone to of comedy and philosophy in this book. Every aspect of the debate over art and society is discussed as this story unfolds. I found it very interesting that the author chose the topic of art as his basis for a discussion on soci~ ety. For many, art and society go hand in hand, but Mr. Bringer suc- ceeded in making the point that this representation of art and soci- ·. · it's too abrupt. The author builds the reader up for the thirty some odd chapters and then the book just ends. It is a let down in my eyes. Overall I enjoyed Lo Mein. It was a relatively quick read as I wa§! able to finish the book in a day and a balf. It had a nic.e mix of humor and grossness to keep the pace quick and light. Overall I would rate this hook a three and a half book W<JmlS out of five. Next week there will be a brand- new book to review and a classical recommendation. Erin discovers a sense ofw()rth, of purpose. She discovers the f.eel· ing afbeing useful, offeeling im- portant, of feeling respected. It is heartening to .see this dis- covery, though it does come at a high price, as we watch the stress oftbe situation impacting her cltil- dren, her life with her boyfriend, everything. Ultimately, though, this journey of self-discovery is worthwhile- rarely is a journey of self-discov- ery not worthwhile in a movie. As Erin's children and her boyfriend become aware of what she is being drawn away from them towards, they begin to respect her and her decisien as well. ~his is a true story, and the real Erin Brockovich can be spotted in the film- she appears in a diner scene involving Erin and her three children. She plays the blond wait- ress waiting on them, wearing a Julia nametag. Appropriate, since the actress playing Erin is none other than Julia Roberts, an actress who has repeatedly shown her skill with comedy but has rarely 'had success with drama. This film seems to be bucking the trend, coming in first at the box office in consecutive weeks, due in no small part to her terrific perforillance. The movie is successful on sev- eral fronts. It pmvides an absorb- ing tale of the devastating effects of corporate greed on average people, and the legal tale it tells is both compelling and realistic. The hours spent gathering sig- natures, pictures, and testimony are portrayed well- not glamor- ously, not especially dramatic, b-ut the nitty-gritty hard work that is the backbone of any successful suit. And fmally, Erin Brockovich is brought to life vividly. It's a testimony to the film fuat she is not turned into a saint, as too many films do to their protag<>- nists. Instead, she is seen for wh:at she is - a complex, intelligent, passionate woman who was f~r from perfect, but who was able to empower hundreds ofpeeple, one of whom happens to be Erin Brockovich herself.

News Analysis: The Policies of Bush and Gore How Do Bush 1 s Educational Policy and Gore's Environmental Agenda Stack up? by David Gruner StaffWriter While President Clinto11 begins to settle into his last yeal' as the commander in chief, tw() p.otential successors have been able io with- stand a grueling primary season outlasting \their respective contem- poraries. Both Governor George W. Bush and Vice President Al G{)re have raised the necessary fund~ and re- ceived the votes that have buried the likes of an Arizona Senator and Vietnam POW John McCain, as well as a former Senator from New Jersey and NBA star, Bill Bradley. All that remains now is seven more months of hard-nosed presi- dential politics ... amongsttw<i cou- rageous politicians. Governor Bush has had t<> deai with a somewhat dismal campaign, recently attempting to revive his .. compassionate conservative\ ap- peal that made his can&dacy an attractive ticket in the first place. From tax cuts to America's judi- cial system to our role inthe emerg- ing global community t() t:he es- sence of morality, \Du'b:ya\ has il- lustrated the need to end the scan- dal-ridden Clinton era an<l subse- quently, Vice President Gore. Moreover, GovemoT Bush has issuoo a new reform proposal with regard to education.

By allowing each district to de- termine bow bestto mold its .school system, the future of our rich na- tion will undoubtedly continue. Governor Bush would like to see an America that views education as a state-to-state· issue, with em- phasis p:laced on seriously.educat- ing cur children. Fer, should we desist t<> attend to s.uch a significant part of our economic well being, our role in the world will inevitably succumb to foreign patrons. Vice President Gore, on the other han<l, has had to deal with a more attentive audience. When he first announced his candidacy, many weren't willing to listen to his mo- notonous and ·tedious political voice. Yet, he persisted, moved his cam- paign headquarters out of Wash- ington, and revamped his physical image. And as a result, he has had to contend with a more popular presence and engaging campaign. Yet, with the appeal comes the need for real policy making, speci- fying his issues. Recently, Vice President Gore unveiled a platform with regard to the rising gasoline prices. His ef- forts have been centered on pro- moting higher mileage vehicles..

Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was taken to Juntendo University Hospital on Sunday after complaining of fa- tigue. Doctors tllert determined that he had suffered a stroke and admitted him into intensive care, It is said that he later fell into a coma and was placed. on life support. Mikio Aoki, the Chief Cabinet Secretary at the time, was ap- poin.ted as. caretaker Prime Minis- ter immediately after the incident. Aoki announce~ the news of Obuchi at a press conference on Monday. Aoki s~tid. that Obuchi bad appointed him as acting P:rime Minister. It is said that Obuchi's hospital- izaticn can affect the ruling of the Liberal Democratic Party, compli- cating its prospects for the Lower House election in the Diet that is due to be held in October. There is fear that a poli.tical vacuum can form as a direct result of this situation.

In this situation~ the Cabinet is re- quired under Japanese law to re- sigll!. if the J>ritne Minister is inca- pacitated. This is mdeed what took place on Tuesday. Japan's Cabinet re- sigmed en masse so the Liberal Democratic Party could choose a successor to Keizo Obuchi. It is expected that Y oshiro Mori will be cho~;;en as party leader, and Japllll' s Prime Minister. It has also been said fuat Fore,ign Minister Yollei Kono could replace Ohuchi. The acting Prime Minister called aC11binet meeting which was cen- tered around. discussion of Mori. Aokistated that he wou:ld start to collect Cabinet resignations at 7 PM, and be also stated that he had infoimed Ohuchfs wife ofthis.de- cision.

Two years ago, Aleksandras Lileikis was brought to trial for sending hundreds .of Lithuanian Jews to Nazi deatlt SEJuads during the Germari occup11tion in the Sec- ondWorldWar. However~ the judge found Lileilcis to be physically unfit for trial; hence, at the age of ninety, he was not .prosecuted. Two yeats later, Lileikis has pub- lished his memoirs,. and because of this fact, many organizations aq,d Nazi hunters believe that he is well eno11gh to stand trial. E:frairn Zuroff,the head of the Simon Wiesentha1Center's Jerusa- lem branch, said,. \While such a step (writing memoirs) under nor- mal circumstances would not arouse any special attention, it be-: comes ·Of note when the author is charged with ge11ocide but has been declared medically unfit to stand trial.\ Zuioff .said in a statement, \It seen:ts obvious that if Mr. Lileikis is well enough to write such a book, he is ~ertainly capable ofbeing held accountable for his crimes ... The sooner Mr. Lileikis and the other unprosecuted Nazi murderers who are still free in Litliuania are incar- cerated, the more seriously we will be able to relate to the efforts of the Lithuanian judiciary to bring: the Lithuanian perpetrators ofthe Ho- locaust to the bar of justice.\ During the Nazi occupation, tileikis was the head of the Vilnius Last September, Lileikis entered an itlnocent plea.

In a recent 60 Minutes investi- gation, hundreds of war criminals were found living in the United Sta.tes and Canada.

Gennany hascontrib11ted reparations to Israel; recently, Swiss banks set up a fund to repay many Holocaust survivors for sto- len gold, accounts, art, property, and insurance claims. The simple fact that it has taken over a half century fm many of these allegations and reparations to become realized is outrageous. The prosecuted crimi11als are in their eighties or nineties; within a nl!lllber of years there won't be any living war criminals. More impor- tan.tly, the direct holocaust survi- vors are dying as well With most survivors at least in their seven- ties, only a few years remain to bring true justice and administer appropriate reparation. The fact that these stuvivors are getting a few thousand dollars for their slave labor is notexactly true justice; however, the fa<:t that such a symbolic step was taken is good enough because no monetary amount can be assigned for such a horrific treachery.

Barylick Editor-in-Chief Emerita The Middle States Committee spent Monday and Tuesday at Union College evaluating the college's report for re-accredita- tion. This process, which occurs once every ten years, requires ef- fort from various facets of the col- lege community over two years. The accreditation allows Union to obtain certain federal funds that aid the college. Also, it facilitates the acceptance for those students who pursue graduate degrees. The report was prepared by a steering conunittee composed of sixteen faculty and administrators as well as six working groups each with seven or eight faculty and one to four students. Although this process seemed dominated by faculty and staff, students were certainly involved.

i j j ' I ' Campus News (IJ:mu:armensis • April 13, 2000 • Page 3 Daily Jolt Forum Contains Racist Posts by Jason Putorti Web master Over the pa,st few weeks, seri\ ous controversy has arisen regard- ing the continuation of the Union flavor of The Daily Jolt Web site maintained by Tim Riley. The issue is the Forum that al- lows students to ,post anything they want completely anony- mously to the rest of the college community. Since the Daily Jolt's inception at the beginning of Winter Tenn 2000, it has grown in popularity to he a regular web stop for Union students. You cal). check the weather, din- ing hall: mehus, order take out food, find a ride to where you need to go over the weekend; grab TV or movie listings, or buy and sell itGms in the rnarkt;:tplace. There are also a number of often tough-to- find links t() the Union Web site for course schedules, the library, cam- pus movie schedules and other useful inf<;mnation. Daily Jolt itself is not a creation ofTimRiley, rather it was founded by two peoP.le, one from Amherst College, and another from Brown University, Michael Goezler, who dropped out to start The Daily Jolt, Inc. Since its founding, The Daily . Jolt has grown to include thirty-six colleges and universities including the Ivy League universities of Pennsylvan~a. Brown, Yale, Come'1l, Columbia and Princeton. According to Goezler, \Union is one of the more successful sites.\ The forum has always been a prob- lem in the eyes of some students but as .of late it has taken on in- creasingly racist and discriminatory tones. This got the attention of Mario Cruz, who was casually surfmg the web 6ne day and stopped, like many Union students do, at the Daily Jolt forum. According !o Cruz, the defama- tory writings he saw in the forum \pushed the boundary,\ of what he thought should be on a public forum atUnionCollege. Cruz, like many other students, is vecy up\ set by the ability of people to ex- press their negativity anony- mously and attack whpmever or whatever group they see fit. He has taken it upon himself to lead a \public stand against [the continuation of the forum].'' The local critics of Cruz, who are of course anonymous with the excep- tionofTirn Riley, have told h:im to just deal with it, or that these feel- ings need to-be let out. . Cruz responded, \This isn't somethingyoucanjust ~deal with', it's m~t a cold or the flu or some- thing simple like that, it's racism and bigotry ... Imagine if you were a [minority student] ... would you feel comfortable here, especially after reading the Jolt?\ _ · Cruz .does not believe that the blatantly discriminatory posts help to solve any issues or proffi6te understanding, as many people claim The Daily Jolt forum is do- ing. He also believes that the fo- rum, besides being a PR disaster, makes him feel, as an admissions courtselor, like a hypocrite by in- forming prospective students of ulty members alike.

Campus News Two Profe,ssors Honored Union Gives with Fulbright Fellow.ships Back by Mary C. Felton News Editor Union has tlte distincthc:xn.or this year of having not only one but two recipients ~fthe Fulbdght Fel, lowship. Professor Theresa Meade ofthe History Department and Professc;>r Sharon Grnelch ofthe Anthropol~ .ogy Department were both awarded a teaching/research fel- lowship; which they winpartid:pate innext year. Bo,th professors will be Jeacving Union College for a perio<;l oftime next year to J>ursue a teaching or research opportunity in a fcreign country. Meade wili be spending a full year in Tokyo, Japan whileGmelch will be spending half a year in the outskirts ofDublin, Ireland. Fulbright Fellowships are given out to college professors. High School teachers and students all across the United States. Thou- sands of people receive tllese fel- lowships every year. There are .three types that per- tain to university or college pro- fessors. Professors such as Meade and Gmelch can receive Fu:!brights to simply teach ina foreign coun- try, teach as well as conduct re- search or simply conduct research. Funding for these fellowships comes partlyftmnThe Institute for International Studies office in Washington, D.C., but mainly from the country seeking the teaching or research aid. The process for obtaining such a fellowship issomewhatlongand detailed. First the host cmmtry, such as Japan in Meade's case, decides what positions they want to make available. A list of these positions, which was actuallyjust released for the academic year 2001-2002, is then compiled by the office in Washington. Each position being offered is different and there is a range of dif- ferent teaching institutes from ones that may be specific to those that are more general in their offer- ings, such as the Sorbonne. The Fulbright serves as a sort of \clearing house,\ explained Pro- fessor Andrew Feffer the Fulbright advisor at Union, acting as a bro- ker for the C()Untries involved. The process for those who ap- ply for a Fulbright, is as follows: First a candidate must pic.k a fel- lowship he or she would like to participate in and then apply for it, which is a lengthy process. The applications woukl be due August 1 of 2000 for a Fulbright for 2001-2002. Once the applica- tion~ are received in Washington, they are put hefore a panel where fol1rto five candidates are selected for each position. These nominees are then for- warded to each country~ where the decision is made about which nominees they would like to fill their positions. Those who apply f0r Fulbrights usually find out whether or not they have been accepted in March or April, six months after they have initially applied.

Not only did he offer inforrna- . tion about his field, but also gave valuable advice about the profes- sional world existing beyond the sheltered gates of Union. For those of you not familiar with ROT ARACT, it is worth men- tioning and getting yourself acquatined with. The club formed . last term and is presently led by its Sophomore President Anna Kerster. · ROTARACT is chartered by the well-known ROTARY club. RO- TARY created the subdivision as a way to promote the organization as well as to extend itself to col- lege students. Mark Sheehan, member of the Schenectady Rotary Club and ROTARY advisor to Union's ROT ARACT, stated, \The goal ofROTARACT is to help col- lege students across the country nurture their own professional ca- reers.\ Beaudoin revealeli that he is \in an industry that rewards and en- courages people to be less than truthful... you become an extension of where you are.\ -He continued, \You are in a world where people get caught up in getting the job done and often times it doesn't matter to them how they do it; you get paid by your sue cess .. \ Beaudoin's answer to these is- sue:s, which .afflict nearly all pro- fessions, is for people to find out who they are and what they want. Otherwise, Beaudoin commented \Jn.dividuals become chameleons going in directions .that are not good for them.'' Another important component to Beaudoin's lecture was the great importance he placed on volunteer- ing. Beaudoin, a ROTARY member since 1982, stated, \Volunteerism is your payback for being here on Earth. It provides intellectual stimulation, needed enjoyment, and i 1 is a way you can really reach out and help someotle.\ Volunteering provides a sense ofiJ>ersonal homeostasis that gets disrupted by careers.

Page 6 • April 13, 2000 • QI.omnrbiensi,; Union Goes International by Rachel Bukowski Sports Editor In December of 1999, Interna- tional Student's Assistant Rebecca Fisher h.ad a vision of the many cultures represented in the student body at Union C91lege coming together and learning to appreciate the traditions of others. She sent out letters to all of the International students at Union, asking them if they would like to organize a booth for a cultural fes- tival, whose purpose was. to pw- mote internationalism on campus. After receiving an impressive re- sponse from roughly 100 students, Fisher and these students began planning for Union College's First Annual International Festival. They obtained funding through the generosity of the Ted Schwartz Fund, the Office of International Programs, an Intellectual Enrich- ment Grant and the Dean of Stu- dents. The International Festival was held on AprilS, 2000 in Old Chapel for a crowd that, in the words of Fisher \packed the place tot he point where people had trouble moving from one booth to an- other.\ Si~teen countries from all over Europe, Asia and South. America were represented including Nepal, Spain, Germany, the Dominican Republic and Japan to name just a few. Each country set up a booth exhibiting aspects of their country, such as maps, historical informa- tion and food. There were two masters of cer- emony who provided entertain- ment for the diverse crowd. They directed the students to tlle differ- ent booths and informed them of random facts regarding different countries around the world. For instance, at one point tlt~y told the . crowd that Ghana was actually the country clo sestto the ce11ter of the earth, which contradicts, the view that americans hold that they are • the center of the earth. In addition to the booths set up by students representing their re- spective countries, there were a number of other attractions includ- ing performances, and students were dressed in traditional cloth- ing sent straight from their home countries. There was a flamenco dance per- formed by students who had spent last term in Spain and a perfor- mance oftraditional Puerto Rican songs. Fisher also felt that the Interna- tional Festival filled a need for the students just returning from their term abroad. \Many times, a stu- dent will return from his or her term abroad and want to share their ex- periences with their -peers. The festival gave these students an opportunity to show what they learned while residing in another country and learning to appreciate the culture.\ Fisher could not believe how much pride students at Union had in their respective cultures. \'There is a cultural community at Union College, under the surface of our seemingly homogenous ex- terior. This festival allowed every- one to feel comfot1ahle with who they are and where they came . from.\ . C:unpus News Chilean Torture by Kristen Zl}dourian News Editor Pedro Al~jandro Matta, leader of ex-politicaL prisoners and victims of torture during A gusto Pinochet' s regime, in Chile, spoke at Union last Tuesday and Wednesday. During Professor Meade's Latin American Refonn and Revolution class on 'Tuesday, April 4, Matta spoke a boat the rise of the student movement in Chile in the earlier 1970's. Matta, then a law student a.tthe University ofChile, Santiago, was part of this student movement to change Chilean society. Several aspects of Chilean cul1ure were dis- heartening to students and Matta along wit:h thousands of others united to make a change. Matta stressed that the goal of the student movement was change, to make Chile a better place for all to live. S.tudents during the sev- enties we;re mostly middle class and felt it was their duty to give back to S()ciety. The studentmovementwas only ' the beginl3ing of what was to come in the nexltfew years: in Chile. On Wednesday, Matta focused his discussion on the conse- quences {)If the student movement. At 7:30 in the Reamer Campus Au- ditorimn, Matta presented a lecture titled \Memories of Torture: An ex-politic:al prisoner describes life and deatil in Pinochet's Prisons.'' In 1973 Pinochet overthrew the Salvador Allende government. Matta. al<mg with thousands of other stttdents were brought to Pedro Mt1tta lectures on Chilean torture, the main points of this fight for justice. Matta conclucled by say- ing, \along with Pinocltet on trial will be many things that shape us as a human race.\ A strange event hap.pened dur- irig the lecture which caught all of the audience and especially Matta by surprise. not possibly :U'I1derstand the events he and thousands of oth- ers went througll. The student had nothing else to ask or nothing to .a.dd; he clearly had no knowledge of the events that occuned, a:s expressed in the comments he ma(Je. -------------~-------------1 prisons where they were tortured A non-Union Chilean student attended the lecture with a framed portrait of Pinochet. During the question answer section of the lec- ture this young man, whose name remains anonymous, stood up and held up his portrait proudly for everyone to see. Matta shoo}( llis hand and thanked him fon::oming to speak. Again, after tlte young man re- turned to his seat, Matta com- mented on how lle admired the stu- dent for havi11g the courage to come in ftont ofthe crowd and to speak. Middle States Report •.. contimud from page 1 -stance, various professors em- phasized the need for more admin- istrative support for faculty re- search. They illustrated several areas in the research process that needed improvement. such as the time and money allotted for travel to con- ferences as well as the time allot- ted for research itself. Staff members from Student Ac- tivities expressed their desire for more funding for programs coupled with the need for social space in which to hold events. They noted that the social alternatives have in- creased greatly over the past two years butthey would like to go fur- ther with the process so that they can provide late-night alternatives for students. Students echoed the need for increased funding as well as social space. They claimed that this would alleviate the burden on Old Chapel and increase the frequency of campus-wide events. On another note, an Arts Depart- ment professor expressed her con- cerns about the need for new arts facilities that would greatly en- hance the college. This professor also noted that a \strong viable, well-presented arts program would enhance general education.\ The plea concluded with the notion that .. the college needs to commit to new buildings'' for these departments. A professor from the Classics Department expressed the need for more funding for the IEG commit- tees. She noted that this commit- tee provides funding for those wanting to engage in cultural events. She also mentioned that \if they had more money they could cer- tainly do more.\ Much of the conversation dur- ing the remainder of the open fo- rum centered on the topic of fac- ulty research and the benefits as well as ill\awbacks of it. Many expresse<l concerns and suggestions about this matter so that this information will be in- cluded in the final report. for infomation regarding their per- vious actions as part of the larger student movement. Matta showed slides, which il- lustrated the several different meth- ods of torture, performed on both men ami women in the prisons. Matta described \Villa Grimaldi\ as the largest prison where stu- dents a11d government officials were taken and held. According to Matta over .5000 were talten there and more than 200 were killed o<r disappeared. Matta said that the purpose of these men was not to kill, but to get information, Therefore, when a prisoner died during a torture session the tortur- ers had no choice but to disregard the evid.ence. Matta stated, \Ter- ror was used as a political instru- ment of control.\ In 1976 the United States Jus- tice Department requested that the prisoners be released. Since his release Matta has been working to bring P'inochet and his subordi- nates t() justice. Matta is currently working in Chile to see that Pinochet, whom has recently returned to Chile, be tried allld justice served. Matta stressed that the fight for justice :is not for vengeance. Moreover, Matta stated that the reason that he wants Pinochet to be tried. now is to make an example out of),ll,'hat happened. Human dig- nity and respect for human life are Matta invited him to come down to the front of the room and to speak to the audience from the stage. The student's father was a student at the same titne as Matta, however Matta was part of the student movement atld the father was not. Matta commented on the young boys courage to come in front of a crowd and display his loyalty to his father and to Pinochet. However, Matta continued to address the young man saying what a shame that his father was unable to come to th.e lecture to- night, because he was .the one who really knew the story. He under- stood that the student was remain- ing loyal to his father and handled the outburst respecta.bly. According to the stndent, his father was not taken to any pris- ons and did not experience any tor- ture, and did not agree with the con:iments that Matta was making about Pinochet and his r_egime. This young man's family were and still are loyal to Pinochet. Matta explained to the young man what his intentwas on speak- ing about the torturing that wa.s happened Uilder Pinochet's regime .. Matta was not trying to person- ally attack Pinochet, ratherhe was informing the public of the situa- tion that did occur in Chile in 1973. Matta politely told the student that he was not there· and could However, the crowd was not as accepting of th& event as Matta was; Professor Maleki stood up ·and thanked Matta for coming and then continued tc say that he felt it a great honor to be in his pres- ence. However, Maleki did not agree with Matta's ()Omrnent that the young man wa:s showing courage by getting up in front of the crowd with the portrait <JfPinochet. He continued a.nd said that he felt the young man was showing his stupidity. .After the comment the entire audielllce broke out into a loud and approving clap. After the lectuare there was a re- ception on the th.ird floor of the Campus Cente:r. Ilere students and faculty had a dtance to ask Matta questions one-on-one and get more feedback about his presenta- tion. The young ~n attended the re- ception and waLting until the very end before goittg up to him again to talk. Profes!>or Me;ade, noted that the young man h.andled himself in a respectable mamnet and told Matta that he was a:ttcending the lecture in honorofhisfather.

The Daily Jol The recent {;Ontroversy over the forum of the Union College version of the Daily Jolt Web site has raised some serious issues that deserve consideration, none of which may be easily decided. As an organization that could not continue in the absence of the Freedom of Press, Concordiensis is well .aware of the impor- tance ofthe First Amendment. We are aware, too, ofthe damage that can be done by ignorance and racism. What must be weighed, as in any Firs.t Amendment case, is whether restricting the rights of these few 1ndividuals who would act recklessly and harmfully, and as a result stlence the voices of many honest and well-mean- ing students, is justlf1abk. The resounding answer in most cases would be no. The First Amendment does 11ot exist solely to furtherpopularviews,. for if it· did. then it would truly defy its original intention. That said, this is S•us les lois: ~·t! e no ordinary First Amendment issue, but rather a unique situation \\' .a.... A...\ in which the biased individuals are pennitted to spread their un- .

I ' OP/ED Miranda Rights: Opposing Viewpoints by Luke Wocbensky Contributing Writer Some ofthe benefits,ofiiving in a country with-a clear an(f fol- lowed Constitution are the sev.eral ri~hts that it grants :us. Many Americans are unaware of several of these dghts, however, and so they have the potential to be abused. Two rights that most of us are familiar with are the right to remain silent when arrested _and the right to an attorney for trial. We are familiarwiththem because of the 1966 Supreme Court I)eci- sion that forced law enforcement officials to tell suspects their ••Miranda Rights.\ Now the Su* preme Caurt isconside:ringtaking that police.stipulatien away. First, the police should be re• quired to tell people these rights because there is a possibility ihat the arrested person dee:s not know them. It should be the police's re- sponsibility to m~ke sure that the suspect knows his rights. We have an innocent -until p-roven guilty policy in this .country. and. it is hot the job of the police to trick pe.ople into incriminating themselves. H requires them to prove that the suspect is ~uilty. Also, this verbal execution is a constant reminder t~ police that they have to respect these impor- tant rights. Another positive ben- efit from the Miranda case is that our generation has become famil- iar with its rights. I admit that most ,of the people who are arrested prob~bly know them,. however why do they knowth.em? They know them becau:se.they ~re required to be read.

Submitting is.fi'ee, just email: conc()r<f)'ctl. vu.union.edu Dear Editor: Jim DeWan's excellent report on the Semester Proposal in the April 6th edition ofConcordiensis unfor- tunately contained inaccuracies which could cause confusion. (l)The Semester Proposal, currently in the final stages of drafting, is to be voted on by the faculty this term. If the Fac- ulty votes against the Proposal, it surely wi11 not proceed to the Pres-ident and the Trustees. Whether it goes to the Presi- dent and Trustees is precisely what the Faculty will be voting on! (2) There has never been a vote on the continuation of the present Term System. There was, however, a vote to form a committee to study the Semes- ter System and formulate a pro- posal on which the Faculty could reasonably vote. This is what the SubCouncil is trying to do now. (3) The exact beginning and end dates of the school year and many other details of this sort w<>uld fluctuate from year to year, depending on the shape of the annual calendar. It is misleading to \state that school would always begin before Labor Day or that gradu- ation would occur in the fourth Sunday in May. (4) The Semester Proposal does not dictate that Depart- ments would have a year-long , thesis. Just as different depart- ments have different programs now, they would have a greatdi- versity of approaches under the proposed Semester System too. Some departments would have theses, some would not; some would have year-long (two-se- mester) theses, some might not. What the Semester Proposal does state are some criteria to To the sisters ofDelta Gamma- '\Think where man's glory most begins and ends, and say my glory was I had such friends.\ (William Butler Yeats) I amproud ofallofus ...

We do agree very much with two very important points which ave made in Jim DeWan's article.

Aca- demic programs and resources would have to be rethought, per- haps from the ground up in some cases.

Gfunk The Daily Jolt Forum: Freedom without Responsibility by Mario Cruz Contributing Writer The ability to post completely uncensored and anonymous comments on the Union College Daily Jolt is a privilege that has been misused, and like all abused privileges, it must be regulated. The Union Daily Jolt (www.dailyjolt.com) is a Web site, maintained by Tim Riley '00, with a \Forum\ that allows students to post anonymous and uncensored comments about anyone or anything in hopes of creating an arena for, open discussion and debate. On paper, the Forum is a fantastic idea, but in reality it has failed miserably. It's become nothing more than an opportunity for bigots, sexists, and homophobes to express theirviews without being confronted. Part of college and life is to learn to take responsibility for your actions. This learning experience does not exist on the forum. While the Forum does have some mechanisms to deal with inappropriate comments, there are many \bugs\ that still need to be worked out. For example, if someone makes a libelous comment, (a false one that maliciously damages a person's reputation), you can identify the computer from which the post was made but not the individual. In other words, you can damage someone' s reputation with no repercussions. In its present state, the F otum sim- . ply allows too much freedom. It's human nature to do something 'bad' if you know thaty~u can \get away with it.\ Would you leavethebook- store without paying for your books. if you knew that you would never get in trouble for it? I think I would! Even the faculty might get carried away if they had their very own F arum! I can see it now, \Has anyone else had Joe Schmoe in their class? Tha1 kid is a [expletive] idioC A lack of accountability is the major flaw of the Forum. This site is an embar- rassment to the school and is a potential public rela- tions nightmare. Anyone in the world, including prospective students, college counselors, par- ents, and Union Alumni can view it. Tim Riley and the people at the Jo.Jt have no obligation to change any- thing since legally, they have done nothing wrong. I'm not concerned with the law, however, I'm concerned with doing what's right. Tim Riley has an obligation to our community to pressure the creators of the Fo- rum to change its format. He should also remove the Jolt if it continues to be abused in this way. It's not a legal obligation, but a moral one. Some people argue that to make the Jolt non-anonymous would de- ter from the openness of its discus~ sions. I argue that very few \dis- cussions\ are held on the Jolt, rather, it consists of immature gos- sip about issues ranging from \who's 1he most fu * &ble on cam- pus\ to which females have the nicest \racks.\ At this stage of their lives, studen1s should be able to confidently attach their names to an opinion. If they can't, then perhaps the statement needs to be thought out more thor- oughly. Or perhaps they should ask a more confident person to speak on their behalf. Tim Riley's initial response tp this situation was that \ifpeople watma be stupid, let them be stu- pid. No need to get so worke<l up over it.\ Another user agr-eed, claiming that racism is a part of life that we should all just \deal with.\ I argue that to \deal with\ racism is to tolerate it Racistcom- ments spray-painted on a wall in the Campus Center Would 'be la- beled as a \hate crime,\ however, racist co:mfilents posted on the Daily Jolt are acceptable? Union College is one of the best schools in the nation, conseq1:1ently, our graduates will eventually hold powerful positions inolti nation's educational, legal, and medical systems. The fear is tnat these people, when confront<!d with rac- ism will just \let it sli<ie:' This is not just a Union College issue, since one da,y we will all be out there iJ1. the 'real world' making impor- tant decisioas. Some argile that to regulate the Jolt would be to hidethereality of Union College. I argue that the .p~sts on the Forum arenCJtrepresen- tative of typ-ical Union College students. I've done my best to get to know as many studeats as I possi~ bly could during my- career at Union. The Jolt does not reflect these experiences. Someone' s got to be held ac- countable for the col11ll1ents on the Jolt. Obviously, tile students should be responsiblte for what they write, but since lle has pre- sented us with this OJportunity to make malicious and lmcensored comments anonymoasfry, I feel that Tim Riley is indirectly 1·esponsible for tl:te posts on the Forum. PLEASE, Don'tgetmewrong. I do NOT believe that 'TiiD is a bigot, however, he has beea iJJ;esponsible and apathetic in resp()nse to a very serious situation. A responsible maintainer would have taken seri- ous steps to remedy the problems with the Jolt. Tim says thatin bring~ ing the Jolt to Union, he had only positive intentio~s, and I believe hini. But once you realize that your plan has failed, and that people are disgusted with the Forum, shouldn't .that make you want to push for some changes? Here are a few suggestions; 1) Eliminate completely anonymous postings ot 2} collaborate with Uniort 's Office of Computer Services to develop a more accurate way to track down people who make offensive posts. Perhaps people should need to enter their ID number as well as a log-in name and password to post on the forum. · Ifthese changes \kill the forum,\ which is Tim Riley's fear, then so be it. If we are uninterested in conversations that don't involve immature gossip, defamatory remarks, and foul language then we don ;t deserve to have a forum like this in the first place.___ What I atn asking you all to do (this includes everyone, even faculty and administrators) is to ·visit the Jolt, www.dailyjolt.com, and go to the \forum.\ If you are disgusted, as I am,. I'd ask you to E-mail Tim Riley at rileyt@union.edu to express your dissatisfaction with the fontm. It's the least that you can do to improve our COJllffiUnity. 0 I I up cal paE in: tot: rea ter ba1 the be an ad pe de ill) re1 Fe se aJJ sp th .sil ci a~ Y< ta T bi Sf h si \'\ tl 0 p 0

L~st Thursday(April4) Campus Security attempted to silence two groups of students peacefully dis- tributing literature about the labor history ofSodexho-Marriott, which currently mns Union's food ser- vice, in the Campus Center and west college. This action was and is an outrage. But it is less outTageous for the actions ofCatnpus Security- who believed they were simply follow- ing orders, falsely said to have come form the dean of Student's office. Than for the fundamental principles these actions brings into question. On one level, they force us as a community to ask just how com- patible the educational principles Union stands for mesh with the corporate attitudes and goals in- creasingly pervading American education at all levels. This ques- tion in turn raises the more prag- matic but e.qually fundamental question ofwho- or what- actu- ally is in chare at Union College. In a sense, these questions were answered by Dean Alford, who quite correctly informed Campus Security at the Campus Center that students have every right to dis- tribute whatever legal information they please. While we applaud Dean Alford's actions, they were less courageous than obvious. Union is an educational institution founded on and conunitted to the free and disinterested dissemina- tion'(~fknowledge. Free speech is fundamental to that mission. Neither Marriott nor Campus Security nor anyone else for that matter has the right to tell any stu. dent what lega.l information or speech he or she <:an advocate or distribute, any more than the ad\ ministration can or should do the same for the college's teachers. Imagine the outrage ifMalTiOtt had tried to stlence a class on corpo- rate responsibility, for example: to do this, or to silence students simi- larly promoting their ideas, so ob- viously violates Union's educa- tional mission that it seems to us sc-arcely to merit an argument. But what is particularly disturb- ing about this iucident is that Cam- pus Security DID silence one group of students at West College. At whose behest? Apparently it was an employee of Marriott itself who had called security in an at- tempt to silence the students' opin- ions. And here we see the prob- lem: the needs and ·desires of a corporation contracted to facilitate Union's educational mission con- flictdirectly with the mission itself. The question then becomes not just whom Campus Security serves, but whether Union's basic principles are compatible with Marriott's. What does it say about ihe philosophical health of the col- lege that students enacting its most basic virtues need not Ad- ministrative approval for their ac- tions, but A<dministrative protec- tion for them, protection from an outside, contracted corporation? Who is in charge here: a corpora- tion for whom free speech is en- tirely contingent upon the genera- tion of profit, or the college for whom all else is contingent upon free speech? We again applaud Dean Alford for reaffirming what the college should be all about. But he can't be everywhere at once, and free speech should be. We thus call upon the Administration to edu- cate all contractors and contracted employees about the fundamental mission ofthe college and to in- sist that nothing interfere with that mission . Any corporation or group that can't coincide with that mission has no business ~ literally - on this campus. Union should make it rigorously clear that on this cam- pus at least, the bottom line is and will remain principle and not profit. AndyFeffer Associate professor of History Hugh Jenkins Associate professor of English Amanda Carr '02 President, Campus Action Ari Pa.pagapitos President, Amnesty International Call for Equal Learing Opportunities at Union by JordanLippman Contributing Writer Unsubstantiated claims about learning disabilities (LD) and attentit'>n deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD} include the idea that these disabilities are 'made- up', witb mo basis in reality. COllege professors and students think that students \With LD and ADHD have manipulated the system to do as little wmrk as possible and to get an unfair advantage over the other harder-working and more capable students. These claims lead to attitudinal boundaries and the stigmatizatien of college students with LD and ADHD. Since many of these beliefs. are based on ignorance, the following description of these disabi1i1i:ies and college students with them should.dispel the above- mentioned myths. Over the past few decades, the number of students with learning disabilities (LD) and attention deficit;...hyperactivity disorders (ADHDor ADD) who have applied and been accepted to institutions of higher learning bas greatly increased. Union College, like many other colleges, has responded to legis !a tion making reasonable accommodations for students with disabittities .and by ___ providing nec~ssary auxiliary aids to education. Itis clear that-students with these disabilities often need support services :as well as accommodations in order to succeed. These students must experience the demands-of college life before they can realize the kind of support they need. Dyslexia does not involve reversing letters. According to Dr. Sally Shaywitz, of the Yale Center for the Study of Learning and Attention,. dyslexia is an encapsulated la11guage deficit. Spe9ifically, it involves a deficit in ph()nological proc.essing that makes it difficult t<J learn to read, write and use language, and is often surrounded b-y significant strengths in reasoning, problem solving, concept fonnation, critical thinking and vocabu.lary .. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder does not involve a disorder of attention. According to Dr. Russell Barkley, ofUMASS Medical School, ADHD is caused by an underlying deficit in self- regulation that manifests as an inability to inhibit emotional, cognitive or behavioral responses to stimuli. Dr. Barkley states that ADHD is a point of performance disorder, meaning that even if people with ADHD know what they should do, they will be unable to do it. Re.cently, scientists have identified specific neurochemical, structural and functional differences in the brains of people with ADHD. The findings from these studies may provide concrete evidence for the validity of the disorder. The most persistent and universal problems experienced by college students with LD and ADHD are a low self-concept and poor self-esteem. In college, these students often become frustrated and depressed when their performance fails to meet their ·expectations. The fear of being stigmatized by friends and professors for having a disability causes many students with ADHD or LD to attempt to hide their disability from others. Failing to self-identify and receive academic accommodations is the most negative, counterproductive, self-defeating and detrimental coping strategy employed by college students with LD and ADHD. A proposal of changes in the support services offered by Union was wtitten based on the charac- teristics of Union College, knowl- edge ofthe experiences and needs of Union students with LD and ADHD and research about ways to promote the success of students with these disabilities. There are four main recommen- dations for change at Union. The first recommendation consists of a. summer transition program for in- coming freshman students with LD or ADHD. Second, a faculty ad- vising program for students with LD or ADHD during their freshman and sophomore years. The third recommendation con- sists of policy changes such as providing 24 I 7 access to aca- demic study locations such as the Library or classrooms. Fourth, some course additions including \The Freshman Experience Course,\ for interested freshman, an intermediate level psychology course called \Applied Cognitive and Educational Psychology,\ and finally an interdepartmental general education science course called \Disabilities that Impair Learning.\ These are all appropriate andre- alistic changes because they in- volve the expansion of existing services and they do not require drastic changes or large sums of m0ney. One of the benefits Union will enjoy are economic benefits from higher retention and graduation rates as well as the ability to attract applicants from a growing pool of qualifred LD stu.dents. By helping these students at a time when they need it, they will have positive instead of frustrating experiences at Union. Consequently, these students will he more likely to .give back to the college after graduation. Research has demonstrated the effectiveness of all of these approaches to supporting these students. As a consequence of expanded support, these students will receive higher GP A's, higher levels of self-esteem, they will develop posttlve coptng strategies, have a smooth . transition to college and they will develop their strategic and self- directed learning skills. As an institution of Higher Learning. Union has a moral and legal obligation to provide all accepted students equal access to education, and in order to that more support must be provided for some students. Increased awareness of the variety of learning styles had by students with LD and ADHD will lead Professor's to adapt a more structured and multisensory style of teaching, which will benefit all students but is necessary for students with LD and ADHD .. It cou]d also be argued that it is necessary for students at a selective institution ·Of higher learning~ such as Union, to have access to the academic study locations and resources in the library twenty-four hours a day. Faculty, deans. alumni, and students must work together to promote the success of students with LD andADHD.

In the wake of the storm, lite[\- ally, I thought it absolutely neces- sary to comment on the weather. Obviously, it has been very bizarre lately, to say the least. I mean,_h()w often is there a winter storm wam- ing the day after the forsythia and the daffodils finally decided to bloom. I feel badly for everyoGe who was somewhere very warm three weeks ago, or even all th<Jse who spent Winter Term in Barba- dos. Coming back to this must be quite a shock. I guess there m-e many things on which one could blame this h(<)r- rible spring snowstorm. I am sure La Nina might have something to do with this, or Global Warming, or any of those buzz phrases tllat indicate an environmental disaster. Personally, I think that the seasons are changing in general and that in a few more decades, spring will start in June. However, all of these possible reasons are unsubstanti- ated and hold little water. They also do not point out a clear solution to the problem. Do people actually think that recycli:ng a can of tuna or saving the air con- ditioner for only really hot days will adjust and control the .seas<ms'? Maybe it will, but the problem is that not enough people adhere to the environmental-saving changes. Someone once told me that at the end of the day you should co•unt your blessings and your pennies. The person who told me this was my great aunt and I was ten. At this time there were about seventy years separating the two of us. And like any ten-year-old not only was great aunt slightly scary but I re- ally did not care about blessings or pennies. Being ten, I was more interested in jumping in the big pile of leaves that always seemed to sit i.n her front yard or hoping that after a nice bowl of ice cream and right before my parents would pick me up she would slip me a five dollar bill. Being ten, ice cream and jump- ing in leaves lwlds ones interest much better than advice about pen- nies and blessings. At twenty-.two, however~ ice cream still holds at least my illter- est but in what I considered a sign of my ever-growing maturity level I would much rather get aclvice than say jumping in a big pile of leaves. Advice, however, unknovvrt to me at the age of ten is very much like the big pile of leaves that sat in the front yard of my great aunt's house. Unless the leaves where in the big pile you could not jump in them. A single leaf by itse 1fdoes not constitute a pile. At any time the leaves and the pile coul<l blow :av .,t any moment. Advice like .~~\' :; . · e of leaves is finite. Y oet for a finite \thing\ advice always Juice Inquiring In any case, whatever the prob- lem, cause or solution may be, I think it sucks. I brought home'.my skis and my snow hat and gloves, so lam completely unprepared to walk even to the Campus Center. So, once <~gain, I have cabin fe- ver, but in the middle of April'? Go figure. At least I have time to get my homework done and to write this article that is giving me a forum to vent my frustrations.

People throughout history have always been giving out more Jaberwokyesqne Blither · bad advice than good advice. I have no examples but I am ninety· nine percent sure that more bad advice is given than good advice. Why is this the way it is? Well, for starters people like to give advice because it makes that individual (the one giving the ad~ vice) seem smarter. People give bad advice ifthey want to manipu- late a certain situation. Lastly they give bad advice if they are truly ignorant of the situ- ation that they are giving advke about. Advice is like a drug if you will. Some people needed to give it out. They can not help but add their . opinion. All the time you hear, .. Well ifi were you this is what I would do.\ It is the people who blindly fol- low this bad advice that you needed to watch out for. These are the unpredictable ones. S0 what, then, is the point'? T11e point is one will always receive good advice when they are not looking for advice at all. It is at these times like with my great aunt that the best advice is given. Advice at these times should be taken to the heart. So at the end of the day you all should count your blessings and your pennies and remember that the only good advice is the advice where it helps you out by Oave Martin Contributing Writer Note: Article is as is.

Adverb Asian Persuasion Turns into a New Play Thing by Philip Cho Staff WJ.iter The day I never thought would come has finally arrived. A day I have been welcoming;, but yet have been dreading at the same time. Asian Persuasion hasachieved its duty, and it is about time that I say farewell. Asian Persuasion will have a special place in my heart, · but it truly is time to move on to better things. Do not fret. Although indeed Asian Persuasion is finally over, its sister, Play Thing, will take its place. I know that it will take time to get used to her, 1Jut please wel- come her with open arms. She is younger, more innocent, and not as refmed as Asian Peisuasion. How- ever; she will be .a spirit that will quickly warm the heart. Just be sure to be gentle, for her steps are yet unclear.. But I ltave faith that in time, she will flnd b.er niche. As I begin a new, chapter in the life of my writing, I cannot help but cling on to that which I have · grown accustemed. But, in her own way, Play rung has her own alluring style. She is much younger and innocent, and I hope that I will not corrupt her from what Asian Persuasion taught me. Play Thing is really a silly 1 warm-hearted 1 uncontroversial col- linin, the very opposite of Asian Persuasion~ who tended to be loud, brutally honest, and controversial. Play Thing 1 being more sophisti- . cated and shy, will be hard to grasp for so many who got used to Asian Persuasion. One will have to \read between the lines\ to really under- stand what is being said. This project will be the birth of some- thing new, something; risky and daring, because I am entering new territory. As I was walking towards the Campus Center early one morn- ing;, I saw a family ofbunnies hop- ping about in the grass. I was pleasantly surprised and excited to The squirrels would be forced to leave. We would, of course, give chipmunks immunity so that they would be able to stay in the area. [ have no problem with chipmunks. They are small, civil, quiet animals who mirtd their own business. Squirrels, on the other hand, are way too aggressive. /'\ peace treaty would be in or- der. Bunnies would be given ma- ,--____..,_,..,.... _________ ~ jority status, while chipmunks . ''Th·e • students at ,union ·ai-6-:too ~ much like the squirrels~'' see a new species finally make some progress in the world of Union C<Jllege other than those damn evil squirrels we always here about in the paper. It is clear that the squirrels here en campus are out to get the wh<>le lot of us. Bunnies, on the other hand, are cute, fluffy, and fun. I would like to see the whole squirrel popula- tion wiped out, and to see the bun- nies take their place. That would create a peaceful, happy atmo- sphere where everybody could get along. The squirrel regime must end! Let us rep lace them with bunnies! • Bunnies would make a happy ad- dition to the Union community. would be given minority status. The students at Union are t<lo m11ch like the squirrels. The bun- . nies and chipmunks cannot fully trust us until the student body it- self makes some changes. Only then can we kick out the squirrels and get the bunnies and chipmunk.s to sign on with us. We can trust t:hem, but can they trust us? Since Ollf relations with the squirrels have deteriorated, how are we ex- pected to be trusted by our new found allies? The only avenue I see to strengthen bunny ties with the gen- eral student body is to organize a coup where all the squirrels ar.e thrown out of Union. Then the bunnies would have the opportu- nity to pounce and grab the terri- t()Iy that they deserve so much. Get the idea? If you are keen, you will pick up wh:at I mean. If not, then read it again, and you will see what I mean. Have fun with the article. It's not like I'm going to tell you the answer. That part of the job was finished when the chap- ter on Asian Persuasion was closed. Anyway, my time is now up, S<l I bid all a premature ado. - .,,

Reed, a former advisor to Presiden- tial front-runner George W. Bush, and his consulting company Cen- tury Strategies declined to com- ment, citing the ftrm 's policy of not discussing their clients. Reed also was the recent direc- tor of the Christian Coalition. Clearly, both Bush and Reed share the same ideologies in many respectssuch as gun control, abor- tion, and public prayer. The hiring of Reed is a biatant attempt to gain leverage in a po- tential Republican administration. Microsoft has sustained a lawsuit for a number of years, fighting the Department of Justice on charges of predatory practices and having a monopoly in the tech market. If Bush. is elected president, Microsoft is banking on the B~sh­ Reed relationship to either drop the case &r ease up on the penal- ties.

News Analysis: Clinton signs Historic Social S.e-curity Legislation New law shows confidence in economy; allows Seniors to earn more while still maintaining benefits · by David Gruner Stq/JWriter After some deliberation, in both the House and Senate, President Clinton signed into law a bill that repeals the current Social Security retirement earnings limit that has greatly disabled the elderly. On top of removing the earnings limit, the law will initiate an Internet service allowing anyone who wants to get an estimate of poten- tial retirement benefits. The new law is a great feat for all Americans; allowing the elderly to continue to earn wages without having to worry about losing it to Social Security because of their age. Specifically, it grants that senior citizens aged sixty-five to sixty-nine will no longer lese one dollar of So- cial Security benefits for every three dollars they earn above the earn- ings limit, which is $17,000perper- son for the year 2000. For too long, Washington bu- reaucrats have restricted opportu- nities for today's senior citizens simply because they are over sixty- five-but with this new law they have given back individual freedom and the essence of the American dream ... prosperity.

Reed, a former advisor to Presiden- tial front-runner George W. Bush, and his consulting company Cen- tury Strategies declined to com- ment, citing the firm's policy of not discussing their clients. Reed also was the recent direc- tor of the Christian Coalition. Clearly, both Bush and Reed share the same ideologies in many respectssuch as gun conh·ol, abor- tion, and public prayer. The hiring of Reed is a biatant attempt to gain leverage in a po- tential Republican administration. Microsoft has sustained a lawsuit for a number of years, fighting the Departrnent of Justice on charges of predatory practices and having a monopoly in the tech market. If Bush is elected president, Microsoft is banking on the Bush- Reed relationship to either drop the case or ease up on the penal- ties.

News Analysis: Clinton signs Historic Social Security Legislation New law shows confidence in economy; allows Seniors to earn more while still maintaining benefits by David Gruner Stqf!Writer After some deliberation, in both the House and Senate, President Clinton signed into law a bill that repeals the current Social Security retirement earnings limit that has greatly disabled the elderly. On top of removing the earnings limit, the law will initiate an Internet service allowing anyone who wants to get an estimate of poten- tial retirement benefits. The new law is a great feat for all Americans, allowing the elderly to continue to earn wages without having to worry about losing it to Social Security because of their age. Specifically, it grants that senior citizens aged sixty- five to sixty-nine will no longer lose one dollar of So- cial Security benefits for every three dollars they earn above the earn- ings limit, which is $17,000 per per- son for the year 2000. For too long. \Vashington bu- reaucrats have restricted opportu- nities for today's senior citizens simply because they arc over sixty- five-but with th1s new law they have given hack indindual. freedom and the essence of the American dream ... prosperity.

The President went on to explain, along with a bipartisan Congres- sional delegation, the reasoning for the earnings limitation in the first place and why that reason(s) is no longer necessary. Ever since Social Security was introduced in America, during the Depression era. a retirement earn- ings limit was applied so as to make available jobs for the young and allow the elderly to enjoy their last years after retirement.

And that will certainly enlarge the bank of the government, add- ing to our already established sur- plus. In return, the government should pass legislation that again gives back to the Americans as seen in the removal of the retirement earn- ings limitation. Alongside the actual legislation, there will be a new Internet service allowing Americans to estimate their future benefits. \Our new Internet service ... will accomplish step one ofretirernent planning: helping workers to an- derstand the amount of Social Se- curity benefits they can expect in retirement,\ said Kenneth S. Apfel, Social · Administrator. It will enable those planning for retirement to broadly calculate what s/he can expect when they stop working. In the midst of an election year, there are usually little if any bipar- tisan feats as significant as the aforementioned. If America wants to continue its role as a leader and economic su- perpower, it must stop current par- tisan pettiness and take bipartisan initiative, following the Social Se- curity lead. Otherwise, the ambitions pre- dicted at the turn of the century not be as driven.

The attack occurred in May of 1999 during the bombardll:J.ent ·of .Serbia by US and NATO forces. The strike on the embassy bas been attributed to errors in the mapping and confirmation of a sus:peci:ed arrfis depot. As aresultoftheoversigh.t, three 2;000-pound bombs crash~d into ·- the embassy, killing tlrree and in- juring twenty. Shortly after the bombing~ the US gave a detailed explanation ofhow it thought the errors occu:tr:e.d. Defense Secretary William Cohen was one of the first to declare that \it was not a human err()lr or me- chanical error\ that result~d in the tragedy. ··'-·Instead Coheti blamed the e.tror on the process by which tll.e target was selected, saying that \it .was an institutional error.\ In the investigation sho.1tly after the bombing it was detern:a.ine<i that the first mistakes were made when a -CIA officer mislabeled the ad- dress for the arms center on a 1997 Pentagon map. The mistake in labelin.g the ad- dress, according to CIA officials, was the reason for the dii;;missal of a mid-level officer on Tha1rsday. The officer intended to find and mark an address on Bulevar Umemosti, to a location on the map. According to the CIA, the ad- dress was misplaced wh.en the of- ficer wrongly estimate<l how the streets were numbered. To make matters wors.e, the two buildings, according to Ii1ilitary, re- sembled one another from an aerial view. Once satellite ph0otogfaphs helped to confirm the similarities between the two buildin.gs, the ad- dress was transferred illto a coor- dinate form that could be loaded into smart bombs. The mistake in targeting the building was also overlooked hy thr~e bodies responsible for accu- racy; connnand units from where the planes departed, oV'erall com- mand in Germany, a11d · finally NATO.

The South Kor.ean President has stated that he wishes to con- sider proposals to bring the two governments together. However, at the same time, the Soqth Korean President has wamed people not to exp.ect tQO muc;h from the sum- mit. He feels th.at it is an important step towards .improving relations, but ·it is after all only a step. The South Korean President stated to his Cabinet Tuesday, \The national issues, which have been divisive for a half century, cannot be reso1ved overnight.\ It is. expected that the agenda of the summit will include talks about economic assistance, investment, and family reunions. The U.S., Russia, and China spoke positively about the sum- mit, saying that peaceful debates betWeen the two sides will be a positive step towards peace. Ja- pan was also supportive of the talks. President Clinton stated, \Direct dialogue between the two Koreas is something we have long advo- ~ated, and is fundamental to solv- ing the problems of the Korean lt:lJ!Jlediately after the bombing; :1---~------------------- peninsula:\ The Russian Foreign Minister stated, \Russia hopes the talks will open the way for peaceful co-ex- istence and cooperation between North and South Korea in a con- structive spirit.\ China stated, \Beijing has been consistent in seeking to preserve and advance peace and stability on the peninsula through dialogue.\ Japanese foreign minister Y ohei Kono said, \We strongly expect this meeting will lead to further progress in a dialogue between the South and the North, and to eas- ing tensions.\ ·on that same line, Japan decided to lift trade sanc- tions on North Korea. The world seems to be glad that finally talks between the South and the North will resume after such a long period. However, it really is uncer- tain what will happen or become of the summit andif the United States will become heavily in- volved in the summit although in the role. of a mediator. Since the peninsula of Ko- rea is a key military zone, it is sure that China, Japan, the United States,and Russia will bewatching its progress. The meeting between North and South Korea will more likely then not will be heated. There is a long history between the North and the South. As the South Korean President said, national is-sues between the North and South cannot be re- solved overnight. But, it is indeed about time that the South Korea and North Korea begin talks. Li Zhaox.ing, the Chinese ambas- sador to the United States made clear the demands of the Chinese Ethiopia in Grips of Famine govenunent.

Famine overshadowed as possibility of aid may be too little too late by Stepben Nemeth World News Editor The country of Ethiopia is once again facing the prospect of its fifth famine in thirty years, as the drought that has affected the coun- try ()n the hom of Africa will most likely result in the lack of a harvest in June. Already, the beleaguered coun- try has sent urgent requests to in- ternational aid agencies and other countries requesting over 800,000 tons of food to feed the approxi- mately eightmillionstarving people in the country. The numbei will probably rise as the continuing laclc of rainfall makes the harvest of crops increasingly unlikely. \Our food reserve is down,\ said Berhane Gizaw of the Ethiopian government's Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission. \We have managed so far, and I think we will also manage in April. The question is beyond that ... In June things are g()ing to be very serious.\ The United Staies, Canada, and the European Union have pledged aid but the amount assured mostly reflects aid previously promised. The West, as a whole, has prom- ised only a quarter of the amount needed by the country. Gizaw stated while Ethiopia ap- pealed for help, \Nobody has ful- filled any pledge so far this year,\ he said. ''Very little is happening, only in the media.\ The lteadofthe EU's Ethiopian delegation Karl Harbo, denied al- legations that the commission was dragging its feet, \I ama littleper- plexedanda little disappointed that anyone could doubt our commit- ment to the current situation,\ he said. \I have always insisted that we will do our traditional contribu- tion to the solution of the prob- lem.\ As with the previous famines of 1972, 1974, 1984 and 1989, the present famine has had the most ilnpact among children and the eld- erly. \The condition of the chil- dren is very serious,\ said Ahmed Ibrahim Hussein of the Ogaden Welfare Society. \Most ofthem are malnourished, suffering from measles and other disease, already weakened, and now they have nothing to eat and most of them are dying.\ The head of UNICEF, Sarah Vincent stated that her organiza- tion appealed for funds because they were, \particularly concerned with essential non-food items for children who need nutrition and who need health. It really is impor- tant that we get the life-saving health and nutrition equipment in there as soon as possible.\ Nevertheless. the scenes broad- cast from Ethiopia bear an eerie re- semblance to the same pictures. that moved the world to tears in 1984. The images from the country prompted an outpou.ring of sup- port and reliefto the country. But despite the massive movement of aid to the country, over one million people died in the 1 984 famine. Once again the pictures of starv- ing and malnourished children move us, and rightly call for our help. While we have an obligation to assist those that are less fortu- nate, perhaps we should reevalu- ate our priorities regarding that part of the world. We, along with our allies must make a conscious decision to sup- port and implement a system to provide dean water and to intro- duce agricultural techniques to pte- vent this type of calamity. The re- cent advances in genetic engineer- ing for crops both make them re- sistant to diseas.e as well as to harsh climates. In this way, we can not only assuage today' s problems but also prevent tomorrow's ca- lamities. -

World News CIA Attempts to Correct ''Institutional Error\ CIA fires one mid-level employee, disciplines six others by Charles Tuthill SJqffWriter On Satur-day, AprilS, the Central Intelligence Agency dism.is sed a mid-level officer and punished six others iin connection witll the bombing ()f the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. The aetac k occurred in May of 1999 dtuing the bombardn1ent of Serbia by US and NATO f.orces. The strike on the embassy has been attribated to errors in the mE!!.pping and confirmation of a suspected arms de-pot. As a result of the oversigbt, three 2,000-p ound bombs crashed into ~ the embassy, killing three a;nd in- juring lvlen ty. Short 1y after the bombing, the US gave ade1ailed explanationofhow it thougnt the eJTors occurred. Defense Secretary William Cohen was one of the first to ded are that \it was not a human error or me- chan ic.al error\ that resulted in the tragedy.

Mistakes in the maps were again to b:la;me for the oversig:ht of these tluee groups. According to reports shortly after the incident, the maps that the used to con finn the target list showed that embas:sy was lo- cate<l far from the address shown. The embassy, however, moved from it!s location in \old Belgrade\ to the very coordinates shown on the list. According to one Penta- gon official, the databases did not show that the embassy was near the selected target, \let alone di- rectly under the aim point.\ James Woolsey, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency dur- ing the first two years ofthe Clinton administration also commented the error. He agreed that the CIA has been · having problems with its maps and blames th.e creation of a new map- ping agency in 1996 along with flaws in updating the agency's da- tabases for the failure to spot the error. The bombing of the embassy, according to many sources could have been prevented by a measure that NATO could not or did not attempt. Had NATO used sources of in- formation within Belgrade, many believe that a confirmation on the identity of the building may have been possible. In fact, Chinese suspicions have been largely due to the fact that from the ground the building was clearly marked as an embassy com- plete with the Chinese flag flying overhead. The absence of spies on the ground is one reason why many analysts of the case believe that tragedy could have been averted. The CIA announcement that it would be punishing those respon- sible for the attack comes after Chinese inquiries as to the progress of the case. Immediately after the bombing, Li Zhaoxing, the Chinese ambas- sador to the United States made clear the demands of the Chinese government. They demanded an apology fi·om the US government as well as an investigation, and that the details of this investigation be publicized. Finally, the Chinese government asked that those responsible be severely punished. Eleven months have passed since the inc}dent and many Chinese officials have re- cently become impatient as to the progress of the investigation. Chinese military officials also expressed interest as to when the US government was going to pun- ish those responsible for the at- tack. A senior general, for example, broached the subject early in Janu- ary while on a visit to Washing- ton. The reaction of the Chinese gov- ernment after news of the penal- ties has been unclear up to this point. The Chinese ambassador expressed reluctance in voicing opinions on the matter until he had consulted with Beijing. The Chinese government, how- ever, is not likely to be content with the dismissal and reprimands given to the officers judged to be at fault for the error. Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing previously stressed that his government expected harsh punislunents for what many Chi- nese politicians see as a criminal act and a violation of Chinese sov- ereignty. <lirnuodrhnsi~ · April 13, 2000 ·Page 15 Two Koreas to Meet in Historic Summit Impact of summit unclear as questions still loom over key issues by Philip Cho StaffWJ·iter On April! 0, So1Ltll Korea's uni- fication minister announced that a South and North Krnrea summit will be held from June 12-14. The South Korea.n President will be traveling to Nonlt Korea's capi- tal of Pyongyang for this event. This meeting is seen as historic because South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung and North Korean President Kim Jot:ag 11 have never met since the peninsula became dividedin 1945. The two leader!i were supposed to meet about six :years ago under former President Jimmy CaJter's mediation but did. not happen because North K()rea's former President, Kim Il-Sung died.

Diplomatic talks between the U1Lited States and North Korea are diue to be held, but will now be done separately.

Already, the beleaguered coun- try has sent urg;ent requests to in- ternational aid agencies and other countries requecsting over 800,000 tons of food to feed the approxi- mately eight million starving people in the country. The number will probab1y rise as the continuing lack of rainfall makes the harvest of crops increasingly unlikely. \Our food reserve is down,\ said Berhane GizaV'V of the Ethiopian government's Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission. \We have managed so far, and I think we will aLso manage in April. The question is beyond that ... In June things are going to be very serious.\ The United :States, Canada, and the European Union have pledged aid but the arnount assured mostly reflects aid previously promised. The West, as a whole, has prom- ised only a q11arter of the amount needed by the countTy. Gizaw stated while Ethiopia ap- pealed for help, '\No body has ful- filled any pledge so far this year,\ he said. \Very little is happening, only in the media.\ The head of the HJ\s Ethiopian delegation Karl Harbo, denied al- legations that the commission was dragging its feet, \I am a little per- plexed and a little dis.appointed that anyone could doubt our commit- ment to the current situation,\ he said. \I have always insisted that we will do our traditional contribu- tion to the solution of the prob- lem.'' As with the previ()US famines of 1972, 1974, 1984 and 1989, the present famine has. had the most impact among chilctren and the eld- erly. \The conditi()n of the chil- dren is very serious,\ said Ahmed Ibrahim Hussein of the Ogaden Welfare Society. \Most of them are malnourished, suffering from measles and other disease, already weakened, and now they have nothing to eat and most ofthem are dying.\ The head of U NlCEF, Sarah Vincent stated that her organiza- tion appealed for funds because they were, \particularly concemed with essential non-food items for children who need nutrition and who need health. It really IS impor- tant that we get the life-saving health and nutrition equipment in there as soon as possible.\ Nevertheless, the scenes broad- cast from Ethiopia bear an eerie re- semblance to the same pictures that moved the world to tears in 1984. The images from the country prompted an outpouring of sup- port and relief to the country. But despite the massive movement of aid to the country, over one million people died in the 1984 famine. Once again the pictures of staf\:- ing and malnourished children move us, and rightly call for our help. While we have an obligation to assist those that are less fortu- nate, perhaps \Ve should reevalu- ate our priorities regarding that part of the world. We, along with our allies must make a conscious decision to sup- port and implement a system to provide clean water and to intro- duce agricultural techniques to pre- vent this type of calamity. There- cent advances in genetic engmccr- ing for crops bnth make them re- sistant to disease a'i \veil as to harsh climates. In this way. we can not only assuage today's problems but also prevent tomorrow's ca- lamities.

While The Velvet Under- ground was an incredibly strong pool of talent, much of its complex- ity and strength came from the songwriting ability of one unique individual: Lou Reed. Reed, who left the group in the early seventies, has spent much of the last three decades sharpening his cutting edge status by explor- ing new outlets for his musical cre- ativity.

t Arts & Entertainment <Umu:nrbien!lis • April13, 2000 • Page 17 Rotten Televison is Great lll ~lflO(.li~ • o.l,\,~. ,.1 C,r-rt'f~T D<•t'd<ljlrlif>lll (,!!;lt'l CDC Updates byDanCenti A&E Editor It's exactly the kind of ass kick- ing television needs. Amid the plethora of Aaron Spelling produced emotion manipula- tors, unfunny situation com- edies, and bloated dramas comes a program so pure in it's inception that it simply can't be ignored. Rotten Televisio11, which is hosted by the infa- mous leader of the revolution- ary punk rock group The Sex Pistols, Johnny Rotten, is prob- ably the finest and most enter- taining show on cable, in addi- tion to The Simpsons and The Sopranos. With attitude, absolutely ra- zor sharp wit, and unfailing cour- age (or brass, depending on how you view the show), Johnny Rot- ten interviews celebrities with a unique honesty, discussing topics as diveise as the low points of be- ing famous, to the best rock records. Hilariously, when Rotten talks with a celebrity he cares little for (which. is to say most celebrities), he bombards them with his trade- mark sophisticated rudeness. The response of the celebrity is often shock, which I suspect most people are tuning into the show to see. Surprisingly, Rotten is far more intelligent than most of tl:te people he interviews, and that's part of what makes the program work. The celebrities are used to reporters asking redundant questions over and over again, and with Rotten, they're taken completely off guard. It's not just the interviews though, each episode finds Rotten in a completely different adven- ture, going to bars, clubs, restau- rants, and other locales that can let his anarchistic nature go wild. In one episode, Rotten attends the Cannes Film Festival and success- fully pesters big name movie stars, including Kevin Spacey and Christopher W aiken. In one sequence in the episode, an MTV reporter approaches Rot- ten and asks him what he thinks of the Cannes Film Festival.

You can't even ask questions the right way! Go away!\ It's an honesty that we've never seen on television, and it'll make you wonder why Rotten has only now gotten his own show. Of course, one wouldn't expect anything Jess from the leader of a band that made defecating on stage (and sometimes on the au- dience) famous. ln the mid- seventies. their music was seen as an important step as a much-needed response to soulless arena rock. Often criticized for its Jack of complexity, the music The Sex Pistols shamelessly flaunted brought a fresh, raw sound to rock and roll, and has since influenced countless rock bands from all types of sub-genres. It's taught them that simplicity with emotion can be just as effec- tive as the most well textured mu- sic. Similarly, Rotten Television is just as raw, and could be taken as an antidote to crappy television shows. I have a fee ling more and more people are going to tune in very soon, and the mass audiences will either end up loving or hating Rot- ten.

Page 18 • April 13, 2000• arn.tttnr.hltm;is Science & Technolo New-Ways and Tools to See Our Universe by Alex Militello Staff Writer Imagine you are walking through a completely transparent building which encompasses a gigantic sphere. As you circle this huge sphere, you begin to get the feeling that you are becoming even smaller than you thought you were. Maybe you have just traversed a local group ofgalaxies Dr. Liu gave the motivation for the creation of this revolutionary museum, \the experience ofbeing there makes you feel like you are theie.\ Going on, he said that it is not so much the facts or the figures that get you upon leaving the museum, as much as the atmosphere and the enviro11111ent which generates the inspiring awe that really stays with you more than any other thing encountered since the Big Bang C>ccurred. The entire purpose for the newly rebuilt museum is to reinvent the \paradigm or system ofthought, with which we view the universe at the present time. We want to accurately represent a model of our universe which is more consistent with our current understanding of the world around us, according to Dr.Liu. The information that was avail- and all of a sudden you started to~~~~~---;-;:-:~---~-.....,....----~--~-~-='<' plummet faster and faster into the . heart of a black hole. The next step you take may be worth 1 00 million years of history, but the history of mankind has been stuck at the end, compared to the cosmos. What is going to happen? This was not an introduction to Hollywood ~s newest science fiction movie, but rather ah opening to the newly rebuilt Hayden Planetarium. In addition to the planetarium. the Rose Center for Farth and Space, wh1ch encircles the sphcncal planetarium, i~ another new addition to the American \1useum of Natural II !Story in WZJshington I>.C. Dr. Charles Liu, a tour guide for ....... the museum and\ researcher of The New Rose Center for Eatth and Space at the www. astronomical phenomena, gave American Museum of Natural History incredible lecture on this very topic to the Union College Physics Department this past Friday. However, the speech was not just about how amazing and wonderful these new buildings and exhibits are. The main point of this talk was to introduce these new buildings as a medium through which to discuss seldom-observed connec- tions. These links, which were discussed, connected fields of art (specifically architecture) to the more \exact\ fields of general science. Verses from Walt Whitman may be just as prevalent and important as the three-dirt1ensional Virtual Reality environment of the new planetarium, located within the top half of an eighty-seven foot diameter sphere. The opportunity to teach science is almost limitless with the use of this new technol- ogy within this remodeled museum. The actual building itself was redesigned and built from the ground up for the Natural History Museum by Applebaum and Associates. This was the same group that helped to build Qther museums such as the Holocaust Museum and the Newseum in Washington, D.C. within the museum. Apparently, one of the truly stunning aspects of the museum's architecture is the square building itself, 115 feet on a side, and completely covered on all of the light-exposed sides with the most transparent construction-grade glass made in the United States. That is to say, when you are in the museum at any time, day or night, you feel as if you are actually outside. Everything within the museum serves more than one practical purpose. The dome containing the two theaters (The Hall of Planet Earth on the top and the Big Bang Theater on the bottom half) from the outside is seen as a massive sphere which can be viewed as the largest star in the sky or as the smallest atom. This outside view depends on where you are stand- ing in relation to these various globes from the display called \Size Scales of the Universe,\ located around the spheres them- selves. The aesthetic design of the ramp heading downwards in a spiral starting from the Big Bang Theater heads right into an exhibi- tion space telling about what has happened within the universe able to us about the universe at the time of the Planetarium's initial construction in 1935 would today fill up the ftrst chapter in an Intro- ductory Astronomy class given to any freshmen. One of the indica- tions that gave the museum execu- tives the idea that something had to be done was the antiquated knowledge and perceptions of the universe which have been refuted since the buildings original construction, as stated by Dr. Liu. It is the openness of the museum which makes you feel like you are a part of this great expanse. Alluding to Walt Whitman again, as a preface to the pure experience which was the goal of this museum, he once said, \I believe that a blade of grass is no less than the jour- ney-work of the stars.\ Although Whitman dropped out of school at the age of thirteen, he could not have spoken more truly. Acknowledgments are extended to Dr. Charles Liu and his lecture, \The Art and Science of the New Hayden Planetarium.\ For further information on the planetarium see the M ay 2000 .Hue of Popular Science or visit the homepage of the American Museum of Nature It all started in Ireland with Dr. Ian Wilniut and his sheep, Dollie. Using experimental procedures · and highly sensitive lab eq_uipm.i:mt, • Wilmut and his team ofscientists · created th-e world's fu:stclone .. This was an amazing feat t:19t only for his ·lab, hut for the entire human race; While cloning represents tre- mendous strides for science, it raises both ethical and moral dilem- . mas. With the possibility that hu- man cloning might may follow the . cloning ofsheep, governmental and scientific communities went into an uproar. One of the first debates sta).ted between these two factions was over 1he legality of cloaing a living being.Does science have the right to done, or should the gov- cmmcnt intervene by setting regu- lations on private indus try? A free market economy has been established by our constitution. Many advocates for cloning argue that the g~·.,:emment has no right to re.gulate this process or any other scientific advancements. The right to free enterprise and busi- ness has been established by The Bill of Rights, however the right of the govemment to regulate inter- state commerce was established as constitutional by the Supreme Court. It Ls under this pretext that the federal government began to . regulate cloning. Many members of the scientific community, how- ever, believ·e that if the regulations in the United States become too strict then scientists will continue their research internationally. Supporters of anti-cloning leg- islation, sru:cb. as Beca Sallen, a freshman, claim that \students go to medical school to become doc- tors and not God.\ For some, this fme line will be crossed when doc- tors choose whom to duplicate. To believers of anti-cloning, this type oflegislation is extremely similar to Social Darwinism, however, weed- ing out the less able and multiply- ing the ••most fit\ is nothing new to this co.untry. In the United States, the mentally handicapped were sterilized to preventreproduc- tion. As a society, we mustbe care- ful of mortals having so much hu- bris that they feel they can decide who deserves the \benefits\ from cloning and who does not. On the o()ther side, there are u~;~.-•u•c; who feel that has -..Science & Technology Clonin tremendous benefits for socie.ty. Soon, transplant patients will be able to receive organs that were cloned and grown in a laboratory. Last year, a human ear was suc'\ cessfully grown and harvested from a lab mouse.The possibilities for cloning with regard to human health care and medicine are limit- less. This is why so many scien- tists and doctors argue that clon- ing is not a matter of playing God, but rather a key component of their job. Outside of the health profes- sion, as human beings we must use all the resources available in order to help the human race. There is a strong level of oppo- sition to cloning. The Christian community feels that cloning is an unnecessary part of hfe. They ar, gue that humans should not be- come immortal. ·rhey fear that once the technology becomes available, without proper regulations cloning will get out of controL If a parc11l looses a child, will they done her to fill the void in their heart? Will someone clone their favorite ath- lete or favorite dictator? There are many questions to answer, and while they seem legal in origin, there are also moral dilemmas. Does the world or America want to promote in a society that has the ability to alter the genetic makeup oflife? Geneticists have been able to done animals and take apart and study human DNA in great detail. Over ninety percent of the human gene pool has been studied, ana- lyzed, and marked for identification. While this progress is fabulous for identifying the genes associated with cancer and other diseases, the information can also be used for cloning purposes. Parents will soon be able to choose the sex; eye color, athletic ability, and other physical and mental traits .of their unborn children. This also has been con- sidered by oppossers to cloning as another way i:n which scientists and doctors will play God. Should a person have the ability, and more importantly, do they have to right to choose the traits and character- istics of a human being? These are difficult questions, but it is very important to address them before it is too late to decide what should be done, since these issues will have to be faced within our adult lives.

> . l l Union Track Sprints to Victory at UCAA's by FrankFiliciotto StajfWrtter The beautiful, sunny, and wann weather that had flirted with rema~g days of March and the fm>t week: of April was absent this past Saturday at tile UCAA Championships in \Near ~ Canada'' New York, otherwise know as Canton. Union track and field ath- letes, traveled four,.long-willded hours on Friday night with hopes that Saturday would prove to be an ideal day f<;)r competing. When they awoke bright and early on Sat- urday morning, cold rain poured from the heavens crea:ting puddles and soon-to-be lakes all over the track and field facilities. Later on that day, as it got even colder, snow began to fall. thwarting perfom1ances in all areas of the sport. Nonetheless, Union over- came the disappointing conditions and mus- tered up enough heart anci soul to fight against teams such as RPI,. Hamilton, and Saint Lawrence. In the end, the Union Women placed 4th overall with 70.5 total points while the Men placed 3rdovera11 with 87 total points. Simply said, the backbone of the women's team is its strength in the field events. Out ofthe total 70.5 points that the women scored this past weekend, the Field EventsTeam (re- ferring to the throws and the jumps) ac- counted for 54 of them. One could wager to say that given the small size ofUnion' s team, their field squad is one of the finest in the state. Major point contri:butor~ this week- end included Jordanna Mallach' s 2nd place finish in the pole vault, Melissa Matusewicz' s 2m;lplace performance in the triple jump, and Carrie Cielowski, Lindsay Pacuska, and Nicole Encarnacao's 1-2-3 sweep of the discus. Together, these three Katie Higley comes down the stretch of her distance ron. women produced 40 points alone in their respective events. Carrie Cidoowski won the Shotput, which tallied anotller 1 () points onto Union's scoring ballot. Meanwhile, the wome11 Dill tbe track had loads of fun trying to rac.e through 2-inch deep puddles with rain blowhng in their faces. Between their races, the Union athletes would crowd under a waterproof tarp set up by the Union engineering-runners. This tarp would prove to be key later in the meet when the rain became heavier and the morale fell lower. Nevertheless, the Union women produced fme times in the running events. Junior Amy Slabich finished 4th in the 5000-meter run with a time of20:08. Yes, that would be ,---------------------------------------------------------------~ 12.5 laps around the track in the pour- ing r-ain.. In the 100-meter dash, Katie Round and Ashley Rinear placed 6th and 7th, respectively. Finally, Freshman Katie Higley placed 3rd in the 400-meter run with a time of62.9, her best perfor- mance of the season. The Union men endured the harsh l·conditiOJlS as well and produced fine times despite the cold rain and snow. After the meet was done, Union relished in their victory over Hamilton who they had lost to just a week ago at Baj]ey Field. Senior Bryan Roy and Junior Dennis Sanabia provided 55 of the team's total points throughout the meet, including the 4x100-meterrelay. Roy's victory in . the tdple jump, and 2nd place perfor- mances in the long jump, the javelin, and the 11 o~meter high hurdles high£ighted the day for Union. Freshman Stephen Erickson won the highjump with a leap of6feet 2 inches and Tristan Boscardin placed 2nd in the pole vault with a jump of 12 feet 11 inches. Sophomores Atsu Kaneko and Jerald Whittington's per- formances in the 1 00-meterdash and the 400-meter hurdles rounded out Union j s scoring.

Page 20 • April 13, 2000 • CIInm:arbiensis Women's Lax Demolish RPI by Rachel Bukowski Sports Editor Due to snowfall, the Union Col- lege Women's Lacrosse Team was unable to take on SUNY Oneonta on Tuesday. However, theweather was not a problem this past week- end as the Dutchwomen took on some of the best teams in the na- tion and emerged with two more wins to add on to their already im- pressive record. . Currently, the Dutchwomen are ranked first in the UCAA league with an overall Fecord of 5-2 and a league record of2-0. They are vy- ing for another NCAA Champion- ship Tournament berth and they may be well on their way. Middlebury College, ranked the number two Division III school in the nation, handed Union its only defeat of the week. The Panthers scored the first six goals of the game before Union could respond to this tirade of shots on their net. The Dutchwomerr~s morale was far from gone, seen in their near comeback. Middlebury led Union by a score of 10-6 atthe stm of the second half when the offense ex- ploded with three unanswered goals to pull them selves within one.ofthePanthers. However, the sheer momentum of the Middle- bury women overpowered the Dutchwomen defense and the Pan- thers went on an 11-l run over the remainder of the second half. The final score was 21-12 in fa- vor ofMiddlebury, yet many Union LAX women should he com- mended for their performances in this challenging and exhausting game. Junior .attacker Margaret Merriam contributed four goals to the final score in addition to two assists, while Senior attacker Abby Harris added three of her own. Michelle Morrin played the major- ity of the game and stopped 16 of the 37 shots she faced. On Friday, the Dutchwomell. re- gained their momentum and crushed UCAA.rival RPI, 19-2, It was no contest from the very start, as the Dutch women Were leading 10-2 at the end of the ftrsthalf. The Dutchwomen showed no mercy to the Engineers in the second half, holding them scoreless while they put nine more goals into the RPI net. Ten of the Union women con- tributed goals tot he final score of the game, making this performance by the Dutchwomen a true team effort. Freshman midfielder Susie Bruderman had an incredible game with five goals while Harris added three goals. and three assists to the grand total. The Union defensewornen also turned in a commendable performance, allow- ing only 14 shots on net from the RPI offense. Union had a close caH the next day against Skidmore Col- Elizabeth Daigle/CP lege, but the Dutchwomen man- aged to just barely squeak by the Thoroughbreds by a point, 8-7 in overtime, Union was led by an eJ~.plosiveperfonromce·byMerriam who scored five goals, two of· which were in overtime and pro- pelled the Dqtchwomen to victory. Union was l~ading the game 6-3 with just under five minutes to play in regulation. It seemed as if the Dutchwomen had this prima- rily defensive battle in the bag when Skidmore put three consecu- tive goals into the Union net be- fore the final hom sounded sig- naling the end of regulation. Union was launched into an in- tense overtime competition in which Skidmore got off to a jump- start and scored the first goal. The Dutchwomen would fail to fall, however, and Merriam began to lead her team t() an incredible vic- tory. She scored the next two goals for the Union women before the final minutes of overtime ticked away on the dock to seal the vic- tory. Sam Ryall, Jessica Eaton and Katherine Rosenberg each con~ tributed a goal to the final score, while Morrin stopped 12 of the 19 shots she faced in net. Union's UCAA winning streak has now been extended to 13 games. Ironically, it was Skidmore who last defeated the Dutchwomen in UCAA competi- tion back on April I 0, 1998. This game was not ()nly exciting for the Dutchwomen, but it had a bit of sweet revenge as well. Freshman Katie Holtzman sets up a fast break The Women's LAX team will be at home all weekend, and it is the perfect opportunity to see these incl'edible athletes in action against UCAA competitors. On Friday they will take on St. Lawrence University at 4:00 and on Saturday they will face Clarkson Univer$ity at 1 :00.

Union Water Polo Club News by Bill Flick tlmtrihuting Writer On a blustery, windy and rainy day, the Union College Water Polo team set otJt to defeat Division I Buffalo State. With a smaller 8- member sqtJad. Union did just that, winning I 8-12 in front of a capac- ity crmvd ~~ the Roc hester Insti- tute ofTech:nology on Saturday af- ternoon. The gam~ started out the way most Union WaterPolo games do: winning th~ sprint and jumping to an early leadwithgoals from Kyle Schack (6), Drew \The Floridian\ Davitian ( 4 ); and Thatcher \The Snatcher\ Woodley (2). With Union winiling all four sprints through tlle use of their explosive national-ca!Jbersprinters, Ridgely Harrison an<i Bill Flick (3 got~ls), the Union team controlled the pace of the game. In goal, Nathaniel Martin was shaky at times, but rock solid in the final five minutes of play, seal~ ing the wim for the Dutchmen. Looking Ciutside to the wings, Adam Hetshman (2 goals) and JGhn Vandervoort, used precision passing to draw fouls inside the goal and create scoring opportu- nities. Defense was also key for Union, hGLding off a late surge by Buffalo State. With 2:12 remaining in the 4tlt quarter, Buffalo State had whittled the Union lead down to 13-ll. After a short timeout by the Unioil squad, Davitian reminded the team to spread the wings and double-cover any man near the goiil with the ball. By cutting .off any interior passing to the hole- mall, Flick and Woodley were able to create steals and use Schack ancl Harrison's speed in the of- fense to create quick counter...,at- tack goals, surging Union ahead by 6 goals as the final hGrn SO\Lnded. Throughout this contest, Union's superior swimming skills were displayed due to the coach- ing efforts of Davitian, Flick and Martin. lf any one is interested in join- ing ithe Union Water Polo tradition, practices are held at the pool from 5:()0~6:00on Tuesdays and Thurs* days.

Delta Gamma's Charter Revoked by Jessie a Brearta11 S(affWriter After twenty.two years as. an active sc;:>rority at Union College, Delta Gamma will be shl;ltting its doors at the end of the academic year diie to a decision handed down by the sorority's national o:r~ gani2ati<ln. The twenty-four members of Delta Gamma were infonned of tbis decision on April 7. The siste:rs initially appealed, but the decision was upheld by the national orga- nization.

Many members of the national org:an.ization are or have been af- filiated with Uni(}n College, and think it a wonder:fulplac~. The decision was simply based on tbe fact that tile small size of the sorority would put what the national organization felt was too much pressure on the members 0f DeJtaGarrnna. 1fhe sisters were understand- ably upset at the decision, but have been able to understand the ratio- nale bellind it. lt was only aJter careful consid- er;;tion, wi1h a great deal of sad- ness., that the deci:sion was made. Dean of Students Fred Alford exJ>ressed sadness over the tum ofcevents, saying that Delta Gamma wa:s .a \good noble organization and we will all be a little bit reduced noll: having them.\ He felt that ther were going out wiih a great deal' of dignity and grace, and .that.b.e foUlld their let- ter in last weeks' Concordiensis \very touching.\ The :logistical question ofhous- ing is {)RC 1hat is currently being dealt with. A ca 11 was put out to the. campus collilllunity announc- ing the availability of the housing last week, ~nd Dean Alford re- vealed that tile office was being deluged with applications for 1he space. As for the current members of Delta Gamma, many of those not graduatii1g have obtained housing on Seward A venue for next year, so that altholilgh they will not be living in the same house, they will still be dese to each other. Conn()Hy explained that this change of venue would. not change tll.e bonds that have fom1ed between thesisters as members of Delta Gamma. The membership is a lifelong one, so tl1e members will still expe- rience the benefits ofbeing a mem- ber of the sorority, though they ,.vilJ become alumnae earlier thanumal Their main sorrow is their ina hi 1- ity to offer D-elta Gamma as an or- ganization to future Union Chllege students, though there is a P'Ossi- bility of the mtional organization opening up a1ru)lher chapter attfie coiiege five or ten years from 11ow.

Erin Connolly was quick to ex- plain that Delta Gamma is fully in favor of Greek life at Umon, as well CiS the coming changes to it. The sorority has a zero~ tolerance policy for hazing, and supports both dry fraternities and Sophomore Rush. Neither the national organization nor the sisters of Union's chapter have any negative feelings toward the college itself.

McGuire Editor-in-Chief On Wednesday, April 12, jour- nalist James Burke spoke at the Nott Memorial. Burke, who received his MA in English from Oxford University in London, has worked in many ar- eas of education and the media. After completing his degree, he taught and directed an English school in Italy. In 1965, Burke worked in televi- sion as a reporter for a British af- filiate in Rome. He began work- ing for the BBC in 1966, and an- chored their coverage of the Apollo flights. He started his popular television show Connections in the 70's, and • '-o\ heen broadcast at various times since, including the 1990's. Burke managed to present his point of view regarding technol- ogy in the modem era and the way in which ideas and occurrences are related both interestingly and humorously. He explained that the modem era is the first in which such a mass of veople is aware of technology and can shape the future. He sa1d that we must see outside of our indi- -vidual context. As an example, he said that while the many people who believed that the Sun revolved around the Earth were proven wrong, if the Sun ac- tually did revolve around the Earth, it would look no different from our perspective. Once we are able to see outside of our box, we can understand how what we are doing now may influ- ence the future in ways that seem unrelated. As an example, he of- fered the story of a British naviga- tional problem in which the search for a solution ev cntually led to the invention of toilet paper. Another example that he pre- sented was Gutenberg and his printing press, which lead to the Protestant Reformation. Such mi- nor events that lead to enormous effects he deemed the result of a \Ripple Effect.\ According to Burke, a major ob- stacle to both full understanding of this effect, as well as taking full Co11ti1tued on page 5 by Mary C. Felton News Editor By simply glancing at the many signs posted all around the cam- pus center, Union students might notice a few advertisements for the upcoming weekends' events v-:ith little interest or enthusiasm. Luckily, this was not the case with the event put on by Union's Program Assistants last Friday night in Old Chapel. The two-hun- dred some odd students who filled Old Chapel's social space last Fri- day night were not only amazed, but enthralled by one of the most unique performances to take place on campus. Robert Channing, \America's Foremost Mental.ist and Psychic Entertainer,\ gave a one-hour dem- onstration: of his skills in the field of E.S.P. Channing spends a total of 227 days a year on tour displaying his talent across the United States and at over 2,00() universities, corpora- tions, c labs and other organiza- tions. He has also appeared in the media through NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX. and QVC. The evening began with a simple routine where Channing did a sort of card trick. He shuffled a deck of cards, and after shuffling them he passed them to a member of the audience. This audience member was then asked to place the deck in their left palm while turning over the left hand comer oftht? deck in order to get a glimpse of one card which they were instructed hy Channing to remember. Upon doing this, the student was asked to maintain eye contact \\'ith Channing, in addition to keeping their hands by their sides. The pack of cards was then passed to other audience members who went through the same pro- cedure. Channing stunned the au- dience \v hen he named the card that each student had looked at without having had any previous knowledge about the cards or the students themse !ves. The evening contmued. and Channing again showed off his skill by being able to replicate a drawing that a student vo lu 1teer Continued lJII page 6

However, due to various prob· lerns that arose with the installa- tion of the system, its activation has been delayed untitthe Fall Tenn. The new Union College ID, will not only ()perate with all of the functioas ofthe former ID but will give stu.dents .and administration admittance to specified buildings on campus .. In addition, the new card co..n- solidates a number .of services in: cludi1lg meal plan and declining balances, Bo_okstore accouats, li· brary codes and a new sixteen digit ISO code which, similar to a credit card nurpber, will allow for future expansion of the college and card use into ·l!.earby conunercial busi- nesses. Ensuring that 1,1ll of these num- bers correlate and are read by their corresponding computers (for ex- ample the cash register at Dutch or at the B()okstore} is the .main rea- son behind the del~ty in the sys- tem.

When the master keys were lost on two occasions last year it was \an eye-opener and a major head- ache for everyone involved,\ sta,ted Hayen. All of the locks needed re-coring and all new keys were ·reissued for the entire cam- pus. However, with the new system, any lost card would simply be de- activated and a new one issued in its place. Another advantage of the new system is that it also provides a twenty-four hour system that can put a limitation on the hours when the cards are functional. Fbr example, maintenance and cleaning staff will have access to dorm buildings only during their working hours. Campus Safety will also have listings o.f who entered a certain building in the event that some- thing goes wrong. '\If John Doe comes in one morning stating that he lost his card the night before and we find that it was used .a,t three o'clock that morning to ac- cess a computer lab where .a com- puter was stolen, it provides a good lead as to what may have happened,\ stated Hayen. Also, parents, wno haven't heard from their children, who are constantly calling Campus Safety worried about where there children might be can also be co:nsoled in knowing that their child entered the dorm at 10 PM that night. The use of the system for these purposes is not meant to cause paranoia, however. It is there as a trailer in the event of a problem and for the safety of the campus in mind. The installation is amajorsafety progression for Union. Other schools such as SUNY Oneonta are now calling UniQn to inquire about the new system. The system will probably be · implemented during the slirniner for those students residing or work- ing on campus for sununer pro- grams. The IDs will be issued in the Fall similarly to how the keys are disc tribtJted at the b~ginning of each year. Students will be given the ro·s by their house manager or RA and . will sign for them. Hayen did DOt want to specify or date exact-ly when the ID 's would be ready for summer students. Because of the circuitry in the ID, students will only be able to punch holes in one specific ·spot on the ID. However, the fun part is tbat you might be able to hold your card up to the sensor without act1.1ally taking it out of your wallet, bag or pocket. To guarantee that cards will be available for everyone in the Fall it is requested that students remm- ing in the Fall come to have •their pictures taken in the Reamer Cam- pus Center, room 203 on May 23 through the 26. Union NSBE Shares Poetry Housing Fee Controversy by Youseline Obas Contributing Writer On Wednesday, April 12, and Thursday, April13, members of the National Society of Black Engi- neers (NSBE) chapter of Union College participated in a nation- wide library program, Read Aloud. This program includes hun- eire~ ef volunteers from across the states which visit libraries and schools to promote reading aware- ness. Six NSBEmembers attended this annual event at one of the nearby elementary schools, Yates Magnet School located between Van V rankeu and Salina Street. The members celebrated poetry month with the students by read- ing and discussing poems by fa- mous black authors such as Sonia Sanchez, Niki Giovanni, Langston Hughes and many more. Topics ranged from Harriet Tubman to how to deal with differ- ent issues growing up in a single parent home, and individuality and acceptance of oneself. The teach- ers, as well as the students, were eagered and overjoyed at the sight oftheNSBE members. Ms. Sample, a reading teacher at Yates. stated that \there was a strong need of positive role mod· els especially among the minority students.\ She continued to say that it in- spires the children when they see that students of their color and sometimes with similar back· grounds are in college and suc- ceeding. As far as the NSBE members, they felt that going out 10 the Yates school was a break from the every~ day monotony at Union. They also felt good about being able to giveback to their cotnmu- nity. by l(ristina Dorne Staff Writer This occurrence has been kn()wn to happen more than once.

Sophmores Amanda Carr and Ariadne Papagapito·s, Presidents of Campus Action and Anmesty International, resepctively, orally presented their proposal of ben- efits for the campus to join the WRC, and drop the Fair Labor As- sociation (FLA). The two groups are part of a larger organization knows as United Students Against Sweat- shops (USAS), founded in 1998. The goal of the USAS has been to decrease the amount of apparel being sold on college and univeristy campuses. Union is one of many schools that has joined this fight against sweat-shop manufactured cloth- ing. The proposal was tabled and will be decided on at another meet- ing on April27. There is a committee currently looking into any costs that Union may bear from the switch. Accord- ing to Papagapitos, there are sev- eral compames 1n the Umted States that do not use sweatshops to pro- duce the clothing and the price would be the same, as well as the proper human rights standards. quality and style.

Vrooman critiqued the investiga- tion, through internal DOE chan- nels. It had no impact. Then he was ordered to remove Lee's secu- rity clearance. He refused. The DOE reprimanded him, demoted him, and essentially gave him a job at a desk facing a wall. Late last summer, his name and his views were leaked to the press. When the New York Times called, he went ·public- and resigned from Los Alamos. Why vv:as the government look- ing for a spy? In 1995, a Chinese national delivered to U.S. intelli- gence officials a design drawing of the W-88 warhead. Congressman Christopher Cox (R-Califomia) chairs a committee which there.- upon began to investiage how this technology came into Chiense hands. The committee's work was spurred by a mix of motivations: -The W -88 loss would be embarassing - but for which ad- ministration? It is still not clear on whose watch the loss occurred. -Any policy failure involving China is embarassing for the Clinton Administration, which re- ceived political heat for 1996 cam- paign contributions that may have originated in China. -And publicizing a Chinese spy would undoubtedly slow down or end any improvement in US~China relations. It was in this atmosphere that, in 1996, :the Energy Departtnent opened an investigation code- named Kindred Spirit, se~tching for the W-88 spy. According; to Vrooman \It was clear from.fue lle- ginp.ing that Lee was the prime suspect.,. . They reduced {the list) to twelve suspects with Lee as the only real candidate .. .I questicried why several others were on the list ... The lead investigator told me that he was sure that Lee was th.e one ... \ ifn other words~ in the DOE's :mind, Lee was convicted before any evidence was in. Michael S.

I fit 1he:ir matrix perfectly, andlwas .never interviewed and q u-es- tioned.\ (The Washington Post, 8/ 24/99) Ironically, the govertrment is now in the awkw~rd positio11 of having convicted in the press a man whom they can't con-vict in a courtroom.- presumably beca11se he's innocent. Instead, Le~ is now imprisoned on the extraordi11ary __ charge of downloading classified documents to his office compu.ter. If this were truly a hanging of~ fense, John Deutsch, the fmrner head of the CIA, would be in jail today as well. Deutsch, wlto re- signed in December 1996, wasl:ater found t() have seriously compro- mised critical CIA intelligence, 9Y leaving it on a home computer that was hooked up to the Internet. He received no punishment of 2ny sort. The contrast between tb.ese two cases is one more reason for the growing public outcry over the Lee case. Most telling of all: internal evi- dence now strongly sugg.es~ 1hat \the w-:ss information cannot !lave come from Lee or anyon-e else at LANL. The sketch provi<led by a Chinese intelligence agentin 1995 contained flaws, which were known to have crept into the draw- ings used by engineers outside- of Los Alamos who had recopieclthe original Los Alamos drawings C The Washington Post 11119/99). While \no complete inventory of docu- ments containing this data has been made or is possible,~' Robert Vrooman has said, a '\rather de- tailed description of theW -88\ was distributed to 548 different ad~ dresses at the Defense Department, Energy· Department, various de- fense rrrms, the armed services and even the National Guard. Based upon the design held by the Chi- nese, Los Alamos could not have ·been the source of the leak. And just how much damage has been done to national se<:urity, if any? Were the weapons designs a major advance for China? To quote the Los Angeles Times ( 12/219), \A Stanford think tank this week downplayed the highly-critical Cox report that claimed widesp:read weapons technology theft by China.

As evidence that innovative thought is preferable to Reduction· ism, Burke explained why we as humans enjoy jokes.

As the world becomes more interacti\'le he indicated that we need to let people think that way, as well. Linking ideas together, his core idea, makes technology less controllahle. In fac1, Burke believes that the only control that we should seek is that which comes with seeing the big picture, that is, how things change. We can then decide if we want to take steps, confident of the outc()me. Burke pointed out that events such as wars and the destruction of the Amazon Rainforest have re- sulted from a lack of awareness of the big picture. Burke said that technology will force us to answer many ques- tions, such as whether or not we want to nave direct democracy, or how we will deal with absolutely anyone being able to offer their own ideas.

Ctmtinued from page 1 by Hannah Gaw StaflWriter The fate of A.T. Miller was di- vulged last week when the profes- sor received notice from Piesident Hull that the tenure decision of the Faculty Review Board (FRB), which is responsible for approv- ing professors for tenure, was fi- nal. In a letter he received from the president, Miller was made aware that Hull \decided t{) uphold the decision of the FRB\ and that his stay at Union was to be terminated on August 1, 2000. Miller is currently in his eighth year of teaching at Union .. He came to Union in the fall of 1992 as a Visiting Professor. The following academic year, Miller was made Assistant Professor, and began to follow Union's tenure track. The purpose of tenure is to en- sure that there are safeguards built to protect the facultyofthe school with campus wide standatds for teaching, scholarsilip, and service. After three years as an assistant profe1'lsor, a faculty member is re- quiJed to undergo reappointment review. A review committee pro- vides the candidate with an evalu- ation, which is usually a positive review with recommendations in the areas needing improvement. Miller received sach a review in the academic year of 1995-1996. He now holds the position ofDirector of Africana Studies at Union. The process of deciding tenure usually begins in the fall term of the candidate's sixth year at Union as an assistant professor. However, Miller spent the fall term of 1998 (the beginning ofhis six:.th year) on a termabf()ad in Af- ric:a. Therefore, his tenure review began in the winter of 1999. To receive tenure, a candidate must give evidence of arr ongoing scholarly program. There are two sta:ndards; teaching and scholar- ship (research appropriate to the candidate's particular discipline), which the FRB looks at closely when deciding ten11re. A candidate must be \'excellent\ in one, and \very go<Jd\ in the other to receive tenure. The review com- mittee collects a great deal of in- formation to use wllen reviewing the candidate, for example course evaluations, course syllabi, and reviews from experts otttside of Union. Despite an appeal written by Pro- fessor Miller in the spring of last year, he was again denied by the FRB. At this point, he was waiting for reaffirmation from President Hull, who has the JlOWer to over- tum decisions made by the review board. President Hull made the follow- ing statement concerning the is- sue of Miller's sitllation: \As you know, I cannot discuss tenure de- cisions, however I can say that the procedures of the institution were appropriately followed in A. T. Miller's review and that the col- lege-wide standards that Union has set for the tenure ability ()f faculty, despite A.T. 's contributions, were not met in his case.\ Pr()fessor Miller commented on had drawn without having any the decision; \Officially I have mow ledge of the subject ofher il- been given 110 reason.

Page 8 · April 20, 2000 .. C!Ib11Cnrmem~is Sustaining WRUC The 1999-2000 sch()o] year marks a very important birthday on this campus. It is a birthday that urtfortUJilately will go unnoticed by the majority of students here at UnionCollege. This year Union College's radio station, WRUC 89.7 FM, turns eighty yeatsold. Why is the birthday of the radio station such an important event? First, WRUC is significant in the history of American radio in this country. Eighty years ago, WRUC had one-of the first br:oad- casts in the United States. WRUC was also unique in that it was one of the first stations in the country to broadcast actual programming. While other sta- . tions were only broadcasting sportin.g events, WRUC was able to provide its hsteners with both daily .and weekly programming. In· its prime, WRUC had a broadcast range of over 600 hundred miles, which extended well into Canada. Today, WRUC is one of the more popular clubs on campus, . maintaining over eighty-five members. These eighty-five students keep the station broadcasting for twenty of the twenty-four hours of the day. This fact was mentioned in the most recent edition of The Princeton Review, where WRUC was ranked number two for coliege stations, which is very surprising given. the lack of · ·support from the school. WRUC is supported' financially from funds allotted by the Fi- nance Committee, which is approved by the Student Forum. This year, WRUC was given a mere $20,000to run the station for the entire year. For those who work at WRUC this amount is barely sufficieat. If major problems occurred, the station would be tmt of business for that year. Union College is aplace which prides itself on the historyofthe institution. Next to the Reamer Campus Center is a statue of Chester Arthur, former student and president ofthe United States of America. The current Senior Class just ran a successful cam- paign to honor William Seward, a former Secretary ofState. Yet the station which, ifgiven support, could be added to the above list and used to the school's advantage w 11en trying to distinguish itscdffrom other schools that are similar to Union. l11ere are several easy steps the Union can and should take to restore WRUC to its pinnacle. The first step is to financially sup- port WRUC from funds that do notoriginate from student activity fees. By providing sufficient funds from an ()Utside source, the school not only guarantees the survival of the station incaseofanemer- gency, but also allows WRUC to make needed upgrades to the station. By also supporting the station directly, Union creates viable sell- ing point to incoming; students. Admissi<ms is always claiming that they want ways to differentiate Union fr>Om other schools. This is a way to do it. WR U C, if given the funds, could provide alterna- tive activities for the student body, much like what other school- supported stations do. The school needs to support the station as a sign to the students that they do care about the well being of the school and its stu- dents. If they do not, they are only hurting themselves in the long run. EDS Letter Policy& Discl- • 0 ' 1._'_ . :- : .• '.

For fi.vemonihsth.e family of you11g Elian has fought over the future of this six .. year-oldboy. <m · one side is Elian's great-11ncle in Miami,. who currently has custody of the boy. On the other side is Elian's, father, who wants his son returned to Cuba. However, the issue;. like most issues today, has become much more than a simple custody case. For those of you who do not know .of the case, here is a short history. Eliau and twelve people, including his mother, boarded a small boat headed to the United States. On the way from Cuba the boat ran into some rough. seas and sanlc Elian was saved when his mother placed him in an inner tube. Elian was found in this inner tube by Some Florida fishermen the one of tluee survivors of tlie twelve people who left Cuba. The fisherman who were good Samaritans brought Elian to the United States. This, of course, is where the trouble started for all involved. Eliari; smother was divorced from his fa:ther. When Elian's father found out that his son was still alive.lte of course wanted his son returned to him. By this time, how- ever, Elian was out of the hospital and living with his great-uncle and cousins in Miarrii. I~ was here that Elian. became the poster clrild for the()ibans ofLittle Havana in their fight against Fidel Ca:stro. From here it was only inevitable that the governments became involved. The Clinton Administration has pushed for the boy's retUrn to his father; saying. that only he can speak for.his son on immigration matters. The boy's Miami relatives say he-will have a better life in the United States and have attempted to portray Juan Gonzalez as a pawn ofFidelCastro, In response, Castro has called Elian a hero of Cuba and the country has held many rallies and marches in support ofElian's return. So now that you know what is gomg on, how does it affect you? Well, first off, Elian;s great-uncle will not return the boy to. his fa- ther, and is now appealing the courts ruling to return Eliart to Caba. Lazaro Gonzalez is spend~ ing the taxpayers' money to fight this court decision, a decision that the majority of people in this coun- try support. Secondly, under United States law Lazaro,, as the great-uncle, is too distant a relative to be consid- A M~fr-cmv. ered a legal guardian. So, in reiil- ity, Lazaro GotlZalez has no legal leg to stand on. While Laz.a~o might have Elian's interests .at heart, he is using this boy to fmr- ther the cause aftheCubans in. tlhe United States. Since the Ba)¥ ()f Pigs invasion the Cuban ex.ile;S in the country have been calling fior the overthrow of Castro. Any amd all issues that help their figh.t in their eyes is used to furth.er the cause. Another ~teresting angle to this case is that if Elian had. l»eoen say a Mexican boy, who cr~ssoed over the bon;ler he would luve been deported instantaneously. Is that fair? No, but the truth <Jfthe matter is that what would have l:utp- pened. Why it has not happe11:ed in this case is because Elianin Cu- ban and Cuba is a Commurnis.t Country and to some people thrut still means something. So what shcmld be. done? The Federal Marshalls should enf.orce the law. They should take Blian away fonn his Miami relatives ilnd return him to.llis father. Onc~thts happens, both Etian and father wi1l return to Cuba and the case ~ill ])e closed. Should Elian l:>e returoed? Yes. Would his life be better hoere in the United States? Wko can say?

This treaty is the embodiment of an agreement that the two countries have been work- ing on for fourteen years. The treaty between the coun- tries was originally signed in No- vember, however due to some of the information included in its pages, the United States was wait- ing for permission from the Chi- nese government to declassify the treaty and release it to the United States Congress. According to the United State's Constitution, the president has the right to create treaties. However, the treaty must then he approved by two thirds ·of the U.S. Sehate. The Clinton Aclministratitm fi- nally received permission to re- lease the \Agreement on Market Access Between the People's Re- public ·Of China ahd the United States of Arnetica\ on March 15. The treaty has been described by various congressmen as a very specific outline of what can and cannot be traded between the two countries. In addition, this treaty will clear the way for China tojoin the World Trade Organization and the regulatory agency .in Geneva. If this treaty is ratified it will grant China permanent normal trade sta- tus. The most significant aspect of this treaty is that it explicitly details in print 1hat'China will allow capi- talist businesses to trade in most regions oftheir country. Themost common capitalist businesses .that they will allow are insurance com- panies and next-day courier ser- vices. . This past week, a problem has confronted tl:te Clinton Administra- tion. The House Democratic Leader, Richard A. Gephardt, has declared that he will not support the treaty. The two tnain arguments over this issue in Congress have been two highly debated issues concerning the United States and China for quite some time. The posi- tive result of a treaty such a~ this one would be economic benefit for many American companies and the American economy. However, many government officials are not yet prepared to al?and.on their standpoint concerning the Chinese violations of international hutnan rights. This issue seems to be one that appears over and over again his- torically. When a government is taced with two options, one is self- ish and will result in economic ben- efit and the other is selfless and will result in benefit for humanity. Which one should be chosen? It is clear to many American's that our economy is currently in a time of prosperity. If we went ahead with this treaty we would be aban- doning the human rights ideals upon which thls country was founded. There is no price that can be attached to the value of human life, and the affiuentUnited State' s- based companies are just giving in . to greed if they are in favor of this. treaty. It is true that it is not the respon- sibility ()[the United States to be a: police force to the world. Yet it is also true that the United States is one oftb.e most:infltlential interna- tional countries today.

Submitting i::. tree. ju::.t cma il: concord\'(il 'u.union.edu ..... . ~ ' .. by Heather CampbeU Contributing Writer The roadways and parking lots of Union's campus need to be im- proved. It is much too easy to drive recklessly on campus,. and much: too easy to get into an accident. Irr fact, I was in an accident this past weekend in a Union College parl<- ing lot. Luckily, no one was injure<i:, but I cannot say the same for the side of my car. This is not an iso- lated incident. My car was hit Fall Tenn in a hit and run incident. And it's not just bad luck for me-l'm not alone. A girl was hit by a car on Sewarcl, My friends have almost gotten run over by speeding cars near South Circle. I've seen students finish chugging their beers, then hop int() their cars and drive away. These are all serious problems that need to be addressed by Campus Safety. But are they adequately act- dressed? While filing a report with Secll- rity, I mentioned that the location of my accident would be much safer with stop signs. Instead. of promising to look into a simple so- lution that would help lower t~e number of accidents and near-ac- cidents, the officer told me, ••No one would pay attention to them anyway.\ Surprised by hetcomnient, 'll!ad' · no response for the officer.

ln honor ofNational Health.food Day, which should be today but . isn't, I'd like to take a few mo- ments to reflect on nutrition throughouthistory. Unfortunately, since I have only been e~ting for twenty-one years, I will only be able to comment on the last two decades. In the 70's, good nutrition con- sisted ofa joint and a can of Tab. Red meat was IN and dinner par- ties with a Roast and a sweet Baked Alaska were OUT. Cheetos were the chip dujour, however my diet consisted entirely of Peaches and Pears babyfood. The 80's were a decade of lav- ish spending, ruffled lace, cocaine addictions, Doritos and Coca-Cola. For me, nutrition consisted of a blissful world of elementary school snacks and Mom's home- made family dinners. Take a trip down Memory Lane to recall mornings of Coca Puffs soaked in whole milk and toasty Ego's drenched in maple syrup. Those cool summer evenings consisted of Growing Pains and frozen veg- etables with a hearty onion Meatloaf. Little Debbie's Snackcakes and the entire Hostess lin.~, inclading Twinkies and Ding Dongs, de- lighted the face of every h110gry schoolchild. No meal was com- plete without a stick of delicious and zany Fruit Stripes gum, only because the free temporary tattoos were so \neatorama.\ The dawning of the 90's brought on a phenomenon that sucked in more people than Monica Lewinsky.

' I 20, 200(} •(!I.ntu::nrru.ensis World News News Analysis: Battle Looming o·ver China's .Entrance into WTO Gephardt, others looking for bipartisanship against entrance while businesses build coalition seeking Chinese acceptance by Philip Cho Sta.ffWriter President Clinton is attempting to pass legislation that will all()~ Beijing's accession into the W()rld Trade Organization. However, his ability to attempt this feat is be- coming increasingly difficult after House Democrat leader Dick Gephardt stated that he plans to oppose this measure. Not only will the opposition of Gephardt and the entire Demo- cratic leadership make it increas- ingly difficult for tht? White House in attempting to pass this legisla- tion, but President Clinton's deci- sion to defer sales of destroyers to Taiwan may also cause con:eerva- tive Republicans to retaliate and oppose this legislation as well. If Beijing threatens to declare war on Taiwan, supplying. tl:te is- land with weapons and military equipment would for Ch'ina be taken as a major provocation. This would not bode well for the United States. Senate Foreign Re- lations Committee chainnan Jesse Helms felt that the decision to ap- pease China, and sale of arms to Taiwan may \dovetail\ with t;he la- bor and human rights concerns, which could allow the H()use Democratic leadership to weaken the trade deal for this year. It is dear that whatever pressure President Clinton may bring; to House Democrats, it will most likely be outweighed by concern of go- ing into the election to try to keep organized labor happy with the Democratic party's prospects for winning pack the House. . The AFL-CIO is solidly opposed to a China trade deal on. the grounds that it does not give enough safe- guards for such things as human rights and labor standards. The unions fear that without these standards, manufacturing jobs will depart the United States and head to China's cheaper labor market. This sounds like deja-vu a1l over again with respect to pro-labor Democrats and conservative Re- publicans fighting against NAFTA. It is clear that there will be much bipartisan support within Congress against the introduced legisLation, which almost seals the fate of this piece oflegislation. The House is also increasingly aware of how Gephardt played a huge role in \marshalling the troops\ to strip President Clinton of his fast-track trade negotiation powers. The legislatio!l introduced in Congress is generally favored by President Clinton, Vice-President AI Gove, and Texas Govenot George W. Bush ..

Washington Urges Investors to Remain Calm Despite recent explosive economy, fang term trend seen as \quite positive\ by David Gruner Staff Writer While the economy has experi- enced unprecedented tu.rbu1ence recently, economic leadets remain upbeat with regard to the future of American prosperity. \It'll go up, it'll go down, but I think the long-term trends are quite positive,\ President Clinton said last week. On Friday, Aprill4,.theec::onomic fortune reached record lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 6 l 6 points, while the NASDAQ composite index fell355 points. et-a .com Alan Greenspan, Chairman qf the Federal Resene Board Yet, President Clint()n and U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Sum- mers said that investors should re- tain confidence in the American..- economy. Mr. Summers stated throughout the weekend, \I think we'll all do best staying focused o:n the long run and recognizing the real strength that this economy has.\ While the Clinton administration will continue to track the conse- quences oflast week's historic and anxious economy. they maintain their optimism that the real economy will continue to expand. Consumers are worried that the much-farger-than-expected rise in U.S. consumer prices that prompted Friday's sell-offwill sub- sequently cause an up-tick in in- flation. Yet, economic forecasters, such as Mr. Surruners and the Clinton ad- ministration, continue to laud the strong economy, emphasizing that it is in better shape than it has been in a long time. And with regards to inflation, Mr. Surrrrners answered, '\we al- ways worry about inflation be- cause being vigilant abou tinflation is how we kept inflation ander con- trol over all these years .. .I don't see any risk of a serious rise in in- flation in the months ahead.\ It has been nine straight years of unbroken American economic expansion, causing a booming New York Stock Exchange to llllfold and a recent budget surphts that has ultimately resulted in families be- ing able to afford rising tuition prices at private colleges and uni- versities. Yet, because the U.S. economy is growing at such blockbuster rates Alan Greenspan and his Fed- eral Reserve Board are increasingly worried about economic overheat- ing. And now that economy has ex- peri.enced dangerous losses last week, the Fef is warier than ever about Ameri<:a' s economic future.

This is ~hat has prompted men like Mr. Sommers and the Clinton administra. tion to address the na- tion and mtemational:markets with comforting voices. \We rue working very hard to ensure That inflation remains in check,\ Mr. Summers echoed throughout the global community_ As leaders throughout the world begin to unveil their agenda( s) fot the new millennium, economic se- curity is certainly prioritized. And being that America, is in the middle of a heated election year the de- bate has arisen with regards to how America, as a nation, is to achieve such a goal. The debate isn't over whether or n.ot to provide wealth through- out the world, helping the poor, and restoring dignity tp the White House ... both Republican and Democratic leaders are in favor of such goals. Instead, the debate is over how to make it happen. Whatever is decided and whatever political party resolves the debate is the party that will ultimately win con- trol of the Congress and the White House in November 2000.

A senior official in Ukraine's health ministry announced on Tuesday that the g()vernment' s · lack of money, its third-world grade hospital system and eco- · nomic condition is contributing to the deteriotttionofthe health of many of those effected by tli.e . accident. According to statistics, over 3.36millionofUkrail1e's50mil- · · lionpeople,including 1.26mil- lion children were ce>nsidered a f- . fected by the incident that oc- curred at the nuclear plant. Experts calculated that tb.e radia- tion released was equivalent to the explosion of 1,000 Hiroshima bombs. The Ukrainian Health Ministry calculated that over 4.5 billion only allowed the Ukraine govern- ment to finance only 85 percent of its stated payments to the victims in 1999. This year, Durdinets stated that the government would raise pay- meats to victims by some 24 million hryvna ($4.4 million) over 199~ levels. \We are doing everything we <:an to ease the fate of the millions who suffered fr1>m ra- diation disaster,\ said Dudinets.

However, this is changing as the Internet is slowly expanding to encompass a greater number of computer users within developing nations.

In the beginning, there were a few hopeful examples of greater participation u~ing the Internet under repressive conditions. Some marginalized groups have used Internet technology to further support for their causes. In Mexico, the Zapatistas utilized E-mail and Web pages to generate outside support, and to alert the foreign press of human rights abuses that were taking place. Without this tool,. it is doubtful that many people would have known about this situation. As the lnternet has expanded t() other parts of the world, however, it has provided reasons to doubt the assumption that it will be useful to oppressed people. In China, Internet Service Providers are required to register with authorities. Singapore regulates the Internet as if it were a broad- cast medium, requiring content providers to register with the state. India's practice of charging exorbitant rates for Internet access has restricted access to the Internet to those wealthy enough to afford it. Currently, the ability of govern- ments to regulate the content of the Internet is limited by its structure. Because of the vast number of messages that travel through one point at any given time, it is extremely difficult for any government to . track down messages which it may find objectionable.

Since that time, through conscious and unconsc:ious selection, humans have b~lped in th.e creation of over four hundred breeds of dogs with greater variability than a11:y other species, only with the exception of humanity itself. Scientists have been studying the genetic links between humans and their canine companions and have f.cund that sixty percent of canine genetic discrders have cGrresp<>nding genetic diseases within humans, including epilepsy,,. cancer, deafness, blindn.~Css,. autoimmune disorders, skeletl:ll :malformations, congenital heart -disease, neurological abnormalities, and bleeding disord'<irs. An()thei reason why scientists love to ~tudy the genetic makeup .of dogs is that because of the \closed gene pool and exten~ive pedigrees of purebred dogs, they are ide:at for mapping genetic diseas,es that have intractable in humams\ says Dr. Elaine Ostrand.er, head of the human ge- netics program at the Fred Hutclrillson Cancer Research Cen- ter in Seattle. Recently, the dog has been studie<i to understand how genes shape behavioral and physical characteristics, as well as genetic diseases. In the. pmcess of doing this, sdentists would be able to establish a genetic map which could.llel:inked to humanity's map, with vthc,m dogs share eighty to nine~ percent of their genetic code. Dr. Ostrander and her team of scienti&;ts have already begun to create a. map of the canine genome with ilte locations of hundreds of ma:r:kers of genes and nricros~tellites. These are the repetitive strands .of genetic code, with ~n l!nknown meaning, that are u:seful for tracking familiar inheritallce of traits and finding the genes. Another area of.research where canine genetic information is be.ing studied side by side with human DNA is cloning. Already, databases have been created containing cloned stretches of dog cluomosomes. The processes for these procedures and others like it are extremely slow and expensive, and there is not much funding for the study of do~s. This lack of fllnding can be made up for by :private firms and corporations, l.Jut until there is more interest im the area, the current research Will be hindered by theJow funds. Although the canine genome, like that of human, ·is estimated to have three billion pairs of DNA and 10(},000 genes, they are spread out ()Ver seventy- eight chromosomes, compared with forty-six ia humans, To date, about two thirds of the dog. chromosomes have. been identified, many of them by the Animal Health Trust in England. This imformation has · paved way [()r research concerning the linking of humans and dogs and their evolution process. The most spectacular research done with this information was a discovery in 1999 of the gene and mtitatiom responsible for narcolepsy in Doberman Pinschers, Labrad<>r Retrievers, and Dachshunds by Dr. Emmanuel Mignot, an assoe;iate professor of psychiatry at the Stanford University Sch()o] of Medicine. The discovery all<>wed insights into the study of httman sleep and other related disor.ders. While not all of.the human and canine genetic b1formation is related, it is a significat11t enough amount to speculate, and the more similarities that :are found, the greater the possibility that dogs and humans are more closely related than we th.l()ught.

Duchovny Shines in Return to Me Are lOu Experienced? by Jessisca Breart()n Staff Writer Very few romantic comedies open With the male lead ill a bliss- fully happy marriage to a woman who is decidedly not the female lead. She, we fmd out, lies in a hospital near death and struggling to breathe. Such is the opening and curious set up of the !lew film \Return to Me.\ Grace (played by Minnie Driver, who does her best to hide her En- glish accent) is a young woman beset by heart disease, waiting and hoping for a transplant. She is a woman who is moti- vated by dreams of things we all take for granted, such as riding a bike,. a thought that keeps her calm when slle is feeling especially mo- rose. Needless to say, the transplant takes place, but at a great cost. Elizabeth, the beloved wife of Bob (playedby David Duchovny), dies tragically, and though it is not ex- plicitly stated, it is understood that the heart that saves drace 's life belonged to Elizabeth. The bulk of the film takes place a year after the opening sequences, with a recovering Grace attempt- ing to hide the physical scar of her surgery and a recovering Bob try- ing to hide the emotional scar of the loss of his wife. Both do this to varying degrees of success .. Their friends and family try topush them towards the future ~nd pos- sible love, and the movie partakes in the staple blind date scenes and characters to moderate success. Grace and Bob lock eyes while she is waiting on him in her family's restaurant, amusingly named O'Reilly's Italian Restaurant, and soon they are sharing a tentative romance. The movie's title comes from an old Dean Martin song-· very appropriate, since the movie recalls a sweeter and more roman- tic time associated with that kind of music.

Other players who contriblllted to the first victory were Meredith Chace and He.pther Ligotino, who both recorded a double and a single for Union. Uni.on would pull out some late scoring and go onlo an 11-8 victory. In the second game, Ne~ Paltz did not seem focused or eager for revenge on the Dutchwon1en, as Union went on to win by a crush- ing score of 16-2. Union began the game in the first inning witlt a 10- run attack and the game was <ie- cided in this inning. Throughout the game, Cassie Lawton and Julie Cardettino both homered and doubled for U11ion, contributing to the 16-hit game, which, so far, is a season high for Union. Both players combined to drive in nine runs on six hits. Ring and Ligotino a1so homered for Union, driving in three more runs for the team. On Saturday, Utica was a bit more challenging for the Dutchwomen than the previous team and Union's hitting spree was not as significant because of strong pitching by Utica. In the first game, Jill Ring was Union's star, as she had the only hits of the game, two doubles, driving in three of th.e four runs for the team in the beginning of the third inning.

In another close meeting, Union led for most of the game wntil Utica tied it in the fourth in- tling at one. However, Utica got into another scoring spree, add- ing two more runs in the fifth and one in the top {)f the seventh to secure a win. Utica would win by the score of 4-2, breaking the Dutchwomen's seven-game win- fling streak. After 20 games, freshman Jill Ring leads the team with 26 hits, 19 RBI' s, and a batting average of .400.

Gupta was unable to play in the rest of the tournament, which strongly impacted the performance of the team. In the second round, Union was defeated by Hamilton 5-2, and then by Hobart in the third round 5-2.

' ' - - A - ~ \ \ - -· Semester vs. Trimester Crosstalk by Clare Can~ Staff Writer One of the distinguishing char- acteristics ofUnion College is its uniqae Trimester System. On Tuesday, Apri118~ the,Academic Affairs Calendar Subcommittee held a Crosstalk in Chet's to dis- cuss the recent proposal for a Se- mester system at Unjon. Every five or six. years the issue of the switch from the trimester to semester arises, Ina :recent official faculty vote, there was a slight majority to consider the switch. A committee was brought to- gether to research and design the fonnal proposal to be voted on by the faculty on May 3. Representatives ofthe commit- tee on the panel a:t the Crosstalk were Professors Ba:rhara Danowski of the Biology Departn.:lent, Teresa Ann Meade of the History Depa:rt- ment, Seth Greenbe:rg of the Psy- chology Departr:nent and Jim Underwood of the Political Science Department. The vote on the proposed cal- endar on May 3 is strictly a gauge that will he used by the Board ·Of Trustees, who have the deciding vote, in informing them of how much support the shift has.

Furthermore, class time would increase by an average of thirteen percent a week and total in-class course ti:me by 18.5 percent, but students would take a total of thirty- two courses over the four years at Union .as opposed to thirty-six. The developing proposal can be found on the web at www. union.edu/ Academics/ Ac a de mi cAff airs/Committee/ AAC/Calendar. The ~or:nmittee stated, \It is our hope thatthis document will serve as the basis for an informed dis- cussion concerning the most effec- tive academic calen_dar for Union CoiUege. While the faculty at Union have been aware oflhis issue for some time, we are particularly ea- ger for the students to join in this discussion.\ The forum was held for student's opinion, but attendance was poor. After waiting some time 'for the audience togrow and con- templating a rescheduling, the pa11el decided to C()mmence with the discussion. After a brief oven iew of the situ- ation by Danow si<i, Professor Me:ade v .. ·as the first to give her opinion. \The Trimester system is isolat- ing Union College. In a world where everyone is ·making a leap towards consortiums, we are standing still. We .arre out of step,\ stated Meade. Meade alluded to the electric mediums used for :higher educa- tion and the inability for Union to participate in many programs and opportunities because of its Tri- mester standing. Such programs include the Hudson Mohawk C()nsortium of sch.ools or partnersl1ips, similar to the joint program run by Williams and Hamilton at tht: 'National Insti- tutes of Health. Collaborating w itl1 ulhcr semc~­ ler-based Term A broads is also dif- ficult, resulting in a maJority of stu- dents going abroad in the Fall. Professor Danowski spoke next in support ofthc Trimester systt.'m \The Trimester.system allows more flexibility which is important in majors where there exists a rigid sequence of courses.\ Danowski also appreciated the uniqueness that the system lends towards Union, which helps it stand out from other schools in its class. In addtion, Dano,vski touched on the deere a se in tot a 1 crcd its from thirty-six to thirty-two, point- ing out the increased difficulty for a student to have a minor and the reduction of student electives. On the other side of the decrease in total courses, Greenberg liked the idea of reducing the total num- ber of credits because it would .in- crease class time. Each course would have more depth and therefore students would acquire a better understand- ing in basic foundation courses. Students would also have more time with research reports, allow- ing for more revisions. and help the library access more resources for ContiJ?Ued on page 4 Union Hosts Visiting Professor by Mary Felton News Editor :Every year, Union College's Phi- losophy department invites a phi- losopher to be one of Union's Spencer-Leavitt professors. The Spencer-Leavitt endow- ment has been in cxistem:c fur mer fifteen years, providing the Phi- losophy department with the op- portunity to invite prestigious guests from all over the world. Many people have been recipi- ents of this fund, whicp invites them to spend a nine-day residency al Union where they give public lectures, hold seminars and attend classes. Last year, Union invited two philosophers to split the resi• dency. This year· s Spencer-Leavitt pro- fessor IS Philosopher Susan H.aa<:k, a Cooper Senior Scholar in Arts and Sciences at the Univer- sity of Miami in Florida. Haack has written five books and various articles on the phi- losophy of logic and language, feminist epistemology, the philoso- phy of science, metaphysics, and pragmatism. Professor Felmon Davis com- mented on Haack's opinions and focus of study in these different fields. In terms ofthephilosophy of logic Haack has been interested in how inquiry, specifically scien- tific inquiry works. As Davis put it, \Everyone wants to know how things work.\ Standard fom1s of inquiry come as a result of power issues in society: In one of her wcuks, entitled \Manifesto of a Passionate Mod- erate,\ Haack writes, \Nobody seriously doubts the possibility, or the usefulness, of finding things out; that is something we all take for granted when v.c inquire about plane schedules, or the state of our bank accounts, or the best treat- ment for our child's illness, and so forth.\ She goes on to mention,\ Hon- est inquiry is really neither pos~ stble nor desirable.'; Her studies center on many ideas and thoughts that people come in to contact with on a daily basis. People do not often think to classify their daily questions as a form ·of what Haack may call in- quiry. ''Inquiry in the sciences is like otlter kinds of inqu:iry:-making con- jectures about some crossword entry, testing th.em against the clt:~es and other completed en- tries ... \ In terms of her beliefs in J:he fields of Physics, Bi'()logy, Politics, and legal systems, it is important tounderstand wnoiis in power and 1.\hat the goals are- of a political society.

Generally ~peaking, the theme of the house will be reading .. The house will be called Geisel Hollse. The members of the house intend to do community service in Schenectady, while at the same time making a place for their organiza- tion on campus. As freshman Allison Sturma,. one of the members of the house said, \We hope to be a benefit to Schenectady and become an iJLte- gral part of the UnionCollege com- mutJ.ity.\ The house mtends to organize and participate in literacy and read- ing programs off campus. This will be done in conjunction with oilier groups such as ROAR (Reachout and Read) which is run on campus by Hillel, The Literacy Volunteers of America, and The Mount Pleas- ant Library. Each of these groups targ-ets different categories of people;. Mount Pleasant Library works pri- marily with children, while The Lit- The fUture members of Geisel House. eracy Volunteers of America works with people learning English as a second language. The house's on-campus pres- ence will be composed of a num- ber of different elements. The mem- bers will be opening one of their common spaces up to the entire campus as a reading rpom. This space will be used as a study lounge and as a lending li- brary. During the times the house is open for studying, the members intend to serve refreshments. The lending library will be filled with used books that are donated to the house and books bought by money obtained through fundraisers. Struma explained that their goal was to offer books for fun reading. Although the library does offer Union 5-Year MBA Students Awarded Prestigious Fellowships by Carolyn Micklas Contributing Writer Two Graduate Management Jn- stitute students, Corrine Shiffin.an and Eric Nathanson, have been awarded post-graduate administra- tive fellowships at the Clevehnd Clinic (located in Cleveland, Oh.io) and Mount Sinai Medical Cernter . (New York City), respectively. Administrative fellowships albow students to jump start their care,ers by spending a year under the t11te- lage of top level executives at flag- ship institutions. Shiffman's undergraduate m~or at Union was psychology with a minor in economics wl1 ile Nathanson majored in modem lan- guages. They both received tlleir undergraduate degrees in 1999. Both students are part ofthe co.m- bined Five-year Bachelors-MBA degree program. Shiffman was one of three hun- dred applic~nts competing for three fellowships in administration at the Cleveland Clinic fromnati()n- ally recognized universities. The Cleveland Clinic, one of the world':,; foremost health organizations, has provided care for more than two million patients from every state in the nation and more than eiglhty countries. \Union's Five-year MBA })TO- gram gave me with the toots I needed to confidently pursue an opportunity with one ofthe top ten hospitals in the nation.

She did her internship with the Co:rporate Benefits Devel- opment Office at General. Electric last summer and continued to work there part -:time this year. Nathanson is looldng f01ward to working in one. ofNew York's most prominent teaching hosphals. Mt. Sinai is a 1,171 room tertiary-care teaching hospital, which last year provided care for 42,000· inpatients and nearly 300,000 outpatients. Originally intenton becoming a physician, Nathanson became aware of the possibility to pursue a career in healthcare administra- tion and applied to the Five-year MBA program. \As a student in this program, the small classes and e:ll(posure to health care profession- als in my classes helped me to gain thle knowledge I needed to pursue the career I desired.\ While at Union, Nathanson was active in MoWitebanks and theater productions of Cabaret and Blood Wedding.

McGuire Editor-ilz-Chief Last term, a group of students, in conjunction with· Professor Pe- ter Tobiessen of the Biology De- partment, renewed the Fly-Fishing Club that once existed at Union College. According to Tobiessen, the original club, which existed a few years ago, died out when the in- volved students graduated and were not replaced by then-current studt;nts. He added, however, that the current club would continue as long as there was sufficient inter- est within the student body. He emphasized that he is only a facilitator. Sophomore Rich Paulis initially approached Tobiessen this year when he was in one of his courses. The professor welcomed any- one interested in the sport to dis- cuss it with him. This eventually · led to the dub that has now been formed. Tobiessen mentioned that be- cause there is so much water in the streams now, it is hard to catch fish. Though the climate has prevented the club from actually going fish- ing yet this year. that has not de- terred them from n:vit:\\ mg the ek- mcnt::. oft1y-fi:,hing. On Monday nights at 7 P\1. the club meets in the Science and En- gineering Building in the Biology labs.

In regards to reasons for contin- ued trimesters at Union, Greenberg stated, ''uniqueness in and of it- self is nM such a prize.\ Underwood then proceeded in support of the Trimester system. \We are not unique but distinctive. The case to switch is long on as- sertion, but short on sqpport.\ Underwood identified many courses as opposed to having four. With respect to other schools that all operate under the Semester System Underwood simply stated that [the] \fact is that other schools aren.'t that good.\ This, however, raised the big- gestquestion. Ifall of the benefits of a Trimester system are true, why are only two percent of all College and Universities on the Trimester system? This is clearly why the analysis that the AAC is carrying out is so important.

Campus News Cltllllr.arme:u!!Sie • April 27, 20()0 • Page 5 Prejudiced Union: Results of the Election Study Qy MattbewRllpoport Contributing Writer Why is it so few students vote f~r student forum each year? How effec- tive.atc()mmunicating with voters are the signsone sees covering campus be- fore election time?· Are voter~ biased in any waysexua1lyorraeially? These questio11s prompted an independent study last fall with the hope of uncov- ering ways to improve the current elec- tion system at Union College. The study consisted of simulating an elec- tion to invesitagetherole sex, ethnicity and campaign advertising p1ay in.carn- puspolitics. Fictitious candidatesran for nonexistent positions and voters were asl<ed to select a candidate they believedto be a real student The ~e­ crecy of the study was ofthe gr¢.atest importance to ensure the sample of voters would not know ahead of time that they were voting for fictitious can- didates. Once this secret was discov- ered, it created a campus wide contro- versy. Many questioned whether it W!lS ethicalto keep.studentsin the dark to conducta study Jike this. Further- more;, SQme students even asked if a study li1ce this was n~eded at aU or what motivations lead Student Forum to appr()vea simulated election. Many felt betray~d by those in power and protested to Student Forum. The con- troversy made the ·front page ·of the Concordiensis and led to the largest attended Student Forum meeting since. Sophillore Rush. Eventually the con- troversy appeared as a story ih the Albany Times Union followed by a similar ()ne in the New York Times. The Concordiensis editors were even interviewed on National Public Radio about th.e role they played in the study and ift!Yey felt it was right to use their power as journalists for a study like this. WHY WAS THIS STUDY NEEDED: Obvi()usly a study like this has the potential to greatly help Student Fo- rum understand election habits. Fur- ther; we can only hope to discover means to getting more students in- volvedingovemrnent and achieving an unbiased vote. One easily wonders what prejudices effect an election. By comparing two alike candidates with ethnic differences one not only hopes to uncover biases but to discover why they exist at all. The same questions presented themselves with male and female candidates. It is easy to see why one would want to balance the scales of etlmidty and gender, but why study campaign advertising? lt is im- portant to understand whether phis- tering flyers around campus is an ef- fective means of communicating with the voter? Does this method ofadver- tising affect the voter? Should we as- sume voters actually receive an accu- rate picture of who they are voting for? HOWTHESTUDYWORKED: The study consisted of creating can- didates engineered to test three spe- cific variables: sex, ethnicity and cam- paign a<lvertising. These candidates then ran for newly created political positi<ms, ideally running against a mirror image of themselves with one major, outstanding differ~nce. For ex- ample, to test racial bias on campus, two candidates of the same sex with similat views, campaign strategies and other overall qualities ran against each other. 'Ihe only major difference be- tween these candidates was one pos- sesseddbviously ethnic characteristics in name and appearance while the other was quite domestic and generic in all qualities. The etlmic candid~te was provided a name, Pervaiz Sharif, which 'obviously conveyed her foreign. back~ ground. Her opponent, Chris Rogers, possessed a somewhat generic yet do- mestic name, Ev:en though pictures revealed both candidates to be female, it was intended' that sex wouldnotplay a role in the decision making •process. Advertising was ~lso kept as consis- tent as possible. Both c.andid'atesput up· the sarne number ofsignswith simi- lar slogans and statements. In addition to ethnicity, the two other examined variables, sex and cam~ paign advertising, were similarly tested, making each candidate as iden- tical aspossiblewith only one appar- entdifference. For the race investigat- . ing sex,. the names and statements of candjd~tes wete stt;;reotypically geared towatds male and female. For example, the female candidate Kate Farley con~ sidered herself a people person that wquld make communicati()n with stu- dents a priority. On the other hand the male canc;lidat,f John Widner was primarily concemedwith working hard and getting the job done, Again in this case ethnicity was never mentioned and ea<ih candidate ran a somewhat identi- cal campaign. Before We could inVt.>stigaie the ef- fect of campaign advertising on cam- pus we had to study how one actually campaigns at Union. There are no tele- vision ads to run and no radio time to buy. Generally, a candidate does not travel from dorm to dorm making speeches and I hav.e yetto read a cam- paign e-mail, so how exactly do pro- spective leaders getthemselves recog- nized?. Campaign signs are the main form of campus advertising and the day of al\j election they are plastered ev- erywhere around the campus. The other form of on campus is allowing each candidatea picture ofthemselves and a written ·testament in the Concordiensis. Other than a rare ban- ner here and there, c11mpaign signs and Concordiensis statements are the pri- mary form of advertising at Union. To investigate bow advertising af- fects a voter, a three-person r~tce was created. In order to prevent sex and ethnicity from playing a role, all can- didates were male with generic and do- mestic names and picjures. It was in- tended that one candidate have an ex- cellent campaign, another an average one and the third nearly nonexistent. Sothen how do you make one cam- paign better than another? One candi- date, Tim Trimborn, ran a serious, cre- ative campaign witb a..n obvious amount of effort. He made five different signs and put new ones up every day of the week. He also put up more than double thenumberofsignsofany otllercan- didate and wrote .a weighty and long statement concerning his goals if elected. The next candidate, Steve Newmann, ran a smaller and somewhat mediocre campaign making only two different signs and putting them up only three times a week. He put up as many signs as any other can·didate ex- cept Tim Trimborn and his statement was of average length The final candi- date, Greg Windsor, put up no signs and put a lonely sentence or two in the Concordiertsis with no picture. Once all candi<iates and positions were in place, students voted for them based on only the already provided knowledge of the candidates. After voting; each participant .filled out a short survey detailing who they voted for an why. Answers to why one voted for a specific candidate ranged from \I did my research and read the issues\ to \randomly flipped C()in\ and one voter even thought a candidate was \related to Chris Farley.\ THE RESULTS: Is Union Sexist? Gender plays a significant r() I~ in campus elections. By looking at Table l Actual Ballot Results ofMock Bec- tion we can see that in aN even cam- paign the female candidate, I<ate Farley,.beat out the mal~, John Widtier, by more than a two to one ratio, re- ceiving approximately two-thirds of the total vote. Many survey re- sponses'mentioned that a female can- didate was needed in apdliticalp()si- tion; however a female majority alre!ldy exists in student forum. By further examining the surveys and loold11g.at Table 2 Survey Results ofMockElec- tion Based on Gender, it is apparent that both males and females o-f all classes overwhelming supportedthe female candidate, although the per-cent of females voting forFarley was greater than that of males voting for her. So why was Kate Farley supported so overwhelmingly while John Wicliler was overlooked? Expl~nation ofTable 3 Though their campaigns were i<le- ally supposed to be the same there will always be some difference and prefer- ence among voters. Tables 4 'ani 5 both reveal that more people like<! I<ate Farley's signs and statements. 'This could possibly explain in Table 3 Fa- miliarity and Prior Knowledge ofCiln- didates why nearly ten more pereeht of voters recognize Kate Farleyth~n John Widner although it does llotex- plain why 75 percent of voters s!lid they personally knew Kate Farley_ I am dumbfounded as to how so ma11y people could respond that they knew a fictitious person. I even heard ru- mors circulating that the phony Farl·ey lived in West College and was a \W (JV/' girl. Although it does appear tlut Farley's campaign contributed som~­ what to her win, it does not ex])lain her overwhelming landslide. Some Sllr- veys mentioned the name Farley as a factor because it connected her to late comedian Chris Farley. One even mec11- tioned her beauty as a reason fm vot- ing. Explanation of Tables 4 a11d 5 H()wever all things considered, I<ate Farley received 67 percent of the vote because she was female. Even ifber carnpaign was better tahn Widner's it could not account for such a huge iJlar- gin of victory. Furthermore, m uliiple surveys designated her sex as a main reason for voting for her. Od<lly enough, in a country whose political system is dominated by males and w no only granted women the right to vote eighty years ago, Union is one eofle-_ge where females are favored. Uniort is ahead of its time and this could h()pe- fully mean -a more balanced political system in the future. Is Union Racist? Unfortunately, the political rac.e,in- vestigating ethnicity provides evid<etice that Union is not as revolutionary as it could be. The stereotypical, for~ign candidate, J>ervaiz Sharif, lost in ahllld- slide to the generic, domestic cll.ndi- date, Chris Rogers. Table 1 reveals that even though the candidates\ilVere ofthe same sex and had similar cam- paigns, Pervaiz Sharif lost by nea~ly twenty percent of the vote. Again, oddly enough sex did play a ro1e in this election. Table 2 reveals tha;tten percent more of males voted forCiuis Rogers, .probably thinking Christo be a male name. Interestingly eno-ugh, Tables 4 and 5 reveal that cam))aign advertising had little effect on tlte elec- tion with approximately the same number of voters liking and disliking each candidates signs and statements. These tables in addition to Table 3 ·J>TD· vide evidence that more people ·s:M Chris' signs and statements beca1.1>:e she had twelve percent greater reco~­ nition rate than Pervaiz Sharif. Evcm. considering all this evidence, whyc:litd Chris Rogers win by .a landslide? Chris Rogers received nearly si;'lirJ' percent of the vote h·ecause she is arr American. Although the main reason students stated for voting for Pen~i;;z Sharif was that they wanted to se€ ;a• minority on the ballot, obviously~tl:ti:S did not representa majority of voters:. One voter for ChFi s Rogers e,v en stated, \I chose the name which ap~ pealed to me most,\ It seems to many-, purely recognizing a candidate isagOo()d enough reason to vote for them. Jntcer- estingly enough, onthe same dayCilris Rogers was elected, the president of the freshman class won her candidacy with an ethnic name. This howeveris a far different case. Many more va.ri- ables such as qualifications, person;a]:... ity, responsibility,.campaigns, personiLl · knowledgeofacandid~teand even aca- demic reputatio11 wel)t into her win- ning . .It is a far different case from that of Pervaiz Sharif who has no prio;r record for voters to judge her by. J.f Pervaiz Sharif said exactly the san1e things and ran exactly the same can- paign but was named Jane Smith:,. it would have been .a much closer race. Unfortunately, even today racial a11d ethnic bias still affects the way we>ee and judge people. Does Campaign Advertising Work? In the third and. final election, Carll'- paign advertisingwas revealed to jJI.a)\ some role in an election but a very sm~IH role at that. T<lble l showed 1\i1n Trimborn, the ser.icus candidate, win- ning by a slim margin of two perce11t over his closest rival, Steve Newmann and only thirteen percent over his otherr opponent, Greg Windsor. Because01ll candidates were male, sex did not fac· tor into this election. However, fo~ some odd reason in Table 2 women supported Tim Trimb·orn !en perce11t more than men did. In Table 3' Trimbom's vigorous campaigning led to a small yet e:-.isterat lead in nane recognition. Further, Tables 4 and 5 led to another small yet existent lead in the number ofpeoP'Ie who liked.l'li> signs and statements. Nonethele:s; these numbers are so close that o11c wonders if they were in fact the deci d ... ing factor in his victory? We can only assume that Trimb()rm won by the small nllmber of voters who paid attention to his campaign. Considering Greg Windsor did near!}-' no campaigning at all and was still able to receive one quarter of the vote ins. three person election provides evidertce that campaigningbas little effect on a111 election. I say littie effect and not 111ll effect because in each .election the <:<t.n.- didatewhoreceived the most name rec- ognition won each time: Furthermore,. Trimbom' s campaigning m!Jst have hail some effect for him to win even :SID narrowly. Soshou'ldwewastetonsof trees plastering walls of the campus with election signs? Evidence shows a candidate cannot count so I ely on good advertisingto get elected. At the same time they must do some form of ad- vertising or 110 one will know who they are. Without some fonnof voter rec- ognition, a victory for any candidate is hopel.ess. What Has This Stt1dy Taught Us? Women on campus may have an ad- vantage over men. K.ate Farley beat John Widner by more than two to one. Obviowsly gender plays a major role in every election, but Union is not a typical example of the real world. Because some errors have skewed this data I recommend more research in this area tocQmpletely determine to what extent sex effects a political race at Union, Ethnicity also plays an unfor- tunately negative role in campus elec- tions. Someprejudicesexist in every- one, whetller we recognize them or not. Minorities are surely at a disadvan- tage agains1 a non-minority candidate, however, I do not feel as though this disadvantage is insurmountable. Re- cent minority victories provide evi- dence that campus politics are more than purely race driven. This shows we can eventually overcome any in- herent prejudices in an election sys- tem. Finally, campaign advertising has a very small effect on a campus elec- tion. Witil nearly seven hundred fly- ers put up around campus most vot- ers said they did not even see them. Perhaps not enough signs were put up to fair! y j u<lge advertising but all things considered simply plastering your name everywhere is not an effective campaign strategy. The wastefulness of current campaigning also leaves much to be desired. Furthermor:e, the extent that candidates can communi- cate with V()ters is very confined. Some other means of campaigning are defi- nitely needed to allow voters to better know and understand a candidate. Even with all this knowledge. other questions remain unanswered. Why d() so few people participate in elec- tions? Some say that a st-udy like this actually takes away from the election process and forces students away form campus politics. However, I wonder why so many who participated men- tioned \random. as a reason for voting for a candidate. How can we eliminate this campus apathy? Aiso, '>vhy did nearly 100 voters enter the voting booth and not vote because they did not know the candidate') Were these voters unwilling to decide unless they could make an educated decision or arc campus eiection simply a popularity contest? The bigger picture is v.hat this can teach us about national poli- tics in ge11eral. r do not feel Union typifies tile United States but we can draw some excellent understanding about our domestic political system. More research on a grander scale could provide greater insights and greater knowledge about the general politics of the United States. . Write\ for News!! Come to the .

6 · April 27, 2000 • <!Il1UCnrhleltsis Driving in Excess One of the most common complaints heard on this campus is that there is not enougll parking. One example is, ••Why aren't there more spots available by the loading dock area by th.e Cam- pus Center?\ When one looks at how small this campus is one begins to realize how JH>intless and lazy many of those who com- plain about parking reaJly are. · During the winter term it is acceptable for students to drive around campus because those who designed this campus thought it would be beneficial to make it similar to a wind tunnel, which is also complimented by Canada's arctic blasts. Getting back to the point, it is spring term and for the past few days it has been beautiful outside, perhaps it could be expected to see fewer students cramming their cars around the circle by the Campus Center, or fewer students driving in general. It is unfortunate to see someone walking out of the gym after a work- out yesterday aftemoon only to get into her car to drive home. At least three differenb~ars of people known to live on campus have been seen at the Ratskellar for lunch on Tuesday when it was gorgeous outside. Even those who reside off campus live within walking dis- tance. That brings up the question of what is considered \walk- ing distance?\ If it was up to a large part of the Union commu- nity to decide this, ami le might be too long. Yes, everyone walks from all corners of tile campus to go to class every day, but there are people who live ()ff camp us on U ni versi ty or Gillespie who drive to campus each day for their classes. It is as if the existen<:e of a car at Union, for many of us, provokes a great deal <>flaziness. Let's be realistic. If you are walking out the door of your residence hall to go check your mail and the guy who I ives across the hall is jumping into his· .car and offers you a ride to the campus center you are going to take it. Why walk when you can drive? Aside from the general issue oflaziness, the price of gas is on the rise and it is just n<lt economically sound to drive in excess when you do not have to. Concordiensis makes no claim to be superior because, like many students, staff members have driven to the Campus Cen- ter numerous times and cursed at Campus Operati()ns because they did not create en() ugh parking spots for us. Campus Opera .. tions' argument is that stadents should walk more and, in many ways, they are right. But for the sake ()f conservation and for the sake of spring term, the next time y()ll grab your car keys to drive somewhere think about whether or not it is really worth it for you to be in a car when the sun is shinning and the price of gas is continually nsmg. The weather has be awful for almost all of spring term and who knows if it will C()11tinue, but while it is nice out, think about stretching your legs and walking, your car will be there when you get back.

Many theme houses have been granted group housing on this campus in order to provide two things: alter- native living situations and alter- native social scenes. For the most part, theme houses nave been suc- cessful in providing alternative liv- ing !>ituations. I:n fact, theme houses have flourished on this campus due to the Seward Project and other group ho11sillg opportu- nities. Now it is time for this col- lege t<> take a more important step to insure better living on this cam- pus. For years we have heard many com})lain that Fraternities control some of the best houses on cam- pus. And to nobodies fault for certain, the nicest and biggest, free standing houses in :the center of campus are currently occupied by Greek organizations. The advan- tages these groups have are much more than just more aesthetically pleasing houses, but they also have control over tremendous amounts of social space. The truth remains that theme houses currently have little social space to hold any substantial so- cial events. This is no pity party for the theme houses and it is certainly no inclic1ment of Greek organizations. Instead this is a call ·to recognize the reality of unbahmced social space. It is true, that most Greek organizations have done a superb job in offering fun and popular so- cial events for the siudent body, and they should be commended for their efforts. Yet, this collegemust now take steps to incubate more and different social options. This college must let theme houses have the same chance to throw large social events. Lamont house is currently the home of this colle:ge's graduate program hut it was one~ a resi- dence hall for group housing. Its size, beauty, and social space rival the nicest houses on campus.

They are the machinations of a dis- gruntled sect, which is willing to sacrifice the rights of a family to make a po0litical statement.

Did you know that? I!m sure that if you were a currellt sophomore you did. I dicl:n'tknow it when I originally cameherebe- cause l didn't even think about it. I didn't know that the college had the right to keep students on cam- pus. I thought that I could tell the difference between donns that col- leges expect upperclassmen to stay in, and dotms that colleges expect freshmen and sophomores to stay in. The donns on this carll- pus qualify as the latter. Appar- ently, the last couple of years when they let juniors off campu~ they were just being nice. At ftrst, this does not seem like much of a problem because we have a solution: the newly renC>- vated Seward apartments. Unf()r- tunately for us, somebody in Resi- dence Lifewas.inerror. They gave one half of the Seward apartments to seniors who are allowed to get off campus, leaving only about . sixty spots, or eleven houses for upcoming juniors. So, what does this mean for our class? Well, somebody has to get \punished\ for the mistakes of Residence Life, it might as well be students .. That is corre~t, I said punisb~d. It. is a punishment to stay on carnpus, (Not to blame this with the cl:liTent ResLife staff, they seemed very nice, and easy to talk t<J, they just have not been given mucli. to work with). Why is this such a punish- ment? It is not unreasonable for an up- coming junior to wish to b.re off cam- pus. There are several benefits, like getting to sleep without noise be- fore 3 AM, and being able to go to the bathroom with nopody else around to hear the noises. How about just having a clean bathroom, not having to look at all of the stalls before deciding which one is the best, or should I say least dirty? One might be able to have a single; and in your hous;;e you are probably going to have cable tele- vision. You might even have a kitchen; not only a convenience, but.a money saver as well. To somebody who might be stuck in dorms for another year, this type of environment sounds like heaven. But, when one realistically looks at what we want by gettin~ off cam- pus, it seems like any logical thing th.at twenty and twenty-one year olds would want. If we had these things on cam- pus, maybe even some of theni, I would not care ata.ll about staying on campus. On c1mpus is not the part that\ troubles me. It is those simple things that are listed above, that anybody would want. This is true especially when you look at the price of apartments in the area aTound the college; You might even end up spending less on an apart- mentthan you wotdd on the dorms! I realize that the school has to make money, however we end up having to pay the price. If we opened the living situation into a totally free system, how many people would st~y in the dorms? Not many, according to the people that I talked to. That is probably why we doh 't open it up, which in a way is admitting that they have a monopoly over the living condi- tions. It seems funny that the school knows that they are taking our money unfairly, yet does noth- ing about it. Somebody will end up in a donn, and even though ev- ery one of us is thinking optimisti- cally~ it will happen. Yet again, a student will be unhappy about school policy.

' ' . Page 8 · April 27, 2000 · Cltnu.cnr.bien!<itll OP/ED ·· · ·· Oj);'r:tib.ill'IJ Oitl(~J.;:Js . ·~:~r ... Professor AddreS~es Caielldar Debate by James E. Underwood Contributing Writer The more than five-year discus- sion of replacing the three-tenncal- endar with a two-term semester system is finally coming to an end. Almost all parties are grateful for this fact, including especially me. My ptupose in this opinion piece is to argue for the three-term sys- tem. As an undergraduate I experi- enced the semester system and as a young faculty member at Union I taught in a semester system. In addition, I served as Dean of the Faculty in a period in :-vhich the college instituted our current Gen- eral Education Program, steadily expanded our study abroad pro- grams and gave greater empha.sis to faculty-supervised student re- search and other creative en- deavor. This is evidenced by the growing numbers of students pre- senting at the Steinmetz Sympo- sium, NCUR and other venues. These three developments (along with the steady improvement in the College's admissions picture, and the success of our honors pro- grams) have made Union a far stronger institution than it was ten years ago. In my ju.dgment, the adoption of a semester system would threaten to undermine all three of these elements, elements that in combination help make Union\ s academic program a stron- ger one than is found at most c-ol- leges to which we c?mpare our- selves. Furthermore, I believe tllat some of the features that are part of the proposed semester system would threaten other components of what makes our academic pia- gram a particularly rich one. Let me address these threats individtt- ally. Ar~ttments against a semester calendar l. Generally speaking, academic majors at Union are stronger here than tl1ose at comparable colleges. (When thi!'l is not true at Union it is the product of the small size of some departments. A seme~ter system would not do anything to addre~;s this fact.) The proposed reduction in the graduation Ie- quirement from thirty-six to thirty- two courses would mean a likely reduction of two courses in re- quirements for the major. Sucb a signiflcant reduction would mean a real de~Crease in depth utd breadth in the major. 2. Likewise, both I.D. majors and minots would be likely to suffer in academic richness under a thirty-tw~ course requireme11t. The most difficult challenge in con- structing coherent l.D. majors is to provide adequate depth. Again, a likely reduction of two courses for I.D. majors would be a significant step backward. 3. The proposal recommends that the General Education require- ment be reduced by one course. A reduction of one course will not kill the program, but it will force a choice tbat cannot help but weal~en one of the components of the Pro- gram. Atpresent, each component wou]d seem to have no more courses required than most people would see as the minimum. For ex- ample, would anyone argue that re- ducing the science requirement from two courses to one would not make a fundamental change in one of the best things that we do at Union? 4. Although a few have argued otherwise; it seems likely that fewer Union students would study abmad under a semester calendar with thirty-two courses. What shou.ld seem even more obvious is that Union wouldhave a much more dif- ficult time in increasing the propor- tion of our students who study abroad. Even with a thirty-six course graduation requirement, it is already difficult for science majors to go abroad. Dropping four courses from graduation requirements would surely ntake it significantly more difficult t() maintain, let alone increase, the proportion of science majors who study abroad. Further- more, the demands of a thirty-eight course graduation requirement in a · semester system for engineering majors would make it difficult for those students to go abroad on any term other than an eng4leering term. 5. Most faculty heavily involved in individually-supervised under- graduate research believe that Union's close to pre-eminent posi- tion in this enier;prise would be di- rectly undermined by adopting a semester system in which each stu- dent would take four courses each semesterratherthan three each term. Given the intense nature of the se- nior thesis experience in general and the research experience in the sci- ences, the ability to focus on only two other courses rather than three other courses constitutes a tru1y substantial advantage· for both the quality of the student experience and the scope and quality of the work produced. 6. Perhaps the single greatest advantage of the three-term system is that it allows students to focus their energies on three courses. Related to this advantage is that, assuming the time available tQ stu,. dents is finite, students have avail- able to them considerably more time to work cutside class on each course. Given the factthatmost fac- ulty would like to increase student involvement in learning outside the classroom tbroagh various sorts Qf activities, and given the fact that Unionputsgreatemphasison com- munity serviee, it might be reason- able to· predict that students would in fact spend less time working out- side class on ilach course in a se- mester system than in the term sys- tem that we have. Arguments made by proponents of a semester system 1. Of all the arguments made by proponents of a semester calendar, none seems to be more suspect than the asserti<>n that a seme.ster sys- tem will bring more rigor to our edu- cation. (Ironically, this assertion conflicts with an argument made by some proponents that the semester system will lead to a more relaxed pace in lea1:ning.) As Trustees pointed out earlier in the calendar discussion, there is little reason to think that those faculty who cannot provide a rigmous education in a term system could do so in a semes- ter system. It should be obvious to any faculty member who keeps eyes and ears op.en (and listens to stu- dents) that the prerequisite for providing a demanding education based on high standards and ex- pectations is the will and commit- ment of a faculty member. No cal- endar can provide that prerequi- site. 2. Some proponents agree that adopting a semester system would improve our reputation. I ask, has the term calendar harmed the reputations of schools with term calendars~ Carleton, Chicago, Dartmouth and North- western f~r example? 3. Some proponents of a se- mester calendar atgue that such a calendar would_provide faculty with more fime for research be- cause it would provide a longer summer break. No one can deny that the break would be longer., however, nothing except the cur- rent priority we giv:e to the needs of our intercollegiate athletic pro- gram prevents us from returning to the late September start that we had fOI many years. A sec- ond response to proponents' claims is that the semester calen- dar, with its component proposal of a five-course teaching load, would almost surely have a nega- tive effect on facu.lty develop- ment, especially for junior faculty. That is because in a semester sys- tem, with a five-course load, a fac- ulty member will never be able to have a teaching load light enough. so that a reasonable block of time can be devoted in part to research. Under such a system, no faculty member will have a semester in which she or he teaches fewer than two courses. Under the present system, faculty have the opportunity to teach but one course in one of the three terms. 4. Altltough proponents ac- knowledge thataverage class size would increase by five percent under a semester system, most ar- gue that the increase would be insignificant. In my opinion, a five percent increase in class size would indeed be significant. The first reason I would cite is that certain typeS of courses would likely see a disproportionate in- crease. Th-ere are at least two rea- sons to believe this would be s<>. The first is that for obvious rea- sons, some courses would need to be protected from increases in class size, the most obvious be- ing Freshman Preceptorial and another being disciplinary semi- nars. The second is that certain up- per level c:ourses are unlikely t() increase in size because they serve a. specialized clientele and would in no event draw more stu- dents. {This is true most obvi• ously in the sciences and perhaps in math.) The consequence oftbe above is that introductory courses in general are likely to see increases of more than five per- cent. Because those courses are already atthe upper range ofclass size among colleges with which we compete, this result could be hannful both to the quality of our academic program and to our at- tractiveness to potential appli- cants. 5. Some proponents argue that students who fall ill are a.t adisad-. vantage in a system with ten week terms. That may be so within a term, but the fact remains that stu- dents occasionally see an entire term wiped out by illness, mono- nucleosis for example. However, losing a semester is clearly more damaging than losing a term. Clearly, tle~ibility in this respect and others is a hallmark Of the term system, for example, flexibil- ity in a student's ability to put to- gether a coherent program of courses over the course of an en- tire yem:, and.a student's ability to recover his or her footing after a periodofadju::;tmentto collegelife as a freslnnan. 6. Last week at a Crosstalk, pro- ponents of a ~emester system of- fered two arguments that in my opinion ate ll()t appropriate to a debate which, at this point, <mgh.t to be focussed on questions re- lated to the quality of Union College's educational program and related questions such as faculty development Those arguments were that the college would sa~e money under a semester system and that \all of the President's se- nior staff support the pmposal for a semester system.\ Whether true or false, the latter is irrelevant at tb.is stage of the debate. The President's staff will have a chance to make its case if and when he has to make a decision whether to switch to a semester calendar. The former argument is also both inap- propriate 1!lld weak. For example, the Trustees are on record as stat- ing that any d-ecision on a calen ... dar change sh<>uld \not be for fi- IIancial reasoru;,, but for pedag()gi- cal/academ:ic ones.\ (The Chronicle, February, 1999). In any event, the proponents' argument on any fmancial savings to be made is in my opinion a weak one. According to a high-level a.d- ministrator wb.o knows the facts~ Ally Sorry, I got a skirt! !l! -R any sayings that would accrue from having a semester system would come from switching from tmee billing dates per year to two. In the later case, the college WGuld have the income-producing advan- tage of having revenue available for a longer period o.f time. How- ever, there would ·seem to be no insurmountable ()bstacle. to switching to a twice-a-year billing schedule under a: term system. If this were to be done, we could achieve the same \savings\ U11der a term system as preponents say could be achieved tmder a semes- ter system. Conclusion This question, tobe decided by the President and T'rustees witiJ. the advice of the faculty, is, I believe to be, of the greatest importance to the.college's well-being. Although my personal opmion is that a term system is inherently superior to a semester system on pedagogical grounds, I respect the views of those of my colleagues who do not agree with me. I wish to emphasize, h<Jwever, that the question we face is not the merits of the respective calendars :in any abstract sense. Rather; the ques- tion is which calendar best ensmes tb.e continuing viability ofthe par- ticular contours ancl strengths of Union's educational enterprise. Although there are some JlfG- grams anddisciplinesat Union that would probably be strengthened · by the adoption of a ~emester sys- tem, theatre arts for example, the arguments I make here on behalf ofthe term calendar seem to me to make it clear that w.e should OJ)t to retain that calendar. It is so inter- twined with what we d~ best tbllt it seems to me that atJandoning it would threaten what.[ think is an edu.cational program c:1early sllpe- rior to that .of most iJf()ur competi- tor colleges.

Jess' Crime stinks. There's nothing worse than realizing \that your wal- let has been stolen or your room- mate was attacked hy a stalker. Lucky for us, these sorts of disas- tersnever seemed to affect the cam- pus. Rape, assau!f, major theft. .. according to the nifty hand- out that each freshman used to get at orientation, these things very rarely happened at Union. Not any more ... Apparently, crime is finally reaching inside the walls of Union College. I guess the security guard waiting at the entrance of the college mistakenly let in some \bad guys\ that have tarnished the amazingly stark white reputation of Union. Maybe one .of the reasons for the recent growth in crime is due to the lack of interesting crimes in the weekly Security Incident Report. I can just imagine Security staging some wonderful criminal activities to drum up a whole new list of crimes in order to make their jobs sound more dangerous. In lieu of all the recent crime on campus, I thought it important to point out all the ridiculous and un- necessary Campus Safety viola- tions reports.

A prospective stu- deJlt, Vlho we wilJ.call Steve, was sent to Ellis HosJ>ital at 11:52 PM on Monday night for alcohol poi- soiling. This apparently happened after tne host, wllo will be called Jas&n. andhis prospective student attempted to watc:h the campus movie, \The Talented Mr. Ripley.\ Th~ 10 PM show was canceled for reasons currently unknown. Upon returning to the host's dorm room, ther.pmceeded to watch television anc:halk about campus life. As the host left for a ·C.O!llple minutes, the prospective stude;nt found a bottle of V t)dka undeme.ath the host's roommate's bed., .and began to drinlcit. He apparently finished the bo1tJe before the host returned. Within ten minutes, the prospec- tive had passed Otlt and EMS had been called. ~'This is very embarrassing for Unio11,\ stated Dean of Students Fred Alford the ftJl](,)wing day. \I hate to think thatthere might be a problem on this campus, but it ap- there might P.e.

Del.ta G~a, Ready for Guerilla War Th.eodore Geisel House is nowbeing transferred as the new set of students setting up a theme house for the 2000/2001 ye~. Delta Garruna previously occupied the house, but had its charter revoked recently~ The newtheme house will be one ofliteracy and community invoJvement. TheDelta Gammapresident,Erin Co111J.olly, has organized a sit in, as a last attempt to keep their house. This past weekend, :when the new Geisel House students were supposed to comeand view the house, the Delta Gamma girls were reported as blocking the door and chanting, \Hell no. Wewon' t go!\ The new president, Andrea Tehan, along with campus secu- rity, entered the house for an es- corted inspection of the premises. Controversy has. also arisen abol!-t this new house on say hello to her friend. So-, both decided to make a pact and the dog did not chase the fox. However, when they do meet oc- casi()nally, the instinct is still there with both. But, setting that aside, the two became good friends and continued the relationship they ended so long ago. Tliere is this individ'Ual that I have known for a long time, but yet is so different from what or who I am. What is even funnier is that this individual is a female. I find this funny because it fits in well with the yin and yang theory that is so prevalent in my life. I am a Political Science major in a pri- vate liberal arts school in New York. She is a Biology major attending UCLA, a public schooL We've known each other ever since we were young. She is in a Korean soro.rity and she loves going to club:s, is very outgoing, and al- ways speaks her mind. I am an independent who likes the more quiet life, am very sensitive and very choosy about what I say and who I make friends with.. She is a total opposite and I do not know what keeps our friend- ship going, However, we some- how manage. We are so different, but yet are the same in ways not our choosing. The most striking similarity is that we are both of Korean ethnicity. Maybe this one thread helps us t.o bare and grin through the problems that we have with each other in our unique rela- tionship. She is so different from me, but at the same time,. a friend that I know lcoqld notdo without. In many ways, she is part of me in ism and violence toward the stu- dents, as well as the standard as- sumptions that the new residents are nothing but slobberii~g drunks w\lo wiU do nothing but keep three .kegs. of beer on tap. The students repeat the claim that they will only be holding social functions, ·where the only drinks served will be, \you know ... soda, orange juice and stu.ff.\ Dean Alford; who authorized the house, along with the Student Fo- rum, isstanding by the students·, criticizing what so many of the op- ponents are saying, calling it, \lu- dicrous.\ Between the Delta Gamma girls and the Daily Jolt, Geisel House is not starting out on the right foot, and is going to have to prove itself next fall, otherwise, many of the threats made on the Daily Jolt and by the Delta Gamma girls might be- come a reality. A formal declaration of war and armament by the rem- nants ·Of Delta Gamma is rumored to be in the works. Note-all storiesare meant for en- tertainment ... ,,,.,..,.,.,.., that she is the opposite of what I ·am. She is part of me because while she is different, she is still the same. I figure that we as individuals all have this double personality. One just happens to be stronger than the other. It's funny how the world brings together people of different lifestyles and situations. It is unfortunate that the story of the dog and fox is not realized by most of us. I fmd it fortunate to have a friend so different from me. She makes me think. She keeps me on my toes. Dogs don't realize that there is a great benefit to befriend- ing a fox. Dogs don.'t even give it a second thought when they chase and capture a fox. It is very sad indeed. The very thing that could en- lighten them is killed off. At the same time, foxes are fearful or run away from dogs, Foxes can also benefit from befriending a dog. Co- existence is a better solution than straight out chasing and running. I f<>und that to be true a long time ago. Dogs and foxes are a metaphor for a better thing. But, you '11 have to interpret it. Once again, 1 am not in the mood to give you the answer straight out. That would be self- defeating. So remember, look and seek out a fox or dog, depending on what species you think yourself to be. It d()esn'treallyrnatter. They are, for all intensive purposes the same. The important part is the moral of the story. Think.ofthis as a fable. You have the story, so now it's up to you to seek and find the moral within it.

McDoaald' s has recently been the target of protests against global- ization, a11d cultural influence by activistswithin France. The Wednesday bombi:ng of McDonald's was the flrst attack causingil.uman loss oflife, killing twenty-eight year old Laurence Turbac .. Police ltave a variety of motives about the attack, most of which implicate separatist groups work- ing for independence from France and Spain. The Breton separatist .group Brit- tany Emgann (combat) along with the Spanish separatist group ETA (Basqae Homeland and Freedom) is suspected of playing a role in the bombing. Police believe that the twu groups worked together to steal eight tons of dynamite from a company in Plevin, located in the French. province of Brittany.

Many in France are still in shock as to how political beliefs could have led to this tragic incident. Falun Gong Protests to Mark Anniversary by Philip Cho Staff Writer On Tuesday, one hundred mem- bers of the meditation group Falun Gong were detained at a Tianantnen Square protest which marks tlle first anniversary of a demonstration that eventually led the Cltinese government to ban the movernent. GnHJps of protesters kept Chi- nese police busy by popping out of a cr()wd of tourists to put up bannen or adopt postures of medi- tation.. As each group appeared, police a:rrived in plainclothes and began to drag the unresisting pro- testers into vans. The <trrests were in sharp con- trast to the demonstration the Falwt (J()ng practitioners were com- memorating. A year ago on the same d<tte, 10,000 members of the grouP' surrounded the Communis-t Party leadership's compound near the :S.eijing square. There they meditated for a day to protest what they believed to be official harass- ment The Chinese government launc:hed a campaign against the dem1Jnstration, labeling the sect an \evil c11lt\ aimed at destroying China. Since then, 35,000 members of the group were detained, and 5,000 were sent to labor camps without trial, :aad sixteen have in custody. Chinese officials deny the charges of abus<:. They stated that health problems and suicide caused the deaths of the Falun Gong members.

Tuesday's protest proved the group has not bowed to govern- ment pressure. Falun Gong entails meditation exercises and Cilinese mysticism. The well known leader ofthe sect, Li Hongzhi preaches that those who practice the exercises and read his top leaders to incorporate Falun Gong doctrines into the Chinese g()vemment. Those who practice Falun Gong say it cures their health problems and makes them morally better people. Their leader is currently in exile in the United States after a failed attempt by the Chinese govern- ment to have him extradited. The sect has continued to defy a fierce government crackdown and has kept up with sporadic pro- tests for almost a year, protesting States. They believe that the U.S. is uti- lizing the sect to push anti-Chinese sentiment in the international sphere. The Xinhua newspaper painted Li artd his disciples as hypocrites who abandoned pledges never to seek refuge with po1itical forces abroad. The paper went further to state that, \To prolong their exist- ence, they shifted their strategy and tried to seek some political forces which hoped to use them to sabotage China~ss.ocialandpoliti- cal s.iability.\ It is clear that in the perceived eyes of the Communist Party, and that of the Chinese government that the Falun Gong sect is a threat. As :has been before, China has been loath to grant any type of re- ligious practices or freedom. Although this time, it seems pro- test is more calm and nonviolent, ()ne cannot help but remember the Tiananmen Square massacre .. China is showing remarkable Fe- · straint in controlling the demon- strators. However, it is still resort- ing io tactics that it has used ir1 the past,but behind closed doors. Once again, China has blamed the United States for trying to use the Fa:lun Gong as a pawn to help weiiken the Chinese goverilment. In a situation like this, a:s I stated before, I am not sure that it will be a good idea for the United States to try to naturalize trade relations with China. It is dear that human rights vio- lations are rampant in that coun- try. This is another show of this fact. Not until China can improve its hurnan rights records, should the United States really consider natu- rali:zing trade with China. It will be interesting to see what develops witluespect to the Falun Gong sect and the Chinese government. This is a good opportunity for the Chinese government t() show the world that it can change.. How- ever, things don't bode well for a conc:lusion like that to take place. ] st n• pi je iL tl c rc li Cl F Cl 01 til is w si h; ir rr. :~ '.~· p d VI d c t< a: c: SJ a: n c c s·

Malcolm in the Middle is Television's Best, Choir Bound for Canada by Jessisca Brearton Staff Writer This past January, Malcolm in the Middle appeared, and is now being lauded by many as the sav- ior of not only the FOX Network (which in addition to having a dis- mal fall season is also (aciHg the loss of Be\;er~r Hills 902/0, Party of Fire, and possibly The X- Files), but the sitcom format itself. It seems people are constantly declaring formats dead, only to watch them rise from the ashes within years. even months. A while ago people thought the newsmagazine was dead ·· · now we're faced with what seem like daily episodesof Dateline and 20/ 20. The premise of the show stems from the first episode, where Malcolm and his family discover (to their great surprise) that he is a genius. He's quickly shuttled out of regular class and into an isolated sect of the school dubbed the Krelboynes, the smart kids who are either ignored or made fun of by the rest of the schoo 1 community. Malcolm appeals to viewers be- cause he feels, in many ways, iso- lated. He feels out of place in his family, where his intelligence seems to have distanced him from every- one, and also out cf place in a school whose students get great mileage out of making fun of him. He looks uponhiswo1ld with a kind of amazement and confusion, and allows us to follow him on his jour- neys to discover tl1e why of how things are the way they are~ The greatest source of insight into Malcolm is Malcolm's family, which also acts as the main source of humor for the show. It is the substantially more f1 awed one of a family much like The Simpsons, one that refuses to disguise the reali- ties of being a family. When the family fights, they fight big, but in the end always eome back to each other how irnportant family really · IS. Often, the jokes can make you cringe because oftheirlack of po- litical correctness, but are often tru.e andbeneath themlie1·eal emotions. Malcolm's best friend uses a wheelchair and has difficulty breathing, and the show does use that for humor. But it also refuses to see the child as defined by that · wheelchair, and allows a real friend- ship to exist there. When Malcolm is threatened by t:he school bully, Stevie wheels up behind him and announces, \I've got your back.\ It's done not only for the humor of the shot but also as a testament to the real friendship between the two. Malcolm in the Middle refuses to make any of its characters com- plete sinners or saints, and looks at the complexities inherent both within the family and in the out- side world. In that sense, the program ech~ oeshow complex human life is, and adds to the overall deepness the show has, beyond it's surface of light family comedy. Sometimes the jokes can be caustic and cynical, but they're al- most always funny, In the end, much like the family at the heart of the show, Malcolm in the Middle refuses to be anything but real, and I find that truly refreshing. by Justin Geist Contributing Writer ------------~--~--~~ French culture and Brll.hms: these are just two elements of a · weekend which the Union College Choir and Chamber Singers will enjoy as they head for Montreal. · After a very successful perfor- mance at St. Matthew's Church in Montreal last year, the Choir was graciously invited to retum to sing again this year.

P':II'.:ir.il~':nl byDanCenti A&E Editor Of all the young up and coming comedic actors in Hollywood to- day, one of the fulllliest and often the most underrated is Friends alum Mathew Perry. With a tmique talent for playing average, likeable every-man characters who just happen to be trapped within an unusual set of circumstanc.es, Perry is actually one of the finest physical comedians working today. Desks, lamps, and doors con- stantly smash into him, and he con- sistently walks away undaunted. In his newest feature, The Whole ·Nine Yards,Perryplaysadownon · his luck (as usual) dentist whose · marriage has sunk to art all time low. Eady on in the fllm, he comes to the brink of a serious mid-life cri- sis, nQt kn()wing where to go or what to do to escape his pitiful and frustrating existence. Enter Bruce Willis, an ex-hitman from Clricago (the movie for some reason takes place in Quebec, which struck me as an Wiusual location to film a comedy) who moves in next door to Perry. Perry, out of fear and slight curiosity, befriends Willis, and shares his marital problems with him. The movie then takes its first comedic tum when Perry's devious wife plans a scheme to alert Willis' enemies to his location for a cash and flies to Chicago to meet with the mob boss who has offered a bounty for Willis. While in Chicago, Perry meets the wife of Bruce Willis's character, played by the absolutely gorgeous Natasha Henstridge. Henstridge and Perry fall in love, and devise a scheme that could .fi- nancially secure them forever in the process. What ensues is pandemonium, with Perry doing his best to ap- pease both the mob boss and Willis without getting killed. TIJ.ere are too many twists and turns in The Whole Nine Yards to list them all. Also, giving them away would significantly lessen the spontaneity of the film. It cloes suc- ceed in doing what the director in- tends however, and is thoroughly entertaining. Perry is terrific, and does a fan- tastic job of gaining the sympathy of the audience, but the perfor- mance of Bruce Willis can't be over lo<>ked either. Audiences may have forgotten how proficient Willis is at c()medy, but with The Whole Nine Yards, they'll remember quickly. The interaction between these two actors is what makes the film, and defmitely demonstrates a stron,g chemistry.

Lyme Disease by Steve Ayers Staff Writc>r is caused by a bacterium called · Emrelia burgdorferi and closely related species.

Currently, Lyme disease is fotmd . in scattered areas in many parts of · Science & Technology With the snow fmally lifted from the ground, it seems quite appeal- ing to spend time in the woodland areas of upstate New York. How- ever, a mischievous arachnid could spoil such activities for many people. Since it was first discov- ered in a small town in Connecti- cut in 1975,Lyme disease has made the outdoors an even more hazard~ ous place than they were before. About 12,500 cases are reported each year by the Centers for Dis- ease Control, but with some simple steps it is possible to avoid becom- ing a victim. the country. The Centers for Dis- ease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported a twenty-five-fold in~ ·crease in cases since 1982. The Use DNA to Capture Criminals Lyme disease is transferred from woodland animals to humans by deer ticks. lfthese are not removed after twelve hours, they can infect their human host. Initial symptoms typically include a large, circular rash and flu-like symptoms, includ- ing chill~, migraine headaches and joint inflammation. Normally, this disease can be treated with antibi- otics, but if it is left untreated, it can cause severe symptoms, in- cluding a fo~ of arthritis and nerve damage. About twenty percent of those infected display no symp- toms, and even in those who do, it can be weeks or months before serious symptoms sh,Qw up. Upon venturing into the woods for a class assignment, freshman Leeroy Bailey reported that he dis- covered several ticks in his shoes. He recalls pondering, \Why did they bug me?\ He reportedly dis- covered these ticks, despite the precautions that he took. These included tucking his pants into his shoes and wearing insecticide. A vaccine has been developed for Lyme disease, and is adminis- tered in three doses, the last one twelve months after the second. However, even this is not 100% effective. Diagnosing the disease can be difficult, as it displays a wide range of symptoms and can mimic other diseases such as syphilis. Treatment with antibiot- ics is usually successful, though in some cases the disease fails to respond to this. The easiest method to prevent the conse- quences of Lyme disease is to avoid exposure. Fortunately, since it takes over twelve hours for a tick to infect its host, avoiding exposure is not dif- ficult to accomplish.

The man in the Long Island case had been convicted under our previously established means of conviction, A jury of twelve of his peers found him to be guilty beyond .a reasonable doubt based upon tlu witnesses and evidence presented to them. Can we now assume that because of DNA testing that these twelve people and the system they were following is so wrong that it put an innocent man in jail? DNA testing is not only changing the procedures of criminal justice in a courtroom, but much before that step as well. The FBI currently has a database of millions of fingerprints. This database may soon be outdated by a new d~.ttabase of DNA \fingerprints.\ Such a d~tabase would allow law enforcement officials rtatio11wide to identify suspects and arso find out if they had previously committed any crimes.

The victims hope that the DNA recovered from their own bodies will be able to identify and imprison their attacker. Most of the time, however, thes~ rape kits, on:ce gath- ered, are not even seRt to labs for DNA testing. They sit ()n the shelves ofa police evidence locker and remain unopened even if the case goes to trial. How can we as a society justify somethin~ like this? The means of fmdin.g these criminals is available to us, however we choose not to spend the money on establishing such a database.

Will someone be able t<> plant DNA evidence at the scene of a crime, such as hair or blood in or- der to frame someone else? Right now DNA testing is not developed enough to distinguish between the actual criminal and a framed innocent man.

The most obvious solution to the disease is the control of the Dutch elm beetles. One .ofthe first atteii1pts at elimination of the beetles and disease involved the use of DDT. The results of this experiment were terrible as LesLine described in Audubon: \When DDT was introduced, the elms in to~sall across the country were doused ~i111 the pesticide in the hopes ofsaving the trees. The re- sult was the death of millions of songbirds as well as the trees, a tragedy that precipitated the writ- ing of Racltel Carson's landmark book, Silent Spring. \The war against Dutch elm dis- ease turned out to be like 'the war against cancer: far more difficult and complex than we realized in our youthful optimism,\ I . said Gene Smalley, an elm re- searcher at the University of Wis- consin. Certainly, the solution was not DDT. Tllere are various ways of. having healthy elms in the United States. Oriental elins were originally all option because they proved to be tesistant to the dis- ease. However, these elms were not popular with: the Ainerican public. Twenty years ago, Denny Townsend, a plant geneticist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, began searching for an elm with natural resistance to Dutch elm dis- ease. One tree· in one hun~ dred thousaad will naturally resist the disease. By luck, Townsend happened upon one seed that grew one tree that seems to this resistance. When the tree :is in- jected with ~me million spores of Dutch elm disease, compared to the ten to one hun- dred spores a tree ~,~,,.ould receive in the wild, it wilts a. little but is able to fight off the illlness. Townsend has named this tree the Va,lley Forge elm. Other varieties of elm resistant to Dutch elm disease such as the American Liberty hybrid, created by Eugene Smalley, do not show resistance. to the degree of Valley Forge, but still show more tihan a regular elmtree. New Harmo11y and Princeton are two other di:sease resistant hybrids. www. bri tamtica.com However viable these trees are in the laboratory, Townsend warns against people trying to recreate the elm p()pulations of the past from just a few varieties ... I hope people don't go out and start planting the whole town. with Valley Forges. They'd 10pen- themselves up to disllster.

Two Losses Diminish Chances of NCAA Bid for Women's LAX Dutchwomen Fall to Rochester and Hamilton in Two Close Losses by Rachel Bukowski Sports Editor The Union Women's Lacrosse Team's chances for an NCAA bid were severely, diminished this past week, and the Dutchwomen lost two crucial matches to UCAA com- petitors, University of Rochester and Hamilton College. Had the Dutchwomen defeated Hamilton after their loss to Roch- ester on Friday, then they would have been tied with Hamilton for first place in the UCAA League, thus giving them an automatic NCAA bid. On Saturday, Hamilton knocked Rochester out of conten- tion for the league title, beating them 11-8. Thus, Union and Hamilton would have each had a 5-1 record going into Monday's game, but based on the competition between the two, Union would have received the bid if they had won their game against Hamilton and vice versa. Union's hopes for a bid to the NCAA Champjonship Tournament are not completely diminished, as there is still hope for them to re- ceive an invitation to compete in the tourney, since they entered their game against Rochester ranked fifteenth in the country. However, a win agajnsteither Roch- · ester or Hamilton would have se- cured the automatic berth. On Friday, Union's record set- ting UCAA win streak came to halt when they fell to Rochester by a score of 9-8. It was an arduo11s fight from they very start, and both teams knew t:hat the game would be close. Roel!ester came out hard, as did the Dutchwomen, but the Yellbwjackets led at the half, 5-4. The Dutcaw()meil knew that they would have to come out hard in the second half of the game and overpower the Rochester defense. They tied the score at eight, and it looked as if the game would be launched into ;QVertime until Roch- ester scored with less than five min- utes in the game to put them ahead by one. Despite a V<ilianteffortby Union, they were unable to close on Rochester's (me-goal lead, and they fell by a score of9-8. Monday presented the Dutchwomen with a \do or die\ situation, where they needed a win against Hamilton to secure an NCAA berth. The game started off . very well for Union, as they jwnped to very early lead. They broke open a 3-3 tie and scored five consecu- tive goals to make the score 8-3 early in the first half. Union then watched as their game fell apart and all hopes of an Jeremy Mcssler/CP Abby Harris watches her teammates downjield: NCAA bid were crushed. In the final 15 minutes of the first half, Hamilton scored nine goals and Onion could only answer with one, making the score 12-9 at the close of the half. Nina Mandel scored the frrst goal of the second half, but Hamilton took over from there and consis- tently held a two-goal advantage over the Dutchwomen. Margaret Merriam pulled the Dutch women within one in the final minutes .of the game, but Union was unable to put one more g()a) between the pipes, and in the·dosing seconds, Hamilton secured.theirvictmy with one more goal to ma.ke the score 17-15.

There is no heed to worry because they have been practicing and working as hard as ever, The team is largely made up offtesh- men who are playing at the college level for the first time, but who show promise to carry the team to victory in the up coming sea- sons. Returning players on the team include Juniors John D' Entremont and Matt Elia, and also Senior AsadChoudry. The different levels ofexperience among this year's team members is something that works both for and against the team. In one respect, this year could be seen as a rebuild~ ing year which may not include as many vic- tories as before. However, on a positive note, the team is sure to be stronger than ever for the next three years to come. The tennis match scheduled for the April 18 at Skidmore was postponed until Tues· day the Apri125. ·Last week the Dutchmen did face Rensselaer but they were coura- geously defeated, 6~ l.

On Thursday afternoon the Dutchmen found themselves matched up against SUNY Utica, and Union took no time proving themselves superior to this team on Bailey Field in the Dutchmen's second to last horne game of the season. TI1e Dutchmen ~cored I 0 unan- swered points by the end of the first half, and Sophomore Goalie Patrick Forrest, who saved all four shots he faced, was allowed to rest for the remainder of the game. Sophomore Andy Craighill was put in net for the second half of the game and he turned in an outstand- ing performance, allowing only five goals on 13 shots. At the end of the third period, the Dutchmen were ahead by a decisive 16-3 mar- gin, and did not slow down as they neared the close of the game. Union emerged victorious from this contest, winning by a final score of 20-5. It was a collective effort by the Union offensive unit, as thirteen Dutchmen combined for the twenty goals scored. Sopho- more Kurt Kimba11 contributed three goals and four assists, while Junior Scott Dutcher and Freshman Matt Murphy put three goals.in the net as well. Sophomore Russ Kerbel scored twice, and Sophomore Brant Caraberis tallied three assists for the team. Goalies Forrest and Craighill combined for twelve saves on 17 shots on goal. That Saturday, Union traveled to SUNY Geneseo for what would prove to be a much more challeng- ing game than their contest against Utica. At the end of the first pe- riod, both teams were scoreless and the game was tied at one at the close of the first half. At the close of the third period, Union led by only 2-1 and desper- ately needed to break open the game and gain a comfortable lead. Behind a shutout in goal by Forrest in the second half and a tluee-goal fourth qua1ter Union did just that. When the final horrt sounded, Union had defeated Geneseo, 5-1. Kimball scored a team-high two goals in the primarily defensive battle between the two teams. Kerbel, Senior Jordan Thomas and Junior Nick Balascio added a goal apiece, and Forrest recorded 20 saves on 21 shots on goal. The Dutchmen will travel to Hamilton College this weekend to take on the Blue in their fifth UCAA contest of the season.
