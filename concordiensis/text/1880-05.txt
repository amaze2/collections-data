RAIN. At nooning reddening, swooning, deadening Lies the grass beneatll the sun; Sultry hours wilt the flowerR, Streams, exhausted, feebly run; Listless birds have ceased their twittering; Winds give not the grateful gust: The land with fire is glittering, frittering, Turning, burning into dust. Hark ! faintly breatlung, while quaintly wreathing- From the distant, hazy west, Softly muttering, brokenly stuttering, Rises up the thunder .crest; Anx1ous Nature, silent, gazes \Vith a heart that prays he1· God To quench the fire that blazes-dazes, Scorches, torches flow'r and sod. .. O'er sleeping meadows, soon, creeping shadows Steal away the painful glare; Grim cloud-legions from midnight regions Hise to view in western air- Muster dark with fronts defying-· Pause upon the landscape's 1narge, Till sutl:den thunders flying, crying, Loudly, proudly sound the charge. Then gleaming and brightening, streaming with light- ning, Sweeps the storm along the sky, And upward aspiring its drefld cannon firing Whelms the hosts o.f Light on high; Twilight falls o'er field and bower, Silence settles widely down, While shapes unearthly glower, lower, Grimly, dimly, frown on frown. With glances that shivering, fire-lances fi,t,h qui verin o~ t:> Break the vivid lightnings forth. And swift at their dying, o'er heaven tlymg, Banded thunders jar the earth; Glare the shies like worlds CQnsuming, Crash they like vast planet:-3 torn;

Syracuse excelled at the bat while Union far out-fielded then1. The last of the game was very exciting. In the 8th inning Syracuse had 9 runs and a n1an on I st. and 3d, \vhen Ahern by a feint at thro\V- ing to Ist_, passed the ball like lightning to 3d, catchtng Osterhout, (the ubiquitous bi- collegian).. ~Ahern and Rogers played fine- ly.
