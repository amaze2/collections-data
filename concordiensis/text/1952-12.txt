Cassidy Bows Out Cassidy's term as editor is over and it seems to us here at our Washburn Hall ofiices that it was one of the finest jobs ever turned in by any editor of this :r;>a;per. . The Con- cordiensis has done very well by that skilful mixer from Saratoga, Jack Cassidy. Professionally, the paper was tops. Jack did painstak- ino- work every week on the 1ssue and it was he who was the ~ding force behind the mal{eup, the stories, and the edi- torials. A story didn't appear m the newspaper unless Jack had a look at it first and it was not unusual for him to re- write stories at 3 .a.m. Friday morning· because they were not up to th~ Concordiensis standard. He was liberal. It was up to him which letters that came in might be published. l\lany times, we thought it was un- wise to publish a letter that was quite violently opposed to his policies, but in order to g1ve the man a chance to be heard, that letter was printed. Many people capitalized on his liberality. We of the new staff will follow his liberal policy. The shoes that Cassidy wears are small in size and yet are big to fill. It will not be easy to follow in his footsteps because they made a big and lastmg impression, a cast that will be hard to duplicate. If we can in some way keep the pap~r at a level close to the heights .Jack maintained, we shall then be satisfied. -A. L. G. A Plea for Faith Next week marks the initiation on campus of the new and renamed Religious Conference Week. Some of you may remember the week last year as Religious Emphasis Week, in which Andre Trocme was invited to appeal'. Trocme was especially stimulating and left a terrific effect upon those students who were fortunate enough. to hear him. This year, from December 7-11, the chapel, in addition to class rooms and lounges, will be the scene of something new and as yet untried here at Union College. A group pf interested students with John C. Maisel as leader sent out questionnaires among their friends on campus which posed many problems that face our lives today. These people were then asked to submit their preferences as to those prob- lems they would like to have discussed. The results. were then compiled and talks on the general topics of Vocation, Marriage, and Fatt>, were prepared for the fil·st three chapel assemblies of next week A Special Sunday Service These talks will be delivered by members of the Char- acter Re~earch Project. A special Sunday service will start off the week with a theme of \What is God Like?\ Students wiH lead the servi.ce and the audience will participate, Fra- ternity houses and dormitories have l>een asked to invite discussion leaders to the Sunday service.

It was also learned that the Military Ball Com- mittee is going against the Student Council's wishes in making the dance a \formal\. According to Major Otis Smlth, Rel • • advisor to the Military Ball com~ · .,. g'IO'II 0 mittee, all ROTC cadets will wear Monday and Tuesday. May Call Students In a special interview with the Concordiensis, Dr. Davidson said· that the selective service may start to call students ranking lowest in their classes during the summer. He added, however, that the call- ing of college students during the !lecond semester is unlikely. Dr. Davidson also revealed that it is under consideration to require ROTC students, who are undet' special draft status, to meet the same requirements scholastically as those who are not enrolled in the reserve program. Korean War Veterans, mean- while, will start to enter college next February under a special' pro- gram. By attending summer ees\ sions, they will be ·caught up with the rest of their •class. Alumni Meeting Earlier in th<t week, Dr. David- son and Professor James Morley spoke before a meeting of the New York Union Alumni. The social a.Ifair was also attended by Pro- fessors Henry Swanker and Charles Male Sr., Coach Samuel Hammerstrom, and Har(}ld Van De Carr, director of Financial De- velopement. Dr. Davidson. spoke on the financing of higher educa- tion and Professor Morley on his experiences in Japan last year. Must Understand Asia Morley told the audience that we, the U.S., conquered the Asians and forced them tu understand us. Now, they are getting stronger and we are forced to understand them. \If we had taken the time to un- derstand, them,\ he said, \perhaps the Korean conflict might have been circumvented.'' • \One of the troubles in Japan still exists at the present time,\ Professor Morley told the assem- blage, \and that is the fact that eve-n after seven yea~;s, out of the iOO mail. embassy office in Tokyo, only six have a working knowledge of Japanese.\ , Morley emphasized that we must and we can undet·stand Asia. But Morley says that this will be a difficult job becl.l:ual;l it wol,!lc:l eptail the training of dual experts: men who could be skilled economists, lawyers, journa1ists, military ex- pevts, and at the same time trained in the language and culture of the specific Asian area. This would be a. difficult thing to accomplish, but be noted · the growth in under- graduate schools across the coun- . try hich have initiated studies in Chapel Will Hear Briton Sir Richard Livingstone, noted British educator and former Chancellor of Oxford University, England, will visit the Union College cam- pus Tuesda.y, December 16.

For ten years prior to his appointment as president of Corpus Christi College, he was president of Belfast Univer- sity, Belfast, Ireland. From 1944 to 1947 Sir Richard was honored with the vice-chancellorship of Oxford University. \The Pageant of Greece\ and \Greek Ideals and Modern Life\ are two boolts on the classics written by Sir Richard. Also listed Sir Richard Livingstone under hi!;! authorship are the volumes ,on education entitled \The Future in Edu~ation\ and Educa- tion for ·a World Adrift\ (published In one volume in the United States as \On Education\) and \Educa- tion and the Spirit of the Age\ edited this year.

His equipment was left around and fi,ually most of it got back to him in a piecemeal way, a shoe here, a sock there, etc. His sweatshirt was not picked up, however, and this is where the Athletic department is now refusing this athlete a letter because his sweatshirt has not been returned.

An- other disappointment was the re- suits of the 200 yard breakstroke; Bob Kim, highly touted Union freshman, siezed an early lead in this event but the pace proved too much and the race was won .by Douglas in 2:33.6, a time Kim has constantly broken ln pre-seaoon trials. Whitey Reiners, the work horse of the Dutchman squad turned in a great performance as he won the 150 yard individual medley and was the leadoff man on the record breaking 3oo yard team. :Dick Hartmann, in winning, did not seein to exhibit the form which made him a top point getter last year. Although he easily won the 200 yard backstroke event, his time 2:30 was seven seconds off last season's pace. The best race of the day ,the 400 yard relay came at a point when the outcome of the meet was no longer In doubt. The Wi11iam's entry of Latham, Kim- berly, Beard, and Martin clocked in 3:42.2, set a new pool record by six seconds, while the Union team of O'Neil, Bartner, Dorsey and Reiners, in losing, broke the old pool mark by two seconds.
