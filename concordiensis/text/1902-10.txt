THE CONCORDIENSIS VoL. XX\ 7 1. UNION COLLEGE, OCTOBER 1, 1902. No.2. ---------· ·------ ALBANY LAW SCHOOL OPENS. Lawyers Return to Work. The Fifty-third Session of the School begin on the 24th i'nst., when both classes assembled in the Senior lecture room at ten o'clock in the forenoon for the opening exercises. Rev. l\.fr. Birdsall, Rector of Grace Episcopal Church, .A.lbany, offered prayer. Hon. An1asa J. Parker, President of the 'I'rustees, presided. and after delivering a tnost interesting address of welcome to the students, introduced Dr. Raymond, Chancellor of the University, who spoke to the school in his usual happy vein, and was heartily applaud- ed at 1nore than one point in his retnarks. l-Ie dwelt at length upon the broadness and great- ness of the legal profession, touching as it does ''every phase of hun1an activity\ and made an especial plea for \intellectual honesty\. Dean Fiero then, addressed the classes, speaking of the vadous changes both in the school-building and in the policy of the Faculty, and outlined in brief the work of the year. Judge 'l'ennant, Mr. Parker, Mr. Bat- tershall, and Mr. Newcotnb, of the Faculty, were also preseut, as vvas Secretary Davidson - ' to whotn the Dean paid high tribute in his re- tnarks. The registration this year bids fair to be the largest in the history of the school. It is hard to give any exact :figures at this tirne, but by noon on Wednesday 48 Seniors had actually registered, and 39 Juniors. 1'he total regis- tration, provided all register whose nan1es are on the books as intending to do so, will be, Seniors, 71, Juniors, 61. · As the total registration for last year was Seniors 79, Juniors 55, the increase is quite apparent, particularly in the Junior class. I I I I I The ilnprovetnents to the school-building made during the summer are quite apparent. A large flag-staff has been placed upon the roof, from which \Old Glory''' is to float daily during the session. The facade has been re- painted, as also the wood-vvork. 'I'he Junior room has been completely r.enovated and sev- eral extra desks have been placed in position. 'l'he tables in the library have been re-covered, and altogether the appearance of the building has been greatly itnproved. · At the n1eetingof the 1\'rustees which was held on Friday evening . the 26th in st. arrange- ments V\Tere n1ade for the ·delivery of the lec- tures in the course in Leg~l Ethics, so gener- ously endownecl by General Hubbard of the Class of I 86 I at the last Conunencement. The fund available for this purpose is $1 o,ooo. Several n1e1nbers of the class of 1903 who have not as yet returned are due within a week or two. Rooney and Lawless con1e on Oct. 1st, and Boorn on the 3rd, while President Bryan is expected in a week or two. Others wi] l no doubt drift in before the tniddle of the tnonth. Following is the registration to date. with the addresses of the students and their Col- lege, if any: SENIOR CLASS. Harry T. Groves·~ Kingston Andrew H. Weller,~~ Lafayette, A.B., Corning Frank E.

ANNUAL CANE RUSH I S·ophomores Win! rfhe cane rush was held on the campus Tuesday afternoon, and resulted in .a victory for the sophomores, by a score of r 4 to 7. An unusually large crowd from the city was up to witness the scrap, and as usual the upper classtnen divided themselves in support of the lower classes. ~\he sophs formed in battle array at the south end of the ca1npus, and after a few minutes wait, r9o6 came out of the chemical laboratory and formed at the north end of the campus. As soon as the word was given the two classes charged and the usual impartial d\is- tr.ibution of tomatoes and salt followed. In a short tin1e Captain Gulnac threw the cane. The sophs got under it as it fell and· had the advantage from the start. rfhe scrap was by no means over at that time, though, for the fresh1nen held up their end and one of the best cane fights in recent years resulted. \Vhen the hands were counted the sophs were given the cane, and they rnade an at- · temp a ge Th ~nd · Final ried Th~ i: :Foe effect~ them the b points . serv1o mack, good: deavo1 fit cor a tack how t JonE of eac and e1 the se 190 I, ] on how devote: . vanou~ The E.

Finally the thing was stopped and r 905 car- ried off the cane in triumph. FOOTBALL. The Work of Hammering the Team into Form goes on Successfully. :Football up to date reveals the beneficial effects of good coaching. In this respect the management this year has given the men the best opportunities to find out the fine points of the game. Besides the invaluable services of regular coach Whitney. Mr. Na- mack, an old Cornell line man, ·spends a good portion of his tin1e on the gridiron, eo.- deavoring to put Union's central trio in as fit condition as possible. \Vhen he gets into . a tackle it is a most real is tic ex hi bi tion of how the game should go. ) Jones, an old Union player, also spends part of each afternoon in looking after the tackles and encls, \\·vhile Union's crack pullback of the season of 1goo-r9or, D. vV. Paige, Law 190 r, has given the backs valua b 1 e assistance. · on how to get in to the plays. Captain Gulnac . devotes lllOSt of his tin1e to coaching the . various sets of backs. The timely ~eturn of F. J. Mulvaney and E. K.ing to college has given additional strength back of the line. King plays a live- ly game and Mulvaney uses his weight to good advantage in defensive work. Cook, 19o6, while rather light, will prove a valuable man in an emergency. Reeder and 'Vright still take turns at quarter. Von Dannenberg, Becker, Bolles, Gilmour, and Closson are the n1ost likely candidates for places on the line. H.aymond, although rather light, is in the game constantly. ~: Staeber vvas being tried at end until a broken nose te1nporarily laid him · off. Sherril is now running the scrub at quar- ter and will prove a valuable substitute to the varsity. Watson, 1904, and Nutt, 1905, are playing tackle for the scrub. JUNIOR HOPS. Owing to the fact that the Junior class has not held its election for this year, nothing definite can be said in regard to the Junior hops. It seems to be the sentiment of the class, however, that 1904 will give several hops during the year, probably two a term, and the first one will take place at an early date. By the next issue of the \ Concordy\ more definite information can be given. THE 1904 GARNET. Another college year has come, and with it we will soon be looking for another \Gar- net.\ This book, while it is edited and pub- lished by the Junior class, is in reality a University publication. If we turn out a good book just so much 1nore credit it wiii be to our college, and the reverse is equally true. Every student 'vho pretends loyalty to the institution is duty bound to contribute in one way or another to his college annual. It is a matter worthy of note that more and more attention is being paid each year to the annual publications of the colleges and for that very reason, with no reflection on previous Garnets, it becotnes us one and all to give such hearty support to the 1904 Garnet, that when the book is ready for the public it will be a volume that any college might be proud to own. So get busy and show by your brains and pen that Old Union can turn out literary work of a quality excelled by none. If you can't write long stories, write short ones : if you can't write poetry, write prose : if you can't be serious be hun1orous. Degin no\v. Don't wait until the 1niddle of the year. Hand your contributions to Robert Wilson Clark, Literary Editor of,the 1904 Garnet.

So far, very few men have reported; and with this fact con1es another: that it is the duty of ·every man in college who has any ability at all, or thinks he has any, to con1e out and uphold Union's past achievements. 1.\he loss of Griffeth and Finnegan, 'oz, will be greatly felt, but, as Captain Pierce said in colleg.e meeting, \ Every place on the team is open.\ 1.\he freshmen who seen1 to have good tna- ' - terial, should feel it their duty to share their ability. An inter-class meet will be held in the early part of October, and will give an excellent opportunity to jt1dge any men who have ability and if that is lacking, let them at least show their spirit. The greater part: of last year's squad is back, and with good added material there is no reason why Union should not turn out a winning tean1. VESPER SERVICE.· Owing to stormy weather, very few atten- ded the Vesper Service. After opening the meeting, President Pearce turned it over to Dr. George E. T'almage, pastor of the Second Reformed Church of Schenectady. Dr. Tal- m~ge took for his text, \1\he wise in heart will receive cotnmandtnents.\ The foremost thought that the speaker wished to coi1vey to his audience was one of the chief characteristics of a wise man. That is, the ability, happiness and willingness to take orders. There are many and !$OOd n1en who should be in the church, but they do not wish to put then1selves under restraint. The wisest course to pursue is to take orders, even though they may be distaste- ful to us. Dr. Tahnage told of a friend who believed he was called to the m1n1stry. As this friend disliked calling, books, and writing, he seemed unfit for such a profession. However, he became pastor of a church and was blest with true success. The speaker said that 1nany of us would sooner or later become leaders. The best preparation for leadership is faithful obed- ience. Gen. Chafee, who now holds one of ' ! the wher obey hirn undt one serv . pos1 thin D not Mal n1ec whi ph aft ly glc

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 the most important govenunent posi_tions, when a private learned the importance of obeying his superiors. 'fhis training renders hirn competent to comtnand those who are under hitn. As a rule everybody has son1e one above him who1n he must respect and serve. \Vhen a man thinks himself in such a position· that he cannot serve one, he is any- , thing but a wise man. Dr. 'l'almage finally exhorted those present not to forget the obligations due to their Maker.

As the larger SOCIETY. !i It is with great pleasure that we print the following article by Dr. Ashmore, on the Annual Session of the American Philological Society. It was only after much urging on the part of the editors that he consented to give to the CONCORDrENSIS this account and in view of the fact that his time is so completely occupied with ciass and editorial labors, the CONCORDIENSIS takes this oppor- tunity to give another proof of Dr. Ashmore's interest in the various activities of the stud- ents of Union University. part of the me1nbership of the association is engaged in college and school teaching, it is easy to see that the interchange of ideas for· which these gatherings afford opportunity is beneficial, not merely to the causeof linguis- tic research, to which the society, as such, stands formally committed, but also to the less scientific but n1ore human aspect of the whole matter-the advancement of gen- eral scholarship and education in An1eri-. ca. The social aspect of the meeting was given especial prominence on this Gccasion by the kind co-operation of the Greek 1~tter fratet- nities, \Vho put their houses at the disposal of 'The Atnerican Philological Association held its thirty-fourth annual session at Union Col- lege on the 8th, 9th and 1oth of July, 1902. There were present about sixty of its mem- bers. rrhe progran1me exhibited a fist of thirty seven papers, the reading of which occupied the major part of the time of the convention. The Association held its ses- sions in Sillitnan Hall, and in the College Chapel. The latter was selected for the even- ing of the second day, \\7h en the papers pre- sented to. the Association required illustration with the stereopticon, and especially for the occasion of the address, which was delivered by Prof. Andrew F. '\tVest of Princeton, who for the past year has filled the post of Presi- dent of the Association. The somewhat popular nature of the ''an- nual address \ suggested the attendance of persons not forn1ally connected with the society, and accordingly the Chapel doors were opened to the public. The President of the college, Dr. Raytnond, also kindly con- sented on that evening to say a few words of welcome to the assembled strangers, and his cordial and happy retnarks \Vere received with sincere grati:fication by the entire audi- ence. An interesting feature of these meetings, which are held annually in the first or second week of July, is the promotion of social inter .. the association, and in this way rendered possible and convenient the \entertainment of the 1nen1bers, with very few exceptions, with- in the limits of College Hill and the Campus. It is custon1ary at each annual gathering to appoint a co1nn1ittee to take into consideration and to report in1n1ediately upon the question of invitations extended to the association by the colleges and universities, to meet at their don1iciles in the year follo,ving. In ] uly, r 9or, the meeting took · place in Cambridge and there an invitation to meet in Schenectady in I 902, coming from the President of Union College, was presented to the cointnittee and was at once accepted with courteous acknowledgements. .A few words now with reference to the work and the purpose of the American Philological Association. It is called American because its n1embership is not limited, except by the boundaries of the United States and Canada, while the terrn philological is intended to be of the widest possible significance. There is philology in the narrow sense, and philology in the broad sense. The former, one might say, would confine the term almost wholly to the sphere of etymology. 1\he latter would apply it to the study of language in all its stages and phases of development, beginning perhaps with etymology and the science of forms, and extending to the syntactical, his-

It was never intended that these should be thrust to the wall by the 1anguages of anti- quity. Nor has this been the case altogether. Professors l\1arch and Scott in the department of English have managed admirably to hold up their end of the line; and even the Continental tongues find occasional exponents in the per- sons of young professors of French and German. But as a rule the latter have been drawn avvay from the older Society, by the n'lore recently established Modern Language Association, which also holds annual meetings, and is in effect, though in a slightly different sphere, an association of school and college teachers uniting to discuss and to promote the advancement of tnatters philologicaL to tend in reality to pro1note the interests of scholarship and the advancement of educa- tion and research there ought not to be the slightest doubt. Young men in our school and college.faculties, and other graduates and specialists are earnestly in vi ted to join, and to assist in helping on the good work. By so doing they place the1nselves within reach of the spur and stirnulus of cotnradeship and . honorable rivalry, and the subjects which they are under obligation n1ore particularly to know and to teach are n1a.de to assume a practi- cal and a living interest, without which they n1ust be relatively dorn1ant if not altoaether The Oriental Society also tends to absorb a portion of the membership of our associa- tion ; but inasmuch as the tenn classical philology is wont to suggest the inclusion 2f Sanscrit, it happens that Orientalists, like Prof. Lanman of Harvard, and Professor A. vV.

Jackson of Columbia, are active members in both associations. ·rhe same is true of the Archaeological Institute, but in general it may be said that the n1embers of the latter frater- nity are, almost to a man, quite active and e1rnest Philologists.

THE CON(JO·RDIENSIS. 13 -~ FO·RDI-IAM ·6., UNIOl'J O. The Wearers of the Garnet Defeated by I-Ieavy New Yorkers. An Account of the Game. The first gatne of the· season for Union's team was played on the can1 pus Saturday afternoon. Although the Garnet wea t down to defeat before the heavier Fordhan1 m-en ' still the results were very promising. The team, which is practically a new one, showed up ren1arkably well and the hard consistent practice enforced by Captain Gulnac and Co1ch Vlhitney proved the great benefit of such training. All of the nevv men played well, while the old tnetn bers of the tea1n were up to their usual good standard. Reeder played a good consistent game. Gulnac doubt- less played the best ga.rne, for in two en1ergen- cies he was called on and did not fail to cover the required distance. Sherri 11, at quarter, played remarkably well and sho\ved good head work in handling the s-ignals.. Von Dannen- burg's speed as a runner was demonstrated as well as his knowledge of the gan1e. Ohnsted at right end played his usual steady and snap- py game. I\1iller at centre was always ,in the gan1e. l(ing shoi\-.,.ed up remarkably well at fullback. Griswold and Von Dannen bur a 0 as tackles and Bolles and Lents as guards played a good steady game. The Fordhan1 team averaged probably ro pounds n1ore than Union's representatives. FIRS\T HALF. Fordhan1 kicked off to Von Dannenburo- on 0 the 25 yatd line. Gulnac a.nd Patton went around left and right ends re~pecti-vely for 5 yards· each and the11 the former bucked for 5 yards more. Griswold went around right for 8 and Gulnac on the left for 18 and then the ball stopped advancing. Patton and Gris- wold each lost 2 and I.Ztng kicked to Fordham's 45 yarclline and ther catne pounding down to their 25 yard line. With no losses Fordham han1mered our line for slight gains until by clever interference they sent a n1an around our right for a field run; but Von I)annenburg SiYept through the interference and do,vned hin1 9 yards fron1 the line, but the touchdo:vvn was in sight and in four plays through centre and around right end Fordham scored, kicking a clean goal. The New Yorkers kicked to ·union's 30 yard when time was called for the first half. Score 6-o. SECO~D HALF. Patton kicked off to }i'ordham's 20 yard line.

As soon as the weather be- comes too· cool for classes to be held in the unheated rooms, only a limited number of rooms will be heated, namely, those in Wash- burn Hall, the chapel and office, the che1nical and physical laboratories, and those in which the machinery and instruments of the engineer- ing departments are held.

Floundering over stone and shallow, Past a marsh anci through a fallow, By the fragrance giving mallow, On and Oll\ unto the river Giving thanks unto the Giver. Now the player swiftly Hying Into Nature, deftly tying Many chords, an elf in thunder Making all her hearers wonder. Thunders now from Nature's storehot1se Play o'erhead, the tempest's crashing Deafens all with one vast rumbling. Dying, now so slowly turning From the blare of noise to silence To the murmur of the night winds T'hrough the boughs and leaves ahd branches, Gone the storm wind's noisy blow, Now the brook with its sweet flow, Making peace with all below, Soft and low, sweet and slow.

THE CONCORDIENSIS VoL. XX\;rl UNION COLLE:GE, OCTOBER 8, 1902. No.3. ALBANY LAW SCHOOL. Registration day at the Law School brought a larger nun1ber of Juniors than ever before, while the Senior class, with the additions to their ranks in the persons of t.he one-year students, is well up to the average. 1903 was rather. smaller than us~1al as an entering class, nun1bering a year ago 44 students. rrhe pro- spects are that over 70 will be enrolled before the ter1n ends. As for r 904, they number at present 61, counting those actually registered and many who are due to arrive within a fe~v days. 140 is a fair estitnate of what the total enrollment for the year will be. Besides those who registered on the opening days, the following entered during the week: In the Senior Class, vVilliatn Rooney, Ballston (\Villiams, A. B.), and Gregory Paltner,.· Alb- any ('vVillian1s, A. 13. ), and in the Junior class, John C. Me Dowell, Cohoes (Yale, A. B.), I-Ier- bert B. Thon1as, Rochester; Charles U. l\1ar- shall, Troy; \V. VVard Norton, Hartford; and Franc.es D. I-Iunter, Troy (Colgate). · Several of last year's Junior Class are Iniss- ing, some of whom are con1pleting their clerk- ship, with the intention of finishing with the class of 1904. Others are due to register with- in a week or two, a1nong thetn President Albert E. Bryan, Treasurer John J. Lawless, and Historian Leland L. Boorn. Harcourt lv'I. Taylor, Secretary of the Senior Class, was called home suddenly on Thursday by the death of his mother. Mr. Taylor has the sincere syn1pathy of the entire school, faculty and students. There is the usual good proportion of college men among the students this term. Union, as usual, claims the greater nun1ber, with three Seniors and four ] uniors; \\Nilliams and Cornell have an equal number-the former three Seniors and one Junior, the latter four Seniors. Yale and Manhattan follow with three each- Yale having three Juniors and Manhattan one Senior and two Juniors. Hamilton sends two, one in each class, while two Juniors hail from Colgate. Dart1nouth, Lafayette and Colorado are each represented by a 1nember of the Senior class, while Harvard and Rochester each have one Junior. To date, therefore, there are twenty-nine college n1en in attend- ance, hailing from t\velve different institutions scattered over six States, which speaks well indeed for the the f arne of the Albany Law School. And there are no doubt more to fol- low before the registration is complete. Nelson F. Drtnnrnond, 1903, who captained Han1ilton's team of last season, is coaching the Albany High School eleven, and great things may be expected of the youngsters under such able direction. The returning Seniors found many improve- ments in the school-building. An1ong the rnost noticeable is a fine flagstaff on the roof, ·with \Old Glory\ floating therefron1. And as for the Junior roon1, with its dilapidated ceil- ing and ditto floor, \1903\ would not know it again. 'rhe trustees deserve great praise for their earnest efforts in this direction. The present lecture schedule is as follows : Seniors-Real Property, Judge l'ennant, and 'forts, The Dean. Juniors-Elen1entary Law, :i\1r. Batter shall,· and Contracts, Judge Ten- nant. The present lectures on Torts to the Seniors are a continuation of last year's course on the same subject, and will continue until about the 1oth of October, when the Dean will n1eet the Seniors on Negligence. · The Board of 1'rustees discussed the contem- plated course in Legal Ethics 111ade possible by General 'r. \V. I-Iubbard's (Law '61) generous ~ift of $Io, ooo, at a special meeting on Friday

Mills, 1903, has been appointed Law School correspondent of the Albany Argus, vice Allan Rothery, 1902. THE ''·MEDIC.'' On 1'uesday morning, September 23, the Medical Department of Union University at Albany opened its seventy-second year. In- tr9ductory exercises were held in the ''pit'' at 1 1 o'clock, which were attended by the various members of the Faculty and student body. Dean Albert Vander Veer. M. D., presided. The opening prayer was offered by the Rev. William Force Whitaker, D. D., of the First Presbyterian church. President Raymond, of the University, briefly addressed the students. The address of the day was delivered by Dr. ·Joseph D. Craig, College, Class of 'So, whose sentiments were warmly applauded. Three of the adjunct professors have been appointed to full professorships this year a11d the duties of Drs. Albert Vander Veer and William Hailes have been narrowed in scope: Jo.seph D. Craig, M. D., professor of anatomy and curator of the 1nuseum; Willis Goss Mc- Donald, M. D., professor of abdominal and clinical surgery; George Blumer, M. D., pro- fessor of pathology and bacteriology. Dr. Gerald Griffin, 190I, has been appointed in- ·structor of· therapeutics. Several improvements in the Medical Col- . lege building have been instituted during the past summer. A new elevator has been instal- led for t~e moving of bodies and there are increased facilities for the care and preparation of cadavers. The enrollment at the Medical College thus far has not fulfilled the rosy prophecies made the day college opened. · While the three upper · classes are ·larger in number, to a slight de- gree, tha11 the corresponding classes of last year. But the entering class has not justified (tbe · hopes of those who were led to suppose that the Freshmen would oatnun1be.r the present Sophon1ore class. The Sophomores lost only three men out of those actually in attendance last year and have been increased in numbers by the return of three men, one of whotn is Arthur P. Clark, Union, 'o3. Four Union men are in the entering class. The enrollm•ent to date follows: SENIORS. James Newell VanderVeer, Union, B. A., Albany. Lewis Le Bell Dulberger • New York. Archie Irving Cullen Watervliet.

'.on Saturday, Oct. 4, the elevens of Cornell at~·d Union met on Percy field. l'he game was one in which Cernell manifested her purpose fo·:. p1ay: an aggresive game from the start. 'The Union men 'knew w·hat they had to meet, and as far as a determination to play hard and . creditably is concerned, there is no one, eithe.r . ·c.Oacb, ca.ptain, or individual player, who did . · :not do his ·best. That the game was Cornell's ·by·· ·a large score is the result of no lack of e11thusiasti'c effort on the part of the squad that represented Union ·at Ithaca. ·= 'Vhen the team appeared on the field, it was ·.evident that Union did not lack for men, good feotball material seemed ·to be abundant. · · ·1~he weakness of· the team showed itself in -the lack· of experience and training on the part :of i'ndividual players, and the need of speedy, . :aggressive feam · \VOrk. That Union's team · should be weak in these respects is an inevitable ,r:esulti·of being compelled to play men who are ··not. in good football condition. Four men who were in tne first line up have not been able to be in.practic.e to exceed four .times this fall, . . ' . and some not more. than· twice. It is remark- ·able that · under the circumstances, Coach ·~Whitney and Capt. Gulnac· could 1n,ee.t the at- tacks of· Cbrne'll upon· their lines with any sort .:of' ·ctef~nse~ One fact ·is indisputable, per.sist- ent effort on the field during the hours of prac- ·. tice and the enthusi~stic .. cooperatiot:t of the de- :. ·partrrie\rits of the tJ niversity will make a win- . ningteam out of the tnen \vho met Cornell. A detailed r·e·port of the COi1test w'ill be of' iti- ......... ·. terest only in some of the facts that show the cha~~acter of the gariH~. Cornelltnade n1ost of her gains by continued at.tacks upon the line, and her defense was punting. When the baH was kicked off by Union it did not pass out of Cornell's possession until it was forced over the line for a touch down. The next kick off was returned by ·punt by Cornell. She quickly regained the ball. Five plays and a 40 yard run by Purcell placed the ball in front of Union's goal, where it was forced over the line. Warner received the ball when Union kicked off and, after several punts by both sides. Cornelltnade a fair catch and failed on trial of place kick for goal. Union punted out and Cornell by steady advances of ten and fifteen yards carried the ball over for a touch down. Union kicked off and Cornell punted. This was returned and after several punts and line plays Cornell received the ball on fair catch and again failed at place kick. The ball on the kick off, \\rhen it was brought out by Union from the touch back, was futnbled by Cornell. Wright fell on the ball and time was called before it was put in play. End of first half, score 2 3 to o. (Cornell kicked 3 out of 4 goals.) The second half showed several changes in both teams. Union put E. Reeder, L. Reeder, Cook and Raymond into the gatne. Cornell continued her punting and varied her line work by playing the ends nearly as tnuch as she did the tackles. Cornell kicked off and after son1e advances made by Union received the ball frotn a punt, making a fair catch and a place kick for goal. Cornell returned Union's kick off after James made an advance of 28 yards and Union receiving the ball lost it directly by a fumbie. A touchdown was n1ade after several runs :by Cornell. James. again received the baJl.from Union's kick off and advanced it 40 yards. A punt fell short and Union had the baJI. She was forced to punt and Cornell ad- vanced the ball 20 yards. Union rallied and forced Cornell back for a stnall loss, but lust this advantage when Cornell wen.t arourid the !'• !''.>· '\ e.nd fc with it held ( punte excha . gatns punts block secur( Grisw soon J line I= game fron1 : territ< kicke( In 1 'l!ent t score tackle 'Th( Corn \Vard ..

After sotne exchattge of punts Cot•nell made some rapid gains and secured a touchdown. Several punts followed the· kick off. Hull succeeded in blocking ot1e of Cornelrs punts and Gulnac secured the.ball and advanced it several yard-s. Griswold carried it still further, but Union was soon forced to punt ~nd Cornell by punting and line plays again scored a touchdown. ~rhe game closed by Cornell's advancing the ball fron1 the kick off and punting it into Union's territory. Score 44 to o. (Cornell in 2d half kicked but one goal out of three.) In the first half Olmstead n1ade some excel- .l!ent tackles and Griswold prevented a larger score on the part of Cornell by sotne timely tackles in the second half.

The Passing of ''Jim the Cop·per.\ Le roi est mort, vive le roi ! The know- ledge that \Jim the Copper, \--genial hearty, loyal Jim-has found it advisable ·for his best interests to leave the employ of the college. causes a feeling of sincere regret to come to the hearts of the undergraduates and younger alumni of Union'; Far be it from· the province of the Concordiensis to criticise the present regime which has been so success- ful in raising the standard of practical efficiency of the college, hut would it be. unduly disrespectful to ask whether the unaminous desires of the student body are unworthy of any respect ? In other words is Union College to be con- -., .. . dueted·on the basis of a strictly business concern for the benefit of organized system, or is it to ·be considered an institution conducted for the benefit of the men who enter its doors for instruction and deyelopment? Mr. Corl has been with the college for several years, during which time 1 ;f • • ~ • ' . I .- he has endeared himself to every Union man with whom he has come in contact, because of sterling honesty, stric impartiality,. and ever-manifested loyalty to Old Union and Old Union's sons. On several occasions this loyal,ty has been evinced by his refusal to accept more remunerative positions in order that he might continue to serve the col· lege. Now Economy has dictated sweeping reductions in salaries, just at a tin1e when the necessities of life are ~costlier than ever in Scl1enectady, and even loyalty must ., bow before Mammon. Of course Economy must prevail, college sentiment can make ''no moneys '' for Union ; the wishes of the majority in this instance do not win against the fiat of Economy. To you, Mr. Oorl, the Concordiensis voices the unamin· ous goodiwiil of the students of Union Co liege. To your successor we promise the unqualified support of Economy, particularly if, in addition to his duties as officer, he is willing to act as aid-de-camp and general factotum to Economy. The Vesper Service held every SMnday afternoon at five o'clock is surely a college factor deserving the heartiest support of every undergraduate. An interesting and able speaker is always present to address the meeting. The service is short-only twenty minutes-and should appeal to every student. Not one .of us can afford to neglect this most important feature of student life. A goodly number of students escorted the home team to the station Friday as they left for Cornell. The quar- ter hour before train time was .filled with songs, yells and cheers for the team that was to play Cornell on the mor- row. Surely there can be no greater inspiratiqn to a team than to know that it is backed by the supreme confidence of its fello\v students. The royal send J)ff that our team received was notliing more than should be our usual habit. Let us take a brace in this respect and let our team know, let our city know that the football spirit of Union College is not Jimjted to eleven men but to .' . every man in college. Keep up the good work so admir- ably begun. When our teain starts for Amherst this week let every man turn out and with hearty cheers and songs for Old Union bid good speed to the worthy wearers of the Garnet. To-day we toil and mourn and sow, To-morrow some one else will mow. The great unanswered question \Vhy (?) Tell us ! all ye wise Saints who krtm.y. 1. ,., I 'l'he a held on 17th.

The musical association met in Silliman Hall last Monday evening at 7 :3o, and elected the assistant n1anager for the ensuing year. After considerable discussion Mr. Stiles was elected by a majority of one, and he is to be congratu- lated for having this honor bestow.ed upon him. On motion of Mr. Howe the election was made unanimous. Owing to the earnest work that he did last year the association feels that he will be very successful in his new position. Samuel D. Palmer was elected leader of the Mandolin Club. 'Ve are all acquainted with Mr. Palmers ability and can with assurance foretell a crackerjack club. · The following members were present: Manager-Allen Steele Peck Chairman-Guy Brown Gris·wold. Messrs-King, Howe, Manning, Bishop, Blake, Palmer, Hager, Rulison, IV1ullenneaux and Heath. At the close of this tneeting Mr. 1\tlc Clure of Albany selected the n1en for the instru- mental club. They are as follows : Mandolins- Palmer, 'o4, Leader. Howe, 'o3. Manning, 'os,. ]arns, 'o6. Raynlond, 'o6, Gibbons, 'o6.,

Sec. & Treas.-- J. Cunninghatn. . - . . . . Asst. Bus. l\1gr. Concorc.liensis--L. Hart. VESPER SERVI'CE. Although the weather vya:s very unpleasant; a number of fellows attended the Vesper Ser- vice. l\1r. G. E. Van Loon took charge of the n1eeting. ':l'he speaker of the afternoon· was Rev. rr. F. \Vhitten1ore, pastor of the First Baptist Church. The two thoughts that the speaker desired especially to convey were, that each of us is privileged to be a laborer for God and that our work is to be tried, tested. and purified. The condition of countless young men in this city was referred to, showing that there is a grand opportunity for college n1en to do mis- sionary work. CAMPUS HAPPENINGS. Last Saturday the members of the Union Chapter .of Delta Phi very informally enter- tained a few of their friends at the Chapter House. Among those present frotn the city ':vere Mrs. S. 13.

The election of officers of the Adelphic Literary Sociecy has been postponed until \Vednesday evening, Oct. 8. Olmstead and von Dannenberg were in- jured last vVednesday in football practice.

The attention of the r 904 Garnet board is called to the fact that the board will meet in Silliman Hall on every \Vednesday at 5 P. ~'1. Every n1an is ·expected to be present at every meeting. 1'hose cotning fr01n the Albany de- partments will be expected to be present at least every other n1eeting a:1d as n1uch oftener as they can 1nake it convenient. It will require the hearty support of ev~ery student in the University to insure such a suc- cess as we hope to make the Garnet this year. THE NORTHFIELD CONFERENCE The annual conference at Northfield was he 1 d this year fro n1 June 2 7 to J u 1 y 6. ~·1 en fron1 the Y. l\L C. A's. of all the eastern col- leges and preparatory schools were there and ten most enjoyable days were spent. These conferences were started in 1886, when a handful of Christian n1en got to~ gether at the Mount Herman School near East Northfield, Mass., to discuss the Christian work in the colleges. Fron1 that ti1ne on the n1oven1ent has increased until now between six and seven hundred students assemble year- ly but a few miles fron1 the first place of meeting and listen to the vvords of n1en known throughout the world as christian leaders, such n1en as Catn pbell, 1tl organ, Robert Speer, Dr Kelman and others. Besides the meetings in the large auditoriun1, the beautiful out-door life and the companion- ship of n1anly tnen is what 1nakes Northfield what it is. Every afternoon fronl' one to six o'clock is given to recreation. All kinds of athletic sports are indulged in, walks are taken and the Connecticut river is a favorite place for swimmers. This year _there were I28 . entries in the tennis tourna1nent which was won by Prh~ce­ ton. Yale won the baseball and also the golf championship. Basket hall was played on the rainy afternoons and the to urn amen t vvas \von by Columbia. One can probably not spend a finer fourth of July an)~where than at Northfield. The fun begins in the track meet in the afternoon and

14 THE OONCORDIENSIS. lasts up to the dying embers of the bonfire 111 the evening. rfhis nleet has many ludi- crous features including obstacle, potato and sack races. Colu urbia having four or five members of her track tean1 present easily vvon the meet with Han:ard second. After supper, ·where a good rousing tin1e was had in the immense dining hall, the detegations from all the colleges began to form outside ready to enter the a uditoriun1. Each Harvard man carried two or more red balloons. Yale wore blue ribbons w bile each Union n1an wore a I· tiny U pennant on his coat. Thus forrning a line, each college represented in a different way, over six hundred students filed in and it was all Chainnan l\f ost could do to get silence after twenty to thirty minutes of enthusiastic cheers. The speaker of the evening, Pres i- dent Woodro'v vVilson of Princeton was then introduced and gave a short but excellent pa- triotic speech. After this Captain Chadwick of the Yal~ football team, chairn1an of the athletic con1mittee at Northfield took the chair and called upon each college for its song and and yell. There \~las a fine exhibition of col- lege spirit interspersed at times \vith music by the Alabama quartet. The auditorium was 4ecorated with the :flags of all nations and the pennants and banners of the colleges and held at least three thousand people that· evening. \Vhen the last cheer was given the crowd in high spirits made its way outside to enjoy on the beautiful green a huge bonfire, sixty feet Say I Look a.t the shoe $j SO I houghf of Feary for • · 'flze last pa.ir I gacve high and twe~ty feet square, which it took two days to build. From an article one can get but a faint impression of the Northfield spirit which fos- ters manliness and a strong coHege enthusiasm. The life work meetings on Round Top and every athletic contest is enlivened by that same spirit and one leaves Northfield confident· throughout of hav1ng spent the greatest ten days of his life. Union was strongly represented this year by H. A. Pearce, Raymond Donnan, Gilbert, Cool, Walter Beadle and M. T. Raymond. Pearce got well on in the tennis tourBament while Rayn.1ond got fourth place in the high jump and pole vault. It is hoped that we may have enough n1en next year to n1ake a showing :in the baseball tournament. \No\, said the man in the red tie, ''he never will make an actor. Why the other night I got him into a game of pool and he forgot his cue. Announcement has been made of the tnarri- age, on August 5 last, of Dr. E.

THE CONCORDIENSIS VoL. xx~vr. UNION COLLEGE, OCTOBER 15, 1902. ALBANY LAW ·.SCHOOL. The catnpaign for the offices in the gift of the senior class was short and decisive, lasting but three days. The election was held Wednesday the 8th, in st., and the ticket elected was that non1inat- ed, at an enthusiastic caucus held the previous evening. Little opposition to any of the candidates was manifest, and the principal disagreen1ents were upon questions of parlia- n1entary procedure. The following are the officers of the class: President, Richard C. S. Drummond, Auburn; Vice President, Frederick R. Guardineer, Albany ; Secretary, George Tiernan, Albany; Honorary Vice President, :Yliss Mabel J. vVood, IIerkin1er ; Treasurer, Clinton R. Wiltse, .i\.lexandria Bay; Poet, John J. Lawless, New London, Conn.; Orator, James A. Leary, Saratoga; Addressor, :Norn1an N. Britton, Rochester ; Prophet, Leland L. Boorn, Sche- nevus; Historian, ·vvilliarn Rooney, Ballston; Toastmaster, Leopold Niinkin, Albany; Chap- lain, DJ.vid A. Dyer, Albany; Marshal, George L. Aikey, Springfield, I\1ass. ; Chairn1an of the executive cotnmi ttee, Dwight \V. Marvin, rrroy. Members of the executive comrnittee: Burdette \Vhipple, Salan1anca; Frederick C. Filley, 'Troy; J atnes K. l:\'oster Goshen; Jose Ramos Casellas, Manati, Porto Rico; Frank E. Smalln1an, Otto; Andrew Hanmer, Long Lake. The Junior class election was, to say the least, attended with more excitement than that held by 1903. According to titne-honor- ed custom, the senior class asserted that it was their privilege to attend the junior election in a body, make speeches and motions and occasionally ptlt in a ballot when there tnigh t be an opportunity. An attetnpt was made to have a meeting on Thursday, but the juniors changed their minds after the seniors had invaded their n1eeting room. Demanding excite1nent of son1e kind, the .seniors held- a junior election of their own, and elevated Leland, 1904, to the presidency. But it was on Friday that the election was actually held. The scene much resen1bled a Democratic pri- n1ary, and heads and windows were broken indiscritninately, in spite of protest fron1 the school authorities. No bones were broken, however, and atnid cheers from the few seniors who had succeeded in entering the room, and the larger number scattered about the de-U10· lished windows, the following ticket was elect. ed in toto by a large n1ajority : President, Louis 13. Shay, ~Iorton ; Vice President, John J. Mcinerney, Rochester; Secretary, J. T. VanValkenburgh, vVaterford ; Treasurer, Charles J. Tobin, Albany; Orator, \Villiam 1\'. Byrne, Albany; Addressor, Daniel A. Dugan, Fishkill; Prophet, Niram Devoe, Albany; Historian, Addison H. Hinman, Albany; Toastn1aster, \V. C. Roche, 1\'roy; Marshall, Francis D. Hunter, Troy;· Chaplain, J .. Craig Roberts, Nunda; Executive commit- tee : Chairn1an, George I-I. Smith, Hamilton, and me1nbers Lester \V. Bloch, Albany; vV~ J• K. Cahill, Albany; Louis J. Conway, Tr.6y; Nelson L. Drumn1ond, Auburn; Frank C. Brown, Porter; M. Francis O'R.eilly, I<.ingston. rrhe following are the initiates of the Law School fraternities: Delta Chi--Sarnuel F. 1\foran, of the senior class, Herbert B. Thomas, Rochester;· Edward C. Jamieson, Hopedale, J.VIass.; Fr-ancis D. Hunter, 1'roy; Charles U. Marshall, Troy; Marsh N. Taylor, Rochester; and Vv. 'Vard Norton, Hartford. Phi Delta Phi-Edward Easton, Jr., Albany; George J. Hyatt, 2nd., Albany; Leroy A. Lin- coln, Albany; Frank L. Stiles, 1,roy; and John C. McDowell, Cohoes.

6 It is proposed that the present senior class inaugurate a custom of having Class Day ex- ercises. As events of this nature are new to the Law School, the idea has met with a m,ost favorable reception, and it is probable that this year the numerous class officers-nineteen in all-will be given an opportunity to earn their salaries. Dean Fiero having been called to Ne\v York in the trial of a case, the lectures on Torts to the Seniors have been temporarily discon- tinued, and Mr. Parker has been lecturing to that class on Negotiable Instruments. The regular Schedule calls for lectures ()11 this subject every second Monday. The Juniors are hearing Judge 1,ennant on Contracts and Mr. Battershall on Elementary Law, with Dean Fiero on Torts taking the place of Judge Tennant's lecture each Mon- day. rrhe latter is also leading the seniors through the mazes of Real Property. \Vilbur \V. Chambers, who was graduated from the .l\.lbany Law School this year, has secured a position as managing clerk in the law office of Eugene B. Bre·wster, 26 Court street, Brooklyn.--G·lens Falls Star. Atnong those who have entered this week among the Seniors, John J. La\vless, New London, Connecticut; Percy J. Thon1as, New Berlin ; and in the Junior class, Francis D. Hunter (Colgate) Troy ; Milton DeVoe, Albany. Harry T. Groves, I9o3, has been appointed Librarian of the School for the year. Satnuel B. I~Io·we, Jr., I 903 College, has been elected Editor of the \Concordiens is,\ the University weekly, vice l(reusi, resigned. Borden H. Mills, I 903, is the La-w School Editor. The Senior class, at a n1eeting held Thurs~ day morning, received the report of Messrs .. Marvin, Lawless, and Dennison, the con1.mit- tee previously appointed to draft resDl utions of syn1pathy on the death of the n1other of Harcourt :rvr. Taylor. The report was unani- mously adopted. Many of the stadents of both cl~sses attended the Annual Student's reception giv~!l on Wednesday evening by the Emanuel Baptist Church. Among them were Mess.rs. Rogers, Dyer, Lawless, 1\!Iills, DeVoe, Wright, Whip- ple, Smallman, Smith, 'Gordon, and Groves. · The Board of Trustees has appointed a committee ·consisting of Dean Fiero and Messrs. Lawyer and Van Saantford to arrange for the new course in legal ethics previously spoken of in the Argus. Among the graduates of 1902 who have embarked upon the seas of legal activity are Dudley B. \Vade, who has an office in the County Bank Building, Albany, and Lester T. Hubbard, who is located in the vVaterman Building, Albany, and also has an office in Schenectady. \MEDIC'' NOTES. During the past week, the following men have enrolled as students in the Albany Medi- cal College: George Walrath, of St. Johns- ville, Union, ex. '03, who began his profession- al studies at the University of Vermont, has entered the sophomore class; Chester Thomp- · son Cobb, of Southampton, Mass., 'o4; 'Villiam Sebastian D.e La Hoyde, 'o3, of Brooklyn; I~rancis Joseph Noonan, 'o5, of Troy. \ The number of students who have now matriculated for the coming year is fully equal to the enrollment of any previous year. rrhough the entering class is small, the others, notably the sophomore class, unusually large. The sophomores now number fifty-one, with one hundred fifty-nine as the total enrollment. The Union chapter of Fbi Sigma !Cappa has n1oved from their former quarters at No. s-Jay Street, and are now located in a handsome building at No. 9 High Street.

The twenty-second year of the Albany Col- lege of Pharmacy was begun with suitable exercises on Monday evening, October Sixth, in Alumni Hall of the Medical College Build- ing. President ~ayn1ond, of the University, Dean Willis, G. Tucker, Prof. A. B. Huestecl, Dr. G. V. D. Dillenbeck, Dr. J. W. Jenkins, and Prof. Theodore J. Bradley of the faculty, were seated in the front part of the .roon1, and the students with their friends filled the seats. Dr. Tucker welcomed the students in a few well chosen words. He was followed by Dr. Huested, who delivered the opening address. Chancellor Raymond then made a few timely remarks, after which Secretary Bradley an- nounced the two opening lectures for the Juniors on Tuesday night at 8 p. m., and for the Seniors Wednesday night at the sa1ne hour. The matriculation will not be complete until the end of the week, and it is expected that by that time about seventy will be enrolled in the two classes. .. AMHERST -UNION FOOTBALL. GAME. Under a cloudy sky which threatened a down· pour of rain, Union's team met the Amherst : ·,eleven at Pratt field, on the afternoon of Sat- _urda:y last. The New England team anticipat- ed .a high score in their favor for they had the wee~ previous held Harvard down to 6 points. The enthusiasm of the Amherst students was down, but no goal. At the second kick off Union put more snap into her plays and Amherst was compelled to punt. Union assutned the offensive and by clever '\VOrk by Griswolds Oltnsted and Gul .. nac carried the ball to Amherst's 20 yard line, where they were held for downs. Amherst had reached the 35 yard line when time was called. End of first half s-o. Time, zo minutes. 'rhe znd half was interesting merely for ex- ceptionally rapid concerted plays by the Am .. herst tean1. Our team was constantly on the ·defensive. ...t\t a critical period Amherst, after rushing the ball to the 5 yard line, futnbled the ball and Union was given the ball. If we had kicked, a breathing spell at least would have been given, but as it happened we were held for downs on the spot and on the second play thereafter the ball·went over the line. No goal. Amherst then made some changes in their team and with these fresh. men to infuse new vigor they swept steadily back again with minor hold- backs until another touch-down was secured and Daniels kicked the goal.

The game was a clean and spirited con test. 1,he treatment accorded the Union n1en by the team and other students of Amherst was n1ost gratifying and it will remain a pleasurable metnory to all concerned. The question why we wer.e defeated is easily answered. While the individual playing was equal, An1herst -greatly excelled in tean1 work. Furthern1ore ·they had proved their strength in the Harvard game and were full of confidence. Consider- able i1nproven1ent over the Cornell game '\vas evident, and the men sho·wed that they had mastered the plays taught them by Coach \Vhit- ney. 'The chief fault lay in the line. The tnen played tnuch too high and even when a low play opened a way the 1nen were rather slow to take advantage of it. Very few fun1bles were made by our tean1. Each man on the team should take it to heart that an efforts to play fast ball are expected from hin1. The officials and line up ·were as follows: Umpire-Easton, Yale.

The work of the team thus far on the Union gridiron has been a source of much gratification to all interes-ted in its welfare. In addition to the services of Coach vVhitney and Capt.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 don-appearance of participants at the tin1e scheduled will be rigidly enforced. This tournan1ent which is held annually is anticipated with a great deal of pleasure by the students, and the large number of appli- cants shows that the strife this year wiil be keener than ever before. The courts will be weeded, rolled and marked out by the beginning of the week when practice will begin in earnest. The tourna,ment will take place during the latter part of the week. The association is to be congratulated upon the vim with which it has undertaken the work and upon the tnanifest interest in this· sport it has aroused among the fellows. DR. TOWNE ON A THLE\fiCS. At the first 1neeting of the Sophotnore class in Physiology of Exercise, Dr. Towne spoke a few words on college spirit as 1nanifested in Athletics. He was much pleased by the way the fellows came out to help the football teatn along after their defeat by F ordha1n and hoped the spirit 1night continue. A man does not co~e to college to n1ake star recitations on 1y. He must broaden his scope. To get the n1ost out of college the student n1ust get the 1nost out of himself as well as in hi1nself. Enter as n1any branches of college life as you can and this includes some form of athletics. The track offers a broader field for one to display his skill than does football. . Every man who does. not play football can do son1ething on the track. As a duty to the at.hletic interests of the college he should try and try hard at least. \Vhy can not the same spirit shown every afternoon on the football field cover a wider space ? vVe are to have a Fall meet. Let this spirit get into track work and make the meet a success. The actions of the track ~anagement in regard to next spring will depend largely on the result of the Fall meet and that result will depend largely on the way the fellows turn out every day before the meet. CGptain Pearce is working hard. Just get a little class spirit into you at leas~ and help hiJU along. An ,inter-class meet is lots of fun. Vvork: for your class and you will be working for your college track team. PHILOM.l\~fHE.A...N SOCIETY: 'T'he First 1neeting of the Philornathean society was held in Silliman Hall, October 8.

Though hushed the weH-known voice and dosed the eye Of him whose thoug-ht was e'er for Union's weal, 'Ve love his memorr, his presence feel: The souls of truly great nun never die.

THE CONCORDI~NSIS. PRESIDENT NOTT~ ... We reproduce from an article. in an \Auburn Advertiser\ of 185 I this tribute to the man who gave the greatest impulse to the growth of Union. The article was from the pen of the Rev. S. Mills Day, a graduate of 'so, founder and editor of the College '' Scroll,'' a Kappa Alpha, Valedictorian for his class, Phi Beta Kappa and for forty years Congregational pastor at Honeoye, N. Y., where he now resides : The first opportunity I ever had of seeing President N ott occurred several years sinc.e, when I presented myself before him as a pro- ·spective member of Union College. As I took the seat he. indicated he leaned forward a little and fixed his clear, undimmed eye penetrating- ly upon me for an instant ; then resuming his former position, as if fully satisfied with the perusal of character he had apparently effect- ed, he· briefly and coldly inquired my business. He was dressed with Quaker-like simplicity and was at that time suffering under a severe chronic complaint ; yet there was in his whole appearance an impressive claim to veneration ' a stern· majesty, a commanding greatness that -I had· never seen personified till then. I stat- ed my errand as briefly as possible and gladly took my departure from the overawing '' presence.\ . During my Senior year, however, favoring Circumstances contributed to furnish frequent opportunities for intercourse with the Presi- . de.nt, which I 1nost \:illingly improved. :By th1s means I gained tnany interesting and in- structive facts concerning the character and lif:e of one whom I regatd as eminently great in the highest sense of the word. * * * * * As a presiding officer of a literary institu- ti~~- his qualifications are without exception. H1s knowledge of hun1an nature is really wonderful. He has such influence over the students that, however otherwise diverse, yet will they all agree in yielding him perfect obe- di_~n~~. though he put forth not a single com- mand. It is fabled that Orpheus controlled the motions of the rocks and trees by the , music of his lyre; but Dr. Nott, still· more successful, controls the unruly spirits o.f So?homores and Freshmen by the ~agic of VOlCe. I remetnber that one morning the Chapel bell, very unlike the majority of more animate \belles was found to be minus a tongue. At evening prayers the President alluded to the matter calmly, mildly and even pleasantly, finally suggesting that the abstractor of the n1issing article would save the janitor some little trouble in procuring ·another if he would return the original clapper. ~1 y room was in the same section as the Presidenfs study: early the next n1orning I heard the chink of sotne heavy metallic article on the floor in the hall and then followed the sound of retreating footsteps. Passing out of my room soon after, the first object that caugh-t my eye was the missing clapper, deposited at the study door. That same morning the Chapel bell resumed its customary vocation. * * * * * The following extract from Dr. N ott's address at the Semi-Centennial Celebration of Union College in I 845 is a fair illustration of his style and manner of oratory : \Anxious for the welfare of those who shall live after us, to you, beloved pupils \Vho remain behind we con1mit these objects; and we charge you by the love of rnan, by the hope of Heaven, to see that the poor have benefactors, the oppressed advocates, the Sa- viour of sinners disciples, and the God of Heaven worshippers, so long as you shall remain upon the earth. More than this: not content with obeying God and benefiting man yourselves, endeavor to impart to other minds the same high purpose, to be by them again im- parted ; that thus the Institution in which you were educated may become the source and centre of an influence which shall continue to extend itself till it reaches the extremities of the world and, descending down along the line .of following generations, shall continue

. I 12 'rHE CONCORDIEN.SIS. to bear upon the destinies of mankind till Christ's. second coming.

In his genial conversation, in his instructive teachings, in the devotions of the faniily altar, he benefited, enlightened and led us all; and I ever left his presence wiser and better then when I catne.

He. began by quoting the parable of -:the·· vine : \Every. branch that bear~th not fruit he casteth away ; and every branch that bearetb fruit, he purgeth it, so . that it may bring fo:rth more .fi;uit.\' Front this the speaker drew his text: ''There; is one thing ne.edful.\ ~'his is a very fan1iliar saying of Jesus. Is it an exaggeration. or .a statement ·of truth? Is there realiy only .. one thing we need? He said we need a thousand things every day. The tree needs many things. The dead tree is of no accotn1t ; it is the living tree that finds something needful. The one thing is life. \Ve need it; some fundamental thing. \\Vhat do I respond to now in outward life which I did not respond to two or four years ago? 'Vhich way is n1y life developing ? Is my ideal higher? Now coal is one thing needful at present. There is a great im- mensity of need. If vve need things simply for comfort of life there are many, many things. The question is, what we need it for? The man who studies but once in a great while and then takes off his coat and shirt so he won't go out, locks the door so no one will con1e in, and puts out the fire so he won't be too con1fortable to study, has to put himself under compulsion. He is a man to whotn there is not \one thing needful '' to himself, the inner tnan. A wealthy man has n1any more things that attract hitn than has another. If the man .in- side does not respond to the better choices. it counts nothing. He 1nay be useful, but there is son1ething n1ore in life than that ; his soul expanding in to a higher life, finding good and n1aking good out of everything. \Vhat do we need in our college life ? Pro- fessors, equipment, etc., are not alL. They are of Slnall itnportance. rrhe college should make n1en of different character that they may look at things in a different way. The tnan inside tnnst grow respondent to the best in life. He sho,uld get a different ideal. . .. . ' .l\. christian is not a tnan who does or does not, but a man \vho is. So a college man. He should be a different man· from. what he would have been had he not come to col- lege. A college man . should be a christian man. ,'. l ', Tb De'ltc 0., c ter·VI Pu.tn; A colle~ Satur senta Roch Prof. 'V.

· THE GONCORDIENSTS. CAMPUS HAPPENINGS. The sixty-eighth annual convention· of the Delta Upsilon Fraternity was held in l\1arietta, 0., October 9th and 1oth. The Union chap- ter was represente~ -by H. Pearce and J. F. Pu.tnanl. A n1eeting of the New York State Inter- collegiate Union was held at Bagg' s hotel Saturday afternoon, October 4, the repre- sentatives present being as follows : Rochester University, vV. F.

At a tneeting of the Senior Class held Mon- day October 6th, the following officials were elected to serve the class: Class football Captain-Parker. '' \ M B gr. -- arrett. ' ' track Captain-Hunt. ' ' '' Mgr. -Kessler. On Tuesday morning, October 7th, those who were about the Campus before seven o'clock noticed a large garnet :flag with the numerals 'o6 in large white letters floating fron1 the mast on the dome of the Round Building. Although it is a well .. known fact that it is ex- tremely dangerous for anyone· to ·attempt to put up a flag there, yet s,ome daring freshtnan accomplished this feat. But the flag had not reh1ained there long before the sophon1ores spied it and before the freshmen were awake they had·:tor·n it down and carried it away as a coveted· prize. The captains of the various class foot- ball teams are· beginning to get their n1en together The sophomores and fres~men have already had some light practice in preparation for the . series of class gatnes which will soon be held~ · Each class is boastifig of. their ·chance of win.-,· ing the inter-class chan1pionship and a series of hard fought gam.es is sure to result. Messrs Bishop, Howe, Paltner, Andrews~ Vedder, Brooks and 'Valdron 'were the side· Jines at Amherst,. Saturday. 'I'he appearance of Sillin1an Hall is gt~eatly_ itnproved by the repairs n1ade recently. A fast game of foot ball was played on the Campus Saturday afternoon between Troy High school and U. C. I.

JUNIOR HOP COIVIMITTEE·. 'l'he first n1eeting of the Junior Hop Com- mittee was held at the Psi U 1-Iouse, 'Vednes- day, Oct. 8. Owing to the small attendance very little business was performed. It was de- cided, however, to hold the first Hop on Nov. 7th, in Yates Boat House. 'I'he committee consists of: Chairman-G. V. Sherrill. J. G. Cool. \V. B. 'Vatson. J. F. Putnatn. C. E. McCombs. S.

Mr Pearce announces that every competitor in the tennis tournament has dues of fifty cents before he can enter. Mr. Gould requests the class c0llectors to get some money for football. ·Capt. Gulnac cotnpliments his m.en on the game they played with Amherst. He .also speaks on the necessity of having a large scrub ·out this week. He also seconds Manager Gould's remarks about subscriptions. The Freshmen collected about $7. so. Mr. Peck announces musical rehearsals for this week. The Concordiensis 'board will meet Mo11day evening, at five o'clock instead of seven. Mr Bishop speaks of the enthustiastic cheering that the Amherst students gave their team, and .urges the students here to follow their example. Pres. :Bolles announces meeting of Under- graduate Council in Silliman Hall for or~gani­ .ation. DRAMATICS AT UNION .• Of all the activities of college life, surely one of the most pleasing and at the same Well, if r m not a '' c!eacl one I'' Been puffing up a ficve for shoes that aren't one, k»o, three cwifft that pair right there on my feet. time most profitable is that o~ amateur d~ama­ tics. The pleasure of this branch of work i~ apparent, and a little thought will reveal t:o .eac·h and every student the gain both to . him- self aud to his colleg~e. A colleg.e c~n . he advertised in no better way than by a ,good dranatic organization. Besides the training one receives directly from such occupation he is enabled to put to the practical test much of his knowledge gained in the class and lec- ture room. . The college without such an organization is tbe exception. Union has no such organization, therefore Union. is the exception. And we believe that there is abundant material in college for a first class dramatic club. Any person who witnessed the performance of the \Cercle Com1que\ last spring can · testify to this statement. The people of the city praised its productions and they ought to be able to judge. When we say dra1natic club, we do not mean a one act con1edy run in connection with the musical association, but 've mean an organization founded purely for the performance of dramatic productions of a high order. Dartmouth, Amherst, \Villiams, etc., put on each year plays that would do credit to a professional company. If sufficient interest were taken in this mat- ter, a Dramatic club might be organized, frnm ·which we might derive much pleasure and profit for ourselves and in a legitimate and noble way extend the good name of Old Union.

THE CONC0RDIENSIS VoL. XXv 7 I. UNION COLLEGE, O:OTOBER 22, 1902. No.5. ALBANY LAW SCHOOL. The excitetnent incident upon the Junior class election resulted in the suspension of the lectures to the Senior class on Monday last; pel1ding an investigation of the alleged riot on the part of the Seniur class. Several prolonged class meetings were held on Monday and 'Tuesday, finally resulting in the adoption of a set of resolutions by the class of 1903, addressed to the Dean, assuring him that the action of the class the day of the Junior election was entirely unpremeditated, due to a friendly rivalry between the class, atld further that toward any member of the factllty no discour- tes_s was intended. The Dean thereupon ordered the resumption of lectures on vVednes- day morning and everything is running smoothly again. The Dean finished his lectures on 'Torts to Seniors on the I 6th, and on the I 7th took up the subject of Negligence. Judge Tennant of the faculty has declined the democratic nomination for County Judge of Otsego County. William J. Grattan, '98, is the republican candidate for member of Assembly in the fourth district of Alba11y. \Villiam V. Cook ' . . ' oo, ts the candtdate for the Assembly in the third district of the same county. Both these noininations are equivalet1t to an election. Among those who have lately entered the school are the following: Seniors, Mark Cletus Gillin, \Voodstock, New Brunswick (University of New Brunswick): Pedro E. Raminez, Maya- guez, Porto Rico (University of Pennsylvania). Juniors, \YVilliam J. Healey, Hoosick Falls,' N. Y:; John J. Mcinerney, Rochester N Y · ' . . . ' Gordon B. IvlcCarthy, Watertown, N. Y.; B. B. Han1er, Albany, N. Y.; Jason C. Cook, Troy, N. Y. ; and Leonard A. 'Varren, Catskill, N.Y. The engagem,ent of George E. Pike, College I9oo, law I 902, to lv'Iiss Jessie Stevens Haight, of Albany is announced. Prof. Lewis R. Parker of the faculty was n1arried at noon on Saturday the r8th instant to Ivliss Ellen Vanderpool I-Iun, of A.lbany, at All Saints Cathedral. John J. Lawless, 'o3, spent a few days witl:i friends at Oneida last \Veek. It has been proposed that the class of 1903 give a s,moker at some tin1e in the near future. 'The idea is an excellent one, and it is hop·ed that the class will make it a fair success. The Basket ball team of the Law School is expected to do good vvork this coming season at the Y. NI. C. A. Frank NI. Hickok, ·oz, and Frederick R .. Gua:rdirieer, 'o3, are among the stump orators this fall for the Albany County Republican Or- ganization. \rl.rEDIC. '' During the past week, the election of the Senior class officers has been held, with the result that the following were elected: Presi- dent, Frederick J. NlacDonald; Vice Presi- dent, R. Burdette I-Ioyt; Secretary, Frank. Templeton Stnith; Treasurer, Sylvester Cor- nell Clemans; Ivfarshall, Frederick Ernest Bolt. The election of valedictorian and essayist, together with theit alternates, will be. held as soon as the nan1es of the honor m-en are received from the faculty.

Among the Medical men whose presence was noted were Griffith, 'o3; Hoyt, 'o4; White, 'o4; Hays, 'os; Schermerhorn, 'os; Schirck, 'os; VanBuren, ··os; Chapin, 'o4. _-The. recep~ion a~ the Central Y. M. C. A. .building, to the students of the Medical and . Law Schools· and High School on Tuesday · evening, October 14th, resulted in quite a spirited exhibition of enthusiasm on the part of b~th the Law and Medical departments when two teams representing either school came together in basket ball. The Medics began the yelling with an adap- tation of Union's Rah! Rah! Rah! and later branched off into ·a distinctively medical yell: External Sphincter Palpebrarum Ischi Dici Bombtararum. Medic! Medic! Medic! ;fhroughout the two halves of . the game, t_his cheer was continually used and will doubt- less be heard at the Rochester game on Satur- day as a goodly nutnber of men are planning '1 visit to Schenectady to behold in what ff;lshion their representatives are acquitting themselves 011 the gridiron. ·In the first half, the Medics succeeded in. scoring, Harrig making a very pretty thro'v. In the seco~d half, Clark t.hrew a basket on a foul, and· was followed by Harrig, ·Chappelle, who had two to his credit, and still another by Clark, making a total of sixteen points for. the A. M.

Irving De yo Pell, of the class of 'o6, will be remembered by many of the fellows in the upper classes, as having participated in the sprints in Union's inter-scholastic meets for two or three years, while he was attending the Hudson High School. Pell is a good quarter- miler. At a Sophomore class meeting held on Fri- day afternoon, October 17th, Harry Rulison tendered his resignation as Historian and Charles 'V.

V nion sho\VS great improve- ment; but at times deplorably slow in getting off. Ho·wever, she gained steadily in the first half, playing a good offensive game, but mak- ing no phenomenal gains. Every 1nan played his position well; Gulnac, Cook ,Clark, Oln1sted, Griswold making good gains. Anderson play- ed a cool steady game at quarter. In the second half Rochester assumed the offensive and seemed to puzzle Union son1ewhat by her trick plays. She made big gains, through Union's tackle and around the ends. Hyde and Winters played a good game. In detail : Union won the toss and cl1ose to defend the south goal. Rochester kicks to Gulnac, \vho advances the ball. Union does not gain her distance and Olmsted has to punt. Rochester gets the ball but fumbles on advanc- ing and Cook falls on it. Clark makes 10 yards around· right end, but Union is penalized for holding. Griswold gained five yards. Cook and Olmsted take the ball, but Union loses on do\vns. Rochester does not gain. Gulnac breaks through and gets his man, with no gain on second pass. Rochester punts out of bounds. Gulnac gains through center. Olmsted punts. Rochester fumbles and Cook gets the ball. Clark, Olmsted, and Griswold make good gains. Gulnac is put through center for a pretty gain and Larson goes through tackle, as does Griswold for ten yards. Lars·on and Olmsted each gain some more. Gulnac makes a gain advancing to Rochester's five yard line, and is sent through center for a touch down. Griswold fails to kick the goal. On the second kick off Schuyler gets the ball and advances twenty yards. Olmsted gains around left end. Ollnsted punts. Rochester advances but loses on foul. Rochester gains ball on downs.

To the Dean, Professors and Lecturers, Demonstrators and Instructors of the Albany Medical College and of the Albany Law School. Gentlemen : Your attention is cal- led to the fact that those students of the University in your departments, who are fitted by nature and willing in spirit to aid in establishing a worthy reputation·for college athletics, are compelled to absent themselves from schedul- ed lectures, quizzes, etc., ad infinitum, in order to appear on the ca111pus for football practice in the afternoon. lias not the faculty taken into account the matter of athletics? \Vith the consensus of college opinion in favor of college athletics as a worthy branch of education, no faculty can today properly plead that if the student attends with dili· gence to his regular work there is time for nothing- extrane- ous. But we feel sure that no such conclusion has been. reached by your body. Then in behalf of the students of r Union University we vespectfully make the following request: WiU you. gentlemen of the faculty, take immediate steps toward recognizing athletics at Union by perfecting an arrangement which permits '' Medics '' and '' Law \ men to come to Schenectady for football practice at least three afternoons per week ?

Of course, he felt the importance ()f his position, and why shouldn't he? If he was too busy to accornmodate a traveler whose horse had cast a shoe, why, the nearest shop to his was across the State line and in Kansas. Old Joe had a few other occupations besides being a blacksmith. He was hotel proprietor, politician, and, as he often boastingly said: \Had once been called by a government mar- shal to help round up some boss-stealers.\ The shop was a large shed, built of ''slabs,'' and could be entered by a large door in front I or by a small door in the rear. It contained a forge, an anvil, a pile of scrap iron and a water tub. It was in this shop that the men who had recently returned from the war would come to talk over\ bat ties and discuss army rations. On a small bench i11 the doorway \old man\ Purdy would sit and whittle away at a stick of wood. It was a time-glass to hin1, for as long as the stick lasted just so long 'ivould he ren1ain in the shop. An inverted water pail served as a seat for \Billy\ Bishop, an old n1an vvho had lost his left hand in the .11exican VVar. Every time a remark was rnacle about the fierceness of son1e of the battles of the Civil 'Var \old Billy\ would c9ilne in with his squeaking voice : \That was. no thin' to B.uena Vista. '?

' . . . . .. .. . 1'he excitement before election had never · been greater than. this year. Colonel Perrings was a candidate for village president, Joe · Manton was run111ing for Legislature, whi.le: Colonel Perring's son, Joel, had been n~med ·. as a strong candidate for. sheriff. ~h~ last~ . named position was held by Jim Judson, a man who had been sheriff for two years and yet had·· never killed a man.· No other sheriff of ']as- per county had ever n1ade this boast. It was the day before election and the bla:ck .... smith shop· was the scene of hot debate·. The colonel ·was praising the merits of. his son and trying to show \vhy he should be elected in place of ]in1 Judson when Joel hilnself entered_ the shop. ''Have you heard the news?\ he cried. . .. John Powers has been shot and the railroad con1pany have offered five thousand d~llars' .\ ~ reward for the murderer.~' . There was a motn.ent's silence,' broken only · by the tapping of the blacks1pith han1n1er as he .. rounded off the head of a red hot bolt. . \They say,\ continued Joel, \that Jim Judson ·was the last man seen with him before he was shot, and this morn in' I seed Jim clean~ ing up his gun.

A 1nan \vith a heart like that which did not cease until the Yankee coroner, couldn't tuurder if he wanted to, and I'm going · a man who had con1e to the town as a veteri· to vote for 'in1.\ '' Pooh,\ returned the colonel, \he might better have killed the boss and put him out of misery. No, sah, circumstantial evidence is what we've got; circun1stantial evidence. \Vhy, if Jim Judson was here now, I'd\-- '' \Vell, what would you do, colonel?'' 'They turned and saw the sheriff standing in the doorway coolly gazing into the shop. ''I don't know what you tnay be talking about, but as for n1y killing that poor horse, why, I never even killed a rnan,\ and before the startled colonel could collect his eloquence and his dignity J in1 Judson passed on. J oe1 Perrings saw all eyes turned toward him and was the :first to speak: \What did he say, then?\ \ He said he never even killed a n1.an,\ an- swered the blackstnith, his eyes fixed on Joel. \Why did he look at me for when he said that? I never killed a man, either, \ and Joel Perrings mounted his horse and rode down to- ward the court-house ground. The news that the murderer of John Powers was still at large caused much consternation among the townstnen. ~1any said that the sheriff had not done his duty, while some even hinted that the sheriff knew more about the af- fair than he cared to tell. At the inqu~st that afternoon Colonel Perrings arose to address the 1neeting. The old plug hat was carefully de- posited on an outspread bandanna, and after much furning, coughing and adjusting of spec- tacles, the colonel began : \Gent1ernen and fellow citizens of Jasper county. It is with great pain that I here de- nounce one of our nun1ber as being consarned in the great calamity \vhich has fallen on our to·.vn. But, circumstantial and other evi- dence furnished by n1y son, who is a candidate for sheriff,makes ]in1 Judson the real culprit, and, furthennore, I move gentlemen that we go and get Jim Judson and see him duly punished' according to the very high laws of the State of Missouri. '' vVild cheers rang through the bU.ilding, · nary surgeon arose and cried out : ''Thar now be still. I know who shot friend John, fer he tole me so hisself, befo witnesses. The man who did the shooting, well I swan,. is in this very room.\ Every n1an vvas on his feet in an instant. Joel Perrings' gun gave a roar and a flash. The Yankee coroner whirled round and sank down on one of the long benches. When the 1nen can1e to their senses it was found that the wounded man \Vas not in bad shape, but Joel Perrings had gone. 1'he poor old colonel was so overcon1e that he sat down on his high hat and that heirloom was smashed beyond recog. nition. Joel Perrings ran down the road scarcely knowing where to go. 'l'he blacksmith shop was vacated, so he· ran inside. A covered peddler's cart stood in the shop, with its two sn1all doors in the rear, held in place by a hasp and padlock. It was the work of but a mo- ment to tear out the staple with a spike, and the fugitive crawled inside closing the doors be- hind him. But he had been seen by one man, the sheriff. Jim Judson was not a Sherlock Holtnes but when he saw the broken hasp and the spike lying on the ground he took it for granted that the cart was occupied. Seating himself on the anvil and drawing an arn1y revolver he said : \Joel Perrings, come out of that cart.\ He received no answer. \Joel com.e out here or I '11 shoot through the door.\ .A . .11 instant later Joel had sprung out of the cart, only to look into the muzzle of the sheriff's gun. \Joel said he, \you know what will happen to you if the crowd find you.\ Joel n1oved to- ward the door, but a look at the man with the gun, caused him to change his n1ind. \Joel Perrings,\ continued the sheriff, \it is two hours ride to l(ansas border. My pony is at the door. He should carry you there all right, after that you must shift for yourself. Joel gave a cry of sl)rprise. ''Do you mean that, Jin1 J sand, do y< ''Yes th{ ' .

''Jim Judson, here's n1y hand, if you need a friend any tin1e you'll find me \\Vaitin'.\ But the sheriff only shook his head and said, \I give you my horse but I'm datnn'd if I'll shake hands with you.\ .A.nd a few minutes later the sound of horses feet sounded fainter and faint- er to the sole occupant of the shop. Election morning dawned clear and bright, but there was not the san1e noise and bustle which characterized an election day in Perrings- ville. 1.,he men were assen1bled on the court .. house square, when a n1an joined them and re- lated ·how joel Perrings had been shot and kill- ·ed by a marshall, and that his last words were to the effect that Jim Judson had given hitn a horse and helped hin1 to escape. At the news the crowd went wild \Vith excite- ment. Farmers who had never before lost their tempers were now in a furious rage. Led by Squire 'l.,ompkins, a wealthy cattle man, the crowd {.vent in search of the sheriff. His house was empty! \ Just as I thought,\ said the squire~ \he's skipped the diggins.'' \Vhe_n they reached the blackstnith shop they stopped in amazetnen t, for seated on the anvil was the object of their search. \'Vell said the squire, where's your pony this morning, hey?\ ''\Vhy, I dont know, isn't he in the stable?\ \You know he ain't in no stable, leastwise no stable of yourn. vVe 're now here to take you to the co 'rt-house, Jim, and we're go in' to do it,\ and the crowd made a move to enter the shop. \\Vait a minute,\ said Jim, \I don't want anyone in this shop, keep out.'' They stopped, but the squire roared, '''iVhy boys, ain't we goin' to uphold the honor of Jasper county?'' A.gain the crowd advanced. ''Stop,'' said the sheriff, ''I have a record of never killing a man. If one of you enter that shop-well, I'll break my record that's all.\ \]~m Judson,\ sho.ute.d t,he squire in a severe tone, \we represent the people of Jasper county, Missouri, and dont yeou dare draw gun· on nary a one of us either.\ About the time the excitement was at its highest point, Joe l\1an ton carne into the shop by the rear door. ''\Vhy durn yeou anyhow,'' he cried, \I heerd what the squire en Jitn's been saying, and I'll tell yeou \Yhy J in1 let Joel Perrings escape hin1. D:::> ye re1nen1 ber K.ernel Perrings' other boy, Jasen, who \Vas killed at Shilo? \Vell, him and Ji~11 were in the sa1ne regitnent, and when Jasen \vas a-dying Jiin promised hin1 that he \vould always look after the old n1an and Joel. f-Ie's done it, and I'm goin' to stand up fer hirn,\ and t11e l)lacksn1ith brought his heaviest sledge in a position for defence. The n1en were silent for a n.1o1nent, when Squire 1.,otnpkins cried, \Jim I' tn corn in' in that shop to shake hands with yeou, even if ole Joe there whales n1e with that ham mer.'' And a tninute later the olu blacks1nith shop was filled with a cherring crowd. VESPER SERVICE. The speaker at the Vesper Service was Rev. \V. B. Allis, pastor of the Congregational church. T\1r.

The great questions of to-day are essentially ethical and religious. l\1any think that they can do without religion. 'This is especially true with those believing in Social ism, who ask the .use of religion. How shall '\e 111 eet this question and interpret it to the best advantage? By putting our lives to the great est usefulness. 'rhere is a new profession of which probably few have heard, that of Social Engineer. His duty is to act as mediator betvveen employer and e1nploye. Studying the life and atn1os- phere in which labor lives, he becomes ac- quainted and understands its grievances. He then goes to the employer, not as a spy but with honest purposes growing out of honest convictions, and recommends i1nprove1nent.

14 THE OONOORDIENSIS. 'T'his is an excellent opportunity for those who are interested in. bettering the condition of their fellow beings. Finally, in all your undertakings,, get rid of the idea of \pull \ by burning in your minds the word, ''Fitness.'' The students of Hamilton college voted last Saturday to resume athletic relations with Union, and their football manager was in- structed to attempt to get a garne with Union for last week. Manager Gould received a telegram fron1 Hamilton on his return from Atnherst last week asking for a game Monday or Tuesday_, but as it was too late to arrange 0 for ct gan1e on those days at that tin1e, he was obliged to turn away the offer. COLLEGE MEETING. Meeting called to order by Pres. Bolles. l\1gr. Gould reported on the action of the Athletic Board. At a tneeting of this board held Oct. 15 in Sillitnan Hall the football schedule for I 902 was ratified up to the game of Oct. 25. The other games were not ratified owing to a lack of funds in the treasury to insure the payment of guarantees required. The other gaines will not be ratified unless the men in college, who are short on their tax, pay it pron1ptly. Every tnan who owes any part of this tax must settle at once or the season will have to be closed when only half con1pleted. The policy of the Athletic Board is the same as it has been for_ the past two years. 1\'he board will not ratify ga1nes until money is in the treast1ry. There are no further games ratified. The tnanagem~ent has just about completed negotiations for a game with Hamilton and it will not be ratified until there is money eaoug~ in the treasury to meet the expenses. 'The HatniltoB students are all eager for this game and Union should also be desirous of the gatne. So be out and support our tean1 both · financially and by playing on the scrub. Dr. rfowne also spoke on the subject of Basket Eall. He spoke of the revival of in- terest in basket ball in the larger colleges. In the natne of the Athletic :Board, he promised recognition by that body. Parker aroused enthusiasm to the h~ighest pitch by a forceful speech calling for more college spirit at Union this year. He also read a list of about forty n1en in the three upper classes who are expected out every day for the rest of the season. He also said the whole Fresh1nan class ~was expected to be out every day on titne. Cap't Gulnac then called for n1en who would accompany the team to Clinton this Saturday. About twenty-five men volunteered. T'he freshman class was se-verely censured by Pres. Bolles, for hissi,ng at a remark made by a Senior.

THE OONO,ORDIENSlS. 15 HIS TAX. In a village over yonder Reached by railroad and by boat, Lives an antiquated gentleman The owner of a goat, And when he came to pay his tax 'Twas his unhappy fate- For the goat he'd paid five ciollars The assessor taxed him eight. He fussed and flurried for a while Then made the assessor look And show him how the statute read As entered on the book. Now this is how the law book read And the law he had to meet, '' Two dollars per ' foot' for property Abutting on the street.\ R. vV. C. THE PINES. I. Tall, stately, black against the evening sky, The sombre pines rock to and fro and sigh And sob with bitter accents sad as death, They whisper low, with softly murmuring breath. II. Rocking their waving plumes and speaking low, In sad soft tones of pain that none can know; In moans of anguish and in unshed tears, They speak of life and death and future years. III. Oh lonely pines! Majestic in your height! Can you not see beyond our dreams into the light? Tell us, 0 mourner, teH us, whyye ever m,oan? Reveal to us the secret of the Great Unknown. s. c.'

'• I • , • .. THE Co-NCORDIEN.SIS Voi. XXVI. UNION COLLEGE, OCTOBER 2'9, 1902. No. B. HAMIL TON Jt-UNION O. Pleas.ant Re-opening. of Relations Be- tween the Colleges. . A hundred and twenty ... five Union men, in- cluding undergraduates and many 9f ~he y_oung- er alumni, saw the wearers of the Garnet go down to defeat at ·Hamilton college Saturday. In the first half Hamilton made six touchdowns and one goal from a fr~e kick, summing up to 31 points. Union braced and kept the Clinton men from scoring ·in the second, and 31 to o was the final· score. It was the first athletic ev.e.nt bet,veen the two colleges since the trouble three years ago, and though Union men as a rule scarcely hoped for more than a tie game, such an overwhelm- ing· defeat suprised everyone. 'l'he team did not lack for side line support, for the cheer- ing ofits supporters was much better than that by Harnilton, and was as good, if not better, than is done on the campus here. . . 'rwo full elevens went to Clinton, besides six substitu-tes. The treatment received fron1 Hamilton was the best that could possibly be accorded a visiting delegation of college men .. The defeat was made lots easier for Union by Hamilton men by the excellent manner that both the team and its followers were enter· tained, and the re-opening of atheletic relations between the two colleges, though disastrous for Union, \vas still_.very pleasant. 'I'he only cause to which the defeat can be as-. signed is to the large nutnber of new men on the team and their inability to get into the game, the result being that five or six men played the better part of the game. . One fault of Union that was painfully evident was the lack ·of snap- py work, as well as speed. 1\'ime and again flamilton would line u.p, giv.e .stgnals, .pass, ~.he . b~ll and start the play before their opponents were in their places. The backs, Olmsted, Griswold, Guln.ac and Sherrill, did good work. Sherrill dropped punts, but for a man of his weight he got in all the plays in fine shape. Collier, Bolles ·and Larson did the best work in the line. The work of the ends was good. Cantwell was substitute for Clark in th~ second half, and showed up_w;ell •.. Watson and Staeber also went in the second half and did well. In less than two minutes Hamilton made the first touchdown, and from then until tim~ was called they made t~em right along until· the Hamilton men ceased to yell after each score. The Union men were game, however, and every time the ball went over the line they would give the short 'varsity yell, with \cheer up\ at the end. ~\'he ball was kicked off to Union and was lost on downs, and from that time until near the end of the half, Union never had possession of it. In the second half the conditions were revers- . ed, but Union was unable to score, though the ball was kept in Hamilton's territory the whole half. Hamil ton made the necessary five yards. but once in the second half, and the rest of the time would punt the ball out of danger. Union would carry it back to within Hamilton's 2o-yard, and lost the ball on downs. In this half the Union rooters went wild and kept ,up · an almost continuous yell. Every Union yell was given, and between times they yelled ''touchdown,\ but it was no use; time was called before Union could score. · 'fhe game was a remarkable one for clean- ness. 1\'here was no slugging, on only one or: two instances of offside playing or fumbling. . , Before the teams came on the field, the Union and Han1ilton rooters sang their college songs and cheered each other ..

On Tuesday afternoon, Oct 21, a number of students met in Silliman Hall for the purpose of forming a Dramatic association, such asso- ciation to be a recognized institution of the student body. There has been a growing de- sire for such an association {or some time past, and the success of the Cercle Comique last year, has intensified the interest of the student body along this line. The Cercle Comique, as is generally known, was not a distinct college or- ganization, although composed of members of the student body. Those present at the meeting Tuesday were- Donnan 'o3 · Gould 'o3 ·Peck 'o3 · Howe 'o3 · ', '' ' ' ' , Clark, 'o4; Cool, 'o4; Fiero, 'o4; Ellenwood, 'os; ·Hall, 'o·6; Haight, 'o6; 'King, '~6; and Sutherland, 'o6. · Howe acted as temporary chairman calling the meeting to order. Cool stated that the of- ficers of such an association should be a director and· bu.siness manager. The men present pro- ceeded to the election of said officers. Howe· 0 • was chosen director and George Donn~n b~·si· constitute the charter metnber.s of the associa- tion. That any men1ber of the student pody be eligi'ble:-f0r· · ad;11;1ission ui,on the ·payment of an initiation fee. to be fixed hereafter. The director •'was 'al$~. authoi~ized lo ~ppoi~t a com- . ,• ' . . . ~ mittee of three members to draw up a constitu- tion for the·association, and he later appointed Peck (chairman), Gould, George Donnan. II • 0 OTHER COLLEGES. ' ' Prof. Elmer. W. Smith, A. M., of Colgate Academy, fell from an apple tree Monday at his home. His spine is injured so seriously. that a fatal result is fea-red .. . Despite. the fact that Cornell's income from. all sources this year was nearly $49, ooo, y~t the athletic management faces a deficit of $t,ooo. This condition. was maqe known last w·eek in the annual r.eport. of. the graduate manager. Just what the management will ~o tp make up this de.fici~ has not been deter1nined. THE GUARD!S .\GHOST STORY.'' 'Twas evening irr Wurtemburg. The night was clear, and luminous with starlight. 1'he moon beams as they shot across castle wall and turret made marble gleam white and sbft; yet gleamed it weirdly. The massive bridge that spanned the stream gleamed fragile in the· silver light; the water showed her~ all·lt.tmin;. ous, there black as the darkness in the king's vault at midnight. So even had castle and bridge_ and· water gleamed many times in the··muonlight; a11d always this had· been a pleasant sight- tbr' me·~ Now I looked and feared~· ·I 'vas afraid and - · knew not what' could cause· the fear·; and ·for · this very reaso1~~ perhaps·, I had~·fled··the.place·\ had not ·the fear of ··disgrac-e. mastered ·eve·n .

I the other terror. I was a soldier in the king's guard: I must allow no fears to master me. My duty it was to patrol the sloping terrace midway between castle and bridge. Another guatd~ Rudolph Knopfen, was posted near the bridge. 'Ve were to make our rounds and tneet on the broad walk, leading from the castle to the bridge, four times in every hour. •Twas when I had finished the last patt;ol, save one, that the fear seized me. 'Twas not a fear of man-that I have never felt-it was --I quickened my pace, then went on more slo,vly for \each patrol tnust take the full fifteen minutes,\ and, just as the chimes tolled twelve, I reached the walk. Knopfen was. there before tne. '' The Evil· One,\ he said, and I saw that he was shivering. '' Not the Evil One,\ the trees seemed to murmur. I swear 'twas no human voice. \ Not the Evil One. 'Tis \ Knopfen's gun chattered on the walk. \'1'is witchery,\ he muttered. ,·, The stars shine; the night is warm: yet 'tis cold as the grave. 'Tis cold as the grave,\ he muttered again, and strode off. The chill struck me again, and then I seem- ed to fall asleep. Hark! the trees again! \Not the Evil One. 'Tis--.\ A wild yell drowned the sighing in the trees. \'I'he guard at the bridge,\ thought I. A shower of water drenched me to the skin. An1azed, I felt the ground at my feet. It was dry. I listened! All was silence. I ran headlong to the end of the walk. The guard was gone. Something gleamed on the bank of the stream. I hurried to the spot. 'Twas the guard's helmet, and neatby-the guard himself. ''The fall has killed him,\ I thought, and I felt for his pulse. He was dead. His hand was cold and wet. I unloosed the great coat heavy with water. 'fhe water fell from the coat to the ground yet did not seem to moisten it. I felt the ground. 'Twas dry. A voice sighed in my ear._ But that I may never tell. · w. c. M·EE·TING OF ATHLETIC BOARD. Oct. 15, I 902. In the absence of the Presi- dent; Strong, '99, takes the chair. Mgr.

How the Star of Good For- tune Rose and Set and Rose Again, by a Woman's Grace, for one· John Law of Lauriston,\ by Henry Hutt. Brown- ~errill Co.]. · ··In ~' The Mississippi Bubble'' we have an interesting account of the financial schemes of John. Law-, the Scotch adventurer, who figured s~ :largely in France during the Regency. As a true portrait of an historical personage, the. auth9.r's Law is a trifle unconvincing, but a.s the 4~ro of a novel he is a delightful person- , age. John Law and his brother Will set out for London to make their fortunes. The fonner is a handsome, shrewd, lucky fellow, who dices his way into the best club in the old city and storms .. the heart of one of the proudest heauHes of the day. Imprisoned for duelling, escaping by a won1an's aid, he sets sail for the colonies and after much adventure founds a little settle-. ment on the Jvlississippi where he builds the structure of a great financial undertaking out of the gossq.mer threads of fantastic dreatns. I-lis ill fortune pursues hitn and destroys his happiness.

Then the bubble expands glistening with all the colors of the rainbow of fashion, wealth and beauty but never happiness until the Re- gent in his folly sticks his august finger thr0' the slender wall of credulity and the bubble breaks and with it the haughty spirit of John Law and the iron resolution of Lady Cathe- rine l(nollys and the s~ory ends with a delight- ful vision of peace and joy. S. B. H., Jr. ALBANY LAW SCHOOL. I-Iorace E. Stnith, LL. D., Dean of the Albany Law School from 1879 to 1889, passed away at his home in Johnstown, N. Y., on Sunday, October zoth, 1902, having attained the ripe old age of eighty-five years. Dean Stni th was born in vV eston, Vermont, and obtained his education in the schools and academies of his native state. Admitted to the bar in 1844, he practiced at Broadalbin, N. Y., for several years with marked success, and in 1847 removed to Boston, Mass., where he forn1ed a partnership with the late Hon. Henry Stanton, .'\tvhose wife was the celebrated Elizabeth Cady Stan- ton. There he came in contact with some of the greatest lawyers of the time, and it was no less a 1nan than Daniel 'Ve bster hitnself who, being associated with hin1 ii1 a famous case, said of hi1n, \ I like the bearing of the young man.'' vVhile in Massachusetts, l\1r. Smith took a prominent part in the organiza- tion of the Republican party and was editor of ''The Free-S oiler,\ a prominent anti-· slavery o~gan of the day. He served in the

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 Massachusetts legislature in I8Sr-sz. In r852 he received and de.clined a nomination to congress. For five years subsequent to r854 he practiced law in New York City, the New England clin1ate having proved too rigorous fo\r the health of his -vvife. Mrs. Smith dying in 1859, he ren1oved to Johnstown, N. Y., and practiced there until r 87 9, having as partners successively Hon. John ~1. Carroll, his son Borden D. Smith, and .Andrew J. Nellis. In 1879 he was elected Dean of the Albany Law School, succeeding Hon. Isaac Edwards, LL. D., and in the course of his ten years connection \vith the school delivered n1ore than 200 lectures in each year, covering practically the entire range of legal lore. During this period he was chairn1an o_f the State co1nn1ittee on achnissions to the Bar. In I 88o he received the degree of Doctor of Laws fro1n Darttnouth College. Since his retiretnent fron1 the faculty of this school, he has been engaged as counsel in 1nany ilnpor- tant cases, and has devoted a large part of his titne to the wriLing of text-books, two of which at least, are \vell-known, '' Sn1ith on Personal Property,\ published in 1893, and \Stnith on Juridical La-vv,\ brought out in I 901. One of his prvfessional brethern, who has been for years in tirnately associated with hin1, says of Dean Sn1ith: \ Since Daniel Cady there has not been in Fulton county liis super- ior as an· all-around lawyer. He ·was kindly and helpful to his students, faithful to and zealous for his clients, and of scrupulous integrity.\ l-Ie was a brother-in-law of \Villian1 R. Davidson, the present Secretary of the facul- ty, and is survived by his wido·w, four daugh- ters, and a son, Borden D. Smith, City Attorney of Johnstown, besides ntnnerous grandchildren.

'\Vhen the students learned that, begin· ning with the present term, an addi· tional term fee of $8, was to be levied on each man in college, including the scholarship men, much speculation arose as to the uses to which this money could be put, It was supposed that the $4,000 thus added to the income of the college might in whole or in part be expended to a great advantage upon the gymnasium, college baths and toilet rooms, and in general upon the improvement of existing conditions. But as the weeks have changed· to months and the fall term is half completed such hopeful plans for improvement are not being perfected and conditiOf:iS are going from bad to worse. \Vhat, then, are the most noticeable defecti in matters which are of such deep interest to the student mind? Ist. The gymnasium is in the worst condition that it has been in for many years. New apparatus is needed and a. general overhauling and renovatiqn, .2nd. The toilet roo~s are in such a condition that .a self·respecting man hesitates to enter them. 3rd. The library has been closed at least two Saturday evenings, ~nd is open for much shorter hours during the week than has been the custom hitherto. It is on Satur· day evening that the students can do their best work in the library, and to deprive them of this opportunity is unjust, to say the least. 4th. On good authority we learn that the college management intends to close §llliman llall in order to save the expense of beating, ·although Mr. Silliman made ample provision against the necessity of such an action. To the student mind, an economy in administration is a very necessary proceeding. We are constantly comforted with the problem of cutting down the current expenses of our organizations and we express our loyal support to all needful economies, With the income so materially in· creased by higher tuition fees, by incidental fees, by laboratory fees; with the budget diminished by the resigna· tion and absence of members of the faculty and by a cut in salary of those acting, several thousands of dollars are being raised this year above the amount at which the deficit is estimated. Apparently the $4,000 incidental fee is largely responsible for the increased assets, Every manufacturer knows that the best economy is to maintain his machinery in good repair. \Ve claim that in the four instances given the machinery of Union College is not in good repair. Here seems to be a logical and reasonable use for the incidental fee collected from the students of Union College, PASTORALE. Deep down in the west, the sun setting Bedecked the dark clouds with a glow, And angry winds howling and fretting, Made wayfarers hurry below. The moon, as if frightened, appearing, But rare from her dark shelt'ring cloud. And through the gaunt branches uprearing The tempest flew shrieking aloud. Skirts of dust from the highway, the breezes Sent hurrying through the chill air, And the North wind as ev'rything free_zes. Has shut up for winter the bear~ The farmer when far outward peering Perceiving the wind and the cold Is thankful he put off the shearing Of the sheep now SO· snug in their fold.

B. H., Jr. VESPER SERVICE. Dr Towne spoke at the five o'clock service in Silliman Hall ·last Sunday. The subject he made interesting and practical and was thoroug- ly enjoyed by those fortunate to have heard him. The doctor began by quoting son1e words of Solomon from Proverbs: \A wise n1an is strong, yea, a wise man increases in strength\; from Eccl: ''Young man, rejoice in thy strength-put away evil fron1 thy flesh.\ A young man should rejoice in his strength, this gives a cone·ge responsibility. He is account- able for what he does and should use his strength for God and put evit under his foot. This applies to n1ental strength as well. A wise · mall is strong, What tnan is strong but a young man? A11d what young n1an is more apt . . . to be wise than a college man? Hence a col- lege man con1bines both and why should he not use his strength wisely. It is reasonable to sup- pose that a strong man can do most. A strong soldier who can endure much, of hin1 n1uch is required. He n1ay be sent alone on a perilous enterprise. The same is true mentally. An infant is not responsible for breaking or misusing what he takes hold of. It has no ·mental development. A few years later he is more accountable for what he does. A man is responsible for the light he has. ..c\ young n1an in college is the n1an that has n1ost light, Such a man has a deeper responsibility; he has a double responsibility being strong in body and strong in mind. We must develop ·what we have. It is evident, if we have anything good we must develop it on both lines. We admire a young healthy strong muscular n1an but we adtnire hitn more if he has courage. One man as strong as another but lacking courage is en- tirely in the hands of the other; the courage is not entirely physical. vVe tnust develop our- selves for use in God's service. Any other motive is fully selfish. It is the duty of a n1an to develop himself physically. rl'his is done by resistance. The satne rule applies to nlen- tal development. We must take in all phases of college life but in no respect neglect the mental. The n1ental is the most impor- tant, for a man of strong thought can do most in the world. rrhis cannot be gotten but by resistance by getting strong physi~ cally and mentally and to develop the higher life. Physical development for the sake of physi- cal development and tnental developn1ent for the sake of n1ental developn1ent an1ount tp no- thing. Our n1otive should be the enlarging of the soul. Temptations cotning thick and fast and overcon1e by fighting give college men vast opportunities to do this. Do we not adn1ire the n1an most who we kno·w is doing God's work in the w·orld? The chance of being such a man ourselves is given to every one of us.

E. church at Albany was crowded at noon on W ednesclay, October 22, by friends and well wishers who had gathered there to witness the wedding of Miss Jessie Stevens Haight, daughter of !fr and Mrs Samuel James Haight, who at noon was married to Mr. George Elwood Pike of Lockport. The Rev. E. P. Stevens, presiding elder, performed the ceremony, assisted by the Rev. A. H. Lucas, pastor of the church. The Rev. Mr. Stevens baptised J\'liss Haight when she was a month old and she bears his name. The bride- groom is a graduate of Union. 1900, Albany Law school, 1902, and was admitted to the bar in June of this year and later to the Iowa bar. Following the ceremony a reception was held at the residence of the bride's parents, 488 \Vestern avenue. The floral decorations consisted of ferns, smilax and pink chrysanthemums. A wedding breakfast was served by l\IcElveney. During the afternoon Mr and Mrs Pike left for their home in Iowa. The out-of·town guests were: T\lr. 1:;-'. R, Champion, Mr. A. B. Andrews, l\1r. T. R.

Cl\.l\1:PUS r~.~OTES. It is to be hoped that Union will be repre- sented by a basketball te2..1n this year. It has been two years since the college has been represented in this branch of athletics and there are a nun1ber of good players in college who could fonn a nucleus for a fast tean1. T'he athletic advisory board decided last year to take the basketball tearn under its supervi- sion and run it as the other tean1s are. Al- ready offers of dates have been received frotn other colleges and there vvould be little trouble in seC\lring games. The expense of running the team would not be a very large tax upon the student body and basketball is becon1ing n1ore and tnore of a college sport every year, and it is high til11e that Union had a recognized standing 111 basketball as well as in other branches of athletics. A new college cheer \vas used at Clinton last Saturday, which received the unqualified approval of all. It was as follo,vs: I-I'ray! }I'ray! Rah! Rah! Rah! Union! R.ah! Rah! Rah! Union! Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah ! Rah! Rah ! UNION!! At a 1neeting of the Undergraduate Coun~il, Oct. 14, it was decided that the unwritten code of ethics of the college should be put into 1nore tangible fonn, for the benefit of all classes, especially the freslunan class. A committee was appointed for this purpose.

The musical association rehearsed last l\1on- day ni~ht and the work in all departments is pr()gressing fatuously. So well has the di- rector trained the voices of the glee club that the n~anager feels very much encouraged; and is satisfied that the :first concert which -will be held in Redmen's Hall, Scotia, Nov. 20, will be a grand success. The in iti~tion of the Psi Upsilon Fraternity was held Saturday evening, October 18th. The following men from the class of I 906 9 were initiated: Le Van R. l3arnes, Clyde, N.Y.

THE OONO.ORDIENSIS . 15 . The amount of class spirit shown by the freshmen is· frequently ·brought to light by their various attempts to, in son1e tnanner, arouse the enmity of the sophomores. Last week a telegram was received by a sophomore, fron1· an anonymous person in Albany inform- ing him that the freshn1en were holding a ban- q~et. in I<.entnore HoteL The sophomores be- lieving this to be true imrnediately despatched two n1en to Albany to investigate this rutnor. After wandering about Albany for two hours in vain search for the wily \frosh\ they re- - \ turned to Schenectady disgusted with _their easiness. 1'his strategic characteristic shown by the freshmen should at once arouse the sophomores and cause them to realize that the freshmen are· very likely to out-wit them and hold their banquet with unmolested convivi- ality. At a meeting of the Junior class it was re• solved that·the class should secure class canes and a committee consisting of- Chairman Robert vV. Clark, George V. Sherrill, Leland vV. Irish, was appointed by the president to secure sam- ples of class ·canes. It was also decided to hold one banquet each term. This was agreed upon in orde~ to have son1e means of increas ing class spirit and s.ociability. 1'he following officers were also elected: . . Captain of Foot-ball Team--\V. B. \Vatson.
