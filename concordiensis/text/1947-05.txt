Cooks Cry 'Unfair' In Cafeteria Clash ''We tt·y to put out stuff the fellows won't get sick on,\ explained one Hale House cook when asked yesterday for his views on food complaints registe1·ed by students in a recent Delphic S<.>ciety survey. Appeal'ing deeply wronged by the criticism leveled at them, cooks H. Allen Campbell and l\laecel Salvet defended their preparation of food in a Concordiensis interview. They labeled the Delphic Society survey \unfair d1arging it was directed by fraternity mem- bers who do not eat at Hale House. -------------------------------------------------------------~ In an attempt to get the campus cleaned tip before prom and kept neat in the futur·e, Frederic A. Wyatt, Alumni Secre- tary, has initiated a program of student and faculty participation. All fraternities, dormitories, and departments on the campus havl' been alocated areas for which they are responsible. Because of the heavy rains and prevailing had weather this spring, the limited grounds crew of the college has been unable to clea.n the campus of leaves, paper, and other trash. Conse- quently the aid ot the entire student body is being solicited for· the purpose of beautifying the grounds. The facilities of the college including rakes, hoes, and shovels are to be used as well as the college trucks. It is hoped that the plan will meet with full cooperation. Each student who takes part in the clean-up campaign will be listed as a contributor to the 1947 Gift Fund. The Office of the Comptroller has announced that 65 cents will be given to the fund for each hour of student aid. This money will be used fm the purpose of bringing students from the devastated areas of Europe to the United States. These students will receive college educations that they could not get in their own countries because: of the damage done to European centers of learning by the war. Fraternities and dorms who gather leaves and trash are requested not to burn the piles. When such piles of trash have been accumulated, Mr. Wyatt should be contacted and the college trucks will be sent to take the debris to the incinerators. --- Tickets on Sale Now For 'Showboat Serenade' Ticket sales for \Showboat Seren-~---------~---­ ade\ the Junior Prom of the Class of 1948, surged upwa·rd this week as the May 9th date approached, John Newton, ticket chairman, an- nounced today. Newton stressed the fact that the price of the valued ducats will go up one dollar Wed- nesday and urged that students pur- chase them as soon as possible. A list of ticket agents was re- leased in Chapel yesterday. Off- campus men can buy bids from Bud Ottaviano, Martin Dumont, or Lot Cooke. Agents in the dormi- tories are Jim Morton, Jerry Coonan. B. McGrath, Jack Hotch- kiss and R. A. Williams. In addi- tion t.o the above men there is a ticket seller in each of the Fra- ternity houses. The Committee under the direc- tion of AI Lewis, Chairman, has made arangements with a local florist to obtain flowers at a 20 percent 'price reduction. Flowers can be ordered in the Student Ac- tivities Office any noon from 12:30- 1:30 PM. Although \Showboat Serenade\ is the main attraction of the week- end, a complete program .of enter- tainment has been built up around the Junior Prom. The Prom itself will be held in Alumni Gymnasium Friday evening, with dance music supplied by Tommy Tt1.cker and his otchestra from the hours of ten until two. Two other events are listed on the Friday sochedule; A baseball game with the Ithaca College nine in the afternoon and the annual Interfraternity S~ng in the evening. Saturday's program includes base- ball, lacrosse and tennis matches, all against Union's traditional foes from Hamilton College. Saturday evening the Fraternities will spon- sor \open house\ at their dances and the neutrals will run a dance in Dewey Hall. The schedule tapers off and comes to a halt .Sunday afternoon with various groups on the campus planning picnics in neighboring areas. The Committee which has plan~ ned one of the most active week- ends Union has ever seen includes AI Lewis. John Newton, Al Hill, Joe Fucigna, Konstanty Kllm, Ralph Fingar and Spence Gowrie. Delphic Answer The survey was made by the Delphics in answer to explanatiolils by college officials that complaints made in student council meetings and in other quarters did not nec- essarily represent the views of the student body, according to one member of the Delphic Society, Conducted solely among those who eat at Hale House, the poll showed that 80 per cent of the stu- dents believed the food to be un- satisfactory in quality at the time of the survey. William South, Steward of Hale House, complained he could not offer food of higher quality or in gt·eater variety at prices now in effect. He said, however, that for an average increase of 10 cents per meal a wider choice could be offered. Food Gets Blame Asked about several minor com- plaints made by students, South said, \They always take out their gripes on the food.\ He admitted inability to understand complaints of stale bread, and dismissed al- IPgations that cold food was served with the explanation, \The boys get their food, sit down and bat the breeze for a while. Then they com- plain the food is cold.\ Dishes are sterilized and dried by air, South explained, and are thor- oughly clean even though spots of dried water may be found on them. The cooks at Hale House are for the most part, South said, chefs at area resort hotels who work here during the resorts' off-seasons. Both he and the cooks maintained that adverse criticism by students here would be injurious to their professional reputations. Many of the complaints, however, resulted from the method in which the food is served by employees at the counter. This situation, said South, has resulted from the use of inexperienced help. He expressed willingness to sat- isfy student wishes insofar as pos- sible, saying, \If the boys have any gripes, I wish they'd come to me. I'll do what I can for them.\ 0 Prexy Takes Stand Again Next Tues.

However, Miss Chen and Mrs. Yia vividly described the Japanese occupations in their respective countries. During the period from 1937 to 1941, Miss Chen had little contact with the enemy troops due to the fact that she was living un- der foreign protection. At that time, according to Miss Chen, only part of the city was under Japan- ese control. Contrary to current opinion at the time, the Japanese were careful not to bomb the for- eign settlement; damage there was slight. In 1941, when the United States declared war, the Japanese occu- pied the rest of the city. Also con- trary to the many lurid reports cir- culated at the time about atrocities, most of Shanghai was spared cruel tJ;eatment.

To the casual observer, the mGst im- portant of these problems are concrete and tangible, including the housing situation, ad- missions policr, classroom space, and a dan- get·ous shortage of teachers. Without a ctoubt, these must assume a place of imme- diate concem to the college as a whole. How- ever, we are also witnessing a genel'al change in the attitudes of the student body, changes which may weU affect the college long after the more temporary adjustments have dis- appeared. One of these new attitudes is the idea of most students that extra-curricular college life is of minor importance when compared to the serious business of preparing for a career. To the great majority of veterans, the wol'ld has swift,\· left them in the lurch and they must hasten with like speed to catch up with it. No more can be said of this problem than has been pointed out in the pages of this paper, by Yarious members of the facult,\·, such as Dr. Johnson, nnd by many speakers in the chapel. However, another question has been seeth- ing beneath the surface of public comment l'or some time, expressed in bull sessions, bit- ter letters, and small pressme groups. This is the fratemity question, whether they are justified in thei1· existence, whethet· they better the student, and whethel' the,\· se1·ve the college. Clear the Air This matter does not seem to be only of passing importance since sentiment has been growing steadily throughout the countr~; against the fraternity system, even before the advent of the \mature veteran\. Mud- slinging has been common on the non-ft·ater- nity side, indifference and condescension the t'ule on the other side of the fence. This ob- viousl,\· will never help matters. Unfortun- ately, many of those who criticize the sys- tem are not sufficiently familiar with its vmrkings. The issue and the facts support- ing both sides lie in the shadow of p1·ejudice and suspicion. Therefore, as our small contribution, we are planning an attempt to bring the entire question into light, to give both sides with- out premature voicings of our own. Next week, on the editorial page, a double editor- ial featme will be mn, the pro section by a well-informed fraternity man, the con sec- tion by an equally competent neutral. Ideas, Opinions Needed The fraternity system will in no case be on trial, no!' will an indictment be offered onb· a statement of fact. We sincerely hope that the student body will respond freely with their personal opinions, whether by let· ter o1· by comment to us. Remember that this problem can be of prime importance in the college life of those in classes of the fu- ture. If the system is wrong and breeds ;'.t uup snobbism, it should undoubtedly be , '>olished. But if it aids in building character and adds the personal touch to academic edu- cation, then it should be preserved. Perhaps ~·our ideas will help in finding the answer. The results of this past week's student counci1l elections indicate several interesting trends, and point the \vay to a more vigorous participation of the students in undergradu- ate govemment. In passing, it might be well to note a few facts. In general, the election was a contest be- tween the fraternity and the representative slates. In aH fairness, it can he said that neither gToup wished for a complete land- slide. First, many of the fratemity men are anxious for Heutral men to assume a share of the responsibility. Thus, the weight of criticism also would be shared. It has been rather heavy and those in power know it. Second, the other g1•oup is sincerely interest- ed in keeping the council a t•epresentative body; this is proved by their action in plac- ing several fraternity men on the ticket. After final tabulatiGn, the vote showed that the fraternities had won six seats, the Representatives four; three others were dually backed, and another was tied. The last place was taken by an independent. This insures a halanced council, and according to the past 1·ecord of the men elected, a council willing to work conscientiously for Union and the students.

Cin·uluHon .\Junu~·t~r Sweet and Lovely It seem::; only fitting that a sincere word of welcome !Je extended our charming \Showboat Serenade\ visitors. There is much to !Je said of the value of proms at Union, but their top selling point is the chance to enjoy the best in female com- panionship. Of comse, that's putting the case mildly. By this criterion, the dance should be easily sold out. The Prom Committee and student !Jody have done everything possible to make the Prom the outstanding event of this and past years. If you look at the schedule, there can not be much argument against their success. Congratulations to them, and to their dates a warm welcome, a short word to \have fun\ and the admonition that the weekend will !Je all too brief; so make the most of it~ Clarification Dear Sir: The headline in last week's CONCORDIENSIS read li!{e a barroom brawl -ot· walkout strike: \Cooks Cry Unfair in Cafeter-ia Clash.\ The arti- cle told of a society 0n ca1npus, made up of few students and representing none, that conducted a poll among some stud.entt•-how many we wete not told-to discover that 80'/r of these think that the food WP eat is of low quality. They then walked into Hale House, name-of,an-organization strong, and f.irt>d questions at Mr. South and his cooks. This procedure smells. I am sure t·hat this group of students have all the ·earmarks tand po;;>ibly ;;orne eye and nose mark;;·) of good campus citizens; they remind us of vigilantes of the old West; they are zealou;;; they are· even overzealous. Bill South happens to be a democratic kind of individual. Anybody can tallt to him at anytime ar.d discuss, suggest, and argue with him about ways and means of improving the taste and quality of food served in the cafeteria. I know because I've done it, The facts are that you can get no meal to com- pale with the average Hale House offering any- where in. Schenectadr for an equal sum, and this holds even if y.uu go down to Ferro's and \stdff\ the ve<J.i-tel thete. I know cv••n thou~h I've never dune this. The facts fu1 ther are that when we sit down in the cafeteria we very natur-ally talk about what's wrong with things. When we get tired of shooting off our· mouths about the administra- tion, we switch to the food. Perhaps more often these are attaclted in reverse order. Most of us know that we do this thing and recagnize it for what it is, a mere letting off of steam. Others make a wholesale issue out of it, get it broad- cast in CONCORDIENSIS, and then sit back in cat-like complacency, ever watchful for a place to sink its claws next; and like a cat, always choosing the softest victims, never one with any power to fight hack. Respectfully yours, DAVID W. STAUB Ed. Note: For Mr. Staub's information, lhe sample in the Delphic Survey included well over 200 of the 400 men who Pat regularly in Ha:le House. The re- T·he stot·y of Union as the Mother of Fratern.ities should •be a familiar one to all Union students, In the eal'l.y period literary societies .predominated as the Philomathean, the Adel·phic and the Delphic Union societies were prominent factors· in college life. However, men an the campus felt the lack of some essential element in this type of organization; they wanted more of a fraternal spirit, something which woald bind them closer together and .fulfill their soda! nerds. Thm.o, ·in 1825, the fi·l'St fraternity was established at Union. By 1871 fraternities had developed to the establ-ishment of ·chaptet· houses In which men .could live together. Since the founding of the system, ft,aternities have been a source of 1 strength to Union College. Just what, then, is that quality inherent in the fraternity system which has allowed it to continue at Union, heat,tily supported by the CoHege Adminis- tration and by most of the students? Obviously fraternities must be contributing constructively to the Coll'e.e, and since the CoJ:lege is composed -of individ,ual students, frate-rnities rn,ust be contributi-ng ' to the life af the individual. A coiiege has two diE•tinct fun-ction:;: first, to offer academic opput·tunities ar.d secondly to develop the pelscnu:Jity, the potentials, and the a:bilities of its students. Providing a faculty, classr-ooms, and ad- minisltative machinery is relatively n1echanical since patterns for this have lung been establi~·hed. Build- . ing character in its students is a process which ·cannot be so easily accomplished by stet·eotyped 'methods. Though provision for the many student aCltivities offer an opportunity· for self-d,evelopment, thie is not enough. Tht·oughout her history, Union has looked, in part, to fratern-ities to supplement that training, association, assistance, and socia-l J.ife that must accompany the academic life of lhe col- lege. In fulfilling this obligation, the fraternities bring credit upon the col'lege· as her sor.s go on into life. The development of the individ ua:l is the essen- tiHi element upon which the fraternity s-ystem must revolve. Though fraternities cannot succeed for each individual, they must buHd character In many parts of the country, whet'e fraternities · have become large and unwieldly, they ha.ve become met·e \eating clubs\ having lost much of their mean- ing. At Union, we have preserved a deeper sig- nificance in our fraternal system. To meet theil' obligation to Union College in the development of the Individual, the J:raternity must JH'OVide an opJ)Qrtunity for practicing leadership, a quality which the college student should acquire during. his education. In this field, the Greeks have undoubtedly offered a wide variety of practica-l ex- perience. The affairs of each fraternity are• very largely guided by the members of that group under the guidance of their chosen leaders. The· president of anY' chapter has an invaluable experience in the affairs of house management and in integrating the · me•!h)lers of his organization. An abHity to assume responsiMlity accompanies the duties of all house officers and committee chairmen. But,. the respon- sibility for a successful fraternity l·ies with all members wha must actively support and cooperate in the affait·s of the chapter. F-raternity houses provide a pleasant place for members to eat, sleep, and hold, parties. These are impot·tant factors in college Ji.fe which the fra- temities at Ur.ion have ·been able to give many of the students. Fm·thet· than this, however, they give the student an opportunity to deve-lop that .part of his education which cannot be attained in the class- room. When a man becomes a member of a fra- tet·nal g·roup ar.d is closely associated with the -oth€1' individu<±ls of that group ,he may find some membets with whom h·e is not too compatable. Yet,. he must learn to get along with ail f~r the :;a:ke of harmony within the membership, On.e of a college's most valuable assets is its alumni body upon whom it depends for much of its support, both financial and otherwise. Hawever, alumni interest is• often difficult to stimulate for as they leave theit· undet·!;raduate days, they may forget the lifelong obligation which they have incurred in attending Union. Our fraternities in supplying a valuable contribution in undergraduate life have acted as a strong tie with the alumr.i in encouraging their interest and support of the College. The -real contributjon of the fraternities to the College must come through the service which they can t•ender in meeting the needs of individuals within the student body. Those who cherish thei·r association with fratemities at Union feel that they at·e meeting their obl-igations in enriching the life of the College community. sults were carefully tabulated. A Evidently Mr. Staub is unduly concerned with th<' n \slant\ he, himself, read into the latest article. We: · Independent's View -By V. C.

It is difficult to be the spokesman for a group as large as the current \neutJ·ai\ body of students now at Union. I know, however, that I voice the opinions I of a large portion of that group. 1 If f · d t d' 'sts- J'ust. \Neutral\ is a rather curious term.

The pattern has a chame- leon character; we are individuals, and we need no support from any group or close clique. Specific reasons did not appear last week· But how can we fit into the scheme of student since we would then have been running the, a.ctivity herB 8.t Union?.

The '. , . . t10n has had 1t that Umon ts a fratermty college; 1ts I'lSk of !Jemg paternalistiC; and We are not most distinguished alumni have been fraternity men, A man may choose his mode of existence. Just as one elects his religion or his politics, one may de- termine whether or· not he will become a \brother\, if he be offered a pledge. We have no quarrel there. It is om· earr:est cesire to work with the fraternit)' groups on campus, without being discriminated against or condoned, contributing our own talents and energies to the advancement and success of thP college and of the activities within it. Whatever at- tempts at objectivity may be made, a governing bod:,- of any kind will be biased to some degree unless it be composed of a tr·uly representative group; it is with this in mind that we view the recent election~ to the Student Council with such plcasut·e. Fraternities\ caused a large amount of mis- understanding as to purpose and point::; of emphasis. llnfortunately, the constructive attitudes under which it was written did not coincide with thof\E' unclE'!' which it was read. Let us :state, p1·imarily, that this is no attempt to undermine the fraternit~· system. However, under its present minorit~· status, the system must be understood and must in turn understand the independent view, in order to contri!Jute what it can. The respon- sibility, however, is no greater for the fra- temities than for the independents. Both have a trust to work for the good of Union, and they can not do this if they are involved in mutual distrust and antag-onism. It is hoped that a frank appraisal of both sides' reasons and attitudes will hasten real under- standing; hence we get cooperation, not lip service. First, the opening half of the article, an· introduction to the question, was a general rliscussion of the fraternHy argument as it was growing in American education. On a national scale, many of the complaints hold water. However, this is beyond our scope since we are interested in the situation at Union. As many fraternity men have pointed out, the fraternities are functioning much better at Union than elsewhere throughout the countQ·. Then, some ask, why run such an editorial'? Are Things Smooth? The answer is this: contrary to what many fraternity men think, there is not a smooth, basic cooperation between the two gToups on ca1npus. On one hand, there is a distinct lack of appreciation of the fra- temities' contributions to Union, resulting in an undercurrent of neg-ative sentiment. On the other hand. there is a similar lack of understanding of the independents' atti- tude. Although some of these independent men l.Jelong in the sorehead, radical categor~·, the o·uardhn ano-els of student o-overnment as have tho:;\ undergraduates who have led student \' ' ~ \\ . enterprises.

We wish to work in cooperation with the frater- nities, for the continual betterment of life at Union. If th~: day should come that the Hou:;es and Lodged are no longer a part of the scene here, it will bt• work of their own doing. Summarizing our discussion, then, I might say that we object to fraternities because we feel that they foster· a limited group consciousness, that they seem to fail in maintaining the fraternal spirit that is their ostensible reason for existence; that their joll- ity seems false and juvenile, to us lacking spontan- aity even in its manifestations in \coliege spirit\; that they offt>r security and eminence only at the loss of independence; that they are a part of life which we lost in the past, which we have no desire to regain. Departing, then, from negative criticism, we statP that we wish to become integral parts of the col- legiate proce!'s of life here at Union, hut without fraternity membership; that we wish to work in con- junction with the present fraternity groups; that we are content to let fraternal life pass by us without attempting to undermine its basic organization.

4 IRC Holds Annual School Conference The need for an International Trade Organization was str·essed at the third annual high school student conference at the college this week. The conference, which was attenedd by over· 160 students fr•om four~ teen area high schools, was sponsored jointly by the International Relations Club and the Schenectady County League of Women Voters. The five roundtable discussions were keynoted by active student interest as evidenced by the amount and the kind of questions asked and the discussions that followed the introduction of various points. The proposals and obstacles confronting the Inter·- national Trade Organization Conference now in progress i·n Geneva were mentioned by one of the roundtables. World Trade principles which pertain to the division of the laboring masses and com- parative advantage of one country over another in producing ·Certain commodities we1·e enumerated. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 and ''eciprocal trade agreements as set up in the Act of 1934 were :;tudied· in relation to present world trade. Another group discussed the influence -of politics and pressure groups in formulating our country's high tariff policies and subsidy allocations. Cartels, tariffs. subsidies, and commodity agreements and their ill effects on world trade were alsc:> studied. It was the opinion of one round table that bilateral agreements should be done away with in favor of multi-lateral agreements. Another group decided that the internal fiscal policy of respective partici- pating countries need stability before international machinery can hope to work. Where's My Date? Here! Here!

The weel1end program is directed by Dr. Erne.st M. Ligon, chairman of the department of psychology and director of the project. Limited registration was closed last week and no sessions will be open to the public. Since 1934 Dr. Ligon and his staff have been in- vestigating and classifying attitudes which tend to make a wholesome and healthy Christian personality. During the past two years, the project staff has concentrate·ct on development of curricular materials by which attitudes discovered in the laboratory might be taught in church schools, public s•chc:>ols, and in the home. The teaching me~hods now in use center in church communities. Seven churches in New Yol'k, Michigan, Ohio, and Washington now use the Unic:>n teaching plan, in- cluding the Westminster Presbyterian Church of Alban,-, the Fifst Baptist Church of Tray and the First Reformed Church of Schenectady.

I (}{>neral Session At the general session the find- ings of the various roundtables were reported by the students at- tending and then summed up by R. J. Pulling, Director of Adult Education for the Schenectady Education Department. He said in addressing the students that,. \Two hours of discussion won't make you an expert on world ecor.omics but it should. be the beginning of a de- sire for more knowledge on the I things you talked about today:· The consensus of student opinion at the ses~ion was that no effec- tive economic international ma- chinet·y can be arrived at until na- tions are willing tu ~.ive· up some· of their sovereignty in favor of· wmld participation. Davidson Speaks President Davidson, the main speaker at thi:; session, after wel- coming the area students to the conference, told them that the United States standard of living could best be maintained by in- creasing the quality and 4uantity of our products so that no other nation could compete.

Whalen, Wallington Spur Trackmen (Continued from Page 1) ~-- third'' to take 26 places out of a possible 45. Hamilton took the re- lay for its only clean sweep of the afternoon. Uni0n took fi·rsts in the mile, 440 yd., 100 yd., low hurdles, 880 yd., 220 yd., two mile, pole vault, shot-put, high jump, and the discus to glean 88 points. The Continentals won the low hurdles, javelin, broad jump and tbe relay to earn their 43 points. Going all the way to Rochester on Wednesday to face the Yellow Jackets yesterday afternoon in the face of 30 degree temprature arrd May snow squaBs, the Garnet men of the track outdid themselves against a team that beat them last year 84-42 and was favored to beat the Dutchmen again this yeat. Rochester could only take three firsts out of the 14 .events. Whalen took the shot-put and the discus, Culvet· won the mile, Wallington captured the 100 and 220, Belanger's first in the mile and Sharpe's win in the 440 gave Union its 79'\ points. With plenty of support from Richards, Oyer, McQueen, and Mil· I· ford, Union's key men had no, trouble in taking the two track meets to give the Garnet two wins I and one loss for a season total. Union's one loss came in the opener against Trinity on April 26. Although track mentor Bill Ketz hau developed some outstanding individual athlete!1 this season, the squad is weakened to some degree by a lac!( of balance. But the Dutchmen should have very little trouble in compiling an outstand- ing season record. Next week the Garnet will face Its old rivals R.P.I. in another away meet at Troy. The engineer- ing trackmen are undefeated going into this, their third straight sea- son. Opening against Hamilton they romped all over the Con- tin-entals, 109%-16 'h.
