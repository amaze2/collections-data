It was in August,· 1893, while at Hamburg en route for Stoc·kholm I received a note from Prince Bistnarck inviting me to dine with him the following evening at his home at Fried- richsruh. · As I had never had the honor of n1etting Prince Bistnarck, I attributed the invitation to a friendship of so1ne years' standing with two rnembei\s of the Bisn1arck fatnily who knew of tny presence in I-lamburg, which is only forty n1inutes ·from Friedrichsruh. However this may be the invitation came and needless to say was promptly accepted. On the arrival of the train I was tnet by Dr. Chrysander, the Prince's secretary, and driv- en directly to the house, not n1ore than Ioo yards from the station. 1~he building is quite different in style fron1 the one I had pictured to myself as the home of the great chancellor . In fact, it resembled the abode of an Engl,ish country gentletnan and was not spe:ially no .. ticeable except for its great dirnensions and the utter want of decorative features, both ex- ternal and internal. The roorns are lar()\e b ' furnishings plain, and all the appointments extretnely well suited to the simple tastes of its great occupant. On my arrival I was taken to a co1nn1odious room on the second floor where I was request- ed to make myself co1nfortable until further notice. Precisely at 7 o'clock Dr. Chrysan- der appeared and led me to the drawing room where I was presented to the Prince and Prin- cess. Both were very cordial and after in- quiries concerning n1en1bers of the family I had seen n1ore recently than they, we proceed- ed to the dining roorn followed by two itn- mense dogs, Cyrus and Rebecca by name, the dogs, pursuant to habit, ranging themselves on opposite sides of the room where they re• mained ,motionless until the end of the dinner. rrhe dinner was a family affair, purelf in· formal, the only other guest being Dr. Schweininger, the family physician. The seat assigned m,e was between the Prince and the Princess w bich put me in close relation to both and free from any disturbing influence. 1'be Prince was in excellent talking moo~d and as he seetned to anticipate in the n1ain the topi.cs on which I desired to learn his views,. the talk was largely in the form of a monologue inter-- ruptf'd only two or three tin1es by inter~oga• tions. He began by saying his life, while on the whole a most interesting one in n1any points of view, had· been burdened by anxieties due to grea·t responsibilities which had been thrust upon him during the entire period of his pub- lic career. These duties pressed· upoh him to such an extent that no time had been allowed for relaxation, so that at the age of nearly So, when \vith his natively strong con~titu·tion he should be in his pri1ne, his strength and vigor were greatly in1paired, then turning to Dr.· Schw sn1ile and twinkle, he ob· served that he possibiy n1ight have been in better condition today if he had not follow·ed so closely the advice of his medical adviser. Referring to his property interests, he said he owned three estates, one at Varzin in the North, one at Gastein on the Austrian frontier, and Friedrichsruh which he considered his home. This was a gift from Kaiser Wilhelm chiefly in recognition of his services during the Franco-Prussian vVar ; it comprised thirty thousand acres of la:nd mostly wooded a11d ' . frotn its location and general attractivene~s was the most desirabie of the three, and here he expected to live and die ..

Durin·.. those debates ( 'J while supporting the interests of France with . all the vigor 8.t his conunan d, he evinced a . - .. fortitude in defeat only possible to a man of iron n1old and his conduct 'vas s ) in c 11 trast with his French colleagues that Bisn1arck could not refrain fron1 c, ·1nplin1enting hin1 ~Lt their 1 :expense, which they resented in a n1anner to h . 1' 1' t e1r CtlSCrCC.llt. It catne to tny knuwledge while at Fried- richsruh that the proposition of includiug in the idenu1ity clcn1and the session of the Alsace and Lorraine origin~ted with t;.e ~.nDy ~.r:d was made in deference to its wishes alone ; -that Bisrnarck opposed it on the ground that it ..would prove a stan<Jing causus belli and there- fore would. be irnp; Jlitic. ln response to my question as to the ' pi·obable durability of the French R.epubiic, he· remarked that he thought it is destined to 'c·ontinue for some years. The critical mo- Emperor he dismissed with a most incidental allusion. The best guaranty for the peace of Europe, he said, lay in the fact that no single power was in condition for war, that in a certain sense all were on a military footing, a fact of little significance except as a preventive measure. Certainly no natiun for some time to come would take the responsibility of breaking the peace while all were anxious to c·.1nserve it. . Concerning statesrnen CJf the past or present in <.ther countries, he spoke with great reserve. He knew Prince Nletternich, the great Aus- trian dipl· Jffi[tt, having spent a week ,,.vith him at his ch~tca.u in Johannesburg-. He regarded him as a very able and adroit diplon1at, though pe took little stock in diplomacy as such. He was impressed with his wonderful knowledge of govern1nental affairs in Europe and else- where, also the n1anner in which he approached public que£:.tions, his old-fashioned ideas with regard to the balance of power and those underlying questions which affect the stability of nations, a very impr ·rtant figure he was during the entire Napoleonic era. The Prince's attention being called to English statestnen of his time, he spoke only of Disraeli and Sir Stafford Northcote, both of whom \vere delegates to the Berlin Conference over which he presided. Concerning the form.er he thought better of him than Carlyle, who once said that he was not worth his weight in cold bacon. Bismarck · . .i ... · .. 'f : . / ' / ;~ l •• ·; \ .

At the conference referred to, he said he appeared at great disadvantage be- cause of his want of knowledge of the French language, which was the language of the con- ference. Towards the close of the session, knowing all the delegates understood English, in deference to D israeli, Bismarck proposed that the language henceforth should be English and the compliment was greatly appreciated. Reference being made to American a~airs, he spoke of our governm.ent and institutions in terms of admiration, but said he felt that we have not passed the experimental stage even yet. Our chief danger, he thought, is through foreign immigration; in the early period of our history our en1igration laws were exceedingly defective, and even with the im- provements of later years the administration . was so lax that the very dregs of Europe were thronging our shores, most of whom were of the laboring class and at heart were either socialists or anarchists, and no government of the people was of sufficient power to keep them in subjection, fortified as they are by political influence. Bancroft, Bayard Taylor, Andrew D. White . ' Ellhu B. Washburne and Motley were referred to individually as Americans who1n he knew and greatly esteen1ed. The latter, he said, was a schoolmate at the University and the attachment then formed had lasted through life. Motley taught him English (which by the way he spoke very well, though at times with hesitation) and he in turn was in some degree responsible for Motley's speaking knowledge of German. A: the dinner advanced the dogs began to man1fest uneasiness and in language more ex- pressive than words, made their wants known to their n1aster, whereupon the Prince without suspending conversation began tossing biscuits to Cyrus and_,Rebecca, on the right and left, until their demands were satisfied. At the close of the dinner the company I THE CONCORDIEN~SIS. 7 withdrew to the drawing room where coffee was :served. Soon after the Prince took a handful of cigars out of his desk, asked me to make a selection, while he filled his pipe with old Virginia tobacco,. as he phrased it, and commenced to smoke. Conversation was then resumed, though in a lighter vein, mostly with reference to his own early life and family history, after which the Princess took me through various r9oms, the walls of which were adorned with portraits of notable people, also many battle scenes taken fro1n campaigns in which various mem- bers of the Bismarck family had been partici- pants. The time fo!· my departure having arrived, the Prince gave me his photograph, recently taken, with his autographic signature, as a souvenir of the visit. With many thanks for the courtesies extend-. ed me I left Friedrichsruh with a realizing sense that I had met and conversed with the greatest man of affairs which Europe has pro- duced since the days of the first Napoleon. Prince Bismarck was a trifle over six feet in height, stood perfectly erect, was well propor- tioned and looked the man of blood and iron that he was. Ten days afterwards I was invited to spend a week at Varzin with the Bismarck family during the coming autumn. This became im- possible, among other reasons for the fact that Prince Bismarck, \vho was then at Kissen- gen taking the cure, broke down completely and was unable to be moved until winter and then to Friedrichsruh where he remained con- tinuously until his death four years later.

U n.ion has, can and will play fair football and will give fair play to any team which will come half way. In regard to the fact that the R. P. I. team was obliged to use ·cold water for bathin;g after the game, we must say that no one .regrets it more than the Union management. It occurred through no fault of the Union students or the managet of Union's team. ' Our own team was obliged to use cold water on one of it~ trips this season, and while it was an inconvenience, to be sure, it was not considered of sufficient moment to publish. Such an action seems to us unsportUlanlike, to say the least. The Musical Clubs. What has happened to Union's musica talent? The .first term has almost gone and nothing has been heard so far about a concert. It is even understood that regular rehearsals are no longer held. Those in a position to explain this matter are too modest to say why such al thii1g has come to pass and it becomes necessary for those passively interested to inquire into the matter themselves. Surely there is no lack of material for these clubs nor should the financial situation cause the manager to hesitate about giving a concert. This is one of the most important spheres of college activity and Union should not be behind in putting forth good representa· tive Glee and Musical clubs. It has been the complaint for many years that even when concerts are given in .. town, the students never go as a body nor do they A, ,Wfot~d to our Alumni. \V e feel it our duty to say a word in regard to articles appearing in the publications of Hamilton college and the.l~~»~~el.9f!r._f>olytechnic Institute after Union's foot· ' ball games with those institutions. If these articles take any special interest in the affairs .of the clubs. Why ? There is no doubt but that this is true to a certain extent: to the extent that the student body does not pay, and never has paid enough attention to the Musical clubs. That is scarcely a valid reason why nothing has been heard from these organizations thus far this year. It is clearly their duty to represent the college to the best of their ability thus avoiding the possibility of adverse criticism by the students of U 11ion and by other colleges.

A.H.R. M.R. ~GRAHAM'S LECTURE. Mr: George E. Grab atn of the Associated Press gave a very instructive and practical lecture before the friends of the colleo·e and 0 the students in the College Chapel last Friday afternoon. President Raymond introduced the speaker, and took the opportunity of in1- pressing on the minds of the audience the o-reat b service rendered the general public by the As- o ciated Press. THE OONOORDIENSIS. 11 Mr. Graham said in part: ''' 1'here is scarcely a man, who, reading his daily newspaper, realizes where all the news comes from and how it is collected and digest- ed into proper fonn in an almost incredibly short time. The newspaper men form a great corps of co-workers whose interests are the interests of the public. 1,he Associated Press is the greatest news gathering force in the 'vorld and through this agency a vast amount of public service is rendered to the country. America, that is, the United States, fur- nis11ed more and better news than any other country: anyone reading a European news- paper, for example, would have no difficulty in discovering this fact to be true. There are about seven hundred newspapers in this coun-, try which are agents for the Associated Press. This institution is not a corporation but a col- lection of newspapers. 'The t~legraphic systen1 of the Associated Press is perfected in every detail. It controls 32,ooo miles of wire in Atnerica, leased by the year ; the wires are never closed. When a n1an starts out as a Reporter, he n:1ust make up his n1ind to be alert on all oc- casions. rfhere can be no set rules for the Journalistic Profession : a 111an n1ust always try in this business to be ahead of his fellow newspaper tnea in point of ti tne and originali- ty~ One should not get excited : newspaper n1en, especially \var correspondents, are gen- erally given credit for being heroes, but the \. fact is they never have the tin1e or inclination to worry about that ; their minds are fixed on the event and not on then1selves. ~ T'here is no profession which offers n1 ore surely the cup of success or which is more dangerous to a 1nan's morals. A solid foun- dation of character is essen tia1. The rebuffs are many and the experience to be gained is very wide.\ 1\fr. Graham gave several anecdotes of his own experience which were most interesting. I-Iis personal rcfr_·r-::uccs to such well known men as Stephen Crane, Richard Harding .. . . ..... ,_.,, ~ ..

:·I . I ' i I , I ·~ 12 .... ,.THE ··aoNOORDIENSIS,. Davis,. Burr ~fcintosh and Edward N'Iarshall were greatly appreciated .and -en joyed by ~his a:ttdience .. After the lecture, it was the pr~vvilege -of the rnetnbers of the Senior class and of the P.t;-ess Ctub to meet 1\fr. Grahatn at an informal tea given by Mrs. Ray1nond. 'The ·past ·football season has been fraught w:ith. varied successes. Startin.g with a close victory over the Laureate teatn the outlook seetned bright. 'rhe tuateria1 especially for the ·nne ·seemed good and :heavy, although rat~ er inexperienced. Jlowever. as the sea- son advanced ·parental objection and lack of tirne took several likely freshtnen candidates oFf the· squad. The ends have ·been the only position which were held steadily ifor any lea~th of time. t:F be -back field was entirely new. Harvey proved himself one of the steadiest and n1ost consistent players at that position. ·His line plunging ,and .end running were first class. Cantwe 11 and T red ick alternated at righthalf- back: with Cantwell playing the position at the end of the season. Cantwell'.s.line bucking especially in the New York Univ.ersity game was excellent. Ray- tnotld at fullback has done w.·ell for a ·man un- acctl:stomed to that position. He has been the stroqgest ·man in,_the back field on the defense. Th:.:e •back .field as a ·whole, were much stronger on the offense .than on the defense, -for the xno~t part bein.g hard, low runners. Cook played_in_ ~~ymond's place when the latter had a sprained ankle and his hurdli~g and defense we·re ~xcellent. Robinson at quarter back; al- though rather n·ervous at first, seems ·to have the.:makin.g .of.a first class quarter. At ends Olmstead and Co.ok l1ave played most.of the .games. Olmstead aJ:ternating be~ tween right end and right tackle playing at end most of .the time~· Cook has played left end the ·whole season e~cept in the New York Uni,versity,game_when he w.~s ·shi:ft.ed -behind ,the line. Davis .has -showed up :wtell at end ·and has been· a likely candidate· the whole season •. He should :be·. a _better man next year :with :this year's experience .and m.ore ·w.eight.' Roy ·Re·e- der ·played end in two games .but was compell- ed . .to gi,ve up football ,on account of .college work. The ·ends have been consistently good the past season. Patton and Dann were easily the best of the candidates for tackle position. l'hey were by far the best offensive and defensive men on the team, Patton :being the best on offensive run- ning hard and low with lots of speed and hard to be thrown. Dann was slower and not as brilliant in advancing the ball but his strong point lay in defense. These two men with an- other year·'s experience and added weight should m,ake splendid tackles. Lent was the strongest guard and toward the end of the season was ·playing good ball. Kluge and Gil- mour alternated at right guard while Nutt played a special game at centre. At New York especially, he made several brilliant tackles and broke through the line several times.

THE CONCORDIENSIS v OL. XX\' II. UNION COLLEGE, DECEMBER·I6, 1903. No.ll. THE C\'~PTAIN'S CHRIS\TlVIAS. The little steamer Louise, plying between Hilton Head and P .... nnandale, W3.S overdue one Christlnas week. The trip only took ten hours and the route an inland one n1ost of the way, so there \Vas little danger of her being lost ; but still there was sotne anxiety felt in An- nandale. This feeling was not witht~ut its material aspect, for were not the fe\v merchants of that sleepy village dependent on the Louise's freight for theit- Christmas supply of goods ? And was this not the season of seasons to es- tablish their reputations :as flourishing and considerate salestnen ? The captain of the Louise had not made the trip that week, for he had recently been mar- ried and was spending his honey1noon quietly at hotne. 1-\s soon, however, as his steamer was an hour behind her accustomed ti1ne for arrival he bcgar1 to Yt·orry. As the hours passed he blamed hin1self for not going, and finally decided to take his yaul boat and go part of the distance to see if he could find out the cause of her delay. He called his cook who was overhauling an old sail. \Satn ,, he said, ''get on your overalls and we '11 go clow·n as far as the Bay and see if we ·can see anything ~f the Louise.\ \ All right, sah, '' was the cheerful answer. Now San1 was one negto in a thousand. He was the captain's free-born slave and there was nothing in the world that he would not do for '' l\'Ias Ton1. '' They had been boys to- gether, and the devotion of the servant had grown steadily with the years. He was faith- ful ahnost to a fault, for what the captain said or did was always tbe right thing in San1's eyes. The captain was, in his sphere, a personali- ty-hard working, conscientious and ·with a happy vein of quiet hu1nor-these attributes had n1ade his character even and well round- ed. His marriage to one who1n he had known all his life served to n1ake the prospect of his future more and more bright. f-Ie was es- pecially contented that Christmas for the year had been a prosperous one in 111any ways. '' r\re you ready, Sa1n ? \ called the captain, 1 • 1 cnecn1v. _, '' Yes, Loss,\ replied tbat ubiquitous jewel, who, a n1oment before had been in a nan1eless attire, but who now appeared in a broad s1nile, a \ sou'wester'' and other apparel, bearing a leg-o' -n1utton sail and the yaul boat's oars on his shou lcler. \vVe '11 just heat down to the Bay and see if the packing hasn't bl~nvn out on that new boiler : I don't know what else's keepin' her -there's plenty o'tide.\ There \vas a stiff north wind blowing as the two, having fitted everything snug aboard the yaul and ta!-:en a reef, held down the wide, marsh··banked creek leading toward Breech Inlet and the Bay. \Vhen about ten miles f!\om the village, the wind began to rise and the flood tide, swelling up the creeks fron1 the sea, was lifted into long swells with here and there a white-cap. T'here was no sign of the stean1er and the Bay was allnost reached. Now this Bay although lying well inland and girded altno~t all around by sand reefs, quiet creeks and low islands, was nevertheles~, at times, n1ost dangerous to cross. It opened on the ocean through Breech Inlet, a narrow strait, scarcely a quarter tnile wide, while the Bay itself was eight 111iles across. At all times of tide except the slack water this Inlet was a millrace and beyond the Inlet were the breakers.

6 THE Q:ONCORDIEN.SIS. The breakers ! Those who have ever seen those tireless white horses charging upon the reef with foan-flecked manes and snorting heads may never forget the half beautiful, the half terrible sight. Long level swells con1e drawing from the waste of sea and gradually increase in size and swiftness, then lift and lift, then thunder in a burst of green and white. The following waves, gathering , strength from the broken volume of their re- treating brothers, rise and rise until it seems as if they will ne-ver fall. Yet soon they crash and others, untold in nutnber come roll- ing .on to speud their strength and die ·wit11 a roaring shout of ''Victory '' on the· hidden reef. But to return to the captain and Sam. Having come to the Bay they found it full of choppy seas and the ·wind rising ; the Louise was still- not in sight. They ran the yaul into the marsh and considered what to do next. Should they cross the Bay ? Eight miles in the trough of a heavy sea with no centre board was a risky business. But the captain was de- termined. ' 4 Something In ust 'a' happened, Sam,\ he exclaimed, \or she ·would 'a' been 'ere by now. We '11 go 'cross anyway.\ Sam was too vvise to demur yet he was afraid : still, -wbat \ Mas Ton1 '' said was his law as well as his religion so he shoved the boat out and they entered the Bay. Before getting half across the tide turned and the wind, instead of lulling, as it should, by all the laws of earth and sky, rose st·eadily. The little boat -vvas plunging badly and while the captain tended sleet rope and tiller, San1 was kept constantly bailing. \Mas 'I' om,\ said the latter in a sober voice ''you tink we '11 git 'cross ?'' ''Sure we '\vill, . Sam,\ replied the captain, hiding his own fears, for he saw the negro was getting decidedly uneasy.\ \We '11 run in Romain Cove befo' you know it.'' Romain Co-ve meant safety, for it was on the further side of the Bay, wel1-she~.tered and quiet at all times. Yet they would never reach it, for just after the captain ceased speaking a huge swell struck the yaul broad- side and before she righted a breaking wave caught her under the leeward gun wale ·and over she went, ''turning turtle.'' The two 1nen rose together and struc'k out for the upturned boat, reaching it in safety ; the captain grasping the bow and Sam the stern. \l-Iang on, Sam,'' sh®uted fhe captain above the noise of the wind and the wallowing of the boat ; \This ebb 'ill take us on Shark Bank.'' Sam hung on bravely yet was pallid under the ,coal black of his skin ; he was frightened until he was weak and began to sing :.:111 old negro camp meeting song. Every time he opened his mouth the waves, breaking on the boat, would pour into it and choke him. ''Keep your mouth shut,'' yei1ed the cap- tain ; ''can't you see you '11 drown if you keep on doin' that ?'' It was no use ; Sam continued to sing, so the captain beginning to think that the negro wa$ losing his head, slipped around the boat and told the negro plainly that \ if he didn't stop that hollerin' he'd drown sure.\ The captain turned to go to the bow, but quickly swam back to where Sam lay, half across the rudder, inert and suspiciously quiet; he was unconscious, and his heart was very feeble. '' 'E's clean scared to death, I b'lieve,'' said the swimmer as he lifted hin1self with one arm partially out of the water. \ 1 reckon I '11 take him round to the bow with n1e ; it's bet~ ter there. So the captain swam back to the bow, bear- ing the negro half on his shoulders above the waves. But when he reached the prow and felt Sam's heart again he found he was dead. The ebb tide was racing out of the Inlet and on its sweep bore an overturned boat with lifeless man,held in a spent 111an's arms. rrhe captain, with .one arm hooked over the keel of ). I , ..

1 - f . <: ·.< . ' 1 ~ ~ '' GLOBE H0'[1EL, ALBANY.-Adv. the boat and half in the water was holding Sam with the other. The idea had long oc- cured to him that he should let the negro go,. yet the old affection for the faithful boy whom he had trained to be a faithful man bade him to save the body at least. Save the body ? \rVas it not folly to think of such a thing -when even now the boat ·was • riding into the ranks of the breakers ? \Vas it nnt useless to try to save the body? Yet he was not given opportunity to argue the matter out with himself : he began to feel faint ; both arms were numb and besides, had he not seen, a few moments before, a tall and sn1ooth dorsal fin near him, cutting the water like a knife ? l-Ie :loosed his hold on the negro and down he went like a shot. The captain took a long breath and then climbed on the bottom of the boat. He was almost thro' the line of breakers now, and looldng towards the Bay, he could n1ake out the Lo1tise, laboring heavily through the S\vells, slowly but safely and surely . ''They '11 never know'' he 1nused ''what be- came of n1e an' Sam.'' The 'wind drove the yaul steadily-out to sea and the evening- close.d with the captain cling- ing to his perilous position and yet hopefuL When the sun vvent down in an angry bank of clouds and the dark began to creep over the sea, he thought of his hon1e and of the wotnan who could only wait. \Vhen the night had wholly come and the clouds in the west lost their color he saw, in a rift in their boson1 a single twinkling star. It lent comfort and companionship to him. He seemed to pass back to his boyhood and old songs came thronging thro' his head. '' Sam sang before he died\ he said, half aloud, \I wonder if I could. There's one hy1J1.n I used to know a long time ago, yet it don't seem long now. I guess God'll hear me~ if nobody else will.'' So the captain sang while the Christmas eve wore on and the single star sank to rest be- hind the ri'rn of the earth. Over the lonely THE CONCORDIENSIS. 7 waters the clear voice sounded, brave and calm full of faith and hopefulness : \ Le:itd kindly light amid th' encircling gloom, Lead thou me on : The night is dark and I am far from home, Lead thou me on. Oe'r moor and fen o'er crag and torrent 'till The night is gone ; And with the mont those angel faces smile \Vhich I have kn0wn long since And lost awhile.'' 'Vhen the Christ1nas dawn came it found the captain had finished the song and was sleeping. Both he and San1 had crossed the Bay. ALUMNI BANQUET. The Annual Reunion and Banquet of the Union College Alun1ni A .. ssociation of New York was held 1'hursday evening, December 1oth, at the I-Iotel Manhattan, Madison Ave- nue and Forty-second street. The co liege was well represented by many prominent men and the toasts, all of which were of a more or less optitnistic character, were enthuiastically re- ceived. Theodore De Long Coffin, r 9-:\2 rep- resented the '' Concordiensis. '' A speaker who was not included in the print- · ed program of toasts was Gen. James Gra·ns Wilson, and when he was called upon to speak he n1ade a few personal remarks and then con- tinued: \As no regular toast was given to me, I wish to talk of one of who1n Americans always like to hear. I will turn the hands of time back to 1777, and ask you to go with. me to the battlefield of Saratoga, which the poet Halleck called the field of grounded arms. There a great victory was won, which was not dne to the efforts of the American commander, but to Benedict Arnold. '' The story of that victory was reported to General Wa:sq~·~gton. A short tizn~ ~ft~rward

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS. he ~e,t General Arnold, and, after compliment- ing him on his great victory, said: \ 'I have heard, General, that you 1ost your sleeve links. in the battle, and I ask you to ac- cept from me these, although I have worn them for son1e time.' \General Arnold took them and wore them. 13ut later, when he became a traitor, and Washington, in his dig-nified manner had ex- pressed his con tetnpt in strong and burning words, Arnold no longer cared to wear the sleeve links, and gave them to Colonel Tarle- ton, the only British officer who had treated him with any kind of courtesy. \ Tarleton, when he departed for England, gave them to a loyalist who had acted as his secretary, and he gave them to Gen. Fitz Greene Halleck, who, in turn, left them to the man who later was his biographer. And here, gentlemen,\ said General Wilson, drawing up his sleeves a little and raising his arn1s, \ are Washington's sleeve links. '' The dinner was attended by about a hun- dred alumni of the college. Ron. Frederick W. Seward, who was As sis tan t Secretary of State during President Lincoln's administra- tion, was toastn1aster, and in his address said that Union is now on the high road to her for- mer prosperity. \The best days of Union are by no means over,\ he said. \Greater and bet- ter ones are opening before it and frotn all ap- pearances are near at hand. H President Raymond in his address dwelt first upon the importance of the Faculty in the life of this college and outlined the policy pursued in the effort to secure not only n1en of ability but men of strong pers.onal influence and above all men of unselfish devotion to the college. He paid a tribute to the harmony of feeling and action found in the present Faculty of Union .college, and sa in it bright promise for the future. He then referred to some of the evi~ dences of material progress, the reconstruction of the dormitories, the enlargement and im- provement of certain laboratory and class room facilities.and especially the compl~tion of both Metnorial Hall and its adaptation to library purposes. He considered it a happy coinci- dence that after so many years of wait in cs, this was realized at just the titne that the college was preparing to celebrate the one hundredth anniversary of Dr. Nott's acceptance of the presidency. Speaking of the proposed celebra- tion he said \It will give another opportunity for ca111ng up our honored past and will revive the memory of a natne that should never be lost from the story of higher education in America. vVhatever the life of to-day our roots run far back through the years and every such tnetnorial celebration tends directly to increase the present vigor and strengthen the hold of the college upon the thought and inter- est of the community.'' He then referred to some current educational discussions especially the question of shorten- ing tht college course. Bishop Potter told several stories about his grandfather, President N ott of Union. \ I be- lieve that Dr. N ott was great,'' he said, ''as much because he invented the N ott stove as because he was president of Union.'' The other toasts were: ''The Problem and the Opportunity,\ John DevVitt \tVarner. D. \Our Associations,\ \Vm. H. McEirov. \Sons of Union,\ l~ev. Geo. Alexander, D. '· Electrical Progress,'' Professor C. P. Stein- nletz. \Financial Progress,'' 'Treasurer Frank Bai- ley. \T'he University,\ Professor John I. Ben- nett.

Circum· stance. Circumstance is a word which has be- come decidedly degenerate, It is so frequently used nowadays to expres~ an e.xcuse for what is inexcusable that the Seer who once sang of ''The hollow orb of moving Circumstance, roll'd round by one fixed law\. wouid stand aghast at its pro- lipic expressiveness. How many ·men today when they see no other loop hole .of escape think to c:l(;!a:r .themselves from guilt of either omission ·or co1nmission by saying ,,, Under the circumstances I could not help acting as I did.'' In many cases this excuse is found to· be valid :but the troub~e is, excuses are gro\ving more frequ<:nt and universa;l every day. '' Circumstance'!'' said Napoleon; \I will make circumstance !\ How much more nanly this than to knuckle under to every seem,ing misfortune and say '' Well, I am not to blame, circumstances were against me.'' It is now drawing near one time of the year when ex- cuses form the main topic of conversation among the students. '' If '' is the word most generally used to express their reasons. Now, this is a two-sided, safe and comforting word to use but it resu1ts in nothing and the more it is used by a man the weaker that man is. You hear one say : '' If that question had'n:t been given on exam. I would have come out all tight;'' or '' I could'nt help failing this term; in the first place the Prof. did'nt like me and then everything was against rny passing that subject \ Well, it may be candidly asked, ~v hose fault is that ? \Vhenever a man fails id college 1vork, except in rare cases, there is no one to blame but the rnnn himself and it is weakness on his part to attempt to put forward auy excuse. If you do not get through on any subject mak;:) up your mind then and there that you have not done yourself jl!stice and determine to prove this to others. If you do not no one else will.

I Thro' the evening air there crept A tired little breeze, And, anon, it paused and wept Under the willow trees, Then drowsed and lulled and softly slept, \Varm-wrapped in memories. II And it never cared to wake For dreams were calm and sweet. So it slept beside the lake \Vhere sunlit shadows fleet And the alder branches shake Blooms about its feet.

The University of New Zealand is at~ ex- an1ining body, having general control over the four affiliated colleges. 1'here \Vere about 1, coo unclergradua tes in the University of New Zealand in 190 I, when the census showed that the n un1 ber of persons in the country between the ages of sixteen and twenty~one was 102 ,ooo. 'The university examinations are conducted by ex.aminers resident in England and Scotland. It takes three months for a student to learn the official result of the ex- amination. Trinity College Sophotnores have at last felt the influence of the faculty and alun1ni, for at a recent class n1eeting it was decided to do a\vay with hazing because of the injurious ef- fect of Bloody ~fonday Night to the present and prospective students. That the University of Munich has opened its doors to \vomen is the report tnade by James H. VI orn1an, United States Consnl General in Munich, to the State Department. \Hitherto no won1en were pennitted to rna· triculate in the Gern1an universities,\ he says, adding: \In several of them wotnen have been permitted to attend lectures and take de- grees on exa1ninatiot1 by and with the consent of the faculties concerned. ''For the present the University of l\1unich lin1its its adtnission of wo1nen by regular n1a~ triculation to such as possess the abi tu ria of the Gern1an Gymnasium, and they are admit· ted to this noted German High School only on the same conditions as its male students. VVotnen students of foriegn birth graduates of colleges, but who do not possess the German gymnasial abi turia, are admitted only as hearers, and with the consent of the faculty they may pursue a course of study and come up for a degree_, but they have not obtained the rights accorded to German women having the gymnasial abitu.ria. '' The Students' Association of Vassar Col- lege has passed a self-sacrificin.g resolution. As friends of the college know,. Mr. Rocke- feHer .offered in June, 19.02, to double any an1ount, not exceeding $2oo, ooo, raised by the coHege by June 1904. The alumnae are working hard to raise the money, and in order to do their part the students of the .eollege de- cided to give up the annual Philalethean Day dance, which is helc.l the day after Thanks- giving and is one of the two annual dances to which outside guests are invited, and also one of the four hall plays which are gi \·en dur- ing the year giving the money for then1 to the fund. The tnoney for these two things con1es from the Philalethean Society, which is sup- ported by the students alone. This creditable act ion on the part of the students will encour- age those who are working outside :for the \ fund. In the biography of Dr. Noah Porter, George S. Ivlerriam, himself a Yale College n1an, conl- tnenting upon the pron1inence of athletics in that institution, has this to say upon \one side of the story :\ A Yale senior was lately asked, ''who is ex officio the greatest man in college?'' \ The captain of the football tean1,\ was the prornpt reply. \Of course; and \vho has second honors?\ ~'Second, bnt at a good remove, come the captains of the crew and of the baseball t2>am.

The seventeenth annual convention of the Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools of the M id:dle States and l\1ary1and \\ 7 aS held with a two days' session at Coluln- bia U ni versi ty. Nearly r, ooo college profes- sors and principals of high schools and second- ary schools reg,istered. A heated discussion took piace about the length of the college course. Prof. J. H. Penniman, Dean of the academic department, ·university of Pennsylvania, began the addres- ses, vigorously opposing the idea. He said a faur year course was necessary for the proper intellectual development of the student. He did not object to a three years course for some students, as carried on now in several colleges. Prof. Andrew F. West, Dean of the graduate school of Princeton, said the four year course had been proved tl1e best and was almost uni- versal. It suited the means of the country and was not too long for training a boy into a rr1an. President Schunnan of Cornell U niversi tv J ·said the proper age for a boy to enter college was between sixteen and seventeen years of age, and four years should be taken up in con1- pleting his studies. He n1ight study silnple things at first, but a certain amount of trained intelligence was necessary for the n1ore abstract studies, and tin1e was required for him to mas- ter those pursuits. President Schunnan pro- tested against lowering the standard of de- grees. He also said that one result of a four yea~ course was to develop the manhood of the student.
