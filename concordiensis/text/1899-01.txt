Dr. Van der Water of New York city, delivered an entertaining ~ecture in ·the First Reformed church of this city on the even- · ing ofJ anuary 10. The speaker was chaplain : of the Seventy-first New York Volunteers, the . reghnent which so well represented this state at the front in the late wat, and accordingly his selection of the topic \ Personal Experiences in the Spanish War,\ rendered the lecture doubly Interesting. A large representation 'of ·Com- panies E and F, Secend New York Volunteers, were in attendance as well as a good sized dele- gation from the college. Pres~ dent Raymond presented Dr. Van der Water. The speaker is possessed of an unusuaUy agreeable voice. Taking up his discussion in narrative form, he treated at first in a rough man- ner the general causes of the war and the diffi- culties in the mobilization of the troops. The 71st New York, the chaplain said, was the first regitnent to say they would go, the first one to be mustered in and the first to be sent to the front. In company with a large force of regulars, the Second Massachusetts and the Rough Riders it composed the Fifth Army Corps, which was the army pf invasion. At Tampa great difficulties in getting on the ships were encountered and then many delays were necessary after being once on board. At length on June 15, after everything was ready and the last phantom Spanish fleet had gone up in mist the fleet of 59 vessels set sail arriving five days later off the Cuban coast. Orders for diseru- barking were soon given together with the order that each man should be provided with three days' rations, two hundred rounds of ammuni- tion and should be equipped in heavy marching order. When once disetnbarked, by no means an easy accomplishment, the men were all so ired that they lay down in the hot sand to sleep. The first evening, Dr. Vander Water said, be determined upon an evening service. He had not however taken into consideration the short duration of the southern twilight and in .consequence found himself at seven o'clock,_ the appointed time, in the dark without m·eans of reading the service. ,., It is astonishing what one can do under some circumstances \ said be, '' for I found that I could remember the service full wen enough for the circumstances. I never knew just when that meeting broke up for after the last regular hymn the men kept singing songs and hymns until n1uch after eleven o'clock.\ On Monday morning at half-past three o'clock the first general advance began. In a short time they saw the first signs of the Rough Rider's fight of the day before. Sick and wounded men were st~ggering a'long, a few small graves with a little cross over them were noticed here and there, and then there was the terrible flock of vultures which never left tl1e neighborhood. After proceeding along the road four miles, the danger commenced to become more imminent. On either side of the road was dense und~r· brush, while intertwined in it was an indescrib- able mass of barb wire. It soon became evident that the only method of approach was up a small gulch wide enough to admit but four men. That ~he men did it, under a heavy fire and without faltering need not be said. Shel'ls, volley firing and the sharp crack of the sharp- shooter's rifle produced frightful results. On they went to the turning place in front of San Juan hill. Dr. Van der Water related the terrible scenes at the battle's close. ''At the hospital there was a scene beggering description. The men were lying in pools of blood awaiting their turn at the operating table.'' The chaplain per- formed many a weary soldier's funeral, and did much to alleviate suffering on all sides. He rt .j ~I 'i I.! .I ,,. }- ,1 ~' i' \ I ;\

An amusing incident of the :Latter ' was the great enthusiasm shown upon the band's striking up, '''There'll be a Hot Time in the Old Town 'Tonight.\ The chaplain said that at thiis time the heat was so great that for a number o:f days he wore nothing but pajatnas;. He was rather .arnused later to see a cut of himself in that attire in an enterprising New York paper. Dr. Van der Water, in closing, gave in a nut shell his opinion of the war and its results. \ Every man went to do his duty.. ·Great things were accomplished. It was a quick, holy war waged for a righteous cause. Let us now make a proper and wise use of its beneficent results.\ During the week between Xm:as and New Years the American Naturalist Society held its annual meeting at Columbia Univ~rsity in New York. This society is composed of nearly all the important Scientific organizations in the country, and an1ong its divisions are the Ameri- can Chemical, Anatomist, Physi<>locical, Physic- ological, Plant, Morphological and Geological societies. President Seth Low of Columbia, welcomed the scientists in an address in which he argued for a broad feeling an1ong all men who are searching out knowledge along these lines. The following officers were elected for the ensuing year : President, Farlow of Harvard ; Vice-President, Bumpus of Brown ; Secretary, Morgan of Bryn Mawr ; Treasurer, Smith of Maine. Representatives from nearly all the colleges were present at every branch of the convention, but Union \vas only represented in two divisions, nan1ely, the New York State Science Teachers' Association, at which Prof. Stoller was present, and at the meeting of the Atnerican Geological society, by Prof. Prosser, who was made a fellow of the society. r;!l]e UJegteriJ ,(?rip of tt}e Jn.usi~al f\550GiatiOQ. About twenty-five students spent the first part of the holiday vacation taking the usual western trip of the college musical association. They 1eft Schenectady Tuesday morning, Dec. 20, ardvi11.g at noon at Syracuse, where they remained several hours for dinner. The first concert of the trip was given in the Sherman opera house at Newark, Tuesday evening. The alumni of Newark were well represented. Ex- State Senator Stephen 1(. Williams, LL. D., ~37, who was for many years a trustee of the college, and Hon. G. A. Holcon1be, fol~tner United States Minister to China, occupied the boxes. Among the other Union men who were present were: George E~ward Willian1s, '97 ; ·Christie Hartnagel, '98 ; Homer A. Crothers, '98; Wilfred T. Purchase, '99 and A. J. Hornsby, '99· After the concert the musicians and their friends adjourned to Sherman Hall, where a pleasing dance was enjoyed. A good sized audience greeted the college musicians at Music Hall, Rochester, Wednesday evening. Among the alumni and students to whom the musical association is indebted for their efforts in behalf of the concert are : Alphonso Dix Bissell, '95 ; Williatn Allen, '95 ; Raymond D. Fuller, '97; James G. Greene, '84; Howard Mosher, 'go; C. Schuyler Davis, '88; Frank Little, '97 ; Robert Lee Skinner, '98; Beektnan C. Little, '91 ; R. F. Warner, 1901; J. E. Parker, rgox and A. J. Hornsby, '99· Thursday afternoon the members of the clubs were the guests of Cap and Bells, the dramatic club of Williams college, which rendered Gold- sn1ith's \ She Stoops to Conquer,\ in a delight- ful manner, in the Burtis opera house at Auburn. In the evening the last concert of the trip was given in the beautiful new Music Hall at Auburn. A large and fashionable audience attended. After the concert the Union n1en enjoyed a delightful dance to which the mem- bers of the Williams club were also invited. For the dance the Union men are indebted to their girl friends at Auburn, prominent among whom must be mentioned Miss Frances Seward, grand-daughter of Wm. H. Seward, '55, one of Union's most distinguished graduates. . ' ~ ' ' ,i i • .l

I-EWIS WILLIAM MANSFIELD, '35. Announcetnent has been received of the death of Lewis William Mansfield, '35., at his resi- dence at Northside, Cohoes, from o:ld age. He had been in feeble health for a long time. Mr. Mansfield was born in Kent, . Litchfield county, Conn., May r6, r8r6, and about sixteen years later removed to N ot·thside. I-Ie entered Union Co1lege in I 833 as a junior and graduated in 1835 with the honor of Phi Beta Kappa and was the last but one of his class l·iving. He was a men1ber of the Delta Phi fraternity. Later he associated himself with the Hon. Hugh White, a brother-in-law, in the manufacture of hydraulic cement at Whitesport on the Hudson, which was the first cement works in New York state. In 1847 he sold his interest and with his wife went to Europe for 'his health. He was in Paris during the revolution of r848 and was forced to depart from that country. Upon his return he entered upon a literary career· and from 1850 to 1855 wrote a nutn ber of works, which include: \The Morning Watch,\ \Up- Country Letters,\ and \·Country Margins.\ He was a friend of Nathaniel Hawthorne, who spoke very highly of his 4 ' ;Up-Country Letters.\ In later years he dev~oted himself to religious subjects. In 1855 he started the first knitting mill in Cohoes in the rear of the Miller House, and afterwards the Empire tnill. [n 1865 he retired from business on .account of ill health. He was a member of St.John's church, Cohoes, and was the seeond oldest communicant, and for many years was a vestryman and warden and on stated occasions conducted the services. He is survived by a widow and one son, William K. Mansfield, who was for ·many years editor of the Cohoes Daily News. REV. SAMUEL GOODALE, D. D., '36. The Rev. Dr. Samuel Goodale, one of the founders of the Ps1 Upsilon fraternity at Union college in 1833, died at his home in Columbus, Neb., on December 8. He was graduated from Union in the class of 1836 with the honor of Phi _Beta Kappa. Dr. Goodale was eighty-four years old, and was greatly beloved by the mem- bers of his fraternity throughout the country. He always took an active interest in its concerns and was ~a frequent attendant at its conventions. Prof. Ge0rge V. Edwards, formerly in~tructor in Latin ~t Union, was on the hill f<>r .a few days at ·the opening of the term. After :leaving Union in. fbe sun1mer of ''97, Mr. Edwards went to Europ~· wh.ere he spe11t most of his 1ime in the University of M unicb. The last few nonths of '98 w.~re occupied in travel in s<>uthern Europe,. ~nd in December Mr. Edwards took steamer .f0r this country. It is his intention to spend tli<J remainder of the present C<>lTegiate year at f Ghns Hopkins University. While abroad M\r.

Within the last few years basket ball has become quite popu- lar in various colleges, and a Basket Ball Team at Union would not be out of place. Such an organi- zation would be the means of preserving college interest at a period when it is very apt to grow dull. There are teams in the city and near by towns with whom games could be arranged., and also class teams could be formed and a series of games played. This branch of athletics would prove of value as the exercise would develop men for outdoor work next spring. Two important meets will be held at that time, and it is necessary that every athlete in college should get himself into good condition. Basket ball is a very good sub- stitute for other sports that cannot be enjoyed dur- ing the winter months. It requires the action of the whole body, it develops physical courage and quickness, and it is a game that arouses enthu- siasm. Let us have a basket ball team. THE CoN,CORDIENSIS formally announces the appointment of W. C. Can1pbell, 1900'; H. P. Dun- ham, 1900;; and L. T. Hubbard, 1900, on the staff of associate editors. If there are any more fresh- men who desire an appointment on next year's editorial board, they should hand in their names immediately, either in person or. by letter. IT IS UNDERSToon that there is on foot a movement to present at sometime during the term a minstrel performance. The idea is a !good one and The . , Concordiensis desires to s~e the project carried out. ,[ As yet lt has been only a matter of discussion :; among the promoters,. but now that the work of the term is fairly under way, let there be a meeting of all those interested so that preparations may be at once begun. The Concordiensis suggests that Mr. Vander Veer, the manager of the Musical associa- tion, take charge of the business part of the under- taking; and surely no better one could be chosen for a general director, than Instructor Pollard. Dramatics go to make up an important factor in the undergraduate life of many colleges, but for i many years past they have been neglected at Union. It is time that this state of affairs was remedied, so let everyone who has any talent in this direction attend the meeting which will be held next week. A NUMBER of colleges have been tendering com- plimentary dinners to the members .of the \scrub'' football teams, as a mark of .appreciation for the faithful services rendered during the football season. This seems to us a good idea. The scrub players undergo a great many hardships, and as very little honor or importance is attached to a position on the \scrub there is no inducement for men who have little hope of making the 'varsity to come out. These men have sacrificed their time and have endured a good many hard knocks out of loyalty for the college, and this seems to be a fit- ting manner for the student body to show their gratitude. Union had a remarkably .strong ''scrub'' last fall, and the 'varsity received some valuable train- 'i ., rJ ' ,, 1 :'i l't,

in for at in be the rub a sity of fit- last ain- . i ., rJ ' ., 1 :'i l't, THE C·ONCORDIENSIS. 9 ing from lining up against them. Surely our '·' scrub'' deserves something for their services, just as much as the \scrub\ teams of other col- leges. Just now no more :fi. tting manner presents itself, than the course that has been followed by others. Tne team would greatly appreciate a movement of this kind and as the saying is, there is no better way of appealing to a man than through his stomach. Aft.er chapel last Wednesday morning Presi- dent Ravmond took occasion to congratulate the ., students on the exceptionally fine record in scholarship for the first term. He said it reflected credit upon the faculty as well, and declared the work of the tertn to :be the best since he has been connected with the college. Dr. Ray~tnond made a detailed statement con- fnarri~d. On the evening of December 5, a very pleas- ant wedding took place at Haverhill, when Miss Kate Marion Blunt and Prof. John W .. H. Pollard were united in marriage. The .church was beautifuUy decorated with laurel, evergreen and palms, relieved by large knots of white pinks a.nd nar.cissus, and wreaths of holly .marked the pews reserved for the immediate friends of the families. The wedding tnusic was in accord with the rest of the cere- mony and was very impressive. The maid of honor was Miss Florence Blunt, the only sister of the bride, and the four bridesmaids were Miss Carolyn Wilson, Miss Grayce Welles of Taun- ton, Miss Lydia Sanderson of Cleveland, Ohio, and Miss Margaret Eastman of Albany. The best man was Mr. Harry C. Pollard, a cousin of the groo.m, and the six ushers, Mr. A. C. Griffin, Mr. Fred D. Chase, Dr. Wm. McFee, Mr. Th~odore LeBosquet, Prof. John I. Bennett and Mr. John C. Adams. , cerning the work of the fall term, showing that only 2~ per cent. of the work of the senior class, 3 1-5 per cent. of the work of th.'e junior class, 2 per cent of the work of the sophomore class, and 2 I -5 per cent. of the work of the freshman class, had fallen below the sustaining mark. Of the work of the coHege as a whole 97 ;{ per cent. had been above the required grade. Immediately after the cere1nony a small recep- tion, to which only the relatives and immediate friends of the newly married couple were invited, was held at the residence of the bride's parents. In welcoming Prof. Pollard and his bride to Schenectady we are sure that we are stating the sentiments of every Union man in wishing them a very happy New Year and good fortune for the future. The engagement has been announced of Miss Emeline Westinghouse, daughter of Mrs. Jay Westinghouse of this city, to Clarke Winslow Crannell, '95, of New York. Of spec·ial significance also was the presi- dent's announcement of the scholarship records of the football men. Only one of the sixteen men constituting the tean1 had been conditioned, and he only in one subject. One player had received an average of third grade, and the average of all the others l1ad been in either the first or second grade. Of the s1x freshmen who made the football eleven, three had averages of first g~ade and the other three of second grade. paid Offieials for Ceaque (!ames. The Hamilton Review con1menting on the past foot ball season of the college closes the article with the following extract: \One other point which has caused dissatis- faction is the point of officials for league gan1es. We think that the officials of the Colgate-Ham- ilton game were the best we have had this season. We also think that son1e of the decis- ions in the Union-Hamilton game were anything but just. Now, why can not the league have paid officials for these league games ? Have men chosen who are disinterested and let the same officials act at all league games. We believe that this would be a change for the better and hope to see it discussed in other college papers.\ ~ . ! ~ l l 1

Ogden of New York, delivered the second of the three lectures which have been arranged by Miss Frances C. Paige :for the benefit of the students fund. The lecture was given in the · chapel of the First Presbyterian church ; the subject was \I which, as the speaker said, is at first thought a very small subj:ect but in reality is one for deep and profitable thought. The college quartette added to the enjoyment of the evening by singing some college songs in the early part of the evening. After a graceful apology for his appearance on the lecture platform between the lectures of such noted tnen as Rev. Dr. Van der Water and Bishop Potter, Mr. Ogden entered upon his subject. He said, in opening his address, that, con- trary to what might be expected from the subject announced, he had no intention of speaking about himself. He defined his subject as, I, the personal pronoun, first person singular, meaning \ one's self. One of the most familiar developments from ego, the Latin equivalent for I is egotist-'' One who speaks, writes and thinks much about himself.\ \ Self-import- ance,\ said Mr. Ogden, \is an inherent ele- ment in our natures, and under the influence of compliment and flattery it has unlimited capacity for abnonnal growth.\ Hence it is not strange that many, unable to withstand its power, becotne the egotists with whom we are all familiar. r.rhey are the little men and women who \await you with their sn1all omnipotence on everv social occasion, annoying you by their ~ ~ self-complacency, or provoking you by their self-conceit; people who are so impressed with their own importance that they think themselves as interesting to other people as they are to themselves. He gave some striking illustrations of the little man, the egotist in the various callings of likfe. Mr. Ogden said that in speaking of the egotist his aim was to \show that the bores of society are self-oenttered '' and to furnish .a perspective for the furtller treatment of his subject. He then passed ~to the consideration of his subject from a diffe1:-ent and .more serious point of view. He took llis definition of the topical word from a seraon by Canon Kingsley, the great English pre~cher. This gives a hint of the gen- eral sublimihy of human life and suggests the itnportance <>f ''understanding the divine esti- mate of man.\ What higher testimony could there be to the dignity of humanity than is found in the Bible, especially in the sayings of Christ, the Son of Man. Looking at i.t from this stand- point we se.e that man occupies a position at once unique and superior and he should regard himself '' vvith awe and fear lest by acts of his own he degr.ade and belittle the nature that has almost divi1ae possibilities and for whom God himself haa.~done so much.\ The speaker then considered the development of man and bis great achievements. But while he is maki;qg such progress in the physical world, man's sense of his duty to mankind is becoming more keen. '' Splendid witness to this is found in beneficent organizations, hos- pitals, asyhnns, almshouses, schools, colleges, universities. But tnore emphatic still is the loving devotion that is paid to the work and memory of :such noble men and women as have devoted life, service or fortune or both, to the welfare of ht~,manity .\ Mr. Ogden gave a glow- ing tribute to the g:andeur and di~!1ity of the individual, T, \ a chtld of God, a ctttzen of the universe, the= heir of all the ages.'' He then dwelt upon the danger to individu- ality that lies in the present tendency to form great organiz;ations whose machinery is humanity and in whid-:1 the individual is lost sight of. The lectu:re closed with a quotation from a prayer at the conclusion of Kingsley's sermon on the same topic.

The freshmen had ev:erything their own way at the Edison Hotel Friday evening, January ·13., .at which tim.e they held their banquet. The sopho1nores caught a few frosh who were roam- ·ing about the hotel corridor during the after- noon, and locked them up in a room at another hotel. But just before the freshmen went into ;the banquet hall, a number of the big freshrn:en, whom ·the sophs did not dare tackle, secured a , ' sophomore and dragged him into the dining ·room. The sophom.ores who crowded about the dining room doors, spoiled a bowl of punch as it was being brought in, but another bowl was prepared, in titn.e tO' quench the freshmens' .thirst. When the banquet had been in progress about half an hour and everyone was thinking of what was coming next on the tnenu, the :sophomore made a bold dash for the door, pass- ing within a foot of the two strongest and largest men in the class, who were taken too ·much by surprise to intercept him. This created quite a bubble and it was some time before ~tranquility was restored. About forty n1embers of the class were present, besides a number of invited guests and .the managers of the various college organiza- tions, among whom were the following: Instructor J. W. H. Pollard, Instructo1 4 Opdyke, Leroy T. Bradford, James N. Vander v;eer, ·Geo. C. Rowell, William J. Stnith, Edward W. Strong, Harold J. Hinman, Wagner Van- Vlack, Robert C. Gambee, George C. Foote, Leroy ·0. Ripley, W. Dewey Loucks, Morton M. Price, Steph~n ·C. Medberry, John L. Sher- wood, Chas. I-I. McCulloch. After the inner tnan had been satisfied, the toastmaster, Chas. S. Yawger of Seneca Falls, announced the following toasts: A. H. Hinman, Albany ... \President's Address.\ D. E. Griffith, Watertown ................ \1901. \ F. M. Thebo, Fort Edward .... \Our Cane Rush.\ J. Q. Gulnac, Binghamton ........... \Athletics.'' J. H. Small, Albany ............. \ The Faculty.\ D. C. Hawkes, Elmira .. \Other Fellows'Sisters.\ D. M. Dunning, Auburn ........... \ Old Union.\ The upper classmen were then called upon for impromptu toasts, and after numerous speeches had been tnade, frequently interspersed with song, the banquet broke up at an early hour. That Uni0n is to have a basket baH teatn is an established fact. F·ifteen basket ball enthusi- asts met in the \Gym.\ last Tuestlay night, and took definite steps towards its organization .. From among the candidates, F. M. Thebo, 1902, was el:ected captain of the 'Varsity, and Hinman, 1902, was selected to captai·,n the sec- ond team. It was decided that only the captain of the first tea,m should be a permanent factor on the 'Va.rs:i:ty ; the other positions being open to ·Constant competition, and changes to be made as often as the captain and coaches should deem the~m advisable. In order to h.ave a working basis, ·each captain was permitted to select four n1en, these eight, with the· captains, to constitute the two teams for the first night's practice. Practice began Friday night, and will con- tinue every Monday, Tuesday and Friday night the remainder of the season. Physical Director Pollard will act as manager. Negotiations are on with Williams, Colgate, R. P. I., LaSalle Institute, Sadilee Hose Basket Ba.U teatn of Fort Edward, and the following Y. M. C. A. teams : Herkimet·, Little Falls, A,msterdatn, Saratoga, Glens Falls, Watervliet and Albany. The schedule of games will soon be decided upon. The first game will probably · be played at Fort Edward. All games will be scheduled for either Friday or Saturday nights, so that studies and recitations may not suffer. rrhe management will endeavor to l11ake this particular branch of sport self-suppo1ting. All games will be played away fron1 home, until circutnstances will warrant a contest on hotne grounds. The candidates for pos1tions on the team are as follows: Huntley, '99, Lawton, 1900, Ander- son, 1900, Paige, 1900, :Bahler, 1901, Golden, rgor, Bowden, rgor, Carver, Igor, Mallery, rgor, Slack, 1901, Wight, 1901, Gulnac, 1902, Hays, 1902,, Hinman, 1902, Oakley, 1902, Shaw, rgoz,. Thebo, 1902. For the first night's practice the first team was composed of the following men: Thebo, t 902, captain; Anderson, :t 90o, Paige, 1900, Carver, rgor., Mallery, 1901. The second team was made up of Hinn1an, rgo2, captain; Hunt- ley, '99, Gulnac, 1902, Hays, 1902, Shaw, 1902. A great deal of enthusiasm is manifested in this sport, and some very satisfactory results may be expected.

The American Monthly Review of Reviews for January begins its new volume with a strong issue. The two important and timely subjects of American diplomacy and territorial expansion figure prom- inently in the January nu:mber. The editor reviews the historic year 1898 from the international view- point and discusses pending- national problems. The much talked-of recent visit of Mr. W. T. Stead to the Cza,r of Russia is described in full by Mr. Stead himself. The significance of the inter- view with the young \Emperor of Peace\ ·will be appreciated by all who have followed the disarma- ment proposition. Mr. Stead's article has also a distinctly personal interest, which is heightened by the new portraits of the Czar, the Czarina, and their children, which compose the illustrations. An illustrated anecdotal character sketch of the late General Garcia, the Cuban patriot, is con- tributed by George Reno, who was closely asso- ciated with General Garcia for two years. The frontispiece is a portrait of General Garcia taken only a few days before his death. The question of the bearings of our federal Con- stitution on the government of newly acquired ter- ritories, about which so much haze seems to have gathered in the popular mind, is very clearly and e:x:haustively treated by Prof. Harry Pratt Judson, of the University of Chicago. \Our Diplomacy in th.e Spanish War\ is a most timely topic pending the Senate's ratification of the peace treaty. The important developments in diplomacy which led up to the signing of that treaty are exhaustively reviewed by Mr. Henry Macfarland, the well-known Washington corre- ~pondent. Many peop[e fail to realize how im- portant a part diplomacy played in achieving the results of the war. Mr. Macfarland writes from the view-point of intimate \inside\ information. Margherita Adina Hamm gives a survey of the work of the Red Cross on the field and in the hospital. \A great American Sculptor\ is the title of an article in which Miss Laura Carroll Dennis describes the work and career of that rising young genius, Mr. George Grey Barnard. The article is illustrated with photographs taken especially for the Review. Tt)e 8op~o~m,ore Soiree. The Sophomore Soiree committee is now organized and is working actively for the suc- cess of the mid-winter social event. The com- mittee has been considerably hampered in its efforts through the inability of securing the Van Curler opera house as the place for holding the dance. The opera house has been the scene ot many a pretty dance in years past and much regret has been expressed over the present conditions. The question of a place has not been fully determined upon as yet but it is not unlikely that the new dancing hall on lower State street will be the one chosen. Memorial Hall and the Hotel Edison have also been sug- gested. The dance will be held on the evening of February ro. The other particulars have not been settled upon as yet but will be ready for announcement in the next issue. The comn1ittee is as follows : George Hackett, Delta Phi, chairman; G. LeRoy Shelley, Phi Delta Theta ; John E. Parker, Kappa Alpha ; Richard F. Warner, Sigma Phi ; LeRoy J. Weed, Psi Upsilon; James N. Miller, Alpha Delta Phi; Horatio J. l3rown, Chi Psi; Rod- man H. Robinson, Phi Gamma Delta ; Charles J. Bennett, Beta Theta Pi; Leopold Minken, Delta Upsilon; and Guy B. Collier.

Burrows, Printer, .of.I4 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. A HOLLOW sound proceeding from the treasury suggests emptiness. Emptiness suggests that some one ought to pay his subscription. Receipts will gladly be exchanged for two dollars and fifty cents at any time. This is no joke. SOME time ago The Coucordiensis asked for detailed information concerning Union men who enlisted in the late war. As yet the list is very incomplete, and we wish that all those who can give any information, would send it in as soon as possible. WITHIN a few months the annual oratorical con- test between Rochester, Syracuse and Union will be held, and about the middle of February there wilt be a preliminary contest to select Union's rep- resentative. Last year the exhibition was held in Schenectady and the medal was won by the Union speaker. We hope that the college may be as well \ cerns, managed for the material interests of the editors. 'I' he Concordiensis and The Parthenon are just as truly college organizations as the musi- cal ,association, the literary societies and the athletic teams. Tl1ere may be some who cannot afford to sub- scribe for the college papers, but the majority have , no s1:1ch e.xcuse and have sufficient means to spend in other ways which do not advance the interests of the college as the papers do. Some of these non- subscribers are members of ,the various college • organizations, whose events The Concordiensis chronicles, and these are the very students who complaiR if the events are not fully reported. The editors are doing all they can to advance the interests of the college. Is it not then the duty of the students to stand by the college papers and support them, just as much as any other college organization? ALL THOSE who have not paid their subscriptions to the musical association are urgently requested to do so without delay. The management is greatly ham-pered from lack of funds, and there are numer- ous expenses that must be paid. The subscription is not a heavy one and there is not a man in col- lege who cannot afford to pay it. The tnanagers have already drawn. on their own resources to meet current expenses, expecting that the students wou.ld pay up, and they positively refuse to go further 11ntil they have been reimbursed to the full extent of the outlay they have already so generously made. The managers also state that many of the students have not yet settled up for the tickets represented this year, and make the suggestion which they disposed of for the Schenectady concert.

We The of is to sub- con- the en on the sub- pend non- who ance and col- ents go full the THE CONCORDIEN:SIS. 9 Now, this is a down right shame. The association needs this money badly, and the students have no more right to retain it in their possession than they have to retain the money of an individual. '!'hey are appropriating indefinitely for their own use, funds that do not belong to :theJn, while the mana- ger has been compelled to put his hand into his pocket, in order to meet expenses. Is this the return that the students desire to make for gener- osity? We do not think so. But let every student pay up, and do so now. f4 1901 r{T\aQ i:Q Trouble. On December zo, 189'8, there happened at Greenville, S. C., an event of much interest to Union undergraduates, and yet one not generally known to· them. The Concordiensis learned of the affair shortly after its occurence and since then has been endeavoring to learn something n1ore than the bare particulars. Thus far, how- ever, little success has been 1net with, and in this number is published the brief t~eport sent out by the Associated P1~ess on the following day. It was as follows : GUARD KILLS A SOLDIER. Greenville, S. C., Dec. 21.-Private Murg- ridge, Second West Virginia regitnent, was shot and instantly killed yesterday by Private John Mattice of the Two Hundred and Third New York regiment, who also shot and wounded Private Hart of the Second West Virginia. Murgridge and Hart were at pistol practice in the woods near the regimental camp. Mattice, who was on guard duty; started to arrest the men, when, it is claimed, Murgridge fired twice at him. Mattice returned the fire, the ball pass- ing through Murgridge's body and striking Hart in the side. I-Iart denies tbat either he or Murgridge ·fired at the guard. General Kline has ordered Mattice to be turned over to the civil authorities for trial. It is of course needless to say that Private John Mattice is a former member of the class of 1901, he having left college at the outbreak of the war last spring. fl}e D·eeeo~ber partl)eQOIJ. The Parthenon for December unavoidably com~es from the press a little late, but contains two very irtterestimg letters : '' Union in the 'Turkish Etnpire,\ by William H. Hall, '96, aow at the head of the primary department .of the Syrian Protestant college, Beirut, SJria; and ''A Letter, fro1n Cuba,''' by Hirarn C. .. Todd, '9'7, now a zn d: Lieut. in the 202nd Reg't New \. ... ork Volunteer Infantry, which was the van-guard of the anny of occupation. There is also a new Union song, written by Joseph A. O'Neill, '97, entitled Rah l Rah I Rah ! President Raymond last Saturday was in New York, where he was the principal speaker that evening at the fourth meeting in the ~interests of students and recent college graduates of New York city. 'I'he meeting took place at the Cavalry Episcopal church and was presided over by Bishop Potter. Dr. Raymond's subject was \ The Young Man's Duty to the State,\ and the other speaker, Hamilton W. Mabie, editor of The Outlook, discussed the question, . '''The Young Man's Duty to Religion.\ persoQals. G. H. Dudley, '75, was the guest of the Chi Psi fraternity on Monday. James C. Cooper, '97, has been elected vice- president of the seni()r class of the Albany Law school. Civil service examinations, open to all, will be held in most large toV\rns in March, to get clerks for Uncle Satn. Persons wishing to know the dates, and places and how the positions can be obtained can write Columbian Correspondence College, Washingto11, D. C., and same will be furnished without cost.

Paige, ,took place at the First Presbyterian church Friday everting, before a go<>d sized and appreciative audience. The lecture was deHv·ered by the Rt. Rev. Henry C. Potter, bishop of NeV\ 1 York, who treated the subject, '' Lectures and Lecturers,\ in a pleas- ant and ente1·taining manner. President Raymond introduced the speaker referring to the Bishop's father in a cotnpliment- ary manner and then speaking of the son's relation to Old Union. The speaker in turn complimented Dr. Raymond and made a reference to his early days at Union. He said that the lecture originated in the far East, but what we undetrstand as the modern lecture had its origin in. Greece, when Plato and Socrates addressed gatherings at Athens. The speaker then traced the evolution of the lecture from its beginning to its present state. But, he said, \during the past forty years the lecture has gradually been declining and as an educational factor its importance has been greatly · diminished. The class of lectures £fty years ago was one of great intellectual and literary value, and conspicuous among this class was the pure oratory of Wen dell Phillips. :But now the whole tendency of modern life is overcrowded with the 1naterial, and hence is in direct opposi- tion to that kind of oratory. In those days the lecture pia tform was one of the greatest factors in education. There were two reasons for this, scarcity of litet·ature and the human personality. Even if hooks had been less expensive it was the charm of personal contact that made the lectu~es of so great educational value.\ Dr. Potte1· then named sotne of the great lecturers of that period, among these Dr. N ott, Dr. Potter, Henry Ward Beecher and George William Curtis. Upon these he dwelt for some time and related som·e amusing anecdoteswhich :strongly brought out th~e personal characteristics · of each. The zeal of these ·lnen in the lecture fi.eld turned the attention of English lecturers to this country, and soon we had such men as Thackery, Dic 1 kens and Kingsl~ey lecturing in America. In concluding, the speaker said t~a:t the lecture was an institution that should be developed , and in1proved and that if we could bring it up to the standard of fifty years ago we should have a factor in education surpassed by none of the modern educational institutions. The soiree committee is working hard and doing its best to m·ake the affair a success. At a meeting held last Tuesday it was p.roposed to hold the dance in the Round Building, and after consulting several of the engineering pro- fessors the committee has decided that the hall can be heated and wiil in every way be adequate for their purpose. Hence Memorial Hall will be the scene of the dance on February 10. Although this scheme is a comparativeiy new one, it promises to be a great success and deserves the support of every man in college. At the meeting the following officers were elected and sub-committees appointed : Treasurer, H. J. Brown. Printing- Minkin, Shelly, Mille1~, Warner, Weed. Carriages-Bennett, Robinson, Minkin. Music-Collier, Shelly, Weed, Benn.ett. Refreshments-Warner, Shelly, Brown, Par- ker, Miller. Patronesses-H. J. Brown, Weed, R. Robin- son, Warner, Parker. The music will be furnished by Gioscia, and a very pleasant time may be expected by every- body who attends.

THE CONOORD!:E1NS1S .. Tl]e fUpl]a Delts Eljter:tairJ. A very pleasant dance was given last Friday by the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity to their Schenectady friends. The four main roo.ms on the first floor of the chapter ho;use were thrown open for dancing and ·were well filled with merry couples. The floor was in fine condition and Gioscia and his assistant fairly outdid themselves, so that dancing was continued until well along in the morning. The patronesses were Mrs. Raymond, Mrs. DeRem.er, Mrs. Angle, Mrs. Ashmore, Mrs. Stoller and Mrs. Carey. The guests were Miss MiHer, Miss Ostrom, Miss Kingsbury, Miss Williams, Miss Price, Miss VanDeusen, Miss Paige, Miss Beattie, the Misses Yates, Miss Brown, Miss Kellogg, Miss Campbell, Miss Mason, Miss Alexander, Miss Hildreth, Miss Dora Yates, Miss Horstmann, Miss Schoolcraft and Miss Fisher; and Messrs.

Cann., director of gytnnastics at New York university : ''We are to hold an intercollegiate gymna:stic contest in ·our gymnasium, March 24th. Cups will be given to first, second and third places, in the following events: H·otizontal and parallel bars, tumbling, side-horse, rings and club swinging. Also a cup to the one .making the greatest num- ber of points in the all-round work, he to be known as the champion all-round college gym- nast. We have already had assurances from fourteen of the leading colleges and universities, and it will probably be the greatest gymnastic event ever held in the college world. We want Union to be represented here that night, and if you will send a representative, we shall be glad to pay his traveling expenses, and give him suitable entertainment. I ask your cooperation in this matter., as it will give the students an incentive to work and ·make gymnastic work more popular. I shaH hope to hear from you at an early date.\ This proposition has m.et with favor, and it has been decided to send a representative accord- ing to the terms ·stated. Competition is now going on in the gymnasitun,, and it is hoped that a suitable man will be chosen, who will maintain the good record which Union has always held in athletics. The debating societies are now holding weekly debates in preparation for the Allison-Foote prize debate which is to take place the evening of Charter Day. The subject for the debate will be: ''Resolved, That the United States shou'ld build and control the Nicaragua Canal.\ The Philomatheans have elected the following officers for the ensuing term : Pl'esident, H. J. Hinman, '99 ; vice-president, E. LeC. Hege- man, '99; secretary, J. W. ·Cheese borough, 1901 ; treasurer, Leopold Minldn, 1901; cura- tor, H. C.

THE CONCORDIENStS. 7 ~oHe~e .fniQstrels. Among the many things that are occupying the attention of ~students at Union today, is the organization of a minstrel troupe. The many advantages to be derived from work in this line, are apparent. 'The students in ~many instances have been helplessly burdened by the sub- scriptions solicited from time to time. The gain from effort in this line woukl strengthen to a great m·easure the financial basis of college athletics and also relieve the students. At the college meeting held on Monday morning, many helpful suggestions were offered by the students, and especially by Prof. Pollard, who is strongly in favor of the movement. No subscriptions for this work are to be requested of the students or fa-culty, as the main intention is to make it self-supporting. All members of the troupe are to be selected from the 'Student body, thus making it an entirely college affair. A meeting was held Wednesday night to perfect the organization. About fifty students were present, and judging from the enthusiasm shown, the ~ffair will no doubt be a success. There is sufficient material in the college to make up a good troupe, and all that remains is for the whole student body to enter into hearty co-operation with the work. DAVID W. FENTON, '51. David W. Fer..ton, who for many years was well known as a practicing lawyer in New York, died on January zo, at the home of his brother in Buffalo, where he went to transact some business. Mr. Fenton was born 73 years ago at.Gilboa, N.Y., and was graduated from Union in 1851· He retired fro1n practice several years ago. Mr. Fenton was a widower, his wife having died several years ago. He was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa fraternity, the Legal Aid society, a life member of the Atneri- can Geographical society and of the Quill club. Mr. Fenton leaves a sister and three brothers. The burial was in Orange, N.J. Not Guilty. The following communication has been re- ceived by The Concordiensis, relating to the Mattice affair, of which a short account was printed last week. Greenville, S. :c. , Jan. 20, '99. Tlze Concordiensis: Private John B. Mattice, 203rd N. Y. V. I., formerly of the class of 1901, Union College,. while on duty as a sentinel in the provost guard at Greenville, S. C., was fired upon by two men of the 2:nd West Virginia regiment, whom he was attempting to arrest. They started then to run away and as they refused to halt and were about to escape Private Mattice :fired one shot, killing one and wounding the other. The wounded man claimed they were :fired upon without provocation and Mattice \vas tried by court martial for murder. Capt. Edward P. \'\Vhite '79, Union College, defended him. The verdict will be kept secret until approved by the President, but it is under- stood to be \Not guilty. \ Indeed Mattice deserves credit for courageously doing his duty. . The captains of the various college and uni- versity base ball teams for 1899 are as follows: Princeton, F. W. Kafer; Harvard, P. Houghton; Yale, C. A. H. DeSaulles; Cornell, J. F. Mur- taugh; Amherst, W. J. Righter; Brown, 0. W. Sedgwick; Lehigh, E. G. Grace; Lafayette, Hugh Nevins; Syracuse, H. S. Kelly; West Point, A. S. Cowan; Univ. Vennont, A. K. Aldinger; Dart- mouth, P. F. Drew; Union, G. M. Wiley. Representatives of Cornell, Colutnbia and Pennsylvania met at the Hoffman House Satur- day for the purpose of talking over the rowing situation. It was practically decided to hold an open intercollegiate race over the Poughkeepsie course the last week in June. It is possible that the race will be a five cornered affair. Word has been received that Wisconsin will send a crew, and the University of Toronto is now pretty sure to be represented. Invitations will be sent to both Yale and Har- vard, but as they have arranged a dual race, to be held at New London, they will, of course, decline to enter the contest a.t Poughkeepsie.

Burrows, Printer, 414 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. HAVE you any criticism to make concerning The Concordiensis? Does it not come up to your idea of a college paper? Is it not as good a college weekly as you have seen, published by s01ne other college? You who have any ideas on the subject and think that you can improve the paper in any respect, just sit down and write somethin.~ that will remedy the defect, or if you cannot do it your- self, communicate with the paper, and the editors will show you due courtesy. If you know of any- thing that would be of interest to other students, write it down and hand it in for publication. Don't depend upon the editors to do it all. WHY is it, that every time a student attempts to show some of his lady friends through the dormi- tories, this should be the occasion for a reign of bedlamites? At the first sound of a woman's voice in the sections, e~ery one loses his self-control and gives vent to a wild Apache yell; some one cries ''heads out,'' and coal hods, oil cans and broken chairs are sent thumping down the stairs. We have read that the dulcent tones of the female voice have a magnetic power, but we have always sup- ' posed that the eifect was soothing to 1nan. The inhabitants of coUege dormitories, however, must be of a peculiar :species. Such demonstrations of feeling may help to vary the usually monotonous life of the student, but the reception, which must sound more like a sudden volcanic eruption to the visitors, can be anything but agreeable to them. This may be lots (l)f fun for the student, but in a period of refinetnent and culture, such customs should be given a decent funeral, and a tombstone erected over the grave, heavy enough to prevent their escape. IN ORDER to develop strong kickers for the Pennsylvania football teams, an ann11,al kicking, punting and drivtng contest has been. arranged. As a prize for ,the winner, a $100 solid silver challenge cup has been presented by the alumni. It is a perpetual challenge cup, and will belong for each year to the man who can surpass all others in all-around kicking and handling a foot- ball. The winner is determined by an elaborate set of rules. This would be a wise plan for Union to adopt. If it ,could be successfully carried out it would be the means of developing some good foot- ball material. Good kicking often plays an important part during a football game, and it is sometimes the neans of making a gain of many yards at a critical moment. Any plan that will improve the tean1 ought to be adopted, and every point that is being made use of by other teams should be noted. It is only within the last few years that the importance of good kicking has been realized. In games on our own campus, we have many a time seen the result of poor kicking. If practice can remedy this defect, the Pennsyl- vania plan should be adopted. A subscription is being taken by prominent New Yorkers for the widow of the late Col. vVaring. It is proposed to raise $r oo,ooo, the interest of which will be paid quarterly to Mrs. Waring, and upon her death the principal will go to Columbia University. w. last w Col .aft ern Ra: days Tb to tal s. frate.

The total number of college rnea in the United States is small, there being about one collegian to every 8oo of the population; and yet in our national Senate 53 out of a membership of 90 are college bred men.

10 THE ·O:ONCORDlENSIS. On the occasion of the seventy-fifth anni- versary of Miatni University, in June, 1899, Whitelaw Reid wiU present to the school his library, which is said to be one of the finest private ·collections of books and manuscripts in America. Investigations have recen~ly been 1nade as to · the nurnber of United States cabinet officers who were college graduates. ·Out of 262, I 78, or 111ore than two-thi11ds, have been college .gJiadu- ates. Of this nutnber Princeton had 22 repre- sentatives, Yale and Harvard 21 each, \tVillia1n and Mary Io, Dickinson 2, Lafayette 2, and the University of North ~Carolina 8. A new method of electing mem hers to the Phi Beta Kappa society has been inaugurated at . Amherst. The choosing of a certain percent- age of a class has been abolished and a rank standard substituted, 88 and 8 5 per cent. re- spectively for the first and second drawings. The faculty is no longer to elect tnetnbers, but will recom.mend students for membership for the final election of the active chapter. Representatives of Harvard, Pennsylvania, Pr~inceton, C@lumbia and Cornell universities recently held a 'meeting in New York for the purpose of arriving at som·e uniformity in entrance examinations. The p~an devised pro- vides for a board which :shall make uniform entrance requi:rements and hold unifonn entrance examinations.
