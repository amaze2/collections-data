Jrr i 3 the uuanin1ous verdict of the faculty that no better work was ever done here than was done last term.-. President Rayrnond. THE season of athletics is over, and football will give place to glee clubs as a New York daily recently said, ''' with less fatal results.\ We wish that soine- thing could be done to boom glee club stock at ·union. The college expects great thin g·s from the Banjo, Mandolin · and Guitar clubs, but nobody seems to be willing to say very muchabout the glee club. THERE is another tin1ely. subject of which we wish to speak. This is the season of banquets. It has been the cus- tom in recent years for the undergrad- uates of Union to publicly de1nonstrate the fact that students eat as well as other people, by holding a -rousing feast of reason and flow of soul. That some enthusiasts have carried the feast beyond reason,. and that other things besides soul have flowed, goes without saying, but -it has always been the unanimous ·v€rdict of all those fortunates who have attended Union banquets that a right royal tin1e was the tei.ru acquitted itself with credit goes withont sayinf;':; and that Union left a favorable imp1·ession in the national capital must he acknowledged when the score, 6 to 6, is. taken into consideration. And although jt becomes necessary for us to supplemen:t .the congratulations ex- tended in our l~st issue, by an additional nod of approva~, nevertheless we feel · compeUed toaclda word of criticisin upon, and protest ag61Linst, athletic contests of · any description apon Christmas day. It llas been Temarked upou several occasions that Union college is not a denominational {;Ollege-. we challenge the remark:. U niou college is not denon1ina- tive in-so- much as it is all-denon1.inational, and while not hampered by the narrow bounds of any J'eLigious sect, it Tecognizes the fundan1enta:J principles of truth and Christianity as :r€quisite to the life and growth of any institution. It is pre- em.inently a Ohr-i<Btian college. _A_s such, the sentiment :()I the college is. against anything that .tends to keep any of its me1nbers from 2, proper observance of any religious festiva1; most especially if the festival be in :remembrance O·f the birth of Christ. Christmas day -teaches a lesson that is nowhere so easiJy learned as within the golden ra.dianc~ of the fa1nily · circle-a lesson that nev~r gTows old with frequent rehearsing. Olnristmas day is a holy day; it is not a holi cLay . in the broad sense of the word. And Jf it n1:eans anything to us, it js that our ]lace is near the hearth

It is when the signs and symbols . of the Natal day are <tistorted and corrupted, that their religioas significai~:ce is lost, and the day bec&mes a mere occasion for the enjoylnent of :fleeting pleasures. It is a 1natter of much satis- faction that the morals oi the college · were never at a higher plaae than at the present day. Every organization in the college is the maker and bearer of a standard; and it is these standards that the public read, and ther€1Jy judge the college. The football team is one of our n1ost pron1inent organizati~ns, and holds ·up one standard to the public. And so we repeat that w bile we ar.e glad to coll- gratulate them upon their work, we feel it our duty to denounce athletic contests on Ohrist1nas day. \It is the little rift wi.thin. bhe- lute, That by and by willrnake the music mute.\ And so it is the little rifts made in the observance of the Day -that commem- orates the giving of Peace on earth, good ~rill to men, that, by- and by, will make the music in the h€art that was attuned in childhood, not only mute but discordant. organizations lH{e the Philo~uathean and those of kindred character, Very nearly, or most of those who bv~ve becorne distinguished as orators, states- n1en, lawyers, divines, etc., and successful in ot~er vocations, were assiduous att~ndants of _debating societies in their ea.rlier years. \ Undergraduate, your name should he upon the roll of the Philomathean or Ade1phic Literary society before those who have tested and _borne evidence to their advantages return at' our Centennial to read the n1embershi:p rolls!

Beckwith, '96, of Litchfield, Conn., will captain the foot hall tea1n next season. Beckwith is a representative Union man, co1nbining the qualities of student and athlete. We believe that he will -vvear his honors gracefully, and that he will prove l1imself worthy of the confidence which his eol- leagues have placed in him. THE New York World recently con- tained an article entitled \No More Di- plomas Without Athletics,'' by Dr. D. A. Sargent, physical director at Harvard. ])r. Sargent is in favor of making physi- cal culture a :feature of the college curri- culum, and says: ''The weakness of this popular movement to-day is the undue pro1ninence that is given to the sporting · and spectacul~r side of athletics, and the aln1ost entire absence in practice of the educational features of these valuable exercises.\ OUl\ own well-organized department of physicai training presided over by Dr. Linhart. At Union, Human Anato1ny, Physiology and Physical Q.ulture are required in all courses. To 1nake the woTk in physical culture more conlpre- hensi ve, Physiology is taught in the freshman year, one hour a week being devoted to its study. This physical train- ing continues through the fTeshman and sophon1ore years, and consists of theoret- ical ana practical -~rork in the gymnasiunl. • 'The course includes calistheni:cs, light and heavy gyrnnastics, physiology of ex- ercise, and physical examinations and measurements. The gymnasium is open for general work, under the supervision of the in- structot\ every day during the college year, from 7 A. M: until 6 P. M. It is desired that every student in college a vail himself of this opportunity to store up health, .strength and endurance. Proper attention is given to athletics, but the principal object is to develop all, rather than to train a select few to do marvelous feats. ·, ',• ·, ' ' ,• ' :, ·.• .:. .,

Dr. Sargent calls attention to the enor- lnous sums yearly spent Olit coaches to perfect the physical condition of a few individuals, and the correspondjng t:nnaU sums which make up the salaries of phys- ical directors and advisers whose duty it is to care :for the physical condition of the studefi: t class, and says: Here is. a little essay .that will doubtless be appre- ciated by the overworked Freshrnan or sportive Soph. It was suggested to 1ne by several gerns of verrse which ba,ve recently come before 1ny notice, and which vividly reealled the days ·when I n1yself . was no poor hand at holding the whip and rib- . boos.

To p:eove it let 1ne quote froin discrepancy between the aetual p€rfonnanee and the s. vV. P. TJ. JoU1'nal: the realizabte ideals in the conduct of physical training at our great universities. The most that can be done for the students who 1'€all_y need phys- ical training, under our present syste1n, is largely of an advisory nature. The sense of duty which each 1nan owes to his present and future well- being is the only incentive to l\:eep up regular, systen1atic efforts towards physical iatprovement. It will be seen that Dr. Sarge:at lan1ents the system of athletics which· is in vogue at Harvard, whereby only eighty, of all her students, become identifie~ with her athletic teams, which it costs fifty thou- sand dollars a year to maintain. In con- clusion, he says ''it is tb:e duty of all persons interested in the welfare of our college youth to use their influence in staying the tide of concentrat€d athletic- isln, and try to give to the physical training of the mass of students who need it son1e part of the titne and atten- tion now given to the physical training of the favored few.'' , John Watkins, '98, is ill at his home in this city. \My boy, you look weary and wan; You are working too hard with your Greek.

Of his work and influence as Professor it is not easy to give an. adequate account. Here, as everywhere, the man counted for more than anything else. His · scholarly ideals, his love of truth, his sy1n pa thy with all that is ennobling, made his very presence an inspiration, for which many are unceasingly grate- ful. It was a severe loss to the college, as well as to his church in .Schenectady, when in 1884 he accepted the unanimous call to the University Place Presbyterian Church, of New York city. Eut his usefulness to the college was not to be lost altogether, for he was irrunediately elected alu1nni trustee, and at the expiration of his terrn of four years was eleeted by the Board a Permanent, or Life Trustee. Frorn the first his services as trustee have been of theutro.ost impo1·tance, as he has not spared time nor money nor strength to ad vance the interests of his Aln1a Mater. He is pre-emi- nently a working Inember, upon whom the college has learned to depend. As Ohairma.n of the Committee on Instruction he is brought into eloser and more constant rela- tions with the practical work of the college than almost any other trustee. With his ability and faithfulness it is is not unnatural that other insti- tutions should seek his help, and he is now a Trus- tee of the University of the City of New York, the Princeton Theo~ogical Se1ninary, and the College of Sao Paulo, Brazil, besides holding official rela- tions with such important organizations as the Board of Foreign. 1\fi~sions of the Presbyterian Chureh, the Phi Beta Kappa Society, and the Union Alumni Association of New York city.
