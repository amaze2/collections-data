He telephoned at about 7:30 PM from an apartment near Georgetown University, where a number of the Schenectady group are staying. The group got up early yesterday morning, and by 6:00 a.m. they were blocking the major arteries to a certain bridge. Similar actions were undertaken by eleven other groups in various parts of the city. Cohen estimated that thet'e were 1,000 people participating in this specific group. It is also estimated that there were 50,000 demonstrators in Washington yesterday. in that the government went on just the same.\ Coh·en commented that protesters were tear-gassed and \everyone who was arrested got clubbed first.\ bank with the intention of taking care of business, and plan~ called for the protesters to enter the bank en masse and . s.tart · discussions • concerning the functions of the organization. However, the group found the First Trust to be closed. One leader took a megaphone and told the group to remain peacefully assembled, and thus make its presence felt. Subsequently, several people tried to raise a Viet Cong flag and wete shooed off. But there were no arrests made or injuries sustained until a tractor-trailer truck tried to get through the mob. A throng, formed trying to block the path of the truck. While that group was being dispersed, Hoyt sa..y four ·Jack Vaughn To Talk O'n. L-atin Revolutions Cohen said that there were a \few\ arrests (he later cited 6,000 as an approximate number) but no major trouble. To his knowledge, there was no one badly hurt.. \Protesters weren't doing anything violent toward the police. All they were doing was moving property into the middle of the road, so as to stop traffic and to stop the government from functioning, but as we have been hearing all day, it hasn't been so successful According to Cohen, early Monday morning police were dubbing people off the roads, but later in the day, as the number of demonstra.tors increased, they used tear gas. The students were tear-.gassed off of the streets of Washington and back onto the Georgetown University campus. Cohen commented that the scene was \very reminiscent of the scene at Kent State.\ The Schenectady group is operating as a unit, and most are safe. Although Cohen did state that there was a possibility that some of the Union and Skidmore students had been arrested, he refused to give names until these suspicio.ns were confirmed.

An open reception Will follow in the Social Sciences faculty lounge. Mr. Vaughn has seen extensive service in,· Latin America, including the following posts: Director of Bi-National Centers in Bolivia and Costa Rica for the US Information Agency, 1949-52; Director of the Joint Fund Economic Development Service in Panama for the Agency for International Development, 1952- 56; Senior Program Economist, AID Mission to Bolivia, 1956-58; Peace Corps Regional Director for LA TIN America, 19961-64; Ambassador to Panama, 1964-65; Idol Chooses New Edito.r Brown To Succeed Lieb Cheryl Brown was elected Editor of the 1971-72 Idol at a recent meeting of the magazine staff. She will succeed James Lieb, who c)lose not to seek another term as Editor. Lieb will be.come Editor Emeritus at tb.e end of this aead<;mic year. _ Miss 'Brown is a sophmore Ehglisb major from Ballston Spa. She attended Wells College last year, and -joined the Idol staff upon arriving at Union in September. She was appointed Managing •· Editor when Jim Field left that position at the beginning of the winter term. When asked about future plans, Miss Brown stated, \I hope to expand the artistic potential of the magazine next year. Consideration is being given presently to suggestions that one issue be devoted solely to art and photography.\ Next year's plans also· call for a continuation of the Idol- interview series. This year 1 s interview with John Updike will be available later this term. In response to questions about student participation in the magazine, Miss Brown went on to say: Student submissions have increased greatly during this term in what appears to be a very favorable response to the winter issue of the Idol. If this is any indication of future interest, the outlook for the Idol is good. As for participation on the magazine staff, we now have a nine- member Editorial Boatd which, we believe gives us a fairly accurate indication of student likes and dislikes. Positions are still available on both the Art and Business staffs and, . as four members of the Editorial Board will be seniors nest year, new members will be needed there also,\ Miss Brown indicated that Estelle Cooke, who recently became Business Manager, will continue in that capacity next yeat. No appointment has been made yet to fill the position of Managing Editor which Miss Brown's election leaves vacant. On. Wednesday, May 5, at 9 p.m. in Memorial Chapel, there will be a showing of the film Report from China\. A Japanese documentary, this film provides an objective, up-to-date look at life in China.

Marcuse was born in 1895, and raised in a family which was part of upper class Berlin society. As a philosophy student, Marcuse was a follower of the moderate German left wing, but in the midst of the turbulence of the Wiermar Republic he became disillusioned with the ruling Social Democrats. With the ascension of Hitler, Marcuse fled Germany and settled in the United States ·in 1934. He became a naturalized American citizen in 1940. During World War II and for several years thereafter, Marcuse worked in the military intelligence service. Having originally taught at Columbia University, Marcuse moved to Brandeis i:n 1954, where for eleven years he served as a professor of philosophy and political science. During this span of time Marcuse produced his two best-known works Eros and Civilization (1955) and One Dimensional Man (1964). The former piece involves an attempt to synthesize the writings of Marx and Freud regarding repression and society, while the latter is a harsh critique of contemporary American life. Marcuse started to gain public attention in 1967, at which time Continued on Page 2

~ CONCORDIENSIS, . MA, Y 4,. 1971 To the Editor: I would like to address this letter primarily to my fellow· seniors in the Class of '71. As .some of you may remember, we all .paid a $50 admission deposit · to the college when we decided to martriculate at Union. It is college p.olicy to automatically return this deposit during the summer to a:ll . students who :- graduate, less any amounts that the student may owe the college for lab fees, damag_es, etc. upon graduation. There are no doubt some ·seniors to whom this money is .important, and who therefore are depending on . · .getting it back. But for the ·majority of seniors this money is probably not that crucial. Many of you may even have forgotten about it. I would. therefore like to propose that those seniors who can spare the · $50 do so by donating it· to· the college. This· would be an · excellent way to · begin your · alumni' giving and · would be a tremendous service to the school in the current financial squeeze. It may even be a t.-adition-e$tablishing pre~edent for other classes to follow .. The college prefers unrestricted gifts, but if you would~ rather specif'y how your gift.: is to be used there are lllany deserving_ items s~ch as th~ Student Center ·Fund or the Scholarship. Fund. Most of us won't be able to continue to give regularly in the next several years, so donatbtg yo\Jr deposit is a relatively painless waY.of .helping now. Within the next week I hope to provide au seniors with a form which they can sign in .order to donate the balance of their deposit, .a,nd on which they can specify the use of the money.- I sincerely hope this project is strongly . $.Upported, especially ' since the Class of '71 has no plans for the . traditional \class gift.\ Y oqts. truly, .

Revolutionary student protest leaders in Europe, and later in America, stated that they were deeply influenced by his works. When it became known that Marcuse had held conversations with at least one European radical, conservative · elements within California threatened to oust him from the state university system, and he received a death threat. While the controversy surrounding Marcuse has lessened in the very recent past, his works continue to provide a unique radical perspective. Among other things, Marcuse has charged that the post- industrial society keeps its citizens in a \state of anesthesia.\ The subject of the professor's Friday speech is \Beyond. the One-Dimensional Society.\ \Kool and the Gang,\ a seven man soul and jazz group, will be in-concert Thursday, May 6, at Union College: The performance, sponsored by the Black Alliance at Union, is set for 8:30 p.m. in Memorial Chapel on the campus.

Some groups said they were planning to return Monday evening to disrupt traffic. There were rumors that there was to be a curfew la.st night, and also that there was to be a meeting to organize today's activities. Cohen thought that today's activities were to include a march on the Justice Building but that there were \so many rumors you really · don't know what to believe.\ P.~ople regrouped late yesterday · afternoon, although many had left because \they f~lt that the major action\ was over .. Cohen estimated that there will be less than 10,000 protesters in Washington today. His opinion is that it is \very likely that Tuesday will be one mass arrest\ because the group will be more militant after having participated in yesterday's activities. He predicts that the police may get out of hand because tltey are ''ready to club right away\ and although there are a \'lot of nice guys\ who told the demonstrators they would call in sick, that there are also a \lot of ... pigs who just really groove on knocking people around.\ He believes that today \will be a day of rc..~l action.\ · Cohen plans to call WRUC again tonight if he is not arrested . in today's activities.

Th~ · ~nal · tally was 36-35. The Greek leaped out to an early lead by downing five quick dishes of jello ak the outset of the match; and maintained that lead for forty minutes, at which time Mike knotted the count at 21. At this point, the latter put his 28th helping into his mouth ahead of Greek, giving Castoro his enly · lead; but 1t was short-'lived as the Greek swallowed his 29th serving before· his oppon~nt could manage to do so. Indeed, it was Mike's inability to swallow quickly that led to his ultimate downfall; on the other hand, Greek had the magnificent talent of popping jello into his mouth and downing it within five seconds. With a minqte to go, each man had 33 jellos in his bulging stomach, but in the furious finish, the Greek took the win by the slimmest of margins.

The disappointing Dutchmen now show only one -win in five starts, that a shaky 6-5 win over Trinity. by BILL HOLLERAN goals. Attackman Bill Berry was the big man on effense for the Panthers, as he t·hrew in four goals and added an assist. Middlebury's biggest sco~ing threat, Brad Bruce, was held firmly in check by the Garnet defense. Midfielder Bruce, who entered the contest with 20 goals and 10 assists in only seven games, was limited. to a single assist by the close•checking Dutchmen rearguards ..

Emerging battered but under- standably more experienced after their arduous tripleheader, the Garnet stickers rested for a week and then journeyed to Middlebury on Saturday. Union hoped to take advantage of the 4- 3 Panthers and boost their own 1- 3 record in the process. This time the Dutchmen simply played poorly, as Middlebury jumped on Union for five goals in the opening stanza. Forced to play catch-up, the stickers fought back gamely but feU short in the long run. The Garnet could manage only one goal in the first period, but roared back with three tallies in the second quarter to oull to within one at the half, 5-4. Both sides scored once in the third quarter. Union tied the count at five but saw the Panthers come back to grab the lead again, 6-5. The Dutchmen staged a big rally in the final stanza, tallying two markers in a row to go ahead 7-6, but Middlebury shook off Union's efforts to net the last two goals of the contest. Penalites hurt the Garnet in the game's late stages. as the Panthers took advantage of their man-up situations to lay back and control the clock. Mark Sanderson once again had the hot .scoring hand for Union, scoring three times to lead a Garnet attack which saw four Union players net solo The Dutchmen baseballers jumped on Norwich pitching for five runs in the sixth inning on Saturday, converting a 3-2 deficit into a sudden 7-3 lead and an eventual 10-3 win. l'h.e Garnet pounded out 10 hits and stole seven bases, but were helped enormously by six Cadet errors and seven walks by N ~rwich pitching. The Cadets scored first in the top of the first, but the Dutchmen rallied in the last of the second to knot the count when catcher Rick Arons led off with a double and scored. The light-hitting Cadets got to Garnet starter Steve Stockman for two more tallies in their half of the fifth, but Unin got one of the runs back in their half of the frame to trail by only a single marker. Dutchmen bats came alive in the sixth at the same time as Norwich's pitching and defense fell apart: The Garnet capitalized on four singles, two Cadet errors, and a wild pitch to push across five runs and move into the driver's seat at 7-3. DiGregorio, the Norwich starter, pitched well for five frames before he tired and lost his stuff in the sixth inning. He weathe!'ed the sixth but was replaced in· the. seventh stanza by Czekata, who finished up. DiGregorio was solved for seven runs, five of them earned, on seven hits. He walked six and fanned none·. In his two innings of work, Czekata walked one and struck out two, while allowing only one earned run on three hits. · Union's pitching was impressive, as frosh Stockman allowed only four hits and fanned seven in his five inning stint. Senior southpaw Larry Berkeley, seemingly rid of last season's sore arm difficulties, hurled spectacularly in reli~f to pick up the win.

Page 2 CONCORDIENSIS, MAY~ 1971 Nixon Is Entertaining Counter Culture Editor-in-Chief .. by RAY KRIS.E JR As this is the close of Pop Cultur.e Week, I feel behooved to make some sort of comment on Pop Culture, or as it is more properly called, Counter Culture. Counter culture as it exists at Union College is still very much in its infancy. People wear bellhottoms and smoke dope and listen to avant-garde groups 'like Crosby Stills Nash and Come, but the spirit of counter culture, a spirit which says that the values of linear thought and Frank Sinatra have had their day (or, perhaps more properly, have their place, which is not everywhere) does not truly seem to be prevalent. Well, ifs not yet prevalent in real life, Krise, so why are you bitching about its lack here at Union? Because the colleges are supposed to be in the vanguard, that's why. Because; although any truly revolutionary changes are going to come from the - Visit the Bookstore and see the good selection of records they have.

Take away the amplifiers and dope and fringe and posters and you still have your brothers and sisters. The value holds up well. This past weekend in Washington, the greatest joy by far was being in a rough situation together with one's brothers and sisters. The rock festival was as bright as mud by comparison. Perhaps, as in any revolution, what the counter culture could use right now is a return--or, at least, reaffirmation·· of its own .First Principles.

,. Just Another D.C. Day •.• Life can only be interpreted in shades of grey. Nothing ever happens with such distinction that you can say it was good, or bad. So it was in a blossoming, very green and beautiful Washington D.C. on May Day. If you can accept my original premise, read on~ if not, don't bother because in order to project the actual experience of the mQvement I must deal with the impressions, the depressions and the suppressions. The ()verall vibes were great. People shared everything they had. ~ food, drink, shelter and drugs; often with adverse effects as I observed in the medical tents. Kids were really getting bummed out on strichnine treated acid. But, I digress. People were together, th.e · most together mass of people I have ever had the pleasure to be a part of. Music set the tempo all day Saturday as some 45,000 (a newspaper estimate that · I feel halved the actual number) people sunned themselves on the most beautiful day I have experienced during this young year. By 6:30 AM the nex:t morning, the police decided that the permit had been violated and the park had to be evacuated; the grounds being that drugs were being used ( what the ~~ll did they expect ). This turned out to be a very strategic move because a number of influential Black speakers were plan~ed for that day; an effort directed to ·mobilize the surrounding Black community behind the efforts of the May Day . committee. The people headed for the shelter of the Universities, even though, as you might have well . guessed, the presidents tried to shut them down. I attended a New York regi<?nal meeting where plans were discussed to block the very pivotal DuPont Circle. Later, on a ride through Georgetown, I caught my first glimpse of what turned out to be some 10,000 national guardsmen that had been mobilized for the occassion. on stag• 2BROADWAY SMASH MUSICALS zAMERICAN THEATRE .UAGU£{ tues.may Ut:h p R 0 c T 0 R I s SCHIIIICTAD' EVE.

Innumerable police fl~shed us the \peace sign\ while two Black cops at different times and places gave me the power first and one said, \Right · on!\ What the hell does that mean? One of my compatriates felt that he was simply sympathetic to our cause. Then he lias no right to be in the uniform. Another believed that he just :needed a job and a cop seemed like a logical choice because it paid well. There it is. This goddamn system has placed its putrified capitalistic gams ahead of personal conviction and forced this ideology down the throats of its oppressed. When the police start beating on the heads of the protestors, they were ·pummeling on their own heads in the hope that they were knocking their minds clear of any remnants of past conviction. You're not going to ever, ever win against a force like that as long as they're armed and yoy're not. However, by Monday, I still thought we had a chance. A chance? We didn't have a whispering prayer. At 5:00 AM when I arrived at DuPont Circle, the cops were mobilized in fUll force with clubs, guns and gas, gas, gas. Slowly we felt out the situation by walkiri'g the side streets, looking and occasionally taling to very uptight police. 1 was totally scared as I looked at the cops' guns but they saw something in my eyes that surely frightened them because they stuttered like blithering morons. As more and more people arrived, the Circle itself became the center of attention with incidents of hit and nm tactics causing assorted tear gas and pepper gas cannisters to be shot into the crowds. The third member of our party chanced to cross the street on a \don't walk\ sign and was quickly locked in a mass of blue arms and taken to the center of the circle as the Other member •Of our affinity group and I looked on in disbelief. He was plucked from among thousands, like the majority of the 7,000 arrested that day, for jay-walking. At this point, some fifteen hours after his arrest, I still don't know how he is, where he is or if he is! By 7:00 A.M., the national . gmud arrived en masse. More gas, more guns and more hit and run tactics. Windows were broken and cops knocked off their scooters J)y large garbage cans hurled their way appropriate. Fires, small ones, broke out on the various side streets. Cops were swinging like crazy and I saw more than a few demonstrators go down under a flurry. Personally, I was movin'. Never in one spot for more than a few minutes and plenty wary of what was around corners and in alley ways. Tear and pepper gas had pretty well penetrated the area with both demonstrators and neutral on-lookers visibly affected. I have never used the term \pig\ before because I felt I ba1l never met a pig wearing a blue uniform and a badge. I met . 30,000 of them this weekend. If • demonstrators were caught in between cars, the drivers were told by the pigs to run them over. They didn't. I asked one what I could do to find my jay-walking friend. I He said, \You better move along fast or you'll join him,\ all the while waving his club in my face. Unmercifully when a demonstrator was apprehended, the pigs beat him, or her, until he was down and out. A teal display of animalism. I suppose I could co-ntinue with other gory details and my experience at the, criminal court house trying to find my friend to give him bail money but it would be mere repetition. The pigs had thrown us out of the camp grounds. because we had violated our permit. With an absolutely incredible show of force, the demonstrations were crushed and, according to the Washington press, the \political and social misfits\ had miserably failed. Not so. Not true at all. Traffi.c was stopped and the city was inconvenienced, not to the degree hoped for but somewhat nonetheless. People on the street walking to work spoke to me and voiced sympathy and emotion for our cause. Opinion was changing and that was my own personal motivation. Get people to decide where they stand· - pro or con. No more of this middle of the road crap. IpJerestingly enough, Sam Stratton could not be reached, Milhous was out of town and no one gave a damn where Spiro was or what he was saying. Still, Attorney General Mitchell asserted_ that business on May 3, 1971 in Washington D.C. was \as usuaL\ A very grey statement, although an obvious attempt at categorically dismissing the demonstrations, if I have ever hel!rd. qne; NOW LISTEN TO YOUR FAVORITE MUSIC AT\ PRICES 'IOU CAN AFFORD \States Only AU Pana~C?nic StQ~_e'' i~*=~Tt~ §TA(7t~.

About being kicked out of the park: it was the first stupid move the cops pulled, a harbinger of stupidity to come. In the first place, it was so obviously a political move, and even the . officials didn't try very hard to hide that fact. The reason given for the revocation of the permit to sleep m the park was the \many flagrant violations of the terms of the .agreement, el!lpecially narcotics abuse.\ Which means that people were smoking dope, although not nearly so much as at a normal rock concert. Which is what both sides knew is what happens 'at rock festivals, and they knew it before the treaty was even drawn up. And when asked why, if the deicision to kick everybody out had been reached the previous afternoon, then why did you wait until early Sund~Jy morning to throw· people out?, the cops admitted that they wanted to disperse people (i.e., send them home) and that the kids would be caught off.guard by the early-morning move. Somewhere between 45 and 200 people were busted for refusing to leave, depending on who your source was. The helicopters circled overhead, more frequent and obnoxious than ever. The pigs' move was stupid because it created a group solidarity which had been lacking, and a sense of resolve to fuck up a government which feels that people are puppets to be manipulated at its whim, and that dangerous (i.e., young and/ or disagn;~ing) people . are perhaps not even people at all. You walked out of the park with a chill in the layers of your skin, a chill brought by the slight damp of early morning and by cold hatred of the 22 busloads of pigs in riot gear who had encircled the park. Tomorrow, pig, tomorrow. We passed the (Francis. Scott) Key Bridge on our way to Georgetown University. Key Bridge was target number I on the map you have, assigned to the Upstate New York Region. Your region. Your bridge. Disappointment, because it's not Gothic at all, there are no defense turrets, nor sirens or searchlights, no military pomp. Hell, it's a piece of concrete across the Potomac, nothing more romantic than something to help the fat daddies of the suburbs get their Pontiacs into Washington. But it's ours. Georgetown University is like a 5,000-person Catholic Union College. We about doubled its population. Imagine 1,500. extra kids - radicals and beyond - pouring into Union the weekend before finals, and you'll have a rough idea of what the scene was like. The fucking police helicopters kept buzzing overhead. There were meetings all day long. Regional meetings. Affinity group meetings. State meetings. Affinity group leader meetings. Combined regional meetings. It was . drizzling. The food was oatmeal (sort of) with raisins. It was good. And baloney sandwiches. .

It pointed out the iron rule of these men ~ led by the Goebbles of D.C, John Mitchell - to rule, and to n,tle unquestionably.

The Dutchmen now face an uphill struggle if . they hope to post Union's first winning tennis season in nine years. The Garnet started fast in both singles and doubles play, as Marty Cukierman at number one singles swept his opponent 6-3 . I and 6-4. Cukierman combined with Stu Fisch!~r in the doubles epener. the pai· sweeping to a 6- 3, 6-0 wir Union e:•d not fare as well in their remaining singles matches, as number two singles man Fischler dropped a tough match in thrct' sets, 6-4, 6-8, and 2-6. Number i 'lree man Er.nie Guillet lost his encounter in straight sets, while Jim Skiff opened his match with a 6·4 win but dropped the next two sets by identical 6-2 scores. Tim Moran, at anumber five, was swept by his Engineer opponent in straight sets, and Bob Mandry wrapped up singles play with a close deteat m three sets. Mandry lost his first set 6-3, rallied to win the second set 6-3,. but dropped the deciding encounter 7-5. The Garnet played well in their remaining two doubles matches, but nonetheless dropped two tight decisions to their RPI adversaries. Skiff and Guillet opened the number two doubles match with a 6-4 triumph, but were shaded the final ~wo sets by 6-3 counts. Mandry and Rick Judd dropped a ten-game ·pro set, 10-1 1 to provide the Engineers with their final win of the afternoon. / Westbrook's homerun in the third inning carried over the 330 foot mark in left field, and scored Dale Long and Mitchell ahead of him. The blast gave Union a 4-l lead and knocked out starting Great Dane pitcher Kevin Quinn. lhe Dutchmen won the game Spikers B~est Doub~le Foes With a benevolent and radiant smile, Mother Nature bestowed her spring . delights upon the Garnet track team Wednesday, providing the spik.esters with the first ideal running and jumping weather of the season. The Union cindermen reciprocated The Gracious One's maganimity by notching two surprisingly easy victories over squads from Middlebury and Williams. The meet, scored as a double dual encounter, saw the , Dutchmen rack up 108 points against the hapless Ephmen's 37, and 83 tallies to Middlebury's 61. The Gamet, now at 4.,() on the season, received stellar efforts from Gordy Ellmers and Steve Wood. Ellmers, a junior college transfer, broke the school standard in the triple jump by more 'than 6\. The senior hopped, stepped, and jumped to a 45'6\ win. Wood showed his versatility by winning the 220 {22.8), copping a second . in the 440 (50.5), and running two excellent legs on the victorious 440 and mile relay quartets. Tim McCabe, Rick Jaszczak, and Teus Mathias also earned laurels for the Garnet. McCabe flashed to an impressive 1:56.6 clocking in the 880, Jaszczak recorded ~ fine 49.4 quarter, and Mathias took the 100 in 10.3. The final victories were registered by Brad Patterson, Mike Rich, and Bill Clayton. Beside his finish behind . Ellmers in the triple Jump, Patterson won the long jump with a 2l'8W' leap. Rich garnered his accustomed first in the high jump (6'4\) while Clayton came out on top in his specialty; the pole vault, by· flo~;~.ting over at 13'. The Dutchmen will put their undefeated status on the line this Saturday, when they host Rochester in a 2:00 meet at Alexander Field.

The tying run scored ,on a bases- loaded walk to Mitchell .and the go-ahead run came in on an error by the third baseman. Union got an insurance rl)n in the eighth inning to make the finai score 8-6. Noteworthy for the Dutchmen were the seven stolen bases in tl'le game, the second consecutive game in which Union had seven thefts. · Today Union played at Siena in a game which should be a big ego boost.

Mr. Vaughn's presentation was sponsored by the International Relations Club. While Mr. Vaughn's topic was \Latin American Revolutionary Movements\ he spoke little about overt political revolutions,. saying that they may be something of · the past. He explained that Russia, Cuba, and . China have stopped giving funds and armaments in. support of armed revolts in Latin America. Most of Vaughn's speech was concerned with important changes that are taking place in Latin American politics. He mentioned four major changes of the past decade: civic action, nationalism, urbanization, and changing trade policies. Finally, Vaughn expJained how Latin American states .are turning away from North America for trading partners. They are buying military equipment from other nations, · possibly as a result of our telling them that they do not rate jet age equipment. Vaughn called this \typical US dealing with Latin nations.\ Describing American policy as \no image, low profile, and birth control\ Mr. Vaughn said that we c~mld do more and better if we wanted. The Alliance. for Progn;ss got Latin countries trading among themselves, but we refused · to get into it ourselves. He suggested that the United States be more of an open market for Latin Americd; that we lower our tariffs to them. Vaughn conceded that the Alliance did· accomplish a little; but stated that \we were unable to put in both feet and really do the job.\ .. Marxist Scholar Marcuse Praises nNew Sensibi.lity\ by PETER DICKERMAN Professor Berbert Marcuse, considered by many to be the mo'st distinguished living interpreter of Marx, told a convocation audience Friday night that a \new sensibility\ particularly prevalent among the young is striving to \emancipate itself' by working for \a peaceful and joyful u.nion.\ . In speaking before approximately 1,000 people in Memorial Chapel, Dr. Marcuse reaffirmed his belief that Marxism represents the \only adequate analysis of our society.\ However, Marcuse added that he was not about to \regurgitate\ old cliches to satisfy the faithful. Indeed, Marcuse seemed concerned throughout his talk with reinterpreting Marxism in terms of contemporary realities. At the outset, Marcuse noted that \Philosophy ... has centered on the concept of human f~eedo~,\ yet. there has been very ,little discusston of the desired nature of freedom. He emphasized that \there can be no freedom\ if life must be spent in the process of obtaining the . necessities of survival. In the past, according to the scholar, the presence of scarcity might have made true fr.eedom impossible to achieve, but such is no longer the case. Marc'ttse described a two-fold development in recent decades, one which he called \paradoxical;\ as technology has progre~sed through sta.ges of mcreasmg complexity, there has occurred simultaneously a growth of mechanisms of control and repression. Thus the modern paradox: the greater the movement toward personal self- determination, the greater the obstacles to freedom. After quoting Marx to the effect that it is at the apex of capitalist development that conditions will be set in motion which will destroy the capitalist system, Marcuse claimed that \Now. there seems to be a chance\ for the creation of \entirely new modes of life,., and for the breaking of the vicious cycle of domination by man over man. In explaining the reasons for his conditional optimism, Marcuse cited evidence of the gradual breakdown of capitalism, such as inflation, unemployment, and corporate bankrupcies. Referring to the failures of American society, Marc use also mentioned the successful resistance of national liberation fronts and the rise of socialist regimes in Latin America. For ten years, the military in Witin America has been engaged in ''civic action\ projects. The military has st~rted to .help build the roads and schools in many of these countries. This was the kind of program that Bobby Kennedy f~vored. Vaughn saw mixed effects from it however; he said that thls. program has allowed the military to gain more innuence in Latin American politics. Singles Obtained By Petition Only Housing Procedures Are Outlined According to Marcuse, the American power structure fully realizes the seriousness of the threat caused by capitalist collapse. The result, he said, has been intens-ified political repression, manifiested by the curtailment of civil liberties intelligence surveillance of citizens, usurption of power by the Executive, and the ••stifling of the campuses.\ Despite these count¢r-measures, claims Marcuse, this has been \a weakening of the moral fiber of this society,\ caused partially by a realization of the immorality necessary to maintain present conditions. Another major development in Latin America is growing nationalism. Some of the countries are experiencing this more than others, but it is a widely growing phenomenon. Mexico, for example, has a great deal of nationalism; it is very · important to them that they be independent .of the United States. Vaughn said that .nationalism caused a lot of problems in the Alliance for Progress. The most significant revolution in Latin Ame:rica today, according to Vaughn, is urbanization. Some of the major cities there are growing at a staggering tate. Some of their urban problems are similar to ours, with one major difference: they don't have the resources we have to solve thes~ problems.

Fortunately at this meeting there was a quorum and business was conducted in a valid meeting. The Senate used this meeting to amend the by-laws so that rather than have the stipulated 2/3 membership in attendance, there would be only 1/3 membership required for the regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings and a majority-i.e., half plus one-at special meetings called during the year. The Senate decided upon decentralized voting as the best means to facilitate the election on Wednesday and in the future. The new procedure hopes to result in the following three goals: 1. wide and large participation; a large turnout. 2. honest returns; a one man one vote system. 3. get results quickly; i.e., the same day as the voti~g. With this aim, ballots will be given to each senator who will be responsible for his living unit's voting. The next st.udent senate meeting will be on May 1-8 in Humanities 115. male:female ratio changes. Those who lose 'squatters rights in this < way will be allowed first choice of remaining rooms before the general lottery. . Independents living in fraternities in Davidson, Fox, Potter and Raymond Houses do not possess squatters rights. Any who wish to remain in their present places must apply.

Wine and crackers will be served after the discussion; and there is no charge for admission. Ben,.Moshe is an Israeli citizen and a resident of Jerusalem, who is in the United States on a one- year lecture tour on· Middle Eastern affairs. A member of the governing Israeli Labor Party, he is also an independent authority on the subject of the ' Middle East. As a member of the Jewish Brigade, Mr. Ben-Moshe fought in World War II in Italy and was later a · field-worker in the organization of immigration of Jewish refugees into Palestine, which was at that time, illegal. His account of those experiences is contained in his book The Path of the Jewish Brigade, published in 1955. Mr. Ben ... Moshe was the first mayor of the Israeli city of Elat in 1·951 and has also served as a free lance scientific translator. His discussion will be of particular interest to · students planning to- participate in Union's term abroad in Israel next winter. The talk is sponsored by Union's Hillel. Shortly before concluding, Marcuse warned his audience of the need to \distinguish between action and blind activism, \stating his opinion that revolutionary violence at present is futile.

The election was declared null and void by Election Commissioner Bill Ouzer after numerous irregularities were brought to his attention. Wednesday's balloting will be conducted by student .senators in their living units• Each senator will have ballots between the hours . of 7 and 11:30 p.m. All members of a living unit may vote with their. senators or a member of that living unit designated by the elections commission. Off campus residents may vote in the Student Activities office between the hours of 9 and 4:30 on Wednesday. Further instructions will be available from student senators Wednesday evening. All ballots must be returned to the Student Activities office no later than midnight on Wednesday.

Starting at the bottom, the S:wartz-K.rise-Coven reports on the May Day action in Washington appeared in the Concordy last Friday, and treated Union to some slightly biased. ''I know, I was there'; accounts on the Capital goings-on that dominated the issue. Once again we were subjected to the charge that the cops are all pigs and the kids are althogether. And reminded that Hitler is alive and well and living in Richard Nixon, the Gestapo runs the Justice Department, Facism is gripping the land; and the country's lone hope resides in the May Day tribesmen. Despite the lengthy protests -~f the three writers, and no one . doubts the feeling behind ~heir objectiQns, the consensus verdict on the whole May Day affair, by those correspondents who covered it, seems to ~e thai the cops soundly trounced the Tribe, achieving a brilliant tactical and political victory by keeping Washington from being shut down and holding human .and property damage at a minimti~, wlrlle dealing with thousands of demonstrators who op_enly planned unlawful and disorderly actions. Unlike the Veterans Against War and the 200;000 .marchers on April 24, who actively sought to influence the Congress to get the Indochina messoverwithatleast by the end of 1971, the May Day trick .. or-treaters were in Washington on decidedly negative terms. Thankfully, . their negative approach was blunted by the quick thinltins of P~C. police, and the country was spared a potential full scale riot, that would have solved nothing and probably nullified the painstaking labors of the anti-war movement, that doesn't want the government shut down just when they've finally got it moving .

Undef.eated Clnderme.n Best 'Jac~ttts, 85-60 · by MARK MINDEL Once again it was raining as the Garnet Cindermen upped their record to 5-0 on Saturday by defeating Rochester, 85:-60. Save last week's Middlebury-Williams meet, rain, wind, cold, and a muddy track have attempted in vain to abate the winning ways of Coach Ron Coleman's tracksters. It was the fieldmen who built the bulk of the advantage on Satmday, sweeping five of seven first places and molding a 42-21 advantage. Pacing the field event men was Mike Rich, who won the high jump, the javelin, and placed third in the discus. The versatile junior also ran in the hurdles. . . . Jeff Hirst, long jump; Gordy Ellmers, tnple Jump; and R1ch Thickens, shot put; also garnered top laurels. Meanwhile, the runners were exchanging victories with the -Yellow Jackets. Things looked good for Unioil when \Atlas'' Evans, Rochester's 15 point sprinter, didn't show, but the Garnet evened the handicap when star middle-distance sprinter Steve Wood pulled up lame in the 440 Relay. Union dropped that face but captured the mile relay, with Greg Hamlin, who replaced the injured Wood, joining AI Prysunka, Tim McCabe, and Rich Jaszczak in the winning effort. Individually, Harnlin turned in a very impressive 2:01 half-mile in the midst of a heavy downpour to lead a three-man sweep of the 880 event. McCabe, who took second to Hamlin (John Braham was third), captured the mile in 4:28:8 and Jaszczak won the quarter in 50.5. The onfy other Garnet victor was Ed Rossi, who turned in a 15.9 in the high hurdles. Bruce Mathias was just edged out for first in the hundred, timed in the same split (10.5) as the winner.

Cortland State, ranked in the Top 10 nationally, humiliate-d the Garnet stickers by that same score on S~turday, in a contest played in Cortland. The talented Staters, now 9-1 on the year, were simply too much for their overmatched adversaries, who have been having their troubles all season long anyway. Cortland jumped off to· a 5-1 lead after one period, owned a 13-1 bulge at the half, seven goals and adding an assist for an eight point output on the afternoon. Leading scorer Mark Sanderson, Barry Gross, and Steve Bauer each scored once for the Garnet. Dutchmen goalie Bob Erlandson may still be seeing lacrosse balls in his sleep after the Staters whistled 45 shots at his cage. Erlanson came up with 22 saves. The Garnet could manage only 19 shots on the Cortland netminder, Pete Roy. Union travels to Hamilton tomorrow for a game against the Red Raiders of Colgate. The, Garnet will be seeking to avenge last year's 9-6 Colgate win, and the chances for a victory appear, better than average as the Red Raiders in an off-season show1 only a 2-9 mark.

The loss was the sixth in a row for Coach Bruce Allison's disappointing Dutchmen, and lowered their already sagging record to an even more dismal 1- 6.

Voting in a special run-off election Wednesday evening 761 members of the student body elected Martin Shennan, '74, vice- president, giving him 408 votes and his opponent, Jack Overton, '73, 358. The special election was necessitated when an investigation into the circumstances of the first run-off revealed many irregularities. That election was very close and ballot stuffing took place to a large enough extent to render the verdict ambiguous and indecisive. William Ouzer, Election Committee chairman, and Dave Robbins acting _in concert with a quorumless student senate decided that two steps be taken. The first would be to codify and clarify the election procedure so that the opportunity for ballot stwfing would not exist, and, secondly, to hold the election again. Ouzer felt the main improvements contained in the tet>~\' · revisions were transfer of aut ___ ty from selected people in dorms and fraternities to the student senator and the fact that signatures were required from each voter, \These regulations, Ouzer mentioned, \reduced the class of potential ballot stuffers to dishonest student senators who double as master forgers who could keep the election from their constituencies.\ There was a wide turnout in Wednesday's election and Ouzer was contident that the new decentralized system had proven its effectiveness and should be made the permanent election machinery. According to Assistant Professor of History Helen Horowitz, the informal disclission will attempt to deal with some of the following questions: Do women have a special history? How have women been treated by historians? Coll·ege, March of. Di:mes Birth Defett Seminar Here What have been the effects of historical watersheds (e.g. world wars) on women!s lives?

Ben-Moshe, who became first Mayor of the Israeli city of Elat in 1951, said that the obvious turning point .in development of the Jewish state was the war- of independence in 1948, which resulted in the uprooting of the Arab society in Palestine, and the subsequent refugee problem. After these brief introductory remarks, Ben~Moshe went on t9 describe various economid, political and social aspects of Israeli society. He described Israel as having an \absotptive · Society,\ and asserted that ~ system of capitalism woulc!i simply not work. The primary reason for this would be tha~ Israel's many new immigrant~ would immediately be at • distinct economic disadvantag~, when compared \Yith the \established settlers.\ 1 Ben-Moshe, on a one-year speaking tour of this country which culminates next month!, conti~ue~ ?Y ~utlining the ~ocia,I order ex1stmg m Israel. While hh asserted that there is niJ) economic . or political discrimination against any of th~ minority groups, he described the hierarchy of social status which places the sabra, or native born Israeli on top, and members ot the Arab minority on the bottom. Immigrants fro; Eastern Europe, old and youn established settlers, Zionists, an· candidates for the Aliyah all fal~ in the middle of the spectrum. .I Ben-Moshe, spending mucli time discussing the Ara9 minority, said \At best, the limitations of the life of a national minority, are not ver~ pleasant,\ but that the Israeli government has done its best to \absorb\ the 300,000 Arabs who live in the country. One must remember, he said, that the stat~ of Israel is surrounded by one hundred million Arabs, and therefore Moslem Arabs are not accepted in the Israeli army, to avoid the possibility ·of having a war where they might have to fight against members of their awn families living in any of the surrounding Arab countries. Ben-Moshe emphasized that this is the only case of inequality between Arabs and other citizens of Israel; Arabs can vote in · national and local elections, and the Deputy Speaker of the Israeli Parliament is an Arab; Politically, Ben-Moshe stated that Israel is the only country in the Middle East with two legal Communist parties. Even Egypt and Syria, he said, have no legal Communist parties. Thus, the Israeli Arabs are not politically restricted in any legal or formal way. Speaking very briefly on the kibbutz, Ben-Moshe said that only about 3% of the population live and work on kibbutzim, but most urban Israelis have spent two or ihree years on a kibbutz. He emphasized, however, that \the social impact of the kibbutz life overshadows the numbers.\ After the June war of 1967, said Ben-M<>she, the walls which had separated the Arab and Jewish populations of the city of Jerusalem were torn down. He used this point, and the fact that many of the Israeli ·Arabs work in Jewish settlements, to illustrate that the problem of the integration and assimilation of the Arab population can be ultimately solved. Furthermore, he observed, \all parts of New York City should be · as safe as all parts of Jerusalem.\ Mr. Ben-Moshe was careful to assert that the Arabs are not as happy as they could be, but looking to the future, he e.xpressed the belief that really significant gains cannot be made in the area of integration until the pressing matter of the war can be solved.

The occupation of the Comput~r Center by a small group of black students is self--defeating in bad faith, and certainly counterproductive to · winning 1 sup.port from the college community. If the students involved had ~een less concerned with the the?tri~ of. a si.t-in and m?re c~n erned ~ith a.ctuaUy resolvi~g .. theu gnevances (real or tmagm d) the situatiOn would eastly have been avoided. There is no reason to doubt the administration letter's version ofJ.hat happened prior to the sit-. in. But even. if the feeling behlnd the actions of President Martin and Dean Malloy was :egative to the proJlosals, the fact that the blacks refused to w it twe more days to hear the administratien's counterproposa indicates that the b1acks wanted confrontation and not a r solution of grievances. The actual grievances are certa'nly open to discussion. But in any such discussion all students must realize that Union is a . temporary and changing; loose organization of many inrerest groups, and the immediate needs- bf a small group, according to the philosophy of the trustees as dictated by the current financial crisis; must sometimes be compromised to make sure of the continuance of the larger g~oup. In the present situation the dissident blacks must be aware that all housing space is at a premium and will be for some time; that the College .doesn't own the demanded properties and could only possibly obtain them; ·that. the student who is being hurt most by increased tuition may be the disadvantaged black forced to pay for travel and a small portion of his schooling expenses, but may also be the white, middle-class student who gets no scholarship help whatsoever. Once again the question seems ito be who is going to get how much from the even smal1er financial pie? We have repeatedly said that ~e future of Union looks dim unless programs and services are cut drastically, or new sources of revenue are tapped. While th¢ former will compromise the academic exceUence the school islno,ted fort a lack of the l~tter will price Union out of compeVition with state schools and schools able to increase scholarships. It appears that unless the government increases its outright support of schools such as Union in a short time tuition strikes and room rent strikes are inevitable and the very existence of sucq schools will be in doubt. However, while sitting-in has become almost a\' fad; it has never had a place here at Union. The administration has almost invariably gone along with (or initiated) so-called radical programs and rule liberalizations, Without the openness and initiation of the present administration there would probably have been no more blacks here than there 'were five years ago; nor would there be an Upward Bound program or an AOC. We hope that by the time this is read the 1 blacks have realized the illegitimacy of their actions and have v~cated the Computer Center without the College having gotten an injunction against them. We also. hope, however, that the administration has seen through the demands to the likely feelings of powerlessness (present in all students) compounded by alienation (felt by blacks in an almost strictly white organization) which may have motivated the demonstrators, at least partially, and has not done anything which would seriously disrupt the easing of any future confrontations. An additional series of actions by a group .of dissident blacks warrants comment: Refusing to allow a member of the WRUC executive board, available on the phone, to read an announcement before it was aired as is station poli:::y, a group of several students demanded that their list of demands be read over the air by the disc jockey there at the time. After accomplishing this they proceeded to threaten two WRUC news reporters with bodily harm unless they wrote stories sympathetic to the demands of the demonstrators. While these r.tudents may question the bias of the reporters,, they acted hastily to say the least. Such actions serve only to throw doubt upon the legitimacy of the demonstrators' demands and to alienate general student support for their cause. P.J.W.

Dead Flowers is almost in the style of Let it ~leed's Country Honk - people are beginning to dig country music, and the Stones are willing to demonstrate that they can do it at least as well as Poco can. Moonlight Mile .is, if anything, oriental i!l flavor, and was probably overproduced. Strings on a Rolling Stones record? Yes, ma'am ~ what else do you eJ~.pect on a plaintive love .song? It's the kind of song that always comes on the radio about 2:30 on a Sunday morning, after you've dropped her off at her house and you know that's the last time she'll ever be getting out of your car. <- Can't You Hear Me Knocking owes a big nod to Santana, with a latin gtlitar riff by Mick Taylor that proves once again how much he has it over Keith Richard as a guitarist. Richard's opening work, however, as an overlay to Jagger's vocal, is certainly the work of a professional. This might be the best song on the album; I just wish the ending weren't so tidy (in contrast · to Bitch's). · So where does Sticky Fingers lie in 1 the Stanes' pantheon of records? I'm afraid I'd have to put it maybe one-guarter notch below Let it Bleed. It is easily the most powerful studio album the Stones have done (Ya-Ya's being the most powerful record of all time ~ but live records don't count)> but it slightly lacks the diversity Qf Bleed.lt's ~· return. to~atd the roots of old- time rock-and-roll·, whil~\ at the same time acknowledging the new directions of plain rock.

In action last week the Garnet tied Hobart 1n a dual meet and · placed siXth in the nine team SUNY championships. Bob Gronauer and Paul Kabb were low for the week, each shooting 80 in the SUNY meet. Kabb and Gronauer were the only Garnet winners in the RPI match. Gronauer shot 78 as he beat his man two and one, while Kabb recorded a 79 to win his match one-up. The linksters played their only remaining match this afternoon, traveling west. to meet Oneonta. record this weekend to the second annual New England Rugby Union tournament.

Union drew a bye in first round action, but faces· an almost in- surmountable task in their second round game as the Garnet must play the winner of the Dart• mouth - Springfie1d College match.

The Ciarnet · serum, out- weighed as much as 50 }:iounds per man, was pushed around handily au afternoon long. However, good line play, especially by winger Paul M~tini and stocky serum half HoWie Goldberg, kept the Garnet in the game most of the way.

Any member of the student body is e1igible to run for the office, provided he makes his intentions known to the present Editor-in-Chief no later than Tb1Jl'Sday, May 20. Sit-In Ends, Will Talk To President' by JOE SCH;W ARTZ Richard Scammon, a noted election watcher and former director of the U.S. Census Buteau, gave the 1971 Brackett lecture last Wednesday. An election consultant for NBC .and \News'l'eek Scammon spoke 1 on the 1972 election since he said it's \easier to talk about one that's coming than one's ·that have passed. Scammon began his talk by saying that in 1972 approximately 8S million people will be :voting; five million of those between 18 and 21. He cited that the voters will be economically from the :middle class and have tittle more than a high school education. \.Politics\ is not their prime interest,\ Scammon reminded his audience, \and they are not waiting for candidate X to make his pronouncement on issue Y.\ Issue interest does increase around election time but he said that unless the Vietnam War is at a ~gper .levei than it is now there will be no \cutting issue\ as there was in '60, '64, and '68: religion, Goltlwater, and party disunity respectively. He believes that . domestic . issues will play the most important role in the upcoming election. He cites as a , precedent for this, the fact that Wallace, the racist, ran in '68, while McCarthy, the dove, didn't. The issues will probably center around economics and welfare, the social issue, and the influe.o.ce of the candidates on the election. Scammon went on to say that the problem for the Democrats next year Will be whether ot not they can hold on to the interest groups that have voted them into office in the past. He said that he was not so certain that the loss of the South was permanent and that with some moderate candidates it may well r4turn to the Democratic fold. , Talking briefly about Wallace and a fourth party possibility, he said that Wallace would like to run but that no one is certain what he will do at this stage. If he does run he may . just concentrate on the South and find himself more of a force if t)lere is no decisive victory. As to a fourth party, Scammon said tpat it is highly unlikely because it would most likely assure re- election of Nixon. But, 1 as he concluded his formal lecture he said that the situation is still \indecisive confused, andmurky.\ During the question and answer period Scammon said that no one can tell whether Muskie has or has not reached his peak of popularity. He pointed· out that Nixon held a lead for more than a year going into the convention, as did Robert 'Kennedy. At this point Muskie may have reached his peak, or may have just locked on and will keep on going. Scammon was also uncertain as to whether Nixon would drop Agnew, althaugh he was certain that the replacement would not be John Lindsay. He also said that if Agnew were dropped, it would be in favor for some moderate Southern Democrat such as Johi} Connally. Seeing Lincoln's success in ~hoosing \ '\ ... J·~ Andrew Johnson in 1864, Nixon might do this if he felt himself loosing. But, Scammon warned that dumping a V .P. is not common, but when it is done its purpose is to increase party support, not to .please those people who would not vote anyway. Eligibility to vote in the election is restricted to those listed in the ~asthead in the issue of CONCORDY which appeared last Friday. The composition of that masthead was determined by a meeting of the Senior Board. As ·concotdiensis went to press late this morning, a group of three students representing those who had occupied the Administration Building all day yesterday were in conference with President Martin. Finally, when a~ked what -advice he would suggest for Nix.on if he found himself in a race facing Muslde and Wallace, Scammon suggested ,that Nixon \light a candle.\ The ne-wly elected Editor will serve for two terms, begjmling. nextfslk · •· ln-S,e,rvice Training Will Benefit Guidance An in-service training program for 24 area secondary school guidance counselors is being conducted this spring at the College. The three month progra.Dl, under the direction of members of the Union psychology department and counseling staff, is being underwritten by a grant from the New York State Education Department Bureau of Guidance through the Capital District Personnel and Guidance Association. The training sessions are aimed at increasing counseting effectiveness in schools by emphasizing person to person co.ntact and empathy training. The three hour weekly sessions are divided in half and for research purposes, the total group is divided into two sections. During the first half of each meeting, one sub-group is involved in a lecture and discussion on major systems of psychotherapy and their application. The other half works with members of the program staff on a series of self awareness exercises. . The second part for both groups is a workshop with participa~ts gaining experience by .actually becoming involved in the counseling process, both as the one seeking help and the one giving aid. The goal of the program is to foc1,1s counseling attention beyond specific problems to a -recognition of the feelings behind the particular concern and then be able to work with the client to the point where he is able to work out his own solutions. Lawrence J. Weitz, instructor of psychology and' acting director of the Union ~ounseling cel\ter, is director of the pro.gram. Working with Dr. Weitz are Frank M. Calabria, associate professor of psychology and Mrs. Miriam M. Conable, assistant professor of psychology and counselor to students. Also working with the program are Frederick Selfridge and Robert Mathews, doctoral candidates in counseling at SUNY-Albany, who are interns at the Union counseling center. The in-service training program is being coordinated by Joseph E. Purcell, preside~t of the Capital District Personnel and Guidance Association while Joseph A Steger,, associate pro- fessor of psychology at SUNY- Albany. is workshop consultant. New Idol To -Appear Soon· Boasts of Library. Interest The Idol, the college's literary magazine, recently received a letter from Mr. Joseph T. Rankin, chief of the Art and Architecture Division of The New York Public Library, expressing his interest in the essay on ·Constantin :Brancusi which appeared in the winter issue df the Idol. The essay was published for the first time· as part of a collection of writings by Jeanne Robert Foster. Mrs. Foster held an honorary degree from Union College. ller papers are owned by Professor William M. Murphy of the English department. Mr. Rankin went· on to say that the New York Library owns John Quinn's original. p:~:pers transcribed by Mrs. Foster. John Quinn was an authority on Modern Irish Literature and drama.Among his papers is a letter from Constantin Brancusi with what may be the first recorded sketch for one of his works. lnterest in the last issue of the Idol bas been voiced by the Schenectady community. Several letters have come in from area residents and the \Jeanne Robert Foster\ article was reviewed recently by the Schenectady Gazette. the next issue of the Idol, which will be available at the end of the spring term, will feature journal selections and a new short story by Les Petrovics, who won the 1971 Yudis Award for creative writing. The Journal includes Petrovics' impressions of Hungary upon his return last summer. The issue also includes an article on music at Union written by five students and Professors Edgar Curtis and Hugh Allen Wilson. An original score by Chuck Fisher completes the series of essays. The John Updike interview will also be available during the last week of'the term. The issue will include some of Updike's early ''Harvard Lampoon\ cartoons. Copies of both issties will be available in dorm units, at Schaffer Lib,rary, and at Student Activities. t:·~;-; '~ ~:;' ~~;;!, : ,, At approximately 10:45 p.m. last night, Mr. John Kleinkauf, Director of Campus Security and Safety, presented the students in the buildingwithastatement from Harold C. Martin, College President. In that statement, Martin offered to ,f ••• meet with three persons representing your group in my office at ten o'clock tomorrow morning (fuesday) provided that your entire group leaves the Administration Building now and leaves it without having in any way disturbed or damaged the contents or building.\ Shortly thereafter, the following statement was released · by those inside the building: \We have decided to leave the building at this time because we are hoping that President Martin is sincere in his wanting tq negotiate honestly with us ... \ The decision by the approximately fifteen students inside the building culminated ii,J. a sit-in which begarr yesterday morning. For the most part, the entire episode was without incident. However, shortly after 3 p.m. yesterday afternoon, calvin G. Schmidt, Registrar, approached the building carrying several envelopes of preregistration material: He was confronted at the door by one student who; after a lengthy discussion, allowed him to enter the vestibule. A second student met Mr. Schmidt at the second door, and the text of the conversation which ensued was learned through a telephone convef:Sation with Mr. Schmidt this morning. He described his discussion with that student as being \polite and he explain~d that he told the student of his intentions to carry on Registrar's business in the Administration Building, so that students could pick up their preregistration forms. The representative of the group replied that Schmidt was welcome to come into the building, but 1added that it \won't be easy to ~onduct business in here, and you really shouldn't come in bedmse there 1 won't be normal business going on.\ At that point, said Schmidt, he turned around, and left ~he building, with the only response from those inside being a round of applause. The demands of the students who had occupied the building were released in a statement late yesterday afternoon. The first three demands were identical to those of the group of Black students who occupied the Computer Center last week, and a fourth demand called for an errtir·e reappraisal and examination of the budget by the general college community. With regard to the rally held yesterday morning in Library Plaza, R. Gordon Bingham, Assistant to the President, told a member of the Concordiensis staff last night that the charge that Blacks have been seeking a cultural center for two years is \simply false.\ He went on to refute a seco!ld statement made by Don Jones who spoke at the rally, by saying that the College never stated formally or othe!Wise that amnesty would be granted to the black students.

Probl'm four! is, in many ways, the most seriot~s problem of a.ll; Any way you cut it; the Board of Trustees rules Union College. Not ru~ it, mind you - they could, but they :lac;:k the inclination or interest - but rules it. Put si111ply, the Trustees can do whatever they damn well please with the place, possibly short of blowing it up. And, one must admit, they do have 'a large responsibility - they are the men · who ·are called ·to account if the college goes out of busiJless (a situation which is· not completely ' unlikely for a small private college these days)~ However, the fact that the Trustees seem to regard Union solely as a business to be kept in the black (or as close to it as possible) .is obscene.· To an even greater degree than the Administration, the Trustees are men who ·have grown old · behind corporate walls. They either are or have been executives of large, rich; exploitative corporations and they are neither used to nor enjoy having their words questioned~ At his meeting with what few Trustees could be assembled (did I say anything about concern earlier?) this past Friday, President Martin outlined a propQsal wherein. Beta Theta Pi would vacate its present facilities. in Davidson, allowing the black students to use it as , t~eir living and cultural center, i and move B.eta into Hoadly : House. President Martin, the bla<:ks, and Beta were all : IUnenable to this proposition. The Board of Trustees were not, saying they would not bargain under c!)ercion.

By making that statement, you're assuming that we (the Black students) should have faith in something or someone other than ourselves. Members of the Alliance had put some faith in the administration before the sit-in, only to be accused of lying while negotiations were taking place. Why is there \ ... no reason to doubt the administration letter's version of what happened prior to the sit-in'!\ According to that letter, we were informed that 1247 and the other fraternity house were not owned by the college. That's not so. Members of the Alliance who had met with the administration beforehand, were explicity told that 1247 and the other fraternity house are owned by the college. If this falsehood had :not been presented to us, the sit-in would never have taken place at all. It is a gross assumption on your part to say that we wanted a confrontation from the start, and · that we were not willing to wait to have our grievances resolved. We have been working for more than a month to get the right!! to a Black House. We have had meetings with people directly uncler the President discussing our desires and the possibilities 1 of achieving them. We put faith in these people. They gave us facts that were erroneous. They made agreements that were totally insincere. Then, they accused us of lying. What do you propose we should have done? Waited for two days? What would that have gotten us besi9.es more falsehoods? When you state that, \ ... the immediate needs of a small group.. must sometimes be .compromised to make sure of the continuance of the larger group,\ I take it that you mean we should compromise our Black man-hood and Black woman-hood for the white community of this college.

And it cannot persist this way. But as long .. S\8 the larger group thinks as you do, this human degradation Will continue. You seem to imply that the college is doing Blacks a favor by giving us scholarships, having Upward Bound, and AO.C. It is by no means doing us a favor.

Smith * * * * . May 16,1971 Letter to the CoUege Co~r~munity: As .are many people on this campus, I am very concerned about the recent happenings at Union. I am also very confused by them. My first reaction when I heard of the Computer Center takeover was one of disbelief. 1his is happening at Union?? After I saw the list of demands I got very upset at the obvious attempt - as I saw it - by the blacks to segregate themselves. · Their demand for scholarship increases also infuriated me because they seemed to be claiming for themselves something which concern$ about 40% of the school as a whole. Gradually, as more information came out, I became more sympathetic to the cause of the Black Alliance, but although I could sympathize with their wish for a black culture center ~ dorm, I still could no. t cond~me their wish to intention~lly segregate and isolate tqemsel'ves from the rest of the college. Since then, there have bl!en meetings, accusation~, small lj>its of mudslinging, stories of thrf1ats of physical violence, fact sheets distributed, rumors started; in short, everything that' goes ~ith the fight for a cause. \I;he result is a clouding of issues and general confusion. Now, under threat of an injunction, the Black Alliance has left the Computer Center, and no settlement has yet been reached. Confusion is still the word of the day. · This afternoon, a leaflet beginning with the words, \The bureaucratic administration\ was distributed. It turned' me, and many others, completely off. It has nothing at all to do with whether or not I 1 think the administration is bureaucratic, whether the blacks are right, ,or whether anyQne is unreasonable. Perhaps I'm stin merely a flaming idea~st, but I po not see how it is to anyone's advanatage to call the admihistration \bureaucratic \equivocating \not interested in serving the needs of the studeb.ts,\ · and several other choice• phrases. Antagonization is not thei key to settlement. The only' way an agreeable decision can be reached is by openness, honesty, and sympathy with the other's problems. This means honesty of the administration to the students, and communication and understandi~g among the administrators themselves, and among the students themselves. Without approaching a settlement with :sympathy instead of hostility, any decisions made will be accepted grudgingly. This holds true in any situation, not on.ly in this particular one. Union College, jind all the individual pomponents of it, have got to get together honestly and with understanding. I sincerely hope we're capable of it. I Hopefully, Susanna R. Navias. Class of'74 An open letter to the Union CoUege Administration: D11ting the past three years of our stay at Unio~• we. as representatives of the Cherokee Indians on campus, have continually sought to attain housing for use as an indian cultural center. Although the college has assured us that the matter is being looked into, and has admitted a definite need for some suitable facility, no action has been taken on our non- negotiable demands. We feel that the administration is deliberately dragging its feet in this matter, and, as a significant portion of the college community, we feel that some alternate response has become necessary. In .response to the inexcus~>ble action on the part of the college administration, we are ready to begin our counter-action. At 4: I 5 tomorrow morning we plan to occUpy fourth floor South, and will not move until the following demands are met: I. designation of Fox house as an indian cultural center; relocating its present occupant~ and building a Sun roof for weekly rain dances and Sun worshipping. 2. Significant increases in all scholarships. (we feel that money is being squandered on upkeep of the school and the athletic program) 3. Amnesty for all participants in this demonstration. 4. Squaws to be bussed in from neighboring communities. We wish everyone to understand that merely because people of other races will not be allowed in the new cultural center, we do not wish their alienation. We merely. wish a,place where the six of us can live and work without being disturbed by all those other kinds of people. We feel that our demands are relatively modest and that ihey can be easily met by the school.

Communication In this, the aftermath of the occupation of the Computer Center and the Administration Building, one cannot help but notice the vacuum on campus resulting from the cessation of mimeographia from the ~dministration as well as from the student groups. While it is probably beyond the shadow of a doubt that the group who sat-in all day Monday and those who did the same for three days last week have n~t rested their respective causes, it is disheartening that they have stilled their pens. As an example, most members of the college community know that a group of three students met with the President last Tuesday, but 'few know who they were or what .were the results of the meetimg. The point here, however, is not to give an account of that meeting, but to comment on the use and abuse of the communication medium, especially in times of campus crisis. Throughout the week ending last Monday, statements from the various student groups were, although hastily prepared, numerous _and sometimes informative and apparently indicative of a desire to keep the student body informed of all latest developments. However, once the activities changed from sit-in to discussion, the announcements stopped. One cannot help but wonder, then, if the statements were really intended to laud the heroics of those who issued them, rather than to serve as an effective campus news medium. Would it be ridiculous to assume that either the administration or the student group (or both) might .have something worthwhile to say after Tuesday morning's meeting? As said many times before by numerous observers, effective communication is essential, especially at a time when an unfounded rumor is capable of provoking either side to some unwarranted action. Furthermore, at a school of this · size, effective communication should, at least, be a relative~y easy job. In fact all that would be needed to implement such a system of communication to supplement the established campus news media is an honest desire on the part of all campus groups to publicize some \hard facts\ and conscientiously work against the propagation of ambiguity and \distorted truths\. It is important to recognize the value and the power of all forms of communication, and realize that they are best suited to the mutual benefit of all factions, and to not abuse by the opportunistic desires of some. Finally, there has been a sudden and overwhelming concern for communication with the Hoard of Trustees. Granted, this is\ a point well taken. But perhaps, our energies should first be directed to communicating with each other as students, as well as with other immediate members of the . college community; before we become concerned with a group supposedly as far removed physically and ideologically from the students as the Board ofT rustees.

Bingham noted that Captains l'lectetll Union's varsity tennis squad elected its captains for the- 1971- 1972 season last week. Next year's co-captains are Jim Skiff, a sophomore from Plainview, L.I., who was a co-.captain this past season, and Marty Cukierman, a freshman from Montreal, Quebec. The experience frotn this past season should definitely make Union a tougher squad next spring. The pminise shown by Cukierman and several of the other varsity members, and the marked improvement of co- captain Jim Skiff, could bring Union its first winning season in almost a decade. · Faculty Continued Continued from Page 1 discussions are Jikely, to take place on- camp:us when·· the l;ruste~s arrive here for 'Commencement, although substantive meetings may not take.place prior to that time. • me.

All are invited at no charge, but Gail asks that everyone who comes brings a candle. · Gail, nee Dena Abigail Wood, is the wife of Carl George, associate professor of biolegy, and unlike many faculty wives, Gail has not been content to leave the classroom to her husband. She has, rather, become as much a part of the campus as any professor, despite the fact that she has been listed as an official member of the faculty for only one academic term in 1969. She taught a course in philosophy during that term, but her interests have been equally divided between that and dancing since her graduation from college in 1955. \Spring Movements\ is the result of her work with Union students and a number of interested outsiders over the past two years. The show will include eight numbers, of which three will be the direct outgrowth of the classes; one will feature Union students who have worked independently; three will feature Amy Darley, formerly of Schenectady, now a dancer in New York City; and one will feature Gail and two colleagues from the Schenectady area. Student's from Gail's classes will be featured in \Japanese Bach\ Dave Brubeck's \Bluette and the last number of the evening, ironically entitled \Union.\ \Union says Gail, \is about people fighting the polarities of individualism versus partici~ pation. We came up with the name of the dance first and then realized how appropriate it was for this to be performed at Union College.\ A group ot three Union students will perform one number which tliey have developed on their own. One (Mark Palmer} will recite his original poetry while another (Dave Herzfeld) will play the drums and a third (Steven Cole) will dance. \The relationship between the three is symbiotic,\ according to Gail. \One will not be interpreting the poetry of the other; rather, they will all be interpreting on their own. Miss Darley will perform two solos as well as a duet with Steven Cole. Gail herself will perform \Three From the Hill,\ based on Edgar Lee Master's \Spoon River Anthology,\ along with local dancers Pat Castelli and Professor Carl George and the students who studied the possibility of a sea level canal in Panama will hold a lecture and discussion on the subject tonight at 7:30 in the Hale House Student Lounge.

Union and HVCC Sign Science Pact An agreement establishing formal affiliation in the sciences and engineering has been announced by Hudson Valley Community College of Troy and Union College. Hudson Valley President James J. Fitzgibbons and tJnion President Harold C. Martin signed the document that links the two colleges in a joint venture in science and engineering education. Also signing the agreement were Joseph F. Marcelli, Dean of the science division at Hudson Valley and James D. Palmer, Dean of the center for science and engineering at Union. Witnessing the ceremony were George C. Baker, chairman of the departments of mathematics and scienc~ and engineering and science at the community college and Gardner M. Ketchum, professor and chairman of the mechanical engineering department at Union. Speaking for Hudson Valley, Dean Marcelli indicated that the affiliation will assist the community college in attracting qualified students and developing programs in the sciences and engineering. Dean Palmer noted that the agreement will help promote the recruitment of qualified two year college graduates into the science and engineering division at Union. Also, he added, it gives further recognition to the community college-university combined program as an alternative route to a full four year college degree. Phi Beta Kappa Elects Members Twenty six seniors and one junior have been elected to Phi Beta Kappa at Union. All juniors and seniors who are bachelor of arts or general bachelor· of · science students are eligible for election to Phi Beta Kappa, long recognized as one of the highest academic distinctions that can be earned by college undergraduates. The Phi Beta Kappa Society was founded at the College of William and Mary in 1776 and the chapter at Union, first in New York State, was established in 1817. Election to the society is based on scholarship and character. The sole junior elected this year is Robert W. Levis, a biology major from Rochester, New York. Seniors named Phi Beta Kappa were: STANLEY SHAPIRO, an English major EUGENE A. TERE.A Y JR., a science major. BENNETT M. LIEBMAN, A political science major HENRY G. FEIN a chemistry major WILLIAM C.

Rick Jaszczak competed in the 440-yard run, garnering only fifth place with lit sluggish 49.6 clocking. Jaszczak's tired legs, both bothered by past hamstring pulls; hampered his performance. Tim McCabe, the diminuitive redheaded speedster, finished fourth in the half-mile with a remarkabJ~ 1:54.4 timin.g. McCabe's clocking, however, was not fast enough to qualify him for the Nationals.
