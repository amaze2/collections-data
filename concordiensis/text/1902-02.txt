Lectures were suspended on Thutsday tnotn- ing Jan. 28, and the student-body assetnbled in the senior roon1 at 9 A. M. Dean Fiero, in a few well-chosen words, lJriefly outlined the purpose of the meeting and introduced Ersldne C. Rogers, president of the class of 1902, as chainnan of the assembly. Mr. ltoget·s, in his usual clean-cut, earnest n1anner, spoke of Williarn McKinley's inti mate connec- tion with the Albany Law School as a tnember of the class of 1867, and of the consequent particular reason why the school should observe his birthday with appropriate ceremony. He then introduced Hon. Danforth E. Ains- worth, Deputy State Superintendent of Public Instruction, and a n1ember of the Board of Tn1stees of the School. Mr. Ainsworth de- livered a brilliant oration, sketching the life and death of our lamented Chief Magistrate in a masterly 1nanner, \Without taint on his name, an honest man, a simple Christian, he died uni- versally latnented.\ Junge Albert C. Tennant of the faculty was the next speaker and took for his topic \Anarchy.\ He furnished many valuable sug- gestions in the eradication of the evil-which he characterized as \ our great National evil.\ His remarks were~ roundly applauded. George S. Holcombe, 1902, spoke on \William McKinley as a Politician,\ and Azro L. Blake, 1902, a veteran of the Civil War, on \Willhun McKinley as a Soldier.\ Both were well received. Richard J. Drumtnond, 1903, spoke of the lessons to be drawn from McKinley's death, and demonstrated fully to the school that the junior class is not lacking in oratorical material. Taken all in all, the program was a most excellent one, and greater credit is due the pro- moters of the commemoration because of the fact that it was the suggestion of the senior class, managed by them, and protnpted not at all by the Faculty, thongh the latter gave aid most cheerfully. PQOMISING BASEBALL SEASON. The Schedule as It Stands at Present. Judgingfronl indications Union will be repre- sented on the diamond this season by the strong- est nine it has had for some years. There is an unusual large number ot candidates for the different positions on the team. It remains for those who have declared their intentions of try- ing for a position on the teatn to cotne out and practice every day. Practice will begin in the ''gym \ on February ro. It will be impossible to round out a good tean1 without the hearty support of the student body. Manager Bloch and George W. Donnan, the assistant n1anager have been hard at work during the past few weeks ar- ranging the baseball schedule for the season of 1902. While the number of games must neces- sarily be limjted, yet an average of two gatnes per week has been reached. The following are the candidates for the various positions on the team : Catchers, Gris- wold, ~03, Bradley, '04; pitchers, N. Devoe, Law, Mallery, 'oz, O'Brien, Law, and Mahar, 'o4; first base, Paige, Law, and Reece, Medical ; second base, Burke, Phannacy, M. Devoe, Law, Reece, Medical, Staeber, 'o3, and Whipple, 'o5; third base, Grout, 'oz, Bunting, 'o3, Bradley, 'o4, M. Devoe, Law ; short stop, Burke, Phar- macy, and Mahar, 'o4; fielders, Mallery, 'oz, Devoe, Law, Flynn, Law, Staeber, 'o3, and Heath, '04. The following schedule of gatnes has been arranged for the cotning season : April rz, West Point at West Point. April I 7' Schenectady State League team at Schenectady. . .

THE SCOTCH PEOPLE. .Frederick W. Cameron, '81, Before the Albany Burns Club. President Frederick W. Cameron, Union '81, of the Albany Burns Club, delivered a lecture on ''The Scotch\ at a banquet Saturday night, January 25. His remarks were in part as follows: Shortly aft~r the one hundredth anniversary of the death of Robert Burns I visited his tomb in the City of Dumfries, and was surprised to find a multitudinous collection of wreaths and floral tributes, coming from all parts of the civilized world. I say surprised, because it seems to be an unusualthingto find such universal expressi .. ns of esteem and sytnpathy for the modest, plow- boy poet. When I went to Ayr, I found that a greater number of people visit the \Little Clay Biggan\ of Robert Burns than Stratford and Abbottsford. Tbe register also proves that these visitors come from every known quarter of the globe. If the scenery was particularly romantic, or the historical associations of the Burns ·country re- markable, it would not seem strange that .so many come such great distances to visit this little, insignificant town and the ''But and Ben\ at Alloway. One searches in vain the writings of Burns for magni:ficant descriptions of scenery ; of great events, or soul-stirring narratives. We know why we visit the Trossachs, ·peopled with the characters created and n1ade famous by the magic pen of Scott ; for there we have the scene of legendary lore coupled with the grandeur and picturesqueness of hill and vale, mountain lake and blootning heather, diversified conveyances by land and water-in fact, a channing place, regardless of his tory or poetry. We know why we visit Stratford, the birth- place and resting place of the greatest dramatist the world ever produced, for there we have beautiful scenery, a famous castle, and historical associations of the most interesting character. But why do we go to Ayr, unpretentious, out of the way, devoid of natural beauties, altnost unmentioned in history? The poems of Burns would apply equally well to any other part of Scotland-! might truth- fully say, any other part of the world. The local setting is not arbitrary. The real senti- ment, the underlying thought, appeals to the in- habitants of Africa as it does to those of Scot- land. We recall that at the siege of Lock now the famished, weary force, when they heard in the far distance the first notes of the pi pes signalling the long-delayed reinforcements, \Though each heart breathed another name they all sang 'Annie Laurie,'\ so might we say though each heart breathes another name we each love \Highland Mary.\ The fan1ous \ Cotter's Saturday N 1ght\ depicts the family gathering, typical of Scotland to be sure, but appealing to the heart of every man wherever his place of residence. Burns addresses himself to the sympathy and love, the divine part of man, whatever his home, environment, or language. But is there not another, a stronger tie than sympathy and love for a few verses, that draws.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 7 us frorn aH parts of the world to Ayrsl\'l<ire? Let us consider this matter a motnent. Scotch -characteristics are marked and pecu- liar. T.bey can be traced through many~ mHny generations. Where you find these peculiarities you wiH nnd, upon investigation, that the sub- ject is a sure-enough Scotchman, For instance- stubbornness, indon1ita ble industry, determina- tion, simplicity, and loyalty. I have found in tnany countries the character- istics of the Scotch displaying themselves in men with. peculiar and foreign names. In Hol- land I saw the n, onument erected to the memory of men who, for eighty long years, ~~ithstood a siege, and that against the tnost powerftd nation then on <the face of the ea1·th. I read the answer made to the detnand for surrender, \While we have one leg to stand on, one arm to wield a sword, we never will submit to disgrace of sur- render.'; Does not the fortitude, resistance and brave1·y of these men prove them to be of Scotch origin? Those n1en who, with strong dykes, have tnade a country lower than tl1e level of the sea, the garden spot of the world, must be brothers of those who tnade Glasgow, over 100 miles from the ocean, but with a narrow creek flowing thereto, a seaport town, and established there the most successful ship build- ing yards in the world. Other ,evidences, to wit, their love for spirits might be produced to show that Holland, peopled as commonly understood by the Dutch, is an out-and-out Scotch society. In GeTrnany we find the loyalty, precjsion, unquestioned integrity of the Scotch together with the -stoicism characteristics of that nothern race. The Etnperor, so cock-sure that what- ever he does is ordered by God, displays the true Scotch idea of the infallibility of each in- dividual. The Germans are in fact Scotch. We co1ne to France. We do not forget the love France had for Scotland, exhibited in her af7aire de cour with the beautiful Mary. They have a proverb in France, ''As fierce as a Scotclnnan.\ Together the French and Scotch soldiers bave been in many a battle, and a very cursory e:xamination shows that the dash for which the FTench are fan\'lous is typical of the impetuosity peculiar to the Scotch. When we go further south we com,e to sunny Italy, and thet·e we find the Scotch displayed in every walk of life. It requires no argument be- fore this organization to show that the Italians are in fact Scotchmen, for have we not here one of the most indefatigable \'rorke1·s in everything pertaining to Scotland a so-called Italian by the name of Montignani? Marconi, who has lately astonished the word by transtnitting messages across the ocean without the use of any material other than that supplied by nature, showed most conclusively his orig:in when he chose for the first character sent flying through tbe air on its voyage of 3,000 miles the initial letter of Scot- land, repeating this letter at intervals of forty- five seconds for eight hours, evidently for the purpose of impressing the world with the fact that Scotland was his hotne and all the world his brothe1·s. That language has nothing to do with deter- tnining the question of origin goes without say- ing, We, none of us, cantalk the language of our forefathers of a few generations back. My good friend, Dr. Gillies, was born in Glasgow, but from his speech he might have been born in New York. Blood, we are told, is one of the strongest ties that bind together men1bers of the same fatnily, and yet sentiment is stronger than blood. This sentimen , shown in the love we bear so universally, in all languages and under all flags, to the typical Scotch poet, Burns, is the natural result of cot11mon ancestry, and is the con vi ncirig evidenee thereof. Let us join heartily in the cele ln·ation of our beloved poet's birthday, rejoicing in the fact that we all are true, loyal, jolly Scotchrnen. SOUTHE~N CLUB.

. I 'ritE CONCORDI:ENSIS. EULOGY OF McKINLEY. ~Charles Emory Smith's Speech. '\:'he annual banquet of the New York Board of Trade and Transportation was held W ednes- day evening, January 29, in the grand ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria hotel. The function this year had a double object in view; first, to do honor to the mem.ory of William McKinley who was a Law School man, and secondly, to en- courage unity of capital and labor. Among the guests was a former member of President McKinley's cabinet, Charles Emory Stnith, '61, ex-postmaster-general; then there were Senator llanna, Colonel Myron T. Her- rick, Charles A. Moore, all close personal friend of Mr. Mcl(inley. Oscar S. Straus, president of the Board of Trade and Transpor- tation, was chairn1an. The first toast was \The President of the United States,\ drunk standing and in silence. ''William MciCinley and His Policies\ was the first toast to be responded to, and former Post- master-General Charles Emory Smith, Union '61, was the speaker. Mr. Smith in the course of his speech, which was a tribute to the late President McKinley, said: \ He was called to great deeds and he rose to the full height of opportunity. He ruled in one of the three distinctive epochs in the develop- ment of the republic, and he dominated his era as Washington and Lincoln dominated theirs. If we believ.e that a divine hand picked and fitted them for their great work in the evolution of the Atnerican Union, the guidance of an overruling providence is no less plainly stamped on the life and the 1nission of William McKinley. First of all a man of the people, and pre- eminent in understanding their temper, he was the incarnate and refined genius of the popular will. No less a leader of leaders, he was equally stalwart in swaying the counsels and shaping the action of political chieftains. l-Ie moved amid 111ighty events in a creative and convulsive period, and he left his deep and beneficent in1- prints on the nation's history and the world's progress . \ His whole life was a glowing epoch fron1 the hour he went forth as a loyal lad to fight for his country's flag to the splendid cHmax, when he stood erect the greatest of living rulers and the most conspicious figure in the later drama of the world's development. He wa_s the recog- nized leader in the Atnerican policy o-f building up national tnaterial independence and power, and then when that policy had reached its frui- tion and triurnph, and had equipped the nation for the outward advance, he was equally the leader in guiding it along the new pathways of expansive greatness and glory. He stood at the helm during the most stormy and stressful times since Lincoln was the pilot, and he suc- cessfully steered the ship of state through the shoals and narrows of national provincialism and isolation out into the clear, broad, open sea of the world's highway, and of the world's fel- lowship, with his eye ever on the compass of justice and its needle ever pointing to the polar star of liberty and hurnanity.\ Of the late policies of President McKinley, Mr. Smith said: ~' President .l\1cKinley rounded his great creative work in proposing reciprocity with the commercial nations and in standing before all the world for the integrity of China and the open door to her great trade of the future. From his sacred tomb, hallowed with a nation's love, comes today his authoritative voice for generous reciprocity ·with Cuba, and in urging this measure of justice and humanity to our accepted ward among the fair sisters of the Antilles, President Roosevelt is not only acting out his own chvialrous impulse, bpt faithfully honoring the heritage left by his noble pre- decessor.\ NOTE. In the Literary Review of the New York Times of Saturday, February r, there is a list of gifts during the year 1901 for educational pur- poses. In the list there is mentioned the gift ot Dr. Horace B. Silliman, '46,ofanewcollege Y. M. C. A. building to Union College, costing $so,ooo.

TRE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 EDUCATION HERE AND ABQOAD. Dr. Edward Dwight Eaton, formerly Presi- dent of Beloit College, who has been spending a year abroad, has been making a careful study of the great German universities. As a result of this study he declares that higher education in the United States is improving much more rapidly than in Gennany. The strength of the German systetn of education is its developmen · of special study and investigation. Germany, indeed, is preeminently the land of specialists with w hotn r~search has become .an end in it- self ratl1er than a means to sot~e practiLal re- sult. That this devotion to specialism has added immensely to the sun1 of knowledge can not be denied. But, valuable and necessary as specialism in education is, it is not without its dangers. It tends to make education an ab- stract thing, ahnost cotnpletely divorced from life, and to be pursued first of all for the thrill of subjective joy that it gives to the student who becomes a member of the esoteric band of illutninati, far removed from the common herd. While paying full tribute to the German uni- versities, Dr~ Eaton does not concede their superiority to American universities in all things. His view on this questio:1 is so contrary to the traditional view that it is worth quoting : \Her great professors, whether surgeons, chetnists, theologians, philosophers or historians, have still to learn the art of translating for the student mind the wealth of wisdom with which they themselves are supplied. The German professor lacks the personal magnetism and power to attract his students which is so char- acteristic of the American college professor. \Judging frotn the experiences related to me by certain Americans who are engaged in post- graduate work in Betlin, advanced education, which so long has been the bulwark of the Ger- tnan universities, fails to approach at the present day the sin1ilar work that is available at Har- vard. This affords eloquent testimony that the time is coming when the cause of n1ost Ameri- can students coming abroad will be retnoved. \In physical equipn1ent the German institu- tions are far behind what we k~ow at hotne. Leipsic .alone of all the great schools has a modernized plant. The other universities have been content with indifferent extensions of theit· libraries and laboratodes. Student life here also travels on uncornpron1isingly tradi- tional lines. An American is gratified to ob- serve, however, that the se1·iousness of pur- pose, l'ack of vvhich Enropeans are prone to charge against us on account of our excessive indulgence in detracting influences like athletics, is found here absolutely in no more marked degree than in the U uited States. On the con- trary,. there is a unification of student life on the gridirons and diamonds of Atnerican cam- puses which no atnount of' kotnmers' and sabre duel ling will ever produce.\ The truth is that higher education in this country has made such great strides during the last few years that Americans thetnselve do not know how rapidly we are forging ahead of the most enlightened countries of Europe. No boy today need go abroad to cotnplete his edu- cation in any branch of knowledge or investi- gation. In tnany matters our post-graduate schools are distinctly in advance of the best post-graduate schools of Europe ; and in tech- nical ecluca ion especially it may not be tnany years before Europe will be sending students to American technical schools.- New York Tribune.

Manager reference is to the decision of a committee of the faculty, or more properlv, of a personag-e, quite recent on the hill and whose administr~tion so far has not been without its interesting incidents, known as the assistant treasurer. The decision is that the students rooming in North College will be obliged hereafter to grope their way as best they can in the bath room and bathe in a room wholly devoid of light. The bath room and its surroundings are objectionable enough in the dayiight but add to it total darkness and cold water for about one-third of the time, and some idea can be obtained of the present condition. Add to that the fact thatowing to the remodeling of South Colleg-e the entire popu- lation was crowded into North College and no enlargement or change whatever made in the bath room arrangements, when it was inadequate even when North College had its normal number, and the result is obvious. Two shower baths for about sixty men and in a dark room unless a man can steal a half hour between recitations and accom- plish the feat while the orb of day offers his kindly ray. ASSOCIATE EDITORS.

Entered at the Post-office at Schenectady, N. Y., as second- class matter. Undergraduate A very important matter that has been neg-lected so far is Chas. Burrows, Printer, 414 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. The Base Ball The schedule of the base ball Schedule. team for the coming season as given in this issue is in every way satisfactory. The management is to be com- mended for the excelle1:1t list of games secured. The list contains some good games and eight out of the seventeen games in the schedule are to he played on the campus. The season opens on Apri112 with the game with West Point and closes on June 7 with the game with Colgate. The management have put forth their best endeavors to secure a good schedule and it now remains for the student body to render the :financial support necessary to the carrying out of a successful season. Subscriptions are now due and it is very necessary that they should be paid at once. Banquet. an arrangement for an under- graduate banquet or smoker. Two years ago there was an undergraduate banquet at Schenectady on February 2. Last year an underg-raduate smoker was held at Albany, February 8. Here it is now, February 6th, and 110 committee has as yet been appointed from the college to confer with like committees from the Law School, Medical College and Pharmacy College to arrange for an under- graduate banquet or smoker. It is hardly necessary to state the value of a close relation between the undergraduates of the different departments of the university. One of the best ways for the strengthening- of this feeling between the several departments is to have an undergraduate banquet or smoker, where the students of the different departments can meet each other and thus become better acquainted. Such a

TltE ,CONCORl>IENStS. 11 meeting will materially strengthen the friendly feeri -ng between the different departments. It re- mains now for the president of the senior class to ap:potnt an energetic committee to arrange with the cornrnii:tees from the departments at Albany for a un.iversi ty banquet or smoker to be held the latter part ~of this n1onth or the first part of next month in Schenectady. BOOK ~EVIEW. [.A EriefSurvey of the Life and Writings of Quintus Horatius J!1lac<3usby Sidney G. Ashmore, Professor of Latin in Union lJniversity. The -Grafton Press, 1901.] The chief aim of training in the ancient litera- ture of Greece and Rotne should be to secure that broadening of mind and of sympathy, along wit:l1 that delicate refinen1ent in taste, which an amplified vista of life alone can give. Classical training should n1ake for acquaintance with the master minds of Antiquity in their most tnaster- ful tnoments and to the unfolding of personality. Theil' value to the student of language is real, yet, :in schools and colleges, should be made sevet-ely secondary and not the study of the book, but of the Man behind, and through the book, required. A failure to perceive this on the p:art of many instructors is in a large part re- sponsible for deserted lecture-rooms in America, inasmuch as the study of the Classics, if pur- sued 2s a humanizer, means health of mind and pleasure to the student, may become the most deadening of all training to the higher faculties, if this aim is disregarded. All attetnpts to further this aim tnerits ap- provaJ. Such an attetnpt is the little book of forty-eight pages now before us. It professes to be only ''a brief account of the life and writings\ of a. Latin poet, who, if not a great original genius, has proved a quickening spirit to nine- teen centuries of adtnirers. Tbe events of meaning to the life of Horace as a Poet are reviewed in small compass and in a style to charm and the influence which united to shape his tnind into its exquisite tnould and to give it poise, are depicted. He is shown- forth to the young student as a product of the Augustan Age and an exponent of its ideas; not as exemplary, but with such affections and follies, such changes from \grave to gay,\ as make a man a tn,eet companion. He is Human, not statuesque. The book is a fun survey, even if a brief one. Horace wrote satires ; hence a feature of special interest is the outlined development of Latin Satire from the days of Ennius, and an attempt is made to connect our Poet's ,excellencies and defects as a Satirist with his previous training. Of great interest is the author's description of the Via Valeria and his opinion regarding the location of Horace's Sabine Farm, arrived at through a visit to the place, is entitled to notice. A brief discussion of scholia and manuscripts, well adapted to the student's needs, bring the book to a close. It is a valuable addition to the Horatian :literatiou of schools and colleges. W. H. ADAMs, 'oz. \ THE HOUSE OF CAESA~.\ The Literary Review of the New York Times for Saturday, February I, contains a critical re- view of Seymour Van Santvoord's latest book, \ The House of Caeser and the Itnperial Disease.\ The Hon. Seymour Van Santvoord, of Troy, is a Union man of the class of r878. The critic first points out that the book is a history of nearly five hundred years of unmixed horrors and that reader& of nervous organization and refined sensibilities would do well to a void Mr. Van Santvoord's book and obtain their knowledge of the house of Caesar in more general histories, where it is found mingled in with a proper proportion of other matter. Then the critic points out that the author has written, not a history of the Caesars, but a pain- fully detailed account of the don1estic lives of the itnmediate and remote n1em bers of the im- perial families, beginning with the great .Julius Caesar and ending with Ron1ulus Augustulus. The critic then savs that Mr. Van Santvoord's .; knowledge of the ratnifications of relationship between all the people whotn he brings into his narrative is marvellous and inexhaustible. lie gives impressive proof atl the way through his work that at any tnornent he could draw the

l' ·; . ~:· .. , ;, ' , '!! Y.: '·.i 12 THm CONOORDIENSIS .. family tree of any character in. it. \ This in itself,\ the critic says, \ is a11 accomplishment of substantial ditnensions. n The author shows that of the £tty-seven Caesars by birth who catnc into the world dur- ing the century and a half begrnning with the birth of Julia~ the daughter of Julius Caesar, and ending with the death of Nero, thirty-five were murdered. The author, furthermore, shows that there was a constant progressiveness in the imperial criminality. This royal madness for dotnestic murder, in the author's view \ betrays all the psychic sytnptonls of a veritable disease, a sort of moral fever in progressive stages, to the consuming nature of which body, soul, and intellect finally surrendered.\ Mr. Van Santvoord holds Livia, the wife of Tiberius, respori~sible for the intro- duction into the house of Caesar of the genn of this fatal malady, which ev·entua.lly caused the annihilation of the Julian race and proved fatal to all the long line of Roman Emperors. The frequent intermarriages among tbe descendants of Caius Julius served to continue Livia's crime. For the n1ost part all who sat on the in1perial throne reached it and retained it by the murder of their rivals, the women of the fcunily seldom being secon<.l to the tnen in their exhibition of cruelty, craft, and general wickedness. The book is published by the N.1erryn1ount Press. It is sutn ptuously printed and illustrated and bound in an attractive manner. 'The book contains 398 pages, one third of which is occupied with photogra pbs mostly obtained with the camera of Mr. Van Santvoord h itnself. PLANS FOQ CONVOCATION WEEK. A movement is now on foot, le<l by the asso- ciation of Atnerican U niversitie~, for holding a \convocation week,\ a pet·iod during which shall be held all the conventioas usually at- tended by college men, and during which either there shall be no college exercises, or it shall be understood that any college instructor is free to be absent. The movetnent has gained such headway that six universities- Colutnbia, Cornell, the Catholic University of America, Clark, Johns Hopkins and Wisconsin.,-have changed their vacations so that the week in- cluding January Ist, shall he left free. Penn- sylvania and Princeton permit any instructor to be absent during that week for the purpose of attending the conventions. Most of the other large universities have vacation during that time. The University of Chicago and Harvard appear to be the Ot ly large educational institu- tions in which instructors cannot convenientlv , \ be absent afterJanuary rst. The movement made has so much headway, and so tnany people are now accommodated, that the concurrence ofHar- v~rd is expected. It is probable that the method adopted will be that of Pennsylvania and Princton.-Cornell Daily Sun. COLLEGE TALK. Parker, 'o3, spent Saturday and Sunday with friends at Poughkeep8ie.

Other salaries and wages are higher here than in Eu1·ope; these are lower; and they are markedly 1o.wer than the remuneration given to the same class of men in other callings. Other profes- sions have financial prizes, not so with teaching. There is some danger of scholarship and science being starved out in America ; there is serious danger of their falling into neglect, if not contempt. The office of professor needs to be dignified, as it is in Europe, by a salary cor- respondent to the intellectual eminence of the incurnbent. Capitalists should at least rank professors with their own managers, who now receive salaries many titnes greater than the professors. Mr. Carnegje made a large gift to provide retiring allowances for the employees of his mills. Nothing could have been tnore beautiful. But almost every year Cornell Uni- versity loses some successful professor because she has no endowtnent for pensions to which professors might look forward for their old age. Tl1i s is why Professor Redfield was lost to the University last su tn mer. A Princeton alumni association has been fo1·med in Gern1any. . ·--·- --- .. --- . ----- SWELL CUT GARMENTS.

One hunrlred men are daily working on the rowing machines at Columbia University. Twenty tnembers of the Harvard track team of last season have returned to Harvard this year. Yale's basketball team has been suspended by the A. A. U. for playing with unregistered teams. Hamilton sophomores have been forced to pay nearly $too in damages from injudicious painting. The faculty of Yale has removed the sopho- mores' part of the immortal Yale fence, outside of Battell chapel. The universities of France have no papers, no glee clubs, no fraternities, no athletics and no corntnencen1ent exercises .. P1~esident Eliot, of Harvard, has accepted his appoinfn1ent to serve on the Arbitration com- n1ittee of the National Civic federation. A bronze plate is going to be placed in front of Osborne Hall, at Yale, to n1ark the position of the :first college building in An1erica. A university for the higher education of women has been proposed by the Presbyterians of Kentucky and $5oo,ooo has been subscribed. It is proposed to name one of the new build- ings at Oberlin College after President Mcl{in- ley, and also one after the late Professor Rice, of Oberlin.

' j ·:' ··~ i The Concordic11sis VoL. XXV. UNION COLLEGE, FEBUARY 13, 1902. No. 15. THE NEW SCIENCE OF BACTERIOLOGY I study along hoth the above lines. It may he said that th.is science had its birth in the yeaT 1881, when Koch perfected a method of culti- vating bacteria upon solid n1edia. Up to that tirne an insuperable difficulty in the way of gaining a know ledge of thebe organisms had been the confusing n1ingling of different species of bacteria when any atternpt was made to study then.1 by direct microscopic exatnination. Sup- pose one exan1ines with the microscope a drop of impure water-containing decon1posing organic marter. Innumerable bacteria, of various forms and various modes of action, are presented to the view. It is quite itnpossible to distinguish one species from another, partly owing to their extreme tninuteness and partly to the general, similarity of their forms. The observer would not be able to distinguish, for example, the typhoid fever bacillus from com- mon and innocuous bacilli. The difficulty of isolating any single specific form was the great drawback in the study of bacteria until the in- vention of the method referred to. [By Dr. J. H. Stoller, Professor of Biology in Union College, in the Independent for December 6.] The study ofbacteria may be carried on from two quite distinct points of view. Regarding these tninute organisms in their relations to dis- ease, bacteriology becomes a branch of path- ology, or the science of diseases. It is in this aspect chiefly that the subj:ect has claimed the attention of investigators in recent years. In the history of any science those phases of it which have a direct relation to human interests are naturally the first to be cultivated. A science which at the outset offered a new theory of in- fectious diseases, with the implied possibilities ' in therapeutics, or methods of treating such dis- eases, was sure to be developed first in this direction. From the other point of view bacter'iology is simply a branch of biological science-a divi- sion of the subject of botany, the most attractive of sciences. Bacteria are minute plants, and, like the larger ones with which we are familiar, for the most part are not only harmless but use- ful and beneficient to mankind. The study of bacteria from this standpoint may be said to have added a new department of flora to sys- tematic botany. It has also resufted in impor- tant discoveries concerning the role of these organisms in many processes in nature. We now know that bacteria are a necessary factor in that circulation of matter which is constantly going on between the organic and inorganic kingdoms in nature. As soon as an animal or plant dies, bacteria seize upon the body and break down its highly complex compounds into the sitnple ones o the inorganic world. The latter are then in available forn1 to serve as food for plants, whence they may again be lifted up into the organic realm. This science of bactetiology cotnprehends the knowledge that has been gained of bacteria by If one holds in the hand a mixture of small seeds of similar forn1s and sizes it n1ay be diffi- cult or impossible to pick out the different kinds. But if these are now scattered over a consider- able area of soil and allowed to grow to tnature plants, the latter will then be so unlike as to be readily distinguished and classified according to their natural characteristics. * * * * * * * The classification of bactet·ia, or systematic bactet·iology, therefore, rests upon a different principle from that employed with reference to all other plants. While the latter are grouped according to features of the individual plant- the form, number and arrangement of statnens, pistils, etc. ,-bacteria at·e classified, as regards species, according to f~atures presented by aggregates of like individuals, or colonies. * * * * * * * In the year that Koch published his method

6 THE OONOORDIENSIS. of obtaining pure cultures of bacteria he se.t forth the results of his studies as to :the pro- cedure necessary to establish the causal relatiQn- ship of any suspected species of bacterium to disease. H.e stated that the conditions neces- sary to be satisfied, in order to demonstrate the etiological relation of any species of organism to disease, were four, as follows: First, the organisms must be found in the blood or tissues of the body affected with the disease; second, ' they must be transferred from the diseased tis- sues to artificially prepared media and pure cul- tures of them obtained; third, when tnaterial · .· from a pure culture is inoculated into a healthy subject it must produce the disease in question ; fourth, the species of organism under investi- gation must be found in the tissues of the animal to which the dise~se has been communicated by inoculation. so-but a cointn:unicable, ihfectious disease. The germs enter the body through the air and also, though probably not frequently, H:trough the use of milk and m·eat from tuberculous cows. There is strong evidence that the healthy human body is ordinarily able to resist the invasion of the tuberculosis germ, so that, while it is an infectious disease, it is not highly dangerous as such .. The discovery that erysipelas is due to a specific organism was made and vetified by Fehleisen in r883. In r 884 Koch published his discovery of the cholera germ-the '' co1nma\ baciUus. Like the bacillus of typhoid fever, the cholera gern1 shows an alternation of conditions in its life history. In one stage it lives outside the body, a favorite habitat being impure water ; the other stage of its existence is realized if it finds access to the human body, where, changing its mode of life, it becomes a parasitic organism. Applying these tnethods, Koch demonstrated the truth of the genu theory of disease in the case of a number of distinct affections to which some of the lower anitnals are subject. The way having thus been opened, rapid pro- gress was made in this line of research, invested with so much importance to human interests. The most i1nportant discoveries may here be mentioned. The bacillus of typhoid fever, first observed by Elberth in r 88o, was in r884 first cultivated and described by Gafiky. The chain of evi- dence is not quite complete with reference to the specific infective character of this organism. Elberth's bacillus is undoubtedly always present in certain organs of the body, especially the intestine and spleen, of a person having typhoid fever; also, it can be isolated in artificial pure cultures. But owing to the fact that animals are not subject to this disease it has not been demonstrated that it can be produced by inocu- lation. * * * * * * * In 1882 Koch announced his discovery of the bacillus of tuberculosis and proved by his methods that the organistn was the true cause of the disease. This discovery has changed the whole theory of the etiology of this disease, making it not an hereditary-at least not directly The bacillus of diphtheria was discovered by Loeffler in the year r884. This is an exa1nple of a disease germ which is localized in a par- ticular region of the body, but w bose effects extend to all of the tissues. The bacillus is confined to the false tnembrane of the throat, but it throws off a poison called toxine which, through the circulation of the blood, produces the general systemic derangement which consti- tutes the disease. * * * * * * * A disease germ possessing characteristics similar to that of the bacillus .of diphtheria is the organism which is the specific cause ot tetanus, or lock jaw. It was discovered by Nicolaur, also in the year I884. rrhe natural habitat of this germ is the soil, whence it finds access to the body through wounds. * * * * * * * In addition to the above many othet discov- eries of bacteria occurring in association with disease have been n1ade. But in many cases a doubt arises as to whether the organisms ob- served are the cause of the disease or merely incidental to a diseased condition arising from pl1ysical causes. For instance, a germ has been isolated from the mucous secretions accotnpany-

It may be said in general that the discoveries in the science of bacteriology in its relation to diseases, during the last decade and a half, have · shown that a number of maladies, including ' sever~ I of those most cornmon and most destruc- tive of human life, are due to specific germs, and that these discoveries have given a new and scientific etiology, or theory of causes, for these diseases. In regard to the practical applica- tion of the knowledge gained in the treatment and cure of diseases, it tnay be said that the whole matter is in the experimental stage, but that sorne achievetnents have been made and that there is warrant for hoping that much may be accomplished in the future. WASHINGTON ALUMNI QE-UNION. Annual Re-union and Dinner on Feb .. ruary 24. The fifth re-unton and dinner of the Union College Alumni Association of Washington, will be held at the Hotel Raleigh, Pennsylvania avenue and Twelfth street, on Monday evening, February 24. The dinner, which will be served at seven o'clock, will be preceded by the busi- ness meeting at six p. m. President Raymond will be present on the occasion and every effort is being n1ade to tnal{e the occasion a success. Attention is called to the annexed li'st of resi- dent alutnni. If anyone can corTect it or supply- any omissions, the secretary \Vould be pleased to hear from thetn. The by-laws provide that any person who has, for any length of time, been in attendance at Union College or any of the affilliated schools of Union University, or who has received any degree therefrom, is eligible to membership. Alutnni of Union University residing in Washington are as follows : The greatest triutnphs of bacteriology thus far are in the line of preventive rather than in curative medicine. It is impossible to over- estitnate the benefits that have already been de- rived from our present clear know ledge of the nature of infectious diseases. We are no longer wholly at the mercy of a spreading contagion like that of Asiatic cholera ; the success with which that disease was controlled in r892 was largely the outcotne of our present exact knowl- edge of its nature, as shown by bacteriological research. The science of sanitation, in relation to quarantine, drainage, water supply, etc., has had a new birth in recent years, for which thanks are largely due to workers in bacteri- ology. Mention should be made, too, of the very im- portant contribution which the study of bacteria has made to the science of surgery. The rela- tions of these organisms to inflatnmatory con- ditions of wounds, . have been investigated, resulting in the now well known tnethods of antiseptic surgery, of inestimable value in alle- viating suffering and diminishing 111ortality. To Lister, an English surgeon, more than to any one man, is due the credit of introducing this system of surgery. Union College- vVilliam W.. Dean, '37, Asahel C.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 ''As a life work the study of the child is :QEV. GEO. H. ARCHBOLD ON \CHILD magnificent, it gives you the opportunity to get STUDY.\ down beside the child. Would not you like to Rev. George H. Archbold, the extension lecturer of the Bible N onnal College, Spring- field, Mass., who has been lecturing in this city, spoke at the Vesper servi~ce in Silliman Hall, Sunday afternoon. The speaker talked on \The Study of Children as .a Life Work.\ He said, ''Every one of us wants to be help- ful to others. You come here to learn how to he helpful to others, for there is something in the human heart that makes us desire to be helpful. We n1ust, however, learn to be help- ful to the little children. ''The tnost dangerous thing in the world is the desire to be greater than others. It is a good thing to want to be great, but to want to he greater than others is harmful. When the disciples were quarreling as to who was the greatest, Jesus called a little child and said, 'Except that ye become like this little child ye cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.' The first principle of being great is to be small. A truly great man never thinks of his greatness. \All Nature cares for its offspring, except tnan. We do not understand the child. Some of you are studying for the ministry, some are to be teachers, and to you especially, I say, ' Study the Child.' It will bel p you, first for the life you want to live, and second for the bel pfulness of the life you want to live. If you want to be truly great men, study the child. Ton1orrow I could place fifty men in positions as superintendents of Sunday schools with salaries fron1 $1500 to $2ooo a year. Of course these tnen must understand the child, they would have to have the child feeling, to see and think as he does. ''You can tell what the man will be from the bov. The germinal nucleus of the later life is st~red up there. .We let the child play a little while and then when he is six years old we send him to school to be buried in books. I tell you, young men, that this is all wrong. The great work of the future will be among the boys and girls. We cannot be happy until we get down to the level of the child. have a life that flows out with helpfulness like a never ending Tiver? ''You do not know how many weak fellows here in college need your help, and it is just by this helping others that we get strong ourselves. What a great thing it is to have someone come up to us and say, \How you have helped me!\ '' So, young men, I suggest to you this noble life work as a specialist in the study of the child. The great need of our time and of our church is for men that understand children.\ \COLLEGE DAYS OF THE P:QESI- DENTS.\ The current Munsey contains an article of much interest to college men, called \College Days of the Presidents,\ by F. S. Arnett. Only six of the Presidents of the United States have been fraternity men, and of these six two were admitted as members after graduation. The article is of interest to Union men in that it refers to Chester Alan Arthur, A. B., Union, '48, LL.D., '82. In speaking of President Arthur's college days the author says, \Arthur who came of a college bred race, was a typical fraternity man of today. His scholarship was shown by his election to Phi Beta Kappa as one of the sixteen highest in his graduating class at Union. But it was to Psi Upsilon that he gave a lifelong devotion.\ An account is given ot a fraternity dinner given by Arthur, while President, to the his fraternity and the men prominent in national affairs who took part in it. In continuing, ~'Arthur, that night, was again a college boy, and although carriages had been ordered for ten o'clock, there was ~eluct­ ance to leave even at two in the morning.\. .. Armour Institute, with an endowment of $3,ooo,ooo, and an enrollment of I ,ooo students, will probably be absorbed by the University of Chicago in a short time. In the past five years this university has absorbed 19 schools.

At the meeting at Utica on Feb- ruary 1 of theN. Y. S. I. A. A. Union's representatives, E. W. Stro11g, '99, and D. E. Griffith, '02, presented to the meeting Union's resignation. This was ac- cepted with regret by the tneeting. Some of the representatives expressed themselves as having the same difficulty that is the cause of Union's with- drawal. This difficulty is that the League game very often seriously in terfer with games that might be arranged with other college teams. The management of the athletic teams at Union have encountered this difficulty for some years. Union then withdraws from the League solely on account of the fact that she desires greater freedom in the arrangement of her athletic schedules and from no other motive. The Psi U Fire The Concordiensis express the sentiments of the college when it offers to the mem- bers of the Psi Upsilon fraternity its sincere sympathy for their recent mis- fortune. This, the members, doubtle&s already know that they have, as shown by the efforts of the students to secure the furniture and personal belongings of the members from the burning house. But this acknowledgement is tnade to assure them that the loss was one to the college as well as to the members of the fraternity. The accident is to be regretted as unfortunate, and it is hoped that the insurance will entirely cover the loss. The New Catalogue. The Catalogue Committee is to be congratulated on the appearance of the new University Catalogue. The volume is larger than the last catalogue and is a much better~appearing book than u-;ual. It con~ tains one hundred and eighty-six pages of printed n1atter, one hundred and' fifteen of which are de- voted to the College, nineteen to the Medical, thirteen to the Law, ten to the College of Pharmacy, five to the Dudley Observatory and the remaining twenty-six to the university in general. The ar- rangement of the matter contained in the catalogue is much improved. The total number of students for the entire llniversity is five hundred and thirty. Of this number one hundred and ninety-five are in the College, one hundred and fifty-four in the Medical, one hundred and twenty-seven in the Law and :fifty-four in the College of Pharmacy.

THE PSI U HOUSE INJURED. A fire broke out in the upper eastern wing of the Psi Upsilon house on Thursday morning, February 6, at about half past ten o'clock. The origin of the fire is unknown but it is thought that it was caused by improper insulation of the electric wiring. The upper eastern portion is completely destroyed, the inner walls and the rooms are much damaged. The lower floors are also injured from being flooded with water. The fire was discovered by Walker, 'o5, who was returning to his room from a recitation. He endeavored to extinguish the flames with Attention was concentrated upon the calm a11d trustful tnood of one who, environed by enemies, lay down and slept confident in a God who was his ' 4 shield,\ and the \uplifter of his ' head\ -and the jubilant, exultant tetnper in which he awoke refreshed, with a courage that declared itself ready to face ten thousand foes and not content merely to remain on the defen- sive besought God to at·ise and lead the assault. , Dr. Truax pointed out tl1at Psalm IV is an evening prayer expressing the gratitude and trust of one who counts \gladness of heart\ a greater blessing than increase of corn and wine, and who longs at eventide f()r the light of God's countenance-as for a mother's smiling face. , the aid of the fraternity chef, but as their efforts were proving futile one of them turned in the fire alarm. The fire department responded promptly but it was some titne before .any streams were play1ng on the fire as the hydrants on the college grounds were frozen up and it was with tnuch difficulty that they were put into use. In the mean time the hydrant on Union avenue was connected and was helpful in extinguishing the fire although situated at such a distance from the burning house~ All of the furniture and personal belongings of the occu- pants except those of Walker, 'o5', in whose room the fire stat·ted, were saved though tnuch ot the furniture was injured in being brought out. The furniture was carried by the students to Sillin1an Hall as a place of safety. The loss on the house and furniture is about $3700 which is covered by insurance. 1'he members of the fraternity are now temporarily installed in South College where they will remain until their house is repaired. Psaln1 V is a morning prayer in which the thought ranges forward to the cares and duties and opportunities of a dawnjng day, and in its four strophes it dwells upon the watchful gi ar- dian in the heavens; the yawning pits that open on the path of life; the divine abhorrence of the plotter of unrighteousness ; the delight of God in the doer of good. The relation of sleep to the work of life was discussed, and above the man who trusted in himself, above even the king, protected by his palace walls and guards, was placed the man who at the close of each day can sleep serenely as Christ slept, though in tbe midst of winds - and waves that fright the very pilot. Such an one can face the struggle of life each day with the coolness of nerve and the strength of n1ind and body, that assure victory and even reap its joys in advanee in expectant anticipation of his buoyant spirit. Eighteen Rutgers men took part in the first trial for n1en for the debate team which will contest with Union the lattet- part of this term. LECTURESHIP FO~ JUDGE LANDON. Judge Judson S. Landon, L.L.

Ashmore, of the Latin depart- ment, delivered the first lecture in the course before the Shakespeare Club on the evening of February 6. The lecture was interesting and instructive and W'ls appreciated judging from. the large audience present. The Concordiensis regrets that it is impossible to publish the text of the lecture owing to the large number of extracts from the play that were excellently read by Prof. Ashmore. The lecture showed thought and a thorough mastery of the play and the speaker treated it at some length, the lecture occupying an hour and twenty minutes. TI:IE ALLISON-FOOTE DEBATE.

Smith and McLindon of 1901 have visited the school dur- ing the past few weeks. 1903 counts three new 1nen, Nicholas DeVoe, Albany, N.Y.; Milton DeVoe, Albany, N.Y.; and George H. Smith, Hamilton, N. Y. and Colgate University, B. S. Tl1e seniors are still wrestling with Real Prop- er: y and Code Procedure. The juniors will con- tinue Elementary Law until March with Mr. Battershall, when Domestic Relations will be taken up, followed by Mr. Parker on Bailment, and Judge Tennant on Personal Property. In spite of the high percentage of failures throughout the State at the recent bar examin- ations, the Albany Law School maintained her reputation for the almost total absence of failures, and Messrs. Cook, Coons, Kathan, Bonesteel, Knapp, Russell and Shedd, all of 1902, were among the successful ones. Of these Messrs. Knapp and Bonesteel have left the school. The second tenn started most auspiciously on the 3d it st., lectures being resumed on the 4th. Hon. Judson S.

This is a splendid addition to the fa-::ulty, and will do tnuch to help the school in the steady progress which is being made under the present ·manage- ment. LITE:QA.I<Y NOTES. THE LOVE STORY OF GEORGE ELLIOT. The world has always judged pretty harshly the union of George El Hot and George Henry Le\ves ; not for itself but for its influence upon others. The early life of George Elliot and the nature of her intimacy with Mr. Lewes and the strong personality of each are feelingly discussed in the March Delineator by Clara E. Laughlin in her series on Authors' Loves. Certainly George Elliot's four and twenty years of life with Lewes were idyllic, full of ea1·nest purpose and unren1itting labor and crowned with a per• fection of mutual understanding and helpfulness. Mr. Lewes fh·st encouraged her to write fiction and bet· success proved his wisdotn ; her novels bear an1ple testimony to this. The article is accornpan ied by some rare illustration. In the same number there is another essen- tially literary paper by Dr. Elliott on his Recol- lections .of Maria White (Mrs. James Russell Lowell.) There is a very interesting article in the At- lantic Monthly on ''Co lege Professors and the Public,\ written by the editor, Bliss Perry. SWELL CUT CARMENTS.

THE '00N,CORDIENSIS. 15 INTER-COLLEGIATE. The University of Michigan now offers a course 1n ship-building. The Yale Football Association made a clean profit of $25 ,ooo the past season. There is a concerted action among the colleges of Michigan to do away \vith football. Under Mr. Seth Low's leadership the re- sources of Colutnbia university increased from $r z,ooo,ooo to $I8,ooo~ooo; three separate schools have grown into seven united depatt- mPnts and the student population has increased from I, 1 oo to 4,6oo. Among the college men registered as law students at the University of Pennsylvania more than sixty colleges and universities are repre- sented ; and among the 380 students almost Out of twenty ... eight games on Princeton's basebail schedule, fifteen are to be contested in Princeton. : every county in Pennsylvania and twenty-two States and foreign countries are represented. The University of California is planning for a new library building which will contain I,ooo,- ooo volumes and accotnn1odate 6oo students in its reading rooms. Ten hours of study, eight hours of sleep, two of exercise, and four devoted to meals and social duties, is what President Eliot of Harvard recommends to students. Chicago has a runner who is hailed as a crack man. The tnost interesting part of this news is the fact that the athlete in question is a Russian, Xenapha l(alatnatlan by name. Dt·. W. G. Anderson, physical director of Yale University, has just completed a new invention for measuring the effect of different kinds of exercise on the human brain. Andrew Carnegie has given $too,ooo to the , Stevens Institute of Technology at Hoboken. The money is intended as an endowment for the Carnegie Laboratory of Engineering .. Students who represent the University or Texas in inter-collegiate debating or oratorical contests are excused frotn examinations between the time of their selection and such contests. President Eliot of Harvard in his annual report showed sta.tistic.s which proved that the athletic successes and failure& of a year do not affect the size of the next year's entering class. The registration of students at Cornell this year is very he.avy; the total number reaching 2,980, while the property of the University by the treasurer's report has increased to $Io,- 87o,2oo. LAND FOR THE UNIVERSITY. The Assen1bly passed on Thursday, February 6, Senator McEwan's bill authorizing Albany to donate to Union University six acres of the ahnshouse property for the erection of a build- ing for the advancement of science and astro- nornical research.

By Charles Emory Smith, Union, '61. ~ [Former Postmaster-General of the United States, in Saturday Evening Post for February 15, 1902.] ''Cabinet tnaking is always a fa~cinating work to those who engage in it speculatively. It is the journalist's delight and the politician's game. But to the President, who has the real responsi- bility and whose Adm.nistration n1ay be largely made or marred by his choice, it is often a most difficult and puzzling task. ''At first blush it would seem easy enough to pick out eight men fron1 the whole country to sit around the Cabinet table. But once seriously undertaken the problem is found to involve factors which complicate and perplex it. The members of the Cabinet must be the personal choice of the President and yet men of right public relations. They must be agreeable to him in their personality and at the satne titne possess representative character. They are not only his Constitutional advisers and his executive arm in the administration of the Government, but his daily associates. Then they are ex- pected to be geographically distributed over the country, if this unwritten law can be blended with other requiRites. They must be selected with reference not merely to their fitness for their respective departn1ents, but to their quali- fications for the national council board. In short, they should combine personal accept· ability, administrative capacity, broad judge- ment and experience, and sound public repute. \When these tests are applied and the prac- tical limitations are remembered, the range of choice is much narrower than would at first be itnagined. There are plenty of men who would make good officials, but they either are not known or have not the right environment. 1\hese difficulties confront selections for other high positions as well as for the Cabinet places. Tht~ough the exigencies and consequences of the Spanish War, President McKinley had many important appointtnents to rnake. He had to name the 'Peace Commission, the two Philip- pine Commissions, various Boards of Inquiry, and so on. No one knew the men of the country so well as he did; and yet as the field was scanned with his associates it was frequently ren'l:arked how few tnen available for places of rank were in sight. Most of those whose names naturally suggested themselves were already in place. Indeed, in making up the Peace Com- mission the President was constrained to go to the Senate for three of the five. \In the earlier days tnembers of the Cabinet were often drawn frotn the Senate. Webster twice passed from the one branch to the other. Clay had been in the Senete, but went from the House to the State Department. Buchanan, Clayton, Cass, Sevvard, Chase and Fessenden w.ere called from the Senate to the Cabinet. Even in later days the roll is long. Blaine, Morrill, Sherman, vVindom, T'eller, Howe, Baya1·d, Garland, Lamar and Carlisle were all tetn pted from the Senate by Cabinet honors and oppo1·tunities. \But this change becomes less and less com- mon. The Senate grows in power and the Cabinet grows in work and responsibility. The Senate is a forun1 of debate and the Cabinet a theatre of action. Everything in the Senate is under the public eye and much of the Cabinet work is behind closed doors. With the pro- digious growth of the country and the vast ex- pansion of the public service in every 9irection the labor of the Cabinet official and the den1ands upon his time and watchfulness have increased enonnously. The strong Senators shrink from the transfer, and the weak ones are not wanted. With this substantial elitnination of the Senate from the field of choice, the range becomes still more limited.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. GARFIELD'S ELEVENTH- HOUR CABINE'l'. \ The President-elect thus passes most of the time from his election in November to his in- auguration in March in constructing a Cabinet, and it is sotnetitnes still unfinished or materially recast on the eve of his aceession. The Cabinet of President Garfield might alrnost he called the Eleventh-Hour ,Cabinet. Three of its members were named and placed at the last rninute. Senator Allison -vvas sought for the Treasury, as he had been so n1any titnes. No other fl?an of our day has been so often pressed to enter the Cabinet. His long experience, his broad knowledge of all public afiairs, his sobriety of judgment, his equipoise, make him a conspicu- ously wise and safe counsellor, and every Presi- dent of his party wants the advantage of his . servtce. ''Presidents Harrison and McKinley both asked and urged him in vain t.J take the tnanage- ment of the nation's finances. Neither offer seriously attracted him, for his great position in the Senate was then securely fixed. But under Garfield, when he was considerably younger and his Senatorial career had not been so long and exceptional, he was strongly tempted. He had served in the House with the newly elected President, and both in the House and Senate with Blaine, who was the Pre1nier, and the association of the trio in the three great executive offices looked inviting. \But Allison, always wary and never lacking in insight, finally declined just before the in- auguration, and his refusal seriously deranged the slate. Two changes were made necessary. Senator Windo1n, who had been selected for the Interior, was transferred to the Treasury, and Allison's colleague, Senator Kirkwood, was hurriedly decided on for the Interior. The titne was so short that he was not even con- sulted, and the first he knew of his appointment was when his nomination was submitted to the body of which he was a tnetnber .... \These selections proved to be entirely judi- cious. The assassination of President Garfield cut short Mr. Windom's first term and gave him little opportunity. But in his second term, under President Harrison, he displayed marked aptitude and capacity for financial ad:ministra- tion, and his tragic death. while expounding his policies at the Chamber of Commerce dinner in New York lent a ha~o to his public servic·e. '' There was still another decision at the last moment. The designation of the Cabinet tnem- ber from New York had hung fire from the :first. Senator Conkling demanded that the Empire State should have nothing less than the Treasury, and he was disposed to be exacting and un- yielding. This was his natural tetnper, and the consciousness of his great services made him the Inore self-assertive. He had gone into the Presidential campaign reluctantly, fot· he disliked Garfield; but when he finally stnothered his feelings and stripped for the fight he fought like a gaint. His powerful speech at the great meeting with Grant at Warren, Ohio, was a trumpet blast, and his whole trip through the doubtful States was a conqueror's tour. His friends claimed that he had saved the day, and the return that he insisted on was that New York should have the Treasury portfolio. His candidate was Levi P. Morton, or, if that could not be, Charles J. Folger. '' But Garfield recoiled, for precisely the san1e reason which led President Roosevelt, in re- cently seeking a successor to Secretary Gage, to look away from New York. He did not want to expose hitnself to the imputation of placing the Treasury under the influence of Wall Street. He knew the strength of cotnbining financial capacity with broader popular contract and sytnpathy. He therefore sought to escape the diletnma by recognizing the man and reserving the place. With this idea he tendered the Navy portfolio to Mr. Morton, who was dis- posed to accept it. But Mr. Conkling was tenacious and uncornpromising, and under his influence Morton at last rejected the proffer. As an alternative, Thomas L. James, the model Postmaster of New Y orl{, had been considered for Postmaster-General, and this appointn1ent, in the line of good public service and rational politics, was settled on the afternoon of the day before inauguration. \ The Cabinet thus born through n1any throes had great strength, together with seeds of ·:.: ..

·:.:. i '' '· I~ . I I THE CONCORDIEN.SlS. 7 schism. .Mr. Blaine was inevitably a dominat. ing figure wherever he was. Attorney-General MacVeagh, brilliar:t, skeptical, satirical, incis- ive, did not naturally affiliate with the Premier. Had there been no interruption it would have been interesting to watch the play of these two astute and dexterous men. But the assassina- tion of Garfield, only four months after he took the oath, changed the whole face of affairs, and with the accession of President Arthur (Union, '48) the Cabinent soon went to pieces. Blaine was followed by the an1iable graceful and feeble Frelinghuysen, who succeeded in upsetting all that his predecessors had done. \ The Treasury portfolio was handed over to New York, where Senator Conkling, backed by Vice-President Arthur, had originally tried to place it. Mr. Morton was a\'ray as Minister to France, and Judge Folger was called to the Cabinet. * * * * * THE CLEVER GENERALSHIP OF LINCOLN. \ There are two theories of Cabinet-making. One is to group together the great and recog- nized party leaders and the possib.e or the actual Presiden1 ial con1petitors. The other is to choose strong and representative n1en, but rather with reference to their personal fitness and mutual accord than to their party leader- ship. Lincoln made up his Cabinet on the fonner theory. He took Sewar(J (Union, '2o), Chase, Carneron and Bates, who had all been candida-tes in tl1e norninating convention against him, and called the energetic Stanton only when the necessities of the '\Var cotnpelled. It was a Cabinet of great distinction, but of dissension and conflict. Seward and Chase represented antagonistic eletnents of the party ; they had their own rival ambitions; their friends were al- ways quarrelling, and they shared in the struggle. \ Lincoh:~ was great enough to manage even those powerful leaders, but it required all his tact and skill. A Senate cabal undertook to force Seward out of the Cabinet. Chase, who was a party to the movement, agreed to aid it. When Lyman Trumbull and the other Senatorial conspirators presented themselves to Lincoln with Chase, and counted on the latter's positive and active advocacy, he shrunk from the direct issue, and they went away denouncing him. Seward was finally stung by the persistent opposition into placing his resignation into the President's hands. ''Lincoln then manceuvred to get Chase's resignation as well. In his play against Seward, Chase prepared it and went to the White House with no expectation of actually delivering it, but intending to use the possibility as a leverage against his rival. Lincoln tnanaged to get hold of it, and then with the unwilling resignations of both in his possession he wa~ ~master of the situation. Neithe'· wanted to go out, and, with the club in this hands, Lincoln con1pelled them to cease their contest and then tore up the papers. But, illustrious as they were, it is doubtful whether a Cabinet thus constituted posse:3ses the largest measure of efficiency. TliE CONSTRUCTION OF THE MCKINLEY CAJHNET \The McKinley Cabinet was constructed on the second theory. Through his long service in Congress and his wide journeyings on the stump President McKinley had an unequaled knowledge of the public men of the country. But with all his skill and knowledge the fram- ing of his Cabinet was no easy task. He had four different men in mind at different stages of the construction for the Secretary oftbe Treasury, but returned in the end to the one toward whom his thought had first been directed. Mr. Bliss was first offered the Navy portfolio, ar_d, tnough n1o~·e attractive to him than any other, he de- clined that or any o her place, and at last on the day before the inauguration was almost dragged into the Interior, and Judge McKenna, who had been designed for the Interior, took the Attorney-Generalship. \When at length the Cabinet was cornpleted substantially as President McKinley war:tted it, it was marked, if not unique, in two respects- first, in its unselfish loyality to its chief; and, seeond, in its absolute unity and concord. The members were supretnely devoted to the P·~esi­ dent and to their work under him, and they were in perfect agreen1ent among themselves. There were no conflicts, no bickerings and no

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS. rivalries. If it were pennissible, much might be said of sotne of the mem hers by one of their colleagues, but it is unnecessary now, and their records speak for themselves. This. :much at least is in order, that, though other Cabinets have had members of longer standing and n1ore distinguished public service, it is doubtful if among them all there has been a more harmoni- ous and efficient working Cabinet. '' This was due in large part to the fine skill and leadership of President McKinley. He brought out the best in his associates. He recognized them as real advisers and responsible heads of departments, ~nd not as mere agents of . the Executive. He encouraged them to mark out their own lines and develop their own methods. There was not one of them but felt th11t the President was there, with his superior wisdon1 and consumate art of doing things, to suggest and tnodify and control. His judgtnent was sure to be the best judgment. He guided and tnoulded, and often pointed out both means and ends. No man was ever more thoroughly the President. But he liked and allowed freedom ; he stimulated individual thought and effi)rt; he sought and was ready o accept coun- sel, and he had that quality of greatness that strengthens and supports its own best with the best a bout it. \Most of the later Cabinets have been con- structed more nearly on the McKinley theory than the Lincoln theory, though son1e of thetn have ai tned to blend the two. President Hays d1d a wise thing in making John Shern1an Sec- retary of the Treasury. He thus brought to his side the strength of a potential party leader and assured a capable administration of the finances at a critical time. Outside of Sherman the Cabinet WtitS essentially individual. The two . \\ conspicious men were Evarts and Schurz, both la ge public figures and giving the Administra- tion the popular respect which goes with high character and purpose, but not representing a political following. THE STRENGTH OF SHERMAN AND BLAINE. \ When President Harrison was elected it was universally expected that he would make Mr. Blaine Secretary of State. It was the fri·ends of Mr. Blaine who had notninated him and they counted on theit leader being put at the head of the Ca '· inet. Did the President have some intuition of a possible clash? Whether he did or not, there was certainly very · unusual delay in communicating the summons. November and December passed without bring·· ing the invitation, and Mr. Blaine, who did not conceal his desire 1 o return to the State Depart- ment to take up the work interrupted by Gar- field's assassination, was troubled and anxious. When at last the letter came, near the tniddle of January, it was cordial and hearty, and removed aU misgivings. * * * * * \ In making both his Cabinets President Cleveland combined the po1itical and the personal elements. For the first he took three men of high reputation from the Senate, and one or tvvo from his personal association. For the second he politically transforrned Mr. Gresham, transplanted Mr. Carlisle from the Senate, and discovered Mr. Olney in the recesses of a Boston law office. This was a discovery of the first order. Others had varying degrees of success or otherwise, but Mr. Olney entered upon a career and left a fame. '' Tht:' blending of personal and political ele- ments in the Cabinent is entirely l1annonious with our American system. Under the Engli\h system the ~abitnent represents the Parliatnent and is chosen frotn the leaders who have achieved position there. Under the American theory of the three coordinate legislative, execu- tive and judiciai branches, the Cabinet does not represent Congress, but constitutes the adtni n is- trative force of the Executive, and the President should have, as he does have more and more distinctly, his personal choice.\ PROF.

Vedder: Joe Chamber! ain, my Joe, oh! when first we were acquaint, You had a touch of nobleness, but now your touch is taint; You thought none but a vandal Would work the crime and scandal, South Afric things to handle, With aught but pride for those who made its deseTt wildness grow, To order, grace and beauty fair, and honor, \don't you know ? '' Joe Chamberlain, my Joe, oh! in that true halcyon day, You boldly sought, successfully, oppression's hand to stay; You scorned the diamond broker, The g-rasping gold mine stoker ; You were no ghastly joker At rights which freetnen grandly earned in travail, toil and tears, 0 'er burning sands and prowling beasts and ruth- less savage spears. Joe Chamberlain, my Joe, oh! you had some man- hood then, And well had claimed a place to hold with good and noble men; Than yours, no ... better leader Had bid his Britain speed her, To where all right should need her, But, ah, you left his glorious side in selfish thirst of fame, And 'spite your higher, better thought, contrived your Britain's shame! .Joe Chamberlain, my Joe, oh I if eyes like yours can weep, And slumber come, with Lethe power, and woo those eyes to sleep, What tears shall greet thy waking, Thy present dream off-shaking, When Time, thy measure taking, Shall weigh the widowed, orphaned lives, and young hearts still and cold, In balance 'g-ainst the wide world's hiss, and diatnond mines and gold, The price, oh, God, the fearfnl price, the price, oh, man, all told, For which a juggling British man fair Britain's honor sold! -C. 8.

A new feature about the commencement exercises of the Medical last spring was the wearing for the first time by the graduates of caps and gowns. The Law 'men also wore them at their commencement exercises. This would seem to be a proof that ca-ps and g-owns are becoming more popular and that the different departments are approaching the true university stand point. A fault to be found with the custom on the hill is that they are not worn enoug-h. The se11ior class should certainly wear them fron1 examination week through the final commencement e=xercises if not longer. In- stead of being dropped they are gaining ground every year. Many colleges and universities are insisting that they be worn. The following is fr()m a recent exchange: ''The cap and gown is a dignified uniform, marking the close of many years sp.ent in study. Worn by seniors only, it serves to unite them more closely in the last,days of their course. The chief argument against caps and gowns. is that they are inconvenient in rainy and windy weather,, and that they are too warm in hot weather. It is not necessary that they should be worn on stormy days, and in hot weather no coat need be worn beneath them. The costume is a democratic dress; it places all members of the class on the same plane; it brings a bond of fel- lowship that could not be had otherwise.\ Debating vs. Athletics. toto. The following appeared in a recent number of an exchange, The Penn- sylvanian, and expresses the situa- tion so concisely that it is taken in ''The lack of interest taken in the career and success of intercollegiate debating teams, not only by the students of this University, but by the student bodies in general, is a matter for serious thought. Are college men really prouder of the physical prowess of their University or are they unwilling to display for public gaze their more serious attainments? We hardly think the latter condition exists, and reluctantly must come to the conclusion that there is more real interest in the daring tackle and the pluck race than there is in the brilliant argument. ''It is possible that the work of a debating team lies tnore along the lines of college work than that of the fo<?tball eleven or the baseball nine, and it may be that there is a natural antipathy toward employing leisure time in more study. This arg-u- ment does not cover enough, however, as the tre- mendous work of a football season is not under- gone for the mere enjoyment of leisure time and the enjoyment of the sport. It might have started so, but today a man works night and day to make a place on a team for the !zonor of it. \That is the root of the trouble. The honor of athletics has been magnified while that of the de- bate and oration has been allowed to fall into decay. And surely in the great world of inter- collegiate activity there is room and honor enough )'· ,. ',(· ' '' '. •j 'I '11 :t .. J It \, :~ I I)

They simply reflect the sentiment of student bodies, and it is al- most certain that if favor were be shown by editors and owners of papers it would incline to the debate. \Men on the various athletic teams wear em- blems. They are known; they are pointed out; they are heroes. The member of a college debat- ing tean1 wears no letter and he is known to only his immediate friends. \Athletics are a .good thing. The man who learns self-reliance, quick thought, the ability to last, and all the lessons that a 'Varsity team teaches, will find them good stock in trade for the battle of life. Yet their most ardent admirer can- not claim that they compare with the value of a thorough knowledge of debate and public speaking. \A good athlete will find trouble in finding his physical prowess of value with patient or jury, and he will succutnb to the man of logic and mental development. On the day when there will not be a man less to see the football game with-at Franklin Field, but at the same time the Academy will be filled with students and alumni, flags and colors for the debate-on that day the University- and every college in the country-will be sending better developed men into the world of affairs.

The Allison-Foote debate will take place in the State Street Methodist church on Friday night, February 21. The following men have been asked to serve as judges: Ron. Simon W. Rosendale, of Albany, Seymour Van Sant- voord, Union, '78, of Troy, and Hon. Dennis O'Brien, of Albany. . Minnesota's fund for needy students amounts to $5o,ooo. ALBANY LAW SCHOOL. Fred C. Laurent, of Little Falls, N. Y., has entered the junior .class. Leland L. Boorn, 1903, is attending lectures again, after a short absence occasioned by ill- ness. John L. Cummings, 1903, and Lee F. Betts, 1903, are the latest additions to the Devil's Own. Phi Delta Phi has opened a fraternity house at 84 South Swan street, scarcely half a dozen doors from the school. Eight of the members are domiciled at the new house. The senior course in Real Property was con- cluded by Judge Tennant on Friday, the 14th, Criminal Law, by the same lecturer, taking its place. The examination in the former subject occurs this week. Frank M. Hickok, 1902, is captain of the basket ball team of Company A, Tenth Bat- talion, N. G. N. Y. Basket ball is an experi- ment in military athletics, and Captain Hickok's team bids fair to set a fine example for local teams playing the game. The list of base ball candidates as published in this publication for February 6th, shows what a prominent part the Law School is destined to take in 'Varsity base ball work this spring. It might be suggested that it is in order for the management to arrange a date to be played in Albany. The University of Pennsylvania at the exer- cises on Washington's Birthday will confer de- grees on Edwin A. Abbey, the noted artist, Joseph Wharton, a prominent Philadelphia merchant and Miss Agnes Repplier, the noted literary critic. r. \,, I i ,,. /!'~ l I

NEW BUILDING FOR THE UNIVE:RSITY The bill authorizing the city of Albany to sell or lease six acres of land of the almshouse farm to Union University, which was passed by the legislature last week was approved unanimously by the Common Council of Albany Monday night. The conditions are that the building shall be erected in five years and that the Com- missioner of Public Works shall have power to superintend the outlay and maintainance of the grounds. The city will give the land and the building, which will cost about $4o,ooo and will be third in the group now including Dud- ley Observatory and the Bender Laboratory. INTE:Q-COLLEGIA TE. Harvard will have class relay switnn1ing teams. A water polo team will also be formed. Thirty-one men have reported for baseball practice at the University of Pennsylvania.

By a recent decision of the Chinese directors, all of the foreign professors at the Peking Im- perial University, except the president, Rev. W. A. P. Martin, have been dismissed. The directors' explanation is that elementary schools are most needed and they ·wish to devote their entire attention to such branches. The University of Chicago has a new edu- cational scherne on hand. This is for children to enter a kindergarten attached to the uni- versity, continue upward through school and college and graduate if they wish fro·m one of the graduate schools at least three years earlier than by the ordinary way. There is thus a great saving of time and the scheme tnay be adopted. Style Fit Wear in our Shoes S TUDENTS 'I' HE HO li~ TOJtES Patton & Hall, 229 & 245 St.ate St. ..

In observance of Charter Day recitations were suspended on Friday, February 21, and the students assetnbled in the chapel in the morning at eleven o'clock. Brief services were held a iter which Hon. Frederick~ W. Seward, '49, assistant secretary of state when his father, William H. Seward, 'zo, was secretary of state in President Lincoln's calinet, delivered an address on \Washington's Home in War Time.\ The lecture consisted for the most part of personal recollections of Lincoln. Mr. Seward said in part: \It is a good old custom that when a steamer on the Potomac. passes l\tlount Vernon, she stops her engines, dips her flag and tollc;; her bells as a salute to the Father of his Country. During the war, the ·Potomac was a scene of many a conflict, arn1ies passed to and fro and disorder and confusion reigned, but at no time during the war was any attetnpt made by either army to fortify or to occupy Mount Vernon. The sacredness of the place was inviolate and the comtnanders of either army inculcated reverence for the spot in the hea-rts of their tJ·oops. It was the one place of neutral ground in the country. When Prince J erqme Napoleon with his suite came to Washington during· the civil war he asked whether Mount Vernon was in Union or Confederate hands. He was told in neither. We could not divide the fame and reputation of Washington nor the country which he founded. ''Turning to an earlier day I ·will tell you how we spent February 21, 1861. The whole country was in a fever of unrest and alarm, as several states had already seceded. President Lincoln was elected, but not yet inaugurated, and was on his way froJ?l his horne in Illinois to Washington. On the morning of the twenty- first Senator Seward, my father, received a letter from Gen. Scott, commander of the army and Co1. Charles P. Stone, who was organizing militia to preserve order in the captol. In the letter Gen. Scott said there was a great con- spiracy to ·mob and kill Lincoln in Baltimore. Such action \vould have been easy enough for the conspirators in the great mob could have forced their way into the great crowd, fired the fatal shot and retired. \My father at once told me to proceed to meet Mr. Lincoln and give l1im t::e letter. He was to change the hour of his departure. I im.mediately started for Philadelphia. I learned that Lincoln was to stay at the Continental Hotel that night. I went up stairs to the room of Robert T. Lincoln, son of the president elect. He greeted me cordially and introduced me to Ward H. Lamon, his father's law partner. \ I waited in a secluded 1~oo1n for two hours for hhn to deliver my message. Then I heard Lincoln coming down the hall. I imtnediately recognized Lincoln from the pictures that I had seen oi him in the newspapers during the cam- paign. I gave the letter to Lincoln. He read it over, laid it down, and said: \ 'Did you hear how tl1is information was obtained. Your father .and Gen. Scott do not say who is in the plot. Did you hear any names mentioned, such a name as Pinkerton.' \He said: 'I may tell you why I ask. There were rumors before 1 started about people who wanted to do me injury. I thought noth- ing of it, but my friends hired a detective, Pinkerton, who brought the same news.' '' Lincoln then thought a few moments and said : ' Well, we haven't got to decide it tonight at any rate, and besides it is getting late, but I will promise you that I will think it over.' ''In the morning, on Washington's Birthday, Lincoln went o~er to Independence Hall and

6 'THE OONCORDI:EJNSIS. delivered a short address. When he returned to the hotel he told me that he had accepted my advice and would change his t~oute. He took the night train secretly, accompanied only hy his law partner and a few friends, and passed through Baltimo1·e several hours. before he was expected there, thus baffling tbe conspirators. Four years later another but successful attempt wa5 made upon his life, but not until he had completed his true work, until he had fulfilled his mission to humanity and until! he l1ad tssued his proclamation of emancipation.'' COLLEGE T ALH. Metzger, 'oz, was in New York for a few days last week. The thirty-third annual banquet\ of the Alpha chapter of the Alpha Zeta fraternity of the Union Classical Institute was heid Wednesday at Devine's. Frederick Edwards, C. E., instructor in Sur- veying, Drafting and Mathemathi:cs, has recently been made an associate tnember of the Ameri- can Society of Civil Engineers. Henry W.

Both clubs were well received and heartily encored. They gave the first four numbers on the prograrntne. DELTA UPSILON REUNION. The third annual reunion of the Albany Club of the Delta Upsilon fraternity win be held at the Ten Eyck Friday evening, February 28. The officers of the club are~ President, Frank H. Wood, Syracuse; vice-president, Robert J. Landon, Union '82; acting secretary and treas- urer, W. B. Aspinwall, Harvard. ALLIS·ON:-FOOTE DEBATE. On Friday ,evening, February 21, oc-curred the annual debate between representatives of the Adelphic and Philomathean literary societies. The question under debate was : Resolved, \ That the ·Question of Anarchism in this Country cannot be satisfactorily settled by Direct Legislation.\ The speakers for the Adelphic society carried off both the $5o in- individual and the society prize of $5o, Pearce, 'o3, winning the individual pt ize for making the best presentation of his side. The Adelphic debaters showed a superiority to their opponents so that the result was plain even before thejudges retired. Those who up- held the affirmative side were strong in argu- ment and efiective in delivery, and the superior leadership of Pearce won hin1 a well deserved reward. The Philomathean debaters in general did well but lacked in direct argum·ent, though Woolworth, 'o2, their readiest speaker, was at times very effective. The following were the speakers : Adel phic-a:ffirmative : George W. Donnan, '03 ; Henry A. Pearce, 'o3; Glowacki Parker, 'o3. Philomathean-negative: Dickin- son E. Griffith, 'o2; Lester W. Bloch, 'o2; GilbertS. Woolworth, 'oz. The debate was held in the State Street Methodist Chllrch, Dr. Raymond presiding, first introducing H. M. Parsons, 'oz, president of the Adelph ic society. The first speaker was G. W. Donnan, '03. He defined anarchism and said in ·part : \ Under the 1i mitations of our question all legislation rnust be direct and positive. Legislation intended to retnove causes of discontent, better social conditions, or raise the intellectual standard of the masses can- not be accepted. We must bear in mind that it must also respect the rights of the Atnerican citizen to free speech, it must be entirely satis- factory, and it must bear directly upon the anarchist himself. Any attempt to root out anarchy by force will leave the social and economic conditions unchanged. Any legisla- tion that does not improv@ the social conditions of society cannot hope to settle the question of anarchism as it is before us today.\ I: 1·.

. :'}, I: 1·. THE CONCORDlENS!S. W. H. Adam,s, 'oz, then introduced D. E .• Griffith, for the Philomathean society. \'Exist- ence of laws means that there must be a power to enforce them. I is a man'sduty to see that the anarchist cannot ·put it: to practice his violent principles. Before September last anarchism was a condition of the old world, but that it should be turned against our own government was not to be thought of for a tnon::~.ent. Many anarchists in America do not understand our governtnent but it enough for then1 that it is have done away with the lottery schemes.,, G. Parker, ~03, spoke for the affirmative : I '' We will consider two n1ethods of restrictions- restriction of the press and atnendment of the civil laws. '~But now how is it possible to define just a governm:ent, since they are enemie!it to all law and order. Socialism is evolution, anarchy is revolution. It is with extremists that laws rnust deal as they do in Europe, for anarchy is I what shall be published or not? The press is the greatest factor in the 'developtnent of Ameri• can institutions. It has grown and flourished on American soil, congress shall have no power to restrict free speech nor the right of the people to assemble peaceably. a foreign product.\ H. A. Pearce, 'o3, was the next speaker for the affinnative: \ One schetne that deals with the question is by revising the immigration laws, but we assert that any legislation aimed at the anarchists as such will not reach the root of the matter. We tnttst identify any class and anarchists are no excep' ion to the general rule. Various test questions have been devised but these have in mind the sifting out of a class. Will the violent man hesitate to lie? It remains to show that the scheme is illogical. We conld not allow that a Utopian state of affairs would settle the matter, for even in this land of the free and hon1e of the brave do in1migrants im- bibe those tendencies. \ The truth or falsity of an anarchist's reason- ing makes no difference before the law. So long as he does not advocate violence he is pro- tected by the constitution. Further restriction would overthrow the constitution and also defeat its object.\ L. vV. Bloch, 'oz, said in part: \The question of anarchy can be satisfactorily settled: First, by atnending the immigration laws; second, by amending the naturalization laws; third, by atnending the postal laws. We n1ust restrict undesirable imtnigration. We should say that any one who violates his naturalization oath is guilty of a crime and should be de- ported, for the cri tninal code provides punish- ment by fine or in1prisonment against the per- jurer. We can amend the postal laws as we \Change:; are often ntade in laws with the intention that even if they fail no serious con- sequences will result. Eut often quite negative results have followed. If a man sees before him the death penalty in any case he will bend all his energies toward success. In GO European country where the most stringent laws against anarchy J~ave been passed has there been any decrease in lawlessness.\ G. S. Woolworth, 'o2, then spoke for the Philotnatheans : \ Certain legislation can be enacted in this direction. Anarchists seek to overthrow aJ government through the head or that government. These laws now before con- gress governing and punishing complicity in crime we hold would statnp out anarchy from our country. Congress should enact that laws providing that any persons cc nfederating or in- citing to crilne should be punished by death or life imprisonment. The function of govern- ment is to protect the citizen from harm in- tended rather than to punish him for harm done.\ The judges of award were : Hon. Denis O'Brien, of Albany, Col. Robert Tetnple En1met, and Rev. John Sheridan Zelie. The office··s of the Adelphic society are: President, Howard M. Parsons, 1902 ; vice- president, Otis F. Lewis, 1903 ; secretary, Claude N. Brown, 1904 ; treasurer, Thad dens G. Cowell, 1904. Of the Philotnathean society: Presidert, W. · Hooper Adams, I 902 ; vice-president, Neilson ·c. Hannay, 1902; secretary, James A.

' ~· i 'r 8 THE CONOORDIENSIS. Again the freshman has outwitted the sopho- more. Misled by a clever ruse played on them sotne weeks since, the 1\fedical sophomores be- came fully satisfied in their own n1inds that the freshmen had sneaked a way to snme obscure corner of the city of Albany, and there had held an alleged banquet, fearful of sophotnore inter- ference. But the 1nen of 'o4 vvere .completely foiled by the careful management of the fresh- man executive cornn1ittee, who arranged the affair completely without letting even their own class-mates know of the date and place of tneet- ing until two or three days previous to Thurs- day the 2oth in st., when the banquet came off\ at the Globe Hotel, Albany. Consequently not a soph could be found within sight or hearing of the banquet hall, save one, and he, fortunat~ly for hitnself, succeeded in making his escape be- fore he could be caught. The interest rnanifested in the affair was general throughout the class, forty covers being laid, and there being just 48 n1en in the class. The toast-list follow : Toastn1aster, Edwin Barnes Wilson, Yale 1901, Hudson; '\Class of 1905,'' Walter Ennis Hays, Union 1902, of Albany; \Choledochoduodenoctomy C. W.

CONFEQENCE OF PQESIDENTS TO BE HELD AT UNION COLLEGE. For several years the newly elected presidents and secretaries of the Y. J\tl. C. A.'s of all the Eastern colleges have met for annual conference. Union College has extenned an invttation to the International Cotnmittee to hold the session of this conference in Silliman Hall. The invita- tion has been accepted and the conference will be held April 3-6 inclusive. H. L. Crain, president of the Union .Association, is now ar- ranging for the entertaintnent of the delegates wl1ich will number about seventy-five men, in- cluding the 1·epresentatives of the International Cornmittee and the leaders of the conference, together with the officers of college associations. Last year this conference met at Princeton and at Yale in 1900. Unio~ was represented at both places. JOHNS HOPKINS CELEBQA TION. On February 21 and 22 occurred the celebra- tion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the found- ing of the university, and also the installation of the new president, Dr. Ira Remsen. Fully four thousand persons were present.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 Oom. Paul. F'RO.M. 'rHE PRESIDENT OF COLUMBl.t\. [Presid.entNicbolas Mu.r1!ay Entler to Columbia Students.] [The Concordiensis had the opportunity of .obtaining another poem from the pen of the Rev. Charles S. Yedder, '51, which is of timely interest.] · CoHe.ge life should be tl1e brightest spot in the lives_ of each of you. It should be abundant in happit1:ess and inspiration. You are here not for forrnal study alone, but to come in contact with the spirit of the sciences and the arts of the ages. Y,ou sl1ould carry away as a precious possession a know ledge of the use of leisure. As Aristotle said, ''Work in order to enjoy leisure.'~ Le~t-n to enjoy the free play of hutnan spirit, which is the sign of culture today, but do not be too self-centred. Columhia does not stand and never stood for the training of narrow .men and women. It stands for that broad and 1 iberal culture which alone can make human \beings of the right sort. And has all Humanity \staggered Oom Paul? Is it reeling with horror and shame, That your foe who so blustered and swaggered, The university is essentially a den1ocratic comlnHnity. We all stand on the san1e level and a1e judged rolely by ·our work and accomp- lishment. Give sotnething that you tnay receive more abundantly. Columbia exists that it may serve the city, the state and the nation, and the student who carries away with him the fullest measure of the university's gift is he who has learned to an~wer this question, How can I learn that I may best serve? MUSICAL CLUBS CONCERT. The members of the musica1 clubs have been hard at vvork the past few weeks preparing for a nutnber of concerts to be given in the near fl.tture. Sotne tnembers of the clubs assisted at a conce1't held in the State Street Methodist Church on February 24. On Friday evening, February 28, the clubs will g1ve a concert in Centennial Hall in Albany, under the auspices of the Albany alumni. On Wednesday evening, March 5th, the clubs will give a concert in McClumpha's Opet~a House, Amsterdam. There are a large numher of Union alumni in Amsterdam who are endeavoring to make the concert a success. Oom Paul, Resorts now to famine and fl. arne? Have your women, fear-daunted and haggard, Oom P.aul, And children, been hunted as game? Have the homes where the peace of the skies, Oom Paul, Dwelt in faith of the true Hon1e above,. ·where the tenderest, sacredest ties, Oom Paul, Knew the fetterless bondage of love, Been sacked as the warrior prize, Oom Paul, Of the hawk who has throttled the dove? Has the soil which your dauntless heart flecked, Oom Paul, With fair cities and temples of grace, Whose wilderness loneness you trecked, Oom Paul, With heroes who sprang from your race, With zeal that no savage foes checked, Oom Paul, That freedom might win her new place, Is it harried and wasted and wrecked, Oom Paul, Its name of renown to efface? Yet your cause heirs the plaudit of years, Oom Paul, Though your land feels a conqueror's tread, Though your veldt be a valley of tears, Oom Paul, And billowed with graves of your dead, Still the shaft which the coming time rears, Oom Paul, Shall tell that not vainly they bled. Your hills lift their turret heads high, Oom Paul, 0 'er your plains their firm fastnesses loom, And their tempests a requiem sigh, Oom Paul, Of grief at your liberty's doom. They will stand there forever and aye, Oom Paul, As columns of light in earth's gloom, To tell how brave freemen can die, Oom Paul, And nature can fashion their tomb. -C. S. VEDDER, '51.

Sometime when the student is in the stack-room of the Library and his voice is lending its own peculiar note to the general babel let him stop and listen a moment thoughtfully, reflectively. It will then be easy for him to understand why the Library com ... mittee has announced its intention of adopting stringent measures to insure the reposeful calm and studious atmosphere usually associated with readit1g rooms in the minds.of Unenlightened Ones who have never whiled away the pleasant hours around the Big Globe, or studied the laws of harmony on the green shades. It is evident, then, that the custom 1nust be stopped of using the Library for a drawing roon\l or concert hall and confine it to the purpose for which Nature and the Faculty intended it. If the present state of affairs is not remedied soon this may be expected-adtnission to the Library will be limited to those having cards issued by pro- fessors and stating the specific work each one is to do. SIGMA PHI. To Celebrate Its Seventy-Fifth Anniversary. Sigma Phi will celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of its founding on the fourth or March. On Monday evening a reception will be held in Nott Memor-ial Hall, on Tuesday the annual convention will take place and on Tuesday night a banquet will be held. THE SNOW BALL SCRAP. The annual contest known as the '' Snow ball scrap\ bet\;veen the sophomore and fresh- man classes took place on Wednesday morning after chapel. The usual battle of snow balls rained, followed by a wild rush for the terrace. The sophomores were greatly out- numbered and consequently suffered defeat, though there was a liberal sprinkling of both classes that found themselves below the terrace unconscious of how they got there. The con- test lasted about three-quarters of an hour and was culminated with the usual attempt of each class at fonning a parade. ~ ' ' l ·; I ' ' ' '-. ,' .• ~ .. ) r, ~-,-' :~, t fl~t . . . ii\'.

He prepared fo1· college at South Berwich Serninar,y and after graduation from college he prepared for the n1.inistry under Dr. Croswell. lie was ordaine(l in 1854· During his tninisterial \vork his service covered Michi- gan and Massachusetts. '48.-Al.exander J. Thotnson, one of Sche- nectady's most widely known and oldest citizens, died on February 24 at his ho tne in this city. fraternity. He was admitted to the bar in r849, imtnediately settling in the city of New York where for two years he actively engaged in the practice oflaw. In r85r he returned to Sche- nectady, upon invitation of Judge Linn, and where he has since resided, with the exception of two years, constantly engaged in the practice of his profession, which had grown to be ex- tensive. In r 8 56 Mr. Thomson accepted a call from the faculty of Union College to deliver a series of lecture& before the members of the senior class, which he continued unt l r86r, when they were dropped from the curriculum. For a - nu1nber of years he was the corresponding sec- retary of the alumni association of his ahna tnater. From r86o to r 862 he was a tnember of the board of supervisors of Schene\.:tady county and in 1865 he went south, where in cotnpany with his brother-in-law, B. F. Mont- gotnery, he engaged in raising,cotton. Return- ing in r867, in the following year he was elected to the office of police justice. In politics Mr. Thomson was always a Alexander J. Thornson was born at Nis- kayuna, December 10, 1823. His father, James Thotnson, belonged to a family which had originally en1igrated to the United States fro1n Scotland and which had settled in Niskayuna about the year I774· His mother, Elizabeth Yates, was of the famous Yates fan1ily, a stock which has extended its branches through every department of learning, worth and excellence in the state and which figures prominently in the varied history of the Mohawk valley. His early life was spent on a fann until r832 when he moved to the city of Schenectady, where as a clerk he worked in the drug store of C. S. Joslin fron1 r838 to r84o -and also in r84o, 1841, 1842 in the postofficeunder John I. Yates and T. L. Thotnson. The lessons which he abandoned for clerical work were resumed under the excellent instruction of D. H. Crutten- den, \ill instructor of a,cknowledged merit, and after a careful preparation he in 1845 entered the sophornore class of Union CoLeg.e, from which institution he graduated with honors in r848, with Phi Beta Kappa. A1nong his classmates was President Chester A. Arthur. In 1846 and 1847, while a student at college, he staunch and sterling democrat, and a firm, earn- est and sincere advocate of den1ocratic prin- ciples. He was for some time publisher and editor of the Schenectady Democrat, a weekly newspaper published in the interest of his party. During the civil war he was a firm war <le.r.~o­ crat and a warm supporter of Lincoln's ad- tnin.istration. He did effective service, by his ardent speeches, in arousing the inhabitants of Schenectady, Saratoga and Montgomery counties to a sense of their duty. In r873 he wa:, a candidate for county judge, in 1876 he ran for congresstnan in the old Twentieth Congressional District and in the early nineties was selected by his party for assemblytnan. An interesting point in Mr. 'Thotnson'~ career is that during President Cleveland's administra-

12 'rtm OONOORDlENStS. tion he was ofiered a consulate to a Canadian city, when by the connivance of the executive's secretary the letter of acceptance was in- advertently laid aside for several weeks until the president deen1ing that his offer had not met with approbation conferred the honor else- where. Later a second consulate was offered but being tuuch inferior to the fonner one Mr. Thotnson considered it inadvisable to accept. He was also a delegate to district, state and national presidential conventions. The deceased is survived by his wife, three sons, James, Union '83, Philip Livingston, 'oo, Alex. J ., 'o5, and one daughter, Miss Helen. '64--Charles Edword Pearse, fonner .repre- sentative to Congress from Missouri, died at his home in St. Louis, January 15. Mr. Pearse was born in Oneida county, N. Y., and was graduated from Union in '63. From '63 to the end of the civil war he was actively engaged in the Union side. He was appointed captain of Sixteenth (N. Y.) Artillery and rose to tnajor in '64. In '65 he 'vas tnade provost tnarshal of East District, North Carolina. In the same year he went to St. Louis where he practiced law up to the time of his death. He was a Republican in politics and held many important offices. He was elected to the Fifty-first Con- gress and reelected to the Fifty-second. '51.-Levi Cooper Lane, M.D., LL, D., of San Francisco, died on February 18 after a long illness. Dr. Levi Cooper Lane was a nephew of Dr. E. Cooper~ one of the most famous surgeons of San Francisco's early days, in \:vhose metnory he called the great medical institution to whose founding and maintenance he gave so tnuch of his titne and substance. Dr. Lane was born in the year 1833, and after gtaduating at Union College in 185r, later attended several schools and hospital courses in Europe. With an equipment and experience up with the best of the time, he went out to San Fran- cisco in the early sixties, where his uncle, Dr. E. Cooper, had long stood in the front rank of his profession, and associated with him soon began to lay the foundation of fame as a sur- geon that made his name known on both con- tinents. In 1875 he was made a tnember of the Royal Chirurgical Society of Great Britain and was also elected to membership in other socities, both at home and abroad. Dr. Lane's whole life was one of constant effort for the enlargetnent of knowledge in his profession, and the lessening of the ills and sufferings of humanity. This desire, in part, found practical and per- manent manifestation in the founding of the great 1nedical school with which he vvas so long identified. The project was conceived not long after the death of his uncle, Dr. Cooper, whose name and fame he with grateful heart deter- mined to tnark in this n1anner. To this end he put by each year in sacred trust a most generous part of his large income gained by his eminent abilities in his practice, until in the late 7o's the sum in h;1nd was sufficient to start the enter- prise. The organization was effected and in due time the magnificant structure known as the Cooper Medical College reared its imposing dimensions on the corner of Sacramento and Webster streets in San Francisco. Dr. Lane was the president and the first in- cutnbent of the chair of surgery, and for the twenty years following continued to fill that position, until sotne two years ago, when failing health demanded his retirement from active duty in the lecture rooms. The Lane Hospital, esta?Iished six years ago, and called by the eminent surgeon by the insist- ence of his admiring friends and associates, is another grand monument to Dr. Lane's high standing as a practitioner and his practical ideas as a philanthropist. The good done and yet to be done by these two institutions, which owe theit existence to Dr. Lane is inestimable. '67.-Dr. Teunis S. Hamlin of the Church or the Covenant, Washington, D. C., is giving a series of Lenten lectures on the second part of Prophecy of Isaiah on Wednesday afternoons, beginning with Ash Wednesday, February I 2.

'· :·. l .. \. Harmon Potter, pastor O>f the First Church of Christ of Hartford, responded to the toast ''The American College man.\ Mr. Potter said in part: '' It is through the kindness of your very generous :policy that I find n1yself pern1itted to be enrolled a n1ember of this club, fortunately, you do not ask the circurnstances of a man's leaving your altna mater ·when you grant your me.tnbership. It is enough if he was once able these 2 50 years by the toil, the service and sacri- fice of all those who in any institution, academic or collegiate have labored for their discipline of the 111ind and the culture of the soul of those who shall constitute America~ citizenship. As the eldest sisters of the fellowship, bearing most loyally its virtues and its graces are those two New England shrines of learning, reaching on through the third century of their lives today, to honor one of which we have gathered tonight, included also in this fellowship is the younger group of eastern collpges, that studlike gems the rocky fasfness or these New England hills and g1eatns as jewels along the valleys of the tniddle and central states, of which my own alma mater, Union, is proud to be coun ed as to get within her protecting walls. Moreover you grant fellowship of the Yale spirit to all who in any of the departments of the university have been permitted, though never so briefly, to drink something of your kindly n1other's strength and inspiration. I speal<: as one who by this kindness is pennitted to stand among you, and can call bitnself a Yale man only by virtue of the breadth and warmth of the Yale spirit which gives itself without stint and be- stows itself without parshnony upon all Ameri- can college men who may desire to share her benefit. For you do nat ask me to t·enounce my allegiance to my own beloved acaden.1ic Alma Mater, that I may share with you our common devotion to the great university to whose spirit we bring our homage tonight. Did Webster say of Dartmouth, ' She is. a little college but there are those who love her?' There are thousands who can say of Union., and there are tens of thousands who can say, each of his own fair alma mater, ' She is a little college and therefore we love her.' For the American col- lege man is loyal to his own college, whatever be the influences that in later life are thrown around hirn, whateYer be the largeness of the associations and privileges that are granted hhn, 1 he is loyal forever to that college and those men who :first opened for him the pathway of truth, who first stirred for hitn the noblest enthusiasms, and who first enlisted him in serious life with earnestness of purpose and devotion to loftiest ideals. J?ach remembers the songs of one place, the history, the traditions, and the metnories of one campus, the friendships, the fellowships and the con1rads of one brother- hood. '' It is the At11erican college buil r up through one.\ '98-Charles H. Kilpatrick, graduate manager of the University of Wisconsin track team, who is the charnpion half-mile runner of the world, has been the recipient of laurels in Chicago, where his teatn, on February 14, to the complete sur- prise of Chicago, carried off the honors to the score of 47 to 30 in the athletic contests in that city.

14 ALBANY LAW SCHOOL. Bryan, '03, visited friends in New York city recently. The members ofDe'lta Chi banquetted at Troy on Friday evening the 21st inst. The marriage of Ezra A. Barnes,. 'oz, to Miss Sn1ith, of vV atertown, N. Y., ha:s been an- nounced. Luther S. Lakin, Jr., of Jame&town, N.Y., has entered the senior class, and Jason C. Cook, of Troy, N. Y., the junior class. There are now 136 men in the Law School- 2 post graduates, 79 seniors and 55 juniors. They are divided by states as follows ; New York, 123 ; Connecticut, 5 ; Illinois, 2; Porto Rico, 2 ; Massachusetts, K~entucky, ICansas and Rhode Island, one each. As but 2 I of these come fron1 Albany and 7 fron1 1'roy, it is seen that the school is in no sense a local institution, which fact speaks most etnpathically for its ever-broadening influence. Mr. Stephen B. Griswold delivered a series of four lectures to the juniors and. one-year men on February r8-2r on ''Books and Tl1eir Uses.\ Mr. Griswold, being both ~l member of the bar and Law Librarian in the New York State Library, is well qualified to deliver lectures of this character, and his remarks proved to be of great interest to the students. This course finds a place in the curricula of few if any law schools outside of the Albany Law School, and is one of the especial ad- vantages afforded the student at this institution. There are now two \ Moot-Court Clubs'' so- called, among the juniors, instead of one. The orga.nization of the latest society of this character was perfected on Friday .evening the 21st inst., and a case will be tried before the '' Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the Depart- ment of Law of Union University\ on the even- ing of March r st. The arrangernent decided upon calls for a regular rotation in office, so that each metnber of the club will have equal opportunity to argue the cases, and sit on the court that decides other cases. The present n1embership of the club includes Messrs. Law- less, Mills, Rogers, ~asellas, Guardineer, Hotaling, Foster, Dyer, B. E. Smith, Nicholas DeVoe, Milton DeVoe, Thomas Odwell and Branch. The membership is only limited to those who show a desire to perfect themselves in legal argument, and other members of the class who are so inclined will be welcomed most heartily.

BASEBALL CAPTAIN. At a meeting of 1 he 'varsity baseball team held on Thursday, February 20, Eve ett T. Grout, 'o2, of Cooperstown was elected captain of the team to fill the vacancy caused by Capt. Mal ery having left college. Captain Grout has been on the 'varsity teatn for three years past, playing third base and shor. stop, and is a good player and will undoubtedly turn out a winning teatn. He will issue a call for candidates in a few days. T'he prospects are for a very success- ful season. LITERA~Y NOTE. The character sketch in the March Review of Reviews is devoted to the interesting personality of the president of Harvard University. Mr. George P. Morris, the author of the sketch, tells how narrowly President Eliot escaped a career in commerce and finance by accepting an academic position at a time when the treasur- ship of a cotton mill was open to him ! The article develops in~to a keen analysis of the renutrkable administrative abilities displayed by the dean of our university presidents, and there is also a discriminating criticisn1 of Dr. Eliot's literary qualities. SENIOR CLASS BOOK. The class book con11nittee of the senior class held its first n1eeting on Tuesday afternoon at the Chi Psi lodge.
