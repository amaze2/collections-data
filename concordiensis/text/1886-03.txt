BURROWS, SCHENECTADY, N.Y. EDITORIAL. JT is with pleasure that we note 1nanifestationb J · ·of new life ,in near 1 y every n1atter which per- tains to the welfare of Old Union. For the past two years affairs.have been not only at a stand- still, but at titnes ~eetned to be going hack. Hovvever, the tide haf) turned, anc.l now the pros- pects of the college are decidedly brighter. 2_'h~ _. c.~~~~f a better English deparbnent, the newly catalogwr1\il5ra-1·y revised univei:s1ty catalogue, revised curriculum and the first step against the titne-honored, unfair n1arking sys- tetn, .are all evidences of progres.s in the right \lirection. No\v if the .trustees would hurry up and eleCt: a· president we'd sing ''The threaten- ing cloud has passed away,\ and yell U-n-i-o-n, hz'kah, hikah, hikah louder than ever. W E ask those who are not deep enough to cornprehend our weighty editorials, not to give their versions of the articles as op1n1ons and criticis1ns of ours. If a translation or key is needed it will be cheerfully given to any one calling at the smi.Ctutn; but we tnost decidedly protest agai11st reading black, white· or conclu- ding that a criticistn on class decorun1 1neans that the ttustees have eleCted a new President. We ask t~1at the editorials n1a y he understood to say just what they do say, nothing tnore. I s it not an oversight on the; part of the faculty to ornit the general and official announce- n1ent of certain tneasures taken in faculty n1eet- ing? We are not si1nple enough to ask that all that is done in faculty n1eeting he tnade known to the students, but certain steps vv hich n1aterially concern the students are tnade known only by vagu(:; and unauthentic run1ors. If we have a right conception of faculty 1neeting-s they are not dread secret conclaves in vvhich plans are laid to catch the lax, unwary student, but are tneet- ings in which are discussed n1atters of in1port- ance to the student, and to the college in general. Then why would it not be a good plan to an- nounce in· the class roo1n or on the bulletin board such tneasures as affeCt: the student body? It would do away vvith nunor and give the students better infonnation of the rules and regulations to which they are subjeCt. T HE success which attended the efforts of. the Glee Club in conneCtion vvith the college fair is tnost gratifying. It not only proves that there is tnaterial enough in college to produce acceptable n1usic, but that even vvith our old Dorpian drovvsiness, we tnay sufficiently arouse ourselves to forn1 a real live glee club, one which appears not only in the Garnet, but on the stage. This little experience· in tnusical

It is to be hoped that the Glee Club • 1nay becotne a pennanent fixture. It is now alrnost too late in the season to attetnpt to go further, but vve would advise the club to lose no ti1ne next fall, but to begin practice as soon as possible. 'I~he class of '89 has excellent tnater- · ial and plenty of it, and it will be expeCting very little of '90 to fill the gap n1ade by the gradua ... tion of '86. T HERE is probably no one of the nurnerous changes 1nade by the faculty this year that so tnuch protnotes the best interests of the stu- dents and at the satne tiine n1eets with their general approbation, as the recent change in the marking systetn. Expressed in few words the new regulation is : That the student shall no longer receive his marks. We think we are safe in saying that the in11nediate effect of this regu- lation will be, first, to secure better work fro1n the students ; there will be no longer any calcu- lating of 111argins and limiting the work to the attainrnents of a certain standing; second, the ill-feeling which son1eti1nes necessarily arose under· the old systetn, both against the Professor and fellow students because of sotne real or sup- posed injustice in tnarking V\rill be ren1oved; third, the practice of endeavoring to in- fluence a Professor to change tnar.ks will be abandoned. The accon1plislunent of any one of these ends without considering the tnany other advantages that are to be expected would l-e sufficient ground for the adoption of the new regulation. T HE annual catalogue though capable of in1- provetnent is n1uch superioT to those of the past tew years. The addition of the other parts of the University, and the new arrangernent, af- ford an opportunity of just co1nparison with other institutions, which was not afforded by the preceding ones. The otnission fron1 the class 1 ist, of the students who have left college, \ve think is a very sensi- ble change. The long list of fonner n1en1bers were of a little value, and an objeCt of Tidicule. The revision and conneCtion of the ''Depart- tnents of Instruction,\ and the general college regulations., which 1nake up the body of the ''college\ parts of the catalogue is perhaps the tnost needed, and consequently 1nost in1portant itnprovetnent. The ''latest work of fiCtion\ chestnut has fonnerly had a great deal of truth in it, and it is a source of great satisfa.Ction to have 1nany of these old tirne-worn expressions o1nitted. One of the 1nost praCtical refonns consists of rnaking the text books in the catalogue· confonn with those in use. Many tnistakes have hereto(ore been tnade because of the publi- cation of text books in the catalogue which had notbeen used for several years. The absence of an instruCtor in the depart- ment of Political Econon1y 1night give one, un- acquainted with the circun1stances, a bad irnpres- sion of the work done in that deparhnent, while the facts are that it has been quite thorough for several years. A nun1 ber of apparently accidental errors tnar the general good charaCter of the book. Mr. Griswold, '85, is the n1ost protninent sufferer having been deprived of the Warner Prize and a Phi Beta Kappa key; both of which he secured last year. With the exception of these which seetn a littl~ too nu1nerous the general character and ·arrangement of the catalogue is very good and the cotnpilers are entitled to con- siderable credit for their work. T liE new rule regulating the use of books in the college library, while an advantage in one direction is a decided disadvantage in an- other. As we understand it, the objeCt of the regulation. is to insure professors and students, who require frequent access to books of refer- ence, the certainty of finding those books in the library any titne they n1ay need then1. P1·ac- tically speaking the new regulation cuts off all access to books of fiCtion. Very few men would atte111pt any course of reading vvhen it 1nust be done within set hours and in a cotntnon roo1n. We would suggest that only such books as the faculty n1ay pronounce books of reference be subject to the present reBtriCtions. .'i' \ .

.. ~ ' .l'f' ' - \ . THE CONCORDIENSIS. 55 COMMUNICATIONS. In glancing over the new catalogue, we were son1ewhat disappointed to find that there was no . indication of the study of Greek and Latin being made optional at ·the beginning of the Junior year. Although sublime and truly poetical are tnany of the ancient Greek authors, and \'Hor- ace\ is so1newhat '~playfur' when you discover his joke, it seetns to be the opinion of the clas- sicals, that at the end of the Sophotnore year we have long enough pulled up Greek and Latin roots frotn the nurseries of antiquity; and· while · . we will delight to tnuse upon the beauty of an- . cient dratnatists and thei~· portrayal of character, and feel the dici pline is decidedly great, never- theless think we might dig up sotne new treasure frotn the tnines of learning which will have perhaps as lasting and as practical a value. A CLASSICAL. [''CLASSICAL\ rnakes a n1istake in assutning the present curriculun1 to be pennanent. Next year when the ne'\v curricuhnn is introduced Greek and Latin n1ay be optional during the Junior year.-EDs.J Although the object of the college fair was to obtain n1oney to tneet the expenses for base-ball and athletics, a result far 111ore itnportant than this was accornplished-the pro1notion of good feeling between the citizens and the students, and the creation of universal enthusias1n for col- lege sports atnong the students thernselves. Let this enthusiastn be turned into the riglrt channel and not waste itself by being scattered over a dozen different plans. Assisted by the ladies of the town, the students as a body have rnade the tnoney, and of course have the right to spend it as the n1ajority wish ; but in the praiseworthy desire to be econo1nical, care should be taken not to be niggardly. Last year the nine was crippled by lack of necessary apparatus and of substitutes. We should have three substitutes, and these should be assured of being .taken on the trip as a reward for praCticing and also in order to gain experience for next vear ·when \' ' they '\vill probably take the places of the n1en who nov{ are seniors. Moreover, we need three substitutes for practicing, in order that three 1nen rnay be at bat and do base-running, and the other nine tnay play their regular positions in the field, and by alternation gain both batting and fielding practice, and thus follovv the exarn- ple of professional nines. We can thereby have a rnuch better nine ; and although the expense will be sornewhat greater, our gate receipts will be n1ore than proportionately increased by our in1proved playing. We have enough n1oney to run the nine vvell and still have a surplus; and, therefore, while believing thoroughly in econ- on1y, as last year's financial 1nanagernent shows, I do think that no expense should be spared which can irnprov,e our playing in the slightest degree. Another, and perhaps the n1ost irnpor- tant way of giving general satisfaCtion and thus· increasing our gate receipts, is to go into train- ing. Yon all have the right to detnand that the representatives of the college in anything do their best; and no\V is the tirne to establish a precedent and rnake it the regular thing for base- ball In en to be as vigorously trained as runners or 1nen1 bers of a crew. Unless we train we can not hope to gain first place in the league, and n1ay take only third, or perhaps not even so high ; but if vve do train \Ve not only 1nay take first place, but tnay·give to the college the pleas- ure of seeing so1ne garnes with other and better clubs than any in our league. We do not say this in a boastful spirit, but only because we k~1ow that. training along \vith con11non sense Vvill accornplish wonders. If three substitutes are kept in practice the nine vvill be crippled little, if at all, next year; but another source of players for the nine, and of interest to all, is the class gan1es. As soon as the Gltllpus is in condition for use. the sched- uled gan1es should be played and hurried through with~ so as not to int~rfere '\vith the prac- tice of the nine. If the gan1es vvere to begin at four in the afternoon. plenty of titne '\vould be given for finishing, and the nine could practice before four o'clock, and thus neither gatne -vvould interfere with the other. We have lately seen that as soon as the students arc certain of a regular class in the gyn1nasiurn ..

THE CONCORDIENSIS. a large nutnber con1e in on praCtice days and take vigorous exercise ; but on the other days only a few attend. It is, therefore, plain that the candidates for next year's nine should begin their work in the fall, not only in order to de·· velope thernselves, but to keep alive the interest in athletics. A number of n1en who1n you would scarcely suspect of having any athletic .atnbition have already, by our little work this spring, had the steeping lion within thetn aroused and intend to devour so1ne of our hest athletes on field-day, and unless the latter look to their laurels they will be utterly consurned. As it is irnpossible to tell how n1a~y athletes there are in college until a test is 1nade, and as steady praCtice will tnake a n1an skillful in alrnost anything, the principle upon which we should 1nanage athletics is to interest everybody RO as to 1nake the1n show their powers, and if nobody is very proficient at present to encourage those who are naturally inclined to exercise by 1naking their work enjoyable and by s1nal1 prizes in the contests which, though of sn1all in- trinsic value, yet recall pleasant associations and are constant ren1inders of the field-day. Ath letics help base-ball and n1ake the exercise of the nine 111ore enjoyable, and should be encour- aged in every way in order to 1nake the college take as high a rank as possible in her principal sport.

No tneda[s are -to be given this year. The co1n1nittee on field-day have received an appropriation and are now 1naking preparations for the event. The recent fair seems to have awakened additional zeal arnong students, both in base- ball 1natters and in general athletics. The '' gyn1\ is now too stnall for the large class. There is much talk of the nine going into striCt training, boarding together, etc. The new catalogue of the University is out. The printer has been changed, as has also been the general 1nake up of the catalogue itself. A noticeable change is the otnission of the cusot- Inary list of students left college. Its appeal·- ance upon the whole we think has been tnuch irnproved. 1 1 The .following resolution fron1 the Faculty has\ i at last appeared on the bulletin board : / : ~ Resolved, That 11erea.fter the grade of a student in( any departrnent shall be announced o1zly in the follow-1 ing manner: First grade whose marks are 9 or over.

A discharge of cannon at the setting of a golden summer sun in July, proclaitned to an enthusiastic people, that another anniversary of their independence was gone to be ntunbered with the past. Perfect order and sobriety were maintained throughout the day, notwithstanding a larger concourse of people than usual had been assembled to witness the celebration. But when the shades of night began to darken upon the joyous city, the better portion of comtnunity re- tired within their dwellings, leaving the streets in full possession of a noisy and motley tnob. It was at this titne, when returning to my own · habitation, I was forced to push tny way through , a large crow .. d which had colleCted at one of the corners of the street. Loud shouts of laughter greeted tny ears .as I approached, tningled with the harsh notes of anger and defiance. Being curious to learn the cause of the strife between · the two combatants, I endeavored to catch a : glitnpse of the parties. But what was my as- tonishrnent, at beholding one of my tnost inti- mate friends struggling in the embrace of a tnaniac dwarf. The eagerness he tnanifested in freeing hilnself fron1 his etnharrassing situation, together with the pale terror on his brow, had excited the unrestrained 1nirth of the noisy as- setnbl~g~. At last, with a desperate effort he succeeded in. rescuing hitnself frotn the clutches of his terrific looking adversary; and hurried away in the direCtion in which I was standing. I seized his ann while in the aCt of passing tne. With a countenance expressive of the tnost vio- lent etnotions, he slowly turned around as if fearful of again n1eeting the loathson1e objeCt fron1 which he had just now escaped. Calling hin1 by nan1e, he instantly recognized tne, when grasping tny ann with altnost supernatural force, he whispered in a deeply agitated voice that we should itutnediately leave the place. The crowd had in the tneanwhile enlarged the circle, for the purpose of affording tnore space for the dwarf to perfonn his extravagant and furious gestures. For a n1ornent, the tniserable being seelned to have forgotten, with the absence of the object of his spite, the cause of his contest with hitn. But when by the disturbance we unavoidably tnade, while forcing our way through the dense tnass which surrounded us, his attention again becatne directed towards tny friend; his frantic rage in11nediately returned with redoubled force, and hobbling as fast as his distorted lirnbs would pennit, he quickly ap- proached us. The crowd, by changing their position, accidentally left a stnall opening into which we darted, but not before the harsh voice of the dwarf raised to a wild yell, bore to our ears the tnalignant prophecy that h~ would still be the cause of a horrible death to his opponent. Having succeeded in extricating ourselves

THE CONCORDIENSIS. frotn our unpleasant situation, I endeavored to rally rny cotnpanion on his first attetnpt of atnus- ing the public with the gladiator style, in which he had entered the lists with the dwarf. But no sn1ile illun1.inated his countenance at tny trifling levity, and a closer pressure on 1ny ann warned tne that at this tnotnent it was entirelv out of \' place. After a short .silence, tny cotnpanion in- terrupted the current of tny thoughts by asking 1ne whether I had heard the terrible prophecy of the fiend-for so he tenned the dwarf. I an- swered hitn, I had. \That prophecy,\ he con..- tinued,. while his \\.Thole fratne was convulsed with agitation, and large drops of svveat started out on his forehead, ''that prophecy will be ful- filled upon tne. I atn convinced of it, and no earthly power can shake 1ny belief. Die I 1nust, and die by the tneans of that horrid, loathsotne wretch. Oh, God! I fear I shall go tnad, but it tnust be, it tnust be-the fates have destined tne to becon1e the victirn, and I cannot escape.\ He drooped his head ~n tny shoulder, and a scald- ing tear fell upon my hand. Hov\'·ever effetninate · it tnay appear to those who read this relation, that a n1an endowed with the least share of that In oral. firmness which is generally a charaCteris- tic of the sex, should wotnan-like, weep at the hannless threats of an inoffensive wretch, yet had they known n1y friend as I knew hirn, in- stead of ridiculing hitn for this tunnanly action, they would nave been the first to have sytnpa- this.ed with hitn in his feelings. that attraCted universal adrniration. Dazzling as were the. talents and person of this favorite child of fortune, there was one weak point in his character which . although skillfully concealed for the present, was at so 1ne future day to crurn:_ . ble the whole of the fair :fabric to ato1ns. An:x;-. iously had it been watched by our aged tutor, •· and often had he adtnonished his beloved pupil of its withering effect. It was the want of .tnor- ai finnness. Indecision of character was be- trayed in Danforth's aCtions while a tnere school · boy, and it had also grown wtth his growth. This to a tn•ind like his was ruinous ; for of an ardent and nervous tetnperatnent, liable to be wrought upon by any circtunstances whatever, · and deeply tinged by superstition, the wcp1t of it . would in his case be deeply and severely felt. His life had thus far been unchequered ~y a ~ single tnisfortune, and his situation had been such as not to have betrayed this his only failing. · But it was with fearful forebodings that I watched that tutnult of the soul-that struggle _ of th~ passions which shook the fonn of n1.y c~)lnpan­ ion. An indelible itnpression had beenstan1ped on his tnind that he should becotne the victirn of the dwarf. His prophecy still rung in his ears, and although his good sense taugl:t him ·b1e folly of his belief, yet he possessed. not suf- ficient tnoral courage to conquer his infatuation. Accident had thrown hin1 into contact with the dwarf, when unfortunately endeavoring to shun the defonned rnonster, he had unwittingly struck hin1, and thus cotntnenced that struggle which laid the foundation of sotne awful and distressing Harry Danforth had ever been tny boso1n friend. Years .had rolled over our heads since we were in tna tes of the san1e school, and yet the intitnacy which had there been formed still con- centrated in strength. There was sotnething strangely fascinating in the character of Dan- · forth. An individual could not converse with hitn, for any length of titne, without feeling that he was in the presence of one of no ordinary stamp. Talented and accotnplished, he associa- ted with 1nen of the highest respectability, and in the drawing roon1, when his dark eye re- · fleeted with brilliancy the intelligence of his soul, and his countenance becatne flushed with the excite1nent of the tnotnent, there was a grandeur in his person and a nobleness in his deporbnent, scenes. * * * * * * * The carol of the birds, as they vvitl}essed the departure of a Septetnber sun behind ~h_e far. ;_C?.tf hills, broke L.Ipon the stillness of the evening vv,~t~1 its sweet and tender 1ne!od y.

It was under- taken as a rather perilous venture, but with the aid of the ladies of the city, and the liberal pat- ronage of the students· it resulted tnost creditably to the cotn111ittee having it in charge. Frotn the very beginning the ladies took an aCtive interest, and it is needless to say that without their co- operation and effeCtive assistance nothing could have been accornplished. Although all the col- lege 1nen, who took part, did thetnselves ·credit, it is not to then'l alone that the success is due, but thE: thanks of the students should be, and are, given to all the citizens of ScheneCtady who 1nanifested their interest in the college so wil- lingly, and with such good results. On the first evening the attendance was good, and increased with every successive evening .. The hall was decorated with base-ball bats, tennis rackets, lacrosse sticks, sculls and other student paraphernalia. Military rifles were stacked on each side of the stage. The booths, with their fair attendants, were so attraCtive as to assure success and large attendances. Near ·the stage was a gypsy tent in charge of the ladies, where vv as revealed to the happy student his future life. The ''fish pond\ and rifle range were also strong att~·acrions. Supper was served every evening at 6 o'clock and was pat- ronized and enjoyed by every one·. These tables under the ladies kindly charge, were, perhaps, the tndst profitable part of the fair. On the first evening the exercises began with the popular quartette song ''Sweet and Low\ rendered by Misses Feltham and Hickok and Messrs. Randall and Woodbridge. F .. X. Rans- dell sang a solo, entitled ''Sailing,'' in a credit- able rnanner~ The College Glee Club made a splendid itnpression with their songs, and were encored again and again. The farce '' Wooing Under J)ifficulties\ was presented by Misses Felthatn,. Hickok and Nore1nac, Messrs. Darey, Ransdell, Dorwi n and Very. An enjoyable part of the entertaintnent was the appearance of the ''Union Blues\ who drilled perfectly, and whose songs and manceuvres particularlY. delight- ed the audience. The second evening's entertainment began with a song, \The Winds are All Hushed,\ ex- cellently rendered by a quartette consisting of Messrs. Culver, Woodbridge, Voorhees and Randall. Then followed pole vaulting, jtunping and trapeze perforn1ing, under charge of Prof. Vanderveer. Following this ca1ne a- solo, '•The Midshiptnite,\ by RandalL The farce of the evening was entitled \My Uncle's Will,\ and was adtnirably given by Miss Feltham and 1\!Iessrs. Dorwin and Very. On the last evening Miss Kingsley of Boston delighted the audience by a piano solo, and Mr. Woodbridge sang in a happy manner, the solo ''Farewell Forever\ and responded to an en- core with ''McSorley's T-vvins.\ The \Union Blues\ and the Glee Club appeared again and upheld the .reputation they gained on _the first evening. The event of the evening was the Japanese opera bouffe, in which the Mikado airs appeared with great effect. It was ~iven by Misses Felthatn and Withers and Messrs. Very, Ransdell and Angle. Miss Withers has an alto voice of rare quality and tnade a splendid iin- pression. To Miss Felthatn, who is an an1ateur aCtress of no little tnerit, 1n uch of the success of the theatrical entertaintnent is due.
