' THE CONCORDIEN:SIS 7 N. Y,. S.. I. A. UNION. Important Matter·s Decided at the Re,gular Serni- A~nn ual Meeting. The regular semi-annual meeting of tne N. Y. S. I. A. Union eo,mpose'd at present of Colga:te,. H:am- iilton, Roch·ester, Hobart anJ Union was held. re- cen.tly at Utica. Union's delegation consisted -of Dr. J\tleComber, R. T. Ury and M. King.. 1he m.eeting was an important one and indicated th.at the Union is growing in strength and pr~Oinin:ence in the collegiate affairs of the State. Va.rtous con.- ·stitution.al change·s were pr:oposed and adopted. Banners were awarded and plans outline·d for a tra:ek me·et to be helJ unde:r the a.uspi:ces o[ t'he Union on March 22. The action of the awar.d committee in de·ci<lfing that a champ:onship track banner b~· a·warded to Colgate was a matter of much coRtFOV€rsy. Colgate maintained that she had held t:he Ineet in full accord w.ith the instructions of the lJnion, aRd that Hamilton and Rochester had faHecl to Rppear on the .day of the m·c·et and in co·nsequence tlle meet was won ~by Colgate through forfeiture. Ha.milton a,nJ Roch·ester both n1aintatned that due notice of their with.dra wal had been sent tD Colgate. Th·a actio·n of the com1nittee :n awar.ding the banner was finally recinded. The ba~eball championship pennant f.Dr the season of ·19·08 was awarded to Union, and the football pennant was awarded to Rochester, after Colgate had withdrawn her claims. An important change in the constitution was adopted when it was Jecide.d that a student -wto enters an college after being a student at some ·Other college shall not be permitted to partici- pate in the athletic-s. of the Union until h. e has been a member of the· college he repr.esents for one year. Thi-s provision will have a tendency to do away with the alleged practiee of certain colleges who offer special induceme:ats to atbletes o-f other institutions to beeome a member Df their particula.r college. It was d'ecided to hold a track meet 11nd -er the auspices of the Union on May 22. The rneet will be held ~n all probability on the· Utica Field {Jlubjs .oval, anJ all tneinbe.rs of the Union will coml)ete. . to be p·ermitted to partiei'pate in the meet was grantHd-, and d·oubtless other reputable colleges not me1mbers of the Unidn will be invited to com- pete. The athletic committee was impow·ered to ar- range for all neetings of college manage-rs. This ·it is contem;p[iated will do a way with much con· fusion and .conflict which has perhaps resulted from th·e old p~an of allowing the various managers to arrange for such mre-eting. It was also decided that the an.nual du·es ·Of each coll~g.e ($~5 fo·r each sport .engage.d in) need not be paid this y'ear. DR.A1MATIC CLUB MEETING. The newly o:rganized dramatic club rnet in Silli- man Hall on Friday evening, and decided on a play to ha given at the V~n Curler Opera House during the spring· term, probably at Commence- ment tim·e. The quesUon of a name was con- side-red, and many favored naming the organiza- tion the Stage and Curtain, though the name has not been definitely decided upon. Candidates for the· play are requ·ested to r·egis- ter with President Wachter at once, as rehear- sals for the production of the play will •being this week. Eleven charactHrs a·re to be chos,en, and keen rivalry is anticipated, as many have signified their intention of coming out for the club. There is e.very reason to expect that a per- manetly successful dramatic club ta.s been start- ed, and that Union will now stand with the other· small colleges in this · f'cspect. For .enduring success the club needs the co· operation of all members of the College, faculty and students alike, and no one should neglect an oppo-rtunity o·f giving it aid and encouragement. TENNIS. nr. McComber vras· jj}ected a men1ber JG:f the com.- The outloo1{ for a first-class tennis team this year is very bright. Five nren who play·ed on the team last year are ba,ck in College, and the Freshmen class is confidently expected to yield muc.h promising material. A captain for the coming s·aa.son will probably he elected in a few days. A call for c.and!idates for the· tean1 will then be issued as soon as the courts can be gotten in shap·e. The manage~m·ent is working on the sche.dnle mittee which will ·have charge of the arrange- ments. T'he request. O·f St. Lawrence Univ~ersity and it will probably be completed shor·tly. '

Richmond's principles and let us 1nake this Spring Term and this Couune·n<·entent thP bPst the College hnR ever PxperiPneed. :BASEBALL PROSPECTS. Although a is -too early jn the season to get ~ny definite idea of Union's baseball t~am of 1909, still, if the interest which has been n1anifested a.bout the hill since Captain Bergan returned to College can be taken as ~n inJication, Old Union will again turn out a team which will win the pennant. Indoor pr:I ctice has been in vogue in c- e Gyn1 for over a week and t~1e number of fres~1men who have come out gives· promise of a lively contest fe-r all positions. Outdo·o·r practice was begun Wednesday and from that time until April 14th, the date of the fir.st game a:t We~:;t Point, th·e team will be round- ed into shape. It is und•erstood that there a.re .many go·od base- ball men in the .Albany de·partment of the Uni- veTsity and a sp.ecial effort will be maJe th:s year to bring these men out and make the team repres-e·nta.tive of the University. King '08, who is in the Albany Law School, is counted on to hold down his old position at first, ~~-- · There will be seven me·m berg nf last year's team back at their old positions for the early out-door practice and they w:ll be har.d at work to reta.in th·eir old positions. The members of la.st year's team are: Pitch- ers, Dunn and Stewart; first base, A. King; sec- ond ba.se, Mackey; short .stop, Perry; tliird ·base, Bergan; right field, La·J.ue.

March ·rE.Rd a paper on the subject, \Dar- win.\ Dr. March began the paper with an ac- count o.f Darwin's early life. The great scientist, having plenty of money, became quite a sports- man and was especially fond of hunting. He spent two years in a me.dical college,. but· made an utter fa.ilure cf the worl\, anJ finally decided to tal\e up theology. Failing to become a minister, he went to college at Cambridge, where after fo·ur years, he wit1 difficulty succeeded in o 1Jtaining tr. e degree of A. B. Darwin at la~:t becam·e interested in geolo~y, and joined a party of naturalists that was sent tJ South America. by the English government. Dr. March then told of Darwin's mino-r work:; and achievements. His discussion of Darwin's most important worl{S, \The Descent of Man,'' and \The Or!gin of the \Species\ was complete and interesting. He outlined Darwin's theory and said that although it met with. great opposi~ tion at first, it has come to be universally ac· .cepted and has placed its propounder among the fore~most s-cientists of . the nineteenth century. Thera are a few divisions of the theo.ry, espec- ially t'· e treat~ent of the theory of natural selec- tion, wr.ich are still seriously questioned by mod· ern scientists.

For another yea-r our basketball tea:m has had rather an unsucc·essful season. At the ·beginning of the year everything looked prosperous with six m.en out who had won their U's, in previous years and a good supply of Freshmen material and an excellent co•ach in the person of G·eorge Tilden. Our first two games were away from home against two of our strongest rivals and it was not until we played Rochester, the c11ampions of the league, that Coach Tild·cn had an oppo-rtunity to see how the team was working. After that the team got t•ogether bette·r, and, although they lost ga.mes away from home· by close scores, managed to b·eat Ha1nilton and Hobart in our two remaining home games. From the results of this year's worl\:, it wo11l rl be well to arrange more- home games next year and start off with w·ea.ker teams. CAPT. BROWN. were discussed.

THE CoNCORDIENSIS VOL. XXXII. UNION COLLEGE, APRIL 17, 1909 No. '20 THE RE~LATION Q.F THE SCHOOL OF ENG!- NEERIN.G TO UNION COLLEG,E. Union College is practically divided into two camps·, -w:hich, if regarde·4 from the standpoint, not of 'Personal friendship (there is plenty of that~ I a1n happy to say), bUt of educational values, R-1'0 . ' antagonistic,. in some degree at least. A ·certnJn incorr1patibility of adjustment on educational lines exi,sts, and ha·s for som·e tin1e been auf)ar cnt ·between these two bodie~;. I re.fer to the ' engineering school on the one fhand and on ~hd other to what may be called the college proper. Tbe latter in1d udes the c-ourses w'hich lead to the degrees of A. B., Ph. B., an.d B. S. Thjs incon1- patibility is, as I take it, one of the chief difficu1- ties in the problem of building up the colh·~·3 proper. I do not believe that the lattr:r can pros- per while the two are welded together, as it wer·o, into one whole. I do not m·e.an that the two can not flgurish side by side, but merely that tlF~y ~hould be ke,pt distinct, so that when Union 0o1- 1ege is n1.entioned .tile name should not be thouo·bt of as including the s·ehool of engineering, anv more than it is regarded as inclusive of t'h2 ln '\V school o·r the medieal college. The reasr:>n for thts is that the ·cp.aracteristic purpose of tb(• co1- 'lege pr01)er is esl:lentially different from tl:at of any one of the schools just referred to. T:h.e col- lege is, or should be, non-professional. Its vur- pose. is, not to train men for .any one calling or av-ocation, but to fit them in a gBn:eral way for life, leaving them to ·choose their life-work innf'- pendently of any special training that might hB arranged with particular reference to the future. The busine:ss· of the Ani'erican College is, so far ~A:~ possible, to make .all-round n1en, in ·contra- distinction to spe·cialists. ·This is what is meant by a liberal ~ducation-a term requirng ,defi:: it ion fr-om time to time. If this be not true to-dav, then the Ani'eri,can college has .. undergone a radi- eal change within the last forty years; and w'hat l-:; more, the change h.a.s taken place in op}10sition t-:J .the views and the ideals of the best and fore- most educators. Tbe truth is, ilowever, that no such. ·change :has in reality established itself. There have been enlargement, growth, a broaden- ing and multiplication -of studies and methods in en our ·c,olleges, but the fundamental character- h:Uc of the American ·College, that is, its essen- tially non-pro.fessional ai:n.'i, abides. N-ow my point is that tlla interweaving of the ·professional and the non-professional is, to ~~BY th-e least, a doubtful experiment. Unf!onbtedly there are various degrees of ·closenes·s batween. :professional and non-professional departlnentE C't instruction in many of our universities and col- loges; but as a rule it has been fnund b~.st to draw a pretty distinct line between them. vVher- ever that line is faint the .fa·ct is gen8ra1ly owing rnore to accident than to design, or else to c-er- tain paramount demands ·of financial E'-P-onon1y. At Gnion, the very ·close connection bEtween the pro- fessional school of engineering and the colJ~ge vroper is owing partly to aecident, partlv to iinan- c~al exigencies. Let me illustrate by a ~comu~ri· son. When· I came tn Union Colleg2. i1i 1881 I found tile institution .organized on th:::> ~pattPrn of tl;e college of the nineteenth century. It is not ne·cessary to discuss the character of such a col- lege. There were many of them in the EasV:rn and Middle States, and they were well known t0 n:ost paople, s·o far as Lheir broad -outline·.s were concerned. Their general purpose wRs to fit..young n1en to take part in the world~s work, whatever that mig:ht be. Columbia was one of t'bese cn1- 1E:ges. Union was another. The curricuhun here at Union ·differed only slightly from that at the New York institution. In some res·pects the. eqnip- ruent at Union was superior to that of Columbia. For example, the modern languages at the lattf•r college w~re less effi·ciently aand regularly ~no­ vided for than at Union. But in general the two

:t il . 'I ' !' j .. ' '1: . ; I I i i ' ,, .,. ,I I, .. . , ! 6 THE CONCORD·IENSIS colleges might have excfianged places wifhnu t especial gain or loss to either one. Th(-:1 enginPel\- ing department at Union wa-s p1'actieally in ~ts infancy, and did not appreciably affer.t the char- a·cter of tbe college. Union. was essentially ::1 so-called c1as:sical eollege. There was, however, just one important dif· fE:ren·ee between the Colu1nhia of the tilue re- . d _j\t ft::rred to and the Un~on of the same :perw . t1 the former pla·ce the engineering or scienti:fi:e de- partment, known as the bc'hool of mines, was se- . gregated fron1 the college proper. When Professor Chandler went from Union Col- 1 t New York to fcntnd the school ·of n.:~nr,s •f;ge o ht was instructed to make of it a ssparata in~ti­ tntion. At Union th'e engineering department Pn- tered upon its career as an integral ·part of th8 college itself. As t1:1e tw·o institutions, Union ~nd Columbia, grew and developed, many chl1ng;Ps were wrought in both. At Columbia the sc'hool of mines never became a part of t:he college, but rdnained always as a thing apart, whereas in Schenectady the engineering department not only never lost its connection with Union College, but as time went on it gradually gained an ascend- ancy, until eventually it became the do1ninant fac- tor in the institution. The earlier situation was lost sight of, and tl:le college proper found itself absorbi\d by what had now developed :into a pro- fessional school of considerable range and inftu- ·~ nee. To-i 1y Co1umbiE~> College is essentially what it has always· been. It has develo:::ed along its own natural lines. It is still the \rnl- lege of Arts.\ If it is m'ore 8fficient, 1nore hroad, more far-reaching than it was in earUPr davs, the fnct is due to ac8retions and additions that are in keeping with its tr3.ditional and rightful fnnc- t;('llS. ~The univ2rsity has grown up around it, but has neit'h2r assirr.dlat2d nor obscured it. Colu m- bia Colleg-e is stili non-professional. Union, on the oth€r hand, has grown into £l pro ff·ssional school of which the earlier course in Engineering is the nucleus. Th2 additions of the' last quarter of a century have been entirely on the side of its professional work, and have been w'holly da€ to the d€,mands of that w~ork. T;1,P. old college has, to all intents and purposes, disap- peared, for few additions such as :have heiped to make Columbia College a strictly modern inst.itu- , tion are to be found in operation {)fi Union College Hill. I refer in 'Particular to those col- lateral branches of study, which are dosely re- lated to Latin and Greek, and which should be required for the A. B. degree-such subjects as Greek and Roman :history, archaeology (including ancient art and archit·ecture), palaeography, in- scriptions, early Christian and n1ediaeval art. gpnn e1 al antiquities, ·classical philology, and the Uke . Such subjects as these are of the veTy essAnC·J of humanistic culture although in their fuJ1'3st de- ' velopment they belong to a comparatively r-:'c\:\·nt date. But they are provided for at our bc.•st col- lEges, where Hme is assigned to them in th2 en rTi- culum and teachers are paid to impart them. To say that they belong only to graduate departrr1ents is to go back some thirty or forty years; to-day no hard and fast line c::J.n be drawn between gradu- ate and under.grad.uate studies, so far as classical · antiquity is concerned. At any rate, the genuine coli e·g-e finds p la.ce for th 2s2 studies sorr1ewhere an1ong .its courses, or at least endeavors to do so by openly recognizing their claims. Now the condition of things at Union to-day is not ne·cessarily open to criticism. It is the in- evitable result of circumstance:s. It is a natn l'al co:1sequence of uncontrollable events. An edu- C::J.tional instituti·on is like any other organism. It sh:lpes itself in accordance with its environment d · c::t ......... cos Som·etimes the force.s which a;: ClrCUlll..., . ._~.., ..., • affect it are external; sometimes they are inter- nal. In Unions case both have been at work. Local influences have led to opportunities of which the authorities have not been slow to a vail the:n- selves. Conditions existing Ol1tside of the collEge have created a dem·and for engineering studies, which it was both right and natural that the au- thorities should endeavor to meet. The authori- ties have met the den1and to the best of their ability, and it is to the credit of the institution that a first rate· scientific school is in operation on College Hill. But the question now arises: What is to be- come .of ·the old Union College? Is it to be re-

THE CONCORDIENSIS 7 sto-red to its f·ormer independ•ence and vigor, or is it ·to co.ntinue to be :a sort of fee·der to the engi- neering sch:ool? :Some p.ersons in authority have s.aid in effect, \aboUsh it altogether,\ and that is what wou]d happen. were ·Gre·ek and Latin to be laid aside. Suc:h an opinion as this is 1)erfectly logi•cal and lts enti tied to all respe·ct. Other pe~rsons again, who also are in authority, desire to main- tai·n and strengthen the classical courses, and to make the humanities in .general a ·dominant factor in our edu·cational work at Union. Such a wish is also ·perfectly logical, for it h.as tradition be- hind n, and in the past it is wha:t Old Union has f:01:1nd to ·be impracticrublle, the college prope·r shGuld he equipped im..m.edi:ately with a view to P1.e· restoration, so to ,speak, of the \balance ·of power;\ with a view ~dso to its finding a place am.ong the bette'r colleges of the country, of such . a nature that those young men who are seeking a liberal education as ·something distinct from pro- fessional trainin~g sh.·ould come· to Union with as ready a •will as that w-hich would determine their choice in favor o,f 0Glum:bia or W1illiams or Am· herst. The added prestige whic:b. would thus undoubtedly accrue to the classical courses would tend to place the lat·te-r on their· old and respected stood for. One ·of these two things shouid •oe footing, and would as.si.st in annulling the effect done and done at once. At present, notwithstand- ing a slight increas·e in the number ·of our classical students, It is ·tradition alone· that h:alds our classi- cal studi-es in their ·original abode on the college cam,pus. But these studies, overshadowed as they are by thos.e of the engineering school, h.ave not sufflcient prestige t~o maintain their existence ther•2 without aggressive and determined su.pport fr·om external so·urces. V\t1ithin the student body there are pronounced evidences of a sentiment which is working always against them; this sen- timent has a;t la.st become a potent factor in the college Ufe; it te·nds too dtscourage both the classi- of the common ta·lk now rife within the college walls-talk ·which, .aHbough. neither 1:1nnatural nor vicious, is nevertheless a distinct hindrance to the .oroper efficiency of the classical departments. Although the second of these two suggestion8 is to my mind m-erely a eompromi.s.e, yet its reat· ization might lead to, a gradual differentiation of OPP•OSing intereS'tS. In brief, the thing to be d ~­ sired is either a definJte separation of the profes- siol!al frolJl the non-profes.siona1 elements on the college carr~pus, or at lBast such a restoration <!l·f what I have ventured to call the \balance {)f power\ that the classical courses. may be proof cal student and the classi·cal teachers; it is agains.t the constant disparagement which m·ee·ts shared even by some m:einbers of the faculty, and it will ultimately work the downfall of classical studies at Uni·on unl;ess one of two policie·s shall be adopte·d. The Collage of Arts, to use the old term·, must be separated from the school of engineering in such a way that hoth students and faculty may look upon it as a distinct and separate schoo 1, having a different aim and purpose in the educa- tional life of the day. This would be the best move that could ·be made by the college authori- ties. The further equipment of the colleg·e proper couid then go on m·ore slowly, according to the means at command. The innate, though perhaps unconsci·ous, antagonism be'tween the p.rofes.si·onal and non-professional ele.ments in ·the college life would then cease to assert itself, and both .si-des would ·bene·fit by the result. Or, i·f this :plan is them on every h:and. In either case it is to be hoped that in the eud Union Unive-rsity may be n1ade to include not only the distinctly profes- .sional schools of 1:a w and medicine in Albany, but also a well define-d engineering (or scientific) school 1n Schenectady, to which should be added the vel'ii',1o~e Unh>n of old, the College of Liberal Arts, r..ow brought up to datP, au·d capable of lay- ing fair claim to the honored title ot Uni')n Col- lege.

' T·he num;ber of isoJ.neric ~substances We cannot p-resent organic ch.emistry :free from hyp,othesis ,as we can inorg:an:irc ~chemistry, be- ca:tlse it is s·o intimately interwoven with hypo- thetieal views. Up t·o the n1:jd:e of the nineteenth ee·ntury, is-omerism was unknown. It ~as thought that every body has a composition of its own, different fram every other body, and th.e same percentage ~c:amp·osition means the same :body, but with iso- meric substances, thi.s is not true. Berzelins for n1any years in his Jahresbericht rec·orded and .com·m.ented upon the progress of che:rntsiry. Here he re·p·orted the analysis of a new acid by Wbehler and the analysis of the acid of fulminating mercury by Liebig, as having the same p·ercentage c·ompositi·on, but different prop- ertie·s. This was thought to be impossible, and Berzelins m.ade sarcastic remarks, the drift of which was that some-body w.a·s wrong. This led to now known is overwhelming. To explain sueh a fact is si'mply to connect it with other well known facts. Wlhen a friend intro- duces his s·ister, that explains the girl! Instead of this, however, a hypotheti·cal explanation was given for the men of the time regarded the atomic hyr;othesis as a fact. ·We might expect the properties of a c-ompound to .be dependent on the prop.erties of the cons.ti tu- ent ato·m.s, and weight is an additive property. But other properties, as co1or, are not the .sum, or average, of the properties of the constituent eie- ments. These questions form the contradictions and unsolved problems of the atomk hypothesis. Berzelins, ho,wever, offered an explanatio·n of isomerism,. 1baS:ed on the atomic hypothesis. He introduced the idea that the atoms could be dif- ferently arranged in the ID'nlecule, and he even c~onsidered .arrangements in space. What is called a meeting between Woehl.er and Liebig, which was the development of organic che~mistry is nothing ·\ne beginning of a lifelong friend.ship. They re- else than the trial of different views or general peated their analysis and f~ound them correct. r,'presentations, of possible arrangements of the \''3cience gains by avoiding friction whieh only develops useless heat.\ Liebig .afterward became famous a·s the founder of agricultural chen1istry, and W'oehler afterward discovered aluminum, and m.ade in his laboratory the :first artificial organir compound. Before his day organic cornp·ounds w·ere thought to be the produc-t solely of some liv- ing organi.s·m plant or animal. atoms in space. The arrangen1ents were known as radicals, or tyres, and developed from the radicals of inor- g-anic chemistry, as ammonium and cyanogen. Lie·big and Wlo,ehler working together prepared a whole family 0f compounds from the raatcal benzoyl ( C6 H5 CO.) obtained from bitter alJ.nond oil. This method of work has been follo\Yed to Faraday, famous f·or his work on electrolysis, ~he present day. A chemist makes as many de- discover·ed another case of tw·o ·bodies having the same percentage co·mpo·sition but different prop- erties. In the liqui-d which separat·ed out .in the cylinders of compressed illuminating gas used in Beritn, ·he f.ound .a ga·s now called bu tylene (C4 H8) with a com.position and vap·or density just lilie .. ethylene (02 H4). The next case wa.s of :a different kind of tar- taric acid sometimes obtained .at a large manufac- rivaUves of a substance as possible 'n o: der to find its true p·osition in organic chen1istry. ThlS is the method employed by Dr. Ellery when he made num·herless organic derivatives of sulfuric acid in order to prove its :Dormula. Next Bunsen prepa~ed and analyzed derivatives of cacodyl, obtained from potassium acetate and arsenic trioxid. Cacodyl is an unpleasant sub- stance to work with., It s.mells horribly, is ex- . ' I' 1'

: i ,, 10 THE CONCORDIENSIS tren1ely poisonous, and very ·dangerously expLo- ·sive. Bunsen was nearly killed by each of these influences, working ~separtely on one occasion -losing an eye, ·but e.ach time he returned t;o the work. By thes'e investigations the theory of radi- clas see·med es,tabUshed, but danger arose. Chlor- ine was found ·by Dumas to displace hydrogen, for exa·mple in .acetic .acid, giving trichloracetic add. Berzelins said that this could not be· s-o, simply 1because he had develop·ed a theory according to which combinati-on wa:s due to the mutual attrac- tion of oppositely electrHi:Bd a,tom·s. Chlorine was stpongly negative and .hydrog.~n strongly positive, so that if chlo·rine actuaJly did -displace ·hydrogen, it w-ould destroy his wh-ole theory. ·Berz:elins had spent a long life at his ho-me in Sweden as the czar of chemistry, and ·he was no·w an o-ld man who hated to give up his views.· But science had to admit that chlorine replaced hydr·ogen. The theory of substitution was then develo•ped, and extended to almost everything. Oomplicatedl compounds were recognized as derivatives, and a better representation of real facts obtained. It was found that carbon atoms could be joined to one ano·ther by one two or three bonds. All ·of the·.se developments were in two dimensions, but 'finally iso1nerid·es ·were· found whic_h would. not fit into the system. So V:an't Hoff and Le Bell introduced stereo-c-hemistry or the repre.sentati·on of the atoms as arranged in space. In later times fa0ts are known which even three dimensions will not explain, according to Ostwald. Thus the change from active right malic acid to left, on .sub- stituting chlorin·e f·or hydrogen and back again. w~e eannot adoP't more than three dimensions, however, and keep our atoms. These consideraUons have led ·scientists in re- cent years -to ask the general question-lis it not po.ss.tble to -d·o without atoms, and find a systen1 of org·ani'c che-mistry, free from these hypotheti- cal assumptio~s, which is descri.ptive of real facts, just as it is possible to de-scribe and con- e·et the law of .combining weights and the laws ' underlying the molecular rtheory, w'ith real fa1cts, without the help of hyp·othesis?

-· ~. wa; ' THE CoNCORDIENSis· VOL. XXXII. UNION ,COLLEGE, APRIL 24, 1909 No. 21 ' BASEBALL. First Game on Cam,pus Resu:lts in Loss. PRATT, 5.; UNION, 3. Last Saturday the team played the first g·arnH ~~ of the seaso!J. on the campus. T!.~:e game wa-E caned at 3: 20 when \Prexy\ stepped into the box and pitched the rst ball 'Of the game and also of t11e season. This ball proved to be a strike and then \Frexy\ was greeted with hearty cheers from the students, but he resu1ned his sea~t on the bleacJ.1- Pratt was retired in the sixth by a neat double play, Perry to Mackey to· King. For Union, lat0.r Perry aand Bergan had singled, and· King fo'.Iled out,. Ladue hit a long one to· right, which proved to be a three-bagger, bringing in Perry and Ber- g· an. Ladue was put otlt at the plate on an -=tt- tempted f:;queeze ·play. Shaw then hit to short and was out at first. A double play was pulled ·off in the seventh by Mackey and King. Union· made a i\tin in tli<'lr half. Ma.ckey walke·d. Peckham made a hit, and both sto[e bases. Perry then brought :Mackey ers and was content to watch \hi~ boys\ finish the home. PBckham was out, sliding home. .Score- game. The gam.e ended in a victory for Pratt but !t should have easily belonged to Union. Although Union made no errors during the.game tirr1e \Ya\i lost on plays just a~t critical ·moments of tll~ g1me, so the advantage was unnecessarily given to Pratt at several times. The one point in which the te-an1 was probably the weakest wa~ in b~se·running. At one or two times a little more ability in this would have resulted in S·coring more runs. As yet the team has not had n'nlCt ... opportu_nity to get pl'a<'- tice in base-running, but it will be one of the ,cfiief points in the daily practi-ce. Most of the old men vvere in good form and the new men showE:ld up very good. Shaw at third made several good plnyR; McCormick at center field played a goop gan1e, and Peckham behind the bat did not allow any passed balls. On the whole, Union b.ad a far bet- ter fielding team than Pratt. In the fir~t three innings, tt ... ere was no scoring, although Union, with a little head-work, should have crossed the plate. In the fourth Gaffey hit safely, stole second an J third, and came home on Dean's single. The fiftb. proved a bad inning for Union. vVith the bases full, and two out, Gaffey banged the baJ1 for a two-bagger, which almost hit t11e chapel, bringing in two runs. Hoffn'tan later crossed the plate. .Score-Pratt, 4; Union, 0. Pratt, 4; Union, 3. Pratt ended the scoring in the eig'htil. Gaffey m.aking his ·second two-base hit, and coming home on Broadhead's single. Union oould not cross the plate in the 'fighU~ or ninth, although the student body ro~e fr0rr... the bleachers and cheered continuously. It looked in the ninth as if Stewart, who 'had batted for Dt,r!n, and had singled to left fi21d, would score, but he was tagged trying to steal home. A strange feature of the game waas that \\'.'hen Pratt was at tlie bat they either ~truck ~:mt or, bit to the outfield; while Union's hits fell n1ostly in the infield.

' ~ I lOB THE CONCORDIENSIS ALU'MNI NOTES. 1854.-John Dennin Hall, a Union graduate of the class of 1854, died in St. Luke's Hospital, N0w York, April 20, at t'h0 age of 80 years. Until wit~1- in a few days of his death he had neY.er UG(l11 seriously ill a day in his life. He wa~:; a victim of vneumonia, which he contracted a few days ago. Mr. Hall was born in Salisbury, N. Y., SepteiC- ber 15, 1828. He pursued his .pre1paratory studies at Fairfield (N. Y . .Acaden1y. In 18~2 he PnterPd the juni.or class at Union and was gradu::ttAd a:tHl elected to Phi Beta Kappa in 1854. His ~routhfnl intention was to be an \honest\ lawvPr but ad- ., .. , verse condition5 at the close of 'hi·s college .rourse diverted hiln to ·business pursuits. Since that time he has been .a teacher, an author, an archi- tect, an inventor and a manufacturer. As vn author he has produced a history of the progre~ses ,of' the \Maine Prohibitory Liquor Law.\ 1S3;); \A Guide for the Traveler in :New York City,\ a p1an fur the \Colonization of the Paupers and lVIendi- ·:Ll:J. ts of Large Cities,\ and a pro-spectus of the \E'stablishment of Self-Supporting Clubs for ti1e T' e:re:fit of Industrial City People.\ :vir.

A.fter he was graduated from college, :Mr. H~H took a s·pecial course in engineerin~, obtaining a . . degree both for mechanical and civil en~ineering. When tile \gold fever\ struck 'tne country and thousands flocked to California in 1849, to seek their fortune, Mr. Hall was am·ong the first to try his luc kat the fortune-digging ga1ne. It was while there that he .put his 1nechanical idea into play, whieh resulted in his first inven- tion, which was a contrivance for separating the gold frorrl' t'he dirt, and it found a ready market for the miner5·. T'l1e \gold fever\ soon lost its attraction and Mr. Hall returned to the east, accepting a posi- Uon as chief engineer of the A. Coburn Con1pany of Philadelphia, which is at present the largest n .. anufacturer of thermo:rneters in this country. The cost of manufacturing' that · a:rttcle was . r~­ duced from $4 'to 32 cents by one of Mr. Hall's ideas. ·He accumulated a large fortune ·from the royalties he re(2eived when he invented a folding table for seamstresses, but subsequently lost it i '1 la.nd speeulat:iJon. I:n September, 1854, Mr. Hall married Mary ILliza .Johnson of h1s native town. He 'has had two sons and two dauglilters. Three of his .child-ren died in youth and the death of his wife followed in 1872. He is survived by one daughter now liv- ing in New York. 1857.-.Lawrence Clark Seelye, ·who is now P1·esidEnt of Srnith College, tendered tis re.signa- tion some tim·e ago to take effect this eon1ing June. He has, h·owever, consented. to remain in charge o.f the college for· another year. Rev. Dr. Burton, pa·stor of tt.:.e Church of the- Pilgrin1s, Brooklyn, N. Y ., is to succeed Dr. See lye. At present Dr . .Seelye is over 71 years old. He graduated from Union with the class of 1857, at the age of 20 years. He was an honor man receiv- ing a Phi Beta Kappa key. Latsr he studied at Andover Theological Sen1inary and the Univer.si- ties of Berlin and· Heidelberg. He was pastor of the North· Congregational Church from 18t2-1865 . From 1860 1873 he was profes5or of English Lit- erature and Rhetoric at Amherst. In 1 S73 he was elected the first presidEnt of Smith Colle,r,e. He wa·.s the c'hief organizer and developer of this ·~or­ lege and he has largely deterrr1ined i+.s cu tTiculurrl and -policy. In 1875 'he r2ceived .hi8 D D. fron1 Union and in 1894 LL.

H·e not only organized the Press Club but keeps its 1:nen1bers enthusiastically at work. H·e is the dyna.m.ic force of the :Ren. ais- sanee. The earliest in.dication of an awakening in this first year of the Renai.ssanc.e was the· in·c:o'm.~ng class with its increase. of 45 over last year. 'J'he largest (freshn1an) class in the history of the Oollege. The second event was the Wes1e:yan game with its re-sulting adve-rtisement due to ex- aggeration of tJ~ e accounts of the gam.e and their subsequent correction in pap:e..ys not ·only in. this country but in tl:e big cities all over British and Continental Errope. Then the Press Club lo,B:·med upon th·e horizon and other things quickly ,fol- lowed, the late.gt nf whjch is the new Gymnasium proj·~ct which is now well unde-r way and has al- ready contributed a great share toward advertis- ing the Oollege.
