Scllenectnt1y En'ning Stnr. A WI·NNJ:NG Union's bask·etb·nll t·e·am this sea- l':E,AIM. son is one that is occa.sinning 1nuch commendation and favorable com,ment n0t only from th·e undergraduate body, but also fro1n alumni, newspap-ers, and the oHtside ·public. The fact that Unlon has never l3efore had a ba,sket- ball team that could fairly be calh:;'d sucee,s.sful is all the· mor·e reason for giving fuUest ~credlt to t'he team. Th,e stud·ent body i's justly apprHci.ative of the faithful and consistent work of Coach Kuolt and Q,f every man .on the te·am. W\inning athletic teams will proba-bly do mor-e than any other thing at present to advertise the coilet:~-e and to pro- mote its growth and welfare. PRES. RICH- Tt,e extended trip that Pr·es- MON·D'S TRIP. id:ent RiC'hmond is making among Union alu·rnni in th-e .S..outh is one that cannot fail to result in a de·epened enth usiasu1 among our southern graduates. Union has al- ways be·en proud of th-e fact that she i's the Alma Mater of so many Southerners. One of tl;.e most pr.essing nee·d:s of the coeege is a more d·efinite and a closer or.ganiz-ation uf our alu·mni. It is for this purpose that the Grad- Hate Council has been called in to ·existence, an 1 l it is in the inte:'est of the S·ame work that Pr·N\- ident Richm·ond is visitjng th,B alumni of the S-outh. ------ \COLLEGE An ·editorial in the January DEMOCRACY.\ number of \Tl'·e OoUege World;' .entitled \C-ollege Democracy,\ is ,evidence of the fa.ct that the worl{ which our Christian Associa- tio·n has begun in enlisting coUeg.e men to teacl1 the foreign-speaking peo·p.le in our city, has at- tract-ed th·e attention of some m,en outside of onr own college. The editor of \Tl1e C.olle'l•e World,'' in the editorial referred to above, calls attention to this work that Union stud,ent:s are doing for the for·eign_.er, and says t11at it is a ty.pkal ill ns- traUon of what genuine college democracy shollld me·an. And, by the way, \The Colleg·e World\ is a good magazine. It is a very attractiv·e and up- to-date periodical, which has just r~ecently hegun publication. It is really a c.oHeg·e man's mag- azine.

i' f l '> THE CONCORDIENSIS. l I ~lumni J}}cltln. EDITED BY GRADUATE COUNCIL At the Janua-~·y meeting of the Board of ·Tru.s~ t~-es a very im1•ortant reconuren~1atiou of the Graduate Council was gpproyed and will be put into effect sl1ortly. This recommendation pro- vi·des that h·erf'R fter the pr~sic1ent of the col- leg-e, the Board .of Trustees, a11d the Graduate Coun.eil sh11l he the only bodies empowered to solicit money :from the a:umni for college pnr- ~oRes. The ajn of Jhi.<s resolution is to replac-e the many appeals now sent to the alumni, \by a r·egu~ar yearly gift which will be paid to the treasure.· of tbe college and speni by the trus- tees for the variou.s increasing· needs that our de-velopment is bringing about. In this way regu- lar finaneial aid -wil: he secured £rom the alu1nni and ·they in t1un wHl be relieved f::-om th€ an- noyanc·e of many hegging l-etters. This plan is in g·eneral shnilar to that at Princeton. U do·es not aim to tie alumni down tu one sort of gift for, if they pO wish, their year1y subscription w[l b.::~ turned over to such pu:\p0ses as they direct. Tt does, however, giv.e the gradu- ates the as::;uranc·2 that th.::·ir ·n1-onev goes dirf\ctlv to- the authorHi(\~ who are managing the colleg{~ affairs a nil it wr 1 be spent in the ways most u~eful. The otne: advantage which this :plan of- fers Ues in the fact tha.t th-e gen.erous a1umni, wbo are always giving when called upon, can now set- tl<' the an1ount they wish to give this ·cau3·e and l.<IJow that they will not be ct=~l1-eo on for mor-e Rt odd mo1ne11ts. In a word, it aims at protect- financial support a regular and businesslik·e mat- financial support, a regulcr and businesslik! ntat- tcr. WASHINGTON DINNER.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 'I ., VOL. 34 FEBRUARY 11, ili9li NO. 15 ;: •' ,, Big Student Meetings. \ Talks ~o College Men on F undarnentals in Life u to be Given in College Chapel Next Week by \Bob'' Davis and Robert E. Speer. Rev. \Bob\ Davi'> A s·eri·es of three \Talks to College Men on Fundamentals in Lif·e-\ wil be held in the college ch3jpel on Monday, Tu·esday and Wednesday even- ings of next week. As was announced in th€ last number of the Concordiensis, \Bob\ Dav1s all'd Rob·ert ·E. Sp·eer have betnl s•ercured by the Christian Association as the distinguished speak.- ers for thes·e big stud·ent mass ·meetings. It is ov-er six months ago that th·e Chrtstian ·AS- sociation began to plan for these m·eetings. At that tim·e Mr. Sip·eer's speaking .engagements we!:e so many and wer-e mad·e so fa.r in advauc.e that it was impossible iJo get h'im to come to Union before the middle of F€:bruary. Who Is \Bob\ Davis? \Bob\ Davis (his real name i's R-ev. Robe ~·t Davis, but \Bob\ Davis is what everybody calls him.) is. on·e of the well known of Dartl!louth's young graduates. It is only seven years ago tha~ he was the· famous big ·center on bartmouth·s football team, for he liraduatHd just back ~n 190:~ It is only five years ago that h·e was the 'C>Oae11 of th·e Dartmouth t·eam, for h-e went back to colleg<:: in 1905 to act as football coa.ch. N·ot only .u1 football but on the track and in the Glee Clu·b h'J was a leader at Dartmouth. Students who have he18n at Northfield -vvill re•m·emboer hiln as the jolly, big fellow who us·ed to lead the singing in tr e bl:; auditorium meetings there. Until la:;t y·ear \Bob\ Davis was assistant pac:· tor of th-e W€11 known \Br~ c1\ Ct urch'' in N e ·.\· ,, Robet t E. Speer York. He is now the pastor of the Presbyteriau. Ohurch in E::n.gl·ev;ood, N. J., one of the fine sub- urbs of N€w York. But he is still just ''Bob'' Davis! Robert E. Speer. The namoe of R-obert E. S1pe-er is probably bette!' known to sttldents ev~erywhoer;e than that of R.TIY other of the famous ·coUeg·e s.peakers. Union m·en are for\tunate in having this opportunity of hear· ing and me€ting this man whos-e great person.· ality ha:s -dee,ply imtpressed so many coHege me.u in our larg:est universities. Mr. -S:peer was graduated fro.m Princ.eton Ul 1889 and r-eoeived his Master's ·Degree from Yal-B in 1S9~J. At Princeton he r-eached a d·ers ree of prorn.1n .. enee that few men have -ever attain·ed. Wh il€ one of Princ-eton's l·eading athlete·s, leadin.g orator, and editor of \The Daily Princeton1an~ .. h·e w·as at the same time such a rare student that he rec-eived. th·e signal honor o.f a degr·ee \sumn~a. cum Qaud·e.\ Last S'Uiiln:J:er Mr. Spe·er was highly honored l1y having conferred u])on him by the University .cr Gla:s.gow the degre·e of D.

, :I J ,, ·i. ,, '' '' . I ' .. , b THE CONCORDIENSlS. COSMOPOLITIANl ·CLUB HAIS BEEN ORG.ANIZE.D· AT UNION Appl:ication M1ade for M·embe.rship ln the lnte.r- national Association of :Cosmopol.itan Clubs. Probably but f·ew stud·ents know a.bout the CoB- mopolitan .Club whi,ch has recently been organ- ized at Unio:n, and the· work -that the club IS accompli:shing. T·he elub, which was organized last December, no~w has ·eleven members, and an application has b€en rna:d·e for m€,mbership in the Gord1a. Fratr€H, the International .Asso,cia- tion of Cormopolitan Clubs. All of our fore~_s;n students, seven in number, and four Am:erican students, one from e·a,ch class, are now members of the club. They are a:s fol- '12 p t 1 'lq. lows: Ratto, '11; Barros, ; on ua , ~ .. , Moraes, '14, and Moreira da SUva, '14, ·Of Brazil; I1engar, '14, of India; E!ghiay·an, '14, of .Syria; and She.pard, '11 1 who is temporary presi-dent; Glen Smith, '1'2, Rogers, '13, and Elwens, '14. Th€ id·e~a of the club was first eonce-ived by E.wens, through whose influence the rest of the m.emb-ers w·er-e intere:sted. The work that the club can accomplish, anrl is a:ccoin.plishing for th-e colloge, can probably he best understoo·d by a statement ·of its p·ur~ p·ose.s, whitch are essentially as follows: To int·er·est our foreign students in the hest kind of coUege life, and to ·mak·e th-em f·eel ·so at hom-e .at Union that after their return to fi1eir native land they ~rrill end•eavor to persuad.e their f·ellows, wh.o intend to study abroad, to coin€ to our coll€:ge. To promote a better understanding of th·e po·· litical, eco.nomic, and literary probl·ems of dih·er- ent countries. To cultivate social intercours.e among th.e s tn- d·ents of differ-ent nationaliti·es, and th·erehy foster the spirit of universal brotherhood. The idea of a Gosmopoli tan Club is not a new t'hing in coUege life, as Yale, Cornell, .Syr.a:cu~ze, Ohio-Wesleyan, and all our larg.e univ·ersities now 'have su·ch organizations. Th-ey also ·exist in tlle princi.pal universities in Eurove. DR. ANGELL CONTINUES HIS PSYCHOLO:Q,y LE.CTURE COURSE. Dr. J!am€:S R. An:gell -of Chi.eag~o U'niversity d€- livet·ed• his thira and fourth lectures on Psy·ehot- ogy on the subJects of ''Experimental and ·1Ab· nortnall PsJ~chology\ hefore a large gathering on Monday and T'1:1esday evenings of the· past week The lectures this we·ek were even more: in- t·eresting than those o-f tw.o w~e·eks ag·o, and the illustrations us·e d by the sp·eak·er weN~ highly ·en- tertaining and th-e e:x;perlm.ents so ~pra.ctical that one ·could obser·ve most of the ·phenomena with- out the us•e o:f special conditions and ap·paratus. The' l·ectures are not only entertaining, bn ~ they are also very instructive. T:h·os·e wh·o hav-e studied Prof. Angeal's 'hook ·on Psy.chology are esp·e~cially interested in th.e l€'ctur·e:s, while the under-classmen in the acad.emic ,coun:·e consid,:;r that they hav.e a rare opportunity to 1·earn in an easy way the €ss,entials of a subj.e·ct whieh th~~Y will study in their junior and s-enior Y·e:ars. One-half of tJ.:t.e leetur·es have now been givt:u w·hieh are later to be publish·ed under the s·eal of Unio0n University, an·d it may he well at ttis point to giv·e a bTief outlin·e of .Dr. Angell's ·earli-er life. Dr. Jan1·es Ro-wland Angela was born in Bur- linliton, v t., on May 8, 1869; was graduat·ed frmn the Unive·:-sfty of Michigan in 1890, wh·er:e 11{) re·c·eived the degre·es o·f A. B. and A. M.; studi·ed under Prof. Jan-es at Harvard for a y·ear befo1·e attending the ·universiti·es of Berlin and Halle. In 18f93 he travel·ed and studi·ed at Vi-enna, Par~:3, Lie;psig, etc.; 1Ett·er in the year he b-ecamoe 111- struc ·or in phil(}sophy in the University of Min- nesota; from MLnne.sota h·e w-ent to the Uniyer- sity of Chicago, wt.er·e in 1905 he became :pro- fes~or and head of the Psychology Departm·ent, and in 190·8 ·hec::wne senior d·ean of the univ·er .. sity.

T:E-LE CONCORDIENSIS. 7 UNION LOSES TO COLGATE AFTER HA.RtO··FOUGHT GA:M E. ---···- .,.,. Garnet Team Plays Fast Game in Spite of U n- favo.rable Conditions. Union's fourth game of basketball, a:lthough it did not r•e.sult in a vi-ctory for thre Garnet as l: av·e thre tlH€•e- previous 1ga.mes, prov.ed beyond a doubt that our team has not yet m.et its rnatch when ])laying under equal conditions.

OR-DER AT COL- L~.GE MEETING. The ·c~ stom of holding a regular w.e·ekly colllege-meet- ing was firs't 'instituted at Union for the pur1pose of c::-€ating rn all .of the students a ke-en interest in all forms of s~ud·Hnt activiti€s, and to aid in arousiD!5' and maintaining tl>e · college spir'it of which w·e are all so proud of now. Recently ther·e has been a tendency on the .pal't of ·certain students to make fun of practically .everything that is brought up and to treat the whole .meeting as a joke. :If this spirit is con- Hnualily manifested by members of the s€rrior class, it ·can hardly be• expected that the oth?r class.e:s will take i.he n1eeting seriou·sly and have any respe·~t for what is sai'd. Every student, esp€c.ially ev·ery n1ember of the senior ·class, should be s·o interested in the s.uccess of the different ·student organizations that the students who r-epresen~ the different activiti·es will be able to speak at coUe:g.e me~eting without being made a su bj·ect of d·erision. If there are any persons who are dissatisfi:e,l with the way in whi·cJ. any undergraduate o~~­ ganizat~·ons are run, let them, instead of knock- . ing, do a lli·~ne something to help make those Ol'- gan~zations suc·cessful. By doing a little worl~ the·m·s·elves, they will be hett·er able to a.ppr0- ciate tte efforts of othoer students who are really working for tb e college. TO THE:. FRES.H·MEN. There has la~ely been exhibited by thoe freshmen class a tendency to wear the regular class ca:ps or toques only ahout the campus, and to wear othe:- hats whof\n · 1.~ oing d·ownto.wn. The rUile• which was pass.ed by t:-:e stud·ent bo·dy last fall :says that the freslh men caps must be worn i11 the city of Schen- ectady on all o·ecasions (Sundays includ·ed) un- til M.oving-up Day. T·he 1914 students would !Je showing much better spirit if tl:ey would con- tinue to wear the r·egti1ation caps or to·ques of their own accord, and thus render unnec-essary any inte:'ference on the part of the sophornor:.-~s or np1Jer ·class.m·en.

Dr. Richn!l:ond reopres·ent·ed the coU.ege and his re- marks arowsed much interest, While in the CitY the President was the guest of Dr. Charles S. Vedder, '51. The enthusiastic reception given the President is one of the many hopeful sign.s ot incr-eased interest on the part of the alumni. T be South has sent many of her be,st sons to Union and an btcrease in the attendance fro-m this s·e:~­ Uon would be a bene·fit to the co1ler2e. On Wed~ nesday, the 3rd, Dr. Richmond addressed the s ~~1- dents of the Porter Military Acad·emy, of whic~1 Prof. Charles J. Oolcock, '75, is head.master. NOTES. 1851. Charles S. Vedder, LL.

Knapp, •of the Agricultural Department at Washington, has bee,n directing dering the past three years a movement to in- creas-e tbe corn ·Cr·op in the South. Dr. Knapp interested sev·eral thousand hoys who cultivai:P. an a1cre of c·orn under his 'direction and where 8 bu. had been consid·er·ed a good yield, thece young firnl'ers were atblo to raise from 130-2 1 50 bi1. 'T'bis practical example led farmers to follow th~3 di:rection.s of the Agricultural Departme,nt with a resulting increase in the southern crop. 1858. The Association of Washington, D.

Ja.nuary l&th. Mr. Hill had been a pra.minH'l.t lawyer for ·many years and first attracted a{t€n- tion by his successful defence of Henry Warrt Beecher in 1'875. It is sad to re,cord the ·cteath of our able alu·m.ni, .but we of the Gampu·s ar-e sure to hear some little story of the happy days wh~;ll thes-e old rn·en v:-rere boys, and thus find our sor- row softened. In the sixti·es Ca.pt. Jacl\so:a's gar- den was a favorite resort for certain hungry stu- dents and :so c:onstant was John Hill in his at- tentions to the C-aptain's strawberry· patch, that he soon gained the, title an1ong his ·classmates ot \Strawberry Hill.\ -----___,._,____ THE 1912 GARNET.

THE CONCORDIENSIS VOL. 34 FEBRUARY 18 1911 ' NO. 16 COLLEGE EFFICIENCY .. The following statistics furnished by Dr. Alex- ander Duane, '78, will be of interest to those graduates who have faced the problem of con- vincing parents and boys of the value of the education given at Union College. We hear so much about athletic teams, modern buildings, and the number of students atten.cling this or that college, that the loyal Union graduate is often hard pressed to meet the glamor of such arguments. While we do not lack in. proper ma- terial equipment, or reasonable a tihl:etic success, or a student body large enoug-h to support strong undergraduate organizations, still we can not cornpare with many colleges in these directions. In fact there is no need th.at we should, and while we want to improve in these .as well as in all other lines, our value to our graduates and prospective students lies in a diffe,rent quarter. The training a college gives its stttdents is the real test of its efficiency. The degree in which Union has prepared her graduates for a useful life should detennine her rar1k among American colleges. This alone j_ustifies the time and money a four year course requires and we Union men have cause to he proud of A'ln'la Mater when judged by this great test. One or two years ago a writer in the Yale Daily News, cited in Scienc1e, ma:de a study of the college affiliations of th.e I~,r42 men cata- logued in Appleton's Cyclopaedia of American Biography. Of the 5,236 college 1nen appearing, eleven colleges contributed over one hundred, each. 'They were as follows: Harvard ---------------------- 883 Yale ----~-=~~~-----··------ ---- 713 Princeton --------------------- 3 I9 Dartmouth -------------------- 208 Col urn bia ---------------------- 193 Brovvn ------------------------ r89 Union ---------------·---------- r88 Pennsylvania ------------------- I75 Williams ---------------------- I 57 Bowdoin ---------------------- 104 J\mherst ---------------------- 102 In interpreting these figures we must remem- ber, first, that of these eleven colleges only one (An1herst) was founded after Union; and, sec- ond, that a precise comparison can be made only b·y determining the ratio between the numbers given above for each institution and the total n1:11nber of its alu1nni at the time the Cyclopaedia 1vas pu·&Iished. In such a comparison it would be obviously improper to include the ah1n1ni of any of the professional schools connected with the institutions in question. The precise statis- ]ics are not at present available, but, they indi- cate that if we rank the colleges by such a ratio, Union stands with the real leaders. For Union the statistics show that this ratio ·Of en\Iinence i. e., the proportion between the number of alumni enumerated in the Cyclopaedia and the total number of alumni, dead and living, ts 1.36. It is interesting to compar.e this ratio, which represents the achievements of the :[)ast, with the proportion of living alun1ni, which will give, approximately at least, an idea of what Union men are doing today. For this pur- pose Dr. Duane looked through Who's Who in Am.erica for the nan1es of Union College 1nen. The number found was 87 which, treated in the same n1anner, gives a ratio of 1.30. This would seetn to show that Union 1s holding her own pretty we 11. This is an age of advertising and, while there • is much a bout advertising that is offensive, there is no doubt that people quite generally are im- pressed by having presented in a striking mat1- ner the merits of various institutions. Our own graduates are as a rule ignorant of the real greatness of Union's history. Such information as this which Dr. Duane has collected is of value to us in that it gives us con finnation of the faith we have in our Aln'la Mater, and if more infor- mation of a silnilar nature could be brought to the attention of the public, the college would be greatly benefited as \\Vell.

(') ·rHE CONCORD I EN SIS. ·KUOL T IS CHOS·EN TO COACH FOOTBALL TEA,M NEXT YEAH. His Ability as a Coach Has Been Fully De:mo:n- st·rated and a Strong Team Is Ex· pected Next Fall. At a S'pec1al me.eting of the' Althletic Board held last week Tuesday, Kuolt was ehiosen to coac·h next year's football team. Mr. Kuolt is well ac- quainood wHh every phase of t.tle gridiron gam.e and should develop· a strong team next year. While many of the p.Jayers would liked to have r.e'mained under R.egnier's :coa·ching for another season, the :Athletic Board found t'hat under the pre:ent circumstances it would not be ab-le to Ee- cure him. Kuolt ha:s the advantage of boeing per- sonally acquainted with all of the~ old memne:::b of our team, and he kn.ows the .conditions un- der which he will have to work. ~or this reason it is consi'd€red that he· will he far better than any n~ew man, who would have to s·pend several weeks on the \11111\ before becoming thoroughly a·cquainted with our situation. During his senior year at Hamilton in 1907 \Dutch\ played fullback for the Buff and Blue, and since his graduation from ·college, he ha.s always . be-en canne.cted with the ga.m·e in ·some manner. He was assistant c-oach at Ha.mHton for six weoek.s ·und.er a Brown coach and he is thus familiar with the Brown system of ,playin,~, whi-ch has resu1te·d in so many brilliant victories fo~ .. that college during the past few years. He has, also, had ·marked succoess in coaehing s-ev- eral prep·a.ratory school teams. M oreov€r, there is no question that he is acquainted with even· phasoe of tte game as now played, as he is gen- erally recogniz·ed as the best refer€·e ·~ha.t Uni~n has had on her ·campus for many yea~ s. Pr·obably the highest r·e'commend that Mr. Kuolt has for this position is his present succ-ess with the basketball tea,m. For the theory of coaching is much the san1e in .every sport and t.e has de·monstrated hey~ond a d{)ubt that he ·can· instill into the players the snap and vim which is so essential at crueial points in any form of ath- letics. It wa.s fetlt la~st year that the greatest we·akness of the te-am was the la·ck of snap and energy at Vital moments. While \Dutch\ may not have a reputation as an All~A1merican player, he cert::~.inly has the esE:.ential qualification3 of a ,;ood coach, ani next y€3.r WG hope to see onr football team. he as successfr:l as is our bas1\et- ball t.ec:.m Uis year. €1 -· ----· ---- TRI-LEAGUE DEBATE TO TAKE PLACE NPXT FRIDAY. U .:-lion Meets Colgate at Schenectady and Ham:I- ton at Clinton. The annual tri-league debate between Union, Han1ilton and Colgate will be held next Friday evening, February 24· The question that has been ·chosen for the debate is worded as follows: \For and against the Initiative and Referendum for New York State.\ One team for Union is to uphold the negative against Colgate in our chapel, while the other is to defend the affirma- tive against Hamilton. at Clinton. Harnilton is to debate Colg-ate at Hamilton. The men1 hers of the teams which are to repre- sent Union have been working hard on the sub- ject for several weeks, and now have the ma- terial pretty well in han.d. The two temns have been 111eeting frequently, and have been holding practice debates agai,nst each other. The line-up of the tean1s in the three debates will probably be as follows: At Schenectady-Colgate, affirmative; first speaker, S. H. Cos·w-ad, '12; second speaker, ]. A.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 7 \BOB\ DAVIS AND SPE'BR GIVE STRONG ADDRESSES. \Talks on Fundamentals in the :Christian Li£e\ Are Well Received. The series of student n'lass .meetings, which were ann.ounced by tP.e Christian Association two weeks ago, were held on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday evenings in the college chapel. Al- though the attendance on the first two evenings was not as large as the great worth of the ad- dresses deserved, yet it was the unanimous voice of all who were present at any of the meetings that Mr. Davis and Mr. Speer were men of great personality and power and that the thoughts, that they presented about Christian living de- served the senous consideration of all thought- ful men. Promptly at 7:30 on Monday evening the first n1eeting of the series began. Rev. Robert Davis. who, however, was known to all the m-en as \Bob\ Davis, spoke upon the thought \What Was the Christian Religion in the Mind of Jesus Christ?\ \The Christian religion,\ said Mr. Davis, ''in the mind of its founder, did not consist in be- lief in any intellectual doctrines, nor in any faunal rules. In Jesus' conception, the Christian religion was a very simple thing, and consisted in a real love for n1en and in a right attitude toward God.\ On Tuesday eventng Mr. Davis spoke on \The Religion of a Man in College.\ A college man's creed, according to Mr. Davis, n1ust consist in three things: (I) He rnust have, as a sub- stratun1 on which to build, a clean and moral life; (2) He must go out into the world with a purpose to pay to society the debt of service that he owes; (3) In order to best accomplish these first two essentials, he must give allegiance to the great personality of Jesus Christ. About 100 men heard Mr. Davis each evening. After each tneeting he met informally with a group of students in Silliman Hall to tneet them personally and to talk with them further. Mr. Speer's Address. On Wednesday evening Robert E. Speer, the g·reat speaker to college tnen, dosed the series of addresses. There was a good audience of .aoout 200 to hear M.r. Speer, and every word that he said was listened to earnestly by every man in the chapeL After being cordially intro- duced by President Richmond, Mr. Speer spoke, in stunm.ary, as follows: \The greatest thing to be attained is character. It is the most valuable possession in the world. But character is not self-defining; it cotnes only as a result of a man's attitude toward God and his belief of what he ought to be in the sight of God. 'That is, your character depends upon your religion; and the religion that can build up the strongest life of character is the religion that centers around the .matchless character and per- sonality of Jesus Christ. There is really but one alternative, 'Will you, or will you not, ac- cept Him as the master of your life?' \ After the cLose of the meeting a large number of the students, at the invitation of Mr. Speer, n1et in Silliman Hall for an informal after-meet- tng, when he spoke further about the Christian life. International Secretary Here. J. W. Pontins, the new International Y. M. C. A. Secretary for the East, was at the college last Tuesday and vVednesday. On Tuesday evening, after \Bob\ Davis' talk, he tnet with a small group of 1nen in Silliman Hall, and had a very interesting discussion as to the work that Christian 1nen can do in the college. Mr. Pontins was the guest of several fraterni- ties, and during his brief visit made many wann friends at Union. JUDGE POTTER. Prominent Trustee of the College. Judge Platt Potter, LL.D., whose portrait is the last on the right l1and side of the balcony, locking from the pulpit, was a prominent trustee of f1e college. He is an honorary graduate of the college be- ing given the degree of LL. D. in 1867. His place was afterward taken by Judge Landon. -------- Hospitahle Host-\Won't yon have some more cluck, Miss Stunner?\ Bashful Guest-\N o,~ I thank you.\ Hospitable Host-\Oh do.

Secretary TERMS: ATHLETIC BOARD On another page of REPORT this issne \v.iU he found a detailed retJort of the receipts and expenditures of the Athletic Coun- cil for the past year, which has been. submitted by the treasurer, Prof. Opdyke. On behalf of the students, the Concordiensis wishes to ex- press their gratitude to Prof. Opdyke for the in- terest which he has corttirtttally taken in athle- tics for 1nany years, and for· annuaUx giviHg the students an opportunity to know the financial standing of the different athletic tearns. It will be seen by this report that the A thle- tic Councll is now quite heavily it1 debt. In view of t!1is fact, every effort is being 1nade to reduce the expenses in every line ,of athletics, and the students l:ave no right to fed dissatisfied at any action that may be taken by the council to help remove the debt. The football season was a greater .financial success than usual last year, and it is hoped that by the end of another college year, careful man- agement will entirely cancel the pre sent debt. TO THE FRESHMEN. It has been noticed for some tin1e that there is a tendency on the part of many of the Fresh- n1en to 'fail to speak to members of the three upper classes when meeting then1 on the campus or streets of the cit-y. It is not 011ly the duty of the first year n1en to speak to all the students when n1eeting them, but to speak FIRST. One of the advantages of a sn1an college is that each student n1ay become acq:aainted with all his fellow-students and feel that each one is his friend. It would greatly aid this spirit of fellowship and good will, if the 191.4 n1en would always g-rest the other students with a hearty ''Hello\ whenever they meet then1. INTERESTING NEWS.

T'l-1E CONC'ORDlENSlS. II ~lumni J}lt\tl5. EDITED BY GRAOUA TE COUNCIL - A NEW ALUMNI .ASSOCIATION. A new alumni association was formed at Phila- delphia on February 6th as the result of the ef- forts of Morton M. Price and the visi1 of Dr. Richmond. A dinner was held in honor of the President and afterward, the alumni present drew up a constitution and elected the following of- ftcers. Dr. George A. Hoadley, '74, president; Dr. E. W. Rice, '54, vice-president; Morton M. Price, '99, secretary and treasurer. One of the a1n1s of the Graduate Council is to bring the alumni to the assistance of the col- lege and so to get each man to do th.at which he is best able to do. Money .is always neces- sary, but there are many other ways that the alumni can help and this meeting of newspaper- men is an example of the kind of assistance the Those present at the dinner were: Rev. E. W. Rice, D. D., I:r. Thomas Price, Dr. George A. Hoadley, Andrew Buchanan, Dr. George 13. Tullidge, Prof. S. T. Lochner, Guy B. Griswold, Arthur M. Hagar, Frank T. Wright, Morton M. Pric.e and Dr. J. L. Patterson, fonn·erly professor of 1na:thernatics at Union. There are between 35 and 40 ahunni living \v·ithin a short distance of Philadelphia and this. new association should have an active life. Union College now has but six really active associa- tions. This is a great pity and it is hoped that tre alun1ni will change this condition. The coun- cil has heen working on this n1att<:r and is now in correspondence concerning five associations that we I~ope to see started or aga1n brought to life. MEETING OF NEWSPAPER MEN. --- I n\ritations haYe been sent out to 44 1Jnion alu1nni now eng-aged in advertising or newspaper work to n- eet at the college on March 4th that we .may plan a better way of presenting our nevvs to the public. The publicity the college gets is 1nost unsatisfactory and as there are many prom.inent New York journalists an1ong our alumni, the college should greatly benefit by this 1neeting. Among those invited are William H. McElroy, Edward Cary of the New York Tirnes, Frank DePuy of the New York Herald, Con.de Ha1nlin and G. Herbert Daley of the New York Trihune. college needs; The final arrangements are not cornplete, but the alun1ni will be the guests of the college and son1e colleg·e stunt will be prepared for their entertainment.

JONATHAN EDWARDS, UNION'S SECOND PRESIDENT. ·The first picture hanging from the rear railing of the balcony on the right hand side is that of Rev. Jonathan Edwards, D. D., the second presi- dent of Union College. Dr. Edwards has always been termed \The Younger\ in order to dis- tinauish him from his father, a noted New Eng- o land 1ninister who became president of Prince- ton University. Dr. Edwards was chosen by the trustees in 1799 to succeed Union's first president, the Rev. John Blair Smith. His presidency was short as he died quite suddenly in I8oi. He was a man of rare intellectual talents, and his strong per- sonality 1nade a profound in1pression on the con1- lnunity in w·hich he lived, and his nam.e added greatly to the reputation of the infant college. The nature of his influence is well shown in the efforts that he n1ade to improve the moral tone of the college by exercis'ing a direct control over the life of the students. He strictly forbad gan1bling and prohibited the keeping of spirituous liquors in the rooms of the students. During his presidency, a rule was also adopted, forbidding any student to marry under penc1ty of expulsion. Dr. Edwards was buried in the church-yard of the First Presbyterian Church of this city, and the si1nple stone marking his grave to this day, in a Latin inscription which time has now aln1ost obliterated, comtnemorates him as \a man of keen talent, firn1 in right purpose, steeped and en- dowed with every exceptional learning, an ardent and strong defender of an inviolate Christian faith; and, in untarmished character, a bright light.\ First Student-\I hear Davis and Whitney are thick again.\ Second Student-\When weren't they THICK?\ WHITE, 229 State Street Near .[!Jarney's V AN CURLER OPERA HOUSE C.

THE CONCORDIENSIS VOL 34: FEBRUARY 25, 1911 NO. 17 II UNION DEFEATS COLGATE·. The Garnet Adds Another to Its Long List of Victories, the Score Being 33-14. Scoring 33 points to Colgate's 14, the Garnet five win last Friday evening in one of the fastest gatnes ever see.n on the arn1ory court. Frnm. the first, the tnachine like passing and precise team work of th~e Union players showed that the Maroon never had a chance. Union's scoring n1achine, too, was in fine condition, while the guarding was very close. McKinstry and Fair- bairn were the stars for the Garnet, while Ham- 111ond and Loeber shone for Colgate. The fir~t half started with a rush and after three short passes, Coward was able to cage the f1rst goal for Union. Frorn then on it was all Union's gatne, Colgate scoring but three points, all on free throws during the first half, the score standing 16-3. About the n1iddle of the half, Col- g-ate began to 1nake substitutions, hut was un- able to stop the scoring hy Union. lTnion kept the san1e line-up throughout. The second half started with both sides play- ing their hardest and as a consequence the gatne \\,-as Yery rougl1. Colgate, however, comn1itted the greater part of the fouls and only three \Vere called on Union. Loeber, the Colgate cap- tain, was disqualified for personal fouls, but through the courtesy of the Union players, he \Vas allowed to continue in the game. Moore, Loeher and Schraeclick were all, at various tin1e against Micks, hut were unable to do n1uch. :Curing the last few tninutes of play, Colgate, with nothing to lose, resorted to long shots in the hope of increasittg the score, but were un- able to n1ake 111any of the shots. Union's guard- ing prevented the Maroon frotn getting the ball past the center of the floor, while Hequembourg, McKinstry and Fairbairn often carried the ball the entire length of the floor for a goal. -• I The Une-up and score: CO;LGATE (r4) UNION (33) Roth, Hamn1ond ---~---------------- McKinstry Right Forward.

6 THE CONC:ORDlENSIS. GARNET LOSES '1;0 R:QCHESTER. In a Fast Game, Union Goes Down to Def·eat by the Score .of 29-12. Rochester defeated the Union five at Roches- ter Wednesday evening, in a ga1ne marred by n1any fouls and tnuch unnecessary roughness, by the score of 29-12. The Yellow tean1 started the gan1e with the intention of wiping out tl1e defeat adn1inisterecl by the Garnet players at Schenectady a few weeks ago and succeeded even farther than they inteHded. Howev·er, the gan1e was not as one-sided as the score would show, Rochester having a lead of but three points at the end of the first half, while son1e of the hardest and fastest basketball ever seen on t:he Rochester court was exhibited during the secolild half. Fairbairn, as usual, was the star for Union and was the one n1an who received praise from the Rochester papers. Kaiser made most .of the oaskets for the Yellow team and was one of the best players. McKinstry, who has been the Gar- net's biggest score getter was watched so closely that he succeeded in caging but one basket. During the entire ga1ne, the guarding was very close and the greater part of the baskets rnade were on long shots. Rochester was particularly lucky in these and scored most of her points on then1. Union's greatest trouble was her inability to carry the ball up to the basket. In addition to other troubles, the referee was unfan1iliar with the rules and was constantly engaged in discus- sions with the players. In the second half, Dunn, the Rochester guard, con1n1enced slugging and was put off the floor. The Union players, however, courteously allowed him to re-enter the ga1ne.

The baseball teatn will begin practice next Tuesday in the gyn1nasiu1n. At first there wi:ll be practice only three clays each week, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, at 4:30 p. 111. It will be very necessary for the squad to get down to work at once as the season begins ex- tretnely early. The first game is to be played on April 8th at New York against New York Uni- versity. The prospects for a good tean1 this year are very bright. There are nine men left frotn last year's squad. These men have played with each other before and so v·.rill be able to get together at once and play a fast game from the very start. Last year's n1en include Dunn 'rr, Mackey 'rr, Biche '12, Fairbairn '12, Shaw '12, Dennis '12, Peckham '12, Hutchins '13 and Giddings '13, while O'Keeffe, who played a star gan1e in the box last season, will be over fron1 the Albany Medical College and several other very fast men fron1 Albany, are expected to try out for the tean1. Since the n1ajority of the 1nen have played tog·ether before and the usual trouble of or- gantzlng an entirely new tea1n will be avoided, the men will be able to do signal work in the fJrst game which in past years has not been the case. With the n1aterial that should come fron1 the Freshn1an class, Union ought to have one of the fastest tean1s that has ever represented her on I Le clian1 'Jnd. PRATT HERE SATURDAY. Union will line up against the fast Pratt five on the local court Saturday. Pratt has a re- putation as having a fast tean1 and the game will probably be one worth seeing.

Two m.ore instalhnents of the psychology lec- ture course wer,e delivered by Dr. James R. An- gell of Chicago University before exceptionally large audiences in the cDllege chapel on Monday and Tuesday nights of the past week. The subjects treated were \Individual and This year the Christian Ass.ociation has for the first time undertaken a comprehensive policy in mission study. Five courses have been offered \Social Psychology,\ respectively. As the course proceeds the lectures seem to become more in-- teresting and the already large audiences larger as follows: I. ''The A w-akened Ernpire of China,\ l-ed by so that chairs have been borrowed on different occasion from Sillin1.an Hall with which the space between the chapel seats and the platform has been filled. On Monday night Dr. Angell discussed briefly the subj.ect of advertising during a part of the hour and con1pared the relative efficiency of tnany well known advertisements such as appear in our n1agaz1nes. He expressed the opinion that an advertisen.1ent should have one n1ain feature- or core as be called it-which should appear in every advertisement and which might be a name, picture of a person, scene, etc. The core should re1nain the san1e so that the impression on the n1ind n1ight be kept fresh and permanent; but the rest of the advertiserpent-printing 1natter or what not-should be presented frequently in uni- que and new ways so as to arrest the readers at- tention and keep him fron1 skipping over what would appear under ordinary circumstances as something he already knew all about. On Tuesday night Dr. Angell included in his course a short talk on the function of play in the clevelopment of children and during his talk cited n'lany an1using incidents relative thereto. The last two lectures of the psychology course will be delivered on 1\llonday and Tuesday nights of February sixth and seventh in the college chapeL The subjects will be \Co1nparative Psy- cholog-y\ and \General Genetic Psychology,\ respectively. THE 1912 GARNET. The first proofs have already been received from the printer and the work on the book is fast being con1pleted. The book will contain n1ore than sixty cuts of drawings and nearly two hundred other pictures. The book will break all records by appearing about April first, not on that day, however. Uhas. N ..

R tn1· TO THE BROAD- The subject of mission MINDED MAN. study, as presented at the college meeting last Mon- day by Wilbert Smith of the Student Volunteer Movement, is one that deserves the honest con- sideration of college men. The average college student is, naturally enough, most concerned with what is gotng on upon the can1pus. It is little that he knows of great world movements that are taking place in s orne of the greatest nations of the world. \But why,\ it n1ay he asked, \ought he to think of things outside of his fraternity, his class, his tea1n, and his college?\ Why? Because he has much to gain thereby. Stop and think for a minute. You came to Union to develop yourself, to get a wider view and a deeper understanding of the world, to receive broad culture and educa- tion. If your point of view is limited to the little part of life that you see within the college walls, you are dwarfing the possibilities of your college education. Mission study has a decided contribution to 111ake by giviug breadth of out- look, a world view-point, a knowledge of other r\eoples, of the ethnic religions, of the great world moven1ents of .today. The study of missions reveals some facts that you as a college man ought to know. Are you an engineer? If so, do you know that China has n.ore coal, iron and general resources than any other nation in the world, that these resources are practically untouched, and that there is hard- ly a power house in the whole empire? Are you interested in teaching? If so, do you knoN that China has just adopted a new system of education that will rival ours, and that s!-le will probably soon have n1ore students than any other nation in the world? Are you interested in poli- tics? If so, do you know that Turkey and Persia are just trying constitutional government? Are you interested in sociology or history? If so, what is the cause of the great tide of unrest in I nclia? :\nd all this is aside fro1n the fact that t ~c question of foreign missions is so essential t·) the Christian religion, that no argument. sho:~; cl he needed to convince Christian students of ns im porta 11 ce. ·ov STl AC no of tur ne1 \a1 be Cl o· b ti f t

Most col1ege tnen have con- siderable antipathy for the \grind by which is meant, of My dear Mr. Editor: You are in error about ''the first picture hang- course, the student who has no apparent aim in collegt, but the accun1ulation of a mass of book learnb1:g. This feeling is na- tural, and also justifiab-1e, 1 because the world needs today not mere book-worms hut broad, \all-around\ 1nen. The resulting tendency is to consider as the bes.t developed and n1ost commendable college n1an him who can fill the '\'rGarnet\ with the long- est string of college honors, because he has en- gag-ed in the greatest n1Rvl ber of student activi- ties. And just here a note of warning is needed, because in a college of Union's size there is a constant tetnptation for one rnan to become en- gaged in so n1any activ1:ties, that he has not the tin1.e to give to all of t~em the attention that they deserve, to say n·othing of giving serious thought to his regular c e1lege work. ing from the rear railing of the balcony on the right hand side.\ It presents, not the Reveren(l Jonathan Edwards the younger, second president of Union College, but the Reverend John Blair S1nith, our first president. In the interest of truth, which \is mighty and will prevail\ and which, \if ye know it, shall make you free,\- a great desideratum surely-- --will yott ·kindly give space for this correction in your colurnns. A portrait of President_ Edwards, a 1nan of mark but f.ar tnore virtuous than handso1ne, hangs in the library,-the first portrait to the left of Presi- dent Potter's. President Smith and President Edwards were Students of ability ar·e needed at Union in every college activity; bat it is far wiser for each man to concentrate his energy and ability upon a f.ew phases of work f·o-r which he is best fitted, and to which he can confine his interest and en- thusiasm. If such a c otlrse were followed, both the student activities and the regular ·college work would show increased efficiency. both of the Princeton line which has con1e down to us from former generations. Pr.esident Smith was somebody in his day. In Doctor Raymond's \Union University\ (Volume I, Chapter V) n1ay be found a brief record of his life written by Your friend and obedient servant, JOHN IRA BENNETT. THE EDITOR IN ERROR. 11nough the kindness of Professor Bennett, the editor has :learned that he was in error when saying in last week's issue that the first picture hanging ~lown fron1. the rear railing fron1 the balcony on the right hand side repre- sents, Jonathan Edwards, the younger. The portrait is really that of the Rev. John Blair Sn1ith, Union's first Jlre sident. The editor wishes to express to Professor Bennett his appreciation of the interest taken in the Concordiensis. Other criticisms or articles fron1 any of the faculty, alumni or students will also be appreciated Following 1s Professor Bennett's letter printed in full.

LaBarron, '13, the two- mile record holder, added to his laurels by carry- ing off first prize in the 6oo-yard dash. He did not need his 40-yard handicap to win, for he led the field frotn the start. Daly captured third place in the rso-yard dash, and Baker, 'I4, won second in the high jump with a mark of 5 feet and 4 incl;es and a 6-inch handicap. The other Union entrants were unable to capture a place. STUDENT PUBLICATION BOARD. The n1ernbers of the Student Publication Board of Union College are at present working over the constitution and by-laws for the Board. Meetings have been held in the Press Club room and it is hoped that within a week the matter will be in fit shape to lay before the student body. The n1en1bers of the Board include Presi- dent Richmond, Dean Ripton, Dr. Barnes, Faust 'r r, Bowman 'II, Gray 'II, Cavert 'II, Harden- bergh 'I2 and Hequen1bourg 'rz. Opp'ts.

--rH.E CONCOl{DlEI\JSl S. 11 EDITED BY GRADUATE COUNCIL CLASS REUNION. The classes of rgo8, rgo6, rgor, 1896, r8gr, r886, r88L, 1871 and r86I are to hold reunions this commencement and it is a pleasure to note that several of the classes have begun their prepara- tions. The class of r88r has been· most a~ve in this respect and under the direction of its sec- retary, Mr. Samuel P. McClellan, has prepared a good program for their thirtieth· reunion. On Monday, June rzth, at 6 p. m., they will hold a reunion dinner at the Mohawk Club. This din- ner is to be given by a resident member and fol- lowing it will come the election of officers, in- cluding a representative on the Graduate Coun- cil. Its program for Tuesday,. Alumni Day, is not ready for announcement further than that it will cover the entire day and wind up with an automobile ride and supper. WHO'S WHO. In the last issue of the Concordiensis there was an article on college efficiency., the material for which was furnished by Dr. Alexander Duane, '78. To quote from his article further we get in- formation of special interest to the classes. \Ex- cluding the earliest classes, which have less than ten surviving members, the banner classes are r863 with 28 per cent. of its men1 bers in Who's Who-a truly ren1arkable record-then 1858 with 21 per cent., r872 with 19 per cent., r849 with 15 per cent., r865 with ro per cent., r859 and r882 with nearly 9 per cent., and 1870 and 1876 with 8 per cent. Certainly the showing is one of which Union tnay well be proud.\ NOTES. . r8g2. William T. Dougan is chief engineer fe-r the Metropolitan Street R. R. of New York City. r88r. Alexander V. Campbell is practising law, with offioes at 203 Broadway, New York. William P. Wi1Hams is president of the Art Mar- ble Co., corner of Flourney and Rockwell Streets, Chicago. 1883. Rev. james Cantine bf Muscat, Arabia, has done m·uch to give Union a reputation atnong contempora!y 1nissionaries. His work as a teacher in Arabia has been n1ost sucoessful and receives atte11tion at the great n1issionary con- ventions. 1884. Rev •. Vi!. N. P. Dailey of Atnsterdan1 has recently s·ent the secretary of the Graduate Council copi~s of the te1ath, twentieth and twen- ty-fifth reu1~ion publications of his class. These books are weltl gotten up and might well serve as a n1odel for other classes. The sec·retary of the council would like to have copies of all such class books :as they are of great value as records. I88s. Mr. Rob-ert E. Speer, who recently spoke in chapel, congratufated us on the work of Har- vey DeWitt Griswold, D. D., of Lahore, India. Mr. Speer to:ld us that Dr. Griswold was one of the most :highly respected foreigners in North- western IncUa and a Sanskrit scholar of destinc- tion. r886.
