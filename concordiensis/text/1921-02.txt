The undergraduates have to take the lead and to show the alumni body that we are with the college first and last. If we show that we are in entire sympathy with the campaign and oversubscribe !)U·r quota then it is more tha:n an even bet that the graduates will follow our example. Our own wo-rk may be set as the \criterion for the entire drive. As we have said, we do hot yet know what sum is to be set for us. But if we sacrifice one soda a day for five years, we under- graduates alone shall raise over one hundred and fifty thousand dol- lars. We doubt very much whether the Graduate Council committee :which is running the campaign has set any such amount for the un- dergraduates but we know _postively that we can and should raise it. There is hardly a student here who does not indulge in ice cream a:t least once a day. And_ this could be sacrificed without any great inconvenience on the part of anyone.

And this is as it should be for Mr. Hanna was the ideal type oi college man, the type which more undergradu- ates should use as a model and try to follow in his footsteps. The college never had a better friend in any respect. Although an unusually busy man, he was always ready to give his time to the college. His purse was always open and it was to him that the President always appealed in the crisis of the college. And Mr. Hanna never found an excuse, never turned a deaf ear to our needs. The deceased kept up a steady correspondence with th.e President and always asked about the college. The triumphs oi the college cheered him as they do us and our temporary failures were felt as deeply in his heart as we feel them. Georgie Porgy-\Aw shucks!

' Good Printing . · . ' . . · BARBER SHOP How is a .Wireless: . ~ / Message Received? E VERY incandescent lamp has a filament. Mount a metal :Plate on a wire in the lamp near .the filament. A current · leaps the space between the filament and the plate when the filament glows. Edison first observed this phenomenon in 1883. Hence it was called the \Edison effect.\ Scientists long studied the \effect\ but they coJl.ld npt ex:plain it satisfactorily. Now, after years of experimenting w~th Crookes tubes, X-ray tubes and radi11m, it is known that the C'!lrrent that leaps across is a stream or '\electrons\- ex:ceedingly minute particles negatively charged with electricity. :, These electrons play an important part· in wireless q,mmunica- tion. When a wire grid is interposed between the filament and the plate ancl charged positively, the plate is aided in drawing electrons across; bL1t when the grid is charged negatively it drives back the elec- trons. A very small charge applied to the grid, as small as that re- ceived from a feeble wireless wave, is enou,gh to vary the electron stream. · So the grid in the tube enables a faint wireless 'impuls~ to control the very much greater amount of energy in the flow of ele~trons, and so radio signals too weak to be perceived by other means qecome per- ceptible by the effects th.a.t they produce. Just as the mpvement of a throttle controls a great locomotive in motion, so a wii,ele.ss wave, by means of the grid, affects the powerful electron stream.-: All this followed from stud:ying the mysterious \Edison effect\- l . a purely scientific discovery. No one can foresee what results will follow from reseatch in pure science. Sooner or later· the world must benefit practica.lly frorn the discovery of new facts. For this reason the Research. Laboratdries ~r'. t~:te' General Electric Company are concerned as much with investigations in pure science· as they are with the improvement .of industrial processes a:nji ptodu:cts. They, too. have studied the \Bdison effect;, scientifically. 1 The result· has been ;a new form of electron tube, known as the \pliofr9ri\', a tyPe of X-ray tube free from the voagaries of the old tube; and \the \kene- tron\ wh.ich is called by .electrical engineers a \rectifier'~ because it I has the property of changing, an alternating into a direct .current. All th.ese improvements fOillowed because the Research Labora- tories· try to discover tlle ~'Jhow\ of· thiiigs. Pure scie~ce alWays justifies itself. ' Genera: Gen.ea-al Office CO 532.

THE SNOWBALL NUISANCE Every year about this time, we suffer from the dreaded snow- ball. A student hurrying to classes is the target for a volley of small \Yhite missils 1.vhich are hurled with unerring aim and which sting if thry happen to hit you. The innocent suffers even more than the transgessor from the missiles. Why cloes a college man hurl snowballs? We thought that sno\\·bolls were peculiar to our age of knickerbockers and early adolescence. Perhaps, the adoption of knickers by the college man today may account for the frequency of the snowballs this season. Other youtbiul habits may be the concomitant of youthful dress.

Results showed that the colloids of metallic iron, nickel, and man- ganese are the most act.ive catalyzers £or this reaction. Attempts have been made to investigate the possibilities of Lead as a catalyzer, but this was made impossible by the inherent difficulty of preparing a colloid of this metal because the arc, which is used in pre- paring the colloids by Bredig's method, tore off comparatively large pieces of the metal instead of throwing into the medium particles of colloidal dimen- sions. The paper was illustrated by graphs showing the accelerating effect on cer- tain reactions of the various coUoids tried. These graphs were plotted from the data obtained in the research work.

The game was fast, exciting, and the score close at all times during the game. ·The Garnet quintet. started off with a rush and at the end .of three min- utes' play held the long end of a 7 to 1 score. The Army team, how- ever, caged a few baskets from the field and by consistently dropping in shots from the penalty line managed to keep about even with the Union team. Captain \J o\ Jones and \Tom\ Wilber were delayed in reaching the game on account of the ferry's not running at Garrison. This necessi- tated: starting Korngut at guard with Rinaldi and Simmons at forward with Brucker. Drohan replaced Simmons and Getman went to forward after about seven minutes of 'play. Three minutes before the end oi the first half ] ones and Wil-ber appeared 011 the scene and took the places of Drohan and Korngut. Easily the star of the game for the Garnet was \Wes\ Getman. He made four baskets from the field, two of V\ hkh were the direct result of ·'fol- low-up\ work Getman has been fol- lowing the ball exceptionally well this year. \Tom\ Wilber made three pretty baskets and a foul, and \Georgie\' Brucker tallied twice from the field and f.ive times from the foul line. \J o\ Jones and \Louck\ Rinaldi played the hard game they always do. Jones made a basket in the second half after a speedy cut. The game was unusually exciting in the second half. First one team would be one point ahead and them the tables would be reversed. Two minutes from the end of the .game Union led by a score of 30 to 29. A long shot h:~r Vichles and a foul shot made good by French put the game \on ice' for the Army and Union failed to score again i.n the last minute.

Time of halves-20 minutes. Garnet Cubs Defeated The Union Freshmen lost their week-end game to fhe strong Sara- toga High School quintet, in Sara- toga by a score of 27 to 15. The game was much closer than this score would indicate and the local freshmen were within a point or two of their oppon- ents' score until the last few minutes of play. At half time Saratoga led the fresh- men by an 11 to 9 score, but this two point lead was ·soon overcome by the Garnet cubs and as a result the score see-sawed back and fort'h until it stood at 16 to 15 with but five minutes to go. At this juticture, however, the high school team braced itself and to the amazement of the freshmen it piled up .a lead of twelve points by scoring five successive field goals and one foul shot. The summary: Iars are being carried in the dothing of people in t:his country or hidden in impwvised places of \safety.\ This money so vitally needed for the oper- ation of American industries, if in- vested in Treasury Savings Securities, would rl.ot only benefit the individuals ~Y earning iHberest for them, but it would al,so ben.efit the nation at large.
