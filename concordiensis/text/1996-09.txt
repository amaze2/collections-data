The Student Newspaper of Union College Since 1877 Westinghouse Resurrected by Nalini Gupta Staff Writer \The man upstairs in heaven gives us time off for good behav- ior sometimes, so I decided to come back to Union College, the place where it all bega11,\ said vol- unteer historian Charles Ruch as he impersonated the late George Westinghouse at the Nottexhibi.t inauguration last Sunday. With a white mustache, thick sideburns and an ebony walkingstick, Ruch took the role ofWestinghouse and recounted the saga of his lifelong contributions to scienceand tech- nology. President Hul1, Professor Frank Wicks of Mechanical Engineer- ing, Dean Christie Sorum, George Westinghouse IV, e~hibition di- rectors and a multitude of com- munitymembers attended the cel- ebration of the I 50th anniversary ofWestinghouse's birth. The ex- hibition took the form of a dra- matic presentation when Ruch entered the auditorium from be- hind a white screen and intro- duced himself as George Westinghouse. Ruch proceeded by sharing the details of Westingho1:1se 's life in a first-per- son dialogue accompanied by a slide presentation about his work, family and personal experiences. Westinghouse's mock resur- rection emphasized his humani- tarian approach to his work and his dedication to improving peoples' practical lifestyles. His achievements included; illumi- nating an entire 600 acre area for aspectacularChicagoFairby us- ing alternating current, harness- ing energy from Niagara Falls~ Historian Charles Rucll impersonating George Westinghouse.

Though Westinghouse spent only three months studying at Union College, he attributed much of his success to his expe- riences at the school. He worked closely with influential people such as Henry Ford, Tesla, and Lord Kelvin and was regarded as the world's greatest engineer in 191 0 when he was elected to serve as ASME president. .... Charles Ruch ended the presen- tation with the words Westinghouse lived by: \There are lots of ideas out there and we've just got to keep trying, testing and experimenting with them. After all, the man who never made a mistake never made anything.\ Union Steps Up and Out for A Night on the Town The Future of Delta Phi's House in Question deal with Delta Phi last year in which they gave the fraternity time to raise $200,000 from alumni in order to \arrest further decay.\ Unfortunately. a letter from Vice President Matnmola dated March 17, 1995 to the Presi- dent of the Delta Phi\alumni as- sociation gave formal notice that Union would close down the house and all residents would have to move out Delta Phi members failed raise the neces- sary funds, and the administration felt they had no choice but to close the house. by Stephanie Slobotkin News Editor This pastFri<lay, Oct{)ber4, the Social Commi~e pr€sented a \Night on the Town\ in Old Chapel.

Not only were . students able to socialize with their peers, hut administrators and faculty were among the social scene as well. The Michael Panza Band played from 9:00p.m. until12:30 a.m People danced, socialized and ate fried wantons, egg rolls, Swedish meatballs and a plethora · of desserts. The cash bar was available for all those of age, and the bartender, senior Jake Fruchter, made sure that everyone eligible had enough to drink: \I felt like Tom Cruise on his first nightofwork in 'Cocktail'.\ The night was orchestrated by Jesse Shaffer and Social Commit- tee Chairperson Matt Cohen. With Shaffer and Cohen as the driving force, as well as many volunteers, the \Night on the Town\ went off without a hitch. Senior Laura Felton offered her reaction: \It was a welcome change from the usual fraternity party stllff.\ Another senior, Nolan Farris, said: \It was better than Cats.\ continued on 4 Brandon D. Declet Staff Writer This fall we came back to Union and the house formerly known as Delta Phi was in the samestate of disrepair that it was last year. Plans to renovate the house or to demolish it have be€n rumored to have been made, but the house still stands at the end of the campus in a decrepit state. According to Dean Alford, no firm decision has been made about what to do with the struc- ture. Delta Phi officially owns the house until 2014, thus giving them the right to do basically what they want with the house. In the fall of 1994, the admin- istration apparently became con- cerned that the basic structure was passing into a state of disrepair. Delta Phi was notified of the administration's concern over the building and that money would need to be raised in order to reno\ vate it. Most seniors and juniors re- member Delta Phi and what the house looked like on the inside. It needed work but the cost to renovate the structure to current building codes was between $750,000 and $1 ,000,000. The administration forged a \It 'had electrical problems. plumbing problems, roof prob- lems, inadequate fire escape routes and glaring aesthetic prob- lems,\ said Dean Alford. The school is now left with a decay- ing structure on campus as well as no plan of action as to what to do with it. Currently, the Board of Trustees, the administration, and Delta Phi are trying to reach an agreement, but Union cannot do anything unless Delta Phi for- feits its lease which expires in 2014. Since the building has not been condemned, the school has no legal right to demolish the structure.

All of this, when com- bined with its need for the state- of-the-art teaching space, left no doubt in ourminds that this grant COME would achieve important strate- gic goals ofboth the college and the Foundation;'' Milas said. The F. W. Olin Foundation has been a historical supporter to ind~pendent colleges and uni'\ versities across the country. The tradition began in 1938 by Franklin W. Olin, and since his effort the foundation has grown to a current net worth of $300 million. Over 56 coll.eges and universities have benefited from the generosity of the F. W. Olin Foundation. According to Milas. their grants are \to make strong colleges stronger.\ \The night before. we were all so tired that many of us said we really didn't think we'd make it On.ce we got out there though, I had a lot of fun working with my buddies as we weeded out the garden and raked around the Junipers.

Orientaion advisors agree that the even.t provided a unique way for students to become part of the community. Orientation advisor, Shana Meyer has been interviewed by the local newspaper, The Schenectady Gazette. The leaders of some groups even found ways to make a ======~ .lasting impact in the.ir assigned projects as ori-entation advisor Sarah Ahart explains. \It was great to get up on top of the scaffolding in the bridge project and rebuild parts of the structure. We finished off by putti.ng our han~prints in the new coat of paint\ Ahart said. An vnusually large number of 594 first year students and 60 orien- tation advisors a-lso took part in the tour day orientation program which mostly followed a theme of educational entertainment. Seminars like \Hot Sexy and Sater\ and \Screaming with Pleasure\ involved novel fonns of presentation during which performers could be seen jug- gling and riding unicycles in Memorial Chapel.

Will Campus Ever See the New Library? Schaffer'sRenovation Construction Halted by Jody Mousseau Staff Writer Students who attended Union last year have heard rumors re- garding the construction of the li- brary. Present seniors had origi- · naHy thought that the renovation of the l:ibrary was going to affect theirsenior theses. You may have noticed that the library comple- tion date posted on the sign in front of Schaffer Library has been chang.ed from Fall 1997 to Fall 1998. Many of us have braved construction project after con- struction project on this campus, and it seems improvement on campus is an eternal process. Those who recall the Nott remem- ber the unattractive effects of the project, including massive scaffl :in g and lack of grass on the lawn surrounding the Nott, which con se~ uentially ended in the completion ofthe beautiful sym- bol <JfUnion College. What will the libfary construction entail, and what effects will it have on the Unioncommunity? Sch:affer Library was completed in 1 96S», and after o11ly a few de- cades; of use, the building is des- perately in need of renovation. Construction was supposed to begin earlier than presently planned, but was delayed due to • several factors, including the need for a fitnctional storage facility for the volumes which would be taken out of Schaffer Library, the delaying of the bidding of con- struction companies for the~li~ brary construction project, and the need to complete the fundraising for the project. A storage facility near campus ~as purchased, but during a severe rain storm this summer, it was detennined that the facility needed extensive roof work Jean Sheviak Acting Library Director, stated that it is anticipated thatthe storage facility will be ready No- vember 1.

Kaczynski, the pnme suspect m the \Unabomber\ case, appeared on 60 Minutes Sunday evening. Kaczynski's mother Wanda, his brother David andsister-in-'law, Professor Linda Patrick of the Union College Philosophy de- partment, all participated in the interview. They discussed their reasons for suspecting Kaczynski, their decision to tum him in, and their experiences since his arrest. Mrs. Kaczynski spoke of the early signs of Ted's strange be- havior. She described him as \apart aloof, alone .... a very so- ber child.\ When asked why they didn't seek help for him, she commented that his behav- ior had never been anything \gross.\ During Ted's years of isola~ tion, he expressed hostile feel- . ings toward his mother and fam- ily through letters. With d~ep regret, David commented, \this is not the same family we grew up in, this is not the same mother he is describing.\ Over the-years, David and his wife Linda. grew increasingly concerned about tl1e deterior~- • \ I • • < ' • 'o ,I tioil ofTed.

Bucinell Helps NASA Tak,e Off by Nalini Gupta Staff Writer Summer research at the NASA Marshal Space Flight Center provided fascinating ex- periences this year, especially for Ronald B. Bucinell, Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engi- . neering,at Union College, who worked on developing a future space launch vehicle. As part of NASA's Summer ,Faculty Program in Huntsville, Alabama, professor Bucinell spent his third summer working in the materials and processing laboratory with NASA scientists and engineers. His research in- volved the pioneering endeavor to develop components for use in a reusable, state of the art space shuttle. Buci11ell explains that in years to come, the manu- facture ofa reusable space ve- hicle will become possible with the use of reinforct?d plastics, unlike in the shuttles currently used by NASA whiclt are mostly compris,edof metals. Bucinell' s primary task has been to llelpcreate a reinforced plastic str()ng enough to endure the exe!fti on <Jf a space flight.

Four clever vandals began one of the most treasured traditions at Union College. This symbolic lion was a gift from Rev. Dr. J.M.W. Farnham as a symbol of \happiness good fortune and extended life.\ Unknowing to · Dr. Farnham his -act of benevolence was. tucked away in a barn until he announced his plans to visit the campus. The relic was pulled from stowage and placed behind the Presi- dents house. This is where the vandals came into play. They stole some black and white paint from the nearly C()mpleted Nott Me- morial and snuck into the President's yard and inaugural paint- ing ofthe Idol. Dr. Farnham never made it to campus that year, but in 1883 he arrived on campus and was shocked by the state of the Idol. \'I was rather disgusted when I visited Union and saw it in the fields behind the college. But it has f()und a place in the affections of the students I never expected, having become their local deity,\ Dr. Farnham said. Now as Union embarks on its journey to the 21st century, we are searching for ways to hang on t() priceless tradition. Announcement ofthe new Olin Center will advance Union's technology, but will witheranother tradition. Once again tech- nology prevails over tradition-unless we take a stand! As Hull stated in his commencement speech, we all need to take a stand. It is important to take a stand and preserve the integrity of all that is important and passionately fought for. That is why The Concordiens is wishes to propose returning to tradtion, rather than running from it. Next week a poll of the student body will be taken as to where the Idol should be relocated.

You ;re off on your way to your new classes. \Is the sum- mer really over?'', you wonder as you step into class. Huge amounts of work answer your question. Tl1e summer is indeed definitely over. Although there may not be frequent trips to the beach, or lazy days in the middle of the haps last year you didn't do quite as well as you might have liked, or you didn't have a chance to play a certain sport. The point is that this year will be what you make of it. It's time to start fresh. Say \'hi\ to that friend to whom you haven't spoken since freshman orientation.

Now, couldl possibly have the audacity to shoot my moyth off about Repub- licans and Democrats? Yeah, in the spirit of all things political I find myself thinking so much about the many troublesome is ... sues, problems, elected officials, red tape and green paint that I can't possibly hold it in. Let's take green paint, for example ... Is Bob really doing a better job of painting himself a pro-planet shade of green than Bill is? Well, hmm, that'~ easy. There exists an age-old gap between the environ- mental policies of the two ruling parties, and it tends to center around preserving business' prof- its on the one hand and We the People's stock of natural re- sources on the other. To place a finger on this split, let's examine the economic genius of candidate Dole. Mr. Dole supports two bills which, if he took the time to think aboutthem,tllightcausehi.m abit of chagrin. The first bill, courtesy of his cabinet-to-be, requires new environmental regulations to pass rigorous cost...:benefit analysis; and the kicker is a bill to cmn- pensate businesses for property- value loss due to any such regu- lations that migh.tsneak :by. How- ever, this makes Sense: c'1non, people, yvhy sh()u)d our country's businesses have to practice re- sponsible and ethical environ- mental policies? Let's just Iet the Feds clean up after them (at our expense), rigllt? Also, l must wonder to what extent Mr. Dole purports to \Weigh the economic cost of ravishing American wil- derness; sadly, I suspect here- ally sees a wh{ll~ lot of big-busi- ness-benefit. In keeping with our country's funatld interesting poli- tics, candidate Bill opposes both bills requiring rigorous Republi- can regs .. I wonder why, and I suspect I know. Candidate Bill enjoys the somewhat decent environmental reputation of his party, but does he really believe or understand it? After all, he is responsible for a different bill-my personal un- favorite bill-one which has al- Short Changed? President Hull, We are writing to protest the decrease in student work-study hours. We have been informed that Union College has decided not to give its workins students a raise, in spite of the passing of the minimum wage bill. In the past, students have worked 1 0 hours a week, for $4.25 an hour--a total of$1200 a year. It has been de- cided that we will now work 8.5 hours a week, at $4.50 an hour-- also a total of$1200 a year. This is NOT a raise. This is simply a manipulation of the minimum wage hike. ognized this fact, but instead has chosen to disregard the ef- forts that are made within its college community. If the pur- pose of work-study is not only for financial reasons, but also to educate students in the ways and means of future employ- ment, then Union, as our present emp·loyer, has been a poor example. Both Congress and President C I in ton agreed that the $0.90 in- crease in the minimum wage is necessary f()r the people living and working in this country.

In the midst ofWashington's follow through with its air strike policies against Iraq, the Republicans have been trying to turn President Clinton's actions into a campaign issue. How- ever, they have had very little success. The Republican Vice Presidential nominee, Jack Kemp, attacked the President on the administration's policy towards Iraq, pointing out that there was no definitive goal set by the administration yet. How about this: the Clinton Admin- istration responded to Iraq's failure to-respect the \no-drive zone\ that had beeri established by sending missi,Jes' and not Americans. How is it that Mr. Kemp feels the Administration should have reacted? Let me guess: wait until you figure out what exactly your policy should be, and in the meantime allow for Iraqi movements of aggres- sion to go unchecked. Of course, what Mr. Kemp would not elaborate on was what ex- actly his brilliant idea of how to deal with Iraq would have been. It seems to me that Mr. Kemp would probably be bet- ter off conducting football strat- . egy than foreign policy.

Election Watch Just the Beginning. Democratic and Republican National Conventions by Suzanne Dougherty Political Editor The end of tire s.ummer marked~ .the official kick.,off of tile 1996 presidential election <;ampaign with the Republican -and De~nocratic National Con- ventions. While both differed . in style and .conte11t, they served similar purposes: unifying their parties and pertraying positive · images of their candidates through tightly scripted, made- for-television extravaganzas. By the end of August, voters had been barraged with an in- flux of political good cheer. speeches, and policy promises. The Republicans were the first to have a running start into the fall race with their conven- tion in San Diego Augus-t 12- 15. With the primary goal of energizing party loyalists while expandihg the size and scope of the \big tent, \.Republican lead~ ers worked their hardest at dis- playing this new-found unity. Early on it was decided by party ·leaders that there would- ben<:~ return to the fiery debates oh abortion and other divisive social issues that marked the 1992 convention in Houston and threatened to surface again this year. Their platform, one of the most conservative in recent years, sparked controversy in the weeks preceding the con- vention. However, once it was adopted quietly at a morning session, the attention was ~ shifted to speeches by party leaders encouraging unity and inclusion. In attempts to reflect the party's new focus on diversity and moderation, Republican organizers showcased female .. and minority speakers at stra~ tegic times in the night. While these speakers dominated the podium, their representation on the floor was disproportionately low among the delegates. Colin Powell was given prime speaking time, the min- utes foUowing Nancy Reagan's heartfelt tribute to her husband, to reaffirm his support for the GOP.· The next evening Susan Molinari (R~NY).,. was given the honor to address the con- vention as the key'\'note speaker. Her speech was intended to appeal to mothers and career women, an audience that Dole and the Republican Party have had troubles connecting with. Prior to the convention, many Republicans were feeling dis- couraged with Bill Clinton's 15 point solid lead over Bob Dole. But Dole made a timely and hugely popular annou.ncement of Jack Kemp as Dole's run- ning mate. Then the new Dole economic plan, which wo!lld cut tax rates on all taxpayers by 15 percent over three years was introduced, and suddenly the mood of the Republican Party brightened considerably. Dole still faces an intimidating challenge- trying to unseat an incumbent with the nation at peace and the economy on t:he upswing. The Democrats launched their campaign to get Clinton reelected with the Democratic National Convention in Chicago from August 26-29. Just as the Republicans attempted to portray an image of unity; so too did the Democrats. Offi- cials went to extraordinary lengths to hi.ghlight the president's centrist image and lay the foundation for a second term. Clinton, in a detailed State- of-the-Union style speech, chronicled his administration's accomplishments and offered a look ahead to the future. The speech launched a campaign sprint in which Clinton is seek- ing to be the first Democratic president.to be reelected to a second term since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936. With an emphasis on policy, Clinton and. the Democratic Party outlined initiatives to ex- pand controls on handgun sales, to provide tax credits and de- ductions for higher education, and to increase fundin~ for cleaning up superfund toxic waste sites. These goals were proposed by Clinton in an ef- fort to maintain his weeklong theme: \to build a bridge to the 21st century, to meet our val- ues and protect our values.\ Convention officials and Clinton performed a delicate balancing act on the sensitive . issue of welfare refQrm. He had been taking heat from many liberal members othis party for signing the sweeping legislation to eliminate the federal entitle- ment of the. poor to welfare benefits. Despite this friction, the party's ideological factions have essentially agreed to set aside their differences. This was evident at the convention. The only words said about the welfare reform bill were uttered by form~r New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and c.ivil rights leader Jesse Jackson in their respective spe~ches at the convention. In the end, how- ever, they both agreed to dis- agree. Important Message in Congressional Primary by J oh·n Vero Contributing Writer This past summer presented itself with a hotly contested pri- mary for the Qemocratic Nomination to run for Congress in the twenty first congressional district of New York. The dis- trict includes Albany, Schenectady, and Rensselear counties and parts of Montgomery and Saratoga counties. Incumbent Democratic Congressman Michael R. McNulty was challenged by Lee Wasserman. The primary was held 011September 10. On the front page of the September 11 Albany Times Union, the headline read: \Democrats Stick With McNulty\. The ·primary was over. A winner was decided. There is nothing more to say. Or is there? Did these guys agree on anything? Any campaign, especially primary campaigns, highlight dif- ferences between two or more candidates. This was espe- cially true in this most recent campai.gn. McNulty and Wasserman see91ed to disagree on almost every issue that is important to the people of this district. They seemed to be at opposite extremes, not agreeing on anything. ·Wasserman stated in the December 2, 1995 Albany Times Union that he was challenging Congressman McNulty because . he too closely \mirrored\ the voting patterns ofNewt Gingrich. McNulty protested that this was not the case, and that he was not associated with the Republicans in any manner. Republi- cans. Here is something that both candidates agreed on: Re- publicans. On September 10, something interesting happened at the McNulty for Congress campaign headquarters on Central Av- enue in Albany. At about 11:30 PM, Wasserman and McNulty embraced and shook hands. They agreed to work together to ensure Congressman McNulty's return to Congress - and vowed to fight the Republican aggression on our cities, the disadvantaged, our elderly neighbors, our educational pack- ages, and the schools to which we will sameclay send our chil- dren. Residents ofthe twenty first congressional d.istrict know what Republican Newt Gingrich's programs (or la()k thereof) have done to inner Albany, Schenectady, and Troy and its most needy residents. We know what Republican Governor George Pataki wants to do to our state workers and wnat he has al- ready done to financial aid. We fear what a Dole/Kemp White House will mean to the future and strength ofour country. After the campaign was over, and the two men who ran for the congressional nomination highlighted their common goals, ·- the most important message of the campaign appeared: all must join forces to fend off the Republicans in this year's elections. All people, including students, canmake their voices heard. Nobody was more vocal in professing this message than Vice President Gore during his visit.to Albany last week. The Vice President congratulated both McNulty and Wasserman. He congratulated both of them not for a victory, or for the cam- paign, but for joining together to achieve their common goal: · stopping the Republican's vicious agenda. Al Gore stressed to an audience of about 1 ,000 students that if we join, like MeN ulty and Wasserman did, and incredible force will have emerged. If they join to tell the Republicans that they want to keep McNulty in Washington aud that they want to keep Bob Dole in Kansas, then he will probably remain there. The unity that I witnessed on September 10 between McNulty and Wasserman was powerfuL The message that I witnessed from the Vice President on September 11 regarding student unity was powerful. Unity is power. If it takes a primary campaign to achieve it, then good. If it takes the Vice Presi- dent to remind us about it, then good. It is just time to unite. Thanks Congressman McNulty for your years of dedication to public service for the residents of the Capital Region. Hats off to Wasserman, Union Class of 1979, who knows that unity equals power. Thanks Vice President Gore for reminding the students what a formidable force we can become. Thanks to. · the Union College student who just read this and hopefully will register to vote and actually.will do so on election day. Are you following this year's electi~ns?

.'IDII~ <!Inncoroicn.ziz Septem.Jier l9~ 1996 Page 10 ., \ Election VVatch The End of Welfare as We Know It? by Matthew Sandler Staff Writer The truth about the 1996 elec- tion is that Bill Clinton is either lucky or a master strategist, The welfare reform package that he signed made goodon his prom- ise to \end welfare as we know it.\ The Republicans took the initiative and did tli.e job. The President vetoed the two Re- publican plans, but then signed the latest one. The first two years in office he governed to the left. In 1994, he received a crushing defeat with the Repub- lican sweep of both houses of Congress. In the.spring of 1995, he was arguing that the Consti- tution gives him a role in gov- ernment. Now, he is back at the center. In the 1995 battle over the budget and debt ceiling between the White House and the Con- gress, Clinton stood his ground against the Republicans. This caused the Democrats in Con- gress to rally around Clinton. When he signed the wei fare bill in 1996, the Democrats were already fused around Clinton, long before the Convention this summer. Before the fusion, if he had signed the present wel- fare bill, which cuts money and sends the program back to the states ending the entitlement, before the fusion he could have had a revolt among his party. It is quite probable Representa- tive Dick Gephart (D-MO) or Senator Tom Daschle (0-SD) could have challenged Clinton early in 1996 for the nomina- tion. The Democrats are still in an uproar over his signing ofthe welfare bill, but Clinton pro- tected his flank. Now Clinton says he wants to build a bridge to the future. That is great, but bridges cost money Where wasthatbridge for three and a half years? Clinton will boast that he cut the deficit in half. That is true, but he increased taxes so much and added money to programs that he had so mu~h left over from the tax increase that he could . reduce the deficit. Had he cut more spending with the tax in- crease that he pushed through the Democratic controlled Con- . gress in 1993, the country would be better off from the higher tax payment. He also has a balanced budget plan which would cut less money out of Medicare and Medicaid than the Republican budget. Senator Pete Domenici (R-NM), budget committee chainnan, articulates the position that cutting money does no good if you keep a . flawed policy. The programs have to be changed, not just the dollar amounts. .... On CNN' s Headline News on Wednesday, May 11, Clinton said, \Social Security age might have to be raised and that means changes ... [may have to be made] in how the government calculates cost ofliving adjust- ments.\ This is a brave state- ment in an election year, but with Mr. Clinton there has to be caution. This faiJ, when he blasts the Republicans for their \dangerous cuts in Medicare,\ one has to remember that Tim Russert of NBC's Meet the a second from 1980 to 1996. $4.2 triUion = [1 ,ooo,ooo;ood'* 1 000 noted on calculator 4.2 ex- ponent 12}. Now, take [60 sec- onds/minute* 60 minutes/hour * 24 hours/day * 365 days/year * 16 years = 504,576,000 sec\ Even. with a balanced budget in 2002 and a surplus of $4 billion, the national debt will have climbed to over $6 trillion. Press showed the Republican and Clinton '.s Medicare propos- als to he $4 apart with the in- creased premiums from about $45 11ow to under $90 per month over seven years. l,r:J ad- dition, before a politician will touch Social' Security, they will hit Medicare, which is going broke in2002. This means that the ?resident will most likely cut Medicare in his second tenn, and ofcourseblamethe Repub- l·icans when they do the work for him. Clinton's comments about Social Security could be the groundwork for his blaming the Republicans. How does he do thjs'?. That. is his record. Cutting the deficit in half is great;but it is still over $160 bil- l ion a year. The national debt climbed from under a trillion dollars when Carter left office in January 1981 to where it is today at 5.2 triHion dollars. It was 4.5 trillion dollars when Bush left office. Clinton is not out of the clear the way he pre- tends t() be. Even with a bal- anced budget in 2002 and a sur- plus of$4 billion, the national debt will have climbed to over $6 trillion. The increase from 1980 to 1996 is over 4.2 trillion. That alnounts to $8,323.820396 onds]. Then divide debt, by the seconds over the 16 years. $4.2 exponent 12 I 504,576,000 = $8323.820396. Check $8323.820396 * 504,576,000= 4.2exponent 12. I understand this looks com- pi icated, but read through it again if you skipped it. The rea- , son I took the time to figure this out is that billions, let alone tril- l ions of dollars are so abstract. . I only did 4.2 trillion dollars, not the extra trillion, because it took 204 years to accumulate a debt of under a trill ion and 16 years to quadruple it. By showing $8000 dollars a second, it puts · the reality into the seriousness of the problem America is fac- ing. One m~y be asking, \Okay so what? Why do we care?\ My point.i~ that Clinton's words. are not going to cut it. With the baby boomers retiring soon, costs are going to escalate. It was estimated that to fund fu- ture retirees nearing 65 on the · present level of Social Security , would require a tax increase of 30%. Social Security is welfare. It is your tax dollars coming from your pocket and going into your grandparent 1 S check. There is no trust fund. In 1935 the system was great, with 16 workers to one retiree. Now there are 3.1 workers to every retiree and that number will continue to drop fast. Has Clinton ended welfare as we know it? Clinton wiH tinker with Medicare a little if he is elected to a second term and probably _leave the tough work to the next president. The President'sde- liberate falsehoods or vague truths about his intentions and the seriousness of thethreat against us do not bode well for our solving these problems i.H a bi-partisan way. Hi ow do I know there will be action on these problems? For one, when you go to the bank, you will see a .sign that says, «Backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.\ Well, our debt is funded by bonds. Bonds pay out interest ~we '811$he over d,iffering years. Failure to pay one bond on time would lower the credit rating and people would not invest in the United States. Wewould have .to raise interest rates extremely high to attract capital. ·This would result i·n a.run ori the banks to withdraw savings. The last time that happened was in 1933 at the startofFDR's term. The world economy would spi- ral downward, because every-· thing is linked. Look .at how Mexico's devalu~tion of the peso in December ,J.994 caused such a panic that Clinton had to marshal a $50 billion Joan to save the peso. Imagine what would happen with the dollar.

Tltese disheartening statistics sh()oU]d not be allowed to obfus- catetlre equally real medical suc- ces~es. For example, there have been striking reductions-in deaths fr<>rm Hodgkin's disease, Burkitt's ly1nphoma, testicular cancer, cer- tain types of hone and muscle · caflcer, and several childhood catlcers. The American Cancer S()ciety reports that the death. rate ia dtildren has fallen by 62 per- cettt s.ince 1960. Lung cancer mortality has dropped by 3 per- cetlt in men between 1990 and 1992, a credit to the decline is Sl11()ki ng over the past decades. Breast cancer mortality rates fel I by m()re then 5 percent between 1989 and 1993 due to earlier de- tection and improved treatment. S<> lllany fonns of cancer have had declines in mortality rates that if Where We Stand After 25 Years oiie ignores lun.g cancer ( a largely preventable disease), the aforementioned 6.3 percent in- crease from 1973-1992 becomes a 3.4 percent decrease. How does cancer arise? The term \cancer\ refers to more than 100 forms of a disease which can arise from almost every tis- _ sue iJ.? the body, each fonn with its own unique features. Despite the d.iversity of tumors, the past two decades of research have shown that the basic processes that produce malignancies are conserved. The 30 trillion cells in a normal body live in a complex, synergetic relationship of inter- connected regulation.- The con- trolled maintenance of this rela- tionship is vital for normal func- tion. Cancer cell~ shrug their respon- sibility to the-~ rest of the body. they ignore signals intended to regulate their growth and trans- gress into areas which normal cells would not enter. Each tumor cell descends from a common an- cestral cell which, at one time, ini- tiated a genetic program of im- proper reproduction . .The faulty genetic program is the result of mutations in specific classes of genes. These genes provide the key to understanding .the pro- cesses leading to cancer. One pathway towards cancer involves two classes of genes called proto-oncogenes and tu- mor suppressors. Proto- oncogenes make proteins which induce cell growth! They become carcinogenic oncogenes when mutated. Oncogenes create ex~ cessive growth stimulating pro- teins or an overactive form of the protein. Tumor suppressor genes, on the other hand, create the proteins which \apply the brakes\ of cell growth. They con- tribute to cancer when they are disabled and can no longer regu- late the cell. Fot a cancerous tu- mor to develop, mutations must occur in at least half a dozen of the founding cell's growth-regu- lating genes. Both the growth a:nd stop sig- nals of cell regulation function similarly to a four mart relay event. Actually, there are more then four so Carl Lewis would have been able to get onto this team without COf!troversy. Like the baton, the signal is passed, either from a neighboring cell or the tar,. get cell Itself, to .the external por- tion of a receptor on the target cell's surface. The receptor is a protein which transverses the outer layer ofthe·cell. The recep- tor relays the signal to the inside ofthe cell where it is taken in the form of cytoplasmic relay proteins to the nucleus. In the nucleus, proteins known as transcription factors activate the genes which make the cell reproduce. Genetic mutations 111 the proto- oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes may interrupt the signal re- lay oraugment it. This causes the cell to lose control .of its growth rate, contributing to the fonnation of a founder cancer cell. What Causes Cancer? Tobacco and Diet Tobacco and diet, the top two causes of aH cancer deaths, are also the easiest to correct. To- bacco smoke is the single most lethal carcinogen in the U.S. Be~ tween· 50 and 60 percent of the cancer death:? in the United States can be attributed to tobacco .. smo.ke and diet Smoking alon~. causes 30 percent of the cancer deaths. Compare that to genetic causes which are responsible for fewer than 5 percent offatal can- cer cases. Even though the risk of a few forms ofcancerhave di- minished dramatically in devel- oped col!-ntries, the most signifi- cant forms of the disea.se have escalated. Cancer of tht: lung, breast, prostate, colon, and rec- tum have all become more fre- quent in nations where cigarette smoking, unhealthy dietary hab-. its and exposure to dangerous chemicals at work are common. Cancer is caused by two types of carcinogens. One class dam- ages genes which are involved in the regulation of cell growth and migration. For ex~mple, these might affect the proto-oncogenes · or the tumor suppressor genes mentioned above. The second kind of carcinogen does not mu- tate genes but instead enhances the growth of tumor cells. Whether a carcinogen will cre- ta!Jgn:anc:ydepends o~ sev- eral factors. Factors for cigarette smoking includ~: frequency of smoking, level oftarpercigarette, anddurationofthe habit. The risk is significantly amplified if th,e habit is taken up while very young. The risks vary with each type of cancer. On average, smok- ers are only twice as likely to de- velop cancer of the bladder, but are eight times as I ikely to develop cancer of the lung. Food!i Only diet ri vats cigarette smok- ing in number of cancer fatalities each year. Saturated (animal) fats, such as those foul)d in red meat, are strongly I inked to both colon and rectal cancer. They have also been implicated in prostate can- cer. Among non-nutrient food ad- ditives, only salt appears to be a significant contri butorto cancer. Studies done outside of the U.S. suggest that high salt intake may contribute to .stomach cancer. On the bright side, drinking coffee does not seem to be I inked to can- cer. Also, it doesn't seem to mat- ter how the drink is sweetened. In reasonable quantities, artificial sweeteners do not cause cancer . What a diet lacks may be just as important as what it contains. A voiding fruits and vegetables ,can contribute significantly to many different kinds of cancer. It is possible that the antioxidants in these food may be able to neu- tralize carcinogenic substances, called free radicals, made by our own bodies. Obesity in all stages oflifecan contribute to cancer. In adult- hood, for instance, it increases the risk or uterine, colon, kidney, and gallbladder cancers. Drinking large quantities ofal- cohol, particularly by smokers, increases the risk of cancer of the upper respiratory and digestive tracts. Alcoholic cirrhosis fre- quently lea.ds to cancer of the liver. Even though modest drink- ing seems to reduce the risk of heart disease, converging data suggest tl1atas few as one to two drinks a day may contribute to breast and perhaps colon and rec- tal cancer. It has been estimated that alcoholic beverages contrib- ute to 3 the 30 percent attribut~d to diet, of can- cer mortality in the developed world. Minimizing Cancer Risk Of the 550,000 people that will die this year from cancer, more than half could theoretically be prevented. For many people, mini- . mizing the risk of cancer requires significant changes in life-style. A cancer death can be avoided through a combination of preven- tion and, if a\'tumor forms, early detection. Tips for prevention include never smoking, or quitting if you already smoke. On aver- age, after about l 0 years, an ex- smokerwill be in the same low risk group as a nOJ1smoker. lh addi- tion, reducing alcohol consump- tion to fewer than two glasses a day would decrease the risk of upper respiratory and gastrointes- tinal cancer. It is possible that a vaccination against infectious agents that are known to cause cancer could aid in prevention. The only vaccine available now for this purpose prevents hepatitis B infections. Eating vegetables and fruits plays an important role in preven- tion. Diets should be high in veg- etables, fruits and legumes (such as peas and beans), and low in red meat, saturated fat, salt and sugar. Carbohydrates should be eaten in the fonn of whole grains. For example, eat whole wheat bread and brown rice instead of white bread ~nd rice. Added fats should come mainly from plants and should be unhydrogenated. Olive oil appears to be especially good. It is not that difficult to improve your odds against cancer. .Just by exercising vigorously for 20 minutes a day, eating one more serving of leafy vegetables a day or consuming only one serving of red meat a week could reduce your risk of cancer mortality by about one quarter.

They may bleed us dr:y when we go to them for books, but you can always count on our benevolent friends to come up with insightful solutions for a widerangeofsocial problems. In this case I refer .to the enlightened indivich.mls who invented the idea of issuing every entering fresh- man with those cute little \Union\ neck lanyards. Some may wonder why every freshman on campus would sud- denly start wearing their keys on a necklace-It's hard to believe that the bookstore has made the pocket obsolete.- Naturally, you may wonder at ''Check the Neck'' my elation over a long, ropy, key- chain. Sure, you say, it's inter- esting to know who the freshman are with just a glance, but a \so- lution for a social problem\-· I doubt it. The significance of these gar- net neck ropes is much more than trivial. Everyone should be fa- miliar with this scenario: you're getting Sunday dinner at West, and you end up face to face with someone. That someone says \Hi\ and you can't remember if you know them. Are they just being friendly, or are they an old friend? Sure it's been a long sum- mer, but memory loss is embar- rassing. Now, with the advent of the red-ropes; all yott have to do is \check the neck\ and many po- tentiaH y embarrassing situations can be a\lerted. To \check the neck,\ simply glance to the neck region and inspect for the garnet key cnain. A positive result indi- cates a freshrnan {you don't know them). Unfortunately, a negative leaves you uncertain as to whether you know them or not. My \check the neck\ plan has several other applications. For the gentlemen: having a hard time placing people with the pictu~es in your bouse's copy of the cl~ss of2000 face book? A neck check will eliminate any confusing up- perclassmen from the crowd an<l free him up to Ziero in on the in- tended target.

J:'ou make the choice w.heTe tradition should stand! We're Better Than The Blue Angels Wild WildWest by JeffDruzba Staff Writer Union's class of2000 received an unexpected surprise for its ori- entation exercises. Apparently, this year's orientation committee spent much of its budget on high performance (not to mention high priced) aerial acrobatics squads. Arriving parents and freshmen were impressed, to say the least, with exactly how close the Blue Angels could come to West and the Nott without actually hitting them. After parents left though, the true cost of having the Blue Angels flying overhead was re- vealed Due to the Blue Angels' enormous appearance fee, fresh- men were reduced to volunteer- ing and perfonningcharitable acts in Schenectady in exchange for food and clothing. The city re- sponded to most of the freshmen in their time of need and should be thanked for its generosity. Of course, survivors fear that fellow classmates Ricky-felamarini and Cheryl Wilson, both ofthe class of2000, may have fallen victim to.starvation. Oh, what a price we pay for those Blue Angels' I've been wondering what I should do with my life after Union, and I think I've found the answer. I'm going to be a Blue Angel. Can I get there with my major in English? Yeah,' sure, I don't have years of military and precision flight experience, hut I pick things up pretty quick. I'm good with remembering things in .order and say .... acrobatic routines in jets that travel faster than sound. Maybe that's not such a good idea though. If I were a Blue An- ' . gel, I could just imagine the daily hardships I would have to endure I meet some people at a bar and later, the question ofmy profes- sion comes up. That's when I tell everyone that I'm a Blue Angel. «Blue Angel my left foot!\ they all say as they walk off. I'm ]eft behind pleading, \Come on guys, I ain't fib bin' ya! I'm really a Blue Angel.\ If I knew one of the Blue An- gels, I would ask him ..... Nowtell me this. Is it true that you guys are lucky with the ladies or is it one of those things that works against you like when all those superrriodels say thatthey stay up for hours on weekends eating ice cream and waiting far men, any men, to call and ask them out\~\ Is it really worth all the pain to be a Blue Angel\~ It's an impres- sive job to have o11 y6ur resume but i.f it's an emotional hell out- side of the job, is it really worth it? We all want to be Blue Angels on the surtace but, deep down, we're all pretty lucky just to be who we are. 1 don't have a really fast plane but l've got a bike that goes fast when I ·ride downhill ... and I can make the booming noise myself. .

Spiderinan! Do- ing things like no one can!\ This theme song can beheard echoing through the halls, as it seems the wild wild west has a new des- perado in town. No, not the wild west full (Jf ghost towns, saloons and cowboys, but the wild halls of West College. Although it may not be as dangerous as the real western frontier, the dorm known as West is certainly filled with its sllare of mayhem, crazi- ness, and just good fun. This has caused West Co liege -to earn the reputation as being the most cov- eted residence hall for freshmen. One sucl1 example of the sort of crazy acts that can go on in west can be best portr-ayed by the hilarious wall climbings of one parti cui ar student. West College'sown Spidennan. (a.k.a. freshman Greg Auerbach) has been known on several occasions to take on superhero-! ike charac- teristics an<i scale the walls of the hallways defying gravity as he sings his favorite co1nic book character's theme song. However, students hanging from the· ceiling and climbing the walls are not the only things one has to worry a:bount encountering while venturing into the l1allways of west. After navigating your way ·around the piles of recycables lining the hallways, you rnight just be tackled to the ground as you may have acci- dently stumb~ed into the middle of a ••hallway footbalr' game. If not, beware of the \marker theives;' who under the cover of darkness mam the halls pH fering all the markers from the marker boards, and then deposit them in a large pile outside of some un~ suspecting victims door. Markermaddness seemsto be an on.golng theme thus far in these first two weeks of school for freshmen. One morning residents ·of the fourth floor awoke to fin<! the words '\Fouth Floor Sucks\ scribbled i11 marker across their walls. Also, one particular stu- dent fell victim to marker· . maddness. He wa.s unknowningly the victim of a viscious tic-tac-toe game that happened to be pi aye'd all over his face, chest, stomach, back an<l legs, as he had imbibed a bit to<1 much that evening to notice the graffiti being placed all over hiis body. It is· the whole atmosphere of west that attracts people to it People from Fox, Davidson, South and Richmond are quick!}' discovering that after only two weeks, west is definitely the pla!i;e to be. As freshman Ben Yaffee· puts it \West is a good place to I ive, its so easy to meet people, yet at the same time difficult to stay on task· and do your work as people are always popping in and out ofyourroom.\ The views of another student definitely sums up tbe feelings of many living in west. \West is a great place to live, as there is such a variety of people, ranging from 'psychos' and 'ath I etes' to 'alco- holics' and of course, those stLJ- dious ones like me\ said freshma.n Frank Fazio. Occurances J·ike these mell- tioned are definitely nothing ne'IW to West College. West has trad:i- tiotlally been known as a haven for the wild and untamed fresh- man of Union.' This micivilized behavior was illustrated on nu- merous occass,ions last year. There was a strange and unex- plainable fasination with fire drills and many freshmen were vissiously forced out of the:ir co1nfortable bed in the iniddle of the night. A strong stom1chwas a necessity for one to veature ii1to the bathrooms after a Friday or Saturday night ofinte11se alcohol consumption. One Lmsuspecting freshman came back from his classes Oi:te day only to find his bed \relocated\ to the stairwell two floors below his. Even with the frequent annoy- ances, West is still a great place to live. Christine Bower, a fanner fourth floor resident states \Liv- ing there [West] gives you an opportunity to meet a truly di- verse group of people and creates a sense of a mini-community.\ Whether you and y<>ur roomate have become instant best friends or you are both hunting down utensiJs'to gouge each other's eyes out, its. a good idea to get to know the folks in yout \commu- nity\ specifically one's own floor. This way when you and your inseparable new buddy ap- pear to be auditioning for a guest spot on WrestleMania or you find yoLirselflunging atyourroomate with a fork, you can escape and go hang out with some friends from your floor. There is so much you can do as a floor. Last year floor funttions included trips to the mall, invit- ing in a local tatoo artist and a massuse,-decorating the floors for Halloween, and painting the Idol, as well as each other. Your able- bodies RAs would more than likely be glad to help everyone with these, as well ·~s any other suggestions. Living away from home is a big . chang~ form any people. Before C<]ming to Union, most of us were not accustomed to sharing bath- rooms with so many people, but o.nce you get to know your floor family and get over the crazy occurences, \West\, as one fonner resident said, \becomes a home and notjusta place to live.\ Even though living at West (as well as the other residence halls) can be a little crazy at times, try no to let the first few·weeks of chaos overshadow the great times everyone is about to discover.

We begin as poor Freshmen, spat from the security of a wann hearth and homemade dinner into the far colder hands of Union College. What do we have to look forward to? Slowly moving to~ wards the inevitable expulsion from acadamia to none other than that dreaded \real world.\ Wow, we've heard abstractreferences to this real world that. lies just be~ yond the metal gates of Union. Seniors on the brink ofthe inexo~ rable quiver in their docker shorts at the idea of providing for them ... selves. Well, I certainly can't at- test to the horrors of this so called real world and couldn't even try to paint a picture. l fear I'd be hard .pressed to find many atten<l~ ing this institution that could por~ tray a world of responsibility where actions lead to logical con- sequence. No matter, my inter- ~F,· est I ies merely in what this higher teaming or higher education gig is all about. How do we fill the gaps between the primary leap into college and the devastatingly unavoidable exit? Okay, so we drink. 1 mean HUH, we drink beers. Still, after wading through the sepulchre of dead hops at multiple houses over numerous nights, I felt a tugging in my pleasantly numbed mind. \Glug itwent. Itrepeated itself over and over until slowly the ''glug, glug\ evolved into a \you're screwing up buddy, with twenty seven thousand dollars. You're missing the God damn point.\ I don't know about you, reader, but when my mind starts quoting prices and swearing at me, my ears perk up. Much to my soul's dismay and my liver's chagrin, I\ began to look deeper and further. So what ai1swers have I summoned? Surprisingly few. One epiphany which has moldered over in my brain lies in the fact that our four years here are probably a surprisingly accu- rate microcosm of the road we will travel for the rest of our ex- istence. Those who party all the time at Union will probably fol- low the easiest trend for the rest of their I ives. Those who never leave their rooms or their com- puters will probably never be able to truly enjoy the fruits-of their labors. Likewise, those who spend their time making Union a better place. will probably make every room they enter a little nicer before they leave. Essentially, I feel Union stu~ dents lack a sense of discipline or purpose. My fear is that the in~ ability to trace the consequence of our action will follow us throughout life. I can make no global recommendation as to how this can be fixed. The only cure I can conjure up lies individually, with eachstuden1 taking the time to think about what they're doing. If you can do this I now implore you to do what's right, not con- venient, fun or easy (although, this may often prove the case) but merely what is right. Once we have all started thinking and be- come cognizant of and deliberate with our actions, l feel we can fig- ure out what the hell we really are supposed to do here. Orientation ... Been There, Done That, Love It by Chrissy Foster and Stephanie ::ihupe · StaffWriterY As the droves of freshmen be- gan to arrive here at Union, we found ourselves contemplating the whole freshmen experience. Our conclusions wen~ rather star- tling. ln fact, they began to make us yearn to be eternal first year students for many reasons. First of all, freshmen had it great dur- ing Orientation. They arrived at Union and had over sixty upper- classmen (in what was eventually determined to be salmon-colored shirts) spending over twelve hours a day answering their nu- merous questi.ons, providing their deep and thought~provoking wis- dom, and, above all, making sure that they were having fun. What other time during your four years at Union do you get to play a group game called \Sex~' in broad daylight in front of the Nott with- outgettingwritten up by security? . Major bonding experience. The fun~filled four-day fest known as Orientation was jam- packed with activities for the freshmen to participate in. One of the most popular events was the comedy show entitled \Ho~ Sexy~ Safer,\ in which Lisa Kushell entertained the students wi'th frank discussion of sexual behavior, condom usage~ the. many practical uses ·Of Saran Wrap, and of course, mastttrbation ... evidently one of her favorite topics. We'd like to see the hook-up statistics from after that show! Saturday night's festi·;ities were centered around Club U which, unfortunately, is now just one big blur to the salmon~clad members of the student body present that night. But anyway .... the event was definitely a huge success, as it was a great chance for the freshmen to meet one another in a non-structured setting. Not to say that they f!1· membered those encounters the next day, but it was definitely the thought that counted. Up until this point one of the main com- plaints made by freshmen was that they only met the nine or ten students in their partjcular O.A. group. Mariy students felt con- fined by the structured schedule and the lack offree time during Orientation. However, it was ap- parent that after Club U the .:;tu- dents found ample time to spend with their new \friends.\ Prob- lem solved. For many students, the climax of Orientation occurred with the arrival of one of the most coveted of all items on the Union cam~ pus-the freshmen facebook, af~ fectionately termed the \meatbook\ for rather obvious reasons. Especially since the stu~ - dents had to look up wlio the hell they were with the night before at Club Ul For when this elusive little maroon \bible\ appeared on the scene, all attention was fo- cused on pouring through the pic- tures, labeling, ratit1g, discussing, and unfortunately sometimes breaking into laughter, depending of course on the picture. Some freshmen we spoke with, how~ ever, were dismayed to discover that personal campus phone num~ bers were not I isted under each picture. Perhaps dialing I 000 plus the last name has proven to be too tedious a task when under the infl uence .... hmm. We sym~ pathize. But on a serious note, Orienta~ tion was chalk full of educational events to promote awareness of issues dealing with college life. Katie Koestner, who has visited Union before, gave an amazing presentation on her personal date rape experience. An eye open~ ing, but scarcely attended Diver- sity Wotkshop, taught students to look beyond stereotypes, which are rather prevalent here at Union. A II right, enough with the seriousness ..... what was up with study skills? As Rawson Thurber so eloquently stated mid~presen~ tation, \Is this a joke?\ And then there was Rock the Vote, which was basically as much fun as get~ ting hit by a rock (sorry all of you Poli-Sci majors). Community service can be summed up fairly easily-getting down, dirty, and sweaty in Schenectady is always a good time_ Enough said. Then there was the Scavenger Hunt in which the missing items were ap~ parently the students. Bummer. But despite these minor glitches, Orientation was incredible. It was an awesome bonding experience, not only for the class of2000, but for theO.A 's as well. So finally, as Orientation had its end, so does this article. We dug down into the bottom of our souls to give it a snazzy ending, but came up with nothing.

Directedby Ringo Lam. Rated R, Columbia Pictures. R:ating: ** (outoffour) Jean-Claude VanDamme has not had a hit in a very long time. After Timecop, his breakthrough into the mainst?eam, he and Uni- versal Pictures (the studio which releases most of his films) have treated audiences to obnoxiously loud action-fests like Sudden Death and The Quest (his direct- ing debut!). Perhaps Universal, tired of losing money on this movie star (notice the word \ac- tor\ was not written), dumped him. So, Van DammetumstoColum- bia, the only major Jllovie studio not to have a single hit this entire year, to revai\np his image and make people actually want to see carnage and bullets flying through the air all over again. Under the direction of noted action filmmaker Ringo Lam, Maximum Riskis at its best when uhe surprisingly few action se- quences (all of which were fea- tured in the television ads) occur. Unlike in Sudden Death, when Van Dainme barely flexed a muscle and instead let his pistols do the talking, Van Dam me has to deliver a few kicks and punches to the bad guys and save himself anumberoftimes. LammakesVan Damme work for his obscenely high paycheck, as the star hurtles himselfbetween oncoming trains, falls three stories from a balcony, and gets pushed between two moving cars and knocked to the street. As in Double Impact, Van Damme plays twin brothers here, but fortunately for the viewer, one gets killed off in the opening se- quence. Van Damme#2 (hereto- fore referred to as \good Van Dam me\) discovers that this was his twin brother, a man who was trying to escape from the Russian Mafia in New York, and who was killed in Paris while trying to get in contact with his twin brother. The good Van Dam me flies him- selfover the B,ig Apple and finds himself in a Russian Nightclub, where the Mob thinks he's the twin brother and tries to kill-him. Fortunately for him, the good brother gets a few make-out scem::s with Natasha Henstridge, the woman from Species who was the other brother's flame. Well, it's good that she keeps her love interests in the same family, al- though male viewers thinking they'll see ll'IOre ofHenstridge in her birthday suit will be fairly dis- appointed (although the two do get a •ove scene, it's over in amil- lisecond). The good Van Damme, trying .. to stop the Mafia, find out the identity of the brother he never knew existed, andmak.epassion- less love with Henstridge, ends up uncovering some secret loot in a bank and a confessional tape from his brother. The plot, which does not break new grotmd in ac- tion storylines,.meanders along at a rather slow pace, and Lam is wise to break up the monotony with some cleverly-staged action sceries. Ultimately, however, the action is too sporadic to justify the long waits, and the actors (all ofwhom are general unknowns) are not ex.citingto watch. It's as if somem:Je in central casting said, \We need some people to play the Russian Mafia. Get me the usual bald-headed henchman, the boss with an evil accent no one can identify, and a Mafia King who looks small and weak but com- mands power.\ The result play the film alongside any Mafia-ori- ented detective piece from the l980s,andyou won'tknowwhich Is which. In the end, the only umaximum risk'' involved is the one Van Damme is taking on his career. Can he affor.d anotherbomb? Well, it's hard to tell ifthere 's any hope left in the world, because one of the coming attractions before the film was a new movie with Steven Seagal and Keenan Ivory Wayans, The Glimmer Man. The problem is, it's an action comedy. Seagal ... a comic?!

. ,ports . · . · . · . . · . · WI1e Qlom:orllimsis • September 19, 1996 • Page 18 Men's Soccer Wins Overtime Thriller Women's Tennis Fall Preview by Nick Kamrnerman Contributing Writer. This past Saturday and Sunday the Union soccer team kicked off their season with the Union Invi- tational. This annual event draws New York University, MIT, and SUNY Genesseoout toGanis Field to join the Union Dutchmen in a four-team, two-day tournament. Coming offlast year's disappoint- ing season, Union was looking to start this season off right with a couple of wins at home. Saturday's game against MIT eAded up being a real test for Union as the game went into over- time tied at 3. However, the Dutchmen conquered the day as they soundly beat MIT 2-0 in OT for a 5-3 -victory_ This year's Union squad is still a ve,ry young one. Surprisingly, there are only five seniors and no juniors on the team. Making Union's team just a little younger. starting center halfback senior Nick Zarelli was lost for the sea- son as he went dowt:J with a bro- ken ankle early in Saturday's game. So with a team crying for leadership, senior co-captain Ted Doran took a center pass off of the head of ··sig\ Steve Baumgartner and in turn headed the ball into the back ofthe net. MIT quickly fired back putting one past freshman goalie JeffTho~ mas to even the score at one. Co- captain GeoffSiperoly proceeded to take Ryan Cohen's cross pass and fire a low line drive into the back comer of the net. Union took the I ead again, yet on I y for a short time. Just before the end of the half, lV;IITcame back to tie the gameat2-2. Halftime must have been marred with bewilderment for Coach Nardiello and h.is boys. Aside from the fact that they had given up a lead twice, they also had to deal with the loss of Zarelli, and the burden of inexperience. Union needed to come out hot and score a goal or two and put MIT away, but this did not happen. Instead, MIT jumped out to an early lead with their third goal of the after- noon. The fmts at Garris Field were disappointed as they were hoping to see a little more enthu- siasm from this young team. For- tunately, the freshman took over and at this pointgave UBion soc- cer a boost for the future. Soon after MIT took the lead, Union freshman Mike Co()k fired back with an unassisted goal that was bam out of a swarming offense and persistence. There. was no more scoring in regulation time, and the crowd was treated to over- time. -t- Afterthisbreak, Llnlike the break at the half, the Dutchmen came out to win and that they did. Sipperoly fired a shot that the MIT goalie was able to save but not able to handle. Once again the young pesky Union team was able to seore again when Bryn Heath nailed the loose ball to give Union a 4M3, lead which they held onto through the end ofthe first over- timeperiod. By t11is time the ga1ne was over for MIT. Union even by Mary Sch.ultz Staff Writer scored again ln the second over..

Everett Staff Writer Despite the presence of power- house University of Rochester, the Union mens Cross-country team (2-1 ) soQI1dly_ established themselves as a team to be reck- oned with this 1996 cross-coun- try season in a quadrangular duel- meet at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York this past Sat- urday. Despite losing to the Uni- versity of Rochester, the male har- riers defeated Hamilton for the first time in duel. meet competition since 1988 by the score of21 to 3 7 and resolutely defeated Hartwick 15 to 48. The victory over Hamilton was only the sixth time Union has beaten Hamilton in a \duel meet\ in 40 years!!! The men ran 8000m (5 miles) over the varied terrain. on Hamilton's home course with vet- eran Union runners le~ding the way and with an up and coming freshman cracking the top seven posistions for Union. In continu- mg with the recent Union tradi- tion of standout sophomores, Pe- ter Flynn led the way with an im- pressive perfonnance finishing in 6th place in 27:06. Flynn's perfor- mance was all the mor:e impressive considering he has been unable to train with the team for the past two weeks due to a knee injury and has been training in the pool. Following Flynn was senior captain Nick Conway who fin- ished in 9th place with a time of 27:30. Conway ran tenaciously after the slow first mile (5:46) to finnly move up into the top 10. Conway's previous personal best on this course was 28:03 during the 1994 season. Following Conway was junior Jay Goldberg, who, despite a lackadaisical middleh'llfofthe race, used a late burst of speed to pass a U. of Rochester runner in the last I OOm and captured 12th place in27:57. .Junior David Kunselman a.p- peared back to his old form, and, despite a stitch in the last mile, finished 14th in28:18. Freshman Kenny Scott was Union's all important 5th man run- ning impressively in his first col- lege5 mile race, finishing in 29:02 for 16th place. Senior Steve McCann and Sophomore Hugh Meyer rounded out the top seven for Union taking 19thand 26th re~ spectively in 29:08 and 30:38. Meyer ran with a cold and should be back in form next week at tfie Williams Invitatiorfal.

Live frorn the Meadowlands, in the swamps ef New Jersey, wil r come a contest for the ages between the New York Giants and the New York Jets. With both of the teams losing ugly this past weekend, they have heldtrue to the preseason predic- tions and can battle forthebrag- gingrigbts to New York City with perfect records. Not only is this a game for. superiority in the largest city in the country, but impor- tantly, it is a battle to see which team will remain pet;fect (ie. fall to 0-4, reserving the early lead for the first pick in the 1997 draft). This is not to .say that the first pick will help either team, but when you follow football in New York, and are just sick of watch- ing the Bi.Jis choke, then this game bringsexcitement. I do not mean theexcitemer1t of seeing seasons in the future with winning records, but rather the plethora of ways that these two teams can mess things up. The Giants came into this sea- son as a young team with limited expectations. They had not sought the big time. free· agents and decided to 1 et thejryoung core of talent mature. During the off- season, General Manager George Young weHt out and resigned DaveBrowntoa4-year, l2mil- lion dollar deal, and protected him by signing the no-name free agent,Dwight Stone, a 300pound backup offensive J.ineman from the Dallas Cowboys, for lOmil- lioh. Brqwn, so far this season, has blazed opponents for 2t()uch- downsand 6 interceptions, while Stone and the rest of his line- mates have been non entities. However, Brown· can not be blamed for all of the pmblems sinceheisdoingmostofhis pass- ing· on either 3rd and :l()ng or when the team is trailing hy a couple of touchdowns. Neither Young, Brown, nor any~ of the players; can take the blame for the play calling. Who does Dan Reevesbelieve he is foolingwhen he runs nmety percent of the time on first or second down?

Yes,itis true that Brown is, according to Reeves:during training camp~ \no Troy Aikman., Yet as inept as he lias shown to be, he is no:t the whole problem.

The Jets decided to Jnake Keyshawn Johtfson, a widereceiverfrom USC, the first pick in the draft. Johnson was a good solid pick and will develop if he can get past his ego.

I was able to catch part of Sat- urdays football game on WRUC · and was quite irn pressed with the job done by Mike Nelson and Frank Rossi commentating in the · booth, and Jamie Drown report- ing down on the field. The half- time interview done with Dutch- man safety Jusan Cambell, and post game interviews with John Visconti and Bobby Champlin were all well done. FOX Sports really blew a great opportunity to gain some more credibility on Saturday night.

Instead of holding a memorial service for Campbell, though, the defens~ gave him a get-well gift as the Dutchmen shut out the Saints. Sophomore end John Visconti contributed 4Y2 sacks and was named the ECAC Defensi.ve Playerofthe Week. JuniorTack- les James Kochan and Jared Sandman also looked strong in the St. Lawrence backfield, con- tribu.ting in a few sacks. Visconti explained, '\We really came out here and wanted to set something , for the other teams that we have to play.\ [n addition to Bobby Champlin's interception return, Union's defensive secondary looked good. Free safety Len Mortimore was in on numerous tackles and fumbles. In total, Union's defense forced four turp- overs, including two intercep- tions, versus St. Lawrence's three turnovers. A Look Ahead to WPI The biggest question Union might have right now about next week is whether they can stay fo- . cused on WPI and not look ahead to tougher teams on their sched- ule. WPI is currently 1-1 after los- ing to Worcester State by the score o f21-0 last weekend. This will be Upion 's first road game, and the Dutchmen will.have to look sharp again if they want to move up in the polls. Division Ill Football Poll L Mount Union (OH) ( 1-0) 2.

Fighting Dutchmen Leave Saints Seeing Stars by Frank Rossi StajJWt·iter The rumors concerning the de- mise of Dutchmen Football have been grossly exaggerated. Just ask the St. Lawrence Saints, but you might want to wait until the Saints fully recover from the flash- backs they are having after los- ing to Union42-0. ra tioA Saturday, the running gam~ looked equally good. Shur<m Morton had 15 carries for 92yards and a touchdown, and Justin Bourque rushed seven times for 40 yards and a t01.1chdown. Keith Crumb, coming off of an injury from last season, joined the mix wi·th 31 yards on eight carries. The only disappointments on the offensive end have to include the possible season-ending injury to tight end Erik Edson. Aft:er scor- ing the first touchdown, Edson possibly tore hisACL as the first quarter expired. With tight end Maurice Sterling out for poss(bly another three weeks, sophol'nore Brian Cudmore will see a lot more playing time. Backup quarterback Todd Ellis looked a bit overzeal- ous, but most people tee! that El.lis (;all get the jOb done ifrvkKcown ::,hould get mjurcd.

With only 7:03 gone in the first quarter, it was evident .that Union would successfully avenge last year's only regular-season blemish against St. Lawrence.

Union's Defense Alive:and Well To add insult to injury, with the ball at the St. Lawr~nce five-yard line, McKeown handed the ball off to senior receiver Peter Buscemi. Buscemi took the halfback option and passed the ball into the end zone. Who was the receiver') Quarterback Tom McKeown caught his second touchdown in two years, extending the lead to 28-0. Senior Justin Bourque added a 13.yard rushing touch- down ten minutes before half- time, making the halftime score Union 35, St. Lawrence 0 At halftime, Head Coach John Au- dio said, \1 think the kids came .out of the gate real well. We want to get out here in the sec- ond half to get the running game established and play a little bit better run defense.\ The sec<Jnd halfbroughtjust what Coach Audino wanted for Union as they held St. Lawrence to I 86 yards all day. Senior running back Shuron Morton also chipped in with a touchdown in the second half as he ran two yards int0 the end zone late in the third quarter. With Roger Egbert converting all six of his extra points, the final score was 42-0. As Union knows, those flashbacks will not disappear over- night. . Offense Gets a Bo()st For the first time in over a·sea- son, the offense clearly played at or above the level of the defense. McKeown completed 8 of his 11 passes for 149 yards, throwing two touchdowns and· no interceptions. Quarterbacks m-e given efficiency ratings based on their success in passing (a score of I 00 is consid- ered very good). McKeown gar- nered a :superb ratii1g of246.5. Out of his seven starts for Union, McKeown's strongest perfor- mance was seen Saturday, putting him on the ECAC Offensive Honor Roll. The. receiving unit, which has been referred to as (relatively) the weakest area of the offense with <Jnly one returning starter, looked crisp. Besides passing for a touchdown, Buscemi caught three pas' ~s for67 yards, and the team's \newest\ receiver, Ryan Smith, caught five passes for 54 yards and a touchdown.

Sicotte Staff writer On a rain soaked field last Fri- day, the Union College Women's Soccer team faced off against Wil- limn Smith College, the second ranked team in the country. Throughout the game the rain continued its incessant drizzle, causing the playing conditions to progressively worsen as the game went on. The first half was a defensive battle. Each team mounted mag- nificent scoring opportunities oAly to be thwarted by the other team's defense. As the game pro- gressed, the action and the play- ers desire intensified.

Representatives front the Sigma Chi fraternity paint local bridge (photo by Maria Guillle/TC) Schenectady Benefits from Student Efforts by Anj,.lS Balasingham Staff Writer The town of Schenectady is getting a new look, thanks to the members of the Wells theme house. On Saturday, September 21, residents ofWells House con- tinued in their tradition of service to the city of Schenectady, and painted the Edison A venue Bridge. The project is part of the Schenectady 2000 project to aes- thetically restructure the city. Wells House is one of the six theme houses on campus. Wells, Union's community service theme house, has been around for three years. Formerly an office building, Wells was converted into a living area for those inter- ested in doing service on a regu- lar basis. The painting of the Edison Avenue Bridge is only one of the many projects undertaken by Wells throughout the year. Almost every weekend, nine or ten residents volunteer their time to participate in a service project. As partoftheZollerOne-on-One Program, .Wells visits students each week at Zoller Elementary School. \It's basically a chance for us to spend some quality time with [the students], many of [whom] are underpr:ivileged,\ says Mike Ferguson of Wells. Wells is also in charge of the Meals on Wheels program in Schenectady, and the English as a Second Language (ESL) Pro- gram at the Schenectady Library. These projects are done continu- ously on a year-to-year basis Perhaps the most unique fea- ture of Wells is that its residents choose to live there in order to serve the community better. \Most fraternities require com- munity service, for certain amounts oftime per year,\ says Mike. But Wells residents do it because they want to, which makes Wells individual in that respect. Theme housing in general is getting more attention at Union, according to Mike. \Theme hottses used to be pretty obscure on campus; they didn't really contilzued on page 3 Carnpus News ..................................... 2 WorldNews .............................................

Camp~s News : . · . . . · 'illlp~ <llon.corhicnsis • Septetpber 26, 199 .. ()• Page 4 I Union Takes Pepsi Challenge by Brandon D. 'Declet Staff Writer As of Fall 1996, the PepsiCo company which makesthenum- ber two soft drink in the countcy will now have the excl1:1sive right to serve and dispense its products at Union. Steve Pearse, director of Dining Services, said that the switch was primarily due to ser- vice issues. According to Pearse, «it was a battle to get stuff to hap- pen, there were machinery prob- lems, and management was a problem.\ Apparently, for the past six months Union tried repeatedly to get the Coca-Cola company to ad- equately serve the campus. There were issues dealing with quality control as well as Coca-Co'ia's ability to fix and resolve equip- ment problems due to the Val idine system on campus. When it had become apparent that the Coca-Cola company was do- ing a poor job, Union College asked both companies for pmpos- als. As a result, the PepsiCo com- pany not only made a proposal that was less expensive, but in tact it offered better service. What does this all mean to students on campus? The old Coca-Cola products that we have grown accustomed to will no longer be available at any of the dining halls on cam- pus. Secondly, all the Coke ma- chines on campus that were sum- marilyremoved from cq.mpus will soon be replaced by brand-new Pepsi machines. The complaints about missing machines in many of the residence halls on campus is currently being resolved by the PepsiCo company. According to Art Veino, the representative for PepsiCo in Al- bany, \All soda machines should be installed by the end of the week.\ Unfortunately, for many students the issue of Coke vs. Pepsi does not stop there. In fact, many students have privately ex- pressed their discontent over the fact that the student body was left without a voice or a choice in this matter. Steve Pearse voiced con- cern over these feelings but said that he had· made a decision that he thought was right for the stu- dents. Though Coca-Cola has long been a staple on campus for many years, the new monopoly won't completely be without choice. The new contract with the PepsiCo company was contingent on the fact that both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo products would be available in the Campus Center convieniencestore. Therefore, all students who have been craving the occasional Nestea or Powerade should be able to quench their thirsts. The Coca- Cola company could not be reached for comment. CELA: An Alternative Party Scene by Nalini Gupt~ Staffe Writer No jell ow shots, no hard liquor and no beer. Just an alternative D..l. Jam Night that sto()d up to Friday night fraternity parties with faulty music systems and violence among the ranks. With a live disc jockey in the balccny, a sleek dance floor that wasn't covered with muck and pop mu- sic that vibrated through Old ChapeL the CELA party drew in a total of 127 students in its first event of the year. 'Waking Up the Sleeping Gi- unt. Its About Time' is the motto udopted by CELA, the CirCLllo Estudiantil Latino Americanc. It has earned a substantial follow· ing of 48 students with a budget of 7,000 dollars this year. The group has launched an aggressive agenda of breaking throtJgh Union's apathy towards Latino culture by initiating several activi- ties within its recent existence. \We are working to fulfill ·our goals and to work cooperatively with other cultural organ izati 011s on campus to fulfill those goals. We've achieved so much already that students just aren 'taware of, \ said CELA President Elissa Gonzalez. CELA has worked toward making Latin American Studies a full major, a goal which will be achieved by wintertenn this year. It sponsored a band-picnic in Hamilton Hill to establish Union's first I ink with Scheiiectady's Latin population through the Latin Coalition. The group also actively participates in the Hispanic Outreach Program involving mentoring and commu- Jlity service. \President Hu.JI, Dan Lundquist, Dean Lettiz and the Latin American Studies depart- ment all donated money for us to put up a tent and provide fQod and drinks at the picnic. It was a great success and our effort was really appreciated by Union and Schenectady community mem- bers alike,\ said Secretary Roberto Rodriguez. CELA has sponsored a Union _ student's trip to Guatemala and is working closely with Admis- sions to increase minority recruit- ment. This October it will co- sponsor the Parents' Weekend Multicultural Dinner and send buses to New York City to pro- vide trat1sport for parents to at- te!1d the event.

However, The Concorc!iensis is worried that the administration has gone too far The nation's minimum wage has increased, but Union felt a responsibility to oppress their students and to keep them at their same salaries. Rather than subsidizing the increase of wages, Financial Aid cut back the number of hours students may work per. week from ten to eight and a half. Is the school skimping so much that they cannot give each student $250 more per year? Just think for am in ute about how much they save by hiring students for these cheap rates rather than hiring employees from outside of the college community. Union is taking advantage of its students, or atl'east the ones who were able to get their promised work-study jobs. Work-study is not the only area of campus that is being cheated. What about music students? Three college center practice rooms were all they had, and now they are down to two. All of Union's · musically inclined students are going to be fighting for practice time in two thirds of the space. An even greater burden fell on the poor woman whose office is one of the former practice rooms. Can you imagine having to work while students do repetitious wann ups? Sure, the rewards coine later when the music students play, but even then it is dismptive. What if she gets a phone call? Here is a real ringer for students to ponder. With our school moving~~a~intothe20thcentury,and~chn~~fucifitieslike.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ the Olin Center in our future, why on earth are our computers from the Stone Age. With all the money they saved by not buying real computers, you'd think they could spring for free laser prints. For a very expensive private college, Union's reliance on Dot Matrix printers is quite puzzling. Yes, toners are expensive, but laser prints are still only 2-5 cents per page. Dot Matrix printers are slow, and their quai ity is insufficient for any finished work Come on, Union. Let's splurge. We are one of the few schools left on the planet with Dot Matrix printers. Quick quiz, administrators: which students need your help most, the kids with the·k own printers who aren't eligible for work-study, or the kids who have to use the (sluggish) computers in labs, and have to use their federally SLlbsidized work-study paychecks to pay for their laser prints. When the time comes to pinch pennies, why would you make cutbacks in the areas where Jess privileged students are benefiting the most? <QTq.e Olonrornirnsis The Student Newspaper of Union College Since 1877 Schenectady's Oldest Newspaper Adrian MacLean, Anthony C.

We did well in high school. We are all conscientious here. We attend class regularly, prioritize our lives accordingly, and feed on the knowledge which will one day make us successful. We are told that we will be the movers and shakers of the twenty- first century. After spending a little over a year at this college, I have one question--\How can a bunch of smart kids be so stupid?\ The women of this college ate killing themselves and we ail stand by and watch. We see the clothing get looser than it was when it was purchased. We see the scale drop. We hear the calo- rie counts. We watch the hollow faces in the mirror. We feel their bony skeletons when we hug them. Yet it still continues, get- ting worse as the days go by. Everyone is guilty. Adminis- tration is fully aware of the pro b-.. I em. However, where is the sup- port group on campus? While the higher powers at Union Coliege have speakers on date-rape, the Holocaust, and the media, they ignore the issue that plagues al- most 1mlf of the student body. If an eating disorder case appears, willingly and right ln their faces, they will push the probL~m offto .. the support group in the Capital District. They push these girls out of this campus as outsiders, as embarassments. They ignorethe problem on this ca1npus, and it grows. It flourishes. · When I say that everyone is guilty, l really mean that there is a circle, almost as there is in poli- tics, that leads to a never-ending problem. Let's look at the fol- lowing scenario. A girl is starv- ing herself. A friend notices and goes to a social worker at Union. He or she asks a few questions and responds with, \Legally there is nothing we can do unless it is directly affecting herlife and her relationship with this cam- pus.\ It stops right there. The friend feels as though she's done all she can do, the social worker knows that he or she followed the law, and the girl continues to starve. Everyone reading this knows that eating disorders are a major problem on this campus. Either we ~ave seen eurselves caught up in the struggle at one point i1;1 ~ur lives, or we have seen someone close to us suffer sflently. We walk through the college center to see the hollow faces, to hug the skeletons, at1d to watch the calo- rie-counting with the abuse of various condhnents on non·fat foods. It is impossible to deny that .eating disorders are plaguing Union College. Anyone who · doesn'tthink so should consider the pandemonium that would oc- cur if, suddenly, the frozen yogurt in the college center was no longer fat-free. The women on this campus need help. They need our support, but for some odd rea- son, they are not getting it. I am pleading with this campus to end the problem. Something must be done. No longer should we sit back and watch. There have been rumors of a support group, yet for whatever reasons, it remains to be seen. Until the group surfaces, I am putting the onus on the individuals of this campus. It comes down to you to change the pressure on this cam- pus from encouraging the thin \ and emaciated to encouraging the healthy and happy. It's in your hands for now, whether you are a student or a professor, a m'ale or a female. Until the administration here , .decides to admit that the problem at Union requires much more than an occasional referral to the Capi- talDistrict•s:group, it's up to you to do whatever you can to help. Hopefully, by the time this cam- pus has an actual outlet to solv- ing this silent problem, the starv- ing and bingeing women will still be able to benefit. Hopefully, it won't be too late.

In September, the CF A will be in- viting aU existing student freethought groups to joiri the Al- liance. We encourage studentsat schools where ther~ is no such group to organize. The student founders of CF A ' have declared thatthe need for an umbrella freethought organiza- tion was born out of concern for the rise ofnon~rationalthought in our communities and campuses.

Their Declaration ofNecessity asserts that \Our task is to actively defend am;! fight fQr the rational principles and ideals we hold so dear and to demon- strate, by argument and pra<;tice~ that it is possible to lead a good and meaningful life without reli- gion. Ethics and morality can be based on rational and humanistic ideals and values.\ Their first national meeting will be held in Amherst, New York on Novem- ber 1, 1996.

This event was paid for by Stu- dent Activities and strongly backed by Dean Alford as a so- cial alternative to the \same old scene.\ Did it work? In my opin- ion, no. This event just goes to show how hypocritical the Ad- ministration can be. When they want something, they get it. Any rules that may get in the way are broke.n. What occHrred was haz- ing, and the school got away with it. ldo notknowwhy I write this, is it to argue for Greek rights or bash The Man? Whichever it is, I strongly urge that this situation not be brushed under the carpet. Being a member of a Greek Or~ _ganization, my brothers and I are constantly faced with the threat of being kicked off campus and losing our charter because ofhaz- ing. I must make it clear that nei- ther myself, nor my fraternity, advocates hazing. It must be un- derstood what hazing actually is, however. If we were to do the same exact thing that was done this past weekend, our worst fears would become a reality. We would be no more. This type of occurrence has happened twice in recent history, and pmbably will happen again~ The school must not engage in activities which are deemed horrible and against the law when practiced by one party, and considered \fun\ when prac- ticed by another. This is a double standard that no one can afford to live with. Respectfully, Robert Cohen, Class of 1997 Financial Aid Office Explains Why Minimum Wage Increase Won't Benefit Union Students Letter to the Editor: As Director of Financial Aid I am writing to clarify any misun- derstandings students may have concerning the Federal College Work-Study Program and the imminent minimum wage increase. Currently Work-Study students are paid the minimum wage of . $4~25/hr. As of October 1, these students will be paid at the new minimum wage of$4 75/hr. Our Work~Study job opportunities are capped at $1200 per stu- dent The benefits of the wage hike for students are obvious. Stu- dents will now be able to earn their $1200 working about eight and a half hours per week vs. the erstwhile IO hours per week. The minimum wage increase does not affect the total amount of funds available to spend in the Federal Work-Study Program. It is therefore not possible for students to continue to work 10 hours per week and receive an hourly increase. Funding levels simply will not allow it. It is also worth noting that Work-Study job opportunities are not awarded in a vc,lcuum. If we were to increase the work-study cap to $1425 to allow for 10 hours weekly, then we would be forced to reduce another element of the student's aid package by $225. We would also have to reduce the number of students in the program to stay within the funding limits. We believe our decision to retain the $1200 cap and to maintain the number of jobs available was in the best interest of our stu- . dents. Sincerely, MichaelS.

Gladly would I do this if only I' could; but, you se:e, I am not Rush Limbaugh. I do not always speak up, and, unfortunately, r. don't believe that I'm the oniy one with this problem. '· If you identify with this state- ment, perhaps you will agree that one's lack of confidence to speak up occurs most likely because one feats his argument will be feeble ~nd inadequate in the face ofh is opponent's. This has been the case with me. My parents are Republicans, so dur- ing the first election that I Fe- member, I' proudly wore a Bush/ Quayle buttotl eve11 though 1 did not knowexa.ctly what it stood for. Being only one oftwostu- dents for Bush in my 5th grade class, I S<JOI1 found that when it came to learning about politics in schpol, 1 would be forever outmnnbered by Democrats, a majority which almost always included the teacher. Thus, 1 rarely voiced an opinion. I feared that voicing my opinion was useless when it came to challenging that of the m~jor­ ity. 1 fell into the tragic role of class wallflower, even though tl1e topic of our country's wel- fare was so important to me. I now realize that had I not b~en so reluctant to articqlate my views, perhaps others would ~ave followed my lead . \Essentially we young Repub- licans can blame only ourselves when it seems like the rest of the world is drowning in bleed- il'lg lib'eralism. Furthennore, we catmot afford to stand back dur- ing the election season. So many new voters out there do ll()t realize what constitutes the true thought of the Republican party. So many .are exposed .only t<> the I iberal bias .of the media, H<Jllywood, and, yes, though they are so dear and v a! l)able, those professors who cannot help but share their po- litical philosophies in class. 1 'II agree that it is harder for a young person to be conserva- tive. Young people, because we care, easily grasp issues like the environment, education, and S()cial programs. Since the Democrats boast their sympa- thy towards all these issues, tlaturally we believe that they truly care, and we len dour votes to them without real1y taking a good look at the Republican view. Perhaps you sensed this coming: This article is a good place to remeet the Republican party. First and foremost, the Re- publican party bel iev.es less government is better govern- ment. While this statement might seem elementary to you, I think that there are too many people out there who hear this idea and believe that tlle Repub- 1 icans want to let society crumble into one big game of every-man~ for-hiinsel fthrough the abolishment of all social prQgrams and all those suppos~ edly detrimental agricultural and industrial deregul ations. The truth of the matter is that the federal governrnent could never be too small to lose con- trol ofthe country. TheRe- publicans simply want to trans- fer some centralized power to state and local governments. This is like giving power to the little guys- the people. The Democrats, a party that flaunts its adoration of the common man, favor a contrail ing, cen- tralized government It sounds rather more 1 ike oppression to me. Another broad aspect of the nature of the Republica'!l party is their conservative economic policies - in a nutshell, save rather than spend. BecatJse Re- publicans believe that tl1e wel- fare system is a crutch that cripples more than it heals, they are labelled as cruel and insen- sitive to the problems facing the lower classes. Because Repub~ licans do not hold it to be true that national health care would be beneficial for America, they are again labelled cruel, insen- sitive, and unaware of the plights of the poor. Tile same result comes with the issue of funding for education. Repub- 1 icans get accused of being harsh because they believe the real source of the problem of America's below-average school systems is not money that schools lack, but what our children's homes lack -stabil- ity, function and love. Basi- cally, Republicans are vilified for believing that money is not the source of true happiness. Money, I'll admit, sure does help. The Republicans certainly understand this. They certainly do not think that money would not improve our schools or that health care and all aid to the poor should be completely re- nioved from civilization. Their motives for not spendi11g exces- sively stem from the fact that Republicans are quite good at seeing the big picture. I heard on the radio recently that White House economists released pre- dictions to the effect that if President Clinton were to have his way in funding all the so- cial programs his heart desires, our generation would hav.e to pay 85% of our income to the government That is cruelty. So, when your class is dis- cussing politics, and someone raises the issue of health care, or maybe they rave about a fed- eral mandate that you feel im- poses on your constitutional rights, what are you going to do? Please speak up. Don't assume the majority has all the answers. Y o.u may find their answers are not what you are looking for. At this point, may I suggest that you look deeper and consider the ideas of the Republican party and Bob Dole for President It is a party of common sense with the welfare of all Americans and theircoun- try at its core.

Many his- torians. feel that this was an injus- tice since Meitner and Hahn were calleagues. Mark Walker, an As- soc.iate Professor of History at Union College; co~authored \A Nobel 'Tale ofWartime Injustice,\ which-appeared in the August 1, 1996 issue of Nature. Using newly released information (the Nobel prize committee has a 50 year.de- lay for releasing its records), Pro- fessor Walker eta/. examined the personalities al'ld politics which surrounded this 1945 decision. Meitnerdecided to stay. Her right to teach at the University of Ber- lin was revokedbecauseshe was \1 00% non-Aryan.\ Later, Hahn basically threw ber out of the in- stitute in orderto remain eligible for honors, directorships, and other nice bonuses. He contin- ued to rely on Meitner's insights, which he received through p,rivate letters. It was through these cmre- spondences that Meitner de- duced the infonnation that later won the Nobel prize fo.r Otto Hahn. Hahn infonned Meitner that he had found barium after bombarding uranium with neu- trons, but he believed that the ura- nium plus neutron system \[couldn't] actually burst apart into Ba.\ Meitner and her col- league Frisch, using Bohr's ver- In 1878, Meitner was born in Vienna,AustriaasaJew, butlater became a Protestant.

Their work lasted for 25 years, during which time they demonstrated theexist- enceofuranium-235. Mostofthe credit for the discovery goes to Meitner. that the nucleus could be split and v.iould release 200 million electron volts in the process.

Science & Technology Union College Professor Examines 1944 Nobel Prize by Michael Greebaum Science Editor The 1945 Nobel prize commit- tee overlooked Lise Meitner and awarded a Nobel prize in chemis- try to Otto Hahn for the discov- ery of nuclear fission. Many his- torians feel that this was an injus- tice since Meitner and Hahn were colleagues. Mark Walker, an As- sociate Professor of History at Union College, co-authored \A Nobel TaleofWartime Injustice,\ which appeared in the August I, 1996 issue ofNature. Using newly released information (the Nobel prize committee has a 50 year de- lay for releasing its records), Pro- fessor Walker eta/. examined the personalities and politics which surrounded this 1945 decision. Meitnerdecided to stay. Her right to teach at the University ofBer- li n was revoked because she was \100% non-Aryan.\ Later, Hahn basically threw her out of the in- stitute in order to remain eligible for honors, directorships, and other nice bonuses. He contin- l:led to rely on Meitner's insights, which he received through private letters. It was through these corre- spondences that Meitner de- duced the information that later won the Nohel prize for Otto Hahn Hahn informed Meitner that he had found barium after bombarding uranium with neu- trons, but he believed that the ura- nium plus neutron system \[couldn't] actually burst apart into Ba\ Meitner and her col- league Frisch, using Bohr's ver- In 1878, Meitnerwas born in Vienna, Austria as a Jew, but later became a Protestant From child- hood she had a curiosity for sci- ence and mathematics, and a pas- sion for music \Vhich she pursued throughout I ife.

Bette Midler .. Dan Hedaya. Sarah Jessica Parker. Bronson Pinchot, Marcia Gay Harden. Philip Bosco. Elizabeth Berkeley. Di- rected by Hugh Wilson. Rated PG-13. Paramount Pic- tures. Ratlng: ** 1/2 (out offour) The next in the series of men- did-us-wrong female-buddy pic- tures, The First Wives· Club is just as light and bubbly as its the- atrical trailers would have you be- lieve, creating an unsurprising but pleasant trip to the movie theater. Directed by Wilson, whose pre- vious credits inclt1de bringing the Police Academy series to audi- ences, this Club is a trio of Middlebury College grads from the '60s who have stumbled into similar mid-life crises: their hus- bands have left tl1em for younger women, and now, drained of sup- port and feeling like their best yeats were wasted, these :women form a \reunion\ in Manhat~an and decide not to get mad, but to get even. Their inspiration for this is the recent passingoftheir close friend (a cameo by Stockard Cham1ing). who also lost her hus- band and. feeling alon~, killed her- ! self ln the beginning, Keaton's is the only marriage that seems to be working out, as she and her husband are seeing the same therapist (played by Harden). It turns out that Keaton's husband was seeing the therapist a little more seriously; and left to her own devices, Keaton consults her friends: Hawn, a B-grade Holly- wood actress with an inflated ego and an ex-husband who jump- started her career and now wants her assets; and, Midler, whose ex- husband (Hedaya, always a great supporting player) is making mil- lions in his business and has cho- sen to pursue a young, stereotypically dumb blonde (Parlcer). Getting drunk, the women fonn their \First Wives' Club\ and at- te!npt to dig up some dirt on their men, in the name of justice. To accomplish this, they resort to breaking and enteFing, kidnap- ping~ and a few slick business deals. Based on Ofivia GoJdsmith 's novel,. with the screenplay by Robert Harling, The First Wives' Club-is. witty and hip. Every man inthefilm isreducedtoa~uiver­ ing wimp, and the women they. chose over the leading ladies are soulless, giving the feeling of \they- got-what's-coming-to- them\ by the finale for every char- actQr but the ,threesome. Only at the very end does MidJ~:s char- acter b~gin t9 show a hint of changing her tune, and audiences will have to judge for themselves whether her actions destroyed everything accomplished tip un- til then. The main problem with The First Wives' Club is the uncer- tainty of its tone. it is difficult to tackle issues such as suicide and then.cutto the next scene, where all is happy and bright. Likewise, oncethe story I ine gets to the part where the women exact their re- venge, one begins to wonder if the filmmakers intended a more madcap romp than this. While the laughs are plenty, itis the dialogue that is the b'rost .ef>fective,Jather than the tired scenes of people trying to escape the house they just broke into· when the owner returns home early.

B·ut, thankful,ly to,Harling'sad- aptation of the book and the I ik- ability .qf th~ act~esses, the plot moves along briskly. Without of- . fend,ing, the, story weaves in such topics as iesbianism, ttnderage sex, and alcoholism into its com- ' . edy. Ha;wn, K,eaton, al')d Midler work off each other well. The ac- tresses, in fact, report in interviews that they .loved working on this movie. The .film's best moments {and fortunately, they are plenti- ful) are the rapid~fire conversa- tions between the players. In one scene, Midler and Hawn argue o-verHawn'salcohol problem, re,. suiting a particularly 'humorous battle of one-liners. In another, the trio visits a gay bar to find Keaton's daughter. This.·scene would become wearisome, but it is short and contains only a few good lines- nothing terribly of- fensive.

The set consisted of four chairs and one rolling table. The friendly \clownish\ atmQ- sphere was established upon en- trance to the theater with clown musicand the actors themselves, who were wearing face paint and had colorfully bright hooped cos- tumes. As soon as the show started, the women began to establish their characters; which by the end of the night were just as distinc• tive as their costumes. Their per- sonalities resembled that of The Three Stooges: a leader. who re- sorted to kicks and slaps to get her point across~ a joker, who en- joyed mischief with the audience; and, a more innocent clown who was more a mixture of the other two clowns. The show was by no means \another night at the theater,\ because these women included audience members in their act throughout the night. The first subject from the audience was a womafi in the front row, who was lucky enough to enjoy pizza and a cocktail with the three clowns. Then three men were invited to dance with the three performers, and at their own expense, each was somehow incorporated into THE LITHOGRAPHIC PRINT A SELECTION OF WORKS FROM ATELIER.A FLEUR DE PIERRE -Diana Quinby, Curator Sept. 9, 1996- Nov. 1, 1996 -Artist's slide fecture: Thurs.

The women spared no one and showed no shame in stepping over the audience to get to the back of the theater, or to ch..ase one another. The night was rough for the a1,1dience, but everyone reaped the rewards, when the clowns threw streamers all over the stage and into the audience. Ca11dy was even passed outand thrown throughoutthe audience, and ev· 'eryone was encouraged to make noise with complimentary noise makers. This was not a typical clown act, as the women were not afraid to explore and humanize adult is- sues, which they portrayed with a women's perspective. \It was a very interesting women's perspective on clown· ing, not something you see every day,\ senior Emilia Teasdale said.

Got Beef? • Write for Features! Call x6155 for more details The Bases: Rules & ·Definitions For Collegiate Players by Rawson Thurber Staff Writer Baseball is our nation's pas- time. Th&t is of course if you dis- count basketball and football, but other than those two sports, and possibly hockey, baseball is with- out question America's number one sporting event. Therefore it comes as no surprise that tlie youth ofthis mighty union would adapt such a pure sport into a metaphor for measuring the suc- cess of a sexual encounter. What am I speaking of'? \The Bases\ faithful reader. ·'The Bases\. We all remember the analogy. When we were in junior high schooL one could impart vital in- formation to one's eager col- leagues without actually speaking directly ofthe physical anatomy, by simpley ~tsing the bases of a diamond. Thus the method was born, and for decades after Abner Doubleday's beautiful sport has been written about on bathroom walls and giggled about at sleep- overs in ways, I'm sure Mr. Doubleday had never imagined possible. So then. were does that leave we collegins? Well the baseball metaphor worked well in junior high: 1st base: kissing, 2nd base: up the shirt, 3rd base: down the pants, and well, home has always been home. Though this worked exceeding well in oLir earli-er years, this analogy has become tired as we've grown. So in an attempt to aid in holding on to some fond memories of our younger days, I have revamped the old \rounding the bases\ metaphor. What I lay before you is, Baseball: The College Rules. First things first. When we used to play baseball (and mind you that I include softball in the base~ ball family) we were playing on sixty foot bases, but now we are playing on ninety foot bases. It is now much farther to first base, thus the pa:y-offmust be greater; kissing is no longer an adequate result for sprinting ninety feet. Secondly the fences, God bless 'em, have moved way in, and thus a whole heck of a lot more horne runs are being hit in college. So obvimtsl:y \the bases\ must be changed to fit accordingly with our new found ability to hit the long~ball. So without further ad.ieu, here are the new rules: The General Bases: 1st Base: Once a kiss was suffi~ cient for a single, but no longer. In college a base hit is a general \hook-up\, which entails: kissing, touching, hold, and some fonn of gropmg. 2nd Base: Now~a-days hitting a double isn't as (pardon the pun) hard as it used to be. Your stan- dard collegiate double consists of some semblance of nakedness; as The Qffice of Annual Giving & Alumni Pro- grams is lookingjorqua!ifted; energetic, and dedi- cated student callers to raise crutialjunds for the .

The high-flying Dutchwomen. won both of their matches again:st Elmiraand Russell Sage in a con- vincing fashion. In the first match against the tough Elmira College Soaring Eagles, the team orches- trated a comeback victory after being down 0-2 after the first two games. The Dutchwomen came back to win the final three games to claim one of the most improb- able victories of the tournament. \They increased the intensity level during the comeback,\ said the Coach Leslie Bogucki. In the second match, Coach Bogucki used anumberoffresh- men and substitutes on the way to a win over the R~tssell Sage ()ators. Bogucki hinted that the Dutch women's 2-0 record in the tournament tells that the team's success comes from their ability to cooperate as a strong unit. The strong work ethic led to the come- back victory over Elmira, in which the players focused on better blocks and concentration on the ball and had more beneficial serves.

However, Hobartjumped to a quick 7-0 lead over Union last seas011 in one of Union's few come-from-behind wins in the last few seasons.

Voters Happy, Audino Nervous As Union Beats WPI ~y Fran I< Rossi Staff Writer Warning: A void the Fighting Dutchmen this week after their practice sessions. They will prob- ably be in a bad mood, and Coach John Audino may want it that way afterreceiving a slight scare Sat- urday in Union's 24-1 0 victory against the WPI Engineers. It was not a case of WPI play- ing well, but more a case of Union shooting themselves in the foot. Union's first drive started weN with a 16-yard pass from quarter- back Tom McKeown to receiver Ryan Smith. However, the next plays brought 25 yards in penal- ties to the Dutchmen, quickly forc- ing a kick by Union's punter, Judson Zachar. WPI failed to achieve a first down and was forced to punt during their first drive. Sophomore defensive end John McCarthy was able to block WPI's punt, and Union started their next possession at the WPI I 3. This led to a 23-yard field goal by senior kicker Roger Egbert, and it gave Union an~arly 3-0 lead. Union's defense was able to hold WPI at bay while the Dutch- men offense remained unproduc- tive through mostnhhe first half Senior defensive end Denton Randol-pl:J sacked WPI's quarter- backs five times, making WPJ's startegy of switching quarter- backs look useless. RandoJph confidently added, \It doesn't matter what they throw at us. I think we adjusted well tothet.n.\ With six minutes remaining in the first half, however, the score was tied 3-3. That is when senior line- baokerMario Maltese made a div- Slmrtm Morton bnsts (/~ronglr tl1e WPJ line. (plroto by Aaro,n Braunstein I TC) ing interception at WPI's 16-yard line. Two plays later, senior tail back Shuron Morton pounded the ball into the endzone from one yard out to give Union a I 0-3 half- time lead. The second half belonged to M<>rton. During Union's second drive .of the half, Morton rushed tbr54ofhiscareer-high 155 yards (averaging 6.2 yards per carry). Ten mi.nutes into the second half, Morton again pounded the ball in from the twa-yard lineto move the score to 17-3. ForMorton,his 155 yards mark his first serious moves .out of the shadows of Chris Irv- ing and K<>jo Attah, the men who held the rushing spotlight during Morton's s-tay at Union. Morton ad1nitted, ''We were a little flat in the tirst half, and we came out in the second half with a little excite- ment and knew what we had to do.\ Tom McKeown added a pass~ ing touchdo:wn ear~y in the fourth quarter when he fovnd Ryan Smith in the endz.one for a 20-yard touchdown, making the score 24- 3. Still without an intercepted 'I pass, McKeown leads all Upstate New York Division In quarter- backs with an efficiency rating of 162.6. McKeowncoropleted 12of his 22 passes for 134 yards a,nd one touchdown. Union ga¥.e up their first touchdown of the sea- son with fifty seconds remaining as both teams put in their second and third.teams, bringing the final score to 24-10. Audino Could BeHappler Coach John Audino immedi- ately preached mQre seriousness in practice sessions to his play- ers during his post\game speech. Audino had been cautiously op- timistic before the game, but he realized that for the Dutchmen to defeat the Engineer-s for a twelfth- straight year, they needed to stay focused. Audino said after the game, «WPI played a great game, esp.ecially in the first half. We missed a couple of defensive as- si:gnments. Our quarterback didn't play as g.ood a game as he could have, but he got the job done when he had to.\ Audino was not all frowns, however. \The kids did a good job. You can never be disappointed witha win.\ That seems to be the logic of th<i! p.oUsters this week The Dutchmen, who upp:ed theit record to 2-0, moved up fom spots nationally to move to 13 t place in the Division lii Football Poll. Unfortunately, many teams jn the east region comprise thetop 25, so Union may not necessarily fare as well in a regional poll.

This past weekend Union was matched up against Hobart In the first half both teams came out rather flat with the hal I remain- ing in the m idtield most of the time Numerous saves by Jeff Thomas allowed the Dutchmen to remain at a 0-0 tie after the first forty-five minutes of play The heginning of the second half got very physical as yellow cards were handed out to players on each team With about sixteen minutes to play, the game got very exciting. With this much time left the Dutchmen were scored upon on a fluke goal The ball was said to have passed the goal] ine by a referee who was completely out ofthe play This not only made the score of the game 1-0, but gave the l-Iobart team confidence After this goal the Dutchmen be- gan to dominate.

Prior\to the thrilling victory over Hobart, Union dropped a game by the score of 1-0 to Upstate Co II e- giate Athletic Association rival Hamilton on September 18th. The scoretothis.grunewas 1.0. A1nain factor contributing to this tough loss was that Hamilton's field was made of turf, and the Union team has not hap much experience on turf There was some good play by freshman Dave Martin and sophomore Ellman in the midfeild. Even so, this loss to Hamilton did not seem to damage the moral of Union men's soccer. The team's first win ofthe year against MIT in the Union Invita- tional Tournament In overtime, the Dutchmen were able to play their way to victory, scoring two goals to break a 3-3 tie and win the game 5-3. Freshman Mike Cook had two goals and was named Rookie ofthe week. There second game was against Geneseo and Union was not as fortunate. The final score was 3- 0 There were still many positive things shown by some of the younger players on the team. Craig EHman played very tena- ciously in the midfield, beating most to the ball, Geoffry Sipperly had many good opportunities but the tides were not in our favor. F,reshman goalie JeffThomas has started offthe season impress-ing all, playing the game as if he has had years of experience at the col- lege level. The return by Ibrahim Adamu has added much speed and aggressiveness to Union's offense. The games played against MIT and Geneseo were a part of the Union Invitational. Union was able to make it to the final game and came in second overall. The future ofthe Union's men soccer team seems to be very bright. With many young players and some leadership from the vet- erans there should be no reason why the Dutchmen can't have a winning season. Sophomore Ibrahim Adamusays, we will win the NCAA division three tourna• ment in two years. The majority of the union soccer team is made up of freshman and sophomores so the team can only get better in the years to come. Captains Eric Kujawski, Ted Doran, and Geoff · contillued on page 19

It was not a case of WPI play- ing well. hut more a case of Union shooting themselves in the foot Union's first drive started well with a 16-yard pass from quarter- hack Tom McKeown to receiver Ryan Smith However. the next plays brought 25 yards in penal- ties to the Dutchmen. quickly forc- ing a kick by Union's punter, Judson Zachar WPI failed to achieve a first down and was forced to punt during their first drive Sophomore defensive end John McCarthy was able to block WPI's punt, and Union started their next possession at the WPI 13 This led to a 23-yard field goal by senior kicker Roger Egbert, and it gave Union an~arly 3-0 lead.

Two plays later, senior tailback Shuron Morton pounded the ball into the endzone from one yard out to give Union a 10-3 half- time lead. The second half belonged to Morton. During Union's second drive of the half, Morton rushed for 54 ofhis career-high 155 yards (averaging 6.2 yards per carry). Ten minutes into the second half, Morton again pounded the ball in from the two-yard I ine to move the score to 17-3. For Morton, his 155 yards mark his first serious moves out of the shadows of Chris Irv- ing and Kojo Attah, the men who held the rushing spotlight during Morton's stay at Union. Morton admitted, \We were a little flat in the first half, and we came out in the second half with a little excite- ment and knew what we had to do.\ Tom McKeown added a pass- ing touchdown early in the fourth quarter when he found Ryan Smith in the endzone for a 20-yard touchdown, making the score 24- 3. Still without an intercepted pass, McKeown leads all Upstate New York Division III quarter- backs with an efficiency rating of 162.6. McKeown completed 12 of his 22 passes for 134 yards and one touchdown. Union gave up their first touchdown of the sea- son with fifty seconds remaining as both teams put in their second and third teams, bringing the final score to 24-1 0. Audino Could Be Happier Coach John Audino immedi- ately preached more seriousness in practice sessions to his play- ers during his post-game speech. Audino had been cautiously op- timistic before the game, but he realized that for the Dutchmen to defeat the Engineers for a twelfth- straight year, they needed to stay focused. Audino said after the game, \WPI played a great game, especially in the first half We missed a couple of defensive as- signments. Our quarterback didn't p!ay as good a game as he could have, but he got the job done when he had to.\ Audino was not all frowns, however. \The kids did a good job. You can never be disappointed with a win.\ That seems to be the logic of the pollsters this week.

Unfortunately, many teams in the east region comprise the top 25, so Union may not necessarily fare as well in a regional poll. Numerous Standouts, As Usual As mentioned earlier, Denton Randolph put together a team- high five sacks and nine tackles Saturday, giving him a spot on the ECAC Upstate New York honor roll. Randolph was also named UCAA Co-Defensive Player of the Week. Shuron Morton's 25 car- ries for !55 yards gained him the UCAA Co-Offensive Playerofthe Week. Receiver Peter Buscemi came one yard short of a touch- down in the first half, but he did catch three passes for 39 yards. Besides receiving his second touchdown of the season, Ryan Smith caught five passes for 64 yards. Both receivers crossed the 100-yard mark Saturday. Justin Bourque compliment Shuron Morton's 155 yards with 40 yards of his own. Bourque changed his jersey number prior to Saturday's game from 42 to 6 after having a dream in which he played well wearing #6. The following day, he learned his teammate, #6 Keith Crumb, lefttheteam,and Bourque requested the change. On the defensive side, the Dutchmen gave up only 62 passing yards. Sophomore end John Visconti backed up his 4Y:z sacks from last week with another 1 Y:z sacks on Saturday.
