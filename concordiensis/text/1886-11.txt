Through it the Merri1nac passes on its way to the sea, shaded ~n sumn1er by the \Vooded · hills, and in autumn reflecting the ruby glovv of the_ grand. old trees. In this pleasant old New England town, was born in 1 8o8, the poet, Whittier, with whose ballads we are all familiar~ The poet's early ho1ne wa'i at East Haverhill, in an an1ple old. farm house, de- scribed in his poem entitled \Snow Bound.'' He was sent to school when quite a boy. He had few book:; of poetry, but nature was to .him a continual poem; the blue sky of sumn1er, the changing splendors of fall, and the white shroud of winter, all had their charms for him. He was but a mere lad .when he began to express his feelings in . verse. One day h~ ventured to send a poem to a paper called the Free Press. The editor vvas ·about to throvv the manuscript aside, . but concluded to read it; and disco_vered in the lines, signs of a true poet. 1\he poem was published. Other poem-., frorn the same source found their way into the office. and were so favorably· received by th~ editor that he made inquiries of the postman whence they came. He thought to pay the young poet a visit aud to encourage sq promising a writer. Arriving at Haver hill, he found him at work_on his father's farm. He acknowl- edged the authorship of the poe1n, and ·from that time on began to send regular contribu. tions, enco.uraged by the kind words and re-:- rnuneration of the editor.·

The dome had been finished and the. com- pletion of the interior was indefinitely post- . poned, when a· lady of New York, having visited the building, gave fifteen thousand dollars towards completing the interior.

The building is eighty-four feet in diameter and fifty in height to the top of the wall; the · dome, which is of iron, rises one hundred and twenty feet above the floor.

An attempt was made to use the Memo- rial Hall as a library building, but on account of the shape of the structure, it was found to be impos.sible; the heat in winter rising to the dome, leaving the building proper, cold and uncomfortable. The library was then ren1oved to the.

T he ca~d catalogue, when .completed, :Vill cons 1st of an author, tltle _anrl su hject entry for each book under one alphabet and will answer the following questions: I st. Has the library such a book by a cer- tain author? 2nd. What books bv a certain author has \' it? 3rd. Has it a book with a given title? 4th. What books has it on a given subject? At present only the first two questions can be answered by it, but by means of using other library printed catalogues the ren1ain- ing two can be answered in, a ma:1ner that will be hereafter explained. . The catalogue, Pooles Index to Periodical Literature with supplen1ents to date, list of best reference ! books on any subject, alphabetical list of n1agazines covered by Poole and the volumes of eacl~_ that the library contains, and other aids to readers are placed together near the entrance and their intelligent use will double the value of the library to anyone consulting it. In the upper left hand corner of each card in the catalogue the number of the book which it represents is to be placed so that the exact shelf location of the book is given at once. Thus by the use of these indexes, references on any subject can be found in:- Ist. Any separate book. . (' ·~ 2d. Any chapter 1n collected works. 3d. Any rnagazine article. 'To e.xplain more in detail, the manner of finding these in references will be the obJect of the next issue· and any questions concern- ing it will be gladly answered. THE SHELF ARRANGEMENT. I n arranging the books on the shelves, the absolute loccttion by shelf arid book num- ber is wholly abandoned. The class number. serves as the location number. Accotnpany- ing the class n~mber is the book nun1ber which prevents confusion of different books . on the same subject. Thus the first geometry catalogued is marked 5. I 3 at the top of ·the book and ·r at the bottorn and so on ·to any extent. The books o1' each section are all . . . together, and arranged by book numbers, and' these.sections are also arranged in sim- ple numerical order throughout the ·library. By this plan every specialist has his own special library and all books on any given subject are found standing together, e. g., all the books on Logic will be found under· 160 with the correlative subjects as tnetaphysics, . r ethics, &c., surrounding them. The Society Libraries will be kept separate, as required by the conditions of their loan, but will be arranged in like n1anner. The work of arranging them is being carried on as rapidly as possibre arid they· will be ready for circulation in a short titne. AN INDIGNITY .. 8 . ome student looking up ··Hatnlet and Richard III,\ which is the essay subject for the Senior class, has· cocnmitted a despis- able act. which is hard to be credited to a Col- lege man and esp-ecially to a Senior~ The most valuable references to this subject in the library were in the West1nitzster Revie'lv,. 4 I : 1-37 and Blackwooc:ts~Magazirze.63: I92-I97· These have been tortz oztt bodil.J' thus spoiling a valuable set of the above serials and also depriving all other n1en of the equal·right of reference. These volumes can not be re- placed without great expense and trouble, zj at all, and .it is difficult to imagine how anyone, calling hitnself.a stu:dent and a gen- tleman, could descend·. to s·o mean and cow- ardly an act.

E DITOR LIBRARY NOTES: Why is it that, . ·. having a library that equals that of Wil- liams in nun1bers and far excels it in excel- Ien·ce of selection and arrangement, and eclipses Rutgers, Hamilton, Rochester, Hobart, Syracuse. and many others in both · of the above particulars, ·we are allowed to draw no books frotn it? To be sure if only extracts. and points are to be, taken it would be easier to take them in the library where the excellent arrangement of cross references is at- hand, but in many other cases and espe- cially if the books are to be carefully read through for either instruction or pleasure,how much easier it is if the books are already at · hand. A very few of the men who would · avail themselves of the. opportunity of draw- ing books if such were offered, now go to the library to spend hours alone in reading. I have only opened this subject and hope to hear from others through your columns on this subject. Also why could not the students establish a reading room association as has been done , previously? A roorn could be easily obtained, and a sn1all tax upon each metnber would provide an abundance of reading matter. This scheme would not only provide a quiet place to read but would be of great convenience to students rooming down town who, especially during the winter term remain on the hill and inflict themselves upon some of their friends in their rooms. If such a room were pro- vided it would be a pleasant place of resort between recitations for \polling.\ Let some enterprising mortal work up this scheme and make hirnself irnmortal at Union College. STUDENT. UNION CoLLEGE, Nov. 8, I 886. E DITOR LIBRARY NOTES: Under the Library Notes in last number of Concordlensz's opinions and suggestions were desired. liav- ing occasion to use the library .a good deal it seems to me that n1any improvements might be made in regard to convenience_ to readers. Under the present system, the students are required to do all of their reading at the library and are not allowed to draw books, but little reading will be done unless some arrangen1ents are made, whereby it will be convenient for them to do so. If one wishes to consult any of_the books at the shelves he

is obliged to stand while reading thetn, or at ~east this would he the case if many were there at a time. If chairs could be placed · near the shelves and possibly small desks for books to be placed upon while reading, it . would be a great itnprovernent and would in- duce rnany to read more than they do .now. If a reading room co-uld be fitted up in con- · nection \Vith the library it seems to me there are rnany who would take a regular course of reading and arrangernents could be n1ade for thern to hold a book until finished. It is cer- tain that tnany more would avail thetnselves of the library if steps were taken to make it n1ore convenient for them and it is te be hoped that something will be done in this d . . * * .1rect1on. In this connection it should be said that Prof. Truax has, courteously allowed the students to use a portion of his rooms. when- ever such use has not conflicted with the regular work of the English Department, and that the matter of provi.ding a suitable reading room is under the consideration of the Library Committee. Paper for notes, etc , can be obtained at the L-ibrary and anvone wishing to take a regular course of re~ding can gain n1any advantages by stating the fact to the librarian.-[Ed ] Book Reviews. TI-IE REFRAC 1 ION AND AccoMMODA- TION OF THE EYE. . E. Landolt, M. D. 'Translated by C. M. Culver, M. A., M. D., forn1erly clinical assistant to the author. Edinburgh: Young J. Pentland. Philadel- phia: J.. B. Lippincott Co. This is a work which is destined to become a classic in ophthalmological literature. Dr. Landolt has no pet theories to advocate, and in this book he puts into our hands simply a well-digested resume of all that is best known of the subjects under consideration. * * . * * * Dr. Landolt is conservative in his tnethods,; and tnany of his ideas in respect to treatment will be criticized by some American practi- tioners, at least. He tells us, for instanc·e, that glasses should not be given unless ren- dered necessary by the subjective· sympto·ms~ of the patient; that atropia is rarely found necessary in his hands for the determination of astigmatism. He also speaks encourag- ingly of methods for the cure of strabismus without resort to surgical measures. The vvork, on the ·whole is a .valuable con- tribution to the literature of our profession, and is one of the many indications that med,.. icine is now nearly approaching a scientific basis. The translator has done his work 'Vvell. and has succ·eeded in producing a medical book in idiomatic English. On taking up a well- known medical book-a translation-. -one is astounded to find that the~ ophthalmoscope \vas discovered. Such blemishes cannot be found in the work under consideration It is ~orthy of remark that this English edition is not a mere translation of the French, but that n1uch has been prepared by the author specially for this edition. The paper, typography~ chro~o-litho­ graphs, engravings, and freedom from typo 4 graphical errors, are models for the book- maker. Both Dr. Landolt and Dr. Culver are to be congratulated as well upon the subject-matter ·or the book as upon its beau-· tiful appearance.-Albany Medical Annals. THE SEPARATE SYSTEM OF SEWERAGE ..

The prosperity. of any college depends not so much upon its . faculty or students but in the support it re- · ceives from its alumni, and it is safe to pre- · diet of any n1an who has no college pride or loyalty when in college, that he will take no interest in his Alrna Mater after he has gotten out. ~If there is one consideration which should be more potent than any other . in tending to awaken this college pride and enthusiasm an1ong the students, it is the fact that so many men have gone out frotn the institution. whose advantages we are now en- joying, and have held and are now holding positions of honor and trust in all depart ... tnen ts of life.

In none of the many cases, in which the Presi-. dent of the U: nited State~ has shown his good sense, has he shown better judgrnen t than whtn he declined a .LL.D. from Harvard. A new phase has been added, of late, to the question. At the Harvard 2 50th anniver- sary, LL. D.'s and D.D.'s etc., were liherally dealt out to ·representatives of CoUeges, gov- . ernrnents, professions el al / but in the dis- tribution no representative of PrincetQn Col- lege drow a prize; whereat, the Reverend President of that institution packed up his satchel and returned to . his own, refusing utterly to sit at meat with those who had so signally slighted his co-laborers at Princeton. Fron1 this it would seetn that the con- ferring of an honorary degree is a matter of etiquette. Why not do away with the mat- . ter altogether ?
