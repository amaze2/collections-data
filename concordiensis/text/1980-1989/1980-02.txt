He emm phasized that the rapist can be anyone, and that he is looking for the opportunity to commit his crime. \ February 7, 1980 Volume 109, Number 13 • The Union College Women's Network _ sponsored a brunch last Sunday which dealt with Night Safety and Rape Prevention. Sgt. Chris Chad- wick of Security spoke tc;J a crowd of 70 about precautions one shoUld take to prevent the rape situation .. Suggestions included locking room doors when sleeping and when in the shower. Students off campus should leave a light or television on when aut during the evening. People on ground floors should pull down their shades at night, as a rapist would be looking for a victim alone in her room or apartment. Cars should be parked in lit areas, and when approaching the car, one should have her. key ready and check the back seat before getting in. It was stressed that women should not walk alone on campus, and when walking to be aware of possible places to run for help. Students should be aware that after midnight, security is stationed in the maintenance building, not in the security office. The phone number is the same-370-6173- and · Security will give rides from a place of study to a student's residence. Although Sgt. Chadw.ick admitted that all these measures may be slight in.- conveniences, he stated that none are as inconvenient as rape itself. Sunday, February 10, the Rape Crisis Center will speak in Strauss Lounge about rape and its effects. The talk begins at 2 p.m.-all ·students are welcome, and women are especially; urged to attend. Professors Schwartz and Nichols chaired the Middle States .Review Seminars on Admissions and Govern a nee, resp~di ve I y. Middle Staf.es Review College Evaluation Examined Sgt. Chadwick was 'quite informative and spoke openly of the recent incidents on campus, by MARK VALENTINE, BOB BYRNES, STU BOBER, and PAM RYAN On Monday and Tuesday of this week; representatives from the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools inet with members of the college faculty and staff responsible for the Self-8tudy of Union College Report. This report, serving as the basis for all discussion is composed of seven separate reports on Admissions and the Recruiting of Students, Governance, Curricular · Affairs, Programs Beyond the Union Speeds TAP Aid by MACK SPERLING In a move affecting over half of Union's students, the Finance Office has quietly changed the means in which the college receives Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) funds from the state. lZOO of Union's approximately 2,000 students receive the TAP funds, which are awa1·ded to New York State residents based on financial need and academic , ability. Under the new \advance- payment\ plan, the college receives 75 percent of each term's $250,000 in state aid at the beginning of each trimester. This approximate $180,000 is immediately divided among TAP students' accounts, with the remaining 25 percent credited upon reception. The previous system, known as the ''lump sum\ method, allowed the college to receive an individual check in full for each student, but involved more state red tape, .and often took months before any money was actually sent to Union. Under that plan, in fact, Union did not receive TAP funds for the Spring term of 1979 until November of that year. Under the prepayment plan, the school would have gotten 75 percent of those funds in April, at the beginning of the term. Union's comptroller, Dave Deacon, said those students affected most adversely by the former system were those who had a credit balance with the addition of the TAP monies. Although permitted to register, money needed for living ex- penses was often not received for months. Beatrice Collins, spokeswoman for the state's Higher Education Department, which administers the TAP grants, said, \the advantages of pre-payment far ... utweigh those of lump sum,\ but college of- ficials' attitude is one of guarded \optimism.\ The Vice-President for Finance and Administration, John Hauser, said in a Tuesday interview that \ time has not passed sufficiently to make a judgment\ on the new program, but said it had made the billing process easier on the students. Hauser also said since partial TAP funds were now being received a half year or more earlier than previously, they could be invested sooner than before, adding to college revenues. Union's Finance Office made the move to the new plan last spring, and it was implemented at the beginning of the 1979·1980 academic year. In doing so, Union joined 423 of the state's 535 colleges and universities who receive aid under the ad- vance method. Traditional Four Undergraduate Years, General Campus Maintenance, the Energy Situation, and Student Life. Each report was compiled by a committee of Union faculty with the purpose of taking a close look at the problems that exist in each of these areas of the college and to offer solutions. The purpose of the meeting was to allow the Association visitors to ask questions that had occurred to them as they read through the report . Admissions The first point covered in the Admissions seminar was the issue of students' and guidance counselors' use of mean SAT scores as a way to compare Union to other schools. It had been proposed to either not require applicants to send SAT scores or to give them the option of sendi_ng them in. Bowdoin was cited as a school which had successfully done this and it's reputation had not been tainted by its action. It was pointed out that by having only a fraction of the freshman class report their scores, the mean average would invariably rise. Also questioned by the Middle States people was the quality of the Students at Union enrolled in Union College's evening school. The faculty admitted that screening for the evening school was not as thorough as that for full-time students. . Along with that statement the faculty also noted that many professors enjoy teaching evening courses because the evening students were more dedicated and enthusiastic than many under-grads were. Finally, in reference to the dwindling numbers of college age students, the commission warned the school not to sacrifice quality in its efforts to squeeze through the 1980's. Governance In the second seminar, representatives from the Commission met with members of Union faculty to discuss the College's new governance system. Professors Nichols and Ketcham and Ken Plumb, the Student Body President handled all que.stions posed by the comm1ss1on. s·asically what was asked was reasons for this change [rom one form of government to another. One of the primary reasons for altering the scheme of govern- ment for the college is to eliminate the possibility of a president using the present form of government as an ex- cuse for his inaction. He could conceivably claim that he had responsibility without authority. This was indeed the situation when President Bonner was forced out of office: Also cited as a reason for the transformation was the inept- ness of the AU-College Senate. It was felt that such an inept body should not have its decisions made binding as they are under the old form of government. Athletics The principle area of concern at the seminar on athletics was the facilities available at Union College for recreational, in- tramural and intercollegiate activities. Not only are the present facilities seriously overburdened, but in many instances poor maintenance is leading to further deterioration of even our best facilities. For example, because of the poor shape of our outdoor athletic fields, both the track and baseball teams are unable to play their home games on campus. With regan~ to our indoor facilities, thert are again very serious probler: s evident . Alumni Gym is no doubt the poorest athletic iacility on campus. The locker facilities :tre incredibly dirty, and in- sufficient. The indoor swim- ming pool meets none of the standards established by the NCAA regarding size or design. The basketball court contains many dead spots, loose boards, and raised screws which make its value more than questionable. Finally, the handball-racquetball court is neither regulation in size or design and since it is the only court of itS kind on campus, it is hard to find· it open for use. The addition of the Memorial Field House in 1955 alleviated many problems but the design of the building limits it to few activities. The only bright spot presently is Achilles Rink, Continued on page .4 __

Editorial Awarene,ss You've invited a friend from home to visit you for the weekend and she is followed. onto the campus by a stranger who verbally harasses other students in order to find her whereabouts. A girl leaves the Pub by herself at night and is approached by a stranger requesting a match. Unsuspecting, she reaches for one and is physically attacked by the stranger. Fortunately, she manages to escape and return to the pub for an escort. While these incidents are very different in respect to their severity, they are very similar in one i..rnportant aspect; they both occurred here on the Union College campus. Are you surprised? lf so, you are only one of the numerous students who were unaware and thus vulnerable. The ignorance of the students, tor the most part, is due to the desire of the administration and security officers to avoid a panic situation. What these \concerned\ persons seemed to overlook was the fact that an uninformed student body is also an unprepared student body. If we are not told about the dangers, we cannot take precautions to avoid them. The obvious intent of security officers to obscure the facts was made clear when, despite various inquiries by this paper and other students, no information. was divulged. The question then arises: Was their desire to keep the incidents to themselves based on our security or on the maintenance of their reputations? Thanks to Sgt. Chadwick and the Women's Network, approximately 70 students were told about the incidents described above and other potentially dangerous situations that may arise on or around our campus. The .rest of the student body unfortunately is still lulled by the false sense of security provided them by the gates surrounding the campus and the low crime rate of the surrounding area. It is still a shame that most of the rest of the security officers and some ad~ ministrators find it their position to reinforce this false security. The truth is that our campus is not secure, and probably won't be until the students begin requesting that the departments of security and maintenance here on campus be upgraded properly. The deficiencies in these areas only contribute to the plans of those potentially dangerous people in this world. Furthermore, it must be noted that the student body is also a contributor to the existing problem. The relatively small attendance at the Sunday br1Ulch seems to exemplify the lack of student interest and concern. Does it take a serious incident to wake this campus up? Act now to protect yourselves. An additional problem is the lack of proper lighting on campus, caused by frequent vandalism towards streetlights. This vandalism is in turn due to the laxity of campus security. Broken streetlights, broken windows in dormitories, etc., only make it easier for a criminal to commit his act successfully. Since these incidents occurred, several students have even gone to the extent of wearing masks to frighten other students, thereby making a joke ofthe situation. These incidents do not bring to light a comforting situation, but without student action and the communication of these incidents to the students by those aware, they do not bring light at all. Knee Deep: Byron Nichols University by BRUCE KAPLAN Among the necessary rumors attending the visit of the Middle States evaluating committee was, we felt, a most interesting one. As the story goes, ap- parently at one of the first meetings of the committee, a proposal was entertained concerning a change in the name of the College. Based upon what one committee member termed, \thE preponderance, predominance and passion involved in policy proposals present in the paper Concordieosis,\ a motion. was made, following a logical reasoning process, to change the name of the College to Byron Nichols University. You guessed it! ! An interesting rumor, no doubt, but the truth of it, or the rloubtful nature of it, being a mere pasquinade, is really a moot point. What the rumor underscores is the fact that campus policy, or the tnaking of it. is centralized, whatever the n•ason, in the hands of too few. \Aha.\ you say, \what do you t'xpert\ The apathy of the -,tudents and faculty alike necrssarily leaves policy for- mat ion to the astute few.\ There is only one reasonable answer to that dear question. \Wake up!\ We really must be weak, as the rumored rtiscussion of the committee editors- in-chief news editors features editors arts editors photo editor sports editors layout editors associate editor calendar copy editor subscriptions staff · photo staff business managers explored, to not stand up to any individual or group of faculty or student members, who, by virtue of a power vacuum, might use our college as a testing ground of political theory.

Regarding the editorial, I sincerely question the view that the presence of an $8poo.oo contingency fund represents an \embarrassment\ to the Forum. The primary purpose of this contingency fund is to provide fQr a budgeted surplus in the event that an unexpected loss might occur. Given ap- pro:ximately 45 clubs and Qrganizations that submit budgets (many ~lf them like the social or concert committee which could easily suffer a substantial l<JS& if an event is poorly attended), it is virtually impossible . to predict everyone's anticipated income or expenditures to the dollar.

The point being that by failing to \cQver'' many sides of the problem, the article tended to be extremely narrow in its fQCUS, and thus the vievvs expressed represented only a very small minority. In fact, one item which the article failed to mention was the actual vote on the budget: 13 Yes 2 No and 1 Abstentiono Clearly, the Forum felt that W1der the circumstances, and given the present system, that Mike Brand had done an excellent job. In discussing the second point, it should be noted that numerous efforts have already been made and are still being made, to S<>lve the structural problems of the Tax Com- mittee. Even last year a Sub- Committee on Finance was created in order to try and review the procedures of the allocation of tax: monies. However, this group failed to take into account that the problems of the Tax \\' vu1uu~.~cc and the allocation of student tax monies, in general, are very complex, and involve com- parable changes of the COC and the Forum as well as the Tax Committee·· itself.

Forum I would just like to take a couple of moments to com· ment on both the article, ''Tax Committee Questioned,.\ and the editorial, \Tax Write-Off,\ , which appeared in Coucordy this past week. Regarding the editorial, I sincerely question the view that . the . presence of an $8500;00 contingency fund represents an \embarrassment\ to the Forum. The primary purpose of this contingency fund is to provide for a budgeted surplus in the event that an unexpected loss might occur. Given ap- proximately 45 clubs and organizations that submit budgets (many of them like the social or concert committee which could easily suffer a substantial loss if an event is poorly attended), it is virtually impossible to predict everyone's anticipated income or expenditures to the dollar. I need only to note an instance last year where a particular group lost alm<lst $7000.00 on one event. Fortunately, there was enough excess in last year's ·budget to overcome this loss and deliver a surplus for the year. rt is to Chairman Brand 1 s credit that no such fiasco has happened to date or is on the horizon; and even in the event that something dO'es break down, there is still the con- tingency fund. Thus, budgeting to have a surplus, in the form of a con- tingency fund, is not only good bookkeeping, but common sense as well. After all, one of the primary responsibilities <lf the Tax Committee and ultimately the Forumt is to insure that Student Activities does not overspend its budget and one of the ways to insure that this does not happen is through the presence of a contingency fund. With reference to the article, \Tax Committee Questioned,'' I found: that the ·information that ·was presented, on the whole, to be accurate atld would like reiterate that there are indeed a . number of problems with the . Tax Committee. However, I felt that the article tended to distort the present situation by doing two things: (1) severely .limiting the scope of the article ·by not consulting many .of the other relevant parties involved and (2l only briefly mentioning the fact that substantial efforts .are being made to alleviate , these problems. roncerning the first point, by concentrating on the opinions of only a handful of Forum members. the author failed to consult several other in- dividuals who are, or have been, directly involved in Tax ·Committee procedures. I am speaking about several Forum members who were on the Tax Committee last year, the vice- president whose Committee on Committees is currently in- . volved in changing many of their own procedures in order to change the situation, Forum members who ate on both the COC and the Constitution Committee, and in particular, members of the administration, such as Mrs. Marra, who as coordinator ·of student activities • is intimately involVed with the allocation of the student activity fee. In addition, the author ·failed to attend both Forum meetings (the self-imposed i time limit being used only after the issue had been thoroughly discussed the week before), at which the approval .. of the budget was discussed. The point being that by failing to \cover'' many sides of the problem, the article tended to be extremely narrow in its focus, and thus the views expressed represented · only a very small minority. In fact, one item which the article failed to mention was the actual · vote on the budget: 13 Yes 2 No and 1 Abstention. Clearly, the Forum felt that under the circumstances, and given the present system, that Mike Brand had done an excellent job. In discussing the second point, it should be noted that numerous efforts have already been made and are still being made, to solve the structural. problems of the Tax Com- mittee. Even last year a Sub- Committee on Finance was created in order to try and review the procedures of the allocation of tax monies. However, this group failed to take into account that the problems of the Tax Committee and the allocation .of student tax rnonies, in general, are very complex, and involve com~ parable changes of the COC and the Forum as well as the Tax Committee itself. Concerning the lateness of the budget ap· . proval, an effort was ·made, through the offering of in- centives, to have all the budgets presented by April 27 last spring. However. a substantial number of groups (ironically Concordy was one of the of- fenders) failed to get their budgets in by this deadline, so it was dear that more extensive efforts were needed. Because of the complexity of the issues involved~ the task of re<~rganization was ~ven to the Constitution Committee in the hope that by dealing with the entire picture of College Governance and Student Government together, the committee would be able to come up with the com- prehensive changes needed. In addition, the Dean of Students office has been extremely ac~ tive in proposing suggested changes and at the same Forum meeting when the budget was approved, a tentative timetable for Tax Committee procedures was submitted for Forum consideration. With the debate on College Governance coming to ~ close (I hope) and the report of the Constitution Committee due later this week, the Forum will be able to concentrate on the problems of the Tax Committee and student organizations, in general. Certainly there are problems· with the Tax Cor:runittee and the Forum has never made any effort to hide this fact (A notice which I sent out this past summer placed reorganization. of the Tax Committee high on a list of priorities for the coming year) .. By writing this letter, I am merely expre!)sing my disappointment that the article, tended to ''condemn\ the Forum for its action, yet made v.ery little effort to point out that substantial time and effort has· already been put into the solving of these problems. I . would just like to reassure the student body that the budget for this year is sound and that the . Forum is taking action to see that a system is drawn 11p so that a sound, comprehensive budget will also be produced in the years that follow. Thank you for taking the time to read this response and I apologize for the length but it only stands as an indication of the complexity of the problems involved.

The target of my concern is the Dutch Hollow Pizza Pub. This institution, although not the·best pizza makers, is new, and I have always been in favor of new operations getting on their feet and competing with older. established ones. But newness is no excuse for discourtesy. On Monday. January 28th, I called and ot'dered a pizza from the pub. After a considerable amonnt of playing with my order ( •' Is that one fifty-three Fox? One-Five*Three? Five, preceeqed by a One and followed by a Three?\ etc.) I was tbld that it would arrive at \precisely 11:47 p.m/' I looked ·at my watch as I hung up., and it was exactly ih47, , lenienct~ I would ventt!re to suggest that Union's lenient p()Iicies be changed immedi2tely. First, let us reestablish capitol punish~ ment on camp.us. One good execution and we woUld be rid of these abomiaahle acts. The death penalty may not be a proven deterrent for the general public but. the average pre-law, pre-med, pre->engineer, pre-life is not apt to risk the chair, to break a chair over someone else's head. Second., for minor acts of malevolence let us sentence the offending student to live out his--ner cQllege ca.reer in Troy.Or. in th.e event that the august Conduct Committee shall find a Tr()jan e:~dle to be cruel and unus11al punishment. perhaps we could allow or student vi-olaWI'S to seek asylum m Q)l'u)es.

First of .an, the article gives the impression that Dean Kellett has some sincere in~ terest in seeing the darkroom rebuilt. On the contrary, i and several other users of the darkro(Jm have been after Dean Kellett for well over a year to get the room revamped with new counters, hot aand cold running water, and most im- vortantly, ventilation. In fact, just before Christmas vacation, one of the photographers was assured by Mrs. Marra that the dean would see to it that the darkroom was repaired over vacation. When I returned and found tl'tat the darkroom was untouched by maintenance, I called the Albany o.fftc~ of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and filed a complaint against the school. It strikes me as being rather odd that something that has been tb.e subject of complaint by both Unicm B()ok and Co.JIWrd:y phot()g:raphers for over two years was ignored Wltil the threat of an OSHA inspection and possible legal action was brougl'lt to the school's at- tention, Suddenly, as soon as it was na lnnger practical to avoid the su:bjeet. maintenance and Dean Kellett foUnd both the time. and the money to begin rebuilding. Is there anything that can be done around here without making threats? Is the Dean of Students• !ob merely to appease studen-ts QY telling them what they want t{l hear, and then ignoring the entire situation?

Middle 0 States Review Continued .from .page 1 canstructed in 1975, which serves as the borne for our Union Hockey team and other recreational activities such as skating, youth hockey, curling, and i.ntramur;als. · Another aspect of Union College's athletic program discussed was the women's athletics program and com- pliance with Title IX which states that men and women must be given equal op- portunities to participate in all activities including athletic activities. Union is currently doing what it must to head in this direction, although it was noted that improvements could be made, particularly in areas of better scheduling of contests, increased publicity, and bet1;er playing fields. Currently, there are sizable differences in men's and women's athletics budgets but there would be increases in women's budgets if more op- portunities for competition arose and more generated in- terest in women's athletics. Also diseussed was in.- tercollegiate athletics at Union. No re·commendations were made to drastically change the number or types of sports we now support. League mem- bership has been an · issue debated many times over the years. In the 1950's, Union was a member of the Independent College Athletic Conference (ICAC) but withdrew from that in 1968-1969 to join the New England Small Colleges Athletic Conference · (NE-sCAC). League rules were too restrictive, however, and Union opted for independent status in 1977. This has not caused us many scheduling problems, and with the availability of ECAC and NCAA tournaments, it seeiilS that our current independent status serves us well at this time. The question of divisional status has also arisen in recent years, but this seeinS to have settled down recently. All competitive in- tercollegiate sports at Union are presently in Division IIJ, except for hockey which is Division II. These programs seem to be at their proper competitive level, and no changes are foreseen in the future. Finally, it was re· , commended that a full time Sports Information Director be employed, rather than the present half-time director. Given the increase in the number of programs, and the addition of women's programs, a full time director is needed to cover all the activities, generate the interest in the. media and the public, and provide the services necess~ry for the Sports Information Office to be effective. Curriculum The meeting on· Union's curriculum centered mainly on the direction that the college is taking academically. Professor Linda Gerstein, a member of the Middle States group frofn Haverford, pointed out that Union seemed to be lacking a clear-cut definition of what kind of.academic program it offered~ She said that, in talking to teachers .throughout the school, she found great variance in how they · perceived Union's academic emphasis. While some said it was liberal :arts, otQers said it was pte- professional. The consensus among those at the meeting was that Union College offers a com'Qination of the two, a. strong pre-professional institution with a high emphasis on liberal arts. The Middle States~examiners argued that it was very necessary for the college to define its goals and direction, so that it can effectively work to perfect its curriculum along those lines, and project that emphasis to both the college community and those interested in the school. it\. defined missi<>n and purpose would also help to · prevent some of the problems of the past. Dean Brownlee pointed out that if Union College had previously defined its educational priorities, it could have prevented ~ great deal of controversy several years ago when the merits of the hockey program at Union were heatedly debated. Professor Hartwig spoke <>f the strong pre-professional nature of Union, mentioning the pre-law, pre-med, and engineering students that dominate many majors. Professor Gerstein pointed out that only some 20 percent of Union's graduates go on to law or medical school, but Dean Brownlee emphasized that many other graduates go right into highly trained fields after. leaving Union. All of the Union representatives made clear the fact that a good number of Union students look to the college for some fol'IIl of pre- professional training. Professor Ouellette said \I don't believe students are here to be liberally ·educated.\ The faculty, Pmfessor Hartwig pointed out,. is research-oriented, and this shows in the professional em- phasis in their course readings and syllabuses. The strength of majors at Union was also noted as being out of the ordinary. At the close of the meeting all involved seem to agree that Union College needed to establish a direction. But to do this, it would be necessary to impress that direction on everyone in the college com- munity. Professor Gerstein suggested that this direction come from the top, saying, \The orchestra leader con- ducts; the orchestra plays\. Professor Hartwig replied, \It helps if everyone's playing the .same score\' a reminder that defining. Union's academic direction is a job that will require input from throughout the college. Student Life That report on student life had a deliberately negative tone, focusing on areas that need development. The report highlighted five major areas '\ affecting life at Uni~:~n: the . effect of the increase in student population on the student body, the homogeneity of the student body, the work load, the ratio between independents and fraternity-sorority .plembers; and the lack of a feeling of 'community' at Union. T}Je growth of the ,student body in past years has put a ,str.ain on housing, security, and maintenance, says the report. lt calls for more uniform planning in the future growth of the campus community. The report also says that the homogeneity of the students has bred an atmosphere where minority, rural, and ~ommuting students often feel left out of student life. It suggests that students should try to show a greater willingness to accomodate one another. The work load at Union was found to be difficult, having affects on personal develop· ment. The report showed that the work takes a substantial amount of time, and invites unhealthy competition. In short, it puts an obstacle in the way of a good intellectual atmosphere. Traditionally, Union College has had a great nwnber of fraternities, but over the past several years the amount of students joining a fraternity or soroity has dropped from 50 percent to 25 percent. At the same time, however, the report says that they still form the social nucleus on campus. The social life of students was a major emphasis in the meeting; as the Middle'States and Union representatives asked their student member, senior Lisa Katz, about the Jlllality of student social activities and the lack of ~i good campus spirit at Union. She pointed out that, because of the workload; most students felt that they had to draw 'a firm line between \work\ and \play'\, which tied in directly to some questions about why many activities on campus are alcohol-related. Some at the meeting ex- pressed belief that a major drawback to social life on campus was the lack of a large student center-lounge, to serve as a meeting place on campus. A college center like this would be conducive to bringing large groups of students together. While the report was generally negative in tone, it was emphasized. that student life at Union does have a great many positive aspects. Dean Kellett pointed out that students vary gi:eatly in how much they need social \support systems\ to join the Union community. But the committee members felt that where attention was needed, they should work on the weak points_ of student life at Union. Ma'Jntenance The Maintenance seminar of Tuesday morning centered closely on the text of the College's self-evaluation. This report found that the oroblems · Continued on page 12 Senator Edward Ken· nedy came out with a very forceful speech last week at Georgetown Unive.rsity, one that he is gambling wili give his faltering campaign a second wind. Over the past several months Kennedy· has not been able to give any clear-cut - reasons for running against the President, trying to project a politically moderate stance to cut into Carter's politifa:lly moderate support. But it wasn't working for Kennedy .. . he couldn't pass himself off to conservative and middle~of-'the­ road crowds, and he alienated some of.his traditionally liberal supporters. In his Georgetown spee;;:h, Kei:medy finally outlined his reasons for running for the Presid~ncy, and provided a liberal contrast. to Carter's performance and policies as President. It is believed that Kennedy's 'new old look', coming as it does in\ the aftermath of his humiliating loss t<Y Carter in the Iowa caucus, · will put some new life and enthusiasm into his cam- paign. However, the rejuvenated Kennedy campaign puts a little - fear back . in the Democratic Partv. When Kennedy was runnlng a weak campaign, · drawing no ideological distinctions between himself and Carter, many Democrats felt that the harm done by a primary fight while politically ·damaging, would not be irreparable. But now that Kennedy has come out swinging, the cons ervp.ti ve,. moderate, and liberal wings in the Democratic Party might become polarized, and, should this happen, might invite a Republican u victory in November. They look back to 1968 for a prime example: President Johnson ~and Hubert . Humphrey backed by the party regulars, Robert Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy, the in- surgents, backed by· the more liberal wing . of the party. Humphrey won the nomination, discouraging many of the lihe.ral Kennedy-McCarthy workers into _apathy; Geo~ge Wallace, the conservative Democratic Governor of Alabama, ran on an in- dependant line, and, with the Demofratic vote split, Republican Richard Nixon was able to squeak to victory with less than 50 percent of the vote. Echoes of 1968, of its dissension and disunity; still echo in the ears of many Democratic leaders. Kennedy will put on ~ push in New Hampshire, wher!'l he is running behind Carter in several polls. Since the~e New England states are right on his Massachusetts doorstep, he has said that, to remain in the presidential race, he must win . both the New Hampshj.re primary and the Maine caucus.: Aft-er his speech, you can rest assured that the · Kennedy workers will . make every human effort to pull out a victory. . . . In Maine, Carter 1s countmg heavily on the teachers of that. state. He has received valuable BUDDY HOLLY STORY Feb 8-10 Fri-10 Sat& Sun-9 & ll: 15 pqlitical support from teachers because of his decision to form a separate Cabinet post for a Department of Education, severing it fr.om Health, Education, and Welfare. Teachers are expected to hold caucus meetings in their private homes in communities that usually don't bother to have theQl. Teachers in New Hamp- shire are also big boosters of the Carter campaign. On the Republican side, ·George Bush, the surprise winner in Iawa two weeks ago, is reportedly leading the late- organizing Ronald Reagan in the polls. But Bush was stung last week when twelve Republi-can National Con· vention delegates were selected in Arkansas. · Six went to R,eagan, four went to Tennessee Senator Howard Baker, one w:as uncommitted but leaning. to Baker, and one was for Bush, a lower figure than he had an- ticipat~d~ A rumor has been growing lately, and Bush seems to accept it, that Reagan and Baker :forces in several states have been in collusion lately. Arkansas is pointed tQ as one example, as is Connecticut, where there was a recent $traw poll of party workers. Reagan did not send a surrogate to speak on his behalf, and Baker ran remarkably well over Bush. Many feel that this points toward a 'Stop· Bush' effort by Reagan, who is losing his front- runner status to Bush, and Baker, 1 who is losing his ex- pected support in the moderate Republican wing to Bush. It is felt that they are combining their respective strengths to knock ·the /mQmentum out of Bush'S campaign. The ·other ·candidates are slowly fading from the picture. Jerry Brown is encountering no enthusiastic support in New England, and even finished third in a recent straw poll of· Democratic leaders in California, the state ·that he is governor· of. Senator Robert Dole is reportedly near drop- ping out of the Republican race after a bad defeat in Iowa, right next door to his home state. of Kansas. John Connally's once- bright star keeps fading, but he still may prove to be powerful in the Southern primaries. Most recently, Connally wined and dined Republican leaders jn Arkansas, but didn't r-eceive a single one of their delegates to the convention last week. Republicans Philip Crane and- John Anderson, both Illinois congressmen, are still way back in the PE!Ck. Anderson, in- terestingly e.nough, has siphoned off a lot of Kennedy's liberal support, billing himself as a \progressive Repu.blican alternative\. He also captured a lot of attention and favorable press from the Iowa Republican debates in early January. Anderson's campaign won't be enough to make him a presidential nominee, hut he may be looked at as respectable vice-presidential material. Crane is Anderson's con- servative counterpart.

Faculty members participated by representing their respective departments. Professor Catherine Clinton represented the History Department. Clinton cited changes in going to graduate school. Although there are economic prospects with a Ph. D. there are now retraining programs. \Although graduate school is rewarding, ·are you willing to put in the time and effort right now? You can take off a year and use it wisely.\ Clinton sug~tested taking a job \that will pay off.'' • Clinton feels that it should also· be noted that many com~ panies wjll pay for an education. Such economic realities could encourage education. Professor Anton Warde, member of the Modern Languages Department, discussed myths abolJ.t liberal arts and career choices. The major myth is the concept of a major determining a career.- \Most of the time, it will not,\ said Warde. A student can go to medical school without being a biology major. ,; A dangerous myth is majoring in what someone tells you you ought to major in,\ said Warde. Warde feels a student should seek a full, broad education; the least important line on a transcript is what the student majored in. \What you did and how you did it are most important.\ The job market of tbe 80's and its expanding careers was commented OQ by Professor R].Idy Nydeggar, who represented the Psychology Department. The job market is generally very different now that a few years ago. Students, however. should not try to Maintenance Makes Changes by EDWARD ALBRO In an effort to increase the responsiveness and efficiency of services provided by the Maintenance Department, Director of Operations Jack Hill last week instituted important organizational changes within tAe department. These changes increase the amount of supervision of department personnel, an area found to be severely lacking in the recent self-evaluation prepared in anticipation of this week's Middle States Commission visit. Effective last Thursday, Maintenance established four new foreman positions in the areas of Grounds and Tran• sportation, Heating and Plumbing, Electricity and Controls, and Structures. Previously, the personnel in three of these four areas were under the direct control of the ~uperintendent of Buildings, a situation that Mr. Hill said was \impossible to propet:}y supervise\. Under the new system, three of the foremen will report tQ the Superin- tendent of Buildings and one to the Sqperintendent of Services. lV1r. Hill stated that the purpose of the change \was to establish responsibilities for the opet·ation of individual sec- · tions\. The changes involve no increase . in personnel, only in titles and responsibilities and Mr. Hill assured that \'in everY' instance in whieh p~omotions are made, we will promote from within, if .qualified people can be found.\ · In an unrelated development,. Mr. Hill announced that the present Superintendent of Buildings, Mr. Jim Harrigan, had resigned the post for·health reasons, but would stay with the department as an electrician. Mr. Hill is presently looking for a replacement, preferably from within the department. second· guess wpat will happen in the job market and economy. ''To prepare yourself, pursue things that are appealing to you,\ suggested Nydeggar. t'I am a big advocate for ·keeping one's options open. Liberal arts teaches you how to think and l.earn.\ Although such uncer- tainty can be\ anxiety provoking, it is· important to take advantage of a broad base. \Live with uncertainty and follow your nose.\ Professor Jim Underwood represented the' Political Science Department. He elaborated on the myths of graduate school. \The exception of the myth is engineering,\ stated Under- wood. \Less than half of the political science majors a few years ago went to law school. You can find surprises with what people are doing.'' Underwood's prim~ example was journalism. It is ap- propriate for some people regardless of their major. \Certain skills are helpful to almost anything' you are going to do. One is writing, wl)lch will help you think.\ Underwood also cited language as ·an added dimension to any maior; it can have relevance to a career. Professor Torn Werner, membe.r of the Chemistry Department, concentrated on\ the pursuit of gra~vate school. \A college degree now gets you an audition: an interview.\ He continued, \Graduate school ' is still a very good idea. There are still openings for PhD's. If you are a good student who picked the rig.ht area, graduate school is the thing to do.\ Werner focused on graduate study for the 80's. He sees pollutant study, alcohol related disorders, cardio-vascular disease, computers and ar- tificial intelligence, more ef- ficient health care service and energy supplies and con- servation as good areas to study in. \Also a fact of life is that the military industrial complex will be expanding,'' he added. Werner stressed that talking to the faculty should not be neglected. lt is. important to know w~at they thin_k. The discussion was attended by students as well as members of the administration and faculty. A question ~nd answer session followed by refresh· ments concluded the meeting. . . the internationally famous actQrs and producers, and Dr. Thomas H. Dickenson, former professor of drama at the University of Wisconsin. \ The announcement was made by Union President Di~on Ryan Fox, who related \it seemed to us that the ideal opportunity for students of the theater would bring the classroom and the professional stage into jux- taposition.'' President Fox regarded the principle of ·'learning by doing \as achieving its greatest value when pursued under the guidance of skilled and experienced instructors, and with an adequate resources for study and experiment. The development of the theater at Union had reached its. high point during the .years 1935- 41. Mountebanks were still thriving as an autonomous group at this period in Union's History without any program of teaching in the theater (and without a Department of the Arts, for that matter). The theater was located in Hannah Hall, which as the central portion of Washburn Hall (this building was torn down in 1963.) The formation of the Arts Department in 1966 was seen as a cultural revolution of sorts on Union campus. This Depart- ment, under the direction of Professor Edgar Curtis, was _Jormed to combine the talents of music, art and the drama section of the English. William Meriwether, who had been an Instructor in the English Department, became the Instructor for the new Drama section. During this first year there were seven courses taught in Drama, all of which were approved by the English Department. The majority of these rourses were in Dramatic literature the other half were \applied''theater courses. Mt. Meriwether remained at Union until 1968, and dur·ing this period there were several significant developments in regards to the strengthening of the major. A new course in theater workshop was developed and this included sessions in acting, directing, stage de~j.gn, technical production and other areas of the theater. An. important ad- dition to the course description was the requirement that all students would have to worli: on productions. Therefore for the first time an academic program became an 'integral part of a student club. In 1969, Henry Weil took over the drama program rearranging some of the course offerings to accommodate his special knowledge of the history of the theater. The English department now had complete responsibility of teaching dramatic literature. Mr. W eil remained at the college for three years, leaving because· there were no overt plans for the theater after certain promises were made to him. Weil's leaving Union brought to an t!nd what has been termed theater as \lear+ting\ to be replaced by theater . as doing (the same phrase that President Fox had used thirty- five ye_ars before. Almost ten years before Well left the college, the Moun- tebanks were forced out of their Washburn Hall theater into. the Nott Memorial. The move from the proscenium stage to theater in the round caused some ob- vious problems in terms of stage design. No longer could the groups present the kind of elaborate scenic productions which it had in the past. For almost ten years plays were produced without the use of ·moveable sets. This ended when Barry Smith was hired as , director in 1972, anf. Chades Steckler was hired af designer. Theater in Washburn Hall.

. ,, Page 6 OONCORDIIQNSIS) February \1 19~0 France In Retrospect by ANDREA BOWERS \How was your term abroad?\ \Oh great, great .. . \ Such a weak way of . describing a vivid block of time, · yet an easy word to grab when faced with the task of describing fifty different memories. So those people who expect to hear you rave on and on about your particular ex- perience have .a difficult time imagining a period which was once so real. What then happens is that Italy, England, and France all get lumped together into· the category of ''fall terms abroad.\-\Oh him, he's on a term abroad.\ Yet all three programs are so very different and each one has a separate appeal. When I was in France, I couldn't help but·· try to conceive of a term in Italy or England; probably in an attempt to convince myself that I was where I wanted to be but mainly because the entire concept of \the term abroad\ came alive with my first-hand experience. The idea of drinking wine on the Ponte Vecchio appealed to me as did my conception of the Stratford theatre. \How was my term abroad in France?\ \It was different.\ \- My term in France was in French: all contact with France was done in French-a scary reaijzation as I rode on the train from Paris to Hennes knowing that in order to eat breakfast, I had to ask for it-in French. I had to learn about French civilization-in French. I had to attend tours-in French. There is no English to compromise your total French\ experience. And how else can you get that immersion into another culture than in a way which is so basic,.- learn the language. And no, it's not easy to make this transition. In fact, an argument could be made that two and a half months is just not enough time. One will find himself even in the eighth week of the term rehearsing, in the security of his own bedroom, hOW to explain that you've •:got to have some clean clothes.\ But there are definite moments when you don't feel like \the American Student struggling in · France.\ I remember one of my most exciting experiences was to be able to make a French pun. And what was exciting was that it was spontaneous. What begins to happen is, even with ones limited amount of French, one is capable of com- municating so much. I believe that my French mother knows as much about me as some of my closest friends. And laughter is always the same in both language-s. This I discovered when I put a wedge of Camembert cheese inside a tupperware container and remarked to my mother, \Regarde! Le Francais et I' American! · But times will come dw·ing the term when one has to leave Rennes. Though others might deny this, it is possible to get bored. But .if you have the ambition and the curiosity, this state of mind shouldn't last very long. When I suffered from the . \Hennes syndrome\ I took off with three other friends for the 464' State St. we deliver coast of Brittany-Le Point du Raz. And this experience is one that I shall never forget. It wasn't full of jugglers .and fire- eaters like you would see in Paris; it wasn't full of topless bathers like you would see in Nice; and it wasn't full of little men riding bicycles with cigarettes stuck to their lips as in Hennes. It was off-season. There wasn't a soul around. The water was bluer than I'd .ever seen it and the land was rocky and savage~ We walked around the point and heard an old lady with whiskers speaking in the archaic language of Breton. She spoke words that sounded like French but the gutteral emanations from her throat sounded more primitive, more ancient. That night we all slept in :the only motel that was open; one sitting on top of a hill overlooking a beach about a half a mile away. The next day, Sunday, we gQt up .in time to see a fishing town rise and gather at the docks, We sat on the steps of a cathedral and heard the sound of mass inside. We watched a rat tumble down a drain pipe and trot upthe street. Later we returned to Rennes. ; It's har4 to give the right reason to everyone why they should go to France. If nothing else appeals to them, I can give a big reason that has universal appeal: the food. French food is not always elaborate, but that's not why I enjoyed it an~way. The basics are incomparable. One of my biggest pleasures was to drink coffee out of bowls with fresh bread and butter. I am convinced there is no way that anyone can get tired of the French bread-and you'll have it three times a day. (I had it four times becausel made sure to be home by 4:00 for tea arid bread). They sound like such simple pleasures-they were. And if you are fortunate to return home for lunch you can expect a real spread. Steak and frites were never as good as they were in France. For din- ner, usually something simple: crepes or galettes ( a crepe-like pancake made out of buck- wheat) with eggs or gruyere cheese. And then, more -bread and cheese and of course wine and more wine (and then some more wine). Nothing could ever match the weekend feasts. Noon meals, which were usually prepared by- the grandmother at their house in the country, were anticipated · every weekend. Sunday mor· ning my family and t would pile into the car and ride to the coootty to see their parents. At first I felt uneasy because for a few moments everyone was called by -their chil<Ulood pet names and everyone knew_ exactly what to do: peel the onions, cut the bread, rummage through the cabinets and look at the family china. But after my first visit, I was included in the family rituals. My French grandfather, a very quiet, almost steJ.:n gentleman would tell me about the forest of Broceliande~which was situated next to their village. This was the forest in which originated the legend of King Arthur and Merlin the Magician. He wo~d drag out book after J>ook on Brittany and relate every Schenectady 374-1888 legend. One. night he returned home with steaks two inches thick and cook~d them over their fireplace. We ate these steaks with leeks and cider, followed by blue cheese, Camembert and cheese made from the tnilk of a sheep. Some people might describe the F1.1ance term.abroad as low- key. Perhaps this is true but. probably only in comparison to other te-rms abroad. The emphasis on the France term abroad is,on th<rlanguage and on the family. Each student must decide that he or she wants to involve themself with their ft;tmily. But this is not done simply -by speaking French or by learning the history. People can communicate whethel· they share the same language or not. Only when there is human in- teraction can one begin to un- derstand a culture. And when this is achieved, com- munication proceeds on a new level of awareness. Socialized Medicine Lives· by DOUGLAS SPECTOR Which Union College Term Abroad is the only term abroad that is really three terms abroad in one? Answer: The Summer Socialized Medical Term Abroad. I was fortunate enough to ex:perien<;e this. term this past summer and I can honestly say that it was the most rewarding summer I have ever had .. The program of study is one of great relevance in today's society. Although socialized medicine has an obvious appeal to pre-medical students, as a social ·sciences major I can safely say that the topic is equally attractive to students with a variety of other interests. The htunanitarian, political and economic aspects of socialized medicine present a fascinating field of inquiry for people of all majors .. As if the topic itself were not enough to hold your attention, lectures are given by men and women vvho are ex- perts in the field and skilled in presenting arguments both for 1 and against their native systems in-a highly dynamic fashion. A major part of . the learning experience is gained through tours of various facilities during which the inquisitive st!ldent may int~ract · with both patients · and professiona'ts in order to obtain a different perspective. Have I sold you yet? If not read on. The work load of this summer term · is very reasonable and in no way will it interfere with your cultural experience. The program originates in England where three weeks are spent in the heart of London. The second leg is centered in Upsala, Sweden ( (a fifteen minute train ride from Stockholm) but in the interim is ·a ten day break to be used in whatever manner you see fit. After the .Swedish segment terminates there is another break for about a week before you embark towards the high- point of the sUIIlllier, a week of touring and lectures in Poland. Is the system of socialized medicine right or wrong? The ultimate decision is left up to you. Is a decision to ,go on the Socialized Medical Term Abroad a right or wrong decision? This is a very dif- ferent question to Which there is only one answer. You .won't be sorry. · \Stan¥ Creei<Band\ appearing next Thursday. 'in the Dt.~td'l Hollow Pub.

CONOORDIENSIS, Febnwlry 7J 1980 Page 7 Angelo Mazzone: Food Czar or Not? by DANNY WOJNILOWER (Leg work for this article was done by Mark Valentine, Rachel Mandel, and Danny Wojnilower.) Within any discussion of Angelo Michael Mazzone, Director of the Union College Food Service, two disparate sentiments are verbalized. One view, that Mr. Mazzone is an arrogant food czar out to make a fast buck, is in sharp contrast to the other, that Angelo is an overly dedicated individual attempting to produce the best possible food service. A careful · analysis of the entire operation provides support for this latter view. · The key word above is dedication. It is a prerequisite for the job and the word most often employed to describe Mr. Mazzone. Praise of his work has been echoed from the ad- ministration on down to the student. According to Dean of Students~ Robert H. Kellett, \I've worked in five or six' professional places prior to Union and I can honestly say . that I ha:ve never seen an in- dividual so totally committed to giving the students a good food- service;'' Jan Gray, manager of Hale House and Assistant Director .of the Food Service states, \there is nothing he wouldn't do to have our food service be the absolute best. You won't find anyone who would work harder.\ The Student manager of Dutch Hollow Pizza, Michael Bacco, gives a slightly different per- spective. \I didn't know Angelo before this year and had only heard of him as a hard ass. Knowing him now, well, he has so much to deal with. I have nothing bat respect for him.\ Finally, 68 percent of the students interviewed felt that Angelo provides the students with a diverse food service which is greatly improved from the past. · It cannot be denied that many Union students are unhappy with the present food service. ~,reshmen are the most negative but, as Robert Wolper, student manager of the Dutch Hollow Pub, is quick to note, \the negative feelings of most freshmen stem from an inability to compare Union food to anything other than home cooking.\ Upperclassmen are more positive, but, as Bacco points out, \the combination of Angelo not being given a chance and a shade of necessary arrogance on the part of· Mr. Mazzone is bound to cause some problems among 2,000 students:\ Furthermore, among students surveyed, two points of . displeasure arose. First. 34 percent of the students believed 'that- Mr. Mazzone is making a personal profit. ~ >. :t- .' . Second, 56 percent of the students were bothered by the apparent monopolistic nature of the food service. With .regard to personal profits, Dean Kellett made it more than clear that Angelo has a one-year contract at a fixed salary, and that it is a no in- centive program. He further mentioned that the Food Ser- vice was given a budget of $1,300,000 for 1979-80 and that Mr. Mazzone is responsible for staying withinthis budget. \The Food Service is a break-even enterprise,\ states Kellett, \money put lnto the food ser- vice remains within the Food Service.\ As for the second criticism, Angelo's monopolistic power is, in actuality, non-existent. Reporting to the Board of Trustees on all matters, Mr. Mazzone runs his day-to-day operation within parameters set by the college. Union's decision to -internalize the Food Service was made in ·the hope of im- proving the quality of the Food Service, and came about as a direct result of positive feed· back received about the Pub and negative feedback received with respect to SAGA and RSVP 1 the two previous organizations to serve Union). An added bonus of this internalization was to keep the costs down. \RSVP made a profit of $35,000-50,000 last year,\ says Kellett, \and now all profits are redirected back into the Food Service.\ for the lowest possible cost.\ Mr. Mazzone's time com· mitment toward reaching .the above goal is staggering and stems directly from his desire for perfection. He takes the Food Service personally, and this is a major cause of the brusque manner he often presents. A typical week for Angela includes a minimum of sixty hours and often ap- proaches eighty. At age 27, and with a family of four, this is really incredible. According to Richard Williams (Piedmont), Assistant Manager of West College dining hall, \Angelo is forever trying to improve. His ~ philosophy is simple-if you're going to do it, then you might as well do it right. He is a sincere subscriber to the American way. By that I mean he believes that you get back whatever you put into your work. His ultimate goal is for the Food Service to be better at the food business than the English Department is at teaching English.\ Trying to keep track of Angelo is another story. A normal day begins at 7:.00 and includes talking to an assort- ment of students and ad- ministrators, tasting the food at each dining area at least once, and meeting with salesmen (approximately twenty each week) in an effort to obtain better quality products. Even weekends do not connote rest for Angelo Mazzone .. For in- stance, Angelo has been seen working the concessions at Achilles Rink ,on a Saturday night and, on occasion, per- sonally cooking for a special dinner. \To his credit, Angelo is very conscientious, a perfectionist by nature,\ states Piedmont. \If things go wrong he's not afraid to raise hell. He flies into rages worthy of any self-respecting Italian, but always makes a point to apologize.\ Angelo admits, ''I yelr and scream alot, but it is only to get things right. I'm demanding . upon my workers and I don't like' managers who sit down and die. I really want them to differ with me.\ Smiling, Jan Gray con- curs, \we do have real strong disagreements, but as a result we do get two strong views. I'm not a yes person,. and he's not looking for a stamp of ap- proval.\ As to his relationship with the every day student, Angelo confesses that \l've come a long way from my original position to now. I used to be very,· very responsive to students but after becoming accustomed to taking all types of shots, I simply don't react as much.'' This is a major gripe of many students but one must also remember that the position of Director of the Food Service is not only very public but also a no-win situation. Still, the availability of Mr. Mazzone must be increased. Ways to accomplish this have been suggested. and, as a result, Angelo will be eating. with twenty students once a week next fall at West College.iri an effort to bolster his rapport with the student body. It should be noted that Angelo Mazzone is dedicated· to students in other ways. His job depends upon satisfying the student because a failure to,do so would result in the loss. of his ·job. \A college really judges its food service based upon how good its catering is, and although we are good; my main concern really is the every day feeding of the student. The food service is here to serve the students more than it is here to serve a few special dinners for the president,\ states Mr. Mazzone. An example of his desire to help the student is the soon-to ... be expansion of the Hale House dining facilities. Ignoring all opposition to the plan, Angelo pushed it through, feeling it was yet another necessary step toward the total accommodation of the Union student body. Angelo Mazzone is a man always seeking improvement. In his own words, \the Union College Food Service grew out of the Dutch Hollow Pub. Now, we need another year to grow and formulate before we can really become one of the best food services in the Northeast.\ Based upon his unique per-· sonality, this ia a likely oc- currence. And, when this does· occur, it win be a credit to the extreme dedication of Mr. Angelo Mazzone. Originally from Massapequa, New York, Angelo Maz~one arrived at Union in January of 1976 after serving as the dining hall manager at Yale University. With an Associate in Applied Science (Hotel Technology) from Schenectady County Community College in 1974 and a B.S. in Hotel Administration from the University of New Haven in 1976, Mr. Mazzone began his Union career as manager of the Dutch Hollow Pub, which opened in March of 1976. He remained in this capacity until January of 1978 when Acting Dean of Students Rudy V. Nydegger appointed him Acting Director of the Food Service. Mr. Mazzone then proceeded to do a contract study from which he concluded that the students simply were \being had.\ The 1978-79 academic year brought Angelo to Hale House and the Rathskellar, and included the termination ofSAGA~s tenure at Union. This year, Angelo opened the . pizzeria, took control of all vending and concessions, and expanded his auspices to West College where RSVP {last year's service) had proven itself overly expensive and inadequate. Now, as Director of the Union College Food Service, Angelo's philosophy is simply to form \the best -possible food service Looking B~ck At Union byPAULGROSS~N Union is an old college. Actually, Union is older than old,. it is one of the oldest colleges in this country, and in its 185 years Union has seen many changes take place in the world that surrounds it; and has experienced many changes on its own. One of the major changes to take place was reported by CONCORDIENSIS a decade ago this Winter. Union decidedthat it was time to allow the other half of the country - females- to reap the benefits of a Union education. It took Union a . bit longer than many other colleges to realize that there was room on its campus for women to conjribute, both educationally and socially, to the school community. When this realization was finally arrived at, the males of Union were anxious hosts to prospective female .freshmen ( freshwomen?) The following article is reprinted from CON- CORDIENSIS, November, 1969. -~ COLLEGE OPENS DOORS ~ FORDAY ~ T044LOCAL n HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS :: Q) , ~ Union College presented an 0 open mind and the red carpet to 0 44 area girls yesterday in a day• f long conference on coeducation. College administrators had \'im active discussion with the girls for about an hour and a quar- ter\ after they had spent the morning on f1 tour of the campus, a demonstration at the college computer center, visits to regular classes, and an in- formal lunch in Hale House. Sixteen different classes had female visitors, and the girls, all high school seniors, were generally pleased. Candy · 'fournier, from Notre Dame High School in Scenectady, found the language that political scientist Robert Sharlet used was \very high level,\ but, by listening hard, \I think I got the main point and that made me feel as if I'd accomplished something.\ Living arrangements for women received a lot of at- tention at the conference. The gir 1s liked \the mod approach to decor, so we'll probably continue in that vein,\ a college administrator said. The college is renovating lO•year-old Rich- mond House for the first class of Women, entering in September, 1970. Many of the girls were in- terested in the science and engineering fields. The con- ference participants were chosen by guidance counselors at their high schools. The girls mingled easily with the regular luncheon crowd at Hale House. Conferees, regular Union students, and faculty members sat and c-hatted through a leisurely meal in the hall. . The small size and intimacy of Union was a key attractive feature for many of the girls, only five of whom had applied to Union before the conference. \The faculty seems to care more about people,\ said Barbara Herderick, from Mont Pleasant High School in Schenectady. Although the conference was called so that Union could get s9me ideas of what th.:.y have to do for the \big cha. !ge\ next year, it was not a recruiting effort. Administr: .tors did, however, feel that there were \a lot of really sharp girls in this group, girls we'd like to see come to Union\. (Reprinted article by Neil S. Kramer) THIRTY YEARS AGO THIS WEEK: The American Locomotive Company was in the process of relocating their parking lot to make room for the \new\ freshman dormitory, West.

Page 8 OONOORDIENSIS~ F,ebruary· 1:, 1980 ---------------------------- Arts Culture Madness- Stuck In The Wall Long Lines by ROBERT BLAKE . The Wall is Pink Floyd's latest, and one of their most elaborate and complex albums. Oblivious to the rest of the trends of the music scene, Pink Floyd continue to go their own course and maintain their low public ·profiles. They surface every two to three years with a painstakingly well constructed album, and a short tour which abounds with stage effects to present their new material. The Wall is no exception to this trend as it gives us -a double album dose of Pink Floyd's trademark spacey bl11es and Roger Waters' gloom filled lyrics. the album interesting. Compared to the previous work of the Floyd, however, The Wall evidences a stagnation of ideas from the band. It seems as if aU the ideas and elements from the earlier works of the group have all been thrown together here in an attempt to create one giant, definitive opus for the Floyd. The Wall has the choir and orchestra from Atom Heart Mother, it has the endless whispering voices and fate of insanity from The Dark Side of the Moon, it has the crazed rock star protagonist of Wish You Were Here, and it has the allusion of people as. animals from Animals. What the albwn doesn't have is the ex- perimental electronic music segments of their pre-Dark Side of the Moon work as their music has become totally conventional in its style. In fact there are • several short segments here that are exceptionally close to \Echoes\ and \Welcome to the Machine\. What this all adds up to is that the Floyd seem to be trapped in their own wall of ideas. After listening to The Wall I am still asking myself the same question I asked when I finished hearing Wish You Were Here and Animals; where do Pink Floyd take their themes and music from here? At this rate, in two to three years, what will the next Pink Floyd albwn be called; The Brick? Another matter of con- troversy is the thematic paradoxes of the album. Besides putting down Western Society in general, tbey also lash out at their audience ®d at themselv.es. One can only wonder how seriously this is meant to be taken, and if it is meant to be taken seriously, for a band that has recently toured so seldom and has been so successful, just what on Earth is it that has made these guys so bitter? None of this has stopped the album from instantly jwnping to the top of the charts. This raises the question of who ate the people buying tbis album and ar~ they listening to what is being said here? The fact that Pink Floyd can release an album that is exceptionally doom laden and against its audience, yet still be a huge commer·cial success, represents some sort of strange achievement for this band. Ode: To Pl\giatlsm (Composed a few miles above Schenectady on revisiting the banks of Steinmetz of the YMCA during a class,. 1980) That time of year thou mayst in me behold When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hand . Upon those boughs which .shake ~gainst the old, Bare ruined choirs Where late the sweet birds sang. In me thou seest the twilight of such day As after sunset fadeth in. the west; Which by and by black night doth tale away, Death 's second self that seals up all in rest. In me thou seest the glowmg of such fires, That on the ashes. of his youth doth lie, · As the deathbed whereon it must expire, • . Consumed with that which it was nourished. by. This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong, more strong, ·. To love-that well even though gone ere long. -Andrew Tallner • .Special thanks. to Mr. w.a. Jazz. Union Style by BRAD FISHER If you happen to be out in the open air of the Union College campus on a Thursday or Sunday evening you've probably heard the sounds of the UC Jazz Ensem}Jle drifting on the wind. The sounds could be any style from jazz to pop. This is the fourth year the big band sound has been on the Union scene, and this year promises to be the best yet. transfer student musicians (which is 50 percent of the band) and this talent has gone further than just filling in the vacant seats. Broad new sounds are emanating from every section. The combination of experienced players - and talented new personnel make this year's jazz band one not to be missed. The group has again, two piano players this term, but unfortunately no keyboard. Because the budget doesn't There are ten freshman and encompass funds for one, the band will be trying a number of different options to raise the needed money. The most ob- . vious will be that of a small charge for-the concert. This is unprecedented, but if you have ever been to a past concert then you know it's worth it. The Jazz Ensemble is, of course, jUst one of the many extracuricular activities that students can pick from, and the members have made a commitment of time and practice. You will be able to hear the results of their work on Saturday night, March 1st. Don't miss this night of music and fun. Thematically The Wall deals with what, more or less, the last ' three Pink Floyd alb~s have dealt with, the human condition. The Wall is told from the point of view of an individual in modern life., whom, although he is hwnorously referred to as \Mr. Floyd'', could be anyone as he is no more than \just another brick in the wall\. The album traces the growth of the individual from his childhood onward as he develops, or perhaps is sucked into, what is referred to as \the wall\. The Wall alludes to the many facades, spaces, and defenses that separate the individual from the fears and anxieties of life, represented here by \the worms\ and which also keep the individuaiJrom expressing his true feelings. This is something that only the ''crazy bleeding hearts and artists\ try to do. The album progresses to a dreary conclusion as most songs develop other aspects of the wall, represented by forgotten people, distant dreams, and ever .present fears. These other aspects all even- tually catch up with the in· dividual to drive him to in- sanity, and thus \outside the wall\ at the end of the album. SkoiNei.l A Success Judged on its own merits The Wall is a thoroughly excellent, forceful, and artistic album. It is perhaps the best overall lyrical work from the pen of RogerW aters. It is certainly the best singing from the band as the vocals have become totally animated and impassioned. The album has a fine theatrical quality to it. Although the album is all segued together, it is composed of many short songs as opposed to the ex- tended work of previous Floyd iHlbums. Many of these songs ~e beautiful and compelling. Beyond this, the album is filled with many fine little touches. An example of one of these touches is the theme from the last song on the albwn endS where it begins. Furthermore it is the most upbeat Floyd album to date with the abruptly changing pace always keeping by MERKIN This past Thursday proved to be quite entertainirig and was undoubtedly one of the most inscri\bable events of the decade. Third Floor Davidson staged their last first annual Cabaret performance. With the combined efforts of over nine members of the floor they put on a show that would have stopped the Japanese from invading Pearl Harbor (they would have been too confused). Opening the act was a fantastic · perloriilance with the melodic voices of Beth Loose and Dina DiFrancesco accompanied by Debbie Poskanzer on the piano. Beth's rendition of \I Honestly Love You\ was superb (ancf everyone clapped). Next was a performance that people will remember for decades (or at least it will take them decades to forget).

CONCORDIEN818, FebrtUl,ry 71 1980 Page 9 -Madness ulture Aerobic Dance Offered Somewhere in the back of my memory I recall watching Mike Douglas Ia~st tenn when his guest was Jane Fonda, mainly. because a friend had a par- ticular fetish for Jane Fonda's legs. What you ask, does this have to do with aerobic dan- cing? WeU, Jane Fonda had just opened an aer,obtc- dancing school. Both my friend's fetish and my own were satiated by watching this unusual form of \dance\. Jane and a crew of extremely shapely assistants and p\!pils, ·dressed in their finest danskins', undulated and weaved about the floor in the· peculiar motions of the \dan- ce\. Those motions were nothing more than simple exercises. Y, es, aerobic dancing is nothing more than exercising to music. For thirty minutes I sat and watched exercises to disco, classical, and other music with a beat. To be quite- honest, I was more impressed with the danskins than the exercising, and the only memory left was .. of those same danskins moving to the ~eat. It is certainly an excellent way to keep in shape. It en- courages good posture and a healthy diet. And although the members of the current class may not be Jane Fonda, I cart foresee a time. when they will be, ~specially if they continue in aerobic dance. After speaking to several st,udents in the 'class I had a better understanding of what aerobic dancing actually is. The entire session is an hour of cardio-vascular exe·rcise beginning with a slow warm-up, followed by intensive exercise dance, and a slow cool down period. The object is to increase the heart rate, maintain it at least twice the normal rate and then slow it back down. Aerobic dancing is therefore c.onoerned not only. with conditioning and strengthening the external ·. muscles of the body but with conditioning and strengthening the most important muscle of the body - the heart. The dancers are made up of stretching exercises combined with steps from such dances as the polka, the jig, the Charleston, and of course disco. They involve total use of the body and by the end of the term, participants should be able to run between four and eight miles without collapsing. The students seem to enjoy the workout. One said \It makes rne happy. ''Some are in the class to lose weight others to have a break during winter term but all are concerned with physical fitness and recom- mend aerobic dancing as a way to exercise and still have fun. Next terin the class will be offered four times a week for six weeks. If you are interested watch for the sign-up sheet at registration spring term. Quincey Troupe to Perform by ROY JACKSON On February 13 the Black and Latin Alliance of Students will present an evening of poetry and jazz featuring Quincy Troupe; poet, anthologist, editor, and saxaphonist. Poet Quincy Troupe will be ac- companied by his fine jazz musicians Harniet Bluiett and Abdul Wadud. Hamiet will play the baritine saxaphone while Abdul will play the cello. Wadud are well known to af- ficianados of contemporary jazz. Reviewed in Down Beat and The Village Voice, Bluiett has been called the most im- portant baritone player to come along since Harry Carner. Then it happened, Aerobic dancing came to· Union College. Of course not all the occupants of the class are as shapely as Ms. Fonda, although there are some that come close, and none are quite· as -limber. But· they are trying. Classes are held every Monday and Wednesday from 12:30 to 1:30 in the gym. The beat starts, the exercise is called, and the bodies begin _to move in semi-unison. Quote Contest Quincy Troupe is the editor of the new literary magazine The American Rag, co-editor of the . highly acclaimed anthology of Third World writing Giant Talk, and is the author of several volumes of poetry. His most recent book of poetry is Snake- Back Solos. Individual poems of his have appeared in many magazines and anthologies including Black World and New Black Voices. The three artists work ex~ tremely well together and much of the beauty of this ensemble comes from the interaction of the music and the words. Troupe's language is a comw pressed stream of movements, pictures, and sounds which evoke the jazz sounds of com- poser-musicians Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, and others. In short, Quincy Troupe and his jazz musicians are an ensemble well worth seeing. It is known that exercise is needed by the body, yet the idea has been advanced that some exercises, such as jogging, can actually be detrimental to one's health. But not so of aerobic dancing. To- be sure the body is pushed to perform, but there is no painful pounding, or ex- cruciating spasms. There is a loosening of thE!' muscles, and a certain limberness is achieved. By the end of the session, although the body may be tired, there are smiles on the faces of the exercisors and a certain lightness in their steps.

But he was even more con- cerned about the impact these centers would have on freedom of speech within our classrooms and school corridors. It would be easy, he suggested, for the F.B.I. to justify the use of student informers at scho()l. Innocent students involved in the exercise of their•· first amendm~nt rigbts to freedom 1 of speech and to peaceably assemble could be charged under federal law with con- spiracy to obstruct the Selective Service.

CONOORDIENSIS, February \1 1980 Page 11 $100 Poems Area Calendar This year's contest for the annual prize of $100 offered by The Academy of American Poets for the best poem or group of poems is now open, and !llanuscripts are being accepted by Professor James McCord in the English Department. The last day to snbmit JilOems will be Friday, April 4th. The winner 1 or winners) will be announced April 26th. The Academy of American Poets' University and College Prize Pr0gram was founded in 1955, with 10 colleges par- ticipating. Now, in its 25th anniversary year, over 100 colleges and universities throughotlt the country are taking part. Made possible by special gifts to the Academy, the competition was conceived -Ill encourage interest among college and unive1·sity students Continued from page 8 is rather unfortunate. Although the letter plagiarizes eertain alliterative key catch clauses in a meager attempt to capture my truly inimitable style, it has · that dubious, vague, confused, incoherent quality reminiscent of the posthumously discovered ramblings of frustrated poets who overdose on glue and freon. To wit, one of the \senten~es'' in said letter reads: \Act now on pressing probl~ms facing this campus like pige(m drop-. pings on Chet and the allsence of viable atmosphere in Schaffer Library wiH never be ad· dressed.'' Not even by the remotest stretch' of Lester Weiss' imagination cal]. this loosely connected bit of babble pretend to t.ry to be an English sentence. If one attempts to make sense of it, I have been requested to act like pigeon guano and atmosphere, a role even Tom Farrell would hesitate to tackle. With such editorial talent, it is no wonder that this poor excuse for a bird cage liner has gained in· ternational prominence as the , world's least respected student \: publication.

The latest victory for the once defeated O.S.U. team was against Stanford, 18·16. The stall was imposed by both teams; the last basket coming at 10:00 of the second half. Makes you wonder about the lack .of a time clock in college basketball. How about a 2:00 clock, not too long, not too short. Tom \Hollywood\ Henderson se_ems to be headed towards NewOrleans, New.York.Giants or-San Francisco. The .former Dalla.s Cowboy linebacker said he would change his name to \Broadway\ if the Giants sign him. Only two problems; the Gia11ts have the best outside linebacker in the game in Van Pelt and someone else has already taken the name of \Broadway\. The only charice is ·if the.Giants deal Van Pelt to hometown Michigan as he so desires. Milwaukee Bucks now have three ex-UCLA stars on roster (Meyers, Johnson and Washington) and two Indiana stars (Benson and Buckner). Los Angeles Lakers have Magic Johnson, Norm Nixon and Don Ford on their roster, surnames of American presidents from 1961-1976. Incidentally, Johnson replaced Ron Carter, a member of 1979 Laker team.

Women's Hoop Bob Pavadc puts the shot. Last Friday the women's basketball team defeated New Paltz 66-25 .. It was the team's first victory; they now sport a 1- 5 record. Brenda Hugick had 12 points, Debbie Downey had 10, and Ann Fitzmorris had 10 buckets and 9 rebounds. Patty Hamilton had 13 points and Sandi Key con- tributed with 8 rebounds. Ski Team Union dominated the first half while New Paltz shot poorly from the floar. The half time score was one-sided, Union led 38-3. The second half began with a fired up New Paltz but a well controlled and well coached Union team cooled them off. :;.- . Dot Scarpinato, Carol Wrenn, Sue Hennessy, and Liz Miller all had good games. Kirsten Peterson was sidelined with an ankle injury. Sheila O'Donnell is finally back with the team after an illness. . . by INGEMAR The Union College Ski Team for the past two weekends has competed against teams from Army, Syracuse, Cornell, RPI, Colgate, Alfred, and Clarkson, among others. On Friday, Jan. 25, RPI hosted the meet which took place at Jiminy Peak. Due to poor snow conditions only the Alpine events (slalom and giant slalom) were held. Usually, Nordic events (cross country race and ski jumping) are held the following day. For the giant slalom which took place Friday afternoon, the course was steep and very icy. Despite the conditions, Union's · Fred Thimm skied through the course the fastest of all racers, taking first place with a two · heat combined time of a second faster than his rival John Skinner of Cornell. Also among the top finishers was Union's > Tom Sargent whose combined , ~ time gave him fifth place. As a c team, Union finished second in 8 the giant slalom event, only a E few points behind Cornell. {!:. Union's fortunes in the slalom that morning did not turn out as well.

Chris Meyer set three school records as a freshman in the 200 yard individual medley (2:06.7), in the 200 yard backstroke (2:06.8) and in the 100 vard backstroke (58.0). He also· was a member of a school reco~d-setting 800 yard freestyle relay team.

The Union slalom racers, as many of the other competitors, bad slow times due to falls, and some could not finish at all. Only Thinun took all the gates with no difficulty. Thimm had the second fastest time behind Skinner of Cornell. He, however, was disqualified after a controversial call by a gate- keeper who said Thimm missed the third gate from the finisbo After a heated argument, the protest committee let the decision stand despite a number of coaches and racers who witnessed the final part of 1'himm's run and felt that he had not missed the gate. If his second place slalom time was not disqualified, with the corresponding points Union collld have finished in third or fourth place for the meet.-The Dutchmen, however, ended the day in eighth place among twelve teams. The ne~ weekend, Union traveled! toGreek Peak for the meet hosted by Cornell. In the slalom event which had sixty total racers from eleven teams, Union's racers did very well. Tom Sargent finished among the leaders again as his two heat combined times gave him seventh place. In addition, Jeff Ince finished in 15th place and Brian Walter took 19th place. As a team Union finished in fifth place in the Slalom. The team could have done even better as Fred ThilllPl was in third place after his first run. On his second run however; Thimm feU and missed a gate on tbe estremely steep course and did not finish. In the giant slalom that af- ternoon, Thiqun, for the second week in a row took first place. Almost as fast was Tom Sargent whose time gave him 4th place, one hundreth of second away from 3rd place .. Brad Kline, Brian Walter and Ellen Sheehan also. had very good runs and Union finished in 3rd place in the giant dlalom. Union was in 4th place after lhe Alpine events behind Cor- nell, Army and Clarkson. The ~ext day Union competed in the. cross country event. Because o( the lack of snow in this area, UIJion's racers had no snow training before this race. In bitter cold, Ed Hortsmann, Colleen Morris, Jeff Ince and Brian Walter made truely ga1lent efforts as they all completed the 10 kilometer course (6 miles including steep hills) in better than respectable time.

. ' Page 16 OONOORDIENSIS, February \t 1980 6porte Skaters Bow to Div. II ,Power by MATT KAYNE and RICH DECKER You don't usually come out of a 1-1 week and call it a good week, but few would say anything to the contrary about the Skating Dutchmen's past week. Union faced the two second place teams in each wing of Division II at home; Middlebury, second in the West, Union's Division on Wednesday night, and Holy Cross, second in the powerful east on Saturday night. The Garnet had not faced Middlebury earlier this year but they had seen the likes of Holy Cross. The latter, und~r head coach, Pete Van Buskirk, had dumped the Dutchmen in the Union Holiday Tournament by a deceptive score of 3-,1; decep· tive because they could have won by dozens of goals had they been a little bit luckier. Holy Cross needed Lady Luck and then some on Saturday night to squeak past the Garnet 4-3, in the first annual \Go Garnet Go\ Night. Clad in Garnet and playing before a boistorous, chanting partisan home town crowd, the final two periods as well as the closing moments of the first stanza were dominated by not only skating but Flying Dutchmen- outskating, out checking and outshooting 14-5 Holy Cross. This befuddled goalie Mark Yang went down to bewilder- ment. Holy Cross tallied first in the game as Bob Shea put one by Union Goalie Dave Josephson on a pretty pass from scoring leader Owen Dugan just over one minute into the game. When twenty seconds later defenseman Al Di Libero was called in front of the Union net for a high stick and a call on Bill Wall for an inadvertant trip followed, the once cheery crowd turned somber. Holy Cross, however, failed to tally on the double powerplay. Midway through the period, after two more questionable penalites, center John Hannifan combined with Chris Braun on a tally putting Holy Cross on top 2;0. Moving onto the ice for the second period, the near capacity crowd rose to its feet to greet the Garnet. The crowds urges were answered just over three minutes into the period as Mickey Perras, all over the ice, slid the first Union goal home on passes from Todd Fobare and Donnie Beall. Holy Cross came back, however, putting a damper on the Garnet's jubilation. Their goal came at 8:12 on a 2 on 1 break just as a double penalty to Union's Sparky Anderson and the opposition's Bob Shea was up. Right-winger John Fulchino sticked at a bounding puck on a rebound off of the pads of Josephson who had miraculously stopped a first shot by John Hannifan. Coming right back, the Garnet tallied once more before the end of the middle stanza. Set up by Brian Shea and .defen- seman Al DiLibero, John Mercer found himself in front of an open net and flipped the puck by outstretched goalie Mark Yang, whose pre-game goal against average was an im- pressive 3.12. As the teams went into their dressing rooms a late penalty called on Scott Fitzgerald .left Union shorthanded for the first 44 seconds of the third. Not only did the Dutchmen kill off the penalty, but only 5 minutes and 2 seconds later, .J,im Josephson brought the crowd to its feet once more on a powerplay as Yang was caught too far out of his net once again. Assisting on the goal were Captain Mark Haley an.d AI DiUbero. After a quick draw, however, Holy Cross charged right back. Center Gerry Curley managed to slap a pass to his left wing to Kevin Cyr off of the draw and the latter put a screened wrist shot through the pads of Josephson for the go-ahead goal. Skating evenly until the last few moments of play when the Garnet once again came on strong barraging Yang, Cross's John Ross was called for a trip at the blue line, with 1:00 to go. Pulling J osphson, Coach Morrison enabled ·a 64 skating advantage for the Garnet, who bombarded Young in the final moments. Young proved himself, however, as he set back the shots and he and Holy Cross had won their 11th of 14 Division II games. The win was not easy; the defeat was even tougher. Union had clearly outskirted 2nd place. Holy Cross, for the final two periods, yet came up empty handed. Moving into the home team's locker room following the game was much like en- tering a morgue-a dejected team had lost a tough one. Obviously upset by the loss, Coach Charlie Morrison was vehement about the refereeing in the opening stanze. Claiming that \early penalties put us in a hole\ Morrison was obviously distraught. This was not the first time that penalties had th· warted a Union offensive-- recent games against Babson and Oswego had hurt the Garnet's play. \No I'm not blaming the referees,\ said a diplomatic Morrison, \however calls in the early going were very questionable. I disagree with them. If they would've let my kids play hockey the outcome of the game would have been quite dif- ferent.\ \Everybody worked well in spite of it though. The boys played a hell of a game.\ Asked of the team's playoff chances with their current 7-12-1 on log, Morrison admitted that \if the Writers Needed If you are interested in wriiting sports articles please call Mark Palombo or Rich Hope 382-9029 (playoff) berths depend on the severity ,of the schedule, we have to be in the thick o.f it. Look at this week, we played the number two teams in both halves of the Division. We beat Middlebury, and lost a squeaker too, but outskated Holy Cross. Our chance should be good.\ Their chances should be good. But in all fairness, the Dut- chmen are in the weaker of the two fleets of Division II. Only five teams in the Western half sport record$ over .500, well ahead of second place Mid- dlebury. Looking at the East, however, 9 teams are over .500 with Bowdoin and Holy Cross battling it out for the top ranking. •• At the end of the season though, my boys will be there,\ added Morrison. Off in a silent ·corner of the locker room, Dave J osepbson ~ was undressing after a hard ~ fought,. undeserved loss. All he -5. could muster was \it was a tough gam.e to lose. We really had 'em.\ So ph Brian Shea moves the puck up the ice. .- Basketball Splits Two Union continued playing good basketball this past week by blowing out HobaFt 8.Hi5 on Friday night but dropping a close one to a good Rochester team, 64-62 on Saturday. The Dutchmen started off their two-game road trip in fine style, racing to a 46-35 halftime lead against the Statesmen of Hobart. Coach Bill Scanlon continued his mastery over Hobart as the Dutchmen coasted in the second half, allowing everyone on the team to get some playing time. Scanlon has never lost to a Hobart basketball team in his • • seven years as a coach. Once again Joe Cardany paced Union's scoring With 23 points. John Krum chipped in with 11 points and John \Count\ Montanile continues with his fine overall play, adding 13 points and 11 rebounds. Sophomore Jo.hn Jarosak contributed 10 points, including a breakaway slam dunk to open the second half. Jarosak is the leading dunker in Union's history. Jim McGhee turned in a steady overall performance. On Saturday night, before a boisterous crowd .of 1500 at Rochester's Palestra, the P·olish Olympics This coming Sunday af- ternoon, Feb. 10 at 2:00p.m. the Union College Skating Dut- chmen face off against the POLISH NATIONAL OLYMPIC TEAM in an exhibition game a\ · Achilles Rink.

The game was close throughout the entire contest, with the lead changing hands 19 times and with neither team holding more than a 7 point advantage. Union took its final lead of the game, 62-61, on a pair of free throws by ''Count'· Montanile with 2:05 left in the game. Rochester responded by converting a one and one situation, giving them a one point lead. Union worked the ball around and Joe Cardany got off a driving layup with 24 seconds left which spun around the rim and out. Rochester center Tom Soja made the first end of a one and one and the Dutchmen got the ball back with 18 seconds left and down by 2 points. Freshman Joe Clinton put up a shot as the clock wound down but it was off the mark. F-ollow- up shots by Montanile and Cardany also missed as the buzzer sounded ending the game. The defeat left the Dutchmen at 7-7 and Rochester upped its record to 13-5 .with only 2 losses to Division III opponents. Montanile led the Dutchmen with 18 points on. 5-7 shooting from the field and a perfect 8-8 from the foul line. Union returned to action last night against a tough Hamilton squad.

- - Ql ..., >- .0 0 .... 0 .I: a. President John S. Morris • Februa·ry 14, 1980 Volume 109, Number 14 • Morris Announces Changes: Brownlee Resigns Post Late Monday afternoon President John S. Morris released; the following memo to Faculty and the Administration announcing broad, fundamental changes in academic ad- ministratiOn. Most important among the many changes .an- nounced is the establishment of a new office, Vice President for Academic Affairs, which will replace the office of Dean of Faculty. _ The President wrote: admimstratwn of academic programs and curriculum development. Provost Huntley has in- dicated to me that he intends to return to teach at the end of this academic year. It would be my hope that the Vice President for Academic Affairs would be appointed before September 1, 1980. Student Standing Speaks The form which academic administration should take for the next few years has been of particular concern to me since coming to Union College. It .is necessary for us to have an administrative structure in this area which clearly coordinates all the academic programs of the College. The present structure, because of previous administrative changes, does not now have this .clear cen- tering of responsibility. It is my intention to appoint a Vice President for Academic Affairs to be the chief academic officer and Senior Vice President of the Coll~ge and who will have the administrative responsibility for the academic program of I have discussed these adQ ministrative changes with Dean Brownlee who feels that the changed responsibilities the reorganization requires would not be of sufficient scope to warrant a long-term mutual (!ommi~ent .. In the meanwhile Dean Brownlee will continue With her responsibilities m the curricular area and with the Committee on Faculty until September 1, 1980, whereupon she will be granted a study leave. Provost Huntley will assume full responsibility for faculty recruiting and academic departmental matters through the depart- ment chairpersons beginning next term and this transition will be phased in during this term. by PAUL GROSSMAN Automatically, as a result of a line or two in itfil program, the Union College Computer will spit put the names of all students . whose cumulative index is below. 2.0. .Because of another line or two in the computer's program, the words \Academic Warning\ will be printed on the grades that these students receive at the end of eachterm. Not so automatically is the way that the Committee on Student Stan'ding deals with a student's academic problems when the committee is presented with such a case. The committee consists of ten individuals: three ad- ministrators, including Dean KeUett; four faculty members, representing the four divisions in the school; and three students. They are there to make the decisions about what course of action would be best for a student having academic difficulty. JVIore than anything, the committee wants students to realize that they do not exist to scold or take punitive action, but to mak.e important decisions about a student's academic future. There is a basic chain of events that lead to a decision from the Committee. After a term of Academic Warding, the student must raise his or her cum. above a 2.0 or be placed on Special Academic Warning. If the student does not improve after this , the Committee will have to consider dropping the student. There are three different kinds of drops that the Com- mittee may decide upon. The first of these is termed, \D-1.\ When the Committee has decided on a ·n-1 drop, a letter is sent to the student at the end of the term, informing him or her of the Committee's decision to not allow the student to return to the school .for a period of two ac~demic terms (which in- cludes the summer term). To return to the school, the student must petition the r>ean of Stud~nts who will unilaterally decide if the candidate is to return or.not. Justification :for- returning consists of proof that the time away from Union was spent constructively. When the Committee decides . on a \D•2\ drop,. the same basic measures are undertaken as in a D-1 drop, except that the letter ~ contains strong recom-' mendation that the student not return to the school. If the student still wishes to petition for his return, the ~ntire Committee, not only \the Dean, must decide whether or not to accept the petition. The last kind of drop is ter- med \D-P.\ This kind of drop is decided upon when the Com- mittee feels that there is not and will not be a place for that student at Union. In that case, the drop is permanent. The prerequisite for a case to come before the Committee on Student Standing is poor academic performance. The individual's social behaviot· is not a causal factor in an in- dividual's case, but such in- formation would be considred valuable input after a case has been presented. Before a decisior, is reached, the Committee considers all information that is available to them about a particular can- didate. There are many dif- ferent sources of information for the Committee to tap. Medical personnel could provide medical reasons for poor. performance; professors submit written comments explaining a student's low grade .(e.g., lack of homework assignments). The College Advisor is another source of information for the Committee, but often a student will not contact his or her advisor and discuss any problems. Con- versely, the advisor does not always take the initiative and meet with an advisee having difficUlties. Lack of communication is the major source of complaint for the Committee. Professor John Sowa, Chairman of the Com- mittee, . presented a hypothetical case. \A student will come to us, shocked\at aeing .dr,Oflped. 'Phis . decision might ha.ve been • arrived at due to the fact that tne student . failed his three finals. The student never let anyone know that there was a death in the family immediately prior to finals, or that there was some kind of legitimate medical reason involved. The Com- mittee reaches its decisions solely on the basis of the in- formation available. If a student withholds important information like that, the Continued on page 10 the Com~J4e. · -· · In order to make cleartbe full range of responsibility of the new position, some restruc- turing of the present positions at the College will be necessary. This new position combines the responsibilities of the present Provost and Dean of Faculty and it is therefore necessary to reassign the responsibilities in the academic area somewhat differently. The present Dean of Faculty would have specific responsibility in the area of the Since the Vice President for Continued on pagt: 13 Cam.paign Information by ELLEN VAN DYKE In 1976-77 a plan was con- ceived to raise $38 million for Union College. It was approved by the Board of Trustees over a year ago and will be officially announced on Aprill, 1980. This plan, the Campaign for Union, was designed following a careful assessment of the College's financial requirements both to maintain its· current strengths and to permit future growth and development. Basically, the campaign is designed to \sustain the growth in annual support through the Annual Fund by continuing to nurture the relationships of alwnni and friends with the College\ and to \attain gifts-both inter vivos and testamentary-to increase the endowment of the College in order to provide it with the financial strength to maintain quality in the face of continued inflation without over- dependence upon rising tuition income and current gifts.\ The desjred $38 million will be divided in two ways: eight million will be applied to the Annual Fund which is used for the current operating costs of the College and thirty million dollars will go into the Union College Endowment, from which the Trustees will be able to direct the interest income to the most important needs of the College. The entire campaign is divided into three fund raising drives. The largest drive ~ to obtain gifts to endow/ the buildings of the original Ramee campus of Union College. During the winter of 1813, President Eliphalet Nott had a chance meeting with ~a French architect, Joseph Jacques Ramee. The result of ·this meeting was that Ramee, an architect ''thoroughly in- doctrinated with the spirit of the Romantic-Classical movem- ent,, was engaged to formulate a .plan for \the building of a new college and laying out seventy acres of lands in pleasure grounds for the institution.\ Union became the first college in America to have a. campus designed as an architectural whole. By the spring of 1813, the first buildings of the campus, North and South Colleges, were under construction. Ramee's design for the Con~inued on page 13 ... ·\ ...

Page 2 Guest Editorial by William Anthony Di Conza For those of us who have had the misfortune of dealing with Ellis Hospital, the story is always the same, one of discour.tesy and dereliction. Consistent claims of rudeness and neglecton the part of Ellis have led me to take a deeper look into this institution and the \benefits\ it provides the students of Union College. On the 23rd of January, a Union student, whHe viewing the Union- Plattsburgh hockey game, was struck above the left eye by an errant puck and seriously injured. Immediately realizing the severity of the injury, Union's trainers placed a temporary bandag.e over the wound and had Campus Security transport the student to Ellis Hospital far prompt, professional care. This turned out to be a grave mistake that could have cost the student per- manent loss of vision in his left eye. Upon arrival at the \hospital the injured party was not met With customary emergency room care. Instead of being examined immediately to determine the extentof damage to the eye, hidden under the now blood-soaked gauze placed there by Union's trainers,. the student and his escort were told to ''take a seat and watt, •' for they would not be able to be seen for ·'at least an hour or more.\ The two students found it hard to beHeve that they were standing in the lobbyofa hospital, one which happensto have a contract with Union College's Health Clinic, and not receiving any type of assistance. With their options United,. the students called back Campus Security and asked that a car be sent to trans.port them to St. Clair Hospital, five minutes away. To their surprise., the students received the basic' 'sorry, we can't get involved\ answer. When pressed for a reason, URion College's response was that because of the tie that exists between the Health Clinic and the Hospital it is not permissible to transport someone from Ellis to another hospital. The students, concerned over the possible further deterioration of the eye, summoned a taxi and proceeded to St. Clair. Greeted immediately upon en- trance, the students were told to fill out the proper admission forms while a doctor was called. Then, .for the first time since leaving the Union training room approximately one hour earlier, the bandage over the eye was removed and the severity of the wound determined. The student was told he had suf- fered a frontal orbital fracture and received thirty-five stitches. The eye, as it turned out, had narrowly escaped injury. The night was over and the students returned to campus. Outraged over their treatment at Ellis Hospital, the students involved and the injured party's parents scheduled a meeting with Mr. Michael1ndolina, the Assistant Dean of Students. The conference created as much turmoil as the night of the accident itself. It seems as though tlt.e Hospital's story and the students' story directly conflict regarding what actually happened when the students entered the hospitalon the evening of January 23rd. Ellis claims that the ·injured student was admitted, his wound examined, and its severity determined. He was then told he would have to wait \no more than 15 minutes'' before the stitching room opened and he could be treated. The students claimed this version of the evening's events to be totally inac- curate on all accounts.

Page 2 CONOORDIENSIS, February 14, 1980 Guest Editorial by William Anthony Di Oonza For those of us who have had the misfortune of dealing with Ellis Hospital, the story is always the same, one of discour.tesy and dereliction. Consistent claims of rudeness and neglect on the part of Ellis have led me to take a deeper look into this institution and the \benefits\ it provides the students of Union College. On the 23rd of January, a Union student, while viewing the Union- Plattsburgh hockey game, was struck above the left eye by an errant puck and seriously injured. Immediately realizing the severity of the injury, Union's trainers placed a temporary bandage over the wound and had Campus Security transport the student to Ellis Hospital for prompt, professional care. This turned out to be a grave mistake that could have cost the student per- manent loss of vision in his left eye. Upon arrival at the \hospital the injured party was not met with customary emergency room care. Instead of being examined immediately to determine the extent of damage to the eye, hidden under the now blood-soaked gauze placed there by Union's trainers, the student and his escort were told to ''take a seat and wait,'' for they would not be able to be seen for ''at least an hour or more.\ The two students found it hard to believe that they were standing in the lobby of a hospital, one which happens to have a contract with Union College's Health Clinic, and not receiving any type of assistance. With their options limited, the students called back Campus Security and asked that a car be sent to transport them to St. Clair Hospital, five minutes away. To their surprise, the students received the basic \sorry we can't get involved\ answer. When pressed for a reason, Union College's response was that because of the tie that exists between the Health Clinic and the Hospital it is not permissible to transport someone from Ellis to another hospital. The students, concerned over the possible further deterioration of the eye, summoned a taxi and proceeded to St. Clair. Greeted immediately upon en- trance, the students were told to fill out the proper admission forms while a doctor was called. Then, for the first time since leaving the Union training room approximately one hour earlier, the bandage over the eye was removed and the severity of the wound determined. The student was told he had suf- fered a frontal orbital fracture and received thirty-five stitches. The eye, as it turned out, had narrowly escaped injury. The night was over and the students returned to campus. Outraged over their treatment at Ellis Hospital, the students involved and the injured party's parents scheduled a meeting with Mr. Michael Andolina, the Assistant Dean of Students. The conference created as much turmoil as the night of the accident itself. It seems as though the Hospital's story and the students' story directly conflict regarding what actually happened when the students entered the hospital on the evening of January 23rd. Ellis claims that the injured student was admitted, his wound examined, and its severity determined. He was then told he would have to wait \no more than 15 minutes'' before the stitching room opened and he could be treated. The students claimed this version of the evening's events to be totally inac- curate on all accounts. The students raised the following points of contradiction: First, the injured party entered the hospital and sat in the waiting room while his escort did all of the talking. He was never seen by anyone, not even an orderly. Second, if the student was admitted, then why was there no record of this when his friend called that evening to find out his condition? Third, if the student was examined, then why was the original bandage still over the wound when the students arrived at St. Clair later that evening? Fourth, if, in fact, the student was admitted, examined, and told that he would only have to wait fifteen minutes, then why would the students have bothered wasting time leaving Ellis to travel to another hospital? In the light of these facts, the story Ellis presents is a rather difficult one to believe. In fact, it is almost inconceivable that the student's name appeared anywhere in the hospital's records. That is, of course, unless his name was not supplied by the student himself but by the Clinic on campus. If this be the case, Ellis Hospital should be held accountable for the falsification of their records and Union's Clinic, which I remind you again is under contract with Ellis Hospital, should be held accountable for supplying the Hospital with this needed information. The fact that the student did not bring an action against the school is no reason why the concerned parties should not be compelled to tell the complete ~nd honest story of what happened that January evening. I am in no position to bring charges against Ellis Hospital for falsifying their records, for I was not there that night. However, I am in a position to see that the repreated mistreatment of our students comes to an end. Union students do not need Ellis Hospital.

In the article, Kellett asserted that all profits realized by the Union College Food Service are \redirected back into the food service,\ a fact held in dispute by our S()urce. Indeed, insisting certain facts substantiate hiS claim, the sow:~e called Kellett's assertion \a big lie.\ · If the information our source has is sufficient to substantiate his . allegation, then necessarily several questions are raised . Early this year, we were told, attempts were made to find out about the fiscal data pertaining to the Union College F00d Service. Angelo, a straight guy, as last week's article adequately pointed out, was willing to talk turkey. Dean Kellett, when approached, told a· different story, and then had access to the information sealed, and flll'ther stifled Angelo. The logical question is, then, why did the Dean do this? Subsequent investigation and documentation proved to our source that the Food Service does not channel all revenue back into itself, but rather is considered a \contribution center\ for the campus, and as such, profits from it are funneled into the general fund. It was further revealed that the Food Service is mandated to make a certain amount of money a year in pmfit. a percentage of which is earmarked for the general fund. There are conflicting accowtts as to the actual amount of profit realized by the Food Service, however, our source indicated that the mandated profit margin was in excess of fifteen thousand dollars. Tbat documented, we must then ask, why does the Dean not want the student body to be aware of this? . :Perhaps the Dean. doesn't want to hear about tbe quality of the food, or the cost of it. A week ago, Angelo pamphleteered in the dining halls about the quality of his suppliers, the quality of their vast storage facilities (as if that affected the quality of our food), andfurther asserted in a fashion no doubt suitable for a Junior Higp School home economics class the quality of his twenty percent fat hamburgers. His efforts were noble, although simplistic. The fact remains, the quality or diversity of the Food Service aside, that there are complaints about it. Such complaints deal with the cost of the meal plans, the cost of non-meal plan meals (cash meals), the nature of the food (although Angelo iinplored that we stay away from starches, it seems that the bulk of the meals are starchy in nature), and few and far between complaints about the service. A favorite comparison of Seven Sjster SOJourners is the cost of brunch. At Mt. Holy<lke the cost of an unlimited steak and eggs bnmch is three dollars. At Union, our brunch is three dollars as·well; however, we have to contend with fatty bacon and undercooked (or alternately burned) sausage. Steak, when served, is on a on~a,meal basis. You draw the com- parisons. (Cash meals cost three dollars for lunch, and three-fifty for dinner-a bit steep. At Mt. Holyoke, the girls get three free passes per ·tenn for meals, and the most expensive meal, dinner (waited, steak, etc., galore), costs three dollars. Are we paying a lot for our meals, not to better the Fooo Service, as Dean Kellett suggests, but to support the general, fund? Granted, a limited comparison was drawn, but the question remains. To be sure, if Angelo had all of the profit money at hand from the Food Service, as a capable and creative administrator, we would see a dramatic increase in the quality of service rendered. That is not the case, however, yet Dean Kellett has insisted upon denying in print what our source msists is true. Are we not to know the disposition of our money? Is the Food Service an adequate center from which to draw funds before bettering it? If the Dean is not honestly disclosing such pertinent information, is he perfonning the role of liaison between the students and administration, or is his credibility in doubt? Think positively about this. (Knee Deep was conceived as a pl'ovocative, and slightly outrageous, forum for the stimulation of controversial thought.

Hoc'key To the Editor: As Director of Achilles Rink and Head Hockey Coaclf, I am responding to the recent letter from Laura Bernson and Susan Maroni which .appeared in the February 7th issue of the Concordie.nsis. · I would like to point out that the Varsity Hockey Team, the Achilles Rink Staff and myself deeply appreciate the fantastic fan support we have been receiving from the Union College Community and Season Ticketholders. In your letter you mentioned that \It is generally understood that the seats in this section· (student bleacher section) are first come-first serve\. This is not so, as all tickets with the exception of standing room only, indicate the Section, Row and Seat that the ticltet holder must oecupy to eliminate any problems. or aggrevations such as you experienced. All minor officials serving at Achilles Rink are volunteers and their assistance is very much appreic~ted and needed. If in the future you have any prl)blems with acquiring proper seating, please notify the person on duty in the Box Office and they in turn will have a Full* Time employee of Achilles Rink attend to your needs. Thank you for your letter and support of Union College Hockey.

Fox House Nihilism Is this college really suffering from student apathy as has been echoed time and again in the past several issues of Coneordiensis? I believe that this claim has some merit. But I'm more inclined to think that our college sqffers. from something far wors~; a handful of \shoot-from-th~hip\egotists, disguising their own need to be consistently provocative behind a crusade against student apathy. I'm tired of picking up the newspaper only to read per- sonal vendettas against this student, that professor, this reporter or that administrator. I'm tired of reading about how Concordiensis misrepresented this committee, about how fraternities have become the harbor for all our outrages, about how this group is ·not doing its job or about this in- dividual's \poignant selfishness.\ I'm tired of the fighting and I'm tired of the idle criticism. This is not to suggest that some of these cQmplaints aren't worthwhile. It's saying that I'm tired of trashy writing. If I were genuinelY convinced of this tactless group's sincerity, I believe I'd see it in clear, sophisticated writing. Has everyone forgotten the power of subtle persuasion which can achieve results and still maintain respect for the author, himself, respect for the subject· of the report and just as im- portantly, respect for the newspaper in which the article . will appear? All I've been reading are poor attempts at being a comedian, retorts steeped in sarcasm, inside jokes and · most repulsive of all, outright negativism that offers no solutions. Even the most benign of articles attract vengeful antagonism. It's no wonder that our student body hesitates to involve itself. As reflected right here in Con~ cordiensis, why should anybody wantto treat himself to the kind of abuse that we offer our fellow students, faculty and ad .. ministration? EVeryone has the right to air a complaint and a right to mak-e an accusation; but more certain than that, everyone has the right to be treated with respect. So stop turning the newspaper into a receptacle for senseless, defeatist gibberish.

Andrea Bowers Unsafe To the ,Editor: \Apathetic\ has often been used to describe the Union College student body. Perusing through .past issues of Concordy we have noticed the frequent use of this term by staff, editors, students and ad- ministrators.

In the article, Kellett asserted that all profits realized by the Union College Food Service are \redirected back into the food service,\ a fact held in dispute by our source. Indeed, insisting certain facts substantiate his claim, the source called Kellett's assertion \a big lie.\ If the information our source has is sufficient to substantiate his allegation, then necessarily several questions are raised. Early this year, we were told, attempts were made to find out about the fiscal data pertaining to the Union College Food Service. Angelo, a straight guy, as last week's article adequately pointed out, was willing to talk turkey. Dean Kellett, when approached, told a different story, and then had access to the information sealed, and further stifled Angelo. The logical question is, then, why did the Dean do this? Subsequent investigation and documentation proved to our source that the Food Service does not channel all revenue back into itself, but rather is considered a \contribution center\ for the campus, and as such, profits from it are funneled into the general fund. It was further revealed that the Food Service is mandated to make a certain amount of money a year in pX\ofit a percentage of which is earmarked for the general fund. There are conflicting accounts as to the actual amount of profit realized by the Food Service, however, our source indicated that the mandated profit margin was in excess of fifteen thousand dollars. That docwnented, we must then ask, why does the Dean not want the student body to be aware of this? Perhaps the Dean doesn't want to hear about the quality of the food, or the cost of it. A week ago, Angelo pamphleteered in the dining halls about the quality of his suppliers, the quality of their vast storage facilities (as if that affected the quality of our food), and further asserted in a fashion no doubt suitable for a Junior High School home economics class the quality of his twenty percent fat hamburgers. His efforts were noble, although simplistic. The fact remains, the quality or diversity of the Food Service aside, that there are complaints about it. Such complaints deal with the cost of the meal plans, the cost of non-meal plan meals (cash meals), the nature of the food (although Angelo implored that we stay away from starches, it seems that the bulk of the meals are starchy in nature), and few and far between complaints about the service. A favorite comparison of Seven Sjster soJourners is the cost of brunch. At Mt. Holyoke the cost of an unlimited steak and eggs brunch is three dollars. At Union, our brunch is three dollars as well, however, we have to contend with fatty bacon and undercooked (or alternately burned) sausage. Steak, when served, is on a on~a-meal basis. You draw the com- parisons. (Cash meals cost three dollars for lunch, and three-fifty for dinner-a bit steep. At Mt. Holyoke, the giris get three free passes per tenn for meals, and the most expensive meal, dinner (waited, steak, etc., galore), costs three dollars. Are we paying a lot for our meals, not to better the Food Service, as Dean Kellett suggests, but to support the general fund? Granted, a limited comparison was drawn, but the question remains. To be sure, if Angelo had all of the profit money at hand from the Food Service, as a capable and creative administrator, we would see a dramatic increase in the quality of service rendered. That is not the case, however, yet Dean Kellett has insisted upon denying in print what our source insists is true. Are we not to know the disposition of our money? Is the Food Service an adequate center from which to draw funds before bettering it? If the Dean is not honestly disclosing such pertinent information, is he performing the role of liaison between the students and administration, or is his credibility in doubt? Think positively about this. (Knee Deep was conceived as a provocative, and slightly outrageous, fonun for the stimulation of controversial thought.

Through ~ hard work and patient diplomacy, these students, ~ representing the Non- 0 -+- o. .r:. I c. ALLIGNED African nation of Zambia, were able to impress other students from a wide Hugh Allen Wilson-Director of Union's Glee Club range of colleges throughout - Glee Clubs In New York Schenectady, N.Y.-The Union College Men's and Women's Glee Clubs, under the direction of Hugh Allen Wilson, will be featured in a per- formance Sunday, Feb. 17 in St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York City. The concert will begin at 4:45 p.m., followed by a mass at 5:30 ·· p.m. Admission is free. Performing with the Union Glee Clubs will be the Lady Cliff Glee Club of West Point, under the direction of Dorothy Ann Davis, and the Villanova Glee Club, under the direction of Dennis Wilde. Together the groups will present \Motet 6\ (Praise the Lord) by Bach, directed by Wilde, and the concluding choruses of Handel's \Messiah directed by Davis. Wilson will provide organ ac- companiment for both pieces. Individually, the Union MeR's Glee Club will present \0 Domine Jesu Christe\ by Josquin Despres, and the Women's Glee Club will sing \Cantate Domino\ by Hans Leo Hassler. The program for the Lady Cliff Glee Club includes \Fanfare for Thanksgiving\ by Glarum and \Ave Maria\ by Head. The Villanova Glee Club will offer Viadana's \E~tate Justi'' and \Crucifixus\ by Lotti. Within the last seven years, the Union Men's Glee ·Club, established in the late 1800s, has come to be among the most highly respected men's choruses in the ·coWltry. Since 1973, the group has performed three times in New York's Lincoln Center, and in 1977 toured Venezuela with the Wheaton College Glee Club. Upon the club's return, it performed at the White House . for a state dinner in honor of ' Venezuelan Presklent Carlos Andres Perez. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy and the U.S. .- Military Academy at West Point. A concert with· Amherst College is planned, for the fall. Among the works presented by the Women's Glee Club are Handel's \Messiah \Gloria\ by Vivaldi, and ''The American Mercury\ by Randall Thomp- son. The group performed with a 1;3-piece orchestra in a solo Chri$tmas concert in Schenectady last year. Wilson, in addition to directing the Union Glee Clubs, is the College organist and harpsichordist and. has gained widespread fan1e on these in~ struments. Trained at Yale under fiin- demith and Leo Schrade, he was accompanist for the Yale Glee Club and assistant to Marshall · Bartholomew. He later studied organ with Marcel Dupre In Paris and harpsichord with Gustav · Leonhardt in Amsterdam. Wilson has been the recipient of many honors, including the Woods•Chandler Prize for organ playing, the Steinway Citation for service to American music, and most recently, the Union College Alumni Meritorius Service Award for outstanding service to the college and the com- munity. Wilson is a former member of the board of directors of the Intercollegiate Musical Council, an organization which works for the advancement of male choruses across the country. ABC Aids uc SCHENECTADY, N.Y.- More than 130 community volunteers, representing businesses throughout the Capital District, gathered at the Holiday Inn in Schenectady last week to kick off the tenth Annual Business Campaign in support of Union College. The goal for this year's business drive is to break the 1979 . record of $130,258, cam- paign chairman Kenneth A. Dagostino said. Keynote speaker Dr. JohnS. Morris, Union College president, told the assembled group: \In terms of both tangible results and symbolic meaning - as an endorsement of the quality and significance of Union - the Annual Business Campaign effort provides vital support to the College.\ The . president praised .Dagostino for community leadership and for his dedication to the College. \Union is very fortunate to be part of a community which has repeatedly demonstrated its generosity toward, and support of, the College,\ Morris said. He added that \continued financial and moral support of\ the College by the local business community\ will be in- creasingly important as Union prepares to enter its third. century .. Dagostino, secretary-trea- surer of Dagostino Building Blocks, Inc., Schenectady, noted that contributions to the College through the Annual Business Campaign have more than doubled since the cam- paign began in 1971. In the past nine years,. the can1paign has raised a total of $750,000 for the College. Last year's record business drive total of $130,258 Will be \the bench mark by which all future campaigns will - be judged,\ Dagostino said. In outlining why area businesses support Union, Dagostino spoke of the \economic stin1ulus Union College provides to the surroWlding communities.\ North America. For four .days the Union delegates familiarized them- sclves with the proceedings of the United Nations in action. There was a lot of work - the committees were in sessi 0 ~ ,for eleven and one half hQurs on Friday alone, but all who went felt .the experience was well worth it. The effort Unic:m' s Zambian delegates put in to preparing for Princeton showed, as Zambia became a powerful Third - World Nation in every committee. The_ respect earned ·by the delegation was eyident, as ~nion College was personally mvited to attend three other conferences this yeat·. The Princeton conference . was a simulation of the actual workings of the United Nations, and many prominent schools were in attendence. The delegates negotiated with other nations, made spee<;hes before • their committees, and drew-up resolutions ;md amendments that were often heate.dly debated. Other schools represented at the conference included: Harvard, Columbia - Barnard, D.usquesne, the University of Michigan, Brown, the University of Pennsylvania, Weslyan, Rutgers, Haverfo~d and Georgetown. Obviously Union was in tough competition. as part of a course, with full credit for their participation. Needless to say this places Union students at a disad- vantage. ln addition the delegates miss two days of classes and fall behind in course work for the week :or so preceding and including the U.N. conference. The Princeton delegates all were concerned' about this and intend to lobby in the Political Science Depart- ment and with the ad- ministration for course credit for model - United Nations participation. The .preparation is equivalent to that of many classes, with a large number of docwnents and information on . reserve in, the library an.d a working knowledge of parliamentary procedure necessary. The I.RC. also has sponsored lunches, 11osting clubs from other local colleges. Most r.ecently, Professor Brown of Union's Political Science Dep~rtm:ent spoke to a large group of interested stqdents. An eventual goal of the clubis to co- ordinate the clubs from these area schools into a cohesive, closely - knit group. Already Union is in contact with Russel Sage College to set up a con- sortium to share· their funds, and Siena and S.U.N.Y. All)any have also kept in close contact with the I.R.C. Union's I.R.C. has n1ost recently had to cancel plans to attend the Model United Nations at Harvard this month, for what would be their second straight year, because of a shortage of funds. This United Nations is one of the best, and it is unfortunate that Union had to turn down such an important personal invitation. Other recent victims to a shortage of time and money in the up- coming months include the very difficult and prestigious Nationals, a· week long simulation held in the United Nations Con1plex in New York City, upcoming model United Nations a~ Duquesne and Eastern Carolina, and a model Congress at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. Over the last two years, the I.R.C. has increasingly spread Union's excepent reputation, despite being hampered by minimal funds and schedule restrictions. Last year thirteen delegates from Union attended the Harvard model U.N., where they won one \Best Delegate Award\ and one \Honorable Mention\ which went to current I.R.C. president Keith Cockerham. In November, seven delegates traveled to the University of Pennsylvania and participated, representing Norway .. Now, with the Prin- ceton U.N. behind them Union has gotten a solid outside reputation consistent with the excellence of the international portion of its Political Science and History Departments. Because of its nature, the I.R.C. has some trouble getting by with its tax allocation. They were offered the representation of Somalia at Princeton, but had to turn it down because of their limited budget. They also bad to cut short their one-man representation of Luxembourg . Although time would not permit attending all of these events, the I.R.C. hopes to increase club funding in the 1980-81 academic year so that they may par- ticipate more actively both at other colleges and here on their own campus. in a special N.A.T.O. con- ference. There are other problems that the I.R.C. faces in contrast with the U.N. delegations from other schools. Since the group is a club, the delegates and mem- bers unfortWlately receive no class credit. Many other schools represented at\ these con· ferences send their delegations The very fact that Union is invit~d back to n1odel United Nations at presitigous colleges . such as Harvard, Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania is ample proof that they suc- cessfully reflect the excellent educational and social nature of this school. To this end they are not only excellent tepresen- tatives of. those countr,ies represented in the United Nations but ofUnion itself.

Thes.e traits, t,faditionally attributed to men,. are not expected of women in our culture~ As a result, a vast majority of women suffer from \math phobia\. Susan D. Britain, assistant professor of psychology has co- authored a research paper entitled \The Relationship of Math Avoidance and Reading Avoidance to Sex-Role Expectations and Later Professional Development\ which she will present at an upcoming professi:onal con- ference. In her paper Professor Brit;lin cites that ''there are lots of societal re'asons .for math avoidance in girls: There is no strong evidence of basic genetic differences . in specified math related abilities. Doing well in math has come to mean doing well in a masculine domain into which few girls and women enter. Success in math- related activitie's may jeopardize a young woman's sense of acceptable femininity in this culture.\ Children learn as early as four years of age the type of behavior society deems ap- propriate for them. According to Britain, ''Math seems to be an important syJJlbol of masculine instrumental behavior.\ By fifth grade many girls believe that there is no use for math in the job market they wish to pursue and therefore have tended to stop taking math courses after algebra. In fact, according to research by Douglas (79), math anxiety is greatest in fifth, seventh,ninth, and eleventh grades. Even those girls who are highly skilled in math, fail to pursue careers in math-related careers such a:s engineerin6 and business administration because \it may bring on the anticipation of diminishing social success.\ The role that the father assumes is a crucial deter- minant as to whether his daughter will pursue a non- traditional career. If a daughter is made to believe that she ''can inco·rporate male sex-typed behaviors into a primary feminine identity\ she will continue her .studies in math and math-related sul>jeets. The mother's role in her d~ughters career choices are crucial as wen.

It is in- teresting to note th~t many women do not pursue a career in math related fields because of the \lack of interaction bet- ween people in these fields. Whereas· men are expected to d~al with technical and mechanistic activities, many women prefer jobs which are more personable. Professor Britain states that · while young boys associate math with masculinity, they believe that \reading. and in~ tellectual pursuits dependent on reading\ are feminine. This.sex typing discourages young boys from acquiring an eagerness to read. Though boys eventually outgrow ''reading phobia\ their lack of motivation occurs at the Slm!e time as girls excell at re.ading.

Jimmy Dorsey Band is very well known and it should prove to be a very enjoyable event for the parents to top off their weekend. Looking Back At Union continue throughout the day on the lawn surrounding the Nott Mel'rn)rial. Also, there will be Prize Day in the Memorial Chapel from 11 :·30-1 :00, recognizing student athletic achievements. These prizes and the displays of student's creative accomplishments and projeets will \show off the Union students\ to their parents, according to Mr. Andolina. He hopes that this Parent's Weekend will \involve the parents directly in the Union College experience\. In fact, the theme of the weekend is ''self·recognition\ and the goal ils to make both students and tlleirparents more aware of the talents and abilities of the Union College student body. These displays will also include faculty achievements. Sunday's activities will feature a Family Brunch at 10:00 A.M. a reception in Hale House at 11:15 and a Women's Glee Club concert at 2:00P.M. in the Memorial Chapel.

Kramer vs. Kramer: \' Born in Worcester, England on May 10 1 l946, Dave Mason took up the guitar at age 14 with, great diligence, his main early influences being the blues in general and ·Elmore James in specific. Eventually, he formed his first group, The Jaguars. His next band, The Hellions included Jim Capaldi, . Gordon Jackson and Luther Gt·osvenor. They gained a local reputation, and played ~Hamburg's Star Club among other venues. Dave's first professional experience was as a roadie for the Spencer Davis Group. In between tu·ning guitars and changing strings, Dave would · grab a few jams with the then boy-wonder Stevie WinwoQd. He even participated on the \Pm A Man\ session--.playing. tam- bourine. Two other musicians also made cameo appearances in the beefed-up rhythm section of that session: Capaldi and Chris Wood. Sixmonths after the session, those three along with Stevie Winwood, secluded themselves in a Berkshire cottage.. to create Traffic. At the outset, Dave was an integral force in the band. Traffic's first bona fide hit - reaching nUiilber two on the British charts - was Mason's composition \Hole In MyShoe.\ On their first album, Dear Mr. Fantasy, Dave's whimsical melodies and good- time vocals , provided a delightful contrast to Win- wood's contributions, and the dichotomy between the two helped make Traffic'~ early recordings . very diverse and energetic. Dave's material for the gvoup's second LP, simply entitled Traffic shOwed greater matmity and depth than any of his previous works. One of Mason's songs on that album, ''Feelin' Allright,\ has become a ·Classic, having b~come a million seller for Joe Cocker and a hit for Grand Funk Railroad and Three Dog Night as well as Traffic. An Overblown~Movie? By the time Traffic was released, however, Mason had alr~ady . decided to leave the group in order to pursue a solo career. For the next year and a ·half, Mason wrote material for an upcoll).ing album and managed to involve hiinsel£ in several interesting projects along the' way. He produced Family's first album, Music In A Doll's House, a classic which was musically and technically ahead of its time. Later, around the middle of 1969, Mason joined the Delaney & Bonnie and friends tour with Eric Clayton. By the end of that year, Mason was. ready to record his own album and, with the aid of Delany & Bonnie, Leon Russell, Rita Coolidge~ Carl Radle; Jim Gordon and many others, he made Alone Together, which received widespread critical acclaim on both sides of the Atlantic. by KYLE BRESSLER Who says that your Concordy movie reviewer doesn't have any guts'? Yes folks, this week we're going to get vicious, malicious, and downright cruel. We're going to attack the most praised movie since, well, way back when. Are you ready for this? We're going to criticize Kramer vs. Kramer!! ! Now. before you gag on your popcorn and start chucking MEL BROOKS In HIGH ANXIETY High Anxiety Feb. 15-17 Fri. -. 10 Sat & Sun - 9 & 11 raisenettes, let me explain. This reviewer does not think Kramer vs. Kramer is a bad movie - in fact, I think it is rather good. The major complaint I have with it however, is the stupendous publicity it has received in the national media, billing it as one of the great movies of our time. It is no such animal, though· by reading magazines like Time and Newsweek. one would get this impression. Kramer vs. Kramer, directed by Robert Benton, is based upon a book of the same name written by Avery Corman (who also wrote Oh God! ) . It stars Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep, and Justin Henry, a newcomer to the movie scene. The basic story is that of a young ad· vertising executive, who, on the verge of his biggest success, is abandoned by his wife. Left to raise a child by himself,. he encounters many pitfalls, but just when he seems to have built a firm relationship with the boy (drum roll), the mother returns, wanting the child back. Altogether, the movie has a very current tempo to it, which may be partially responsible for its ttuge success. Mr. Hoffman's acting stands out noticeably, as he gives the best performance of his career. The chemistry between Mr. Hoffman and the boy is tremendous, resulting in some. of the best scenes of the movie. ~s. Streep, on the other hand, performs well, but her effort is obviously short of the publicity it has been getting, possibly the result of a lack of screen -time. 1st Act: De metra Ponasakos 2nd Act: Chris Staler, Mary Meacher MC: Eric Ruben Tickets on sale 8 p.m. in Carneg·ie BE THERE! The weakness in this movie is not the acting, but the story itself. For instance, what happens to the boy when he comes home from school, and who cleans the apartment (Mr. Benton recently admitted tG these errors in the New York Times, with much cif the blame falling on Sherry Lansing, the new Hollywood wunderkind)? Mr. Corman's book solved' these problems, and one wonders why the movie couldn't (this reviewer would like to point out tnat he usually does not spend time reading books abouf movies he is about to see- in this case however, his sister threatened to. reveal the en- dfng! ) . Another shortcoming is the· courtroom scene, which seems on the verge of satire. If one thinks that this is nit- ., picking, one is not very far off ''·base, because on the whole, Kramer vs. Kramer· is an ex- cellent film. As stated before however, the. enormous publicity preceding the movie seemed to have closed the eyes . of many of my counterjlaits. For all its worth, Kramer receives Once again, Mason turned to various outside projects to keep hirnselfbusy over the next year and a half. During the summer of 1970, he played various gigs . with Clapton's Derek and the Dominoes. Early in 1971, he joined up with the late Mama Cass and a three piece group which recorded one album and embarked on a national tour in the U.S. Upon returning to England, Mason surprised one and all by rejoining Traffic for a series of concerts, which resUlted in the recording of a live LP, Welcome to The · Canteen. Backin the States once again, Mason· journeyed to San francisco, where he met ~P with Mitch's Maze ------ ..... drummer Rick Jaeger and bassist Lonnie Turner. \After only five weeks of rehearsal, they had a stint at ·The Troubador in Los Angeles where their show was recorded. Afterwards, the trio entered the studio to lay down some ad- ditional tracks· to what even- tually became Mason's second solo album, Headkeeper. In ~972, Pave signed an ex- clusive recording contract with Columbia Records and, in March, 197~, he weqt into studios in Los Angeles and San Francisco to cut his first album for .the label. Arranged. and produced by Mason, the album ended a per-iod of almost three · years since his pr_evio1,1s studio album. Appropriately titled It's Like You Never Left, the LP showed Mason in fine form with backup help from the likes .of Stevie- Wonder, Greg Reeves, Jim Keltner,. Graham Nash and Chuck Rainey, among. others. October, 1974, saw the release of Dave's second Columbia album, simply entitled Dave Mason, In addition to the usual ·compliment of outstanding Mason compositions, the LP included imaginative renditions of Bob Dylan's \All Along The Watchtower\ and Sam Cooke's \Bring It On Home To Me.\ Mason continues to win more fans both on record artd on stage, this being exemplified by one of the most impressively extensive tours seen in years. From October, 1975 to J.anuary 1976, 45 Cities will see Dave, with, a projected audience ex- ceeding 500,000. The Dave Mason Band on this tour is the same fiae collection of performers· that highlight Dave's latest LP, \Split Coconut\: Gerald Johnson on bass, who has· provided tl1e backbone for such talents as Elvis, Sweet Inspiration and Steve Miller; Jay Winding, the keyboard talent behind Jackson Browne and Seals & Crofts .among others; Rick Jaeger, drummer with· Dave for several years now; and the phenomenally gifted guitarist, Jim Kreuger, a constant compliment to Dave's creation on stage and on record. · An important and refreshing artist, Dave Mason continues to b1,1ild a reputation of tasteful creativity, adding personal dimension to rock and roll today.

... :l r s OONOORDIENSIS 1 February 14, 1980 . ~. - . - . - . Page 7 culture C~slng the Promised Land Twenty-four year old Caleb Carr describes himself with pride as a Romantic--\with the bjg R.\ He's a native New Yorker who grew up in Greenwich Village. His father was a beat poet. Caleb went to Friends Seminary,- and later N.Y.U. He likes all kinds of music--Puccini, Beethoven, Mozart, Townshend, Allman, Clapton, Miller, Sinatra-;md plays the electric guitar. And he likes to ride a cheap bike around the city just to see what's going on. Caleb Carr is also the author of CASING THE PROMISED LAND (Harper & Row, $99~; February 27, 1980), his first novel-and first published p~ece of writing. Praised · by Publishers Wee,kly as \an honest, realistic novel,\ it tells the story of three young men, Mike Jason, and Henry, who find an apartment in Green- which Village (a seventh-floor walkup) ·and work at various jobs (doorman, musician, record store clerk) to pay the rent. It is very much a young man's novel, a tale of a journey in search of the self. And in the way it takes Vietnam, Watergate, sexual freedom, pot, booze, television, and rock and roll for granted, it is one of the first works of fiction to describe today's youth--the generation come of age in the seventies. Recently, enroute to rehearsal with his rock group, Caleb took time to answer some questions _for us. Q. Why did you write this book? A. Out of a great desire to relate a message. Writing this book came out of a long series of attempts to enter society and being sourly rebuffed. Not on an intellectual level,. but on a level of attitude and style. Q. What's the basic message of CASING THE PROMIS~D LAND? A. To show how increasing numbers of young people of varied backgrounds and behavior attempt to get in- volved in society without much success. Society is not really willing to absorb them. Background isn't the issue. That's why I have the characters coming from diverse backgrounds-one from Park A venue, the other from a bohemian family in GreenwiCh Village. Q. You've called your characters ''post-sixties\' .people. What'does this mean? innocence at an early age. And drugs were so much a part of their early experience that by the time they reached maturity they were tired of them. Q. What do you feel that music means to your cbarac· ters? A. Music is probably the onh thing that did not betray its contract with these people. Families did, governments did, even the social movements of the sixties did. Music's contract was very simple-to provide a little escape. It never let you down. Just by being in an audience, just be .being alive at the time it's big, you belong to it and it belongs to the audience as much as to the musicians. Q. Let's talk about the bohemian father in the book, the beat poet. Is that your own dadY A. He's a conglomerate. His attitude is that of many fathers I've known including my own. He's someone obviously un- comfortable with his own children, with being a father. He's never really developed in the role of father-,. He covers it by being excessively gruff. And just because this guy is a beat poet, he's not immune from becoming a middle-aged man. Q. How do your characters feel about growing up? A. The kids range in age from about 18 to 22. They feel cautious, not scared of growing up, but not anxious to do it. They . want to do it differently. That's a theme of the book. Q. Do you feel you're growing up differently. . A. The basic way that I'm different from my parents and my older brother is that the emphasis of my life has not ·been on jobs, on family, on independence. It's the family thing that's being overturned. You feel that family is the group you're thrown in with by a toss of fate, purely by chance. Q. What about jobs? A. For the characters ih my book, jobs are purely financial support. They're cynical even about career goals. And the cynical view that there's something screwed up about everything traps them. Because they're going to need something to do. That becomes the final crisis of the book. You need something to do. They're not going to be assimilated into the functional world,. not unless they change their style and attitude about everything-- dress, appearance, language, method of inebriation. . . Q. Friendship is an important theme in your book. What does it mean to y1~ur people? A. The traditional values- family, marriage, security, having children, taking care of your parents when they're old, buying a house-they're gone. The only thing my characters are cruc_ially concerned about is taking care of each other. I don't think that it's really the \Me\ generation now. It's the \Us\ generation. A. I sometimes call them \younger brothers and sisters.\ They grew up after the sixties- when the sixties were fizzling out. The early seventies stamped a heavy dose of cynicism on them~ Qlder kids- my older brother, for example- were idealistic, wanting to .place their faith in something. But these younger kids olr served Vietnam and Watergate. Older kids were disappointed and disillusioned--ooh, the government cheats. But the post-sixties kids start from the Q. How much of you, (::aleb fact that the government Carr, is in the book? cheats. Of course. Everyone A. The situations are almost cheats. It's not that they want to purely - autobiographical-the be cynical. They're highly apartment~the parents, the careful. The seventies, in fact, work · the kids do.

What would you say are the their families were whole, they ·major artistic influences on were fairly noncommunicative. , your writing? This has a lot to do with a loss -of A. Gad I Well, in terms of sentiment, the pre-2oth Century authors. Dickens is the biggest influence on the way I treat my characters and on <how they treat each other. The only 2oth Century author with a profound effect on me was Hemingway. I feel that without him, nothing in 2oth Century literature would ·•e happened. He is a much \mpathetic and sensitive J\n than anyone gives him credit for today. Q. How long did writing CASING TilE PROMISED LAND take and what was your life like while you were doing it? A. It was especially hard because this was a time when I was e:l!:pected to be doing something substantial. I spent two years being . called a complete screw-of£ by my family. They came down on me like a ton of bricks. The nicest thing they could say was \Go see an analyst.\ But the sense of purpose was so strong that sitting down to write the book wasn't that hard. If there were others in the world who felt as I did then, I thought, they also felt isolated and lonely. And it was important for me to try to get in touch with these people and tell them they were not alone.

The oil and natural gas issues have been the big winiters and I am bullish on these issues. (In Wall Street usage, a bull is someone who thinks that the market is going_ to go up, and a bull market is an advancing market). } I .feel that selected oil issues are a good long term inflation hedge. In the coming years there will definitely be a worldwide scramble to secure all oil products and this will definitely continue throughout the 1980's. This scramble will cause the prices of crude oil and refined products to. rise at a much higher rate than inflation (which is now 13.3 percent). this price squeeze and will pay for it at the gas pwnps. The stock market in general will probably continue to rise unless it is faced with continuing political interruptions from the Middle East. The Saudis are now pringing in almost 10 million barrels of oil a day into the market. If there is any in- terruption with the oil flow from the Mideast it will in turn affect both the market and the economic scene in general. Continued from pag~ 1 situation becomes much more complex.\ There are many reasons for a student to have to come before the Student Standing Com- mittee, but Prof. Sowa feels that, \Most students do not succeed at Union because of a personal problem.\ These personal problems can manifest themselves in many ways. Sometimes family pressure is a causal factor, sometimes even being homesick can contribute to the problem. The Committee stresses the fact that a drop is not a punitive action because !he time off afforded by the drop 1s, as student Committee member Dave Seigel put it, \sometimes just what the student needs to get his act together.\ There may be other in- fluencing factors contributing to a student's lack of success at Union. There is the possibility that there was a judgemental error on the 'part of the Admissions staff and that the student simply does not belong at Union in the first place. Another situation that often arises is that the student will do well in certain courses, but will choose a major that does not suit his or her particular talents. A contributing factor in whether a student is going to be dropped or not is if the student will be able to meet the· minimum requirements for graduation. An overall cwnulative index of 1.8 along with a 2.0 in the major, plus thirty-six course credits, must be achieved to graduate. If the Committee sees that a student. does not have enough credits or a high enough cum. to meet those requirements by the time of graduation, the Committee will probably decide to drop the student. In contras(a freshman having difficulty will receive different consideration and probably be allowed a short period for adjustment. If a student petitions and is allowed to return to Union after being dropped, by achieving two satisfactory terms (with a cwn. above 2.0), the student can then begin with a \clean slate.\ Despite the fact that the Committee continues to run smoothly, members have been evaluating their Committee in an attempt to make all of their critt!ria more clearly un- derstood by the Union com- munity. Prof. Sow a has con- tacted other schools, both similar and dissimilar to Union, in an attempt to discover ways of improving the· Committee. One idea that received Committee support Recycling Program Union College will kick off the Spring 1980 ~iller Campus Reclamation Program on February 21. Sponsored by the Miller Brewing Company and DeCrescente Distributing of Mechanicville, NY, the Reclamation program is designed to encourage students to help clean up their en- vironment. Prizes are awarded based on the total points for bottles and cans collected by campus groups. Last Spring, Union ranked 4th\ among approximately 100 colleges and universities participating in the program collecting over 5,000 points. This was quite an accomplishment considering it was the first time Union participated in the program. Nine fraternities participated last Spring and prize money \' totalling nearly $1,800 was awarded to the six earning the most points. This past fall there were four winners- $125 each to Sigma Delta Tau, Delta Upsilon, Phi Delta Thetea and Theta Delta Chi. The theme of this year's Miller program is \Turn yotll! . cans and bottles into medals. A portion of the money collected by distributors nationwide for reclamation of beverage con- tainers will be donated to one of the four U.S. National Sports teams sponsored by Miller-the U.S. Boxing team, the U.S. Cycling team, the U.S. Ski team · and the U.S. Track and Field Team. Any.· recognized campus group is eligible ·to compete. Competition will be held in two divisions-fraternity and open (sororities, clubs dorms, etc.) The group earning the highest number of points in each division will win the grand prize. Second and third place prizes will also be awarded to the organizations with the next highest point totals, regardless of division. Six prizes in all will be awarded this Spring. Points are awarded based on points of bottles and cans collected. Five points are awarded for each pound of cans (approximately 24-12 ounce cans.) Groups interested in par- ticipating in this program should contact Bill Meehan at 370-6575 or 382-8663 as soon as possible .. was for the formation of the position of \Dean of Probation.\ They propose that each division of the school have a Dean (who has been granted release time to fulfill this duty) who could serve as a link bet- · ween students and the Com- mittee. The \Dean of Probation\ could counsel the student in the student's area of difficulty prior to possibly facing a decision to drop the student. In this way, the Dean and the student would in- vestigate a problem at the · Academic-or Special Academic Warning stage. In another attempt to im- prove the Committee, Prof. Sowa has begun compiling statistical data that the Com- mittee can call upon in making their decisions. These statistics might, for example, consist of a report on the percentage of students who were able to overcome three failed courses in their freshman year. Prof. Sowa said, \While these statistics would not be used as definitive criteria for making a decision, they could either support or refute 'gut feelings' in the Committee and possibly bring about a re-review of a case.\ Both Prof. • Sowa and Dave Seigel of the ·committee feel that feedback from ,Students who have come in contact with the Committee has been helpful. By proposing certain changes, Prof. Sowa and his Committee feel that they will be able to function at an even higher calibre than at present. Above all, they feel that students should understand the Com- mittee so that a student will let someone know if they're having problems before then end up down the tube. The oil industry in general will thrive from this en- vironment. The only drawback would be the windfall profits tax which could possibly hurt the earnings of many of the bigger companies. The stocks on my \buy\ list include Standard Oil of Ohio, Superior Oil, Gulf Oil, Exxon, Mobil, Texaco, Stan- dard Oil of Calif., Belco Pet., Central Louisiana Energy, and Standard Oil of Indiana. The issues I have listed abeve seem to be very attractive cor- nerstones for investors in need of a long term capital buildup aiming towards a diversified portfolio. There are many big name market observers who feel that the oil group has already posted big gains and investors should proceed with caution con- cerning the purchasing of these stocks. I am mainly predicting issues which are well managed and have better than average positions in coal, gas, offshore drilling, and oil well services. The near term prospect for the oil gr.oup as a whole looks tremendous and I am per- sonally looking for the oil sector to show an 18 percent profit jump overall in 1980 as com- pared to 1979. The world price of oil will continue to take its upward course during the sear. Americans in general will feel On Wall Street, investors sunk their teeth into the natural resource stocks. There were constant rumors all week from Canada to the Rockies of new oil and gas finds. These reports sent most of the oil and natural gas issues climbing to new peaks during a bullish trading week. I would like to talk a little about the infamous stockbroker (the so-called two dollar broker) .. The stockbroker, or as they wish to be called,· account executives, received the name of two dollar broker back in the days when that was the exact fee they received for every transaction they carried out. I can personally say that I have never seen a two dollar tran- saction and if I did I just may become faint. The account executive works on a sliding scale by either receiving a commission or working at a certain salary level. The majority of stockbrokers are working for a commission and the more trades they transact the more money they make. It is my personal view that the· broker in essence knows no more than the average investor. I agree, that there are some brokerswho are up on the latest information and material but there also are a good number of brokers who just take orders to buy and sell securities. 'fhe price of buying and selling securities varies tremendously from company to company.

The office of Chair- person was won by Karen Weisgerber, co-chairperson by Dedee Fischer, Secretary by Laurie ·M.intz and treasurer by Sharon Moss. Congratulations to these dedicated, interested, and interesting people, who have already started activities rolling within the Network. Recently, for example, a brunch was held in Strauss Lounge with Sargeant Chad- wick, of Campus Security, and on February 10 a speaker from the Rape Crisis Center of Schenectady came to inform and enlighten Union students. In other areas, committees are coordinating activities .for ··Women's Week, which will be held in the Spring. Also, a newly formed information committee is gathering information (logically) abo1,1t activities and events of particular interest to women, g~ing on in the city of Schenectady. The Network is rapidly becoming a ver:y active organization, and it has been expressed by the new officers that they would like everyone on campus to at least know what the Network is · up to and hopefully play some part in an activity, or attend an in- formative brunch. So look into the Network in the next couple of months, or vi~it the Women's Center on Second Floor Car- negie there may be something of interest going on .for you!

Her name is Susan Lasker and her title is Nurse Practitioner. Susan is a highly qualified in- dividual who is sensitive to the health needs of Union College students. She graduated from the University of Connecticut with a B.S. and then acquired an M.S. in Health Education at Russell Sage. She then proceeded to receive her title of Primary Care. Nurse Prac- titioner at Albany Medical School. Susan specialized in Pediatrics,· Gynecology; Adult Medical Care and Obstetics. My examination with Susan proved to be most educational. She not only· gave me a very thorough gynocological . exam but she also taught me how to examine myself and be more aware of my body. Susan ex- plained every procedure to me, which made for a most com- fortable environment. She also e~plained to me every test and its purpose. As I stated above Susan is a sensitive medical person and her talents extend beyond the \everyday\ routine medical needs, for she is highly educated in the field of health counselin~. She is also aware of the important needs many women have concerning adequate birth control methods. It should also be mentioned that Susan is aware of the concern many people have about venereal diseases and the treatment they require. Due to recent investigations by the Union College health_Service, the center will now offer free testing for venereal diseases. This is a state funded benefit and has never been offered at this college before. Susan's career consists of a fultime committment. Her hours are regular; she can be found at the College Health Center from 8:00 to 4:00, Monday - Friday. No ap- pointment is necessary. If you are concerned about your health status or you simply feel an examination is due, visit the Health Center. And if Susan cannot administer the proper treatment to you; she will refer you to other reliable area sources. , . . . .

Fund Drive Planned For Union Continued from page 1 campus was that of a quadrangle opened to the west- \the West where the new nation would. fulfill its_ destiny\ with ''the crowning point (being) a central pantheon and colon- nade.\ The campus of today is remarkably close to Ramee's original design with North and South Colleges remaining in their original positions and with the Social Science and Humanities Buildings being of the same design and connected by a circular arcade. The Ramee Campus is made Uf> of thirtet!n buildings: North and South Colleges being divided into seveJ;\al units. T}le buildings included are the President's Residence, Old Gym Hall, Nott Memorial, Memorial Chapel, Schaffer Library, Humanities, Social Sciences, North College (including Psychology Hall and the Arts Building), South College (including Old Chapel), and Andrew Carnegie Hall. Most of the buildings of the Ramee Campus were con- structed ·through the ~e of general College. funds and are maintained through these sam~ funds. A few were built and endowed. by individuals wi$hing to contribute to the College. The purpose of the Ramee Endowment Campaign, part of the general Campaign for Union, is to .find financial . support to maintain and endow those buildings· still supported by the general College funds. \In return for corrunitments to this program, the trustees would be pleased to name in- dividual structures for the benefactors or someone · they wish to honor. Such nf,lmed gift opportunities exist in a range from two hundted thousand to one million dollars.\ Those buildings thiit would not be renamed are Schaf~er Library, Nott Memoriai, and Carnegie Hall. It is believed that many people on campus would not be happy with the renaming of either. North or South Colleges (as they C!re the original buildings of tbe' campus) or Memorial Chapel (which was built by money raised by the Schen~ctady community in memory of students killed in WWI). .Already money in the six figure denommation has been given to endow Old Gym Hall, which will probably be renamed in the future. Money has also twen given to endow the Humarif'ties Building which will most li'k:ely be renamed this summer. The second major drive of the campaign is to endow the Science and Engineering Center. Here. again, there is the potential of renaming . various components of the center after benefactors. The Board of Trustees desires to have this center endowed in order to provide continued upkeep and care of the facilities provided by it. The third major drive of the campaign is to raise between eight and ten million dollars from the alumni. This drive will take the form of an \ad- vertising\ campaign .with both mass mailings and personal contacts. The money raised will be contributed to the Annual Fund which is used for the current operating costs of the CoUege. The Board of TrllStees also hopes to receive\ additional gifts to endow professorships and to endow scholarships. The endowment per student at Union C()llege ranks fairly low in comparison to the en- dowment per student of those college's of Union's caliber. For example, during the rvn~78 year, Amherst had a $47,000 endowment per student as compared to Union's $15,000.

But attendance at these events is poor becaus¢ I like tbe idea of- ten week terms, but too much is being crammed into those weeks. If what is being taught now is the minimum necessary knowledge that a student should have in each course, then the terms should be extended without additional course wo1·k. lf we 1 re being taught more, however, then the course load should be cut back (to the minimum, if necessary} in . order to give the students more time to relax and absorb what they've been learning. The artide mentions that \the evening students were · more dedicated and en· thusiastic than many under- grads were. u This is because many of the evening students are there because they want to be there. While under .. grads also want to learn, there is the underlying feeling that they must learn. For students this is their job. The evening students probably show as little en- thusiasm at their jobs as under· grads show in their classes. U nder .. grads are just as' dedicated; . there's · just a n·egative atmosphere surrounding their courses. . This extra freedom from course work would alleviate if · not eliminate, many of the other prublems brought up in the Middle States review. The campus spirit would pick up {first it~ has to be found, but that's another story) and minority, r~al and commuting students would be incorporated into student life. , . As for the problem with· ·n{)using, Union has to decide 'f!hether they should build or acquire more dormitories or cut back on the number of students they admit. The problem could solve itself, however; since as the review says, there'll be fewer college age studtmts in the OO's.

CONCORJ;)lf!JNSISJ Feb'I'1Ulry 14,_ 1980 Page 15 eporte .. A View From The Stands by DOUG SILVERSTEIN The year is 1979.Yourteam is o.n the way to a World Series victory and you ate not even on ti:1e field to participate. Your batting average spanning the last two years is below .25(). Your highlight was in 1977 when you almost won the batting title with an average of .336. After the season, you reminisce aboat the year when in midseason you tore your ankle, disqualifying yourself for the batting crown. Well, the next two years were miserable, and despite club success,. your abilities were obviously waning. Don't fear, a stupid owner will bail you out and pay you 400,000 bucks a year and you will be rich. So what if you can't hit, so what if you run half as fast as you once did, so what if you're worth less than the 30,000 buck earning rookie, you're Rennie Stennett and you're going to be a millionaire. You are the lucky recipient of a 1980 contract from Robert Lurie, owner of the San Francisco Giants. Yes, the one who dealt away second baseman Bill Madlock, and then realized he had no others. And so it goes on . . . This whole free agent bonanza commenced in the early seventies when bave McNally refused to sign with his new club Montreal, and Andy Messersmith decided that Atlanta would be a nicer place of residence than Los Angeles .. What ensued? McNally retired and Messersmith became one of the biggest dissapointments in baseball. To this day, he earns 200,000 big ones a year, for who else than Los Angeles. But what was the momentous result of their declaration of free agency was a trend that seems to un- derlie th~ true Ldeal's of baseball. The players claim that the owners .have too much control over them, which was true, but this has turned around and given the players un- precedented, and truly unhealthy control over the owners. Catfish Hunter decided to join the show and signed a spec- tacular five year contract with the Yankees. But pitchers were not the only winners .of these lucrative contracts. Later on, Garry Matthews, Reggie Jackson, Dave Cash, Larry Hisle, Sal Bando, Rod Carew, Dave Kingman, Pete Rose and others would sign. And I'll bet you forgot about these guys; Gene Tenace, Don Gullett, Rawley Eastwick, Joe Rudi, Doc Medich, Bert Campaneris and Ron Bloomberg. But the two who pulled off the best deals were Oscar Gamble and Wayne Garland. Garland won twenty games in 1976, and was truly a remarkabel story. The Indians signed him to a long term contract worth more than 200,000 dollars a. term. During his first year with the Tribe he was 13~19 with an earned .run average. of close to 4.00.. ThE! second year he injured his shoulder, and last year failed to win ten games. And Gamble, what a name for him. He hit 31 homers in tiny Comiskey Park for the White Sox, and lured Ray Kroc of San Diego to sign him for almost 3,000,000. The next year he bit seven homers and was traded away. Just a little history. Naturally, you're going to hear my opinion. I honestly feel that although the topic of free agency makes for an exciting line .Qf discussion (for has?ball fans, that is) the system has helped to deteriorate the game. It's not that I don't support .freedom for the players, but I cannot advocate the price war that exists. The real problem lies in the hands of the owners, who refuse to resist temptation and hastily sign free agents. The results are increasing ticket prices and :what was once a cheap commodity has become the rich man's dream. The owners have lost control over a sport which will ultimately evolve into a strict business masquerading as baseball. Yes, Babe Ruth earned 10,000 a year for the Yanks in the late twenties and early thirties, and proportionally that is equal to today's figures. But he was the only one. And he pitched and he set records. Inflation is a eon tributer, but the free agency parade will undercut the true ideals and traditions of baseball. And eventually, this system wm be detrimental to the players and the fans, too. Last year, George Stein- brenner, owner of the New York Yankees traded away Mickey River-s and voiced a dedication to working within the fann system. So what did he do? He signed 34 year-old pitcher Rudy May, and traded youngsters· Paul Mirabella, Jerry Narron, Jim Anderson and others. These players will receive ample opportunities to play for their new teams, but like all players who are drafted by the Yankees, they had a dream to play and star for the Bronx Bombers. They were grinded through a farm system which only had intentions to trade these unsung and unheralded players away for proven veterans. The result is that the farm. systems have lost their credibility bec~e instead of bringing a player along slowly through the system, they can simply buy proven stars. Just as players have an obligation to be loyal and hard working for the system, the system must return confidence and stability to the greenhorn rookies who are developing. The other problem is that the system simply skyrockets and perpetuates its own problems. For example, when the Cin- cinnati Reds signed George Foster to a lucrative long term contract, Pete Rose claimed that he should be the highest paid player on the team because he was the best player in the game· and he deserved to be paid accordingly. What will stop players like Fred Lynn, Jim Rice and Carl Yastremski of Boston from making similar claims? When players see others makirig the big bucks, they and their insatiable egos desire to be the highest paid. This was the terminology used by the lawyers of Rose, Ryan and Gossage. The only solution is to field a team of no-names and lose consistently. The Mets have that achievement under their belts. '!'he most logical argument against signing free agents is looking at the successful teams in..tbe past decade. Of the ten World Series winners, only two years did a team that em- phasizes the free agent route win the crown, That was in 1977 and 1978 when the Yankees were the talk of the town. But the true catalysts for that team were Rivers, Nettles, White and the late Thurmon Munson, all brought up through the fann system or acquired through clever trades. So if success is not the guaranteed ends, what is it? Attendance figures rise with winning records, and according to Atlanta, Cleveland and San Diego, not with big name players. Some will argue against the concept of free agency but also realistically say that it cannot be eliminated; a passivist at- titude indeed. The problem is not only in the owners hands, but in those of the league. Baseball is the only sport in which there is not enough of a compensation to deter the signing of these players. Oakland lost Hunter. Rudi, Bando, Tenace, Campaneris, Jackson, and others and were offered little or no com- pensation. The Reds lost Pete Rose, their most valuable and popular player, and were of- fered nothing from the Phillie_s in return. As in other sports, if compensation was offered, it would pose a threat to the owners and would hamper the monotonous spending. The players would still receive big enough contracts to fill the big spaces in their garages with Rolls Royces. In conclusion, it's not that I'm not for the players earning their deserved pay, but arbitration is a legal and sensible manner by which a player can make his argument. In the long run, as' has been proven in the past, the teams that build through the farm system and develop a sense of trust and loyalty within the system will be the cham- pions at the seasons end. ~··~·Co-Athletes Of The Week In a week of outstanding performances co-winners have been chosen for the coveted Miller ''Athlete of the Week Award.\ Freshman Joe Clinton, a member of the Varsity Basketball team, and senior Sandi Key, a member of the Women's Varsity Basketball team are co-recipients of the award. Joe Clinton, hailing from Pearl River, NY, has been doing an outstanding job for Bill Scanlin's basketball team this year. The rookie has stepped into the starting line-up this year with the poise of a eager veteran. The diminuti11e guard >- is a joy to watch as he wheels, ~ deals and handles the ball with g amazing ease. On numerous u occasions coach Bill Scanlon E has called upon Clinton to guard ~ the opposing team's high scor'Cr ~ as he is an intelligent .defensive player. -5 This past week Joe Clinton a was selected Division III ECAC Rookie of the Week.\ The ECAC Division Ill is represented by Frosh Joe Cl.intorl 122 colleges. Joe earned the honors for solid performances in Union's 91-78 upset win over Hamilton and an 85·70 defeat against Albany State. Against Hamilton, the 5 foot 8 inch guard hit 9 .of 16 field goal at- tempts, 7 of 9 free throws, handed out a team leading 6 assists, pulled in 4 reborutds and totaled 25 points. In the Albany State game, Clinton tallied 22 points on 7 for 15 shooting from ,the line. He once again hauled in four rebounds and led tbe team with four assists. Sandi Key, a biol()gy major, is the center on the Women's basketball team. Standing 6 foot 1 inch Sandi has been an imposing force for the Dutchmen in her four years of varsity basketball. The lanky center has been a consistent performer and a hard worker during her college career . .She has intimidated many opposing shooters and been a solid rebounder for the Garnet. Sandi is currently enjoying her finest season in this, ner final year. She is currently .... :. >- .a \ 0 0 a :,·.·:. - itWW>' --- • - ·~.- Senior Sandi Key averaging 10.3 rebounds and 10.:2 points per game. She has already topped her season high in rebounds and points in Union's first nine games. Key's shooting percentage from the floor this year is also a personal .high. Sandi has just enjoyed the best week of her career. She was outstanding in Union's three games. The senior scored 37 points and amassed · an amazing 54 rebounds including a phenomenal 30 against Division II LeMoyne. Her 15 points and 30 rebounds against LeMoyne was almost enough to help Union upset the Division II powerhouse, which is now holding an 11-4 record.

Last year, George Stein- brenner, owner of the New York Yankees traded away Mickey Rivers and voiced a dedication to working within the farm system. So what did he do'? He signed 34 year-old pitcher Rudy May, and traded youngsters· Paul Mirabella, Jerry Narron, Jim Anderson and others. These players wiH receive ample opportunities to play for their new teams, but like all players who are drafted by the Yankees, they had a dream to play and star for the Bronx Bombers. They were grinded through a farm system which only had intentions to trade these unsung and unheralded players aw~y for proven veterans. The result is that the farm systems b.ave lost their credibility bec~e instead of bringing a player along slowly through the system, they can simply buy proven stars. Just as players have an obligation to be loyal and bard: working for the system, the system must return confidenee and stability to the greenhern rookies who are developing. The other problem is that the system simply skyrockets and perpetuates its own problems. For example, when the Cin- cinnati Reds signed George Foster to a lucrative long term contract, Pete Rose claimed that he should be the highest paid player en th eteam because he was the l>est player in. the game and he deserved to be paid accordingly. What will stop players Hke Fred Lynn, Jim Rice and Carl Yastremski of Boston from making simi:J.ar claims? When pJ1ayers see others making the big bucks, they and their insatiable egos desire to be the highest paid. This was the terminology used by the lawyers of Rose, Ryan and Gossage. 'lbe only solution is to field a team of no-names and lose consistently. The Mets have that achievement under their belts. The most logical argwnent against signing free agents is looking at the successful teams in the past decade. Of the ten World Series winners, only two years did a team that em· phasizes the tree agent route win the crown. That was in 1977 and 1978 when the Yankees were the talk of the town. But the true catalysts for that team were Rivers, Nettles, White and the late Thurmon Munson, all brought u~ through the farnn system or acquired through clever trades. So if success is not the guaranteed ends, what is tt? Attendance figures rise with winning records, and according to Atlanta, Cleveland and San Diego, not with big name players. Some will argue against the concept of free agency but also realistically say that it cannot be elin:linated; a passivist at- titude indeed. The problem is net only in the owners hands, but in those of the league. Baseball is the only sport in which there is not enough of a cGmpensation to deter the signing of these players. Oakland lost Hunter, Rudi, Bando, Tenace, Campaneris, Jackson, and others and were offered little or no coma pensation. The Reds lost Pete RGse, their most valuable and popular player, and were of- fered nothing from the Phillies in return. As in other sports, if compensation was offered, it would pose a threat to the owners and would hamper the monotonous spending. The players would still receive big enough contracts to fill the big spaces in their garages with Rolls Royces. In conclusion, it's not that I'm not for the players earning their deserved pay, b11t arbitration is a legal and sensible manner by which a player can make his argument. In the long run, as' has been proven in the past, the teams that build through the farm system and develop a sense of trust and loyalty within the system will be the cham- pions at the seasons end. ~.fco-Athl.etes Of The Week In a week of outstanding performances co-winners have been chosen for the coveted Miller \Athlete of the Week Award.'' Freshman Joe Clinton, a member of the Varsity Basketball team, and senior Sandi Key, a member of the Women's Varsity Basketball team are co-recipients of the award. Joe Clinton, hailing from Pearl River. NY, has been doing an outstanding job for Bill Scanlin's basketball team this year. The rookie has stepped into the starting line-up this year with the poise of a eager veteran. The diminuti't'e guard > is a joy to watch as he wheels, ~ deals and handles the ball with § amazing ease. On numerous u occasions coach Bill Scanlon E has called upon Clinton to guard ~ the opposing team's high scorer ~ as he is an intelligent defensive 0 player. o This past week Joe Clinton -& was selected Division III ECAC Rookie ofthe Week.\ The ECAC Division III is represented by Frosh Joe Clinton 122 colleges. Joe earned the honors for solid performances in Union's 91-78 upset win over Hamilton and an 85-70 defeat against Albany State. Against Hamilton, the 5 foot 8 inch guard hit 9 of 16 field goal at- tempts, 7 of 9 free throws, handed out a team leading 6 assists, pulled in 4 rebounds and totaled 25 points. In the Albany State game, Clinton tallied 22 points on 7 for 15 shooting from the line. He once again hauled in four rebounds and led the team with four assists. Sandi Key, a biology major, is the center on the Women's basketball team. Standing 6 foot 1 inch Sandi has been an imposing force for the Dutchmen in her four years of varsity basketball. The lanky center has been a consistent performer and a hard worker during her college career. She has intimidated many opposing shooters and been a solid rebounder for the Garnet. Sandi is currently enjoying her finest season in this, her final year. She is C1ll'rently - .s:: Cl 'i: ~ ... C1l 0.. £ 0 0 .s:: c. • Senior Sandi Key averaging 10.:3 rebounds and 10.2 points per game. She has already topped her season high in rebounds and points in Union's first nine games. Key's shooting percentage from the floor this year is also a personal high. Sandi has just enjoyed the best week of her career. She was outstanding in Union's three games. The senior scored 37 points and amassed an amazing 54 rebounds including a phenomenal 30 against Division ll LeMoyne. Her 15 points and 30 rebounds against LeMoyne was almost enough to help Union upset the Division II powerhouse, which is now holding an 11-4 record.

Pag~ 16 OONOORDIENSIS, February 14,_ 1980 sports ... Skaters Split Two by MATT T. KAYNE and RICH DECKER After an impressive week in playing stl;'ongly against both second ranked contenders in tile two wings of Division II, tile Skating Dutchmen settled this week for two relatively lackluster performances. On Tuesday night, Feb. 5, the Garnet pulled out of .sluggish early game play in eventually defeating overmatched Brock- port State, 7-3, and went on to Hamilton, N.Y., only to be dropped 11-3 by powerhouse Division I Colgate. The Garnet is still sitting in 9th place in Division II West with an overall log of 8-13-1. With the season whittled dovm to only a few weeks and eighth place only a notch away, the Dutchmen seem to be sitting pretty for a berth in post-season play. That's not to say that the next few weeks offer an easy schedule, however. Union faces the likes of Williams, Merrimack, and New Haven amongst others in the not too distant future. Garnet over Brockport, 7·3 In what was close to being one of their worst performances of this season, the Skating Dut- chmen pul,le<,i through in the final moments to overpower a weak Brockport State team, 7 -3 .. The meager mid~ week crowd of 900 had little to cheer about for the first 50 minutes of the game, but with less than 10 minutes to go, the Garnet brought the crowd quickly and continuously to it's feet as they bombarded goalie Ron Cappellazo in the final10 minutes to score 4 goals. Brockport State, 2-6 in Division II play, seemed to have hypnotized Union- down to it's lowly level of play. The Golden Eagles are 8-7 overall with all but one of their wins in Division III. Most of the game was blemished by icing, offside, and penalty calls, as well as sloopy and sluggish skating. At the end of one period the game was tied at 2-2. Union scored first just less than two minutes into the contest. on a goal by scoring leader, Bill Mason, his 11th, on a pretty set- up by Captain Mark Haley. Brockport then come right back as left-winger Bill Zeigler put one by Dave Josephson, who sported a 4.03 goals against average coming into the con- test. The final moments of the period finished Up with each team scoring another . goal. Mickey Perras, a freshman forward whose presence on the ice has been felt strongly in Unions ,6-3 streak since early January, tallied for Union with help from Todd Fobare and Sparky Anderson. Yet, due to sluggish Garnet play, Brock- port tiedthe game once more as Mark Bender split through Josephson's pads from Peck and Wood. The go,.ahead goal was scored in the 2nd period when Bill Mason tallied for his second of the night on a pretty pass from Jim Burns. Burns, skating down the left side, dropped a pass off to Mason who drilled it home. Once again, however, amidst drowsy Garnet play, Brockport tied ttie game at three in the opening minute of the· period, the goal was scored on a two on one break from Rob Newvine to John Harrington. Midway through the third period the. Garnet woke up. Piercing down the left side, Dave Ferguson wheeled from a clearing pass with a slap-shot and Mickey Perras was there to deflect the puck home. Only 35 seconds later Sparky Anderson sent Cappellazo reeling with a blistering slapper just inside the near post. Union tallied twice more in the game with the first of these coming off the stick of Mark Bon on a sheer muscle goaL Muscling his way in, Bon chased down on his own rebound and slithered a tough- angle wrist shot from the right side. Sparky Anderson then scored his second of the year unassisted as he worked for a shot on net and let goalie Cappellazo do the rest. Calling it \a game I'm glad we got out .of our system,\ Coach Charlie Morrison seemed pleased over the win, nonetheless. Though Union had not played very impressively most of tile night, the final 8: 16 of the game saw the Garnet score 4 overpowering goals and brilliantly control play. In the game, Bill Mason, Mickey Perras, and Sparky Anderson all tallied twice. Dave Josephson lowered his goals against average to below 4.00 for the first time in 4 years as he stopped 39 Brockport shots. Colgate trounces Garnet, 11-3 Travelling to cold western New York state wasn't exactly a heart-warming experience for Union as they were smothered by Division I contender Colgate, 11-3.

Playing for only tl;le 2nd game since early January, Mike Merlo with a 4.69 goals against average was in goal for Union. Possibly a bit stale, along with very little support from the rest of his team, Merlo let in 4 Colgate goals in the opening moments until Bill Wall dri:lled one home unassisted. Outskating Union, Colgate powered for another tally before the end of the first, on their way to a night in which they would nave a miraculous 61 shots on net ..

The remainder of the game was all Colgate as the later took . control with three final period tallies to win, 11-3. The Red Raiders, who outshot Union 61- 25, were never once in doubt of winning the game. In a rare exhibition game on Sunday, the Garnet welcomed the Olympic-bound Polish Olympic Ice Hockey Team to Achilles Rink and lost a lop- sided 9-1 decision in doing so. Star forward Andrej Zabawa scored four times in the contest, twice each against Dave Josephson and Mike Merlo, both of whom played for an equal half of the game. Union's lone goal was an unassisted tally by Mark Bon, who caught goalie Henryk Wojtynek off-balance and out of the net. Playing in the contest was international star Jersy Potz who has completed in 145 championship games for his country. Union played Williams this past Tuesday night and faces perrenial power Merrimack tomorrow night, both away games. The Garnet returns home for it's last three home games of the regular season, facing off against Potsdam, Westfield and New Haven. Tickets are available for these 3 remaining games at the Achilles Rink- Box Office. Ski.ers Qualify by FRANZ The Union Ski Team reigned supreme in last week's ski meet hosted by Alfred university at Mystic Mountain. Union, competing against fifteen teams, ran away with the alpine combined with a first place in both slalom and giant slalom and won a third place overall trophy for the meet with cross- country and alpine combined. In giant slalom, Fre~. Th~. racing ott BliZzard Skns, agam placed first in a field_ of 75 racers, with a combined two heat time of 55.48; a full second ahead of the nearest com- petitor. Torn Sargent, racing on Rossignols, placed fourth; Jeff Ince racing on K2's, placed elev~nth and Brian Walt~r and Brad Kline, both on Blizz~rds, placed 21st and 25th respec- tively. In slalom, Thimm, Sarg~nt and Ince with a strong showing; placed 3rd, 5th and 8th respectively, giving Union a first place finish hand's down. In addition, Walter placed 13th and Rich Pryszinda placed 29th giving Union five skiers in the top 30. In the 15 kilometer cross- country race on Saturday . at Syracuse University, Ed Hortsmann lead the team in 30th place followed by Brian Walter in 33rd place and Colleen Morris, who_ placed 35th in a field of 65 competitors. This meet was the final meet of a series which qualifies five teams for the Division II East- West Championship which will be held at Lyndon (Vermont) State College. Union's strong showing last week brought them up to fifth place behind Cornell, West Point, Clarkson and Co-lgate, therefore qualifying them for the Division II Championships. They will be skti1;1g · against fiv-e New England schools along with the four above., Hoopers Look To Go Over .500 The Union hoopers cruised to a 91-74 victory over Hamilton February 6 at the Memorial Fieltl house. The sharp shooting of Joe Cardany and freshman Joe Clinton, who combined for 52 points, enabled Union to gain offensive mqmentum after a slow start. The Dutchmen lead by as much as 25 points with six minutes left in the game. This marked the first time in 3 years -Union has beaten Haxniltol}., • Other bright spots included the offensive thrust by Joe Rudnick 6 for 7 from the field and scored 14 points in 18 mjnutes of play before he. was sidelined with a sprained, ankle. John \the Count\ Montanile added 12 po-ints and grabbed ten rebounds.

DRAFT REGISTRATION: The headline boldly printed across the front page of the New York Times January 24th, 1980, issue has raised questions and con- troversy on college campuses throughout the country. How has President Carter's decision to ''use any means necessary, including force\ to protect the Persian Gulf region affected Union College students? In a recent survey conducted by Concordy, students were asked to respond to a number of questions con- cerning the draft. A majority of students both male and female are in favor of registering for the draft, believing tnat \it is a. necessary precaution for the United States.\ As a result, the popular sentiment among UColl students is that they would go to war rather than flee the country. As to whether college students should receive deferments, a narrow majority of students stood in opposition to this proposal. \During Viet- nam, people used 'student' status to avoid fighting, ef- fectively leaving most of the dirty work to the less wealthy and-or intelligent. How fair is that?\ A differing viewpoint reasoned that students should receive deferments \because it is difficult to continue one's education after an interruption as traumatic as war.\ In f1·ank terms, the following comment represents a frequently encountered view concerning the draft: uin many ways, I feel that if the draft was reinstated, it wo-uld bring us one step closer to war which should be avoided at all costs. But the main reason that I am forthe draft is to show the Russians that we mean business. The draft is only worth having if we honestly plan to go to war and beat the hell out of the Russians. The next war really won't be of men anyway. It will be just a few .people pushing buttons and destroying major parts of the Earth. It ·won't make mu.ch difference, we will all die too quickly to care a bout the draft.\ There wre a whole range of additional comments: \The cruise missiles better work.\ \Right now I feel we would be going to war for Carter's political gains, and I do not want to die so that he can get more votes in Iowa.\ · \I wish I had an alternative!\ ''I hate kids who say they are going to Canada.\ \Instate a unilateral one year Continued on page 3 t .

Page 2 OON008DIENSIS, February S;J., 1980 Editorial Changes Yes, changes have begun on campus, but where is the follow-through? Probably the most noticeable change occurred on Friday night when winter finally arrived in Schenectady. With this came another welcomed change: in contrast to past y~ars' reports of excessive ice and snow covering the walks, students awoke on ~turday to find that maintenance had efficiently cleared the roads 'and sidewalks throughout campus. Thank-you maintenance staff, and please--keep it up! It may seem strange that we would make such a plea this early in the snow season, but we, along with- the sttaffs of Union Book .and Freshman Record, have reasons for our doubts. Most of our skepticism evolves from the planned renovations of the darkroom in Carnegie. Despite promises that the room would be completed within five days, it has now been drawn well into the fifth week and still little work seems to have been accomplished. It was a shame that it took so long for these changes to begin, but such unnecessary delays cause in themselves even greater problems and have resulted in many complications. For instance, not only have materials been lost, but also damaged (an $800 piece of equipment is now unusable! ). Also, our staffs, being forced to use the Art Department's darkroom, in· terfere with students fulfilling class requirements. The enthusiasm with which we first responded to the darkroom renovations was obviously premature. How long will we have to wait before we can justify it? Unfortunately, the maintenance staff is not the only faction on campus whose ''gung-ho•• attitude quickly dies. The student committees also have fallen short of their own expectations. For instance (and not to at· tack anyone specifically), the Social Committee was very active in planning the Winter Carnival activities of the previous week. Where was the committee during the events? We don't recall seeing the entire committee at any one of the events and truly we think we were lucky if even more than one or two members were present at any one event. Would not the campus be in a sorry state if this philosophy was upheld by everyone? Where would Union Book be if there was only pictures and no one to arrange them on the pages? J\nd how many student activities would progress beyond the planning stages without the dedicated, ongoing work of Lorraine Marra? The standards we are citing may be ··Somewhat difficult to uphold, but are essential to the success of our endeavors. Most of us present on campus are effective ~ proposing changes and yet, despite the benefit we could all gain through dedication to these goals, it in actuality amounts to a relative minority that executes the proposals. Why? Concert Contest The · Union College Concert Conunittee will be holding a contest in light of the upcoming Dave Mason concert. The contest will .entail responding, in 25 words or less, to the following question: \Why aren't you going to the Dave Mason - concert?\ Unfortunately, three- quarters (that's right-1500 U.C. students) of this campus will be eligible for the contest. Winners will receive the coveted \Apathetic Dutchman of the Year Award.'' Presentations of the award will take place at the Dave Mason concert-winners must aot be present. · Obviously we're (the Concert Committee, that is) joshing about the contest; un- fortunately, we're not ldddul'g ar~:nm~ with respect to the lack of student interest. We sincerelyj doubt that anyone could raise an argument in opposition to the performance on behalf of the Concert Committee this year.. · As well as providing three outstanding musical events in the faU (Joe Jackson, Karla Bonoff, and Spyrogyra), and a very humorous ''Night of Comedy,\ we have sponsored many of the bands that have been perfonning in the Pub (Nightshift, Charlie Smith Blues Band, etc.). The Dave Mason concert will not be an exception to the fine per· forrnances staged ~ year. • The announcement of the Dave Mason concert was initially met with overwhelming enthusiasm. From then on, the story remains a mystery to us (the Concert Committee). We feel that this is far and away our biggest production of the year and, as of yet, has evoked a minimal reaction from the student body. . As a guitarist, Dave Mason stands out in his class. One of the original members of Traffic, he has gone on to achieve national recognition. Having him perform in Schenectady for Union's benefit. createB a rare opportl.mity for each of us. The low price of the tickets is just another factot which adds to the attractiveness of this show. Furthermore, the recently renovated Proctors Theatre promises to be, if given the chance, an excellent home for future Uniori College con· certs. •· The bottom line: if the con- cert does not sell, there will not be funds to sponsor a Spring · Concert. Furthermore, if this is an indication of future response to Concert Committee events, there is no reason to even think in terms of a Spring Concert. ..

Page 2 OONOORDIENSIS, February !1_. 1980 Editorial Changes Yes, changes have begun on campus, but where is the follow-through? Probably the most noticeable change occurred on Friday night when winter finally arrived in Schenectady. With this came another welcomed change: in contrast to past years' reports of excessive ice and snow covering the walks, students awoke on ~turday to find that maintenance had efficiently cleared the roads •and sidewalks throughout campus. Thank-you maintenance staff, and please--keep it up! It may seem strange that we would make such a plea this early in the snow season, but we, along with the sttaffs of Union Book and Freshman Record, have reasons for our doubts. Most of our skepticism evolves from the planned renovations of the darkroom in Carnegie. Despite promises that the room would be completed within five days, it has now been drawn well into the fifth week and still little work seems to have been accomplished. It was a shame that it took so long for these changes to begin, but such unnecessary delays cause in themselves even greater problems and have resulted in many complications. For instance, not only have materials been lost, but also damaged (an $800 piece of equipment is now unusable! ) . Also, our staffs, being forced to use the Art Department's darkroom, in- terfere with students fulfilling class requirements. The enthusiasm with which we first responded to the darkroom renovations was obviously premature. How long will we have to wait before we can justify it? Unfortunately, the maintenance staff is not the only faction on campus whose \gung-ho'' attitude quickly dies. The student committees also have fallen short of their own expectations. For instance (and not to at- tack anyone specifically), the Social Committee was very active in planning the Winter Carnival activities of the previous week. Where was the committee during the events? We don't recall seeing the entire committee at any one of the events and truly we think we were lucky if even more than one or two members were present at 8..£'\1Y one event. Would not the campus be in a sorry state if this philosophy was upheld by everyone? Where would Union Book be if there was only pictures and no one to arrange them on the pages? And how many student activities would progress beyond the planning stages without the dedicated, ongoing work of Lorraine Marra? The standards we are citing may be somewhat difficult to uphold, but are essential to the success of our endeavors. Most of us present on campus are effective in proposing changes and yet, despite the benefit we could all gain through dedication to these goals, it in actuality amoWlts to a relative minority that executes the proposals. Why? Concert Contest The · Union College Concert Committee will be holding a contest in light of the upcoming Dave Mason concert. The contest will .entail responding, in 25 words or less, to the following question: \Why aren't you going to the Dave Mason concert?\ Unfortunately, three- quarters (that's right-1500 U.C. students) of this campus will be eligible for the contest. Winners will receive the coveted \Apathetic Dutchman of the Year Award.\ Presentations of the award will take place at the Dave Mason concert-winners must not be present. Obviously we're (the Concert Committee, that is) joshing about the contest; un- fortunately, we're not kidding around with respect to the lack of student interest. We sincerely) doubt that anyone could raise an argument in opposition to the performance on behaH of the Concert Committee this year. As well as providing three outstanding musical events in the fall (Joe Jackson, Karla Bonoff, and Spyrogyra), and a very humorous \Night of Comedy,\ we have sponsored many of the bands that have been performing in the Pub (Nightshift, Charlie Smith Blues Band, etc.). The Dave Mason concert will not be an exception to the fine per- formances staged this year. The announcement of the Dave Mason concert was initially met with overwhelming enthusiasm. From then on, the story remains a mystery to us (the Concert Committee). We feel that this is far and away our biggest production of the year and, as of yet, has evoked a minimal reaction from the student body. _ As a guitarist, Dave Mason stands out in his class. One of the original members of Traffic, he has gone on to achieve national recognition. Having him perform in Schenectady for Union's benefit creates a rare opportunity for each of us. The low price of the tickets is just another factor which adds to the attractiveness of this show. Furthermore, the recently renovated Proctors Theatre promises to be, if given the chance, an excellent home for future Union College con- certs. •· The bottom line: if the con- cert does not sell, there will not be funds to sponsor a Spring Concert. Furthermore, if this is an indication of future response to Concert Committee events, there is no reason to even think in terms of a Spring Concert. This is not an ultimatum; the Dave Mason concert has the potential to be one of Union's finest. We urge you not to miss it. -Letter Protest To Concerned Community Members: All members .of the Union College community should be outraged at the call for a reinstitution of draft registration. As the group of Americans most intimately affected, this soould be par# tieularly true ()f an students. There is somethlng almost humorous in being urged to · register on the basis that there won;t be a draft, Let us be realistic-what we are actually fadng is registration followed up by a draft. Military authorities are all in agreement, that it is not registratit>n. that is a bottleneck to our ability t() field an army. Registration requires only a couple of weeks at the most (look how quick a national vote taltes to be ta billa ted. The logistics ' are · somewhat similar.), whereas · classific?tion, conscription, and training are a matter of six months. Hence, a registration alone does nothing for our ·military posture (and so is not needed), but wou.ld necessarily require being followed up by a draft. A rational appraisal of the world situation shows that such a step of a call to arms is simply a political :fiction. What is it we would be defending: A standard of living, or rather, a living by consumption, that Is not shared by the rest of the western world, and one that we cannot main~ tain in any event; .governments ·which we w ou.ld ot~erwise abhor and which are politically bankrupt in their own coun- tries; nations just as an- tithetical to us and our interests as is Russia?Examples of these include the Ayatollah's splin- tering Iran. assorted warring regimes in the mideast such as Syria, lraq. and the Y emens, and General Zia's unpopular dictatorship in ·Pakistan {with his plans for developing nuclear weaponry). Are these causes you are willing. to die for? All we hav:e tod-0 is look at our own allies to put the \current\ threat in proper perspective. With the exceptic;m of England, the.y are all m{}re dependent on mi.deast oil, and aU have a greater stake In the areas of crisis than we do. Still, their response has been . far more cautious and considered than ours. Indeed, in most instances, they have specifically rejected our proposals~ And just what is it that has • happened? With much foreshadowing, Russia invaded what we had already ceded to . them as a puppet nation. Yes, we must take so.me action,. but let Uf) make it e-ffective action, coordinated with our allies, and union of s()me meaning. The rein- . stitution of the draft is not such an actiDn. Our own military)s scenario analysis projects that we ct>uld not prevent a Soviet attack into Asia or through the middle east. without using nuclear weapons. Although frought with foreign policy implications, what is being proposed is primarily a domestic political move. P()liticians of all parties and professed outlouks are jumping onto the bandwagon. The direction we are going in- only repeats our previous military foreign policy disaster from which~ even in purely pragmatic terms, we have yet to recover from in the in- ternational arena. The current jingoism is that of the Spanish~ American War and the fictional Gulf of Tonkin \crisis. H During this latter hysteria only two senators were able to resist being swept along-our country has paid for it ever since. We callup()n the community to do three things: First, talk openly and vocally about both . tne in- ternational and domestic events in yotlr everyday lives .. Regardless of your particular views this is the only way to avoid the hysteria. The social atmosph€re breeds war faster and more effectively than the actual events. Second, write to your legislators and to the presidential campaigners expressing your opposition. Third, as an expression of protest and unity, we call upon the conununity to join together in drmning white armbands on Monday,. February 25. White because it is not we who need to mourn nor weep ... yet! Finally, all people Interested in organizing further non- violent protest and teach-ins, pleas€ get in contat'!t with us.

Frey TimiBarber Connor Jane .O'Brien Snow Vandals To the Editors: Th:is past Tuesday, we two seniors worked on a snow sculpture for the Winter Car- nival judging. A number of friends helped us out with the heavy work, and we'd like to thank them for their time and efforts. Unfortunately, all our time and effort was tG no avail, since the 8-foot tall sculpture that we had created was smashed to bits by vandals, less ' than three hours after its completion. In fact, the van* dats• timing was so \perfect\ that our sculpture wasn't up long enough to be judged for the carnival. This aspect of the situation, though important, is not our major complaint. We are ap- palled by the lack of respect and consid~r~tion displayed by the person( s) who did this. And as food for tht>ught to the person{ s) who did this-did. you ever stop to put yourself in our place before you maliciously destroyed our sculpture? HDw would you feel if you spent hours creating a sculpture you really felt proud and happy about and then went back that night to admire it, only to find it destroyed! Maybe if you thought about the feelings of others before you acted, you would not have done What you did. Perhaps respect and consideration for others are concepts your brain never in- corporated; that's too bad. It's people like you who have added to the heartless, unfeeling at- titude so prevvalent in society today. This incident strikes us as just one more pitiful example of the general lack of respect on this carnpus toward anything that. isn't steel, concrete, or· bulletproof glass. We most certainly feel sorry for the intellects (Hah! ) that conceived and committed the destruction of our artwork, but more than that we pity the society that must suffer the vandatism that such a twisted mind wreaks.

As ~eniot ec.onomics major researching \Free Agency in Sports\ as a thesis topict I feel it is necessary tn correct some inaccuracies in the article '• A View From The Stands,\ arr pearing in the sports section of last week's C6ncordiensis. I believe the major point which Doug Silverstein is trying to make is that professional · athletics, in this case baseball, is evolving into Big Business, eventually destroying the sport as we chave klJWwn it over- the . years. He specifically cites the role of free agency in escalating th~ salary strueture within the sport, that will eventmllly result in higher ticket prices forfans. He further advooates the in\ stallation of a system of com\ pensation . in <»'der to deter owners front ,signing, players to such lucrative contracts. I would like tQ first point out that professional,atbletics is not evolving into Big Business. Rather, it already b; Big Business and ·bas been for quite S<~me time.

His feelings on the current military situation of the United States in many ways reflects the feelings of many of us. · His past. in- -volvement in the armed forces adds a different dimension to his feelings. Mr. Fuzia's ad-. ditional. comments on the survey questionnaire were as follows: \I was forced to join the serv,ice in 1972 as a result of the Vietnam War. Though my college career was interrupted, I do not in any way regret it. It amazes me that so many students and young people cry out for action in Iran yet are more than willing to let the other guy go. No one wants a war, but many desire to retain the freedoms they enjoy, as well as the stm1<iard of living they are accustomed to. Registration is a precautionary. and in some ways, a strategic measure. I can honestly appreciate the fact that many people do not wish to fight. There are some alter- natives, both civilian and military. It seems to me that many who oppose the draft (and it is only registration) would still be quite reluctant to have their lives interrupted by other courses of action, say VISTA or Peace Corps. Perhaps t am biased in my patriotic proclivities and military background. However, back in 1972, I did not wish to be draf- ted, but as things worked out, I had made the best out of the situation at hand. The complex world we live in demands sacrifice and I hope through peaceable means. Resisting the draft may protect one's little world from the sometimes harsh realities of life, but then the larger picture is somehow ignored and payment required at a later date.\ Editor's Note: The student responses here in no way reflect concrete statistical data.

Draft You by BRUCE KAPLAN I got invited recently to an anti-draft registration party. While smiling and trying to keep a clear head (the contact high was pretty potent), some persen wandered over wanting to talk about the movement. It was all so surrealistic. \Like hey, man,\ he said, \like I've been thinking about this since that Carter dude on the television talked about registration.\ Although he smelled like he hadn't bathed since the State of the Union speech, I smiled some more and nodded that I would listen to him. \It's like, man, you know, war sucks. I mean like you and me and everybody doesn't want to die in some place where they don't even speak our language. They might not even have Dead tapes, or disco tablets, man. Well, I'd go fight in Afghanistan, maybe man, hey we gotta save the black hash from the Russians. But, listen man, I'm a pacifist, like I studied Political Science in college, man, but like this is too much. I don't want to fight. Maybe I'll teach Political .Science. \Like this Carter dude, he - . \- .. -~ ,. y h ... ,\' • .,. ,..__.., ·- ·~- ,. ,. ... ,.. .,,_ ~ .... \'·t· ..... ~ .,. ., ._\ .... -j~ \\ ·~ • ... :. ~\~~.~Oit~-~~ 1>-•\' .... l' .,;, ~ .............. , -ibfii(I>JW.·' l ' • ·vf'_,...,._ ~,. -..... ..... -...~,. t>U}. isn't going to fight. And that little brat Amy with the buck teeth, she ain't even gonna be a poster girl man.

I get paranoid about being registered, so I'm deprived in the same way. Freaks me out, man. Wow, who would want to fight for a country anyway if they deprive you of your rights1 \I'm a pacifist. ~an, I think my brain has been mellowed by rock and disco. I mean, I get into fights at concerts when someone spills my pipe, or at the Studio when somebody spills a drink on my fashion jeans. But, I'm confortable, man, I don't want to sacrifice that. It's illegal to draft me, man. Just think of the commerce Ron Delsner, or the Studio would lose if I got drafted. Hey, I don't even want to pay income tax, I'd rather buy a Hendrix album, Dead, or a new pair of Steve Waldman Disco Jeans.

Hey, do you think we could organize big? Like rock bands, lots of noise, marches-hey, let's take over Dean Kellett's office, man. Let's take over on all the two- faced politicians. I don't want to go to war. I never voted. I don't believe in it at all.

Sincerely, A Little Sister Baseball To the Editors: As .q.,. senior economics major researching \Free Agency in Sports\ as a thesis h)pic, I feel it is necessary to correct some inaccuracies in the article \A · View From The Stands,\ ap- pearing in the sports section of last week's Concordiensis. I believe the major point . which Doug Silverstein is trying to make is that professional athletics, in this case baseball, is evolving into Big Business, eventually destroying the sport as we have known it over the years. He specifically cites the role of free agency in escalating the salary structure within the sport, that will eventually result in higher ticket prices for fans. He further advocates the in\ stallation of a system of com\ pensation in order to deter owners from signing players to such lucrative contracts. I would like to first point out that professional athletics is not ev.,Iving into Big Business. Rather, it already is Big Business and has ooen for quite some time. Ownership of a professional franchise is · generally a V!OlrY lucrative inM vestment, even for thos~ teams that don tt do well in the won-lost · column. No one is going·to buy a team for 10 million dollars (in the case of the Mets, $20 mlllion) -without having a good chance of making Mon¢y. Mnst · owners are successful businessmen and there is no reason to suspect that they're in sports for any other reason tban to make healthy protits. Mr. Silverstein is coneerned that \ . . . th~ free agency . ·parade will undercut the true ideals and traditions of baseball. And eventually, this system will be detrimental to the players and the fans, too. u What are the true ideals and traditions of baseball? S~rt .. smansbip? Team Spirit? ·Certainly these qualities aren't extinct. Look at Willie Stargell and the Pittsburgh Pirates! I suggest to Mr. Silverstein that he drop the idealistic bull and become concerned with the real reason poople pay money to see a game-the excitement of ~eeing closet high level com~ petition. Has free agency destroyed \eompetitive balance\ in baseball, as many · feared it would? In a report issued by the Major League Baseball Players Association, it is pointed out that at the end of tbe 1976 season, in 3 out of the 4 Majar League divisions, every elub was closer to the division winner than in 1976 {excluding expansion teams). The record shows that sutr stantial improvements can be made through investment in the free agent market. The Yankeesj Milwaukee Brewers, California Angels, and Te:ltas Rangers all made substantial improvement. in team quality through heavy investment in the free agent system. All four of these teams showed no signs of repeated success in their respective recent histories until the free agent system was created. A system of compen<>ation's main purpose is not to deter owners from !>uyi.ng free agents, which it d{)es, but to maintain the talent distribution among the teams in the league as it exists. In order for \competitive balance\ to be preserved; the league must first be balanced, otherwise \competitive imbalance'' will be perpetuated. Finally, I'd like to point out some false and misleading statements made in the article. 1. Catfish Hunter, although signed as a -free agent, did not enter the free agent market as it now exists. He was declared a free agent because the terms of his contract were not honored by owner Charles Finley. 2. It is stated that the players now have \control over the owners.\ In what way d<l players control owners? 3. \cThe most logi.cal argument against signing free agents is looking at the sue· cessful teams in the past decade. Of the ten World Series winners, only two years did a team that emphasizes the free agent route win the crown.\ Pd like to point out to Mr. Silver· stein that the free .agent system has only been in existence the last 4 years, not 10 years. ln those four years, the Yankees won 2 World Championships plus a third petmant, hardly supportive . evidence that suc- cess can't be achieved through free agency .. Although free agency may not have had enough time yet to fully show its effects on baseball, it appears that as a result, a more balanced, ex~ citing .sport will be developed. I hope I've straightened some irn~ortant points out. performers was inexcusable under any circumstances. Although I'm sure they're not representative of the dorm, the behavior of a sizable group from 2nd and 3rd Floors West bordered on infantile. Their constant talking and screwing around during the acts was distracting to both the audience and the performers. The first act, Chris Stater and Mary Meacher, was practically inaudible, and although Demetra Pontisakos en· couraged some audience participation, the excess of it by those selfish few destroyed the enjoyment of her act, too. The last thing this newspaper needs is someone to explain manners to a group of in- sensitive jerks. So I'll make things very simple to those people: It's bad enough that you don't have enough respect for yourselves to behave properly. I don't care about that. l3ut I do object to you not respecting the rights of other people in the audience to enjoy themselves. This, if I must explain, is called being rude. And worst of all,. the lack of respect for the per- formers is unforgivable. Out of consideration for you, they are in Cabaret to entertain, and not to become the targets of pu€frile peanut-throwers. Finally,Iwouldn't have blamed either of last week's acts if they had walked off stage in the middle of a sohg. I think their patience with you was un- deserved. Cabaret used to be, and should be, a relaxing and enM joyable place to spend a Thursday evening. It shouldn't be a responsibility of the Cabaret staff to walk around and discipline members of the audience. You should be ex- pected to behave yourselves. If you do feel that rudeness is a prerequisite to having a good time, then nex:t time do us all a favor-stay home.

His feelings on the current military situation of the United States in many ways reflects the feelings of many of us. His past in- volvement in the armed forces adds a different dimension to his feelings. Mr. Fuzia's ad\ ditional comments on the survey questionnaire were as follows: \I was forced to jom the service in 1972 as a result of the Vietnam War. Though my college career was interrupted, I do not in any way regret it. It amazes me that so many students and young people cry out for action in Iran yet are more than willing to let the other guy go. No one wants a war, but many desire to retain the freedoms they enjoy, as well as the star'l<Jard of living they are accustomed to. Registration is a precautionary, and in some ways, a strategic measure. I can honestly appreciate the fact that many people do not wish to fight. There are some alter- natives, both civilian and military. It seems to me that many who oppose the draft (and it is only registration) would still be quite rei uctant to have their lives interrupted by other courses of action, say VISTA or Peace Corps. Perhaps I am biased in my patriotic proclivities and military background. However, back in 1972, I did not wish to be draf- ted, but as things worked out, I had made the best out of the situation at hand. The complex world we live in demands sacrifice and I hope through peaceable means. Resisting the draft may protect one's little world from the sometimes harsh realities of life, but then the larger picture is somehow ignored and payment required at a later date.\ Editor's Note: The student responses here in no way reflect concrete statistical data. The above survey was conducted to enable Concordiensis to print various opinions presented by you, the students.

During the late performance last week, the conduct of certain member$ {)f the audien(!e left quite a bit to be desired •. Admittedly, rowdiness and peanut-throwing are as much a part of cabaret as talking is in tl:le all-11ight study-no. pr!->b~em. But there has to be a linut to everything. Last week's barrage of peanuts left me practically shell ... shocked, and the general rudeness toward the by BRUCE KAPLAN I got invited recently to an anti-draft registration party. While smiling and trying to keep a clear head (the contact high was pretty potent), some person wandered over wanting to talk about the movement. It was all so surrealistic. \Like hey, man,\ he said, \like I've been thinking about this since that Carter dude on the television talked about registration.\ Although he smelled like he hadn't bathed since the State of the Union speech, I smiled some more and nodded that I would listen to him. \It's like, man, you know, war sucks. I mean like you and me and everybody doesn't want to die in some place where they don't even speak our language. They might not even have Dead tapes, or disco tablets, man. Well, I'd go fight in Afghanistan, maybe man, hey we gotta save the black hash from the Russians. But, listen man, I'm a pacifist, like I studied Political Science in college, man, but like this is too much. I don't want to fight. Maybe I'll teach Political Science. \Like this Carter dude. he isn't going to fight. And that little brat Amy with the buck teeth, she ain't even gonna be a poster girl man. Hey, Jimmy, I'm happy. I got my college degree, my fashion jeans, my stash, my old lady. my old man's money, like why should I go and get my +u c k i ng head blown off. Like those dudes like my father, man. they are sick and crazy man. The believe in America, man. They believe in war, man. All they are are moneymongers. Maybe if they hung out in fashion jeans at the Studio, or smoked pot, man, they would mellow out. \Like who cares if Russia takes over anyway. Vodka in my bong is intense. Hey, do you realize, man, that the President of the United States is depriving us of our constitutional rights? Yeah, I can't do what I want to do if I'm drafted. I get paranoid about being registered, so I'm deprived in the same way. Freaks me out, man. Wow, who would want to fight for a country anyway if they deprive you of your rights? \I'm a pacifist Man, I think my brain has been mellowed by rock and disco. I mean, I get into fights at concerts when someone spills my pipe, or at the Studio when somebody spills a drink on my fashion jeans. But, I'm confortable, man, I don't want to sacrifice that. It's illegal to draft me, man. Just think of the commerce Ron Delsner, or the Studio would lose if I got drafted. Hey, I don't even want to pay income tax, I'd rather buy a Hendrix albwn, Dead, or a new pair of Steve Waldman Disco Jeans. What I'm trying to say man is that if you believe in the draft, you're wrong man. You're a f+c+ing fascist if you go to war, man. I don't care if we are attacked. No nukes, man.

All students and faculty are welcome. Sig.n up in the Student Activities Office in Carnegie HaiL Habitual· Pot···use I started smoking pot daily about four years ago, February 1976. It was Red Bud. I bought a quarter pound of it for a hundred dollars. It had a deep, rust color. I can remember a friend referring to it as ''fine wine.'' Hey, I was having a good time; it was Hke, man, I could forget my troubles. At the time, I was at- tending a Conununity College and blowing it away like it was silly putty. I ran out of the Red Bud in June of 1976. I copped an ounce of ·Mexican; it looked like . home grown, but the price was right. Fifteen Dollars. That summer I continued to buy what in the regional vernacular was referred to as ''Commercial Columbian.\ In reality, it was nothing more than dark Mexican. That Fall I attended a nationally ranked University; the monster crushed me like so many beaten vagabonds strewn across the world. On the average, 1 1 was smoking pot about three or four times weekly. I withdrew in December of 1976. I then resigned myself to habitual pot use for the next three years. The only break I can recall was a two week stint sometinle in the spring of 1978, Looking Back: Carnival Ah yes, 1978. It was in the ~ate fall of that year that I was in· troduced to fire. A fierce,. angry, flaming fire. I lived in a group house and befriended an ex- heroin addict. As the song goes, however, \. . . When you're married to H.

He was no longer addicted physically to heroin, but he was shooting just about anything he could get his calm hands on! This included crank (crystal methadrine), coke, bam, D's, etc. My downfall, or shall I now say, the ~itome of my gullibility, was bam. Bam is a euphemism for Preludin 75 mg. I started snorting the drug, but it wasn't long until I started working at it. To those of you familiar with the last euphemism, you know that I started shooting it. :it some more.

Of course, you have sur- mized by now that the parallel structureis a reference to works. Gimmick.s. The hot needle. This was the core of my mesmerization. I craved the seconds when the point kissed, nay, when the poiiit did battle with my arm. A battle that had my entire mental capability crumbling, sniveling like an idiot. For over a year, I was at its mercy; a whipping boy crying for pain, a cruel mental anguish that had me by the balls. I · spent, literally thousands of dollars. I alienated my family; I alienated my friends; I alienated myself. by PAUL GROSSMAN Winter Carnival has come and gone· once again and it seems fair to say that it was enjoyed by most who took part. The high light of the Carnival was the Dinner-dance last Saturday night. Last Saturday night seemed much the same as it was last year, good food and dancing music dominating the evening. It was an enjoyable night out and a welcome break from the weekly grind. LOOKING BACK thirty-two years ago, the attitudes were somewhat different. Reprinted from Con· cordiensis, February 27, 1948 'LOOSE' ·SEX SEEN AS A CAUSE OF ALL PROM FRUSTRATION It is prom weekend when every Union man is pledged to a good time. On prom night an essay on morality is as ap- propriate as singing hymns at a prize fight. Why is this especially true here at Union? One reason is that we are guilty of doing our best to change the mores of society to accomodate our sensual urges, basing our right to do this on a desire to reduce life's frustrations which are psychologically harmful. In other words we have attempted to rationalize sin into· right. It is rather late for any of us to gain spiritual insight tD strengthen our characters in time for the weekend; however., if all of us resolved to enter into the prom festivities con- centrating on our high concept of ourselves and our guests,we would get more fun out of it. In spite of the talk, relatively few Union men will actually commit any cardinal sin this weekend, yet much of the conversation leading up to this week has centered on a low level. Most of us are thinking seriously of marriage. We have invited a girl to the prom for whom we have a great deal of respect. This·actuality and the loose vein in which we talk about these weekends hardly seem to be C()mpatibleto each other. Sex is good, because God made it. We should prepare ourselves to get the mosJ; fun out of it. In another vein, also in the issue from 1948, is the following \humor\ article. While our attitude.s on sex may have become \looser\, our con- siderat1on of women has solidified considerably from the view presented in the following reprinted article: \ Typical Prom Date likes parties tho Axnused,Confused The scene is a dim corner of tile We Drinka Bit fraternity house.

Don't you just adore fraternity par~ ties? This is the first I've ever been to, they're out of this world, aren't they? \And my date is such a super hunk of man.

Rather my point is this, it was a rude awakening, a mental jolt, that made me finally aware of what drugs were doing to iny life.

A fire that allows me to sense people as human beings and not just to see them as someone to get high with.

In last week's closing, the stock market again proved that it can not deal with prosperity. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a 17 month high of 903.84, but it then closed off sharply in the final two sessions of the week. The Dow finally closed at 884.98 for a net loss of 10.75 points. Recent favorites such as the oil, defense, and precious meta1s issues posted high sales and lowering prices due to profittaktng. Below is a list of the most active stocks for the week of Feb• 15, 1980. This will help those serious-minded investors in keeping up with the latest stock reports: . bullish. I think that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will keep its head abOve the 840 area for the rest of February and then rise to the low 90Q level. The major markettrends that I have been following (trading volume, market breath, and the action ·Of the bond market) look towards an upward trend. \On the other hand there are many analysts Who feel that the market could experience a shakedown after the day reaches 900 which would send a number of nervous new buyers into the ''bear's den\. I would now like to talk about the seasawing price of gold in recent months. The gold market has seen frantic buying and selling which eventually raised the price ofbullion to $875 dollars The price of gQld reached record levels in mid-January, reacting to. both political and economic events, including the oil price rises, the Iranian hostage situation, the Sovlet military intervention in Afghanistan, and the desire of most of the oil producing nations to diversify their financial sur- pluses beyond the doll.af. The curreq,t gold price is extremely unstable. As gold prices go up, less is spent on bullion for in- dustrial and jewelry use. In 1979 industrial usage feU ten percent and in 1980 I predict for a 25 percent decrease. There is one aspect that all the gold elq)erts agree upon, that if a shooting war were to erupt in the Persian Gulf Region, gold would go beyond the $1000 an ounce level very rapidly.

What if the cards had fallen another way, and you were the one being held in the detention camp? Wouldn't you hope for, the support from someone? The Union College · Amnesty International Organization is trying to provide that support for Tomas Gonzales. Senor ~onzales is a political prisoner m Uruguay. Amnesty estimated that there are at least 2500 political prisoners, not in- cluding those arrested, in- terrogated, tortured, and released without being brought ~efore a court; now being held m Urguay. It is difficult for us to believe the kind of. treatment these prisoners receive. One Uruguayan lieutenant testified that 1(90 . percent of the Uruguayan Armed Forces are involved directly or indirectly THE UNITS ARE COMING TO' UCOL MARCH 1. in torture\; and that \No one has been punished for par- ticipating in the application of torture.\ Tomas Gonzales is one of these prisoners. He was arrested in December of 1975, for belonging to a political party other than that of the govern- ment (a crime punishable from between 3 to 18 years). There is evidence to suggest that Senor Gonzales has been tortured, and his poor health has not received adequate medical treatment. On top of this, he has been separated from his family who are dependant upon him for financial support. Beyond Senor Gonzales' in- dividual case, Amnesty International continues to be distrubed by several aspects of the present situation: the large number of prisoners of con· scienc~; the long periods of isolated detention; the frequent ., altreatment and torture of , litical prisoners; and the poor . :ison conditions. · In this past year, none of these political prisoners were released, and trials are still proceeding at an alarmingly slow rate. You can make a difference in stopping these atrocities. There will be a post card campaign in Carnegie on Tuesday, February 26th, bet- ween 10:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. All we are asking is that you com,e and sign a prewritten post card (or write you own), which calls for the release of Tomas Gonzales, and all other political ,prisoners. With your help, . maybe we can make a dif- ference.

Apart from the rather poor acoustics in the Cathedral (which was not built for singing), the concert was generally termed ''a fiasco\ by the Union participants. The program consisted of \Fanfare for Thanksgiving\ by L. Stanley Glarum; and \Ave Maria\ by Michael Head, both sung by the Ladycliff Glee Club; \0 Domine Jesu Christe\ by Josquin des Prez, sung by the Union men; \Can tate Domino1', by Hans Leo Hassler, s1,111g by the Union women; and \Exsultate Juste\ by Ludovico da Viadana, and \Crucifixus\, by Antonio Lotti, both sung by' the Villanova Singers. These were followed by two numbers sung by all. four groups--Motet VI by Johann Sebastian Bach, directed by the Villanova director, and \Worthy is the Lamb that was Slain\ the final chorus in the \Messiah'' by George Frederic Handel, directed by the Ladycliff director. Attendance was approximately 2;000. The concert was very disorganized, with entrances and exits being very slipshod and unplanned. The numbers Sl.Ulg by the Union groups in the words of one participant had \never gone better.\ Hugh Allen Wilson, the Union director, commented that the noise of the cr.owd vanished during the Men's number and ~ose again during the Villanova sequence. He speculated that the crowd therefore knew the difference in quality. However, the worst part of the con~ert ... . occurred during the two joint numbers. The Villanova and Ladyeliff singers supposedly pedormed these numbers together before, but this was not evident from the performance they gav:e. They ranged from one half to two and one half measures behind the ~)eat, usually off-key, and on at least one occasion, singing music which was not on the score. The directing was not completely up to par, being difficult even for a seasoned professional organist like Hugh Allen Wilson to fqllow. The worst part of the numbers was that the directors didn't seem to hear the disharmony they were conducting. Union's Men and Women's next concert, without Villanova and Ladycliff, is March 2 in Glens Falls, New York. Law And Order At Union Colleg_e The Russians Are-Coming Russian military officers have planned an invasion of the. horne of the THREE SISTERS, Olga, Masha & Irina. lhe Nott Memorial is actually being used as a m~etrrig place for great Russian military minds. by RICHARD N. NIXON At most small, private liberal-arts colleges which happen to 6e nesteled in the verdant bowels of lower Schenectady, I may state conclusively, and without hesitation, that, the Law - that is, those rules arid ordinances which regulate, protect, coerce and otherwise dominate or~ dinary civilians, behaviour has little or no real impact as far as student conduct is concerned. Union1 College, for example, harbors within its ivy;..walled parameters numerous and sundry drug abusers, wanton fornicators, vandals, petty criminals, and disturbers-of- the-peace, to name a few. Beer- ravaged partiers tinkle on sidewalks while Security of- ficers turn their heads, amused. Lightheaded hooligans, reeling from their latest ether, glue, or Freon binge, break windows, kick in doors, demolish in- stitutional furniture u.e., toss them from great heights through closed windows), and profer a myriad of tiresome and costly pranks. In short, these troglodytes in scholastic garb run rampant unafraid because neither the Dean of Stu~ents, the Security Office, nor the Conduct Ombudsman Com- mittee appear to have any real intent {short of a mild and quite probably feigned interest) in curbing that minority of students who picture ever:· evening as \Halloween Night\ and cavor.:t accordingly. In illustration of my already belaboured point, consider what an unhurried walking tour of the College revealed to me last evening as the majority of well- behaved and neatly-appointed students snored peacefully through the night. At one a.m. on St. Valentine's Day past, a burst of machinegun fire drew me towards Jackson's Gardens, where a gangland-style execution had just taken place. Security arrived several hours late, explaining that a student had locked himself out of his room at North which required their more immediate at- tention. Of course, as one officer exclaimed, had they known groups of freshmen were being herded into the Gardens and mercilessly gunned down during the early morning hours, they would \have eaten much faster and left the White Tower earlier to respond to such lawless behaviour.\ I left the Gar.dens, dishear- tened but nonetheless com- forted by Security's earnest (if not necessarily helpful or adroit) presence amid the recent carnage. I then .mean- dered over to the Rathskellar. Directly before me, a group of vandals (not to be confused with their northern neighbors, the Huns save for their manner) were merrily spray-painting the Nott Memorial a realistic flesh- tone, while one lone prankster scaled the mammarian heights Richmond Sponsored Coffeehouse 1st Act 2nd Act Rachel GertzQg and Amy Edwards Jeff Battin Friday Feb. 22 Old <thapel Adm. $1 8:30 p.m. Coffee, tea, don!Jts Free to Richmond Residents w /ticket to place a revolving, red police light at her swnmit.

Upon reaching the 'Skellar, I was accosted by two bloodied drunks who forced me to join a notorious Greek society against my will. The steps leading down to the College's more famous drinking establishments were littered with the remains of former honour students whose only crime, I later determined, lay in their refusal to chug a pitcher • of Matt's while whistling the Alma Mater. Inside, the Rathskellar resembled the partially- dismantled set of a · spaghetti Western. The jukebox had been firebombed earlier that night by the Rugby Team \because we're singing, goddammit.

The fihp is not a documentary, in fact one section is'a parody\£ the documentary technique- Hitler's valet bores the audience for 45 minutes with minu:te details of Hitler's daily routine, without revealing anything which furthers our understanding. Instead, the film is set in severaLsurreal landscapes, including the ante- room of Hell, a circus, and a stage full of artifacts (a globe, chairs, a table, dead leaves, a megaphone, a model of Edison's ''Black Maria\ studio where film making originated) with which Syberberg creates a world. More realistic scenes are also used; newsreel footage; scenes from the Chancellery and Berchtesgaden and recordings of speeches are spliced together to evoke an affective response from the audience. Syberberg creates a visual and auditory collage which .forces the viewer to experience the ideals of Nazism, the dreams of power, redemption, and perfection of the \master race\. In the first filrp, \The Grail\ Syherbl;lrg introduces his ultimate goal. of providing a trial for Hitler; since Hitler cannot be .present, each member of the cast, and the auQ.ience as well, is invited to play out their own versions of Hitler, who appears as Chaplin's \Great Dictator\ as a painter, as Nero, as Frankenstein, and as a lunatic chewing a carpet. This reveals the film's double purpose-to try Hitler and to assess the \Hitler in us\. Syberberg presents Nazism as a result of two processes of projection, that of Hitler 1.\!}0n the German people (Hitler as the. denied artist who \had to create in the infinitly dirtier environment of politics\) his attempt to create an entir,e society according to his pr-ivate fantasy, and that of the German people upon Hitler, the desire for a strong leader to redeem the country after Versailles, and also for a man to fulfill their cultural traditions ef R()man- ticism and Idealism. In the second segment, ' 1 A German Dream\ Hitler is presented as- the heir to Richard Wagner's cultural legacy-the belief in the \Great man\ and the beliefthat man's future cap be changed by the excercise of \pure will\.

In the third segment \The End of the Winter's Tale\ Hiilll;Yller adinits the Jews will . have to suffer terribly because of the Nazi plans, but compares the Holocaust to other atrocities, such as the decimation of the American Indian; he seems to sear;ch for a cultural explanation.-something equivalent to the American \Manifest Destiny\ to relieve the guilt experienced by himself ~nd the German peqple. Hitler appears as a ventriloquist's dummy, complaining that be is being misused and lists the political and ideological results of his reign: the creation of a Jewish :homeland, the Hitler in the Ante-Roorn of Hell realignment of Europe's map with advantages for both the US and USSR, the increased subtlety of propoganda, seen in Hollywood's movies, in ad- vertising, and in Russia where political opponents are labled. deranged. Hitler presents the Reich as only the first of many states to llSe these techniques, with heirs tbroughout the world. The closing minutes of the fourth segment, \We Children of Hell\ contains the verdict against Hitler-guilty for . the distraction of the Jews as a culturally oriented people, who now value their warriors more than their artists, and guilty for degrading the German Romantic and German Idealist traditions, leaving Germany without spiritual roots and· laying the .country bare for the abuses of materialism, \in pursuit for his paradise, another was lost\. This is the barest sketch of Syberberg's work; it is a demanding film because of its content, its level of abstraction, and' its length, but I feel it carries an important message about the con(lition of modem man, . especially in Gennany; afraid to believe in the state for fear of despOtism, afraid to believe in an ideological pur- pose because of the hellish result of the Third Reich, modern man adopts materialism as soc1ety's ideal. The film played for three days in NY City, and will be difficult to find, but it is well worth the effort. The screenplay is also being published this year, which should be a real aid in un- derstanding the finer points of the film. If I've sparked anyone's interest, Susan Sontag has an excellent review of the film in last week's NY Review of Books.

In the area of Social Service, Dartmouth has a number of programs available. The Tucker Foundation Internships \expose students to the harsh realities of poverty and op- pression as well as provide an opportunity to undertake dif- ficult tasks and to try to make a difference in such settings.'' In all cases, the Foundation seeks to guide and strengthen those personal resources that make for responsible and com\ passionate living, and which provide context and meaning to a liberal education. Under the auspices of the Tucker Program, students can participate in programs in Jersey City, th,e Third World, and the low-income and poverty-stricken communities surrounding Dartmouth. Inner-city interns learn what. it means to \cope\ with the realities of life in the heat of Jersey City. An underlyin,g threat of continuity in former interns' feelings about their exp~riences is the recognition that their experiences forced them to take ~ long hard look at themselves. The interns live in a building in the heart of J ersex City. They share household responsibilities and their thoughts, frustrations and joys with one another during the term. Work ex- periences provide the fuel for most of the discussions. Interns are expected to commit themselves to a full-time job with a non-profit organization and they .are placed in everything from community medical clinics and legal aid societies, to elementary schools and drug rehabilitation centers. Interns live under close, often unfamiliar conditions, and the pressure .of living with one's opinions constantly under fire has a way of sorely testing long- held assumptions and con- victions. In the realm of business and industry, the Dartmouth program is far-reaching. Interns can plug into programs at Mobil Oil Corp., Pillsbury Company, American Hospital Supply, W.R. Grace and Co., and the Robinson's Children's Literature Grant provides an opportunity for anyone showing a sincere and continuing in- terest in writing for children as a career. To focus on one option in particular: The Mobil Corp. offers an internship in their Public Relations Dept. in New York City, to assist in the research and production of a variety of ·projects. Interns devote most of their energies to doing research for Mobil's editorials in the Wall Street Journal and the \observation\ colmnns. The Program on the Administration of Complex Organizations at Mount Holyoke College attempts to provide a link between the academic and org?.nizational worlds, and to acquaint women liberal arts students with the · opportunities that are becoming available to them in areas that, in general, have not been seen by women as viable career alternatives. • · The Program has three related aspects. The first is the· academic coursework. The Program courses have been const~ucted in such a way that they offer an interdisciplinary perspective to the subject ~atter. They are not intended, m any sense, to be traditional business or technical courses. Instead, they hope to brillg a t~eoretical and analytical . hberal arts approach to the study of organizations. The courses do not constitute a major !!Tid; in fact, .are intended to be a complement to the student's existing major. The courses are open to students of any major from the sophomore, junior, or senior classes. The second aspect of the Program is a summer in- ternshfp program. The in- ternships offer the students a chance to gain some practical experience while testing their theoretical classroom learning in a real world situation.. The internships last for ten to twelve weeks during the stm;uner and provide a temporary immersion in the organizational world. ThE: interns are given useful projects or participate in ongoing projects or programs- something substantive that proyides a good learning, ex- perience, contributes to the organization, and, at the same time, familiarizes the student with various facets of the .organization and some of the factors which constrain organizational development and administrative decision- making. Mt. Holyoke also en- courages members of the organization's administration to take special interest in the progress of the intern and to meet with her to offer explanations and background material on the organization and to be available from time to time to answer questions. Internships are open to students. following their sophomore or junior years. Freslunen and seniors may not participate in internships. . The third aspect of the Program is a fun~credit, semester-lon,g academic seminar which is required of ail students who have had in- ternships. The seminar provides a framework in which students can compare and discuss their expe'riences. In this way they also benefit from the internshjps of their fellow students. Members of some of the sponsoring organizations are invited to come to the campus to participate in discussions with the seminar students and to serve as a resource to the campus in general. · The Program is designed to create a greater understanding of organizational ad- ministration among students and an appreciation of the complexity and importance of organizational problems. In addition, through their par- ticipation, sponsoring organizations can make a fir- sthand contribution to education and can help increase the number of intelligent and capable young women available to fill adtninistrative positions in the near future. Some companies commented on the work of individual students. A city housing agency described one student's per- formance: During her in- ternship the student tem- porarily filled the position of assistant planner for the housing element of this agen· cy's comprehensive planning program.

In order for programs such as these to work here, the College would have to put a great deal of time and money towards development.

If you've got the time, ' wne gotthe beer. ;Miller At'hlete :Of The Week The recipient of. the Miller \Athlete of the Week\ trophy is Henry- Wright, a junior Sociology major from.Holyoke, Mass. · · Wright has .starred on the Dutchmen trac.k feam this season and is also the top pass . receiver on the football team. Henry's most recent winning effort came this week against Albany State, when. he finished first in the long jump and triple jump. This is the third time during the indoor track season that Wright nas had double wins, and twice the ten points he received has helped lead Union to a meet victory. Because a large ntm1ber of Union track square members were iil, the D'utchmen were virtually assured of being shut out in the two final events; the mile and the two mile relays. Henry's winning d performance in the last non-running event, the triple jump, placed Union beyond the reach of Albany State. Although Wright has missed some me~ts due to a back in- jury, he is undefeated in the meets he has partic~pated in. Previously, a Wright double win had gained Union a first-place -. ' tie with Williams College. Henry has been on both the indoor track and football teams for three years, and is a brother at Chi Psi. ·Mmer Alhfere of tne Week Henry ~ighf ·\ Sports H·appenings Feb. 21-Feb. 27 Var.

Sheila O'Donnell and Sandi Key led the scoring attack with 20 pc;~ints . apiece while Debbie \Puff\ Downey added 10 points. Sandy Key grabbed 16 rebOlmds and · Sheila O'Donnell brought down 10. The· next day the Dutch- women travelled to Massachusetts, to face an aggressive North Adams team. The women faced a disap- pointing 45-53 loss. Sandi Key and Sheila O'Donnell were high scorers again with 14 and 13 points respectively. Everyone brought down rebounds: 8 for Sandi Key, 7 each for Sheila O'Donnell and Natalie Stone, and 6 for Patty Hamilton. A View From The Stands This past Monday a small Union squad travelled to Vassar College (Anne Fitzrnaurie and Liz Miller were sidelined with injuries and Sheila O'Donnell was out sick). Despite the lack of players, Union · came out ahead with a 75-51 win. Four players were in double figtires: ' Sandi Key tossea in 20 points, Patty Hamilton added 19 points, Debbie Downey put up 15 points and Carol Wrinn had 10 points. Key and Hamilton combined for 'by DOUG SILVERSTEIN Frequently in professional sports an incident occurs which allows us to reflect upon the dangers that occur in contact sports. There is no denying the fact that a fan desires to see a good but solid hit in a football game, hut orte such incident left an outstanding individual paralyzed from the neck region and below. Only therapy has restored some mobility in the muscles of Darryl Stingley. The injury occured in a 197& pre- season game in which Jac,k Tatum of the Oakland Raiders brutally hit Stingley while the receiver was running a crossing pattern. The players,_ league and fans' have since condemned Tatum and the Raider organization for the, incident. Why? If this was a fluke in- cident should the fans castigate Tatum? The reasons are that in addition to not sending con- dolences to Stingley or ·hi$ loved ones, Tatum co-wrote a book concerning his vicious style of play. The recent release of that book and the subsequent file of suit by Stingley against Tatum are the reason for this article. The book is entitled They Call Me Assasin. Not much sym- pathy can be conveyed in a book with such a title. For many years the Oakland Raiders, a very successful franchise, were known for their hard hitting and aggressive style of play. Players such as Phrl Villipiano, George Atkinson and Tatwn were classified as a group of outstanding, but brutal tacklers. Many fan$ ·-probably appreciated the style of pfay because one might assume that enthusiasm is immediatEly associated with ae:t:!ression and ferocity. But' the insightful fans feared that the rough tackling would eventually back- fire on the league and the Raiders. Unfortunately, Stingley was the recipient of the circmnstance. George Atkinson is no stranger to the U.S. legal system. He was sued by Pitts- burgh Steelers coach Chuck Noll, who Claimed that Atkinson hit his player Lynn Swan with the ·desire to injure. Atkinson · was later traded to Denver after the suit was settled, but Swan · suffered injuries that caused · him unnecessary discomfort. The repercussions of the. -in- cident left a disheartening and shocking feeling . among the members of the league and the fans. In addition, it left a sour note on a very good and exciting playoff game. In the suit, Noll condemend the behavior of Atkinson and warned the league and its substituents of future incidents. Nothing has been done to prevent hhis type of incident involving Swan or Stingley fro.m occuring again since one cannot gauge the intensity of play in the N.F.L. Doing so· would diminish the level of excitement ·and exhilaration that is inherent in the game. What makes the Tatum incident so unusual ·in comparison to other incidents of · injury causing circwnstances is not only its severity but also the arrogance and insensitivity of Tatuin towards Stingley. Tatum's comments were recently portrayed in a book entitled They cau Me Assassin. In the publication, Tatum ap- pears to be orgulous of the Stingley incident and also of his reputation and past per- formances. The recent release of the contents of the book in- stigated a lawsuit filed by Stingley against Tatum. Although Tatum will receive receipts from the sales of the book, it is imperitive for· people to expose Tatum as the villain he is. The N.F.L. Board of Direc- tors now has a decision on its course of action. Barring Tatum from play in the N.F.L. only involves neglecting the Raiders the right to sign Tatwn to future contracts, since he will probably be blac):balled throughout the league. Once a respected and popular player, he has lost his credibility and prestige. The league most probably cannot take any legal action 'Since the incident 'is suspect and it has no real standing to sue. But Stingley has filed suit and this is where Tatum must be prosecuted. The ideal result would allow the book to be released, with all receipts going to Stingley as ·compensation for the injury. This way, as mentioned before, Tatum will be exposed to the public. But it is obvious that nothing can nullify the anguish Stingley suffers. For such a br:ave man like Stingley to be humiliated by Tatum is unjust, and hopefully the courts will have it within their jurisdiction to see justice served and Tatum punished accordingly (or should I say severely). Each day Stingley receives thoughtfull cards from caring fans who wish him a healthy · recovery and offer moral support. Stingley has said that his faith will bring him through the misfortune and he will emerge victoriously. He always was a winner on he field; and now, he has proved he is a winner off the field. I encourage all concerned to send cards to the New England Patriots football organization in pl.'aise and support of a remarkable competitor, Darryl Stingley. 464 State St. we deliver 38 rebounds bringing down 19 apiece. Dot Scarpiiiato, Brenda Hugick, Natalie Stone, and Kirsten Peterson all put in fine efforts to assist with the win.

Page 12 OONOO!RDllilNSJS, February !1, 1980 sports Team Coming On: ,. . Hoopers Take TWo Of Three . - by BILL CURTIN The Union College hoopers have just . completed a sen- . sational week. The dutchmen are currently playing out- standing basketball and are drawing praises from op- ponents and fans alike. Union played three of their toughest opponents this past week on a schedule which is regarded as one of the toughest in Division Ill basketball. Last Wednesday, Coach Bill Scanlon's squad upset nationally ranked Division II powerhouse Hartwick in a 67-66 thriller. Junior Joe Cardany picked a perfect time to move into second place on Union's all- time scoring list as he canned both ends of a l and 1 situation with 8 seconds remaining . to clinch the victory. The charity shots gave Cardany 20 points for the night and 1,119 for his career, placing ·him ahead of Dave Santos on the all-time scoring list. Only Jim Tedisco (1,632 pts.) is ahead of Cardany now. Union pulled off the victory by using a patient offense against Hartwick's various zone defenses. If Cardany and back- court mate Joe Clinton weren't bombing f.rot:n outside, they were driving to the hoop and dishing olf for easy lay-ups. Joe Clinton was very successful in keeping Hartwick off balance as he collected 13 points and 7 assists. It was the Dutchmen's big men that secured the victory. John Montanile, Chris Walsh and Jim McGhee managed to neutralize the Warriors over- whelming height advantage (6 foot 7 inch, 6 foot 7 inch, 6 foot 4 inch front line) and free themselves underneath the offensive boards for easy shots. Jo:tm Montanile finished the night with 14 points. Two nights later Union picked up where they left off as they got revenge over the University of Rochester by a 74~52 count. Two weeks earlier, in Rochester, the YeUowjackets defeated Union by two points in a ga:me down fo the wire. Rochester never seriously threatened the Dutchmen in Memorial Field House though. The hoopers forced numerous turnovers and converted many alley-oops at the end of fast breaks to secure a 20 point lead by halftime. Once again Union's patient offense and aggressive defense were the key to the romp. Joe Cardany leo the Union attack with 23 points. Monday night the Dutclnnen ventured to New Haven, Con- necticut, for a showdown with Division I Yale. Yale is.enjoying a very successful campaign. They are currently in 3rd place in the Ivy League after a recent r 73-68 loss to first place University of Pennsylvania. Union was by no means in awe of the Ely's though as they battled even until folding in the final seconds and suffering a 68- 62 loss. It appeared that Yale was going to coast to victory as they opened up ~ early six point lead ~nd lengthened it ta ten by midway through the first half. They established the lead by using their height advantage and the ball handling wizardry of Jim Ziegerelli. But Union battled back to a 34-30 halftime score by playing a tenacious man to man defense. The second half turned out to by a fine display of shooting. The Ely's only missed two shots the whole second half but Union managed to stay close on Joe Cardany's magnificent second half perfo~ce. Joe shot 8 for Track Looks- To R.P.I. The Union track team defeated Albany State last Thursday by a score of 67-60. Two days later, the Dutchmen finished fourth in a quadrangular meet- against Dartmouth, Brown and Columbia. A sweep of the field events proved to be decisive in the Albany meet. Henry Wright won both the long jump and triple jwnp to highlight the win. Jim Zalucki won the pole vault with a 13 foot effort with Davey Wallace second. Dave Cozzen's jump of 6 fQOt 5 inches captured the higb jump with teammate Gerry Wells second. Boomer Bob Pavacic completed the field events sweep with a vic- tory in the shot put. Team · captain Matt Guilfoyle's 50.1 second 400 meter time highlighted the Dutchmen's performance on the track. Guilfoyle lEd from wire to wire to•post an easy win. Senior Mark Nazon captured the 55 meter hurdle event with teammates Tom Stegmann and Gerry Wells second and third. D~nis Contois and Darrel Logan turned in strong per· fonnances with second place finishes in the 800 meter and 50 meter races. The Dutchmen meet with considerably less success when they traveled tp partmouth the next day. A lack of recovery time following the Albany meet C()mbined with the alsence · of several team members to produce one of the Dutchmen's weaker showings of the year. The one exceptional per- fonnance was turned in by freshman Dennis Contois in the 800 meters. Contois lead a strong field that included Olympic hopeful Ed Nichols for the first 400 meters of the race. Although he faded to fifth, Contois still recorded a time of 1:57.2, one of the .fastest times ever turned in by a Union runner, Contois downplayed 'his· performance after the meet, but later confided that he felt he could have ran \three or four seconds fa~ter\ if he hadrtt raced Thursday. Contois' effort overshadowed a 2:00 flat time by Dave Dellehunt in the same event. The ·two freshmen also recorded identical times of 2:00 flat to lead the Dutchmen to a fourth place finish in the two mile rel~y .. Matt Guilfoyle. also turned in a strong performance wiijl a fourth place showing in the 500 meters. Freshman Garry Wells added a fourth in the hurdles. The track team's next meet is Satm:day when they participate .in .tbe RPI Invitation$}. .. . . S from the field and 3 for 4 from the line jn the second half, in· eluding Union's last 11 ,points. The jlmior guard finished with a career .. high 33 points. Joe hit two foul shots with 48 seconds to go-to close the Yale lead to 64-(;1. Joe Clinton then stole the ball Union slowed down the offense' a11d CUnton got off a shot with 30 seconds to go but failed to connect. The three games put Union's record at a respectable 10,-9. For Carda ny' s efforts against Hartwick and Rochester, he was named to the ECAC All- Star Weekly team. for the fourth time.

Hockey Drops Two by RICHIE DECKER and MATT KAYNE . The Un!on S~ating Putchmen~\ who had mcreased their playoff hopes with an upset over Middlebury and by defeating Brockport severly hindered their quest for post-season - action by being dealt losses at the hands of Williams and Merrimack. Williams Squeaks by Union 5-4 Handicapped by the loss of three players, Mark Haley, AI De Libero, and Jim Josephson, Union tried to increase their playoff hopes at the expense of the Williams squad. · Union held a 4-3 lead going into the final stanza in which Williams· scored two goals to defeat the skating Dutchmen. The Garnet forced Williams to dump the pUck in the first. two periods and basically played their type of game but; Don Flood still opened the scoring for Williams by taRying an unassisted goal at the 35 second mark. Mark Bon scored ona power play to knot the score at 1-1 at the 2:11 mark and Don Beall and Todd Fobare combined to put the Dutchmen ahead at 10: 23 of the tirst period. Williams tied the game 2·2 at 12:31 and .. this is how the game stood after one period. WilliAms again scored the first goal of the period as Jim Rooney scored at the 3 :·Q5 mark for a 3.2 Williams lead. Bill Mason then set up two consecutive Union goals by Don :BeaU and Brad Nicholson to give Union a 4-3 lead as well as complete control of· the game for the remainder of the period. Union yielded the control to 'Williams in the third period however, and Mark St. Onge, the leading Williams scorer, tied the game at 11:17 of the third period. St. Onge scored on bis own rebound. Family Night The Basketball team hosts Babson Friday. ~II families will be admitted for just $2. Mark Semes, scored the winner at the 13:38 mar\ while Jim Burns was off for tripping. The goal was assisted by Jim Rooney and it was the second goal of the night for Semes. Union goaltender Dave Joshephson played well in the nets turning away 29 shots in· eluding many tough charges in the third period. Williams goaltender Mike Moultron · turned away 28 Garnet at- tempts.~ When asked about'the defeat; Coach Charlie Morrison replied that even though the Dutchmen were slowed by injuries \you still have to go with what you have\. He also admitted that this defeat \pla_ced Union· in a rough hole which win be hard to get out of.\ . Dutchmen Blasted 7~2 ·By Merrimack The Garnet playoff hopes were diminished further after a 7-2 defeat ~t the hands of powerful Merrimack. Merrimack broke a 1-l.tie with four second period goals in a three minute span. Jim Toomey of Merrimack opened the scoring in the contest with a goal at the 8:15 mark and it remained 1..0 in favor of Merrimack until Todd Fobare tied the score on assists from Mark Haley and Scott Fitzgerald at the 18:39 mark. Merrimack got four con- secutive· goals from Jim Toomey, Bob Magnuson, Jim Marchioni and John Economules h1 the second period to increase the warrior lead to 5-l. Bill Mason broke the Merrimack rampage at 12:09 as Haley and Fitzgerald picked up their second assists of the night but Merrimack scored twice more/to close out the period and insure their 7·2 victory. Union was outshot 39-34, as each team recorded 32 saves. Joe Cappellano had 32 saves for Merrimack and Mike Merlo and Dave Josephson combined for 32 saves for the ·nutchmen . Union now .stands at 8-14-1 in tlieir division and S-15-1 overall while· Merrimack is 12-7-1· in their division and 15-10-1 overall: · ·The Dutchmen will~ skate again Tuesday night at Achilles Rink hosting Potsdam, and again Saturday night hosting Westfield State. The games, which both begin at 8 p.m. are quite important in the skating Dutchmen quest for the playoffs. c 0 (/) ·- r: Q .. _ :: ~ 0. ~ 0 0 >- ..0 0 +- 0 ..t: c ThE Educ: meeti arou11 the ~ the h new J appr< Fore« and t Studi Pr< Chail by a consi minu secti1 The CODCI perij mini: remi shou sulte whic pro~! estal sub~ ('Urr Pr expr facu new A cal the Chal wou and shot '\!'

For the past eight years this summer theater group has been performing before en- thusiastic audiences in the Nott Memorial Theater on several weekends. When the final agreements are made, the Secot:id Company will be spending five days a week at Union and using the college as the s·ite of an openings. _ Through the office of Graduate Studies and Con- tinuing Education, the group has been offered the use of the Nott beginning .June 9th, and they will be housed .on campus starting June 17th. The college is also exploring the possibility then it has been the swnmer home of such major talents as: AF ROTC Credit Discussed . . of having some major per- formers and guest artists of the Williamstown Theater Main Stage give short solo per- Ellis Rabb; Rosemary Harris, Frank lA~ngella, Blythe Dan- ner, Richard Chamberlain, Santo Loquasto, John Conklin and Alvin Brown. The Second Cempany, the experimental wing of the Theater, had its inception in 1972. This group of talented young actors, direc- tors, and designers was founded for the (>urpose of providing a cutting edge for the Main Stage through unusual plays, neglected works, and highly experimental revivals of classics. by P A.ULFEINSOT The discussion in the Educational Policy Committee meeting last Friday- centered around three parficular issues: the wording of the minutes of the last meeting in relation to new faculty appointments; the approving of credit for Air F_orce ROTC cour~es at\ l}Plj ~ and the future of the Arnertcan Studie& pr.ograPl. Professor Anton Warde, EPC Chaii'llian, opened the meeting by asking the committee to consider toe wording of the minutes,especially in- the case of section 5. This part .states: all ,'ne.w appointments. Professor Frank Lambert, of Biology, reiterated Schneller's poii1t relating that in five years bis. own d~rtment would be turning over at a rapid rate for the ensuing ten years. Next, the question of credit for Air Foree JWTC was discussed. Professor Schneller stated that Division 2. (Social Sciences) had not met, but that he was. ~onceriiled --that;· an engineering or science student should hot use this credit alone to fulfill his or her liberal learning \B\ requirement.

He cited that the few opportunities to make chang,es in the curriculum would come with retirements, and therefore the committee should be consulted on arty and by EDWARD ALBRO The position of full-time director of American Studies has been-terminated as of the end of the next academic year; The position, held since its inception in 1974 by Professor David Nye, was cut by Dean of Faculty Paula Brownlee in a decision made in early January ·of this - year. Dean Brownlee characterizes the' decision as a purely administrative one, '• •• ,,;;.', \~';dt:=:;-: • ..,. ,'.:.:\•~·-~\~Si· ' • ~::.:.~·,,,, ' ·.~· ;(, ' ' '' ,,, ' ~ . . · 1:tette.f&'•, .,, \/ _,, '\''~· .. <.-,,, .,,,\ •.. ,.

Time Diret'lor Abolished -· which ••has no reflection on David's qua·iities.\ She ex- plained the decision by saying, \That kind of a position (a department composed of one person) at Union is an anomalous one. You can see it if it's going to grow, but in a time of very tight resources, we were not go.ing to increase the department.\ In addition, Dean Brownlee cited a decrease in the nun1ber of graduates and enrollments since 1974. While the decision itself was solely a<lministrative, it carries obvious curricular im- plications. The Educational Policy Committee has withheld endorsement of the decision because, as committee chairman Anton Warde ex- plained, .it \felt the Dean was jumping the gun\ in doing away with the position before a firm educational future was decided upon for American\ Studies. The decision has been made, however, and so the College must decide what form American Studies will take in the future. Dean Brownlee's answer to this question consists of a return to the pre-1974 structure, in which there was a part·tirne director within one of the involved departments (such as English, History, or Sociology ) and few specifically Amet·ican Studies courses. This part-time director would not necessarily, and for the time being would certainly not, hold a degree in American Studies, th0ugh an American Studies- trained person could later be _hired into one of the involved departments. In response to the need for a decision, the EPC requested that the Executive Board of the American Studies Program submit an evaluation of the future of the program. This evaluation is still in preparation. Sociology Professor Terry Weiner, a member of the Executive Board and a teacher within American Studies, disagreed with Dean Brownlee's plan, saying, \I think that the part-time .director co1iception is not a particularly viable one.\ He said that the position of an American Studies-trained director serves to coordinate and integrate the ideas students gain from the diverse fields involved in American Studies and cited the Comparative Communist Studies program as an example of the problems which occur when there' is not a coordinator with a commitment to the in- ~erdiscipHnary program. \I think you have a situation where American Studies is in jeopardy,\ Weiner stated. Professor Nye reacted quite negatively to the proposed return. \The pre-1974 program was not a good program,\ he said. \U was a gut major.\ There were only two seminars taught, he reported, neither of which were interdisciplinary. If there are no American Studies personnel in the program \it will not be an intellectually valid program,\ Nye declared, and \they should be honest and abolish tile program.\ In ad- dition, he said that \enrollment is kind of a false issue.\ White he acknowledged that un- derclass enrollments in American Studies had declined from the years previous to 1974, he characterized these enrollments as largely \renegade\ majors, students with no real commitment to Amel'i~an Studies but who had failed to find a home within one of the established departments, and sairl that the number of senior majors hasn't changed. Thr negative position of Wriner and Nye gains support from two additional sources. The report of an EPC sub- committee which was com- missioned to investigate the positiom .of interdisciplinary programs states, \It is im· portant that an individual with an American Studies background be represented in the program.\ ln addition, Chris McCarty, a senior American Studies major. stated. \Based upon my own experience; I feel it would have a detrimental effect. A full-time director is necessary to oversee the program and counsel students.\ Without courses taught by an American Studies- trained professor the major would be \not as strong,\ Continued on page 7

Page 2 OONCORDIENSIS, February 28, 1980 Editorial Administrative A_ \Apathy\ is an abrasive word which is overused by everyone, especially by the members of the Union community, of late. Concordiensis receives letters to the editor . expressing resentment towards disin- terested and uninteresting students, and writes editorials about the same. The campus newspaper is 'low adopting a new editorial policy: Ooncordiensis reserves the right to replace the word '·apathy'' with a phrase of similar meaning., and more aesthetic grace, in all articles, letters, and editorials. In ac- cordanc.e with this mandate the following com- mentary has been edited. Do you vacillate when faced with making a decision'? Are you often indifferent to exigencies? Do you find it difficult to communicate with others? If your answer is yes, then you may be one of the following: 1. a member of the Executive Board of the American Studies Program; 2. a member of the Educational Policy Committee; 3. the Dean of Faculty. If, in fa~t. you belong to one of these three groups, then we be able to provide a remedy for the general unconcern which you have been reflecting to the campus. F'irst, we cannot fault the Executive Board in their concern for Professor Nye's future at the College. However, where were they when Nye was ad- ministering the entire program by himself? The Board seems to have absolved itself of all respon- sibility in this matter. which would imply that it is not interested in the future of the program. The point was made in the EPC meeting last Friday that the catalogue cannot continue to advertise American Studies as an ongoing program when its future is in doubt. Therefore, the Board must act or permit the decision of the program's future to be in other hands. Second, the Educational Policy Committee is faced with the problem of having to interpret the Dean of Faculty's action in dismissing Nye, and beyond this they hav:e to decide if it is appropriate to -take (as they put it) \executive action\ in such a matter (thereby bypassing the Dean), and if so, then will they do it? In order to solve this dilemma, the EPC might be well advised to contact the Dean first. If it is the Committee's belief that she erred by not con- sulting them before dealing with Nye, then to repay the favor by not consulting with her may lead to another mistake. Finally, the Dean of Faculty should make her position clear to the parties involved. This alone would prove advantageous to a ~u~cker solu~ion. The proliferation of indecisiveness m ad- ministration and faculty, and the sometimes overt disinterest they display in approaching issues which directly affect students, may be setting a precedent for those .stolid members of the student body to follow. The salaried members of this community might evaluate their own inaction before complaining of the ··a- - .. - y'' of students. The Conco·rdiensis wishes to retract the phrases \nebbishy little Jew\ and \rich Jew from Long Island\ appearing in the editorials of January 24 and 31, respectively. We hope that those of you who were offended by these statements will accept our apologies. President John S.

Those of us who feel that the world ovves us nothing, feel that you, in fact, owe an apology to the following: The President and Board of Trustees of Union College, The student body, the Jewish community, the ''rich people\ of Long Island (who build hospitals, nursing homes, colleges and li:~boratories) and the six million who perished so that you coUld have the op- portunity to write!

Charles D. Frier Union Alumnus Class of 1927 Why Not Register? Of late I have been becoming increasingly annoyed at the r>roiiferation of inane. arguments against registration for the ·draft. I am \pr~ registration\ and I have found rnost all objections to a registration short-sighted and not supported by fact or logic. I consider myself to be a fairly patriotic individual and upon receipt of my draft registration notice shortly after my . .seventeenth Birthday, I unhesitatingly sent in my signed form, and, all too promptly, several weeks later received my official draft card m f,he mail.

The Chapter has raised $200 for Amnesty Internation,al, as well as $120 for the Union College Chapter. Many individuals have requested information on Al's stand with respect to the _:;ituation in lran. AS a result, the following excerpt is being reprinted from Al's position sheet on Iran: 1) What is Ars position with respect to the deportation of the Shah? \lf any country threatened to deport the Shah to Iran where he would be liable to face execution, Al would be bound, under its statute and in ac- cordance wit-h its policy of strict political impartiality to oppose any such deportation. . . . The fact that Al was highly critical of hwnan rights violations under the Shah is irrelevant to Al's view that he should not be returned to Iran where he is likely to face the death penalty.'' 2l What is Al's position on the deportation of Iranian students from the U.S.'? \A l's concern is that in- dividuals should not be forcibly returned to countries where they may face political im- prisonment, torture or the death penalty. This may be as true for Iranian students in the U.S. as for the Shah.\ 3) What were Al 's concerns under the Shah'? ··A 1 is on the record throughout the world as having exposed and condemned the grass and systematic violation of human rights under the Shah. . . . On several occasions in the mid-70's the Shah himself admitted to foreign journalists that torture took place in his country. However. in 1977, he gave a personal assurance to Al Secretary General M·artin Ennals that torture had stopped in Iran. But an Al mission that visited Iran in November 1978 con· eluded that the torture of prisoners had not stopped. In a statement issued by Al, Mr. Ennals accused the Shah of gross hypocrisy and said Iran had reneged on its undertakings in international law. Iranian governmental reaction to Al was openly hostile. At one point the government threatened to cut off all trade with companies in Holland if the Dutch govern- ment did not prevent an Al meeting on human rights in Iran from taking place in Amsterdam in early 1977.\ However. A 1 still systemqtica lly opposes the deportation of the Shah. Al has repeatedly appealed to the Iranian authorities for the release of the U.S. hostages. They are being arbitrarily detained in violation of Iran's obligations under international human rights law and of the international lega·I requirement to extend special protection to dipiomats. Al has used both public and private channels to convey its concern to the Iranian authorities and, most recently, cabled foreign minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh to confirm that its representatives would be available to meet him. Mr. Ghotbzadeh was in contact with Al for many years about human rights violations in Iran under the Shah, but there has been no reply from him to Al 's latest message. Al is now currently concerned with the human rights violations prelavent in Iran since the overthrow of the Shah. Violations have occured despite the fact that Iranian representatives have acknowledged publicly that the Islamic Republic of Iran remains accountable under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified by the previous government in 1976. Since the February 1979 revolution, Al has been collecting information on cases of people tried and sentenced before the country's Revolutionary TribunalS. Hundreds have been sentenced to death and executed without appeal after trials that did not guarantee full rights of defense. others have been sentenced to the punishment of flogging, which is cruel, inhuman and degrading. These acts are clear violations of Iran's existing human rights obligations. Following two fact finding missions to Iran in April and May of last year, Al began work on a report covering the human rights situation during the first seven months .of post- revolutionary Iran. The report, which is now being finalized, will be submitted to the Iranian government with Al's recommendations. Senate Foreign Relations Committee: Hearings on Human Rigbts Treaties Four treaties, which are essential for the international protection and promotion of hwnan rights, were sent to the Senate by President Carter in Feb; 1978. The .senate foreign relations committee hearings are the first step for Senate advise and consent to treaty ratification. The public hearings were held Nov. 14-19, and elicited broad public support for U.S. par- ticipation. Among those organizations testifying for the treaties were the American Bar Association, the AFL-CIO, the NAACP, AI, the National Council of Churches, the Luthern Churches and others. Theaties included two International Human Rights covenants, The American Convention on Human Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Racia I Discrimination. Clearly, U.S. ratification would encourage other coun- tries to follow suit. Ratification would provide a single set of standards for use by the Congress and Executive in their hwnan rights policies. More importantly, ratification would signify to other countries that U.S. commitment to human rights is not just the com- mitment of one administration, but is a permanent fixture of · U.S. foreign policy. It is too early to forecast the prospects for prompt ratification, especially due to two emerging problems. First of all, the current world events may cause human rights ccncerns to be shelved. The more immediate problem is the · difficulty of Congressional action on any but the most immediate crisesas the election campaign season enters full swing. Inaction will be most unfortunate. The door to ratification is now open. The Al Union Chapter appea]s to members of the Union Community to contact your respective congressmen and urge the ratification of these four treaties. Recent violations of hwnan rights serve to reinforce the need for ratification. Dissidents throughout the world con- tinually attest to the fact that international accords have helped them within their own countries. These accords become scales by which dissidents can monitor their own governments compliance with the growing body of in· ternational law.

The United States can no longer negotiate from a position of strength for we are already comprimised. Of caurse our constitution insures our individual freedoms, but one should take their thinking one step further. What has insured the fact that the constitution has remained a viable document? The hard reality is that Americans have had to \fight for their country.\ By \fighting far their country'' they have in reality been defending ·the economic, political, and social stability of the free and \semi-free\ countries of the world. Those ·Americans sacrificed to provide an atmosphere wherein the free countries could conduct their affairs with minimal threat Regarding the question of oil, the hard reality is that by the mid-1930's the U.S.S.R. will be · net oil importers. I cannot help · but become more than a little concerned in viewing a map of the Persian Gulf region, taking into the consideration the strategic position of Afghanistan and the ability of a country which spends 10~15 percent of its GNP on the military to pay its oil bill, sitting temptingly close. Peaceful and universal condemnation of the U.S.S.R. by all of the Arab countries did nothing to mitigate the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, but I can't stop thinking that tbe U.S.S.R. would have at least thought twice if the U.S. had a stronger . strategic hand to play. Even if we could field an effective military force in only a slightly: longer time, registration has more extensive ramifications. In a world where probably 90 percent or more of our allies have compulsory conscription and increasing instability in strategic regions seems pet·· vasive, registration would be an affirmation ofour willingness to ·fulfill our commitment in the eyes of our allies. Registration does not necessarily mean draft and will bring us no closer to war. If we need to field an army, it will happen, registration or no ' registration. The point is that it will play a much larger role in the political scheme of things. This letter is by no means a \pro-war\ statement. Needless to say, I wouldneverwantto see any of my friends or myself go to war. However, I feela c.-:rtain need to be at least willing to defend the right for people like ourselves to carry on a dialogue like this one. War is a tragic event, best illustrated by our mistake in Vietnam, hut in- telligent people do not draw sweeping conclusions from mistakes, they alter their method of thinking and h~arn from them, as I think most everyone did, especially our political leaders and decisions makers in Washington. Sincerely, Michael Bacco '8:0 P.s. May I also point out to Mr. Auerbach and Ms .. Engel that in order for votes to be tabulated, people first need to register in order to vote.

Alternative To The Editors: Last week a letter appeared in your newspaper urging, in an emotional appeal, for the campus community to take an anti-draft stance. We would like to take the opposite view. But how? It is very easy to be against something. · but very difficult to be FOR it. What do we call our stand? \Pro-draft?\ No, that implies that we are pro- war, and nobody wants war. \Anti-anti-draft?\ No, that implies a personal vendetta ag~inst those opposed to the draft. We are trying to deal with this issue logically, without undue emotional appeals. We will simply say \We support President Carter's call for registration for the draft at this time.\ Why are we writing this letter? To express an alter- native pi1S$ibility to the one of last week. It was, as we've said. a highly emotional appeal. without much factual background. We feel that making a decision on the basis ofsomeone ELSE'S emotions is WRONG, especially in an issue as important as this one. Therefore, we are urging the Union community to examine the facts and the two opposing views-and then make your OWN decision. Once you've done that, what can you do? Well, we feel that protests, pickets, sit-ins, etc. on either side won't do much good. We've come up with a few suggestions: 1) Write to your Senators,. Congressmen, and President, expressing your support,or lack thereof·, for the draft registration. We feel that this ·gives our voice the most airing, be that voice pro or con. (By Concordy's straw poll last week, we seem to be more pro.) · 2) Talk to your schoolmates. Talk to ·us. We. are always willing to hold logical, open (and maybe public) discussions of this Lssue with both sides. How-ever, don't come to talk emotionally charged, out to \convince us we're wrong.\ We are not out to convince you; we just want to talk out the facts and views-both of them. Our view is this: that tbe draft registration does not necessarily mean a draft. It is a precautionary measure designed, not to promote war, but to maintain peace. The wars of this century have shown that totalitarian regimes tend to advance and. expand when they feel th1;1t they are npt up against a strong front, but do not against such a front. The draft registration is the first step in a strong front. For the first time in a decade, we have said to the Soviets. \we are willing to stick. up for something we believe in-our way of life,'' We feel that this is threatened. We feel it was . threatened in Anp;()}a, but we did nothing then. We are now. Even if no one else will take the step, we must. As shown by the Olympic boycott, many countries look to us to lead; they all agreed to the step, but only if the U.S. did. Maybe if we take this step, others will follow again. But we don't want war; we are no more \warmongers\ than the letter-writers last week are. Therefore, if you disagree with us give us a viable alter- native. We have yet to hear &f one that meshes with the following: FACT: There are tensions with the Soviet Union and Iran at the present time. No matter how much we hate them, they · are there. SOMETHING MUST . BE DONE. Carter saw something he could do, and did · it. If you disagree with his position, come up with something else, but tthe fact remains, SOMETHING MUST BE DONE. Ph. R.m.

Al is now currently concerned with the human rights violations prelavent in Iran since the overthrow of the Shah. Violations have occured despite the fact that Iranian representatives have acknowledged publicly that the Islamic Republic of I ran remains accountable under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified by the previous government in 1976. Since the February 1979 revolution, Al has been collecting information on cases of people tried and sentenced before the country's Revolutionary Tribunals . Hundreds have been sentenced to death ana executed without appeal after trials that did not guarantee full rights of defense. Others have been sentenced to the punishment of flogging, which is cruel, inhuman and degrading. These acts are clear violations of Iran's existing human rights abligations. Following two fact finding missions to Iran in April and May of last year, Al began work on a report covering the human rights situation during the first seven months of post- revolutionary Iran. The report, which is now being finalized, will be submitted to the Iranian government with A1's recommendations. Senate Foreign Relations Committee: Hearings on Human Rights Treaties Four treaties, which are essential for the international protectien and promotion of human rights, were sent to the Senate by President Carter in Feb. 1978. The Senate foreign relations committee hearings are the first step for Senate advise and consent to treaty ratification. The public hearings were held Nov. 14-19, and elicited broad public support for U.S. par· ticipation. Among those organizations testifying for the treaties were the American Bar Association, the AFL-C10, the NAACP, Al, the National Council of Churches, the Luthern Churches and others. Theaties included two International Human Rights covenants, The American Convention on Human Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Racial Discrimination. Clearly, U.S. ratification would encourage other coun- tries to follow suit. Ratification would provide a single set of standards for use by the Congress and Executive in their human rights policies. More importantly, ratification would signify to other countries that U.S. conm1itment to human rights is not just the com· mitment of one administration. but is a permanent fixture of - U.S. foreign policy. It is too early to forecast the prospects for prompt ratification, especially due to two emerging problems. First of all, the current world events may cause human rights concerns to be shelved. The more immediate problem is the difficulty of Congressional action on anv but the most immediate crises as the election campaign season enters full swing. Inaction will be most unfortunate. The door to ratification is now open. The Al Union Chapter appeals to members t1f thP Union Community to contact your respective congressmen and urge the ratification of these four treaties. Recent violations of human rights serve to reinforce tht> need for ratification. Dissidents throughout the world con- tinually attest to the fad that international accords ha\'e helped them within their own countries. These accords becomr scales bv which dissidents can monitor their own governments compliance with the growmg body of in- ternational law.

Constitution by ANDREA BOWERS The Student Forum Con- stitution Drafting Committee has completed _a preliminary draft of the proposed Con- stitution of the Student Government Association of Union College. On February 18th, the~ Student Forum held the first in a series of \discussions concentrating on the docwnent as a whole. Forum members were asked to propose specific amendments to the proposed new Constitution by February 29th. Procedure for proposal and adoption of the Constitution as a whole will follow the old Con- stitution in the following manner: PropDsal-''Two-thirds of the Student Forum may vote to propose -an amendment.'' Adoption--\In a formal referendum, in which fifty percent (50 pet.) of the Student Body must participate, two- thirds of the total number of votes cast must favor adoption of the amendment.\ Amendments will be discussed up to the date of April 7th, at which time the Forum will vote on the document as a whole. During the week of April 7-14, reactions will be taken from the student body through dorm meetings, etc. By April 14th, changes will be made, \but only if Forwn members feel that student opinion is strong enough to warrant any.\ By April 17th and 18th, the Forum hopes to take a referendum to the Student Body which would ratify this Con- stitution. It is hoped that by providing a report on this document in its present stage, the Student Body will have been exposed to it and perhaps formulate some im- pressions on it, so that when formally asked to respond, they will have seen the topic ()f discussion. Therefore, any and all input on behalf of the Student Body is encouraged. It is reminded again that this document is not in its final form, but it is naturally ex- pected that it will serve as the foundation for the final Con- stitution. The series of discussions by the Fonun, and ultimately student response will shape the document tDwards its final form. This is the moment, then, for students to acquaint themselves with the document and to ar- ticulate their impressions. The following will not be a duplication of the proposed Constitution in its entirety, however, the author has at- tempted to extract those principles of the Articles and-or Sections which at·e most relevant to the Student Body. Proposed Constitution of The Student . Government Association Of Union CoHege ARTICLE I. (NAME) The name of this organization shall be the Student Govern- ment Association of Union College. ARTICLE II. (PURPOSE) The purpose of the Student Government Association is to consider issues and to review, recommend or formulate policies (as appropriate) in areas primarily or exclusively involving the Student Body. Such areas shall include, but not be limited to; matters of student affairs, academic affairs and extra-curricular affairs,. The Association also seeks to provide extended channels of communication, increased areas of cooperation and a greater acceptance of shared responsibility between the Faculty, Administration and Student Body in matters of general and academic interests. ARTICLE III. (MEM- BERSHIP) All matriculated un- dergraduate and graduate students of Union College are members of the Student Government Association. All matriculated full-time un- dergraduate students currently paying a student activities fee are voting members of the Student Government Association. ARTICLE IV. (ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STUDENT GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION) SECTION 1. The Student Government Association (SGA) shall be represente-d , by a President, a Vice-President for · Administration, a Vice- President for Finance, nine (9) class representatives, and two (2) .student Trustees. These fourteen (14) individuals shall sit and vote on the Student Forum. The President and the Vice-President for Administration shall also ,serve as members of the College Conference Group. Three (3) class representatives (one from each class) shall sit and vote on the Student Affairs Council. SECTION 3. The President of the SGA shall chair all meetings of the .Student Foriun and shall serve as an active liaison between the Student Forum and the administration of the College. The President of the SGA, or the President's designee, shall represent the Student Government Association at any in- tercollegiate student govern- ment conference in which the Student Forum chooses to participate. SECTION_ 4. The principal respensibility of the Vice- President for A\dministration of the SGA shall be the general administration of student ac- tivities and · organizations, in- cluding Student CorriiD.ittees. SECTION 5. The principal resoonsibilitv of the Vice- New Board At WRUC by ANDREA BOWERS Union College's Radio Station, WRUC, held its elec- tions last Monday night where their six chief executive positions were passed on to current executive ·board members and DJ's alike. These' offices indude: General Manager, Program Director, Special Program Director, Business Manager, Station Manager and Technical Director. It should be noted that the position ef Special Programs Director was created the same night, before the WRUC members cast their . ballots. This amendment to the station's Constitution was initiated by Tom Talbot, the station's current Program Director who ex.pl~ined that the distinction \between special programs (including new.s and sports) and regular weekly shows must be more clearly ' defined in the creation of the position ef a Specia1 Programs Director. The meeting began with the station's current general manager, Peter Raymond, delivering a final speech to the staff. In his speech- Pete outlined some of the general improvements that WRUC has witnessed during tire past few years.Hedisctissed the dilemma that the station has had to confront: that of the obligatien to meet the -demands of an audience while also recognizing Proposed , the individual's effort to explore his own creativity. The op- portunity to explore one's own creative inclinations is granted to the student who commits hi~sel~ to a student activity whrch 1s also a volunteer ser- vice. In alleviating this inevitable dilemma, Pete Raymond pointed out that the station has striven towards a standardization of the station's facilities. By eliminating as many technical snags as possible, this provides a better sound for the audience and also frees the DJ ~rom- operational concerns. The attendance at the elec- tions was extremely en- couraging as compared to past years. A GRAND BRAVO to all departing board members and a welcome to all incoming staff. Uriion College can certainly be encouraged by the commitment and dynamism that WRtJC has displayed. President for l<'inance of the SG A shall be the annual budgeting and monthly auditing of student activities and or ganiz a ti ons, including Student Committees. SECTION 6. The nine (9) class representatives shall ·represent their respective classes on the Student Forum, the Student Affairs Council, the standing Student Committee on Committees and the standing Student Finance Committee.

A Student Trustee is designated the \Junior Class Represen- tative to the Board of Trustees\ during his-her first year and the ''Senior Class Representative to the Board of Trustees\ during his-her second year. The two Student Trustees shall represent the Student Govern- ment Association in all fWlc-- tions of the Board of Trustees specified by the By-Laws of the Board -of Trustees of Union College, The two 'Student Trustees shall also represent the Student Government Association in other ways that are agreed by mutual consent to be appropriate. SECTION 10. The terms of office for all elected representatives of the Student Government Association, ex- cept Student Trustees, shall begin and end on the ninth Friday Qf Spring term.

McNutt Bill Ross Peace Group by WILLIAM HALLGREN and EDWARD ALBRO The second floor conference . room of Carnegie Center was the scene Wednesday, Fe6ruary 20 of the organizational meeting of the Union Working Group of the Albany Peace Coalition. Organizers Ted Behar and Margaret Shue presided over a- group of approximately .thirty interested students. Behar began the meeting by setting forth the arganization's general purposes, after which the group launched into a largely in- conclusive discussion of registration in general. The overall purpose of the Albany Peace Coalition, reported Ms. Shue, is to block reinstatement of registration, a project which \depends on nwnbers\. Thus, the Union group \wants to raise the consciousness of alot of people on campus and let them know what's going on with the APC,\ in addition to educating them on registration and the draft. As alternatives to war, the group· wishes to promote the set• tlement of international disputes, especially those in- volving the United States and the Soviet Union, through negotiation. Mr. Behar stressed the importance of faculty in- volvement and support in the group. Mr. Behar proposed the institution of the following committees with which to further these goals: Purp_ose, concerned with the designation of goals for the org~nization; Proposal, to draft proposals to be presented to the group as a whole; Publicity, to make the campus aware of the group's activities; Newsletter, to in- crease campus awareness of military and draft related issues; Faculty Involvement, attempt ro gather faculty support; Fund Raising; and to coordinate group activities .. Ms. Shue acknowledged that ''(The discussion portion of) the meeting di<ln't get too far\ largely because of the heterogeneity in opinion of those present.\ There's a lot of confusion about stands on registration,!' · Ms. Shue says, ''Some are opposed to registration, some want registration, but are opposed to dr~ft.\ In addition, the discussion tended to stray into unrelated topics, such as oil conservation. The meeting ended with the announcement of a second meeting on_ Wednesday, March 5 in Carnegie and the visit of a guest speaker, Mr. John Cutro from the Albany parent group, tentatively scheduled for the 11th of March.

The talented artist Leila Blake, an award winning Australian actress, is the acting and voice (·oach for the production. The Three Sisters .is a play produced by cotlege students.

Founded in 1965, the Melos Quartet has achieved in- ternational fame as a premiere chamber music ensemble. Most recently, Peter G. Davis of the New York Times said of the group's latest recording of Debussy and Ravel quartets, \One would hardly expect German musicians to respond so naturally to such quin- tessential Gallic music, but these four string players from Stuttgart provide superbly integ-rated performances of exquisite tonal refinement, all lightly brushed with just the 1 right sort of poetic lyricism.\ Melos Quartet violist Her- mann Voss says, \It has taken us years to achieve real unity.

The German ensemble now gives about 120 concerts a year and its reper- toire-in addition to all of the string quartets of Beethoven, Bartok, Schubert, and Cherubini-includes works of Haydn, Mozart, Brahms, Verdi, Donizetti, Wolf, Pfitzner, Debussy, Smetana, Kodaly, and Janacek. · Concert Tickets are $5 for the general public and $3 for students and are available at the Schenectady Museum, Nott Terrace Heights (telephone 382- 7890 or 372-3651); Community Box Offices at Colonie Center · and the Empire State Plaza; and at the door at 7 p.m. the night of the concert.

In addition to acting in this term's play, The Three Sisters, by Anton Chekov, !ylillet also plans to teach a theatre survey course and to organize summer Cabaret and theatre programs. Millet describes his Spring term theatre course as one for ·'ignorants\ - those who have little or no background in theatre. Millet will provide an overview of the history and theory of drama and the principles of set design, acting, and directing. He hopes to show these principles in action through visits to Broadway, local, and college theaters. The course will study three plays in particular, one Greek, one Shakespeare, and one Modern. Millet's primary objective in teaching the course is to \pry student's minds open,\ dispelling standard miscon- ceptions about drama and giving students a new per- spective on theatre in general. Probably Millet's most ambitious plans are for on- campus entertainment during the Summer. He hopes to establish a Cabaret which will run four nights a week, Wed- riesday through Saturday and involve Union college students, area residents, and professional Guest Artists. In addition, Millet will be producing three independent plays, probably drawing on much of the same talent involved in Cabaret.

Milstrey Becomes Chronicle Editor Susan Emerson Milstrey no longer has to cover the \cola and candy .bar\ shifts that go hand in hand with newspaper reporting. The · term, used to describe the eatpon•the-run pace. of a reporter, brings to mind a series of past experiences that nav:e led to the quick rise of Ms. Milstrey's position from editorial clerk on the Times· Union in 1976 to editor of Union's Chronicle as of Jan. 7, 1980. In her junior year at SUNY Albany, Ms. Milstrey spent Friday and Saturday nights writing obituaries and rewriting press releases for the Times· Union. By January of the following year,. Ms, Milstrey, now a fulHime editorial clerk, carried on her regular duties while gaining course credit and writing . a daily column called \The Bulletin Board\ that covered community events. For over a y~ar Ms. Milstrey spent Sunday nights as well as her regular Monday through Thursday hours writing feature stories. This experience led to her job as a reporter for the Times-l)'nion in February of 1978 . She was assigned the suburban beat in Schenectady County and covered zoning board meetings, police matters and town meetings ·daily in addition to writing articles for the Sunday Times-U nil) D. A move to Saratoga County in January 1979 prompted a change in jobs f.rom the Times· Union to The Saratogian, an afternoon newspaper. In January 1980, Ms. Mlistrey was appointed Editor of the Chronicle. Besides taking on the responsi.biUties that being editor entails, she writes the press releases that go out of Union as Well as contributing to the Union College magazine. One of the nicest parts about journalism, according to Ms. Milstrey, is the constant op- portunity to meet people and the \anything-but-routine\ days she has put in as a reporter. Journalism is a very deman· ding job that requires the ability \to handle the English language.\ Though it is not a romantic jo 'b a la Woodward and Bernstein and there are constant fluctuations, a good story, ·according to Ms. Mils trey, makes all the craziness worthwhile.

Professor Lambert believed that the American Studies Board was trying to absolve themselves of all responsibility in this matter. Professor Schneller said that this was time for leadership and that EPC should assert its authority, thereby forcing the American Studies Board to decide whether or not they wish to continue the program. Page 9 :~i :· '} >- ForunJ. Representative Andy Mitchell said that the Forum was interested in both the quality and the. content of the courses. The Forum recom- mended following established procedures for accepting course credit, and suggested that all such courses be labeled under category 1 'X\. G.enerally speaking, though, the Forum was in favor of the proposal. Rrof. Eugene Schneller, Division II Representative to EPC. Professor Schneller opened the discussion hy asking how this program would affect the total education of the student. He mentioned that if no liberal learning credit were to be given that the students would be using these courses as free electives and therefore not have to take the courses over and above their Union credit load. Constitution Proposed. • • Professor Lambert said that there was ampte precedent at Union (.referring to the fact that Unipn used to grant credit for Army ROTC), and he further related that some very fine colleges give some credit for work of this type. He remarked that there was another question to be considered, though, and that is in relation to the liberal education. Lambert noted that \free electives are not merely picking up a course here and there.\ These courses afford the student the opportunity to \broaden or deepen his or her knowledge fundamentally in the Arts and SCiences.\ Professor Wilson asked if there was a considerable growth in ROTC, and what the distribUtion of students looked like (i.e., whether most or all were engineers). Professor Milillo asked how many ROTC students remain in the service for ten years or longer. The two students, representing the program, replied that there were still only a few· students participating in ROTC (12), and most of them were in the technical fields. Most students do not remain in active service, however many do stay in the civilian service. The final topic discussed by the eommittee was the future of the American Studies Program. Professor Warde began by pres.enting a memo from Professor Terry Weiner (Chairman of the American Studies Board) which stated that the Board would not begin to-- discuss the future of the Continued from page 4 E) the authority to review all policy recommendations eminating from the Student Affairs Council and the Academic Affairs Council.

OONOORDIENSIS, February 28, 1980 Page 11 5port6 A View· From The Stands by DOUG SILV),!;RSTEIN With the College playoffs approaching the nation, here is a sneak preview of top teams from the East and Mideast, and tbe key players on each team. This year is so .exciting because although one team is undefeated, DePaul, they do not seem to have a-clear advantage over the rest of the pack. So this year is unlike, the others in that the national championship is almost unpredictable. I have evaluated a large number of teams because in addition to the fact that there are so many good. teams, the slots for the NCAA tournament have not been submitted. ·· EAST The major forces. arise from the ACC and also Syracuse, St. .Johns and Iona. At press time, Maryland had won the ACC and Svracuse looked the best of the rest. This region includes two of the countries best coaches, Lou Carnasseca and Dean Smith. This once maligned region looks the strongest it's been in years. Duke-had a very · sluggish year and after being No. 1 they fell to below 1\' o 1 (). But they have GmiQski a. center and one of the nations' best shooters in Gene Banks, so they're always a threat. Early season inj1:1ry to Kennv Dennard did not help the Blue Devils' chances. Virginia ... a. very good team hampered by the fact that the offense is built around a sen- sational but inexperienced freshman, Ralph Sampson, the team's center. Jeff Lamp, a streak shooter, could be a discovery for the pro scouts. Cavaliers will probably have to wait another year. Maryland-the big surprise of the year led by jun'ior Albert King, who finally cam.e lnto his. own. He is supported by sharp shooter Ernest .Graham and agile center Buck Williams. Greg Manning; the ballhandler, developed immensely this season. Coach Lefty Oriessel may work players to the ground, but the efforts have paid off. Good bet for quar- terfinals. St. Johns--cannot express what kind of jo.b Lou Car- nasseca has done. With Reggie Carter leading an experienced crew, this team .seems to rise to the occasion, as it did against Louisville and Syracuse, but they also fold in the crucial moments. Genter Wayne McKoy improved vastly and Ron Plair can shoot the eyes out of the ball. Could meet Syracuse later on in rematch of early season thriller. Syracuse-everyone's bet for final four, with maybe the best six man team, in country. Union Lacrosse Team presents: \ANOTHER HENRY PARIS E~TRAVAGANZA. · Paris is the King of \Pleasant Porn:.

Coach Jim Boyheim has made lis aU forget Ray Danforth. A team with unlimited potential. North Carolina--have a fighting chance because front courtman Mike O'Koren is the best at his position in nation. AI Wood, who plays guard and forward,· played best games against Clemson and Wake Forest. Although they're hlghly ranked, they are a longshot. N.C. State-Hawkeye Whitney must carry this team. He is relied upon to score, a lot. This team, like North Carolina, Duke and Virginia, did not win ACC so it must hope for a bid. Whitney is a portrait to watch, win or lose. Clemson-a team of no\names that quietly sneaked into the top twenty. Did not win ACC, but will probably receive a bid. They're a strong contender for final four because they play defense as good as anyone. Iona~late season surge and impressive victory over Louisville brought this team national acclaim. The Gaels are lead by center Jeff Ruland, who played poor against weak Army team but dominated against powerful Louisville club. Kevin Hamilton and· Glenn Vickers offer ample support, and this Long Island dominated team is the perfect sleeper, ala Hofstra a few years back .. Mideast Like the east, a strong and diverse region. The area features No. 1 DePaul and Notre Dame, L.S.U. and KentHcky. Some of the best shooters reside here, and this · should be the most exciting region in the country. The draft wHI include many from the top teams in the Mideast. Notre Dame--a great com- pilation of personnel that jells at times and not at others. Han- zlick and Branning are the best back coqrt combo in the country, but even with Tracy Jackson and Kelly·Tripucka up front, something always goes wrong. Woolridge and Paxsm~ are adequate, so the failure of this team to perform up to its potential is a mystery. bigger Phelps must ignite this club, which could \be knocked out early .if not careful. DePaul-the story here is no losses, Hay Meyer and sen- sational sophomore Mark Acquirre. The support, though not in big names, is excellent. C0ach Ray Meyer has waited thirty plus years for this one, and only a major upset will keep this team from the final four. Indiana -seasan was in two parts, with and without Mike Wc()dson. With the center, they were unbeatable. He is back and playing well after a back injury. Landon Turner and Rat Tolbert, in addition to being excellent defensive stars, picked up valuable offensive experience i~ Woodson's ab- sence. Bobby Knight breeds controversy and his r;nethods . seem rather crude, but he produces winners and,. could ignite any team. Another one of many dark horse candidates. Kentucky-won SEC with a recent win over L.S.U. Kyle Macy is best point guard in the country, and coach Joe Hall receives the maximum from the Wildcats. Macy played his best game on -national television · against UCLA. Sam Bowie's suspension put the freslunan center right in line, and he can· be devastating. Always a candidate but possibly a little too weak. Ohio State-another team with a supreme guard, Kelvin Hamfiey. He has carried this team through a season that has been dissappointing at times, but one that Is a threat. They could win the Big 10 with a strong finish. Two biggest wins were against a stubborn Wisconsin team. Herb Williams is a ·valuable .scorer and is s·orely needed for support. Another longshot. Purdue .. ·with center Joe Barry Carroll's abilities and worth declining as the season progreBsed, this . team fell sharply in the polls. The second ,half of the season was rather dismal at times, in that they lost to teams like Northwestern. Arnette Hallman is the player who pulled through in. the late moments. Obviously, their . whole ·performance rests on that of Carroll. Louisiana State-easily the flashiest team in the country. DeWayne Scales, who missed last seasons' playoffs due to conflicts, will be back this y~ar after a sensational but obedient year. Durand Macklin and Howard Carter are excellent, especially in the waning moments of a contest. Rudy Macklin matured tremen- . dously, pouring in big games against conference rivals Tenessee and Auburn. You'll have fun watching this team, and in addition, they could very well make it to quarters. Late season loss to Kentucky cost them the SEC crown. Obviously, I \have only in- cluded the teams that I feel will have a viable chance at the national championship. Please correct me if I have omitted any. NEXT WEEK--The MID- WEST and the WEST. If you've got the time, we've got.the beer. Miller Athlet.e Of The Week The Recipient of the Miller- Athlete-of-the-week is Carol Wrenn a sophmore guard on the Women's Basketball team. Carol comes to Uniun from New York Cit v. where she ·' played her lngh. S\.'ho('; ball at · Lovola. She has Deei~ a con- _sistent performer all year for the continually improv·ing women's baskrtball tP.a,m. Her major cont•·ibut ion to the team is ondefense, where her aggressiveness and hustle consistly create havoc for op- ponents. On numerous oc- cassions she has forced hard passes by oppenents and has come up with the loose ball. The - playmaker is a joy. to watch as she sets up many a fast break for the scoring advantage. Coach Lynn Barta says, \Carol is a good team player and play maker. She really makes things happen out there.\ In her last 3 games though Carol has found the scoring touch and bas averaged over 10 pts. per game, In the Capitol District Tournament she was high scorer with 12 pts. in a ·tournament opening win over a powerful Skidmore team. In the final game of the tournament against St. Rose she again played well in a losing effort. Carol'~ outstanding play in the tournament she was named a member of the All-Tournament team by the opposing coaches. Miller Athlete of the Week Carol Wrenn

Page 12 .OONOORDIENSIS, Febrtwry 28, 1980 eporte Icemen Down Westfield by MATT KAYNE & RICH DECKER When you're 9-14·1 and sitting in 11th place in your division with three games remaining, if you have any h()pes at all of making it to the playoffs, you've just gotta· win. That's the position Charlie Morrison and the Union College Skating D'!ltchmen found themselves in this past Saturd~y night at Achilles Rink ... and they came out of it successfully with a 5-4 victory over the Owls ot Westfield State. In its second year of Division II play, Westfield State had amassed a 10-6 overall record, good enough to place them in 5th place of the Western half of the division. Union, 6 notches below Westfield prior to the game, seemed to be overrated on :paper, but not on the ice. \Every game now is a play- off,\ said head coach Charlie Morrison. \They're all must win situations if we want post- season play. Everything from here in is sudden-death.\ however, just moments later on a convincing power p'iay goai by senior Paul Bracken. With the score knotted at 1-1, Scott Fitzgerald was called for an elbow, his 90 and 91st minutes in the penalty bo~, and . Westfield once again seized the opportunity as senior Jim Collins sizzled a slapper by Dave Josephson on the latters left side. It seemed to be \another one of those\ going into the second period, but it was not to be.· Morrison knew it,. the Skating Dutclunen knew it, the crowd knew it. In one of their strongest scoring blitzes of the season, the Garnet tallied 4 times in the opening 12 minutes to take what should have been a com- manding lead, 5-2. The goals, coming from Tod Fabre, Scott Fitzgerald, and two from scoring leaders Bill Mason (his 14th and l~th goals) seemed to momentarily put the game out of touch. 11:30 of the period, could Union ward off the later's offensive onslaught. The Datchmen failed,. however, to capitalize on any ·of the power play op- portunities. - At 12:56, the Garnet jeopardized their .playoff bopes witb a riduculous penalty; too many men on the~ ice during a power play. Bill Mason further added to the tension already in the air by g~ingoffforhooking attbe 14:04 mark. Union, however, suc- cessfully stymped Westfield's offense and thus kept alive then hope for a playoff berth. The Dutchmen olltshot Westfield . 42..:31, . with Union netminder saving 27 and Tom - Connors saving 37 for Westfield. Union now stands at 1M4·1 m their division and the Dutch!nen are still in playoff contention. Union next faces t.he .New Haven charges on Tuesday night at 8:00p.m. in what will be their Iast home game of the season. / Senior Dave Josephson makes the glove save. Perhaps those very words sparked tbe Flying Dutclunen onward to victory just as these very s51me phrases had miraculously spirited the USA into a gold medal in hockey. But, when a slow pass off of the stick of Bill Mason was intercepted by Brian Cox. who put it into tne nets, 'the lead was whittled down to 2. And moments later with Jim Josephsoninthe penalty box for holding, Westfield tallied for their third power play score of the night, this one coming off of the stick of Paul Bracker, his second goal of the evening. Cagers Win 2 Of 3 Whatever the case, the Flying Dutchman came out skating and swarming to the puck. It took the Gamet 9:21 to get on the board as captain Mark Haley continued his scoring streak with a wrist shot from the right side during a 5 on 3 advantage. Westfield came right back, Moving into the third period with a slim 54 edge it appeared that Gamet had their hanc;ls tied with the offensive play of Westfield.

INDOOR TRACK SWIMMING March 1, Cap. Dist. Championships at Union Feb. 28, 29 & March 1 N.Y. States at Rochester The Union College basketball team had a strong showing last week winning two out of three and picking up coach Bill Scanlon's 100th victory in his seven years of heading the Dutchmen. The team picked up wins against Babson and Elmira and fell ·short versus Potsdam to bring their r~_cvrd to 12-10 ·\with two games remaining. Last Wednesday, tbe Dut- chmen were overpowered by a strong Potsdam squad. Pot- sdam (21-3) came out running and gunning and jumped ahead quickly 17 to 2. Union fought back with scrappy defense finishing the first hall down QY ten, 35-25. ,, The Dutchmen continued to lose ground ln the second half as Potsdam poured in pllints on numerous well-exee11ted .fast breaks. Potsdam's balanced attack proved to be toomuc11 for the Dutchmen. The final score was 75-56. Joe Cardany led Union scorer§ with 20 points. Derik Rowland and Ed Jechim paced Potsdam's attack with 20 and 14 points, respectively. Friday night, Union hosted Babson College beating them in a tight contest 66-64. Babson (9· . 14) is not having a very. good season, however, they gave Union a hard fight. lJ rtion jumped out to a quick 10 point lead, but Babson chipped away at the deficit little by little until they tied the game at 42 just before the half. Union was not at its best, suffering from poor ex:ecution and an unaggressive defense, yet Women 2nd In Cap. Dist. The Union College Women's Basketball team had a strong showing in the Capital District Tournament last week finishing second to St. Rose. Albany State finished third and Skidmore placed last. Un.Wn's first round game was played against Skidmore College with the Dutch women coming home victorious 48-40. The women led at half time 26- 21 and managed to hang on to the lead by playing aggressive defense. Carol Wrenn paced Union with 12 points while Patty Hamilton added 10 points and seven rebounds and Sandi Key chipped in 6 points and 12 rebounds. The win placed Union il1 the finals against St. Rose which beat Albany State by 2 points on Friday. The game against St.. Rose was an lip-hill struggle for the Dutch women. They got off to a slow start and were down by 1~ points early in the first half. By playing aggressive defense, both zone and man to man, the women ate away at the St. Rose lead and managed a one point lead at half time. The score went back and forth throughout the second half until the final two minutes·when St. Rose took a 5 point advantage on two baskets and a .free tlirow. Sf: Rose held onto its lead and the final tally was 61).51;. - they managed to keep the game close throughflut. The .score see- sawed over the closing minutes and was knotted by Babson with one minute left to play. Union . ran the clock down to 14 seconds and then called a time out. The Dutchmen set up their last play, a double screen low for Car- dany. Mike Canning hit Cardany with a pass in the corner and he dropped a jump shot with seven seconds remaining. Babson got the games final shot but did not convert it. Caraany led all Union scorers with 20, while Montinelli and Krwn added 14 and 10, respectively. The Dutchmen entertained Elmira (the nUIIlber two seed in the Division III· ECAC's) Monday night and sent them horne with a 61-4.8 defeat. Again . plagued with poor .offensive execution in the early goings, Union overcame this short corning late in the game to pick apart a tight Elmira zone defense. The key for Union was its tough and aggressive defense which forced Elmira into turnovers and bad shot selection. Sophomore Jim McGhee had a strong night on the boards for the Dutchmen taking down 11 rebounds .. Uniort led by eight at the half but Elmira cut it to three with 10 minutes remaining. Then Cardany returned to the game after being taken out .for foul trouble and Mike.Canning carne up with a big steal to boost the Dutchmen's lead. The final score was 61-48. Cardanybad 24 for Union. Free throws: ++The win versus Babson was coach Bill Scanlon's lOOth victory in his seven years coaching at Union. -Although Union failed to qualify for the ECAC post season tournament, they have beaten the number two and number three seeds in the tourney during regular season play. The Dutchmen beat number two seed Elmira last Monday by 13 and nwnber three seed Hamilton by 22 earlier this season. -The Dutchmen end their 1980 season on the road against rival RPI on Wednesday and Cor- tland State on Friday. 1ft Junior John \Count\ Montanlle Pol B The nowh the G. heart: the A mirac USSR Eric gold and< street comp sense almo: last s The mosp Olyrr assur Placi overt weell meat globe Un toacb Prior Olyrr Ice F wasi agai: Skati witm than victo spiril on tt A the A chi awai two Vold thEd of tl brot: othe resu defe pres V< of tr. in Ji Gan mac whi• of h bro1 and Nov you: Vol nati
