After all, they have many Third World countries that they're aligned with in various ways. By JOY RUNYON The Soviet Union, because it courts the Third World as the United States does, is playing a variety of roles in the libyan crisis: ideologist, non- supporter, moralist, politician, image-maker. Because some of these roles contrast inherently, the Soviet Union's involvement is a complex one. Robert Sharlet is a Political Science professor who has also served as a government advisor on Soviet political events. As an eminent Sovietologist, his in- sights on the Soviet involvement in the Libya crisis shed light on what the newspapers have lold us. His insights reveal many political nuances that com- monly escape the eye of the casual observer. JOY RUNYON: In the Ubya crisis that's going on right now, have the Soviets declared any preference as to the United States or Ubya, or are they siding in ideology while remaining netral in action? ROBERT SHARLET: Just to recapitulate the Libyan-soviet relationship in the past few weeks: When the first en- counter occurred in the Mediterranean between the United States Sixth Fleet and Libya over the so-called Line of Death, the United States warned the Soviet Union that we would be testing that line. On that occasion, before we moved our carriers into position and responded to Libyan missiles, the State Department informed the senior Soviet diplomat that we would be doing this, and they pulled their people back, away from the missile sites that were going to be hit. They also sent one of their ships out to sea just in case there was going to be any spill- over into the ports. So they clearly distanced themselves from that first encounter.

Let me answer the ob- jections raised by Professor Murray and other writers below. Were there any alternatives to the bombing raid? What alternatives did Impact of Economic Sanctions Detailed By BRADLEY G. LEWIS In the wake of the U.S. attack on Libya, our allies in Western Europe have suddenly rediscovered a weapon that most of them have left unused: economic sanctions. More precisely, the sanctions often labeled \economic\ are really economic and diplomatic, in that some of them, such as closing libyan embassies, have economic implications but are initially changes in official relations. The distinction is important. Consider the case of Taiwan. It is not recognized by the United States, but that has little commercial impact- people, goods, and money flow freely between here and there. Some diplomatic steps may have considerable value in themselves: closing an em- bassy makes it much harder to bring grenades into a country in diplomatic pouches. However, the steps considered here are those which are primarily economic-bans on some or all imports or exports, refusing to let one's nationals work in Libya, bans on commercial flights, etc. Can such sanctions work? The evidence is mixed, but it is important to be precise about the conditions surroun- ding them. Have Sanctions Worked? President Reagan have at his disposal? Our allies had already refused to do the minimum in imposing economic and diplomatic sanctions. Only after the raid, probably to deter future U.S. strikes, did the allies respond in a constructive way to the threat from Libya. Without economic or diplomatic weapons, and stepped up anti- terrorist defensive strategies already in place, the President had to choose from among several military options. He could have ordered a naval blockade of the Gulf of Sidra and tightened the economic noose around Qadaffi. However appealing this action seems, it almost certainly would have produced a con- frontation between Soviet and U.S. ships. Qadaffi is not worth another \missile crisis.\ Some sanctions, historically, Another option was to employ have worked well.

Page2 CONCORDIENSJS, May I, 1986 NYS Legisl~ture Considers. ·South African Scholarship Fund Deputy Speaker Assemblyman Arthur Eve Sharlet: ByPAULSCHOP Bipartis~n support has for- med behind a proposal in the New York State legislature that would enable economically disadvantaged black South African students to attend college in New York, so that they may obtain an education that they otl;lerwise would not be able to obtain. The proposal, bill number 10,863-A in the Assembly, and number 8414-A in the Senate, would create a $500,000 scholarship fund that would award 60 scholarships worth $7,500 apiece to black South· African students, to help defray . the cost of their education here in New York. Potentially, some of these students could matriculate here at Union. In Qadaffi Miscalculates Soviet Support Continued from page 1 the neighoorhood of three to six thousand military and technical advisors in Libya. They moved a great number of those people away from potential targets and they moved ships that are normally berthed in Libyan harbors out to sea. The implication of this is that they want to preserve the line of communication with the United States, which has been open since the summit last November. In fact, we know from the first encounter that the Libyans were quite annoyed in that confliet over the Line of Death because the Soviets would not assist in the operation of the missiles, nor did they share with them satellite in- telligence from their flights over the Sixth Fleet. They gave them no assistance whatsoever. In the second encounter, it was more of the same; the Soviets adopted a hands-off policy, they stayed quite aloof, and as the American fleet was steaming towards Libyan waters to carry out the retaliation for the disco bom- bing, Colonel Qadaffi made statements to the effect that possibly he would have to call in his Soviet ally, or even the Warsaw Pact, to assist him with the United States attack. The Soviets were very quick to rebut that. Their top man in the United States rebutted in English, very plain language, saying that Colonel Qadaffi sometimes does not speak the entire truth, that the Soviet Union has no intention of in- tervening, and that the Warsaw Pact is not involved in this. So they were very conspicuous in their absence. The very least they could do, then, was to cancel the meeting between the ·secretary of State and their foriegn minister scheduled in May that would prepare for the June-July summit. That was almost a minimal response, especially after the bombing resulted in . civilian deaths. It's a very, very slight diplomatic rebuke, because there are rnany other channels through which they can talk to the United States. So what do we have in the last few days? Gorbachev is in East Berlin for a Commmist Party Conference. He uses the oc- casion, predictably, to condemn the United States attack on Libya. But at the same time, in the course of his stay in Berlin, he sends very clear signals that he's ready to resume talks with the United States. He puts out a new arms proposal, and at the end of the conference, he says that if the United States will amend its adventuristic policies, it would pr-obably be possible to talk. It seems clear that they have adopted a hands-off policy as far as Libya is con<!erned, in terms of active pe~rticipation. They have administered a diplomatic rebuke to us, which is fairly mild, as these things go, and they have given a clear green light that the summit. should go on, though it may not occur now in June or JUly. But it may occur later in the year, which would actually suit their timetable, because there is nothing to be decided in June or July. Gorbachev does not want to go home empty-handed again. JR: So if Reagan had gone along with Gorbachev's moratorium on 11uclear testing, would things have been any different, even if we'd pursued the same colll'se ()i action? RS: I think they still would have condemned us. There's always been a tendency for the United States and the ·Soviet Union to conduct discourse at the superweapon level. -On one hand, each carries on its operations in the Third World; on the other hand, they do it independently. I think that even if we had agreed to the moratorium, they still would have felt obliged to diplomatically rebuke us, cancel the meeting, and so on, because they have to show their Third World clients that they're not entirely indifferent to their fate, though they don't want to get embroiled in their affairs. They're very much over- extended throughout the world. Contittued on page 4 Williams Imparts Praetical Information Details Publishing Process Continued from page 1 this advantage as he has progressed. Mr. Williams is not only a well-read, literary editor, , but is a shrewd businessman as well, and was as prepared to discuss what is happening at the rival houses as he was in elaborating on the projectE currently underway at Put- nam's. Mr. Williams spoke t& Profess<Jr Smith's Creative Writing class twice during his week here, about how to get work published, what the publiShing process. is like, etc. He was eld:remely honest about the problems that a young writer faces in getting his-her work published; but at the same time was not discouraging. He was able to give the class practical information down to the minutest detail of how to type a manuscript, and remembering to send self- addressed stamped envelopes for the return of the work. None of these concerns expressed by the students seemed too trivial· for him, and he was more than willing to spend a gr-eat deal of time on these questions, as wel1 as on the broader, more ab- stract ones. Mr. Williams also spoke tc other classes, as well as various groups, including the staffs or the Idol and ~ocQrdiensis .. These were also informal discussions, which centered more on the process <Jf editin& and publishing and what kinds of employment opportunitiew are available to the graduating student. In these discussions, too, Mr. Williams was perfectly willing to discuss the minor details of the procedures to give his audience a eal sense of what goes on behind th~ el()sed doors of the publishing b!Juses. Along with vi,Sits to clas8es and discussions with specific interest groups, Mr. Williams found time to have lunch with small groups of students and faculty. These lund1es gave the people involved a chance to discuss publishing and editing even more informally with Mr. Williams, and to delve more deeply into issues that were not of interest to the larger groups. In aU, Mr. Williams was at all times available to interested persons, and was willing and able to explain all the com- ponents of publishing in whatever detail necessary. For anyone who made it a point to take advantage of ~r. Williams' availability and willingness, his week at Union was extremely educational, not only intellectually, but prac- tically. ~ Meet lmpor1ant People See four Name In Print Write for CONCORDIENSIS order to be eligible for tttis grant, a student must be a black South African and he or she ' must have a sponsor who will pay for the student's tran- · sportation to college.

In order for a bill to be eligible for a vote in the New York State legislature, it must age for three days, that is, it must sit on . each member's desk for three days, when it has its third reading, and after which time it may be considered. Under special circumstances, this procedure may be waived by a message of necessity from the governor, which allows the bill to be voted on immediately. The Assembly is currently waiting for the Senate to act on its bill, which at the time of this ar- ticle's writing, it had not yet · done. The concept behind this program originated last year, when Eve met with Bishop Desmond Tutu in New York City. Tutu was in New York to establish a scholarship fund for black South African students. The supporters of both bills believe that the unique situation in South Africa today justifies this action. They are hopeful that this proposal will be anacted this session. With such powerful sponsors as a top ranking Democratic Assembly leader and the Republican chairman of one of the most powerful committees in the Senate, it woulrl appearthat this is likely to happen.

Union Joins SELP Loan Program By JON COHN The rising costs of tuition for students each year has initiated the search for ways to pay these costs. Tpis last year, the financial aid department at Union, as well as other colleges in New York have looked into the Supplemental Education Loan Program, or \SELP\ Program pf Chase-Lincoln First National Bank. The program has been created as an alter· nate form of aid to the traditional loan programs of the past. The. \SELP\ program is aimed generally at upper- middle class families; though applications from other income groups are considered. The Financial Aid Office at Union categorizes this group as being a two-parent family, earning around $75,000 per year. The problem with this income bracke~ is that these people are in between being qualified for 'financial aid and being able to meet tuition costs without aid.-- The people who make this amount but live in a high-tax area, probably will not make enough money to have college tuition money set aside. To take some of the pressure off, SELP is used. The new aspect of the SELP program is that the burden of .::ollege payment is distributed between the parents, students and the. college. Union and Chase-Lincoln , have an · agreement where Union in essence \buys down\ the in- terest rate of the loan, by creating a financial base. By doing this, the student also avoids consumer loan interest rates, which this year reached 16 percent. The loan is a guaranteed aid package, which the student then co-signs with the parent through the bank. The Chase-Lincoln Union loan program also has advantages over federal loans, because of the amount that the student can receive at once. Most federal loans are groups of smaller loans, which the student has to collect together to meet the tuition. The advantage of SELP is that the student can receive up to $5,000 ·immediately, avoiding the paperwork· and qualification problems of the smaller loans •. Union has just begun offering this aid program to the fresh- man class of this coming year. They will check the applicants for credit stability, and then distribute the loans. Unfor- tunately there is only around $100,000 worth of loans that can be distributed, so the system is on a first-come, first-served basis. People already in college and interested in loans should see the F AO before the end of the year. Economic Sanctions Incur Costs Continued from page 1 Forum Questions V aloe of Proposal Concordiensis Plans to Circumvent though military in execution. For the moment, let us assume that this is not a step that European nations would be willing to consider. Moreov~r, it does not seem at the moment, a very good o~tion for the U.S., in part because it requires a continuing military con- frontation, in part because of the effects on third parties. Sanctions of other types have had mixed results. Sanctions imposed against South Africa and the previously white government of Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia, did not even stop trade, including the trade with other African countries nearby whose opposition to these regimes was most pronounced. Sanctions may have raised the cost of apar- theid to those regimes, but the economic costs to nearby nations of actually cutting commercial relations were, in their opinion, too high. U.S. sanctions against Cuba are widely believed to have hurt that island's economy (for example, by preventing spare parts for machinery from being obtained), but Castro is still in power. The Israeli economy is of the Libyans? If the behaviot· contmues, but at a much higher cost to the Libyans? What if there are long run changes, but none in the short run, or vice versa? We ought to determine which of these we really seek. We cannot ignore, either, the costs to those imposing the sanctions. The Costs of Sanctions Sanctions that are effective almost · certainly will have significant costs, at least in the short run, to the country im- posing them. There are at. least two major reasons for this. First, the sanctions are likely to reduce some activity which is at present probitable to both sides. If the activity is not profitable, in this case, to Libya, the Libyans have no reason to worry about its cessation; if the activity was not profitable to us, we probably would not be engaged in it now. The cessation of commercial transactions is therefore likely to be costly to both sides. Continued from page 1 In his proposal, Marin an- swered criticisms. As stated by Marin, \I have. heard two arguments against this proposal that I should address. The first is that a three week election campaigning period will place too much of a burden on students running. I have four responses to this: 1. Candidates are not required to begin t11e process any earlier than under the old system. 2. Most cam· paigning will probahly be done in the last week anyway. 3. The only possible increase of time demands would be the posters. . 4. Students who are cam- paigning for positions of student leadership must make the time to dedicate themselves.\ \The other argument I have heard is one that questions whether or not a three week campaign will actually increase student awareness and in- terest.\ \My feeling is that this will be largely up to the candidates running. If they manage to come up with reasonable .ideas and useful comments, then this will attract attention. Despite its inadequacies, the Union College student body seems to have a pretty good knack for separating the intelligent from the in_ept.\ Marin concluded in his proposal, \I believe that a great deal\ of benefit can be derived from this new system in the form of a healthier and more productive election atq mosphere, one that will provide for wiser campaigning, smarter · voting, and more interest in campus affairs. At this time when students· are becoming more involved and concerned, we would do well to encourage and to utilize this fresh breath of PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT HOSTS LECTURE DR~ ROBERT POLLARD UNION COL.LEGE ALUMNUS (180) WILL DISCUSS ,,PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE HEARING IMPAIRED: IMPLICATIONS OF LANGUAGE AND CULTURE\~ COFFEE AND DONUTS WILL BE SERVED BEFORE THE TALK.

Following the proposal's defeat, Marin comrilented that Concordiensis will now procede to conduct a media campaign on its own, without the help of the .

On the other hand, asking whether sanctions are effective requires a definition of ef- fectiveness. If we intend to divorce ourselves from behavior we find repugnant, then our imposition_ of sanctions may work by definition: we have intended to cleanse our- selves of the guilt that comes from associating with a wrongdoer. It is doubtful that that is a sufficient reason for imposing further sanctions on Libya, so we might consider more ambitious aims.

This does not mean all sanctions are futile: air piracy has been much reduced precisely because the advantages of preventing skyjackings are significant for more than just a few countries.

Indeed, . several of our European· allies . have significant trade with Libya-reportedly $4 billion for Italy, $a billion for West Ger- many, $1 billion for France. Moreover, some citizens of these countries work in Libya, often repatriating part of their earnings. The basic costs as Westem Europeans see them are probably as .follows: 1. Disruption of oil imports. I do not take this seriously, but I have read the argument that France, especially, could be crippled by a cessation of Libyan oil imports. The idea that the oil could not be obtained elsewhere is unconvincing (to put the matter politely) when most oil producers are pumping much less oil than a few years ago and prices have plum- meted. At most, the costs are those of transporting oil a bit farther and making new arrangements. 2. Loss of exports. Asswning that goods are not simply funneled through third parties to Libya, reducing exports would cost some European jobs, and unemployment rates in France, Germany, and Great Britain are above ours, despite what was, until the recent decline of the dollar, an ideal export atmosphere for these countries. My own guess is that the export jobs are more im- portant to most European countries than the oil imoorts. 3. Loss of future business. Europeans may believe that imposing sanctions will allow others to take their markets, or that such an action will damage their business prospects elsewhere in the Arab world. The first is possible, but only if the sanctions are not effectiV'e, and the Libyans would find it quite difficult to obtain goods of equal quality at the same price outside of Western Europe and the United States. The second argument is a crucial one, but too complex to discuss here; if true, the costs to Europeans could be high, and the U.S. might lose Arab business as well. Can Sanctions Work? Let usr assume that the aim is not merely syni,bolic, but that of raising the cost of supporting terrorism so that the Libyans do very little of it. Probably this aim does not require steps ~hich are completely effective in savaging the Libyan eccnomy: it may require cut- ting off eno11gh of its extra in- come (especially from oil) to ma·ke the populace choose 1Jetween a decent life style and support of the terrorists. Other radical regimes might like to s11bsidize the Libyans, but they will be hard pressed to do so: their own oil revenues are down. Perhaps the Soviets would pick up the slack, but I find it linlikely that they would consider Libya a reliable client state, and the, cost ·of replacing a significant fraction of oil revenues would be high-in the billions of dollars. Libya is a small country with little to offer except oil in return for its im- ports; sanctions are likely to be more effective here than against a regime such as South Africa which is a dominant · ec()nomic power. In short, if Wel!;tern . Europeans and Americans agree to serious sanctions, they probably would work very well. However, 1 am skeptical of the· prospects for meaningful sanctions unless the United States is willing to use military opower' as a last resort, as well. Since sanctions are usually suggested as an alternative to the use of military power (and they could be, under the right • circumstances), this last statement requires some ex- planation. The U.S. Attack and the Li~elihood of Econ(}mic Sanctions The American attack seems t() have drawn two reactions, at least, from European opposition leaders and some governments. On the one hand, they have claimed that this was not the correct way to deal with terrorism; on the other hand, they have begun serious con- sideration of economic sanc- ti()ns. Why have they done so now? The reason seems to be that the expected gains and losses from their own policies have now been altered: one of the expected losses from con- tinuing business-as-usual with the Libyans is that they will lose many American dollars (especially from a drop in tourism)~ l>ecause of American disgast with (at least the publicized) European reac- tions. If this analysis is correct, however, it carries the <:l~ar implication that ruling out further use of military power will defeat even the possillility of getting agreeme.nt on workable sanctions. Until the attack, Ellropean governments (with the possible exception of Great Britain) bad not considered the use of either economic sanctions or military force worthwhile. Leaving aside the possibility that someon.E bad a secret plan for dealing with terrorism, there are two possible conclusions from t.his. The first is that European governments believed tltere was no possible way to recluce the amount of terrorism; if .so, they have already decided that sanctions will not work. The second is that they believe such a policy of sanc- tions would work, but at an unacceptable cost to them economically. If this is the case, the official imposition of sanc- tions likely would be ac- companied by an unofficial tolerance of good commercial relations . . . which, of colli'Se, would make the sanctions ineffective. I doubt that the United Stat~s government made its raids on Libya ehiefly to pressure Europeans into sanctions, but the raids seem to have had this effect. If this analysis is right, however, the imposition of sanctions by itself will accomplish little. In the longer run, I believe we can reduce terrorism only if we are willing to accept s<Jme unplesant consequences in the short run, and only if we are at least willing to use military force. The notion that the use of force never makes conditions better is not borne out historically, however attractive a statement to that effect: may sound. Force did stop Hitler and Mussolini; the unwillingness to use force does encourage dic- tators who are rational enough to calculate the costs to themselves even if they care nothing about the costs to others. The use of ecDnomic sanctions might help p~h. the Libyans not to support te~:rorism systematically, but sanctions are unlikely to work if we vow always to forego the use of military power.

He is both a lightning rod for Gorbachev is very concerned with Afghanistan as a drain on their resources and creating a multitude of diplomatic ' Soviet interests and an obstacle to more effective Soviet control over ,the political direction of that society. So I would say that problems for them in the .Third World countries, especially among Islamic countries. So they're very heavily involved there, they're involved in Angola, theY're involved in massive aid programs in many other regions of the world. They're trying to draw in a little bit because they're priority now is to renovate the economy, improve its technological readiness to move into the twenty-first century, and this is going to cost them tremendous amounts of money. This reassessment of priorities means that they don't need more overseas adventures. The Libyan thing could be an. open drain on their resourc-es. Hence, they're .going to remain aloof from the Colonel. In fact, I would venture to say that they would n.ot be displeased if the Colonel were overthrown by some of his colleagues and replaced by a military junta and replaced by a more compliant and rational group of military officers with whom the Soviets could do business, because they have problems with the Colonel, just as the United States is having problems with the Colonel. They would like to be able to use more of the Libyan port facilities, but Qadaffi will not let them because it would imply too much of a Soviet embrace. Now, if he were succeeded by more of the professional tYPe military officers, they might say, \Alright you can use the ports and we need these ad- ditional weapons,'' and so on, it they would be just as pleased as Secretary of State Schultz would be, if he were overridden in a coup or IClrlven into exile or· demoted or whatnot. In fact, the evidence indicates that this may very well be going on. JR: aut if Qadaffi were overthrown, doesn't it stand to reason that h~ would have someone just as mad as hjm.self waiting in the wings? RS: The pattem usually in the Third World is that when you · . have a monomaniacal leader such a~ an Amin in Uganda or a Qadaffi in Libya, he is usually succeeded by a collective leadership of military officers who are more restrained, with cooler heads. Usually, a period of calm and quiet follows an Idi Amin or a Muammar Qadaffi. 1 think the odds are that both the United States and the Soviet Union would be able to deal better with Libya with anyone other than QadaffL Oddly enough, the United States and the Soviet Union may have a common objective in that region for very different reasons. JR: When we tried to get the rest.of the world to join us in im.plementing economic. sanc- tions against Ubya, everyone refused except for England. If . we 'were now able to get an of Europe and some of Asia to join us, do you think the· Soviets would foUow suit if we started working less on a militaristic level, trying to paralyze libya Contined on page 5 Are You Bored at Union?

Britain, so they had to make the long detour. So something strange is going on. · Apparently, the l:Tnlted States has broken the ice by taking military action against the country which has aided and abetted terrorism, and now it's easier for West Euro.pean countries to begin eJq>elling PageS RS: Before tbe :Berlin bom.. · bing, we knew tb.e Libyans were going to do this because we read the cables, and the fact that the ,pte~ident revealed this very mUch compmmised the National Sectir-ity Agency because obvbusly, the Libyans would change their cl)des and those codes W<Hild have to be rebroken. But he felt that it was absolutely essential to · j~tify his impending action to the Americap pe()ple by showing that he had clear evidence. Since tne bombing, the West Europeans have been more forceful and have come to the assisblllce of the United States. More often than not, the terrorist attacks directly linked to Libya or to groups that are presumably being funded or sllpplied by Libya · are being carried out against Americans abroad;. but in Western Europe. There are a lot of Libyans and Palestinians who are students in that part. of the world. It'.s difficult to control them. . diplomats, maybe considering some economic sanctions, and . talking tough politically . because they're not out front · . and they don't become an im .. mediate target at the airport. I think the West Europeans feel a little bit easier now about following the lead of the United Why the U.S. Had. to Attack Libya But since we ])ad read the cables, we knew what was going on, and through diplomatic channels, we a:]Jproacbed both the. Soviet Union and the Ger- man Democtatic Republic where the Li~yan diplomats were planning . the attack in West Berlin. We asked them both to use tb.eil' ~ood offices to intervene and. pr~vent the Libyans from proceeding on this course of acti()n. It's not clear whether the Soviets or East Germans refused or rell).ained silent. My ~hunch is that tlley had no in- fluence whats()ever with the Libyans. The Libyans under Colonel Qadaffi have their_ own mind, have tlleir own wr,.y. I think the Soviets and the East Germans wottld probably rather not ackilowledge that they don't have suffiCient in:- fluence with thEi:r client state in North Africa to discourage them from cc:~rrying out the bombing of tbe nightclub. It doesn't show tnucb leverage or effectiveness. Rut the wllole history . of Colonel Qadaffi 1 s public .per- formance indicates that they don't do any bEtter with him' than the U11ited States does, that in fact tltey have more important things to talk to him about than the bombing of a nightclub in Eerlin, and they probably want t() conserve their political capital with. him for more important and serious things in terms of their relationship. V\'hatever, they either did n()t or could not prevent him from carrying. out the action in W' est Berlin. Even if we had succeeded in developing arr e(!onomic boycott of some kind ()n Libya, the Soviets would probably never participate, bEC!allSe there is an So the West Europeans ·. dragged . their feet; they · historically have dr.agged their feet on these things in the post- war period, Reagan was not able to get support from the • allies, except Mrs. Thatcher, wh()'s had her own. problems with the Libyans in Northern · I'teland. Then amazing things . happen. Britain's· actions were f()llowed by West · Gennany, · Italy, and France. - Apparently, the West European allies have had a meeting and have agreed to reduce the size of the Libyan diplomatic establishments in their countries because many of the Libyan diplomats have been involved in these other ac. tivities that are against the interests of France, Italy and so on. After the bombing, there was the predictable reaction: criticism of the U11ited States, and especially of the fact that the so-called smart bombs strayed quite a distance an~ killed unintended targets, civilians. Iii the midst of the criticism, we begin to hear through diplomatic backchannels that a <lOUple of the governments of West Europe are saying that we didn't hit them hard enough. This is amazing.

I would add that this is a sym- bolic exercise. It's not going to eliminate terrorism. But there's evidenc.e that Colonel . Qadaffi has been much more subdued. He wasn't seen · in public for several days, then ne was only seen on television., then his · regular army, which is known to include dissidents who are embarrassed by him, · were fighting in the streets with his revolutionary guards. .Even now, more than a week · later, he has not been in public making a fiery speech. His wife, who is bereaved, has made a stFonger public statement than the Colonel did. She said that, if she could managet() do so at the moment, she would physically attack the president of the United States. It was a far more . emotional, powerful statement, Something is. apparently going wrong. There's speculation that ColonelQadaffi may have to share power, maybe he's trying to deal with internal dissidents who are very upset that he has drawn this attack on Libya. Clearly, there's S()mething going on internally. JR: One more question: Does Qadaffi . have any nuclear weapons? RS: Not that I know of, and I don't think the Soviets would share them with him because he's a little bit too much of a ·loose cannon for them. The treaty against that is very much a product of both the United States and the Soviet Union. They're much too prudent to give someone who won't even let them keep their ships in his port on a regular basis, nuclear arms which mi$t get beyond their control. That would be much tol> risky, and the European nations would be in an uproar, especially if they were intermediate-range ballistic missiles that could .arc the Mediterranean and strike Southern Europe.

Clearly, the President was faced with the choice-in the short tenn-of doing nothing or em))loying the strate~ he in fact <:hose. Will the raid reduce the threat oiteuorism? · Professor Murray charges that \v-iolence begets violence.\ In the last few days his pi'ediction has been supported by events. No one, the President inelude(J, believed that the raid wo11ld reduce the threat of ten'orism in the short run. Quite tile contrary, the nation braced itself for a string of attacks here and abroad. The question is wllether or not the raid can help .prevent state sponsored terrorism in the long run. To this, I firmly believe, there can be only one answer; it can. The U.S. is able to do only so much t() prevent the attacks by fe~natics working ''free lance\ or o]lerating out of what once was Lebanon. But the large terrorist networks of Abu Nidal and others are trained, financed and facilitated by states such as SYTia~ Iran and Libya. These \states's must know that they will be held accountable for the actions of those criminals that tb.ey harbor. If the price is high enough they will be deterred. For those skeptics who trot o11t tlte \they said tile same thing about Vietnam\ response, let me say that the analogy is mt appropriate. Vietnam was at base a civil war, this is a case of states financing terrorists who are not their own nationals to attack others outside their borders. It is unli~ely that they e~re willing to risk their military :and economic strength to support them. Is it morally justifiable te risk. civilian deaths? Wasn't 4his a 1err&rist attaek as well? I guess to some purists, the bCJrnbing of Berlin was . a \terrorist\ response to the bCJmbing of London, but somehow I don't buy it. The Libyan connection has been POTENT-IAL CANDI,DATES: · · ..

Ifcivilians were killed as a direct result ofthe U.S. raid in my judgment, the person responsible for these deaths is Qadaffi. r. Certainly we would agree that anyone who sets out on a course of action which is so outrageous as to incur the wrath of civilized people everywhere, mu~t be prepared to accept the consequences of that action. It is simply not reasonable to hold ourselves accountable for the justifiable responSe of self- defense prvvoked by a mad- man. Are we attacking the symptoms and aot the cause of terrorism? Professor Murray alludes to the need to \dry terrorism up at its source.\ We do a disserv'ice to all those who struggled for freedom and li}Jeration without resorting to terrorism-or who had the courage to renounce it when employed in the name of the struggle-to see terrorists as having a \cause.\ Professor Murray also suggests that we try to resolve with diplomatic means the Arab-Israeli conflict and reduce the \causes\ of terrorism. He refers to the Egyptian .. Jsraeli Peace Treaty as an example of potential successes that such an endeavor might produce. · Unfortunately, the terrorists are opposed to any peaceful solution to the problem; they are financed by states that are committed to the destruction of Israel and have nothing but contempt for those who negotiate. Indeed, they have been responsible for nwnerous assassinations of moderate PLO leaden~ precisely because they considered the diplomatic option. One benefit of the raid might be to buttress those moderate Arab leaders who would like to enter the peace process but feu the radical elements sponsoreJ by Libya, Syria, and Iran. f certainly hope so.

One reason our allies m~~Y have been reluctant to support the raid is a fear that the U.S. does not have the resolve to \stay the course.\ If it i.s to succeed the U.S. must make it clearto all the states in the area that . open season on U.S. citizens is over. If a tie, indirect or direct, can be made the U.S. must act in ways that it sees fit- il,lcluding bombing raids and blockades. We cannot back down or this whole policy will collapse.

CONCORDJENSIS, May 1,1986 · FEATURES R.O.T.C. \Black Faced Mountain Sheep\ photo by George Gmelch from \Ireland: Through AA An- thropologist's Eye,\ Schenectady Museum. Photographic Perspectives of Ireland on Exhibit :By ALEX STEPHENS An exhibitation entitled \Ireland: Through an Anthr~pologist's Eye'' opened on April 6 in the Broughton Gallery of the Schenectady MU$eum.. It is a collection of the photographic work of Union's own Pr()fessor George Gmelch of the Anthropology-Sociology Department and is well worth a look. The exhibit consists of forty black and white and twenty color (>'hotographs, most of which were taken in 1975, the year Professor Gmelch resear~hed his PhD dissertation on the lrish Travellers. ·q'he photographs of the Travellers themselves were used in the books J .. M. Synge: In Wicklow, West Kerry and Connemara, published in 1980, and Gmelch's Irish 'rinkers: The Urbanization of an ltmerent People. He has also written and edited two other books on anthropology. His anthropological fieldwork took place in Western Ireland where tile culture and land has remailled relatively untouched by outside influence and thus provided him with beautiful scenic backdrops. His intimate relati()n::; with the people of his study allowed him to photograph them up close and personally. A group of four balck and white close-ups display tl;le weathered faces of · four Travellers (Irish Gypsies) with deeply lined faces and piercira~ stares. More of the subject matter include farmers and fi~hermen within their habitat, the rustic .living of the Itiner-ant Tinkers and the peaceful-small Irish towns. Photographs such as \Traveller Boy\ which cap- tures the gleeful smile of a young boy playing the ac- cordion in the doorway of his barrel topped wagon and \The Bellring~r\ . . a wonderfully lighted black and white of a man just in the process of pulling the bell rope, are a display of Gmelch'.s talent. ProfessorGmelch also has an eye for landscapes. There are four large color prints of the dramatic mountains and c9astal Scenery of Ireland. \Above CaraLake\ is one of the four and the most impr~sive, it captures the twilight of a bright orange sunset over an emerald green valley. Professor Gmelch used two 35 mm Nikon cameras with four lenses ranging from 28 mm to 135 rom. For those interested in viewing a professor's work or just interested in getting away one Sunday afternoon, the exhibit will be at the museum until June 9. · CA·MP UN'I(ON: .. 1986 May 31- June 1 LOOK FOR INFORMATION SOON!! movies, bands, food Planning meeting tonight If you can't come call Ira 6912 or Kim 6922 18th Annual By MINA MARTIN ' You may see one entering West at lunchtime, or one lurking on the floor of your residence hall. Maybe you'll pass by one oil your walk across library · field. Perhaps one appears_in your 9:30 class. They are always there, but on Tuesdays, ·they suddenly material~e in shades of blue, black, brown, white, and green. A glimpse of one may cause you wonder, and occasionally inquire as to the nature of these Tuesday creatures. Scientific evidence leads us to believe that these things appearing in your classes,. ,residence balls and cereal boxes on Tuesdays are ·in fact ROTC cadets. As Union's only freshman in the AFROTC -program at RPI, I occasionally get asked the purpose for my blue garb. Inquisitive minds J1()W . know that I wear a blue uniform · because I'm in AFROTC,. and usually that is all the ex- planation communicated before the inquirer and I have passed in our respective ways to classes. Comments such as \I didn't know the Army was for girls,\ led me to believe that there is not a general awareness of just what it is that \ROTC\ does. Perhaps this is due to the small number of Union cadets. There are currently 15 Air ·~Force Cadets ,. in'· the Air . · \'Foree:R-esenr&Officer Training · . Corps at RPt. \There are over 300 cadets in the corp, the majority of which are RPI students, but other students from area schools in the con- . sortium may enrol as a part of the corps. The purpose of AFROTC is to educate students in the customs and duties of the Air Force, while the students attend one of the 750 colleges and universities offering the program. The ultimate goal of ROTC is for the student to receive a degree and a commission as an officer in the U.S. Armed Forces. Many students do this through a scholarship which provides for tuition, money towards buying books, and payment of $100 - month. Under the scholarship, the first year is obligation-free, but attendance at the sophomore through senior year incurs a four-year service commitment. CHI ''BAKE'' Saturday, May 17 Ladies, get your Derby Day Teams! Promotional con·sideration sponsored by Miller Beer . ''Bake Time is Miller Time'' To answer the question, ''What does Union have to do with AFROTC at RPI?'' is not as easy as it might seem. There is no easUy accessible collective history ofoadet corps at Union. The accounts I found are in the collection of -old Concordiensis, Union has had some sort of cadet corps. ever since the ·Civil War. The accotmts of Air Force ROTC are occasionally meng tioned in the Concordiensis, but tbe very-day existence .of Union's Detachment 545, of 75 cadets, goes unmentioned just as today's at RPI. Therefore, · the main accounts of the proceedings of · Union's AFROTC defachment were du_ring a tinle of turmoil. - In the late 60's, the Con- cordiensis are filled with headlines concerning ·an all men's college trying to become co-ed, advertisements to see the Beatles at Proctor's for $3,25, and filled with pictures of students burning an effigy of Ni~on at the flagpole, long- haired young ~en holding up signs that read, \Peace\, and demonstrating , against U.' · S. involvement iri Vietnam. ROTC 'pops into this scene at this time. Nationwide ROTC units on college and university campuses are under fire. Most of the articles concerning ROTC are editorials, voicing negative opinions. At Union the Student Senate ineets on April 29, 1969, to vote 20-19 against ROTC with these suggestions: . 1) that ROTC be maintained as an ~x:tra-curricular activity · · 2) that no .:credit be giV'eh for · ROTC courses · · - 3) no Parade ·on Parents' Weekend · 4) that the Commissioning ceremonies be removed from graduation ceremonies - On May 20, 1969,. the Facu1ty Council votes, recommending not to give credit for ROTC classes. On July 24, 1969, the Board of Trustees decides to recognize the AFROTC program, but to give no degree credit for courses takeri. One year later, the contract that the Union AFROTC Detachment 545, is up for renewal. In the May 1, 1970 issue of the COncordiensis, it is announced. by the Assistant to the President of Union College, R. G. Bingham, that \the college received a letter from ROTC headquarters several weeks ago stating that because the enrolhnent in Union's ROTC program had so greatly diminished, the college had two options: either to do away with the program or to continue with only a two year non-scholarship program.\ It was not economically feasible for the Air Force to continue Union's AFROTC contract. · The article also stated that \a mail survey of the trustees was undertaken, and the· consensus was that the program should be abolished.\ It was· decided that the program would be continued until June of 1971,. so that the current juniors in the program could finish the remainder of their years· in the AFROTC at Union. Future members of AFROTC would 1lave to go to the datachinent at RPI. · Looking tl)rough old issues of the Concordlensls, I wondered if sotneone looking through old CoDeerdleDSes in 1997, will want to know about what Air Force ROTC had to do with Union fifteen years ~go, and if someone will still be running Into those Tuesday creatures, and still saying, \I didn't know ArmY w~ for girls!\

The Annie Schaffer Senior Center at 101 Nott Terrace wa1; converted into its present form in 1976 with the help of the United Way .and strong conununity support. It ·now coordinates many programs to keep senior citizens physically and socially active, ranging from card games to classes in electrical repair to travel throughout Europe. It means a sense of caring and friendship, a wann smile, a voice of respectful en· couragement. The program was designed to lay the groundwork for a mutually satisfying friendship. Janet interviews all prospective' 'Friendly Visitors\ to best match their skills with a \Friend\ who has special needs. She also arranges the initial meeting and then leaves it up to the individuals as to when they Will meet on a weekly basis. Thus the program maintains flexibility, based on a joint understanding as to where and how visits may take place. Janet stressed that although the school calendar inhibits a continuous cycle of visits, the Center can accommodate for Union's vacation periods ... people are trapped in the middle of this nightmare. These are Americans living abroad. Many. want to come home. but cannot. The lucky few who can are weaving a cirCllitous route home to America that leads them to Casablanca. Yes; they are off on the road to Morocco, and when they arrive in Casablanca, the first place they go to is still Rick's Cafe Americain, where a cold beer and a fake Canadian passport are always on tap. This is where our story begins. A tall, voluptuous blond, the kind that every man dreams of finding on some exotic American beach but never does (especially if he is looking for her on Jones Beach), enters. She is a desperate woman, being pursued by Libyan agents for reasons that for now are somewhat' obscure. 11 Rick, I'm so glad I found you. You must help me,\ she pleads. . \Calm down, sweetheart. Tell me your problem.\ ~'Don't you remember me. I'm nsa, we met in Paris seven years ago.\ \Listen sweetheart, don't say we met in Paris S() loud around here.

Save Lives Tomorrow Elections: Around the Corner - Disappointed in past Student Forum elections that have been marked by lack of participation and in· t~rest, Concordiensis Will this year make an attempt to boost the process. All students who are interested in running for offices, may contact Concordieusla early to gain publicity as soon as possible. 'PUs will provide a medium for the conveyance of new ideas and the clarification of campus issues. We feel that this will have three very positive ef- fects on the elections procedure. It will generate a greater interest in tile elections that will result in more candidates ruillling for various positions.

Page 10 CONCORDJENSIS, May 1, 1986 <!ID11fllrbtrttsis Foundnl at Umon Co/Ieee 1877 ------------ ----------- The Little Things Well, in the past few weeks, we nave certainly learned that the politics of a college are comparable to ''real world\ politics. Legislators get their brownie points and support by pushing major projects that give them name recognition. Politicians need to establish these kinds of identities to keep them in office. This results in major building projects and large sweeping reforms, while, in some cases, the \little things\ get neglected. For example, it is ·very rarely the case that decision- makers are noted for supporting a new road or highway. That kind of legislation doesn't make politicians stand out. At Union, the Morris administration prides itself on major building projects also. The reconstrttction of Carnegie and Alwnni Gym have been outstanding. Everyone recognizes that the focus on a strong physical plant will greatly improve Union. In ad- dition, lots of time and energy has gone into these projects. However, sometimes minor projects seem to be neglected. Aside from the new road that leads to the Nott Street entrance, we can't remember the last time a campus road was resurfaced. It seems as if every spring the trucks with the black tar come out to fill up the pot holes that form the preceeding winter. The result of this is that campus roads end up looking like a patchwork quilt and are difficult to traverse in a smooth fashion. We applaud the large building projects, but it would be great to concentrate on \little things\ also. Elections: Around the Corner Disappointed in past Student Forwn elections that have been marked by lack of participatioa and in .. terest, Concordiensis will this year make an attempt to boost the process. All stadents who are interested in running for offices may contact ConcordieDiis early to gain publicity as soon as possible. This will provide a medium for the conveyance of new ideas and the clarification of campus issues. We feel that this will have three very positive ef- fects on the elections procedure. It will generate a greater interest in the elections that will result in more candidates running for various positions. Also, increased exposure and interest will increase student voter participation. And this will provide for a clarification of important campus issues. UnfortWiately, the Student Forum has chosen not to endorse this plan. We, however, feel that it is of ut- most importance to the student body to create an atmosphere in which a more healthy competition will yield the best possible people to fill the positions. Those wishing to kick off their campaigns early are encouraged to contact Concordiensis. We will do our best to provide equal and fair representation to all candidates. Therefore, it is important that all those who are running inform us and do not find themselves behind because of a lack of publicity. We are convinced that an extended election cam- paign conducted through Concordiensis will be ex- tremely beneficial in creating a stronger and better Student ForliDl. ~ . . •' . . .. . ' . . .

LETTERS Be More Selective To the Editor: I note pertaining to editorials that Concordy \reserves the right to reject letters that are libelous or do not conform to standards of good taste.\ Unfortunately, Jay E. Runyon's letter slipped into the paper on 24 April 1986 concerning Brian Kelly's article, \Judgment Day for Managua.\ I respect Ms. Runyon's right to express her political views. I cannot, however, accept the fas9ion in which she articulated those views. Although I do not know Mr. Kelly, I find Ms. Runyon's style inappropriate. Stating Mr. Kelly to be a .proponent of \rednickism\ who would be at a rally ''drawling, 'kill those god damn pinko fags! Those no-good Commies!',\ in addition to the other remarks, suggests that the writer fails to realize the quality and character of her letter. It also leaves the reader questioning the intellectual and emotional development of the writer. Permitting this type .of letter in Concordy is not oilly a personal attack against Mr. Kelly, but it leaves one to doubt the caliber of the paper. Although I disagree With the political philosophy of Ms. Runyon, all sides must be heard. In printing diversified viewpoints your paper has an obligation to edit or discard - personal remarks as expressed by Ms. Runyon. I write this letter not to defend. Mr. Kelly nor to criticize Ms. Runyon. Instead, I hope that the Concordy staff will be more selective in the letters and articles it prints. Sincerely, PaulP. Jesep Library Begins Amnesty Program To the Editor: Today, May 1st and tomorrow, May 2nd from 8:30 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Schaffer Library will offer delinquent borrowers the oppartunity to participate in a library amnesty program. During this time anyone who is in possession of overdue or stolen Union College library materials (books, periodicals, newspapers, phonodiscs, compact discs, calculators, staplers, rulers, etc.) may return them without fine or penalty. Individuals returning overdue books borrowed through Union's Interlibrary Loan oregram mav also do so with()ut penalty during these two days of \amnesty\. Members of the college community may make their returns in bins which will be stationed in the center of the library's main lobby for the duration of the program. Student volunteers will prepare receipts for those individuals who wish to have a record of those books they have returned. · Books will be accepted up until 11 p.m. Friday evening. All items returned after t'his deadline will be charged thecustomary fines. Individuals will still be responsible for lost or damaged library materials. This is a good time for the members of the campus community to search their personal libraries, attics, of- fices, car trunks, and cellars for these \long lost\ items and return them to the library. Mary Cahill Acting Circulation Librarian Schaffer Library Save Lives Tomorrow To the Editor: This letter is in response to Prof. Harry Murray's \ .... to the Shores of Tripoli.\ Is it the method of killing that makes it an act of war rather than an acto f terrorism? No. There is truly no difference between Quadaffi's soldiers flying over Washington and bombing a nightclub, or Quadaffi's terrorists planting a bomb in a nightclub in Germany frequented by Americans. The result is the same: a few American civilians and sometimes soldiers, are dead. An act of terrorism (especially when continued frequently) is a declaration of war and must be treated as such. Diplomacy might be a methDd of solving problems even with a nation that had declared war. But unfortunately, that is not the case with Libya. Rebel Without A Cause To the Editor: ConcDrdiensis is truly a rebel without a cause. I am not very fond of Union College, but reading your editorials does not make me feel any better. For two terms all I have read is unconstructive, weak criticism of the school, usually filled with statistical hogwash. Don't you think you are trying a bit too hard to feed off the anti~U nion attitude, hoping thereby to become our heroes on campus? Do you want to talk about things lacking at Union? Let me make two suggestions: individuality and a strong liberal arts education. These are more relevant and thought provoking than class size, litter, and parking tickets. One week's worth of \Freshman\ and \Personals\ reveal more relevant facts about Union than ten weeks of your editorials. Respectfully submitted, Kaveh Shiebani I was born and raised for half my life in the Middle East, and I feel that I know their attitudes well. Middle-Easterners are a group of extremely emotional, uneducated, and therefore easily persuaded people. Their leaders use the hatred of Americans as a method of unifying the people. A similar comparison is the strong sense of unity between Americans during the hostage crisis. The way they accomplish this task is to make America the blame for every evil in the world. Their hatred is \deduced\ through passion, not through reason. Prof. Murray suggests the use of diplomacy. But the language of diplomacy is one of per- suasion through reasoning. And persuasion through reasoning never overcame, and will never overcome conviction through passion. I must also point out that previous attempts of using economic and diplomatic sanctions have proven to be futile. The hostage crisis is an example of this fact. I am not by any means an advocate of violence. However, I regret to say that the nature of the people the American government is dealing with this case allows for no other alternative than to take the mcst effective action possible. To take such a strong action is a very difficult decision for America, the representative of the West, to make, and for a long time countries like Libya have taken advantage of this fact. The bombing of Libya might cause a few deaths today, but it might save the lives of many tomorrow. Sincerely, Kaveh Sheibani

Doctors in Outrage The reaction of these legislative measures from the doctors is that of ontrage. Doctors are threatening to move out of the state unless the restrictions are relaxed. Many doctors are rei\tsing oo take on new patients, and un- fortunately, are forced to practice defensive me~cine. This situation in Massachusetts is an extreme case, brought on by the political ambitions of one man. As a result of Dukakis' actions, the doctors are in a very tough position. They realize the disaster that would result from a strike, and their public image is being marred by their op- pcsjtion to the so-called \reforms\. In the light of this controversy, the Massachusetts public now view their doctors as greedy and overpaid capitalists. In my opinion, this new public image is a result of ignorance of the community. I do not deny that the cost of · health care is very expensive, but doctors do provide-.a vital service. More importantly, no other profession requires as many years of schooling at such a great expense and as much dedication to complete eight years of schooling and· in- ternship. By the time doctors C()mple~ their schooling they are in great debt (as much as $100,000). They also don't start earning money until they are twenty-nine or thirty years old . Doctors Deserve the Money I am convinced that qualified doctors deserve high salaries. Health care is essential for .survival and proper health care ·is essential if we are to improve the standard of living in our country. If we are to restrict the salary and aathority of doctors, then we should do the same for every · other high paid profession. The high paid professions are those which require s~ialized skills with intense competition. I look upon their high salarieS as a reward for years of hard work and perseverence as well as providing a highly specialized service. Future Trends Thus far I have mustrated the special case of government regulation in Massachusetts. I do not want the reader to get the impression that this will be what our health care programs will be like in the future. Health (!are in the United States is moving toward becoming corporate, like a business. The :;mall community hospitals are being replaced by large cor- porate owned and run multi- hospitals. If in fact I am right about this conviction, then the poliCies of Governor Dukakis is quite irrational with the sole purpose of satisfying the am- bitions of one selfish im- practical man.

This situation in Massachusetts is an extreme case, brought on by the political ambitions of one man. As a result of Dukakis' actions, the doctors are in a very tough position. They realize the disaster that would result from a strike, and their public image is being marred by their op- position to the so-called \reforms\. In the light of this controversy. the Massachusetts public now view their doctors as greedy and overpaid capitalists. In my opinion, this new public image is a result of ignorance of the community. I do not deny that the cost of health care is very expensive, but doctors do provide a vital service. More importantly, no other profession requires as many years of schooling at such a great expense and as much dedication to complete eight years of schooling and in- ternship. By the time doctors complete their schooling they are in great debt (as much as $100,000). They also don't start earning money until they are twenty-nine or thirty years old. Doctors Deserve the Money I am convinced that qualified doctors deserve high salaries. Health care is essential for survival and proper health care is essential if we are to improve the standard of living in our country. If we are to restrict the salary and authority of doctors, then we should do the same for every other high paid profession. The high paid professions are those which require specialized skills with intense competition. I look upon their high salaries as a reward for years of hard work and perseverance as well as providing a highly specialized service. Future Trends Thus far I have illustrated the special case of government regulation in Massachusetts. I do not want the reader to get the impression that this will be what our health care programs will be like in the future. Health care in the United States is moving toward becoming corporate, like a business. The small community hospitals are being replaced by large cor- porate owned and run multi- hospitals. If in fact I am right about this conviction, then the policies of Governor Dukakis is quite irrational with the sole purpose of satisfying the am- bitions of one selfish im- practical man.

A near capacity crowd filled !J) the Memorial Chapel on a warm ~ spring night, for a unique style t of jazz and rock music. The 26 ~ year old musician amazed the '0 audience with a solid hour of ~ original comp·ositions and ~ :?lassie standards. Jordan, who ;:, 0- released his first album, Magic ~ Touch, early last year, was the 0 first artist to sign with the a reformed Blue Note record company in over a decade. He opened the show with two ballads, including the jazz standard \My One and Only Love\. His original and ex- tremely innovative style of \Two Handed Tapping\ derived from his years of classical piano training, had the audience awestruck for the entire performance. It was interesting to hear members of the audience uncontrolably let out remarks such as OH WOW!, as Stanley carried those listening to a standing ovation. He then played an original piece off of Magic Touch called ''All the Children\ followed by the sixties classic \Sonny\. The next four tunes consisted of the Johnny Mercer composititm t• Autum Leaves\ \A Child is Born\ and the incredible ftnale of Thelonious Monk's \Round Midnight\ which rocked the Chapel. The audience demanded an encore and Jordan responded with a cut from his latest album, \Angel\ by Jimi Hendrix. A Princeton graduate, Jordan - was enthusiastic about this college tour. During an in- terview with him after the show Jordan discussed many of his musical influences. He said he chooses his covers mostly from songs of his childhood. On Magic Touch, he performs the Beetle's \Eleanor Rigby\ with a jazz style John and Paul must be impressed with. Even though the words are left out, Jordan says he still tries to feel the words as he plays, attempting to convey the feeling of the song. His jazz orientation stems from records which friends and family introduced to him. Jordan's jazz heroes include Dizzy Gill~spie, John Coltrane, Miles Davis, guitarist Charlie Christian, and Thelonious Monk. \I don't care who you are\ says Jordan, \you can learn something from Thelonious Monk.\ When asked about the future of jazz, especially early, classical jazz, he responded that \no matter what the style, it's important to A Night of Comedy ByLeATAJACKSON The Nott is hl)pping this term.

Come see student theatre at its best! have a sense of history.\ He proudly feels, as a young artist, a responsibility to pass that history on to the next generation. Jordan expects his next album to be out by this fall. He has done extensive musical work with computers, and his next album will reflect this direction. He will move away from the style of Magic Toucb, but if it contains the energy and . enthusiasm he displayed on his album as well as in concert, it should be another treat for music fans. Stanley Jordan gave a tremendously mystifying concert. His music was moving and extremely soothing to listen to, as well as a pleasure to watch. It is obvious that he has a tight grasp on his muxic and future pieces of his work should demonstrate this. His in- novative talent will make him a part of the same jazz history which he feels so strongly about preserving. lmprov,Music •• Theater! By LeATA JACKSON On Saturday, April 19, nine members of Mountebanks participated in an im- provisation workshop con- ducted by Mark Epstein. Mr. Epstein is a professor in the theatre department at Skid· more College. We started the day with ac-' ting warm-ups and a series ot trust games. These included counterbalance exercises, like those used in mime, which consist of pushing or pulling against a partner, using your weights to keep from falling. Trust games, in general, are designed to bring actors closer together, to help them relax with each other·and to feel more comfortable with each other. Another essential part of warming-up · is to relax the breathing and to concentrate on something around you to focus your mind on the task at hand. After warm-ups, Prof. Epstein chose a soliloquy from Christopher Marlow's Dr. Faustis. He explained that understanding the meter in Elizabethan drama helps in the interpretation of a speech. Becaus~ walking is one of the most natural rhythmic motions, he had us walk around the theatre, stepping in time, as we recited the speech. We were hesitant at .first, but as we became more sure of what we were supposed to do, we delivered the speech with much more conviction. \Now I have but one bare hour to live.

However, Metallica received an excellent response from the crowd in general, of whom a surprising amount seemed to know the material.

Acrobats Spring For Proctor's By RACHEL SIEGEL The Peking Acrobats from the People's Republic of China, under the direction of Mr. Liang Wei, put on a spe!!tacular performance last Tuesday night. The acrobats are actually a troupe of 170, however only twenty four were chosen to make the five month tour of the United States. Of these twenty four, only twenty are actually performers; the other four are helpers of some variety. On this particular evening the acrobats performed to a capacity crowd at Proctor's. The audience responded to their amazing feats of balance and agility with many oohs and ahs and much applause. The acrobats, who are between the ages of sixteen and thirty four, begin their training at eight or nine years old. The training certainly pays off! Each act (there were eleven in all} demonstrated the per- formers' greaf skill in balan- cing. The most spectacular feat was when five of the acrobats balanced on a pyramid of chairs. Each chair, with the exception of the first, was balanced partially on the previous acrobaL The whole thing was stacked so tall that the audience seated in the balcony had to tilt their heads to see the top! The segment of the show that protrayed the most amazing human agility was the eon- tortionist exhibitions of one young woman. She moved her body in ways that most humans could not even dream of. For her finale, she balanced five torches, one on her nose and one on each hand and foot. Perhaps the funniest portion of the show was the simultaneous spinning of seventeen plates at a time. The tremendous feat was achieved by one young man while his friend stood and watched him making comments and gestures throughout. The key point in this act was to keep all of the plates spinning at once. As the fifth and sixth plates were just getting started, the first would slow down and need another p~l}. Rather than pushing it hunself the young man's friend simply pointed out to him that it needed a push. This resulted in the man running back and forth !n an eff.ort to keep all the plates m constant motion. The whole thing made for quite a humorous and quite a spec- tacular act.

... Page 18 · CoNCORDIENSIS, May 1~ 1986 <Hnu cor~iensis PORTS Ruggers Very Physical, But Lose Tough One By CIIBIS SHERIDAN ''The ~hole game was an organized wa.r, '' said Union Rugby's co-captain John Friske after losblg to Buffalo State in the sec()nd. round of last weekenci's Upstate Rugby tournarnentat Windhover Park. The finlll score read 3-o in favor of BUffalo State, however, that score doesn't show Union's domination. Junior prop Rob Sharp agreed with Friske in the brutality ()f the game, \We physically b~at up on the other teams, especially Buffalo State,\ he said. \They had two people get .seriously· injured. They had five injury time-outs in the seco11d half alone. We so abused Euffalo State that they lost to Cortland (in a following game.r Unio11 Dominates Action ButComes Up Empty Union d()rninated most of the game but b.ad a hard time putting the ball into the try• , zone. The ruggers proved h()W 1 strong their defense was after stopping Buffalo from about one-meter out. As hard as Buffalo tried, every time they got the ball near Union's \try- line,. Union's defense tightenEd up like a knot. After being iiied at half-time, Buffalo made it to Union's 15-meter line, when a Union player was called for being offsides on a ruek, directly in front of the ~oal posts. It didn't take much for Buffalo's kicker to chip in the three-point penalty kick, the· eventual difference in ,the game. Union put together one last effort before time ran out on them. \Unfortunately time ran out on the winning drive,\ Sharp said. Senior fullback Tim Hopkins was a definite factor in the game. Every time Buffalo ~ot the ball in Union's end, it would come right back at them off of R·ug,gerettes Looking Good By J.OlLISSA MALKIN The Lad~ Ruggers took a surprisillg f()urth place in the Upstate \f()urnament this weekenc. It is the team's fifth season, and the first one that theyhavebadboth an A and a B side. Said co-founder Maureen O'Day, •ewe played our very best games ever this weekend.\ Sbe was not exaggerating. For the majority of the B side, it was the player's third game ever played, nevertheless, they succeeded in llolding the score tied, lZ\l~ in their first match, losing ()nly by a conversion in overtime. New players Patty Houmeil ami Shauna Bavar both s<med. trys. The A side played a strong game as well, with a very impressive run by Nora 1'utthel who scored for Union ir1! the second half. Cor- nell, wllich is a much older and more nperienced club was overheard to say of Union's team: ''You can tell they're new-they're still polite.\ Due to a piece of brilliant scheduling on the part o:f the tournament organizers, tile A and B sides were schedulEd to play their second game against eacl)_ other on Saturday. Tb.e A team then went on to play- on Sunday against the Genesseo Lady Warthogs. Patty Ricllards and Cathy Hawkes turned (JUt to be a forceful duo, with Ricllards jumping and winning most of the line-outs for Union,. and Hawkes running the ball d()wn the field literally througll the opposition., Coach Dave .Ben- ziger said he was pleased v.rith the way the team played. Captains Betsy Boutwell and Angie Burke have high hQpes for the ruggerettes to become a good, competitive team, but they emphasize that they don't want to lose perspective either. \We're still out there to have fun,\ and we caon't get S()tense aoout it that we stop cioing that,\ said Boutwell.

They lost to Buffalo State's B team, 3- 0, on a fluke penalty kick. They entered the second round due to a kicking display by Pat DiCierbo and University of Buffalo's kicker when the game ended in a o-o tie . .Much like a shootout in soccer, the two kickers took turns kicking field goals until one of them missed. Around the eighth kick, SUNY Buffalo's kicker missed a .tong one, but DiCierbo put it through the uprights for a Union 3-0 victory. Union's season is not over, however. This Weekend, the ruggers travel to Boston to compete in a tournament there, and the following weekend; Parents' Weekend, Union plays RFI. at home. Crew Captures Medals By GEORGIA SULLIVAN and ANNE MAUBOUSSIN This weekend the Crew Team travelled to Poughkeepsie, NY for the President ''s Cup Regatta. This presitgious event, held on the Hudson River, in- cluded Marist (as host), Iona, Villanova, Vassar, Skidmore, US Merhcant Marine Academy, Albany, Army, the women of Coast Guard, and Union. This Union program turned a few heads with strong finishes in every event. It was especially exciting for the founding members of the program who have been working for a strong, unified club since its inception three years ago. The day did not llave a promising start due to cold and rain. And the conditions only worsened through the morning, as the men's (drenched) Lightweight 4 powered down the course to place third in the event. The members of this crew were Chuck Blotnik (coxswain;, Ted Evelith, Steve Tulevich, Dave Gascoyne, and Matt Hopkins. After this event, there was a short delay to give the officials time to decide what to do about the conditions; they decided to have the boats for the next event launch. The Freshman Heavyweight 8, after paddling down to the start; were allowed to dump the shells of excess water. Yet, the conditions were so bad, that the shells took on even more water during the race, due to whitecaps on the Hudson. The excessive amounts of water caused the submergence of their shell soon after they crossed the finish line. These oarsmen (Allan Foster, cox- swain; Dave Greenlaw; Andy Bick; Rich Chandler; John Lovisolo; Art Spalding; Evan Lewis; Jeremy Lorge; and Kevin Rampe) should be commended for their levelheadedness in ·· this potentially disastrous situation. Launches were available to pick uptbe rowers and bring them to shore where showers and warm, dry clothes awaited them. The shell, itself, was towed into shore with no damage done. With the aid of a two-hour delay, the shell, as well as four of the oarsmen, recovered for the upcoming races. The delay was the result of the obviously unrowable conditions. The action resumed at 2:30 when the Varsity Women put a four together, to come ahead of two crews. The Junior Varsity, made up of the Lightweight 4, plus Chris Holmes, Tony Cor- sello, Bruce Szamansky and John Delconte, put in a strong showing, but marred by con· fusion in communication bet- ween the race officials and coxswains. Dried off and ready to row, the Men's Novice 4 was struck with e.quipment problems during the race, leading to a frustrating finish. The last races of the day were dominated by Union. The unknown Women's Varsity 8 (Kim Silvers, coxswain; Anne Mauboussin; Olivia Listzwann; Karen St. Germain; Colleen Quinn;Karen Stash; Georgia Sullivan; Lisa Clark and Annemarie Loftus) upset the strong ' crews of Madst, Villanova and Skidmore. The eight came off the line with a somewhat shaky start, but with the aid of a new coxoox (a sound system within the shell so that all rowers can hear the cox- swain), strategy played a more crucial role as Union took the lead by the 1000-meter mark (the halfway point) and kept it, crossing the tape seconds ahead of the Marist crew. The Varsity Men viewed this finish as they proceeded down to the start of their race where they met Marist, Iona, Villanova and Skidmore. Bad officiating caused the crew to be off-guard at the start, leaving t}lem two seats behind the other crews. Coxswain Joe Murphy called a good tactical race which was further enhanced by an awesome sprint as the crew elegantly walked through any ooat that stood in their way. This winning eight was com- prised of Chuck Lane, Dave Jones, John Wyatt, Mark Burton, Greg Clark, Paul Emsbo, Moose Reynard and Dave Sveden. The climax of the day came when Union captured two of the three trophies awarded. Independent medals were also distributed to each member of these victorious varsity 8's. The crews owe much to the fine coaching of John Ciovacco and Marjorie Dwoskin. All in all, it was a great day for Union Crew. Make a Varsity Person's day, ask to see their medal. Soitballers have taken some good cuts in last seven games. Have now won 7 straight. s •

Page 18 CONCORDIENSIS. May I, 1986 Qlnntnroiensis SPORTS Ruggers Very Physical, But Lose Tough One By CHRIS SHERIDAN \The whole game was an organized war,\ said Union Rugby's co-captain John Friske after losing to Buffalo State in the second round of last weekend's Upstate Rugby tournament at Windhover Park. The final score read 3-0 in favor of Buffalo State, however, that score doesn't show Union's domination. Junior prop Rob ':>harp agreed with Friske in the brutality of the game, \We physically beat up on the other teams, especially Buffalo State,\ he said. \They had two people get seriously injured. They had five injury time-outs in the second half alone. We so abused Buffalo State that they lost to Cortland (in a following game.)\ Union Dominates Action But Comes Up Empty Union dominated most of the game but had a hard time putti.rl.g the hall into the try- zone. The ruggers proved how strong their defense was after stopping Buffal() from about one-meter out. As hard as Buffalo tried, .every time they got the baH near Union's try- line, Union's de£ense tightened up like a knot. After being tied at 'half-time, Buffalo made it to Union's 15-meter- line, when a Union player- was called for being offsides on a ruck, directly in front of the goal posts. It didn't take much for Buffalo's kicker to chip in the three-poiut penalty kick, the eventual difference in the gam~. Union put together one last effort before time ran out on them. \Unfortunately time ran out on the Vlinning drive,\ Sharp said. Senior fullback Tim Hopkins was a definite factor in the game. Every time Buffalo got the ball in Union's end, it would come right l>ack. at them off of Ruggerettes Looking Good By MELISSA MALKIN The Lady Ruggers took a surprising fourth place in the Upstate Tournament this weekend. It is the team's fifth season, and the first one that they have had both an A and a B side. Said co-founder Maureen O'Day, \We played our very best games ever this weekend.\ She was not exaggerating. For the majority of the B side, it was the player's third game ever played, nevertheless. they succeeded in holding the score tied, 12-12, in their first match. losing only by a conversion in overtime. New players Patty Houmeil and Shauna Bavar both scored trys. The A side played a strong game as well, with a very impressive run by Nora Tutthel who scored for Union in the second half. Cor- nell, which is a rrmch older and more experienced club was overheard to say of Union's team: \You can tell they're new-they're still polite.\ Due to a piece of brilliant scheduling on the part of the tournament organizers, the A and B sides were scheduled to play their secmd game against each other on Saturday. The A team then went on to play on Sunday against the Genesseo Lady Warthogs. Patty Richards and Cathy Ha-wkes turned out to be a forceful duo. with Richards jumping and winning most of the line-outs for Union, and Hawkes running the ball down the field literally through the opposition. Coach Dave Ben· ziger said he was pleased with the way the team played. Captains Betsy Boutwell and Angie Burke have high hopes for the ruggerettes to become a good, competitive team, but they emphasize that they don't want to lose perspective either. \We're still <JUt there to have fun,\ and we caon't get so tense about it that we stop doing that,\ said Boutwell. The deadline for applications for memllership in the $50,000 Investment Fund has been ntended to May 14.

Athlete of the Week By D.A. LLOYD Congratulations go to Lacrosse's Tony Darin for his superb play during the week and subsequent winning of Concordiensis' Athlete of the Week, Tony's phenomenal play came against H8Jllilton College, a team Union had not beaten in six years. Tony, a juniortranfer student from Canton Junior College, led the way in the 10-7 victory at Hamilton. The attackmen scored but one goal in the gaine . but just as important as scoring goals are making assists, and Tony had siX, for atotalof seven \' point~. - Tony has solidified Union's offense this year . by playing behind the c~ge and assisting on many of the Dutchmen goals. Dar.in's 29 points 1ead theteam as do his assists (20) and he is currently third in goals scored with nine. The win was especially sweet for Union as it always feels good to beat a rival and it sends Union into a tough game vs. R.P .I. with a positive attitude~ Tony, a Syracuse, NY native, is currently a pledge at Chi Psi and majors in Engineering. The J.axmen need .more play of the same caliber from Tony and his teammates if the team is to have another winning season. Once again, congratulations to Tony Dar in on his great season thus far, and his especially fine performance at Hamilton. Track Does Well Individually Qj '0 0 :I .,.. V) >- D 0 +- 0 c a.. . By ANDY HODGKIN . This past Saturday was a day for individual performances for the Union Dutchmen track team as some fine efforts were turned in at the Dartmouth Invitational in Hanover, New Hampshire. Heading the list of fine per- formances was Rob Mohlar who picked -up the only win for the Dutchmen with a 1:52.6 time in the 800 meter race. Also finishing well in the same event was Jeff Barker who placed seventh with a time of 1:55.6. In the 3000 meter steeplechase, senior Chris O'Donnell finished fifth with a good time of 9:37.0. Senior Scott Remillard got tested on Saturdav and finished fourth and fifth in the hammer throw and the discus throw respectively. His placing throws were 185'4\ and 148'4''.

Winn~r of Capital District D~ided Last Night_ By PETE AGRICOLA On Wednesday night AprU 30 the Union College men'S lacrosse team will meet R.P.l for the rights to the Capital District Cup. The Cup is given to the men's lacrosse team from the Capital District area who compiles the best record against capital district foes. This is the first year that the Cup will be given away of- ficially. The Cup is sponsored by the capital district newspapers. The teams that are eligible for the Cup are Siena, Albany State., R.P.I. and Union. R.P.I. has beaten Albany State by 13- 12, and Siena 17-41, to put itself in a position to win the Cupon Wednesday night. Union has put itself in the position by beating Albany, 8-6, and Siena, 16-6. Union, last year, was un- defeated in the capital district beating Albany 15-7, Siena 5-5, and R.P.I. 13-5. Thismatchup figures to be an interesting one. R.P.I. comes in at 5-5 with .many of those los~es being by only a few goals. Umon comes in at 5-3 and hopes to continue its winning ways .. This season has been a very in- consistent one for the laxmen, but. a win in the Capital District CUp would, hopefully, spur the · laxmen on to a strong finish. . ran a 11.38 second split in the event which was good enough for fourth. The Dutchmen made good showings in both relay races with two fourths in the 4x100 and 4x400. Theteamof Allen, Wayne Lacy, Steve Hayes, and Rich Romer ran a time of 44.27 seconds in the 4x100. In the 4x400, the combined team of Mohlar, Barker, Allen and Hayes ran a split of 3:25.7. Appleby, Temush to Lead Icemen· Next .Year ByCPSIS Dave Appleby and Gary Temush have been chosen to Coach Charlie Morrison to captain next 'year's varsity ice hockey team. Appleby, a native of Nepean, Ontario, has played stellar defense for the Dut- chmen for the past three years with some time spent up at the forward position. Temush, from Pickering, Ontario, is presently a sophomore and his constant hustle and knack for scoring are. sure to have been factors in Coach Morrison's decision. The Skating Dutchmen look ot another fine year after making it once again to the N.C.AA.'s this past winter. ornncnrbitnsis SPORTS Charlie Slotnlk Looking at Sports By CHARLIESLOTNIK After 21 teams wasted six months playing 82 exhibition games the real N .. H.L. Season has begun. The N.H.L. playoffs started three weeks ago, and the games have been exciting and interesting to watch. · Most sports fans realize there is little significance to regular season hockey games, since sixteen out of twenty-one teams make the playoffs. Because teams need to win only a mere one-third of their games during this six-month hiatus to qualify for the playoffs~ the quality of play suffers. However, now that the playoffs have arrived, the quality of play is first rate as the players are finally going up and down the ice with the in- tensity ex:pected of professionals. Surprise Teams The playoff format allows for weak teams to participate for the Stanley Cup. But this year the weak teams, the Hartford Whalers, Toronto Maple Leafs and the New York Rangers, are doing more than just par- ticipating. These --teams have already upset three division champions. The Hartford Whalers, Toronto Maple Leafs, and NY Rangers have stopped playing pond hockey for sixty minutes and started placing an em- phasis on each game. The biggest surprise in the playoffs thus far has been the New York Rangers. The Rangers under new coach Ted Sator finished fourth in the GARNET SCOReBOARD strong Patrick Division ,and thus had to play the Patrick division champions, the Philadelphia Flyers. After disposing of the Flyers in five games, the Rangers advanced to the quarter finals of the playoffs where they faced the equally tough Washington Capitals. Larouche Paces Rangers The Rangers are led by goal- scorer Pierre Larouche. Larouche, who did not make the team at the beginning of the season, was playing in the minors, traveling by bus to cities like Glens Falls, New Haven and .Binghamton from Hershey. This is not the type of road trip a veteran player like Larouche is about to get excited about. But when Larouche arrived back to New York he was ready to score goals. After battling the Washington Capitals to a 2-2 tie in their best of seven series, the Rangers metamorphasized from an average team playing good to a great team playing exceptional. The Rangers won the next two games, and sent Bobby Car- penter, Pete Peeters, and the rest of the Capitals to the golf course earlier than they would have liked. Thb Rangers now in the semifinals, could return to the Stanley Cup finals for the first time since 1979. If these weak teams can continue to play as improved as they have in the past three weeks, the months of April and May will surely make up for the six months of lackluster regular season hockey that sports fans were forced to suffer through again ~his year.

CONCORDIENSIS, May 1, 1986 Athlete of the Week ByD.A.LWYD Congratulations go to Lacrosse's Tony Darin for his superb play during the week and subsequent winning of Concordiensis' Athlete of the Week. Tony's phenomenal play ca:me against Hamilton College, a team Union had not beaten in six years. Tony, a junior tranfer student frmnCanton. Junior College, led the way in the 10-7 victory at Hamilton. The attackmen scored but one goal in the game but just as important as scoring goals are making assists, and Tony had six, for a total of seven • p~ints. Tony has solidified Union's offense this year by playing behind the cage and assisting en many of the Dutchmen goals. Darin's 29 p0ints lead the team as do his assists { 20) and he is currently third in goals scored with nine. The win was especially sweet for Union as it always feels good t0 beat a rival and it sends Union into a tough game vs. R.P.I. with a positive attitude. Tony, a Syracuse, NY native, is currently a pledge at Chi Psi and majors in Engineering. The l.axmen need more play of the same caliber from Tony and his teammates if the team is to have another winning season. Once again, congratulations to Tony Dar in on his great season thus far, and his especially fine performance at Hamilton. TrackDoesWelllndividually (J) '0 0 ::J .,__ <J) > .a 0 ..... 0 J:: a..

Winn~r of Capital District Decided Last Night By PETE AGRICOLA On Wednesday night April 30 the Union College men's lacrosse team will meet R.P .I. for the rights to the Capital District CUp. The Cup is given to the men's lacrosse team from the Capital District area who compiles the best record against capital district foes. This is the first year that the Cup will be given away of- ficially. The Cup is sponsored by the capital district newspapers. The teams that are eligible for the Cup are Siena, Albany State, R.P.l. and Union. R.P.I. has beaten Albany State by 13- 12, and Siena 17-8, to put itself in a position to win the Cupon Wednesday night. Union has put itself in the position by beating Albany, 8-6, and Siena, 16..0. Union, last yea!.\ was un- defeated in the capital district beating Albany 15-7, Siena 5-5, and R.P.I. 13-5. This matchup figures to be ~n interesting one. R.P.I. comes m at 5-5 with Jllany of those los~es being by only a few goals. Umon cernes in at 5-3 and hopes to continue its winning ways. This season has been a very in· consistent one for the laxmen, but a win in the Capital District Cup would, hopefully, spur the laxmen on to a strong finish. ran a 11.38 second split in the event which was good enough for fourth. The Dutchmen made good showings in both relay races with two fourths in the 4xl00 and 4x400. The team of Allen, Wayne Lacy, Steve Hayes, and Rich Romer ran a time of 44.27 seconds in the 4x100. In the 4x400, the combined team of Mohlar, Barker, Allen and Hayes ran a split of 3:25.7. Appleby, Temush to lead Icemen· Next Year ByCPSIS Dave Appleby and Gary Temush have been chosen to Coach Charlie Morrison to captain next year's varsity ice hockey team. Appleby, a native of Nepean, Ontario, has played stellar defense for the Dut- chmen for the past three years with some time spent up at the forward position. Temush, from Pickering, Ontario, is presently a sophomore and his constant hustle and knack for scoring are sure to have been factors in Coach Morrison's decision. The Skating Dutchmen look ot another fine year after making it once again to the N.C.A.A.'s this past winter. Page 19 Qtnncnrilfensis SPORTS Charlie Slotnik Looking at Sports By CHARLIE SLOTNIK After 21 teams wasted six months playing 82 exhibition games the real N.H.L. Season has begun. The N.H. L. playoffs started three weeks ago, and the games have been exciting and interesting to watch. Most sports fans realize there is little significance to regular season hockey games, since sixteen out of twenty-one teams make the playoffs. Because teams need to win only a mere one-third of their games daring this six-month hiatus to qualify for the playoffs, the quality of play suffers. However, now that the playoffs have arrived, the quality of pla.v is first rate as the players are finally going up and down the ice with the in- tensity expected of professionals. Surprise Teams The playnff format allows for weak teams to participate for the Stanley Cup. But this year the weak teams. the Hartford Whalers, Toronto Maple Leafs and the New York Rangers, are doing more than just par- ticipating. These teams have already upset three division champions. The Hartford Whalers, Toronto Maple Leafs, and ;\/\' Rangers have stopped playing pond hockey for .sixty nunutes and started placing an em- phasis on each game. The biggest surprise 111 the ple~yoffs thus far has been the l\:ew York Hangers. The Rangers under new coach Ted Sator finished fourth in the GARNETSCOREBOARO strong Patrick Division and thus had to play the Patrick division champions, the Philadelphia Flyers. After disposing of the Flyers in five games, the Rangers advanced to the quarter finals of the playoffs where they faced the equally tough Washington Capitals. Larouche Pa<'es Rangers The Rangers are led by goal- scorer Pierre Laroul:he. Larouche, who did not make the team at the beginning of the season, was playing in the minors, traveling by bus to cities like Glens Falls, New Haven and .Binghamton from Hershey. This is not the type of road trip a veteran player like Larouche is about to get excited about. But when Larouche arrived back to New York he was ready tn score goals. After battling the Washington Capitals to a 2-2 tie in their best of seven series, the Rangers metamorphasized from an average team playing good to a great team playing exceptional. The Rangers won the next two games, and sent Bobby Car- penter, Pete Peeters. and the rest of the Capitals to the golf course earlier than they would have liked. Thl Rangers now in the semifinals, C\ould return to the Stanley Cup finals for the f ir.st tinw sim·t- I !li!l. If thest' weak teams can continut• tP play as unproved a!-> they have in the past three weeks, the months nf April and :\1ay will surely makl' up for the six months of lackluster regular season hoc· key that spmts fans were for<\ed to ,-.;uffer through e~gair. ~his year.

LLOYD Last Saturday, the Union lacrosse team took on the Hamilton Continentals and ruined their Parents' Weekend by beating them 1o-7. This win brought the team's record up to 5-3 and continues the Dutchmen on their rollercoaster-type season. Up and Down Season Since the Middlebury game on April 16 the Laxmen have gone 2-2; losing to Middlebury, winning against Siena, losing against Williams, and finally, winning against Hamilton. All in all, it has been a season marred with setbacks and problems. The teams works as a fine unit in one game and then loses an intensity and loses the . next game. An example being the change of personality from the Siena game to the Williams game. Toop Frustrated Coach Toop has been so upset with the team at times that he has ended practices prematurely by throwing the team ·off the field. The chemistry has just not been there on a consistent basis and the team, thus far, has lived through a very confused season. The team came up with some impressive victories and even a good effort in the Middlebury loss, but the season has as a whole had no fluidity to it at all. Maybe Saturday's win at Hamilton will be followed by a victory vs. R.P.I. and some of the hills in the rollercoaster will flatten out. Turn It Around for Hamllton The win was a total team effort and showed the strong character as Union battled back from a one-goal deficit late in the 3rd period to hold the Continentals to just one goal in the final period, to claim the victory. The offense was sparked by John Romeo's 5 goals, Phil Horn's 3 goals and an assist and Tony Darin's .1 goal and 6 assists. Goalie John Thorne saved 9 of 16 shots for the Dutchmen. Tri· Captain Andy Ross and Mike Weisberger led the team in the very important statistic of groundballs having. 7 and 6 respectively. The strong play of the defense .kept the Dutchmen in tbe game ps they only allowed 4 shots to be taken on Thorne in the 2nd half. Defenders included Mark Leyton, Tri~Captain Tim Meyer, Gary Corsick,, Greg Leahey, and Chuck Weber. Support Union· Sports Baseball Ties Record By JOE ROMANELLI This past week, Union played Dhision I Colgate, and as in the past, beat them in the last in· ning. On the mound, was junior Rich Bartosch who struck out seven and got the win. Union fell behind early :~-9, but proceeded to jump on top 5~2 in the next few innings. But, Colgate didn't give in, as they slowly picked away to tie it at five in the seventh. Bartosch was faced with bases loaded in the eighth with two outs and got out of the inning with a spectacular diving catch by Reinhard Walker. Union would finally go ahead for good in the top of the tenth as Glenn Kata singled, stole second, was sacrificed to third and scored on a base hit by !..ndy Markopoulos. Ted Cannon would finish the tenth as Colgate still threatened as they opened with a single, then stole second and third. With one out Colgate flew out to centerfielder Dave Anderson and with the tying run tagging, Anderson threw a bullet to Ron Jakubczyk blocking the plate for the game. Union was 10-1. Outstanding performances by Dan Klinger, Tom Barrett, and Kata each with two hits, while Kata and Horan each stole two bases. Union then traveled to Middlebury in an attempt to tie a long standing record~ of 11·1 set in 1885 as the best start in Onion history. The Dutchmen started sophomore Scott Perlman witJ:ot Steve Alves and Dave Giordano relieving to tie the record with a U·8 victory. Pacing the Dutchmen were Pete Cohan's three hits, Ken Horan's two hits, and Anderson, Jakubczyk, and Walker adding one each. Pete Cohan also had five R.B.lls and Dan Lazarek running for catcher Jim Reynolds had three stolen bases. In the second game, Union would see their hopes shattered for a new record as they lost 9-8 in the bottom of the seventh inning. Union exploded for a seven run thitd inning behind the bats of Rita (HR), Barrett (HR), Klinger (2B), Jakubczyk (2B), and Markopoulos (lB). Middlebury slowly came back as they finally tied in the sixth and won in the seventh. Union was 11·2. Union fell to 11:-3 on Monday versus North Adams 17-6. Union was ahead 6-4 in the fifth inning until North Adams exploded for 13 runs in the next few innings. Union couldn't overcome the deficit as they lost their second .in a row. Rita continued with the hot bat going two fnr five. On Tuesday, Union played Albany away and won 9-6. Steve Alves went two fer three with three R.B.I.'s, including the game-winning hit. Also, adding to the scoring punch were Anderson, Rita, and Markopoulos with two hits apiece. Union needed extra innings for the win but finished it in the tenth with a five-run rally. The winning pitcher was Ken Horan (3-1) who bad a fine performance. Union will meet Siena and Hamilton on Wed- nesday and Thursday, respectively. Let's cheer on the Dutchmen, who are now 12-3. Dutchmen Pitching Superb See Story Below W.lax GoestoStates By WENDY ALLEN. The Union women's lacrosse team suffered a loss on Saturday at Hamilton. The play was fantastic to watch with the Dutch women· and the Con· tinentals fighting an even and very exciting battle. It was within the last few minutes that Hamilton pulled away with a lead that Union did not have time to catch. The final of the varsity game was 12 to 9. The J.V. team also suffered a loss at Hamilton. Although Union held the lead throughout the whole game, Hamilton jumped back to tie the game at 9. In the first overtime both teams scored making it a tie at 10. Sudden death followed and Hamilton won with the first goal, making the final score 11· 10. The J.V. team also played Russell Sage on Friday where they added a win to their r~cord. Besides the regularly scheduled game at Oneonta St. the lax.women, for the first time, have been invited to par- ticipate i.il the States. The Dutchwomen leave Thursday to travel to William Smith where they will play the ni.unber one seeded team, Colgate, on Friday. With a loss they will play again on Saturday, and with a win they will play again on Sunday. It is very exciting to see these sportswomen going to the States, especially Bonnie Faulkner, Becca Clemente, Cheryl Washburn, Lorna Rusbp forth, Heidi Kahn, and Maureen Thompson who have been working towards this for four years. .

' ·b· . acu. ty · ·. tstrl ·. ut1on By DAVID MARIN As with all colleges and universities, Union is constantly considering the distribution of its financial !lnd per.sonnel resources among its depart- ments. The question of faculty distribution has been renewed as a pressing and controversial issue because of the ·pending delegation of ten new tenure track positions to be created in response to the recent course load reduction. In particular, the tension revolves around · the conflict that ex:ists between alleviating enrollment pressures and ad- ding t9 the enrichment of the cmiculum. Departments such as ec()nomics and psychology would like to see addition-al faculty positions come to their departments to relieve pressiu'es w.Qile others see a need for expanding _ and enriching Union's academic program in other ar~as, most notably tbe humanities, . _ - ln sync with the national trend, .• enrollment in the econoniics department at Union has increased significantly over the last few year11. Now Union graduates roughly one hundred economics majors yearly, approximately 20 percent of the graduating class. Yet, the ten full-time ieconomics professors account for only 6. 7 percent of the College's full-time teaching staff of 150 (lAM included, library staff is not). Professor .Prosper, chairman of the department maintains that despite some measures that have been taken to alleviate enrollment pressures in his department (adjunct professors and temporary replacements for professors on leave), it would still be ad- vantageous to hire additional personnel. He argues that a new tenure track position would allow ·for more seminars, in- ternship possibilities, more independent studies, smaller classes and curricular enrich .. ment within the department. In a memorandum sent to the Academic Affairs Council (AAC) last June, economics professors Fried, Klein, Lewis, Prosper, Reynolds, and Sch· midt challenged the AAC to . present evidence supporting its contention that the EE·CS, classics, .Spanish, physics and 'chemistry de.partments were suffering severe enrollment pressures. They went on to make a case for the severity of enrollment pressures within their own departments. The AAC did not respond. to the memorandum. Vice President for Academic Affa-ir.s .Doct~r. Thomas D' A1idrea ··commented that while enrollment pressures might be high in that depart- ment now, student interests have a tendency to shift. ''As of now,\ he stated, \rm not convmced that we ought to make long-tenn comn1itments in those departments (economics and · political science)\ He pointed to short- term solutions that help to alleviate pressures such as the use of adjunct professors and supplemental pay for ex:tra courses.

The question of faculty distribution has been renewed as a pressing and controversial issue because of the pending delegation of ten new tenure track positions to be created in response to the recent course load reduction. In particular, the tension revolves around · the conflict that exists between alleviating enrollment pressures and ad- ding to the enrichment of the curriculum. Departments such as economics and psychology would like to see addition-al faculty positions come to their departments to relieve pressures while others see a need for expanding and enriching Union's academic program in other ar~as, most notably the humanities. In sync with the national trend, enrollment in the economics department at Union has increased significantly over the last few years. Now Union graduates roughly one hundred economics majors yearly, approximately 20 percent of the graduating class. Yet, the ten full-time jeconomics professors account for only 6.7 percent of the College's full-time teaching staff of 150 (lAM included, library staff is not). Professor Prosper, chairman of the department maintains that despite some measures that have been taken to alleviate enrollment pressures in his department (adjunct professors and temporary replacements for professors on leave), it would still be ad- vantageous to hire additional personnel. He argues that a new tenure track position would allow for more seminars, in- ternship possibilities, more independent studies, smaller classes and curricular enrich- ment within the department. In a memerandum sent to the Academic Affairs Council (AAC) last June, economics professors Fried, Klein, Lewis, Prosper, Reynolds, and Sch- midt challenged the AAC to present evidence supporting its contention that the EE-CS, classics, Spanish, physics and chemistry departments were suffering severe enrollment pressures. They went on to make a case for the severity of enrollment pressures within their own departments. The AAC did not respond to the memorandum. Vice President for Academic Affairs Doctor Thomas D'Andrea commented that while enrollment pressures might be high in that depart- ment now, student interests have a tendency to shift. \As of now,\ he stated, \I'm not convinced that we ought to make long-term commitments in those departments (economics and · political science)\ He pointed to short- term solutions that help to alleviate pressures such as the use of adjunct professors and supplemental pay for extra courses.

Currently, too many tax dollars are going to New York City. They are receiving a di~pr()portionate share of the st~te's budget. Upstate cities have the same problems as New York City.

Nott Memorial to Receive National Recognition Admissions Office A: .Many of them will become taxpayers immediately. Tltat will be their biggest challenge. Many others will go 011 to graduate school and then become taxpayers. As tax- payers, I am sure that they will not want to pay high taxes. Some might decide to move to another state that has lower taxes. Last winter, Governor Cuomo and the Democrats in the legislature refused to enact a proposal to cut income tax:es by 10 percent. I hope that most of these new taxpayers will support such realistic proposals so that in 1988, Governor Cnomo will not be able to enact a huge tax cut based on a surplus that is even larger than today's for his own personal political.gain. By LISA MARZILLI and JASON FEING6LI) Recently, it has been proposed that the N\ott Memorial be placed on tile list of National Landmarks. Currently, it is on the National Register of Historic Buildings due to its importance to the immediate community. Although it is not difficult to be placed on the National Register, the criteria for being established as a National Landmark are much more rigorous. To be a National Landmark, a building must be shown to have · n~tional historical .signiflcance and not just local. The Nott qualifies as a ·land- mark for two reasons. The first is because of its architecture, which is known as tlte High Victorian Gothic stylE. The second is its architects, the Potter Br()thers, who designed many important buildings in the nineteenth century in New York and whose style and methods influenced many other ar- chitects. The Nott Memorial~ which was started in 1859 and finished in 1878, was originally intended to be an alumni han. It s~w little use, however, untn it be~ame a library in 19()3. After a8 years as a library it became what it is today: the campus b()()kstore and a theatre for dramatic productions. Although the college is not The Security and Safety Department receives calls concerning the sa-fety of ·students Who sit on the roof tops of several privately and college- owned fraternity houses. While it is understandable that wann weather encourage~ \sun bathing\ and the Iiles, the concern is that studEnts are risking physical injur-y, many times after parties the Foof tops become the scene of pushing and general horsing ar()und. In the past, three students have fallen sustaining serious physical injury. Most private fraternities clearly cannot handle the civil liability should a person fall from their building. The privatE frater- nities (under tenns of the contract or lease with Union College) will bear the liability for any injuries or fatalities which may result from ac- cidents due to the practice of roof sitting. The Sec11rity and Safety Departme11t is authorized to issue fines to students and-or organizations who ignore this long .standing Collge policy. Questions should be diJ:ected to the Security aad Safety Department. absolmtely sure that the Nott win be placed on the list, the Assistant to tlle President, Jack L. Maranville, said that it was alm()st certain that it would be appr<Jved and that an answer is pendi11g shortly. When a building becomes a National Landmark it is often subjected to certain restrictions to its uses by tile Federal Government. Implements New Technlques The college, however, wishes to ketep flexible the options availa.ble to it with the building. The reason for this is that the colleg4El does not want to restrict its planning for the Nott in the futue:. Plans for the Nott are undetided at present although the bookstore will move out to the student center within the next two years. In. the past, the Nott Memorial had -only undergone minor repairs as problems arose. It was ·()only superficially repaired when it was converted to a theatre in 1961. No major C()nstrnction has been done on the· N\ ott because it is not con· sidered a program priority: accC>iding to President Morris, \It is not the buildings them- selves that are important, wllat\s important is that they rep~esent important program developme11ts.\ Thus, majoi renCJvations cannot be expected f()r ~nother eight to ten ·years, in time for Union's bicentennial celeblration. 10U ARE HERE. Continued from page 1 applications from women. The CDmpletion of the new College Center and renovations of Alumni Gynmasium may also attract more female applicants. According to Nourse, the female applicant group has nwnbered in the 95o-1,050 range since the College became coed in 1970. Nourse also spoke about the difficulty that many colleges are experiencing in attracting liberal arts students. Nourse said, .. Students across the land are not flocking into liberal arts · subjects.\ Instead, students are becoming more career-oriented and are opting to major in engineering or computer science, hoping to land well- paying jobs after graduation.

Kelly Larkin an- nounced her candidacy by stating, \With all of the recent changes around campus, many students have developed a negative attitude toward life at Union. The student forwn has not provided students with the kind. of representation and opportunities they need in order to voice their opinions on matters they feel strongly about. \Because of my experiences in the bureaucratic process at Union,. I feel I could unite the forwn and establish a better rapport with the ad- ministration. I don't think that students have utilized the forum to their benefit.

In addition to this, there have been certain . 'representatives' which have done little else than uphold the · position of the Administration, even going so far as to vociferously support unpopular policies in the Student Forum.

The room lottery will be conducted from May 5 to May • 22. The computer will randomly assign numbers to students by class year. That is to say,. tile computer randomly assigns numbers to members of the classes of 87, 88, and 89 who live in college owned residence h.alls (independents only). 'I'he computer then translates the random nwnber to a nu.:m.ber that is understandable - one through 400 -roughly the class size for each year.

Among his many activities in this field, he has been involved with agricultural matters in Hon- duras and has developed what has been regarded as Costa Rica's finest \think tank.\ Mr. Stone started off his lecture by listing some com- monly held notions about Central America. First, he explained that Central America is comprised of five nations: from old colonial aristocracy.,. Since the aristocratic classes in Central America · have traditionally maintained power by exporting agriculture, the Sandinistas are most well · equipped to generate the currency they need to purchase goods in Europe and the U.S. and thereby stay in control. problematic matter for Costa Rica and other \bordering\ countries.

The most politically volatile country in Central America today is Nicaragua. This nation is feared by the U.S. to be the cause of political disen- chantment throughout the rest of Central America. Indeed, such .feats have to a large ex- tent, already materialized. For example, many discontent or fearful Nicaraguans flee to Costa Rica where they are given shelter, food and jobs by the Costa Rican government despite the fact that the number of job opportunities availab~e to Costa Ricans themselves is depleted. This is a potentially to the region. These four nations · · have joined together in forming \contadora.\ Unfortunately, their claim that they are neutral · in affairs. of Central American nations, according to Soone, has . . not been supported in reality. Each nation has sought to gain · · politically or economically from this loose alliance, thus destroying any possibilities of neutrality or aiding the situation. In effect, Stone believes that the friction among Central American nations will ensue as long as the United States treats the region as \its domain\ and will not subside · until \moral authority\ begins Faculty Trustee Charles Tidmar(h, discusses Union's divestment to govern their leaders. · policy.

In fact, says Stone, unity is often lacking within the countries them- selves. Social, cultural and linguistic differences between the native Indians and the \Mestizos\ (people who share both Indian and Spanish roots) often cause social and political rifts in their societies. 6:30-7:00 pm Junior numbers 1- . 50, Sophomores numbers 1-50 7:00- 7:30pm, Junior numbers 50..100, Sophomore numbers 5().. 100 7:30 - 8:00 pm, Junior numbers 100-150, Sophomore numbers 100-150 8:00 - 8:30 pm, Junior numbers 150.200, Sophomore numbers 150..200 10:00 - 10:30 pm, Sophomore number 350 - on up until last person is called TilE SENIOR LOTTERY The senior lottery does not have lottery numbers assigned to a specific time period.

It .is to your advantage to be on time as the senior lottery has historica1ly been completed within one hour. According to Stone, the best way to understand the \com- plicated issues\· fbcing present day Central America is to un- derstand the power sturggles existing within the nations: themselves.

Applications are due no later than Friday, May 23. Applicants will be notified by mail during the summer. The Political Science Department has offered the Term in washington every spring since 1977 and each year twenty students have represented Union in the nation's capital. Students are selected on the bsis of academic performance/ writing ability/ interest in the program, involvement in relevant extracurriicular activities, and faculty recommendations. Preference is given to students who will be juniors in the spring of their internships, but many sophomores and seniors have been selected in the past, and students' majors have ranged from political science and humanities to natural science and engineering. Students receive two course credits for the internship (PSC 179 and 180), as well as a third course in Washington. In the past, this course has varied over the years, but has always taken advantage of the location in Washington: from museum anthropology at the Smithsonian to the architecture of the federal capital to the history of film at the American Film Institute. The subject matter for next year has not yet been determined. Most students in the program intern in offices of members of the House of Representatives, while a few intern in related offices such as the Northeast/Midwest Institute. In addition to courses, seminars with leading political figures are held on virtvally a weekly basis. These include leading campaign- consultants, members of the federal judiciary, and the executive branch, including the White House staff, the CIA, and the D.epartment of State. Students pay the normal board, room, and tuition to the College, plus the ~~term abroad\ surcharge. H-ousing in Washington is provided (currently three~ person apartments at the Capitol Hill), plus a weekly stipend for meals. If you have further questions, a brochure is available in the Depart- ment of Political Science Office, and Professor Hartwig will be the faculty member in residence during the term next year. . S. African Divestment: . Union Policy Reviewed Continued from page 1 While; understandably. the committee does not want to . divulge too much information before they go before the Board, they seem to be trying to ,resolve the conflict of making money and remaining socially conscious. While Union \can't be amoral,'' said Tidmarch, there is \no necessary in- compatabUity between prudent investment and social con- sciousness.\ George added that the apparent lack of concern on campus \Doesn't lessen the responsibility\ of the com- mittee to \do the right thing\ while at the same time, em- phasize the purpose of the Board, which is to \prudently maximize the funds of the college.\ This would make it seem that the committee is working on a compromise of the two situations. With this in mind, the im- plication is that the committee will recommend, partial divestment, based somehow on the Sullivan Principles. fhis hypothesis is based on two things. In trying to come up with some sort of resolution of the social consciousness versus profit maximization conflict, no change at all seems out of the question. Secondly, the members of the committee interviewed both thought that the benefit of the American companies in South Africa could be good for the situation, and at the very least, it couldn't hurt. This thinking seems to rule out complete divestment also. That leaves partial divestment as the only alternative. What course they choose in regard to the weight placed on the Sullivan Principles, ·or what amend- ments the committee may make remain to be seen. Tid- march, however, concluded by saying that whatever policy is decided up would \leave the door open\ for re-evaluation and an update if necessary. Therefore, it seems that whatever decision is made it is not etched in stone. In any case, no decision will be made for- mally until June. WILL 1'HERE BE S1 1 UDENT AID TOMORROW?

Just pick up any of last winter's Concordy and turn to the Editorial section. Why we even have poignant editorials ~ritizing other critical\ editorials. Such editorials have always existed but the significant phenomenon is the common subject matter that they share, that of the change in Unwn.

But if we can scrutinize our school with those three questions in mind · we might possibly glide over whatever turmoil that lies ahead with ease. Oh No! Not the housing lottery! The Lottery: The Trials and Traumas By MARJORIE HOFFER For those freshmen suffering from emotional turmoil over housing for next year, do not despair! · Last year, a little freshman named Minnie found herself, oddly enough,. without a roommate for sophomore year. Although she showered regularly, and did not have any terrible habits, her friends had just paired -off without her. Her neurotic nature made it im- possible for her to heed to the advice ofherpeersnotto worry . What was little Minnie to do? She could not simply go alone to the lottery and chance living with some girl who had leprosy, or even worse, sheets that did not match the ones Minnie had so carefully picked out from the Macy's White Sale. Minnie was desp,erate. Adam and Rob's·World N e_ws Report From bad to worse, her area coordinator phoned her the day before numbers were given out. He called to tell her that by some strange occurance, her name had not been entered in the computer and she did not have a number! So, he told her there was no need to stand in line the next day. Alas, poor Minnie! No roommate, no lottery number. In absolute, utter, and total despair, Minnie turned to her wise friend Babe. Babe had A's from Intro- Soc to Calculus 14, .she'd know just what to do. Babe told Minnie that she knew of a friend who had a friend who did not want to live with her best friend and also did not have a roommate fqr next .year. This possibility was feasible to Minnie and she! took down the names of the two girls. One of the names, \Tina Turnerfeld\ rang a bell in Minnie's anxiety stricken mind. Tina was that strange, quiet girl in Minnie's English class winter term. The saving grace was Tina's wonderful Fiorucci book bag. Minnie thought that if Tina had a nice bookbag, then even if their sheets did not match after all, they would be of Minnie's caliber. So, one day, Minnie approached Tina-though the. two had never met before--and asked her . if they might room together. Tina was flab- berghasted. She did not give Minnie an answer and ran to the gossiping huddle of her friends. with? Neither girl wanted to live with the other's friends. Minnie posed this problem to her friend Berneice. Berneice suggested that Minnie ask Cher and Felicia. Minnie thought that BerniecE had gone crazy. Cher and Felicia were the two sorority sisters never seen without the other. Minnie had a class with Cher and thought she was nice, but a bit on the wild party animal side of the spectrum. Minnie had never heard a word uttered out of Felicia'.s mouth. Granted, she had heard a lot ABOUT Felicia. Felicia had legs as fat as most people's arms. And was so desired, by most every most every male on campus. Felicia always came in late to Math for Morons and once came in with a huge box of oranges from her Grandma Flo. Minnie always wondered two things about Felicia, one, how did anyone human have legs that thin, and did Felicia have a larynx. Minnie thought she would wind up being their social secretary, and that the suite would be a motel. Berniece assured Minnie that her convictions were wrong. After some thought, Minnie, Tina, Cher, and Felicia d,ecided to room together although the closest they had ever been before was in bet- ween pages 12 and 24 of the Freshman Record. Minnie had never lleard Felicia talk and reported to her friends that it was tme, Felicia did have a Long Island accent. By ADAM EMERSON and ROB BLEIFER Last week;s top story this week took place in Kiev where there was the worst nuclear disaster ever. Russia should be commended for the cooperation they've shown the rest of the world· in dealing with the situation.

Poiand in particular has shoWJ? an exemplary display of goverlliilent decision making. Mrs. Hildegard Boobinski, who this week discovered that she had a third boob, fortunately is not aware that this is an .effect of radiatien. Thanks to the Polish government's decision to spare its citizens the details of the Russian leaks, Hildegard seems to think this is normal for . a robust woman of her age. This week's summit in Tokyo was almost a site for disaster when terrorists fired five rockets in the direction of the Geihinkan Guest House. Sup- posedly the rockets hit just thirteen minutes before Reagan's arrival at the palace. During a candid moment back at the White House, Vice President Bush expressed disdain concerning the incident, \Thirteen has always been my unlucky number. If the old coot hadn't stopped at the pharmacy for some Preparation-H. I'd be the Chief now.\ On the home front, there was more misery at Cape Canaveral. In light of the disasterous flight attempt of the Delta rocket last week, NASA is now faced with three con- secutive launching failures. Disappointed with the failW\e but optimistic about the NASA program, Reagan commented, \Just because we've had ac- cidents, whether it's baseball or what have you, you get into a slump and you pull out of it.\ We salute Reagan's winning attitude in his willingness to sacrifice billions of dollars to bring NASA's win-loss record up to .500 in 1986. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, after nipping at a bottle of cooking sherry, Aunt Martha started dancing on the stove singing, \I Just Gotta Be Me.\ Suddenly, Aunt Martha inad- vertantly kicked on the gas and blew up the ranch.

In the nick of time, the four were in the Residence Life building picking their sutte. Although the rest would have preferred a co-ed floor, Minnie thought that Felicia would attract to many puppy dog-eyed freshman boys and that they would stay up late and keep Minnie awake. A wave of neurotic panic flooded Minnie's body and she signed her contract with a sweaty palm and a thumping heart. When it was over, Tina invited them to .go to Cabaret where she was singing, and Cher and Felicia invited them to their sorority party. The four never spoke together again for the rest of the year. The first day the girls moved in was horror. Minnie and Tina hardly knew Cher and Felicia, let alone each other. The situation was rather tense for days.

Granted, she had heard a lot ABOUT Felicia. Felicia had legs as fat as most people's anns. And was so desired by most every most every male on campus. Felicia always came in late to Math for Morons and once came in with a huge box of oranges from her Grandma Flo. Minnie always wondered two things about Felicia, one, how did anyone human have legs that thin, and did Felicia have a larynx. Minnie thought she would wind up being their social secretary, and that the suite would be a motel. Berniece assured Minnie that her convictions were wrong. After some thought, Minnie, Tina, Cher, and Felicia decided to room together although the closest they had ever been before was in bet- ween pa~es 12 and 24 of the Freshman Record. Minnie had never heard Felicia talk and reported to her friends that it was true, Felicia did have a Long Island accent. The next day, Tina and Minnie waited anxiously as the numbers were called, for Cher and Felicia to arrive. In the nick of time, the four were in the Residence Life building picking their sutte. Although the rest would have preferred a co-ed floor, Minnie thought that Felicia would attract to many puppy dog-eyed freshman boys and that they would stay up late and keep Minnie awake. A wave of neurotic panic flooded Minnie's body and she signed her contract with a sweaty palm and a thumping heart. When it was over, Tina invited them to go to Cabaret where she was singing, and Cher and Felicia invited them to their sorority party. The four never spoke together again for the rest of the year. The first day the girls moved in was horror. Minnie and Tina hardly knew Cher and Felicia, let alone each other. The situation was rather tense for days. As it turned out Felicia and Cher were utter neat freaks and were coming home in the wee hours of the morning with their respective friends. But as the year progressed and other roommates became sick of each Continued on page 8

Page8 CONCORDlElVSIS, May 8, 1986 FEATURES WIW The old doors of Carnegie The Gaps to Fills the Wails By I.JEE ANN SCHMIDT Standing in the dirt surrounded by a dismal skeleton of a building, I could hardly believe that less than a year ago this was one of the vital centers for social activity on campus, The Pub. It is even more difficult to believe that by the Spring of 19B7, somehow it will . be transformed miraculously into our new mailroom. Nothing seemed familiar; the bar was gone, the floor was gone, even the walls had been moved. What remained was a depressing scene. Dirt covers everything, broken bricks lie strewn on the ground amongst haphazard piles of rubble. Somehow, from all this mess will evolve our new Student Center. The key to visualizing the finished project lies within an unending pile of architect's plans. Basically, the exterior of the building will remain as it is. Even the newer section of the building will be designed to be similar to the old Carnegie. The modern interior will house an impressive list which includes: two bookstores, two restaurants (one of which will l>e cafeteria style), the mailroom, Concordiensis of- fices (which will hopefully be larger than the office we now have), W.R.U.G, the dean's offices, and a theater (which will hold at least 200 people). Oh, there will also be an automatic teller so we can deplete our bank accounts with easy access. How approximately twenty workers, will accomplish this transformation is beyond me. However, they are hiring more workers as they are needed. After talking to the workmen I was under the impression that although they have fallen behind schedule they should be able to make up for lost time now that the weather has broken. A lot of students are worried, though, they remember that Hale opened three months behind schedule, and that was only one kitchen. Another concern arises· from that fact that from the outside it doesn't appear as though much is going on at all. Occasionally, passing students witness piles of miscellaneous garbage being thrown out windows. People structure of the new building has been completed. Also, the entire sturcture of old Carnegie has been rebuilt. Like any enthusiastic reporter, I hoped to uncover some scandal, but little was to be found. There were com- plaints that the excessive garbage inside the site made it more hazardous than other jobs. Apparently, on most jobs the foreman hires a cleanup crew. However, we get what we pay for, therefore, we don't get a clean-up crew. One problem that ereated extra work for the project in· volved the original structure of Carnegie. The wall~ ofCarnegie were made of solid brick, through and trhough, This made it more difficult to tear down and replace these old structural walls with new ones. One worker said he believed that Carnegie must have been built by WPA workers from the New Deal Era. He pointed out how unprofessionally the bricks had been layed, showing us places where wood was used oto fill in gaps in the walls. Sometimes it is difficult to understand why we aren't seeing more progress on our Student Center. We are impatient to see the final results. Maybe our impatience partially comes from a lack of understanding of how com- plicated the work rel:!llY is. have even spread rumors to the ~ effect that each night the .g workers fill Carnegie with ·t; .~ garbage so they can spend the <~> ~ • • next day throwing it out ~ again.

Included among this especially draining list of events are sllch things as pre .. registration hassles when you find out that you've been shut out of all of your courses due to an error in the .computer, confronting your· outstanding phone bill from the Spring Term before, remem- bering the old mailbox com- bination you swore you would never forget, and the annual trip to Norstar Bank. Of all the above, Norstar proves to be the truly unforgetable one. From the ontside~ Norstar exemplifies a modest banking institution. From the inSide, looks are deceiving. For the incoming Freshman, novice a,t all the above mentioned chores and more, the first visit in Norstar can be a gruelling yet sobering event indeed!

I soon learned to regret thiS decision on tbose long hikes to the bank during Schenectady's chilling winter months. Living on the lower end of campus, I took to the habit of freQuenting the Union Street Branch. Soon, I learned what \customer service\ was all about in their eyes. Continual endless, infinite waiting for every minute transaction and the subsequent phone call to Nott Street's one line to approve the status of my account was only the beginning. In the end, I think it was the hours-the in- convenient ridiculous hours- that shook the foundations ·of my belief in the Norstar system. Who ever heard of a b&nk open 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Friday and 3:30-5:30 on Fridays ~ as well. Inevitably, I would arrive at 2:05 to an empty locked bank further unnerved by the sneers of the few tellers who watched anq laughed £tom · within. . But the Drive Through was always open. Splendid, I said to myself as I proceeded to walk through. \Sorry you must be in a car to be served,\ said the teller. I then began to plead with a total stranger to let me into his car in. order to carry out the transaction. Ironically this was one of the few times I needed to deposit money!!! The teller, after careful serutiny of me and ·my·· new · found acquaintence, promptly said, \One transaction per carload.\ Even though there was nobody in the Drive Through at the time, we ·were forced to drive in circles four times before all our business was finally completed, since the driver himself had thr-ee of his own transactions to do. I'm sure just the spectacle ·Of us driving around the block provided enough entertainment to those within for weeks of gossip. Needless to say, we became good friends-the driver and l- and sympathetic understanders of the world of banking at: · Norstar as well. Although I speak only through personal experience on this heated topic, it is surprising what effect just a casual mention or mere whisper of the word Norstar will have on the general public at Union College. Such an event sparks a wealth of comments, stories both vicious and true, and laughter. Perhaps Norstar has not lived up to our expectations of a proper banking institution, but at least it continues to uphold an infamoys reputation which has been the source of many an ~ Graduation! i !o·••'•••••••••••••••·•••••e••=• unforgettable memory and friendship.

Page 10 CONCORDIENSIS, May8, 198~ ______ Fo~ al Union Collt!(!t 1877 __ ~--...,. Dear Parents, If you can stand it one more time; Welcome to Union. .t).s a campus newspaper, Concordiensis serves as a vital record of College history. Throughout the past school year our pages have be.en filled with what have ~ resulted in some interesting developments. We are now finding that, after a not-so-brief hiatus,. students are once again becoming involved in the world around them. This academic year has seen a revival in student involvement. The Union students' apathy has begun to disappear and we have taken an interest in world affairs as well as campus issqes. During your weekend stay, take some time to talk with your son or daughter. Realize the changes which have taken place in their development. This is the most exciting time of our lives and it has recently been made more so by our newly reviv~d interests. From what we hear, Union· students are not the only ones who are experiencing this renewed enthusiasm. Apparently, this is a national trend. There doesn't seem to be a threat .of this sentiment becoming another '60's decade •. but we would merely like to think of our thoughts as \healthy questioning.\ So, ask your child what they think about the Libyan situation or the Soviet nuclear crisis. More im- medi~tely, ask them how they really feel about the time they are spending here at Union. How do they like dorm living? What is the social life like now that the drinking age has gone up? Are their classes meeting up to their standards and yours? There is a list of questions that could go on and on. The important thing to remember is that we are beginning to re~lize the importance of our input on campus issues and we'd like your ideas as well. Recognize how important your voice is also. If you're dissatisfied with some aspect of Union, let somebody know about it. If you're happy about something, too, let someone know that as well. Just as we have begun to think critically about our lives at Union and our role in the world, we'd like for you to think about these issues as well. The entire editorial board of Concordiensis would like to extend its best wishes for a wonderful weekend. We're glad to have you here at Union. Strong Greek System On May 9, 1985, Concordiensis editorialized that \the groundwork has been set for a fourth sorority here at Union, and it is about time.\ In what has been ex~ctly one year, we have seen the fruition of the Ganuna Phi Beta sorority. The chapter was officially installed at a function this past weekend. But, the inclusion of the sorority has had more significance than sim{>IY the addition of one more Greek-letter organizatiOn. This chapter has shown that the Union community has . experienced a resurgence in the strength of the Greek system. An overwhelming turnout of about 150 women at- tended Gamma Phi Beta's informational meetings and 48 were eventually chosen to become sisters. If anything, this shows that Union would even be able to support a fifth sorority if the housing problem could be solved! In the February 28, 1985 edition of Concordiensis Dean Massa stated that \the College supports fraternities as long ~s they are in line with .the major purpose and regulat10ns of the College.'' This backing of the Greek system (while other colleges have fallen by the wayside) must be commended. During the past few years, students at Union have been extremely supportive of the system and many hav~ conunented that their experience at their fraternity or sorority ranks high among their learning/ growth experiences here at Union. Moreover, when the social life of the College has taken a turn for the worse, the fraternity and sorority have remained as the last vestige of a stron~ social environment. While the Greek system is not flawless, its con- tribution to the campus community, and more itnu portantly, the i.deals that each fraternity/s. orority teachs its own brothers and sisters are im- measurable. Thus, as the Gamma Phi Beta sorority has shown us, it has been a wise move on the part of the ad- ministration to continue in its· support of the Greek system. -~~ ~-. - - - --~--~ ---· --- ----~ - .,___.;..~ ---- ~~ - . .._ ~ ~~ - . LETTERS AND COMM·ENTARIES Bake's Purpose: Raise Dough To the Editor: In the May 1, 1986 edition of the Concordiensis an ad- vertisement was printed an- nouncing Sigma Chi'S 18th Annual \Bake.\ This ad- . vertisement included a slogan. \Bake Time is Miller Time.\ In past years we used this slogan · to advertise our \Bake.\ This slogan was printed because Miller Brewing Co. · donates painter hats and frisbees to add to the festive atmosphere, as well as paying for advertisements. Unfortunately, by our own mistake, this slogan was erroneously included this year . With this advertisement, we did· not intend to imply tbat alcohol will be available at the \Bake.\ The \Bake's\ pUrpoSe is to raise money for Wallace Village, Sigma ChPs national philantbrophy. Proceeds. are also channeled into many needy local charities. The \Bake\ is a time for the campus community to convene for a social gathering, wbose main purpose is to raise money for charity, while .providing entertainment and fun in the sun. The brothers of Sigma Chi J:'egt~t that our ad contained the Miller slogan. We hope that th'4l advertise:rnent _was not misceonstrued by the campus community, and that you now know the true nature of this year's \Bake.\ Respectfully, The Brothers of Sigma Chi Amnesty Works Thanks to .Volunteers To the Editor: To all those members of the Panhellenic Council and Student Forwn who volunteered their time during library am· nesty days, thank you! The support t)f these student organizations for the amnesty program is most gratifying. More than 300. overdue items were returned and are once again available for use by the College community. Sincerely, Mary Cahill Acting Cir:-culation Librarian · · · Commentary Civil Liberties By BRIANM. KELLY . A very significant event happened last March that will surely be remembered as a step forward or out of America'.s prejudice past. This event is passing of the Gay Rights bill ·which recently took place in the . city of New York in March of 1986. For years the bill has been locked up within the General Welfare Committee, the committee of which the bill had to pass in order to be placed before the City Council for final approval (pending upon the Mayor's signature). Thanks to Peter Vallone, the new Majority Leader of the Council, who promised 1 that if he won, he would appoint members to the Yom Ha'Shoa To the Editor, This past week Jews throughout the world took time to remember those who were systematically annihilate!~ during the Holocaust. Yom Ha'Shoa, Holocaust Remem- brance Day, has oee11 established so that the world never forgets the horrors of tbe Nazi Regime in Em·ope. It is felt that through understanding and remembering the atrocities wrought by hatred, no people will ever again be the victim of wholesale slaughter. I bring up this point because of a specific incident whi(!h occurred on campus this past week. A group of flyers ad.- vertising Holocaust Remem· brance Day, in Fox Dormitoey, were ripped down and destroyed. This incident alone i£ not of great importance. Students generally ·find thE barrage of notices and flyers~ in dormitories, annoying and riJ> them down. What makes tbiS incident particularly disgusting is that a single flyer was left taped to the wall and sub- sequently burned. I do not request an apology b-y the people who did the van· dalism; nor do I want to evoke the sympathy of the Uni()n College conununity. . This past Tuesday was dedicated to commemorate those who perished. A few people on campus made a violent and repulsive statement of hatred. I hope we can learn from · this incident that Holocaust Remembrance Day has as much importanee for us now, as it does for those wh.o died. · Mitchell J. Stein 1 87 Co-President- J&1J General Welfare Committee without taking .into con· sideration their position on the Gay Rights bill. As a result of his victory in being elected the Majority Leader, those ap- pointed to the GWC voted 4 to 2 in favor of the bill. After passage in tbe GWC, the bill was put before the City Council which also passed by a vote of 21 to 14. Mayor Koch 'bent over ba(!kwards'to sign it, thus becoming a law in early March. The bill itself amended the previous discrfmination codes which now prohibits any discrimination on the basis of· sexual preference., be it heterosexual, ho:mosexual, and bisexual, in public housing, commercial space, em- ployment, and public ac- commodations (e.g. hotels) among others. The passing of the law takes no position in favor or against any particular person's sexual orientation. As a citizen, I would prefer to .see the U.S. Con- . stitution be interpreted to guarantee the civil liberties of all people regardless of their differences and sexual preferences. Unfortunately, unless laws such as the Civil Rights Act o£1964 and other Gay Rights bills are passed, a -significantnwnber of .citizens in our country will be denied their basic Civil Liberties, in that open discrimination against them would otherwise be tolerated. The passage of the Gay Rights bill in New 'York City is the beginnin~ of what I hope will be a wide spread movement to prevent societal discrimination against those individuals who choose. to live an alternative life style. A Gay Rights bill similar to that in New York is currently in effect in over 50 . municipalitie.s, in thi!!:. country. For this tre11d to continue, the issue we face is whether society and its institlltions will continue to attempt to dietate a par- ticular \Norm\ or whether · society will a(!vance to the state where it accepts and allows free citizens to find happiness with whomever tlley may choose. . . As a conservative, I applaud th~ passage ,of the Gay Rights bill and believe strongly that the government should not only get off the backs of citizens in business but also in their beds. ' ., ...

CDNCORDIENSIS, May 8, 1986 Page 13 SCIENCE., HEALTH, AND TECHNOLOGY Fast Food .. It's Your Life By~ J. HELFAND All right all you .fast food junkies and junkettes, fasten your seatbelts or pass this one by, because it's a doozy. Ever since The Center for Science1 in the Public IQterest ( CSPI.) released its findings on: the fast food industry, millions have lost their lunch, literally. How ironic it seems that in this fat, cholesterol, and health- conscious America, fast food cnains use BEEF TALLOW on Chicken, fish, and french fries! So what, you say? Well, how about this statistic: chicken sandwiches (you know, the one you order when you'r.e dieting) contains as much fat as a pint and a half of ice cream. Hey, they're not THAT good! The criminal here is beef tallow. Tallow is the worst kind of fat. It is trimmed from meat cuts. and. m~de into shortening, leavmg 1t htghly saturated a state that incites the body to produce cholesterol and decrease the body'-s ability to break down and excrete excess cholesterol.' .Children who are . major consumers in the fast food in- dustry are susceptible to the first stages of atherosclerosis from the age of two. This condition is one in Which fat and cholesterol contribute to the formation of plaque on the inner walls of arteries, narrowing the channels through which blood flows. Recent studies have linked a lower incidence of certain cancers to populations with tow- fat diets, and low-fat diets are also recoriunended for ctni- trolling diabetes; Physicians .major concern, however, _is. The National Institute of Health (NIH) and other related- agencies recommend a 25 percent cut in all dietary fat. Considering that the average person consumes· 89 grams of fat. a day, according to the CSPI; this would entail a cut to 67 grams (a ·Wendy's triple cheeseburger has 67 grams of fat itself! ) - Another startling figure is that 16 percent of an average American's caloric intake comes from saturated fats. The NIH wouldlike to see this figure drop to 10 percent, and , hopefully, though not realistically, to 0. Though I can't honestly s~y I plan to go ''cold chicken\ I hope I've convinced everyone to try and cut down on fast foods, and other foods high in fat and cholesterol. If not, Have It Your Way!

A possible reason for this increase (six percent over last year) is the alternative foods now of- fered. Food tiems .such as the fish fillet and chicken sandwich appear to have superior nutritional value and are thus more appealing to health and y.reight conscious patrons. These beliefs are not true. As a matter of fact, fatty-acid profiles done on McDonald's Chicken McNuggets and Filet-0-Fish and on Burger King's Chicken Sandwich and · Whaler;' found~ them to resemble beef more than fish or chicken. choiesterol, whfch is a prime cause of coronary heart disease, America's number one killer.

Their reason for using beef tallow is simple \it produces the highest quality finished product and the best- tasting one.\ There's no denying that Americans believe this to be true, for it is expected that $51.2 billion will be spent in 1986 on the fast food industry. By BENJAMIN HAFTEL . Well, sports fans, here we are again: yet another week has passed speedily by. This week marks yet another first in the historical annals of our much heralded· Concordiensis, 'Through the Flawk's _Eye' is appear-ing in two consecutive issues! Yes, you heard it right- two consecutive issues! I'll tell The Nuclear Dilemma: USvs. USSR By SPIKE BERGERON Eussia's fatal nuclear ac- cident at the Chernobyl nuclear power· plant raises the' question of the quality of safety precautions taken at American nuclear power plants. This disaster, which has released possibly dangerous levels of radiation across most of Europe resulting in the deaths of ap- proximately 2,100 people so far according to Western scientists, is certainly the result of poor safety regulations imposed by the Soviets. The inadequacies of the Russian nuclear system stem from the Soviets' desire to greatly increase their _power output while conserving money. The Russians believe that if the plant is built correctly then there is no need for safety precautions because nothing should go wrong. The Soviet disregard for safety is so great that many nuclear reactors are built in or near heavily populated areas. 'fhe Soviet Union's main safety problem is the lack of containment chambers around the reactors. These buildings, which are made of steel and reinforced concrete, cut down over 50 percent of the radiation released and provide over two days for people to evacuate in the event of an accident. At least 25 Soviet reactors· do not have any typ.e of containment building, tl!,ough the ~ewer reactors are des1gned with this structure. If the Chernobyl reactor had a con- tainment stUrcture at the time . of the explosion, hundreds of lives would have been saved. So how do American reactors compare to the Russian systems? As required by., the Nuclear Regulatory Com- mission, all Of the United States commercial reactors are en· closed by a protective sturc· ture. However, the Energy Department's five reactors do not have to meet such stan· dards. The Energy Department has four operating reactors in South Carolina and one in Washington without con- tainment structures. In the U.S., when a utility company wishes to design a reactor tbey are subjected to public and government scrutiny to prove the safety and practicality of the power plant; something that the Soviet government does not undergo when they construct their reactors. From such scrutiny, elaborate safety systems are developed by American utilities to prevent and contro]aceidents.American commercial reactors are required to be equipped with reservoirs of water which can be pumped into the reactor at great pressure to slow a reaction in an emergency. Because utilities must answer to the American public and government their · safety precautions are much better than the Soviet self-regulated systems. Although some American reactors use graphite as did the Chernobyl reactors, the U.S. plants are cooled with _ helium Which is much safer than the Soviet method of water cooling. Of course, there is always a possibility of another American nuclear accident, but the chance is small when the safety precautions of American reactors are considered. @ 5~1)(.{ ~-h~ 08i'eru~ §led- ~fi' ·~~~\;fsffl<·\~ you though, no one was more surprised than I to discover this interesting development. As a result, I had to begin my research immediately for this article. Alas, I found that I was at a complete loss for a topic. I searched and I searched but to no avail. Friends . .suggested such topics as the state health care at Union, the treatment of student patients at Ellis Haspital (we'll put that one on a back burner for a week or two), the genetic traits of the Albanian dwarf-but none of these seemed appropriate for Parents' Weekend. The recent nuclear reactor accident seemed to be the topic, but when l found that Comrade Gor- bachev was reported to be having an affair with Ann Landers at his summer retreat ···in the Ukraine, the whole affair became too much of a catastrophe for me to report. All of a sudden, as if by divine intervention, the ideal subject appeared before my eyes ·on my 45\ big screen color TV - a simple commercial message - HEMORRHOIDS!! YUCH! ! BLECH!! EL PUKO!! Web- . ster's illustrious dictionary defines hemorrhoids as an it-· ching or painful mass of dilated mass in swollen anal tissue. Since most of us have this un· pleasant condition to look forwa1d to in our future geriatric lives, I thought that this wEek I would discuss a rece[Jt development in the treatm;ent of this horrible af- flictiOil. Treatm-ent with Infrared Ught PioJJeer rectal surgeon John O'Conn~f' ()f George Washington Univel\sit~ lias devised a pistonlike d.evice that fires a beam of infrared light to purge the painful piles from the poor vietim 's bod.y~ Dr. O'Connor adv()cates tbe use of this treatment beeause of its in- expensiveness as well as the relative lack: of pain to the patient compared to other teehniqaes; such as the widely usecl \rubber-band\ ligation ( whtcll eonstricts the hernorrl:loid in order to 'dry' it up-a pr-eferred technique for those forks with an avid interest in sado-mas()chism). 'l'o ()pera.tethe infrared device, it is gently f)ressed against the pile, andtlle trigger is squeezed (gently. CJf course) causing a blust of infrared light that immediately shrinks the hemorrl1oid, replacing it with a small scar. This entire surgical procedurE may be done in a doctor's office and lasts only fiftee11 minutes. The cost of this tr-eatment is $150-$450, a discomt rate is usually given to fr-eqtL~nt patients. The tecbnical name for this treatmeni is infrared coagulatbn, and, according to I>r. O'Connor will soon replace the liSllal $2,000 surgery. He says, \Anyone familiar with rectal stlrgery and the other nCJn·surgieal procedures used in treatin;f,i hemorrhoids can learn to !Ule tbis treatment rie;ht a1Vay.'\ Forget law school;.

THE ARTS at Proctor's Theatre • • • Kiss Me, Kate By ILYSSE FEINGOLD Even on a Sunday afternoon when the weather was sunny and mild, Proctor's theatre was filled with the enthusiastic matinee viewers ... As we an- ticipated the start of Kiss Me, Kate, a musical presented by the Schenectady Light Opera Cornpany which ran from May 1-4, the Schenectady Arts Council honfrred Channel 6 WRJB, and the Mills family for their continuous contribution to the arts. Kiss Me, Kate, a show with music and lyrics by Cole Porter, is based on William Shakespeare's \The Taming of the Shrew.'' Kiss Me, Kate is a play within a play. It is a production about the trials and tribulations of a theatre com- pany that presents a Shakespearean drama, while at the same time it personified the character's personal problems. Allan Foster and Patricia Searle, respectively, played the leading roles. Both these in- dividuals are important figures of the Schenectady Light Opera Company not only on stage but also off stage. Allan Foster acted as the company's past president and Patricia Searle is Vice President of the company operations and also serves on the Board of Directors. The first duet that Ms. Searle and Mr. Foster sang as Lilli and Fred, reminisced their past love for each other. The irony of this song was that the couple is now divorced. This song called \Wunderbar\ is illustrated two resonant voices in perfect harmony. The tonal quality was clear and the voices blended well. Neither overpowered the other. They also used this song to contrast the present frustration that they feel for each other. In the play's plot this song established a con- nection between these two leading characters, the closeness was enhanced by a waltz which they danced. Their dancing was just as syn- chronized as their singing. I immensely enjoyed Patricia's LUli and Katherine's operatic display in \So in Love.'' This song exemplified her fine diction. It also demonstrated Patricia's acting ability. She successfully used a prop, a bouquet of flowers, to profess her love to Fred. Another thrilling performance by Patricia was \I Hate Men.\ This is sung with wrath and contrasts the virtuous character which she previously played. Patricia gave the song the gusto that was needed to be effective. Not only was there definition in her voice, but there was power in her actions too. She struck a mug to a wooden table. Allan Foster, Fred and Petruchio, had wonderful command of the stage. One of his strengths was in his deliverance of the lines. His monologue prior to his solo showed his ability to create a character with the evil and vigor of Shakespeare's Iago. Allan always elicited the correct response from the audience. \Where Is the Life That Late I Led,\ in Act II was the pinnacle of Allan's per- formance. He displayed the art of integrating song and speech. His Italian accent was amusing and he used effective movements to supplement his singing. Allan had incredible voice projection. He was noticed whether he lay on a table or stood on one. Another gifted actress and singer is Linda Dierkes, Lois and Bianca. She fantastically suited this character role of a dizzy flirt. Linda shone whenever she was on stage. Her best number was \Always True to You in My Fashion,\ where she was sexy an<} seductive. She showed the audience all her \stuff\ as she wiggled and shook. Linda had an interesting CAMP UNION '86 MAY 30-31 -movies -bands -comedian -fun -food -t-shirts -Air band quality to her voice. It was a clear alto which became raspy in order to enhance her role as a man enticer. The gangsters deserve to be especially recognized. The audience · loved them. Their song of \Brush Up Your Shakespeare'' . was funny, energetic, and po1sed. These two performers, Dave Charles and Russell Palmer, seemed very cued to each other. They were versed in their deliver&nce of the lines. Their dance routine was beautifully synchronized and their voices complemented each other, Another favorite number of mine was \Too Darn Hot,\ which featured Michael Dale, as Paul. He had superb rhythm in both his singing and dancing. The shows' one flaw was the dancing. The choreography for the ensemble was rather uninteresting; their movements were imprecise and left un• polished. The show's strengths were in costwne design. The colorful costumes of royal blues, greens, and pastel shades all added appeal to the overall performance. The .set design was not complex, though the scene changes are efficient. The orchestra conducted by Christine Patrick. played as a wonderfully strong and reliable unit which always supported the vocalist. In entirety, Kiss Me, Kate received audience approval. It was a well cast production which recognizes individual talent as well as collective talent. The Schenectady Light Opera Company's upcoming schedule is as follows: H. M.S.

Weekend in the Arts By .PENNIMORGANSTEIN As the Arts program at Union College grew there was a need to form a dance ensemble. Alan Tuckman realized this need and in the fall .of 1984 founded the Union College Dance Ensemble. It was his hope to create a dance ensemble which would utilize classroom experience in per- formance. This weekend his efforts as well as the efforts of Michelle Manley, a key organizer, and the members of the ensemble will be featured at the Nott. Also featured at this per- . formance is the Myers Dance Company which is under the direction of Darlene Myers. Entrance into this local dance company is by invitation only. The company boasts 13 dancers, eight of whom are women and five of whom are men. Their ages range from 16-35 years. On Monday evening the en- semble went through a dress rehearsal. The Nott came alive with beautiful music, costumes, dancers and creative choreography. The ensemble provides a range of dance repetoires and music, including classics as well as modern day artists such as Lauri Anderson and Sting. This wide range enables the ensemble to .appeal to a diverse audience. Enhancing the performance is the Nott itself. This is an ab- solutely spectacular en- vironment in which to perform ballet. It allows the audience to really feel involved with the dancers. The dancers {whose training origins are modern, ballet, jazz and tap dancing} are the following students: Lisa Ballesteros, Amy Basis, Katherine Boyd, Jennifer Johnson, Carol Levy, Michelle Manley, Penny Neubauer, Ashley Oliver. Patricia Pasqualini, Nancy Schutz, and Alan Tuclnnan. The. performances will be on Saturday, May 10, 1986 at 2:30 p.m. and Sunday May 11, 1986 at 12: 15 p.m. General admission is $2 and is $1 with a student I.D.

Walker, Mozart and Haydn ~OTT tfiil1EMOF.IAL 8:00 PM By PENNIMORGANSTEIN Professor Hilary. Tann of the Arts Department began her career at Union College five years ago. At this juncture there was no orchestra, leaving Professor Tann solely in charge of 'the Chamber Music Program. The history of Orchestral Development at Union is as briefly follows. In 1965 Union College hosted the Northeastern New York Student Orchestra, founded by Edgar Curtis. This orchestra was dissolved in the spring of 1979 unable to boast more than a dozen active Union ·College students. The present Empire State Youth Orchestra evolved from this dissolved Nor- theastern New York Student Orchestra. In September of 1985 Professor Tann sent out notices claiming that the creation of an orchestra at Union College was a feasible goal and proceeded accordingly. Bywinter term the ensemble was organized in its entirety. The mutual efforts and enthusiasm of Profess()r Tann and the Ensemble have resulted in the creation of the first student orchestra at Union College. This is an ex- traordinary accomplishment which is deserving of much attention. When asking the members of the orchestra about their in- volvement everyone responded enthusiastically about the music program and the op- portunity to perform in the orchestra. This special op~ portunity can only be found in a small college community such as Union. · Senior Janice C. Thompson who is still unsure of her post graduate activities would like to continue playing. This Sunday she will be per- forming a piano solo with or· chestral accompaniment. She regards this as \a fantastic 1 opportunity\ and is quite ex- cited. UNION COLLEGE SPEAKERS FORUM PRESENTS DAVID STEINBERG FRIDAY, MAY 9,. 1986 MEMORIAL CHAPEL - 8:00 P.M. $2.00 GENERAL ADMISSION The overall consensus is that there are many benefits to participating in the orchestra. Not only does it enable students to continue their musical careers once in college, but also offers a very needed break from academics. This Sunday's performance of the Union College Chamber Orchestra will feature a modern piece composed by Gwyneth Walker. She is a graduate of Brown University and a resident of New Canaan, Connecticut. There will also be a piano concerto in C major, K. 467, W.A. Mozart followed by a F.J. Haydn symphony. The orchestra is comprised of 23 Union College students, 4 professors, including professor Tann as conductor, as well as 2 staff members. The per- formance is at Memorial Chapel this Sunday, May 11, 1986 from 2:00-3:00 p.m. Admission is free and will be followed by a small reception.

At this juncture there was no orchestra, leaving Professor Tann solely in charge of the Chamber Music Program. The history of Orchestral Development at Union is as briefly follows. In 1965 Union College hosted the Northeastern New York Student Orchestra, founded by Edgar Curtis. This orchestra was dissolved in the spring of 1979 unable to boast more than a dozen active Union College students. The present Empire State Youth Orchestra evolved from this dissolved Nor- theastern New York Student Orchestra. In September of 1985 Professor Tann sent out notices claiming that the creation of an orchestra at Union College was a feasible goal and proceeded accordingly. By winter term the ensemble was organized in its entirety. The mutual efforts and enthusiasm of Professor Tann and the Ensemble have resulted in the creation of the first student orchestra at Union College. This is an ex- traordinary accomplishment which is deserving of much attention. When asking the members of the orchestra about their in- volvement everyone responded enthusiastically about the music program and the op- portunity to perform in the orchestra. This special op- portunity can only be found in a small college community such as Union. Senior Janice C. Thompson who is still unsure of her post graduate activities would like to continue playing. This Sunday she will be per- forming a piano solo with or- chestral accompaniment. She regards this as ''a fantastic , opportunity\ and is quite ex- cited. UNION COLLEGE SPEAKERS FORUM PRESENTS DAVID STEINBERG FRIDAY, MAY 9, 1986 MEMORIAL CHAPEL - 8:00 P.M. $2.00 GENERAL ADMISSION The overall consensus is that there are many benefits to participating in the orchestra. Not only does it enable students to continue their musical careers once in college, but also offers a very needed break from academics. This Sunday's performance of the Union College Chamber Orchestra will feature a modern piece composed by Gw)11eth Walker. She is a graduate of Brown Universitv and a resident of New Canaan, Connecticut. There will also be a piano concerto in C major, K. 467, W.A. Mozart followed bv a F .J. Haydn symphony. The orchestra is comprised of 23 Union College students. 4 professors, including professor Tann as conductor, as well as 2 staff members. The per- formance is at Memorial Chapel this Sunday, May 11, 1986 from 2:00-3:00 p.m. Admission is free and will be followed by a small reception.

CONCORDlENSJS, May tl, 1986 By DOUGLAS LLOYD Athlete of the Week No one other than Kristi Tierney could have been chosen for this week's ('Athlete of the Week.'' Kris, a1 freshman, has .sparked the softball team and has 4 shutouts this season and G; has been the back bone of the 8 team. ~· ....... The team is 12-4, While win.. IJ) ning their last 12 and are the No.. £ 2 Seed in this weekend's New .S York State Association of g Intercollegiat.,!:l Athletics Soft- c. hall Tournament. Kris has pitched 93.1 of the team's 105 innings and sports an amazing 1.73 E.R.A.s She has struck out •62 of her opponents Kristine Tierney while only giving up 70 hits. The Canton, Mass. nativebas only giv:en up 23 earned runs at Union since graduating from Cantor high lastspring. Kris also plays field hoc~ey for the Dutch women and was a starter last fall. · Last year the team fin~hed third in the NYSALA to111ney and with Kris' pitching in J)eak · form, the softball team sllollld be a solid contender to wih the whole tournament. Best .of luck to the women's softball team and congratulations to Kris Tierney. Union Crew Finishes Up By 209 OARSMEN This past weekend, both the men's and women's crew teams travelled to Lake Waramug in Kent, CT. There, Union's crews raced against their toughest competition of this spring season. Represented there,. aside from Union, were Trinity, Williams, Marist, and Ithaca. Unfortunately, the conditions were the roughest Union crews have faced this season. A brutal headwind and subsequent rough water, coupled with Union's inexperience in such conditions, put our rowers at a substantial disadvantage. The onW laural of the weekend goes to the Game Pitcher No. Woll Perlman A 2 Valachovic 5 4 Horan 5 3 Alves 5 1 Bartosch 7 4 Weidman 5 0 Cannon 3 .0 Giordano 0 Connolly 0 women's eight, who in the last 500 meters of the 2000m course, .managed to sprlnt by their rival Ithaca. , In response to this poor showing, this weeks practices have been structured, in an- ticipation of simUar conditions in Philadelphia, where Union will race in the Dad Vail Regatta on May 9th and loth. The Dad Vails are traditionally the culminati()n of the spring season for most of the smaller East coast rowing programs. For Union, \the Vails'' represent our last and most prestegious chance to establish our position among our com- petition. This year' Union will Pitching Stats Lost IP H R 0 7 9 5 0 24 25 19 1 311/3 42 24 0 9 2/3 10 6 l 322/3 35 26 0 121/3 13 19 2 '· 19 2/3 26 22 0 42/3 12 7 l 2 5 7 send four eights to the Vails; the women's open, men's varsity heavies, men's J ..

The toughest races of the weekend will no doubt be tl1ose of the novice and J-V heavies. These unsung heroes will be at serious disadvantage agamst schools with larger programs. Even as you read this article, the crews are on the road to Philly. Give us a thoaght tomorrow as we take tCJ the water in our garnet and -wl!ite.

Page 19 Qluucnrbiensis S RTS GLENS FALlS-Last Sun- day, middleweight Stephon Frost battered Mike Peoples of Montic~llo, and won the schedulEd eight round fight by unanimous decision. Frost. an electrical . engineering student at Union, did not lose a round on either of the three judge's scorecards and completely dominated the fight. \Stephan was not over- powering, but was impressive. This was a good fight for Stephon\ said Steve Rooney, Stephon's trainer. Stephon was able to jab very effectively in the early roWlds, which tired Peoples and made him very ineffective during much of the fight. Undefeated as a professional, Stephan. boasts a 8.()..1 record with 4 KO's. Although this was not Stephon's most over- whehning fight, it was a good test for him to go 8 rounds against a formidable opponent. \I'm in good shape and I didn't ·feel drained when the fight was over\ said Stephon. Stephon was not the only Wldefeated fighter to go the distance on Sunday. Mike Tyson, the undefeated heavyweight,~ who had won all of his previous 1g fights by Charlie Slotnik Looking at Sports knockout went the fulllO rounds defeating James \Quick\ Tillis by unanimous decision. By consistently winning and putting on a good show for the crowd Stephon is able to box on the major fight cards in the Capital District, and gain local recognition. The feature fight of the last three .fight cards in the area have been televised nationally on either ABC's \Wide World of Sports\ or CBS's \Sports Saturday .. \ In a region that lacks major professional baseball, hockey, football, or basketball, boxing is on the rise in the Capital District with the prospect of Mike Tyson as a future heavyweight champion. When Tyson fights, it is not unusual to see crowds of over 7000 people in a local arena. Stephon Frost has been fortunate enough to be fighting in an area that has such an attraction as Mike Tyson. Hopefully, Tyson will continue to fight in the Capital District, and Frost will continue to fight on the undercard.

The team is 12-4, while win- ning their last 12 and are the No. 2 seed in this weekend's New York State Association of Intercollegiate Athletics Soft- ball Tournament. Kris has pitched 93.1 of the team's 105 innings and sports an amazing 1.73 E.R.A.s She has struck out •62 of her opponents Qi 1:1 0 ::J +- If) >- .0 0 +- 0 .c: a. Kristine Tierney while only giving up 70 hits. The Canton, Mass. native has only given up 23 earned runs at Union since graduating from Cantor high last spring. Kris also plays field hockey for the Dutchwomen and was a starter last fall. Last year the team finished third in the NYSALA tourney and with Kris' pitching in peak form, the softball team should be a solid C(:>ntender to win the whole tournament. Best of luck to the women's softball team and congratulations to Kris Tierney. Union Crew Finishes Up By 209 OARSMEN This past weekend, both the men's and women's crew teams travelled to Lake Waramug in Kent, CT. There, Union's crews raced against their toughest competition of this spring season. Represented there, aside from Union, were Trinity, Williams, Marist, and Ithaca. Unfortunately, the conditions were the roughest Union crews have faced this season. A brutal headwind and subsequent rough water, coupled with Union's inexperience in such conditions, put our rowers at a substantial disadvantage. The onl:Y !aural of the weekend goes to the Game women's eight, who in the last 500 meters of the 2000m course, managed to sprint by their rival Ithaca. In response to this poor showing, this weeks practices have been structured in an- ticipation of similar conditions in Philadelphia, where Union will race in the Dad Vail Regatta on May 9th and loth. The Dad Vails are traditionally the culmination of the spring season for most of the smaller East coast rowing programs. For Union, \the Vails\ represent our last and most prestegious chance to establish our position among our com- petition. This year Union will Pitching Stats send four eights to the Vails; the women's open, men's varsity heavies, men's J-V heavies, and the men's novice heavies. In light of this past season, the two varsity boats are expected to do well on Friday and qualify for the final heats on Saturday. The toughest races of the weekend will no doubt be those of the novice and J-V heavies. These unsung heroes will be at serious disadvantage against schools with larger programs. Even as you read this article, the crews are on the road to Philly. Give us a thought tomorrow as we take to the water in our garnet and white.

Page 19 Olnucnriliensis SPORTS CharUe Slotnik Lo:oking at Sports GLENS FALLS-Last Sun- day, middleweight Stephon Frost battered Mike Peoples of Monticello, and won the scheduled eight round fight by unanimous decision. Frost, an electrical engineering student at Union, did not lose a round on either of the three judge's scorecards and comp1etely dominated the fight. \Stephon was not over- powering, but was impressive. This was a good fight for Stephon\ said Steve Rooney, stephon's trainer. Stephen was able to jab very effectively in the early rounds, which tired Peoples and made him very ineffective during much of the fight. Undefeated as a professional, Stephon boasts a 8-0-1 record with 4 KO's. Although this was not Stephen's most over- whehning fight, it was a good test for him to go 8 rounds against a formidable opponent. \I'm in good shape and I didn't feel drained when the fight was over\ said Stephon. Stephon was not the only undefeated fighter to go the distance on Sunday. Mike Tyson, the undefeated heavyweight, who had won all of his previous 19 fights by knockollt went the fulllO rounds defeatillg James \Quick\ Tillis by UNanimous decision. By consistently winning and putting on a good show for the crowd Stephon is able to box on the major fight cards in the Capital District, and gain local recogniti()n. The feature fight of the last three fight cards in the area have been televised nationally on either ABC's \Wide World of Sports\ or CBS's •csports Saturday.\ In a region that lacks major professional baseball, hockey, football, ()r basketball, box:ing is on the rise in the Capital District with the prospect of Mike Tyson as a future heavyweight champion. When Tyson fights, it is not unusual to see cmwds of over 7000 people in a local arena. Stephon Frost has been fortllrlate enough to be fighting in an area that has such an attraction as Mike Tyson. Hopefully, Tyson will continue to fight in the Capital District, and Frost will continue to fight on the undercard. Both, only 19 years of age are destined for future success, Tyson in the ring, and Frost if not in the ring, as an electrical engineer.

May 8,1986 Women's Softball Wins 13 Straight . . . seeded 2nd in N. Y.A.I.A. Tourney - By VALERIE SAR\VIN The Lady Dutchmen look sharp after twelve consecutive wins. The team which got off to a dull start was recuperating from a tiring road trip. With the onset of Spring Break the Dutchmen drove south for some practice games. before the season opener on April 9th at Albany State. Although the team proved to be extremely successful in Myrtle Beach, the experience was not enough to strengthen the desperately needed hitting offense in their first four attempts. Despite the initial disappointment, it was evident that the women had more to offer than their record showed. Tri&captained by junior Jeannie Haller and seniors Kim Mangino and Regina Zaccardo, the team has really worked hard together. Their first well deserved victory came in their contest against Lehman College. The Lady Dutchmen outscored their opponent 17-1 with a strong offensive attack. The less competitive schedule which was to follow boosted the team's confidence as they blew away Skidmore in a double- header, 17-1 and 11-3. Skillful running and professional like dives by Rhonda Bogues enhanced the game's ex- citement. · The only damper that was evident in the match against Sienna was the rainy weather. Otherwise the game marked another win balancing the women's record at four wins, four losses. St. Rose was not as easily defeated as were the prior teams. The game was hard fought and the outcome, favorable. The lady Softballers clutched the win in the seventh inning. A respectable catching job was performed by backup Regina Zaccardo. She replaced Jean Monaco who injured her knee while successfully stealing second base. Reg also aided in batting where her composure held firm. In the thick of the pressure Reg pulled through for the Dutchmen and even scored the game winning run. Tammy Richardson had an impressive day on the field. From her third base position she scrambled into foul territory to make difficult put-outs. On Saturday the 26th Union women played virtually im- peccable ball as they shut down Hamilton in both games of a double-header. Freshman pitcher Kris Tierney deserves credit for taking Union the distance. Her speed and con- sistency helped to wash away Hamilton's offense. Union's fielders were also instrumental in limiting the Hamilton base runners to a minimum. Sophomore Colleen Dundon's tremendous catches in left field prevented Hamilton's key batter from receiving any hits. Designated Hitter:. Jenn Stolz was also in true form as she drilled the ball, finding holes in the competition's defense. End of the month play brought back to back games against R.P.I and Oneonta. The tight contest with RPI was relieved as Kris Tierney stepped into the batters box. Her steady bat had no second thoughts where on contact it was obvious that this was the game winning hOmer. As Kriss crossed the plate, tight :faces turned happy as team members realiZed acceptance to post season play was possible. Birthday girl Shelly Pifio had her best game batting three for four against Oneonta. Mean- Laxmen Defeat R.P .1. Capture Capital District Cup ByCPSIS After three minutes into the RPI game last week, the prospect of the Dutchmen winning the game to capture the Capital District Clip was not good. RPI had scored three unanswered goals in the early minutes of the game and it looked as if the Lam1en were gcing to be trounced by their crosstown rivals. However, the traditionally late starting Union team was not about to loose that easily on their home turf. The Dutchmen fought back in the first quarter with goalS by Attackmen Phil Horn and John Romeo to tie the score at four. With the momentum· seemingly on their side, the team went into the second quarter CQnfident they could pull ahead. However, RPI pwnped in two quick goals and scored a third to outscore the Laxmen 3-0 in the second quarter. At halftime Union found themselves down by a score of 7-4, but nonetheless they were confident they could pull out a victory to capture the Cuo. In the second half the Dutch- men came out strongly, both offensively and defensively. In the third quarter, the Dutchmen scored two unanswered goals to pull within one of RPI. However, in the fourth quarter, the entire team pulled together · to outscore RPI 4,.1 for the victory and the Cup in an emotion filled game. The 10-8 win gave Union their second win in a row and upped their record to 6-3. Playing well for the La:s:m.en on offense were Romeo with three goals and two assists, Horn with three goals, and Tony Darin 1 with a goal and an assist.

PageD PARENTS' WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT, May 1986 Guide to Good D •• . 1n1ng. President .:JohnS. Morris Parents: It's Parents' Weekend and we all know what that means. We's . like to call it the \Run for the Restaurants,\ but you can call it whatever you'd like. In light of this quest ·for the perfect: restaurant, we've compiled a short list of some places you might consider when choosing your dining spot. Not necessarily in order ..of preference, here are some ideas: DINNER: Union Welcomes ''U''. Kirkers Steak & Seafood House, 959 Loudon Road (Route 9) in Latham is a traditional American type place to dine. The atmosphere is not terribly elaborate or fancy, however the food is superb. Needless to say, steak is their house specialty, but every dish they serve right down to the vegetable is ex- pertly prepared~ In addition, the portions are more than generous. Kirker's is a no-frills The President Dear Parents: • type restaurant, but it caters to the family crowd. If you are interested in a good hearty meal (that will fill you up until next Parents' Weekend) Kirker's is the place for you. All major credit cards are accepted, reservations are recommended (785..3653 ), and the price range is moderate to expensive. ***% Jack's Oyster 'House located at 42 State Street in Albany serves wtrat -some people woUld argue is the best seafood in the Capital Distri.ct. Its reputation is unmatched in the area and because it has been firmly established in the heart of downtown Albany for over fifty years, it is hardly a well-kept secret. You may taste the best shrimp you've ever tasted, better than many trendy New York restaurants and even some seafood places in Boston. The lobster is also recom- mended, as in the spring >it is brought in fresh daily. The ambiance of Jack's is functional and reminiscent of restaurants from days gone by, with a large one room dining area and a high ceiling. No lavish decor here, as the food truly speaks for itself. Prices range from moderate to expensive and Jack's will honor most major <:!redit cards. Reservations· al'e absolutely necessary on ~ weekend like this. Call 465-8854. **\Jf{* Cranberry ]}og Restaurant, 56 Wolf Road in Colonie is a· great place to dine if you value at- mosphere over I()od.

For you, the parents of Union students, it provides an opportunity to visit the campu~. share to some extent in the college lives of your children and to participate in the events we present to inform you of important aspects of that experience. We hope you will find the weekend in- formative and entertaining. For us, it is an occasion to share in the pride you must take in the accomplishments of your children. The Prize Day ceremony is a wonderful testimony to their talent, energy and concern for the community. Other events during the weekend display their abilities in athletics and the arts. The weekend also enables us to come before you to explain what we do, our educational philosophy and to discuss with you new programs in progress and plans under development. An educational institution that is not constantly examining its ()fferings with the goal of improvement is not worthy of being called a liberal arts college and we invite you to share in these discussions.

... .. .. PARENTS 9 WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT, May 1986 PageC . The Restaurant Guide Continued from page B Cbina ,Pavillion, 256 Wolf Road in Colonie is a restaurant that is new to the area, but is one you might just want to trv. Located nex:t to the Pare V Cafe at the Albany Airport, China Pavillion has the best Chinese food in the Capital District Area. You should surely make reservations if you are going there., though, because China Pavillion .is . the type of place that likes to make you wait for awhile before you .are seated. Then, they can escort you to the bar so that you can spend lots of money on Zombis. However, on~e you are finally seated, you are treated to a potpourri of dishes that will tempt your \. palate. The dining environment are not required but are ap- preciated and recommended on this weekend. {374-2406). ***lh. LUNCH: . best pizza around-Chicago style pan pizza. All the toppings are fresh and every pie is tacked with cheese. Of course, if you're not a pizza fan, you can grab a burger there, too. And tpe cheese cake is fantastic- get a piece if you have the room! They won't take a res~rvation but, if there's a long wa1t, you can place your order when you arrive, sit at the bar · and have a beer (if you're over 21, they proof) while your pizza is being cooked. And, if you go for lunch, be sure to check out . the Ex;press Lunch Special of the day. Don't miss this one pizza hounds. ' *** ¥2 We hope this gives you some good ideas about \places to eat.\ Happy dining! Oh, and remember; when you go, tell 'em Concordy sent you. Happy eating, folks! > .:::i. <II c E rc :::or: > ..... .... Ill ..J > .0 .E 0 s: c. - !S pleasant and the restaurant normally caters to the Albany yuppie crowd. You'll pay a nice price, but the Szechuan-Hunan cuisine is unbeatable. The vegetables, seafood, and beef ar~ all fresh and they are spiced to your liking. They'll honor all major credit cards. Reser- vations are recommended, 869- 4624. Manhat1an Exchange, 605 Union Str~et in Sc~~nectady, is a hop, sk1p. and a Jump away ·from campus. Manhattan Exchange is what is commonly called a ''fern bar.'' It has good atmosphere and is .small.. The greatest assets are the prices (very reasonable) and the hours. You can eat here until 1 :00 a.m., the kitchen stays open later than most restaurants in the area. This is a great place to go when you want . something light. Appetizers include fried mushrooms and fried moz- zarella. And for an entree, you can get a good reuben, a fluffy omelette or creamy chicken salad. For lunch, it's great, but not so great for dinner. They'll take any plastic and you don't need a reservation-just drop in. 374-5930 is the phone. A look back in history - ***% *** Luigi's, 1125 Barrett Street, Schenectady, is a quick walk from the campus and is the Christmas Break home of the Skati.Iig Dutchmen. It boasts a friendly, if not exquisite at- . mosphere and a dining room and bar filled with \regulars.\ Nothing fancy here, but the food is hearty and the portions generous. Stick to the basics and perhaps avoid the Fettucine Alfredo. Prices are reasonable and the service is prompt. Luigi's is a good, casual choice and you don't need a reser- vation. Leave your· plastic at •home, they don't take it. First Parents' Weekend Offers Varied Program Appian Way, 1841 Van Vranken Avenue in Schenec- tady has superb, homemade Italain food. It is, quite simply, the best around. The . pasta is made fresh daily and cooked moments before it arrives on your table. The atmosphere is simple, but hardly noticeable. The Appian Way's only flaw may be its service. It's not terrific. There's a lot of time in between courses, but if ·you have some time this is a great choice. There is a pleasant bar if YO\l have a wait before being seated. A reservation is your best bet, call 370-4030. Prices are very reasonable but credit cards are not accepted. Look for weekly specials and don't miss this one. Reprinted from Concordiensis, Friday., April20, 1951 The Van Dyck Restaurant, located at 237 Union Street, is perhaps the most elegant place 'to dine in Schenectady. The .food is excellent and the atmosphere in the main dining room is pleasant, with a water fountain and jazz . pianist. I House specialities include . filet mignon, lamb chops, and baked Alaska; Located at the edge of Schenectady's famed Stockade, the Van Dyck is Schenectady's version of Manhattan's Four Seasons restaurant. You might want to ask to be seated UJ>' stairs in the Williamsburg _ Room which is a bit more comfortable or the Victorian Room which is finished in a soft antique leitmotif. · Tbe only possible drawback to the Van Dyck is that it seems to cater to Schenectady's senior citizen crowd. The price range is mostly on the expensive end of the scale at this rest.aurant which is very convenient to the campus. All major credit cards are honored and reservations **:Y2 La patisserie II 450 State Street in Schenectady is exactly what the name says plus more. La patisserie, as many of you know, means \the bakery\ en Francais. The pastries are delicious, but that's not all you get. Chicken salad on a croissant, homemade soups and breads-the good food will hook you. The atmosphere, however, is the · restaurant's major downfall; it's too dark in there! But. the food is well worth the strain on your eyes. The prices are moderate and you can get a good lunch for a decent price. They recommend a reservation and will take any major credit card. Call at 346-1940. Bon Appetite! *** Uno Pizzeria and Resta\U'ant at Cr(lssgates Mall in Albany is another new addition to the Capital Di.mrict. You'll find the 7/tis restaurant .guide is a product of the collaborative efforts of Richard D. Allen, Sarah E. Calderini, Carolyn J. Feinstein and Jay M. Grossman.

Prize Day is held annually to honor those who have made distinct academic and extra-curricular contributions to Union College. Before the awards were announced William Burns, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, and President John Morris addressed the students and parents. Bums welcomed them and thanked those students who have given generously and have found Union \very pertinent to their needs into the 80's\. He en- couraged continued in- volvement in Union. President Morris then ex- plained to· everyone why mysterious checks were found in· winner's mailboxes. The checks which were to be given out that day as part of the awards were inadvertently sent out the day before. With a word o·f congratl!lations, Morris called on the festiviti~s t() l;>egin. Dean William Daniels presented . the following awards: · Academy of American Poets Prize-Joy E. Runyon William F. Allen Essay Prize-Lori H.

The articles will focus on campus. · those departments tltat bave Byron Nichols, Associate · experienced problems due to Professor of Political Science, large class size and view them saw an overwhelming number in a natioilal context while alSo of students register for two of accounting .for their popularity the introductory classes in his here at Union. department. There are Several departments -at Union currently a total of about 100 have experienced a recent students in his two sections of increase in enrollment in their PSC-012 and 75 in one section of courses. The sudden shift in PSC-010. Although enrollments popularity was responsible for in political science have been some of the difficulties in course increasing nationwide over the scheduling during the past two past three years, these terms, and in many cases was unusually large classes indicative of both national and prompted the department to Union trends. Professors in the conduct an anonymous survey various fields have ex· of the students. According to Forum Election Campaign Intensifies Nichols, the original hypothesis was that \the number of closed courses steered students to political science.\ Instead, they found that over 70 percent of the class gave \interest in the topic matter or subject of the course\ as their primary r~a.son for registering for the course, over such alternative replies as \to satisfy a category B requirement in Liberal Lear- ning\ and \this course was;still open wheil I wentto pre-regtster and I couldn't get into other courses I would have preferred.\ Nichols noted, \This is an interest which is not likely to wane, so we should expect continued enrollment.\ Some Positions Still Uncontended By DAVID MARIN The race for President of the Student Forum intensified this week as Junior Chip Cannan added his to the list of names running · for the position. Can· nan, who is a brother of Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, says that he is running because of problems he sees IIi the current student governance system. He stated, \I think that the Student Forum is running like a high- school student government,'' commenting that the Administration makes proposals which are passed by the Forum and the Forum has no ability to stop proposals from being pushed through. He adds, \People involved in the Student Forum have become too complacent. They haven't made waves.\ As he sees it, the Forum needs student initiative to stop the overrunning of student con- cerns by the Administration. \I think the Forum is a body that represents students and we don't always have to g!) along (with the Administration). We pay a lot of money to come here, we should have a say.\ Cannan is a mechanical engineering major and also involved with ROTC. Vice-President for Administration Steve Moss this week outlinedhis five-point plan for the Forwn next year. His plan includes: 1) increase communications with the student body by sending representatives to the dorms and possibly holding ~o. me _of the weeldy Forum meetmgs m the dorms; 2) increase com· munication with the Administration through more frequent contact; 3) make student leadership more ef· fective by holding meetings early next year with the new committee members on various Forum appointed coiiimittees; 4) publish a Forum handbook and inform Forwn members of their responsibilities and correct procedural problems early in the year; 5) increase cooperation with Concordiensis in publicizing Forum activity.

Obviously, most students could not recall a listing of the department offerings, but such a poll might prove useful to the pre-registration process if conducted earlier in the term. Students could indicate a general area of interest of their first choices and some alter- nates. The various departments couldthen allocate a number of sections and professors .. more accurately.

By KAREN RUGA It comes as no surprise that tuition has once again been increased at Union. But just · where are these extra funds channeled once they reach the guiding hands of trustees, administrators and faculty col1l1Tlittees alike? Indeed, this iss1,1e is a most important one for all members of our college community in its. affect upon salaries, student activity funds and a whole host of enterprises. The price tag for next year at Union will increase by 7.86 percent from. this academic year. In 1985-86, parents were asked to pay a total of $9,435 to the College for their student- child's education~ This figure covers only the cost of tuition. Next year, an additional $765 will be charged, bringing the price up to · $10,200. An in.,. spection of the rising costs on the wholt;~ reveals that for 1986- . 87 tuition will have been raised 8.1 percent, housing 7.4 percent, and food 6.9 percent. Vice President for Finance and Administration John Hauser explains that the distribution of the extra income from tuition is not easily arrived at since all monies paid to the college are pooled. One example of other sources of income for the College is the endowment itself, which in- creases on average of $3.5-4 million per annum. Dividends from stock market investments are largely responsible {or such increases. However, the recent surge in the stock mar~et over the past six or seven months has 'left Union in a particularly good economic position. Taking into account smaller contributions to the endowment such as the gifts received by friends of the College as well as other sources, stock market investments are the single largest contributor. In all, Union College'.s en· dowment has leaped from $67 . million in June of 1985 to an· astonishing $80 million as of March of 1986. Hauser stressed, however, that the Board of Trustees is well aware that ·'what the stock market gives, the stock market can take away.\ For this very reason, Union has made it a traditional practice to augment the endowment with any ex- traordinary earnings rather than spend it frivolously. As a result, next year's budget in· corporates what the College feels it can safely use of this income without making itself vulnerable to future, and rncst likely inevitable, downswings in the stock market. Other sources of income for Union which, along with the endowment, provide one third of students'tultion costs include its annual fund c~paign drive. This event is one in which almnni are solicited by the College to donate money. Norma11y, the success rate of this particular activity is high, averaging $1.5 to $2 million per year. Still more money is at- tained from tuition itself. With such large amomtts of cash available' at one tin).e, the College is in a position to invest this money and thereby add to it. One more available asset that is applied toward tuition is the State Grant Program which contributes approximately one million dollars each year. This list is not exhaustive, however, and Union gleans support from many otber sources as well. Increases in faculty salary are usuallyin the range of 4.7 to 5 percent annually. This year, perhaps due to the lucrative stoclt market, salaries have increased on an average of 6 percent. According to Hauser, Union '•recognizes a formal merit program\ when raising its faculty's salaries.

I \~~~mrz~ / Professor Byron Nichols speaks of increased enrollments in Political Science at Union and elsewhere. Political Science Enrollments Follow National Trend By DAVID GULLIVER Editor's Note: This is the first article in a series which will examine enrollment shifts at Union. The articles will focus on those departments that have experienced problems due to large class size and view them in a national context while also accounting for their popularity here at Union. Several departments at Union have experienced a recent increase in enrollment in their courses. The sudden shift in popularity was responsible for some of the difficulties in course scheduling during the past two terms, and in many cases was indicative of both national and Union trends. Professors in the various fields have ex- planations of these tendencies and offer possible solutions to the class size problems on campus. Forum Election Campaign Intensifies Byron Nichols, Associate Professor of Political Science, saw an overwhelming number of students register for two of the introductory classes in his department. There are currently a total of about 100 students in his two sections of PSC-012 and 75 in one section of PSC-010. Although enrollments in political science have been increasing nationwide over the past three years, these unusually large classes prompted the department to conduct an anonymous survey of the students. According to Nichols, the original hypothesis was that \the number of closed courses steered students to political science.\ Instead, they found that over 70 percent of the class gave \interest in the topic matter or subject of the course\ as their primary reason for registering for the course, over such alternative replies as \to satisfy a category B requirement in Liberal Lear- nmg\ and \this course was still open wheil I went to pre-register and I couldn't get into other courses I would have preferred.\ Nichols noted, \This is an interest which is not likely to wane, so we should expect continued enrollment.\ Some Positions Still Uncontended By DAVID MARIN The race for President of the Student Forum intensified this week as Junior Chip Cannan added his to the list of names running for the position. Can- nan, who is a l>rother of Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, says that he is running because of problems he sees in the current student governance system. He stated, \I think that the Student Forum is running like a high- school student government,\ commenting that the Administration makes proposals whicll are passed by the Forum and the Forum has no ability to sto}l :proposals from being pushed through. He adds, \People involvEd in the Student Forum have become too complacent. They haven't made waves.\ As he sees it, the Forum needs student initiative to stop the overrunning cf student con- cerns by the Administration. ''I think the Forwn is a body that represents students and we don't always bave to go along (with the Administration).

Vice-President for Administration Steve Moss this week outlined his five-point plan for the Forum next year. His plan includes: 1) increase communications with the student body by sending representatives to the dorms and possibly holding some of the weekly Forwn meetings in the dorms; 2) increase com· munication with the Administration through more frequent contact; 3) make student leadership more ef- fective by holding meetings early next year with the new committee members on various Forum appointed committees; 4) publish a Forwn handbook and inform Forum members of their responsibilities and correct procedural problems early in the year; 5) increase cooperation with Concordiensis in publicizing Forum activity.

Moss is a mechanical engineering major. Kyle Siegel thiS week com- mented on the performance of the Forum by saying, ''If we look back to the past there really was no performance.\ Except for some minor con- · tributions that make the Forum a \service organization\ ac• cording to Siegel, nothing much has been done. · Siegel is currently Junior Representative to the Student Forum, a member of the Student Affairs Council and a brother of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity. He added, \I'd like to see the Forwn upgrade its position with respect to the origmal intent of those who conceived it as an institution of student govern- ment. It isn't doing a very good job of governing at the present. This is apparent by the amount of student \discontent.\ Siegel sees the presidency as a position of persuasion and feels that the president should be an \ambassador from the Administration to further persuade them to adhere to the wishes of the students and not their own manipulative policies.\ Kelly Larkin also sees some problems in the way the Forum is run now. After reading through the entire Student Forum Constitution, she sees that there is much more that can be done than is being done now through the student governance system. Larkin says, \(The Student Forwn) just doesn't have the en- thusiasm that makes students want to get involved.\ She feels that \students on campus don't look favorably on the Forwn. They think that the Forum doesn't do anything.\ Larkin indicated that she thinks an \effective Student Forwn can promote a positive . complish more .through positive interaction with the Administration. Among ber ideas for projects for the Forum, she would like to see Girling Center renovated so that the clubhouse there could . be used for banquets and other . functions and save mQney for many College organizations that now rent oot halls. Larkin is currently Cha!rman of the Orientation Committee, Panbellenic Vic~President for Programming and a student member of the Adminissions Advisory .Committee. She is a mechanical engiileering major and recently became a s~er of Gamma Phi Beta sorority. · The vice-presidential race is . · now entertaining two can- didates: steve Lipsky and Ted Eveleth. Lipsky, who is currently a Junior Represen- . tative to the Forwn points to his · experience on the Finance Committee. \I will be the only returning member of the Forum with knowledge of the internal . working of the Finance Com- mittee. People who know me will vouch for my past desire for fiscal regulation and security when it comes to our Student Activities money.\ . . Lipsky feels that there has been a lack of communication between. the Finance Com- mittee representatives and the clubs. He sees many of the decisions being made too fast and routinely. He says, \I'd like to take out some of the routine and stress and create cooperation between the Finance Committee and the clubs.\ Te-d Eveleth, also running for the position, says that \student activities are more important now without alcohol\ and would like to see some changes made in the way the Finance Com- mittee operates. At present, he sees \too many hindrances to operating'' clubs effectively. For example, he would like to see the seventh week Com- mittee on Committees (CoC) report and the ninth week finance report combined. According to Eveleth, people are too woiTied about clubs spending money when they are A contest has arisen in the race for Vice-President for Forum. The two candidates are Susan Neumann and Jason Green .. Neumann elq)lained her objectives for the position: \I think that better lines of communication between the Committee on Committees and the various student activities is vital. it seems as · though, presently, communication is at a minimal level. Only when club constitutions have elq)ired or status reports are due does communication exist. \Not only .is it necessary to make sure that all committees are r:-unning smoothly, if there is· a problem, clubs should solicit help from the CoC. Conversely; if the CoC has suggestions then these should be related to the clubs. Both groups should be able . to work together more closely than at present.\ Jason Green commented in a statement prepared for Con- cordiensis, \Union is· a place where if we paid a little at- tention to the details we could mak~ a world of difference. As a small community we can work to improve life on campus, before these issues become claims and grievances. Were there no problems on our campus, there would be little need for the Student Forum; yet the need remains. Solutions can come about only if there are people who are willing to speak, and willing to work hard to be heard.\ Green is currently in Washington, D.C. on the Washington Program spon- sored by the political · science Department.

In addition, \special\ salary adjustments are made to those professors who would otherwise be \bought up\ elsewhere in the market place, particularly by other private colleges who seek renowned, prestigious faculty members themselves. Hauser denied the contention . that Union raises its tuition each year primarily to secure its lofty status with other schools and maintain a high standing among its com- petitors. Instead, he proposed that Union would in fact cut tuition in half if it could do so and still cover all its expenses. Union College Speakers Forum presents Steven Wright Saturday, May 31st 9:00p.m ..

They think that the Forum doesn't do anything.\ Larkin indicated that she thinks an ''effective Student Forwn can promote a positive Among her ideas for projects for the Forum, she would like to · see Girting Center renovated so that the clubhouse there could be used for banquets and other functions and save money for many College organizations that now rent out halls. Larkin is currently Chairman of the Orientation Committee, Panhellenic Vice-President for Programming and a student member of the Adminissions Advisory Committee. She is a mechaaical engineering major and recently became a sister of Gamma Phi Beta sorority. The vice-presidentiai race is · now entertaining two can- didates: Steve Lipsky and Ted Eveleth. Lipsky, who is currently a J.unior Represen- tative to the Forum points to his experience on the Finance Committee. ''I will be the only returning member of the Forum with knowledge of the internal working of the Finance Com- mittee. People who know me will vouch for my past desire for fiscal regulation and security when. it comes to our Student Activities money.'' Lipsky feels that there has been a lack of communicati()n between the Finance Com- mittee representatives and the clubs. He sees many of the decisions being made too fast and routinely. He says, \I'd like to take out some of the routine and stress and create cooperation between the Finance Committee and the clubs.\ Ted Eveleth, also running for the position, says that \student activities are more important now without alcohol\ and woald like to see some changes made in the way the Finance Com- mittee operates. At present, he sees \too many hindrances to operating\ clubs effectively. For example, he would like to see the seventh week Com- mittee on Committees ( CoC) report and the ninth week finance report combined. According to Eveleth, people are too worried about clubs spending money when they are A contest has arisen in the race for Vice-President for Forum. The two candidates are Susan Neumann and Jason Green. N ewnann explained her objectives. for the position: \I think that better lines of communication between the Committee on Committees and the various student activities is vital. It seems as though, presently, communication is at a minimal level. Only when club constitutions have expired or status reports are due does commllillication exist. \Not cmly is it necessary to make sure that all conunittees are rllilning smoothly, if there is a problem, clubs should solicit help from the CoC. Conversely, if the CGC has suggestions then these s:hould be related to the clubs. Both groups should be able to work tegether more closely than at present.'' Jason Green commented in a statement prepared for Con- cordlemsis, \Union is a place where if we paid a little at- tention to the details we could make a world of difference. As a small cGmmunity we can work to imJJrove life on campus, before these issues become claims and grievances. Were there no problems on our campus, there would be little need fortheStudent Forum; yet the need remains. Solutions can come about only if there are people 'Who are willing to speak, and willing to work hard to be heard.'' Green is currently in Washington, D.C. on the Washington Program spon- sored by the political science Department.

Hauser denied the contention that Union raises its tuition each year primarily to secur-a its lofty status with other schools and maintajn a high standing among its com- petitors. Instead, he proposed that Union would in fact cut tuition in half if it could do so and still cover all its expenses.

Nevertheless, in considering the number at which to set tution, one must remember that prestige does not come without a price tag.

Thus, the Third Reich arose and the Fury was unleashed. The results are history. Many people, mostly six million Jews, were murdered in the Nazi , Death Camps. Try visualizing six mil-lion. When yon look up at the night time sky, there are. less than a million stars visible to. the naked eye. Mrs. Ball related the story of one ofthose stars, her friend, Helen Stock· man. Helen told Mrs. Ball about -her best friend · Basha, a · Christian who lived with Helen in a small village in Poland. Basha and Helen were ex- tremely close; they shared secrets, did things behind their patents' backs and went \scoping\ the boys together. Then the Nazis came to Poland, murdered the Rabbi and sent the Stocktnans. to a Jewish ghetto for internment. Helen missed Basha terribly, and on Basha's birthday decided to take an e:x- . traordinary risk and give Baslla a special present~ Helen sneaked out of the .ghetto and ran down the street to the nearest open store; a bakery. She begged the baker to all()W her to use the ph<Jne. As luck would have it, he gave her- permission. She dialed, and as luck would have it again, Basha answered. Then Basha told Helen that she was outraged that some dirty Jew would dare call her-and promptly bUilg ap. That is one aspect of the Holocaust, the death of a friendship. Unfortunately, fifty years ago, a lot of moral guards were . down, in Germany, Austria and · · elsewhere. Mrs. Ball• gave a brief . description .of the era following World War One. Tile Axis powers had to pay an excessive bill to the Allies, the industrial · base of · No:rtllern Germany was smoking r1lins; inflation was in the triple digits, and the Weimar Republic was crumbling. These people needed help and hope, and they found it in a nobody politician from Austria-Adolf Hitler. Ask yourself, \How could the Germans blindly follow ~ lunatic like Hitler?\ According to Mrs. Ball, most didn't at fir~. However, these were miserable people, and Hitler did something magical. He made them feel good. He made promises: \I'll give you jobs! I'll give you industry! I'll. give you. pride in being a German with.an empire· which wUI:111.s.t a thousand years!\ Not a bad deal; yet there was a catch. The nation needed to be \cleansed\ of the Jews, Gypsies, R<Jman Catholic Church, criminals, and homosexuals which \infected\ it. Most people thought that these were simply the ram- blings of someone who was carried away with his own ideas. Most figured the bureaucracy. of government · would take care of the radicalism. Most were wrong. Hitler did something no one counted on, he kept his .platfc:>rm promises. In a few years, . he formed a strong government, a healthy industrial base, and there were plenty of jobs. The Germans now began to seriously consider his words. 'If the Fuhrer can do an this, he must know what he's talking about. The Jews contr()l the Yes, there were worse ~hings.

Here in New York, President Roosevelt was finally persuaded to allow a thousand Jews to live at Fort Ontario in Oswego, provided that they were 'useful' or 'skilled'. Mrs. Ball called such meager action by the government \token\. The people of Oswego, however, were more positive. They brought the refugees fresh food, tools, anct other items.

Page3 Professor Sharlet questions Potts' \generation-cycle theory\ of political activism.. Various Theories Explain Interest in Political Science Continued from page 1 time, including the Libyan conflict and the conflict over aid to the contras in Nicaragua,have captured .public attention and spurred interest in politics. Likewise, awareness that politics affects our everyday lives, such as in tax reform or student financial aid cutbacks, draws interest. In a material sense, Nichols adds, students may want to develop an in- ternati-onal background knowledge for possible em- ployment with a multinational firm. Finally, students retur- ning from terms abroad have more interest in world affairs that manifests itself in political science. Nichols also related a fascinating theory presently being researched. by Dr. David Potts of Gettysburg University, a former history professor at Union, who is currently on leave (from Gettysburg) at the . Davidson Center at Wesleyan. He is examining generational cycles in American political interest. A study by Joseph Katz of Stanford in the early '70s showed that the parents of political activists in the '60s had been activists in the Depression era. Potts is examining whether the children of the '60s activists, who are now of college age, are also politically active. He is studying political science enrolbnents across the country as a part of his research. In the Union PSC-010 course, 40 percent of the students' parents were graduated from college in the years 1960..1970, a period generally regarded as the most liberal and active on campuses. However, 38 percent were from 1950-1960. The statistics reflected a normal bell curve distribution, but Nichols said that formerly, ahhough there are no earlier polls, that he would expect 70 percent of the parents' graduations to be in the '50s, the \gray flannel\ period of con- servatism. That time is reflected in the career-oriented conservative youth today. Associate Professor of Political Science Robert Sharlet has both reinforcement and criticism of that theory. Political activism began in the late 1950's in the South, but, he said; at that time the ac- tivism was contained there and not a national focus until Martin Luther King's marches and President Kennedy's backing of the civil rights cause. At that point, the free speech movement at )3erkeley began and was followed by Vietnam protests which spread nationwide. Watergate com- pleted the era of public unrest. Therefore, Sharlet claims, we may be just beginning to see a generation of children whose parents were alienated by government. Sharlet also stresses that there are several factors which could distort the cycle. The family attitudes, though the first and foremost political influences, can be reformed by later experience. Secondly, the political unrest was not everywhere: the South, lower Midwest, and Rocky Mountain States were bastions of con- servatism throughout the 1960's. Many of today' s college students and their parents are from those areas. Those areas and students from them are likely to remain conservative. In addition, not all of today's students' parents attended college and were not directly influenced by campus ac· tivities. In any case, he adds, this is only the beginning of the cycle if it exists at all. .. \ \ ' \ ., ~ 'I' • ... t, .. .. ~ • .. • ;,; ~ ;( ...

In 1974, the plant; which is the largest employer in the Schenectady area, employed over 29,000 workers. After recent layoffs, GE h'as dropped the number of its employees here to 15,200. With the lower demand for turbines and the· increasing foreign competition, one has to wonder what GE's future in Schenectady will be like. Moreover, this has created increasing une:tp.ployment problems for Schenectady's blue-collar workers. The growth of the city has been simultaneous with the growth of the plant. Many local officials have corrnnented that the city must 'look to outside enterprises and corpor~tions to alleviate the problems that Schenectady is facing. El!:cept for the GE Research and Develpment Center, which has existed for over 85 years and is dedicated to the creation of new · products and services, the future· of GE in Schenectady does not ·appear to be strong, and is ·n()t one that the city of Schenectady can rely on.

' CONCORDIENSIS, May 15; 1986 Page7 FEATURES North Country: Poems of the Past ByCATHYMARKES As a native Sy;pacusan, I llave alway-s held upstate New York cl()se to my heart- .. tllUs I decided to write a book review on North Country, an antl!ology of writings from the Adirondack area. Once I bad read a few poems in this collection, I realized that in fact 1 was reaching into my past, )lulling out childhood memories I had cast aside for so long. He!!e was to()k place in a somewhat remote setting-whether it was a small town or an Adirondack forest, they all shared a degree of intimacy. The language was~ ve;ry conversattonal and quite similar to talks I've had with friends or family. As these elements intertwined to fonn a story, they clearly conveyed the feeling of \home\. These writers wrote of the simple things tbat always in. trigued me as a child~o£ af- spoken? I honemly hope not beCJause I think of all thos~ times I discovered comfort in a dirn forest, or quiet along a lake shore, and would wish for them to find the same. North Country provided a refreshing insight into my days spent here in upstate NY. Fifty writers' works are included in tbis anthology, most of whom reside Within a sixty-mile radius of Schenectady.

I wonder if my children will be amused by these same trivial matters.

By MELISSA MALKIN The Delta Gamma Olympics · ~open$ with a woman w-earing a toga, foliage in her hair, and carrying a torch. From there it gets progressively better. The events are unannounced until the day of the event because, as chainnan Cathy Markes ex- plained, \It's not like anyone's going to go practice their jello- eating, but it's must more fun if it's a surprise.\ Jello-eatlng, of the spoonless variety, is going to be one event that we know in advance. Infonned sources say thatthis year's events are going to be \very creative\. Betsy Boutwell will be M.C.ing the Olympics In her inimitable way, and WRUC D.J.s will be on hand to play theme songs for each team as well as inspirational music to cheer on competitors during the games. How it works: Each team consists of five guys and five girls who will be assigned a DG sister as a captain. teams pay $4 per person for tee-shirts, and sell raffle tickets for the raffle held the day of the Olympics (May 23 at 2 p.m. on Library Field). For example, the annual migration of geese is simply an accepted ritual to me. I will always remember running outside on a brisk morning at the muffled sounds of honking, staring up at the dotted sky. And someone always pointing out how they fly!n a V. Several writers in North Cowtry wrote of the geese migrations, reminding me of tllis unique_ phenomena in the northeastern Circle K Raffle u.s. . Many poems reflected lazy autmnn days filled with colorful warmth and the crunch of dry leaves. Some depicted oh-so- accurately the last icy days of winter that suddenly emerge in the month of April. ~ et others revealed the inner .beauty of spring as ths season of new life, green leaves and rushing .streams. The seasons are so harshly distinct here. Rather than a slow blending of the new with the old, we all kn:ow that a day in upstate NY c<1n go from 32 to 70 degrees, or from per- fectly calm to having gale force winds blow about us. The short stories told of family relationships, of youth ' and the joy of discovering. Characters portrayed the day- to-day hardships of life in realistic settings. Almost all On Saturday, May 10, Union College C lrcle K held a 50150 raffle. Over 600 tickets were sold. The winning ticket was drawn at 11:30 p.m. Saturday evening, at the Ramada Inn Parents' Weekend Dance. Kirsten Valt, a Union Fresh:manr was the winner of $130, with ticket number: 1243249 Circle K wishes to express its thanks to all those parents, students.~ and faculty who participated. Funds raised will allow Circle K to continue helping others with- such projects as camping with the Schenectady Boys' Club, skiing with the Boys' Club, 1 nursing hnme visitations, donations, and campus/community service. Everyone is encouraged t() create teams; call Cathy - Markes at X6823 to register. Teams with sharp names and theme songs are especially encouraged, as these lend themselves to team banners. The team banner competition is held the Thursday before ffie Olympics; winners get points towards their totals the next day. Points are also awarded te> the team selling the most raffle tickets. The three winning teams get team prizes; in past years these have been pizza or ice cream parties. In addition, tlrls year, Delta Gamma will host a barbeque for the gold, silver and bronze medal teams ()n Saturday, May 24. The raffle prizes are drawn at the Olympics. Last year the raffle prizes included dinner at Manhattan Exchange, a cellophane, haircut and ,manicure at Hllir Statement, a tennis racket, a $75 watch, and a can opener.

Page 8 CONCORIJIENSJS, May 15, 1986 Fotlllfkd Qt (Inion Colleg-e 1877 ------------ ----~ Staff Appreciation Day Despite that this past weekend we took the time to celebrate Mother's Day, it might be a good idea to take some time out to honor those who are proud to take care of some of the things that make a college run smoot:Qly. Thus, Concordiensis would like to call today Staff Appreciation Day, in honor of many of the dedicated people that are behind the scenes, but in their own ways, help to make the college what it is. How many times have you gone into the pub {Hale House) and have been greeted with a smile from. the ady behind the counter? How many times have you ;one into the bookstore and have had the cashier make your day a little happier? How many times has one of the department secretaries eagerly passed a message on to your professor? It is instances like these and many others that make our experience at Union an easier one to cope with. All too often, it seems as if students and even faculty members fail to remember that we should show all of the people in our community the .same cordiality and respect that they show us. It is not seldom the case that a student makes a snide remark to one of our security officers or throws trash ,to the same spot that one of the maids in the dorms just spent hours to clean. . So today, take a little time out to thank them for the outstanding job that they have done this year and try to show them the cordiality that they show you! Preregistration Preregistration is upon us-finally in the eighth week of the term. At this time, Concordiensis would like to propose an alternative to eighth-week preregistration: third-week preregistration. If students were to register for courses that they think they will be taking the next tenn, it would solve a lot of problems that exist at the present time. Many people have claimed that the third week of the term is .simply too early. Students cannot be asked to decide that far in advance what courses they would like to take. But, then again, no one would be asking students to register in stone. And under tbe present system, students would still be allowed to change their minds. Third-week preregistration is a very logical corollary to the newly implemented requirement of an advisor's signature. As long as students are going to be sitting down with their advisors, why not do it earlier? The reasons that the College should try this new idea are as follows: First, most immediately, we (the College) could be better prepared to handle shifts in departmental demands. So many times, the problems of overcrowded classes is answered with a \How were we to know that so many students would want to start taking economics courses?\ Well, third-week preregistration would help to eliminate the necessity of these excuses. The need for adjunct professors in a specific area could be more easily predictable. If two times as many students preregister for EC0-10, then the department can handle, maybe the College ought · to hire someone for the next tenn. In addition to the immediate benefits, long term benefits also exist. In general, third-week preregistration would allow the College to get a bit of a head start in its study of academic trends. With an earlier preregistration, the college could be better equipped to cover anticipated shifts in interest. Also, for national surveys of education, the extra five weeks that we would have under this new system would enable the college to be more \on top of things.\ All in all, nobody can really lose out on this deal. Students will become better organized at an earlier time, which won't kill any of us. But, we will still have the flexibility to change our minds. And, we hope, the College will believe that is a good way to solve some of their problems as well. . LETTERS Registrar's Office Needs I~provement To the Editors: Well, her-e it is, the 15th of May and it is my understanding that the final exam schedule should be published in today's issue of Ccmcordy. Seeing that exams are to be finished on the 11th of JUn.~ I would have to say that it is about time that the registrar'·:;; office made them available! I sincerEly believe that the administration of this college has taken great strides in correcting some of the problemsthat have existed here at Union for some time. Now it is time to tackle another problem area-the registrar's office. Tbe subject of the ·lateness of final exam scheduling was addressed just last term, but it seems that the issue has be.en forgotten ~,ust two months later. · Anyone who travels on the airUnes knows that there are special rates :for customers who make reservations 30 days in advance. A;lso, most airlines have reduced rates for thQse who tr~vel on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. 'But since today is May 15th, it ls too late to take advantage cd those rates. I stopped by the mgistrar's office on the 9th of this month to see if l could find out what my schedule might be, but was instead told (very coldly,. I might add), that I would not find out until the 15th, and that I should. just i>()ok my· flight for Thursday, the 12th of June. It may come as a surprise, but students at many large universities, some with over 12,000 students, already kn9w their exam schedules .for Dec. 1986. The registrar at these schools mu.st be accompl~hing miracles if he can schedule 800 exams that far in advance, because we can't schedule 200 until three weeks before they .are to be taken. Once again, I am very happy here at Union, the school is really very responsive to the needs of its students: it lias straightened out many, many problems in the past. I hope the administration will help to straighten out this problem, too. Thomas Campbell Class of '88 Facts and Realistic Proposals Needed To the Editor: My compliments to David Marin for a well-researched article Oil where the ten new faculty pllsitions will go. I am writing this letter to react to some of the issues raised there, and to suggest some steps for clarifying the debate. The Marin article presented a lot of nwn.bers. Three cheersJ I might q11arrel with the in- terpretation given to some of them, but at least we're moving in the direction of a factually- grounded. debate. The Adniinistl\ation of the College could perf()rm.a great service in this area: compile and disseminate an authoritative body of information, to inform . · our policy discussion. Majors per · department, FTE enrollments per faculty, average class size: what are the Letters to ·the · editor and . . . commentaries do no1 necessarily reflect the opinions of the editorial t.oard of Concordiensis All letters to the Editor m11st be typed double-.spaced and submittect by 4 p.m. each Tuesday before publication. All letters must be signed by no more than four people and all writers should provide their addresses and phone numbers for verifica1ion of the leHer. IUimes normally will not be withheld. Concordiensis reserves the right to reiect leHers that are libelous Gr do not confotltl to standards of good fclste. facts? What about comparable institutions 7 In & memo one year ago, Ee(Jnomics presented our own limited understanding of these facts, and asked AAC to present their own information. If the facts have been compiled, they should 1>E published. If they have not beeneompiled, I doi)ot see how policy decisions can go forward. The Marin article also reflected the ongoing debate over \what an educated Union graduate shollld know ... \.Prof. Warde worries that unless he and others ~ exercise \educational leadership\ Union will become a ''trade school\. GQd forbid! (But remember, Andy: people over in this buildin,g have also read Plato. I learned five languages in my time, including Latin. Don't assume that anything offer-ed outside the \lettered departm.ents\ is preprofessional.} I heartily agree that tile College must intervene, very strongly and · very actively, to dampen our students' enthusiasm for 'preprofessiMial' courses. But there seems to be some presumption that hiring new faculty in the humanities will accomplish this. For an ad- ministration which is concerned Advertising Ed:·t tors Assoc,Ad~'< Bditor r·' .··. &ports & Editor'· with maintaining flexibility, it seems to me foolhardy to commit more tenure-track positions, in an already under- utilized part of our staff, until two questions are answered. (1) What pressures and con- straints will actually force students to take these courses? (2) Can ex:isting faculty staff some of the new courses? (Why,- for example, would we require another Medievalist, as suggested by Prof. Zwicker, when Prof. Sargent is an authority in that field? Why can't present faculty work tip courses in \literature in translation\ given a semester or two of leave time?) It seems to me that my \lettered\ colleagues~ · grtJ$sly un- · derestimate the propensity of our students to continue majoring in economics and computer science no matter who we hire. 'In sum: I hope that in the coming year, AAC and the Administration will give us · more facts~ and more realistic proposals for .curricular reform, than we've seen thus far.

It is not seldom the case that a student makes a snide remark to one of our security officers or throws trash to the same spot that one of the maids in the dorms just spent hours to clean. So today, take a little time out to thank them for the outstanding job that they have done this year and try to show them the cordiality that they show you! Preregistration Preregistration is upon us-finally in the eighth week of the term. At this time, Concordiensis would like to propose an alternative to eighth-week preregistration: third-week preregistration. If students were to register for courses that they think they will be taking the next term, it would solve a lot of problems that exist at the present time. Many people have claimed that the third week of the term is simply too early. Students cannot be asked to decide that far in advance what courses they would like to take. But, then again, no one would be asking students to register in stone. And under the present system, students would still be allowed to change their minds. Third-week preregistration is a very logical corollary to the newly implemented requirement of an advisor's signature. As long as students are going to be sitting down with their advisors, why not do it earlier? The reasons that the College should try this new idea are as follows: First, most immediately, we (the College) could be better prepared to handle shifts in departmental demands. So many times, the problems of overcrowded classes is answered with a \How were we to know that so many students would want to start taking economics courses?\ Well, third-week preregistration would help to eliminate the necessity of these excuses. The need for adjunct professors in a specific area could be more easily predictable. If two times as many students preregister for EC0-10, then the department can handle, maybe the College ought · to hire someone for the next term. In addition to the immediate benefits, long term benefits also exist. In general, third-week preregistration would allow the College to get a bit of a head start in its study of academic trends. With an earlier preregistration, the college could be better equipped to cover anticipated shifts in interest. Also, for national surveys of education, the extra five weeks that we would have under this new system would enable the college to be more \on top of things.'' All in all, nobody can really lose out on this deal. Students will become better organized at an earlier time, which won't kill any of us. But, we will still have the flexibility to change our minds. And, we hope, the College will believe that is a good way to solve some of their problems as well. LETTERS Registrar's Office Needs Improvement To the Editors: Well, here it is, the 15th of May and it is my understanding that the final exam schedule should be published in today's issue of Concordy. Seeing that exams are to be finished on the 11th of Jm1e, I would have to say that it is about time that the registrar's office made them availabie! I sincerely believe that the administration of this college has taken great strides in correcting some of the problems that have existed here at Union for some time. Now it is time to tack1e another problem area-the registrar's office. The subject of the lateness of final exam scheduling was addressed just last term, but it seems that the issue has been forgotten just two months later. Anyone who travels on the airlines knows that there are special rates for customers who make reservations 30 days in advance. Also, most airlines have reduced rates for those who travel on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. But since today is May 15th, it is too late to take advantage of those rates. I stopped by the registrar's office on the 9th of this month to see if I could filld out what my schedule might be, but was instead told (very coldly, I might add), that I would not find out m1til the 15th, and that I should just book my flight for Thursday, the 12th of June. It may come as a surprise, but students at many large universities, some with over 12,000 students, already know their exam schedules for Dec. 1986. The registrar at these schools must be accomplishing miracles if he can schedule 800 exams that far in advance, because we can't schedule 200 until three weeks before they are to be taken. Once again, I am very happy here at Union, the school is really very responsive to U1e needs of its students: it has straightened out many, many problems in the past. I hope the administration will help to straighten out this problem, too. Thomas Campbell Class of '88 Facts and Realistic Proposals Needed To the Editor: My compliments to David Marin for a well-researched article on where the ten new faculty positions will go. I am writing this letter to react to some of the issues raised there, and to suggest some steps for clarifying the debate. The Marin article presented a lot of numbers. Three cheers.! I might quarrel with the in- terpretation given to some of them, but at least we're moving in the direction of a factually- grounded debate. The Administration of the College could perform a great service in this area: compile and disseminate an authoritative body of information, to inform our policy discussion. Majors per department, FTE enrollments per faculty, average class size: what are the Letters to the editor and commentaries do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the editorial board of Concordiensis All Letters to the Editor must be typed doubleaspaced and submitted by 4 p.m. each Tuesday before publication. AU letters must be signed by no more than four people and all writers should provide their addresses and phone numbers for verification of the letter. Names normally will not be withheld. Concordiensis reserves the right to reiect letters that are libelous or do not conform to standards of good taste. facts? What about comparable institutions? In a memo one year ago, Economics presented our own limited W1derstanding of these facts, and asked AAC to present their own information. If the facts have been compiled, they should be published. If they have not been compiled, I do not see how policy decisions can go forward. The Marin article also reflected the ongoing debate over \what an educated Union graduate should know ... \. Prof. Warde worries that unless he and others exercise ''educational leadership'', Union will become a \trade school\. God forbid! (But remember, Andy: people over in this building have also read Plato. I learned five languages in my time, including Latin. Don't assume that anything offered outside the \lettered departments\ is preprofessional.) I heartily agree that the College must intervene, very strongly and very actively, to dampen our students' enthusiasm for 'preprofessional' courses. But there seems to be some presumption that hiring new faculty in the humanities will accomplish this. For an ad- ministration which is concerned with maintaining flexibility, it seems to me f0olhardy to commit more tenure-track positions, in an already under- utilized part of our staff, until two questions are answered. (1) What pressures and con- straints will actually force students to take these courses? (2) Can existing faculty staff some of the new courses? (Why, for example, would we require another Medievalist, as suggested by Prof. Zwicker, when Prof. Sargent is an authority in that field? Why can't present faculty work up courses in \literature in translation\ given a semester or two of leave time?) It seems to me that my \lettered'' colleagues grossly un- derestimate the propensity of our students to continue majoring in economics and computer science no matter who we hire. In sum: I hope that in the coming year, AAC and the Administration will give us more facts, and more realistic proposals for curricular reform, than we've seen thus far. Until then, I remain un- convinced. Bruce L. Reynolds, Economics Editors--in..Chlef Sarah Calderini.

COMMENtARIES' Make Improvements Permanent By DAVID MARIN Three times each year-- namely Homecoming, Parents' Weekend, and Graduation-- students seem to develop a silly attitude in which they criticize the College for putting so much effort into fixing up the campus specifically for those events. These students then proceed to fix up their rooms nice and neat for their parents and take special efforts to be sure that everything is top-notch for their parents' arrival. The College engages in its own silliness. Rather than actually fix up the campus for these special weekends, reasonable and justifiable activity, they choose instead to make it seem as if it is fixed up. An example from this past weekend is the green stuff they threw on the bare dirt spots. Was this a magical fertilizer expected to cultivate grass in two days or was it supposed to fool us into thinking it was really grass? After all, . the casual observer often has trouble distinguishing between green and grass. And why was the President's Reception held at Library Plaza instead of Jackson's Gardens? One source indicated that it was because there were not enough flowers in the Gardens this year. Then we must ask two questions - why weren't the flowers planted, and is a reception in the blazing sun amongst brick buildings really preferable to one amongst the trees and bushes in the Gar- dens, with or without flowers? From time to time :we see individuals carefully turning over soil, we assume, in preparation for planting grass seed in the bare .spots around campus. This is invariably not the case, however. After the soil is fumed over, it is generally left to become packed and dry again. On rare occasions when grass seed is laid down, Physical Plant seems to forget two essentials: protection and water. No fences are erected to keep people from traveling over seeded areas, and the College seems to be eternally baffled by grass seed that does not grow without water. Perhaps the biology department could be of assistance in explaining this phenomenon. I would be the last to condemn the College for attempting to beautify the campus for special weekends. After all, why should I want the campus to look bad for my parents? And since the campus must be periodically cleaned up anyway, it seems wise to do so at such times. What I do .find contemptible, though, is that last-minute feeble .efforts are made which do not contribute to any long term improvements. And furthermore, ineptitude in the reparation of the grounds seems widespread. Instead of green mud placed two days before the arrival of visitors, let's try grass seed four weeks before (and water). If we're to put flowers in, let's make them permanent and do it on time. Students cleaning up for their parents have two choices. They can throw everything under the bed or they can put things in their place, using the occasion as an opportunity to get done some necessary fixing up. The College has the same two choices - green mud or green grass. TRI DELTA'S SMOKE OUT!

Page 12 CQNCORDIENSIS, Mt~y 15, 1986 'THE ARTS Union,aires Debut By KIMBERLY HANCOCK Th~ Unionaires, a twenty- member singing group, held their debut performance at the Union College Staff Association spring luncheon last Wed- nesday. Comprised of staff and faculty members, the Unionaires was forn,ted at the beginning of Spring term and has only been practicing once a week since that time. Although this weekly one-'hour practice does not sound like enough time to prepare a repertoire, their performance was one of high quality. Under the skillful direction of Marguerite Potchne,y (who works in the Graduate and Continuing Studies) the Unionaires performed five very diverse songs, the first of which was \Oh What a Beautiful Morning.\ The women's voices enhanced the beauty of the song-the men had a small almost solo verse and then the two blended melodiously in the chorus. Rousing applause greeted the closing notes of the song demonstrating the crowd's anticipation for more fine music. The second song, \Amazing Grace\ rang sweetly through Hale House. The pianist for the performance, Sharon Perkins of Central Scheduling, was superb. For their third number, the Unionaires picked up the pace and sang the well known \The Sun'll Come Out Tomorrow'' from Broadway's AnDie. As a demonstration of their diverse ability, the Unionaires performed an upoeat \Pick a Little, Talk a Little and Goodnight Ladies.\ This song was essentially done in three parts which were all sung at once. The pace was quick providing a large opportunity for mistakes-but there were none. Each part was exact, on time, and delivered with careful distinction yet did not over- power the others. Subtleties such as this exemplified the talent of both the singers and director. _ The performance closed with a beautiful rendition of \Let There be Peace on Earth\ and the UnioJiaires were met with a wave of applause. Their concert was enjoyed by all members of the audience but more than that, as Director of Student Activities, Lorraine Marra revealed, \We all have such a good time singing as the Unionaires.\ This was evident as the singers left the platform smiling with the knowledge that they had fully enjoyed this successful debut performance. The Unionaires want to ex- tend an invitation to all campus • community members who wish to join, they are especially seeking more male vocalists to enhance their overall sound. Their next rehearsal is May 21 at noon in Memorial Chapel. Although they have no im- mediate plans, the Unionaires are continuing to practice and I would strongly recommend anyone looking for a talented .performing group to consider the Unionaires. In Review . .. Adam and Eve By MICKEY BRADLEY Mountebanks added its share to the Parents' Weekend festivities with its presentation of \A Night of Comedy,\· featuring two one-act plays: The Apple Tree and The American Dream. The shows were sellouts and deserved to be--both offered good per- formances, interesting plots, and unique comedy. '11le Apple Tree, a multi- credited adaption of a Mark Twain . story, was a musical, nonbiblical version of the story of Adam and Eve, with the two characters epitomizing typical (actually stereotypical, some have said sexist) male-female relationships. The play starts, literally, \in the beginning\ and follows the couple through their expulsion from Paradise, the birth and death of their sons, and even- tually, to Eve's death. Biblical implications are virtually non- existent and the play focuses instead on the romance of the relationship and the comedy of being new inhabitants in their own private world. Adam initially dislikes the new creature in the Garden, but once he invites her into his shelter during a rainstorm-and she immediately begins redecorating--the audience knows she's there to stay. In a later scene, Adam is convinced their first son is actually a fish, and he urges Eve to let- him put it in the pond. Much of the play's charm comes from innocent scenes like that. Ultimately, the story is a reaffirmation of the love that emerges not in spite of male-female differences, but because of them. The play featured Michael Hiller as Adam and Leslie Shamilzadeh as Eve and both were terrific in singing and acting. Andrew Livernois as the snake who charms them out of Eden was an effective reptile, and ~redit should also be given to Randi Goldstein, the play's offstage pianist and assistant to at Proctor's Theatre Peter, Paul and Mary By KAREN M. STASH On Wednesday, May 7, Peter, Paul and Mary performed an excellent show at Proctor's Theatre. Not ·only was it a fabulous concert, but it also was a chance to escape back to the social activism of the 1960's and 1970's. Peter; Paul, and Mary very successfully blend their political and social views with folk-oriented music~ Because they express their concern for our world, they have earned a tremendous following. In fact, they're the most succe'ssful folk trio in the history of popular music with songs such as: \If I Had A Hammer,\ \Leaving On A Jet Plane,\ \Blowing In The Wind,\ \Stewball \Puff The Magic Dragon,\ and \Where Have All The Flowers Gone?\ 'l)ese songs are many of the songs we have sung with our older brothers and sisters or learned at swmner camp. When we learned them, however, we probably did not realiZe all that they were saying. For example, the song, \Where Have All The Flowers Gone?\ tells a sad story of the cycle of life in wartime. The flowers get picked by young girls, the young girls get married to men, the men become soldiers, the soldiers die and are buried in graveya·rds, and the graveyards turn to flowers once again. The trio began in 1961 with a performance in New York at The Bitter End. They have since toured throughout the world. They disbanded in 1970, but their spirit lived on. Now, twenty .. fi've years since they first began, they are recreating that sanie feeling they began in the '60's. The concert itself was very moving. They had many sing~a­ longs and the audj.ence felt a part of the performance. As Mary coiilrnented, \One of the most moving moments for us is the coming together of thousands of people who are reaching for the warmth of a shared commitment. When songs can break the walls of alienation, it makes a c;om- munity out of a concert hall.\ Twenty-five years ago, Peter, Paul, and Mary had the fortune of expressing their beliefs successfully through ~ong. Today, they still continue to share that concern by their gift of music. - Mommy· and Daddy director Donald Voss. Edward Albee's The American Dream is also a comedy, but in no other way does it resemble '11le Apple Tree. Albee's play is a dark, satirical look at contemporary America that criticizes people's inability to communicate with each other. This theme is repeated excessively in the play: Mommy argues over whether her new hat is beige, wheat, or cream colored (exhibiting the trivial inadequacies of language), Grandma continually com· plains about .how most people deal with the elderly, and when Mommy casually suggests that her guest Mrs. Barker take off her dress instead of her coat- and she does-none of the other characters seem to notice because none of them· are paying attention. Albee draws surrealistic characters and puts them in surrealistic settings to make observations on society's decay of human relations and communi~ation. E:ven th& title refers to the character of the Young Man, who, by his own admission, is the per- sonific.ation of charm and surface beauty, _with no un- derlying depth. ''I am in- complete .. .! can feel nothing,\ he explains, thus embodying what Albee sees as the shallowness apd artificiality of America. The character of the grand- mother (a five-star per-· formance from Leslie Orner) is the most realistic, but even that is ironic since she's not really a grandmother at all. She is able to occasionally slip outside the action of the play, commenting on it to the audience and even joining them in watching one scene. She brings the play to its unorthodox conclusion by suddenly interrupting the final scene and announcing that there is no point in going any further, since the play is a comedy and everybody has what he thinks he wants. Sound nihilistic\? Well, Albee has said it was his intention to offend with this play and while that may be a bit ofa cop-out (if all playwrights said their plays were supposed to be offensive they'd be virtually unassailable from a critical standpoint), but his observations on American society are well presented and the comedy is entertaining throughout. Credit, too must go to the fine student cast who did an admirable job with some occasionally difficult material. All in all, an enjoyable evening of theater with two very different, thought-provoking comedies.

Adaptation at the Egg ByTOD DIMMICK \I Uke the idea of this play. It was difficUlt and it was intense. Everybody worked together; we had to!\ sais Gary Aldrich in his own impression of the play; Great Expectatkms is the latest performance of the Empire State Institute for the Performing Arts (ESlPA). The stage adaptation was crafted by Barbara Field, and she did an impressive . job. Adapting a lengthy and complex: Dickens' novel into a play, which is both true to tbe plot and short enough to sit through, is no small task .. Ms. Field created a -three- hour piece using several techniques. She preserved most of the characters, · but con- densed much of the action into narrative done by the a<;tor concerned. The action . would occasicmally stop to allow a cha-racter to tell his-her thoughts at the moment. Through these methods, per- spective and humor that may have been lost through the sacrifice of volume was regained by the. narration of events and emotions by the In the Arts ... characters. \I think it was true to form, but of course much quicker,\ S<lid John Thomas McGuire III who played Her- bert Pocket. The action took place so swiftly th.at close concentration was necessary to follow the plot's twists and turns. The speed translates into the intensity and precise timing and cooperation of which Mr. Aldrich spoke. · Because there are so many characters, the added frenzy of costume changes was thrown in. Mr. Aldrich had to go through costume changes 15 times during each show, from the Aged Parent to tailor, coach passenger, Matthew Pocket, Undertaker, Freighter Captain, Creditor, and Lieutenant, and then back again. For those who have not read Great Expectations, here is a brief summary: Pip is the name of the central character. We grow · up with him from childhood, following his narration. Pip is born a peasant, and is happy as one untU he is laughed at by a rich little girl whom he desperately wants to impress. Driven by his Parents' By KIMBERLY HANCOCK This year, Pare~n~' Weekend and the arts, seemed to go hand in hand. Among the multitudes of tb.ings for parents to do were many mini-concerts and per- formlplces by student groups. The weekend begari on Friday night with the Mountebanks' night of comedy. They per- formed two one-act plays en- titled \The Diary of Adam and Eve\ and \The American Dream.\ The first was an. adaptation of a Mark .Twain story starring Michael Hiller as Adam, Leslie Shamilzadeh as Eve and Andrew Livernoise as the .snake. The play was an entertaining version of the Biblical Adam and Eve story which ultimately explored the relationships between men and women. Mike and Leslie were extremely humorous in presenting the stereotypical characters and Andrew was as conniving as a snake could he. Overall the performance was extremely entertaining. The second of the plays, \The American Dream,'' was Edward Albee's interpretation of the modem values of the Ameri(!an people. He states, \It was my intention to offend ... as well as amuse and entertain.\- and that was exactly what it did. The performers made the show, as the story could be characterized as strange. Julie Breslow and Steve Brown played the Mommy and Daddy and Leslie Orner was fantastic as Grandma. Leslie in herself added the majority of the humor to the play and her performance pulled the play together. Mrs. Barker was played by Heather Kahn and the Young Man by Clayton Conklin who was perfectly typecast for the part. The other happening on campus. was . David Steinberg, the well known comedian. Although his performance was short, there was no lack of quality. He debuted some material which he will perform later th~s year in Carnegie Hall. All day Saturday there were exhibits ofstudent works in the Arts Building. On the main level were the finest examples from the Color I class and also various examples from Pain- ting. Each exhibit indicated the talents of both the students and instructors. Upstairs was an exhibit of student photography from Photo I, 2 3, and in· dependent study. Photos in- cluded clever self-portraits with a friend as well as unique shots pride to become a gentleman, he becomes dissatisfied with his surroundings. Change did not seem possible, but out of nowhere a mysterious benefactor offers to pay for his schooling in London, as a young gentlemen. Pip goes to London and begins his schooling, and an analysis of the many people he meets, all of whom are somehow connected with each other, would be well worth a lengthy paper. It is enough to say that he achieves what he thought he wanted, yet was still not happy. Ambition has a way of changing even as it comes within one's grasp. Victorian England, with its heights and depths of .society, creates the backdrop for this overflowing plot. Great Expectations as a stage adaptation was a success to credit to ESIPA's list. With continuous quality and active experimentation such as this, it is easy to understand why ESIPA was chosen as the first representative of American culture to be sent to the Soviet Union. of farms. Once again this exhibit demonstrated talent and creativity. The Dutch Pipers gave their annual Parents' Weekend Concert on Saturday and this year were joined by the newly formed Garnet Minstrels. Performing from the steps of the library the Pipers sang old favorites like \Two Silhouettes on the Shade,\ Skellar favorite \Under the Boardwalk\ and my personal favorite \Shame and Scandal on the Family.\ Their performance included slow ballads performed with much feeling as well as upbeat favorites. - To complement the Pipers a women's singing group, the Garnet Minstrels, was formed last fall. In their Parents' Weekend performances the Minstrels performed ~'Why Do Fools Fall in Love,\ . \Big Spender,\ \Danny Boy\ and the amusing \Chiquita Banana\ . featwing Sharon Panas as head banana. As the finale the Pipers and Minstrels joined to sing a medley of Union College· songs including Union's Fight Song and Alma Mater. The total performance was a great success despite the noise from the neighboring barbeque.

The Union College Arts Club presented a group of talented students and faculty members in their spring performance of classical music. The per- formance included ~inger Marc Howard who was accompanied by LeAta Jackson, Dave Civale performed Mozart's Horn ~onata No. I and Edward Lin performed Scarlatti's B major. Joanne Berger, flutist, was accompanied by Janice Thompson in Mozart's Andante in C. Debussy's Arabesque No. I was performed by Janet Keyll. LeAta, once again, was the accompanist for James Marshall. The lone faculty performer was Professor Hugh Allen Wilson. _ The Jazz Band played as parents, students, and faculty gathered for the President's reception. On this beautiful afternoon the music floated through Library Plaza as parents and students mingled with the faculty. The cabaret performers in- cluded Dave Provost and Chris Siler. Although Chris. was weak at the start of the performance, Dave's accomplished guitaring pulled them through. The original songs which Dave performed proved his inunense musical talent and their overall performance was enjoyable. The next act \The Court Gestures\ were not so for~ tunate. A usually hilarious improv group, the Gestures had problems relating to the parents' level ·Of humor and tried again and again to amuse them. Unwilling to give up until they had accomplished this, their performance was significantly too long. The next act was rushed and many audience members ex- pressed that they would have liked to see more of guitarist Jim Havard and singer Melanie Masterson. The last act Jim Hassenfeld and his band had no time to perform due to poor planning. The\ Clfnner cabaret was a wonderful idea but more planning and appropriate acts were needed to make it a true success. OVerall, there was much for the parents to do and see in the field of Arts, and the students and faculty did a marvelous job in displaying their talents. All their hard work paid off.

Page l3 Dicken's Adaptation at the Egg :By TOD DIMMICK \I like the idea of this play. It was difficult and it was intense. Everybody worked together; we had to!\ sais Gary Aldrich in his own impression of the play. Great Expectations is the latest performance of the Empire State Institute for the Performing Arts (ESIPA). The stage adaptation was crafted by Barbara Field, and she did an impressive job. Adapting a lengthy and complex: Dickens' novel into a play, which is both true to the plot and short enough to sit through, is no small task. Ms. Field created a three- hour piece using several techniques. She preserved most of the characters, but con- densed much of the action into narrative done by the actor concerned. The action would occasionally stop to allow a cha·racter to tell his-her thoughts at the moment. Through these methods, per- spective and humor that may have been lost through the sacrifice of volume was regained by the narration of events and emotions by the In the Arts ... characters. \I think it was true to form, but of course much quicker,\ said John Thomas McGuire III who played Her- bert Pocket. The action took place so swiftly that close concentration was necessary to follow the plot's twists and turns. The speed translates into the intensity ami. precise timing and cooperation of which Mr. Aldrich spoke. Because there are so many characters, the added frenzy of costume changes was thrown in.

Page 18 '. CONCORDIENSIS, May 15, 1986 <Hnncnrbiensis SPORTS Ruggers Destroy R.P .1. By CHRIS SHERIDAN The first hit of the game:. John Friske. But then again, when hasn't he had the first hit of the game? Friske, senior co- captain of Union's Rugby team, led the rugge,rs on Saturday to a 16-6 destruction of RPI in front of a huge Parents' Weekend crowd. For Friske and several other seniors, Saturday marked their last ever rugby game for Union. ~~d Hart and Jeff Wilson also ,;layed their last game on )aturday. Union scored first in the game. Within three mmutes of the opening kickoff, sophomore Tom Muzzinigro got the ball off the end of the line and ran it in for his first career A-team try. \The ball was worked down the line really well,\ felt sophomore serum-half Rich Allen. \The line was really clicking on Saturday. We played really well as a team.\ Dave Blee was unable to convert the try but not too long later he got a second chance. Friske received the ball, and ran as far as he could before he was forced to dish off to Hart who ran it in for the try. Although Hart got the try; Fr-iske took the hit and earns the assist after making a beautiful pass for the try. Blee converted the points after the second try and Union was ahead at half- time, 10-o. Since RPI brought no B- squad, the B-team had to substitute in the second half. Although it was th.eir last game playing, the seniors realized that the B's came to play and deserved to play, so they sat out in the second half. Senior second-row Jeff Albrecht, who will be returning in the Fall to take some extra courses, stayed in the game in the second half and put the icing on the cake for the Union ruggers. Midway through the second half, with the ball bobbling around, Albrecht showed that he wanted a try when he grabbed the ball and outraced any possible com- petition 65 meters down the field for his fourth try of the season (his three previous ones came in a B game versus Oneonta earlier in the season.) \The ball was just there\ he described. \It was like it was set for me. There was only one person between me and the try-zone. I took a quick cut to the sideline and he couldn't catch me. It was great to win in front of that · crowd. They were so loud.'' This play showed his speed, and earlier he showed his power when, while running with the ball, an RPI opponent bounced off of him and was thrown about seven feet. Fortunately for Union, Albrecht will return in the fall. . As far as the other seniors that won't be returning, \It will be a major loss,\ Albrecht felt. \We'll be hurting for a lot of experienc.e at different positions.\ Albrecht noted that he was very impressed with junior prop Tom Christienson in the second half. \I was so tired in the second half, and he was pushing our whole side of the serum.\ \They had a good serum,\ felt Rob Sharp, \but in the end, the more powerful serum came out ahead.\ And, as the seniors leave, they'll have in their minds the , thought that John Friske ex- pressed as he looked down upon the field the following day, the goal posts still standing, the dirt all dug up from constant scrumming. \I don't belive I won't be playing there anymore.\ Rugby ends season by shutting out R.

Track Wins 3 Events By ANDY HODGKIN The Union men's outdoor track team began to wind down their season and year this past weekend with the New York · State Meet in Rochester. Coach Russ Ebbets s~id that everything went real well as qualifying members turned in fine performances for Ute Dutchmen. Out of a total of forty-seven points the Dutchmen got three first place finishes and one second place finish to highlight the performances of the team. Senior Scott Remillard was a double winner for Union in the hammer throw and the discus. He won the State Championship in each event with throws of 182'4\ and 150'8\ respectively. In the 800 meter event junior Rob Mohlar took first place honors with a time of 1:53.7. Mohlar is one Dutchman who is looking to qualify for the Division II Nationals in that ev.ent and has one more chance at the Union Spring Classic this Friday night. He needs a 1:52.11 as a qualifying time. Placing second for the Dut- chmen in the 3000 meter steeplechf).se was senior Chri.s O'Donnell. His placing time was 9:·22.31. Rounding out the scoring for the Dutchmen was Todd Allen in the 200 meter dash. He placed fourth in the event with a time of 22.0 seconds. Also placing fourth was Remillard in the shotput. with a throw of 44'10%\. The Dutchmen made a contribution as a team as the 4xl00 relay team placed sixth with a time of 44.41 seconds. The team was Allen, Steve Hayes, Rich Romer, and Wayne Lacy. The Union Dutchrilen are sending two representatives to the Nationals so far in Scott Remillard in the weights and Chris O'D.onnell in the steeplechase. Mohlar ·. is a possibl.e candidate if he qualifies on Friday. Good luck to all t~ee competitors. (ij '0 0 :::> .... en >- .0 .E 0 .r:. 0..

John's exceptional play has been overlooked this year because of the great offensive threats on the lacrosse team, and also because he played so well last year, his outstanding play was expected. John ha~ come up big for the second year in a row to establish himself as a top Divlsion UI goalie. Among his feats, John has yet to miss a minute of play in his two seasons at Union, which is a big deal in lacr<>sse where injuries to goalies are common. John has won 16 out of 26 games in his career and 8 this season against 4 losses, Only 85 goals were ; scored on John · this, season for a 7.1 goalS agamst average .. John had 249 shots taken on him and had a .659 save ~rcentage. Among the ma:ny nuraculous games for 3 . .

Last year- John had a save percentage of .677 to rank him among the top goalies in Division III, the first time a Union gQalie has had that honor in years. John is a sophomore from DeWitt, NY, where he played high school lacrosse at .Jamesville DeWitt. John is a brother at Chi Psi and he is doing equally well in his major, Mathematics, as he does on the ~ lacrosse field for the Dutchmen. o Congratulations to \Thomey\ i on his .fine play this season o along with the rest of Union's 111 lacrosse team for their sue· cessful season.

SaUgUSr MA) Crew· Finishes Strong By 209 oarsmen As last reported; Union's crew team did travel to Philadelphia for the annual Dad Vail Regatta this past weekend. For most this proved to l>e an anti~climactic end to a rather successful season. The only crew to place in the qualifying heats on Friday was the women's open eight. The women then moved on to the finals on Saturday, where they were knocked out in the first round. · While many saw the varsity men's eight as having a good. shot at advancing to the finals, they suffered a considerable setback moments before their first race. While on a warm-up run beforethis race, varsity six- man John Wyatt collided head on with a low overhang near some bleachers and was then unable to row. A car was sent back to our ho~el and ten minutes later, after having just been wokenup, JV six-man Dave Gascoigne found himself paddling up to th~ starting line. While Dave made an excellent showing, such a ·dramatic and sudden change can have ' devestating results on a crew,s performance. Nevertheless, the weather and conditions were great and the team was blessed with the greatest show of support in its three-year bistonr. Parents and friendS came from all over, bringing a tent and food for the weekend's races. The team is grateful to those parents and non-rowers who came to sup- port us and help ollt.

Thanks for a good year, The Union College Rowing Association. arnni:nr~ttnsis :SPORTS Charlie Slotnlk Looking a·t Sports The Union college lacrosse team completed their second consecutive winning season with an impressive 11-4 win over- HartWick. The victory lifted the Dutchmen's record to 8-4, an improvement over last year's s-.; record. The laxmen won their first three games of the season against Rochester, Hobart, Geneseo, and put together another three-game winning streak in the middle of the season with wins over Hamilton, RPI, and Colgate. But the laxmen could not keep the consistency they possessed during these parts of the season throughout the spring. \Losing to Oneonta was a J,'eal disappointment, we should have won that game, we had a man advantal!e in overtime and we . still couldn't win,\ said second year coach Mike Toop. Since coming to Union last year, Toop has turned the lacrosse program around at Union. Not ' . only has Toop put together a team with a winning record, something that had not been until six: years before he arrived at Union, but Toop has also brought a winning attitude to the lacrosse program. \I don't think that there is any question that we. have changed the attitude around. You can tell that by the disappointment of the players over this year's eight-win season. They aren't satisfied at being a good team, they want to be better than that,\ said Toop. Moreover this is an attitude that Toop shares, for he is not one to celebrate for anything short of perfection during games, or in practice. At tirnes· during practice Toop has thrown the team off the field due to lack of effort. ' 1 Just practicing for the sake of practicing is a waste of time. If . they don't come to practice ready one day, and I stop practice they'll come prepared the next day,\ said Toop. Although Toop deserves much credit for the turnaround in the Union lacrosse program, he would just seem ordinary if he did not have the tremendous players that he has. Sophomore goalie John Thorne has stopped over 65 percent of the shots opponents have taken on him in his two years at Union. As Toop said, himself, \We don't win games without 'Thorny'.\ John Thorne's performance in goal has certainly helped make the Union lacrosse program respectable again, but teams cannot win without scoring goals. Tony Darin, Phil Horn, and John Romeo have done just that, combining for 73 goals in just ten games. Moreover, Andy Ross and Mike Weissberger have anchored a strong corps of midfielders that have helped out offensively and defensively . The Lacrosse program is going in the right direction as the Dutchmen have proved to be the best team in the area. ThiS season the laxmen defeated RPI, Siena, and Albany St. to win the first annual Capital District Cup. Union should be strong again neKt year as they lose only four · seniors, · and have a strong group of freshmen lacrosse players entering in the fall. Furthel'more the Dutchmen will have Chuck Priore, the head coach at Albany this year, as a full time assistant next year. This addition should take some of the burden off of Toop, enable the players to receive more instruction, and possibly make Toop's goal of having an un- defeated squad in 1987 a reality. An 8-4 season is a successful season, and next year should be even more promising as Toop will emphasize fall practices, which will make the players more committed to lacrosse. \All in all I'd have to say that it was a very satisfying season,\ said Toop. \But I must admit, I'm looking forward to an even better year in 1987.\ Dave Sueden, Moose Reynard, and Paul Emsbo row merrily down the Mohawk.

May 15, 1986 Batsmen Finish 15-7, Look to E.C.A.C. Tourney By SID SCHENECTADY, N.Y.- Though a late-season slump kept the Dutchmen from tying the Union College record for wins in a season (16), the Gamet still posted an im- pressive 15-7 record for the 1986 campaign. Union, which is 31-15 over the last two seasons ( .673), completed its third consecutive winning campaign. Dutchmen hit Slump The Dutchmen, 11m1 in their first dozen outings, finished the year by winning just four of · their last 10. The hitters, who combined for a team batting average of .313, couldn't totally overcome the lack of consistent pitching. Union's moWldsmen gave up 117 earned runs on 208 hits and 125 walks while posting an earned run average of 5.46. While the pitchers had their problems, the hitters had very few. Junior centerfielder Alex Rita was Union's leading hitter for the second time in his three- year varsity career. The team's Most Valuable Player stroked the ball at a .415 clip and also led the squad 'in runs scored (33), and hits (32) while finishing second with 17 walks and nine stolen base:s. Once more, the career .407 hitter has fanned just five times in 221 at 'bats while collecting 90 hits. Since Rita has been roaming the outfield. for the Dutchmen, Union's baseball program has a three-year combined record-' of 40-21 (.656). Senior utilityman Peter Cohan, one of only four players to graduate from the team, had his best season in four years. Cohan hit a career high .389 and led the team with 32 rbi, eight doubles, and four home runs. Against Williams, he went five- for-five with fiv~ rbi. Cohan, who graduates with 87 career hits, has ripped 18 doubles, two triples, and 10 home runs while driving in 79 runs in 72 games.

J' CX:V, No.23 Union Offers New Marine Stu:dies Pro·gram laterdisciplinary Term Abroad Situated in U.S. By DAVID MARIN Beginning next fall, Union will he offering an entirely new term abroad here in the United States. The Marine Studies Program . will be offered through the Terms Abroad Office and Will run every other spring term starting next year. The term is an extension of a program that has been developing at Union over the last fifteen years. It will combine Biology 52: Marine Biology, Liberal Learning 55: Images of the Sea, and . a new course, Sociology 58: Marine Policy and the Maritime Enviroment. Previously, students in the · first two cour'Ses spent two weeks prior to the fall term on an island off the coast of Maine. The new term abroad will o.ffer all three courses in an intensive eight-week tet·m that wUl en- compass four different learning enviroments. · .. The students will conve11e in Bermuda and spend two weeks there, centered at the Bermuda Biological Station at St. Georges. Professor Carl Ge<)l~ge of Biology explains Bermada's significance as stemming from > .c ~ J:: •Q. · host to sedimentary coasts, salt . marshes and lagoons. In North . ·Carolina, students will study man's adaptation to the local enviroment, and . espe.cially the organizations that have evolved there. In particular, . students will review fisheries, their uses and abuses. Students will also examine the social dynamics of fishing villages, coastal technology, and the uses and abuses of the coastline by man. · ~· Following ·~he two weeks ~ North Catolma, students will board an approximately one hundred foot long sailing vessel and travel two weeks north along coasts, examinng estuaries, coastlines, Chesapeake Bay communities, Cape Cod, New Bedford, and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. . Students will then debark at the Shoals Marine Laboratory for· tbe final- .phase of the prilgra.rn at ;Applecyore Islan~ in the Gulf of Maine, about rune · miles outside Portsmouth. This area is characterized by a rocky coastlille, major colonies of marine birds and a cold climate. Appledore Island is part of an archipelago of islands Appledore Island in tl1e Gu.lt of Maine is one of four phases in the new Marine Studies program. its coral reefs, the .fact that it is a volcanic island, and as a model of man's adaptation to life when surrounded by sea. This includes study of the political and sociGlogical aspects and the poetic and literary implications of living on an island. All three courses will start in Bennuda, con- centrating on the histor:-y of the sea, the law of the sea, and iSland technology. The second phase of the program will be conducted .in Beaufort, North Carolina at the Duke Marine Laboratory, situated on the outer banks of North carolina. 'I'hi$ area is known as the Isles of Shoals. In this last phase, topics . of study will include New England maritime heritage and more on island technology. Coordinators Professor Bene Kaplan of Sociology (also Dean of Faculty) and Professor Carl , George both pointed out the uniqueness of t~e ~ro~ram, noting its multtdisctphnary focus.

Residence Life Committee Issues Report on Housing Recommendations Outlined By JON COHN On the subject ·of resident living for the future; many questions have come up. Will there be. a solution to Union's housing ·shortage? AJ,le there · moves being lllade toward construction to end this problem? How will the school deal with the problems of in- sufficient lounge space in dorms such as West college? Recently a committee involving nine Union Staff member:-s, and headed by Dean of Residence Life, David Wood, studied these and other resident life problems and came up with a statistical report with proposals into the issues involved. The committee, using national statistics; found that living conditions greatly in- fluence student attitudes, . maturity and loyalty to the college. More impDrtantly, academic output and motivation to learn are in- fluenced by living conditions. It · is important, the committee found, for the student to feel good about the school in order to create a good reputation for the school making it attractive for future students. Finally, among students themselves, good relations are the results of living conditions. Poor living conditions, such as over- crowding, result in students transferring their dissatisfaction with the school to other people~ ~ · The main portion of · the research was done by com• 1 paring Union to other schools. The colleges that were surveyed are comparable in student body, as well as overall campus similarity. Schools involved · were Williams, Colgate, Hamilton, Amherst, Hartwick and RPJ. The statistics clearly point towards a Union lag in the times. The majority of other colleges house approximately 90 percent of their students on campus, while Union houses only 75 percent on campus. In other words, Union haS 15 percent more students off campus than the average. · Union also does not offer academic or theme houses such as Colgate or Williams. In addition, Union carne in last of an the schools in offering studentsthe chance to live in co- ed housing. The survey shows that. most colleges offer 90 percent independent co-ed housing, while Union only has 50 percent co-ed housing. The committee also con- ducted a telephone survey among students living off campus. The resUlts of 350 total off-campus students, was collective information on 270. It was discovered that 76 students felt that they had been forced to move off campus and 129 would return to the campus if an apartment complex with kit- chens was made available. Total analysis of all living quarters was then made in order to be able to arrive at conclusions. It was found over the past five years, that the college has converted eigllt floor lounges into student rooms: West College (4), Rich- mond (3) and Bronner (1). This was · done to accomodate students as well as deal with im- balance between populations because of fall and Winter term abroad students. Since it is unfair to move a student in- voluntarily during the year, that lounge space is lost com- pletely for that. year. It was found that Union ac- cepts and enrolls more transfer students than any other college surveyed. Each year, out of the 60 to 75 transfers,. about 35 request campus housing. Most of these students end up in college owned and Greek maintained housing units. The general consensus, despite the best intentions of the college and Greek presidents, . is dissatisfaction with living conditions due to noise or space. Continued on page 2 May 22, t986. Morris Elected to Skidmore Board of Trustee.s . Uni'on Faculty Give Opinions By JAY M. GROSSMAN Recently . Union College President J.ohn Morris was elected to the Board of Trustees of Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York, Dr. Joseph· C. Palamountain, President of Skidmore, announced Morris' four year appointment. PalCt.'llountain cited M-orris' \experiences and high level of performa1-,Ce\ in the field of educatio11 as the basis for the Board's decision. \His' 'con- tribution will be especially important in a time of presidential. transition,,. he added. Palamountain will be leaving his office next year. Morris became 1-' resident of Union College in 1979, the six- teenth to assume that title. Before then, _Morris was a faculty member and, lat.er, acting President of Colgate University. As with most other issqes, it · was difficult to form a con- sensus from the faculty's point of view. One faculty member that asked that his name be withheld said, \I question the appropriateness of his decision. If I were in his shoes, I would not have accepted the position. However, it is up to Morris and the Board (of Trustees) to decide whether or not it is proper. If he complains that he doesn't have enough time on the Union campus because of his traveling schedule, I question whether his time spent traveling to Skidmore will be productive for Union College.\ Political Science Professor · Byron Nichols said that, \as long as no potential conflict of interests on issues arises, it is probably good for Morris to see another college from another perspective. It will certainly be good for Skidmore to have :;m educator serve on their Board. •• Nichols also cited some examples where possible conflict of interests could arise. \If Union and Skidmore were seeking funds from the same foundation or trying to acquire a grant in expansion of the library,\ Morris may be put in a difficult position. In addition, Nichols said that · there was a case a few years ago where the president of a women's college sat on the Board of Trustees of another women's college nearby. The college whose Board she sat on was doing rather poorly and the vote came up. on whether they Continued on. page 4

The term is an extension of a program that has been developing at Union over the last fifteen years. It will combine Biology 52: Marine Biology, Liberal Learning 55: Images of the Sea, and a new course, Sociology 58: Marine Policy and the Maritime Enviroment. Previously, students in the· first two courses spent two weeks prior to the fall term on an island off the coast of Maine. The new term abroad will offer all three courses in an intensive eight-week term that will en- compass four different learning enviroments. The students will convene in Bermuda and spend two weeks there, centered at the Bermuda Biological Station at St. Georges. Professor Carl George of Biology explains Bermuda's significance as stemming from >- .0 $2 0 .s:: c. host to sedimentary coasts, salt marshes and lagoons. In Nmth Carolina, students will study man's adaptation to the local enviroment, and especially the organizations that have evolved there. In particular, students will review fisheries, their uses and abuses. Students will also examine the social dynamics of fishing villages, coastal technology, and the uses and abuses of the coastline by man. ~~ Following the two weeks in Nor-th Carolina, students will board an approximately one hundred foot long sailing vessel and travel two weeks north along coasts, examinng estuaries, coastlines, Chesapeake Bay communities, Cape Cod, New Bedford, and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. . Students will then debark at the Shoals Marine Laboratory for the final phase of the program at Appledore lslan~ in the Gulf of Maine, about nme miles outside Portsmouth. This area is characterized by a rocky coastline, major colonies of marine birds and a cold climate. Appledore Island is part of an archipelago of islands Appledore Island in the Gulf of Maine is one of four phases in the new Marine Studies program. its coral reefs, the fact that it is a volcanic island, and as a model of man's adaptation to life when surrounded by sea. This includes study of the political and sociological aspects and the poetic and literary implications of living on an island. All three courses will start in Bermuda, con- centrating on the history of the sea, the law of the sea, and island technology. The second phase of the program will be conducted in Beaufort, North Carolina at the Duke Marine Laboratory, situated on the 1>uter banks of North Carolina. This area is known as the Isles of Shoals. In this last phase, topics of study will include New England maritime heritage and more on island technology. Coordinators Professor llene Kaplan of Sociology (also Dean of Faculty) and Professor Carl George both pointed out the uniqueness of t~e. ~ro~ram, noting its multldtsclphnary f1>cus. Says Kaplan, \The Marine Studies Program as a whole will combine sociological, biological, and philosophical perspectives as they re~ate to adaptations to the marme en- viroment.\ Those involved in the CQntinued on page 2 ....

Residence Life Committee Issues Report on Housing Recommendations Outlined By JON COHN On the subject of resident living for the future, many questims have come up. Will there be a solution to Union's housing shortage? Are there moves being made toward construction to end this problem? How will the school deal with the problems of in- sufficient lounge space in dorms such as West college? Recently a committee involving nine Union Staff members, and headed by Dean of Residence Life, David Wood, studied these and other resident life problems and carne up with a statistical report with proposals into the issues involved. The committee, using national statistics, found that living conditions greatly in- fluence student attitudes, matlll'ity and loyalty to the college. More importantly, academic output and motivation to learn are in- fluenced by living conditions. It is important, the committee found, for the student to feel good a bout the school in order to create a good reputation for the sch()ol making it attractive for future students. Finally, among students themselves, good relations are the results of living conditions. Poor living conrlitions, such as over- crowding, result in students transferring their dissatisfaction with the school to ()ther people. all the schools in offering students the chance to live in co- ed housing. The survey shows that most colleges offer 90 percent independent co-ed housing, while Union only has 60 percent co-ed housing. The committee also con- rlucted a telephone survey among students living off campus. The results of 350 total off-campus students, was collective information on 270. It was discovered that 76 students felt that they had been forced to move off campus and 129 would return to the campus if an apartment complex with kit- chens was made available. Total analysis of all living quarters was then made in order to be able to arrive at conclusions. It was found over the past five years, that the college has converted eight floor lounges into student rooms: West College (4), Rich- mond ( 3) and Bronner (1). This was done to accomodate students as well as deal with im- balance between populations because of fall and winter term abroad student.c;. Since it is unfair to move a student in- voluntarily during the year, that lounge space is lost com- pletely for that year. It was found that Union ac- cepts and enrolls more transfer students than any other college surveyed. Each year, out of the 60 to 75 transfers, about 35 request campus housing. Most of these students end up in college owned and Greek maintained housing units. The ' general consensus, despite the best intentions of the college and Greek presidents, is dissatisfaction with living conditions due to noise or space.

GROSSMAN Recently Union College President John Morris was elected to the Board of Trustees of Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York. Dr. Joseph C. Palamountain, President of Skidmore, announced Morris' four :vear appointment. Pala'1lountain cited Morris' \experit'nces and high level of perforrna1,ce\ in the field of educatio1~ as the basis for the Board's cecision. \His con- tribution will be especially important ln a time of presidential transition,\ he added. Palamou~tain will be leaving his office next year . Morris became l' ;esident of Union College in 1979, the six- teenth to assume that title. Before then, Morris W<!s a faculty member and, later, acting President of Colgate University. As with most other issues, it was difficult to form a con- sensus from the faculty's point of view. One faculty member that asked that his name be withheld said, \I question the appropriateness of his decision. If I were in his shoes, I would not have accepted the position. However, it is up to Morris and the Board (of Trustees) to decide whether or not it is proper. If he complains that he doesn't have enough time on the Union campus because of his traveling schedule, I question whether his time spent traveling to Skidmore will be productive for Union College.\ Political Science Professor Byron Nichols said that, \as long as no potential conflict of interests on issues arises, it is probably good for Morris to see another college from another perspective. It will certainly be good for Skidmore to have an educator serve on their Board.·' Nichols also cited some examples where possible conflict of interests could arise. \if Union and Skidmore were seeking funds from the same foundation or trying to acquire a grant in expansion of the library,'' Morris may be put in a difficult position. In addition, Nichols said that there was a case a few years ago where the president of a women's college sat on the Board of Trustees of another women's college nearby. The college whose Board she sat on was doing rather poorly and the vote came up _on whether they Continued on page 4 The main portion of the research was done by com- paring Union to other schools. The colleges that were surveyed are comparable in student body, as well as overall campus similarity. Schools involved were Williams, Colgate, Hamilton, Amherst, Hartwick and RPI. The statistics clearly point towards a Union lag in the times. The majority of other colleges house approximately 00 percent of their students on campus, while Union houses only 75 percent on campus. In other words, Union has 15 percent more students off campus than the average. Unhm also does not offer academic or theme houses such as C<llgate or Williams. In addition, Union came in last of 'Ibis Week: Special Fitzhugh Ludlow Insert Election Statements, page 5

Housing Conditions and Availability Analyzed Continued from page 1 Many of these st11dents move · into independent hol!Sing winter term; others move off campus. It seems Wlfair te subject people who have ci!Dsen Union over another scho()l for any reason to unsatisfactory living conditions. The main body llf the report was en the sch11ols present housing preference system. Each year, freshman are guaranteed on campus housing. The seniors, junior:s and finally sophomores are then given lottery numbers assigned by computer. Seniors are given the best choices of available rooms, while sophomores, especially males, are given the worst. Exchange students, transfers, former students returning and off campus students are housed after sophomores in that order. Many complaints have been corning to the administration as a result of tllis system. Sophomore males who receive a poor number will most likely not get the housing that they want, either living off campus or as an independent in a fraternity. R~peatedly, situations arise where sophomores do not want to leave their friends and decide to live off campus, even though the schoel offered them some housing. The result of this is the likely denial of their return to campus, possibly for the remainder of tlleir time at Union. The committee feels that this is unfair and this situation must be addressed. Focus on allocated space at Union was also em important issue raised by the committee. By dividing lounge space, such as at Fox or Davidson, available to independent residents by the nwnber or independents in tile halls, each student is alloted an average of 7 square feet of space. The equivalent figure for Greek residents in the dorms is 47 square feet. Tile committee tended to say that this was an unfair space distiil>ution, not ']his new housing would also without debate.

CONCORDIENSIS, May 22, 1986 Pagel Chief U.S. Prosecutor In Nuremberg Trials To Speak On \Laws Of War'' at Last Minerva ByGREGFAY After World War n ended with the defeat of Germany, a landmark in international law was set down by the Inter• national War Crimes 'Trials in Nuremberg,_ GeriQany, which lasted from 1946 through 1949. Schenectady born 'Telford Taylor, chief prosectuor for the U.S. Office for the Prosecution of Axis Criminality · in Nuremberg, will :be this term's las Minerva lecturer on Wed~ nesday, May 28. His talk is titled . \The Laws of War: Do They Have Meaning in Today's • World?'' Perhaps the greatest C()n- troversy regarding thEse trials for the prosecution -of Nazi war • criminals was the grot1nds on · wbich to justif.y the leg;;tlity of ' these_. proceedings, for pothing like this had ever been done . · before. Political Science • Professor Josepl1 Boa:rd • commented, \It was really tbe · first time that an entire leadership of a losing power had be:en . indicted and tried by wmmng powers.\ No in- ternational laws for the conduct of war had existed to this time. · Therefore, prosecution would nave to proceed on ex post facto application of law. On strictly legal groWlds, this is a dubious way of doing things. But Telford Taylor and his colleagues from tile United States, Great Britain, France, and Russia, . asserted that the magnitude of Nazl inhwnanity justified this kind of new a,pproach. They justified the legal proceedings on the basis of t:hree points. First, there was Germany's crime of actually starting the war, a violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The countries that signed the Pact, including Germany, agreed never to start a war. Second, there was Germany's violation of the laws of war, such as shooting prisoners. Finally, there was Germany's horrible <:rimes against hmnanity, such <:~s the gruesome \medical\ EJq>eriments performed on innocent people. By April1948, a ne:wspaper reporter stated that thlrty.seven defendants had been sentenced to death, twenty-one to life im- prisonement, forty-three to lesser imprisonment, and that four had been acqUitted, and seventy-one still were on trial. In his book Nuremberg and Vietnam: An American Tragedy, Taylor wrote that the Nuremberg trials were \a recognition of the inadequacy of single-nation courts for authoritative interpretations of international law, and the · necessity -of establishing an international jurisdiction and working out acceptable in- ternational procedures if in- ternational law was to develop at all satisfactorily.\ Taylor, who has done everything in his career \Superbly well\ and is ''one of the great lawyers and law teachers\ according to Professor Board, will speak at 11:30 a.m. in the Music Room at Schaffer Library.

It is an extraor- dinary use of the governor's power to grant clemency. Therefore, he owes an obligation to those who gave him that power, the people of New York, to explain why he wants to use that power to free McGivern. This has to be a real explanation, pot just that William F. Buckley and a few Congressmen agree with him. It must be an intelligent and . rational explanation of why this action is justified. He has not done this, and, in my opinion, he has not tried to do so because he knows that he cannot. I believe that the real victim in this case is not Gary McGivern, but the New York State criminal justice system. Q: What has been the ~pact of last month's 60 Minutes feature?

May 22, 1986 Page3 Chief U.S. Prosecutor In Nuremberg Trials To Speak On \Laws Of War\ at Last Minerva By GREG FAY After Worlcl War II ended with the defeat of Germany, a landmark in international law was set down by the Inter- national War Crimes Trials in Nuremberg, Germany, which lasted from 1946 through 1949. Schenectady born Telford Taylor, chief prosectuor for the U.S. Office for the Prosecution of Axis Criminality in Nuremberg, will be this term's las Minerva lecturer on Wed- nesclay, May 28. His talk is titled \The Laws of War: Do They Have Meaning Ln Today' s World?\ Perhaps the greatest con- troversy regarding these trials for the prosecution of Nazi war criminals was the grounds on which to justify the legality of these proceedings, for nothing like this bad ever been done before. Political Science Professor Joseph Board commented, \It was really the first time that an entire leadership of a losing power bad b~en . indicted and tried by wmmng powers.\ No in- ternational laws for the conduct of war had existed to this time. Therefore, prosecution would have to proceed on ex post facto application of law. On strictly legal grounds, this is a dubieus way of doing things. But Telford Tayler and his colleagues from the United States, Great Britain, France, and Russia, asserted that the magnitude of Nazi inhumanity justified this kind of new approach. They justified the legal proceedings on the basis of three points~ First, there was Germany's crime of actually starting the war, a violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The countries that signed the Pact, includLng Germany, agreed never to start a war. Second, there was Germany's violation of the laws of war, such as shooting prisoners. Finally, there was Germany's horrible crimes against humanity, such as the gruesome \medical\ experiments performed on innocent people. By April1948, a newspaper reporter stated that thirty-seven defendants had been sentenced to death, twenty-one to life im- prisonement, forty-three to lesser imprisonment, and that four had been acquitted, and seventy-one still were on trial. In his book Nuremberg and Vietnam: An American Tragedy, Taylor wrote that the Nuremberg trials were \a recognition of the inadequacy ·of single-nation courts for authoritative interpretations of international law, and the necessity of establishing an international jurisdiction and working out acceptable in- ternational procedures if in- ternational law was to develop at aU satisfactorily.\ Taylor, who has dane everything in his career \Superbly well\ and is \one of the great lawyers and law teachers\ according to Professor Board, will speak at 11:30 a.m. in the Music Room at Schaffer Library. D.A. Kavanaugh Opposes McGivern Clemency Grant By PAUL SCHOP One of the most heated controversies in New York State this year is over Governor Mario Cuomo's decision to grant clemency to convicted murderer Gary McGivern. McGivern is currently serving a life sentence at the Eastern ~ New York State Correctional ~ Facility in Napanoch, eastern ~ Ulster County. Last winter, the ci state's Parole Board overruled ci the governor's request thereby ~ keeping McGivern in prison. ~ Because of the speculation 3 surrounding Governor Cuomo with regards to his possible Presidential candidacy in 1988, this controversy has received national attention. OnApril6, 60 Minutes aired a feature story on this issue, which included an interview with ffister Cotmty District Attorney Michael Kavanagh who has been an outspoken opponent of Cuomo's grant of clemency to McGivern. Two weeks ago, Concordieusis was granted an interview with Mr. Kavanagh at his office in Kingston. Q: Could you briefly describe the McGivern issue, your position ()D it, and why? A: In broad strokes, the essential issue is should we extend clemency to a five-time convicted felon who has been convicted of killing a police of- ficer, Westchester County Sheriff's Deputy Fitzgerald, and who is now serving a life sentence for that crime. If you conclude that be can be released, what standards do you use to judge whom to keep in jail? Governor Cuomo has been unwilling to justify granting McGivern clemency. Everyone agrees that this is con- troversial. It is an extraor- dinary use of the governor's power to grant clemency. Therefore, he owes an obligation to those who gave him that power, the people of New York, to explain why he wants to use that power to free McGivern. This has to be a real explanation, not just that William F. Buckley and a few Congressmen agree with him. It must be an intelligent and rational explanation of why this action is justified. He has not done this, and, in my opinion, he has not tried to do so because he knows that he cannot. I believe that the real victim in this case is not Gary McGivern, but the New York State criminal justice system. Q: What has been the impact of last month's 60 Minutes feature? How has it helped or hurt? A: The answer depends on what you consider helping or hurting. It has helped to keep McGivern in jail. The over- whelming number of responses to the story that my office here in Kingston has received have been upset by it. As far as the political ramifications of the feature go., I believe that Cuomo has beer1 burt badly by it. Although it won't affect him much when he runs for governor in New York this year, it will seriously hurt him if he runs for President in two years.

Two Alumnae Speak On Wall Street Jobs By CHRISTINE HONG On Monday, May 19, at 7 p.m., the Career Development Center sponsored an informational session; the topic was \How to Find a Job on Wall Street.\ The session, which lasted close to two hours, ranged from a discussion of the positive and negative aspects of working on Wall Street to advice on how to get a job on Wall Street. The two Union alumnae (and graduates of Columbia Business School) who addressed a group of thirty were Susan Reville, '72 and Tom O'Connor, '73. Ms. Reville is presently in Public Finance at Citibank NA. and Mr. O'Connor is Vice President at Prudential-Bache Securities, Health Care Group. While the two, at times, disagreed on fine points of approaching a career in Wall Street, they both strongly recommended to start early; this means even as early as junior year. \Being informed is im~ pressive.\ According to them, that means researching firms, being aware of recent business news, and knowing of present business trends. This can be done by regularly reading business literature such as Barron's, Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, and Institutional Investment. Annual reports from investment companies as well as their public relations material can give one an idea of the companies' platform and philosophy. Furthermore, while researching is just the first step, networking plays the major part in getting a job. Personal contacts in the field (alumnae, relatives, friends) can give you information, ad- vice, and job contacts. All this takes time. Furthermore, they noted that for those interested in interning on Wall Street, the recruiting season is in December and January of their senior year. Other suggestions they made at t)le session were: have a good background in economics, accounting, and-or statistics (although not always required), plan to go on to graduate school, express your enthusiasm and knowledge in interviews, 'dress for success,' avoid employment agencies - you probably have better contacts than they do, and never start at a company's personnel office for a job. Commented Ms. Reville, \You need to talk to the people who have the jobs at the level you want, and they're not found in the personnel office.\ There are many kinds of jobs available: Corporate Finance, Municipal, Finance, Sales & Trading and even computer and research positions that, ac- cording to Mr. O'Connor, have become indispensable in the financial world within the past ten years. And all of these jobs can be found in Investment Banks, Commercial Banks, Venture Capital Firms, or Investment Management Firms. The Wall Street 'com- munity' lacks structure ac- cording to Mr. O'Connor and finding your niche in it can be an exhausting process, but, through researching firms and networking, the process can become much easier. Ms. Joanne Tobiessen, Director of the Career Development Center, stated, \The two alumnae demonstrated through the discussion that alumnae, in general, are very interested in helping students in their career search in any field and par- ticularly in the financial field.\ During the discussion, ar- ticles, names of successful alumnae working on Wall Street, possible interview questions, and a list of career resources available at the Schaffer Library were passed out. These, along with an outline of the discussion, may be found at the Career Development Center or at the Reserve Desk in Schaffer Library.

Cuomo Clemency Decision Questioned Continued from page 3 help I could give them through the resources available to the Attorney General. The second thing that I would do would be to establish a special unit to deal with municipal corruption. There would be a toll free nwnber to receive complaints by citizens who know of municipal corruption and are eager to report it. These complaints would then be investigated. I . would also establish a special unit to deal with toxic waste crimes. This unit would have agents and prosecutors specially trained to fight this type of crime. Currently, this does not exist, and it is now very difficult to prosecute toxic waste crimes because special skills are needed to do so ef- fectively. The Department of Environmental Conservation can help somewhat, but, because such cases present a unique prosecuting problem, prosecutors are not getting enough help now. , In addition, I would also lobby for the death penalty. I believe that there should also be legislation enacted to deal with influence peddling in the public · sector. I believe that someone who has been a state or local · employee should be barred from lobbying their former employer for at least one year after leaving their job. County pol'itical leaders should be · barred from doing business . with their home county~ I would also campaign for some in- · telligent and responsible campaign financing reform. I . find it outrageous that our current Attorney General, Robert Abrams, and Governor Cuomo can raise millions for their campaigns while still in office. This invited impropriety, · and it creates a bad public image. I cannot fault the governor and other elected officials in New York for following past practices in raising campaign · funds. However, I believe that the time to change this is now. Free Delivery Thursdays 7:00p.m. Order by 6 p.m. Pints $3.00 - Quarts $4.00 355-3131 .. ·.·.· ... ·'··· .

Professor Jonas of the history department said, \I don't see it as a conflict of interests from Union's point of view. However, I don't think that lt is a par- ticularly good idea from Skidmore's point of view due to the nature of the proximity of the two schools. It seems to be a kind of 'interlocking direc- torates' among c«Jlleges. If a controversial vote came up before the Boaro, he could always not vote if Union's in- terests were involved.\ \I think that it is perfectly appropriate for someone of his stature to serve in that position,\ economics Professor Reynolds said. \It is additional evidence of his plllticipation in the larger community of higher education in the Northeast.\ Chemistry Professor Sowa commented, \He's an educator who knows what's going on and can be a significant member ·Of their Board. It is a fine recognition of talent on their part. I don't see this as a con- flict of interests because there really isn't that much com- petition between the two schools.\ Professor Thomas thought that the .move was \very con- venient for Skidmore to get an educator on the Board.

That the elected member to the Academic Affairs CoWlcil be considered a 01ember of the Executive Board of the Student Forum.

The title may provide a doorway to the administration for· the Academic Affairs Representative, who as a Vice- President will be. included in any Executive. Board Meeting. Added article (Article IV., Section 6) The Vice President for Academics of the SGA shall be elected by all four classes. The term of office for the Vice President of Academics shall be one year. The principal responsibility of the Vice President of Academics of the SGA shall be to serve con- currently as an active member on the Academic Affairs CoWltil, report to the Student Forum on the activities of the Council, and serve as an active liaison between the Forum and the Council.

CONCORDI£NSIS, May22, 1986 Page5 * ELECTION STATEMENTS * Forum President Chip c_~nnan Cannan The Student Filrum is an institution that is suppos~d to involve, repr('sent, and listen to the stude~ts of Union College .. I believe that role has not been satisfied. Why?! The Student Farum has a considerable amount ·Of power over Uniiln students. Unfortunately, this power has not been controlled by the members of the Student Forum, it bas been maniJlulated by the administration for its ends, with the consent of many of the Forum members. This has occured because of general student apathy and com- placency amongst Forum members. newsletters. If the Forum was to make public the concerns and issues facing the Student Government, students could voice their opinions and make informed decisions on issues effecting them. This would encourage students to speak out, attend Forurtl meetings, and take part in the decision making process. council on C.urriculum. Faced with the two con- struction projects occuring on campus, the new 21-year-old drinking age, the reduction in faculty course load, the proposed new curriculum, and several other changes this year, I have had an opportunity to prove my ability as an effective liaison between the students and administration. Some of my more important ac- complishlnents include the following. I have worked with the Administration to: (1) ensure Union did not become a \dry\ campus (2) form the · 21 Club wher~ . alcohol is still sold, (3) approve the purchase of group mem- berships for Union Students at Schenautilus, the JCC, or Schenectady Racquet Club for use of thletic facilities in ad· dition to the YMCA, (4) offer a free aerobics class which previously cost $20 per term, (5) .purchase a new student activities van paid for entirely by the administration and (6) approve the hiring of several new adjunct professors in response to faculty course load reduction in order to maintain .small class size. This past winter term I also formed the Social Alternatives Com- mittee to establish and sponsor new social activities on campus. figurehead of student govern- ment, a body which does little to meEt the needs of the students; one needs only to recall previou.s arguments · pr()pounded by Jason Green to fully surrnnarize these con- tentions~ .. 'I'he· school is presently un- dergoing quite a few serious . alterations which have very noticably affected student life · here at Union. These effects have generally been described · · as '\adverse\ at best by the majority ofthe student body. To successfully get through these changing times will require strong student leadership-the type of leadership which I can provide. . Presently I serve as a Junior Representative to the Student F()rwn, I hold a position on the Student Affairs Council, I am involv~d in Concert Committee an.d WRUC, and have held positions in the past which in-· elude Arts Editor of the Idealist, · Arts Editor of the Union La!Ilpoon, Circle K, and President of the South College Dorm Council. Wllen I decided- to run for office last year, it was because I felt that something needed to be dDne; I envisioned the iirt- :ntinent changes that would soon be upon us and the adverse effeds which would certainly accompany them. I chose to · b.ec()me a Student Forum representative to get something done for the students, to further the position of the student body with respect to the ad- ministration. It seems that the administration has taken a position in the past where it feels that it can do anything it wants regardless of student opinion. In addition to this, there have been certain <~representatives\ who have done little else than uphold the position of the administration, even going so far as to vociferously support unpopular policies in the Student Forum. This is not the kil1d of \representation\ that the students want. Under my guidance, the Forum will represent the wishes of the students, not those elements which tend to function in a manner contrary to that. As I have stated in the past, I am not one to roll over for the whims of ()thers (the qulms of others is yet a different matter, however). I shall do my best to represent and act upon the wishes of tbe students. I shall develop and maintain positive relations which have genuine feedback between the Forum and the student body. Finally, if elected, I shall be a conspicuous leader who helps the Forum to realize its fullest potential, not someone who merely shows his face and shakes hands during election week of Spring Term. Apathy of any kind is a social disease (detrimental to society) that .spreads geometrically. However, all . diseases are caused by a virus. The_ virus that Union students suffer.from is the inadequacy of the Student Forum to represent their needs and stimulate them. There is also a need for in- creased interaction with the administration and the faculty. This could be achieved by employing both of these two ideas. First, it would be made each Forum member's responsibftity to meet with an admini$trator and-or faculty member to discuss pertinent issues and then together go to a dormitory or Greek house to infonn students and obtain feedback from the student body. These general feelings .and ideas could then be presented at the Forum meetings. This would greatly increase the amount of student input . on decisjons. Also, as a student who ·helped initiate and plan the State of the :Union Address, I have realized its importance and potential and would like to see ittake place once a tenn. By doing this, any student could address a panel of any of the following: Forum members; Dean of Stu-dents; Vice Presidents of Academics and Finance and President Morris on a regular, forn:ial basis. Although I believe the Forum has been effective this year, I do believe the Forwn has its share r------------------------ of weaknesses. In order to This leaves only the Student Forum and its members to blame. Many of its members have long been involved in student governments since high school. Their attitudes, ideas, and practices are set and predictable. The administration has used this predictability to push policies (i.e. Gel-time) onto the student population with little opposition. This must change. I feel I am the fresh new mind, and leader to bring about this· change. The only promise I can make is that I will not allow the Student Forum to perform as it has in the past. My op- position is the past, our strength is the future. I would like to close this statement by reminding everyone to vote and vote responsibly, because the future is yours, and the past may haunt you. Kelfy·Larkin Larkin What is the Student Forum'? When asked thiS question by two senior::;, I realized there was a· need to revitalize the image and function of the Student Forwn. Besides Col'Q.pleting the weekly functions anq. required busy work, the'. Fo-rum has the potential, with student backing, to make an impact On and sway administrative decisions. I have outlined below·several ideas that I feel should be im- plemented next year in an ·at- tempt to arouse student in- terest, and Forum ef- fectiveness. There is a need to increase student awareness of important issues and to inform students of opportunities for interaction ·with administrators and faculty through available media such as the Con• cordiensls, WRUC, the· Chronicle and mass-mailing of There- Is also a need to revitalize the Forum's role in the Independent Student Coalition which promotes the welfare of independent colleges in state politics. Independent colleges can effect financial aid by influencing TAP Parity, and TAP Equity bills and can help to push or block legislative actions effecting independent colleges. It is important to realize that our student government does not end on our campus. In closing, I would. like to use this opportunity to thank you for taking the time to listen to my campaign speeches · and to peruse these elections statements. You have a responsibility and privilege as a Union student to be informed of campus politics and elections. Again, I thank you for being responsible and concerned. This past week, 1 have asked you to vote for me, as I feel I am best qualified for the position of Student For:urn President. Today, however, I ask that you weigh the candidates and their statements in your mind, and simply remember to get out tomorrow, Friday, May 23rd, and exercize your right to vote. Steven Moss address these weaknesses I have issued my five-point plan for next year, which includes:· (1) increasmg communication with the Student Body by sending FORUM represen- tativesto dorms, (2) increasing communication with the Administration through more informal meetings, (3) in- creasing effectiveness of . student leadership by holding meetings with new Forum- appointed committee members and members of the A<Jministration early fall tenn, ( 4) publishing a Forum hand- book to inform Forum members of their responsibilities and of proper bureaucratic processes, and (5) publicizing Student Forum activities and proceedings working along with Concordiensis. During the past three years, I have implemented several new policies and procedural changes in the Student Forum bylaws. I am running for President because I want to complete the changes I have begun to initiate. With your support, we can then . make the Student Forum a more vital aspect of our life at Union.

Because of the distance involved and my inability to respond right away, I'd like to share with you sorne of my thoughts on the problems on campus and possible . solutions to them. While · changes have taken place at Union, students abroad have been kept in the dark about them. Payment of their activities fee doesn't even entitle them to a ten week subscription to Con .. c~rdy. I find this practice to be reprehensible, and as a student v11 the Sapan term, this last fall, I . to() felt the isolation from Union. ()n the forum I will work to strike down this practice, and endeavor · to include all students in the events and debates that shape .and effect our community. One of my goals is to make the Skellar a . center for student ac- tivity. I fail to understand why, With a tuition bill of nearly 15,000 dollars a year, the administration should charge students f()r pin- ban and video machines, and even for the jukebox, when they can afford to construct (and then remove) that raw iron fence in the skellar. Friends things should Change l I want to see, and intend to fight for a pool tabJe, a ping.pong table, and the return of the foosball machine, and the removal of the quarter slots in the pinball 'machines and jukebox. Add to tbat free popcorn and soda, and I tllink we can bring life to the skellar once again. Our tuition has alregdy paid for it, our budget can afford it, we deserve it-and we should be diligent in pursuing it. Furthermore, ice and snow must be removed promptly, and the roads on campus are badly in need of repair, we need an elegant fence to replace the barb wire along Seward Place, and the hours available at campus athletic facilities need to be expanded. Union is a place where if we paid a little attention to the details we could make a world of difference. As a small com- munity we can work to improve life on campus, before these issues become claims and grievances. Were there no problems on our campus, there would be little need for the student forum, yet the need remains. Solutions can come about Only if there are people who are willing to speak, and willing to work hard to be heard. This is our school and we have both a right and duty to shape to our needs. As the Chairman of the Committee on Committees I will insist that those meetings be productive, and that we channel the energy and enthusiasm of club leaders and forum members to make student life better. 1 believe the key to student government is the inclusion of energetic, informed and con- cerned people, because it is these people that make tbe process work. Each of us has a chance to be involved, during the election, to speak up now for change and a better student atmosphere, rather than waiting to see what crisis cooks up. I would ask every student to vote, and to cast their vote for me. ·vote Tomorrow! Library Plaza Be There! . . ... \ .. ~ ... .. .. . ... . ...

Because of my campus involvement· these past two years, I feel that I am well qualified for this position. the discontent is recognized and talked about in a constructive way it is possible to find a solution that benefits everyone. Vice President - Finance The office itseff is a two year position. The Junior Trustee is responsible for insuring that the student's views, concerns, and suggestions are expressed to and incorporated by the members of the Board of Trustees. In addition, the Junior Trustee is to fully inform the student body of the policies discussed and/ or acted on by the board. This position is an ex- tremely important one and I take it very seriously. Three words should come to mind when you are debating your voting decision; awareness, concern, and ac· cessibility. Is a candidate aware of the students' views and of how to use the Trustee position most effectively in presenting these views, is a candidate concerned about student life and involvement and effective in pointing out these aspects to administrators, The activities with which I have been involved .are Gatesman, the Residence Life Committee, news writer for Concordiensis, Newman Club, Dorm Council, and Student Host, among others. Next year I will continue to be involved in most of these activities, as well as being an R.A. My participation in these various organizations has allowed me to become familiar with many aspects of life at Union. While writing articles for Concordy I have researched topics such as Gel-Time , Admissions policies, the Student Forum, and the Advising system, to name a few. As a member of the Residence Life Committee this past year, I have worked with the Administration and have As Vice President for Administration I will be chair- person of the Committee on Gommittees. I believe this Committee is very important because the CoC oversees all student activities to make sure they are running smoothly. The only way for the CoC to work effectively, is to have good communication between the CoC and the activities themselves.

Senior Representative . DaveBiee Blee You are faced with a very important decision tomorrow. Your vote will determine who will represent you on the Student Forum. I am running for Senior Rep. for several reasons. The most important one is that I want the · Forum . to be an institution, where your opinion counts. The Student Forum, as it stands now, is a tool of the ad;. ministration. The Forum ap- pears to do little more than mimic the opinion expressed by the administration. This is a situation that needs to be changed, and I'm willing to work to change it. I have been involved in many different activities since en- tering Union. As Chairman of Speakers Forum, I've tried to improve life at Union both socially and academically. Since holding this position, I have helped bring Robert Klein, David Steinberg, Phyllis Schlaffely and others, including Steven Wright for Camp- Union, to Union. I have worked for tlle im~ provement of our college years in the past, and wish to cmtinue doing so in the future; Help give me that chance to work for you by lending me your support tomorrow. Elect Dave Blee, for Senior Rep., I'm willing to work for you! Jennifer Glick Glick Are you concerned with the increasing . disconte.nt of the student body? How about the growing feeling of apathy on campus? If so, it is time for a change, beginning with the Student Forum. The time has come to address the unan- swered questions tbat con- tinually appear in the Editorial section of Concordy and the complaints that are casually voiced on campus. This is what has inspired me to run for Senior Representative. Vote for· the person willing to represent · the needs of the class of '87, Jennifer Glick. Dan Gordon Gordon The qest reason I can give to explain why I'm running is by asking the question, \What is the student forum and what can it do?~' In my opinion, the student forum is arl' essential link betweentbe Administration and students. The role of the senior representative is to represent to the best of his or her abilities the opinions of the student body-senior class. Student's problems are sometimes not heard or are heard by the wrong people. Our gripes are not as · significant as many real world problems. All one has to do is take a walk down State Street past Wonderburger to figure that out. But, that does not necessarily mean we should not look at them at face value. Social activities will be an important aspect of Senior Life in the upcoming year. As a representative, I would stress . this and see that our class money is spent on worthwhile social activities. It would be hoped that these activities could help maintain close contacts and keep the class unified. Concerning my qualifications for this position, I have been actively involved in numerous campus activities including the crew team, president of the psychology club, dorm council representative and fraternity social chairman. -These positions have given me various leadership skills as well as the diverse background necessary for the position of senior representative. I hope that students vote conscientiously for a senior representative who cares and will.give a great deal • of time and energy to the concerns of the student body. Don't Forget WRUC Tonight 8:00 f I •, .! -. •' J ~ I j ', Lisa Kaplan Junior Renresentative Kaplan Are you bored? Tired of the construction? Looking for something new? Well, my name • is Lisa Kaplan and yes, I am running for Senior Represen- tative to the Student Forum. Although I do not currently hold an elected office to the Forum due to my term in Bath this past fall, our sophomore year, I was secretary to the Student Forum. During my term in office I was able to observe the intricacies of the Student Forum as a non- voting member. In addition to this unique experience I can bring to the office of Senior Representative many new ideas and can successfully i.J:nplement your ideas. As co-editor of the ·Freshman Record and a member of the Orientation Committee I have had vast experience in bring about my . ideas as well as ideas of others. I honestly feel that I have the unique blend of experience and ingenuity required for success as Senior Representative for the class of 1987. I hope you think so too! So, \KAP\ your Union ex- perience off with a fantastic year and vote LISA KAPLAN for Senior Representative on Friday, May 23. JohnZuk Zuk I am anxious to be able to serve as a Senior representative to the Student Forwn. I know that my participation in various campus ~ctivities over the past three years will contribute to help make our last terms here at Union the best ever. The opening of the Alumni Gym and our nezw student center will provide a variety of new social activities. Katherine Ide Ide I believe that Union has the potential to become a great . place to live, .learn, and enj()y life. All year I have been listening to complaints about how bad ibe Skellar has gotten or what the library should have, along with everything else that Union doesn't have. Well, the only way that anything is going to get any better is if we stop complaining and take action to make these situations improve. This transformation can only take place with the co-operation of both the students and the administration. This is why I decided to run for Junior Class Representative. I feel I would be an asset to the Forum because 1 have a clear un- derstanding of how the Administration works and feel that I will be able to accomplish many things for the student and with approval of the Administration. I am a responsible, level-headed, and innovative person which I believe is necessary to doing the best possible job for this position. I can't promise to bring back beer on campus or that the construction will be completed early but I can promise that I will do the best that I know how to hear the voices of our class and help get the changes made to make Union to be the Best that it can be. Remember to vote on Friday, even if you don't vote for me-don't complain later about how poor the Student Government is unless you had a say in electing it. Apathy is the No; 1 killer of good Campus life! GeriLynn Mackey As the Co-chair of the newly formed Social Alternatives cOriunittee, I am well aware of the proper steps which must be taken in planning and im- plementing any campus ac- tivity. This position has also allowed me to become familiar with many of the students and faculty whose decisions may have an impact on our class. This experience has helped me to better comprehend the real workings of the college. I honestly feel that I am well acquainted with most of you, and will strive to clearly reflect your views and opinions before the Forum and the Administration. As a Gatesman and Orientation Committee member, I have been acquainted with many aspects · of the social and academic climates here at Union, and am confident that these, too, will combine to strengthen my role as a Senior representative. I strongly urge all students to take part in this year's elections ... and when you do, please vote for me, John Zuk, as one of your Senior repres.entatives. Thanks. Mackey I feel that my reasons for running for. Junior Represen- tative are different than most. In short, I am running because I would enjoy all of the aspects of the job. Organizing and working with people are two such 1 aspects. My outgoing per- sonality and enthusiasm are two qualities that would aid in . my representation of the class. The leadership positions I have held, such as head student at Hale House and Seeretary of Dorm Council, will assist in my understanding of the job. As Jenior Rep, I would remain enthusiastic and energetic , throughout the year. Thank you for yout support. **** VOTE **** Jean Matus Matus As I was collecting signatirres of my fellow classmates, I encountered many inquiries such as, 'What does a Representative do anyhow?' I think that an important part of representing a group of people is to make yourself and your purpose known. My name is Jean Matus and as your Jen1or Rep I intend to commun:icate with as many of you as possible and help you to voice your opinions in the Formn. Union is experiencing some instability. Between the con' struction, rising tuition and new drinking policy, I have heard many complaints and suggestions that should be considered. I've had much experience in Student Government and will use it to be an effective member of the Student Forum. I held four class offices in High School, including Senior Class President. Here at Union, I was secretary of Richmond's Dorm Council '84-'85. I know the ins and outs of political meetings · and how to be heard in an ef- fective and efficient manner. I will make the office of Junior Representative known. I will not be someone who is elected and passively attends a few meetings. Representing your opinions and presenting them in an assertive manner is my task. I am willing to accept. Jennifer Scully Scully Hello, my name is Jennifer Scully and as you have probably figured out by now, I am run- ning for junior representative to the Student Forum, and yes I want your vote! With all of the new changes currently taking place at Union, changes that have directly affected us, the students; there has been a renewed interest in student- administrative affairs. For so many years in the past it has seemed as if students have been content to just sit back and let the Administration make all of the decisions. This is no longer true, a fact made very clear by the large attendance shown by the students at the recent \State of the Union\ address sponsored by the Concordiensis. It was a very strong showing, and a great pleasure to see. Old Chapel was filled to standing room only by well informed, concerned students demanding answers to the questions that have gone unanswered for so long. Questions on Gel-time, reduction of faculty course loads, Union investments in South Africa and increases in tuition. The evening ended not because all of the students' Continued on page 8

After that evening it has become clear that the time to ask questions has just begun. The representatives of the Administrati()n who were present that night left with a renewed sense of increasing student interest, that the students of this school are aware of what is going on around them and that in the future our input is going to be greater than in the past. I am rU11Iling for junior rep because I would like to 1Je an active part of that future voice. Well in- formed, dependable, deman- ding and inqllisitive are the qualities I feel I have to con- tribute. I encourage you to support your student leaders and reinforcE this new student spirit.

I will try to eliminate the bureaucratic hassles and imD plement a policy which is reflective of the opinions of the student body. I feel that a college shotlld gain its power from tbe students who attend it and, therefore, it should be the students who shape the policies which affect them. Liz Tremante Tremante I don't have promises to make but I do see problems that can be solved. I'm sick of hearing complaints about how \boring\ or \beat\ it is around here. I realize attitudes can't be changed overnight, but it is possible t() make people aware of opportunities and our abilitY to change the things we don't like, if we can just get motivated.

Marin Those who know me are probably wondering why I am running for Alunmi Council Rep considering I've spent much of the last four years complaining about why I dislike Union and saying how anxious I am to leav:e. I am wondering, too. But then I've also spent much of the last four years trying to do something about solving some of the problems that have faced the student body at Union. Last year, along with others on the Student Forum, I helped to extend the Skellar hours. I also was the major organizer of tbe committee that successfully amended the College's decision to ban outdoor par.ties last spring. This year, as news editor of Concordiensis, l've tried to revitalize the news section and create an atmosphere that would keep pressure on the Administration to keep an ear to the voice of the students. ln the past few years I've had the opportunity to work both with and against the Administration. I usually prefer to work with it and have found that much can be accomplished in that way. And so the reason I am running for ·Alumni Council Representative is that even though we will be gone, tht:l things we have worked for and the inconveniences and troubles we have suffered will not .be forgotten by the College as we walk off the stage, diplomas in hand. Chris O'Donnell I am very pleased to have the opportunity to run for the position of Alumni Council · Representative for the Class of 198fi. I consider this a chance for me to stay in close contact with Union College and my classmates. I have been involved with . many aspects of college life since I came to Unicm, primarily through my role as R.A. and H.R.A., but also from the soc;ial activities and sports Poskanzer Every Spring the Seniol.\ Class elects two class representatives to the Alumni Council of Union College.

In those years, I have worked closely with the Alumni Office, and I feel I have gained the experience necessary to properly represent our class. And, that's exactly what I in- tend to do if elected. So please vote for me, Usa Poskanz.el.\ for Alumni Council Representative. Anthony Valente Valente To the clas of '86: Why is Anthony Valente running for_ alumni council representative? The reason is I feel the class of '86 is a strong class that has seen many changes and would like to see Union grow in the future with the spirit of '86! Now that it is time to graduate, the two new facilities will be ready by Spring. '87. So for those Alumni staying in the area will be abie to use it. However, those who will be working and studying oat of the area will have no idea w)i~t the two new facilities offer ·when ·they return. This is what I hope to· accomplish, keeping alumni posted on what is going ~n here at Union. Then there is the problem of trying to keep track of our fellow classmates. I feel trying to keep in contact with classmates who we shared the good days as well as the bad. The real world will keep us very bpsy, so keeping in contact will be tough. This is where I- hope to he~p. Finally, different thinlting on events, reunions and keeping in contact with our .fellow classmates. This is what I have to offer. - ~-= _-::,.;-_

After .six years -of Attention all Seniors without jobs! Now that all of you are reading, read this-The Almanac Of American Employers. This newly published book \rates and ranks a total of five hundred top firms that offer job op- portunities for graduates\ states the author Jack Plunkett. The almanac is a culmination of three years of researching 1,500 companies and reducing the group to the top 500. that were profitable in the last two years. The dif- ference between this book and others on the market is the fact that Plunkett concentrated on ranking specific information that is ''indispensible in selecting a· company to work for,\ such as salaries, benefits, profit sharing and pension plans. Through the almanac you worrisome seniors, anxious juniors, and throaty sophomores can learn about a company's future with relatively no business background. The purpose of the book is to help the reader decide which company offers the best working environment. Perhaps this may appear superfluous to the budding entrepreneur of Union College, but Plunkett's inspiration for the book ought to catch a few customers, as he states he \was disturbed by the experiences of close friends who spent decades working for large corporations only to be laid off or forced into early retirement. I conceived of this book as a way to give job-seekers a chance to understand the stability and policies of a prospective employer before they invest their careers with a firm.\ The almanac also includes information concerning the everyday life at each company.

Plunkett was her responsibilities and retire. surprised tofmd out that the top employers were not dominated by high tech industry. What are the top rated companies? Todd Shipyards Corp. ranks number one, followed by Lockheed, SmithKline Beckman Corp., Tandy Corp., and IBM Corp. The sharp reader interested in a top life style will start packing, as Plunkett notes the companies offering the .most generous fringe benefits are located in the South and West Coast. Those without hope do not despair- \There are many good entry level job opportunities. It is not hard to get on and eventually benefit from profit-sharing and pension plans,'' states Plunkett. \All you need is just two legs and be willing to work, so why not start, get· on with the right company?'' So, all you non-employed spring term seniors who are basking in the sun, get in the car and hop on over to the bookstore and pick up a copy of the almanac for $15.95 and brush up on the real world! Unless, of course, the trust fund around the corner can get you a gold card. Seven Days Till Distordiensis Anne- Baldasare joined the food services staff in March of 1980. At that time, She accepted a position as a part time worker. Four days later, she became a full time employee at Union. Union College is not the . first experience Mrs. Baldasare has had WC)rking with food. Prior to working at the Pub in Carnegie and then in Hale House, she used to work at McDonald's. Previous em- ployment also includes the position of medical secretary which Mrs. Balde,sare worked at for tweniy years. She also worked for Eisenhower during Anne Baldasare decided that it was time to retire and do something for her own pleasure; When asked how she will spend her time after rEtirement, Mrs. Baldasare humoursly replied, \nothing.\ In a more serious manner, she continued to ex- plain her plans of moving to a home in Cape Cod. At this The work with which Anne Baldasare is kept busy here at Union is just a minor sector in her interesting past. She compares ber retirement w_ith the dropping of a pebble. in the water. \At first there will be waves, but soon everything will calm and return as they used to be.\ Mrs. Baldasare wishes everyone at Union best of luck and good ·health. She believes that luck and health are the two factors which are sufficient for happiness. Union College would like to reciprocate Mrs. Baldasare's kind wishes and thank hei\ for her years of service.

These and otner students w~tched besHaid plans f~r a summer abroad disappear this week in the fearful aftermath of tile bombing of Libya. 'Mille students themselves .say they're willing to brave the terrorist reprisals expected against Americans traveling and studying abroad, ad- ministrators have begun cC!Ilceling many foreign study programs to protect the stlldents from risk. \I didn't want·to worry the wllole time,\ says Yale Glee Club director Fenno Heath, who canceled the Yale tour the day after the U.S. air strikes. Likewise, the U.S. Gym- nastics Federation called off a trip to meetAlgerian gymnasts '\for safety reasons-,\ says Sllaron Schmidt, director of the St11dy Abroad program at St. J()hn's University in Minnesota.

I have to wonder, do we want to be social outcasts?\ Last school term, Korso traveled to Italy, arriving in the Rome airport the day after three other Union students were wounded in the massacre at the El Al airline ticket counter. One of those students con- tinued on to his Study Abroad term in Jerusalem after , surgeons re01oved shrapnel from his legs. The other two came home.

Her school canceled both its traditional summer tour of the foreign fashion industry and an African safari. \l3ut I could get hit by a car right here in the States,\ Bowlin, a senior, says. Even so, she concedes, her parents convinced her to cancel plans to attend Prince Andrew's wed~ ding and a Dallas Cowboys exhibition game in England. Many now consider such crowded events too risky, especially when many Amerlcans are present. \They ask me, 'If people find out I'm an American, what are they going to do?'\ ''Itell them that I was treated (!ordially wherever I went,'a Korso .says. \I made a lot of friends. My worst concern is that Americans just don't un- derstand what's going on over there. I think we need more consideration of Europeans and how they feel.\ . other programs have adopted new precautions. \We've arranged for students to travel in smaller groups,\ says Lynn Sanborn of the American Field Service, which plans to continue its 39-year-old foreign study program in 70 coWltries this year. \We're rerouting to avoid Athens and Rome airports, and in. some cases, we've arranged for students to deboard planes out on the air field and get onto a bus there rather than come into the airport,\ Sanborn says.

Drew Dougherty, Education Abroad Program director at the University of Madrid, recently gave U.S. students in Spain a list of precautions. \Avoid conspicuous places where (terrorist) attempts could· occur,\ Dou.gherty advised, listing places like ''the (military) base in Torrejon, discotheques favored by U.S. citizens, restaurants known for their American clientele, the airport, the U.S. Embassy, etc.\ \They've learned to speak the language, and they live with local families, and so they don't stand out.\ Hayden Carruth: internationally known poet speaks at \,)nion. other programs are trying to caution students without discouraging their participation in cultural exchanges. William MacCormick of Cal-Berkeley says sensitivity to European customs and feelings will help students feel safe and welcome. \Certainly don't go into the cathedral of Notre Dame in your Adidas running shoes on .a Sunday inorning,'' he says. Most foreign-exchange ad- vocates seem determined to keep their programs afloat through the crisis. \We need future am- bassadors and business executives who aren't afraid to go to Third World countries,\ MacCormick says. \Short of students being in , towns under bombardment, these (exchange programs) are acceptable risks, as I feel we need to do our part in-international relations.'' Expressiveness in Poetry and Jazz While many first-time ex- change students confess to Korso, now a veteran traveler, that they have the jitters, she gives them the same adviCe as MacCormick. \I sincerely hope we continue to have (foreign) programs,\ Korso concludes. \If we allow this to stop us, what won't?\ - The Jewish Student Union Will Have Its Annual ''Picnic In Jackson's Gardens'' May 271986 Between 2:00-6:00 P.M. There Will Be Free Food, Games and Music By LEE ANN SCHMIDT Last Monday, Hayden Carruth, world renowned poet and critic, gave a talk entitled \Expressiveness in Poetry and Jazz\. Carruth began his well- attended talk by addressing the question of why certain pieces of poetry or music are effective in their expression. According to Carruth there are two types of response to expression, sensual and conceptual. Of these two responses Carruth seemed to believe that sensual is the truest form of expression. This expression involves a mysterious communication between the creator and the person who experlences their work. If we were intelligent enough we could discover the connection behind this . \mystery\. One could analyze the pieces, ihus, uncover their unique successful qualities. Carruth pointed out, now ever, that by d()i!li this we would destroy the spontaneity of our emotional and sensual en- joyment of these works. Music, for Carruth, more accurately brings out the sensual response from ex- pression. Poetry, however, involves a more conceptual Wlderstanding of expression. Only great poets are able to bring a sensual understanding to their poetry.

When this happens poetry loses its purpose and prose becomes a more effective form of con- ceptual expression. By playing several pieces of blues jazz Carruth portrayed what sensual experience in music involves. The first piece was by Billy Holliday. It was recorded during the later part of her life. The theme of this easygoing was traditional blues love. Carruth pointed out a distinctive sensual expression of soWld at the end of this piece. In the past when Carruth gave this talk he asked the audience to describe this \moan\. They attempted to give it a definable emotional significance through literary terms. Few are willing to believe it was merely a soWld. The second piece was by Joe Turner. Like Billy Holliday's song, the spoken. words are of secondary im- portance in experiencing this piece's meaning. Joe Turner begins this song with a spon- taneous yell. Hayden interprets this noise, and the ending moan in Billy Holliday's piece, as being purely a physical ex- perience which releases energy created by the tension from the sensuality of the music. Carruth also gave examples of great works of poetry which developed sensual experience from expre~sion. such ~s Milton's \Paradise Lost\. This work operates on the sensual nerves as well as the conceptual mind. Pages where the language is practically unin- telligable are effective because they are sensual. Tile text of the work is not as important as what lies behind it, the emotions it develops in the reader through sensual experience. Although I did not agree with Carruth concerning his belief that music . is the primary source in which sensual ex- pression is most effective, I enjoyed his talk. It raised many interesting issues, and opened my mind to yet another aspect of expression.

Idol Talk· Fitzhugh Ludlow Day this year honors Reverend Dr. John Marshall Willoughby Farnham, the man who gave the Idol to Union. It seems timely, then, to bring to light a subject for concern: treatment of the Idol For many years, the Idol has been a symbol of student freedom. It has existed as a medium of expression, a place to \destroy\ school property in a nonthreatening way.A sort of positive vandalism, one might call it. The Idol has sustained physical injury over the years. But, more importantly, the Idol has lived to see generations of Union students. It has endured the good times and the bad. It has survived the ups and the downs of college life and has come to represent that thing which students can truly call their own. The Idol, although it is the property of the College, belongs to the students. With these sentiments in mind, it is unfortunate to have to bring up the subject of misuse of this time- honored vestige of Union life. Just this past week, the triumph of one fraternity's initiation was celebrated by pamting the Idol. This is proper treatment; that is why we paint it. However, topping this coat of paint was one which contained vulgar language written in a fraternity's colors that did not do the painting. . Other times, the Idol has been the medium by which to express feeling~ of anti-semitism. Tbis is wholly inappropriate and distasteful and also abuses the spirit of the ld()l. Tomorrow we honor the Idol's arrival to our campus. It has been a part of Union for longer than our grandparents have been alive. It deserves our respect of its place in Union's long history. After all, can you imagine a Union without the Idol? - The Summer Solstice is only one · month away. lsn 't it time the h(!at· was turned off in Shaffer Library? What constitutes a critical mass? No one knows. But anyone can observe the stan- dard of good practice at other colleges and universities. Faculty devoted to teaching courses in the classics, English, modern languages and literatures, and philosophy typically compose 30 percent of the whole body of faculty at an American college or university. At institutions that also include a division of engineering the percentage naturally drops a bit. For example, Bucknell allocates 25 percent of its All Letters to the Editor must be typed doubleospaced and submitted by 4 p.m. each Tuesday bef.ore publication: All. letters must be signed by no more than four people and all writers should provide their addresses and phone numbers for verification of the letter .. Names normally will not be withheld. Concordiensis reserves the right to reiect letters that are libelous or do not conform to standards of good taste~ faculty to these disciplines and Lafayette 23 percent. But no coU(lg~ anywhere purporting to offer a liberal education commits as small a pe.rcentage of its faculty to these humanistic disciplines as Union c:Ioes-only 17 percent. What if Union were only a liberal arts college of 1500 stUdents without its 500 engineering majors and its 27 engineering faculty members? The percent of faculty in the word-disciplines woUld grow to about ·21 percent, still placing Union flatly at the bottom of any list of American colleges one . might wish to compile. The fact of the matter is that Union's commitment of resources to the teaching of the humanities is most directly comparable to that of in· stitutions that do not pretend to offer liberal studies at all: technical colleges like Clarkson and Lehigh. If we want to continue to tell the world we .are an excellent liberal arts college with engineering, we eventually have to put Qur money where our mouth is. And that simply means new and relatively massive support by the ad- ministration for the logocentric disciplines at the heart of liberal education. Of course it also means a new liberal learning requirement with the kind of humanities emphasis .. that sends prospective students the signal that Union is to be taken. seriously as a cQngenial setting for subjects other than engineering, the natural sciences, economics, and political science. If we wait to have the students before we · build a program that sends out such signals, we will have to wait ·forever. Rightly ot wrongly, too many alre~dy reg·ard Union as a fancy vocational school. Perbaps that is what we want . to! be, hilt 1 rather doubt it. In any ease7 it is what we wouldtend to become if our administration simply allowed a process of curricular laissez faire to fulfill itself. It wastheCollege's academic administration I had in mind when I made that reference to educational leadersh:ip. The Union Faculty has a long tradition of not being able to lead itself very well-or being very easy to lead-in matters of curricular reform. 1 suppose it has to do with our being rather more disparate than other small faculties. Our heterogeneity seems to be both our glory and our nemesis. At most other colleges the curricular vectOI'S potnt cen- tripetally; the members 9£ the faculty will be somewhat :more likely than at Union to share a common s.ense of· educational purpose.

Page 12 <lll1tt0lfbirnsis Fourukr/ 1.11 limon CollqJ~ /877 ------------ ----------- Vote Against Apartheid The Union College community was recently in- formed that the Board of Trustees has failed to present its proposal regarding its investments in companies with holdings in South Africa. It seems as if the committee that was designed for the .purpose of reviewing the investments has been taking its time on the issue to \iron out the details of its proposals.\ In addition, as was reported earlier, the lack of in- volvement on the part of students and faculty members has certainly not expedited the process of the Board's decision. Due to this lack of interest on the part of the campus community, and realizing that limiting our en- dowment investments from companies that have holdings in South Africa will have some effect on our returns, Concordiensis would like to reconunend that the Board of Trustees limit their investments to those companies in a way that will not seriously affect the returns on our endowment, but will serve as a sym- bolic gesture that will show that the Union community will simply not tolerate the abuses of the South Mrican regime. It is a known fact that if Union limits its in- vestments~ the South A,frican regime won't suddenly change its evil ways. However, since the students and faculty members haven't given support towards denouncing the abuses of the South African govern~ ment, maybe it is time for the members of the Board of Trustees to take things into their own hands and make a move that will prove that they are men and women of integrity. As the moments begin to wane on this decision, let us remember that a vote for this regime is a vote against the rights of humanity that all of us at Union stand for.

CONCORDIENSIS, May 22, 1986 LETTERS Professor States His Case To the Editors, I think Professor Reynolds was looking too hard to take offense when he responded to my statements reported in David Marin's article of May 8, \CoUege Considers Faculty Distribution,\ with a letter printed in Concordlensls on May 15. I would like to correct Prof. Reyndds' misapprehensions and make a few important points that Mr. Marin's article omitted. First, I applied the term \lettered humanities\ not to suggest that other disciplines in the academy are unlettered but to emphasize that there is one group of disciplines within the hWllanities that are by nature specuicatly logocentric. I am thinking of philosophy, language, and literature-an pUI\suits in which the word itself is tbe object of study. These are the disciplines which have traditionally defined the core of liberal education in American colleges and universities. And, in view of the \literacy crisis\ identified by the Bennett Report and other recent national studies of higher education, they are the disciplines which no liberal arts college in pursuit of excellence can fail to em- phasize. Second, I am not advocating that the humanities be bolstered at lJnion by applying resources at the expense of other areas of the eurriculum which have their OWll legitimate needs. When I say we ought to add twenty new fac11lty positions at Union during the next seven years, I meaJl we need the twelve that are already slated for ap- plication here and there in the curriculum (including, I gather, a couple in the humanities) and then another eight to give Union a secure critical mass in the logocentric disciplines in the humanities. What constitutes a critical mass? No one knows. But any<me can observe the stan- dard of good practice at other colleges and universities. Faculty devoted to teaching courses in the classics, English, modern languages and literatures, and philosophy typically compose 30 percent of the whole body of faculty at an American college or university. At institutions that also include a division of engineering the percentage naturally drops a bit. For example, Bucknell allocates 25 percent of its All Letters to the Editor must be typed tiouble-spaced and submitted by 4 p.m. each Tuesday before p11blication. · All letters must be signed by no more than four people alild oil writers should provide their addresses a11d phone numbers for ~f!rification of the letter.

Concordiensis reserves the right to reiect letters that are lillelous or do not c:Gnform to standards oi good taste. faculty to these disciplines and Lafayette 23 percent. But no college anywhere purporting to offer a liberal education commits as small a percentage of its faculty to these humanistic disciplines as Union does-only 17 percent. What if Union were only a liberal a1ts college of 1500 students withoat its 500 engineering majors and its 27 engineering fac111ty members? The percent ()f faculty in the word~disciplines would grow to about 21 percent, still placing Union flatly at tile bottom of any list of American colleges one might wish to compile. The fact of the matter is that Union's commitment of resources to the teachmg of the humanities is most directly comparable to that of in· stitutions that do not pretend to offer liberal studies at all: technical colleges like Clarkson and Lehigh. If we want to continue to tell the world we are an excellent liberal arts college with engineering, we eventually have to put our money where our mouth is. And that simply means new and relatively massive support by the ad- ministration for the logocentric disciplines at the heart of liberal education. Of course it also means a new liberal learning requirement with the kind of humanities emphasis that sends prospective students the signal that Union is to be taken seriously as a congenial setting for subjects other tllan engineering, the natural sciences, economics, and political science. If we wait to have the students before we build a program that sends out such signals, we will have to wait forever. Rightly or wrongly, too many already regard Union as a fancy vocational school. Perhaps that is what we want . to· be, but I rather doubt it. In any case, it is what we would tend to become if our administration simply allowed a process of curricular laissez faire to fulfill itself. It was the College's academic administration I had in mind when I made that reference to educational leadership. The Union Faculty has a long tradition of not being able to lead itself very well-or being very easy to lead;_ in matters of curricular reform. I suppose it has to do with our beiNg rather more disparate than other small faculties. Our heterogeneity seems to be both our glory and our nemesis. At most other colleges the curricular vectors point cen- tripetally; the members of the faculty will be somewhat more likely than at Union to share a common sense of educational purpose. But at Union the curricular force seems to be centrifugal; we repeatedly surprise each other with the divergence of our educational views. At Union consensus can't be gathered; it has to be forged-forged by the leadership of an educational administration with a broad, clear, and liberal vision of what this Union should be.

C.ONCORDIENSJS, May 22, 1986 Page 13 LETTERS COMMENTARIES - N ott Just a Building To the Editor: In the May 8th issue of Con- cordy President Morris is quoted in the article, \Nott Memorial to Receive National Recognition,'' as haVing said in regards to the Nott that: \It is not the buildings themselves that are imp.ortant, what's important is that they represent important program develop• ments.'' Coneordy further noted that major renovations cannot be expected for another eight to ten years. I must respectfully disagree with the President's view that the Nott Memorial is just another building not worth repairing at this time. The Nott symbolizes the very essence of !this College. It epitomizes to many what cannot be expressed in words. To· many alumni and students the Nott has become the embodiment of Union's history, traditions and academic excellence. In ad- dition, this landmark reminds faculty and students of Union's very high quality. Appropriately, the N ott is located at the very heart of the campus. Although this great building may not have any pra~i~al purpose, neither does ·the Lincoln Memorial or the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. If the will exists, there are several uses,Jor the Nott. Among the possibilities are a museum and an archives. It is difficult to comprehend why Union's most symbolic landmark ·must wait eight to ten years for major renovations. In ten years it might be too late to save the Nott. It is very difficult to believe that a college which raises millions of dollars through donations cannot find the funds to repair this great structure. If there is actually no money currently available for this endeavor, why is it not possible to organize a special drive geared toward alumni to save . the Nott. It is unlikely that Union graduates would not help such a worthy cause. A lack of corporate sponsors is also difficult to imagine for such a project. · I sincerely hope that the Administration reassesses its position on the N ott Memorials. Sincerely, PaulP.

They were the Words that first welcomed millions of immigrants when they arrived in America. Most of these new immigrants could not understand English when they first arrived. However, that message gave them an irtcentive to learn how to read, write, and speak English, and to be more in- timate and comfortable with English than with their first language. Why did this message have that power? It had that power because it told every new immigrant exactly what Ameriea stood for; freedom, hope, and an opportunity for advancement for anyone wishing to come here, no matter what one bad been in one's home country. Because this message was inscribed in English, it was implied that the only way to advance economically and socially in America was to learn English, the common language of America. Unfortunately, many of our most recent immigrants have forgotten that message. Instead of learning English as quickly as possible, they have adamantly refused to do so. Vote! They have been encouraged not to learn English by govern- mental policies which facilitate this, and which have made it possible for them to go to school, receive government checks, and even to vote. Without having to learn even ()De word of English. Even their children who were born in America need not to have to know how to speak. the language ()f the country of their birth. The result of this change in attitude has been negative, These immigrants must live i1l self contained, isolated com- munities, because they cannot co!l1lllunicate with anyone who does not speak their language~ Since tlley cannot speak English, they are denied the best jobs, and only the ones requiring the fewest skills, and therefore the lowest paying jobs, are available to them. They are also at a cultural disadvantage, since American culture is based on the English language, and if one cannot understand English, then such common activities like wat- ching a movie, reading a newspaper; or listening to a song are impossible to do. Fortunately, a change may be :-:bout to take place. According to Assemblyman William Paxon of East Aurora, which is just east of Buffalo, ahnost every state has either passed or is considering legislation that would make English the official language of that state. Congress is also considering a similar bilL Paxon introduced just such a ~;ill in the New York State Assembly this year, bill number A-4262. In an interview, Paxon ex- plained that the hill would not stop anyone from speaking other languages. Nor would it mop biijpgual education in New York. The bill is not intended to discriminate against any ethnic group, such as the Hispanic community, which many non English speakers belong to. Paxon mentioned that in his home town of Buff~o, there are many Poles and Italians who· cannot speak English and who are forced to live with the problems that were detailed earlier. What this bill, and the others like it, does do is to assert the primacy of English over other languages by making it the official state language. As Paxon said, \The bill only establishes the precedent that English is the official language of New York. It does not stop anyone from speaking any other language, though it does open up the door to a discussion of other issues.\ Certainly, this is something that we can all agree with, so t~at hopefully one day soon everyone living i1l America will be able to read tbat in- scription and fulfill their potential here in America.

THE ARTS Performance at Cabaret ••• A Novelty By ILYSSE FEINGOLD Last Tbursd~y's exceedingly lengthy Cabaret, which lasted from 10:00 p.m. to 12:40 a.m., elicited the most enthusiastic audience response I have seen during a Cabaret performance. The audience far surpassed clapping, snapping, and singing but instead ten audience members danced in the wings for approximately one hour. What kind of performers could stimulate such successful feedback? This Cabaret. involved new performers such as Gail Blumenfield, and John Pollack, as well as older talent' Jeff Lawrence. This cabaret was especially successful because it bridged two performers who are accustomed to entertaining separately: Jim Havard and Jim Hassenfeld and Company. His company included vocalist Melaine Masterson, bass guitarist Craig Fowler and drummer Tim Mical with guest Jeff Winter, a guitarist. The enjoyable evening began with an act which recognized Jewish Heritage Week. M.C. Mark Webster welcomed Union's Jewish Student Union(JSU) with a playful.pun, \What's a JAP's favorite position? facing Bloomingdales.\ Artists John Pollack and Gail Blumenfeld are active members of JSU and were this evening's first act. Vocalist Gail Blumenfeld and piano accompanist John Pollack entertained us with a at the Nott ••• program of mixed. variety whicbincluded. show tunes from the Wiz and Evita to popular songs by Elton John. ·John Polla.ck is not just an out- standing accompanist who respects and supports the vocalist, but he is also a fine solo performer. Thursday we had tlle opportunity to see him in both roles. The two performers worked togetber and as a strong unit. Gail has a good vocal range which gives her the ability to successfully move from her chest voice to her head voice, an art which few ever master comi>letely. Gail has a unique · vocal quality. It is quite ef- fective in Broadway music. Gail is conscious of tonality which becomes apparent in a song from Evita, her favorite show. Alth()ugh the notes in this song are rather high, Gail handles them beautifully even though she seems to flinch with an- ticipation. Gail is an exciting performer who continuously smiles. Her radiant smile and happy disposition inspired the audience's receptiveness. John Pollack's forte is in his ability to sense rhythm. He is able to jazz up any piece by adding hesitations or slightly improvising the original music. John has a resonant tenor voice whicb he uses in combination· with his dynamic piano playing to make a perfect performance. His piano playing is quite polisll.ed but never mechanical. John's feeling for music carries over into his vocal per- fonnance. John is not subject to a vocalist's problem of swallowing end notes and consonants; he draws notes out allowing for clearer an- nunciation. One could not help but love John's personality as he pokes fun at ··the song \Come Sail Away\. He is also very quick to establish a warm and friendly relation with the audience. After all; he speaks their language when he says, ''this might stink because I don't know it too well.\ It is disap- pointing that John did not become one of Cabaret's more frequent players. Jeff Lawrence was the second act of THURSDAY'S MUSICAL REVIEW. Jeff, a guitarist and vocalist plays with a steady and powerful strum. This strum was so strong and energetic that he broke two guitar strings in one evening. This just demonstrates Jeff's 100 percent commitment to his work. Jeff plays an in- teresting musical program which includes many favorites such as Simori and Garfunkel, James Taylor, the Eagles, and the Alman Brothers. Jeff's \Unicorn Song\ evokes pan- tomime in the audience there fore gracing his program with a different style. One of Jeff's strengths is in voice projection. His voice is always heard above his guitar. Jeff's exciting program concluded with \American Pie\. He is especially entertaining during this number. Jeff is quite at- tentive of musical dynamics Take A Dark Ride By ZENDA VESTA Have you taken the tour? What, you ask, is the tour? Well, once again a brave group of travelling companions and I are ready to set out on a certain expedition that I have in mind. This journey I will call THE DARK RIDE.

This number started the dancing in the wings which did not subside untill2: 40 a.m. The last act -of Cabaret was quite professional. It featured Melanie Masterson as the vocalist. Although Melanie has not had much experience pe forming in public until her Union debut, she remains poised and elegant. Although Melanie has \never taken a voice lesson,\ she did not ap- pear as an amateur to the audience. Her favorite artist Stevie Nicks serves as a mentor to Melanie who seems to resemble Stevie's vocal quality. Melanie irnpr.essively harmonizes. She blends with both Jims• instruments as well as with the diffe11ent in- struments. Melanie's clear alto voice is powerful enough to be heard above this five-piece band. Melanie seems extremely comfortable performing; she chuckles frequently and is not at all shy in ·her audience contact. Neither Jims lack enm thusiasm. They both in- corporate dance routines into their guitar interludes. It seems amazing that they can dance without compromising their guitar playing. For the first several songs, Jim Hassenfeld even plays with a lollipop in his mouth. If this does not show his ease on stage, 1 do not see what will. The acoustics in Old Chapel do not do jUstice to this band. i3eca~e of the enclosed space, some of the subtleties were lost. This band needs no backdrop or dazzling scenery; th«:y light up the Old Chapel :with their brilliant .performance which includes music of Eric Clapton, Chicago, Fleetwood Mac and the Beatles. This band knows th.e way fo keep the crowd rocking aJJ.d they were literally doing just · that. Jim Hassenfeld replied, \there is one rule at Union College~ when people are dancing, you don't lEt them sit down.\ At this time, the audience moved in front of the stage to continue rocking, dancing, clapping, singing, and simply having fun. Tills kind of audience expression created the aura of a \rock contert\.

Page 14 CONCORDJENSIS, May 22, 19ll6 THE ARTS Performance at Cabaret ... A Novelty By IL YS.43E FEINGOLD Last Thursday's exceedingly lengthy Cabaret, which lasted from 10:00 p.m. to 12:40 a.m., elicited the most eHtlmsiastic audience response I have seen iurrng a Cabaret performance. The audience far surpassed clapping, snapping, and singing but instead ten audience members danced in tne wings for approximately one hour. Wllat kind of perfonners could stimulate such successful feedback? This Cabaret involved new performers such as Gail Blrunenfield, and John Pollack, as well as older talent Jeff Lawrence. This cabaret was especially successful because it bridged two performers who are accustomed to entertaining separately: Jim Havard and Jim Hassenfeld and Company. His company included vocalist Melaine Masterson, bass guitarist Craig Fowler and drummer Tim Mical with guest Jeff Winter, a guitarist. The enjoyable evening began with an act which recognized Jewish Heritage Week. M.C. Mark Webster welcomed Union's Jewish Student Union(JSU) with a playful pun, \What's a JAP's favorite position? facing Bloomingdales.\ Artists John Pollack and Gail Blumenfeld are active members of JSU and were this evening's first act. Vocalist Gail Blumenfeld and piano accompanist John Pollack entertained us with a at the Notf ... pr.()gram of mixed variety wrnch includeo show tunes from t.be Wiz and Evita to popular so11gs by Elton John. John P()llack is not just an out- standing accompanist who respects and supports the vocalist, but he is also a fine solo performer. Thursday we had the opportunity to see him i.JJ ooth roles. The two perfermers worked together and as a strong unit. Gail has a good vocal range Vlhich gives her the ability te success£uUy mQve from her chest voice to her head voice, an art which few ever master completely. Gail has a unique v<>cal quality. It is quite ef- fective in Broadway music. Gail is conscious of tonality which becomes apparent in a song from Evita, her favorite show. Although the notes in this song are rather high, Gail handles them beautifully even though slle seems to flinch with an- ticipation. Gail is an exciting :performer who continuously smiles. Her radiant smile and bap-py disposition inspired the audience's receptiveness. John Pollack's forte is in his ability to sense rhythm. He is able to jazz up any piece by adding hesitations or slightly improvising the original music. Jolm has a resonant tenor voice 'Wllich he uses in combination \With his dynamic piano playing to- make a perfect performance. llis piano playing is quite JlOiished but never mechanical. Joh.n's feeling for music carries over into his vocal per- formance. John. is not subject to a vocalist's problem of swallowing end notes and consonants; he draws notes o1:1t allowin:g for clearer an- nunciation. Oae could not help but love John's personality as he pekes fun at the song \Come Sail Away\. He is also very quick to establish a warm and friendly relation with the audience. After all, he speaks their language when he says, \this might stink because I don't know it too well.\ It is disap- pointing that .John did not become one of Cabaret's more frequent players. Jeff Lawrence was the second act of THURSDAY'S MUSICAL REVIEW. Jeff, a guitarist and vocalist plays with a steady and powerful strum. This strum was so strong and energetic that he broke two guitar strings in one evening. This just demonstrates J ef£' s 100 percent commitment to his work. Jeff plays an in- teresting musical program which includes many favorites such as Simon and Garfunkel, James Taylor, the Eagles, and the Alman Brothers. Jeff's \Unicorn Song\ evokes pan- tomime in the audience there fore gracing his program with a different style. One of Jeff's strengths is in voice projection. His voice is always heard above his guitar. Jeff's exciting program concluded with \American Pie\. He is especially entertaining during this number. Jeff is quite at- tentive of musical dynamics Take A Dark Ride By ZENDA VESTA Have you taken the tour? What, you ask, is the tour? Well, once again a brave group of travelling companions and I are ready to set out on a certain expedition that I have in mind. This journey I will call THE DARK RIDE. Have you ever been to an amusement park? Well, her~'s your opportunity to relive that pleasurable occasion. First, t:here are my travelling com- pa11ions who will most certainly entice you to gartake in their games of fun and bewilderment. Semnd, a certain muscular assistant will depict my com- panions on a large and erect video screen. Third, the most voluptuous women have arranged a candid slide show for your viewing pleasure. F()urth, and so on, the live music, the soft lights, the by LE.N J E.NKIIJ \L LADY. lf computer display, and the angled set design will excite your imagination. Did that answer your questions? In any event, THE DARK RIDE is unlike any other show that you've viewed. I'm sure you'll be kind enough to meet me there. We'll watch together. A change of scene might stimulate your . . .

This number started the dancing in the wings which did not subside until12 :40 a.m. The last act of Cabaret was quite professional. It featured Melanie Masterson as the vocalist. Although Melanie has not had much experience pe forming in public until her Union debut, she remains poised and elegant. Although Melanie has ''never taken a voice lesson,\ she did not ap- pear as an amateur to the audience. Her favorite artist Stevie Nicks serves as a mentor to Melanie who seems to resemble Stevie's vocal quality. Melanie impressively harmonizes. She blends with both Jims' instruments as well as with the different in- strwnents. Melanie's clear alto voice is powerful enough to be heard above this five-piece band. Melanie seems extremely comfortable performing; she chuckles frequently and is not at all shy in her audience contact. Neither J irns lack en- thusiasm. They both in- corporate dance routines into their guitar interludes. It seems amazing that they can dance without compromising their guitar playing. For the first several songs, Jim Hassenfeld even plays with a lollipop in his mouth. If this does not show his ease on stage, I do not see what will. The acoustics in Old Chapel do not do justice to this band. Because of the enclosec:l space, some of the subtleties we:re lost. This band needs no backdmp or dazzling scenery; they 1ight up the Old Chapel witl! their brilliant performance which includes music of Eric Clapton, Chicago, Fleetwood Jillac and the Beatles. This band knows the VJay te keep the crowd rocki!lg and they were literally doing just that. Jim Hassenfeld repiied, \there is one rule at Unien CoHege, wheR pe(lple are dancing, you don't let them sit down.\ At this time, the audience moved in front ()£ the stage to continue rocking, dancing, clapping, sing;ing, and simply having fun. This kind of audience expression created the aura of a \rock con~ect\. Special recognition goes to Tim Mical who effedively in- tegrates s:ymbols, tympani and serious drum rolls wlli.cb were always polished and complete and, therefore, maintained the appropriate rhythm. It is a wonderful feeli.Jlg to see artists complementing, en- couraging and assistrng each other as went on last Thursday. Jim Havard lends his ~Juitar to Jeff Lawrence, Gail Blumenfeld applauds her accomf)anist John Pollack and the J ims com- plement Melanie on h.er vocal interpretation of \Cbucky's in Love.\ Tonight was full of spirit attended left with b()osted morales. r--------•COU PON ---------,, I $1 Rebate · $1 I I on I !

.CONCORIJIENSIS, May 22, 1986 THE ARTS Union College Dance Ensemble • • • A Performance to Remember By KIMBERLY HANCOCK with special help from MICliELLEMANLEY and ALAN TUCKMAN During the past two years the Union College Dance Ensemble has progressed from an infant club to a superlative per- forming group. Founded in 1984 by Alan Tuckman ( '86 ) , the Ensemble was an innovative addition to the relatively small dance program at Union. Through the Continuing Education Department dance elasses were available, yet there was no opportunity for ~;tudents to use classroom ex- perience in performance. Realizing the need for a per- forming student dance group, .Alan Tuckman .brought the idea of the Dance Ensemble to the Student Forum and was granted club status. Although the Ensemble had gained official recognition, its battle had just begun. The Ensemble was given status- but no budget. The multitudes of decisions and tasks which had befallen the club under the guidance . of Alan Tuckman, included fund.-raising, auditions, rehearsals, per- formance arrangements and choice of pieces. What seemed as unending complication, hours of frustrations and two years of tireless dedication finally paid off asthe dream of a successful Dance Ensemble became a reality. Dance is an artform which requires discipline and extreme dedication in order that per- fection may be achieved. These standards are true for the Dance Ensemble. The Ensemble is open to anyone who is interested in performing and the experience of the present membership ranges from one to twelve years. !he thirteen Ensemble members have studied a wide spectrwn of dance forms ranging from tap to classical ballet. Admission into the. Ensemble is by audition which is held at the beginning of the term. Although everyone is en- couraged to audition, the Ensemble requires a lot of hard work and dedication. Alan explained that the set level of standards for members must be high ·.in order to assure a professional-looking perfor- mance. Members are required to attend weekly rehearsals for pieces which they will perform as well as Ensemble Company class. The average time comJilitment for Ensemble members is eigllt hours per week. The members of the Ensemble do not want to become professi<lnal dancers, they just enjoy dance. Their love of dance makes the dedication and hard work come more easily. The success of the Ensem- ble's spring perf()ITI1ance, \Nott just Another Performance\ is a tributeto all those involved with the Ensemble. The per- formance inclu.ded seven diverse pieces ranging from classical ballet to avante-garde modern dance. The· first piece featUJ).ed the Myers' Dance Company per- forming the ''Rennaissance Suite\. The Myers Company is a local company which was asked to perform with the Dance Ensemble. To date, Alan is the only member of the Ensemble that dances professionally with the com- pany, but in the future they will be joined by Michelle Manley '87 and Jennifer Johnson '89. The \Rennaissance Suite\ is a court dance performed to classic Rennaissance music and in appropriate costume. \Art Trances\ an avant- garde modem piece, followed the Rennaissance Suite\. This piece was choreographed by Darlele Myers, staged for the Nott by Alan Tuckman and was danced by members of the Union College Dance Ensemble. Participants in this piece. were Amy Basis, Katie Eoyd, MiChelle Manley, Penny Neubauer, and Alan Tuckman. The theme of the piece revolved around different people at an art gallery. The dancers moved aroi,U1dthe Nott each doing their own thing but never acknowledging the others. There was a covert camera- bug, a bag lady and an aspiring artist to add to somewhat striking scenery. This piece was innovative and was well suited to the space in the Nott. The third piece, \Children's Crusade\ was an ex- perimental jazz piece. Although the Ensemble has sponsored Jazz workshops taught by Alan Tuckman and Michelle Manley. In the past, jazz, as a form of dance is not offered through the Union College Arts Department, although the Ensemble members would like it to be. Performing to background music by Sting were Amy Easis, Ashley Oliver and Trisha Pasqualini. This piece. was choreographed by Marion Nazarian, a graduate of Mary Mount College in Manhattan with a BFA for Dance and Choreography. Contemporary ballet was the form of the next number, \French Interlude\. As op- posed to classical ballet, con- temporary allows more freedom of the body. Dancers Katie Boyd, Jennifer Johnson, and Alan Tuckman mov.ed superbly. Love, the central theme of the dance was con- veyed especially thi-ough the graceful movements emm bodying Jennifer Johnson and Alan Tuckman's climatic duet. All three performers should be commended for a brilliant piece. The second act opened with a Dance Ensemble classic which, perhaps, was performed for the last time. \Night Pulse\ choreographed by Pat Castelli, is the first piece the Ensemble ever worked on. It has gone through many changes in dancers since its origin, yet, Michelle Manley, Amy Basis, Lisa Ballesteros, Penny · Neubauer, and Nancy Schuetz danced as if the piece had been theirs from the start. The next piece \Classical Memoirs\ was performed by -c two members of the Myers :0 Company. This piece was 8: performed exquisitely and was ~ a fine example of a classical ~ ballet. ro The finale, \Spaces by Ten\ ~ was a combined effort of the ~ Union College Dance Ensemble ~ and the Myers Company.

Its pieces were choreogra!lhed perfectly for the theatre-in-the- round in the Nott. This was the Ensemble's first opportunit:y to perform in the Nott and they would like to continue to do so in the future. There were many people who should be credited for' the outstanding performance <>f the Ensemble. Aside from Alan, the Co-president Michelle .Manley has done a tremendous am()unt of work. The tl1ree choreographers~ Pat Castelli, Darlene Mye~ and Mari()n Nazarian, did a superb job and all the assistance given t~ the Ensemble from Steve Boone was greatly appreciated. A huge amount of credit for the success should go to John Stewart. John, W(}rked long hard hours to insure that all the lighting and sound was ap- propriate. When the J)iece called for the oodies to fade into the background and the hands and head to be illuminated, John rose spectacularly to the occasion. With(lut his hel!l, the performance would have been impossible. The Ensemble received a praiseworthy response to their performance from many who attended the show. Letters and calls have been· received commending the show. The continuation of their' high standards and the promise of hiring a . professional director, makes the Ensemble l'lopeful that \Nott Just Another Per- formance\ will be the first in a long line of excellent Union College Dance Ensemble performances.

'' Page 16 CONCORDIENSlS, May 22, 1986 SCIENCE, HEALTH, AND TECHNOLOG-Y Red/ White and Blue By STEVE KONLIAN As long as freedom of ex- pression is a protected right here in the United States, thel\'e will always be eonflicts of opinion in matters of national importance. .One especially controversial subject is national defense spending, with logically soru1d arguments levied by both those people who favor in- creases and those wbo advocate cuts. The intention of this ar- ticle is to ilhtstrate the rationale, as I perceive it, that . warrants an increase in our defense budget; in particular, expenditure for tbe STEALTH weapons system. Before I discuss the STEALTH system i1self, I want to comment on the present military- philosooh:v and tou~h upon the state of ()ur military. First; in considering national . security, it is essential that the position and aeti()ns of the Warsaw Pact nations be con- sidered. UnfortllDately, we must adopt the philosophy of not permitting our Soviet coun- terparts to attain a distinct military superiol'ity. Many Pentagon analysts believe that this \crucial poin1\ has already been reached. H()wever, I think that this is not so; that ever since President Reagan entered office we have made substantial progress in closing tbe gap. But I also believe that if Carter had been re-elected ()Ur national security would have been seriously jeopardi2ed. I would characterize America's defense program as orientated toward high tecbnology, sopllistication, and futuristic systerns with ex- tensive research and development. A.n excellent example, shr.ouded in secl\'ecy and surrounded by controversy, is the STEALTH weapons program. The STEALTH is a program initiated to build war planes that are invisible to the enemy. Billions of dollars have been awarded to Lockheed General Dynamics, and Nor: throp in the research and development of planes and cruise missiles. Because this program is top secret, exact expenditures is n<>t lm<Jvvn. The Pentagon considers STEALTH so sensitive that tbey will not release much information on the program. · The design of STEALTH warplanes departs from the conventional warplane design of size, speed, weaJlons, etc., in that they are designed to avoid detection by radar .and other detection devices. The uniqueness of the STEALTH design comes from technical advances in three areas: aerodynamics, materials, and electonics. The shape of the plane is long and sleek to cut down on reflecting radar signals. This means that bombs and fuel must be carried internally; and all vertical and flat surfaces mast be eliminated. Also, special radar- absorbent mateMals ranging from plastic based coatings to complex sandwiches of fiberglass and chemically treated foam are 11sed. All the intricasies of the design have resulted in an aircraft as big as an F-4 Phantom having a radar image as big as a bird. This would provide the advantage of being able to close in on the enemy to a point where the enemy would not have time to fire a missile. The first aircraft were or- dered into prodaction in 1981, and is being built by Lockheed, sometimes referred to as the F- 19.

In conclusion, I believe that a program such as the STEALTH is very important to our national defense. Not only is it a feasible undertaking, but it represents the spirit in American technological theory to search fot· the ever important \edge\ in military hardware that is essential if combat ·situations arise.· I attribute a great part of opposition to laziness and ignorance-the American people do not know the value of freedom. That.. is, because we have never had·to fight an agressor on our soil for our freedom, .we take it for granted. I think that if opposers of military spending were to spend time in a country where freedom and liberty is beard only in the tales of the old wise men, they would not be as quick to denounce the Pentagon.

C.D.'s: New Competition By SPIKE BERGERON If you think your compact disc player is the final climatic addition to your stereo; think again. They may not be the best in audio fidelity. The compact disc is soon -to have some tough competition in quality of sound. If you haven't heard music from a compact disc, there is no hiss or background static which is common to records and cassettes. The musical quality can be so good that it seems as if you are in the recordii)g studio listening to the disc being recorded. The discs' competitor · is the digital audio tape (DAT) player. This tape which is a cross between a conventional audio cassette and a video cassette, matches the CO's spectacular sound reproduc- tion. However, the DAT has one key advantage; it allows you to record. The DAT's creators claim that its fidelity is higher than that of COs and twice that of records and cassettes although they hope that its recording ability will sell the players. Two types of OATs already exist which ~ay cause con. fusion with c<>nfticting types of DAT cassettes in the same manner that VHS and Beta videocassettes do. This may be a deterrent to sales because of the-CD's one type of disc which is simplistic and causes no confusion. The first type of DAT is the stationary-head DAT which records eight digital tracks along the length of the tape. This req11ires complex: design of the tape head whicll will Wldoubtedly raise the price of the player substantially. The second type of player is fhe rotaey-head DAT which uses the same type of technology used in VCRs. · The first DAT to be in- troduced is a rotary-head DAT fFom Onkyo priced at $1,0()1), That price is a bit to steep fol' many people although the DATs' price will definitely decline within the next three years ·as is trae with all elec- tronics inclu(\~:o:g the CD. Onkyo's model has different recording rates similar to VCRs. At the fastest recording speed which preserves the most complete record of sound tile tape can record the entire range of frequencies that can be heard by humans. This surpasses the CD's audio ability. Although commercially produced .pre-recorded DAT tapes may sound better than compact discs, blank tapes will only be able to make recordings of other digital tapes or albums and cassettes. Recording an album or conventional cassette will only keep the same fidelity with distortion. The DATs will not be able to record off CDs because the record companies do not want CDs to be pirated. Therefore the DAT's recording advantage has limited uses. Most people recording at horne wiU not have Wldistorted source mlisie · that can take full ad- vantage of the DAT's recording ability. Because the DAT is a tape it . will tangle in. the machine and slowly wear out just as cassettes do. From my own experience, conventional audio cassette recordings can be made from a CD that sound almost as good as the CD. So, I will stay with my cassette deck and simplisti~ CDs that will never wear out. A Raw Deal By A.S.HELFAND You either love them or are totally nauseated by the site of them. I love them. I'm talking about shellfish. For me, there's almost nothing better than hanging on the porch slurping steamers and butter. Of course, just as with every other good thing in life, shellfish have their shortcomings, namely hepatitis ' and typhoid. As a rule ()f thumb, the month's without rts, May, June, · J-uly and August, are times when your not supposed to serve ·or eat raw oysters. Although this has been tradition with Fishennan for centuries, it has a sensible basis. In the· wanner month's of the year, May- August, shellfish are most readily able to support disease . organisms. It has· long been known that contaminated clams and oysters can pass alollg hepatitis and tn>hoid, as well as less severe diseases like diarrhea that may last for four days. In the . past, 'stringent regulations for the harvesting, holding and purification ()f shellfisb had led. to a relaxation of the \r\ rule. Recently however, standards for com- mercial shelUish appear to have· fallen well below par. Another problem are bootleggers that fisp prohibited beds and elude the authorities in route to the market. A survey conducted in . 1982 foun<U03 mini epidemtes of gastroenteritis with over 1000 reported cases. Many cases surely went unreported. Raw oysters and clams. are the biggest trouble .. maket~, with steamers running a cl~se . second. I always thought cooking clams· until the shell opened was sufficient, didn't you? WRONG!. It takes anywhere from 4.6.minutes for the temperature to reach a point .where it will kill viruses. The shell often opens in less than one minute. The \r\ rule wouldn't have sav.ed the 1982 victims, for over half of them were contaminated by December harvests. You'll be happy to know that things haven't been as bad sirtce then. Viral diarrhea caused by raw clams and oysters has been on the rise however. High demand for shellfish, and the continuing pollution of our coastal waters are responsible. . . So WltU new regulations are developed and enforced, eating raw or ''poorly cooked'' shellfish is risky business at best. What a RAW d~al. - - - - - - ~ CL New.

By KAREN RUGA In a recent interview with Professor Gado, he was asked to clarify and eXpand on the cortunents he made during a general faculty meeting on May 2. The topic of discussion at the meeting was athletics at Union. Gado was one of five paneliSts who participated in the discussion. Gado's main argument is that Union College is spending far too much money and energy in the pursuit of \sports glory\. In light of this, the professor commetned that \recruiting athletes is very unhealthy\ for Union. He argues that the problem with recruiting athletes at a small school iS that there exist only a very limited number of slots open every year for incoming students. By filling sports teams with better athletes who only fulfill the minimum requirements for entering Union, the college inevitably compromises its position to attain highly qualified non-athletes. · Principally, Gado objects to the way in which \college and university education in this country have gotten themselves so intertwined, so wrapped up, in athletics.\ He feels that athletics and education com- prise a ''wholly .inappropriate • • . Sports! By DAVID GULLIVER The faculty meeting on May 2 featured a panel discussion on the place of athletics at Union, i~cluding presentation_s by Rtchard Sakata, Director of Athletics, and Robert Montana, Director of Intramurals. (Martha Morrison, Women's Soccer and Lacrosse coach, was scheduled to speak but was absent since the lacrosse team was at the state cham- , pionships.) Theodore Bick, chairman of t~e faculty, also presented hiS v1ews on the relations between academics and athletics. In his P~epared opening statement Btck addressed three points: athletic tradition in colleges, the recent history of Union sports, and the overall nature of success. He elaborated on these PQints for Concordtensls. \Athletics Bick said, \are combination.\ In effect, Gado is opposed to colleges striving to enhance their reputation by way of their athletic teams. Gado seriously questions the effects of a winning sports team for a college such as Union. \How are you benefitted by the fact that Union went to the playoffs the last three years?\ he asks. When asked if he thought that the boost in school spirit generated by a school's winning sports team was a valid argument for advancing them, Gado replied negatively. Although he agreed that school spirit is a necessary component of student life, he argued that it need not and perhaps should best not be fostered throtlgh the academy's athletic teams. \If (a winning football team) is whatit takes to generate school spirit, I don't think scho()l spirit depends on very much.'' Instead, Gado believes that school spirit should be en- couraged through all kinas of social interaction. In his statements on :May 2, Gado suggested: \I would like to see us reenter NESCAC (New England Small College Athletic Conference) - and W()rk for greater deemphasls of sports programs within that con- ference.\ The advantages to , this will, according t() Gado, become apparent when Union an integral part of American · collegiate life.\ They are a traditiQn at Union and almost all colleges and provide an element of students' lives that, academics do not supply. The primary purpose, Bick noted, is the recreation for both par• Ucipants and spectators. Although not everyone plays a sport, (75 percent of Union students, however, do par- ticipate in intramurals or varsity) ahnost every<>ne en- joys watching sports. Athletics also provide memorable experiences and are often the basis for long friendships. Bick, an alumnus and former basketball player for Union, remarked on a recent visit from a former teammate. Sports, as well as academics, he adds, are a \focus a source of pride\ for both students and alumni. The resurgence of Union sports brings forth a supposed conflict between academics and athletics. Several .. years ago, Union was a founding member once again begins to associate with other superior colleges such as Williams and Amherst which it should already be competing with academically. A winning season in this con- ference might hold more significance for Union than a winning season as an in- dependent college in D~vision III. Gado feels that Union suffers .from an attitude of' \defeatism\. \In this respect, there is a parallel bet~een Union academically (today) and Union athletically ten years ago on the football field.\ Thus, if Union constantly compared itself with the teams it would be facing were it a member of NESCAC, there would be more of an initiative for Union to \get its academic act together.\ In sum, Gado does not believe that sports at Union is not \doing the job\ of making the college more attractive to in- telligent, prospective high school students. That is not the job that sports should do. Instead, Union must look toward spending its resources much more wisely in order to improve itself academically first and foremost. In this way, the college might once again retain its rightfUl place among the highly ranked small colleges in the nation. of NESCAC (New England Small College Athletic Con- ference) which included Colby, Bates, Bowdoin, Tufts, Amherst, Williams, Mid- dlebury, Trinity, and Hamilton. NESCAC prohibited nearly all recuriting of athletes and severely curtailed post-season competition. Union eventually left NESCAC since, among other reasons, it heavily favored schools with extensive alumni networks and had unfair regulations. Union's com- mencement of recuriting was paired by many with its drop in average incoming SAT scores and with a supposed lower quality of students. B~ck, however, notes that falling SAT scores was a national trend at the time. Only during the hockey scandal in the '70' did recruiting affect student caliber, and that incident was largely the effect of one man in one area in Union sports. In his statement, Bick points out that the incident \serves as the edge of the cliff aLnncnrilttu.si;s .SPORTS Charlie Slotnlk Looking at Sports Head football coach AI Bagnoli has been busy coaching tennis this spring, assistant football coach Gary Reynolds has been even busier coaching baseball as has lacrosse coach Mike Toop. However, these three men and the rest of the football coaching staff still think about football on a daily basis, and have already started · preparing for the upcoming · season. Union's tOOth Year of Football \Our recruiting was solid, but not exceptional,\ said Bagn<>li. Last year, Bagnoli believed he had the l;>est recruiting year since taking over as the head coach in 1982, and this year it was -tough to duplicate. However, Bagnoli has filled his most prominent needs. He concentrated heavily on recruiting offensive and defensive linemen, linebackers and quarterbacks, and is quite satisfied with the entering class of freshmen. \We are recruiting on a different level than most other Division 3 schools. Most of tile kids we recruit are capable of playing 1-AA ball sometime during their college career, and as a result we're losing kids to the Ivy's, said Bagnoli. Although Bagnoli believes Union lost many quality players to other schools for a variety of reasons, he emphasizes the size, speed, and overall balance of the players coming to Union next year. . Recruiting has taken Bagnoli and his staff across the coWltry as evident by the geographic diversity of the players on the carrent roster. However., Bagnoli concentrates on New Jersey, Connecticut, New Y<>rk, and Massachusetts. \Union's academic diversity, and the school's football program make Union an impressive place for prosp~ctive athletes,'' says Bagnoli. Strength at Quarterback Although Bagnoli recruited · quarterbacks he says frankly, 'I'll be surprised if Mike Garguilo is not our starting quarterback. He'll have to go out of his way not to have that over which we don;t want to fall or be pushed\ and that the College \remembers where that edge is.\ Union, as a member of NCAA Division III, offers only need-based scholarships and no strictly athletic scholarships. 1 Athletics do influence the type of Union students but Bick feels that it is a positive influence. Some small nwnber of students may opt .for a school witll no varsity athletics over an athletic school, but Union is not in the \jock school\ class. position,\ Essentially Bagnoli wants to be able to teach the offensive system to the new quarterbacks, so that they'll be prepared when Garguilo graduates. Moreover, presently, Garguilo is the only quarterback at Union since the withdrawal of Jay Wood from school, and the- coach moved former Shenendahowa stan- dout, Ed O'Day to linebacker. After 1987 there will be some changes to the traditional schedule~ Traditional rivals and NESCAC opponents, Williams, Middlebury and Colby will depart from the Dutchmen's schedule, and such school as local rival Albany St., Get- tysburg, Franklin and Mar- shall, and Swarthmore will gradually be added to the schedule. Since Union has been so successful the past few years, there has been some talk about playing a Division 2, or 1-AA schedule. But Bagnoli has no desire .to drastically change the schedule. We have been playing the same type of schedule for 80 years, and there's no concrete reason to change now,\ said Bagnoli. Coaches Often Make The Difference The outlook for the 1986 season is optimistic. Unioa seems to have many excellent players at key positions, and depth in virtually every position. Furthermore, Union has coaches that are willing to put in countless hours of their time throughout the year to ensure the success of the team in the fall. \The amount of effort recruiting, and analyzing films is a key to our success. We have good players here, but we also have good coaches. A lot of good teams don't win with talented kids,\ added Bagnoli. The past three seasons the Union Football team has received many honors. They have done everything there is to do except one thing, win a National Championship. Al Bagnoli does not seem pressured into believing a National Championship is something he must win, but in the lOOth season of Union football it would certainly be appropriate. Instead, Union attracts and produces well-rounded student athletes such as nationally noted Scott Remillard and Rich Romel' who . may have gone elsewhere if Union had no sports. Finally, we should realize that the philosophy behind Union academics and sports is similar in nature. \Whether in the classroom or on the playing field,\ Bick said, \Union wants excellence within the rules-A's from our students and wins from our teams.\ Congratulations to the 1986 Union Baseball Team E.C.A.C.

The final was Union 7, Hartwick 2, and finished an impressive season which saw the Dutchmen compile a 10.1 record before running into trouble. This game saw a very strong performance by pitcher Rick Bartosch, who recorded the win, and by bats,men Alex Rita, Tom Barrett and Pete Cohan. Bar- tosch only allowed two rWls in seven innings and kept the Hartwick bats in check until Ted Cannon took the mo1111d for the final two innings to finish up. Offensively, Rita, Barrett and Cohan supplied the necessary spark as they ac- counted for 5 of the 7 hits. Rita had two hits, one r.b.i., and scored twice. Barrett scored twice wbile getting one hit, and 'Cohan had two hits, including a double and a triple. This· final g~e brings their record to 16-7 as compared to last year'S 16 .. 9 season. \The team really came together and we played one of our best games of the season,\ declared cen- terfielder Tim O'Leary of last Friday's game. \It's niceio end the season on a winning note especially after some of the tough losses we had at the end of our schedule.\ Union College basketball player, forWard Kurt ~ox, bas been named as an All-8ig Basketball Selection for the 1985-86 ·season.

McDougall Gets Shot At Pros Bu TOM BRAND ELL While most Union College seniors will soon become young professionals in such fields as business, law, or medicine, one particular Union College senior is hoping to become a professional in the National Hockey League. Former Union hockey standout Wayne McDougall will attend training camp with the Montreal Canadiens this .Sep- tember. Thus becoming the first player in Coach Charlie Morrison's eight years at Union to have a shot at the pro ranks. McDougall will first attend Montreal's mini-camp in August for free agents and rookies. This is where the coaches and the players will have an opportunity to get to know each other. McDougall will also get a chance to face the kind of shots found in the NHL. He says the biggest adjustment for a goalie is the quality of shots. ''The average NHL player is bigger, stronger, and has a quicker release than a player in the college game,\ says McDougall. The Guelph, Ontario native is noted for his connnand of the angles around the net and the ability to challenge shooters at crucial times. McDougall's record speaks for itself. In four years at Union he has anchored the goal position for the Skating Dutchmen. He holds a school record for most victories ( 47) and bas played an amazing 4:,925 minutes durirtg this time. McDougall was voted the Most Valuable Player by his team· mates his sophomol,'e year and last year, he was named Junior Athlete of the Year at Union College. During his career at Union he has been to the NCAA and ECAC Tournaments three times each. Quite impressive when one realizes that before McDougall's freshman year, Charlie Morrison's Union teams had never seen post-season action. His best effort in goal is without a doubt the night he tuvned away 61 shots in the nati()nal L semi-final game against HIT in Rochester, which was the exciting four- overtime victory that launched Union into its first ever NCAA final. The Dutcbrnem even- tually lost to Babson College, however this did not tarnish the acc()rnplishments of McDougall and his teammates. It is important to realize that McDougall hopes to play in the Montreal organization and starting out in the minors would not disappoint him at all. \I'll play in the AHL or the IHL (American Hockey League or International Hockey League) as long as I get the opportunity to prove myself,'' he said M()nday night. Montreal is not happy with their present goaltending situation. Although return to Guelph to prepare himself for the most important pr.eseason training of his life. ''I know I have to be in excellent shape and I feel that I have to work on my strength and en- durance because training camp is going to be very demanding,\ said McDougall. He will have an opportunity to skate in a highly competitive Summer League back home in the early part of July and he feels that this will give him the on-ice training for the Fall camp. By October we will know if McDougall will be skating in the Montreal Forum or playing with the Sherbrooke Canadiens of the AHL and possibly travelling to Glens Falls to play the Adirondack Red Wings. ·sUPPORT .

Fitz ugh Lu low Day May23, 1986 \UNION COLLEGE: Where Everyday is as Dry as FitzHugh Ludlow\ Celebrate FHL Day! B MEGGORMAN t FitzHugh Ludlow Day was first celebrated on April 21, 1979. Wben first conceived, it was meant to accomplish three major goals. First, itwas to be a buffer for the apathy covering the schQOl. In a time of heavy feelings, FitzHugh Ludlow Day was celebrated to promote student interaction. Second, _ it was to be organized by a committee of individuals doing something for the school rather than themselves. The com- mittee was anonymous therefore the members could not use the committee for resumes or transcripts. Third, and most importantly, Fitz- Hugh Ludlow Day was to be non-alcoholic. This is to show that fun can be had witb.out the help of alcohol. FitzHugh Ludlow Day is all of these things still. It is important to remember that it is a \dry\ day (thus the theme), so please, no kegs or open containers at any of the events. Speaking of events, there will be plenty to keep every one busy. First of all, located at Library Plaza, under the big yellow and White striped tent, FHL T -shirts will be on sale- starting 10:00 a.m. so rush on over. Also, while you are buying your T-shirt you can vote in the student elections. There will be a flea market, from 10:30 to 1:00, selling jewelry, clothing and Kenya bags; and also to cool you off free Snow cones-all this is. under the Big Top at Library Plaza. Once again this year FHL is having \Shoot Yourself\ from 10:30 to 12:00, so bring your friends to Library Plaza and immortalize these moments on film (and maybe even get into the yearbook). While you are there you can sign the Grafitti board, too. Meanwhile on the other side of the Nott, the \Water Balloon Toss\ starting from 2:30 to 3:30 and \Pie in the Face\ from 4:30 to 5:30 will be in full swing. Later on in the afternoon, from 4:30 to 6: 30, there will be a barbeque on West Beach. Not only will there be vast amounts of food but the food will be cooked by our very own professors. In keeping. with FitzHugh's love of fun, FHL offers to the students a JELLO WAR. This is yoilr chance to get out your frustrations and have some flUI. So keep your schedule open from 3:00 to 4:00 and come ready to do battle with your friends (and enemies?) It's fWl for all ages! The last events of the day are the concert at 5:00 p.m. and a Scavenger Hunt. The Outlaws will be performing on West Beach from 3:00 to 7:00. The warm up band will be The Other Side starting 3:00 to 4:30. Corne rock with them at West Beach. The Scavenger Hunt will begin directly after the bands. It will be judged by faculty members and prizes will be awarded. Come celebrate FitzHugh Ludlow Day w'ith fun in the (w.e h<rpe) sun.

Union College and the •FttzHugh Ludlow Day CommitteE· Will pay tribute to the Rev-erend Dr. John Mar.shall Willoughby • Farnham, Union elass of 1856. Farnham, a classmate of FitzHugh Ludlow, dev()ted over fifty years to missil3n~ry work in China. However,, as ad- mirable as this acc~rnplishrnent is, Farnh~ has ·earned a lastin~ place in the history of this college, and the :recognition of FitzHugh Ludl()W Day Committee, for hav,iiJg donated to Union a stone Chinese lion, now known to all simply as the \Idol.\ Rev. Farnham v;;as born in Lebanon, Maine 011 StJptember 30, 1829. Before enterillg Union, Farnbam taught at several schools and even served for a year as the principal ()f North Granville Academy. 'Not much information about rarnham's life at Union is available. While he and FitzHligll were classmates. it seeoos nnlikely that the aspirin(t preacher much in common 'I'Rtb. the opiurnasmoking Ludl(IIW. In the spirit of the day, we'n never- theless assume that tbey knew each other. We do know, however. that Farnllam was one of the first beneficiaries of Union's financial at.d program. Farnham was give11 a plot of College ground to «:llltivate, and his cro}H!arrots-w~ sold to defray the cost of edu.<!ation. To compound the school's generosity, Dr. Nott himself purchased Farnham's .first crop for the fabulous sllrll ()f $40.00. According to a bi()graphy of Farnham, while ''thE S()n of the wealthy\ daily engaged in frivolity on campus, the in- dustrious Farnham bravely \shouldered his hooe'' t() go to what we would refer to as his \work study\; some things never change. Following his graduation from Union in 1856, Farnham went to Princeton t() study theology. Upon completion . of his studies in A.pril, 1859, Farnham retu.med to Schenectady, where he was. ordained on May 3 and married tD Miss Mary J. Scott on May 4. On October Z9, 1859, Rev. and M:rs. Farnham began their six month journey to China, the land that would remain their home for the rest of their lives. Farnham led an active life in his adopted hometown, Shanghai. In addition to being a teacher, Farnham was the a11thor of numerous articles and books in English and Cllinese on subjects ranging from temperance to zoology; and he participated in the translation of the Bible into the local dialect of Shanghai. O.K.,but wbat about the Idol? rhere is relatively so much information concerning the Idol that one would think that the Idol donated Dr. Farnham, rather than the contrary. The Idol was apparently found in 1860 or 1861 during the con- struction of earthworks for the llefense of Shanghai during the · bloody Tai Ping Rebellion. An officer of the Chinese Army gave the unearthed statue to Farnham, who erected it in front of his newly constructed school for boys. · .The Idol is not in fact an idol. . Instead it is the type of sculp- ture found in days past in front ()f Chinese Government offices ()r the tombs of the powerful. The purpose of such figures was to frighten away evil spirits so tbat they would not gain en- trance, which makes one wonder wbether the Idol has done its job here at Union. Nobody isqttitesurehow old the Idol is, but it may date back to tlle Fifteenth Century. Some time after Farnham was given the Idol, he decided to donate it to his Alma Mater. When he initially prepared it for shipment, he encountered opposition from a prominent Chinese family which claimed that the Idol had belonged to their ancestors; then forgot about their ancestors when Farnham offered them $20.00. .After being used as Ballast on a tea clipper, the Idol arrived at lJ nion where it remained in storage until 1876 , at which time it was placed near the President's house. To a Junior and three Sophomores, the Idol had been erected with all too little ceremony. Consequently, they stole paint from the Nott Memorial construction site and painted the Idol for the first time; when they finished decorating, the ld()l was white, its mouth red andits base black. Determined that their artwork should receive the proper amount of notoriety, the four vandals removed all notices from the (Old) Chapel bulletin boards and painted in white letters that the \little god has changed color.\ CoH.ege officials were furious, particularly because of rumors that Farnham would attend graduation, only a short time off. An investigation was held, but to no avail. Attempts were made to remove the paint; again, they were unsuccessful. The administrati()n eventually lost interest in tlle matter and painting the Idol soon become a popular prank. For many years, it was the custom for sophomores to capture a fresh- man and to force him to paint the Idol green. In retaliation, freshmen captured a sophomore and forced him to paint the Idol red. And so it went all year; should two painting parties encounter each other. the result was reportedly \bedlam •t only in relatively recent years has :painting the Idol become primarily the · domain of the fraternities. The initial concern of College officials caused by the painting of the Idol was apparently unnecessary, as Rev. Farnham foWld all of this foolishness quite harmless. He stated in a 1916 letter (hopefully with a touch of goodnatured sarcasm) \I little thought I was sending such an acceptable and useful present-one that would afford so much amusement down through the decades!\ Painting the Idol, for better or worse, has ·indeed become the one thing that manages to transcend the changing times -at Union. For this reason, the FitzHugh Ludlow Day Committee, Union College and, to be sure, Schenectady paint retailers would all like to express their gratitude to Dr. Farnham. FHL DAY Honors Dr@ John M.W.

Union Curriculum Adapts to Coeducation By LORlOlJWENSTEIN Union College has been ad- mitting women into its com- munity for 1e years now, and for most of us, . the idea . Qf coedUcation is no longer much of an issue. Nevertheless, there are those who are still in- terested in the progress of coeducation at Union, and once statistics are consulted, the reasons for this interest become clearer. · · 18.77 Mayi9, 1986 Union Faculty ·Comment On Enrollment 'frends By DAVID GULLIVER. Editor's note: This article, examining increasing enrollments in certain depart- ments at Union as possibly a part of a national trend, focuses upon those departments that · received the most cri1iclsm for oversized classes during the past two terms. discovering sociology to be complimentary to vocational interests as well as being a strong background for any future studies. · Weiner sees the solution to class size difficulties through the proper use of a depart- . ment's faculty. \Union students are mature enough to know that The Department of Sociology saw much larger enrollment in its classes last winter, par- ticularly on the introductory level. Professor and Chairman of the Department Terry Weiner commented on the situation: \There's no question that we've had a dramatic in- crease in demand; h()wever, it's · ·you have to expect a trade-off: larger introductory classes and mostly due to course load reduction rather than to a surge of interest.\ Sociology enrollment at Union, according to Weiner, has . · been going up for the past five to seven years, which is against the national trend. He attributes ··that trend to both today's students and to the usual focus of sociology. Tbe current generation of students, Weiner . said, evinces a lack of interest · small upper level classes. If a department uses it~ personnel wisely, you use teachers ef- fective with large groups in those introductory classes.\ In reference to the placement of new tenure positions, he added, ''The curriculum would suffer if you continue to fill spots with faculty members just because· of large enrollments in those departments.\ Strong or large departments often tend to draw enrollment. If Union added positions in its less prominent areas, the College might find a similiar enrollment surge in heretofore less popular fields of study. The Department of Forum Positions Still Undetermined Runoff Tomorrow for Pres., V.P. In the fall of 1975, the year after the commencement of the first class which included women, the number of women attending Union had already reached 32 percept. Five years later, in the fall of 1980, that number had risen only slightly, to 36 percent. This year, in the fall of 19&5, Union can only boast of a 3 percent rise over the past five years, which brings the female population at Union College to only 39 percent. Complete coeducation, a college community in which 50 percent in social issues and in hwnan service careers, as compared to the students in the 1960's. The field of sociology, in turn, has been slow to respond to the vocational, rather than in- tellectual, orientation of the students. To explain the steady enrollments at Union, Weiner said, \We've responded to that attitude without devaluating the work we do. Sociology is also a viable set of courses to develop students for law or medicine.\ The department now offers in addition to traditional courses, classes that address con- temporary issues. Students are Psychology has experienced continuous popularity at Union. According to Professor and Chairman of the Department Seth Greenberg, psychology starts out with a large number of majors which increases strongly over the four years of a student class. Greenberg ad- ded, \One unique quality is the number of women that the department attracts. At the senior level, psychology has more female majors than any other discipline.\ In fact, women comprise about . 80 By DAVID MARIN In the largest voter turnout in Union's student voting history over 900 students voted for the various positions being . con- tended for next year's Forum. In the pr~sidential election, Kelly Larkin will be in a runoff against Steve Moss tomorrow in Library Plaza. Neither Moss (with 46.6 percent of the vote) nor Larkin (23.4 percent) received the 50 percent of the student vote necessary to be declared winner. C'hip Canaan and Kyle Siegel have both been dropped in the contest. There will also be a runoff between Jason Green and Susan Newnann for the position of Vice-President for Administration. Neumann took 41.1 percent of the vote to Green's 31.9 percent. Peter Ralbovsky, the third contender in that race, has been eliminated from that t·ace. Winners for the other executive positions in · on the Forwn were Steve Lipsky for Vice-President for Finance (with 62.7 percent) who won over Ted Eveleth, Mark Webster who beat Charlie Slotnik to the position of Junior Student Trustee (72.6 percent), and Gavin Morton who took Academic Affait•s Council Representative· with 69.1 per- cent over Joanne McAndrews. The referendum to change the title of the AAC representative to Vice-President of Academics passed with 76.6 percent. Gavin Morton is now therefore a member of the Executive Board of the Student Forum holding that title. The new Senior Represen- tatives are John Zuk (Class President), Thm Gordon (Class Vice-President) and Lisa Kaplan (Class Treasurer). Junior Representatives will be Jean Matus (Class President), Geri Lynn Mackey (Class Vice-President) and Louis Tremante (Class Treasurer). Sophomore Representatives will be Joshua Waldman (Class President), Liz Tremante (Class Vice-President) and Kim Quirk (Class Treasurer). Kelly Larkin believes that the race has taken an entirely new dimension now that only two candidates are running. She does not think that the fact that she got fewer votes in last Friday's election will be a liability for her since tomorrow's runoff is so un- predictable. Commenting on her opponent she .said,. \People talk about Steve's experience, but his experience is limited to the Forum. Mine is more diverse.\ She went on to explain that she has been involved in many areas, most notably as Co-chair · of the Orientation committee this year, and as Pre::;ident of the Davidson Dorm Council. In a tinl.e when people are talking a lot about apathy, she says, \My experience is the kind of , experience that is necessary to get dd of apathy.;' Continued on page 3 of the student population would be female and 50 percent male, has obviously not yet suc- ceeded. In fact, it is only recently that President Morris pledged his support in obtaining this equilibrium. The problem of the slow rise of women students at Union is not necessarily due to any discriminatory practices on the part of the admissions board. The truth of the matter is, Union is not attracting enough women applicants to bring the per- centage of women attending the college to a higher level. Most of the people inter'viewed for this article were unwilling to go on the record with their thoughts and speculations on this matter, but the basic consensus was that Union's image is not such \ that it attracts the female student. Professor Ruth Stevenson of the English Department, who is a member of the Women's Commission and part of a subcommittee which is finalizing a report on the status of coeducation, was willing to provide a few of her own conjectures as to the problems Union has in at- tracting female applicants. \Women do not want to come to Union if they are interested in women's issue.s,\ Stevenson stated, \There are too many other places to go which have larger numbers of female faculty, and better female Continued on page 2 Continued on page 3 Wes1wall watchers willingly wait for music. <Distordieqsis Inside

Page2 CONCORDIEN$/S, May 29. 1986 Wotnen Enrolllllent Patterns at Union Differ Fron1 That of Men Professor Harry Marten describes the selecf,ion process for the Saint Andrews Exchange. Burke Awarded St. Andrews Fellowship By DAVID GULLIVER On May 21, Union announced that Angela Burke '88 was chosen as the 1986-87 St. Andrews Fellowship winner. She will spend the school year at St. Andrews University in Fife, Scotland on a tuition, room and board scholarship. Burke, an electrical engineering major from Holyoke, MA, was selected by a committee consisting of Professors Harty Marten 9-nd Jordan Smith of . English, Profressor Anton Warde of Modern Languages, Professor George Gmelch of Anthropology, Reference Librarian David Gerhan, for• mer St. Andrews exchange student Lori Oliwenstein and current St. Andrews exchange student Madeleine Hateley. Applicants were required to have a GPA of 3.0 or better, to write an essay, and to submit a letter of recommendation from a professor. Of the eight ap- plicants, four were asked to return for an intel\View with a committee member. Marten described the competition as \very strong\ with all eight applicants being qualified in different ways. Burke was chosen, according to Marten, for her \energy moral com- mittment, and ability to engage well with other students.\ He added that one of the goals of the process is \to choose a student who will represent the college well and who will also gain a lot from the program.\ Angela plans to take full advantage of all the op- portunities the fellowship has to offer. She plans to take a year off from engineering to achieve a \more cohesive program in the humanities than the Liberal Learning prog-ram allows,'' taking courses in Spanish and in religion at the Divinity School at St. Andrews. Although the idea of spending a year away from family and friends is \a little scary,\ Angela appreciates the concept of actually living in, and not just visiting another country. She also hopes that the international experience will help her in a future career, since many engineering firms in the United States work closely with Great Britain. The exchange with Saint Andrews, the oldest university in Scotland, was begun in 1937, and each year about ten percent of the population are students on one-year ex:change programs. Hamilton Students Protest Apartheid By JAY GROSSMAN This past Sunday, at Com- mencement exercises at Htmillton College in Clinton, New York, the graduation process was disturbed by anti- apartheid protestors. Although these students observed the serious nature of the ceremony, they did arm themselves with helium balloons, clenched fists, buttons, signs and pamphlets, in order to state their cause. Hamilton student Paul Mporde Ngobeni, who graduated magna cwn laude, was barred frcm a South African college seven years ago. An exchange program for black students allowed Ngobeni to continue his studies at Hamilton. Ngobeni received a standing ov~;~.tion from the crowd when he spoke out by saing, \the destruction of the (apartheid) sy~tem is inevitable. It is just a question of time. Of course, there will be more bitter and bloody battles, but I hope for the best for my country.\ Afterwards. Ngobeni was congratulated by Hamilton President J. Martin Carovano. During the ceremonies, students and faculty members sported anti-apartheid buttons and carried signs. Trustees and college officials at the school support \selective divest- ment.\ Continued from page 1 representati()n on the Board of Trustees and at the Administration level.'' Stevenson and ,others cite these as well as the overall image of the school as a pre-professional, male-oriented college as major factors which might influence thedecisions:of potential female applicants. Once at the college, however, where are the females going'? Various statistics show that over half of the female students at Union are enrolled as majors in science and engineering. Nevertheless, in individual departments, the story changes a little. In the Civil Engineering department, for ex:ample, only 17 percent cf the students registered as majors are women (so that these figures are not interpreted as being misleading, it is important to note that in these and all following statistics, in· terdepartmental, majors are not figured int() the totals but are dealt with in a separate category of their own). Mechanical Engineering has only 17 percent women majors, while Electrical Engineering is doing muc'h better, with 27 percent of its majors being female (here too, it is important to remember that these num- bers are being compared to an overall percentage of 39 per- cent, so that27 percent is not as low as it might initially seem). The various sciences, mathematics and computer science departments are all operating with at least adequate, if not more than adequate, nwnbers of female majors. The Biology Depart- ment, for example, has 45 percent female majors, a good percentage for a coeducational school, and particularly im- pressive if considered alongside the fact that there are only 39 percent women currently at- tending Union. The social sciences also have some part,icularly sparsely populatedmajors, when women are considered. The Economics Department, for one,. has only 22 percent, female majors. Professor Stevenson points out that it is particularly striking that in the departments with the lowest nwnber of female students, there is often a correspondingly low level of female facUlty members. There are, on the other hand, departments which seem to attract overwhelming per- centages of female students. The Psychology Department, for example, has 74 percent of its majors as females, while the Modern Language Department is at 86 percent, and the English Department is at 60 percent. Compared, once again, to the overall figure of 39 percent, this is even more striking than previously thought. Of course it must also be considered that some of these departments are rather small, and their figures fluctuate rather drastically from year to year (for example, Free Delivery Thursdays 7:00p.m. Order by 6 p.m. Pints $3.00 Quarts $4.00 355-3131 BASKIN-ROBBINS ICE CREAM. STORE the Modern Languages . ' Department was only at 50 percent female majors five years. ago). Nevertheless, these ' figures are significant in in• · dicating the trends of the female students at Union, and · · are worthwhile to prompt consideration as to why the numbers are so severely skewed in one directicn or another. · There are bound to be various psychological, sociological, philosophical, political and economic explanations for each of the figures cited above. Women may be mQre drawn to the humanities because they are not . as firmly pushed In the preprofessional divection as their male classmates. They may, directly contradicting · that, be found so heavily in the EE and CS departments because these are places that are deemed as having strong · employment po!;sibiUties · regardless . of sex. Another particularly interesting nwn]ler, that ties into the various theories, is that for interdepartmental majors. 53 percent oC all ID majors are women, again recognizing that . this is compared to a total of 39 percent women at the college. Perhaps in this way, the women at Union feel that they can achieve both preprofessionalism as they gain a liberal learning education. Perhaps again, the answers here are not, at this particular moment in time, as important as the questions. The questions bring to the forefront of our awareness the fact that there is reason to take a closer look at the goals of Union College with regard to coeducation and the female population on campus. Behind the scenes, not always so well known or publicizedt there are various plans being. made to at least begin to address these problems. As mentioned earlier, the Women's Com- mission has established a subcommittee which is now finalizing a report on the status of wamen at Union,. and which will soon be presented to the President for his consideration. More importantly, plans are being finalized for the new Women's Studies Program, which will be put into effect next school year. At present, this program is being funded by the IEF, and has obtained academic approval from the AAC. Hopes are that this program will be a step toward solidifying the position of women at Union, along with an awareness of women's studies in general. · In terms of the statistics cited above, things are not necessarily deteriorating as the years go by. ThiS past fall's freshman class has 43 percent women, and if this trend can be sustained and perhaps . heightened for four more years, a fairly significant change can be brought about. Also, com- paredto other schools, Union is not doing particularly badly in its nwnbers of women enrolled as majors in engineering. These pluses are no reason, however, to ignore the real inadequacies of the current coeducatio:nal system at Union. There is really no reason why there sh()uld not be more female applicants and faculty mem- bers at the college. We might just need to take a long, hard look at the image our college is giving off, and the goals of coeducation as well. The questions are only now rising to the surface; it is time to start thinking cf finding the answers. The committee on Committees would like to thank all th.ose who appl.ied to serve on a committee for the l9Q6-87 academic year. With over 200 applications, the decisions were very ·dif- ficult.

CONCORDIENSJS, May 29, 1986 Page3 Better Planning Could Alleviate Class Size Problems Continued from page 1 percent of the ~otal number of psychOlogy maJors. Ann Rogers, of the Educ;:ation Office of the American Psychology . Association .in Washington, D.C., claimed that nationally, there are usually between 40;0(1().41,000 graduates receivmg the B,A. degree each year, and this nwnber has been steady since the 1970's, when enrollments peaked. In 1969, .28 percent of the graduates were. continuing for . a Masters or Ph.D in the field; in 1984 that number was 31 percent. Most iriteresting was the finding that, in a survey of psychology department chairmen, nearly all of the student bodY of their colleges had taken or planned to take an introductory course in psychology. Greenberg has seen similiar demand fo.r Union's in- troductory courses. At a college with strong programs in many disciplines, he sees psychology as a \reasonable link between sciences and humanities\ and · as, in one sense, a \mix of · various areas., That explains initial interest in the field; Greenberg's belief that the department is \pt~eoccupied with students' concerns and welfare\ is a reason for sustained interest. Individual and active research programs at the senior level may be a further attraction for a psychology major. ' The department will receive a new social psychologist in a tenure-line position next year to help ease the enrollment load as well as one clinical and ·one developmental psychologist in one-year positions. · Commenting on the \generation cycle'' theory of political activism (see Con- cordlensis, May 15), Greenberg added that psychology was also a popular area.in the 1960's and the theory might be applicable in his. field as well. He said, \People today are more academic-oriented and their interest could be directed into the classroom instead of . campus activism.\ Liberal arts are not the only field experiencing class size problems. Engineering students are encountering increased numbers in both. class and lab sections. Dean of Engineering Edward Craig ·elaborated oil the reasons behind the ;problem. Normally, the admissions office admits slightly over 100 fresh- man engineers~ For the !!lass of . 1988, 140 engineers were ad• mitted. Union's unrestricted system allowed more students to change their major to engineering and transfer students have brought that total to 178 in the class of 1988. Enrollment in the different divisions of engineering fluc- tuate. Two years ago, Craig said, mechanical engineering (ME) was the largest group; now, electrical engineering, with 238 students, is largest. ME is next· with 161 and civil engineering ·bas 71 declared majors across the four classes. Recently, a local television news program interviewed several senior RPI engineering students and the .direct()r of career development who claimed that the job market for engineering was disappearing. Craig discuss~d the matter with Joanne Tobiessen at the Union Career Development Center and found Union's to be a dif· ferent case entirely, with most students having no difficulty. Craig commented that mediocre students in any field may have trouble on the job market but that \there will always be a market for good students.\ Technology is now the main feature of the nation's economy and the market should remain strong. The last major drop in hiring was in the late 1950's when the aircraft in- dustry on the west coast laid off many engineers. Engineering enrollment last experienced a drop ill the Vietnam war era when many coliege-age students saw technology, in the form of napalm, bombs, and jets as an evil. Lately, when h_it:iJ1g has been high, enrollments have climbed graduQ]ly. At Union, enrollment . has been fairly steady, with the exception of 1984. From 1980 to 1985, the The Union College Youn.g Republicans Club, in an effort to further the democratic process here at Union, .wi II be hosting a debate between the two candidates fQr Presdident, Kelly Larkin and Steve Moss, and the two candidates for Vice President of Administration, Jason Green and Susan Neumann. The debate will be held at Old Chapel on Thursday evening at 7:30 EDT. All students are urged to attend, and remember to vote tor the candidate of your choice on Friday, May 30. Remember, your vote counts. numbers ,of fall term freshman ·engineers were as follows: 134, 145, 147, 135, 158, 131. The trend is similiar at other schools, namely Cornell, Hofstra, Manhattan., and the Univ. of Rochester. ·Although Union enrollments are steady, the number of students is still high and there are no signs of a reduced number of students at a com- petitive. ·school like ours. The problems detailed here point to obvious solutions: better plan· ni:Qg witbill the departments for course selection and faculty allocation to courses in addition to careful hiring and placement of new faculty. In many ways the Colleg~ and various departments· are moving this way' and sllould continue with greater vigor. Professor of Psychology, Seth Greenberg discusses the· appeal of llis department to Union students. Candidates Make Final CoDIDlents About Ton1orrow' s Runoff Election Continoed.from page 1 In response to Moss' Five- Point Plall, Larkin said, ''I think some pecple will notice the similarities between my three proposals and Steve's Five- Point Plan. But I feel Steve has omitted several important possibilities/' . Specifically she mentioned that she thought meetings in the dorms W()uld be unproductive; she also commented that his idea of bringing the Forum to the dorms seems to exclude the Greek system. Finally, she says, there is no mention ·Of the Independent Student Coalition {ISC). \The Student Forum should take it upon itself to keep · Union actively involved in the - ISC. It's important to realize that as an independent school, we also l!ave a responsibility to · ;be involved in state politics which affect independent schools.\ Steve Moss commented on Friday's election that \one thing the elections exposed is that a lot of the people who were elected to the Student Forum for nex:t year have had no previous experience. That is why I think it's important that the person who's going to lead the Forum next year should have experience on the Forum.\ He added, ''I'm looking forward to working with the Committee on Committees (CoC) .chair since neither of the vice-presidential candidates (Jason Green or Susan Newnann) has ·experience on the CoC.'' Moss indicated some of his hopes for next year, stating, \I think this year we have realized how imp<>rtant it is for us as a · student body not to have our views and opinions over looked on various administrative decisions. It's crucial that the student body get:? adequate input. Again this is something that I plan to address by maximizing the effectiveness of our student leadership both on the committees and on the Forum, and also by bringing the Student Forum closer · to the student body.\ He concluded, \I do think that I've accomplished a lot this . yearandlthink it's an indicator ()f my potential. But I also plan to implement some changes next year which would make the Forum more effective.''

'.t ' ' ' I ' i CONCORDIENSJS, May 29, 1986 Page3 Better Planning Could Alleviate Class Size Problems Continued f.rom page 1 percent of the total number of psychology majors. Ann Rogers, of the Education Office of the American Psychology Association in Washington, D.C., claimed that nationally, there are usually between 40,000-41,000 graduates receiving the B.A. degree each year, and this number has been steady since the 1970's, when enrollments peaked. In 1969, 28 percent of the graduates were continuing for a Masters or Ph.D in the field; in 1984 that nwnber was 31 percent. Most interesting was the finding that, in a survey of psychology department chainnen, nearly all of the student body of their colleges had taken or planned to take an introductory course in psychology. Greenberg has seen similiar demand for Union's in- troductory courses. At a college with strong programs in many disciplines, he sees psychology as a \reasonable link between sciences and humanities\ and as, in one sense, a \mix of various areas.\ That explains initial interest in the field; Greenberg's belief that the department is \preoccupied with students' concerns and welfare\ is a reason for sustained interest. Individual and active research programs at the senior level may be a further attraction for a psychology major. The department will receive a new social psychologist in a tenure-line position next year to help ease the enrollment load as well as one clinical and one developmental psychologist in one-year positions. Commenting on the \generation cycle\ theory of political activism (see Con- cordiensis, May 15), Greenberg added that psychology was also a popular area in the 1960's and the theory might be applicable in his field as well. He said, \People today are more academic-oriented and their interest could be directed into the classroom instead of campus activism.\ Liberal arts are not the only field experiencing class size problems. Engineering students are encountering increased numbers in both class and lab sections. Dean of Engineering Edward Craig elaborated on the reasons behind the problem. Normally, the admissions office admits slightly over 100 fresh- man engineers. For the l!lass .of 1988, 140 engineers were ad- mitted. Union's unrestricted system allowed more students to change their rnaj or to engineering and transfer students have brought that total to 178 in the class of 19IU:I. Enrollment in the different divisions of engineering fluc- tuate. Two years ago, Craig said, mechanical engineering (ME) was the largest group; now, electrical engineering, with 238 students, is largest. ME is next with 161 and civil engineering has 71 declared majors across the four classes. Recently, a local television news program interviewed several senior RPI engineering students and the director of career development who claimed that the job market for engineering was disappearing. Craig discussed the matter with Joanne Tobiessen at the Union Career Development Center and found Union's to be a difa ferent case entirely, with most students having no difficulty. Craig commented that mediocre students in any field may have trouble on the job market but that ''there will always be a market for good students.\ Technology is now the main feature of the nation's economy and the market should remain strong. The last major drop in hiring was in the late 1950's when the aircraft in- dustry on the west coast laid off many engineers. Engineering enrollment last experienced a drop in the Vietnam war era when many college-age students saw technology, in the form of napalm, bombs, and jets as an evil. Lately, when hiring has been high, enrollments have climbed gradually. At Union, enrollment has been fairly steady, with the exception of 1984. From 1980 to 1985, the The Union College Young Republicans Club, in an effort to further the democratic process here at Union, will be hosting a debate between the two candidates for Presdident, Kelly Larkin and Steve Moss, and the two candidates for Vice President of Administra1ion, Jason Green and Susan Neumann. The debate will be held at Old Chapel on Thursday evening at 7:30 EDT. All students are urged to attend, and remember to vote for the candidate of your choice on Friday, May 30. Remember, your vote counts. May31 June3 numbers of fall term freshman engineers were asfollows: 134, 145, 147. 135, 1'58, 131. The trend is similiar at other schools, namely Cornell, Hofstra, Manhattan, and the Univ. of Rochester. Although Union enrollments are steady, the number of students is still high and there are no signs of a reduced number of students at a com- petitive school like ours. The problems detailed here point to obvious solutions: better plan- ning within the departments for course selectiDn and faculty allocation to courses in addition to careful hiring and placement of new faculty. In many ways the College and various departments are moving this way, and should continue with greater vigor. Professor of Psychology, Seth Greenberg discusses the appeal of his department to U r:Jion students. Candidates Make Final Co0101ents About To01orrow's Runoff Election Continued from page 1 In response to Moss' Five- Point Plan, Larkin said, \I think some people will notice the similarities between my three proposals and Steve's Five- Point Plan. But I feel Steve has omitted several important possibilities.\ Specifically she mentioned that she thought meetings in the dorms would be unproductive; she also commented that his idea of bringing the Forum to the dorms seems to exclude the Greek system. Finally, she says, there is no mention of the Independent Student Coalition (ISC). \The Student Forum should take it upon itself to keep Union actively involved in the ISC. It's important to realize that as an independent school, we also have a responsibility to be involved in state politics which affect independent schools.\ Steve Moss commented on Friday's election that \one thing the elections exposed is that a lot of the people who were elected to the Student Forum for next year have had no previous ex:.perience. That is why I think it's important that the person who's going to lead the Forum next year should have experience on the Forum.\ He added, ''I'm looking forward to wm·king with the Committee on Committees (CoC) chair since neither of the vice-presidential candidates (Jason Green or Susan Neumann) has experience on the CoC.\ Moss indicated some of his hopes for next year, stating, \I think this year we have realized how important it is for us as a student body not to have our views and opinions overlooked on various administrative decisions. It's crucial that the student body gets adequate input. Again this is something 1 that I plan to address by maximizing the effectiveness of our student leadership both on the committees and on the Forum, and also by bringing the Student Forum closer to the student body.\ He concluded, \I do think that I've accomplished a lot this year and I think it's an indicator of my potential. But I also plan to implement some changes next year which would make the Forwn more effective.'' Jason Green, contender for the position of Vice-President for Administration stated that \If our student government is to be serious, we must elect people to it who are serious about making a difference for our own benefit. A vote for me will begin the process of making that difference.\ · He says, \curricular reform is the most important task before us with Gel-Time on the horizon, we must ensure that a varied number of courses and sections are available without increasing the teaching load of the faculty and without a reduction in the office hours that are now available. A more reactive Forum can debate and find solutions that are better and do it faster if meetings are held more frequently. We can only benefit from this.\ Green wants to hold Forum meetings at least twice per week.

Susan Neumann, also running for the vice-presidential position says that she is stressing this week the same things she did in her statement, namely \the fact that we need better lines of communication and it (the Forum) needs to be more organized.\ Neumann says that the race has become more interesting because it is now only a two- person race. Neumann says she is very happy with the results from Friday and is confident about tomorrow's runoff election. Asked what she would turn her attention to first, she said, \I really want to get in touch with all of the people on the committees and clubs and find out what I and the CoC can do to help them-to get things to work smoothly.'' Neumann added, \I'm going to ask the CoC (myself in- cluded) to go to club meetings to familiarize ourselves with the clubs, enabling us to better deal with their problems.'' Comrneniing on the large voter turnout, Andy George, Senior Trustee and Co- Chairman of the Elections Committee said he saw four reasons. One that was echoed by many was the location of the voting booth in front of Library Plaza where many people would see it. He also mentioned that ballots are faster than the voting machines they have used in the past and may not have discouraged voters as the machines have sometimes.

Orientation '86 Stresses Involvement· Under the leadership of Kelly Larkin and Julie Mountain, next fall's orientation will take on some innovative, changes. The committee has be~_n working hard all tenn, and the final schedule of events is almost complete. When asked about · orientation '86, Larkin said \Julie and I have created a cohesive committee and have sur:passed our ex.pectations for creating a more informative and enjoyable orientation.\ Orientation '86 will stress more involvement of the Faculty Orientation advisors and the R.A. 's. To this end, the orientation grl>ups will be organized mainly by dormitory floors. The faculty's role has also been expanded. At one of the orientation group meetings, faculty advisors will hold a discussion of a sebolarly article which will be sent to freshmen during the summer. The faculty may present a number of exa~ple papers en topics in order to help alleviate some of the possible fears the. new students may have of their first assignment. There will also be a panel discussion by some faculty on a timely social or political issue which will be held during the vacuity dessert and discussion. Another end to which the O.C. is working is to increase campus awareness. As a. preparation to the student activities expo, there will be a mini activities expo with a barbeque and band in order to provide g.eneral club in- formation. All students are encouraged to contact Dean Massa's office, x6061, if they are interested in taking part. To inform student of common social and academic scenes, Mountebanks is writing a play to lightheartedly educate fresh- · men and hopefully prepare them for given situations. O.A.s and R.A.s will be participating in the play as well as Moun- tebanks members. One of ·the more important additions to Orientation '66 will take place prior to orientation. Keith Conklin and Kelly Larkin have co-editied a 16-page newspaper which will be sent to the incoming students in mid- Augilst. This paper contains fun and informational articles about Union's facilities~ social scenes, climate, .clubs, et.c. All of these articles bave been written by O.C. members. Overall, the organizati1m and time that has beeiT spent on orientation seems t() have brought about a nuniber of positive Changes.

' ' . ~ FEATURES BIG IRIJTNERS-1/fJ SIITlll of Scllenecltltly C011111y Every week several Union College students can be seen enthusiastically playing in various areas both on and off campus with yotu1ger children. Both participate in a diversity of activities ranging from an intense game of one-on-one baseball to a boisterous laughing match, bringing both the student and child together in a special union. For a minimum commitment of four or five hours a week, these volunteers not only brighten up the lives of a few particularly lonely children but they also get a chance to share part of them- selves with a younger element. The Big Brothers-Big Sisters Program in Schenectady has enlisted the efforts of rriany Union College students in years past. After an initial selection process in which one must be approved by the central office in Albany, those applying un- derge a series of interviews in which a suitable child is found. Once hooked up with the ap- propriate one, the fun begins. On campus a car is available for off campus activities requiring transportation. This program has proven to be a truly rewarding experience for those involved as well as a means of becoming socially aNive in the Schenectady community. One participant summed up her experiences as a Big Sister by stating, \It's a way to excape adulthood and become a child again-a good excuse to play! The child needs someone to identify with on her own level, and it's a challenge to be her friend, that's what this whole program is all about: friendship.\ Confessions of an R.A. By MICKEY BRADLEY I had a lot of problems when asked to write about being an R.A. The first was the question of what to write about: I didn't want to cheapen the experience with some lighthearted con~ densed version of the past nine months, and I didn't want to betray my floor members by relating specific stories. I also can't pretend to speak for all R.A.s, since every eJq>erience is as different as the residents that make up the floors. All I can do then, is write about how the job has affected me, and what my personal, ever-changing at- titude toward the position presently happens to be. The second problem is how can I describe that (sounds like a great article so far, right?? ) I am a Gatesman at Union and one of the toughest questions I get when taking tou.rs through dorms is \What is an R.A. ?\ My answer varies with the mood I happen to be in, which in turn is colored by how things have been going· on the floor lately. \A proessional friend,\ I sometimes say, ''someone that students caB talk to, to help with them with personal problems.\ \An organizer, someone to plan floor activities.\ \Someone to enforce school policy and keep peace.\ \Someone to inform students of school activities and events.\ \Someone to help out in any area of a student's life that he can.\ \An underpaid, underappreciated Residence Life employee.\ (I can always say that one.) They nod their collective head and agree that it's a good idea, but no matter what I say, I never quite feel I've covered it. So what I've decided is this: over the course of the year and especially these past few· weeks as my R.A. experience comes to an end, a lot of people have asked me questions regarding the job which, for various reasons, I answer only partly or evade completely. Maybe answering a few of them here is the best way to describe what the job has been _like for me. Do you like being an R.A.? I love being an R.A. I hate being an R.A. I regret being an R.A. I wish I could do it again next year. I have, at various times during the year, felt all of these (and more besides), often s i m u 1 t an e ou s 1 y . A n d , ultimately, I think they all complement the position because they're extreme. Consequently, I have loved and hated the job, but never merely liked it. I have regretted it and been thankful for it, but never \not cared\. I have been proud of my performance and ashamed of it, but never been indifferent to it. What is the best thing about being an R.A.? Every now and then I try to be conscientiously aware of my role as an R.A., to see what it is I enjoy about the job. What I discover is that there, beneath all of the firedrills, the counseling, the educational activities that no one wants to go to, the locked- out roommates, the arguments, the ha:ll sports, the 4:00 a.m. wake-up calls, the maintenance problems, the tutoring on subjects about which I know esseHtially nothing, the thankless organizing, and aU those endless late-night con- versations, is the annoying subtext-despite it al:J-I am having a good time. The best thing about being .an R. A. is that it is fun (a twisted kind of fun, granted). You can't solve everyone's problems, you can't be the Freshman Savior, but there is a genuine sense of accomplishment that rises out of the rubble. Who can define it, but then, who cares to? S.E.A. Club What is the worst thine: about being an R.A.? The first thing I think of is the business side of things: maintenance hassles (we had no heat all Winter Term), the forms to fill out, the weekly meetings, the training sessions, etc. But for me the worst thing is knowing when to stop being an R.A. And I don't just mean the fact that I can no longer hear a basketball bounce-anywhere! - without thinking immediately of hall sports (which is not something I'm proud of), but knowing when to pull back: when not to give my opinion, when not to say what I think. when not to try to help, and when to let someone make his own decisions. It's too easy, as an outsider, to think I have the solutions to other people's proglems and it can be counterproductive to give them. That restraint is the toughest part. What advice would you give to next year's R.A.s? Absolutely none- you guys are on your own. But I will say this: there was one time this year when, in a wave of self-pity, I could not really recall why I had wanted to be an R.A. To figure it out, I concentrated on just being an R.A. I spent more time ON the floar, planned more activities, and k:ept up on how everyone was doing. I should add here that I was put on a floor of rather terrific people--the majoi\ity of them freshmen-and they make the job more of a pleasure than it otherwise could be. After considering it aU (and trying to lqok at all angles), I asked myself again, \Why did I want to be an R.A.?\ \Why did I wnat to be an R.A.?\ And suddenly, the question (and answer) no longer mattered. The Student Environmental Alliance is a consciousness raising group of people on campus who direct their efforts toward certain environmental problems and issues of concern. From a conservative per- spective, they take stands on issues like acid rain, nuclear defense, alternate energy sources, recycling and con- servation of re-usable materials, and the disposal of toxic wastes. This year's ac- tivities centered on the recycling issues while a earn- pus-wide program was im- plemented for the disposal of these materials to their ap- propriate sites. Some activity was also enlisted in lobbying efforts concerning en- vironmental bills from the New York State Legislature in conjunction with Amnesty International. Next year, the S.E. A. Club would like to organize a Social Action Awareness Week during Spring Term that has been done Amnesty International The 'ymbol of Amnesty Interna- llonal \ a l1ghted candle surrounded by harhed w1re \It is bener to light a single candle than to curse the darkness. \ \Amnesty International is an independent world wide movement working for the international protection of human rights. It seeks the release of men and women detained because of ·their beliefs, color, sex, ethnic origin, language, or religious creed, provided they have not used or advocated violence . . . and works on behalf of such people detained without charge of trial. It opposes the death penalty and torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or S.W.E. SWE (Society of Women Engineers) is a fairly new club on the Union campus. Its purpose is to provide ideas to help with directing future plans- · for employment, graduate school or whatever lies ahead. I spoke with a new member who said that she had gotten a lot out of her first year in SWE, namely an idea of what she could do with her major. Some activities of this year's club included a reswne workshop and speakers on research, design and sales and marketing as career op- tions in the various fields of engineering and comp11ter science. Meetings are held roughly three tLmes a term, and are open to any women who are ME, EE, CE, or CS majors at Union College. before and that will encorporate the efforts of all socially con- scious clubs. Debates and rebuttals on specific topics will be on the agenda for this week's events as well. The current president found the S.E.A. Club experience a particularly in- formative as well as rewarding one, stating, \S.E.A. Club represents a hope for being able to solve some of these problems and an effort to get people to become aware and to care to do something about these issues.\ punishment of all prisoners without reservation.\ May 28th is the 25th anniversary of Amnesty International. The Union College chapter of Amnesty International spon- sored a Hwnan Rights Week last fall. They are also involved with supporting this world-wide movement by writing govern- ments which violate human rights. Freshman Record The Freshman Record Commitee designs and creates that much-sought-after volume distribited at the beginning of each new school year. I spoke with someone who got involved this year doing the photo layout. She had past experience with her high school yearbook staff, but this was not a requirement. The admissions office supplies the committee with the necessary information, then the students take it from there. The best part: seeing all the new faces before they even set foot on campus. Somehow the world seems miles away from Schenectady. Outside of Union, earthquakes devastate countries, nuclear reactors explode, and major international decisions are made, and by the time we find out what's going on, it's old news. If we ever do find out at all. The International Relations Club is trying to combat this information block. This year, to YOU ARE .IIERE. Thanks, guys, It's been a hell of a year.

Members of the International Relations Club also represented Yemen at the Model United Nations meeting in Boston. This spring they traveled to Washington, DC, where they toured the Russian Embassy. While in Washington, the club also met with a member of the State Depart- ment. Learn about the rest ••• Choir A year ago last January the men's and women's Glee Club merged into one successful group, the Union College Choir. This dedicated group generally performs classical works. Most of the members have been singing since high school, however, new. unexperienced members are welcome. \Anyone who enjoys music should come try it out ... \ Next year, for two weeks during winter break the choir will sing in cathedrals and castles throughout England. The choir also performs at many college events, and is involved with joint concerts with other schools. Members expressed a great respect for their advisor, Professor Wilson, and stated that the choir has a lot of fun and works diligently at many enjoyable concerts. · ..

The Undergraduate Review By MARJORIE HOFFER With the new edition of th~ Union College Undergraduate Review, many succes~ful changes have shaped this publication into an increasingly prestigious medium for students' work. When the Review began in· 1982, the students who headed it and Professors Huggins and Wargner had only 15 papers to choose from. This year, the editorial board enjoyed the task of reading 38 papers, and 10 of the submissions · were .from other schools. . The editor, Phil . Bean, at- tributes some of the riew popularity of the review to the enlargement of the staff. Made up of six faculty members and six students, the staff are those who care about the .review and are very dedicated, along with having a \discriminating\ taste. How one joins the staff is rather different than most clubs, as the review is not funded by the student activities fund, rather the Internal Education Fund. Bean ap- proaches the added staff members of the bOard and asks them to join, he also· receives recommendations from the faculty members themselves. The student coalition is mostly chosen through recom- mendations made by professors, although. some members are admitted through a social leeway. This year, there is a professor from Hamilton and Skidmore on the staff. Bean is looking for diverse submissions that will haye general appeal.

Storm clouds on the horizon, and Cyet, that light smell of spr:rng permeated- the cool, night breeze. It was an evening of contemporary piano music by soloist George Win- ston, at the Palace Theater,_ on _ May 1~, 1986, at 8:00 p.m. He performed to a near capacity -~ crowd, many of Whom were familiar Union faces. Interestingly, when this tall, balding, middle-aged man, sporting a worn lumber-jack shirt, patched jeans and socks, walked on stage, the audience wasn't sure whether to applaud or wait for the \real\ Winston to appear, for his picture never appears on his albums. Choosing not to pre-print his program, Winston divided hi~ set into two parts arid_ an- nounced each song prior to its performance. His first set was a · combination of some of his familiar Autumn tracks and a - touch of playful jazz. Paying tribute to Vince Guaraldi, better known for his ''Charlie Brown Theme,\ Winston played ''A Chairlie Borwn Christmas.\ This added nostalgic vari~ty to the melodically somber sounds of his Autumn compositions, as it brough back the images of childhood. Changing -styles, he gave us a feel for older jazz with the swing-base sound· of Fats Waller's ''C~t& Mouse.\ Again, honoring one of the great in- fluences on his music, Winston · added ~ unique and titillating ending to the piece \Colors which was steeped in the style of Steve Reich. Following a twenty-five· minute intermission, in which Winsto!l made a pitch to aid the Salvation Army Soup Kitchen, he opened with <!R,ain\ and \Blossom & Meadow,\ two pieces from his Winter Into SprbJ.g albilm. Demonstrating his varied musical talents, Winston performed an im- provisational Cajun tune on a harmonica. \ He then shifted back to his native Steinway, treating the aud,ience to a New Orleans R&B composition, inspired by pianist James Booker. Rounditlg out the set, he performed two of this writer's favorite pieces from the December album: \Thanksgiving\ and ''Variation on the Kannon by Pachelbel.\ Finally, to close the set, we heard a new compotition, en- titled \Hummingbird.\ Two encores completed his per- formance, which included the theme from The Black Stallion. Aside from the mediocre accoustics of the. Palace and the tactless sale of popcorn, Win- ston was a pleasure to hear. His music was touched with that iinprovlsational, genius that so elegantly creates concrete images in our minds. His coyness with the audience melted away in the second set, establishing a comfortable and down-home . rapport with his audience. His fluent change of styles is representative of the many influences on his music. To those unfamiliar with the unique style of George Winston, I highly recommend any of his four solo albllffiS, which can be found on the Windham:Hlllabel. Winston offers a refreshing variety to the pathetically stale music that currently invades the airwaves. Open your ears and try a listen! Planning a Graduation Party?

It's a word we haven't heard too much about in America for the past decade or so. It's · a word that is now, in 19mi, being used a great deal. It'.s catching on. In the past two years, we've seen Band•Aid, Live- Aid, USA for Africa, Farm-Aid, Comic Relief, .Sport- Aid, and most recently, Hands Across America.It all may seem like a fad, but hey-isn't it a good fad? The effort of the Hands Across America project is . the inspiration for this editorial. It was a tremendous accomplislunent. Getting millions of normally apathetic Americans together to join hands is quite a feat. And it shows that we care. So, how does this relate to Union College, you ask? Well, picture this one: llands Across Union. Sounds crazy, right? Well, not really, if you think about it. This project could serve many purposes: (1) it could show the Administration that, yes, we do care about decisions that affect us or (2) we could raise money for a charity of our choice or even(3) just take a fun picture for the yearbook. Lately it seems as thoagh there has been a growing concern to unite the Union community. Many stadents really would like to see an event coordinated which would involve a coming together of all factions here: students, faculty, and staff as well as ad- ministration. Hands Aer4lss Union would offer ·a ·perfect solution. Projects such as the ones which have taken place in the world lately should be .inspiration for everyone at Union. It should, at the very least, be a little motivation for students to get .more involved next year. Give this one a little'thought over the summer: which one or two or three of the multitude of student activities here can you get involved in? Union is so rich in the activities which it offers, it's crazy not to be involved in something aside from academics or a Greek organization. Now, picture this one: a Union where, if you're not invclved people look at you crosseyed. Think how much we .could accomplish then! And, as long as we're talking about all this, let us add one more thing. The First Annual Con- c4lrdiensis/WRUC Softball Game will take place tomorrow at 3:30 on Ale:xander Field. We're raising money for Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Schenectady and it should be a lot of fun! Come cheer us on! ! Oh yeah, and one more thin~ before you go. Con- cordiensis would like to extend Its wishes to everyone at Union for a great summer. (This is the last issue, remember?) Also, congratulations to all of our 1986 graduates. Good luck to all of you in the \real world.\ Okay, that's it. Now you can finally stop reading. EndofanEra Today marks the end ()f somewhat of an era here at Concordiensis. After four terms of managing the college paper, Sarah Calderini will finally put her typewriter in the closet. Concordy has seen many changes under her stewardship, both in content and esthetics, that we be- lieve have improved the paper tremendously. One needs only to look at an issue from last spring to realize the changes that the sheet has made. In ad- dition, Sarah has acted as a role model for us all. Sh~ has never put her responsibilities as editor in chief on the back burner. For the past two years, she has been, without a doubt, the m()st dedicated member of the staff and the experience she has acquired allows her to answer most any question that a reporter or editor has. Sarah has been creative and innovative, while maintaining a firm hand on the traditions of the paper. Every week, despite the monotonous grind of bemg an editor in chief, Sarah has always been the one to close the door and shut the lights after a long night at the office. She has become a real \pro.\ For now, the paper will sorely miss Sarah as she embarks on a term abr()ad in Italy. Many times we will be tempted to get on the phone to ask for her advice. Our only coinforting feeling will be the fact that she has left us with a style and philosophy that will allow us to buildupon what she has worked so hard to establish. Her ability to concern herself with and maintain responsibilitY, for eve11. facet of the newspaper will be a quality that will be hard to replace around here. We know that despite the fact that Sarah will be thousands of miles away, she will be itching to write, even if it is only a personal. ... ldea&sts Apologize· To the Editor: t r s At this time we, the editorial bOard of The Idealist Magazine, would like to apologize for the ypographical errors in the ecent issue of our magazine. pecifically, we woUld like to mention the error in ~yout in Prof. Harry Murray's article on tlie ~dvantages of the welfare state. Unfortunately, we are not able to control all of the variables involved in producing tile magazine. We apelogize to ()ur readers, the campus, and especially to the auth()r, Prof. M:lliTay, for any pr()blems in· cllM'ed. We shall place.acopy of the oorr.ected article on reserve in the library. Sincerely, The Editorial Board of The Idealist Magazine Name Used Without Consent To the Editor: t i I would like to use this spac~ o publicly disclaim tbe mock nterview entitled ' !Semi- Imagined History: Joie Runon I nterviews W .. T. Smythe,'' which was published in the FitzHugh Ludlow insert of last week's Concordlensis. lllad no knowle!lge that the FitzHugh Llldl.ow Colllmittee would use a mutated form of rny name to cblim that interview, nor did I llave any part fu writing that article. It disturbs me that a badly camouflaged version of my name was used without my consent, thus leading people to believe that I did indeed write tb.at atiicle, and that the real a11thor ()f the article did not come forward at any pOint in 11ie inSert and acknowledge his or her authorship. I trust that 11le FHL committee will use better discretion in their future j()urnalistic enterprises.· Sincerely, JoyE. Runyon Student Suffrage To the Editor: 1 We are very angry to say the east. Because we had the desire to spend a term away, as so many do, and had the good fortune to be selected~ as so many do, we now find ()llfselves forgotten and ignoreli along with our friends on European Terms Abroad Programs. Nearly three weeks before the first Forum election, we called Mrs. Marra's office and asked for absentee ballots to be sent to us. We neither received the ballots nor an explanation for the delay. Two days before the election we called again, and found that our request had been forgotten. Mistakes can happen and we understood. Wespoke to Mrs. Marra and she gave us the names of the candidates and the positions for which tl!ey were running. We explained that unless we heard differently from her, we would have a closed vote and give the unopened ballots to Professor Brian Klunk, the Political Science Department's .Advisor in Washington, who would then tabulate the results aJJd on the Friday of the election, would call them in to the Election Conrrnittee. We felt it was a fair arrangement and that it would make the electi<m more equitable. Andy George, Chaii'Inan of the Election Conunittee and Senior Trustee replied to our request that same day and told us we were not allowed to vote. If we did, our votes would be ignored in the final co1111t. Furthermore, he said and we quote, \How can we besure that Professor Klunk can be trusted to report the correct results?\ Is this not an insult to the in- tegrity of our faculty, college, and the student body?. S1.1rely we Thanks To the Editor: The Union College Panhellenic Council W()uld like to thank all those who par- ticipated in the quad-sot·ority tennis tournament on Sunday, 25 May 86. Also, tban.i you to Laurie Silberg for her- help in organizing the . event. and to Sweet Tooth, Union St. Art, Golden Image tanning salon, Fireside, and Manhattan Exchange for their donations. S:incerely, . . Kelly Larkin · 3rd VP for Programming would expect better from S()meone in George~s position. George explained that the FoJ.Wll had decided not to ex- tend the right to vote to those students ·abroad who, despite llaving paid their full tuition, r<Jom, board, and activity fee to .tile college, were not considered students of the college. By what right do our representatives on tile Forum arbitrarily decide who will and who will not be all()wedto participate in the life ()f our college? As upperclassmen, denied our most basic rights, we deserve an explanation and ask for three t\easonable courses of action: 1. For Forum members, both old and new, as well as the Student Body to re-evaluate the proeess by which the Forum conducts its business. How can the Forum be restructured so that its output is more responsive and efficient? 2. ·For Chris Siler, Forum President, to answer our con- cerns and justify the actions of the Forum in this particular instance. 3. For Steve Moss, because he is a member of the Student Forum and a candidate for Student Forum President, to answer why he sat idly by and failed to speak-out on behalf of bis classmates when. this ih· j;l.IStice came to the Forum's attention. We do not wish to place the brunt of this injustice upon Steve, but we believe that be s)lollld be held especially acc()untable because he is both aStudent Forum member and a candidate for the highest student office in the school. Steve, if your right to vote wen~ ever jeopardized, we .saspect you would have felt the same frustration and discontent that is being expressed in this letter. We demand an answer and :your classmates dese·rve one IJef()re the Friday runoff.

CONCO:RDIENSIS, May 29, 1986 Pagel.l _,.. :· -· . - ·--:-_ . Women Regret Abortions By MICHAEL BOWMAN \1 had my abOrtion seven years ago. I thought it would be the end ofmy problems, but it was really just the beginning. I wasn't told the truth about ab<>rtion.\ Lin Nisselbeck spoke to an audience of Union College students·onMay20 inSS112. She gave a testimony of her own experience with 'abortlon, and presented a film on the subject. Mrs. Nisselbeck explained that hers had been a crisis pregnancy., saying, \It was a terrible time for me to be pregnant for a lot of reasons; I was desperate and wanted help. So I went to Planned Paren- thood in Schenectady. \They told me what. was inside me was just a 'glob of cells,' like a blood clot.\ Mrs. Nisselbeck went Oil to describe her decision to abort. One point she continually stressed was her belief that she was not told the true nature of abortion at the time. \Now I've foWld out some medical facts which Planned Parenthood never told me. Eight weeks after con- ception, my baby already had brainwaves, and its heart had been beating for weeks. It even had its fingerprints already formed. If I had been told these facts, I never woUld have had my abortion,'' remarked Mrs. Nisselbeck. Prior to giving her testimony, Mrs. Nisselbeck had shown The Silent Scream, a controversial movie which shows an actual abortion by means of ultrasound technology. The film has become the :focus of the abortion debate over the past year; particularly because it is narrated by a fonner abor- tionist, Dr. Bernard Nathanson. Dr. Nathanson says that, after he performed several thousand abortions, increasing scientific evidence of the hu:ni\imity of the unborn led him tc change his mind and renounce abortion. Lin · Nisselbeck told one particularly gripping detail. 41 I was in the doctor's office and my abortion had already started, when I decided I wanted to stop. I started y~lling, saying l didn't want to go through with it. But the nurse told me to be quiet, to just relax . and it would be over soon. I guess I knew it wastoo late, but ~mehow I still felt I could stop . 1t. It was. the most horrible · experience of my life, and I had nightmares for a long time · afterward.\ The speaker belonged to an • organization called WEBA (Women Exploited By Abor- tion), a nationwide support group for women who have . aborted and now regret their choice. She was accompanied by another WEBA member, Mary Larson. Although not a scheduled speaker, Mrs. Larson tqld of her own experiences with abortion during the question and answer period. Mrs. Larson had three abortions from the time she was sixteen to the time she was eighteen, \I had to deal with the fact that I might never have been able to bear children again as a result of my abor- tions. The emotional scars run pretty . deep when you learn you've killed a child in your own womb. Abortion looked like the easy way out·, but it caused far more problems than it solved. tl The presentation was spon- sored by the Union College Pro- Life Forum. The group's president, Paul Edwards, said he was · pleased by the presentation but surprised. \To be honest, we weren't expecting this kind of intensity,\ Edwards remarked. \I guess it's only natural. Too many women never hear the truth about what their developing baby is really like. The main point is that abortion has two victims, the woman herself and the unborn· child. I think society should definitely offer women positive alternatives to abortion. Women with crisis pregnancies deserve to have help not more problems.\ Elections for Editor-jn-Chief of Concordiensis will be held on Tuesday June 3 at 7:00p.m. in the office on third floor O~d Chapel. Anyone wishing .to run for the. position must sign the list · in Mr$. Marra's office NO LATER than Friday, May 30 at 4:30 p.m. ·All staff members are eligibl~ to vote.

Herb Schmertz's media sur- vival guide is a must reading. The book, is co-authored by William Novak, who some may remember as the ghostwriter who helped Lee Iacocca find just the right words for his best· · selling memories, Iacocca. Like its· twin, Goodbye is pert, snappy, and provocative, blending Schmertz's lecture on the business facts of life, with the upbeat tempo of a football half-time pep talk. Schmertz, whose official title at Mobil Oil is Vice-President for Public Affairs, graduated from Union in 1952. After being an activist in the Kennedy campaign, and serving a brief stint in the Kennedy..Johnson Administration, he joined Mobil in 1966. After a few years of serving as a Manager in Mobil's Corporate-Labor relations divisiDn, Schmertz- found that the political and governmental skills be had honed during his year\s in the nation's capitol were in demand by Big Oil. The first .item in Schmertz's plan of self-help for the well meaning executive, is know- thy~nemy. When Mike Wallace of 60 Mfmutes calls to ask for an interview, the not-so- hypotheti~al scenario that Sch· mertz cooks up, he instructs the r.eader-executive to try and g~t as much illformation about the piece that 60 Minutes would do, before de~iding to go ahead with the interview. It is important, he continues, to know such things like: who the producer of the piece is, what the thesis of the segment is, what they are trying to prove, and how they hope to prove it, and most importantly, where you or your company fits into that scheme. Then, should you receive the answers to most or all of these \essential\ questions, the conscientious executive, who hopes to avoid being skewered on national television, J?r~pares like mad f()r the upcoming trial by fire. In that preparation, Schmertz includes ·a series of mock interviews with your public relations associates, and the selection of 1-3 clear, con• ciSe, key themes that the in- terviewee Will use in answering aily question that be might be asked. If Herb Scbmertz is beginning to sound like a political consultant, you are beginning to see the point. You are also ready for his next lesson. Schmeltz's Art of Creative Confrontation, says the author, is best engineered when you realize that you cannot escape the attacks of your opponents and you decide to stake your claims publicly, \digging in\ to hold your ground. Scbmertz, who masterminded the Mobil Oil's use of \advertorials~' (one- part advertisement,. one-part editorial on important current issues) in the New York Times, feels strongJy that the cor- poration that prefers the low profile, not seizing the initiative to speak on its own behalf, will be a corporation that will have its critics and detractors speaking for it. In his day, Schp mertz has had heady con- frontations with everyone from Ralph Nader to President Jimmy Carter, and survived, unrwnpled (and many would argue that he and Mobil are considerably better off) from each. Always, Schmertz is searching for the creative, catchy, and engaging \frame\ for Mobil's ideas, a frame that will make his company's ideas noticeable and noticed. To the extent that Herb Sch- mertz makes learning the essential values of preparation and meeting your critics head- on, fun and interesting reading, his new book would be a wor- thwhile addition to anyone's spring or summer reading list.

The plC)t itself is somewhat complex at first, although it · comes together in Act II. It focuses on many different types of characters all searching for some sort of identity or purpose in life. For example, the character of Mrs. Larnrnle, outstandingly performed by Kerrie Ticknor, preacpes constantly about the \World of Coincidence\ because she -.wants desperately to believe in something. However, she ultimately comes to realize that her beliefs were merely a self- created fantasy. Similarly, the life of the jeweler, exceedingly well acted by Stephen M. Burdman, focuses around his \love affair\ with a diamond. He, too, eventually comes to realize that his belief is me~ningless. All of these in- dividual \searches\ are in- dependent stories, although some sort of thread manages to connect them all. The players were outstanding in their roles and the addition of the special effects made this play far superior than most. The play was much more than a story and thus allowed mem- bers of the audience to further contemplate their own existences. Dark Ride is directed by Union graduate Lora Nelson.

?'-<r ' Page 1~ CONCORDIENSIS~ May 29, 1986 SCIENCE, HEALTH, AND TECHNOLOGY A Dangerous Game Sigma Xi Lecture.· By A. J. HELF ANI) On the night of January 24:, 1986, the world's best woman volleyball player, Flo Hyman, passed away. The tragic event occurred in Matsue, Japan where Flo was spending the winter playing for a Japanese team. Minutes after she was taken o11t for a routine sul>- stitutiono she sat down and .siiently passed away. The Red Cross Hospital in Matsue declared she had died of a \heart attack\. A heart attack? How could such an outstanding physic~lly fit 32-yearooQld die of a heart attack? What, is exercisE hazardous to our health, too? I remember thinking these things when I first heard of the star's demise. An aut~psy performed a week later supplied the answers to these quc;!stions, Flo had not died of a heart attack but a ruptured aorta caused by Marian syndrome, a congenital condition that reaps a large toll on tall, lanky people such as the 6'5\ Hyman. Flo had been in perfect shaoe except for a dime-sized weak spot on her aorta. It was at this: small spot that th~ massive artery burst, ·instantly killing her. Marfan syndrome is a genetic · abnormality .first described in 1896 by Antoine Farfan, a French pediatrician. The defective genes associated with Marfans's, affect, proteins in a deleterious way, causing the connective tissue which they are supposed to strenJtthen to develop weak spots. These weaknesses loosen the tissue pl;!oducing characteristics by which Marfan victims are known: tallness, long fingers, deformities of the breastbone· and nearsightedness. Tallness is the most obvious symptom. The avera_ge height of white males with the disorder is 6'2''. Men and women of any race can be affected and the syndrome is inherited in two- thirds of cases. Every child of a carrier of the defective gene has a 50 percent chance of having Marfan's and some of it's characteristics.

Only one in 10,000 people have it so don't panic. There is no di~gnostic test for Madan's, for if there were, Flo Hyman may have lived a l()ng life. Once the disease is discovered,. do<,tors may operate, replacing the . damaged section with a Dacron tube. Without such surgery, peo.ple witll Marfan's have approximately half the normal life span. As a result of Hyman's death, more attention has been drawn to this condition. Basketball and volleyball coaches and other people involved in sports that attract. tall. participants have. been made aware of the disease. Hopefully, the future will bring more awareness to potential victims of the disease. ''Natural History of the Galapagos'' T.hursday, May 29, 1·986 7:3·0 P.M. Hale House Arnold E.S. Gussin Union College No More Di:nosaurs? By STEVE KONLIAN A new revolution in the museum industry is spreading across the country, shattering the traditional expectations of museum goers. This innovative movement 11; known as in- teractive science andit entails a \hands-on'' philosophy for learning. The interactive science model was first developed by noted physicist Frank Oppenheimer in 1967. He established a museum known as the Exploratoriurn in San Francisco, which turned ·out to be an instant success. By the time of his death in 1985, the E:xploratoriwn had 600 exhibits with hands-on interaetion in human vision, sound, light, and many other topics. On the average three to five thousand people visit the Exploratoriwn every day. As a consequence of the immense success of the · Exploratoriwn, other museums across .the country have begun to follow suit. To name a few examples: The Olltario Science Center, (Toronto), Science Museum (St. Paul, Minn.). Boston Science Center, Franklin Institute (Philadelphia),. and the Rich- mond Science Museum in Virginia are among the pioneers. The IBM Corporation is in the process of. developing an exhibit . in Flushing Meadows in New York City. Hereon the Union campus there a nmnber of professors active in establishing an interactive science center in the Schenectady Museum. The College workshops have been constructing exhibits through the work and guidance of Professor Carl George (biology), Professor Ennis Pilcher (physics), Professor Tom Jewell (dvil eng.), and Professor Barbara Markiewicz. Contributions are also being .~{ 7 made by the General Electric Research and Development division. As Professor George ex- plains, \This interactive science process has developed as a result of the success of the Soviet S_putnik space program in the late 1950's. This caused surge in interest in science in America.\ He looks upon the success of these hands-on musewns as very encouraging since there has been a significant decline in interest in teaching the hard sciences and mathemaics in the United States over the past few years. These museums are acting as one mechanism .by which in- terest in the hard sciences may be renewed. So, if you are just hanging out one day watching television, take a short walk over to the Schenectady Musewn, which is only two blocks 'away on Nott Terrace Heights. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. CAf>-A\? i.Mvl o~ , A \Itt e>4lt\S ;-1 ~ Rx1'v..fl.~ -rl-l.l2...ou-.(J.·H t.&)l-\ 10 .\ ALL ~lot-) \_'TiES Mu.~1 t'A'S.~. T:tv -rHG ?A.

SPORTS Union's Athletic Trainers Quietly Add to the Teams' Success By GEORGE CU'triTA Union SID One of the many reasons that Union's intercollegiate athletic teams have been so successful the past couple of years is due to the fact that that the men and women student-athletes have come to preseason in better condition thus avoiding time consuming in~uries. Once more, if an injury does occur, it .is promptly and professionally treated so tbat the player will lose as little time as possible. It is by design, not a9cident, that the injury ratio to Union's student-athletes has been held to a minimum. Head Athletic Trainer Tom Fashouer and his assistants, Lou-Ann Kuntz, who is full-tiffie and Pam Bachand, a part-time member of the staff, have worked very hard to keep all of Union's varsity and junior varsity teams as free from injury as possible. Fashouer a 1978 graduate of Lock Haven State College, is completing his seventh year at Union, his fourth as head trainer. Kuntz,a 1960 graduate of Lock Haven, is ending her second year. Bachand, who has been on the staff since 1985, is a graduate of Cumberland College. Before an athlete is allowed to participate in practice, they must undergo a complete physical, which is conducted by the Athletic Training sta:ff and the team physic_ians. Every intercollegiate athlete receives a yearly physical and screening te help ensure their safety while on the playing field. One of the major treatments for any injury is to prevent them before they occur. The Athletic Trainers work very closely with all of the coaches in setting ·up preseason and off- season conditioning and strength training programs, as well as flexability drills that take place before and after practices. \A» athlete that is in good physical condition is less likely to be jnjured than one who is out of shape,\ Fashouer explains. Aside from keeping the athletes in shape, the Athletic Training staff works very hard to keep up on the latest equipment· designed to cut down, not only the number of injuries, 'but the severity of them. Once more, it is the responsibility of Tom, LouArui and Parn (as well as their seven student assistants) to make sure that all equipment is in top working form. ''We try and keep abreast of all new trends in equipment design to ensure a safe en- vironment.'' said Fashouer. ''Once more,'' he continued, \We stress the impertance of properly working equipment to the players. A bent facemask, for example, may predispose a player to injury.\ The Athletic Training Staff also makes recomendations to the coaches about the pregame meals and makes sure that the athletes keep up their fluid intake during games and practices. Despite all the preventive measures that the Athletic Training staff takes, injuries unfortunately do occur. Once again, Tom, LouAnn and Pam, as well as the student athletic trainers, are aware of all the modern treatments. \Once an injury occurs we do an immediate evaluation to determine if the injury requires outside medical assistance from our team physicians,\ explained Fashouer. \We can treat injuries with ice, heat, whirlpool, or ultrasound treatments, depending on· the type, location, and severity of the injury. \Rehabilitation is the next step,\ Tom continued. \We have several devices in the training room to deal with a variety of injuries. The Orthotron is for knee injuries, the Super II Mini-Gym is for the shoulder, the Multiaxial Exercise Machine is for the ankle, and we also have a Cybex Fitron Exercise Bicycle, which is useful in maintaining fitness while injuries heal.\ The Athletic Training staff also keeps track .of the different injuries that are common to the particular sports in order to find the right piece of equipment that will help prevent the injury from re-occuring. \The hockey team,\ Fashouer offers as an example, \has had a good deal of shoulder separations the last couple of years. We are currently .looking for a special brand of hockey shoulder pad that will help prevent these injuries.\ Until a manufacturer comes up with a pad that will help protect the shoulder, the Athletic Training staff has to make do. Recently, Tom and LouAnn had an article published in the Journal of the National Athletic Trainers Association on the use of football pads for the prevention of certain types of hockey in- juries. They also had an article published on football leg in- juries and The Physician and Sportsmedicine Journal published an article by Tom and ~LouAnn on Astroturf abrasives. Although the Athletic Training staff doesn't receive the publicity that the players and coaches do, they are a very important part of Union's total ahtletic program.. Tom, LouAnn, Pam and the student athletic trainers not only help protect the student-athletes, they quietly add to the overall success of Union's athletic teams.

President Morris asked his personal secretary, Margaret Walsh, to call Cavoli into his office on May 21 at ap- proximately 4:45 p.m. Ms. Walsh also recalls the president instructing her to ''call my wife and tell her I won't be home for dinner tonight.\ It was very strange.

When there was no reply, McCarthy entered the office and found it vacant. The window was open, there were pinstripe suits tied into a rope, and the student Activities van was gone. McCarthy called Schenectady police. - President Morris, his victim, and the van were traced the nex:t day to a warehouse in New York City between Christopher and Bleecker Streets. Officer Howard Lancaster stood out- side the building in a bulletproof vest and asked Morris why he was taking Cavoli prisoner. Morris answered, \I know that Reagan has Union targeted for nuclear destruction. He doesn't like our alcohol policy and I know he doesn't like me!\ He was unwilling to talk until the folloWing day, May 23. Negotiations then began from the Greenwich Village' warehouse. Morris demanded a telephone conversation with Reagan and a tin of biscuits. Officer Lancaster told Morris that he would try to ac· commodate him as best he could. He had Reagan on the phone by 3:00 p.m. that day. Speaking over a conference phone, Morris asked Reagan to disarm all missiles pointed at Union College. \Where's Union College?\ asked Reagan. \Oh don't play coy with me!

Th1s study was a culmination of many years' worth of work, where a sociologist posed as a student spent a year doing field work at the Union College Campus in Schenectady, N.Y. The group that was studied has been given the term \Pam- pered American Junior\. However, the sociologist Professor Beez, said that a~ opposed. to studying the females, the \princess\, he was spending his time researching the males, the \PRINCES\. The males fitting that description find their homes on Long Island and other surrounding areas such as Westchester. Often, their home away from home is at Club Med and certain establishments called fraternities. They will accuse the female counterpart of spending too much time worrying about her nails breaking and her make-up running. However, Professor Beez noted that these males have an ex:cessive interest in their automobiles. He found that typical automobiles favore~ by this group are usually Saabs, . Andis, Honda Accord, B.M.W.s, Mercedes and for a few less fortunate t~ own their own brand new car drive their father's old one ~ Cadillac. The PAJ spends a 'lot of money on a good stereo sy~tem for his car. In fact, Beez sa1d that often times, in a moment of boredom, the PAJ will thtunb through his copy of \Car and Driver\ in search of improving his vehicle. After a year's worth of study, Beez found that the car is usually put to use for three activities · 1) .sjtting in the lot to lure women. 2) driving home for winter break, 3) going to Skidmore and other institutions such as bars where they will find companions of the female persuasion for an evening. Another interest held by the PAJ male as well as female is clothing. After close examination of many PAJ's · wardrobes, Beez found that many share similar tastes and styles in clothing. Although not as frequent this year as last, were the \GUESS\ jeans. He found that many PAJs had excessive amounts ()f these \Guess'' articles-in pants, jeans, and often times the label extended to the upper' body in the form of a jack~t. Another brand of pants enjoyed by the PAJ are the GIRBE.AU where the label is found 11ear the fly of the garment. Covering the top of the PAJ are sometimes a piece of clothing rtsembling a sweatshirt, yet with a higher style, such as a l()ud design, front pockets, and buttons or zippers near the neck. These \tops\ Beez found to be rather high in price, averaging $45.00. other popular sbirt styles for the PAJ are certain forms of oxfords. The most frequently worn .ox:ford boasts a little man on top of a little horse ()n the left breast. However, after at- tending a party earlier in the spring term, Beez found yet another style in oxford button- down-the Tommy Helfanger look. Males sporting this look will neglect to tuck the shirt in the pants, as the label is found on the bottom of the shirt and is therefore less visible. In the winter, very ex:pensive sweaters are worn covering the oxford-while in tlhe warmer months, as soon as the tennis season begins, the males don a certain brand of clothing with a red and navy \F\ on the pocket. The interest in clothing ex:- tends to the feet as well. Beez found an array of Reebok sneakers covering the foot of the average P AJ, or else other forms of leather sneakers Interviewing one «!ase study, ~ young man known as ''Rev\ Beez noted that this gentlema~ owned a pair of $1Ul.OO loafers. When Beez dismvered this interesting fact he began tc intensely study the forma: footwear in the PAJ. Popular styles were the loafers and espe.ciallr \GUCCI'' lo'afers. With h1s eye for detail, Beez noticed that many P AJs had a jewelry fetish. In fact, Beez. saic> that this was n()t -a \minor deta~, rath~r it is a major detail, of which I h·ave devoted Con1illued on page 3 .,

ByPAULCHOPHEAD Recently, our campus was subjected to a case of life imitating art. And, as would be expected in Schenectady, the at1 £orin that was ilnitated was science fiction. Last Tuesday evening, ap- parently, our campus was visited by some unwanted exchange students who had planned to make some per- manent changes to Union College. This is according to M. Herman Davis, '87, who is an aritrhopology, sociology, computer science, and English major who watches an inor- dinate amount of TV in his spare time. Mr. Davis has agreed to give his exclusive story to this paper. The following is his account: Last Wednesday morning I woke up just before eight. I remember because that was when my roonunate returned after his usual Tuesday night socializing. \'Were they from Quebec?'• he asked. \N() they were from an alien place, \ I ,responded. \'rtten were they from New Jersey?'\ he asked. The111told him t:hat they were fro1n N~rs. They were red with grEen letters, and they daid, \Mar-s the Center of the Universe\ on them. Ap})uently, the aliens had managed to hide their space~hip by disguising it as a car. I learned this later, as well .as th~t the reas<ln why they didrJ.'t disauise their license platEs was that intergalactic law forbids this. I told the c<J()k on duty to run, which he had .ah-eady begun to do. I retreatEd behind,. the counter, hoping to make my last stand there.. I frantically searched f()J~ a weapon to stop them with. Finally, I found a one-gallon can of lard. When I · hit them with that, they ex- ploded with a tremendous flash of light. I'm glad I won't be the · last person t() have used too much lard in the Skellar: That was the last thing that I remember before I WOKE UP. · As a final note to this story, after I finished telling my roommate this story, I noticed that my clothes were covered with a thin, sticky, green film. My roommate then handed me an envelope that he had found lying outside my door. It was a fluorescent blue with a Russian postmark and a return address located somewhere in the Twilight Zone. Frat-Aid New Benefit Concert Proposed By AL X. STEP:.VNS It has been long overdue. Finally, · with all these benefit .concerts going on tlle great people behind them have elected to devote an entire .show to those needy social organizations, fraternities. Frat-Aid was conceived and organized by last year's Nobel Prize runner-up, BobGeldorf of. · the Boom Town Rats. The event promises to be a sizable one with many accomplisbments. Says Geldorf, \All I want is for those outstanding fraternities to continue on in. the style they do in pt·oviding social functions to the mentally strained college kids of America. Hell, they're . the backbone of our S<lciety.'' ( Geldorf then went into a long allegorical story about bating Mondays but since no one goes to class on Mondays, we deemed as unnecessary.) Frat-Aid will be held at the Meadow Lands in New Jersey, of all places, and is expected to raise a .substantial amount of money for the Greek organizations. The b.enefit's three point assistance plan will help fraternities ae;mss the nation, 1) Remain on tap for 24 hours a day, seven days a week (or the keg-of-plenty theory), 2) Maintain the structural supports of each house which receives a great deal of stress from over 300 people leaning against one wall and 3) Build sloping floors to prevent small swimming pools from forming due to spilled veverages. Since the new drinking age has been established in most Question: states the big question is liability and the drinking problem? Gelder£ responded to each, respectively, ''Who cares, and I think they drink just fine.\ Half of the proceeds will go towards the newly established national organization called the Fraternity Advancement and Research for Collegiate Endeavors, or F A.RCE. Some of the projects already un.der research are a biodegradable plastic cup that dissintegrates in 24 hours or before sunrise, a sound cloaking device that when hooked up to any .sound systern redirects the noise o£ the party to the quietest building on campus, so expect the library to be broken up more often by security and an inexpensive people mover that transports imambulatory people home. The latter, according to FARCE, is based on a scare tactic. What it is is an inflatable doll that when blown up resembles a life-size angry drunk football player (available in Ben Davidson or the Fridge form). According to reports. it is quite successful in propelling people home without their feet ever touching the ground. The concert is planned for late August because, Geldorf says, \Those kids are working just too darn hard during the year to see a concert.\ Pending the success of Frat-Aid there are tentative plans to hold shows for sororities called Sort- of-Aid and a benefit show for struggling seniors trying to graduate called Dial-a-Thesis- Aid. I looked up at him and then at my television set. The morning talk show hostess had just announced that it was 7:53 and that in the next half hour, we would hear the latest news about Chemobyl plus Brooke Shields would be modeling the lastest summer swimwear. I \'aiked into the Skellar .past two .gU:YS who I thought were talk:irtg to each (}ther. When I loolted at them, I could hear them talking to each other, but no \Wor-ds were coming out of theil' mouths. I sat in the booth behirtd them. That was when I noti<ed the Father's Day card in my back pocket. It was p()sbnarked Kiev. I agreed with my r()ommate that it was strange that I should have received a Father's Day card in May. Well, anyway, when I held the Icard .closer t(} my head to read it, everything i>ecame clear. The ca'(fiation, which had been mald.11g it possible for me to read their thoughts partically, now made it possible for me to learll everything that was in their minds. These two aliens wer-e !Martians. Mars as you kn()W is incapable of sup- portillg. hwnan life as we know it, :ami the planet is dull and liieles,s. Some months ago, some devious, ruthless, ob- noxbus, and cunnilig real estate developers invaded their planet ancl tt\'ansformed their world into an exciting and beautiful reoor1 known as Club Red. ThesE developers, it turned out, were Klingons. Was the U.S. justified~ bombing Libya? . \ He asked me why I was still dressedandwhyi was sprawled out on the floor clutching an empty bag of chili and jalepeno flavored Doritos. I said that I had planned to watch War of the Worlds on the late show last night, and that I must have fallen asleep before it had en- ded. He told me thatl shouldn't eat so many of those chili flavored things. I told him that I only had one or two. He held up two empty bags and pointed at two more on the floDr. I told him that they must be the ex- planation for my dream last night. I then told him about my dream. It began with me walking down the Skellar steps at about nine last night. I dreamt that I was going down there to get a glass of milk before bed. He told me that as long as I was dreaming about going to the Skellar on a Tuesday night, that I should have included some nubile waitresses on toller skates serving Chivas at 25 cents a shot. Well, anyway, while I was walking down the steps, I noticed an unusual car. It was a 1971 Plymouth Satellite with one headlight missing, and with d1>ors and fenders of clashing colors. My roommate then said that there are dozens of cars in Schenectady just like that. Then I told him about the foreign license plates. Ther-efore, they decided to emi~rate to a place that closely resembled their old world. They picked Schenectady for this reason, plus the fact that mote episodes of My Favorite Martian are sh()wn here than anywhere else in the English spealting universe. In order to tra11sform their new home into an E&act replica of tlleir old one, they would have to annihilate ever:v()ne currently living in the city. Naturally, I w~uld have to prevent this. After all, in two weEks I'll have to take seven fin:al:;, and I have to make sure that all .of my professors are alive to proctor them. In a display of altruistic lleroism, I did 'li't'bat anyone who has seen The Wizard .of 02· and The Day of tlle Triffids 57 times apiece would have done. I threw a bU(!ket of mop. water on them, ho)lillgto melt them. All that did was c:ause them to give off a little steam and get very angry. \Yes yes. Of course Reagan was justified.

DISTORDIENSIS,.Map29, 1986 Page3 Morris Arrested in Kidnapping . . Held in NYC Jail Continued f~:om page 1 me.\ Reagan replied, \I S'\VEllr to you as a gentlema':l an.d a politician, John Morris, I have no plans to assault your college . with nuclear weapons df any kind. You must believe me. I'm your president.\ \Your're not mY president! I am a subject of the Qlleen of England. God Save the Queen! ! ! \ Morris r.espoond.ed. In retrospect, Offlcel.\' Lan• caster believes that tbe ex- . change served only to intensify . · Morris' fears that thel\'e wa~ a conspiracy against Union College. Said Lanca.ster, \There was no telling .tbe guy that it was all in his hea.d, that there was no plan to drop · anything on Unien.\ Throughout the ordeal,. Cavoli . assured police that he vro:~s fine, that he was uninjured. by Morris. Each day, f()()d was brought in by a waitress .from a nearby restaurant. Altn()ugh Morris never got his bis~::uits, he was given fresh croissants, which seemed to suffice. With his demands satisfied, ]lOlice hoped that the end ()f tile in- cident was near. On May 28, a week after Cavoli was taken h()stage, Morris- called for another conversation with Reagan. Again speaking over the con- ference phone, Morris said that all he wanted was for Regan to point the missiles elsewhere, that once }leagan promised this, he woUld think about reconstructing the College's alcohol policy. \Well ... Well ... I guess that would be swell If you'd let my friend Rich go free. It would be a stride in the direction of freedom and democracy. And I'U tell you what, Mr. Morris: You don't have to reconstruct your alcohol policy.\ Morris agt:eed to these terms and gave himself up to police. Cavoli walked out of the warehouse on his own, ap- parently healthy and none the · worse for the ordeal. In an interview after the incident, Cavoli told us some of the things Morris said. ~'He said that he knew I was buddy~buddy with Reagan since that State of the Union address, that he knew Reagan told me all about his defense system planned against Union, and that he knew I was assisting in this technology because he'd had my room searched for incriminating evidence, which he supposedly found. I had no idea what he was talking about-I had no such knowledge. All Reagan said to me when I met him was that he was proud to have me as an American, and that I was an outstanding young person who .idealized the American dream ()f freedom and progress.\ Cavoli is back at Union .preparing for final exams. Morris is being held without bail at New York City Jail, awaiting extradition proceedings. He has been charged with kidnapping, van theft, and trespassing. Acing in his behalf . is Vice- President Thomas D'Andrea. Professor .Beez, the man responsible for illuminating the plight of the typical' Union C::olleg.e male, the PAJ: The Sociology of a PAJ Study Conducted at Union Continued from page 1 an entire chapter in my book. Next year, I am applying for a grant from the state of New York to further my study in this specific areei.'' Ninety-nine percent of all PAJs wear a gold chain around their neck. other articles are the chain ling - bracelet, which Beez found quite fascinating. He stated that it is often worn on the right hand asnotto \clash\ with the PAJ's watch-(wb.ich is usually a very inexpensive, large SWATCH). Due to the heaviness of this article, Beez wondered how the PAJ wrote--thinking that the bracelet would weigh the wrist down so hard that it would hinder hand movements. (Not to his surprise, the Professor discovered that most P AJs did their writing not with their Cross pen, but with their \Macs\-a slang name for a yopular computer.) • FILLER • ·FILLER • FILLER • FILLER • FILLER • When the Professor spent his time living with this sub-culture be learned · interesting similarities in grooming habits . The PAJ will rise in the mor- ning and commence with his shower. The products used to shampoo the hair are often of such quality that they are only found in what the PAJs are quoted as saying are the \top salons, never drugstores!\ The products range from Paul Hauser Takes His Time Vice-President of Finance John Hauser was interviewed the other day I and was questioned about the cl()ck on the Memorial Chapel. llall.$er was asked Why it toolt his staff almost a year to get the clock on the right time. He commented that, \our fine maintenance staff almost bad the <lamn-thing on time but then day-light savings time came al'OUlld and that really threw us off. My men just couldn't seem t() g.et that hour hand right. Ad<Ung to -that, the staff had to take a crash course on roman num:erals.\ When asked about th.e fact that the chimes were off,. Hauser said, \It's tough en()ugbi to get the clock right. Wllat do you want, everything?\ 'I'he clock on the Memorial Cb~tpel: it takes a lickmg and its ~till not ticking. Student Study Underwtly At last month's '~Sto:~te of the Union\ panel d!scllssion, Vice President for Academic Affairs Thomas D'Andrea ·was asked, \Why don't you like s111dents?\ He did not, at tllat time, respond. In a recent i.n:1erview, . D'Andrea explained, \'That evening, I was not RWo:Jl\'e that there were students at Union College. I have sin<le reen in• formed by my staff th:at there are, in fact, almost Z.,()4J().()f them here.· We are workillg qlli<!kly to resolve this an~esirable situation.

The results of the study, \Which may be alarming to some, will he a.vaila ble by 19{)5, a. con• stderably short span ()f time for a study _ conducted by a bureaucratic organitation. \21 Club'' to Close The recent development of the \21 Club\ has proved to be a failure which proves that when students and the Administration do work together, they usually fail. Due to lack of student in- terest in the \21 Club\; the College has decided to close down the establishment. In its place, plans are set to build a temporary swimming pool that will be torn down when the gymnasium renovations are completed. According to Vice- President for Finance John Hauser,\ We've been able to set aside thirty or forty thousand dollars because of the tuition increase. We figured that all members of the community would enjoy the pool, especially Dr. D'Andrea who, off the record, needs to start swim- ming. In addition, we've already set the precedent for investing funds iilto a project that will be worthless in a couple of years. Look what we did with the Pub.\ Dean Joseph Mammola, a main contributor to the development of the \21 Club\ believes that students over the age of twenty-one will not really lose out with the closing of the Club. Com· menting, Mammola stated, \Those who used the Club can just walk down the street to Gravel Gerties, or to the Goosehill Tavern like I do everyday at 5:00. Both places have pooltables and Gravel's has incredible video machines.\ Gado at Ellis Professor Frank Gado is at Ellis. Hospital for treatment of injuries sustained in a hot-air ballooning accident last Monday. Apparently, Gado's balloon crashed when he ran out of hot air. The director of the ballooning service commente~, \he was flying much too high, using much too much of his hot air, and he eventually ran out.\ Flowers and candy can be sent to Room 1282, at Ellis Hospital, Schenectady, NY. Professor Gado will return to campus for the curriculum debates which are scheduled for the swnmer. Unionite Selected as Honoralld Union student Kaveh S:hebani, an expert on Middle-Eastern · relations will be awarded an honorary degree at the College's commencement exercises. Shebani has written several dissertations based on the personal experiences of almost having his head blown off by Muammar Qadaffi and is also a candidate for a Nobel Prize based upon his research efforts. When asked to comment on his recognition, Shebani stated, ''Qadaffi is mild-mannered compared to those heavy- handed and super-critical editors of Concordiensis. I'd like to chop their heads off!'' Staff to Teach Precept Freshman Preceptorial, Perception and Coer~ion, will be taught next year by the cleaning staff of Fox and Davidson dormitories in an effort to broaden the hori2ons of both the students and the staff. Professor Charles Gati, the impetus in the planning of this program, asserts that the cleaning staff will do a magnificant job because, he thinks, they can speak to the students on the students' leveL The staff seems to be very excited by the prospect, but they are forming a solidarity union to obtain tenured positions as adjunct faculty. Gati bas taught Perception and Coercion for the past six: years at Union; everyone has failed his class. Norstar Changes Image Norstar Bank will be offering \customer\ service for all customers desiring service beginning June 1, 1986. Bank President Michael Carlson told Concordiensis \A lot of our customers have been coming to · us .asking f()r service. We never really understood what they meant until recently, and now we've come to the conclusion that, if they want service, then maybe we should give it to them.\ Beginning June 1, Norstar will be implementing a bank- wide program in which customer-s participate by putting money in the bank and taking it out when they need it. The bank's business hours will also be expanded to run from 11;00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday, and Thurs- day. Currently, the bank has no hours when it is open to the public. Nostar Bank is reputedly the largest bank corporation in Upstate New York, next to KeyBank. Union and Skidmore Swap Ideas Recently, it has been an- nounced that Union President John M<nis has been appointed to the Board of Trustees at Skidmore College. Coincidently, Union will add a member of the Skidmore community to our team. Joseph Palamountain, President of Skidmore has been chosen as a Union honorand this year. When asked to comment, Morris stated, \It's the old 'You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.\' Joe and I have been - friends for many years now and we've been able to do each other a faV(ll.\'. I'm confident that things will work out well bet- ween the Skiddies and us. And, I'm very excited to see all those pretty girls.\ To continue the tradition of swapping honors, Morris .and Palamountain plan to swap wives next year. Mitchell to Nexxus, and for those with curly and hard to manage hair, the PAJ has an array !)f mousses and gels on his dresser to aid him with the task of blow drying this head- C()vering hair. With the hair, Beez discovered a rising in- terest in hair coloring. The P AJ, trying to achieve a blond \Californian\ look will either spray in products as SUN-IN, or seriously lighten their hair. Along with the grooming habits Beez said that he found many PAJ s using expensive name bi'and deodorants such as Aramis and Chanel; and name brand shaving creams such as Clinique for those who do not use their electric razor. In addition to these habits, the PAJ will throw on what he feels is a dab of cologne, but Beez states is \close to half a bottle with that same man on top of his b()rse hitting a little ball on it is used daily.\ 'I'be study habits range freatly in the PAJ. Some, he n()tes, are \bio-major pre-med throats\ who suffer severe neurosis due to the fact that they are pushed in to the profession by their parents and thus the student will do ANYTHING for a good grade. One case study of \B. Man\ involved a student stealing a copy of his \gut psychology course\ final exam. other PAJs are unable to compete with the academic pressure and are \pre-law\. They savour the fact that they have more tennis time instead of spending the time in lab. Finally, there is the eco major who slides by with a minimum G.P.A. due to the fact that he will be entering his father's business. In conclusion, Professor Beez . said that he enjoyed his field • work here at Union. He is . looking forward to the publication of his book and its eventual lead to a tenure position at an esteemed University.
