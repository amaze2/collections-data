Meet:\ January 17, 1980 Volume 109, Nvmber- 10 • Tenure And Costs Resolved Senior irustee Mark Burnet..t by MARK BURNETT and ED LONERGAN On January 9, 1980, the Union College Board of Trustees met for its annual Winter Meeting in the el·egant, but murky at- mosphere of the University Club in New York City. Under the watchful gaze of Eliphalet Nott, the Board disposed of a routine slate of business, highlighted by the an- nouncement of a $700 increase in overall student charges and College Receives Bequest · by EDWARD ALBRO The:.. wHl of Harold E. Blodgett, a long time friend and economic supporter of the College , who died in the latter half of last year, ,.left con- siderable funds both to the College in' general and to the English Department in par- ticular. The final disposal of these· funds was decided at the December meeting of the Board of Trustees, in a der;:ision which · caused disappointment .among some members of the English · Department. .· · $55,000 of the entire bequest, which. has yet to be finally valued, was clearly earmarked by Mr. Blodgett. $5,000 will go to the upgrading of the previously established Catherine A. and James S. Bfodgett scholarships and $50,000 will go to the creation of a new scholarship or scholarships in the memory of Mr. Blodgett and his wife, Anne. However, the remainder of the bequest, which was reported in the Schenectady Gazette to amount to apP.roximately $750,000, was granted under less specific terms. In the words of the will, this money was to be ''allotted to the English Department of the College in memory of Edward E. Hale, Jr.\ It is in the distribution of these last funds in which any disagreements ·....-arise. The decision of the Trustees was that all 'money allotted to -the English Department wottld go to the creation of an Edward E. Hale Memorial Professorship, or Chair as it is known. This move disappointed. Prof. Ullman · of the English Dep~rtment most strongly. He explained that \a chair is just a title\- which \doesn't par- ticularly benefit the English Department\ because it neither creates a new position nor will it necessarily increase the salary of any professor. Ullman characterized the Chair as \largely windowdressing,\ an honor for the chosen professor, but little more. Both he and English Department Chairman Nelson favored the establish- ment of a discretionary fund . under the control of the English Department. This fund, which would be similar in purpose to the Tracy Fund in the History Department, would provide extra money for unbudgeted activities such as visiting lecturers, film purchases, and videotape equipment. Chair- man Nelson conunented, \It is ~· ' rny hope that somewhere iii these funds some sort of fund wi'll be found to subsidize English activities.\ Mr. Robert Rasmussen, Vice President for College Resources, said that, because- of the finanda1 situation of the College, such a specific fllrid would be pos~ible and that the surplus from the grant would go into. the .general College en- M·iddle States: dowment. He said that the money must be put directly into the endowment so as to provide _ \more of a certainty that we can continue to finance the faculty of that department and the faculty as a whole.\ Mr. R3smussen added, however, that the English Department could request additional fimds, but that such a request would receive no special preference because of the Blodgett grant. Academic Report by PAUL FEINSO'f · The report of the Drafting Committee on Curricular Affairs, which is the last of the Middle States Association reports, has been completed. Because the report has not been released to the campus, the following piece has been largely excerpted from the draft. The introduction to the section titled. \Union·_ Curriculum: offerings available to Union students,.\ begins: For the acac;!emic year 1978-9, an average of 1984 full-time undergraduate students were in attendance. For those com- pleting their normal four-year span, these students will be in residence at Union for three 10 week-long terms per year (plus examination periods), taking three courses ·per term. Each course meets four . hours per week, or more (if a laboratory or studio course). It is notewrothy that the student body expanded rapidly from 1544 in 1968 to 1930 in 1973, but has remained level since. The expansion was deliberate; Union became coeducational in the interval. The number of courses of- fered in the 1978-79 year was 600. The Humanities provided 182, Arts 45, Socia! Sciences 138, Sciences 148, and Engineering 85. There were also 777 students who chose independent study as a course during the year. The report states: for a teaching faculty of 147.3 FTE, this seems to be a large number of separate courses. It is ex- plained partly by the three term ealenda.- and the lack of \year long courses,\ but may point to some over-commitment of faculty members to multiple course preparations per year. On the otll~r hand, froQl the students' point of view, Union, despite its small size, off~r5 a surprisingly diverse and rich array of courses. _ The draft cited how little the number and range of. depart- mental majors has altered in the last ten- years. The two majors eliminated were Geology and the Anthropology segment of Sociology. There was only one disciplinary major added: Theatre Arts. The discipline tnajors are seen as strong by the faculty: nevertheless the Educational Policy Committee has decided that a systematic set of reviews · (the· outside evaluations )perhaps on a quadrennial basis, could help the College even further in developing and improving the majors. As the report relates, there have been significant changes in the options of entering fresh· men. In the past, an enteripg freshman was expected to declare a major ._upon arrival. Today, there are abo'ut 150 entering freshmen who declare Liberal Arts in order to give themselves time to explore many areas of study. The draft further relates that ''there has been a marked in- crease in the numbers of in- terdepartmental and multidisciplinary majors made available. In 1968 there were no structured multidisciplinary majors offered (see Table III- 2) ; by 1973 ten had been in- troduced. The number remains the same in. 1979, through some individnal majors have been dropped and others introduced. The Educational Policy Committee is reviewing all these programs presentlY, and there is a view that some may be eliminated for want of continuing and sufficient in· Conttnued on page 3 the granting of tenurability to seven faculty members. Amid the proliferation of routine financial and academic decisions that emerged from this day of meetings, perh~ps most important was the vote to increase student charges a total of $700 for the next academic year. This figure reflects a $520 increase in tuition from $5000 to $5520, a $150 increase in room charges and a $30 increase in board. Not all need despair, however, the Board also voted to boost student aid by $240,000 or some 20 percent of the ad- ditional revenues to be derived from the increased charges, . and also voted to boost the total compensation package for . College employees by 10.4 percent of the current year compensation budget. The increase in student charges results from, but does not parallel inflation, and rising tuition costs at comparable institutions. In other action by the Board, seven faculty members were granted tenurability status. Two of the appointments, Ingrida Dambergs of the Library and Terry Weiner of the Sociology Department, were approved for tenure. The remaining five-Bruce Reynolds and Shelton Schmidt in Economics, Yu Chang and Frank Milillo in Engineering, and Robert Baker in Philosophy--were given tenurability stattlS. In action brought forward from last year, the status of Charles Steckler in the Arts Department was changed from tenurability to tenured. These decisions were made only after a careful examination of· the reports prepared on canapus by a special Trustee committee. Other changes in ap- pointments included the naming of David Peak as Acting Chairman of the Physics Department and the designation of William Thomas as the Director of Term Abroad Programs. The Board was sorry to note the resignations of Virginia Bush and Mordechei Sheinkman from the Arts Department. The Academic Affairs Committee also reviewed the policy of tuition remission for faculty and staff. It was noted -that this is an important tool for recruiting potential faculty - members and has marginal, if any, effect on the cost of a Union College education as only about twelve students are enrolled in the program in any given year. President Morris; address to the full Board highlighted a number of areas of interest. At top was a status report on the proposed Governance system. The President noted that the Governance report, which is presently being voted on by the faculty, will be brought before the Trustees for final con- sideration at the April Board meeting. The implementation date for this system has been advanced from January 1, 1980 to September 1930 in order to facilitate the transition from our present system. The Board was also informed that a team from the Middle States Association will conduct its campus visit in February. The group will review the sell- evaluation the college has undergone during the last two years as part of the ac- creditation process. At present, the Admissions situation appears pr.omising with no decline in the- applicant pool noted and an increase in those expressing interest in the Liberal Arts and Engineering fields. Dr. Morris also noted that having acquired the necessary nucleus funds, ·the \Campaign for UQion,\ or less eloquently, the Endowment Drive, will officially be made public at the April Board meeting. Union hopes to amass thirty-eight million dollars through this campaign by 1985- a move designed to double our endowment and bring us more into line (in terms of en- dowment dollars per student) with the institutions that we are most often compared to. As a final note, the President made note of two hirings. Jack Hill has been installed as Director of Buildings and Grounds and Joseph Wirth asswned Tom Cahill's position as head foot- ball coach. Wirth comes to Union with a string of suc- cessful seasons at Holy Cross, Colgate, and most recently, Brown. In other business, the Board reelected its p~~esent slate of officers for another term. Dr. Day remains Chairman, Thomas Hanigan, Vice- Chairman, Arthur Vash, Secretary, and Arnold Burns, General Council. The Board was generally pleased with the positive at- titude of the campus and the operation of the administration under Dr. Morris. The smoothness of the Board meeting was a tribute to that fact.

Unfortunately in the late 1970's the administration under President Bonner discontinued this recep- tiveness, which ultimately led to major problems. True, the unrest that we students feel ~t this time may not be compatible with that felt by the students of the early 1970's.

( Disputes Delay New Governance by KEN PLUMB Student Body President The implementation of the proposed new governance system, originally scheduled for January 1, has now been postponed until the next academic year. The delay has occurred ~ecause the Student Forum and the faculty have been unable to reach an agreement on some of the key proposals contained in the report. Disputes have arisen between the F orUIJl and the faculty in tbe following areas: (1) The Sub- Council on Student Conduct-the students desired a membership of :9 students and one ad- ministrator acting as an ad- visor, while the faculty voted to place a faculty member on the Sub-Council (2) The Faculty Review Board--the Student Forum would like to see 2 students on the Board with full voting rights while most of the faculty are against the idea. (3) The Student Affairs Council-the Student Forum voted to delete section 5b3 of the report which would give the council the authority to \assume broad, overall responsibility for policy affecting all student activities .. . \ The faculty, meanwhile,. voted not to delete that section of the report. In addition, the faculty have yet to agree on the proper method for handling appeals from the Faculty Review Board. Poor attendance has also slowed down the procedure, with the ·faculty unable to achieve a necessary quorum for their last two meetings. Attempts are presently being made by the Drafting Com- mittee and tbe administration to obtain the necessary com- promises so that the final report can be .sent to the Board of Trustees with the approval of both the Student Forum and the faculty. Additional information concerning the progress of the report can be obtained by contacting any Forum member. Middle States Report On Academic Affairs • • • Continlled ftom page 1 structional commitment along with weak student interest. On the other hand, it has been noted that such programs sometimes appear attractive to many freshmen who, once at Union, change to a disciplinary major.\ . The decline in majors in the · . Arts and Uunanities is ap- parent. It is interesting to note that the predicted sharp in- crease in these as a result of coeducation bas simply not come to pass. On the other band, without W()men students, even lower student-percentages would be ~epresemted in these majors, since higher per- centages of W(lmen students major her ethan in (lther majors (excepting Psychology). Social Sciences, overall! has held its own, thoagh primarily due to a sharp i11crease in Political Science majors (probably related to the interest in pre- La.w). The apparent drop in the Sciences is not really so: 40 students in 1978 took Science (often Chemistry-Biology or Biology-Psychology), and another group elected Science- Social Science combinations (e.g., Psychl)logy·Sociology, and Biology-Political Sdence). The startling gro-wth over the past five years has been in Engineering and Computer Science majors. Union appears to attract a relatively large percentage &f women engineering students; the present senior CJlass contains 22 percent, as high as any in New York State. The pf'esent Liberal learning system, which was introduced in 1977, is described in the report as something which the majority of the facUlty \en- dorsed. -warmly.\ In ordet· to develop this pro-gram the faculty -worked to identify the \characteristics and com• peteneies of tbe 'liberally educated person.' \ Courses were required in six identified areas, and the student can choose courses from all disciplines :(the College asks that the student spend learning time engaged in studies across the spectrum of knowledge). Most students start in the freshman year -with a Fresh- man Preceptorial course (it is hoped to req11ire this starting in 1980-81), as a structured in· troduction to the meaning of 'liberal learning. Thus, small classes meet with selected faculty from all disciplines to discuss and critique a conunon reading list (ranging from Plato and Biology, technology and ahthropology; see Academic Narratives book).A major goal is to. require students to write extensively ~md to work on i~provement of the quality of that writing. Furthermore, distinguished lecturers give three lectures a term, at which the attendance of all students in the course is expected. Faculty members and students rep(Jrt favorably on the educational value of the Freshman Preceptorial Program. The second part of the report is concerned with the academic development of the students. The problems of the advising system are highlighted in the opening section. Here, the draft cites both faculty and student reluctance to make the system work. The report states, however, that \it appears that almost~au students seek advice from • and talk with their supervisor periodically.'' Most faculty members at Union take their advising responsibilities seriously; there is no formal recognition of outstanding service in this area, though mention is made of good service and heavy loads in annual evaluations. The load is very unevenly divided across the faculty, depending on the number 6f majors per full-time faculty member in any department. Special additional advising is available for e.g., pre-law, pre-medicine and pre- business school students. The committee had much discussion on the grading practices and on student anxiety over grades. They found that faculty members essentially bemoan competition for grades amongst the students. Prior to 1978-79 grade distributions at Union had shown a gradual upward trend. In '78-'79, the grade distribution for all completed course letter grades was as follows: a, A-~ 4934; B+, B, B-: 7155; C+, C, C- : 3418; D: 624; F: 264; Total: 16,395. There were only 259 (1.6 percent) \Pass-Fail.\ · Students at Union must take 36 courses to graduate with a .B.A. or B.S. degree. Although IDOSt courses consist of four class periods (50 minutes) per week (for ten weeks), courses , m.ay also carry laboratory class-hours which normally are taken in addition to four lecture or recitation hours. The student receives no additional credit towards graduation for such laboratory work. In addition to class-time, students are ex- pected, on the average, to put in an adlJitional eight hours of library w&rk or study for each course. This means, of course, that those disciplines where laboratory work is required necessitate more \in-class time\ than do others. There is no easy solution to this, since science and engineering faculty are required to bring students a very long way in four years both educationally and in terms of technical training. Thus, particularly in Engineering, the College actually provides a professiona 1 training (since graduates go directly into professional engineering jobs) as well as a pre-professional and liberal arts education. It is not surprising, therefore, that Engineering faculty (in line with Engineers' Council for Professional Development sentiments) are uneasy with the relatively low number of con- tad hours with which engineering students graduate. Recently, the college bas passed a requirement of up to 37.5 courses for Engineering students (rather than 36), but the tension remains: bow can Engineering students in a Liberal Arts College attain sufficient depth in- Engineering and breadth in the Liberal Arts without moving to a five-yea; program? The final third of the report is devoted to the faculty. It begins Within an overall profile of the teaching faculty. The faculty is made up of 139 fulltime members in residence' ('78-'79 statistics), The draft notes that \after iniUal growth of the student body, the faculty size has remained stable (1973: 132, 1978: 139). There is a dramatic but . not surprising demon- stration that the faculty is aging (average age 1968: 39.8 years, · 1978: 43.9 years) and it is becoming increasingly tenured or tenurable (1968: 45 percent, 1978: 51 percent plus 10 percent post-tenurability contract). The percentage of the faculty who are Assistant Professors and Instructors has declined from 43 percent to 33 percent in ten years. Thus, it can be seen that there are fewer younger faculty members replacing retiring or leaving faculty members. The Unlon College faculty sees itself clearly as primarily a teaching faculty.· By faculty vote, it established unequivocally tbat each in- dividual faculty member must have a very substantial weighting of his or her total evaluation (.for salary pur- poses) on teaching. Never- theless, scholarly activity is valued very highly and there is the generally held belief on this faculty that no faeulty member can perform to the best of his tr her ability unless the teachirlg goes alongside an active program in research. This, coupled with an unusually demanding (in time) gover· nance system, makes the Union faculty a heavily w.orked one. The committee found that teaching loads were perceived by many faculty members as rather uneven from department to department. The differences tended to arise because of different department sizes. Faculty teac bing \work- load\ data over several years has been collected and was to be -presented here in a form from which some conclusions and pointers for future planning might have been drawn. Despite a year's staff work with persons in the Computer Center, the work bas not yet reached beyond the gathering of the raw data. Even though results will not be ready for this report, wodt is preceding and in time, the College will have this type of information to nse as it plans its curriculum for the next d'ecade. Union has developed a quite strong budgetary commitment to support the professional activities of faculty members. There are internal funds available to support research efforts: those applying with well-documented needs nor- mally receive a positive response (normally up to $1000). Travel funds are available to cover travel and a modest per diem to professional ~eetings, Sabbaticals may be applied for every 7 yrs. (half- pay for one year; full pay for one-half year) and are nonnally granted when the projected research or educational program has merit. Union College receives a large Mellon Foundation grant for support of faculty development. Since its inception in 1975, 35 faculty members have had released time from part of their teaching duties and several valuable faculty syn:tposia around dif- ferent academic topics have been conducted. Many departments run seminar series or at least invite occasional distinguished visitors to campus. These visits provide further important opportunities for Union faculty to engage in intellectual discourse with professionals other than their immediate Union colleagues. There have been occasional opportunities to invite distinguished visitors for a term on endowed funds: notable is the Washington Irving Chair. Recent incumbents have been Gary W llls and Larzer Ziff in 1977 ao.d 1978 respectively. Expanded opportunities of this sort would be valuable for Union. As we see an in- creasingly less mobile faculty, opportunities for intellectual interaction with \outside\ colleagues wlll become more and more important to maintain the vigor of our academic community. It should be noted that Union's \internal Education Fund\ of $100,000 or more per annum. has provided excellent opportunities for faculty members to devise and develop or pa1ticipate in new courses and programs. This too should be seen as an important type of faculty development. There are not at t}lis time any ad- ministrative resources ear- marked for assistance to faculty members seeking 9utside research funding. The going will clearly be cautious before risking the de- emphasizing of the primacy of teaching. As yet, the College has not been able to draw up an \educational mission statement.\ And the remainder of the report consists largely of trite cant (as does most of it), which is not (despite the feelings of the majority) 'Singluar to Union College.

d s OONOORDIENSIS~ January 17, 1980 !Page 3 Forum. Meets: Tax Questions The Stadent Forum met for the first time this term with the approval of the budgets for aU organizations and activities,the major item on the agenda. After a brief report by Assistant Dean of Students Mike Andolina conceming the possibility of having Forwn members atter:~d several local eonfcrences on student government; the Forum began its discussion of the budgets. Tax Committee Chairman Mike Brand presented the budgets and after extensive debate the following conclusions were reached. First, all members agreed that both the method of allocating student tax funds and the entire budgeting procedures in general were in need of substantial improvements. The responsibility for improving the present system was delegated to the Student Committee on Governance which began meeting late last term and is scheduled to provide a revised Student Body Constitution by the middle of this term. Second, after considerable debate concerning the \role\ of the Forum in the actual budgeting process and the · . accuracy of many of the figures presented, Chairman Brand was asked to return next week with the budgets presented in a new format. Thus, the matter of actually improving the budgets \' will be discussed again next .8 week. c ~ After some brief discussion \' concerning the proposed new ~ governance system the Forum t; adjourned. The next meeting is o scheduled for Monday, January i 21 in room 310 Carnegie. Starting time is 7:30. Forum members at meeting, Disputes Delay New Governance by KEN PLUMB Student Body President The implementation of the proposed new governance system, originally scheduled for January 1, has now been postponed until the next academic year. The delay has occurred because the Student Forlill1 and the faculty have been unable to reach an agreement on some of the key proposals contained in the report. Disputes have arisen between the Forwn and the faculty in the followiHg areas: (1) Tb.e Sub- Council on Student Conduct-the students desired a membership of 9 students and one ad- ministrator acting as an ad- visor, while the faculty voted to place a faculty member on the Sub-CounciL (2) The Faculty Review Board--the Student Forum would like to see 2 students on the Board with full voting rights while most of the faculty are against the idea. ( 3) The Student Affairs Council-the Student Forum voted to delete section 5b3 of the report which would give the council the authority to \assume broad, overall responsibility for policy affecting aU student activities .. . \ The faculty, meanwhile, voted not to delete that section of the report. In addition, the faculty have yet to agree on the proper method for handling appeals from the Faculty Review Board. Poor attendance has also slowed down the procedure, with the faculty unable to achieve a necessary quorum for their last two meetings. Attempts are presently being made by the Drafting Com- mittee and the administration to obtain the necessary com- promises so that the final report can be sent to the Board of Trustees with the approval of both the Student Forwn and the faculty. Additional information concerning the progress of the report can be obtained by contacting any Forum member. Middle States Report On Academic Affairs. Continued from page 1 structional commitment along with weak student interest. On the other hand, it has been noted that such programs sometimes appear attractive to many freshmen who, once at Union, change to a disciplinary major.\ Tht' decline in majors in the Arts and Humanities is ap- parent. It is interesting to note that the predicted sharp in- crease in these as a result of coeducation has simply not come to pass. On the other hand, without women students, even lower student-percentages would be represented in these majors, since higher per- centages of women students major here than in other majors (excepting Psychology). Social Seiences. overall, has held its own, though primarily due to a sharp increase in Political Srience majors (probably related to the interest in pre- Law 1. The apparent drop in the Sciences is not really so: 40 stud£>nts in 1978 took Science (often Chemistry-Biology or Biology-Psychology), and another group elected Science- Social Science combinations (e.g., Psychology-Sociology, and Biology-Political Science). The startling growth over the past five years has been in Engineering and Computer Scienre majors. Union appears to attract a relatively large percentage of women engineering students; the present senior class contains 22 percent, as high as any in New York State. The present Liberal learning system, which was introduced in 1977, is described in the report as something which the majority of the faculty \en- dorsed warmly.\ In order to develop this program the faculty worked to identify the \characteristics and com- petencies of the 'liberally educated person.' \ Courses were required in six identified areas, and the student can choose courses from all disciplines (the College asks that the student spend learning time engaged in studies across the spectrum of knowledge). Most students start in the freshman year with a Fresh- man Preceptorial course (it is hoped to require this starting in 1980-81 )., as a structured in- troduction to the meaning of liberal learning. Thus, small classes meet with selected faculty from all disciplines to discuss and critique a common reading list (ranging from Plato and Biology, technology and ahthropology; see Academic Narratives book). A major goal is to require students to write extensively and to work on improvement of the quality of that writing. Furthermore, distinguished lecturers give three lectures a term, at which the attendance of all students in the course is expected. Faculty members and students report favorably on the educational value of the Freshman Preceptorial Program. The second part of the report is concerned with the academic development of the students. The problems of the advising system are highlighted in the opening section. Here, the draft cites both faculty and student reluctance to make the svstem work. The report states, however, that \it appears that almost all students seek advice from and talk with their supervisor periodically.\ Most faculty members at Union take their advising responsibilities seriously; there is no formal recognition of outstanding service in this area, though mention is made of good service and heavy loads in annual evaluations. The load is very unevenly divided across the faculty, depending on the number of majors per full-time faculty member in any department. Special additional advising is available for e.g., pre-law, pre-medicine and pre- business school students. The committee had much discussion on the grading practices and on student anxiety over grades. They found that faculty members essentially bemoan competition for grades amongst the students. Prior to 1978-79 grade distributions at Union had shown a gradual upward trend.

Page 4 CONOORDIENSIS, January 11, 1980 art6 Mitch's Maze ~u~~~ Top Ten Records by ROBERT BLAKE Well, here are my choices for the top ten albums of 1979. In general, I feel '79 was a bad year for long established bands, but a fine year for younger, fresher bands who produced wo1~k that shows a great deal of creativity and power. This shows that as we move into the eighties we wiH hopefully have. pop music that is far more vital and compelling than the muck that the disco and techno-rock ~f. the seventies degenerated mto. Glancing over this list one 'will most likely find a nwnber of groups he or she has never heard of before. I have picked Masters Studied The works of acknowledged masters in orchestral music and American literature will be studied and discussed in two non~credit courses at Union this winter. ''A freshness to the familiar and an insight into the unknown\ is what instructor Angela Fitzpatrick is offering in a course entitled \Masterpieces of Orchestral Music.\ Fitz- patrick's course will be held from 7:30 to 9:30 iJ.\m. eight Tuesdays starting Feb. 12. Tuition is $60. In particular, '' Mastel'pieces of Orchestral Music\ will be an in-depth study of classic symphonic compositions sur- veying orchestral sthles from 1750 to 1950. Included will be works by Stravinsky, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert · and Bruckner. Fitzpatrick, who bas a ·Creative Arts Are Here · bachelor's. degree in music from Skidmore College, was formerly education director of the Saratoga Performing Arts Center and a programmer and announcer with WMH'l'-FM. She conducts several choral groups in the capital district. Masters of another genre- American literature--will be surveyed in a non-credit course entitled ''Three American Masters: Hawthorne, James and Faulkner.\ Express yourself through prose, poetry or the performing arts at Union College this winter. Courses entitled \Creative Writing,\ \Poetry Workshop\ and \Theater Workshop: Acting, \Directing and Pkaywriting\ are among the 23 non-credit courses offered at Union beginning the week of Feb. 4. drawn upon by the poet. Lifshin will talk about publishing, poetry as performance and favorite authors, and class participants will try writing to music. . Poetry workshop classes will be held from 7 to 9 p.m .. eight Wednesdays starting Feb. 20. Tuition is $60. A third creative arts course offered at Union this winter will focus on three aspects of the theater-acting, directing, and playwriting. Instructor Gaynor F. Bradish, a visiting associate professor at Union, has designed the course to be flexible in order to address the interests of individual par- ticipants. Bradish was formerly cljrector of the Department of Dramatic Literature, Theater History and the Cinema at New York University's Washington Square College. In addition to writing scenes or one-acf plays for workshop performance, class members will attend and discuss several productions by local and visiting theater groups. Classes will be held from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. ten Mondays starting Feb. 4 and tuition is $60. For more information on these courses, or any of the 20 other non-credit offerings, contact Union's Graduate Studies and Continuing Education office, Wells House, 1 Uhion Ave., Schenectady 12308 (telephone 37~288). ' Registrations are now .being accepted for all courses. The course will be taught by \Inion College adjunct associate professor Patrick Allen from· 7 to 9 p.m. ten Tuesdays starting Feb. 5. Tuition is $60. The focus of Allen's course will 'be an analysis of developments in fiction over a period ·of three generations. Also, the relationship of those developments to the cultural and historic traditions of the times will be discussed. To register or obtain further information, contact Union's · Graduate Studies and Con- tinuing Education office, Wells House, 1 Union Ave., Schenectady 12308 (telephone 370-6288). A free brochure describing 23 non-credit courses is available. \Corne and write! \ is the invitation extended by creative writing course instructor Nancy L. Thornton to writers and would-be writers regardless of experience. In addition to teaching creative writing courses at Union and the College of St. Rose in Albany, Thornton is an instructor of creativity and writing courses for the General Electric Co. and is a technical writing consultant for Power Technologies, Inc., Schenectady. Participants in Thornton's course will produce their own works of fiction, non-fiction or poetry. Classes will be held from 7 to 9 p.m. eight Th1.lr=>days starting Feb. 7, and tuition is $60. Books For The Adventuresome Poetry will be explored in more depth in Lin Lifshin's \Poetry Workshop.\ A resident of Niskayuna and the author of more than 20 books of poetry, L.ifshin is again offering this course at Union as a \place where poets can be helped to say what they want in a way that ls specially theirs.\ The course will explore how sources as diverse as the news and eavesdropping can be For your after-the-holidays leisure reading, before summer vacation planning becomes a pressing necessity, here are four great paperback travel books: 1980 Adventure Holidays, the Travellers Sur- vival Kit: Europe, Kibbutz Volunteer and 1980 Overseas Summer Jobs. All are distributed by Writer's Digest Books. 1980 Adventure Holidays (220 pages, $6.95) is a directory of exciting things to do that or- dinary travel guides don't in- clude. Like canoeing, rafting, 1st Act: Bill Brinner 2nd Act: Andy levine Jack Donahue Joe Uvegos Tickets on sale 8 p.m. in Carne·gie cycling, gliding, hiking, sailing, scuba diving, skiing, hang gliding, surfing, safaris-and more. Short excursions or month-long trips are listed. 1980 Adventure Holidays will help you find the place to do it, tell you who to contact and how much it will cost. This is the place to find out about safaris to Tanzania, schooner voyages on the North Sea, overland tours through India, zoological ex- peditions in the Yucutan peninsula, and rafting in New Guinea. The newly revised 1000-81 edition of the Travellers Sur- vival Kit (192 pages, $6.9a) was written and updated by Europeans who know the ins and outs of travel in that part of the world from a closer vantage point than the authors of most U.S. travel books. Thirty-seven European countries (including the Warsaw Pact nations) are covered plus details on passports, visas, m()lley, transportation, accommoda- tions, communications, health, hygiene and help and in- formation. Kibbutz Volunteer by John Bedford (128 pages, $6.95) is now available in the revised aod enlarged 1980-81 edition. Bedford has worked on Kibbutz Megiddo for a total of two years. -Kibbutz Volunteer tells about working Qn the 200 kibblitzim of Israel; who to contact, what jobs are available, what's free, what languages are spoken and m:ore. Several chapters deal with money, laws, customs and tell you how to see the country as an insider. 1980 Overseas Jobs ( 168 pages, $6.95) gives details on 50,000 summer jobs all over the world from Austria to Yugoslavia. Working abroad is a great way to spend the summer in a place you couldn't otherwise afford to visit. And it's an excellent way to get to know a place in a way that a casual, aloof tourist never can. Listings tell you who to contact, describe the jobs available, and give details on visas and working papers.

I hope that some inquisitive reader out tnere might, upon reading my capsule descriptions, have his interest aroused to trust the opinion of one who listens to a great deal mote music than the average person, and go out and try one of these albums from a struggling artist who desperately needs more sup- port. In this way I hope I might have turned someone on to a new artist that the listener will find both enjoyable and rewarding. Here, then, in order of my subjective preference, are my choices: 1. Graham Parker: \Squeezing Out Sparks\-- Parker- totally leaves behind his earlier rhythm and blues in• fluences and instead goes for an album of straight ahead rock with highly personal lyrics. He more than realize!! his potential on this album of unending wit and power. 2. Neil Young: \Rust Never Sleeps\-Not a bad cut on here. Young uses his many influences in producing this superb album that serves as a testanaent to Young's being among the decade's very best performers and songwriters. 3. The Roches: \The Roches\-! don't know what I like best about this group. It could be th.e charm of their lyrics, the innovation of their arrangements, or the chilling sound of their piercing har- monies. A very mellow and beautiful album. 4. Talking Heads: \Fear of Music\--Their .most radical work to date. The Heads create a new aesthetic in these songs that are all powerful, funny, and · exceptionally creative and clever at the same time. 5. Frank Zappa: \Sheik Yerbouti\-The debut album on Zappa's own label, and his best in years. Zappa the composer, the guitarist, and the arranger are all present here in their strongest forms. It is profane, funny, and energetically played. 6. Tom Verlaine: \Tom Verlaine\-His first solo album since the breakup of Television. His unique and passionate guitar playing matches his talent at composing equally unique and passionate songs. 7. John Cale: \Sabotage\- His first and best album in years. Cale, formerly of the Velvet Underground, combines classical, avant-garde, and new-wave ideas better than anyone has ever done, or at- tempted to do. 8. Pink Floyd: \The Wall\- The Floyd don't really explore any new directions in their music here, but \The Wall\ presents a very clever and complex concept, in yet another exceptionally well constructed Pink Floyd album. An in-depth review will follow in the coming weeks. , - 9. Blondie: \Eat to the Beat\- -A thoroughly enjoyable and eclectic album. Blondie shows that just because a band's music is simple does not mean that they have to sacrifice their creativity or mastery of many styles because of it. 10. The A's: \The A's\-This new band from Philadelphia is something like the Boomtown Rats,. only better on record, and they lean towards a teenage temperment in their lyrical contents. These are new-wavers with wit, energy, charm, and very sophisticated arran- tements that all combine to make their music come alive. c I s. s (1 , colt ran Me1 the A rna: ne~ incl eph Hoi cos the: siz~ StUI Di~ jud the sci~ fut1 s aw. .off be poi POI an< Kh of: re~ thE an4 Ca ha: ha: aw wh fie etc 1 1 w u w m bl w -(l ir tl dl Vi \1 tl F ~s t: s \ b 0

B·ust: Star Tr.ek & The Black Hole by KYLE BRESSLER (In the months ahead this , column will deal with movies, ranking them ·on a 5 Nott Memorial scale, with 5 being the most desirable.) As usual during the Christ- mas season, a large number of new movies were released, including two science fiction epics, Star Trek and The Black Hole. At a combined production cost of over 60 million dollars, these two movies re.present a sizable investment by their studios (Paramount and Walt DisAey, respectively)., and judging by how well they fare, they may set standards for science fiction movies in the future. Star 'l).\ek .one of the most awaited movies of 1979 in terms .of fan anticipation, turns out to be a. tremendo11s disap- pointment. With the cast of the popular 1960's. TV series intact and the addition of Persis Khambatta who plays the role of a bald female navigator (she resembles a hard boiled egg), the Enterprise is sent out on another mission. Only this time, Captain Kirk (William Shatner) has become an admiral, and he has to wrest his old position away from a stubborn officer w'Qicb he does with little dif- ficul{y. Scotty, Spock, Uhura; etc., each arrive at a separ~te portion to a .great deal of ap- plause from their fans in the audience. The problem here is that in trying to appease the trekkies and trekkers (diehard Star trek fans), director Robert Wise has not left much of a movie for anyone else. The picture drags on while the camera focuses endlessly on Shatner's face or the spaceship Etl.terprise. Thoughthere is a clever ending, the blase acting and poor writing have put three-quarters of the audience to sleep (this is not to mention the extremely bad make-up jobs and 'Over- dubbed scores). The one factor that gives this movie a ray of hope is the special effects work of John Dykstra and Richard Trumble. Veterans of such flicks as 2001 · A Spac~ Odyssey and Star Wars, they have created the greatest special effects ever shown on a screen. Because of them, Star Trek gets '* . The Black Hole is Walt Disney's first venture into uon- G-rated territory, and in tliis reviewer's opinion, they, should stay out of it. The basic story is ~that of a probe sent into deep space where is encounters a huge ship (the Gygnus) resetfibling an intergalactic greenhou.se. From there the story goes downhill, with the Union Artist Unveils Work A major sculpture by Elbert Weinberg, artist in residence at Union College, will stand in Wilmington, Del., as a . memorial to the Holocaust. Comprised of three life-size, bronze figures--a man, a woman, and a mother and child- -and a trio of 15-foot ·high, irregularly-shaped colwnns, the memorial was recently dedicated in Freedom Plaza, which stands in the center of Wilmington's Civic Center. Weinberg, commissioned for this work , by the Jewish Federation of Delaware, has ~sculptures on display ?-round the country, including the statue of Justice, wliich stands ~ before :J3oston University School of Law.

I WRUC: Update by ANDREA ~OWERS The surge of energy which has enabled Union's radio station, WRUC, to expand its influence on campus and in the community has not diminished but in fact continues to thrive. While the station still awaits a major decision from the F .C. C. which would allow WRUC a 100- watt license, a host of other improvements are under way. These ~improvements involve developments in programs as well as further expansion of the station's facilities. follow a series of other major developments which were in progress over the summer. Summer staff members have refurbished the station. Now the station consists -of a series of studios, each with its own specialized function. Last spring-term, the effort to apply for a 100-watt license was initiated. Perhaps the most important aspect- about all changes made last year and last swmner is that they have created new impetus for further changes. The energy that this staff brings Continued on p_age 10 Iowa Caucuse~ Monday by ROBERT BYRNES - On Monday, January 21st, Democrats and Republicans throughout the state of Iowa will meet in the first official step of the presidential selection process. That Monday i:o; only the beginning and it will · sur- prise many people who are already tired of the cam- paigning and headlines of the past year. The' campaigning will grow much more intense and important in the next ten months. Iowa will be the first real battleground for the dozen or so committed candidates. The state also provides a fine demonstration -of the grassroots support and organization, because the neighborhood meetings at Iowa's 2,531 voting precincts are a first step to the eventual selection of Iowa's 47 Republican National Con- vention delegates and .50 Democratic convention delegates. It was Jimmy Carter's im- pressive showing in. the 1976 Iowa caucuses that showed the nation his grassroots appeal and helped establish him as a serious candidate over more seasoned and well-known politicians. This year Carter is hoping to repeat his success of four years .ago, but there are many others who hope that Iowa is the beginning of the end for the President. Democrats Teddy Kennedy, senator from Massachusetts, and Jerry Erown, governor -of California, are two who hope to top Carter in the caucuses. Kennedy's popularity as a presidential candidate has decreased considerably since -he topped all of the polls several months ago. Part of this has been due to President Carter's renewed popularity and support as he deals with difficult situations in Iran and Afghanistan. But a- lot of it is Kennedy's own fault-he hasn't been able to adequately defend his actions at Chappaquiddick and, in one particularly memorable instance, put his foot in his mouth with a poorly- timed attack on the Shah . Brown has the support of girlfriend Linda Ronstadt, as well as Helen ~eddy and even Jane Fonda, but his support among voters at the grassroots and organizational level is minimal. Carter faces a true cha11enge in Iowa. Ordinarily, with his Iran-inflated popularity still running high, he should have no problem beating the liberal _ Kennedy and the unusual\ Brown in conservative Iowa. But his recent decision to halt grain sales to the Soviet Union may very well hurt him in the farm belt, and his Democratic opponents, as well as the Republicans in the other set of caucuses (with the exception of Illinois Congressman John Anderson) are trying to play this to their advantage. Carter is still expected to win in Iowa, but it will be interesting to see\ how much his policies weaken ' him and strengthen h~ op- ponents. On the Republican sid~, the acknowledged front-runner is Ronald Reag·a-n, the con- servative former governor of Ci;llifornia. Rea,gan . should do well in Iowa, but the crop of challengers hoping to be the next. Republican presidential candidate see him as vulnerable. They include Senators Howard Baker of Tennesee and Robert Dole of Kansas, former Texa& governor and Treasury Secretary John Connally, Representatives Anderson and Philip Crane of Illinois, and George Bush, was has held an array of Washington jGbs. Of this group, Bush has been the rising star in pre- primary campaigning. Bush is a former congressman from Texas, former Cabinet member, for- mer C.I.A. director, former Republican National Chairman, and businessman. He's used his past contacts to build a strong. network of supporters who -so far have provided Bush with one of the best organizations of any of the candidates. The Iowa caucuses will demonstrate if that organization is extensive and powerful enough to stop Reagan. The Iowa caucuses on Monday may be only the first step in the 1980 presidential campaign, but they are a very_ important 'step :which will do much to shape the campaigns in the corning months. Watch them carefully--remember what happened in Iowa .in 1976. The station hopes to sponsor an interview with President Morris. This could take the format of a call-in interview where students would be able to telephone in to the station, pose questions and have President Morris respond to them over the air. There are prospects of printing a program guide featuring all the individual radio shows and their particular focuses in music. The trivia contest will again make its annual apperance this winter over WRUC. Infirmary TemporarilY Short-Handed As for the station's physical layout, a new record-reviewing room has just been completed. This room enables the D.J.s to preview their musical selec- tions and to sample new promotional records. As the station receives, on the average, twelve promotional records per day, the record- reviewing room will facilitate this task immensely. As it stands now, WRUC can provide twenty-one hou~s of entertainment, lacking only three hours to make them an around-the-clock station. To encourage more station par- ticipants and to aid the existing worl~ers, the staff bas em- barked upon a campaign to simplify and improve the station logs. These logs, which are the station's manuals, are utilized by everyone who handles station equipment. In an effort to raise money fall-term, WRUC sponsored Rock Movie. However, un- satisfactory projection facilities detracted from the event. Since this is an event which WRUC would like to see work, im- provements in the projection capacity _are being investigated. All these improvemen~s 464 State St. we deliver by PAM RYAN Due to a recent resignation and a retirement, the College Health Service at Silliman Hall is currently short-handed. Mrs-:\ Margaret McDonald, the Service's secretary, has retired, while Ms. Carolyn Littell, Physician's Assistant, has resigned to take anot)Jer position. According to Mrs. Doris Richards, Director of the IIealth Service, these positions have not been filled. However, candidates for both positions have been interviewed, and a decision will probably be made this week. Mrs. McDonald has ·been the secretary at the infinnary for twelve years and is known by many of the students. She is currently on \extended sick leave\ from the college due to eye problems which started last spring, and is being treated by Retinal Associates in Boston. Mrs. Richards has been in- terviewing prospective replacements for Mrs. ·McDonald, and a selection will probably be made within the neKt week. · Ms. Littrell, who came to Union last February as a Physician's Assistant, has left for a full~year position at the Schenectady City Jail (the position at Union is on.y a 3-4 year). A Physician's Assistant is able to diagnose and treat \minor acute illnesses,\ and Schenectady 374-1888 according to Mrs. Richards. student feedback was very favorable to having a person available during the day, rather than having to wait for doctor's hours. Instead of another Physician's Assistant, this position will be filled by -a Nurse-Practitioner. A Nurse- Practitioner has the same diagnostic and treatment skills as a Physician's Assistant, but is able to perform additional services as well. For example, the Nurse-Practitioner will be able to perform pelvic exams, \which thePbysician's Assistant could not do, as well as provide other women's services (in- cluding referral to a gynecologist for other than minor problems). The new Nurse-Practitioner will also continue the weight reduction club held on, Wednesdays, which was begun by Ms. Littrell. According to Mrs. Richards, there are- \two good can- didates\ for this position, between whom a c'hoice will be made this week. There are currently three staff members left at the Health Service. Mrs. Pat Little is still the Resident Nurse, and Mrs. Ann Damiano remains as Evening Nurse. Mrs. Richards, the Director of the Service, will remain until February, at which time she will leave temporarily to enroll in a· one- year Nurse•Practi'tio-n.er program at.Ellis Hospital. Upon her return to the Health Service next year, the college com- munity will have access to the services of two Nurse- Practitioners. There has also been a change of hours for the Health Service. - The hours.~will remain the Smie during the week, but due to an apparent lack of need on Saturday mornings the Saturday hours will be from 2:00 P.M.-8:00 P.M., rather than from 10:00 A.M.-8:00 P.M. Should an emergency arise during the hours when the in- firmary is not open, students should call SecQrity at 370..{}178. Vandals S-trike Dorm by ffiWIN MENTEEN A window was broken and three rooms were vandalized on January 5, just one day before Union students were scheduled to return from winter break. Vandals broke into the North side of Davidson dormitory by throwing a large cement block through a window of the Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity. Although nothing was removed from the fraternity itself, several .rooms on the third floor were broken open and money and jewelry were taken from three of those rooms. Mr. Cliff Wood, Director of Security, surmised that the break-in took place between 3:35 a.m., when the building was last reported secure, and 7:45 a.m., when a security of· ficer noticed the broken win- dow. When asked Why the vandalism had not been spotted earlier, Mr. Wood said that although students .are employed to do exterior · checks of the buildings between 6:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., the darkness and the fact that there were drapes covering the broken window caused the student patrol to miss seeing the damage. Upon discovery of the break- in the Schenectady Police were called and maintenance repaired all of the damage caused by the vandals. The Schenectady police told Mr. Wood that there had been seven burglaries in the area that day and it might have been the same people involved. Mr: Wood also _said that although there was a break-in this vacation, there were two during the same. period last year~ He feels that this year was an improvement over last and hopes to prevent any further vandalism in the future. • Mr. Cliff Wood, Dlr~ctor of Security \' '- ., -\ c j \' J Pol Uhi . rec 20 j WO Wa · Sin unt p.n UnJ Ave 'inf< J Ch< pro Tm anc Sell Ave Wa Alb vitE . inf1 FoJ J pre tar: fea Url p:n mu At an< \R• pre Pre s ch~ ho< de~ va1 qu: the bec the Na Vi(] thE thE thE gw it. it 1 pe. is • ge: plc tht SOl to VO C1J an foJ wl to 1 yo ur a

It has been announced that further testing of the bobsleds will be suspended until the Winter Olympics are over. In a prepared Statement, David G. Ullman, Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Faculty Advisor of the program, cited two reasons for the suspension of the testing . They are 1) a lack of control in the Union Bobsleds during test runs on the one mile Olympic Bobsled run in Lake Placid and 2) a .severely restricted testing time on the Olympic run.

On the first \run the sled overturned in the curve \Zig-Zag\. Neither of the men in the sled, Chris Cross and Bill Van Valken berg, were injured. Both men are Capital DL.:;trict residents who were in- strumental in the foundation of the Union Bobsled program. The sled, well-built and un- damaged, was ready to try again. Subsequent runs that day produced one other spill in the finish curve and two successful mns from the half-mile. According to Professor Ullman, it was evident that the sled was difficult to control during the successful runs. After some adjustments to the suspension, the _ sled was run again on December 4. Still showing control problems, it crashed in .~he ''Zig-Zag\. This lack of control and a tendency for the sled to tip over was surprising since last years sled was very stable and control was not a problem. After these initial mishaps the suspension of the testing was decided upon. According to Professor Ullman, \The operators of the bobrun and the American Bobsled Research Association (ABRA) engineers felt it was in the best interest of the Olympic effort, to allow those who have a chance of making the Olympic team as much of the track time as possible. In the interim the sleds will be modified and new instrumentation added.'' The causes of the control problems in the sleds are still not clear but according to one of the student engineers in the prpgram, a low steering ratio (turning the steering wheel a lot for a little runner movement) and a high center of gravity seem to be the two major problems. Ullman reasoned, \It was assumed, based on the n1eager data available that a very low steering ratio would be an asset. However, this has proved to be incorrect and the ratio is now being changed.\ Professor Ullman and the engineering students in tbe program were disappointed at the early failures,however their outlook for the future of the sled is optimistic .. Ullmah felt that ''In the rush to build sleds during the last.year and a half, many decisions were made on very little engineering data. With the pressure of the 1980 Olympics past, we can now use our new sleds with our in- strumentation to collect ac- celeration and force data, a first in bobsledding. This new data will help us to overcome our control problems and lead to the design of the better bobsled.\ Engineering student and Bobsled Program member, Amy Rosenfeld said ''As soon as the Olympics are over, we're going back up with the sleds to continue testing. Even though our sleds didn't fare so well in the initial testing, .some of our des~gn techniques such as the aerodynamic efficient body design, have been .showing up on other bobsleds.\ The Union College Bobsled Program was founded by 'the Capital District enthusiasts, Professor Ullman and Union engineering students. The Union Program has grown into the American Bobsled Research Association. The ABRA's principle goal is to bring bobsled design in line with present day technology. New bobsled innovations made by Union College engineering students in,!!lude a body design that has drastically increased aerodynamic efficiency, a new torsion-bar suspension, steering boxes and better bwnpers. 136 Jay Street Downtown Sc!'lenectady 346-2719 -.·Violence In Hockey- by DOUG SILVERSTEIN Some of the more attractive characteristics of progessional hockey are its fast style of play, developing parity and a wide variety of team styles and qualities. Unfortunately, during the last few years there has been a growing concern over the augmented violence in the National Hockey League. The violence is mostly damaging to the impressionable youth and the knowledgable fan, who see the finesse departing from the game and the fighting replacing it. This in addition to the danger it poses on the .players. Admittedly, violence is ap- pealing to the average fan, but is also damaging to the younger generation which admires these players as its heroes and watch them inflicting temporary and sometimes permanent damage to each other. An incident in- volving ex-Chicago Black Hawk Chico ·Maki ended his career· and almost his life, an un- fortunate incident ·for' a man who spent his whole life worl~ing towards a certain goal. As the young fan views violence, he is urged to imitate the ''model\ in a street gaJ:!le. The ensuing results can only be detrimental. The N.H.L. has itself con- tributed to the vehement style of play. Some of the rules are illogical. If a player hits another over the head with his stick, he may receive the same in· fraction as one who vocalizes unacceptable words to the referee. Too often, it is only after the injury or encounter that a player is penalized, which is too late for the victim in the hospital. Eventually a player will serve as a guinea pig to instigate a_ · thorough in- vestigation of violence in the N.H.L. Anybody willing to roffer their services? College hockey seems to have the perfect remedy for curbing outbursts.. A player who engages in an altercation im- mediately receives a .game misconduct, ana dependirig on the severity of the penalty, possibly an indefinite suspension. It bas proved to be an effective deterent and would. be a useful and · necessary imp 1 em en t aU o n Ln t o professional hockey. In ad- dition1 referees often watch the fight with the fans, in belief of Freud's catharsis theory. The only problem is th~t the theory has been heavily disputed during the past decade. Not to mention the damage the players do to each other in the interim. Those who do advocate violence in hockey claim that the fans -will be \turned off\ to the game if violence is halted. What is wrong with clean checking and body contact, or isn't that enough for release of pent Up aggressions? If you want to see a sadistic sport, watch a boxing match. The truth is that fans aspire to see a winner, and the violence may excite them, but a loser will not. For example, three years ago the Detroit Red Wings were second in the league in penalties and won about 25 percent of their games. In Detroit, a great hockey town, they averaged about 10,000 fans a game'. The next year the Red Wings made the playoffs and by year's end they played before sellout corwds. Success in the box fffice is impossib.le without a winner, just ask the Colorado Rockies, who rarely draw better than 8,000 a game. There have been encouraging oxens in recent years. The bully who was once a main force on each club seems to be playing a more minimal role in the game this year; nevertheless, the fighting persists. Players like Nick Fotiu, Dave Forbes, Dave Schultz, Jack McHilargey and Deimis Hextall became ex- pendable to their teams and were all practically given away. It seems as if the managements in the N.H.L. have come to the realization that players are unable to prodUce while in the penalty box. Their presence is not only damaging to the fan, but to the welfare of their team. It is obviously a team effort to make hockey an enjoyable but civil entertainment event. Hopefully the red tape can be cut, and for once the moral issue involved will overide the economic factors. In this situation, fan interaction is vital. Join with me, but it's going to be· a long, hard struggle. 'There's nothing to lose, no penalty will be served. -· I will now offer my less than expert opinion on Super Bowl XIV. At first glance this ap- pears to be a mismatcl., but that .is false. The Rams have the \homefield\ advantage, since the game is being played in Pasadena. They also have the hottest runner in the game, Wendell Tyler, who runs behind the suberb blocking of Fullback Cullen Bryant and an out- standing offensive line. Their defense, lead by an outstanding line and a formidable trio of linebackers (Brudizinski, Reynolds, and Jim Youngblood) is unprecedented. The Steelers have Bradshaw and Co. and an outstanding secondary, but who cares, Ferragamo won't throw unless desparate. This game will be decided in the trenches, between Pittsburgh's offensive line and L.A.'s defensive line. When F erragamo is -forced to throw, look for outstanding sophomore receiver Preston Dennard to burn a couple. Robin Cole cannot replace Jack Ham at linebacker for the Steelers, which could be ex- posable on flat passes to Tyler: At games end, the curtain will fall and: Johnny Carson· will no longer. joke about the Ram's inadequacies. Prediction: Los Angeles Rams-13; Pittsburgh Steelers- 10.

Amnesty Iqterp.ational, a worldwide independent movement, is dedicated· to alleviating the global pattern of human rights abuse. Through letter-writing and publicity campaigns, sending missions and trial observers and publishing special reports, Amnesty works to gain the freedom of prisoners . of con- science and seeks humane treatment for all prisoners and detainees. Since AI's formation in 1961, more than 13,000 prisoners of conscience have been released. As a result, Amnesty has received international recognition. The organization now has consultative status with the United Nations, the Organization of American States and the Council o.f Europe. In addition, its representatives have con- tributed research reports to U.S. congressional hearings. The organization received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977 as well as the United Nation's Human Rights Award in 1978. ~mne~ty has come a long way Quote Contest us poor, starving students. C. W.

Today the worldwide network embraces 200,000 volunteers, working in 123 countries. The organization is dedicated to exposing international violations of basic human rights, such as freedom of speech, assembly and thought. These rights have been dileneated in codes of .public international law and national constitutions. A prime example is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 19-ia. These legal precepts express rights which we as Americans often take for granted. Why should the Union community be concerned with this larger international movement? Prisoners of conscience are subject to mass arr.est, mock trials, torture and prolonged detention. These individuals. have not advocated violence, and yet, they meet with violent, inhumane treatment. Many Prisoners of Conscience are members of academic com- munities, persecuted for their criticisms of governmental policies. Imagine not being able to express your disfavor with public policies, because of the threat of torture of im- pr:isonment. An Amnesty Campus Net- work Chapter has been active at Union for two years: sponsoring speakers such as Ramsey Clark, organizing campus petition drives, and raising campus awareness of human rights violations. The campus chapter will begin its winter term efforts with an organizational meeting, Monday, January 21 at 8:00 p.m. in Carnegie Hall, second floor conference room. The chapter will also present the ''Artists for Amnesty\ exhibition series, including a poster sale, on January 22 and 23 from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. in Carnegie Hall. \Artists for Amensty\ is an opportunity to buy original art posters created exclusively for 'a new series of graphics by fifteen in- ternationally distinguished artists, such as Fernando Botero, Alexander Calder, David Hockney and Joan Mirf. Each poster costs $8.00 or two for $15.00. These posters have been published also in limited editions of 100 signed and numbered pieces, printed on special quality paper, (cost available upon request). Several prints are now in the Shaeffer Library display cases. These posters have been exhibited in such world-leading museums and galleries as the Stedelijk in Amsterdam, the Fundacio Miro, Barcelona; the Centre Beavbourg, Paris, the Nantenshi Gallery, Tokyo; the Andre Emmerich Gallery, New York, and in other cultural centers in the U.S. and abroad. When you buy a poster from the Artists for Amnesty Series, you are helping the crucial human rights efforts of AI, as well as acquiring an exceptional new work of graphic art. These artists have devoted time and effort without financial com- pensation. And all proceeds will go to AI USA and the Union College Campus Chapter. Update on Union College and AI: during the winter break, Amnesty International placed Union College \in the news,\ when Governor Carey proclaimed December 10, 1979 as \Human Rights Day\ in New York. The governor's official proclamation was donated to Shaeffer Library. The presentation was made by Professor Bruce Reynolds; Professor Robert Sharlet (Director of AI East European and Soviet Coordination Group); and John Cimino (Chairmen of the Capital District Chapter of AI). Library Director Jean Pelletiere ac- cepted the gift, which is now on display in the library. ,In the proclamation, Governor Carey commends AI for their \conM tinued efforts in the promotion and protection of human rights.\ Every member of the campus community has the opportunity to become associated with and coo~ili~e to thls i~ ternationally renowned organization. Please contact the following students for ad- ditional information: Laune Breachev (393-0252), Jon Schorr (370-6791) or Gary Bowitch (372- 1858). Support Amnesty at Union by attending the Monday night meeting. This new feature is designed to bring out some of the tasteless humor that we KNOW is lurking out there. The rules are simple (but then again so are the minds . behind this contest). Each week Concordy will print outstanding campus quotes as related to us by members of the campus community. At the end of each month, the editors of the paper, in consultation with any available half-wits, will choose the quote that has kept them reeling on the floor the longest. The author of said quote will · then receive one free pitcher of beer to be disbursed at the Pub. (We figured that .such plebeian incentives would motivate some of the less vocal people on campus.) In order to start this contest off with \a bang, the following quotes are offered up as a sacrifice to the .altar of humor. We hope that those pardoied in this feature are good sports and hence won't sue Prof. Sheldon Schmidt, Prof. of Economics-\lf it ain't got numbers, it ~in't economics.\ STUDENT ENVIRONMENTAL ALLIANCE ' IS SPONSORING A TALK WITH Watson Fellowship BRUCE BROWNELL from Adirondack Alternative Energy on uPASSIVE SOLAR ENERGY\ in the Conference Room, 2nd fl.

Amnesty International presents: \Artists for Amnesty\ Series Poster Sale Jan. 22 & 23 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Carnegie Hall. \The Artists for Amnesty poster series not only afflr:ms the ethical and aesthetic concern of 15 of the World's maJor contemporary artists, but constitutes a vital contribution to the tradition of graphic protest Initiated by Goya, and continued by Daumier, Grosz and Picasso.\ -Diane Kelder, The Art Journal Edward Horstmann and Jill Schlesinger. The Foundation, by awarding substantial monetary grants to the winners, hopes to provide the fellows an opportunity for a focused and disciplined Wan- derjahr of their own devising. The Program provides a unique chance to explore thoroughly a particular interest, test their aspirations and abilities, view their lives and American society in greater perspective, and, concomitantly, develop a more informed sense of in- ternational concern. A candidate's proposed project· is of particular iln- portance. The project choices reflect· the personal significance, imagination and realistic goals of the candidate. The projects also reflect a desire for r independence and will test the winner's adap- tability to new environments, as well as reflect their com- mitment to their project. Union has consistently done well in the competition, receiving at least one Watson Fellowship every year. This year's candidates have sulJ.. mittetl varied and interesting proposals. Patti Chaifetz would like to use her grant to study Jewish identities in London, Florence and Jerusalem. \To do this properly, .I need to live among the Jews of these cities so that I may see how Judiasm is tre~ted in the home, in the ::ommunity and in the career world.\ Edward Horstmann intends to explore \small coastal village life in Scotland and Germany.\ Edward's par- ticular emphasis will be to attempt to explain the symbolic importance of the ocean to these people. Peter Hooper's proposal is not as complex, but is ambitious nonetheless. He would like to use the grant to enable him to live and work on a commune in the People's Republic of China . Jill Schlesinger, in an effort to gain experience in the field of aiding the Mentally Retarded in all aspects, hopes to use her grant money to make a cross- cultural study. The study would focus on the \attitudes toward the treatment of, and the availability of supportive services\ for the mentally retarded in a number of European countries. We wish all of the candidates the best of luck in anticipation of the upcoming decision in March. Professor Marten from the English Department would like to remind present,Juniors who might be interested in the Traveling Fellowship that the deadline for applications comes very early in the Fall term. If anyone has any questions regarding the Watson Fellowship, they should contact Prof. Marten in the English Dept.

Dan. Koubek alsomaided the effort by scoring 8 points in only 13 minutes of play. Union only allowed Central a lead once, 24-23, late in the first half, but back to back Koubek baskets put the Garnet ahead for good. Clutch foul shooting by the visit<lrs iced it in the second half as Union scored 18 of its last 20 points from the foul line. The win was a big one for the Dutchmen. Since the semester ended, Union's fortunes turned sour. It started innocently enough with a spine-tingling victQry over Kings Point, 81-80, on two clutch bombs by Mike Canning in the last thirty four seconds .of play.

Distributing, Mechaaicville, N.Y. and the Miller Brewing Company are proud to announce the Miller \Athlete-of-the-week\ progr- am. Each week a varsity athlete will be awarded a trophy in recognition of outstanding achievement in their sport. Dave Josephson, a senior economics major from Guelph, Ontario, is this issue's athlete of the week. Josephson is a four year varsity hockey player who has played two years under Coach Morrison and previously played for two years under Coach Harkness. >- \' Josephson, goalie for the ~ Union hockey team, was the 8 main cog behind the Dut- E chmen's resurgance this past ~ week. The team had suffered ~ o I four straight losses, giving up 2s c..~ I goals during those games. But the senior goalie came up with two sterling performances last week to propel the Dutchmen to their first back to back vict<lries in two and a half years. Assistant Coach Bob Driscoll stated that the whole team did a tremendous job but Dave Josephson was probably the key to the two victories. Athlete of the Week Dave Josephson Union snapped their losing streak last Tuesday against North Adams. Dave had a strong performance allowing only two goals and saving 31 shots for a .940 save percentage. Dave's goal tending never allowed North Adams to threathen the Dutchmen. The senior net minder out did -himself Saturday with probably the best game of his Union College career. Josephso'q turned away 28 shots against a' powerful Oswego State squad. Don't Miss The FIJI Oswego had been nationally ranked earlier in the year and had scored 108 goals in their first 17 games. Dave allowed only three goals against this · · powerful offensive club. Dave especially excelled· in the final 10 minutes making some clutch saves while Oswego applied constant pressure to pre~erve Union's one goal win.

Skaters Win.- A Pair Union battled back this week from a lackluster 2-8-1 record to tally two consecutive im- pressive victories at the hands of Oswego and North Adams. Prior to these triumphs th~ -Dutchmen had fallen in play at the Williams Tournament to Oswego (10-5~, and Babson (2-7) as well as to Holy Cross ( 1-3) in the finals of the UNION HOLIDAY TOURNAMENT. The Dutchmen's only victory came against Hamilton in overtime (6-5). In other holiday action Union was bounced by Elmira (1-4) ·and soundly defeated by Salem . State (2-5) in front of home town, Achilles Rink crowds. This week in the two victories against Oswegg and North Adams, however, the Skating Dutchmen displayed for the first time, a consiStent and well rounded offense sporting 4 line~ as well as a solidified defense, and most importantly the emergence of an inspired Dave Josephson in the nets. In these two games the Union offense outscored it's-opposition by a 2-1 margin. tallying three times before the close of the period. Th_e first of these was a power play conversion by junior scoring leader Bill Mason on-a · straight-away slapshot at 8:28. Follow:ing came two· strong ,goals by frosh sensation Don BeaU-the first a power play attempt when Beall swiped at the puck as he was being dragged down by a North Adams defender. Beall's second goal was made possible by the behind the net efforts of Todd Fobare who managed to get the puck in front to leave Beall with a wide open net. _ In the second period Union built it's lead up to 4-1 as Brian Shea deaked North Adam's goalie Karl Anderson to his left then placed the puck behind him on his right side. Two third period goals by Captain Mark Haley, the latter a powerful shorthanded score, put the game out of reach as the Dutchmen extended their lead to an insurmountable 6-1. sporting a 5.09 goals against average. Despite losses in three out of their last four games, Oswe_go's overall record was a glossy 12- 5; in Division II play, 7-4. Their two leading scorers, Dave Lair and Rich Pratt, whose com- bined goal QJltput was 36, had tallied for more scores than Union's entire offensive outpuL Unien's Mickey Perras opened up the goal scoring midway through the first period off of a rebound of a shot by Mark Bon. Fierce fore and back checking by the Dutchmen held Oswego in check for seven minutes until Oswego unloaded two earth-shattering and hasty goals just 40 seconds ·apart to go into the locker room with a 2-1 edge. Rick Pratt scored his 21st goal and Dave Lair followed with his 17th on a breakaway caused by a defensive lapse and some strong headman passing. Dutchmen Trounce North Adams, 6-2 North Adams was able to squeek' out just one more goal nearing the end of the period, but behind the steady and impeccable goal-minding of Dave Josephson, the Dutchmen held on to an easy 6-2 win. Moving into the second, Union once again began to control the tempo of the game as it had done for all but the last 5 minutes of the first period. · ~ Controlling draws and con- &. tinuing fierce and impeccable checking, the Dutchmen killed Captain Mark Haley ~ Corning ofC of two very unimpressive losses in holiday tournament action, the Dut- chmen coasted to an easy 6-2 win over North Adams at Achilles Rink on Tuesday. The Dutchmen had defeated the 'Mohawks' \twice last year. Before a meager crowd of 500, Brad Feltus of North Adams swiftly opened the scoring on a power play goal at the 3:45 mark-a weak slapper which Josephson had caught between his pads and let slither into the nets for a 1-o advantage. After a disputed Union goal by Jim Josephson was disallowed nearly one minute later, Union quickly avenged by In the game Union was out- shot by a margin of 33·31. UNION EDGES OSWEGO 4-3 On Saturday night, riding high off of the North Adams victory, Union attempted to avenge an earlier 10-5loss at the hands of Oswego State. The game was played before a near capacity crowd of over 2,500 at Achilles Rink. , \Playing the one who's hot,\ Coach Charlie Morrison went with Dave Josephson Jor the second game in a row, whose pre-game goals against average had dropped to 5,36. In goal for Oswego was Mike Shevlin, off a penalty to John Mercer and then went on to score their second goal of the game, just · five seconds after a penalty was up to Oswego's Todd. Amann. The goal came at the 9:30 mark as Jim Joseph:;;on connected on a rebound in f.ront of the net. Following double penalties to Brian Shea and Kevin Flynn and a missed open net by Josephson, Bo Tucker of- Oswego was called for a blatant crass-check at 15:39. In an -awesome power play in which the Dutchmen had 4 near goals in -only 36- seconds while clamping excrutiating pressure on Mike Shevlin and prompting justifiable standing ovations from the boisterous crowd, Don · Dean was able to hit on his third goal in two games off of a sparkling pass by linemate Todd Fobare. Union headed for their locker room after this, unquestionably their best all around period of the year with a narrow 3-2 lead.- Opening up the third ·period, the·Mason-Beall-Fobare line fired once more, only 18 seconds into the period as the latter swatted a bounding puck into the open net; continuing the insurmountable pressure that had begun in the second period. After a minor peralty to Jim Josephson, Dave Lair scored unassisted as he broke in one on one and placed a wtister meticuloully over the .left shoulder of netminder Josephson. A near flawless and defense and both graceful and spec- tacular saves by goalie Josephson while under constant pressure shut out the potent Oswego offense for the remainder of the game--an offense which had scored 108 goals in its first 17 games. In the final minutes crafty skating by Brian Shea, Jim Josephson, and Sparky Anderson pinned the puck in the Oswego zone. The Oswego at- tack was halted as Union eventually went on to win 4-3. For the first time Union had solidly-outshot their opposition in each period and had, at - g!lmes end, outshotOswego by a sizeable 42•29 edge. The Union scoring attack was w~ll rounded as evidenced by goal scoring by 3 of the 4 lines. After the game, Coach Charlie Morrison was spirited and optimistic calling th1s \the teams best and biggest victory; the most all around game this season.\ \The team had confidei'tce after Tuesday's victory (North Adams) and everyone was riding high. Each player-from the offense to the defense to the goalie-as well as the vocal crowd (anti even the band!!) aided in this win.\ \Everyone did his job.\ Wirth To Coach Gridders . ·- <\ • .- Coac:::h Joe Wirth Union Hockey On T.V. Joseph Wirth, assistant football coach at Brown Un~yersity, has been appginted head football coach at Union College. Wirth's appointment was announced. December 27, 1979 by Richard Sakala, director of athletics at Union. Wirth, 44, has been first assistant and defensive coordinator for seven years at Brown. Previously, he was defensive coordinator at Colgate University and an assistant at Holy Cross. In announcing the ap- pointment, Mr. Sakala said, \We feel very fortunate in having Joe take over our football program. He combines all the ingredients we were seeking in a new coach.\ Mr. Sakala added, \Joe's For the first time ever a (Jan. 30), Holy Cross (Feb. 2), experience and his successes Union College athletics team and Westfield (Feb. 23) will be speak for themselves.

Sakala, who had an advisory committee assist him in the selection, said Union College had received more than 100 applications for the head coaching position. Following a meeting with the athletic .director, Coach Wirth said, \I am very happy to be associated with an outstanding college_ such as Union. I am confident we can quickly get our program Ullderway.\ Asked if he believed he could show early improvement on the football field, Coach Wirth said, \I certainly do. I saw films of this team and I was quite im- pressed with some of the players who will be returning next year. It's imperative that we get a successful program operating early.\ During his seven years at Brown, Coach Wirth . par- ticipated in a reversal of that college's football fortunes from losing seasons to .seven straight winning seasons. During that time, Brown's overall record was 43-15-2 and included an Ivy League championship. Wirth's defense has been nationally ranked among major colleges for five of hi~ seasons at Brown. In 1974, · the Ivy League school ranked nationally behind Micbigan and Notre Dame in defense and in 1977, his defense ranked second nationally in pass defense, fifth in total defense and ninth in scoring defense. While at Brown, Coach Wirth recruited and coached three All- East, three All-New England and eight AU-Ivy players. During his four year career at Colgate, tl:1e Red Raiders also had consecutive whining seasons. · Coach Wjrth began his coaching career· at North Catholic High School in Pitt- sburgh, where in four years, he compiled a 28-8 record. The new Union College coach was graduated from West Virginia.University in 1960 ann in the same yea!.\ he was Qamed the university's outstanding student-athlete.

Several members who voted not to approve the package noted that they still had some serious concern over the accuracy of many of the budgets for several individual groups.

To this end, some tentative guidelines were drawn up by , several · forum members in consultation with Dean Kellett and Mrs. Marra.

Between the energy crunch, the Iranian and Afghanistan crises, and other recent events, the Middle East is· receiving more and more D!lblic attention. Prof~ssor Stephen Pelletiere, Adjunct · Assistant Professor of Political Science · , who is currently teaching a course entitled, \The Modern History of the Middle East,\ says that these events are bringing about a change in \the tendency to regard the 'Middle East as important only in terms of the Arab-Israeli War.\ - According to Professor Pelletiere, . whose speciality is Middle East affairs, the Middle East \for years has been treated as something of a stepchild,\ seen as important only in the context of the Arab - Israeli crisis. The area and its problems are, however, much more complex and broad than this. One cannot really speak about the \Middle East\ without considering all of the countries_:which constitute this region and their respective characteristics and problems. The Mid-East region includes a much broader group of countries than those generally thought of. The area stretches from Morocco · in the west to Pakistan and Afghanistan in the east, from Turkey and Iran in the north to Sudan and Saudi Arabia in the south. Within this area there are. three major ethnic'groups- Arabs, Iranians and Turks -as well as numerous minorities including the Kurds, the Copts of Egypt, and the Jews of Israel. All of these and their implications are im- portant to consider for a broad knowledge of the area, as each country has its own conditions and problems which affect the Community would be necessary character of the Middle East as in order · to maintain a whole. · , · \cooperation communication Prof. Pelletiere has done a and continuity\ of the Greek great deal of study on Middle Community at Union .

The following may be per- ceived as an addendum to the Middle States Report on Student Life. The concept of fear and loathing (which is singularly American, and born on the West coast) connotes a significant psychological malfunction arising from being exposed to an environment where mere insanity has digressed to evil tendency. Now, if you can comprehend all of that, then the disease may not be unfamiliar to you. Mr. Thompson relates to us several manifestations of the disease, most of these arising from the West coast ''freeway'' living ..

Antoinette Rossetti Academic Calendar· To the Edit<lr: Mark Dindorf, in his letter (Letters, January 17) makes some good roints about the benefits o our present academic calendar. However, he 9oes not present a few facts which totally negate his argument. He makes the point that we have a long, relaxing Christmas break. I, ton, looked forward to the month~long vacation, being a freshman and never having bad one here before. When 1 arrived back in my home town in Michigan, however, I discovered that 1 was the only one. of my senior high school class on· vacation! The same argument holds true for the first two weeks in, September. When everybody else leav-es for school, vacation can become boring, tedious, and lonely. Also, he fails to point out that, although our Christmas break is, again, a month '1ong, our subsequent Easter-S-p,ring J>reak is all of eight days. This is remarkably short.

The film comnuttee loses money, a known fact, bu.t' this year our attitude has been one which is trying to turn this situation around. In order to do this we have to rais~ an interest and get the students into SS016. The course of action we have taken is to supply first rate movies with titles that students · recognize. and have had major acclahn in theatrical circles. This is evident by the moV'ies that are being offered this term, Midnight Express among them. Our purpose is not to make a .profit, _nor . . to spread propaganda; on the contrary our purpose is to provide en~ tertainment for the. stUdent bOCly. It was our opinion that Midnight Express was a highly accredited film which would appeal to many, not necessarily all, of the student body. We have to try to please as many of the students as possible. On behalf of the film committee, I would like to say that I am glad that \the few,\ finally spoke up for a change. Governance Meetings To the Editor: I would like to bring to your attention the following factual error in the article on the faculty governance meetings printed in the November 15, 1979 issue of Concordiensis.

I think this little piece of painful news should have been front page headlines, since it affects most students, and not buried deep in a mis-tilled article as was the case in last week's Coneordiensis. This price increase is the next step toward Ivy League tuitions which in themselves are reaching stupendous heights. A $700.00 cost increase is a pcretty tough burden to place on this college's student body, despite the 20 percent increase in financial aid. I personally am not against a cost raise, but with the rising prices ofother college essentials (transportati<m .. clothing, books, etc.) $700.00 is extremely steep. I hope many Union College students take note of this genuine fact so that they are not surprised to find a hefty increase in next year's already stMgering bill. Sincerely~ David Wollin Kudos to Dave Siegel for his thoughtful letter in your last issue. Student attitudes most assuredly affect the activities of our Admissions Office. The special ambiance, or lack thereof, on a given campus is glaringly noticeable to visitors. Fortunately, ·here at Uniotf we receive feedback from our visitors that we do have a special ambiance largely centered around a very friendly and helpful student body. If the members of this campus community can rid themselves of what I feel is a thoroughly unjustified inferiority complex we can then go forth with pride on all fronts. May I suggest that we are what we think we are. Let's begin thinking we are good .•. because we are. Any other food found to cause this many birth defects would have been labeled long ago. But a district judge in · bourbon- producing Kentucky ruled in 1976 that alcohol is exempted from labeling req-uirements that apply to all other foods and beverages. P.S. I hope many students don't Please help to prevent 1,000 to take this CQst hike lightly~ 5,1)00 deformed babies each be~ause if we do, sooner or later year by writing to Cangress· we 11 pay for it.

- \ ~ag~ 4 ' . ~', . OO!yOORDIFJ_NSIS, Janimry B4, 1980 Primary UpdateL low.a Chqoses · Carter and Bush by ROBERT B~RNES When the dust settled from the Iowa caucuses on: Monday night, there were two big winners and two big losers. The winners were President Carter and Republican George Bush; the loser.s were Senator Edward Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. Carter collected almost 60 percent of the vote as he ~olled over Kennedy, picking up 30 of Iowa's 50 delegates to the Democratic National Con- ~ention to Kennedy's 16, with 4 uncorrunitted. It had been ex- pected that Carter would win, but his margin of victory sur- prised even his own supporters, who feared that his recent halt of grain sales to the Soviet Union would have an adverse effect in heavily rural Iowa. is still highly incidative of how Iowa's convention delegates will be divided up. George Bush, who, as he likes to tell it, was _ just an ·asterisk among the candidates several months ago, was the man who snatched away victory from the jaws of Ronald Reagan. Bush gathered a surprising 33 percent of the vote, outdistancing Reagan's 27 perc.ent. Finishing farther down the line were Senator Howard' Baker ( 14 per~ent), J·ohn Connally ( 10 percent}, Rep. Philip Crane (7 percent), Rep. John Anderson {4 percent), and Senator Robert Dole {3 per- cent). ' Both Presi'de.1:t Carter's supporters and Senator Ken- nedy's supporters were willing to credit Carter's victory margin to a \Rally 'Rolilld the President\ type of fee1ing due to the crises in ~Iran and brought Jimmy Carter into the limelight four years ago didn't forge~ him, even though Carter didn't set a foot inside Iowa during the caucus campaign. By staying in the White House and acting presidential, it seems that Carter scored some points in Iowa. But that is not to say that Carter did no cam- paigning. He spent at least an hour a day on the telephone making personal calls -to key precinct workers, and his surrogates, including his wife Rosalynn, logged same fifty days criss-crossing the state. Carter takes Democratic lead in Iowa The Republican vote was in the form ef a straw poll, in which party members 'meJ 1 ely expressed their candidate preference. While not as -bin- ding as the Democratic vote, it , Afghanistan, but the wound was still deep for Kennedy; Earlier, Kennedy had made a direct challenge to Carter's ability to get out the vote in Iowa by saying that for Carter's forces to consider it a true· victory, they had to get 50 percent of th~ vote. l,Jp until Monday night, 50 percent seemed enormously high for the President. Besides the grain sale controversy and some shaky Carter economic policies, -. Kennedy spent seventeen days in Iowa cam- paigning and building up an extensive organization. George Bush personally spent 31 days in Iowa, more than any other candidate. It is significant that Reagan spent only 48 hours in that state, shunned the Republican debate in Des Moines, and has continually downplayed the importance of tlle caucuses. By acting like the Republican nomination was his for the taking, he angered many Iowans and helped provide some steam for the cluster of candidates who have been trailing him in the polls for months, especially the well- organized Bush. A Union College Resume by DAVID WOLLIN Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary: Reswne-a short account of one's career and qualifications prepared typically by an applicant for a position. Wollin's Authentic Lexicon: Resume-any load of bull piled together to knowingly deceive an admissions officer. Now that the first term at Union has come to an end, for many of us the days· of the garbage-packed resumes have long passed. No longer are we worried about being accepted into the \college of our choice\ for we are finally there. Who could forget those memorable high school days, joining every club or activity in sight (even if it was for one meeting), just so you could have a resume the size of a book. (Mine was as long as War and Peace) And finally, who could forget the ultimate exp~rience of having all the college applications done, and waiting for the in- famous April 15th; the day of acceptances (or in my case, .rejections) came in. But the days of the resume are not as far gone as was first thought. Surprisingly enough, a reswne is needed in almost all future career applications and, as the second term approaches, now is the best time to get involved in rewriting that \book.\ Many people at Union are unaware of the div'erse clubs that are available for entry and now is as good a time as an~ to list some of the outstanding groups present. For verification, please check the 1983 Freshman Record. Extracurricular Activities 1. IDLE: This group sponsors such activities as \watching the grass grow\ or \watching the parking meters violate the.m- selves.\ Some come on out and watch. 2. Union Glee Club: Since its founding in 1278, the Union Glee Club has found ever-growing success in sitting around and laughing at each other. Why do you think they call it a ','Glee\ club? 3. Claude Rains Club: No one has been able to locate where any of the meetings are . . . or the members for that matter. 4. Chess Club: This group teaches its members that they have a mind of their own! 5. Coffeehouse: The Cof- feehouse offers a relaxed at- mosphere in which to listen to guest lecturers. This year's speakers are: Robert Young, Mrs. Olsen, Joe Dimaggio, and Cora .. . . (You know . . . The Wicked Witch of the West in Wizard of Oz). 6. Union Book: This group ponders the question: Whose bright idea was it to name the Union College Yearbook \Union Book\? ' 7. Club Club: This This is is a a club club for for people people who who see see double double .. 8. Special K Club: This club delves into the psychological and political aspects of the corn flake on society today. 9. WART: Union's student radio station located on the fifth floor Carnegie and operating at 12.45 FM. WART offers op- portunities in bunion control and pimple removal. 10. \SST\iensis: The college newspaper is a top notch example of journalism at its best ... Incidentally, the article you are presently reading is one main reason for its success. Now that the second term is upon us, the onslaught of resume ,.addicts will be inhabiting all our distinguished clubs and groups. Right now, as you read this article, two more addicts have already joined the ever-popular \When War Succeeds\ (This Kbomeini Club is for all Union College hostages . . . I mean \students\ who enjoy participating in over- taking American embassies). So hurry up and join riow, so you toa can become an addict and have a resume the size of Jhe Twin Towers in New York. I did! Why do you think I write for this paper? Ha Hal Only kjdding, Concordy! Engineering: Is It for You? The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Union College Chapter is a'n organization that has con- tinually strived to meet the needs of engineering students \'here at Union College. Its ef- forts are complimented by the work of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers ( ASME) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Annual activities have included organizational meetings (scheduled semi- regularly), guest speakers, special presentations, picnics, and field trips (bet you thought those went out with the good ol' days, eh? ). Now the ASCE has proposed a new program designed for the orientation of prospective engineering majors to the various areas of engineering which are at their disposal. Officers of the ASME and IEEE, wasted no time in jumping on the bandwagon in support of an engineering orientation program. This program; aimed at guiding indecisive engineers; will form on the three areas of engineering at Union College and the sub-divisions which are encompassed by each general area. All three departments will be represented at this special program including civil engineering, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering. Each department will construct an individual presentation (slide Shows and other good things any engineering majors can't afford to miss) geared at explaining the basic elements of the respective engineering areas. The separate .presentations will be followed by bried question and answer sessions to assuage the fears of any exceptionally tremulous engineering students, and generally to answer any questions which may arise throughout the course of the evening. The engineering orientation program will be held in Strauss Lounge on Wednesday, January 30, 1980, at 7 p.m. All engineering majors and in- terested persons are strongly encouraged to attend the evening's activities. F{efresh- ments will be served. The ASCE, ASME, and IEEE alike all hope that this par- ticular .eff-ort at guiding the undecided epgineering majors will help to draw new engineers into their organizational circles. Involvement •is the key to tapping the virtually limitless supply of instruction and guidance which the ASCE, ASME, al)d IEEE have to offer.

This week I will focus this • column on the stock market. The best way to purchase stocks is to get in touch with a stock broker in your area that is af- filiated with the N.Y.S.E., A.S.E., and 0-T-C. He will help you out and sometimes give you sound advice. The stock market can be a fun place where you can make a small purchase and watch it develop. The stock market is now facing many obstacles because of the economic and political problems in this country as well as others. The stock market will most likely remain between the low 700 and upper 800 level until the summer, when it should then see a major drop in stock prices., In this recessionary period, many· high-dividend yielding stocks will shine in the · near future. At this time a goOd buy would be.a stock like H.J. Heinz. I have followed this stock for a few years and it is almost always faovred by most analysts during times of recession. This stock has been termed by some to be recession proof .. This is because of the fact that it remains at ap- proximately the same price during many bad months for the §tock market. It is an excellent long term investment because of its good earnings reports and its well-run management. For the near future I am favoring stocks in the defense group. My majoz: candidate is Boeing, Inc. This stock is a major maker of defense products and should have a good runup because of the military problems this country· will face in the near future. I am also suggesting buys on stocks within the medical group. These are excellent stocks to have in your portfolio. This group will surely see a medical technology boom in the 80's. I am favoring such gi~nts as Merck and Co., Bausch and Lomb lnc., Phizer Inc., Squibb Inc.' and a small company named Coherent Inc., which is located on the Over the Counter Exchange, This company specializes in devices used in opthalmologic surgecy. These have been a few helpful tips on the right places to make your investments in the market.

Or are you the person Who believes that the term \Italians\ refers to the group in your high school that wears leather jackets? Well, ladies and gentlemen, I am sad to inform you that you are in,. correct on an three counts. How do I know? I was one of the fortunate few who spent hi.s fall term abroad in Florence, Italy. Life in Italy was quite an experience. My arrival in Firenze (the Italian translation of Florence) was marred by thoughts. of excitement, preoccupation, and hunger. As I climbed the long staircase to . myapartment for the first time, many questions lingered in my mind; the primary question being, \Will they speak to me in English?\ Seconds later a small, skinny, and middle-aged woman burst forth from a set of gargantuan doors and shouted \Ciao\. I asked her if she spoke English . and she did not respond. I knew from that moment on, I was in trouble. The Italian that I had learned at Unien during spring term was lost somewhere between Schenectady and Yonkers. I - could not communicate to her through my mouth- I had to use my hands (by the way, it is true- -all Italians do use their hands to speak). Finally my host said something to me ;.md the only word I recognized was \mangia\. Now even I remembered my \Ragu\ spaghetti sauce commercials and I knew that mangia meant \eat\. I quickly shook my head up and down, indicating the universal meaning of \yes\. My momma turned around and walked away. I later realized that she had used the word \mangia\ in the context of \Had I eaten already?\ I thought she was asking me whether I wanted to eat. I went hungry thpt first night. ~ It took a little getting used to, but by the second week I was slowly falling in love with F'irenze. Perhaps it was the fact that I found out that there were 70 different - types of Chianti Classico wines; one bottle for each day of the term. Or perhaps it was the fact that I was eating pasta at least once a day (I love pasta). Maybe-just maybe it was the fact that Florentine women are not fat and ugly as they are stereotyped, but thin and gorgeous! And the outfits they wore! Oh my word! The best• part about Union -College is not being here for a term. Now you know I don't mean that the way you think I mean that. Once you've gone to Firenze, you'll know what I'm talking about.

I believe I can safely say that all returned with their previous expectations fulfilled. Every student lived in the home of an English family and truly experienced British culture. Although our group all lived within walking distance from each other, if one was planning to visit a friend living on a steep hill an allowance of 45 minutes for walking time was necessary.

(MAT .#5010.05) even an overnight journey to London. Professor and Mrs. Murphy accompanied us on all of our excursions including a visit to a medieval castle for which we all wore appropriate costumes. Our group frequently experienced another aspect of British culture, namely the well known English pubs. Although the pubs only remained op~n until 11:00 p.m., on weekends the Union group could always be counted on to close them. Students often ate dinner out; however, we were also given the option to dine with our host families. In Thanksgiving, which is not celebrated in England, our group held a traditional holiday dinner and invited our hosts to join us. We all carried a normal three course load. Everyone took a course entitled \British Political, Social and Economic Trends\ taught by various English professors and a Chaucer course taught by Professor Murphy. We had a choice for our third course which either dealt with English Literature in Bath and the West country of England or the history of Bath and Bristol (a nearby city) . An advantage most of us found by going on a term abro\ld 1n the fall was that there was a substantial amount of time to travel beforehand. Of course financial considerations could not be overlooked. By the time we arrived in Bath many of us had funny stories to tell about our experiences in what would be considered Sv1newhat less than five-star hotels. In my opinion anyone con- sidering going to England next fall should put any reservations · they may have in the back of .. their minds and take advantage of this exciting experience.

With a grant given to Dr. John ArnoLd, an authority on cephalopod development, by the National Expedition SCience Foundation, a total of twenty scientists were able to gather information dealing in their specialized line of l'esearch. The entire cruise lasted two months. The first leg of the/trip focused upon the biochemical nature of the living forms to be· studied whereas the second leg of the cruise (which Professor Boyer took part in). emphasized the ecological and develop• mental nature of these life forms. The main purpose of the expedition was to study Nautilus Pompilous, the only living member of the subclass Nautiloidia. Nautilus belongs to the class cephalopoda and the .Nautilus and .other cephalopods such as squid and octopus, there was a broad range ·of other 1i ving forms studied.

Projects researched in the sophisticated laboratories aboard the Alpha Helix included 'Chief Embryology and Reproductive Biology of Diary of a Mad Person - phylum mollusca. Because all other members of the subclass are extinct, the SLI.ldy of nautilus can provide a valuable lin'k to the past. Nautilus can only be found in the Southwest Pacific and Indian Ocean. Therefore Professor Boyer's travels took her to remote islands where the people were primitive yet overwhelmingly friendly.

'by RIM ''Call me Ishmael, ·call me unreliable, call me anything, but don't call me for dinner.\ I yelled this to my friend as I rushed out the door. I said this even though I knew that after several long hours of working in the deep dark, dank depths of the library's basement ( ac- tually one third of the time is spent talking to others and procrastinating), I would be very hungry. I could anticipate the feeling - my mouth would get dry and 'start to feel like a bad cup of coffee, and my stomach would begin to growl. It would not politely grumble as if to say, \Excuse me, but you've been working a long time without food, maybe you should eat.\ But would growl fiercely; \The time has come for all good students to come to the aid of tpeir intestines. EAT!\ It was invariably an offer I couldn't refuse. The problem was, where should I go to fulfill my responsibility to my insides. There shouldn't have been a dilemma because I was on the meal plan. This meant that I was supposed to eat nineteen meals on campus in one of several places: Hale- House, West College or the Skellar,. The Skellar was fine for a lunch or two, but how many meals can you eat while listening to ,..- someone play the \KISS\ pinball machine. West is fin~, if you like -five hundred, yelling, excitable and too often overly enthusiastic freshmen (sorry, fresh people). The only place left would be Hale House. Hale is a fine dining facility with comfortable decor, decent food, goad company, and in- credibly 1ong lines followed by limited seating. After yielding to my stomachs demands (it offered to hold my brain homage-no great threat if you really think about it), I would go to Hale House and wait on line to get in, to get my meal card punched, to get my silverware, to get my food, to get my drinks, to get my desert., to get my salad, to get a seat and yes, even to put my tray on the racks. Can you believe that I was waiting in line to throw out my garbage? This situation often prompted me, in an effort to calm my raging colon, . to find ?ther places of culmary delight: Pizza Hu1., Sambo's, Mother Ferro's, etc-., etc., After several -weeks of eating out, and then running back to the dorm to answer for my transgressions, I decided to consult the \Food Czar\. Never in the annuls of Union College has one man done so much for so many in such a long ~mount of time. When I approached Angelo Mazz?ne about the overcrowdmg question at Hale I said, \Angelo what about the overcrowding question . at Hale.\ I was not disappointed with his response. It seems that Mr. Mazzone recognized . the uncomfortable situation Long term 'options and solutions include building an extension onto Carnegie, ren- novating Old Chapel or possibly bujlding a new facili.ty altogether. But, all of this takes money, labor· and approval, none of which is at this time definitely available.

Until then, is anybody interested in going to Jack-in-the-Box for a taco run? . not unusual for a string of children to follow the scientists with ensuing curiosity. The townspeople played an active role in capturing the Nautilus. In order to get the specimens, traps were set by the local townspeople who· succeeded in providing 352 specimens of Nautilus for research. While three quarters of the research concentrated on created by an unexpected number of meal plan buyers. On the first day of classes, after Christmas recess, Mr. Mazzone visited Hale House and noted that changes had to be made. A Cabinet meeting was held on Tuesday, Jan. 7, where a proposal for rennovations to alleviate the problem was discussed. On nex:t day, the proposal was brought before the Board of Trustees. Unfor- tunately the Board of Trustees had so~e reservations about approving the proposal. It seemed to them that the propos{ll was a short term solution.

When Ford wrote m h1s notebooks that \the ,automobile is the new Messiah,\ he \meant it literally,\ Nye says.

The young woman was one of a number of relatives Ford brought to Dearborn~ Michigan and cared for when the Great Depression began. \Ford believed the young girl was his reincarnated mother, and until his death never wavered in this conviction,\ Nye said. · - Ford first had several paintings made of her dressed in the fashions of his mother's earlier days. Then he asked her and her husband to re-enact on film Ford's earliest childhoog memory. ·Ford had remema bered walking across a field and being shown eggs in a bird' s nest, and the vignette was played out with a young boy taking Ford's part. It was the same impUlse that earlier had led Ford to create the Greenfield Museum, with . his childhood home just as he remembered · it. \With Ford, everything, including the past, had to come to life,\ Nye said. ''The whole impulse was to create history as lf it had not passed:\ That film is a ''startling confirmation that Ford's belief in ·'reincarnation was v.ery serious.

of a a Page 7 OONOORDIENSISJ Januo\ry !4; 1980 ' l . . - - Broken by ROBERT BLAKE Marianne Faithfull is one of thoSe old and forgotten figures of the sixties that may ring a bell in the back of some people's minds. If one stretches their memory back far .enough into the realms, of rock trivia, one will recall that Marianne Faith- full~ was the drugged-out groupie who went out with Mick Jagger for the lpngest time until after she tried to commit suicide. She became too J;IlUCh for Jagger to handle, and the couple split up. ·Faithfull was to fade into obscurity, releasing one or two unnotable soft pop albimis. Mick Jagger was to leave the song \Wild Horses\ as the final momento to their relationship. To everyone's surprise Faithfull has returned to the music scene with an unexpected new album, Broken English .• Broken English is a . total departure in style. to anything that Faithfull has done in the past. Her voice has change.<:!· from an rtnobtrusive, mellow whisper to 'a harsh, tortured moan. The albuni portrays an intiinate, painful world vision from a person who h~s been a casualty of her times. Although half the songs are interpretations, and the other ' half are co-composed by Faith- full and her friends, the songs all mesh together to present. a similar theme. The songs all Faithful I portray a cold, cruel world filled with personal betrayal, unfulfilled lives, and feelings of bitterness and guilt towards one's existence. All the songs from Faithfull's ballads of infidelity, to John Lennon's ·\Working Class Heroes\ are congruent to FaithfuU's decadent world view. ~ I feel one of the greatest draw backs of the album is its backing music. The music on this album is a spacey disco that occasionally moves into blues and rock, but never achieves any raunch or power. On the whole it _is unimaginative, boring, and it does nothing to complement the lyrics._ The ability of a band's music to ~complement its lyrics with the musical atmosphere they present is ·\!? factor I've always felt that separated a good band . frorrf a great band. The legendary Velvet Underground is a prime example of this, as their throbbing, dissonent music perfectly complemented their exploration of the taboo side of human nature. Another drawback I find in this album is Faithfull's . reliance on profanity to achieve power in her lyrics. The lyrics here do not have anything profound to say, they simply e:x:P.ress Faithfull's bitterness towards the world. I am not saying that I feel profanity is a bad way to express certain sentiments,· but I do~ feer it is overused here. Somehow the phrase \Suck his cock\ loses its .. impact when it is used at least three times in different places throughout the album. Despite these drawbacks, Broken English remains to be a fairly powerful and provocative album. The album's greatest achievement is in proving that Marianne Faithfull does have some artistic merit · to her name. If she can deveiop the potential revealed here, she will surely become one of the most important artists 'Of the eightles.

Midnight Express, based on the supposedly non-fiction book by Billy Hayes and William Hoffer, is a 1978 release (directed by Alan Parker) that garnered several Academy Awa~d nominations, including best picture.

OONOORDIE~SIS, January !4, 1!18q culture arts Wilson To Give ReCital by MATT LUBART I . On Tuesday January 29 Professor Huge (ugh) Organ 1 Allen) Wilson will beautify the campus, and enlighten our starving aesthetic appetites with the help of the melodious machinations of the chapel organ. This <;oncordy reporter, his curiosity piqued by the news of this midnight manifesto of musical virtuosity, endeavored to uncover its underlying cause. The following discussion is based upon tensive spiritual interviews with Levi-strauss~ Mark~Manheim-Boas-Dtirk­ heim-and Schneller, to name a few. It appears that sometime around the turn of the 19th century, a new breed of man, arising out of- a seemjng spontaneous mutation, reared - it's head in a small provincial - area at the foot of the Adiron• dack Mountains. Current opinion in the field points to the year 1795 as the first point in time when this new breed reached a concentration high enough to be, in the words of Fred Hartwig (and Alan Rutkin), statistically significant.\ Thus the evolution of man ran headlong into a brick wall. Within the discipline, war is being waged as to the name this Darwinian headache is to be accorded. In the Left corner, the bleeding heart liberal and avant-garde 1 intelligensia argued that the typical social science jargon only served to cloud up the more important issues and hence opted for the concise \Homo Live in Librari11s\ while those who stood slightly to the right of Mussolini (as it goes in the social sciences, approximately 98.35 percent equals 2 percent), delved deep into their musty volumes of antiquitous non- sense, and arrived at the official name \Homo Unionus Mor- bididus Onlistudiforgradius Rectum us,\ Fortunately for those who unwittingly fall into this field of study, this long- winded obfuscation has a rather simple reduction: HtJMOR. Ah, _ having dispensed with this rather wordy introduction, I am now free to delve into the question burning in your mind (if your mind is not yet com- pletely burned and if anyone is still reading this): Why (to paraphrase the questions of Passover) is this man different from all other men? Unfor- tunately dear friends, the an- swer to this question is not complete, but I will never- theless speak of the prevailing theory. . It appears that the 14th chormosome 'of HUMOR has transubstantiated into J ello · while the 16th cHromosome has likewise turned into an likeness of a One Hundred dollar bill! The complex effects this has had on the social infrastructure are fascinating. First, -it ap- pears that this ''new mal}.\ has transcended 'social interaction' ·and has instead based his society on some reified deity known only as ''The Most Holy GPA\. We are currently in- vestigating the significance of this GPA, but are attempts are futile as none within the clan are willingto·speak of it nor will they let us see something they refer to as \notes''. The Second feature of this poor excuse for a noncephalic spider monkey is that the religious fervor they express in their worship of the G PA is the highest of any known society or species. From Monday to Friday until 11:00 P.M. (Eastern Standard Time) Homo LIVINLIBRARIUS Literally buries themselves in their sanctuary the Tomb of Shaffer, and worship with the high priestess Blue jean de Pellitiere. Sociologists and Anthropoligists, in an effort to measure the extent of this fervor· have devised a rather ingenious test of the- vestigial reminant·of aesthetic taste left 'in HUMOR. Therefore, on Tuesday Jan. 29,at the stroke of midnight, precisely one hour after the closing of-the Tomb of Shaffer, Prof. Wilson will 'tempt these relatives of Cheeta into the chapel with great masterworks that have proven an effectiveness jn increasing the Human Libido (we'll try almost anything). Your presence is requested to show Hugh Allen Wilson the world that the species HUMOR ,jndeed has not suc- cumbed to the dreaded virus pre-professional baccilia. And besides, the music's good too. P.S. Haven't you always wanted to see a professor in a black cape. Glee Club The Queen's Chorale of Rutgers University, wtder the direction of Frederic Ford, will join the Union College Men's Glee Club, under the direction of Hugh Allen Wilson, in a performance of Randall Thompson's ''Ameri-can Mer<;.ury\ on Saturday, January 26, at 8 pm in the Memorial Chapel of Union College.

Chances are that you were either getting your sweats on, playing hoop or counting lay-up shots in your sleep. Phi Gamma Delta sponsored a 24~hour BaseketbaU Marathon to benefit the Sunneyview Rehabilitation Center in Schenectady this past weekend. The Genter specializes in comprehensive medical rehabilitation and orthopedics. Services are available to children and adults on an im- patient or outpatient basis. The community and campus ~ere. ~nthusiasti~ally involved m ratsmg money for the center. Pizza Hut, McDonalds and Burger King provided the energy food and 3WD kept Schenectady posted on the benefit and the scoring while the Fiji brothers kept the beer flowing: The teams of women who trekked to the Alumni gym at all hours of the day and night are to be applauded for their spirit as well as skill. Blue and yellow T~shirts contributed by Miller beer were given !o the opposing teams. ''Blue'' kept their lead right into the early hours of Saturday morning (despite my finesse at missing every shot) until Yellow\ came up from behind, took control and held the lead right up to the final victory basket. Final score: Yellow, 1,348; Blue 1,336. Visiting alumni included Billy \Rocky\ Albrecht, Dickie \The Mouth\Rosenthal Gary Hughes and Kevin \Stilly\ Kilbourne.

Women's ··Network After 10 years of enrollment at Union, women on campus . have united to form a group called the Women's Network. Although the network has been in existence for several years the· organization was weak and little was accomplished. Since return from winter break the membership of the Network has grown, thereby enabling women to strive together in an effort to ~gain recognition. Four different sub- cornmitt~es focus on specific issues, while the Executive board maintains homeostasis within the group. Of the four sub-committees, two, the Woman's week· group and the Activities group, arrange for speakers and workshops. Two . scheduled workshops, include self-defense and car mechanics. The Action group ascertains the needs of women students at Union, and then confronts the administration with the issues. Already this committee has begun dealing with the problem of lighting on campus at night. The newest subcommittee-- Public Awareness--informs students of issues throughout the world that may affect them. 'Fhis group also handles the / . body. We welceme all in- terested newcomers.

The Graduate Record Examinations Board, which sponsors the ;GRE testing program, is reducing the availability of the Aptitude Test in New York State in order to · comply with a New York State · law, -enacted last July, that requires test organizations to · ·. make public the questions and answeFs of admissions tests that are administered in the state after Dec. 31, 1979. The GRJ!: Advanced Tests are exempted from the disclosure ~;equirements. The previously announced testing schedule will be maintained outside New York State during the January- SeptembEr period. \The need to sustain test quality and ·- usef.ulness requires a tem- porary reduction in testing services in New York as the G RE Board plans for a longer- term ·' response to recent legislative requirements to disclose test contents,\ said · Alfred S. Sussman, dean of the Horace H. Rackham School of . Graduate Studies, University of Michigan, and chainnan of the GRE Board. ''After a test has been made public, it cannot be used again,\ Sussman explained. \The number of editions of the Aptitude Test we can release is determined by our current inventory of test editions and the rate at which we can develop new Qnes. We will in- crease our test development effort as rapidly as we can. Maintenance of the quality of the Aptitude Test will continue to be an overriding con- sideration in our planning.\ The GRE Aptitude Test is administered on approximately 200 dates each year at different test centers throughout the world.

The curtailed schedule for New Yo:rk State will provide the GRE program the time to in- crease test development and to address other technical con- cerns generated by the new law in New York State. Other changes Other-steps taken by the GRK ,Board to comply with the New York law will also involve the · ·following program changes for the :period from Jan. 1 through Sept. 30, 1980: -Because of the very small number of examinees and the relatively high cost of developing special editions of the test, th·e use of the braille and cassette editions of the GRE Aptitude Test for han- dicapped examinees will be withdrawn in New York. -To a;void excessive delays in starting the testing sessions, walk-in registration will not be permitted at New York test centers in January or April for either the Aptitude Test or the Advanced Tests. Sussman expects attendance at the New York test centers for the reduced G RE administrations to be larger than usual, and every effort will be made to keep delays at a minimum. --The questions in the Aptitude Test (except the braille and cassette .editions) used on national testing dates on Jan. 12, April 26, and April 28, 1980, will be published ap- proximately nine weeks after the test dates and offered for sale at $2 a copy domestically, and$3 .. 75 overseas. The booklets will include correct answers to questions and instructions for computing scores from the numbers of right and wrong answers.

If there is disagreement with the previously reported score pro'duced by the electronic scanning process, such as a discrepancy resulting from faint marks, or incomplete erasures, the clerically derived score will be reported to all score recipeints designated by the examinee. \Score changes are highly unlikely, and any such changes are likely to be extremely small,\ Sussman said. \Examinees should be aware that rescoring may result in a lower score.\ -Requests for copies of an- swer sheets must be submitted within 90 days· and for clerical scoring within 120 days, of the date on which score reports are mailed to examinees. -The Special Administration Service test center in Ne~v York City will be closed as of Dec. 31, 1979.

Work this summer in the forests of Germany, on construction in Austria, on farms in Germany, Sweden and Denmark, In in- dustries in France and Ger- many, in hotels in Switzerland. Well there are these jobs available as well as jobs in Ireland, England, France, Italy, and Holland ope(! by the consent of the governments of these countries to American university students coming to Europe the next summer. For twenty years students made their way across the Atlantic through A.E.S . .Service to take part in the actual life of the people of these countrie&. The success of this project has caused a great deal of en- thusiastic interest and support both in America and Europe. Every year, the program has been expanded to include many more students and jobs. Already, many students have made applications for new summer jobs. American- European Student Service (on a non-profit_ basis) is offering these jobs to students in Ger- many, Scandinavia, England, Austria, Switzerland, France, Italy and Spain. The jobs consist of forestry work, childcare work (females only), farm work, hotel wor.k (limited numb'er available), con- struction work, and some other more qualified jobs requiring more specialized training. The purpose of this program is to afford the student an op- portunity to get into real living contact with the people and customs of Europe. In this way, a concrete effort can be made to learn something of the culture of Europe. In return for his or her work, the student will receive his or her room and board, plus a wage. However, students should keep in mind· that they will be working on the European economy, and wages will naturally be scaled ac- cordingly. The working con- ditions (hours, safety, regulations, legal protection, work permits) will be strictly controlled by the labor ministries of the countries in- volved. . . In most cases, the employers have requested especially for American students. Hence, they are particularly interested in the student and want to make work as interesting as possible. They are all informed of the intent of the program, and will help the student all they can in deriving the most from his trip to Europe ..

This committee and thus this report has recognized the need to improve the mechanisms which enable the Greek System -and the Administration to com- municate. They have recognized the need for a more dynamic ·role of the IFC in Greek affairs. The issue of centralization of fraternity- sorority affairs has been ad- dressed.

Saratoga Skis for the Blind Saratoga Springs, NY, has been chosen as the site for an international cross-country ski meet for blind and amputee skiers to be held in February 1981. Some 250 skiers and guides are expected from the United States. Canada, Great Britain, and the Scandinavian cow1tl1ies. Ski training and racing will be conducted at the Saratoga Spa State Park-Gideon Putnam Hotel complex. .

However, Bush remains as enthusiastic about his prospects in the early primary states as he was about the Iowa caucuses. The Republicans that~finished below Reagan and Bush are also perking up a little bit. The Bush victory showed them that Reagan is indeed vulnerable, and, although they finished out of the running in Iowa, they each have pockets of strength in some of the primary states. They'll still be trying to chip away at Reagan's support and political strength just as they by Ski•for~Light,- Inc., an outreach organization of the 105,000 member Sons of Norway Fraternal Benefit Society.

About 40 skiers are expected to par- have in the past several months. The difference now ts that Reagan has been shown to be heatable, and many people who supported the Reagan can- . didacy out of its inevitability will be having strong second thoughts. Although his strong showing was a definite boost to his campaign, Jimmy Carter also has a few worries in the im- mediate future. The first set of primaries are, for the IDOst part, in the New .England and Northeastern states, which is Kennedy territory. Right now the political pundits are saying that Kennedy will surge ahead of Carter in 'the early primaries, but we have to remain skep- tical.

' Page 14 . - . r OO~OOJ?DIENSlS~ January ~4, 198Q View from the Stands Controversy on the Black Market by DOUG SILVERSTEIN The latest controversy at my fingertips has been one of racial disagreement. The issue con- cerns the New York Knick's sagging attendance figures this year. The opposition claims that a major reason fer the fall in attendance is the fact that the Knicks have 110 white players on their team. I feel this is a minor factor, possibly causing a loss of 500 fans a game, no concern for any franchise these days. To be candid, who needs those ignorant, irrational and closed- minded \fans\ at the games anyhow. The biggest claim is that White fans need white players to identify with. I honestly feel that this is just an excuse for the probable reasons for not attending Knick games, such as a lack of interest in the game and also in a mediocre team. Throughout my entire life I have never understood the rationality of prejudice. Call me ignorant, but there is no dif· .ference between black people and white people. . - Anyhow, let's get back to the issue at hand. There are many reasons behind the Knicks poor attendance figures this year. The primary one is the Knicks record last year. They were 31· 51, in a season marred by a coaching change and monumental trades involving past superstars B9b McAdoo and Spencer Haywood. Thus season ticket sales plwnmetted to even lower· numbers than last year. Unless a team fields a competitive- team that has a viable chance to make the playoffs, the fans will not show ample support. Not only did the Knicks trade their \big name\ Heart Research • • • Continued from page 3 are incapable of resuming adequate pumping after surgery. Thus, said Shanebrook, the device provides a rest period during which the natural heart can heal itself. Shanebrook sald the mechanism consists of a hemofoil inlet valve that generates a vortex inside a pumping chamber pushing the blood through a streamlined nozzle to the aorta. The author or- co-author of more than 30 articles published in professional journals, Shanebrook received his Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from Syracuse University. He is being assisted this year by senior mechanical engineering students Vito Potenza of Utica and Mike Kolesa of Whitesboro, both ·of whom plan careers in biomedical engineering.

That is all right for a winner, but dangereus for a loser. The same conditions prevail this year, and the same lack of fan support persists. There has also been a general public disagreement over club policy during the last couple ·Of years. The Knicks originally designed a team built around superstars, but the plan back- fired when age and disorganization caught up with them. Only Earl Monroe is a holdover from those days, and his playing days seem to be waning. The management bUilt the fans up to a disappointment, and to this day, many still resent that: While the Knicks now rebuild around players such as Bill Cartwright, Michael Ray Richardson and Larry Demic, the fans have chosen to sit around and wait for a winner. The Mets and Rangers both discovered that New York fans fail to accept losing teams. The only solution is to build a team of unselfish players, as did Seattle, Phoenix, Boston and Atlanta. White people claim that they need white players to identify with. Let's settle the issue right now. A winner draws fans and fans will identify with a winner, no matter what race is · predominately represented on the court. For example, the Atlanta Hawks are in first place in the N.B.A.'s Central Division, while averaging over 10,000 fans per game. But three years ago, they were 29-53 and drew less than 5,000 fans per game, lowest in the league. Even though the Hawks had more white players on that team (John Wetzel, Steve Hawes and John Brown) compared to this year (Steve Hawesand Tom McMillen), the attendance figures strongly support my argument that the fans maih concern is seeing a winner, not players of their own race with whom they can identify. In addition, when the Boston Celtics drafted Indiana State star Larry Bird, critics figured with a competitive team and three white starters the . Celtics would draw better crowds than the Los Angeles Lakers with their mokie sen- sation Magic J ehnson, and only one white player (currently on That's the date when engineers from General Dynamics will be here on campus to talk technology with graduating engineering or science students. We'll be here to answer your questions and to tell you everything you need to know about our broad spectrum of opportunities and about how you can begin a rewarding career with General Dynamics. the injured list). But. figures support the fact that the Lakers continue to draw better on tfie road. The racial argument loses its legillinacy in both examples. The finat complaint I heard was conveyed to me by an unidentified Union Colleg.e student He said that blacks (the Knicks) play street baH, described as run-and~gun, free- shooting, defense-void basketball. Whatever the style of play of a ballplayer; , he. follows a rough predesigiled game plan. In other words, the players haven;t taken the art out of basketba-ll, the coaches have. lt goes without saying that of the twenty-two coaches in the N.B.A., only one is black ( Al Attles, Golden State Warriors). So if the style of' p)ay repulses you, blame the ad- ministrations, not the· players. F·or example, Brian Taylor, Lloyd Free, and Sidney Wicks of the San . Diego Clippers are three players known for their lack of shot selection. Their coach, Gene Shue, is white. If the soot fits. . . Basketball as an en- tertainment event should be the fan's only conc~rn. The point that I am trying to convey through the several examples cited is that an exciting winner will draw fans. Factors such as race are irrelevant when one thinks of how many fans are located in each city and how many actually attend the games. I applaud Larry Burke, president of the Knicks, for his attempts to deliver the fact that ability should be the only parameter in the consideration of building a winning hasketball team.

Cardany has been a starter on the Union Varsity basketball team since his freshman year. The junior guard has had a major impact on the Garnet hoop program. Joe an all around player, led the Dut- chmen quintet in scoring in both his freshm_en and sophomore year. Again this year, Joe is pacing the Union squad in scoring, averaging 18.3 points per game. The high scoring guard, a tri- · captain, did not let up this past week as he had two impressive performances. On January 16th Union played rugged Division I foe Colgate at hom_e. Colgate respected the Plattsburg-born guard so highly that they defensed him with a box and one. Despite Colgate's efforts, Cardany still led all Union scorers with 16 points as the Dutchmen barely missed up- setting the western New York State team. , On Saturday night against WPI, the 5 foot 10 inch guard was virtually unstoppable as he poured in 28 points, shooting a steller 60 percent from the floor .. Cardany was the only Dut- chmen to score in double figures leading the Garnet to a 75-57 win. In spite of numerous defensive changes by WPI to try • to stop him, they were unable to hold the shifty guard. During the- last two games Cardany also amassed 9 assists and five steals. JQe is now in fourth place on the all time. Union scoring lost, and is only 30 points shy of the 1000 :point mark.

·'\ Page 16 OO!'fOO:P,DIENSIS. Jan'uary .e4} 1980 sports Even at 5-5: Hoopsters Split. In an interesting week for Bill Scanlon's ·union basketball team, the Dutclunen barely missed pulling -off their second consecutive upset and then came back to upend a Division III foe to even their record at 5- 5. Fresh off a 63-60 upset win over Central Conn., Union was out to make it two in a row and had Division I Colgate on the ropes before bowing 67-62. The Dutchmen were up by as many as 14 points in the second half before wilting under the pressure of the deadly accurate right arm of Colgate's scoring machine, Mike Ferrara, who tallied 28, including 24 in the second half. Despite Ferrara's heroics, Union was partly responsible for its own collapse as they sank only 6 of 14 foul shots. Joe Cardany led Union with 16 markers. John Mon- tanile an~ .Joe Uveges added 12 apiece, and Dan Koubek did a nice j.ob coming off the bench as he canned 9 points. The Union hoop team romped over Worcester Polytechnic Institute this past Saturday by a score of 75-57,. although the game was not as close as the 18 point margin indicated. Leading by 10 points at half- thne, the Dutchmen turned the game into a rout by outscoring W.P.I. ~2-4 in the first six minutes of the 2nd half. The Dutchmen rode the hot hand of junior tri-captain Joe Cardany and a full-court pressing defense to break the game wide open. The Dutchmen were led by Cardany's 28 points on 12-20 shooting from the floor and 4 points from the foul line, in- cluding 17 first half points. Cardany is zeroing in on the 1,000 point mark for his career. The 28 point performance put SPORTS HAPPENINGS Varsity Hockey JV Hockey Jan. 24.

Just fourteen days ago . Coach Charlie Morrjson's Flying Dutchmen were near the cellar of the ECAC Division II West with a lowly 2-8-1 record. Now, two weeks and four consecutive victories later the Dutchmen stand in 8th place in the division with a substantially improved 6-8-1 mark. Playoff hopes then, were barely a dream;now, they are at the least being considered. The first eight teams in each division -make the playoffs. The keyingredient to the four consecutive ·· victories for the icemen of late (North Adams, · Oswego, Buffalo, and Pot- sdam), according to Morrison, is \damned hard work.\ They've really been working hard in practices and it's beginning to pay off. In the third period when most teams are tiring, we're just coming on.\ These past few weeks have given the team a taste of vic- tory. It's appetite wiii not be satiated by anything but a playoff berth. \Every team's aim is to make the playoffs,\ stated Morrison, who also hastened to add, \but we're a long way from them. We've got a very tough schedule and we must take each game, each period, each shift one at a time.\ Jim Josephson. Paul Nardusso put Buffalo on the board at 13:33 of the second- period, but Perras quickly countered at 15:06 with his second of the night. Ric.k MacLean and Tom Wilde finished out the scoring for Buffalo with goals in the third but the icing had already been put on the cake. In all, Union wasoutshot 37-26. by Buffalo but when the chips were down, Josephson was 1npenetrable. All in all, on his way to his thir$1 straight vic- tory, Josephson stopped 34 U of B shots. Dan Kowalchuck of Buffalo had 22 saves on the night. Union Squad Downs Potsdam4-2 Coming off of a fresh win at the hands_ of Buffalo, the Dut- chmen continued their meticulous streak edging Potsdam, 4-2-, in Potsdam. With the loss, Potsdam's record was dropped to 3-7 in Division II. The contest was sparked by two third period goals by fresh- . man Todd Fobare and yet another sharp performance ·by Dave Josephson. Fobare picked up his 6th and 7th .goals at 7.:13 and 10: 17, respectively, with Al DiLibero assisting on the latter. to give Uniori a 3-llead. Rick Frederick of Potsdam made the score 3-2 at 11:39 but Bill Mason swiftly added an ·insurance goal to increase his team leading point total to 19 at the midway point of the. period. Mason was assisted by Don Beall and Todd Fobare, the latter having 3 points for the night. Josephson's net play seems to be improving with each game. Against Potsdam en route to his f.ourth consecutive win, he turned back 26 Potsdam shots. A busy Potsdam goalie, Mark Brown, turned back 48 Union shots ..

January 31, 1980 Volume 109, Number 12 • Last week's Conco~diensis reported that this year's Student Tax. Budget had been approved ·by the Student Forum, with \heated discassion. \. Many of the concerns which prompted this debate and the decision of some of the Forwn members t<:~ vote 'agp.inst the budget hav~ come to light in the past week, and there are concerns which cast doubt on the procedure used in compiling this year's budget and point to the net:ld for change in the Tax Committee structure. The objections to the budget and budgeting procedure came in three major areas: that Tax Committee operations w~re sometimes slipshod, largely due to the fact that not enough Gf the committee members regularly · attended meetings; that the - Student Activities fee itself is too high; and that the Forum passed the budget as an· ex .. pediency, due to the fact that it was already over a term late in being enacted. Proiections For The Arts: 1980 One of those who voted against the budget, David Stern, Student Life Committee Representative to the Forum, articulated these major . con- . cerns. In some cases, Stern reported, the s.um of individual expenditures within a group's budget was less than the bottom line request of that group. He believes that discrepan.cies such as these were not noticed because few committee members were present for discussion of _ any one organization's proposed budget. Mark Burnett, Senior Trustee; Ken Plumb, President of the Forum, and Mike Brand, Chairman of the Tax. Com- mittee, all agreed that com- mittee attendance was a problem. Both Mr. Plumb and Mr.Burnett acknowledged that, in Mr.· Plumb's words, \He (Mike Brand) is the only one who knows what's going on;\ Mr. Plumb went on to charaeterize this one-person proc~dure as '!obviously wrong,'' but when asked of Mr:. Stern's proposal that a quorum for . committee meetings be established and that im- peachment be followed against absentee committee members, both he and Mr. Brand said that committee members could· not, of course, be forced to. attend by PAUL FEINSOT Bonner plots Arts' future. That was tbe title of a Concordy article in January of 1976. The· new President had recently toureqthe Arts Building and the Nott Memorial and noted the problem of tlie aging facilities. The Presi,dent remarked, \we'll work With maintenance to make the buildings more livable . • . the Nott Memorial as it stands is a hazard.\ Bonner also talked about two basic alternatives for the Arts at Union. The first choice was to build a new Arts center which would be complete with an Art Gallery, or to build a structure primarily f6r the ·theater. The President stressed that there would be no decision on the department's future until \we determine the educational programs' future.'; · • Four · years and. two Presidents later, with Arts Chairman Virginia Bush on the verge of leaving the College, the department seems to have come upon a sense of direction. In' a narrative account of ac- tivities (1979) Professor Bush claims that the Department of the Arts should be viewed differently from other depart-· ments at the College, because \it is made up of ·three programs Of widely divergent needs, and because it provides a range of outreach programs and other services to the College as a whole.\ Professor Bush assesses the programs in each of · tha.three areas of the department: art, music, drama. There are three faculty members who teach studio art courses, and one teaches art history. She describes the program in drawing as adequate, sculpture and photography as adequate, and she describes the programs in graphics and art history as weaker. The account states: \We hardly teach ,.any pai,nting, f.or whiCh _thete. ·1s _ relatively little demand, and rro ceramics; for which a substantial demand seems to exist. Overall, the programs ·manage to service non-majors well enough, but has r~latively few majors because both the facilities and the variety of offerings are insufficient to attract them. \ The music program consists of three faculty members, but because of released time for coaching the Glee Clubs (Wilson) and chamber music (Sheinkman and Dellario)~ actually has only ? 2-7 teaching faculty in music literature~ theory and composition. --The offerings in all these areas are thin, but all three must be covered in order to present a proper major. Individual in- struction in music performance is given by adjunct faculty who are paid directly by students; -A review of the curriculwn this year has brought some im- provement in the logical sequence of offerings, but the requirements and resources are still under-strength. A$ in art, music non-majors have adequa~e opportunities but full majors ~re frequently discouraged by the inadequacy of facilities and opportunities. In the drama section there are two faculty members teaching acting, directing, stage design and production. Here, as in music, released time for theatrical productions reduces the actual faculty time available for teaching. There is no voice and ~ction taught (except for this year because of sabbatical), and this is pero ceived as a critical lack in the program. Student activities funds no longer support theatrical productions and Presidential Discretionary Funds that have brought visiting artists to work . on those productions can no longer be counted on. The . dance practicum has been growing at a rapid pace and it is now administered by the department. Professor Bush suggests that \the possibility of hiring a regular faculty member rather than adjuncts should be investigated in the near future.\ Professor Bush notes that \because of its limited number of majors, the Arts department directs the majority of its energies towards service to non- majors and providing a balance within the liberal arts curriculum.\ The department provides for the extensive programs of the two glee clubs, the major theatrical produc- tions fall and winter terms, imd acts as advisor for student plays in the spring. Members of the faculty .also participate in the Art and Chamber Series Committees of the Schenectady Museum, as well as the College's Lectures, Films and Concert Committee. The Department runs the Baker and Jaffe Lecture Series as well as the exhibitions in the Union Gallery at the Schenectady Museum. The Department takes partial or full respon- sibility for Nott Memorial, the Chapel, and Old Chapel (aside from the Art Building). The Continued on page 4 Kellett Adds Input In an effort to obtain the administration's viewpoint on a number of key issues, the Forum invited Dean Kellett to its meeting this past week. The discussion centered around three areas: the Carnegie t:enovations of this past sum- mer, the present revamping of the tax committee, and the latest compromises ,put forth by the Governance Drafting Committee. Concerning - the Carnegie renovations, Dean Kellett briefly outlined the areas where money was spent, noting specifically how much mone~ was spent to improve each\ room. He added that there was still much work to be done in the building, though the attainment of the necessary funds would be difficult. Several Forum members specifically exA · pressed a desire to see the bathroom on the bottom floor of Carnegie repaired. Also, there was some extensive discussion on the Student Activities Capital Account which provided much of the funding for the Carnegie renovations. It was explained that this account will probably remain in existence only through this year. The account is under the discretion of the Dean of Students, though Dean Kellett mentioned that he will consult with the College Center Committee before the money is used in Carnegie. The account may.be used for the purchase of any . n~cessary . capital equip- ment directly related to student activities or any individual student group. During the discussion of the tax committee, Dean Kellett noted that his primary concern was the collection and official authorization of all budgets before the start of summer vacation .. He also expressed a concern that a closer audit be placed on all groups in order to help insure that student tax would not overspend . their budget. Dean Kellett accepted the most recent compromises of the Drafting Committee which stated that the proposed Student Affairs Council would \for- mulate and review policy concerning student conduct\ and would \outline the procedures to be followed by the Sub-Council on Student Con- duct\ though the responsibility for hearing the actual cases would rest with a sub-council made up of nine students and one administrator. In addition, he expressed general agreement with the section . stating that the Student Affairs Council will have responsibility for advising the Dean of Students and the Forum on matters of student life and student activities while the -Forum will continue to have direct authority for all student organizations. The next meeting is scheduled for Feb. 4 at 7:30 in 401 Car- negie.

Editorials .Tax Write-Off There has been a great deal of internal criticism (by members of the Student Forum) focused .on the procedures of the Student Tax Committe~ and the methods .bY which this committe~ and the Student Forum allocate Student Ac- tiviUes monies. Although the majority of the attacks have been focused·on the Tax Committee, in particular the present Tax Committee Cllairman, and may be warranted, the Student Forum, as the parent body, must ultimately bear the responsibility .for this committee and the ,integrity of the Tax Budget as a whole. Concordiensis recognizes that the Committee on Committees and the Student Constitution Drafting Committee are working to resolve the chronic structural and procedural problems which have afflicted the Tax Committee, and the problematic relationship between the varieus student activities, the Tax Com~ mittee, and the Student Forum. These two committees are to be applauded for the.ir efforts and urged to P.rocede expeditiously and thoughtfully towards a permanent resolution of the recent \student tax. controversy.\ The Forum, however, must carefully consider any proposed changes put before it regarding the distribution of these funds, in an effort to avoid the embarrassment afforded by an $8500 contingency fund'. , Finally, it may behoove the Forum to conduct an investigation into the ac- tivities of certain organizations, such as the Speakers Forum (in an effort to find out why Union students have to pa,y more than other colleges for certain speakers), in order to stop this money from being. spent unreasonably. After all, the significant issues regarding this Student Tax money do not arise until after budgeting. · Guest Editorial What are they doing, these editors of Concordiensis, why are they attacking about FEAR and LOAFING in Union I don't understand it and I don't think you do either. I mean these people these editors they probably are the same people these editors who think Liberal Learning is no good and I say what do you know ,, you never took the writing preceptorial that I took freshman year when I was a freshman. Why attack the conduct committee I say why attack it and infer things like the people on it are just there to put something in their resumes I don't un- derstand it· because I know a person on the committee who shows up at every single meeting. And when this other guy I know broke all the windows and doors and wash~g machines at West why he got told good and loud ne\Ter to do that again. Why his wrists stlll hurt. And why do the editors attack the director of security I want to know I mean here we have a man who works 8·5 three days a week and he tells those people you only see in grey cars to go 'round and 'round campus making sure the thermostats are set to 72 degrees no more because a president soon to be Bush Carter's order. Why the next thing you know, the editors of the Ooncordiensis will attack the housing office, ''Hello Ramada Inn,'' the beloved housing office where our motto is give me twelve people and I'll give you a room with eleven roommates.

Page 2 OONOORDIENSIS, Jan'UlJ.,ry 31) 1980 · Editorials Tax Write-Off There has been a great deal of internal criticism (by members of the Student Forum ) focused , on the procedures of the Student Tax Corn rnittee and the methods by which this committe~ and the Student Forum allocate Student Ac- tivities monies. Although the majority of the attacks have been focused on the Tax Committee, in particular the present Tax Committee Chairman, and may be warranted, the Student Forum, as the parent body, must ultimately bear the responsibility for this committee and the iJ1tegrity of the Tax Budget as a whole. Conco·,-diensis recognizes that the Committee on Committees and the Student Constitution Drafting Committee are working to resolve the chronic structural and procedural problems which have afflicted the Tax Committee, and the problematic relationship between the va:ri<ms student activities, the Tax Com- mittee, and the Student Forum. These two committees are to be applauded for their efforts and urged to procede expeditiously and thoughtfully towards a permanent resolution of the recent \student tax controversy.\ The Forum, however, must carefully consider any proposed changes put before it regarding the distribution of these funds, ln an effort to a void the embarrassment afforded by an $8500 contingency fund. Finally, it may behoove the Forum to conduct an investigation into the ac- tivities of certain organizations, such as the Speakers Forum (in an effort to find out why Union students have to pay more than other colleges for certain speakers), in order to stop this money f:rom being spent unreasonably. After all, the significant issues regarding this Student Tax money do not arise until after budgeting. Guest Editorial What are they doing, these editors of Concordiensis, why are they attacking about FEAR and LOAFING in Union I don't understand it and I don't think you do either. I mean these people these editors they probably are the same people these editors who think Liberal Learning is no good and I say what do you know you never took the writing preceptorial that I took freshman year when I was a freshman. Why attack the conduct committee I say why attack it and infer things like the people on it are just there to put something in their resumes I don't un- derstand it- because I know a person on the committee who shows up at every single meeting. And when this other guy I know broke all the windows and doors and washing machines at West why he got told good and loud never to do that again. Why his wrists still hurt. And why do the editors attack the director of security I want to know I mean here we have a man who works 8-5 three days a week and he tells those people you only see in grey cars to go 'round and 'round campus making sure the thermostats are set to 72 degrees no more because a president soon to be Bush Carter's order. Why the next thing you know, the editors of the Concordiensis will attack the housing office, ''Hello Ramada Inn,'' the beloved housing office where our motto is give me twelve people and I'll give you a room with eleven roommates. I say there is no fear and no loafing at Union College and as a senior in his last year at Union who knows the blueprints of Steinmetz Hall I say no there is none of what the editors call student apathy and even if there was I don't care. So lay off editors we got a damn good thing going at Union Schenectady in College and don't go knocking things at Union we hold sacred like for example the library e.g. they will be closed next week because a new book came in. And give the students here at Union College in Schenectady why where else can a Jew who is rich and from Long Island come to school and not be exposed to a single ethnic group other than caucasian for four years and what other school had a Cadillac dealer on campus and what other school dumps all of its money into a horror called Steinmetz Hall and what other school offers less courses for more money. I love Union College and these editors should think before they write like I do. I say God shines on Union and I say thank God for the Speakers Forum which recently gave us such giants as Mrs. Tom Bonner and Pete \no name from Diamantes\ Smith--so lay off there is no FEAR or LOAFING at Union only anti- cucumbers like the other hippie freaks in the Capital District but you won't find any \no-cukes\ weirdos on this campus why as a matter of fact I haven't ever even heard anyone mention any political issue yet except for PS 146 which recently answered the question what can we do to make the worlo a better place in which to live paper final exam.

See Mrs. Marra or a member of the Garnet staH. Letters Conduct To the Editor: Never has C{)ncordiensis done a greater disservice to the . Union College community than in the Editorial which appeared in the January 24th publication. The point trying to be made with respect to unwarranted violent behavior . by irrespon- sible students on campus is a good one. However this point should not have been made at the expense of the hardworking, responsible members of the Conduct Conunittee. I am a member of the Conduct Committee this year and I was also privileged to be associated with this most imvortant student organization Ia·st year at the time of the incident in question. As fflr as the Con- eordiensis account of the case is concerned, the accuracy ends with the initial statement ihat the case was ruled on in a closed session. The actual ruling of the Committee was that the per- . petrator of the violence, whose previous record was fat from unblemished, be expelled from Union indefinitely. The Conduct Committee has in the past and will continue in the future to recognize without question the right of all members of the college community to be free from violence. Our decision in this case, and inevitably any decisions we make in the future are far from what Con- cotdiensis referred to as an unwillingness to ''risk our necks.\ · This misrepresentation ·of the facts by Coneordiensis is almost as irresponsible as the violent behavior in question. lt is exactly this type .of uninformed journalism which undeservedly and tmfairly robs the Conduct Committee of its firmly established credibility.

If you are going to rebuke or attack a letter to the Editor, it should be done in a clear, dit'ect fashion which conveys your point.

This area has been judged to be a hazardous environment caused by i.nadequa te ventilation facilities. Students working in this room are subject to con- stant exposure of the fumes from the chemicals used in the developing process. OSHA has not inspected the premises but has allowed 30' days during which the condition must be investigated by the college and proper corrections must be initiated before the room is to be made available to students. Since last week this room has been- undergoing some ex- tensive changes. At this point in time it is not clear how much money will be invested in a major overhaul of the room but certainly the immediate problem of ventilation will be alleviated with the installation of an exhaust system. It is the hope of Dean Kellet that other general improvements be made such as increased coun- terspace, a tiled surface for the floor (as opposed to a wood floor which is subject to rotting), and the addition of better quality sinks. Also, it is hoped that improvements will provide increased workspace. It is not known at this time when these modifications will be com- pleted.

Careers in the arts are booming, however, and she indicated that the combined major may work to the ail- vantage of some students who wish to explore opportunities in the arts and still be directed in some other field. She indicated that the arts has the means to present a convincing case for the advancement of their prograifts, and that it must be the will of the College that determines if any of the carefully projected plans come into being.

Tax Comm. Continued from page 1 little loss to student organi~ations. As one e){ample of what he saw as wastefur spending, Mr. Stern reported that any organization which s.ubmitted its budget early received a reward in funding. Mr. Burnett acknowledged that the tax was a bit too high, ex- piaining that 'when the tax was last increased two years ago, it was made purposely too high in anticipation that inflation would soon consume any surplus that was accumulated in the first years. of ,its enactment. Thus, a contingency fund which would stretch over a period of many years was at first envisioned. However, both Mr. Burnett and Mr. Plumb stated that the present philosophy was to spend as close to all the money in one year as possible. Mr. Plumb also said, \I don't think the tax is too high,.\ as did Mr. Brand. Mr. Brand confirmed that organizations which submitted budgets bef(ilre the deadline were looked on more fa:vorably in the allocation of funds, but explained that the use of deadlines and incentives such as this were . decided by the Forum to be \the only wav\ in ' . >- \\· 0 0 if. which budgets could be made to meet the deadline. Finally~ Mr. Stern charged that ''the main reason the budget was passed was to get it out of our hair.\ \I felt it was our responsibility to make sure the council below us was ·han- dling its operations correctly\ and the Forum debate, which was under a Forum-voted time limit, did not adequately scrutinize these operations, Mr. Stern said. Both President Plumb and Trustee Burnett disagreed that the budget passage was expedient and felt that the budget itself ·~was satisfactory though, in. Mr. Burnett's words, \things could have been neater.\ \There's • no . question that there are a lot of problems now,\ Ken Plumb said, and all those interviewed agreed that true changes have to be made in the structure of the Tax Com- mittee.

.. CONCOBD_IENS18 1 Jan_~ry 31, 1~80. ~ag~ 5 SEA SileJlt . On Nukes by WILL HALLGREN One of today's hottest en- vironmental issues is 'that ·of nuclear power. One of the problems ·clouding the issue is that it is not only an en- viroilmental issue but a political and economic issue as well. For this reason there is no clear cut national stance that can he taken on this issue. Many, if not most environmental and con- sumer groups, including Ralpb Nadar's NYPERG ·(New York Public En vir onm en ta 1 Research Group), and the Sierra club, hav& taken an of- ficial stance against the use and proliferation of Nuclear Power. Union Col:lege has an en· vironmenta:l group called the Student Environm·enta 1 Alliance. SEA has not as yet taken a stance for or against nuclear power. It is for this reason that I was sent to talk to Gary Bowitch, the head. of the' SEA. . Mr. Bowitch said that there were basically three reasons why the orgainzation has not taken an explicit stance for or against nuclear power. The first reason is that there exists on this campus a \de facto, un- written rule\ that the tax committee will not fund - organizations that uphold politically partisan views. The tax committee has determined that nuclear power is a politically partisan issue. The reason the campus will not give tax committee money to politically partisan groups is that they feel that the views of the entire student body should be expressed by this money. Even though Mr. Bowitch said tnat he is personally against nuclear power, as are many other group members, the SEA cannot take a stand on it because their hands are tied by the organization funding structure at this school. The second reason Mr. Bowitch cited was that some people in the SEA are more interested in other iSsues such OJ L <I> .a c: j \' ::: Ill .., ,)- .a 0' e '& as Greenpeace, the killing of baby seals for · economtc reasons, and the possible destruction of a small fish, the snail darter, if the Telacodam is built. Taking a stand.on nuclear power may alienate these people from SEA. . Mr. Bowitch further stated that nuclear power is by far the most heated issue in emvironmental circles today. If the SEA were to take a stance on nuclear power, all the other environmental·issues Would be forced to take a back seat. · Mr. Bow.itch mentioned t)lat there is an organization on campus which has ta:ken ~an explicit stance against nuclear power. This group is called Union Collegians Against Nukes. This or,ganization is made up of many membf)rs from SEA, as well as other interested parties. This organization has not been ap- proved by the Conunittee on Committees, Mr. Bowitch said, be~ause it is too .politically partisan. Consequently, UCAN is unfunded and rather ijmited in what it can do. When I asked Mr.. Bowitch what the organization could do about the nuclear issue within the existing framework, he said that about all they can do is disseminate information. The -goals he has for the organization, considering the financial restrictions put on all politically ~'~artisan viewpoints', are to raise the conciousness of the campus community on environmental issues. Mr. Bowitch said that he and other group members will actively disseminate information against nuclear power, and will allow others who have an op- posing viewpoint to do .so also. He did say that those with op- posing viewpoints must put in the effort because he wili not do it for them. In ;;uch a ma,nner SEA has an \implicit stance against nuclear power\ even though they have been prevented ftom taking an ex- plicit stance either way. Mrs, Enid Morris proudly displays the baby grand piano. Union's ·First Lady byL YN~lE GREENBERG In. our daily routines, after walking past Davidson House and The · Administration Building, many of us pass the President's home. Few of us will ever have the chance to spend some time in~ide this house. This writer recentlY had the opportunity to spend a few hours inside talking to Mrs. Enid Morris,· the President's wife. · The Morris home is a busy one. Finding the phone free or Mrs. Morris at home is not an easy · task. After finally arranging a time with Mrs. Morris, I walked to those big white doors, pad and pen iri hand, and rang the doorbell. A petite Mrs. Morris answered the door and happily welcomed me in. The first sights of the President's home are beautiful. A long red carpet leads from the front door to the huge staircase ahead. The home is filled with beautiful antiques, many of which have been donated by Union alwnni. The first floor has a music room, complete with a museum-piece piano, and upstairs is ·an antique grand- father clock. Mrs. Morris proudly displays paintings of -Union's most famous president• -Eliphalet Nott. Mrs. Morris is from Europe. In her British accent, she ex- plains \I went to college in South Wales where I majored in Welsh literature and · history.\ She taught in one of the first experimental bi-lingual schools in Wales which later became a model for future schools. After spending twenty years in Hamilton, New York, at Colgate University, the Morrises· moved here this summer. Mrs. Morris finds Unioil and. Colgate \More similar than different. Both are very friendly, fine, liberal arts colleges. The major difference is their sett~gs.\ Mrs. Morris was not used to living in a city. \I find Schenectady a very open, receptive community. It has a lot to offer culturally.\ She especially enjoys walking through some of the shops ·on Jay 'Street or visiting the museum. \When I went to Hamilton for a day a few weeks ago I really looked forward, to . coming back to Schenectady.\ Mrs. Morris had gotten _in- volved with many of the ~c­ tivities on Union's campus. She especial).y enjoys the hockey games. As this writer talked to Mrs. Morris, someone delivered her hockey tickets for that night's game. \At the game against Colgate, I had no trouble deciding to cheer for Union. I hope Union wins the Colgate game on February 9.\ She also enjoys swimming in the Old Gym pool and is taking a. campus exercise class. During •o the fall, she was often seen fiding her bike on campus. Her hobbies include reading and cross-country skiing. She has been to many student events on campus, including the FIJI basketball marat'Jion . and a WRUC reception. (Yes, she does listen to WRUC.) As many upperclassmen know, Hale House served dinner to the Morrises last Thursday night. \If I were a student here I don't think I could find enough hours in the day to do everything I'd want to. I would definitely get involved in Big Brothers-Big Sisters and dramatics .. I'd want to get in- volved in all the extra- curricular activities.\ ' Mrs. Morris has found the Union College community very friendly and open. \l've gotten to know many of the faculty members and their families. We have a ·top rate faculty. Union is very special to them.\ She has also met many students and always wants to meet more. Mr.s. Morris says with a smile, \Union has a tremendous student body.\ \I have many roles here at Union as the President's wife. f help organize official functions that the President is responsible for. These take up a lot of time because there are many func- tions.\ Mrs. Morris describes her home as a public place on the campus, instead of a private home. She's currently involved with the refurbishing of the Hale House upper lounge. She also serves as an \am- bassador\ to the school. \I represent Union all over the country at such things as alumni functions.\ She has met many alumni who have a great deal of devotion to the school. Mrs. Morris is a strong supporter of co-ed colleges. \In fact, my husband made a presentation for Colgate to co- educational. Having women at a school adds gracefulness. Union is enhanced and enriched by having women here.\ She added with a chuckle, \Now n.ot as many Union men have to drive to Skidmore.\ If you see Mrs. Morris at hockey games, going swim· ming, or even eating dinner at Hale, be sure to say hello. She wants to meet you. Church Bulletin A picturesque sitting area In ttae Presidential. home.

Those wishing to attend are asked to contact the Albany League of Arts at 449-5380. Heaven Can Wait by KYLE BRESSLER Though it has often been the dream of many people to write a movie, produce it, direct it, and last but not least star in it, very few mortals have actually seen their name listed in big white letters more than once a film. In Heaven Can Wait, Warren Beatty · breaks this trend, however, and does so in an unexpectedly high style. Heaven Can Wait (1978) is actually the second remake of a 1941 flick Here Comes Mr. Jordan, the winner of two Academy Awards for best writing and best screenplay. The new version was also nominated for several awards. Without giving away too much of the plot, the movie goes as follows: Joe Pendleton, a star quarterback (played by the ubiquitous Mr~ Beatty), is mistakenly killed. On his arrival at a \way station\ that precedes heaven, Pendleton meets up with the head angel, played by Buck Henry (originally portrayed by Claude Rains,. who, unbeknownst to most Union students, has a large \amused\ followin_g on campus led by David Wollin), and Mr. Jordan (James Mason). He convinces them that they have made a large mistake, and strikes a deal to have himself sent back to earth when the right body is found. This body turns out to be that of the not-yet-dead millionaire Leo Farnsworth, and.from this point the story takes off; · The acting is excellent all around with Dyan Cannon, Charles Grodin, Buck Henry, and Mr. Beatty performing notably. Ms. Cannon won . an Oscar for her role, providing the viewing audience··with some of on the screen, a Ia Barbara the funniest scenes in the film Streisand.

Mode.rn dance, dance im~ provisation, jazz and ballet makeup the dam~e curriculm and give every interested student a variety of dance forms to choose from. One of the most popular beginners classes is ballet, taught by Darlene Myers. This _ is the second winter term it has been offered and the response has been tremendous .. With as many as thirty-eight students in room 202 of the Arts building the . class can be crowded·. More advanced classes are limited in number of participants· at any one. time. According to Ms. Myers the course is popular as an exercise class butAt is also useful for tl~ose wishing to understand their bodies' capabilities better. In this sense students involved in theater or sports can find this class very beneficiaL The discipline and technical aspects. of ballet are important features of the course. If the technicality and .discipline of ballet scare you then perhaps modern dance would seem more .inviting. Althougn this is only the second term that modern dance has been effered by the Arts Department, it has been taught regularly for seven y{!ars. According to Hel.ga Pritchard who teaches modern dance along with Pat Castelli, students (most of whom are female) take the course for the exercise and self expression.

This type of statement precisely depicts the general American attitude concerning the Iranian crisis. . 'Fhe vengeful attitude towards the Iranians was a spontaneous reaction to the holding of 5() American hostages in the U.S. embassy in Tehran. Ever since the siezure of the embassy, American business has ex- ploited the situation by selling songs, badges, and bumper stickers which all aim at criticizing Iran and, more specifically, the Ayatullah Khomeini. Some of the harsher slogans printed on the paraphenalia say things such as \Iran sucks\ \kill Khomeini\ and \death to Iran.\ Campus controversy reached a climax as members of the Hands Off the Shah Committee protested outside the lecture Iran,mor Khomeni's ·adherence to the principals of a fun- damentalist Islamic sect, is compatible with the culture. or with the thinking of the Iranian people. . Educated at the Sourbonne, Hoveyda is considered to be both a scholar and a diplomat. As a political refugee in this country, Hoveyda lives in New York with his wife and two daughters. He has been writing @>3nd lecturing and has com- pleted a book entitled, \The Fall of the Shah,\ which will be published in the United States this spring. He is currently at work on a tiook about Khomeni. Hoveyda says of events. in Iran last year, \My country was overthrown by a religious fanatic whose harsh dic- tatorship is without precedent in modern times; it replaced the authoritarian and too often diffident rule of the Shah. \My life has been turned upside down and I have been severed from my country, my hoine, my belongings,oand most 'of all·my family.''

Hoveyda, brother of slain Iranian Prime minister Amir Abbas Hoveyda, presented an historical perspective. of events in Iran which led to Khomeni's takeover. Specifically, Hoveyda attempted to show that neither the Shah's plans to westernize Iranian Embassy in Paris in the 1940s. , In addition to his work in government service, Hoveyda has written five novels and has · had his artwork displayed in galleries in New York and several other American cities. His interests range from avant- >- garde theater to fiim making to i psychology, which be studied at 8 the Center of Psychological ~ Studies in Paris. · ~\- Hoveyda has held positions as ~ mass communications and ~ literacy specialist · with .if UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organ~ation) and in 1976 won the Planetary Citizens Award for his concern and work on environmental issues. Hoveyda began his speech by citing the following incidents: \December 31, 1977 President Carter while dining with the Shah pronounced his host as a 'great leader, beloved by his direct OpposUion with the Iranians who wished to .see their country progress in both economic and technological direct~ons. To thelnttergroup's dismay, Khomeni emerged among the masses as a ''father figure\ and instituted the following measures 1 ~· a one party system, . 2) a judiciary adaptaple to Islamic law 3) power .of the Clergy to oversee '11 ands off the Shahr' power.\ They cited faCt$• that .previous to the Shah's .agrarian reforms, Iran was .self- sufficient, but now imports over 60 ,percent of their food stuffs. The committee explained the present actions of the Iranians as ''a revival-directed against the intervention of foreign powers.\ A major complaint of the committee centered around the SAVAK, the Shah's secret police. The Savak was created with the help of the C.I.A. and the Israeli secret police. This group along with the Imperial Army of the Shah was used for repression of all popular movements against the Shah's government, actions which resulted in many deaths. people.' Eight days later, on January 8, 1978, riots burst out in the City of Qom.'' The downfall of the Shah came within twelve months of this incident, stunning everyone. Most political figures thought this powerful regime would never crumble. Hoveyda attributed the fall of the Shah to four primary fac- tors: (1) The shift in American policy toward Iran in 1973, during the Nixon ad- ministration. Through this \Nixon Doctrine' •, the Shah was given the permission to build up a huge army and, buy whatever arms needed. In effect, Iran became the \policeman\ of the Persian gulf. (2) the rise in the price of oil in 1974. The Shah's decision to pour extra money into the economy pr.:ovoked skyrocketing inflation. In '74, the budget of the country was ,two billion dollars as compared to fifty'billion in '75 (3) changes in the inlternal policy of Iran. The Shah's decision to fight inflation by cutting all low in,. terest loans and.p~tting ceiling on grants affected middle class and merchants we 'well as in- dustries in a detrimental '·fashion. (4) Absence · of leadership. As the SHah's personality changed, he began to ignore the· advice given to him by technocrats. The Shah, believed to· have suffered a brain stroke, was ''no longer the same man.\ Th~ Shah disregarded the cultural effects on the economy. \The rapidity ,.of the develop- ment of Iran was not respon- sible for the destruction of the Shah's regime but rather it was the underestimation of the influence of cultural factors.\ The resurgence of Islamic principals in Iran grew out of the desire of some Iranians to restablish the traditional values ·· that existedin the 17th and 18th centuries. The viewpoint was in the administration, 4) ban on co-ed education, 5) han on aU forms of music except for religious music and marches, 6) condemnation to those who do not follow Islamic principles·, resulting in a press and media who reflect only Islamic ideas. Tl1e Ambassador believes that the practicalptoblems that Will face Iran, as a result of limited land and water re§ources and high rates of 'population, \cannot be solved by religious principles but high technology.'' Hoveyda remains reasonably optimistic about the future. He encourages Iranian students in this country to study as hard as .possible to master the new technologies that are emerging and .:then to utilize their knowledge in their horne country. Hands Off the Shah - The members of the Hands Off the Shah' committee were active in trying to eJ«fadite the Shah of Iran. Their visit to It seems that. we are reacting to this crisis with little attempt to understand the long developed r.easons. for this Iranian move. We are simply opposing the irrational, anti- American hatred of Iranians with a hatred that could be considered equally as irrational. The ·entire media, with the exception of a few thoughtful attempts, have covered the crisis in a way that focuses primarily' on exposing the hatred felt by most Iranians, and how this hatred relates to Americans. However, few coyerages try to explore the underlying reasons for the present Iranian attitude. Instead, ·the media produces shallow, shortsigflted observations that show little attempt to understand the basic ideological clash between the · Iranians and Americans. \The U.S. has the responsibility· to oomit it was wrong.\ tlie campus was, to expose the United States government, the C.I.A. and mostly to ex:pose the Shah.\ They .stated that_ Hoveyda was part of the Shah's regime, helping him kill people and destruct the economy. They feel that. Hoveyda is now betraying the Shah in order to gain power for himself and a group of Iranians. They are holding the United States responsible for the crisis as they say, \It was the C.I.A. who reinstated the Shah into -a student' . Since the Iranian's basic ideology centers around religion, they should be freely allowed to create their own government based on whatever religious-economi'C· mix they choose. Americans possess no right to inject partial ·capitalism into this government• . Yet the Americans did invest capital into Iran so that they ~could spur the Shah's moder- nization ,program.

- ' Page 1~ I l OONOORDII!JNS!S, January 31~ 1980 ' Money Talk by HOWARD BRODSKY The stock market continued another week of heavy in- stitutional and professional buying, with the Dow Jones industrial average advancing 8.96 to c_lose at 876.11. The major institutions and wealthy in- dividual investors again decided to go back into the market because of the low prices on many high~quality issues. This return to buying, by the cash~laden institutions, created a heavy trading week for the market.~ For the near future I am favoring stocks within the defense group, oil and natural gas, and precious metals issues. The defense sector will see a rise in prices within the near future because of continuing pressure concerning the situation in Afghanistan and Iran. This will eventually lead to an increase in defense spending by the federal government. The oil issues will definitely react to the rising earnings reports that were reported by the major oil companies in the past week. Also in the oil group I am favoring an issue called Central Louisiana Energy on the New York Exchange, which has seen a major run-up in the past few weeks. A Union College student who wishes to remain anonymous, has reaped in this run-up and would like to share this winner with his peers. This company is well managed and seems to be a good prospect for tlfe near future. , to the continued rise in precious metals prices. I will now give a comparison between money-market fWlds and savings bank certificate..s. The small investor loves the savings bank because it is safe, (insured up to $40,000 by the F .D.I.C. ), and easy to deposit and withdraw your ~ssets: The one disadvantage to the idea of the savings bank is concerning interest rates: A regular savings bankbook pays 5 and % - percent interest as compared.to about.13 percent interest iJ;I. the money market funds. The money market fund that I will'·use as the control for our comparison is the Dreyfus Corporation, who mana,ges over 5 billion dollars for more than half a million investors.

I am also looking towards stocks Fithin the precious metals group to show a major run-up if the prices of precious metals continue to climb. This Concordy analyst personally feels that if the dollar ~ontinues to devaluate and the inflation rate continues to climb, the price of gold will continue to reach new highs. My view has been. challenged by Union College Sophmore Stu Bober, who feels that \as the political situation overseas worsens, the price of gold will continue to drop.\ In the precious metals group I am favoring Homestake Mining, Texas Gulf, and Sun- shine Mining to react positive.ly ment. They also invest in certificates of Deposit issued by banks that have assets over 1 billion dollars. Dreyfus in- vestments can be made in small amounts through your stock broker, or directly through the Dreyfus Corporation. I kilow that there are a great number of readers who have a good amount of savings tied up in bank certificates at a low in- terest rate for a good 4 to 6 years. This money should be earning a high yield . with liquidity in the Dreyfus Fund. I am looking for the interest rates within the money market group to continue at these high levels and for the money market funds to remain as a solid place where the smaii investor can try to wage 'war' against double•digit inflation.

My concern is that in our present mood of frustration we Will embrace ''belligerent isolationism\ and stay out of the affairs of the world unless and until the challenge requires practically unlimited (i.e. nuclear) response. The liltely prospe.c.t of ''massive retaliation\ as the one and only strategic option would leave us in fact with no option at all. It woulq; lead to the fur~her mHitarization of Amencan foreign policy e~acerbate in- stability . in the world, and provide political . ammunition for the domestic extremists of the Right to ·demand \victory over communism\ and for the lean-over-backward utopians ·Of the Left to advocate unilateral disarmament. In short, the long-term implications of defeat in Vietnam are more troubling than defeat itself. Only if we eX:tricate ourselves from this war in such a fashion so as to create a new foreign · policy for the United States, one that realizes the lilmits of American power and avoids the twin dangers of tbe American temper: the nostalgia of isolationism and the illusion of omnipotence.

Page 14 CQ~CORDIENS!S, January 81, 1~80. 6port8 Achilles Rink: Cu ding: An Olympic Sport by KARL STEIDL Curling, an Olympic sport, originated in Scotland, and today is the number one national participating sport in Canada. The game, a sort of shuffleboard on ice, is played with two-four men teams. These teams are comprised of four · men, four women, or an equal 'llix of each. The court played .:m, termed a \sheet'' is ap- proximately 140 feet long, fourteen feet wide, and has two bullseyes twelve feet from each end. Eight \stones\ are curled per team, two from each player~ The team with the '~stone\ closest to the bullseye, obtains a score. The four players, one shooter, two sweepers, and a captain (usually the best curler on the tearn), determine where the \stone1' will stop. In going_ from one \emf' to the other, the two sweepers sweep the semi- rough ice in 'front .of the \stone\, which is shot by the first player, to either increase or decrease tbe \stones\ speed. The captain tells the sweepers whether to sweep or not. In Achilles Rink, there is a curling facility, which is now open to students for winter participation. On the intramural level, ten teams partake in curling every Monday and Thursday; 7:30-9:30 p.m. The inside of this beautiful facility contains four ''sheets\ of ice; thus thirty-two curlers can play at a time. The main benefit of curling at . Union is that it is free, and the Senior \Sparky Anderson moves on in. Hockey. Continued from page 16 Josephson stopped 28 shots for Union. With the win Babson upped it's record to 10-3-1. Colby Outplays Union, 6-2 After the Babson loss the Dutchmen took to the road, this time headed for Colby up in cold Maine. Colby proved to be an unhospitable ·host, scoring 4 quick unanswered goals in the opening stanit~ of play before the bewildered Dutchmen could · pull themselves up by their bootstraps and play even for the rest of the game. Dan O'Halleran, Marshall Hogan, Dale Hewitt, and Mark Hogan all tallied for Colby in the first period, with the. first goal corriing just 33 seconds into the game off of Union Goalie Mike Merlo who had not seen the ice for six games, In the second, John Curt- seaton extended the Colby lead to 5-0 at the 7:23 mark on a slapper .over Merlo's .shoulder. It wasn't until the third period that the Outchmen finally got on • the board.· At 4:43, scoring leader Bill Mason tallied on an assist from Jim Josephson. Following the sixth Colby goal by Mark Murphy, red-hot Don Beall scored a futile goal only 35 seconds before the end of the game, on assists by Fobare and Mason. Colby outshot Union by a margin of 48-36, with Dutchmen goalie Merlo stopping 42 shots and Coll)y netman Joe Faulstick saving 34. . The loss dropped the Garnet to a 6-11-1 mark and their third consecutive loss. The Skating Dutchmen return home for a difficult week. Last night, Wednesday, the Garnet faced tough Middlebury, ranked second in Division II West at Achilles Hlnk. Saturday the team meets an even stronger opponent in Holy cross, ranked Iirst in a tie with powerhouse , Bowdoin, in the eastern wing of Division II. The game marks the First Annual \Go GARNET GO\ Night. · Tickets are available for this latter contest beginning Thursday morning at 8:30AM. facility is \open'' to all- students, Monday through Friday from 3:30-5:00. There can also be \Bonspiels\ where six to twenty teams curl against each other,. with the winner, through etiquette, buying the losers drinks. But the only way Union College could. have a \Bonspiel\, is if a larger number of students begin to participate in the sport. The game will stay with the player forever, and is one of a very few sports, w)lere some Union College students have pla$'ed. against national teams. More information, and instructions on the game, can be obtained at Union College by calling Mike Nassar \(393-5345) or Jon Stevenson (370-6613). Curling at Achilles Rink Sports Com·mentary: A .View From The StcJrids by DOUG SILVERSTEIN The ballots are in and the N.B.A. All-8tar game will soon be played. Players such as Bill Walton, Pete Maravich, Rick Barry, and Bob McAdoo no longer linger in the limelight, at least in that as shined by the fans. Yes, another game, but another commencement of the · argument over whose jurisdiction it is to select the players for the midseason classic. For only the past few years, the league has given the- fans the privilege of making the selections. A privilege indeed. John Drew and · Eddie Johnson, two virtual unknowns from the Atlanta Hawks will start for the Eastern Con- ference squad. Logical question is, how, if they're unknowrt, did they receive the election as All- Stars? Well, publicity directors at the Omni in Atlanta, the Hawks home stadium, cir- culated between quarters and collected the ballots, saving the fans the expenditure of energy. This, in addition to a rigorous promotion campaign culminated in .... what is com~ monly known as · stuffing the ballot boxes. Who really cares? The fans?, NOT REALLY. The players, not really. Even the owners are sensible enough to let the fans vote, in hope they can bring more fans into the arenas. Let the fans stuff the boxes, at least it exemplifies that in an era in which at- tendanceis on the decline, a few fans still possess sentiments towards their local heroes. Critics will argue that the voting is biased, hasty and unfair. But what you, the fan, must realize is that you pay the · exorbitant ticket prices, you watch the games on television, and in essence, you are your The Union swim team slipped to 1-3 with a 62-51loss at Kings Point Saturday (1-26) but not without getting outstanding performances from sophomore Chris Meyer an~ senior co- captain Mark Peronto. Peronto won the 200 yard butterfly and 200 yard breaststroke events and now has five individual victories and th~ee second place \'' ~ .. • • I teams' destiny. Not so unreasonable when you think about it. So why shouldn't you receive .the miniscule right to express your opinion. The players are mature enough not to raise controversies. Leave the controversies to me. Only Bob Lanier has denounced the present system, and his claim was unsubstantiated. In additioi;l, there's no credence to the myth that the sportswriters are on such a higher intellectual level that they deserve full jurisdiction over the vote (with one ex- ception, of course! ) Many fans have a decent notion of who is eligible for the contest, and they only select five of the fifteen players on each squad. So if you think the fans are showing their lack of knowledge and this in turn is unfavorable to the game, . than let it be. Let the fans be happy, the owners always have the last laugh. Here are my votes for· the All- Star game: ,.... Eastern Conference Julius Erving, Philadelphia - Forward Larry Bird, Boston - Forward Moses Malone, Houston - Center George Gervin, San Antonio - Guard M.R. Richardson, New York- Guard Western Conference Scott Wefunann, KansasCity- \\ Forward Lonnie Shelton, Seattle - Forward \' K.A.

He has recorded eight firsts and three team relay victories for a total of 55 p(>in~ this season. Guard Justice will only be served with a brief dedication to one of the greatest showc~ses in N.B.A. history, Pete Maravich. Sinee· he entered the league in 1970, the \Pistol\ has played for -Atlanta, New. Orleans and Utah (relocated (rom New OrleC;~Ds in 1979). ·He has always been an exhilorating, but to many a fundamentally' lacking_ per- former. Be has thetools to be a solid · team player, · but has always lacked the personnel around him. Until recently. This year-, the Utah Jazz were 2-19 when Maravich became the goat and was relegated to coach Tom Nissaulke's doghouse. And he sat, and sat. .. Finally, the Jazz placed him on waivers. The handling of the situation by Nissaul\ke and General Manager Frank Layden rhay have bee.n psychologically damaging to Maravich. What is so disheartening is that Pete ' was playing his best ball in the last couple of years and was .feeling almost no pain from his damaged knees. Ironically, his last injury qccured during one of his acrobatic exhibitions in 1978. Nissaulke's replacements are the aging Mack Calvin and Ron Boone, and motor-mouth Terry Furlow. So Pete now . takes his traveling show to Boston, the firstlegitimate winner he's ever played for in the N.B.A. Finally, he can coordin·ate 'his super- natural talents with his always present fundamental skills. At ~1, .his playing days are not everlasting, and his knees occasionally give him problems. But at least Pete will go out in style and prove his worth. The \Pistol\ will once again Shoot for the stars, and find himself.

Fortunately, COACH Wirth brings to lJnion, ~long with his wealth of experience and knowledge, specific, concrete ideas fpr . rebuilding Onion foot ball into a solid contender in Division III ;play. · Coach Wirth's plan for reviving the stagna'nt Unton gridiron program is two-fold. First, he plans 1 to reconstruct the offense and defense for· merly used by the Dutchmen by making certain x sy~tem changes. In past years, both the offensive and defensive units used primarily one formation to line up in. With plans to use several offensive and defensive sets. \The strength of multiple sets is that the opponent can not practice and prepare for every option ~of every set in one week,\ says Wirth. \We will have several sets, . both of,.. . fensiyely and defensively, so that no team can be .completely prepared for us.\ The other part Qf Wirth's plan is future oriented; ,he plans to upgrade the recr11iting pr()gress. For this, Wirth.proposeda three day recruiting weekend in which a prospective .student- player will arive here Thursday night and spend Friday and Saturday and lea\Tll Sunda\y; '' This would allow the young man achancP to 1 seeallaspects ofUnion College hfe. He can go to classes on Friday, see the college's social life on Friday pight and observe the student par- ticipation in athletic events on Saturday,\ explains Wirth. Also, Wirth would like to recruit more local talent for the Dut- chmen. \There are some out- standing high school players in the capital district that would be a tremendous boost to our Captain Pete V ielkind Track Even Despite a pair of wi!ls by Henry Wrigbt, the Union College track team was beaten by Colgate Saturday by a score of 88-4B. Wright captured both the long jump, with a 20-4¥.;~ effort, and the triple jump to remain unbeaten \this year. Other than, the pair of wins by Wright, the Dutchmen scored only three first place finishes. Senior co-captain Matt Guilfoyle turned in the most impressive win of the day with a school record 1:06.6 in the 500 meters. Teammate Pete Yielkind coasted to an easy win In the 1000 meter run while lean freshman Adam Licht con- tributed a victory in the 1500 meters with a time of 4:03.9. Union athletes also recorded six second place finishes. Bob Pavacic finished second in the shot put with a toss .of 44 11¥2. The performance · was especially impressive since Pavacic had been sidelined six weeks with a dislocated finger. Other runner~up finishes were scored by Brad Kline in the 35 lb. weight; Jack Connor in. the 3,000meterrun; Marc Nazonin the 55m. hurdles and freshman Dennis Contois in the half mile. The final second place finish was scored by freshmen Roger Adler and Tony Natido in the pole vault. The pair both clear 12 feet to tie for second. Another, impressive per- formance was turned in by Ed Arnheiter in the 1500 meters. Arnheiter put on an impressive sprint over the last 200 meters to, finish third in 4: 08.5;just one- tenth of a second behind the race nfnner-up. ·· Union, now 1-1-1 on the year, returns to action Sat11rday when they host Springfield and Oswego at the Field House.

Once you start winning, it becomes contagious.'' Let's hope that Coach Wirth's for- mula will help the Union gridders catch the winning fever.

VanBentham, a 1975 graduate of Niskayuna High School, picked ~P his sixth victory in eight matches on Saturday ( 1· 26) as the Union College ·wrestling team defeated Kings Point, 28-17. . VanBentham's only losses this season have been to Albany State's Paul Hornbach and, although Union has only a 2-6 record, he now leads the team, with , a 6-2 mark, including pinning two ()pponents. . As a mechanical and elec- trical engineering major in a , five year · program, Van- bentham passed up wrestling his first year at Union but has since recorded over 40 dual meet victories. During t~e past two seasons, Matt has wrestled exclusively in the 177 and 190 pound weight classes. Four of his victories this season have come in the latter category. Last season in the qualifying competition for the national championships. · held in· New York City, Matt finished fourth and was eligible to compete in J .. v. The J .V. hockey team under Coach Bob Driscoll has rebounded from a rather dismal start with three wins and two losses after the holiday break. The games included a split with North Country Cornm. Col. in which N.C.C.C. won the first game 4·2 and the Dutchmen, traveling to Lake Placid, beat · the N orthmen in the new Olympic Ice Arena, 3-2. Bet- . ween the. games against N.C.C.C., the J.V. team had a couple of itnpreslllv:e shutout victories. The first was against the nationals even though he did not. VanBentham wrestled for four years in high school under coach Joe Bena and was a sectional champion. During his first two years of wrestling at Union he competed in the 167 weight class and did well enough in the state qualifying . meet each year to go to the national championships, although ·not placing in those. meets either time. Miller Athlete of the Week Matt Van South Kent, 10-0, and the other against a tough Middlebury J.V. club, 4-0. The J.V. skaters also lost to a very talented Chicago Blackhawk Farm team, 6-C. Some outstanding goalten- ding has been turned in by freshman Bob Hohnes not to slight Lee Towne's effort against South Kent. Hglmes has played impressively to keep the team within striking distance in all the games he has played. There has been some inspir~d play and hard hitting by Mike Rogers, Gus Reall, Randy Clark, and Bill Gould. Greg White, Rob Norton, and the Canadian Connection of Jerry Rogers and Brian Turnbull have been providing the scoring punch. Solid defense has been turned in by Ben Lasher, Tom DeMarco, Ken Karlson and Tim O'Brian. Come watch the J. V. team play Saturday against a tough Archbishop Williams squad at around 4:30 p.m.

Page 1S OONOORDIENSIS~ January S1,, t~~o· 5porte Catdei ny's 1 ,OOOth: Hoopers Over .s,o.o '>y RABBIT With an offensive blitzkrieg :hal hadbeel) missing in recent years, and an impressive landmark ooing reached by Junior Joe Cardany, the Union _9ollege varsity basketball team rolled to a 110-69 victory over visiting B. ingharnton State last week. In tbe process, the Dutch- men set several new highs. under tlle direction of Coach Bill Scanlon, and showed that they will be a toagh force to reckon with in their final 13 games stretch tlris year. In upping their record to 6-5 with the r<>ut. Union Dominated the Col()nials in every aspect of the game. Early in the going, a series of press-breaking fast breaks gave the visitors a short- lived lead. It soon became appare11t, however, that the Dutchmen persistence and hot shooting were just too much for 2-9 Binghamton. Once again, the offensive thrust was led by Junior Guard Joe Cardany. In the process of his 32 point ·performance car- d any JJecame only the 4th Skaters Slide: player in Union history to top 1000 points in a career. His current 1004 points stands 4th on the all-time list, and he needs only 4 and ISS points to move into 3rd and 2nd places, respectively. ' The 32 PQint performance (on 13-23 shooting, 6-6 free throws, 3 steals and 3 assists, all in only 29 minutes) was a personal high for Cardany, and marked the first time since All-American Jim Tedisco (Union's No. 1 Scorer) scored 41 in 1972 that a Union hoopster topped 30. The hot shooting night also enabled Cardany to become the first player to score 30 or more points for a Scanlon-.coached team. As the second of his two free throws fell early in the second half to reach 1000, the game was- stopped, the ball presented to Joe, and a sparse crowd rose in· appreciation to tlle person who could very well become Union's top all-time scorer. \\:Cardany, however, was not the whole show, as each and every Dutchman got into the scoring column. The century mark was last revealed in a 104- 76 victory over Trinity in 1976, and the 110 point total was the most since a 115 vs. Loyola of Montreal in 1972.
